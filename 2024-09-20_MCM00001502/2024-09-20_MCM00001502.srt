1
00:00:03,875 --> 00:00:07,857
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, Lorena, do you want to start off with an announcement?

2
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:16,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Lorena's having trouble with her internet and her video dropped.

3
00:00:18,902 --> 00:00:23,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I think I should be good now.

4
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:24,945
[SPEAKER_07]: It was freezing.

5
00:00:24,965 --> 00:00:29,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to start about Italian and Spanish?

6
00:00:31,762 --> 00:00:32,322
[SPEAKER_04]: You can say that now.

7
00:00:32,342 --> 00:00:33,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I still can't hear anything.

8
00:00:37,265 --> 00:00:45,349
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, maybe we can let, give her the chance to jump in and say that after, and we can get started with Alex.

9
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:47,691
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

10
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:48,371
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, everyone.

11
00:00:48,411 --> 00:00:50,852
[SPEAKER_13]: I know we're still having people coming in from the waiting room.

12
00:00:51,713 --> 00:00:53,094
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Alex Lopenhoff.

13
00:00:53,134 --> 00:00:57,276
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to introduce myself as the chair of Housing Medford.

14
00:00:57,336 --> 00:01:01,238
[SPEAKER_13]: We are co-hosting this information session tonight with the city of Medford.

15
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,244
[SPEAKER_13]: So welcome, everyone.

16
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:27,279
[SPEAKER_13]: Lorena from Community Development was having a couple of internet issues, but she wanted everyone to know that she was going to say that if you have the need, you can ask questions in Spanish or in Italian in the various ways when we get to the Q&A, and that if you do call her office at a later time, you can call and ask questions in those languages in addition to English.

17
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:29,400
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully, we get her internet back working later.

18
00:01:31,044 --> 00:01:34,387
[SPEAKER_13]: But I wanted to say welcome to this information session about housing assistance programs.

19
00:01:34,947 --> 00:01:42,132
[SPEAKER_13]: We know this is a very important topic right now with COVID-19 affecting so many people's jobs and housing situations.

20
00:01:42,633 --> 00:01:45,735
[SPEAKER_13]: So we hope this info session can help you understand all of your resources.

21
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:49,698
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you so much to the city of Medford and to all of the organizations who are presenting tonight.

22
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:55,683
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanna say that navigating these resources can be confusing at times.

23
00:01:56,143 --> 00:01:58,465
[SPEAKER_13]: So I wanna encourage everyone who's here to learn

24
00:01:59,557 --> 00:02:04,599
[SPEAKER_13]: to ask any and all questions during the Q&A, and we really hope that we can get everything answered for you.

25
00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:14,742
[SPEAKER_13]: Before we move on to talking about the different resources that are available for housing assistance, I want to briefly discuss what Housing Medford is, the group that I work with.

26
00:02:15,422 --> 00:02:23,365
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're just a volunteer group of people who are interested in affordable housing issues in Medford, maybe live in Medford or work in Medford or both.

27
00:02:24,504 --> 00:02:28,988
[SPEAKER_13]: And we just do everything in our power to work toward greater housing affordability in the city.

28
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:45,481
[SPEAKER_13]: So our mission is to identify and to advocate for affordable housing solutions that can just expand options to meet everyone's housing needs at all stages of life, different incomes, abilities, wherever you are in the city and in your life to be able to afford housing.

29
00:02:46,562 --> 00:02:49,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone is welcome to be involved if you are interested.

30
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:54,211
[SPEAKER_13]: please just email housingmadford at gmail.com to learn more.

31
00:02:54,251 --> 00:02:55,111
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll be in touch with you.

32
00:02:55,472 --> 00:02:59,614
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have a general meeting coming up on Monday, May 25th at 6.30 PM.

33
00:02:59,774 --> 00:03:02,855
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you're interested in that, I can send along the Zoom link.

34
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:07,738
[SPEAKER_13]: And we really hope to hear more from all of you soon.

35
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:15,842
[SPEAKER_13]: So at this point, I'm going to let Roberta speak a little bit about the first of the housing assistance programs we'll be discussing tonight.

36
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,170
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Alex.

37
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,631
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm just going to give a little bit of a background.

38
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:27,432
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm also a member of Housing Medford, and I'm a member of Medford's Community Preservation Committee.

39
00:03:27,452 --> 00:03:36,495
[SPEAKER_18]: The Community Preservation Committee oversees how the city utilizes funds that it receives through property taxes.

40
00:03:38,516 --> 00:03:41,879
[SPEAKER_18]: that can be used for affordable housing.

41
00:03:42,639 --> 00:04:01,196
[SPEAKER_18]: And we have just committed a large amount of funds to enable us to create an emergency rental assistance program with the assistance of ABCD, who is administering this program for the city, as well as funding for Housing Families, Inc.

42
00:04:01,657 --> 00:04:06,559
[SPEAKER_18]: who can also provide some emergency rental assistance for Medford residents.

43
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:26,027
[SPEAKER_18]: So we wanted both the Community Preservation Committee and Housing Medford to have this meeting so that we could share with people what housing resources are available to Medford residents, both in terms of emergency assistance and more long-term assistance.

44
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:30,449
[SPEAKER_18]: So the first resource that we have is the City of Medford.

45
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:40,434
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I'd like to pass the baton to the Office of Community Development, which has resources and programs available.

46
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:42,995
[SPEAKER_18]: So let me pass the baton to Alicia Hunt.

47
00:04:44,356 --> 00:04:46,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I mostly wanted to say hello.

48
00:04:46,217 --> 00:04:50,059
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the Acting Director of Community Development for the City of Medford.

49
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:56,182
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that we do within our office is resources around affordable housing.

50
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Two of our staff are going to speak.

51
00:04:59,641 --> 00:05:05,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Danielle Evans will mention about the affordable housing production plan the office is working on right now.

52
00:05:06,524 --> 00:05:15,028
[SPEAKER_04]: And Lorena Escalero will speak about the resources we can direct people to.

53
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:20,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Lorena has been having some trouble with her internet, but I think she's able to speak now.

54
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Lorena?

55
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:24,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

56
00:05:25,603 --> 00:05:26,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, she's sorry.

57
00:05:31,445 --> 00:05:41,068
[SPEAKER_04]: So Lorena answers the phone at the Office of Community Development, and if you can hear us, you can jump in.

58
00:05:42,788 --> 00:05:49,430
[SPEAKER_04]: She gets calls and redirects them to all sorts of needs, including first-time homebuyers.

59
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:54,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, she wants to know, will the meeting end if she leaves at 8?

60
00:05:58,248 --> 00:06:05,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, she is actually the official host of the call this evening, and she's concerned about accidentally disconnecting all of us.

61
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:25,393
[SPEAKER_04]: So she gets calls around first-time homebuyer resources, legal counseling services, eviction prevention services, housing lottery, affordable housing opportunities, transitional resources, shelter services, and rental assistance resources.

62
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:40,747
[SPEAKER_04]: And she can speak to people in English, Spanish, and Italian about those things, and then direct them to the various service providers that Medford contracts with to provide assistance in all of those areas.

63
00:06:41,788 --> 00:06:42,708
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's Lorena.

64
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:44,329
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you able to speak, Lorena?

65
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, I'm able to speak.

66
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:46,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry about that.

67
00:06:46,811 --> 00:06:47,572
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm back now.

68
00:06:48,532 --> 00:06:48,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

69
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:54,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to say hello and introduce what you do?

70
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:56,900
[SPEAKER_07]: In English?

71
00:06:58,962 --> 00:06:59,803
[SPEAKER_04]: I did it in English.

72
00:06:59,823 --> 00:07:01,003
[SPEAKER_04]: You could do it in Spanish.

73
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:02,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

74
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:03,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Hola a todos.

75
00:07:03,385 --> 00:07:09,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Mi nombre es Lorena Scolero y trabajo para la oficina de desarrollo comunitario en Medford.

76
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:21,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Esta reunión será en inglés, pero la ciudad está trabajando para obtener esta información en otro idioma.

77
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:22,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Si tiene

78
00:07:22,983 --> 00:07:23,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Lorena.

79
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:30,824
[SPEAKER_07]: And Danielle, do you want to just mention about the housing production plan that the office is working on?

80
00:07:30,864 --> 00:07:31,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

81
00:07:31,104 --> 00:07:31,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

82
00:07:51,666 --> 00:08:00,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Our office is working on the housing production plan with a team of consultants and right now we're trying to collect public input.

83
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:11,912
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of the ways you can do that is to complete the survey and you can find that on our website on the OCD's website and it's completely anonymous so you don't have to worry about

84
00:08:12,582 --> 00:08:16,184
[SPEAKER_05]: those, any of your questions being traced back to you.

85
00:08:16,744 --> 00:08:20,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, there's going to be a interactive webinar on June 4.

86
00:08:21,406 --> 00:08:23,987
[SPEAKER_05]: That's at 6.30pm.

87
00:08:24,007 --> 00:08:25,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

88
00:08:26,028 --> 00:08:27,629
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that'll be about two hours.

89
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:31,630
[SPEAKER_05]: The first hour will be interactive presentation and followed by Q&A.

90
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:39,974
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you can't make it that will also be recorded and will be available on the Medford Community Media website.

91
00:08:41,142 --> 00:08:48,688
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can also sign up for a list to, for our email list if you want to stay updated on the process.

92
00:08:49,308 --> 00:08:53,111
[SPEAKER_05]: And I realized that I don't think I even explained what the housing production plan is.

93
00:08:53,691 --> 00:09:10,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically that is to look at the housing needs in Medford and basically to evaluate that and to come up with thoughtful ways that we can get to our 10% affordability.

94
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:15,464
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not at that in Medford, as you're probably aware.

95
00:09:16,485 --> 00:09:22,349
[SPEAKER_05]: And so our consultants will be looking at various ways that we can achieve that.

96
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:26,932
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

97
00:09:26,992 --> 00:09:27,712
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, Danielle.

98
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:36,278
[SPEAKER_13]: And before we move to, you know, the different organizations discussing their housing assistance programs, I just want to allow Neil Osborne to introduce himself as well.

99
00:09:37,739 --> 00:09:38,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, everyone.

100
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,741
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Neil Osborne.

101
00:09:41,423 --> 00:09:44,904
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been with the city almost three years now.

102
00:09:45,824 --> 00:09:51,445
[SPEAKER_00]: I started as the city's diversity and inclusion director with the prior administration.

103
00:09:52,446 --> 00:10:01,908
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I came on, I was given a great deal of freedom to work in the community on areas of diversity, inclusion, and equity.

104
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:10,730
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that meant was I could actually become embedded with different organizations to make sure that they knew

105
00:10:11,435 --> 00:10:19,237
[SPEAKER_00]: the city found it very important that we are a diverse community and they are important to the administration.

106
00:10:20,257 --> 00:10:25,459
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that there's a new administration, that freedom has not been curtailed at all.

107
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:33,721
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this role of diversity and inclusion, I knew how important affordable housing is to a community.

108
00:10:34,421 --> 00:10:40,503
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Medford isn't unique in our geographical area, but it was important that

109
00:10:42,286 --> 00:10:50,572
[SPEAKER_00]: as a part of the administration, that we take a strong stance to begin to try and solve that problem.

110
00:10:50,973 --> 00:11:01,280
[SPEAKER_00]: Because unless we are thinking about where people can live and who those people will be, we can't have the growth that the city needs.

111
00:11:02,081 --> 00:11:06,284
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that sort of mandate or mission,

112
00:11:07,761 --> 00:11:20,971
[SPEAKER_00]: being a member of Medford Health Matters, an organization that's been around for about 25 years, their goal was healthy living opportunities in Medford.

113
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:30,417
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a program of a big table where different nonprofits would come together to discuss like-minded issues.

114
00:11:31,018 --> 00:11:36,662
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple of years ago, we had a big table session just about affordable housing.

115
00:11:37,636 --> 00:11:54,003
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of that big table session on affordable housing, we began to embark on creating residents with that interest coming together, which blossomed into what we are now, Housing Medford.

116
00:11:54,303 --> 00:12:03,147
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take pride in the fact that I have the freedom to be embedded in different organizations that help build strong communities.

117
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:05,488
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a long-winded way of saying,

118
00:12:06,132 --> 00:12:08,113
[SPEAKER_00]: The city knows this is important.

119
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,956
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also important that residents become participants.

120
00:12:12,877 --> 00:12:22,283
[SPEAKER_00]: The housing production plan is a wonderful way for residents to have a say about what our affordable housing plan will look like.

121
00:12:22,343 --> 00:12:31,569
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage folks to go to the city website, and we're also gonna try to hopefully make that in a paper form, but there are opportunities abound.

122
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:35,632
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have interest in affordable housing, there are opportunities.

123
00:12:36,462 --> 00:12:38,844
[SPEAKER_00]: in Housing Medford and other organizations to participate.

124
00:12:38,864 --> 00:12:44,548
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my long-winded, how I am related to this process as it goes forward.

125
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,571
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much, Neil.

126
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:54,596
[SPEAKER_13]: Your involvement in Housing Medford is very much appreciated and we value your presence there all the time.

127
00:12:55,376 --> 00:13:02,702
[SPEAKER_13]: So now I'll turn to the organizations who are actually providing this rental assistance or administering it more directly.

128
00:13:03,602 --> 00:13:06,003
[SPEAKER_13]: to explain a little bit about their programs, what they do.

129
00:13:06,023 --> 00:13:10,704
[SPEAKER_13]: So I want to start with ABCD, if you could just talk a little bit about your program.

130
00:13:15,445 --> 00:13:15,765
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

131
00:13:16,605 --> 00:13:23,186
[SPEAKER_11]: So my name is Josh Young and I'm the director of field operations for ABCD.

132
00:13:23,206 --> 00:13:24,266
[SPEAKER_11]: We are

133
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:41,902
[SPEAKER_11]: ecstatic to be working with the city of Medford as well as the Medford Housing Coalition and the CPC on providing, doing the administrative work on behalf of the city for the emergency rental assistance.

134
00:13:43,564 --> 00:13:48,228
[SPEAKER_11]: In addition to that, for housing, we do housing counseling work.

135
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:54,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, as, uh, working with the folks who call our offices about their housing options.

136
00:13:55,421 --> 00:14:09,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, we also work with folks who are about to become, um, homeless or, or evicted from their unit into, um, finding either temporary housing or, um, becoming, um, uh, being able to access shelter.

137
00:14:09,744 --> 00:14:15,705
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we also, uh, run the mobile homeless outreach team, um, for Malden, Medford and Everett.

138
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:26,080
[SPEAKER_11]: I should say that ABCD is the Community Action Agency or the anti-poverty agency serving Malden, Medford and Everett.

139
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:34,863
[SPEAKER_11]: So in addition to the housing services that I mentioned, we run a number of programs

140
00:14:35,835 --> 00:14:50,604
[SPEAKER_11]: that help to get individuals and families out of poverty into a stable economic situation and then work with them to prosper into a better household income.

141
00:14:51,424 --> 00:15:00,849
[SPEAKER_11]: So among other things, we run the Head Start, the federal preschool for three and four year olds from Malden, Medford, and Everett.

142
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:05,032
[SPEAKER_11]: We also run the fuel assistance

143
00:15:06,182 --> 00:15:19,649
[SPEAKER_11]: department of serving Malden, Medford, and Everett, where folks can call our offices and apply for discounts on their oil, electric, and gas heat.

144
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:35,156
[SPEAKER_11]: Once they qualify for fuel assistance, they're also eligible for weatherization services, where we're able to come into either the apartment or into the household and make

145
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:41,353
[SPEAKER_11]: changes to windows and the attic blowing in insulation.

146
00:15:42,554 --> 00:15:51,639
[SPEAKER_11]: And in certain cases, we're able to replace appliances such as a refrigerator or a boiler that are grossly under efficient.

147
00:15:53,501 --> 00:16:03,507
[SPEAKER_11]: By also applying for fuel assistance, folks are eligible for the utility discount, which means that if they, for instance, get

148
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:09,285
[SPEAKER_11]: a discount on their oil, they're also eligible for a discount rate on their electricity.

149
00:16:10,626 --> 00:16:33,420
[SPEAKER_11]: We also run the foster grandparents program for the area, which is the grandparent literacy program, where we work with seniors who volunteer in public schools and in childcare, where we help children with their literacy.

150
00:16:35,377 --> 00:16:47,440
[SPEAKER_11]: And then out of our Mystic Valley case management site in Malden, we provide such things as computer literacy training.

151
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:50,601
[SPEAKER_11]: We do general case management.

152
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:54,462
[SPEAKER_11]: We have immigration and citizenship services.

153
00:16:55,642 --> 00:17:00,006
[SPEAKER_11]: job search assistance, where we also work with folks on their resumes.

154
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:05,110
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we can do emergency provision of services as well.

155
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:12,997
[SPEAKER_11]: So we can help folks if they need access to diapers or if they need access to clothing or furniture.

156
00:17:13,017 --> 00:17:22,165
[SPEAKER_11]: So those are some of the programs that we run for the Malden, Medford, and Everett area.

157
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:41,615
[SPEAKER_11]: The one thing I did want to mention for the summer, which is, you know, we're in this situation where it's a little unclear on whether we're going to be able to have a youth program this summer that's more virtual or more real.

158
00:17:42,676 --> 00:17:50,478
[SPEAKER_11]: But either way, we'll be providing a program for youth through our Youth Engaged in Action program

159
00:17:51,533 --> 00:18:10,078
[SPEAKER_11]: serving 13-year-olds as well as older youth to be able to have a little bit of a stipend for doing work in the community, mostly through nonprofits and government agencies.

160
00:18:10,698 --> 00:18:20,060
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, we're not quite sure whether that's going to be through the computer or whether it's going to be real, but otherwise, we will have a program for you this summer.

161
00:18:23,572 --> 00:18:23,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

162
00:18:24,112 --> 00:18:29,913
[SPEAKER_13]: And then from Metro Housing Boston, would you mind discussing your housing assistance programs?

163
00:18:35,775 --> 00:18:36,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

164
00:18:36,335 --> 00:18:37,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, everyone.

165
00:18:37,295 --> 00:18:38,915
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Lydia McCoy.

166
00:18:38,935 --> 00:18:42,116
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm with the RAFT program.

167
00:18:42,176 --> 00:18:45,377
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually the RAFT program manager at Metro Housing Boston.

168
00:18:46,197 --> 00:18:50,478
[SPEAKER_09]: The RAFT program is Residential Assistance for Families and Transition.

169
00:18:51,498 --> 00:19:00,346
[SPEAKER_09]: We offer financial assistance for families who are facing a sort of housing crisis that could wind that could lead to homelessness.

170
00:19:01,386 --> 00:19:10,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the types of financial assistance we provide is assistance for startup if people are doubled up or severely overcrowded.

171
00:19:10,114 --> 00:19:16,099
[SPEAKER_09]: We provide financial assistance for arrears, whether it be rental arrears or mortgage arrears.

172
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:27,744
[SPEAKER_09]: utility assistance and we provide a variety of assistance if it is going to benefit the family and being able to keep their housing.

173
00:19:28,745 --> 00:19:42,871
[SPEAKER_09]: We do provide stipends for folks who might not be in the rears yet but due to COVID-19 are experiencing a loss of income which leads them to be 30 to 50 percent AMI.

174
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:57,661
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a variety of other housing services at Metro Housing Boston, one of which is the co-locations program.

175
00:19:58,081 --> 00:20:01,802
[SPEAKER_09]: So I do know that Jason, the co-locations program manager, is on the call.

176
00:20:01,822 --> 00:20:03,583
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if he wants to elaborate on that.

177
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:06,203
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, can everybody hear me?

178
00:20:08,024 --> 00:20:08,284
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello?

179
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:09,024
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

180
00:20:09,404 --> 00:20:09,624
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

181
00:20:10,684 --> 00:20:11,464
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, perfect.

182
00:20:12,285 --> 00:20:13,545
[SPEAKER_15]: So my name is Jason Malenciano.

183
00:20:14,108 --> 00:20:19,272
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm the manager for the co-location department at Metro Boston Housing, as Lydia has stated.

184
00:20:20,473 --> 00:20:41,070
[SPEAKER_15]: What my department does is we place case managers in different communities, such as Medford, in order to process RAPT applications for those who are looking for arrears with first, I mean, I'm sorry, for rent, looking for first and security to move, utility arrears and anything of the sort.

185
00:20:41,754 --> 00:20:48,197
[SPEAKER_15]: So my team comes along and is going to be kind of the streamline process for residents of Medford.

186
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:54,581
[SPEAKER_13]: Great, thank you.

187
00:20:54,681 --> 00:20:58,103
[SPEAKER_13]: And I wanted to ask one thing, Lydia, you used the term AMI.

188
00:20:58,243 --> 00:21:03,806
[SPEAKER_13]: Would you mind just defining and explaining that a little bit for anyone who's listening and who might not be familiar?

189
00:21:03,826 --> 00:21:06,087
[SPEAKER_13]: It may come up again during this info session.

190
00:21:16,493 --> 00:21:18,195
[SPEAKER_18]: Lydia, are you able to hear me?

191
00:21:18,856 --> 00:21:19,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

192
00:21:19,537 --> 00:21:20,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, I'm here.

193
00:21:20,478 --> 00:21:20,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

194
00:21:20,938 --> 00:21:22,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, sure.

195
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:24,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me just pull up the chart.

196
00:21:25,043 --> 00:21:26,705
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have it memorized.

197
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,669
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually have it on the screen, Lydia.

198
00:21:32,212 --> 00:21:32,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, OK.

199
00:21:32,772 --> 00:21:34,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I see it now.

200
00:21:35,015 --> 00:21:35,756
[SPEAKER_09]: So as you can see,

201
00:21:37,384 --> 00:21:52,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me, if a family or individual is meeting 50% AMI or below, they would be eligible if their housing crisis fits one of our criterias for raft assistance.

202
00:21:57,981 --> 00:22:00,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that answer the question or did you want me to elaborate?

203
00:22:01,617 --> 00:22:09,849
[SPEAKER_13]: More basically, I think just area AMI stands for area median income, just in case anyone isn't familiar with that term.

204
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:12,573
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, yes.

205
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:35,420
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to jump in to add that for households who meet the criteria of being under 80% area median income, the program, the emergency rental assistance program offered by ABCD is able to help these families, these households.

206
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:44,702
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have emergency rental assistance that's available to people at all of these income ranges.

207
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:48,585
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.

208
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:49,026
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

209
00:22:50,027 --> 00:22:57,613
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the Wood Housing Families, would you mind just discussing a little bit about your housing assistance program and what you do?

210
00:22:59,474 --> 00:23:00,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, everyone.

211
00:23:00,055 --> 00:23:01,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for having me.

212
00:23:01,696 --> 00:23:02,977
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Jaina Stafford.

213
00:23:03,078 --> 00:23:08,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the Director of Legal Services and Homelessness Prevention at Housing Families.

214
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:15,339
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the only legal services program located in the Tri-Cities and our program has been in place since 1991.

215
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,923
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've been serving the Tri-Cities for a long time.

216
00:23:20,944 --> 00:23:25,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Primarily, we handle eviction defense cases and any kind of

217
00:23:26,129 --> 00:23:27,651
[SPEAKER_06]: housing related matters.

218
00:23:28,652 --> 00:23:44,926
[SPEAKER_06]: So we offer brief advice, representation, advocacy, lots of referrals, and also direct financial assistance when we have that available, which we do through our partnership now with the city of Medford and also through the housing families

219
00:23:45,936 --> 00:23:46,576
[SPEAKER_06]: HFI fund.

220
00:23:47,237 --> 00:23:54,183
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're able to work with residents who may be having kind of a complicated matter going on.

221
00:23:54,303 --> 00:23:56,325
[SPEAKER_06]: So they might be having a problem with their landlord.

222
00:23:56,345 --> 00:23:58,087
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not sure how to proceed.

223
00:23:58,107 --> 00:24:01,270
[SPEAKER_06]: They're concerned about what's going to happen when the moratorium ends.

224
00:24:02,302 --> 00:24:09,486
[SPEAKER_06]: We can offer advice and some direct financial assistance, of course, on a case-by-case basis for any of those situations.

225
00:24:10,246 --> 00:24:23,413
[SPEAKER_06]: We have our contact information there at the bottom of the screen, and that is our intake line, which we monitor daily, and you will have to leave a message at this time because we're working remotely, but we're fully up and functioning.

226
00:24:25,082 --> 00:24:28,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Housing Families has a number of other programs.

227
00:24:28,344 --> 00:24:34,507
[SPEAKER_06]: We have shelter units, we have leased housing, we have our Great Youth and Family Program, which is running a food bank now.

228
00:24:34,527 --> 00:24:41,931
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a lot of things that can connect together in our quest to end family homelessness.

229
00:24:42,851 --> 00:24:43,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

230
00:24:43,352 --> 00:24:46,173
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Jayna.

231
00:24:46,353 --> 00:24:49,255
[SPEAKER_13]: There are a couple other organizations that

232
00:24:50,658 --> 00:24:56,943
[SPEAKER_13]: may not provide the type of emergency housing assistance necessarily, but are still existing as housing resources in this area.

233
00:24:57,984 --> 00:25:02,267
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there someone from the Medford Housing Authority here with us tonight?

234
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:03,048
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

235
00:25:03,148 --> 00:25:08,912
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, I'm Barbara Fleming, and I'm the Director of Resident Services at the Medford Housing Authority.

236
00:25:08,932 --> 00:25:09,592
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you hear me?

237
00:25:10,293 --> 00:25:10,974
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, we can.

238
00:25:11,014 --> 00:25:11,354
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

239
00:25:11,374 --> 00:25:11,774
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, great.

240
00:25:12,395 --> 00:25:12,655
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

241
00:25:13,295 --> 00:25:19,280
[SPEAKER_16]: I can give you a brief outline of the Medford Housing Authority and its programs.

242
00:25:20,423 --> 00:25:22,184
[SPEAKER_16]: We do have two programs.

243
00:25:22,284 --> 00:25:28,585
[SPEAKER_16]: We have the public housing program and we have the leased housing program.

244
00:25:29,465 --> 00:25:35,827
[SPEAKER_16]: The public housing program are the buildings that we operate and own.

245
00:25:36,807 --> 00:25:48,750
[SPEAKER_16]: The leased housing programs are the, there are two and we have vouchers that we can give to quote individuals and families who qualify and

246
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:56,239
[SPEAKER_16]: you would find your own unit, and then you would have your rent.

247
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:04,806
[SPEAKER_16]: Basically, your rent would be almost the same as if you lived in one of our units that we own.

248
00:26:07,167 --> 00:26:10,170
[SPEAKER_16]: We have right now a total of

249
00:26:11,525 --> 00:26:15,646
[SPEAKER_16]: We have 550 elderly units that we own.

250
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:19,526
[SPEAKER_16]: We have 290 family units in Medford.

251
00:26:20,386 --> 00:26:28,668
[SPEAKER_16]: We have 987 Section 8 vouchers, which is the federal voucher program.

252
00:26:29,328 --> 00:26:34,789
[SPEAKER_16]: And we have 18 MRVP vouchers, which is the state voucher program.

253
00:26:36,249 --> 00:26:38,169
[SPEAKER_16]: We do have lengthy waiting lists.

254
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:49,474
[SPEAKER_16]: I can give a review on what waiting lists are open presently and closed.

255
00:26:49,494 --> 00:26:52,416
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you can just stay with me for a moment.

256
00:27:00,381 --> 00:27:03,343
[SPEAKER_16]: And you would think I would have this right in front of me.

257
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:06,965
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so let me try and just say this from the top of my head here.

258
00:27:11,778 --> 00:27:17,379
[SPEAKER_16]: one, two, three, and four bedroom units in our family housing developments.

259
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:22,860
[SPEAKER_16]: Our family housing developments are federally funded.

260
00:27:24,181 --> 00:27:26,821
[SPEAKER_16]: That list right now is closed.

261
00:27:26,921 --> 00:27:33,202
[SPEAKER_16]: We do anticipate opening it shortly, but at the moment it is closed and we are not taking applications.

262
00:27:34,623 --> 00:27:41,104
[SPEAKER_16]: For our elderly federal developments, that list as well is closed.

263
00:27:41,978 --> 00:27:45,221
[SPEAKER_16]: But we do, again, anticipate opening that soon.

264
00:27:45,261 --> 00:27:53,629
[SPEAKER_16]: In fact, we were planning to do that, I believe, shortly before the COVID-19 crisis began.

265
00:27:56,031 --> 00:28:03,399
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a state elderly development, elderly disabled development, which has 143 units.

266
00:28:03,459 --> 00:28:03,959
[SPEAKER_16]: That list is open.

267
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:11,848
[SPEAKER_16]: The section eight list is open.

268
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:18,492
[SPEAKER_16]: One can apply for the section eight program and one can apply for the state MRVP voucher program.

269
00:28:19,893 --> 00:28:26,656
[SPEAKER_16]: I would invite anyone who is interested in getting more details about this to call me at the Medford Housing Authority.

270
00:28:26,816 --> 00:28:27,657
[SPEAKER_16]: And my number is 781-396-7200.

271
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:40,713
[SPEAKER_16]: And at this time, our answering service is taking all calls.

272
00:28:40,813 --> 00:28:50,057
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would ask that you just ask for Barbara Fleming and your message would be your name and it's regarding applying for housing.

273
00:28:50,157 --> 00:28:58,160
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I would know that you are interested in talking about applying for any one of our programs.

274
00:29:00,101 --> 00:29:03,462
[SPEAKER_16]: Everyone who applies has different questions for us.

275
00:29:04,563 --> 00:29:16,147
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would be more than happy to discuss the possibilities of your applying and the length of time that you anticipate waiting.

276
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:18,648
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a question we frequently get.

277
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:30,552
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think at the moment, that covers just a brief outline of the programs that we have.

278
00:29:34,322 --> 00:29:34,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, Barbara.

279
00:29:34,883 --> 00:29:35,583
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really helpful.

280
00:29:36,745 --> 00:29:38,446
[SPEAKER_13]: There's just three other organizations.

281
00:29:38,467 --> 00:29:48,017
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe I don't know if we have someone here, but Roberta or someone else to briefly describe heading home, the city assessors programs or Medford community housing.

282
00:29:49,615 --> 00:29:51,136
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, sure.

283
00:29:51,156 --> 00:30:05,862
[SPEAKER_18]: So, um, we have a few nonprofit organizations who provide different types of affordable housing services or they own affordable housing units in the city of Medford.

284
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:11,324
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of those include heading home and Medford community housing.

285
00:30:12,284 --> 00:30:19,648
[SPEAKER_18]: And I believe there are some other organizations as well, but these are some of the ones that exist here.

286
00:30:19,668 --> 00:30:39,477
[SPEAKER_18]: And Medford Community Housing, in addition to owning some rental units and potentially developing some additional rental units of affordable housing, they also provide education for homeownership.

287
00:30:41,156 --> 00:30:47,119
[SPEAKER_18]: And I had seen, yeah.

288
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,580
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

289
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,142
[SPEAKER_04]: They just announced a first time homeowner's workshop that they're gonna be running.

290
00:30:54,362 --> 00:30:57,364
[SPEAKER_04]: It costs $65 to participate.

291
00:30:58,344 --> 00:31:05,948
[SPEAKER_04]: And since we don't have the exact information available at the moment, I would say that if you've contacted the Office of Community Development,

292
00:31:06,358 --> 00:31:12,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll make sure that Lorena has the information about the first time homeowners workshop and she can share it with you.

293
00:31:13,222 --> 00:31:13,602
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

294
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:24,828
[SPEAKER_18]: And one other really important resource that we have is to assist people who have difficulty paying their property taxes.

295
00:31:25,568 --> 00:31:30,891
[SPEAKER_18]: The city's assessor has some ability to help

296
00:31:32,372 --> 00:31:40,358
[SPEAKER_18]: property owners, low-income property owners, in particular low-income seniors, to be able to lower their tax bills.

297
00:31:40,838 --> 00:31:54,768
[SPEAKER_18]: So contacting the city's assessing department can enable you to speak with someone in the assessing department who can see whether you are eligible for programs that would enable you to lower your tax bill.

298
00:31:58,227 --> 00:32:03,752
[SPEAKER_18]: And I believe that concludes the additional organizations and resources.

299
00:32:04,492 --> 00:32:08,656
[SPEAKER_18]: There are more resources listed on the Office of Community Development's website.

300
00:32:09,316 --> 00:32:14,860
[SPEAKER_18]: So people should look to see what the city has available.

301
00:32:17,342 --> 00:32:23,207
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I might, the best way to find it easily is if you go to the Medford website, medfordma.org,

302
00:32:25,332 --> 00:32:29,455
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now you can click on the big thing that says coronavirus information.

303
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:35,760
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there are a bunch of boxes and one of them is housing.

304
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,682
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can click on that and there's a long list.

305
00:32:38,902 --> 00:32:43,725
[SPEAKER_04]: All the contact information that we shared tonight is on there and there's additional information.

306
00:32:47,288 --> 00:32:47,928
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, Alicia.

307
00:32:48,088 --> 00:32:52,652
[SPEAKER_13]: So now I think it's time to turn to the

308
00:32:54,040 --> 00:33:04,903
[SPEAKER_13]: the question and answer portion, so we'll start just with a couple of basic questions that I'm sure everyone would have and showing on the screen right now.

309
00:33:04,943 --> 00:33:09,365
[SPEAKER_13]: If you do have a comment or a question, there's a few different ways that you can put that out.

310
00:33:09,865 --> 00:33:12,525
[SPEAKER_13]: One is to use the raise hand function in Zoom.

311
00:33:12,545 --> 00:33:20,988
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're logged in on Zoom and we have someone who's monitoring those and can get you in line to have your question answered, you can type your question into the chat box

312
00:33:22,005 --> 00:33:28,691
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're calling from a phone, you can just press star nine to raise your hand again and get in that that queue.

313
00:33:29,072 --> 00:33:37,699
[SPEAKER_13]: Or if you'd rather you can send an email to housing Medford at gmail.com that will go to housing Medford email and we can put that question in as well.

314
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,042
[SPEAKER_13]: So the first question that I just want to start out with.

315
00:33:42,764 --> 00:33:51,111
[SPEAKER_13]: is to a question that I'm sure is on everyone's mind with the COVID-19 pandemic affecting people's incomes and everything.

316
00:33:52,412 --> 00:33:55,695
[SPEAKER_13]: Say I want to apply for rental assistance in Medford.

317
00:33:56,015 --> 00:34:00,799
[SPEAKER_13]: How can I apply for rental assistance if I'm having trouble paying my rent?

318
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,941
[SPEAKER_13]: I think OCD was going to start addressing that one.

319
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:12,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so rental assistance calls normally go to

320
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:20,873
[SPEAKER_07]: ABCD Malden right now because we have more generic eligibility requirements or just a start.

321
00:34:21,533 --> 00:34:37,860
[SPEAKER_07]: So last week we were having some issues with ABCD answering calls, but we are recommending for them if they cannot reach anyone over the phone to leave a voicemail or email.

322
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:44,143
[SPEAKER_07]: ABCD email which is housing at Boston ABCD.org.

323
00:34:54,132 --> 00:35:04,461
[SPEAKER_13]: Great so of course one of the first things you can do is just to go to the city website, call OCD if you're having trouble and they'll refer you depending on what your particular situation is to

324
00:35:05,741 --> 00:35:13,569
[SPEAKER_13]: to ABCD or to MHB and then kind of get you into the right place.

325
00:35:13,649 --> 00:35:20,616
[SPEAKER_13]: So maybe if ABCD, if you could talk about what applying for rental assistance looks like at your organization.

326
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,480
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure.

327
00:35:25,801 --> 00:35:26,561
[SPEAKER_11]: So they should,

328
00:35:27,977 --> 00:35:31,858
[SPEAKER_11]: As was said, they should leave us a message on the machine.

329
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:38,160
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have returned all our phone calls and we'll continue to do so.

330
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:44,622
[SPEAKER_11]: We are working with folks over the phone.

331
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:47,563
[SPEAKER_11]: They should feel free to obviously email us as well.

332
00:35:48,144 --> 00:35:50,865
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll have a case manager call them back.

333
00:35:53,029 --> 00:35:59,134
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just posted in chat, I forgot to mention that we also are able to work with clients in several different languages.

334
00:36:00,795 --> 00:36:13,405
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, the best thing is just to leave a message, either on the phone line or send an email and we will have someone return a phone call in an appropriate language.

335
00:36:16,447 --> 00:36:22,372
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any special requirements for people who are applying for rental assistance to meet to maybe receive that?

336
00:36:25,962 --> 00:36:45,337
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not in the housing realm, so I'm not as well versed on what the income requirements are, but obviously having documentation is always helpful because we'll ask for folks proof of income and proof of their lease.

337
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:51,756
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, any supporting documentation that they have on hand is always helpful.

338
00:36:52,137 --> 00:37:00,825
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, one of our case managers will call them and work with them on what kind of documentation that they should put together.

339
00:37:04,742 --> 00:37:33,521
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the questions that we've gotten periodically is, do people have to have, when you look at their income, are you looking at their income, and I guess this is for all the programs, but particularly the emergency housing, for say last year, last year's taxes, or if somebody's income situation is significantly different because of the health emergency, would you look at just their income today under

340
00:37:34,028 --> 00:37:35,209
[SPEAKER_04]: for the past month or two?

341
00:37:38,411 --> 00:37:41,173
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know that I can answer that question.

342
00:37:41,633 --> 00:37:48,078
[SPEAKER_11]: But I can tell you just as a general rule, we look at folks' income at the immediate moment.

343
00:37:48,578 --> 00:37:52,061
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't look at them from the past year's taxes.

344
00:37:53,442 --> 00:37:58,685
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's uniform across Head Start, fuel assistance, housing.

345
00:38:01,895 --> 00:38:07,017
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that's, as a general rule, how we approach our determination of eligibility.

346
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:14,299
[SPEAKER_16]: I can hop in from the Housing Authority.

347
00:38:15,439 --> 00:38:24,042
[SPEAKER_16]: And I can say that it would be the income that one is currently earning that we would be looking at.

348
00:38:24,082 --> 00:38:25,622
[SPEAKER_16]: It would be the gross income.

349
00:38:25,642 --> 00:38:29,743
[SPEAKER_16]: And when one signs up

350
00:38:31,906 --> 00:38:36,530
[SPEAKER_16]: for housing with the medford housing authority or family signs up for housing.

351
00:38:37,871 --> 00:38:59,289
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe on the section 8 waiting list, they do have to put their income that they are presently making and we accept 30, depending upon the family size, and I believe you saw the chart up on the board, we accept people who are at 30% of the

352
00:39:01,893 --> 00:39:07,356
[SPEAKER_16]: AMI on both the Section A program and the public housing program.

353
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:13,400
[SPEAKER_16]: So I hope that clarifies or is a bit helpful.

354
00:39:14,861 --> 00:39:15,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

355
00:39:15,441 --> 00:39:16,662
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very helpful.

356
00:39:16,902 --> 00:39:30,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there are a lot of people today who are concerned that they maybe were making good money, but now they don't have a job, they don't have savings, they don't have income, and they don't see how they're going, where they're going to get a job in the future.

357
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:32,430
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

358
00:39:33,711 --> 00:39:35,012
[SPEAKER_18]: Does someone?

359
00:39:35,653 --> 00:39:36,614
[SPEAKER_18]: Go ahead.

360
00:39:37,254 --> 00:39:37,634
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

361
00:39:38,295 --> 00:39:40,977
[SPEAKER_15]: This is Jason from Metro Housing Boston.

362
00:39:41,477 --> 00:39:50,304
[SPEAKER_15]: In terms of eligibility for income for us, if clients, we generally take 30 days of income.

363
00:39:50,685 --> 00:39:58,651
[SPEAKER_15]: If at the current time they are not working due to COVID, they could write a self-declaration letter that states that they are not working.

364
00:39:58,711 --> 00:39:59,992
[SPEAKER_15]: What was their last date of work?

365
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:14,952
[SPEAKER_15]: And we will accept that if they cannot get anything from their employer at the time.

366
00:40:16,393 --> 00:40:22,218
[SPEAKER_13]: Do any other organizations want to say anything about what housing assistance?

367
00:40:22,278 --> 00:40:24,820
[SPEAKER_16]: This is Barbara from the Bedford Housing Authority.

368
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:29,084
[SPEAKER_16]: Once again, when I was talking earlier, I neglected to say that

369
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:38,746
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, we do have our accessible unit waiting list open for one, two, three, and four bedroom units that remains open.

370
00:40:40,427 --> 00:40:41,007
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Barbara.

371
00:40:42,288 --> 00:40:44,050
[SPEAKER_15]: You're welcome.

372
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:49,134
[SPEAKER_15]: I could speak a little bit about the Metro housing Boston application process if you'd like.

373
00:40:50,575 --> 00:40:50,995
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, please.

374
00:40:51,035 --> 00:40:51,255
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

375
00:40:53,797 --> 00:40:54,177
[SPEAKER_15]: Perfect.

376
00:40:54,738 --> 00:40:57,380
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, so generally when we receive a referral.

377
00:40:57,893 --> 00:41:06,476
[SPEAKER_15]: It takes three to five days for a case manager to respond due to the amount of applications that we're presently receiving.

378
00:41:07,156 --> 00:41:18,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Once we get the application, we contact the client and we do a on-the-phone interview for our four-page application that asks questions of demographic information,

379
00:41:19,069 --> 00:41:21,451
[SPEAKER_15]: name, family size, and what is the need.

380
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:28,174
[SPEAKER_15]: In order to be eligible for our application process, you do have to have a housing crisis.

381
00:41:28,635 --> 00:41:36,479
[SPEAKER_15]: And what that means is either you're living in a doubled up situation where you're living with someone else and may or may not be on their lease.

382
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:44,604
[SPEAKER_15]: You're being evicted by a landlord, even if the eviction, you may have just gotten the beginning of the eviction paperwork.

383
00:41:44,644 --> 00:41:45,445
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll accept that.

384
00:41:46,225 --> 00:41:47,766
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're homeless or on the street,

385
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:51,513
[SPEAKER_15]: or a few other eligibility criteria.

386
00:41:52,054 --> 00:42:02,183
[SPEAKER_15]: Once we understand what that is, we're going to go over the income, and this is where we assess up to 50% AMI, depending on the area and household composition.

387
00:42:02,644 --> 00:42:10,731
[SPEAKER_15]: At that point, we're asking for identifiable information, such as ID, Social Security cards, if you have one.

388
00:42:10,911 --> 00:42:11,792
[SPEAKER_15]: If not, we're also

389
00:42:13,207 --> 00:42:21,750
[SPEAKER_15]: helping undocumented families, income information, whether that's SSI or other employment information.

390
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:35,295
[SPEAKER_15]: And the way that we're getting that information, you can either scan it up to us via email, you could send pictures of it via email, or myself or the case manager could do a no contact

391
00:42:37,168 --> 00:42:43,250
[SPEAKER_15]: kind of visit where you would place it in the mailbox or maybe directly outside your home, and we would walk up and retrieve the information.

392
00:42:44,091 --> 00:42:49,532
[SPEAKER_15]: Once we have collected all of that information, it takes two to four weeks to process.

393
00:42:49,572 --> 00:42:57,155
[SPEAKER_15]: We will tell you eligibility right away, but because now, you know, we have to see the amount that you're eligible for.

394
00:42:57,615 --> 00:43:03,177
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to collect information from the property owner, such as W-9, which is their tax information.

395
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:09,532
[SPEAKER_15]: To prove that they're the actual owner, the process itself does take two to four weeks.

396
00:43:10,032 --> 00:43:22,495
[SPEAKER_15]: If you have a market rent apartment, which means you're paying regular rent, we will at that point or can give you a stipend of up to $4,000 if you're going to owe rent in the future.

397
00:43:23,415 --> 00:43:33,098
[SPEAKER_15]: However, if you have Section 8 or another type of subsidy, we cannot do a stipend, but we will pay any arrearages that you have or any utility arrearage that you have.

398
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:40,370
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, Jason.

399
00:43:41,511 --> 00:43:52,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Your description reminded me, I don't know, Josh from ABCD if you know the answer to this question, but are your programs available to folks regardless of their immigration status?

400
00:43:52,537 --> 00:43:58,861
[SPEAKER_13]: So if someone may be undocumented, are there ways to access rental assistance through ABCD?

401
00:44:04,904 --> 00:44:05,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, yes.

402
00:44:09,949 --> 00:44:13,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, so that's good to know, thank you.

403
00:44:15,132 --> 00:44:21,897
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, and is there anyone I'm forgetting on this question before?

404
00:44:21,917 --> 00:44:29,962
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so I think another question that would maybe come up is, oh, sorry.

405
00:44:33,085 --> 00:44:36,467
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, Talia, I'm gonna unmute you.

406
00:44:39,887 --> 00:44:41,829
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we'll go to the next question.

407
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:44,450
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.

408
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:50,835
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, so I'm in the midst of applying for the emergency rental grant from Medford.

409
00:44:51,315 --> 00:44:55,058
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I've been talking to the ABCD housing Councilor.

410
00:44:55,619 --> 00:45:04,905
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to understand, is there a piece of paper or an online form that Medford has made that describes eligibility?

411
00:45:04,925 --> 00:45:08,468
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I have a 17 page thing right now from ABCD

412
00:45:09,032 --> 00:45:19,835
[SPEAKER_17]: and all the forms are for giving information to Boston or Metro Housing and nothing talks about the Medford program or what counts as income or like, and I'm very confused.

413
00:45:19,895 --> 00:45:28,697
[SPEAKER_17]: And my related question, which is kind of for everyone, is like, for any of these programs, I am separated from my ex-husband.

414
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:30,038
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a kid.

415
00:45:30,698 --> 00:45:33,018
[SPEAKER_17]: He lives half time at my house and half time at the other house.

416
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:34,779
[SPEAKER_17]: We are not divorced.

417
00:45:35,373 --> 00:45:36,954
[SPEAKER_17]: We do not have a custody agreement.

418
00:45:39,476 --> 00:45:41,757
[SPEAKER_17]: We file our taxes married filing jointly.

419
00:45:41,777 --> 00:45:47,621
[SPEAKER_17]: So our income looks like we are three, but we really don't live together and haven't lived together for three years.

420
00:45:47,961 --> 00:45:52,344
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm not even sure how to like, is there, how do I prove how many people live here?

421
00:45:52,485 --> 00:45:55,046
[SPEAKER_17]: When I'm looking at a chart on some level, it doesn't matter.

422
00:45:55,086 --> 00:46:00,350
[SPEAKER_17]: Cause even all three of us, our income is low enough to qualify, but like he really pays income somewhere else.

423
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:01,571
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's not straightforward.

424
00:46:01,591 --> 00:46:01,951
[SPEAKER_17]: Like who,

425
00:46:02,548 --> 00:46:03,188
[SPEAKER_17]: has custody.

426
00:46:03,228 --> 00:46:05,629
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, are these programs designed to allow that situation?

427
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:09,790
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are my two questions.

428
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:10,551
[SPEAKER_15]: Is he on the lease?

429
00:46:14,672 --> 00:46:15,712
[SPEAKER_15]: The last question.

430
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:17,213
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, can we have the first one?

431
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:18,613
[SPEAKER_15]: Is he on the lease?

432
00:46:22,454 --> 00:46:23,615
[SPEAKER_17]: We moved in in 2006.

433
00:46:24,135 --> 00:46:24,995
[SPEAKER_17]: We both signed it.

434
00:46:25,055 --> 00:46:27,676
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a one-year lease, and I've been months and months since then.

435
00:46:33,132 --> 00:46:56,487
[SPEAKER_14]: so i don't know no and but it is so so so from so there is no lease so in terms of sorry this is jason from metro in terms of uh how we would look at the application we're going to go by who's currently on the lease or if the landlord could write a letter to state

436
00:46:56,984 --> 00:47:13,609
[SPEAKER_15]: that he is not on the lease or is there part-time, you would classify as a two-family home because if he's not on the lease, then we're not going to count him as part of the household composition, unless he's there full-time and you're making him a part of your application.

437
00:47:13,629 --> 00:47:16,370
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

438
00:47:17,511 --> 00:47:18,471
[SPEAKER_17]: He's never here.

439
00:47:18,491 --> 00:47:20,531
[SPEAKER_17]: He does not, he's never ever here.

440
00:47:20,812 --> 00:47:21,912
[SPEAKER_17]: He pays rent somewhere else.

441
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:27,872
[SPEAKER_17]: But I would need, so I would need proof of that from my landlord.

442
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:44,845
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so in terms, if your landlord could prove that he's not there, or if you could show us the month to month lease that states that he's no longer there, then we could prove that, then we could move forward on your application.

443
00:47:45,646 --> 00:47:45,906
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

444
00:47:47,908 --> 00:47:49,109
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, got it.

445
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:52,672
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's gonna be challenging, okay.

446
00:47:54,557 --> 00:47:59,622
[SPEAKER_15]: And you wouldn't name him on the application.

447
00:48:03,705 --> 00:48:03,986
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

448
00:48:05,487 --> 00:48:12,073
[SPEAKER_17]: And then separate from that, back to is, is there, what are the Medford criteria for this emergency rental thing?

449
00:48:12,113 --> 00:48:18,979
[SPEAKER_17]: And is it really true that if I paid my rent in May, even though I couldn't afford it, I cannot get retroactive help because it's not in arrears.

450
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:39,476
[SPEAKER_18]: I can answer, we have, this is actually very feedback in that we've developed criteria for the Medford rental assistance, emergency rental assistance program.

451
00:48:40,456 --> 00:48:50,540
[SPEAKER_18]: And we can make sure that that's posted in a place where it can be accessible to people so that they know whether they meet the criteria.

452
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:56,164
[SPEAKER_18]: that has not yet been posted, but we will see that it is made available.

453
00:48:59,206 --> 00:49:03,809
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, not only is it not posted, like my housing Councilor from ABCD doesn't know the terms.

454
00:49:06,211 --> 00:49:08,733
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so that's good feedback.

455
00:49:08,773 --> 00:49:09,833
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll follow up.

456
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:10,574
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

457
00:49:10,874 --> 00:49:14,977
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll follow up to ensure that that information is made more available.

458
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:33,550
[SPEAKER_17]: And yeah, and the other really big question about that is the $600 a week federally, are you including as income the $600 a week of federal unemployment?

459
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:35,412
[SPEAKER_17]: Because some programs are and some programs are not.

460
00:49:42,723 --> 00:49:46,125
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, this is Barbara from the Minnesota Housing Authority.

461
00:49:46,205 --> 00:49:48,946
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to respond to your first question.

462
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:56,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, sorry.

463
00:49:56,570 --> 00:50:03,974
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is more about the... Barbara, do you want to go first?

464
00:50:04,274 --> 00:50:06,235
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

465
00:50:06,255 --> 00:50:06,675
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

466
00:50:06,755 --> 00:50:07,215
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

467
00:50:07,455 --> 00:50:10,477
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if you were listening to the call earlier when I was speaking.

468
00:50:12,622 --> 00:50:23,785
[SPEAKER_16]: Hearing your question, I would ask you just to call me and I will talk with the appropriate people at the Housing Authority and have them get back to you.

469
00:50:25,065 --> 00:50:32,127
[SPEAKER_16]: And in terms of the $600, the Housing Authority is not including that in its rents at this point.

470
00:50:36,168 --> 00:50:39,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, the ABCD told me they were for the Medford emergency.

471
00:50:44,637 --> 00:50:44,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

472
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,560
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I think there's some Internet issues happening.

473
00:50:57,781 --> 00:51:00,682
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe, Lydia, do you want to address the question?

474
00:51:00,702 --> 00:51:04,004
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, why don't you move on?

475
00:51:04,344 --> 00:51:08,165
[SPEAKER_13]: The $600, how you count income just from the RAFT point of view, and then we'll move on to the next question.

476
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:16,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, the RAF program does not consider the extra $600, I think that's the CARE Act provides.

477
00:51:18,446 --> 00:51:37,679
[SPEAKER_09]: We do consider other forms of income as far as unemployment goes, if you're getting it, any type of SSI, disability, any kind of cash assistance, TNF, any type of child support,

478
00:51:38,273 --> 00:51:44,361
[SPEAKER_09]: We do also count the expenses that you have for childcare.

479
00:51:44,381 --> 00:51:52,753
[SPEAKER_09]: So it shouldn't, receiving the $600 is not something that we consider as income.

480
00:51:59,068 --> 00:52:08,625
[SPEAKER_18]: And I am not sure that we have someone who can speak to the same for ABCD, but I believe that it will be the same information.

481
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:32,868
[SPEAKER_18]: But again, you probably have to speak with your Councilor to learn, but we will make sure that the guidelines are posted and are shared with ABCD so that they'll know who is eligible under Medford's Emergency Rental Assistance Program.

482
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:39,701
[SPEAKER_13]: And those will be posted on the city website, Roberta?

483
00:52:41,561 --> 00:52:44,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that right?

484
00:52:44,622 --> 00:52:46,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Or somewhere else?

485
00:52:46,662 --> 00:53:00,364
[SPEAKER_04]: The page that I was describing before, where if you go to the Medford website and you click on the COVID-19 information and then on housing,

486
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:06,712
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's a number of clicks, but there's a lot of.

487
00:53:06,752 --> 00:53:09,075
[SPEAKER_04]: You can click on business.

488
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:10,596
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually there.

489
00:53:10,696 --> 00:53:11,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Click.

490
00:53:12,438 --> 00:53:13,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Roberta, are you able to share it?

491
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:21,364
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought that I had it on the screen, but it's not.

492
00:53:21,544 --> 00:53:23,025
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me see if it's on.

493
00:53:23,805 --> 00:53:25,206
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I don't have that.

494
00:53:25,987 --> 00:53:35,713
[SPEAKER_18]: So the Medford City website, the homepage has COVID-19 information, and there's a housing link under the COVID-19 information.

495
00:53:36,113 --> 00:53:38,275
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's the easiest way to find it, I believe.

496
00:53:41,597 --> 00:53:44,699
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we can make a link to our

497
00:53:49,645 --> 00:53:53,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

498
00:53:53,267 --> 00:53:55,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I'm going to see if.

499
00:54:04,911 --> 00:54:07,653
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you want me to share it?

500
00:54:09,473 --> 00:54:10,274
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll share.

501
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:10,714
[SPEAKER_18]: Hold on.

502
00:54:14,656 --> 00:54:17,757
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to the city of Medford's website.

503
00:54:20,093 --> 00:54:24,056
[SPEAKER_18]: And there is coronavirus information.

504
00:54:27,698 --> 00:54:34,262
[SPEAKER_18]: And under the coronavirus information, there are a list of resources, and one of them is housing.

505
00:54:34,722 --> 00:54:41,907
[SPEAKER_04]: And while you're there, we should point out that the residents needing assistance, if you know of people who need help,

506
00:54:42,585 --> 00:54:50,667
[SPEAKER_04]: getting medicine from the store with their pets being walked, who have unusual needs, you can fill out that residents needing assistance form.

507
00:54:51,207 --> 00:54:53,587
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have a social worker who will follow up on that.

508
00:54:53,767 --> 00:55:01,549
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have volunteers who can help with a number of different unusual needs that are showing up because of this.

509
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:09,290
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's actually all just through the Board of Health and a volunteer network that we're managing.

510
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:10,231
[SPEAKER_04]: There's that.

511
00:55:10,911 --> 00:55:12,251
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on the housing one,

512
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:27,668
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the housing resources and support services and click here for info on Medford's rent stabilization guidelines.

513
00:55:27,748 --> 00:55:31,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that that's the guidelines you were referring to.

514
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:36,590
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, so it's there.

515
00:55:43,056 --> 00:55:48,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, and we'll need to make sure that all the housing Councilors at ABCD are aware of this.

516
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,763
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you flagged that for us.

517
00:55:54,665 --> 00:55:55,525
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, thank you very much.

518
00:55:55,545 --> 00:56:04,132
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, Jane, did you want to say anything else about how to apply for assistance?

519
00:56:06,508 --> 00:56:08,929
[SPEAKER_06]: I think everything's been covered at this point.

520
00:56:09,009 --> 00:56:10,310
[SPEAKER_06]: We're pretty similar.

521
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:18,414
[SPEAKER_06]: We're perhaps a little bit more flexible, not so much with the Medford money through the CPA, but we have another fund.

522
00:56:18,434 --> 00:56:20,155
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the HFI Family Fund.

523
00:56:20,616 --> 00:56:24,678
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're able to address some more unique needs sometimes.

524
00:56:25,078 --> 00:56:27,019
[SPEAKER_06]: So people are welcome to give us a call.

525
00:56:27,499 --> 00:56:30,701
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're pretty good at tailoring to the situation.

526
00:56:31,291 --> 00:56:44,635
[SPEAKER_06]: and understanding each particular, I know everyone is, but I'm not saying that, but we're good at being flexible and kind of understanding both within the legal lens and also all the different scenarios that might come up.

527
00:56:44,695 --> 00:56:47,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause there's lots of different variations.

528
00:56:47,376 --> 00:56:49,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Like every story is a little bit different.

529
00:56:50,317 --> 00:56:56,059
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're happy to talk about any cases or questions that people have with their particular needs.

530
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,780
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's not something that we cover, we have a,

531
00:56:59,337 --> 00:57:00,858
[SPEAKER_06]: a great referral system.

532
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,939
[SPEAKER_06]: We know where to send people and how to connect to them.

533
00:57:03,959 --> 00:57:05,160
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're happy to do that too.

534
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:08,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

535
00:57:09,381 --> 00:57:10,362
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, Gina.

536
00:57:10,402 --> 00:57:13,383
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a question from Justin Silva.

537
00:57:15,584 --> 00:57:19,086
[SPEAKER_13]: Can unmute you if I can find you.

538
00:57:21,607 --> 00:57:23,508
[SPEAKER_13]: Great, Justin, you should be unmuted.

539
00:57:23,548 --> 00:57:26,269
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, perfect.

540
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:26,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you able to hear me?

541
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:38,994
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I have a question that's sort of directed at the rent relief or assistance groups, and then maybe I don't know if housing families might have any input on this.

542
00:57:39,434 --> 00:57:41,135
[SPEAKER_01]: So I live with four other people.

543
00:57:42,315 --> 00:57:52,018
[SPEAKER_01]: We lease an apartment, and a few of them have been impacted by COVID-19, where they lost employment and affected their income.

544
00:57:52,518 --> 00:57:56,900
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed for a lot of these forms, it asks about household

545
00:57:57,536 --> 00:58:05,341
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was wondering if household meant everyone on the lease or if it meant the individual's tax family household.

546
00:58:08,082 --> 00:58:10,324
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can start if that's OK, Alex.

547
00:58:11,204 --> 00:58:11,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

548
00:58:11,464 --> 00:58:19,349
[SPEAKER_06]: So we would ask how the family or how the roommates consider their households, like how you keep your finances.

549
00:58:19,789 --> 00:58:22,130
[SPEAKER_06]: So you may be five separate entities.

550
00:58:22,371 --> 00:58:26,373
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's something that we would take into account as we try to figure out

551
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:30,492
[SPEAKER_06]: sorry, the screen's hopping, as we try to figure out what the situation is.

552
00:58:30,812 --> 00:58:36,134
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is something that we see sometimes, and that is how we would look to start.

553
00:58:36,254 --> 00:58:44,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we know that five people might be living independently together, especially with the housing prices, we might have more house density.

554
00:58:44,078 --> 00:58:47,559
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, thank you.

555
00:58:55,144 --> 00:58:57,425
[SPEAKER_12]: Someone from ABCD, is there anyone who can speak to that?

556
00:59:05,187 --> 00:59:06,087
[SPEAKER_18]: Or Metro Housing?

557
00:59:06,527 --> 00:59:07,447
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, or Metro Housing.

558
00:59:10,028 --> 00:59:14,089
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Josh from ABCD is calling on and off the call.

559
00:59:14,729 --> 00:59:17,910
[SPEAKER_13]: Lydia, can you speak to that issue?

560
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:20,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

561
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:23,191
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as who we count as being in the household,

562
00:59:25,095 --> 00:59:28,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, because we're five individuals.

563
00:59:29,078 --> 00:59:30,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of us are on the lease.

564
00:59:30,759 --> 00:59:36,382
[SPEAKER_01]: But financially, none of us are connected, I guess, besides that we pay for the lease that we live at.

565
00:59:38,643 --> 00:59:39,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's fine.

566
00:59:39,444 --> 00:59:43,086
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as you all are on the lease, you can apply as a group.

567
00:59:48,465 --> 00:59:54,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what is going on or is one person on the lease not able to pay and they wanna apply individually?

568
00:59:55,831 --> 01:00:08,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there's two people and I wasn't sure if they would be applying individually or if we all would have to provide our financial information as one household.

569
01:00:13,145 --> 01:00:17,308
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say that because everybody's on the lease,

570
01:00:18,508 --> 01:00:28,516
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, I didn't hear your question.

571
01:00:30,858 --> 01:00:37,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it one lease for everyone or the individuals each have their own separate lease with the landlord?

572
01:00:37,464 --> 01:00:40,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that like a sublet type of deal or?

573
01:00:41,747 --> 01:00:47,212
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one lease that all five of us are living under and then we split the rent

574
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:52,912
[SPEAKER_01]: individually, so by equally by five and send one paycheck to the landlord.

575
01:00:55,332 --> 01:01:13,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I would have to, you know, normally we would have one application and everybody who's on the lease does have to speak to their income as everybody is under the lease and sharing responsibility for the rent.

576
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:16,659
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, thank you.

577
01:01:25,918 --> 01:01:29,640
[SPEAKER_13]: And Josh, I saw you kind of falling on and off the call.

578
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:31,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, sorry, I'm having issues with my internet.

579
01:01:32,361 --> 01:01:34,182
[SPEAKER_13]: It's okay.

580
01:01:34,222 --> 01:01:37,844
[SPEAKER_13]: The question, if you didn't hear it, was about what counts as a household.

581
01:01:37,864 --> 01:01:51,890
[SPEAKER_13]: It's okay if you can't, but if you know from ABCD's programs, if there's five people who are unrelated living in a roommate situation, and some of them want to apply for the rental assistance,

582
01:01:52,587 --> 01:02:01,109
[SPEAKER_13]: Does the household count as all five of them on the lease, or can the individuals count as households, I think is the question.

583
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:04,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they all five on the same lease?

584
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:06,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

585
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:07,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

586
01:02:10,951 --> 01:02:11,191
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

587
01:02:11,211 --> 01:02:17,973
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not a lawyer, so I will have to defer to those who know housing law a little better than I.

588
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:28,663
[SPEAKER_11]: But we can certainly take your information, Mr. Silva, and get back to you.

589
01:02:30,164 --> 01:02:31,045
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

590
01:02:31,125 --> 01:02:31,565
[SPEAKER_00]: One second.

591
01:02:31,905 --> 01:02:42,531
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that raises a really important point, that there's probably a whole bunch of people in our community living in a shared lease space, but they're all individuals.

592
01:02:43,131 --> 01:02:51,676
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully there's some way to accommodate two or three people on a lease, because if you're looking at everyone's income,

593
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:58,042
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe their income altogether collectively says they can't, they can afford it, but two or three people in the house can't.

594
01:03:03,184 --> 01:03:04,684
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Neil, for mentioning that.

595
01:03:04,724 --> 01:03:08,526
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess sort of, I kind of, I'm not sure if I made this clear.

596
01:03:08,586 --> 01:03:11,006
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect to necessarily change the answer that some people have given.

597
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:15,308
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean more in terms of if they filled it out as an individual

598
01:03:16,336 --> 01:03:20,444
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, if the rent is 700 per person, it's the way that we split it out.

599
01:03:21,246 --> 01:03:24,733
[SPEAKER_01]: If they would put 700 for their rent rather than putting the 3,500.

600
01:03:31,853 --> 01:03:47,505
[SPEAKER_18]: It sounds as though what you may need to do is to talk with the councillor at ABCD to ask whether they can look into whether your situation, they can help you in your situation.

601
01:03:47,685 --> 01:03:57,872
[SPEAKER_18]: So we don't have the answer this evening, but certainly it's worth asking, trying to apply and see if they're able to take your application.

602
01:03:58,633 --> 01:03:59,874
[SPEAKER_11]: Mrs. Silva, I'll leave my,

603
01:04:01,482 --> 01:04:03,683
[SPEAKER_11]: contact information in the chat.

604
01:04:04,323 --> 01:04:08,504
[SPEAKER_11]: And why don't you just give me a call or email me tomorrow.

605
01:04:10,364 --> 01:04:11,945
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you a call tomorrow.

606
01:04:12,145 --> 01:04:12,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

607
01:04:17,206 --> 01:04:17,866
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

608
01:04:17,906 --> 01:04:28,509
[SPEAKER_13]: There was a question earlier just from from Neil actually to for Barbara about waiting lists for the different waiting lists that you mentioned.

609
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:30,730
[SPEAKER_13]: The question was,

610
01:04:31,881 --> 01:04:39,605
[SPEAKER_13]: with you were sort of talking about certain lists being open and certain lists being closed, and maybe some are going to open soon, even though they're closed.

611
01:04:40,606 --> 01:04:43,567
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it better for residents to get on a waiting list right now?

612
01:04:43,988 --> 01:04:48,890
[SPEAKER_13]: Or is it the situation that they, they cannot even do that until the lists are open if you could?

613
01:04:51,192 --> 01:04:58,756
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, the waiting lists that are currently closed, one cannot apply to that portion of housing.

614
01:04:58,876 --> 01:04:59,276
[SPEAKER_16]: So our

615
01:05:01,861 --> 01:05:06,685
[SPEAKER_16]: federal, our two family developments, the waiting list is currently closed.

616
01:05:08,327 --> 01:05:16,734
[SPEAKER_16]: And the purpose of closing a waiting list is that we do purge the lists and take a look at how many people are on the waiting list.

617
01:05:17,875 --> 01:05:28,845
[SPEAKER_16]: And waiting lists, when we were dealing with individuals who really are in need of housing, they frequently think, you know, what number am I on the waiting list?

618
01:05:29,387 --> 01:05:35,790
[SPEAKER_16]: and they'd like to hear their number because they can judge then maybe how much longer they'll have to wait.

619
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:38,391
[SPEAKER_16]: But they don't really work that way.

620
01:05:40,412 --> 01:05:56,479
[SPEAKER_16]: People who are living in our two family, or families, I should say, who are living in our two family developments, until there's a vacancy, until someone moves out, one person comes off of the waiting list to get a unit.

621
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:05,816
[SPEAKER_16]: Rents are high, as we all know, and people are not relocating out of the developments too frequently.

622
01:06:06,496 --> 01:06:08,638
[SPEAKER_16]: So a waiting list can be lengthy.

623
01:06:09,218 --> 01:06:23,148
[SPEAKER_16]: And in terms of the waiting list that is currently open, and by the way, that holds the same for the elderly development waiting lists that are closed as well.

624
01:06:24,629 --> 01:06:26,711
[SPEAKER_16]: In terms of the waiting lists that are open,

625
01:06:28,585 --> 01:06:33,549
[SPEAKER_16]: For example, the Wackling Court State Elderly Disabled Development is open.

626
01:06:33,569 --> 01:06:51,485
[SPEAKER_16]: And right now, the way the application process works is that one can sign up online, and I will get into details as individuals I've invited to call me.

627
01:06:53,922 --> 01:06:57,023
[SPEAKER_16]: It's kind of lengthy right now about how you get the application.

628
01:06:57,043 --> 01:07:00,105
[SPEAKER_16]: We have an online application and a paper application.

629
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:15,690
[SPEAKER_16]: But right now when someone signs up for the state elderly disabled development that the waiting list is open, they will be placed on a list.

630
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:21,973
[SPEAKER_16]: They have a Medford resident preference and the state does have priorities

631
01:07:23,202 --> 01:07:25,544
[SPEAKER_16]: and there's an order of priorities.

632
01:07:27,024 --> 01:07:42,914
[SPEAKER_16]: And when you apply on this new state waiting list, when you are in emergency where you could meet one of the priorities, you can apply to any housing authorities across the state.

633
01:07:44,895 --> 01:07:50,859
[SPEAKER_16]: However, if we have an opening right now, what we're doing is we are going to that

634
01:07:51,579 --> 01:07:59,562
[SPEAKER_16]: emergency waiting list and offering a unit to a Medford resident if they are on that priority waiting list.

635
01:08:00,522 --> 01:08:03,303
[SPEAKER_16]: That's that emergency priority waiting list.

636
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:19,108
[SPEAKER_16]: So that for people who are on our waiting list, because there is an emergency priority waiting list through the state, we would be going to that list before we go to the standard waiting list for Wackling Court.

637
01:08:19,849 --> 01:08:20,789
[SPEAKER_16]: Does this, does

638
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:23,853
[SPEAKER_16]: Does this make sense?

639
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:24,833
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I think so.

640
01:08:24,853 --> 01:08:25,174
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

641
01:08:26,034 --> 01:08:29,977
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's hard to determine how long people wait on waiting lists.

642
01:08:30,477 --> 01:08:45,768
[SPEAKER_16]: Now for the section eight waiting list, I think for section eight, what can occur is fluctuations associated with the budget.

643
01:08:46,676 --> 01:08:56,878
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, usually people will call us and they will want to know, again, they are waiting for housing, they'll want to know, you know, what number am I on a waiting list?

644
01:08:56,938 --> 01:09:00,259
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's not something that we can give out to an individual.

645
01:09:00,899 --> 01:09:05,640
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's not helpful to an individual or a family to hear a number anyway.

646
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:11,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Because, for example, with this, we have 987 vouchers and right now,

647
01:09:13,926 --> 01:09:20,847
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know how many vouchers we would have that we can pull down individuals from the waiting list.

648
01:09:21,647 --> 01:09:29,809
[SPEAKER_16]: But what I can say that it is, there is a connection to the budget that we have for these 897 vouchers.

649
01:09:30,729 --> 01:09:41,031
[SPEAKER_16]: And in this period of time, with a number of people losing their employment, this budget from the Medford Housing Authority for the vouchers would be

650
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:51,558
[SPEAKER_16]: affected by a turnover to funding to landlords, more funding going out to landlords to cover the rent of the people whose rent has been decreased.

651
01:09:52,538 --> 01:09:59,220
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, it's hard to estimate how long one would wait on that particular waiting list.

652
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:06,902
[SPEAKER_16]: I can say that I believe the last round of individuals that we pulled down were from, I believe,

653
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:20,168
[SPEAKER_16]: and I'd rather not be quoted, I'm guessing, I think it was around January of 2012 for people who signed up for the Section 8 program.

654
01:10:22,109 --> 01:10:38,201
[SPEAKER_16]: And for the MRVP program, I believe that it's similar to the Section 8 waiting list, but I would ask you to call me again for a little bit more detail so that I can get to the appropriate

655
01:10:38,935 --> 01:10:51,861
[SPEAKER_16]: staff member who could answer the question a little bit better than I at this point, but I believe that that's a fairly decent overview of waiting lists.

656
01:10:52,361 --> 01:10:54,402
[SPEAKER_13]: Does that help with your question?

657
01:10:54,482 --> 01:10:54,662
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

658
01:10:54,722 --> 01:11:06,007
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'll restate what I think you, what you said, which is Neil's question was, if the waiting list is opening soon, do people need to submit now to get on it faster than it sounds like?

659
01:11:06,047 --> 01:11:06,127
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

660
01:11:07,811 --> 01:11:33,969
[SPEAKER_16]: or yes if it's closed no no it won't be people will not be able to submit until the waiting list is open after giving you this this outline of the waiting list i would suggest that for any open waiting list anyone apply and definitely apply for public housing because you never know when your name will be called if in fact at that time you would need housing

661
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:42,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Great, so closed waiting list means you cannot apply and then the priority on the waiting list is maybe a little bit unpredictable.

662
01:11:42,553 --> 01:11:43,473
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

663
01:11:43,513 --> 01:11:47,335
[SPEAKER_04]: How would people become aware that the waiting lists are open?

664
01:11:47,735 --> 01:11:55,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it just pure luck you happen to contact the housing authority on the day the waiting lists are open and then two days later they're full again?

665
01:11:56,509 --> 01:12:08,072
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, well, we, we are required to advertise and we have it posted, I believe, on our website and also, um, in the reception area of our office when individuals come into the office.

666
01:12:09,573 --> 01:12:23,577
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so many phone calls, um, and we're able to discuss the waiting lists with people or what, what, um, developments they can apply to or apply for.

667
01:12:24,639 --> 01:12:36,309
[SPEAKER_16]: As we don't have development specific waiting lists we have an elderly disabled development waiting list, and we have a family waiting list to the public housing side on section eight.

668
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:40,173
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just one application for no matter the composition of the family.

669
01:12:44,296 --> 01:12:45,117
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

670
01:12:45,678 --> 01:12:46,558
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, and actually you're.

671
01:12:47,692 --> 01:12:58,015
[SPEAKER_13]: Your explanation reminds me of one other kind of basic question that I wanted to pose, maybe to OCD, actually, potentially, but you may want to jump in, Barbara.

672
01:12:58,556 --> 01:13:03,417
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's sometimes there are affordable units that become available in Medford.

673
01:13:03,637 --> 01:13:11,020
[SPEAKER_13]: So that would be units that are where the rent is restricted to people who make particular incomes.

674
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:16,722
[SPEAKER_13]: And they'll sometimes show up on their own in small developments, or sometimes when a large development is built,

675
01:13:17,743 --> 01:13:24,769
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a law in Medford that says that a certain percentage of them need to be designated as having those rent restrictions.

676
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:33,097
[SPEAKER_13]: So how can people apply for those affordable units that come online in Medford?

677
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:44,727
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have started to create affordable housing opportunities and housing lottery mailing lists on MailChimp.

678
01:13:45,498 --> 01:13:55,267
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've been, whenever I get calls, I'll add the members onto the list and this info is also in the city page.

679
01:13:59,971 --> 01:14:00,291
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

680
01:14:02,453 --> 01:14:08,558
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyone else from any of the organizations want to say anything about how to apply for affordable units or anyone else from the city?

681
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:16,483
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I, Alex, can I answer an earlier question by Mr. Silva.

682
01:14:17,664 --> 01:14:18,004
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

683
01:14:18,505 --> 01:14:19,886
[SPEAKER_11]: So, sorry I talked to.

684
01:14:20,386 --> 01:14:28,873
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just texting back with my housing director, and she said under the guidelines on the, on the website that Mr. Silva as long as you're on the lease.

685
01:14:29,814 --> 01:14:31,495
[SPEAKER_11]: You would qualify individual.

686
01:14:38,981 --> 01:14:39,181
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

687
01:14:39,221 --> 01:14:39,681
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, Josh.

688
01:14:42,032 --> 01:14:44,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for getting back to me on that.

689
01:14:44,514 --> 01:14:45,034
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.

690
01:14:46,856 --> 01:14:54,261
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're coming up to just the last few minutes, and I think I haven't seen any other questions in the chat or anything.

691
01:14:55,422 --> 01:15:05,569
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, it's very clear that this is a great need in our community, and also that it can be very confusing and overwhelming, and for a lot of reasons.

692
01:15:06,090 --> 01:15:10,653
[SPEAKER_13]: So Housing Medford, as best we can, can continue to be a resource for

693
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:20,128
[SPEAKER_13]: sharing information about things like open waiting lists and when affordable housing units may be coming online in Medford to kind of notifying people.

694
01:15:20,909 --> 01:15:26,214
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, please email us at housingmedfordatgmail.com to join our mailing list.

695
01:15:26,234 --> 01:15:28,035
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a Facebook page, we have a Google group.

696
01:15:28,956 --> 01:15:31,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Really all are welcome to participate in that.

697
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:36,263
[SPEAKER_13]: And I wanna just call back to a couple of points from earlier.

698
01:15:38,337 --> 01:15:42,460
[SPEAKER_13]: The slide that's being shown right now really is just a summary of what to do.

699
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:52,905
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you take nothing else away, if you need emergency rental assistance, these two phone numbers for NBHP and for ABCD are the ones to call.

700
01:15:53,445 --> 01:15:58,148
[SPEAKER_13]: And if that is difficult or if you don't get an answer back, then calling the Office of Community Development.

701
01:15:58,588 --> 01:16:01,430
[SPEAKER_13]: And Lorena's here on the Zoom right now.

702
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:02,430
[SPEAKER_13]: She'll probably answer your call.

703
01:16:04,515 --> 01:16:07,277
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the last thing.

704
01:16:07,377 --> 01:16:08,298
[SPEAKER_18]: I apologize.

705
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:13,261
[SPEAKER_18]: The email address changed.

706
01:16:14,602 --> 01:16:16,684
[SPEAKER_18]: I had fixed it, and then it went back again.

707
01:16:17,264 --> 01:16:20,607
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's housingmedford at gmail.com.

708
01:16:23,589 --> 01:16:24,169
[SPEAKER_13]: So go ahead.

709
01:16:24,229 --> 01:16:24,690
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

710
01:16:24,770 --> 01:16:32,715
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just going to finish with mentioning the housing production plan, this green teal box in the corner here.

711
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:44,703
[SPEAKER_13]: Really what that is, is a vision for what kinds of housing Medford should be building and producing and creating and what affordable housing should look like in Medford.

712
01:16:44,723 --> 01:16:47,683
[SPEAKER_13]: So everyone's input is definitely welcome.

713
01:16:47,703 --> 01:16:48,804
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a survey you can take.

714
01:16:49,964 --> 01:16:51,684
[SPEAKER_13]: There's the public webinar on June 4th.

715
01:16:53,045 --> 01:16:56,946
[SPEAKER_13]: Please, please take that, get involved, be involved with us.

716
01:16:57,066 --> 01:16:58,246
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to hear more from you.

717
01:16:58,266 --> 01:17:02,247
[SPEAKER_13]: Roberta, is there anything else that we want to say?

718
01:17:03,622 --> 01:17:04,763
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's everything.

719
01:17:05,903 --> 01:17:10,606
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much to all of the organizations who participated this evening.

720
01:17:11,647 --> 01:17:19,952
[SPEAKER_18]: It's really helpful for us to learn more about how to access our housing resources here in Medford.

721
01:17:22,594 --> 01:17:23,915
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you folks who asked questions.

722
01:17:23,935 --> 01:17:29,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for having us.

723
01:17:29,498 --> 01:17:33,021
[SPEAKER_13]: Neil is just putting one question in the chat that I'll reiterate as we leave.

724
01:17:33,892 --> 01:17:35,473
[SPEAKER_13]: housing members next meeting.

725
01:17:36,714 --> 01:17:43,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, housing members next meeting is on Memorial Day, the holiday we did a poll the members and that was the day when most people were available.

726
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:56,591
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, since we're probably not all going to be having big barbecues, cookouts, necessarily this year, like we were before, perhaps folks were a little bit freer on that day than they otherwise would have been in another year.

727
01:17:57,451 --> 01:17:59,173
[SPEAKER_13]: Fortunate and unfortunate for scheduling.

728
01:17:59,213 --> 01:18:01,274
[SPEAKER_13]: But so yes, Monday, May 25, 6.30pm, I can

729
01:18:03,815 --> 01:18:06,718
[SPEAKER_13]: make sure people have access to the Zoom link if you would like to join us.

730
01:18:08,099 --> 01:18:10,401
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll just be discussing housing issues in Medford.

731
01:18:10,441 --> 01:18:31,259
[SPEAKER_13]: Recently, we've really been discussing COVID-19 and emergency housing resources that we can help make available during this time, but we were active before COVID-19 just on general affordable housing issues in Medford, and we will continue to be as things return to whatever normal looks like in the future.

732
01:18:32,527 --> 01:18:33,428
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you, everyone.

733
01:18:34,769 --> 01:18:36,250
[SPEAKER_13]: It was really great to be with all of you tonight.

734
01:18:37,591 --> 01:18:38,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

735
01:18:38,111 --> 01:18:40,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
