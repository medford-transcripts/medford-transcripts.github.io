    <p>[Lois Grossman]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=91.961">I</a>  could offer a follow-up on something.</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=99.187">Please.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lois Grossman]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=100.928">Remember</a>  I brought up the question of the stretch plastics down at Whole Foods? <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=106.977">So</a>  I went down to Whole Foods and talked to somebody there and there's an online website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=114.742">I</a>  talked to somebody on the phone or chatted on the computer and they sent me to a website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=120.626">That</a>  was not very helpful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=122.567">The</a>  man I spoke to at the store was not one that I usually see there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=129.111">He</a>  might've been a regional manager and for the day, <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=133.316">He</a>  said that the plastics are collected in-house by Amazon, well, by Whole Foods, which is Amazon. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=142.3">And</a>  he doesn't know what they do, but whatever they do, they do in-house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=150.563">And</a>  that's as far as I've gotten. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=153.345">He</a>  says they do recycle them, but he doesn't know how. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=158.727">And</a>  I haven't been able to, <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=161.253">get</a>  high enough up the corporate ladder to get a person who does know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=167.996">But</a>  it's in-house is that much I learned.</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=173.298">That</a>  is a good addendum. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=174.659">I'm</a>  glad you followed up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=176.539">We</a>  will maybe have time to discuss more of that soon. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=180.021">Yeah,</a>  I do appreciate that, actually. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=186.27">All</a>  right, I would entertain a motion to accept our minutes and move forward.</p>

    <p>[Barry Ingber]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=191.771">So</a>  moved.</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=196.432">Fantastic,</a>  we'll go down the line. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=198.153">All</a>  in favor.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1319.367">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1319.607">I've</a>  made you a co-host, so you should be able to do it now.</p>

    <p>[Robert Paine]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1322.149">Let's</a>  try. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1322.749">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1323.209">Here</a>  we go.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1324.75">Actually,</a>  before we jump into that, I think we skipped over. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1327.892">The</a>  next meeting is February 3rd. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1335.907">And</a>  I think we had said that Matt Barlow will be presenting to us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1345.412">Were</a>  you arranging that, and is that all set?</p>

    <p>[Barry Ingber]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1348.993">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1352.455">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1352.795">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1353.515">Oh,</a>  fantastic. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1355.837">If</a>  anybody has any particular requests of what they would like Matt to cover, <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1366.558">let</a>  me know, either now or shoot me an email, but.</p>

    <p>[EO-vAhUJAKo_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1373.741">Mary,</a>  could you remind us and the new members what is he speaking on?</p>

    <p>[Barry Ingber]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1377.842">Okay,</a>  so Matt is a climate scientist who lives in North Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1384.324">He</a>  was one of the, he was a lead author on, was it the, <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1393.613">The</a>  COPS public, it was on one of the international reports. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1402.882">So</a>  he knows his, he knows his climate science. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1406.646">And</a>  I figured that people here would, I mean, if <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1417.968">We</a>  know what we want him to cover. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1419.95">He</a>  will cover that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1421.092">Otherwise,</a>  he'll probably just cover what we can expect here in Medford and whatever he feels like talking about.</p>

    <p>[L5Dn-1_BzKM_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1435.633">I</a>  think it's a nice idea to let him have the floor to speak about what his interests and current research might be, or whatever he thinks is important for Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1449.142">But</a>  yeah, it was the IPCC sixth assessment report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1457.208">That's</a>  a five-year thing, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1459.81">Yeah,</a>  and that's kind of what <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1470.43">Yeah,</a>  that it is, it is like the major report on the environment.</p>

    <p>[Barry Ingber]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1475.856">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1476.157">And</a>  if I remember correctly, he was the lead author on rainfall precipitation issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1484.547">Oh,</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1494.251">I</a>  put his UMass Lowell profile into the chat there so that we can look at what publications he's worked on and things like that as well, in case anyone wants some light reading.</p>

    <p>[Barry Ingber]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1508.255">He</a>  actually has publications that are light reading. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1512.236">He</a>  is interested in public education. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1515.637">So</a>  kind of like Paul on chemicals, he wants stuff to be understandable too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1524.697">people</a>  and like Jessica. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1529.883">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1534.208">Fantastic.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1535.35">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1535.67">So</a>  we should all, I think it's worth preparing some questions, making sure we're in the right space for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1541.076">I</a>  think it'd be very insightful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1552.47">All</a>  right, I don't think there's any other notes for February 3rd. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1556.235">I</a>  think we're looking good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1558.539">Bob,</a>  it's all yours, please.</p>

    <p>[Robert Paine]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1561.503">Okay,</a>  can you see the presentation on your screen?</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1565.168">Yep,</a>  looks great.</p>

    <p>[Robert Paine]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1567.322">This</a>  was this was law was signed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1570.385">It</a>  was after the actual session on the legislature, which, which was ended in July, but they actually came back and finish the job, if you will, although there were some elements that weren't included, like this third party. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1585.784">electric</a>  provider issue, which I sent a note about a few days ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1590.725">But</a>  let's go through it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1591.605">The</a>  key source is a WBUR summary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1594.566">So</a>  I'm not going to say I did all this research myself. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1597.647">I</a>  just plagiarized what they provided. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1600.208">So</a>  I'll plead guilty right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1604.629">The</a>  overview is it builds on previous climate laws. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1610.465">and</a>  provides basically what I would call a mid-course correction for issues that have emerged in the implementation of these earlier laws. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1619.111">And</a>  supposedly it should be now easier and faster to build out some of this infrastructure that is required to meet these goals, which is, I think it's 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from like a 1990 baseline by, <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1638.1">2030</a>  and then 75% by 2040 and 100% by 2050, which is pretty aggressive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1647.563">The</a>  current permitting process has been determined to be complicated and tedious, so the new law is trying to make this easier to do, to actually build out what we need to do to stay on track with the climate plans. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1664.61">I</a>  think you all got a list, maybe except the new members got an email with this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1670.814">This</a>  file, but it can be, we can also provide it again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1676.017">This</a>  this PowerPoint file anyway. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1681.05">The</a>  the state energy officials are now getting organized to rank siting preferences for some of these renewable energy projects and to develop a help municipalities to evaluate setting proposals in their towns. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1697.727">And</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1698.478">Developers</a>  are now required to do community outreach and hold public meetings before they obtain permits. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1704.283">And</a>  there's a new state agency, the Office of Environmental Justice and Equity, which Barry will be happy to see, to help individuals, community groups, and municipalities participate in this process and affect <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1722.12">The</a>  law creates a fund to help stakeholders pay for any intervention in some of these permitting processes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1735.431">So</a>  if you oppose something, you're supposed to get a fund to help you participate in that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1742.617">We'll</a>  see how that works out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1745.162">The</a>  cumulative impact analysis is required, CIA, for large renewable and clean energy projects. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1753.708">And</a>  the typical thing is how a project might impact local air quality and water quality issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1763.138">But</a>  also whether there's a community has been experiencing a lot of industrial development, and this project might add to this burden, sort of like an environmental justice issue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1777.473">In</a>  some cases, developers may have to compensate communities with such a program, like a community benefit agreement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1789.305">But</a>  the law is trying to go for simpler, faster permits, sort of like, on the one hand, you get a fund to oppose these permits, but they want it to be simpler and faster, maybe to consolidate the reviews into one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1805.731">First</a>  of all, the permits into one master permit set the deadlines for how long the review process can take and put limits on the appeals process. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1814.214">So</a>  it's sort of like, <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1817.556">opposing</a>  things here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1820.658">You</a>  get money for appealing and opposing a project, but there's limits on the appeals process. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1829.825">And</a>  there's time limits. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1832.127">They</a>  have a definition of what a large clean energy project is, is more than 25 megawatts of power generation or 100 megawatts of battery storage. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1845.595">In</a>  which case, the state board will be in charge of the review and has to issue or reject the permit within 15 months. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1854.318">But</a>  for small projects, municipalities will retain control. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1858.14">And</a>  I don't know whether Medford is even has experience in this, but I don't know if there's any Medford projects anyway. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1867.092">The</a>  master permit for such projects must be issued or rejected within 12 months. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1871.215">If</a>  a town doesn't have the resources to conduct the review, the state board can handle this anyway. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1881.942">If</a>  the deadline for the permit issuance or rejection is not met within the deadline, it's automatically approved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1892.814">except</a>  that if too many projects get this automatic approval, the legislation might have to revisit the process anyway. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1901.958">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1903.619">Benji,</a>  you're not going to like this, but now clean energy includes nuclear fission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1910.462">And</a>  Governor Healey is in talks with Connecticut to see if they might get power from Millstone nuclear power plant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1922.832">So</a>  nuclear is back for clean energy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1933.461">It's</a>  going to be crucial to find ways to store the energy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1936.424">Obviously,</a>  that's always been the problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1941.148">Renewable</a>  energy, you cannot dispatch it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1945.671">You</a>  cannot say, I want 100 megawatts in the next hour, because the solar energy obviously is diurnal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1954.198">Depends</a>  on if there's clouds. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1956.039">Wind,</a>  of course, depends on the winds blowing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1961.149">But</a>  if you can store it, you resolve such intermittencies in the availability of renewable energy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1968.995">That's</a>  the big challenge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1972.017">You</a>  could do various ways to do this, not just batteries, but pumping and such. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1983.106">The</a>  state has to ramp up a lot in <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1987.27">adding</a>  the storage. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1990.072">I</a>  can't – I don't know if they're going to be possible to do this by a factor of 10 by 2030. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=1994.576">It's</a>  only five years away from roughly 500 megawatt hours to 5,000. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2003.683">So,</a>  there's going to be projects on this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2008.687">They</a>  have to study the question of how to bring <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2014.72">important</a>  resources like offshore wind projects and batteries online by July 1. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2021.942">Now,</a>  under the new law, it should be easier to get permission to go solar in historical districts, because now historical commissions have to give substantial weight to the threat posed by climate change. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2034.125">They</a>  just can't say, I don't want to see these solar panels. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2042.101">There's</a>  going to be more solar canopies, maybe. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2047.084">And</a>  there's going to be studies on how to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2051.066">The</a>  Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs has to monitor EV chargers and make sure they're reliable, widely available, and distributed equitably, and track the prices and frequency of use, et cetera. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2066.974">And</a>  they want to be able to forecast the charging demand. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2073.063">maybe</a>  make electric utilities, make infrastructure investment plans to meet the anticipated demand. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2081.685">Also,</a>  the law wants to have the state allow more pole-mounted and right-of-way chargers so people who park on the street have a way to charge their vehicles, and restricts the ability of homeowners associations to block installations in places like condominiums. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2102.546">So</a>  there's efforts to make charging more widespread basically and overcome what has been basically resistance to that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2117.032">Also,</a>  the issue is, are we gonna be able to ban car dealerships from selling gasoline or diesel powered vehicles after 2035? <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2125.255">They're</a>  gonna review the feasibility of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2130.113">Of</a>  course, I know the Trump administration is not going to like that either. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2134.154">So,</a>  it should be interesting to see how the state and the federal government work on all this or clash on all of this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2144.277">Transitioning</a>  from natural gas. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2147.278">We</a>  don't have a ban on gas companies from building more pipelines and etc. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2153.539">in</a>  their service areas, but there's some new restrictions <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2158.599">Utilities</a>  could build more network geothermal projects. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2165.281">And</a>  there's also, it's more difficult for loan owners to petition the Department of Public Utilities for a natural gas hookup under the state's right to service laws. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2177.405">There's</a>  the issue now of does the request comply with the goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and whether there's feasible alternatives. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2186.371">There's</a>  incentive to gas utilities to replace leaky underground pipes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2189.893">That'll</a>  be good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2190.513">Then</a>  the priorities are instead of encouraging costly pipe replacements, Massachusetts will help prioritize short-term repairs or retiring. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2202.299">Totally</a>  retiring stretches the pipeline. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2207.341">Other</a>  notable changes, the Department of Public Utilities <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2211.922">will</a>  establish a cheaper electric rate for moderate income residents, like it does for low income residents. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2217.724">So</a>  that'll be good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2220.646">Massport</a>  has to prioritize greenhouse gas reductions and environmental justice when making decisions about transportation infrastructure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2228.329">Companies</a>  building new electric transmission or distribution lines have to consider hardware and software updates that can make existing power lines more efficient. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2237.899">And</a>  every five years, electric utilities have to file a report about their vulnerability to climate change and plans to increase resiliency. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2248.548">There's</a>  going to be a commission to study how the clean air energy transmission is affecting fossil fuel workers, because there could be less demand for such workers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2259.676">And</a>  it mandates the state to develop new flood risk maps that more accurately depict the risk of inland flooding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2268.682">And</a>  that's my quick summary.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2274.124">Could</a>  I add a couple of things to that?</p>

    <p>[Robert Paine]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2276.124">You</a>  may.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2277.545">There</a>  are a few things that affect us or could affect us more directly, which I was excited to see and hear. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2286.547">One</a>  of them is allowing procurement of electric school buses and charging infrastructure together, which is a bizarre, <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2295.93">thing</a>  problem that that has crept up where where some municipalities have been waiting a long time after purchasing their buses to actually get the charging infrastructure installed for them, because they weren't allowed to procure them together in the past. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2315.338">The</a>  pole-mounted chargers that you mentioned, Bob, I think that's gonna be a great thing moving forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2322.122">Up</a>  until this point, I think there's been a limitation on the ability for incentives to cover pole-mounted chargers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2333.328">Josh,</a>  you might actually know more about this than I do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2336.37">I</a>  think it's because of the efficiency of them or something, right?</p>

    <p>[Josh Ekhart-Lee]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2341.19">Yeah,</a>  you're right on the money, Brenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2344.155">So</a>  this should make it easier for us as municipalities to roll them out on our sidewalks where the curb's already kind of busy.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2350.725">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2355.569">It</a>  directs the Department of Public Utilities to approve smart meters, which enables two-way communication and it helps to modernize the grid. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2373.831">to</a>  better manage demand, which way back when I was at National Grid, we were trying to get smart meters included and the DPU shot us down. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2384.181">So</a>  I find that pretty exciting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2387.545">And</a>  it's allowing net metering across service territories between different utilities, which is a game changer, I think.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001610_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2402.618">Is</a>  there any effort to have meters monitored by people? <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2415.609">Like,</a>  you know, have an app that says this is how much energy you're using. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2427.584">Because</a>  I think that'll be just a tremendous help to people in saving energy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2437.892">I</a>  have your meters report to you how much energy you're using. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2445.917">I</a>  know you can buy equipment to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2449.56">You</a>  can actually rig up your electrics panel <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2457.648">to</a>  give this information to you, but that's an expenditure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2467.669">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2468.169">I</a>  think I think these step these smart meters could be a step in that direction. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2473.091">OK,</a>  I know when national and national grid installed some in the Worcester area some years ago, they were able to use them for demand response and they could do some real time communication with residents to encourage them to reduce their usage in times of peak demand.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001610_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2494.405">And</a>  on another point, Bob mentioned nuclear energy being back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2501.713">Was</a>  there any discussion about where to stick the waste? <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2505.717">Because</a>  I know we dug up several kilometers down into the desert. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2512.483">set</a>  up some storage facility in a salt mine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2519.085">I</a>  think it was Utah that said, not in our backyard. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2521.946">Is</a>  there some initiative to, if this is back, then do we have some means of dealing with the waste or did you hear any talk about that?</p>

    <p>[Robert Paine]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2537.952">This</a>  is Bob. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2539.472">I</a>  think some of the newer <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2541.756">modules</a>  that are being contemplated may have the ability to take the waste and actually consume it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2551.387">I'm</a>  hopeful that that is the case. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2554.13">So</a>  some of these new nuclear modules that are being considered <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2564.484">This</a>  is this a new technology may have the capability and I'll have to look into this more that you've triggered my question now that I'll have to look up whether they can actually take the waste and actually somehow consume it as part of their energy input. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2580.839">So</a>  I'll look that up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2583.054">That</a>  would be a good thing.</p>

    <p>[L5Dn-1_BzKM_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2586.655">And</a>  if I may add to that, I did just put a link to a webinar that I saw of women in energy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2594.758">It</a>  was really quite an interesting kind of overview of advanced nuclear energy that the National Renewable Labs have been supporting for quite some time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2609.697">And</a>  they are looking at safer system types. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2617.983">And</a>  yes, indeed, they do talk a little bit, although not enough. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2623.387">And</a>  I asked a bunch of questions about waste on that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2628.431">But</a>  yes, with that idea that the waste <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2631.893">would</a>  be a part of a process in which the most valuable fuel gets used first and then it kind of downgrades in different systems of varying importance, but always being used until it becomes basically a <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2653.363">minor</a>  issue, I guess. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2655.384">So</a>  anyway, I don't know the answer fully, but it seems like that is a key concern. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2662.465">And</a>  they recognize, of course, that nuclear energy comes with this major challenge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2671.407">And</a>  so it does need to be part of any opposed nuclear systems. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2680.99">Waste</a>  management, that is.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2686.01">Interestingly,</a>  it also mentions incentives for nuclear fusion, which made me wonder if we're closer than I thought we were to that, or if that was just wishful thinking.</p>

    <p>[L5Dn-1_BzKM_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2697.552">I</a>  think it's the perpetual 20 years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2700.553">It'll</a>  be here in 20 years, I think, as they've been saying for the past 50. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2705.453">I</a>  think now it's just 18 years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2716.139">just</a>  around the corner.</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2720.282">And</a>  Luke, I'd love it if you could expand a little bit on your comment on the network's geothermal, just so I can get a better grasp of it.</p>

    <p>[L5Dn-1_BzKM_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2730.59">I</a>  actually went to a commercial utilities in-person <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2739.436">discussion</a>  on network geothermal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2743.561">The</a>  utilities are very keen on seeing it work because the pressure to reduce gas is very strong, but the need for some gas <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2761.78">capability</a>  will remain and the idea that they could retool large percentages of their gas workforce to water workforce is very appealing to them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2780.511">And</a>  so the idea that a neighborhood, just pick a few blocks in your area of Medford, might have a central plant for producing hot water that then is basically run through the streets and instead of a gas line off of the street to run a boiler and <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2807.29">domestic</a>  hot water system, you might just have a line of hot water that comes in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2814.253">And</a>  so that would basically tie to a heat pump that is just like a geothermal heat pump that currently goes into wells underneath a facility. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2825.7">It</a>  would simply be tapping into this network of water. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2831.943">And</a>  so it would give the potential that you're drilling wells in the streets, you're drilling wells in areas where there is kind of space for that, that is otherwise unused. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2848.75">You're</a>  maintaining the utility kind of rates of way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2853.692">And</a>  the utility then has this, it gets to keep itself alive as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2859.276">Certainly</a>  that is a part of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2860.657">They</a>  are keen on being able to continue to be a utility. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2868.302">But</a>  it is a very appealing concept that instead of a fuel, you're literally just tapping into heat that is available to you in the street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2882.148">And</a>  as Josh pointed out, yes, there's another one also in Framingham. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2887.589">The</a>  National Grid's definitely big on it and Eversource is very big on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2891.77">And</a>  there are a number of projects that I see come through Mass Save, the large multifamily projects, where they have multiple buildings on, you know, what was formerly a campus of some sort. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2905.994">And</a>  they're very seriously considering how do we network this all together with a big geothermal <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2914.096">system,</a>  so.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen McKenna]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2917.598">Luke</a>  had a quick question, maybe in the weeds for some, but how do they bill each individual customer? <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2924.783">Do</a>  they have BT meters with flow and temperature?</p>

    <p>[L5Dn-1_BzKM_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2930.446">I</a>  don't know that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2931.786">I</a>  think it's not fully developed to that level, although I wouldn't be surprised if these pilot projects, that is a key part of what they're trying to confirm in the implementation of these projects is that they can reliably bill for this.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen McKenna]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2955.703">Right,</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2956.443">Actually,</a>  a friend from INGRID who's working somehow on some aspect of the Lowell project was asking me that question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2967.505">I'm</a>  sure they'll figure something out.</p>

    <p>[L5Dn-1_BzKM_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2971.906">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2972.467">I</a>  am confident that they will. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2975.587">And</a>  Barry?</p>

    <p>[Barry Ingber]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2977.788">Yeah,</a>  I guess I'm not really grasping this really well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=2984.806">My</a>  question is, is there really a need for a utility in order to employ this technology, or is this a bailout program for the gas utilities?</p>

    <p>[L5Dn-1_BzKM_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3002.919">I</a>  think it certainly could be a bailout program.</p>

    <p>[Barry Ingber]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3007.063">Well,</a>  I mean, could it be done more economically efficiently without them is kind of the question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3012.988">Or</a>  would they simply be replaced with a different utility, in which case, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3019.493">And</a>  that's what I'm not understanding.</p>

    <p>[L5Dn-1_BzKM_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3021.684">Yeah,</a>  and that's been my understanding of it is the utilities under law have rights of way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3032.13">They</a>  have control of certain areas and distribution <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3046.126">Uh,</a>  you know, running lines in the streets, et cetera. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3049.929">Um.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3051.07">And</a>  so for a private company, for instance, to attempt to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3056.974">I</a>  would get quite complicated and would basically be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3061.977">Would</a>  need utility permissions, uh, would need to basically. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3068.462">Displace</a>  or replace a lot of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3073.345">So,</a>  unless we were to set up a geothermal utility program totally separate from, this seems to be a way to just retool the gas companies towards that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3096.059">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3096.46">I</a>  think it's still really early days.</p>

    <p>[Barry Ingber]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3098.601">So,</a>  if I'm understanding <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3102.707">you,</a>  it sounds like most likely, we aren't sure, but most likely we would need either a geothermal utility or we would need a gazillion private little companies that were competing for our street in our neighborhood. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3120.747">or</a>  we could use the existing utilities, in which case it doesn't trouble me to bail them out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3127.572">It</a>  sounds like that might be the most efficient way to do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3132.915">My</a>  question is more if we're adding an extra layer of capitalism to something that doesn't need to be.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3140.944">Well,</a>  I think there would be economies of scale, too, of doing it at that larger size, rather than each individual residential person, household doing their own.</p>

    <p>[Barry Ingber]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3154.552">Well,</a>  maybe, except if each residential household has it just as part of their, it's part of the building, then you're not having to have pipes going up and down the street at all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3166.159">I</a>  mean, you're just doing it locally. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3172.723">These</a>  are engineering issues that I don't know.</p>

    <p>[L5Dn-1_BzKM_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3176.507">Geothermal</a>  on a residential scale is quite costly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3180.088">And</a>  I mean, there are huge incentives for it at the moment, but it's still, as an owner, you would have to fork out many tens of thousands of dollars to drill a few wells. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3195.432">And</a>  then you might find out that it's not a great site for you, unfortunately. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3200.794">So</a>  there's risk and significant investment on an individual scale.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001610_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3208.075">Barry,</a>  to your question too, it sounds like an interesting idea for something like a public utility district or like a municipal co-op kind of structure that could still operate on that scale, but would be, you know, more beholden to, you know, having an elected board or something from the community it operates in.</p>

    <p>[Barry Ingber]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3232.726">It</a>  looks like Paul is speaking, but his sound is off.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001610_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3238.688">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3241.229">How</a>  deep can a homeowner drill? <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3245.17">Can</a>  I drill a mile down?</p>

    <p>[L5Dn-1_BzKM_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3249.996">On</a>  deep drilling, actually, that's a good question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3254.098">Cornell</a>  University and a couple of other universities have ultra deep wells to see if they can actually get to true geothermal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3265.521">So</a>  there's misnomer there, geothermal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3268.622">is</a>  what you get in Iceland, where there is actually like lava nearby. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3275.746">But</a>  what we are currently doing here in Massachusetts is called ground source heat pumps, where basically we're just using this layer of earth to dump heat, like a radiator into that space, rather than into the air, which the air source heat pumps do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3295.436">And</a>  there's also water source heat pumps, you can do it into the ocean or into a lake or into a river. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3301.819">But</a>  that's basically just running coils into a medium and dumping your heat there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3308.663">Whereas</a>  geothermal is like, yeah, you're taking heat from a heat source.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001610_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3315.266">But</a>  Cornell does have like a super deep... That puts to sleep my plans for the well I had in the backyard they discovered.</p>

    <p>[L5Dn-1_BzKM_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3322.988">I</a>  think it is challenging to get that deep. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3327.329">Institutional</a>  scale.</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3332.671">Alrighty,</a>  I'm gonna grab the reins for a second. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3335.331">I</a>  think we've gone a little over, but I think that was really interesting conversation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3339.712">I</a>  do appreciate you taking the time on that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3343.755">I</a>  wanna throw it to Brenda to talk about our monthly updates, what's going on in the world, going on in Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3353.16">Please</a>  tell us what's happening.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3355.821">Sure,</a>  I'll try to run through this relatively quickly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3360.363">For</a>  Electrify Medford, so far we've had 95 signups. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3365.246">We've</a>  coached 35 people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3368.307">We've</a>  had a couple drop off along the way as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3373.489">I</a>  was speaking with someone from Heat Smart Alliance a couple of weeks ago, and they said that's not a bad ratio of signups to coaching session, but we're still hoping to do better. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3386.675">So</a>  we'll see if some tweaks we're making can change that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3392.078">But</a>  we had a bunch of people trying to get coaching sessions in right before the holidays. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3398.64">So</a>  in the last week before the holidays, I coached four people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3406.131">We</a>  were accepted into Mass Saves Community First Partnership Program for 2025 through 2027. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3411.016">52</a>  municipalities are going to be part of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3417.66">We'll</a>  be signing an MOU and an NDA and other paperwork soon, and then we'll have an orientation on February 6th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3425.046">But</a>  from my perspective, I think the most useful part of this is just the connection with the Mass Save program, getting up-to-date information, getting data on installations in Medford, and doing outreach with them, including bill inserts and things like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3445.482">So</a>  I'm really excited about that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3450.047">Um,</a>  we had a table at the winter extravaganza on December 4th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3457.27">Um,</a>  that was interesting because there were, there were a lot of people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3461.569">who</a>  were really in need. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3463.129">There</a>  were a lot of people there to get winter coats and hats and things like that and get connected to services. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3472.172">But</a>  they were less interested in Electrify Medford than in a lot of the other programs that were represented there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3479.374">So</a>  although it was maybe the audience that we were looking to reach, it wasn't necessarily the best place to reach them, I think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3490.133">We</a>  are going to have an event at the library on January 16th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3496.596">Steve</a>  Bright from the Heat Smart Alliance will be speaking about heat pumps. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3501.618">And</a>  then we'll do an office hours type of setup with energy coaches sort of distributed in different areas so people can do sort of abbreviated coaching sessions with them instead of just doing a sign up and then us trying to reach them later.</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3520.316">And</a>  what time is that event?</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3522.318">Oh,</a>  it's 7 o'clock. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3529.246">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3529.667">I</a>  think that's it for Electrify Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3534.192">For</a>  the Andrews and McGlynn HVAC upgrades project, <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3541.569">The</a>  $5 million bond for that passed the first reading in city council on December 17th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3549.115">Then</a>  we're going to be doing a committee of the whole meeting to discuss it in more detail with them, hopefully on January 14th, although that hasn't been scheduled quite yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3558.382">And</a>  then they'll do a third reading soon after that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3563.953">And</a>  this is for the pre-construction services through April and pre-ordering some of the equipment with long lead times. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3573.017">So</a>  we're hoping that if we are able to pre-order the equipment, then we'll be able to get the bulk of this disruptive work done during the summer and that we'll have cooling in the classrooms in time for the new school year to start. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3587.887">We're</a>  anticipating a $25 million bond in April for the actual construction work, but we'll have a more precise number for that once we've onboarded the construction manager and had a guaranteed maximum price agreed on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3602.107">And</a>  we're putting out an RFP for that construction manager at risk tomorrow. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3607.553">And</a>  we are expecting to onboard them by the middle of February once we have that bond approved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3617.765">And</a>  yeah, I think that's it for that project for now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3625.078">Um,</a>  Andrew's solar project, we finally signed the contract for that, um, which is good because it needed to be done by the end of 2024 in order for us to use the ARPA funding for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3637.366">Um,</a>  and now for the ARPA funding, the project needs to be done by the end of 2025, but we expect it, it'll be finished before the summer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3646.553">Um,</a>  and it's 258 Watts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3653.079">And</a>  then also for Andrews.</p>

    <p>[L5Dn-1_BzKM_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3654.702">Also</a>  for Andrews.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3665.846">The</a>  electrical work was done there to put more circuits on the emergency generator so that the building can be used as an emergency shelter during a power outage. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3679.334">So</a>  that's something that we've been talking about for a long time, too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3683.016">So</a>  I'm happy that that's done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3685.037">So</a>  right now, it's just a regular generator. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3690.781">But</a>  we are hoping in the future to have that be <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3695.263">that</a>  backup be battery storage instead. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3697.524">So</a>  this was a first step. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3701.286">So</a>  it can be off grid if necessary right now, and then we can work towards making it more environmentally friendly as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3716.872">I</a>  wanted to mention this isn't Medford specific but I did want to mention that there was a public meeting in December about recommendations for a statewide building decarbonization clearinghouse. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3730.893">that</a>  would be operational in 2028. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3734.394">So</a>  VEIC created this report for the state, and so they had a couple of different options that they were discussing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3747.337">One</a>  being just using the current Mass Save electric PAs as the <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3755.449">as</a>  the administrators of this program. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3757.51">So</a>  this would take the place of Mass Save, essentially. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3761.652">So</a>  one thing would be just using the electric PAs, cutting the gas PAs out of it completely. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3766.054">And</a>  municipal light plants would be served as part of this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3772.683">either</a>  by an existing program administrator or they could select one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3779.549">If</a>  they didn't already have one, they could select one together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3782.292">And</a>  they would still be accountable to the Department of Public Utilities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3787.937">Another</a>  option that was discussed was creating a new statewide entity that was quasi-governmental that would be accountable not to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3797.067">Department</a>  of Public Utilities, but to a board of directors and the executive and legislative branches here in the state. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3804.431">Sort</a>  of like a Efficiency Maine or Efficiency Vermont, something like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3810.32">So</a>  they were getting feedback about what preferences people had in terms of those options. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3821.786">This</a>  would be focused more on greenhouse gas emissions targets rather than energy reduction. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3830.67">It</a>  would be not just looking at three-year plans, but also creating 10-year plans as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3836.652">So</a>  looking farther out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3839.294">possibly</a>  removing the cost effectiveness requirement, which really limits a lot of what the Mass Save can do right now, and pulling in additional non-rate payer funding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3852.665">So</a>  I think, yeah, I think that's part of the thought of it not being utilities sort of broadens what people are thinking about in terms of funding for these programs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3869.687">So</a>  I think this is really interesting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3871.248">I'm</a>  really intrigued by the idea of a new statewide entity that's not run by the utilities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3884.411">And</a>  then, so MassSave back in October filed their three-year plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3891.393">We</a>  don't have any updates on that right now because the DPU hasn't decided what they're approving and they won't be doing that until the end of January. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3900.623">But</a>  part of what the program administrators filed was no fossil fuel incentives. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3909.566">And</a>  that was required in the last climate bill that by this point, we're not gonna be supporting fossil fuels through the program. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3918.149">Heat</a>  pump incentives would drop for some people instead of there being like a flat $10,000 incentive for whole home heat pump. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3928.805">Um,</a>  it would be $3,000 per ton up to $10,000. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3933.549">So</a>  for a lot of people, especially ones with smaller homes, they would, they would have less incentives. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3943.403">And</a>  the heat loan, the 0% interest heat loan, would still be 0% interest, but the term of it would change based on your income level. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3952.592">So</a>  if you are, you know, more moderate income, then you would still have the full seven year term. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3961.26">But</a>  if you have higher income, then it could be as low as three years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3970.666">All</a>  of which I thought was pretty reasonable, actually. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3973.749">They</a>  also designated 21 equity communities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3980.616">Medford</a>  isn't one of them, unfortunately. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3984.299">These</a>  communities would have more incentives, especially for low and moderate income residents. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=3995.565">which</a>  people are very excited about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4001.818">It's</a>  also the most expensive plan ever for over the three years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4006.142">It's</a>  $5 billion, which makes me wonder if the DPU is going to approve all of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4013.428">So</a>  we're just waiting and seeing until the end of January to see what happens there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4018.732">But</a>  we'll get training directly from MassSave on the programs at our February orientation for the Community First Partnership. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4029.757">And</a>  that's it for me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4031.898">Any</a>  questions, comments on any of those updates?</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4048.908">Oh,</a>  Josh.</p>

    <p>[Josh Ekhart-Lee]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4052.214">Sorry,</a>  they hid the hands up in the React tab, and I haven't yet gotten used to it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4056.537">Brenda,</a>  I just want to ask, is there a best way for this community and this committee to engage with the Mass Save Community First partnership? <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4068.564">How</a>  do you expect us to relate to, or is it just information sharing? <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4076.369">And</a>  you're muted, I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4080.187">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4083.068">Yeah,</a>  so I mean, a lot of it is information sharing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4087.029">A</a>  lot of it is through, a lot of what we do is going to be through Electrify Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4093.93">So</a>  if you want to get more involved in Electrify Medford, we're always looking for more coaches. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4099.832">So</a>  we'd love to have you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4102.632">And</a>  if you have any suggestions as we're going along for ways that we can get the word out to people, <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4111.991">definitely</a>  let me know.</p>

    <p>[Josh Ekhart-Lee]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4113.131">Thanks,</a>  I had a great time being coached by one of your coaches, so thoroughly into it.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4122.695">Nice.</a> </p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4128.898">Alrighty,</a>  any other thoughts, questions, concerns? <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4135.681">Alright,</a>  seeing none, I'm going to launch into a brief <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4143.153">Discussion</a>  of what I. A vision I've had for this committee in many ways that we. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4153.035">Meet</a>  every month and we discuss a lot of really interesting ideas. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4157.276">We</a>  talk about problems in the world and things we'd like to see done, but I'm. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4163.337">Coming</a>  from a background in advocacy, and I see a lot of very talented and smart and committed people in a room, so I want to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4173.964">potentially</a>  for the foreseeable future, set aside a little bit of time at the end of every meeting to discuss certain initiatives that people are opting to take on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4186.312">I</a>  have put together three action plans for myself. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4191.276">One</a>  very easy, two a little harder, but things that I'm holding myself to and want to get your opinions on and get your volunteer and expertise and input on as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4205.423">The</a>  hope is that we have a space at the end of these meetings where we can discuss progress we're making, hurdles we're facing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4215.93">And</a>  ask for general advice going forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4219.793">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4224.598">I</a>  know I sent out an email blast to everybody to brainstorm ideas for initiatives, things that they want to see done throughout the course of this year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4237.383">So</a>  I'd love to open the floor if people have thoughts of things they'd like to tackle throughout the year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4245.726">We'll</a>  keep this brief because I want to be respectful of your time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4249.607">Just</a>  know I will be <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4253.057">doing</a>  my absolute darndest to keep us all accountable to each other and talking about these projects so that we can make recommendations and use this position productively.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001758_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4269.234">Will,</a>  are you talking? <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4271.236">I</a>  mean, we are new, so how do you propose we</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4275.723">Yeah,</a>  so the example I can give here is I have a pretty simple version I'm calling the Better Bag Ban. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4287.57">We</a>  had discussed last month our bag ordinance was incomplete. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4293.274">We</a>  banned those super thin film plastic bags from restaurants and stores. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4300.36">But</a>  I think one of the easiest things we could do is make recommendations to our council members and to the mayor to finish the job and push for a thicker bag ban for Medford so that no plastic is being used. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4313.97">For</a>  any of our backs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4318.453">So</a>  there's 1 that we can begin using our position and our. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4322.575">Ability</a>  to commune with the council people to make that recommendation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4327.177">And</a>  if things are not moving along, we can also begin the groundwork of petitioning. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4333.32">And</a>  talking to folks and neighbors about getting something like that done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4338.493">So</a>  that's sort of an example of a nice, easy initiative that I think we could push forward and hopefully generate something that is productive in the next couple of months.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4352.876">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4353.936">Well,</a>  I know we had like a priorities list from last year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4358.477">I</a>  just dropped that into the chat. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4360.438">Are</a>  you collecting these in that list or another list or how are you doing that?</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4367.53">Something</a>  I was ready to do, time now being of the essence, I was ready for people to potentially read off the things that are most interesting to them, seeing as things like our priority lists through Google Docs and Excel sheets kind of struggle. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4387.359">But</a>  the idea is to hopefully have projects that we can come back to over and over. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4393.857">So</a>  if people would like to add an official statement of a thing they want to get done, I would love to use the priority projects list here.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001758_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4403.604">So</a>  you want us to add to the priority program or against whatever is written there already?</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4413.571">I</a>  would love it if you found an action that was most motivating to you, something you'd like to take on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4422.184">These</a>  are examples. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4423.405">These</a>  are things that we've talked about in the past, but if they don't inspire you, drop them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4427.968">I'd</a>  rather you do the thing that motivates you and that we can then help you towards going forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4438.534">But</a>  this doesn't have to be now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4442.256">We</a>  have about a minute before I want to move to new business and towards a journey. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4448.655">But</a>  I wanted to at least vocalize this to everybody to begin thoughts churning, people thinking about what they want to get done, and hopefully setting aside time for these kinds of projects going forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4465.206">Yeah,</a>  Barry.</p>

    <p>[Barry Ingber]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4468.128">Well,</a>  two things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4469.308">One,</a>  and I don't want to put either of them on the list. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4475.028">The</a>  first one is simpler and I'd consider putting it on the list, which is, is there a way for our committee to publicize that information that Bob sent out or <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4494.727">the</a>  meat of that information, which is the scamming involved in door-to-door and phone sales of electric supply, and also the scamming involved in a lot of sales of solar. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4515.362">We</a>  need to protect our residents from this, people who are either trying to save money or who are trying to save the planet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4524.658">and</a>  who are doing nothing for either of those purposes but padding the pockets of scammers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4533.746">And</a>  I think we have a role there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4539.551">The</a>  second thing, which I definitely don't want to put on the list, is just to make people aware that <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4546.248">Luke</a>  and I have been working for, I don't know, two years more on trying to expand the solar roof ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4556.279">And</a>  we've hit some barriers, but we're still working on trying to figure out how to make that happen, how to <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4570.137">ensure</a>  that development results in the creation of solar panels that benefit the community instead of benefiting private enterprises. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4581.524">And</a>  I had like a five second conversation with Josh at an unrelated meeting and he expressed interest. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4590.789">So</a>  Josh, you should give us your email or get in touch with us and we can, I can send you some stuff.</p>

    <p>[Josh Ekhart-Lee]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4599.707">Yeah,</a>  Brenda's got it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4601.208">I'd</a>  love to get stuck in.</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4607.113">I</a>  think I would.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001610_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4609.034">Oh,</a>  yes, Paul. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4609.835">If</a>  you need me.</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4613.397">I'm</a>  sorry, one more time, Paul.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001610_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4617.52">I'd</a>  like to get involved in that, too, so if Barry and Luca need</p>

    <p>[Barry Ingber]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4627.81">We're</a>  trying to avoid having it be an official committee project is part of what we're doing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4635.312">So</a>  I'm just afraid that if we have, so we're trying to find people with expertise, whether they're on the committee or not in this arena. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4652.994">But</a>  I mean, if we get to the point where we have a half a dozen committee members, it's clearly a committee project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4659.617">And</a>  there's reasons that we don't want it to be that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4671.183">But</a>  Paul, if you're dying to be part of this,</p>

    <p>[MCM00001610_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4676.831">I'm</a>  not dying. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4678.172">I'd</a>  like to discuss that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4681.413">But</a>  yes, anyway. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4684.594">I'd</a>  just like to, that's all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4686.695">So</a>  if you need any help, even if it is administrative, I'll be happy to help out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4696.419">OK,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4700.16">Loretta?</a> </p>

    <p>[EO-vAhUJAKo_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4702.241">Yeah,</a>  I like Barry's idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4704.738">And</a>  I don't know who would take the lead on that, but I have a lot of knowledge about the do not knock policy that I worked with. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4714.347">So</a>  Barry, if it ends up being you, so it takes a lead on, I'll call it do not knock. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4723.275">Please</a>  feel free to reach out to me and I can share the knowledge I have about that.</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4734.113">Fantastic,</a>  and I'm starting to add some of my things into this doc as we find useful.</p>

    <p>[EO-vAhUJAKo_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4740.959">Yeah,</a>  are you going to email that again and we can add our thoughts to it?</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4746.003">Yes,</a>  it's currently in the chat, but I will send out an email once again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4750.447">We</a>  should double check though that your email is correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4754.991">At</a>  some point during the week, if you weren't getting the minutes, we should make sure that that's ameliorated.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001758_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4762.955">Well,</a>  one quick question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4764.316">Oh,</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[EO-vAhUJAKo_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4765.576">At</a>  one point, Brenda was sending out everything to the MEC email. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4771.079">Is</a>  she still, so we should send it to Brenda and then she forwards it to everybody?</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4775.742">Uh,</a>  well, I had also sent out something through the MEC email list. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4782.465">Uh,</a>  so hopefully that was received, but if it's not, we should double check it.</p>

    <p>[EO-vAhUJAKo_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4786.788">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4789.598">I</a>  mean, I had some thoughts, you know, things, you know, we're running out of time here, but it would be nice to continue working on the rodenticide issues, but, you know, it can't just be me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4804.826">I'm</a>  working with the Trees Medford group and a few other projects that are coming up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4809.888">So</a>  one you're aware of that you attended a meeting on, which is a private thing, but environmentally focused. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4819.229">So</a>  with the rodenticide, it needs more time for people to research some of this information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4826.915">Like</a>  I've heard that Arlington has banned the SCARS rodenticides and a few other towns have too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4835.162">So</a>  it'd be good to get a copy of their ordinance, but I don't wanna go against the city and the health department and what they're doing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4842.147">So,</a>  I know some of the alternatives have been very expensive, but maybe not because you could just say, we're not using these anymore. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4850.974">They</a>  kill our natural predators of rodents.</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4857.263">Yeah,</a>  so I mean, collecting that information is a great first start. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4860.506">I</a>  think it's one of those things we have time to mull it over and begin that work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4867.512">But</a>  you shouldn't have to bear it all by yourself. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4869.113">That's</a>  why we're all here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4871.876">I</a>  see Lois has had her hand up patiently for a minute.</p>

    <p>[Lois Grossman]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4876.079">Yeah,</a>  as I mentioned at the beginning, I'm particularly interested in this restaurant business. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4883.045">And</a>  I just wondered if anybody else is.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001610_SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4887.119">I'd</a>  be interested in working on it with you.</p>

    <p>[Lois Grossman]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4889.76">Pardon?</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001610_SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4890.64">I</a>  would be interested in working on it with you.</p>

    <p>[Lois Grossman]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4895.142">OK,</a>  it just we we can get together privately and come up with a plan and run it by the group. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4906.046">Sounds</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4908.087">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001758_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4910.777">I</a>  haven't figured out how to do the raise hand on this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4913.858">So</a>  I'm just going to quickly interject. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4917.899">I'm</a>  very passionate about Zero Waste Medford and I see already the waste reductions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4923.041">I</a>  would love to speak to folks to potentially have like a, not official, but like dedicated Zero Waste Medford volunteer team.</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4934.237">Yes,</a>  I'm putting myself as a point person for that, but please add yourself as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4939.579">I</a>  have a mini action plan I'd like to see done by the end of the year, and I'd love to get your help. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4948.782">And</a>  I saw Josh had their hand up in the final moments.</p>

    <p>[Josh Ekhart-Lee]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4953.844">Yeah,</a>  I just wanted to say, <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4956.771">Loretta,</a>  I'm more than happy to connect you with Colin Ziegler and Alicia in the city of Somerville who are doing some pretty cool innovative rodenticide rat birth control efforts now, which are interesting and don't affect sort of higher tier species. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4973.04">So</a>  I don't wanna do that work like a lot with you, I'm sorry, but I'd be more than happy to act as a connector with the resources I have access to.</p>

    <p>[EO-vAhUJAKo_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4981.924">And</a>  who was that in Somerville?</p>

    <p>[Josh Ekhart-Lee]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4984.506">Colin</a>  Ziegler runs that program.</p>

    <p>[EO-vAhUJAKo_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4987.99">Oh,</a>  okay, because I know Winchester was trying it too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4992.091">Okay,</a>  maybe we can email each other.</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=4997.332">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5003.333">I've</a>  successfully thrown that, accepted that idea, thrown that grenade into conversation, but I think we're nearing the end. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5011.935">I'd</a>  love to open up the floor for new business. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5016.531">Any</a>  parting thoughts, things we are thinking about as we head into the new year?</p>

    <p>[Robert Paine]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5029.598">Well,</a>  this is Bob Payne. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5030.699">We</a>  usually, maybe we did establish a date for the Harvest Uranogy Festival, but we usually do that early in the year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5038.043">And</a>  we usually do it the Saturday after Columbus Day, or well, sorry, Indigenous Peoples Day.</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5045.136">Yeah,</a>  I will add that to the agenda for next month. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5048.537">I</a>  didn't know.</p>

    <p>[Robert Paine]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5049.777">And</a>  I guess usually Brenda, you should check to see if the mayor is available. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5054.138">If</a>  the mayor should be involved, see what her schedule is.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5058.819">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5059.159">I'll</a>  confirm with the mayor and with Alicia.</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5061.24">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5063.16">And</a>  I will be hopefully pushing to get her to join maybe our March meeting or March, maybe April.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5078.47">Yeah,</a>  I know she has school committee every other Monday night, but it sometimes overlaps with this meeting and sometimes doesn't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5087.875">So</a>  maybe we can reach out to her about coming in March. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5092.678">And</a>  if that doesn't work, we can say April.</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5098.401">Yeah,</a>  well, we'll push and pull and make sure that it works out.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5108.741">We</a>  had talked about having a presentation from someone from Zero Waste Melrose. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5113.906">I</a>  haven't had any luck contacting them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5118.35">Have</a>  you, Bob?</p>

    <p>[Robert Paine]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5120.792">I</a>  sent an email. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5121.592">All</a>  they did is add me to their Google list. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5124.995">They</a>  didn't respond at all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5126.557">So</a>  they don't want to talk to me.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5129.92">We'll</a>  keep that up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5131.021">Pravita,</a>  do you have any contacts there that you could reach out to?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001758_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5135.365">I've</a>  been in contact with Zero Waste Arlington, Zero Waste Cambridge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5139.366">I</a>  haven't spoken to any, definitely more so with Cambridge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5144.768">I</a>  don't know any contact in Melrose.</p>

    <p>[Robert Paine]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5149.93">Yeah,</a>  it doesn't have to be Melrose either. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5151.85">They</a>  don't have a monopoly.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001758_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5153.451">I</a>  could reach out to Zero Waste Cambridge and Arlington.</p>

    <p>[Robert Paine]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5157.352">OK,</a>  we'll try those. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5160.053">Maybe</a>  they can make a presentation or something in a future meeting.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen McKenna]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5164.214">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5170.962">All</a>  righty, we've hit eight o'clock, the bell tolls. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5176.306">Do</a>  I hear any movements, any motions?</p>

    <p>[L5Dn-1_BzKM_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5180.329">Motion</a>  to adjourn. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5183.411">And</a>  seconded.</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5185.493">Fantastic,</a>  anyone opposed? <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5189.936">All</a>  right, seeing none, I bid you all farewell. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5195.67">Wonderful</a>  meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5197.051">Please,</a>  if you need anything, reach out to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5199.393">I</a>  can resend this priorities list. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5204.377">Hopefully</a>  everyone has my email, but if not, I'll just throw it in the chat. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5209.221">Do</a>  with it what you need. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5210.422">Do</a>  with it what you will.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5212.995">I</a>  think maybe I should send an email, a list out of everyone's contact info so that the folks can talk to each other outside of this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5222.161">That</a>  would be great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5224.783">And</a>  don't feel hemmed in by this existing priorities list from last year.</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5229.345">Oh</a>  gosh, yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5230.806">It's</a>  such a patchwork of things we've just talked about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5233.748">I</a>  was like frantically taking notes, trying to piece it together, change whatever needs to be changed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5241.733">And</a>  then we should be golden. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5243.115">But</a>  again, also it's all optional. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5246.019">Like</a>  if you're overwhelmed, work's got you down. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5248.984">Don't</a>  take on more than you can handle. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5251.527">Take</a>  on the things that inspire you and we can help out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5256.835">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5258.197">I</a>  have no more sway over you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5260.601">You</a>  are gone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5261.101">Have</a>  a wonderful rest of your month. <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5263.985">Take</a>  care.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5264.446">I'll</a>  see you all February.</p>

    <p>[rov34HMcKiU_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/energy-and-environment-01-06-25&start=5265.367">Thank</a>  you.</p>
