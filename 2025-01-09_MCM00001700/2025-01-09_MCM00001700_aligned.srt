1
00:00:01,426 --> 00:00:08,027
Uh, let's start with a quick roll call to get started and then we should just go into probably some introductions.

2
00:00:08,527 --> 00:00:09,468
Talk about what's going on.

3
00:00:10,848 --> 00:00:13,829
Um, but it feels right to start with a roll call anyways.

4
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:15,229
I'll go right down the list here.

5
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:17,829
Uh, starting with Josh.

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:19,390
Present.

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:19,850
Hi folks.

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:20,850
Hello.

9
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:26,571
Uh, Lois here, Benji.

10
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:27,451
I'm here.

11
00:00:29,332 --> 00:00:30,772
Barry here.

12
00:00:32,248 --> 00:00:32,588
Loretta.

13
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:33,669
Here.

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:35,630
Kathleen.

15
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:38,212
Not yet.

16
00:00:38,832 --> 00:00:39,072
Luke.

17
00:00:42,034 --> 00:00:42,474
Present.

18
00:00:42,874 --> 00:00:43,235
Hello.

19
00:00:44,215 --> 00:00:44,655
Prabita.

20
00:00:45,676 --> 00:00:45,996
Here.

21
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:49,658
Dan.

22
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:51,199
Here.

23
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,100
Bob.

24
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:54,741
Present.

25
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:56,723
Jessica.

26
00:00:58,664 --> 00:00:59,044
Not yet.

27
00:01:02,168 --> 00:01:04,913
Kathleen just jumped right in, so I'll add her to our list.

28
00:01:07,897 --> 00:01:10,181
John, I'm not seeing John.

29
00:01:11,282 --> 00:01:12,284
Will Sherwood is here.

30
00:01:12,304 --> 00:01:13,466
And Paul.

31
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:17,770
Not seeing.

32
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:19,432
That's all right.

33
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:20,993
We still have plenty of folks here.

34
00:01:21,013 --> 00:01:26,597
Everyone here was able to look over the minutes from last month.

35
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:31,941
Any addendums, any notes, comments, concerns, haikus?

36
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:38,066
I could offer a follow-up on something.

37
00:01:39,187 --> 00:01:39,487
Please.

38
00:01:40,928 --> 00:01:45,452
Remember I brought up the question of the stretch plastics down at Whole Foods?

39
00:01:46,977 --> 00:01:54,702
So I went down to Whole Foods and talked to somebody there and there's an online website.

40
00:01:54,742 --> 00:02:00,065
I talked to somebody on the phone or chatted on the computer and they sent me to a website.

41
00:02:00,626 --> 00:02:02,046
That was not very helpful.

42
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:07,190
The man I spoke to at the store was not one that I usually see there.

43
00:02:09,111 --> 00:02:12,333
He might've been a regional manager and for the day,

44
00:02:13,316 --> 00:02:21,299
He said that the plastics are collected in-house by Amazon, well, by Whole Foods, which is Amazon.

45
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:29,483
And he doesn't know what they do, but whatever they do, they do in-house.

46
00:02:30,563 --> 00:02:32,064
And that's as far as I've gotten.

47
00:02:33,345 --> 00:02:37,106
He says they do recycle them, but he doesn't know how.

48
00:02:38,727 --> 00:02:40,748
And I haven't been able to,

49
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:44,955
get high enough up the corporate ladder to get a person who does know.

50
00:02:47,996 --> 00:02:52,098
But it's in-house is that much I learned.

51
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,579
That is a good addendum.

52
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:55,699
I'm glad you followed up.

53
00:02:56,539 --> 00:03:00,001
We will maybe have time to discuss more of that soon.

54
00:03:00,021 --> 00:03:04,023
Yeah, I do appreciate that, actually.

55
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,751
All right, I would entertain a motion to accept our minutes and move forward.

56
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:14,832
So moved.

57
00:03:16,432 --> 00:03:18,133
Fantastic, we'll go down the line.

58
00:03:18,153 --> 00:03:20,273
All in favor.

59
00:03:20,473 --> 00:03:21,253
You need a second.

60
00:03:21,413 --> 00:03:22,174
Oh, yep, thank you.

61
00:03:22,194 --> 00:03:22,654
I second.

62
00:03:24,294 --> 00:03:24,634
Thank you.

63
00:03:26,214 --> 00:03:28,575
All in favor, let's go down the line.

64
00:03:30,155 --> 00:03:30,555
Josh.

65
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:31,716
Abstain.

66
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:32,796
Thank you.

67
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:59,396

68
00:04:04,694 --> 00:04:06,175
Oh, Luke.

69
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:08,856
Accept.

70
00:04:10,537 --> 00:04:10,937
Rebita.

71
00:04:10,957 --> 00:04:12,698
Abstain.

72
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:16,059
Dan.

73
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:17,900
Accept.

74
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:19,201
Bob.

75
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:20,361
Accept.

76
00:04:22,602 --> 00:04:26,884
And I accept as well.

77
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:27,945
The yeas have it.

78
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:33,755
I'd love to begin the meeting formally.

79
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:48,933
I think something I'd like to start off with is just a brief introduction from our 2 newest members, and then we can maybe go around and just do a quick who's who in all these boxes here.

80
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:55,818
our name, what we're doing, maybe a focus we have.

81
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,001
Yeah, we'll start there.

82
00:04:59,822 --> 00:05:06,428
So we'll start with name, maybe what you're doing for work, and how long you've been on this panel.

83
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:07,810
Seems fitting.

84
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,155
But I'd love to start with Josh.

85
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:15,152
Hi, folks.

86
00:05:15,412 --> 00:05:15,832
Thanks, Will.

87
00:05:16,593 --> 00:05:17,793
I'm Josh Eckert-Lee.

88
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:19,214
I use he, him pronouns.

89
00:05:19,554 --> 00:05:24,095
I live over on Main Street between Bob's and Oasis in South Medford.

90
00:05:25,676 --> 00:05:34,359
I'm really excited to be with you all tonight and hopefully for some amount of foreseeable future as I get involved here in Medford.

91
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:37,540
In my day job, I bike

92
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:51,061
10 minutes down the road and work for the city of Somerville as one of their sustainability planners, where I mostly work on sort of emissions reduction work, green building review, green zoning initiatives, and then electric mobility.

93
00:05:51,121 --> 00:05:56,544
So as we do that kind of work here in Medford, I'd love to get stuck in with you on that.

94
00:05:57,585 --> 00:05:59,045
I'm happy to be here.

95
00:05:59,085 --> 00:06:05,489
I've been doing climate organizing with XR Boston and the Sunrise Movement for a number of years, so I'm glad to be

96
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:09,042
getting involved directly and civically with the city.

97
00:06:11,324 --> 00:06:11,784
Thanks for having me.

98
00:06:15,768 --> 00:06:16,548
Fantastic.

99
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,850
I'd also love to hear from Prabita.

100
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:20,272
That is correct.

101
00:06:20,592 --> 00:06:21,413
I'm Prabita.

102
00:06:22,153 --> 00:06:23,715
I'm very happy to be here.

103
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,176
Nice to meet you all.

104
00:06:25,757 --> 00:06:33,083
I think I've met some of you, most of you, in a one-off meeting in November of last year, so very happy to be here.

105
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:34,889
part of this group.

106
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:40,614
And like Josh said, hopefully I can be a part of this team for some time in the future as well.

107
00:06:41,655 --> 00:06:51,783
In terms of day job, I am a clinical scientist working in clinical trials and drug development.

108
00:06:53,144 --> 00:06:58,809
Currently in between jobs, but I'm doing some consulting for small startups as well.

109
00:07:00,423 --> 00:07:24,020
my main focus, passion or something that's been consuming me since the pandemic has been sustainability as well but in terms of waste reduction, zero waste, low waste initiatives and quite passionate about that and I know you guys all are as well so I'm very excited to work with you all.

110
00:07:29,823 --> 00:07:30,623
Fantastic.

111
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,885
Now I'm just going to run right down across my screen.

112
00:07:34,025 --> 00:07:41,870
We can just do a quick name, pronoun, and just a quick 30 seconds about yourself.

113
00:07:43,051 --> 00:07:44,451
I missed the pronoun, sorry.

114
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:45,052
She, her.

115
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,352
Thank you so much.

116
00:07:47,793 --> 00:07:50,915
And we should start in my top left with Brenda.

117
00:07:53,941 --> 00:08:01,083
I hope everybody knows me by now, but Brenda Pike, she, her, I'm the climate planner for the city of Medford.

118
00:08:02,123 --> 00:08:13,046
A lot of what I do is working on building improvements for the city and also in the

119
00:08:13,485 --> 00:08:20,008
Other on the flip side of that, um, outreach to residents about things that they can do themselves to their own homes.

120
00:08:21,188 --> 00:08:32,173
Um, and I, I, I work with this, uh, committee and also with the climate equity councils, and there's a lot of overlap in the, in the things that we talk about with both groups.

121
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,155
Going right along, uh, Lois.

122
00:08:45,895 --> 00:08:52,020
My professional work is Spanish language, formerly teaching, currently editing.

123
00:08:53,801 --> 00:09:01,748
I was on the first environmental committee that the city put together back in the last century, I think.

124
00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:02,969
And I,

125
00:09:06,982 --> 00:09:12,966
Now I'm serving on this new version and enjoying it very much.

126
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:16,749
And I'm passionate about recycling above all.

127
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:24,995
And I'm really interested in getting better recycling out of restaurant takeout containers.

128
00:09:29,198 --> 00:09:29,979
Fantastic.

129
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:31,320
I'm going to throw it right to Bob.

130
00:09:36,587 --> 00:09:41,568
I've been on this committee and the predecessor that Lois was on, the wind turbine committee.

131
00:09:42,328 --> 00:09:44,889
We started in 2004, so it was still this century.

132
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:52,650
So I am a consultant with AECOM as a air quality consultant.

133
00:09:52,670 --> 00:10:02,212
So I deal with air pollution issues and advise the committee, advise the wind committee on meteorology and this committee on air pollution issues.

134
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:06,964
and is one of our Electrify Medford coaches.

135
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:09,286
Right.

136
00:10:10,326 --> 00:10:11,908
I may have to call you up on some of those.

137
00:10:12,288 --> 00:10:14,350
I will need a consultation at some point.

138
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:17,292
I'm gonna throw it to Benji next.

139
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:22,577
I'm a retired lawyer.

140
00:10:22,637 --> 00:10:27,361
I did toxic torts and other plaintiff's personal injury cases.

141
00:10:27,381 --> 00:10:31,384
I've been on the committee for, I think it's almost three years now.

142
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:42,086
My energy environment interest comes from having worked with the Clamshell Alliance back in the 70s and 80s.

143
00:10:42,146 --> 00:10:50,692
And actually there's a sort of rebirth of some folks who are still involved in fighting a rear guard action against the attempts to revive the industry.

144
00:10:56,276 --> 00:10:56,897
Up next, Luke.

145
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,187
Hi, Luke McNeely.

146
00:11:00,968 --> 00:11:10,996
I am an architect and energy and efficiency guy, formerly a renewable energy guy for eight years.

147
00:11:11,016 --> 00:11:22,006
I'm amazed to find, and he, him pronouns, I'm amazed to find that I have been on this committee for more than 10 years now, which is fun to think about.

148
00:11:23,807 --> 00:11:27,368
And I currently work for ICF.

149
00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:37,791
We are an energy and environment consulting group that in Massachusetts runs the Mass Save residential new construction incentives.

150
00:11:38,372 --> 00:11:47,214
And my focus in that program is on the passive house multifamily, so big multifamily buildings.

151
00:11:49,395 --> 00:11:50,455
uh, energy efficiency.

152
00:11:51,376 --> 00:12:11,001
And, uh, on this committee, I've been, uh, part of the TREES, uh, effort with Loretta and, uh, General Beck since we did Solarize Medford a while back, uh, just generally supporting many initiatives.

153
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:15,062
Fantastic.

154
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:16,703
Uh, Barry, you're up next.

155
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:19,699
I'm Barry He.

156
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,380
I've been on the committee for 10 years.

157
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,461
I'm retired.

158
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:32,842
I spent I'm a lifelong advocate for social justice and environmental justice.

159
00:12:34,102 --> 00:12:45,285
And I spent my career working in the nonprofit sector, primarily on, but not exclusively on energy issues and low income issues.

160
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:46,605
And

161
00:12:48,763 --> 00:13:00,772
One of my accomplishments was I founded the Green Energy Purchasing Program that is now the major state

162
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:09,603
program that you buy your green energy from through our Medford aggregation or elsewhere.

163
00:13:10,043 --> 00:13:24,070
So I was the executive director of what was then called the Boston Oil Consumers Alliance and after several name changes is now called the Green Energy Consumers Alliance.

164
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,191
Welcome name change.

165
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:26,872
Loretta,

166
00:13:31,387 --> 00:13:33,448
Hi, Loretta James.

167
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:37,231
I've been on the committee over 10 years also.

168
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:44,456
I was involved with the committee on the tree report that we did.

169
00:13:44,476 --> 00:13:47,778
It was a research project that's online on Go Green Medford.

170
00:13:48,238 --> 00:13:54,663
I worked with Luke and a few other people, members that have left.

171
00:13:55,723 --> 00:13:56,224
I'm also

172
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:04,802
One of the lead people for the annual Harvester Energy Festival that we have, and I help coordinate that.

173
00:14:05,402 --> 00:14:17,025
And I'm also interested in the past few years, besides tree preservation of our tree canopy and education about the issues with using rodenticides.

174
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,982
that are killing the natural predators.

175
00:14:21,103 --> 00:14:24,966
So that's something that I've been thinking about the past few years.

176
00:14:25,046 --> 00:14:35,836
I've also worked with the health department in educating people on using rat poison and other measures to control, help control the rat population.

177
00:14:36,796 --> 00:14:42,862
And there's a video about that on the city website under the health department, which is excellent.

178
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,363
It was a public education meeting.

179
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:53,496
I have a background in art and design, but also in elevators, and I'm a real estate agent.

180
00:14:53,636 --> 00:15:00,502
I've been on somewhat of a leave recently, but I think I covered everything.

181
00:15:00,602 --> 00:15:03,945
Oh, she, her, and I think that's it.

182
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:05,746
That's great.

183
00:15:06,988 --> 00:15:07,428
Kathleen.

184
00:15:12,524 --> 00:15:24,535
I see her my background in mechanical engineering degree, and I've worked as an energy engineer consulting with see power right now and demand response.

185
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,681
done energy audits.

186
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:30,803
Let's see, what else?

187
00:15:31,344 --> 00:15:35,047
I've been on the, with the group for 10 plus years.

188
00:15:35,187 --> 00:15:41,413
I was a co-solar coach in 2013 for the Solarize program.

189
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:43,015
That was very exciting.

190
00:15:44,516 --> 00:15:46,318
And what else?

191
00:15:46,678 --> 00:15:51,261
I'm interested in recycling and reusing.

192
00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:58,346
And I've noticed at home, my garbage is always smaller than my recycling.

193
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,048
But where it goes, who knows?

194
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:02,349
Thank you.

195
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:04,990
All righty.

196
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,011
Dan, you're up next.

197
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:09,834
Hey, I'm Dan Papo.

198
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:15,205
uh, he, him, uh, so for my day job, I work in the energy industry.

199
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:21,610
Uh, currently focused on optimizing grid scale storage batteries in Texas, California.

200
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:29,095
Uh, but it's been most of my career in renewable energy, uh, developing wind and solar plants and trading around them.

201
00:16:29,115 --> 00:16:35,099
Uh, so something I'm very passionate about, and I think I've been on this committee for probably a little bit over a year.

202
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:39,903
Uh, I see Jessica's up next.

203
00:16:43,157 --> 00:16:44,277
Jessica, she, her.

204
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:59,625
Currently, I'm a project manager for pretty much any energy project on a university campus, but my background is in urban planning and sustainable design and

205
00:17:02,992 --> 00:17:19,822
My main kind of passion or focus is allowing kind of more, I don't know, complex concepts become more easily understandable for anybody, residents, kids, you name it.

206
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:24,764
I really want people to be able to understand all sorts of different concepts that we talk about.

207
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:29,427
And I've been on the committee for almost four years, I think.

208
00:17:32,988 --> 00:17:34,109
And last up is Paul.

209
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:38,532
Can you hear me?

210
00:17:38,552 --> 00:17:40,173
Loud and clear.

211
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:42,134
Yeah.

212
00:17:43,755 --> 00:17:46,096
I'm a biochemist by training.

213
00:17:49,158 --> 00:17:52,620
I've been at it for 40 years.

214
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:55,142
I'm interested in

215
00:17:57,066 --> 00:18:06,812
educating people on how chemicals affect our lives and how they affect the environment.

216
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:13,656
So science education is a big passion of mine.

217
00:18:14,336 --> 00:18:18,339
Educating people is a priority for me.

218
00:18:23,345 --> 00:18:24,926
And I think that just leaves me.

219
00:18:25,827 --> 00:18:28,028
My name is Will, he him pronouns.

220
00:18:29,248 --> 00:18:32,350
I've been on this committee for, I think it's about a year.

221
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,650
I stopped keeping track.

222
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:45,763
Recent chair, but before that, um, I was a outdoor educator, uh, teaching environmental science for, for kids, uh, both here in Boston and out in Alaska.

223
00:18:45,783 --> 00:18:53,586
Uh, and now I am a policy advocate, uh, particular around right to repair, uh, making sure you're allowed to fix your stuff.

224
00:18:54,786 --> 00:18:57,987
Uh, cause that's better for the planet, better for your pocket, the whole bit.

225
00:18:59,582 --> 00:19:01,423
But I think that's it for introductions.

226
00:19:02,144 --> 00:19:04,425
I'm still new enough that that was actually really helpful for me.

227
00:19:06,046 --> 00:19:08,748
So I appreciate you all taking the time to do that with me.

228
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:12,650
Let's see.

229
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:22,096
I want to be mindful of time because I'm not trying to rush, but I am going to make sure that we're cooking right along.

230
00:19:23,157 --> 00:19:27,500
I see an opportunity for some administrative updates from Brenda.

231
00:19:28,816 --> 00:19:32,537
Anything you'd like to throw in now that we all kind of know each other a little better?

232
00:19:34,277 --> 00:19:34,637
Sure.

233
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:41,379
I just want to let people know that we have an opening for an economic development planner in the planning department.

234
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:48,860
We did have someone in that place and she's recently moved back to California.

235
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,701
So we're looking to find someone to do what she's been doing.

236
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:56,362
So in addition to the regular economic development work

237
00:19:56,742 --> 00:19:58,323
that this person would be doing.

238
00:19:58,703 --> 00:20:09,226
They'll also be working with me on a small business outreach for Electrify Medford through the Community First partnership that we're going to be doing with Mass Save.

239
00:20:10,766 --> 00:20:15,147
So I have a definite interest in making sure that we get somebody good for this.

240
00:20:15,207 --> 00:20:20,409
So definitely pass along anyone that you know who might be a good fit.

241
00:20:27,201 --> 00:20:28,081
Fantastic.

242
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:36,304
And the final piece, I see we have 15 minutes allotted for this, but I think we can do it in five if we're feeling brave.

243
00:20:38,384 --> 00:20:44,366
We discussed how difficult it can be to be a chair all by yourself.

244
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:51,088
And some people had thrown in their hats for potential co-chairs, but under duress.

245
00:20:52,972 --> 00:21:02,517
Wasn't sure if anyone had, over the course of the last month, thought it over and decided that this would be a good fit for them.

246
00:21:03,477 --> 00:21:10,081
If so, I'd love to open the floor to that conversation, if anyone's feeling brave and would like to help me out.

247
00:21:22,008 --> 00:21:23,929
You're doing too good a job, Will.

248
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,130
It's exhausting.

249
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:26,851
It's hard work.

250
00:21:28,972 --> 00:21:37,937
But with that, I'd rather give the extra four minutes to Bob, who's been waiting oh so patiently to give his presentation.

251
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,059
And I've been dying to hear it.

252
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,662
Let me see if I can share my screen here.

253
00:21:45,922 --> 00:21:47,523
I can't do it because I'm not

254
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:51,062
I'm disabled and screen sharing.

255
00:21:51,262 --> 00:21:51,583
Yes.

256
00:21:52,123 --> 00:21:52,543
Oh, yeah.

257
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:52,863
Let me.

258
00:21:53,304 --> 00:21:53,804
Okay.

259
00:21:59,367 --> 00:21:59,567
Okay.

260
00:21:59,607 --> 00:22:02,129
I've made you a co-host, so you should be able to do it now.

261
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:02,709
Let's try.

262
00:22:02,749 --> 00:22:03,169
Okay.

263
00:22:03,209 --> 00:22:04,690
Here we go.

264
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,872
Actually, before we jump into that, I think we skipped over.

265
00:22:07,892 --> 00:22:12,855
The next meeting is February 3rd.

266
00:22:15,907 --> 00:22:20,009
And I think we had said that Matt Barlow will be presenting to us.

267
00:22:25,412 --> 00:22:28,233
Were you arranging that, and is that all set?

268
00:22:28,993 --> 00:22:29,233
Yep.

269
00:22:32,455 --> 00:22:32,635
Yep.

270
00:22:32,795 --> 00:22:33,215
Perfect.

271
00:22:33,515 --> 00:22:35,757
Oh, fantastic.

272
00:22:35,837 --> 00:22:41,899
If anybody has any particular requests of what they would like Matt to cover,

273
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:50,920
let me know, either now or shoot me an email, but.

274
00:22:53,741 --> 00:22:56,922
Mary, could you remind us and the new members what is he speaking on?

275
00:22:57,842 --> 00:23:03,244
Okay, so Matt is a climate scientist who lives in North Medford.

276
00:23:04,324 --> 00:23:11,827
He was one of the, he was a lead author on, was it the,

277
00:23:13,613 --> 00:23:19,999
The COPS public, it was on one of the international reports.

278
00:23:22,882 --> 00:23:26,225
So he knows his, he knows his climate science.

279
00:23:26,646 --> 00:23:36,415
And I figured that people here would, I mean, if

280
00:23:37,968 --> 00:23:39,670
We know what we want him to cover.

281
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,012
He will cover that.

282
00:23:41,092 --> 00:23:51,184
Otherwise, he'll probably just cover what we can expect here in Medford and whatever he feels like talking about.

283
00:23:55,633 --> 00:24:08,182
I think it's a nice idea to let him have the floor to speak about what his interests and current research might be, or whatever he thinks is important for Medford.

284
00:24:09,142 --> 00:24:15,026
But yeah, it was the IPCC sixth assessment report.

285
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:19,349
That's a five-year thing, right?

286
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:22,111
Yeah, and that's kind of what

287
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:34,935
Yeah, that it is, it is like the major report on the environment.

288
00:24:35,856 --> 00:24:36,116
Right.

289
00:24:36,157 --> 00:24:42,204
And if I remember correctly, he was the lead author on rainfall precipitation issues.

290
00:24:44,547 --> 00:24:45,027
Oh, great.

291
00:24:54,251 --> 00:25:05,434
I put his UMass Lowell profile into the chat there so that we can look at what publications he's worked on and things like that as well, in case anyone wants some light reading.

292
00:25:08,255 --> 00:25:11,296
He actually has publications that are light reading.

293
00:25:12,236 --> 00:25:15,557
He is interested in public education.

294
00:25:15,637 --> 00:25:23,780
So kind of like Paul on chemicals, he wants stuff to be understandable too.

295
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:27,681
people and like Jessica.

296
00:25:29,883 --> 00:25:30,043
Yeah.

297
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,089
Fantastic.

298
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:35,650
Yeah.

299
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:41,056
So we should all, I think it's worth preparing some questions, making sure we're in the right space for it.

300
00:25:41,076 --> 00:25:43,940
I think it'd be very insightful.

301
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:56,215
All right, I don't think there's any other notes for February 3rd.

302
00:25:56,235 --> 00:25:58,358
I think we're looking good.

303
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:00,061
Bob, it's all yours, please.

304
00:26:01,503 --> 00:26:04,107
Okay, can you see the presentation on your screen?

305
00:26:05,168 --> 00:26:05,989
Yep, looks great.

306
00:26:07,322 --> 00:26:10,125
This was this was law was signed.

307
00:26:10,385 --> 00:26:24,600
It was after the actual session on the legislature, which, which was ended in July, but they actually came back and finish the job, if you will, although there were some elements that weren't included, like this third party.

308
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:30,145
electric provider issue, which I sent a note about a few days ago.

309
00:26:30,725 --> 00:26:31,565
But let's go through it.

310
00:26:31,605 --> 00:26:34,526
The key source is a WBUR summary.

311
00:26:34,566 --> 00:26:37,607
So I'm not going to say I did all this research myself.

312
00:26:37,647 --> 00:26:40,108
I just plagiarized what they provided.

313
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:42,128
So I'll plead guilty right now.

314
00:26:44,629 --> 00:26:49,170
The overview is it builds on previous climate laws.

315
00:26:50,465 --> 00:26:58,090
and provides basically what I would call a mid-course correction for issues that have emerged in the implementation of these earlier laws.

316
00:26:59,111 --> 00:27:15,101
And supposedly it should be now easier and faster to build out some of this infrastructure that is required to meet these goals, which is, I think it's 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from like a 1990 baseline by,

317
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:25,162
2030 and then 75% by 2040 and 100% by 2050, which is pretty aggressive.

318
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:40,967
The current permitting process has been determined to be complicated and tedious, so the new law is trying to make this easier to do, to actually build out what we need to do to stay on track with the climate plans.

319
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:49,693
I think you all got a list, maybe except the new members got an email with this.

320
00:27:50,814 --> 00:27:55,997
This file, but it can be, we can also provide it again.

321
00:27:56,017 --> 00:27:59,619
This this PowerPoint file anyway.

322
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:16,005
The the state energy officials are now getting organized to rank siting preferences for some of these renewable energy projects and to develop a help municipalities to evaluate setting proposals in their towns.

323
00:28:17,727 --> 00:28:17,847
And

324
00:28:18,478 --> 00:28:23,383
Developers are now required to do community outreach and hold public meetings before they obtain permits.

325
00:28:24,283 --> 00:28:41,479
And there's a new state agency, the Office of Environmental Justice and Equity, which Barry will be happy to see, to help individuals, community groups, and municipalities participate in this process and affect

326
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:55,371
The law creates a fund to help stakeholders pay for any intervention in some of these permitting processes.

327
00:28:55,431 --> 00:29:01,176
So if you oppose something, you're supposed to get a fund to help you participate in that.

328
00:29:02,617 --> 00:29:03,618
We'll see how that works out.

329
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:12,337
The cumulative impact analysis is required, CIA, for large renewable and clean energy projects.

330
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:23,058
And the typical thing is how a project might impact local air quality and water quality issues.

331
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:36,011
But also whether there's a community has been experiencing a lot of industrial development, and this project might add to this burden, sort of like an environmental justice issue.

332
00:29:37,473 --> 00:29:46,519
In some cases, developers may have to compensate communities with such a program, like a community benefit agreement.

333
00:29:49,305 --> 00:30:05,071
But the law is trying to go for simpler, faster permits, sort of like, on the one hand, you get a fund to oppose these permits, but they want it to be simpler and faster, maybe to consolidate the reviews into one.

334
00:30:05,731 --> 00:30:14,174
First of all, the permits into one master permit set the deadlines for how long the review process can take and put limits on the appeals process.

335
00:30:14,214 --> 00:30:14,915
So it's sort of like,

336
00:30:17,556 --> 00:30:20,618
opposing things here.

337
00:30:20,658 --> 00:30:28,584
You get money for appealing and opposing a project, but there's limits on the appeals process.

338
00:30:29,825 --> 00:30:30,826
And there's time limits.

339
00:30:32,127 --> 00:30:43,715
They have a definition of what a large clean energy project is, is more than 25 megawatts of power generation or 100 megawatts of battery storage.

340
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:53,618
In which case, the state board will be in charge of the review and has to issue or reject the permit within 15 months.

341
00:30:54,318 --> 00:30:58,120
But for small projects, municipalities will retain control.

342
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:04,802
And I don't know whether Medford is even has experience in this, but I don't know if there's any Medford projects anyway.

343
00:31:07,092 --> 00:31:11,135
The master permit for such projects must be issued or rejected within 12 months.

344
00:31:11,215 --> 00:31:21,622
If a town doesn't have the resources to conduct the review, the state board can handle this anyway.

345
00:31:21,942 --> 00:31:30,968
If the deadline for the permit issuance or rejection is not met within the deadline, it's automatically approved.

346
00:31:32,814 --> 00:31:39,317
except that if too many projects get this automatic approval, the legislation might have to revisit the process anyway.

347
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:42,359
All right.

348
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:47,841
Benji, you're not going to like this, but now clean energy includes nuclear fission.

349
00:31:50,462 --> 00:31:58,846
And Governor Healey is in talks with Connecticut to see if they might get power from Millstone nuclear power plant.

350
00:32:02,832 --> 00:32:09,242
So nuclear is back for clean energy.

351
00:32:13,461 --> 00:32:16,124
It's going to be crucial to find ways to store the energy.

352
00:32:16,424 --> 00:32:21,067
Obviously, that's always been the problem.

353
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:24,991
Renewable energy, you cannot dispatch it.

354
00:32:25,671 --> 00:32:33,638
You cannot say, I want 100 megawatts in the next hour, because the solar energy obviously is diurnal.

355
00:32:34,198 --> 00:32:35,519
Depends on if there's clouds.

356
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:38,942
Wind, of course, depends on the winds blowing.

357
00:32:41,149 --> 00:32:48,915
But if you can store it, you resolve such intermittencies in the availability of renewable energy.

358
00:32:48,995 --> 00:32:51,057
That's the big challenge.

359
00:32:52,017 --> 00:33:01,105
You could do various ways to do this, not just batteries, but pumping and such.

360
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,928
The state has to ramp up a lot in

361
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,231
adding the storage.

362
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:14,116
I can't – I don't know if they're going to be possible to do this by a factor of 10 by 2030.

363
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:21,962
It's only five years away from roughly 500 megawatt hours to 5,000.

364
00:33:23,683 --> 00:33:26,586
So, there's going to be projects on this.

365
00:33:28,687 --> 00:33:33,551
They have to study the question of how to bring

366
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,221
important resources like offshore wind projects and batteries online by July 1.

367
00:33:41,942 --> 00:33:54,085
Now, under the new law, it should be easier to get permission to go solar in historical districts, because now historical commissions have to give substantial weight to the threat posed by climate change.

368
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:57,505
They just can't say, I don't want to see these solar panels.

369
00:34:02,101 --> 00:34:05,063
There's going to be more solar canopies, maybe.

370
00:34:07,084 --> 00:34:09,085
And there's going to be studies on how to do that.

371
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:24,053
The Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs has to monitor EV chargers and make sure they're reliable, widely available, and distributed equitably, and track the prices and frequency of use, et cetera.

372
00:34:26,974 --> 00:34:30,976
And they want to be able to forecast the charging demand.

373
00:34:33,063 --> 00:34:38,505
maybe make electric utilities, make infrastructure investment plans to meet the anticipated demand.

374
00:34:41,685 --> 00:34:59,691
Also, the law wants to have the state allow more pole-mounted and right-of-way chargers so people who park on the street have a way to charge their vehicles, and restricts the ability of homeowners associations to block installations in places like condominiums.

375
00:35:02,546 --> 00:35:14,071
So there's efforts to make charging more widespread basically and overcome what has been basically resistance to that.

376
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:25,215
Also, the issue is, are we gonna be able to ban car dealerships from selling gasoline or diesel powered vehicles after 2035?

377
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:28,597
They're gonna review the feasibility of that.

378
00:35:30,113 --> 00:35:33,694
Of course, I know the Trump administration is not going to like that either.

379
00:35:34,154 --> 00:35:41,096
So, it should be interesting to see how the state and the federal government work on all this or clash on all of this.

380
00:35:44,277 --> 00:35:45,917
Transitioning from natural gas.

381
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:53,399
We don't have a ban on gas companies from building more pipelines and etc.

382
00:35:53,539 --> 00:35:56,420
in their service areas, but there's some new restrictions

383
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:02,921
Utilities could build more network geothermal projects.

384
00:36:05,281 --> 00:36:14,765
And there's also, it's more difficult for loan owners to petition the Department of Public Utilities for a natural gas hookup under the state's right to service laws.

385
00:36:17,405 --> 00:36:24,828
There's the issue now of does the request comply with the goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and whether there's feasible alternatives.

386
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:29,813
There's incentive to gas utilities to replace leaky underground pipes.

387
00:36:29,893 --> 00:36:30,493
That'll be good.

388
00:36:30,513 --> 00:36:41,398
Then the priorities are instead of encouraging costly pipe replacements, Massachusetts will help prioritize short-term repairs or retiring.

389
00:36:42,299 --> 00:36:44,360
Totally retiring stretches the pipeline.

390
00:36:47,341 --> 00:36:51,103
Other notable changes, the Department of Public Utilities

391
00:36:51,922 --> 00:36:57,684
will establish a cheaper electric rate for moderate income residents, like it does for low income residents.

392
00:36:57,724 --> 00:36:58,485
So that'll be good.

393
00:37:00,646 --> 00:37:07,308
Massport has to prioritize greenhouse gas reductions and environmental justice when making decisions about transportation infrastructure.

394
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:16,032
Companies building new electric transmission or distribution lines have to consider hardware and software updates that can make existing power lines more efficient.

395
00:37:17,899 --> 00:37:25,886
And every five years, electric utilities have to file a report about their vulnerability to climate change and plans to increase resiliency.

396
00:37:28,548 --> 00:37:38,195
There's going to be a commission to study how the clean air energy transmission is affecting fossil fuel workers, because there could be less demand for such workers.

397
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:46,602
And it mandates the state to develop new flood risk maps that more accurately depict the risk of inland flooding.

398
00:37:48,682 --> 00:37:51,163
And that's my quick summary.

399
00:37:54,124 --> 00:37:55,784
Could I add a couple of things to that?

400
00:37:56,124 --> 00:37:57,485
You may.

401
00:37:57,545 --> 00:38:05,927
There are a few things that affect us or could affect us more directly, which I was excited to see and hear.

402
00:38:06,547 --> 00:38:14,910
One of them is allowing procurement of electric school buses and charging infrastructure together, which is a bizarre,

403
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:31,625
thing problem that that has crept up where where some municipalities have been waiting a long time after purchasing their buses to actually get the charging infrastructure installed for them, because they weren't allowed to procure them together in the past.

404
00:38:35,338 --> 00:38:40,981
The pole-mounted chargers that you mentioned, Bob, I think that's gonna be a great thing moving forward.

405
00:38:42,122 --> 00:38:52,708
Up until this point, I think there's been a limitation on the ability for incentives to cover pole-mounted chargers.

406
00:38:53,328 --> 00:38:55,689
Josh, you might actually know more about this than I do.

407
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:59,651
I think it's because of the efficiency of them or something, right?

408
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,814
Yeah, you're right on the money, Brenda.

409
00:39:04,155 --> 00:39:10,705
So this should make it easier for us as municipalities to roll them out on our sidewalks where the curb's already kind of busy.

410
00:39:10,725 --> 00:39:13,169
That's great.

411
00:39:15,569 --> 00:39:31,749
It directs the Department of Public Utilities to approve smart meters, which enables two-way communication and it helps to modernize the grid.

412
00:39:33,831 --> 00:39:44,081
to better manage demand, which way back when I was at National Grid, we were trying to get smart meters included and the DPU shot us down.

413
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:47,004
So I find that pretty exciting.

414
00:39:47,545 --> 00:39:58,035
And it's allowing net metering across service territories between different utilities, which is a game changer, I think.

415
00:40:02,618 --> 00:40:13,747
Is there any effort to have meters monitored by people?

416
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:22,835
Like, you know, have an app that says this is how much energy you're using.

417
00:40:27,584 --> 00:40:37,731
Because I think that'll be just a tremendous help to people in saving energy.

418
00:40:37,892 --> 00:40:44,416
I have your meters report to you how much energy you're using.

419
00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:48,779
I know you can buy equipment to do that.

420
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:55,264
You can actually rig up your electrics panel

421
00:40:57,648 --> 00:41:03,897
to give this information to you, but that's an expenditure.

422
00:41:07,669 --> 00:41:08,129
I don't know.

423
00:41:08,169 --> 00:41:13,071
I think I think these step these smart meters could be a step in that direction.

424
00:41:13,091 --> 00:41:32,460
OK, I know when national and national grid installed some in the Worcester area some years ago, they were able to use them for demand response and they could do some real time communication with residents to encourage them to reduce their usage in times of peak demand.

425
00:41:34,405 --> 00:41:39,150
And on another point, Bob mentioned nuclear energy being back.

426
00:41:41,713 --> 00:41:45,316
Was there any discussion about where to stick the waste?

427
00:41:45,717 --> 00:41:51,362
Because I know we dug up several kilometers down into the desert.

428
00:41:52,483 --> 00:41:56,505
set up some storage facility in a salt mine.

429
00:41:59,085 --> 00:42:01,926
I think it was Utah that said, not in our backyard.

430
00:42:01,946 --> 00:42:15,631
Is there some initiative to, if this is back, then do we have some means of dealing with the waste or did you hear any talk about that?

431
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:18,912
This is Bob.

432
00:42:19,472 --> 00:42:20,713
I think some of the newer

433
00:42:21,756 --> 00:42:30,486
modules that are being contemplated may have the ability to take the waste and actually consume it.

434
00:42:31,387 --> 00:42:33,069
I'm hopeful that that is the case.

435
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:40,277
So some of these new nuclear modules that are being considered

436
00:42:44,484 --> 00:42:59,558
This is this a new technology may have the capability and I'll have to look into this more that you've triggered my question now that I'll have to look up whether they can actually take the waste and actually somehow consume it as part of their energy input.

437
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:01,800
So I'll look that up.

438
00:43:03,054 --> 00:43:04,735
That would be a good thing.

439
00:43:06,655 --> 00:43:14,078
And if I may add to that, I did just put a link to a webinar that I saw of women in energy.

440
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:27,902
It was really quite an interesting kind of overview of advanced nuclear energy that the National Renewable Labs have been supporting for quite some time.

441
00:43:29,697 --> 00:43:35,862
And they are looking at safer system types.

442
00:43:37,983 --> 00:43:43,307
And yes, indeed, they do talk a little bit, although not enough.

443
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:47,550
And I asked a bunch of questions about waste on that.

444
00:43:48,431 --> 00:43:50,993
But yes, with that idea that the waste

445
00:43:51,893 --> 00:44:10,901
would be a part of a process in which the most valuable fuel gets used first and then it kind of downgrades in different systems of varying importance, but always being used until it becomes basically a

446
00:44:13,363 --> 00:44:14,743
minor issue, I guess.

447
00:44:15,384 --> 00:44:21,805
So anyway, I don't know the answer fully, but it seems like that is a key concern.

448
00:44:22,465 --> 00:44:29,707
And they recognize, of course, that nuclear energy comes with this major challenge.

449
00:44:31,407 --> 00:44:38,589
And so it does need to be part of any opposed nuclear systems.

450
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:42,290
Waste management, that is.

451
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:57,392
Interestingly, it also mentions incentives for nuclear fusion, which made me wonder if we're closer than I thought we were to that, or if that was just wishful thinking.

452
00:44:57,552 --> 00:44:59,572
I think it's the perpetual 20 years.

453
00:45:00,553 --> 00:45:04,553
It'll be here in 20 years, I think, as they've been saying for the past 50.

454
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:13,915
I think now it's just 18 years.

455
00:45:16,139 --> 00:45:16,940
just around the corner.

456
00:45:20,282 --> 00:45:30,149
And Luke, I'd love it if you could expand a little bit on your comment on the network's geothermal, just so I can get a better grasp of it.

457
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:38,395
I actually went to a commercial utilities in-person

458
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:41,538
discussion on network geothermal.

459
00:45:43,561 --> 00:45:57,296
The utilities are very keen on seeing it work because the pressure to reduce gas is very strong, but the need for some gas

460
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:18,910
capability will remain and the idea that they could retool large percentages of their gas workforce to water workforce is very appealing to them.

461
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:42,066
And so the idea that a neighborhood, just pick a few blocks in your area of Medford, might have a central plant for producing hot water that then is basically run through the streets and instead of a gas line off of the street to run a boiler and

462
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:52,973
domestic hot water system, you might just have a line of hot water that comes in.

463
00:46:54,253 --> 00:47:04,899
And so that would basically tie to a heat pump that is just like a geothermal heat pump that currently goes into wells underneath a facility.

464
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,602
It would simply be tapping into this network of water.

465
00:47:11,943 --> 00:47:27,630
And so it would give the potential that you're drilling wells in the streets, you're drilling wells in areas where there is kind of space for that, that is otherwise unused.

466
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:31,711
You're maintaining the utility kind of rates of way.

467
00:47:33,692 --> 00:47:38,876
And the utility then has this, it gets to keep itself alive as well.

468
00:47:39,276 --> 00:47:40,577
Certainly that is a part of it.

469
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:46,181
They are keen on being able to continue to be a utility.

470
00:47:48,302 --> 00:48:00,230
But it is a very appealing concept that instead of a fuel, you're literally just tapping into heat that is available to you in the street.

471
00:48:02,148 --> 00:48:06,209
And as Josh pointed out, yes, there's another one also in Framingham.

472
00:48:07,589 --> 00:48:11,430
The National Grid's definitely big on it and Eversource is very big on it.

473
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:25,473
And there are a number of projects that I see come through Mass Save, the large multifamily projects, where they have multiple buildings on, you know, what was formerly a campus of some sort.

474
00:48:25,994 --> 00:48:31,715
And they're very seriously considering how do we network this all together with a big geothermal

475
00:48:34,096 --> 00:48:35,457
system, so.

476
00:48:37,598 --> 00:48:44,762
Luke had a quick question, maybe in the weeds for some, but how do they bill each individual customer?

477
00:48:44,783 --> 00:48:48,845
Do they have BT meters with flow and temperature?

478
00:48:50,446 --> 00:48:51,286
I don't know that.

479
00:48:51,786 --> 00:49:14,540
I think it's not fully developed to that level, although I wouldn't be surprised if these pilot projects, that is a key part of what they're trying to confirm in the implementation of these projects is that they can reliably bill for this.

480
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:16,103
Right, right.

481
00:49:16,443 --> 00:49:27,485
Actually, a friend from INGRID who's working somehow on some aspect of the Lowell project was asking me that question.

482
00:49:27,505 --> 00:49:31,246
I'm sure they'll figure something out.

483
00:49:31,906 --> 00:49:32,367
Right.

484
00:49:32,467 --> 00:49:34,467
I am confident that they will.

485
00:49:35,587 --> 00:49:36,067
And Barry?

486
00:49:37,788 --> 00:49:43,529
Yeah, I guess I'm not really grasping this really well.

487
00:49:44,806 --> 00:50:01,090
My question is, is there really a need for a utility in order to employ this technology, or is this a bailout program for the gas utilities?

488
00:50:02,919 --> 00:50:05,942
I think it certainly could be a bailout program.

489
00:50:07,063 --> 00:50:12,768
Well, I mean, could it be done more economically efficiently without them is kind of the question.

490
00:50:12,988 --> 00:50:19,433
Or would they simply be replaced with a different utility, in which case, yeah.

491
00:50:19,493 --> 00:50:21,135
And that's what I'm not understanding.

492
00:50:21,684 --> 00:50:31,129
Yeah, and that's been my understanding of it is the utilities under law have rights of way.

493
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:44,977
They have control of certain areas and distribution

494
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:49,188
Uh, you know, running lines in the streets, et cetera.

495
00:50:49,929 --> 00:50:50,109
Um.

496
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:56,033
And so for a private company, for instance, to attempt to do that.

497
00:50:56,974 --> 00:51:00,777
I would get quite complicated and would basically be.

498
00:51:01,977 --> 00:51:07,081
Would need utility permissions, uh, would need to basically.

499
00:51:08,462 --> 00:51:12,225
Displace or replace a lot of that.

500
00:51:13,345 --> 00:51:34,879
So, unless we were to set up a geothermal utility program totally separate from, this seems to be a way to just retool the gas companies towards that.

501
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:36,420
I don't know.

502
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,201
I think it's still really early days.

503
00:51:38,601 --> 00:51:41,763
So, if I'm understanding

504
00:51:42,707 --> 00:51:59,317
you, it sounds like most likely, we aren't sure, but most likely we would need either a geothermal utility or we would need a gazillion private little companies that were competing for our street in our neighborhood.

505
00:52:00,747 --> 00:52:07,531
or we could use the existing utilities, in which case it doesn't trouble me to bail them out.

506
00:52:07,572 --> 00:52:10,713
It sounds like that might be the most efficient way to do it.

507
00:52:12,915 --> 00:52:19,159
My question is more if we're adding an extra layer of capitalism to something that doesn't need to be.

508
00:52:20,944 --> 00:52:31,891
Well, I think there would be economies of scale, too, of doing it at that larger size, rather than each individual residential person, household doing their own.

509
00:52:34,552 --> 00:52:45,819
Well, maybe, except if each residential household has it just as part of their, it's part of the building, then you're not having to have pipes going up and down the street at all.

510
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:49,741
I mean, you're just doing it locally.

511
00:52:52,723 --> 00:52:55,014
These are engineering issues that I don't know.

512
00:52:56,507 --> 00:53:00,068
Geothermal on a residential scale is quite costly.

513
00:53:00,088 --> 00:53:14,432
And I mean, there are huge incentives for it at the moment, but it's still, as an owner, you would have to fork out many tens of thousands of dollars to drill a few wells.

514
00:53:15,432 --> 00:53:20,414
And then you might find out that it's not a great site for you, unfortunately.

515
00:53:20,794 --> 00:53:25,675
So there's risk and significant investment on an individual scale.

516
00:53:28,075 --> 00:53:43,542
Barry, to your question too, it sounds like an interesting idea for something like a public utility district or like a municipal co-op kind of structure that could still operate on that scale, but would be, you know, more beholden to, you know, having an elected board or something from the community it operates in.

517
00:53:52,726 --> 00:53:58,508
It looks like Paul is speaking, but his sound is off.

518
00:53:58,688 --> 00:53:59,968
Oh, I'm sorry.

519
00:54:01,229 --> 00:54:04,250
How deep can a homeowner drill?

520
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:07,331
Can I drill a mile down?

521
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:13,497
On deep drilling, actually, that's a good question.

522
00:54:14,098 --> 00:54:25,141
Cornell University and a couple of other universities have ultra deep wells to see if they can actually get to true geothermal.

523
00:54:25,521 --> 00:54:28,022
So there's misnomer there, geothermal.

524
00:54:28,622 --> 00:54:34,085
is what you get in Iceland, where there is actually like lava nearby.

525
00:54:35,746 --> 00:54:53,755
But what we are currently doing here in Massachusetts is called ground source heat pumps, where basically we're just using this layer of earth to dump heat, like a radiator into that space, rather than into the air, which the air source heat pumps do.

526
00:54:55,436 --> 00:55:00,578
And there's also water source heat pumps, you can do it into the ocean or into a lake or into a river.

527
00:55:01,819 --> 00:55:08,022
But that's basically just running coils into a medium and dumping your heat there.

528
00:55:08,663 --> 00:55:13,405
Whereas geothermal is like, yeah, you're taking heat from a heat source.

529
00:55:15,266 --> 00:55:22,028
But Cornell does have like a super deep... That puts to sleep my plans for the well I had in the backyard they discovered.

530
00:55:22,988 --> 00:55:25,369
I think it is challenging to get that deep.

531
00:55:27,329 --> 00:55:28,489
Institutional scale.

532
00:55:32,671 --> 00:55:35,211
Alrighty, I'm gonna grab the reins for a second.

533
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:39,432
I think we've gone a little over, but I think that was really interesting conversation.

534
00:55:39,712 --> 00:55:42,373
I do appreciate you taking the time on that.

535
00:55:43,755 --> 00:55:51,819
I wanna throw it to Brenda to talk about our monthly updates, what's going on in the world, going on in Medford.

536
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,480
Please tell us what's happening.

537
00:55:55,821 --> 00:55:58,502
Sure, I'll try to run through this relatively quickly.

538
00:56:00,363 --> 00:56:04,525
For Electrify Medford, so far we've had 95 signups.

539
00:56:05,246 --> 00:56:07,106
We've coached 35 people.

540
00:56:08,307 --> 00:56:11,569
We've had a couple drop off along the way as well.

541
00:56:13,489 --> 00:56:26,535
I was speaking with someone from Heat Smart Alliance a couple of weeks ago, and they said that's not a bad ratio of signups to coaching session, but we're still hoping to do better.

542
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:30,477
So we'll see if some tweaks we're making can change that.

543
00:56:32,078 --> 00:56:38,600
But we had a bunch of people trying to get coaching sessions in right before the holidays.

544
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,222
So in the last week before the holidays, I coached four people.

545
00:56:46,131 --> 00:56:50,976
We were accepted into Mass Saves Community First Partnership Program for 2025 through 2027.

546
00:56:51,016 --> 00:56:52,358
52 municipalities are going to be part of it.

547
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:03,645
We'll be signing an MOU and an NDA and other paperwork soon, and then we'll have an orientation on February 6th.

548
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:24,821
But from my perspective, I think the most useful part of this is just the connection with the Mass Save program, getting up-to-date information, getting data on installations in Medford, and doing outreach with them, including bill inserts and things like that.

549
00:57:25,482 --> 00:57:26,743
So I'm really excited about that.

550
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:36,270
Um, we had a table at the winter extravaganza on December 4th.

551
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:41,012
Um, that was interesting because there were, there were a lot of people.

552
00:57:41,569 --> 00:57:43,029
who were really in need.

553
00:57:43,129 --> 00:57:50,592
There were a lot of people there to get winter coats and hats and things like that and get connected to services.

554
00:57:52,172 --> 00:57:59,274
But they were less interested in Electrify Medford than in a lot of the other programs that were represented there.

555
00:57:59,374 --> 00:58:07,577
So although it was maybe the audience that we were looking to reach, it wasn't necessarily the best place to reach them, I think.

556
00:58:10,133 --> 00:58:15,075
We are going to have an event at the library on January 16th.

557
00:58:16,596 --> 00:58:20,357
Steve Bright from the Heat Smart Alliance will be speaking about heat pumps.

558
00:58:21,618 --> 00:58:35,403
And then we'll do an office hours type of setup with energy coaches sort of distributed in different areas so people can do sort of abbreviated coaching sessions with them instead of just doing a sign up and then us trying to reach them later.

559
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:41,537
And what time is that event?

560
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:43,880
Oh, it's 7 o'clock.

561
00:58:49,246 --> 00:58:49,466
Thanks.

562
00:58:49,667 --> 00:58:51,829
I think that's it for Electrify Medford.

563
00:58:54,192 --> 00:58:58,436
For the Andrews and McGlynn HVAC upgrades project,

564
00:59:01,569 --> 00:59:07,654
The $5 million bond for that passed the first reading in city council on December 17th.

565
00:59:09,115 --> 00:59:17,401
Then we're going to be doing a committee of the whole meeting to discuss it in more detail with them, hopefully on January 14th, although that hasn't been scheduled quite yet.

566
00:59:18,382 --> 00:59:21,725
And then they'll do a third reading soon after that.

567
00:59:23,953 --> 00:59:31,497
And this is for the pre-construction services through April and pre-ordering some of the equipment with long lead times.

568
00:59:33,017 --> 00:59:46,223
So we're hoping that if we are able to pre-order the equipment, then we'll be able to get the bulk of this disruptive work done during the summer and that we'll have cooling in the classrooms in time for the new school year to start.

569
00:59:47,887 --> 01:00:00,341
We're anticipating a $25 million bond in April for the actual construction work, but we'll have a more precise number for that once we've onboarded the construction manager and had a guaranteed maximum price agreed on.

570
01:00:02,107 --> 01:00:07,533
And we're putting out an RFP for that construction manager at risk tomorrow.

571
01:00:07,553 --> 01:00:16,784
And we are expecting to onboard them by the middle of February once we have that bond approved.

572
01:00:17,765 --> 01:00:22,350
And yeah, I think that's it for that project for now.

573
01:00:25,078 --> 01:00:36,386
Um, Andrew's solar project, we finally signed the contract for that, um, which is good because it needed to be done by the end of 2024 in order for us to use the ARPA funding for it.

574
01:00:37,366 --> 01:00:45,252
Um, and now for the ARPA funding, the project needs to be done by the end of 2025, but we expect it, it'll be finished before the summer.

575
01:00:46,553 --> 01:00:47,633
Um, and it's 258 Watts.

576
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:54,622
And then also for Andrews.

577
01:00:54,702 --> 01:00:55,584
Also for Andrews.

578
01:01:05,846 --> 01:01:17,833
The electrical work was done there to put more circuits on the emergency generator so that the building can be used as an emergency shelter during a power outage.

579
01:01:19,334 --> 01:01:22,956
So that's something that we've been talking about for a long time, too.

580
01:01:23,016 --> 01:01:24,637
So I'm happy that that's done.

581
01:01:25,037 --> 01:01:30,761
So right now, it's just a regular generator.

582
01:01:30,781 --> 01:01:34,083
But we are hoping in the future to have that be

583
01:01:35,263 --> 01:01:37,444
that backup be battery storage instead.

584
01:01:37,524 --> 01:01:40,185
So this was a first step.

585
01:01:41,286 --> 01:01:52,331
So it can be off grid if necessary right now, and then we can work towards making it more environmentally friendly as well.

586
01:01:56,872 --> 01:02:08,810
I wanted to mention this isn't Medford specific but I did want to mention that there was a public meeting in December about recommendations for a statewide building decarbonization clearinghouse.

587
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,753
that would be operational in 2028.

588
01:02:14,394 --> 01:02:26,736
So VEIC created this report for the state, and so they had a couple of different options that they were discussing.

589
01:02:27,337 --> 01:02:33,278
One being just using the current Mass Save electric PAs as the

590
01:02:35,449 --> 01:02:37,490
as the administrators of this program.

591
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:39,751
So this would take the place of Mass Save, essentially.

592
01:02:41,652 --> 01:02:46,034
So one thing would be just using the electric PAs, cutting the gas PAs out of it completely.

593
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:50,056
And municipal light plants would be served as part of this.

594
01:02:52,683 --> 01:02:59,469
either by an existing program administrator or they could select one.

595
01:02:59,549 --> 01:03:02,272
If they didn't already have one, they could select one together.

596
01:03:02,292 --> 01:03:07,436
And they would still be accountable to the Department of Public Utilities.

597
01:03:07,937 --> 01:03:16,405
Another option that was discussed was creating a new statewide entity that was quasi-governmental that would be accountable not to the

598
01:03:17,067 --> 01:03:23,191
Department of Public Utilities, but to a board of directors and the executive and legislative branches here in the state.

599
01:03:24,431 --> 01:03:28,634
Sort of like a Efficiency Maine or Efficiency Vermont, something like that.

600
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:39,364
So they were getting feedback about what preferences people had in terms of those options.

601
01:03:41,786 --> 01:03:47,408
This would be focused more on greenhouse gas emissions targets rather than energy reduction.

602
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:56,552
It would be not just looking at three-year plans, but also creating 10-year plans as well.

603
01:03:56,652 --> 01:03:57,753
So looking farther out.

604
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:11,664
possibly removing the cost effectiveness requirement, which really limits a lot of what the Mass Save can do right now, and pulling in additional non-rate payer funding.

605
01:04:12,665 --> 01:04:27,878
So I think, yeah, I think that's part of the thought of it not being utilities sort of broadens what people are thinking about in terms of funding for these programs.

606
01:04:29,687 --> 01:04:31,127
So I think this is really interesting.

607
01:04:31,248 --> 01:04:37,489
I'm really intrigued by the idea of a new statewide entity that's not run by the utilities.

608
01:04:44,411 --> 01:04:50,113
And then, so MassSave back in October filed their three-year plan.

609
01:04:51,393 --> 01:04:58,475
We don't have any updates on that right now because the DPU hasn't decided what they're approving and they won't be doing that until the end of January.

610
01:05:00,623 --> 01:05:09,426
But part of what the program administrators filed was no fossil fuel incentives.

611
01:05:09,566 --> 01:05:17,729
And that was required in the last climate bill that by this point, we're not gonna be supporting fossil fuels through the program.

612
01:05:18,149 --> 01:05:25,711
Heat pump incentives would drop for some people instead of there being like a flat $10,000 incentive for whole home heat pump.

613
01:05:28,805 --> 01:05:33,108
Um, it would be $3,000 per ton up to $10,000.

614
01:05:33,549 --> 01:05:40,674
So for a lot of people, especially ones with smaller homes, they would, they would have less incentives.

615
01:05:43,403 --> 01:05:52,532
And the heat loan, the 0% interest heat loan, would still be 0% interest, but the term of it would change based on your income level.

616
01:05:52,592 --> 01:05:59,538
So if you are, you know, more moderate income, then you would still have the full seven year term.

617
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:06,645
But if you have higher income, then it could be as low as three years.

618
01:06:10,666 --> 01:06:13,729
All of which I thought was pretty reasonable, actually.

619
01:06:13,749 --> 01:06:19,354
They also designated 21 equity communities.

620
01:06:20,616 --> 01:06:23,398
Medford isn't one of them, unfortunately.

621
01:06:24,299 --> 01:06:31,786
These communities would have more incentives, especially for low and moderate income residents.

622
01:06:35,565 --> 01:06:37,533
which people are very excited about.

623
01:06:41,818 --> 01:06:46,042
It's also the most expensive plan ever for over the three years.

624
01:06:46,142 --> 01:06:53,328
It's $5 billion, which makes me wonder if the DPU is going to approve all of it.

625
01:06:53,428 --> 01:06:58,352
So we're just waiting and seeing until the end of January to see what happens there.

626
01:06:58,732 --> 01:07:05,678
But we'll get training directly from MassSave on the programs at our February orientation for the Community First Partnership.

627
01:07:09,757 --> 01:07:11,718
And that's it for me.

628
01:07:11,898 --> 01:07:15,460
Any questions, comments on any of those updates?

629
01:07:24,985 --> 01:07:25,186
Cool.

630
01:07:28,908 --> 01:07:29,368
Oh, Josh.

631
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:36,437
Sorry, they hid the hands up in the React tab, and I haven't yet gotten used to it.

632
01:07:36,537 --> 01:07:46,803
Brenda, I just want to ask, is there a best way for this community and this committee to engage with the Mass Save Community First partnership?

633
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:51,927
How do you expect us to relate to, or is it just information sharing?

634
01:07:56,369 --> 01:07:57,190
And you're muted, I'm sorry.

635
01:08:00,187 --> 01:08:01,687
There we go.

636
01:08:03,068 --> 01:08:06,548
Yeah, so I mean, a lot of it is information sharing.

637
01:08:07,029 --> 01:08:12,590
A lot of it is through, a lot of what we do is going to be through Electrify Medford.

638
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:19,692
So if you want to get more involved in Electrify Medford, we're always looking for more coaches.

639
01:08:19,832 --> 01:08:22,612
So we'd love to have you.

640
01:08:22,632 --> 01:08:29,794
And if you have any suggestions as we're going along for ways that we can get the word out to people,

641
01:08:31,991 --> 01:08:33,111
definitely let me know.

642
01:08:33,131 --> 01:08:39,914
Thanks, I had a great time being coached by one of your coaches, so thoroughly into it.

643
01:08:42,695 --> 01:08:42,975
Nice.

644
01:08:48,898 --> 01:08:51,779
Alrighty, any other thoughts, questions, concerns?

645
01:08:55,681 --> 01:08:59,923
Alright, seeing none, I'm going to launch into a brief

646
01:09:03,153 --> 01:09:11,875
Discussion of what I. A vision I've had for this committee in many ways that we.

647
01:09:13,035 --> 01:09:16,996
Meet every month and we discuss a lot of really interesting ideas.

648
01:09:17,276 --> 01:09:21,497
We talk about problems in the world and things we'd like to see done, but I'm.

649
01:09:23,337 --> 01:09:31,279
Coming from a background in advocacy, and I see a lot of very talented and smart and committed people in a room, so I want to.

650
01:09:33,964 --> 01:09:44,771
potentially for the foreseeable future, set aside a little bit of time at the end of every meeting to discuss certain initiatives that people are opting to take on.

651
01:09:46,312 --> 01:09:50,195
I have put together three action plans for myself.

652
01:09:51,276 --> 01:10:02,163
One very easy, two a little harder, but things that I'm holding myself to and want to get your opinions on and get your volunteer and expertise and input on as well.

653
01:10:05,423 --> 01:10:15,910
The hope is that we have a space at the end of these meetings where we can discuss progress we're making, hurdles we're facing.

654
01:10:15,930 --> 01:10:19,773
And ask for general advice going forward.

655
01:10:19,793 --> 01:10:21,033
So.

656
01:10:24,598 --> 01:10:35,682
I know I sent out an email blast to everybody to brainstorm ideas for initiatives, things that they want to see done throughout the course of this year.

657
01:10:37,383 --> 01:10:44,525
So I'd love to open the floor if people have thoughts of things they'd like to tackle throughout the year.

658
01:10:45,726 --> 01:10:48,507
We'll keep this brief because I want to be respectful of your time.

659
01:10:49,607 --> 01:10:50,688
Just know I will be

660
01:10:53,057 --> 01:11:04,229
doing my absolute darndest to keep us all accountable to each other and talking about these projects so that we can make recommendations and use this position productively.

661
01:11:09,234 --> 01:11:11,076
Will, are you talking?

662
01:11:11,236 --> 01:11:14,639
I mean, we are new, so how do you propose we

663
01:11:15,723 --> 01:11:25,612
Yeah, so the example I can give here is I have a pretty simple version I'm calling the Better Bag Ban.

664
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:32,494
We had discussed last month our bag ordinance was incomplete.

665
01:11:33,274 --> 01:11:38,839
We banned those super thin film plastic bags from restaurants and stores.

666
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:52,729
But I think one of the easiest things we could do is make recommendations to our council members and to the mayor to finish the job and push for a thicker bag ban for Medford so that no plastic is being used.

667
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:56,271
For any of our backs.

668
01:11:58,453 --> 01:12:02,014
So there's 1 that we can begin using our position and our.

669
01:12:02,575 --> 01:12:06,137
Ability to commune with the council people to make that recommendation.

670
01:12:07,177 --> 01:12:12,280
And if things are not moving along, we can also begin the groundwork of petitioning.

671
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:16,502
And talking to folks and neighbors about getting something like that done.

672
01:12:18,493 --> 01:12:30,076
So that's sort of an example of a nice, easy initiative that I think we could push forward and hopefully generate something that is productive in the next couple of months.

673
01:12:32,876 --> 01:12:33,576
That's great.

674
01:12:33,936 --> 01:12:38,457
Well, I know we had like a priorities list from last year.

675
01:12:38,477 --> 01:12:40,118
I just dropped that into the chat.

676
01:12:40,438 --> 01:12:46,399
Are you collecting these in that list or another list or how are you doing that?

677
01:12:47,530 --> 01:13:04,717
Something I was ready to do, time now being of the essence, I was ready for people to potentially read off the things that are most interesting to them, seeing as things like our priority lists through Google Docs and Excel sheets kind of struggle.

678
01:13:07,359 --> 01:13:12,501
But the idea is to hopefully have projects that we can come back to over and over.

679
01:13:13,857 --> 01:13:23,584
So if people would like to add an official statement of a thing they want to get done, I would love to use the priority projects list here.

680
01:13:23,604 --> 01:13:32,610
So you want us to add to the priority program or against whatever is written there already?

681
01:13:33,571 --> 01:13:40,035
I would love it if you found an action that was most motivating to you, something you'd like to take on.

682
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:43,185
These are examples.

683
01:13:43,405 --> 01:13:47,788
These are things that we've talked about in the past, but if they don't inspire you, drop them.

684
01:13:47,968 --> 01:13:54,632
I'd rather you do the thing that motivates you and that we can then help you towards going forward.

685
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:01,536
But this doesn't have to be now.

686
01:14:02,256 --> 01:14:06,459
We have about a minute before I want to move to new business and towards a journey.

687
01:14:08,655 --> 01:14:23,184
But I wanted to at least vocalize this to everybody to begin thoughts churning, people thinking about what they want to get done, and hopefully setting aside time for these kinds of projects going forward.

688
01:14:25,206 --> 01:14:25,666
Yeah, Barry.

689
01:14:28,128 --> 01:14:29,008
Well, two things.

690
01:14:29,308 --> 01:14:32,090
One, and I don't want to put either of them on the list.

691
01:14:35,028 --> 01:14:53,433
The first one is simpler and I'd consider putting it on the list, which is, is there a way for our committee to publicize that information that Bob sent out or

692
01:14:54,727 --> 01:15:13,021
the meat of that information, which is the scamming involved in door-to-door and phone sales of electric supply, and also the scamming involved in a lot of sales of solar.

693
01:15:15,362 --> 01:15:23,749
We need to protect our residents from this, people who are either trying to save money or who are trying to save the planet.

694
01:15:24,658 --> 01:15:33,626
and who are doing nothing for either of those purposes but padding the pockets of scammers.

695
01:15:33,746 --> 01:15:36,668
And I think we have a role there.

696
01:15:39,551 --> 01:15:45,416
The second thing, which I definitely don't want to put on the list, is just to make people aware that

697
01:15:46,248 --> 01:15:55,037
Luke and I have been working for, I don't know, two years more on trying to expand the solar roof ordinance.

698
01:15:56,279 --> 01:16:08,431
And we've hit some barriers, but we're still working on trying to figure out how to make that happen, how to

699
01:16:10,137 --> 01:16:19,843
ensure that development results in the creation of solar panels that benefit the community instead of benefiting private enterprises.

700
01:16:21,524 --> 01:16:30,748
And I had like a five second conversation with Josh at an unrelated meeting and he expressed interest.

701
01:16:30,789 --> 01:16:39,053
So Josh, you should give us your email or get in touch with us and we can, I can send you some stuff.

702
01:16:39,707 --> 01:16:41,128
Yeah, Brenda's got it.

703
01:16:41,208 --> 01:16:43,230
I'd love to get stuck in.

704
01:16:47,113 --> 01:16:48,674
I think I would.

705
01:16:49,034 --> 01:16:49,735
Oh, yes, Paul.

706
01:16:49,835 --> 01:16:50,415
If you need me.

707
01:16:53,397 --> 01:16:57,340
I'm sorry, one more time, Paul.

708
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:05,767
I'd like to get involved in that, too, so if Barry and Luca need

709
01:17:07,810 --> 01:17:14,612
We're trying to avoid having it be an official committee project is part of what we're doing.

710
01:17:15,312 --> 01:17:29,636
So I'm just afraid that if we have, so we're trying to find people with expertise, whether they're on the committee or not in this arena.

711
01:17:32,994 --> 01:17:38,337
But I mean, if we get to the point where we have a half a dozen committee members, it's clearly a committee project.

712
01:17:39,617 --> 01:17:44,219
And there's reasons that we don't want it to be that.

713
01:17:51,183 --> 01:17:53,283
But Paul, if you're dying to be part of this,

714
01:17:56,831 --> 01:17:57,732
I'm not dying.

715
01:17:58,172 --> 01:18:00,473
I'd like to discuss that.

716
01:18:01,413 --> 01:18:02,353
But yes, anyway.

717
01:18:04,594 --> 01:18:06,655
I'd just like to, that's all.

718
01:18:06,695 --> 01:18:15,639
So if you need any help, even if it is administrative, I'll be happy to help out.

719
01:18:16,419 --> 01:18:17,299
OK, thank you.

720
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:20,520
Loretta?

721
01:18:22,241 --> 01:18:23,962
Yeah, I like Barry's idea.

722
01:18:24,738 --> 01:18:34,227
And I don't know who would take the lead on that, but I have a lot of knowledge about the do not knock policy that I worked with.

723
01:18:34,347 --> 01:18:42,375
So Barry, if it ends up being you, so it takes a lead on, I'll call it do not knock.

724
01:18:43,275 --> 01:18:48,160
Please feel free to reach out to me and I can share the knowledge I have about that.

725
01:18:54,113 --> 01:18:59,918
Fantastic, and I'm starting to add some of my things into this doc as we find useful.

726
01:19:00,959 --> 01:19:05,963
Yeah, are you going to email that again and we can add our thoughts to it?

727
01:19:06,003 --> 01:19:10,307
Yes, it's currently in the chat, but I will send out an email once again.

728
01:19:10,447 --> 01:19:13,770
We should double check though that your email is correct.

729
01:19:14,991 --> 01:19:21,757
At some point during the week, if you weren't getting the minutes, we should make sure that that's ameliorated.

730
01:19:22,955 --> 01:19:24,256
Well, one quick question.

731
01:19:24,316 --> 01:19:24,676
Oh, sorry.

732
01:19:25,576 --> 01:19:30,399
At one point, Brenda was sending out everything to the MEC email.

733
01:19:31,079 --> 01:19:35,722
Is she still, so we should send it to Brenda and then she forwards it to everybody?

734
01:19:35,742 --> 01:19:41,085
Uh, well, I had also sent out something through the MEC email list.

735
01:19:42,465 --> 01:19:46,027
Uh, so hopefully that was received, but if it's not, we should double check it.

736
01:19:46,788 --> 01:19:47,008
Okay.

737
01:19:49,598 --> 01:20:02,925
I mean, I had some thoughts, you know, things, you know, we're running out of time here, but it would be nice to continue working on the rodenticide issues, but, you know, it can't just be me.

738
01:20:04,826 --> 01:20:09,808
I'm working with the Trees Medford group and a few other projects that are coming up.

739
01:20:09,888 --> 01:20:18,593
So one you're aware of that you attended a meeting on, which is a private thing, but environmentally focused.

740
01:20:19,229 --> 01:20:26,462
So with the rodenticide, it needs more time for people to research some of this information.

741
01:20:26,915 --> 01:20:35,142
Like I've heard that Arlington has banned the SCARS rodenticides and a few other towns have too.

742
01:20:35,162 --> 01:20:42,047
So it'd be good to get a copy of their ordinance, but I don't wanna go against the city and the health department and what they're doing.

743
01:20:42,147 --> 01:20:50,654
So, I know some of the alternatives have been very expensive, but maybe not because you could just say, we're not using these anymore.

744
01:20:50,974 --> 01:20:54,037
They kill our natural predators of rodents.

745
01:20:57,263 --> 01:21:00,226
Yeah, so I mean, collecting that information is a great first start.

746
01:21:00,506 --> 01:21:06,251
I think it's one of those things we have time to mull it over and begin that work.

747
01:21:07,512 --> 01:21:09,093
But you shouldn't have to bear it all by yourself.

748
01:21:09,113 --> 01:21:09,994
That's why we're all here.

749
01:21:11,876 --> 01:21:15,058
I see Lois has had her hand up patiently for a minute.

750
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:21,304
Yeah, as I mentioned at the beginning, I'm particularly interested in this restaurant business.

751
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:25,027
And I just wondered if anybody else is.

752
01:21:27,119 --> 01:21:28,400
I'd be interested in working on it with you.

753
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:30,120
Pardon?

754
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:32,341
I would be interested in working on it with you.

755
01:21:35,142 --> 01:21:45,106
OK, it just we we can get together privately and come up with a plan and run it by the group.

756
01:21:46,046 --> 01:21:46,546
Sounds good.

757
01:21:48,087 --> 01:21:48,287
Great.

758
01:21:50,777 --> 01:21:53,838
I haven't figured out how to do the raise hand on this.

759
01:21:53,858 --> 01:21:56,979
So I'm just going to quickly interject.

760
01:21:57,899 --> 01:22:02,961
I'm very passionate about Zero Waste Medford and I see already the waste reductions.

761
01:22:03,041 --> 01:22:13,445
I would love to speak to folks to potentially have like a, not official, but like dedicated Zero Waste Medford volunteer team.

762
01:22:14,237 --> 01:22:19,559
Yes, I'm putting myself as a point person for that, but please add yourself as well.

763
01:22:19,579 --> 01:22:25,221
I have a mini action plan I'd like to see done by the end of the year, and I'd love to get your help.

764
01:22:28,782 --> 01:22:32,724
And I saw Josh had their hand up in the final moments.

765
01:22:33,844 --> 01:22:34,725
Yeah, I just wanted to say,

766
01:22:36,771 --> 01:22:53,000
Loretta, I'm more than happy to connect you with Colin Ziegler and Alicia in the city of Somerville who are doing some pretty cool innovative rodenticide rat birth control efforts now, which are interesting and don't affect sort of higher tier species.

767
01:22:53,040 --> 01:23:01,244
So I don't wanna do that work like a lot with you, I'm sorry, but I'd be more than happy to act as a connector with the resources I have access to.

768
01:23:01,924 --> 01:23:03,405
And who was that in Somerville?

769
01:23:04,506 --> 01:23:06,467
Colin Ziegler runs that program.

770
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:10,811
Oh, okay, because I know Winchester was trying it too.

771
01:23:12,091 --> 01:23:17,232
Okay, maybe we can email each other.

772
01:23:17,332 --> 01:23:21,893
All right.

773
01:23:23,333 --> 01:23:31,315
I've successfully thrown that, accepted that idea, thrown that grenade into conversation, but I think we're nearing the end.

774
01:23:31,935 --> 01:23:34,496
I'd love to open up the floor for new business.

775
01:23:36,531 --> 01:23:41,634
Any parting thoughts, things we are thinking about as we head into the new year?

776
01:23:49,598 --> 01:23:50,619
Well, this is Bob Payne.

777
01:23:50,699 --> 01:23:56,962
We usually, maybe we did establish a date for the Harvest Uranogy Festival, but we usually do that early in the year.

778
01:23:58,043 --> 01:24:03,686
And we usually do it the Saturday after Columbus Day, or well, sorry, Indigenous Peoples Day.

779
01:24:05,136 --> 01:24:08,337
Yeah, I will add that to the agenda for next month.

780
01:24:08,537 --> 01:24:08,977
I didn't know.

781
01:24:09,777 --> 01:24:13,618
And I guess usually Brenda, you should check to see if the mayor is available.

782
01:24:14,138 --> 01:24:18,119
If the mayor should be involved, see what her schedule is.

783
01:24:18,819 --> 01:24:18,999
Yep.

784
01:24:19,159 --> 01:24:21,220
I'll confirm with the mayor and with Alicia.

785
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:22,580
Yeah.

786
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:31,102
And I will be hopefully pushing to get her to join maybe our March meeting or March, maybe April.

787
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:47,775
Yeah, I know she has school committee every other Monday night, but it sometimes overlaps with this meeting and sometimes doesn't.

788
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:52,598
So maybe we can reach out to her about coming in March.

789
01:24:52,678 --> 01:24:55,279
And if that doesn't work, we can say April.

790
01:24:58,401 --> 01:25:02,883
Yeah, well, we'll push and pull and make sure that it works out.

791
01:25:08,741 --> 01:25:13,685
We had talked about having a presentation from someone from Zero Waste Melrose.

792
01:25:13,906 --> 01:25:18,330
I haven't had any luck contacting them.

793
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:18,990
Have you, Bob?

794
01:25:20,792 --> 01:25:21,552
I sent an email.

795
01:25:21,592 --> 01:25:23,935
All they did is add me to their Google list.

796
01:25:24,995 --> 01:25:26,537
They didn't respond at all.

797
01:25:26,557 --> 01:25:28,278
So they don't want to talk to me.

798
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:30,761
We'll keep that up.

799
01:25:31,021 --> 01:25:34,504
Pravita, do you have any contacts there that you could reach out to?

800
01:25:35,365 --> 01:25:39,346
I've been in contact with Zero Waste Arlington, Zero Waste Cambridge.

801
01:25:39,366 --> 01:25:43,868
I haven't spoken to any, definitely more so with Cambridge.

802
01:25:44,768 --> 01:25:46,648
I don't know any contact in Melrose.

803
01:25:49,930 --> 01:25:51,370
Yeah, it doesn't have to be Melrose either.

804
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:53,371
They don't have a monopoly.

805
01:25:53,451 --> 01:25:56,231
I could reach out to Zero Waste Cambridge and Arlington.

806
01:25:57,352 --> 01:25:58,312
OK, we'll try those.

807
01:26:00,053 --> 01:26:03,454
Maybe they can make a presentation or something in a future meeting.

808
01:26:04,214 --> 01:26:04,414
Sure.

809
01:26:10,962 --> 01:26:15,245
All righty, we've hit eight o'clock, the bell tolls.

810
01:26:16,306 --> 01:26:17,827
Do I hear any movements, any motions?

811
01:26:20,329 --> 01:26:21,210
Motion to adjourn.

812
01:26:23,411 --> 01:26:24,132
And seconded.

813
01:26:25,493 --> 01:26:26,874
Fantastic, anyone opposed?

814
01:26:29,936 --> 01:26:33,699
All right, seeing none, I bid you all farewell.

815
01:26:35,670 --> 01:26:36,451
Wonderful meeting.

816
01:26:37,051 --> 01:26:39,293
Please, if you need anything, reach out to me.

817
01:26:39,393 --> 01:26:41,835
I can resend this priorities list.

818
01:26:44,377 --> 01:26:48,120
Hopefully everyone has my email, but if not, I'll just throw it in the chat.

819
01:26:49,221 --> 01:26:50,182
Do with it what you need.

820
01:26:50,422 --> 01:26:51,143
Do with it what you will.

821
01:26:52,995 --> 01:27:01,200
I think maybe I should send an email, a list out of everyone's contact info so that the folks can talk to each other outside of this.

822
01:27:02,161 --> 01:27:03,622
That would be great.

823
01:27:04,783 --> 01:27:09,165
And don't feel hemmed in by this existing priorities list from last year.

824
01:27:09,345 --> 01:27:10,566
Oh gosh, yes.

825
01:27:10,806 --> 01:27:13,728
It's such a patchwork of things we've just talked about.

826
01:27:13,748 --> 01:27:19,251
I was like frantically taking notes, trying to piece it together, change whatever needs to be changed.

827
01:27:21,733 --> 01:27:22,694
And then we should be golden.

828
01:27:23,115 --> 01:27:25,799
But again, also it's all optional.

829
01:27:26,019 --> 01:27:28,763
Like if you're overwhelmed, work's got you down.

830
01:27:28,984 --> 01:27:30,726
Don't take on more than you can handle.

831
01:27:31,527 --> 01:27:34,291
Take on the things that inspire you and we can help out.

832
01:27:36,835 --> 01:27:37,055
All right.

833
01:27:38,197 --> 01:27:40,380
I have no more sway over you.

834
01:27:40,601 --> 01:27:41,081
You are gone.

835
01:27:41,101 --> 01:27:43,705
Have a wonderful rest of your month.

836
01:27:43,985 --> 01:27:44,426
Take care.

837
01:27:44,446 --> 01:27:45,347
I'll see you all February.

838
01:27:45,367 --> 01:27:45,908
Thank you.
