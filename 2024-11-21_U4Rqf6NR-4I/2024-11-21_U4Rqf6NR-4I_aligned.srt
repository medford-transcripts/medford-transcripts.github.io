00:00:00,428 --> 00:00:11,595
If you're taking your T7 soon, whether it's in just a few weeks or in a few months and you're a little bit scared or maybe a lot scared of the science section, this video is for you.

2
00:00:12,035 --> 00:00:18,360
In this video, we're gonna be going over the most realistic and aligned free T7 practice test.

3
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:26,505
We're gonna be answering questions on chemistry, A&P, scientific reasoning, and biology.

4
00:00:26,805 --> 00:00:29,907
This is the most legit free test that you're going to find.

5
00:00:30,328 --> 00:00:33,671
We also offer a reading, math, and English test.

6
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:38,095
You can sign up to take those tests using the link in the description below.

7
00:00:39,096 --> 00:00:42,399
Make sure that you grab a pen and a piece of paper.

8
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:49,453
because not only am I going to be explaining to you why the correct answers are correct, I'm going to be explaining to you why they're incorrect.

9
00:00:49,593 --> 00:00:58,837
So before we dive on in, I do want to remind you that if you're taking your TEAS exam, taking a practice test is the best thing for you to do, especially in the very beginning.

10
00:00:59,237 --> 00:01:01,738
The number one mistake that we see students make

11
00:01:02,398 --> 00:01:18,407
people find out that they have to take this test and they just start studying random stuff and they have no idea what's actually on the test, how in-depth or not in-depth the test is, and people get really stressed out and they get really overwhelmed or they just straight-up study the wrong thing.

12
00:01:18,847 --> 00:01:20,488
So taking a practice test is

13
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:37,358
and figuring out what is actually on the test, what is not on the test, what do I know, what do I not know, that allows you to be able to gauge how ready you are for each section of the exam, and it'll allow you to also gauge what it is you need to study.

14
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:39,439
So thank you for being here.

15
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:43,119
You're doing the right thing by taking a TEAS practice test.

16
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,720
So without further ado, let's get on into it.

17
00:01:49,093 --> 00:02:04,516
Okay, so let's dive right on into our first question, which looks like it's going to be on A and P. A patient presents with excessive bruising, excessive bleeding, and slow wound healing.

18
00:02:05,076 --> 00:02:08,616
Which of the following does the patient's blood test reveal?

19
00:02:10,117 --> 00:02:18,198
A low platelet count, high antibody count, high red blood cell count, or low white blood cell count?

20
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:27,076
the right answer is going to be A, low platelet count.

21
00:02:29,117 --> 00:02:32,599
So let's talk about why the correct answer is low platelet count.

22
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:41,384
So as you probably remember, platelets are tiny cell fragments in the blood that help form clots to stop bleeding.

23
00:02:42,365 --> 00:02:44,726
So in this question,

24
00:02:45,294 --> 00:03:00,045
when someone is experiencing excessive bruising, excessive bleeding, and slow wound healing, that's because their blood is not clotting as well as it should be, which would indicate low platelet count.

25
00:03:00,065 --> 00:03:06,450
So this is a great question to get the test started with because you will definitely see questions like this.

26
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:12,495
So it's not always a matter of knowing your vocabulary words and memorizing

27
00:03:13,013 --> 00:03:16,917
This is a great example of why it's important to understand context.

28
00:03:18,218 --> 00:03:19,540
Let's go to our next question.

29
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,165
Blood oxygen levels are most likely low when blood does which of the following?

30
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:34,235
Leaves the aorta, fills the right atrium, reaches the body's tissues, or flows through the arteries?

31
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:44,328
The right answer here is fills the right atrium.

32
00:03:44,468 --> 00:03:54,430
So the right atrium is one of the four chambers of the heart and it's where blood returns from the body after it has delivered oxygen to the tissues.

33
00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:01,492
So the blood is now lower in oxygen because it has already been used by the body cells.

34
00:04:02,072 --> 00:04:10,174
So when the blood fills up the right atrium, it's carrying less oxygen and is on its way to the lungs to pick up more.

35
00:04:10,962 --> 00:04:16,646
So let's talk about why the other answers are incorrect, leaving the aorta.

36
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:25,573
So the aorta is the largest artery in the body, and it carries oxygen-rich blood directly from the heart to the rest of the body.

37
00:04:25,994 --> 00:04:34,020
And blood in the aorta has just come from the lungs where it was just reoxygenated, so now it is high and oxygen not low.

38
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:37,178
reaches the body's tissue.

39
00:04:37,258 --> 00:04:43,121
So this is incorrect because when blood reaches the body tissues, it is delivering oxygen to them.

40
00:04:43,561 --> 00:04:47,443
This means that it is still high in oxygen when it arrives at the tissues.

41
00:04:47,903 --> 00:04:54,387
It only becomes low in oxygen after it has delivered the oxygen and is on its way back to the heart.

42
00:04:55,887 --> 00:04:58,088
And lastly, flows through the arteries.

43
00:04:58,108 --> 00:05:03,930
So arteries generally carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the different parts of the body.

44
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:13,373
The only exception to this is the pulmonary arteries, which carry oxygen-poor blood from the heart to the lungs.

45
00:05:13,453 --> 00:05:19,475
However, in general, blood flowing through the arteries is usually high in oxygen.

46
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:29,327
An intracellular chemical signal can be produced in the cell membrane.

47
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:33,669
Once it is produced, it goes to which of the following?

48
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,230
A, to a different cell.

49
00:05:37,051 --> 00:05:39,652
B, to another part of the same cell.

50
00:05:40,752 --> 00:05:43,814
C, to a region right outside of the cell.

51
00:05:44,254 --> 00:05:48,516
Or D, to an area with high ion concentration.

52
00:05:58,243 --> 00:06:02,165
The correct answer to this is B, to another part of the same cell.

53
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:08,927
So an intracellular chemical signal is a signal which is produced inside of a cell.

54
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:10,728
That's what the intra part means.

55
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:15,550
And what it does is it communicates information within that same cell.

56
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:26,875
So when this signal is created, usually that happens inside of the cell membrane, it travels to another part within the same cell to carry out specific functions.

57
00:06:27,352 --> 00:06:31,355
An example of a function might be something like activating enzymes.

58
00:06:32,456 --> 00:06:44,186
All in all, intracellular signals are designed to act within the same cell where they are produced and traveling to different areas of that cell to carry out their task.

59
00:06:44,826 --> 00:06:55,675
All of these other answer options here are talking about intercellular signals, which would mean that the signal would have to leave the cell or go to unrelated areas.

60
00:07:01,382 --> 00:07:05,284
Which of the following enzymes breaks down proteins?

61
00:07:07,785 --> 00:07:15,590
Is it A, amylase, B, lactase, C, pepsin, or D, suocrase?

62
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:27,256
So this is a great question because on the TEAS exam, you're going to have questions that come up on

63
00:07:28,004 --> 00:07:31,005
macromolecules kind of in two different ways.

64
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:39,429
So you're going to see questions like this where it's really related to A and P, specifically the gastrointestinal system.

65
00:07:39,989 --> 00:07:44,471
And then you're also going to see questions about macromolecules

66
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:53,603
asked of you in more of the sense of a biology question.

67
00:07:53,763 --> 00:08:10,188
So it's really important that you really understand your macromolecules, also known as your biomolecules, really well through and through, because there's a good chance that you're gonna be asked an A and P as well as a biology question about them.

68
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:15,910
So in this case, the correct answer is C, pepsin.

69
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:29,320
So the reason that pepsin is the correct answer is because pepsin is an enzyme that is specifically helps break down proteins into smaller pieces, making it easier for the body to digest them.

70
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:36,043
Pepsin is produced in the stomach where it works best in the acidic environment to start protein digestion.

71
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:38,824
Let's talk about why the other three are incorrect.

72
00:08:38,904 --> 00:08:46,587
So amylase is the enzyme that breaks down starches, meaning complex carbohydrates into simple sugars,

73
00:08:47,337 --> 00:08:49,819
It basically doesn't have anything to do with proteins at all.

74
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,500
Lactase.

75
00:08:52,321 --> 00:08:59,206
Lactase is an enzyme that breaks down lactose, that's the sugar found in milk, into simpler sugars.

76
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:04,010
So lactase works on lactose, not proteins, that's why it's incorrect.

77
00:09:04,931 --> 00:09:14,839
And lastly, sucrose is an enzyme that breaks down sucrose, which is basically table sugar, into simpler sugars, which are

78
00:09:15,613 --> 00:09:17,274
for example, like glucose.

79
00:09:17,595 --> 00:09:23,439
Therefore, petsin is the right answer because it's the only enzyme, at least on this list, that breaks down proteins.

80
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:31,544
The diffusion of nutrients through the walls of the digestive system is critical to homeostasis in the body.

81
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:38,529
The majority of this diffusion takes place in which of the following areas of the digestive system?

82
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:44,313
The large intestine, the colon, the liver,

83
00:09:45,158 --> 00:09:46,598
or the small intestine?

84
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:57,022
The correct answer here is the small intestine.

85
00:10:00,443 --> 00:10:07,205
Okay, so the small intestine is where the majority of nutrient absorption takes place in the digestive system.

86
00:10:08,195 --> 00:10:22,761
The walls inside of the small intestine are lined with tiny structures called villi and microvilli, and that increases the surface area, making it highly efficient at absorbing nutrients and passing them into the bloodstream.

87
00:10:23,402 --> 00:10:29,684
This is obviously essential for homeostasis as the body needs these nutrients to function properly.

88
00:10:30,585 --> 00:10:32,946
Well, let's talk about why the other options are incorrect.

89
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:35,371
large intestine.

90
00:10:35,952 --> 00:10:44,615
The large intestine mainly absorbs water and some minerals, but it does not play a major role in absorbing nutrients from food.

91
00:10:44,715 --> 00:10:49,677
By the time food reaches the large intestine, most of the nutrients have already been absorbed.

92
00:10:51,037 --> 00:10:57,039
The colon is part of the large intestine and has a similar role in absorbing water and minerals.

93
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:03,502
It helps to form solid waste, but it's not involved in the significant absorption of nutrients.

94
00:11:04,342 --> 00:11:08,583
And lastly, the liver does not absorb any nutrients from the digestive system.

95
00:11:08,803 --> 00:11:17,844
Instead, it processes and it stores nutrients after they have been absorbed by the small intestine.

96
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:32,027
So the small intestine is the primary site for nutrient absorption in the body, while the large intestine, colon, and liver have very different functions in the digestive system and they do not absorb nutrients.

97
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:49,024
As soon as this invader enters the body, the body initiates immunological responses.

98
00:11:49,364 --> 00:11:52,046
Which of the following is the name of this invader?

99
00:11:52,066 --> 00:12:01,911
Is it A, foreign particles, B, pathogen, C, toxin, or D, vaccine?

100
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:09,175
The correct answer is B, pathogen.

101
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:18,071
So a pathogen is a harmful microorganism.

102
00:12:18,131 --> 00:12:26,354
This can be anything such as a virus, a bacteria, or a fungus, and a pathogen can cause disease.

103
00:12:26,394 --> 00:12:34,137
So when a pathogen enters the body, it triggers an immune response because the body is recognizing it as a threat.

104
00:12:34,953 --> 00:12:38,675
On the TEAS exam, you're going to want to make sure that you study microorganisms.

105
00:12:38,715 --> 00:12:59,567
You're going to want to make sure that you understand different types of transmissions of diseases, immunity responses, as well as you're going to want to have a really good understanding of the different types of microorganisms, the harmful kinds like a pathogen, and also the beneficial kind.

106
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,644
Which of the following muscles do circulating hormones stimulate?

107
00:13:09,565 --> 00:13:14,349
Extension, flexor, skeletal, or smooth?

108
00:13:18,712 --> 00:13:23,797
Okay, the answer for this question is D, smooth muscles.

109
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,802
Okay, so smooth muscles

110
00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:37,381
are found in places like the walls of the blood vessels, the digestive tract, as well as the bladder.

111
00:13:37,741 --> 00:13:50,065
And they respond to circulating hormones in the body, which can cause them to contract or relax to help control processes like blood flow, digestion, as well as waste elimination.

112
00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:57,487
These muscles work automatically, meaning involuntarily, and are directly affected by hormones.

113
00:13:59,377 --> 00:14:02,719
The other three answer choices are incorrect, so let's talk about why.

114
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:07,061
So extension is a type of movement, it's not a type of muscle.

115
00:14:08,562 --> 00:14:14,045
Flexors are a type of muscle that causes bending at the joints, like when you bend your elbow.

116
00:14:14,785 --> 00:14:20,308
Flexor muscles are usually skeletal muscles that are controlled by the nervous system, not by hormones.

117
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:28,252
And then skeletal muscles are the muscles attached to the bones that control voluntary movements like walking or

118
00:14:28,705 --> 00:14:30,326
picking up a piece of apple pie.

119
00:14:30,987 --> 00:14:35,210
These muscles are controlled by nerve signals rather than by hormones.

120
00:14:40,194 --> 00:14:47,300
If this practice test is making you feel like you definitely have some studying to do in the science section, just know that you are not alone.

121
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,423
And that is exactly why the T7 online course exists.

122
00:14:51,810 --> 00:15:03,558
The T7 online course helps you relearn and freshen up your knowledge about everything that we've seen so far on the science topics, that's A&P, chemistry, scientific reasoning, and biology.

123
00:15:04,038 --> 00:15:10,422
In addition, the T7 online course goes over everything you need to know for reading, English, and math.

124
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,104
You're gonna have way more than just practice questions.

125
00:15:13,124 --> 00:15:20,049
You're also going to find flashcards, educational video lessons, and interactive study modules.

126
00:15:21,564 --> 00:15:27,469
and get everything you need to pass your TEAS exam with Smart Addition Academy's T7 online course.

127
00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:31,652
Check it out at www.smartadditionacademy.com.

128
00:15:33,254 --> 00:15:37,818
Okay, so this is our first question on scientific reasoning.

129
00:15:37,878 --> 00:15:43,322
You are going to have eight scored scientific reasoning questions.

130
00:15:43,823 --> 00:15:50,108
When you take your real TEAS exam, scientific reasoning is anything like designing an experiment,

131
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:58,591
scientific method, inductive, deductive, reasoning, as well as things like conversions and scientific measurements.

132
00:15:58,712 --> 00:16:07,314
So which of the following actions contribute to minimizing bias when selecting a sample for an experiment?

133
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:19,458
Selecting participants based on personal beliefs, using convenience sampling methods, ensuring that the sample represents the population of interest,

134
00:16:20,843 --> 00:16:24,606
choosing participants from a single geographic location.

135
00:16:24,626 --> 00:16:41,278
Okay so the correct answer for this is going to be C, ensuring that the sample represents the population of interest.

136
00:16:42,712 --> 00:16:46,294
So with this question, it's asking you about eliminating bias.

137
00:16:46,354 --> 00:16:55,180
So when you're conducting an experiment, it's important that you have a sample that accurately represents the larger population in which you are studying.

138
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:06,847
This helps ensure that the findings are reliable and they can be applied to the whole population, not just a specific group like question D talking about a specific geographic area.

139
00:17:07,507 --> 00:17:14,733
By selecting a representative sample, you minimize bias, meaning your results are going to be more fair and accurate.

140
00:17:19,697 --> 00:17:28,624
If a person smells something sweet, which of the following forms of information is this initially perceived as in the nervous system?

141
00:17:29,825 --> 00:17:35,210
Cognitive, integrative, motor, or sensory?

142
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:43,177
The correct answer is sensory.

143
00:17:48,421 --> 00:17:54,806
So when a person smells something sweet, the information is first picked up by the sensory receptors in the nose.

144
00:17:55,386 --> 00:17:58,909
And these receptors send signals to the brain about the smell.

145
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:01,874
which is an example of sensory information.

146
00:18:02,734 --> 00:18:11,316
Sensory information can be defined as data gathered from the senses like smell, taste, touch, hearing, and sight.

147
00:18:12,497 --> 00:18:15,017
Here's why the other answers are not correct.

148
00:18:15,097 --> 00:18:20,159
So a cognitive process includes things like thinking, reasoning, and understanding.

149
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:26,701
Recognizing and thinking about a smell might come later, but the initial detection of the sweet smell is sensory.

150
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:27,681
It's not cognitive.

151
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:36,263
Your integrative processes, they happen when the brain combines sensory information with other information to make sense of it.

152
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:46,709
But since we're talking about the initial perception of the sweet smell is purely sensory, the integrative aspect of it would happen after the sensory data is received.

153
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:53,313
And motor information involves movement, like moving your muscles to walk or grab something sweet.

154
00:18:53,774 --> 00:18:58,817
Smelling something is not related to movement, so it does not involve motor information.

155
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:08,240
While hiking, a person is startled after encountering a bear.

156
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:12,064
Her palms get sweaty and her heart starts racing.

157
00:19:12,324 --> 00:19:17,109
Which of the following parts of her nervous system was directly stimulated?

158
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:24,657
Central, parasympathetic, somatic, or sympathetic?

159
00:19:33,957 --> 00:19:36,138
The answer is D, sympathetic.

160
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:50,864
So the sympathetic nervous system is part of the anatomic nervous system and it is responsible for that fight or flight response that we are all so familiar with.

161
00:19:51,365 --> 00:20:03,090
So when a person is encountering something scary or stressful like a bear on a hike, the sympathetic nervous system would be activated causing physical changes such as sweaty palms and a racing heart.

162
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,963
These reactions are basically preparing the body to either fight the bear or flee from the danger of the bear.

163
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:18,967
So central nervous system would be incorrect because the CNS consists of the brain and the spinal cord.

164
00:20:19,387 --> 00:20:33,794
And while the CNS processes the information and sends the signals, the physical reactions like the sweaty palms and the racing heart are controlled by the anatomic nervous system, not in the CNS directly.

165
00:20:35,352 --> 00:20:46,185
The parasympathetic nervous system is the rest and digest system, which just helps the body relax and return to a normal state after a stressful event.

166
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:50,770
So in this case, it would slow down the heart rate and calm the body down.

167
00:20:52,564 --> 00:21:08,383
The somnomic nervous system controls involuntary movements like moving muscles to walk or pick up something, but it doesn't control the anatomic or automatic reactions like sweating and heart rate changes in response to stress.

168
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:27,496
Which of the following types of tissues include cells of the immune system and of the blood?

169
00:21:28,517 --> 00:21:34,479
Connective, epithelial, muscles, or neural?

170
00:21:39,862 --> 00:21:42,263
The answer is A, connective.

171
00:21:43,682 --> 00:21:56,208
Connective tissue is a broad category of tissue that includes several types of cells including cells of the immune system like white blood cells and cells of the blood like red and white blood cells.

172
00:21:57,329 --> 00:22:05,293
So blood is considered a type of connective tissue because it connects and it transports essential substances throughout the body.

173
00:22:06,537 --> 00:22:09,740
So epithelial tissue covers the surfaces of the body.

174
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,803
This is things like the lining of the organs or the skin.

175
00:22:13,283 --> 00:22:17,807
It acts as a protective barrier, but does not contain immune or blood cells.

176
00:22:18,828 --> 00:22:22,992
Muscle tissue is responsible for movement, and it is made up of muscle cells.

177
00:22:24,032 --> 00:22:28,777
And neural tissues make up the brain, the spinal cord, and of course, the nerves.

178
00:22:29,297 --> 00:22:34,098
It's involved in transmitting nerve signals, but it does not include blood or immune cells.

179
00:22:34,418 --> 00:22:37,459
So that's why connective tissue is the correct answer.

180
00:22:37,979 --> 00:22:41,800
Which of the following correctly describes homeostasis?

181
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:57,803
A functional system of the body, blood flow to every cell in the body, a relatively constant environment within the body, or neural pathways that have integrated into the body.

182
00:23:05,944 --> 00:23:10,707
The correct answer is C, a relatively constant environment within the body.

183
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:21,675
So homeostasis refers to the body's ability to maintain a stable internal environment despite changes in the external environment.

184
00:23:21,715 --> 00:23:29,461
So this can include things like keeping the body temperature regulated, blood pressure, and pH levels within a narrow and optimal

185
00:23:30,054 --> 00:23:31,815
range for proper functioning.

186
00:23:32,395 --> 00:23:38,437
The body uses feedback mechanisms to regulate these processes and ensures that everything stays in balance.

187
00:23:39,597 --> 00:23:53,722
When you take your TEAS exam, not only should you expect to answer questions for each of the systems within the A and P questions, you'll definitely be presented on questions on homeostasis.

188
00:23:53,762 --> 00:23:57,463
So make sure that you have a really good understanding of homeostasis.

189
00:23:58,057 --> 00:24:04,419
So fertilization, which is the fusing of one sperm and an ovum, results in which of the following?

190
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:11,440
Embryo, fetus, an infant, or a zygote?

191
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:16,381
The correct answer here is a zygote.

192
00:24:21,223 --> 00:24:27,324
So fertilization occurs when a sperm cell from the male fuses with an ovum,

193
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:30,216
also known as an egg from a female.

194
00:24:30,716 --> 00:24:34,178
This union forms a single cell called a zygote.

195
00:24:34,678 --> 00:24:40,761
The zygote contains all of the genetic material needed to develop into a new organism.

196
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:45,643
It is basically the very first stage after fertilization.

197
00:24:46,863 --> 00:24:53,686
So an embryo, a fetus, and an infant will all happen after that, after the zygote is formed.

198
00:24:53,746 --> 00:24:57,288
They're basically just later stages of development.

199
00:24:57,825 --> 00:25:02,589
Which of the following are included in the male reproductive system?

200
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:17,603
The penis and the epididymis, the vas deferens and uterus, the penis and the fallopian tubes, the penis, scrotum, and cervix.

201
00:25:20,722 --> 00:25:24,284
The answer is A, the penis and the epididymis.

202
00:25:24,725 --> 00:25:38,614
So the penis and the epididymis are both inside of the male reproductive system, which are the organs responsible for producing and delivering sperm for reproduction purposes.

203
00:25:39,134 --> 00:25:46,800
The penis is the external organ used for sexual intercourse and the delivery of sperm, while the epididymis is a coiled tube

204
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:51,870
located behind the testes where sperm mature and are stored.

205
00:25:53,992 --> 00:26:00,837
Technically, the scrotum and the vas deferens are also part of the reproductive system.

206
00:26:00,978 --> 00:26:05,641
However, the uterus and the cervix are part of the female reproductive system.

207
00:26:06,142 --> 00:26:08,584
So those answers are incorrect.

208
00:26:09,044 --> 00:26:16,570
Which phenomenon begins with red blood cells releasing oxygen to the other cells in the body?

209
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:29,889
Is it air conduction, cellular respiration, internal respiration, or pulmonary ventilation?

210
00:26:41,293 --> 00:26:45,395
So the correct answer here is C, internal respiration.

211
00:26:45,947 --> 00:27:04,039
Before we talk about why internal respiration is the correct answer, I do wanna make a point that on your TEAS exam, you should be prepared to study cellular respiration, cellular reproduction are all things that you should study as they may show up on the biology questions of your exam.

212
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:14,106
So internal respiration is the process where oxygen is released from the red blood cells into the tissues and the cells of the body.

213
00:27:14,751 --> 00:27:25,613
this occurs in the capillaries where oxygen moves from the blood to the cells and carbon dioxide moves from the cells into the blood to be carried away for exhalation.

214
00:27:26,153 --> 00:27:31,854
This is a crucial part of how the body gets oxygen to the cells and removes waste gases.

215
00:27:32,335 --> 00:27:39,196
So air conduction refers to the movement of air through the respiratory system such as like through the nose and through the trachea

216
00:27:39,805 --> 00:27:45,708
but it does not directly involve the exchange of oxygen between blood and the body cells.

217
00:27:46,808 --> 00:27:57,413
Cellular respiration is the process by which cells use oxygen to produce energy, also known as ATP, and release carbohydrate as a waste product.

218
00:27:57,993 --> 00:28:07,017
But this process happens inside of cells, and it's not really about the release of oxygen from red blood cells like this question is asking.

219
00:28:08,157 --> 00:28:09,658
And pulmonary ventilation

220
00:28:10,308 --> 00:28:14,389
is the process of basically breathing in or inhaling and breathing out.

221
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:25,833
And it involves the movement of air into and out of the lungs, but it does not directly involve the exchange of gases between the blood and the body tissue.

222
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:34,816
So that is why internal respiration is correct because it is the exchange of gases like oxygen between the blood and the body's cells.

223
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:39,437
The correct answer is D, the cardiovascular system.

224
00:28:40,008 --> 00:28:52,955
So hemopoiethesis is the process by which blood cells, such as red blood cells, are produced and it occurs in the bone marrow of the skeletal system.

225
00:28:53,515 --> 00:29:00,378
So once these blood cells are produced, they enter the bloodstream, which is then part of the cardiovascular system.

226
00:29:00,899 --> 00:29:09,623
The blood cells are then transported throughout the body via blood vessels, playing crucial roles in oxygen transport, immune defense, and clotting.

227
00:29:11,727 --> 00:29:21,450
The other systems such as the urinary, digestive, and muscular system, they just don't play a direct role in the production or the transportation of blood cells.

228
00:29:21,951 --> 00:29:27,692
So the urethra is the final structure through which urine travels to exit the body.

229
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:36,255
When it's time to urinate, the urine moves from the bladder through the urethra and then it is expelled from the body.

230
00:29:36,596 --> 00:29:40,737
Why did it take many years for the cell theory to be developed?

231
00:29:43,053 --> 00:29:46,056
Advancements in microscopy took place slowly.

232
00:29:47,297 --> 00:29:51,181
Cells were difficult to isolate for experimental analysis.

233
00:29:52,642 --> 00:29:56,586
Researchers believed a cell formed from pre-existing cells.

234
00:29:57,607 --> 00:30:00,950
Or scientists already proved that cells were essential for life.

235
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:09,865
Okay, the correct answer here is advancements in microscopy took place slowly.

236
00:30:10,386 --> 00:30:27,120
And before I dive a little deeper into why this is the correct answer, I do also want to say that this is cell theory as well as microscopy is going to be something that you should expect at least one to two questions on, on your exam.

237
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,802
It's really important to understand

238
00:30:31,323 --> 00:30:37,565
pretty much everything there is to know about cells from a biology subject matter context.

239
00:30:37,645 --> 00:30:47,889
So cell type, cell function, plant cell versus animal cell, cellular respiration, and cellular reproduction as I mentioned earlier.

240
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:50,370
In addition, you want to know

241
00:30:51,845 --> 00:31:00,590
microscopy in terms of the different types of popular microscopes that you would use in a scientific lab setting.

242
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:08,774
And you also want to know things like the different types of like glass containers, different types of scales and things like that.

243
00:31:08,814 --> 00:31:18,880
And you want to understand the advantages and different that you want to understand the advantages as well as the disadvantages of different types of microscopes.

244
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,421
So as a refresher,

245
00:31:20,955 --> 00:31:28,500
The cell theory states that all the things are made up of cells and that cells are the basic unit of structure and function in living things.

246
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:42,589
But it took a really long time for this idea to develop because microscopy technology, which is the tools you use to actually see the cells, it really took a while to improve and develop over time.

247
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:50,474
Early microscopes were not powerful enough to observe the small details of cells and scientists really could not make accurate

248
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:54,769
conclusions about cells until the microscopes got better.

249
00:31:55,269 --> 00:32:03,032
Which term describes complex carbohydrate molecules consisting of numerous monosaccharide units?

250
00:32:05,032 --> 00:32:14,095
Is it monomers, diosaccharides, polysaccharides, or oligosaccharides?

251
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,736
So this is one of those questions

252
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:26,712
that I was alluding to in the beginning of the video when we first had that question about enzymes that help digest proteins.

253
00:32:26,832 --> 00:32:35,415
And I was saying that it's really important to have a good understanding of macromolecules because you will see questions on it kind of in an A and P context.

254
00:32:35,556 --> 00:32:46,900
And then you're going to see questions on macromolecules in more of a biology context, which is going to be just a little bit more detailed than what you would see in an A and P setting.

255
00:32:47,578 --> 00:32:48,858
This is a prime example of that.

256
00:32:49,338 --> 00:32:52,499
And the correct answer here is polysaccharides.

257
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:10,263
So polysaccharides is a complex carbohydrate made up of many monosaccharide units, which is basically what this question is asking.

258
00:33:11,283 --> 00:33:14,944
Monosaccharide is a simple sugar and it's linked together.

259
00:33:15,652 --> 00:33:28,945
Polysaccharides can be very large molecules and include substances like starch, glycerin, and cellulose, which are important for energy storage and structural support in organisms.

260
00:33:30,006 --> 00:33:32,689
So let's talk about why the other options are not correct here.

261
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:39,255
So a monomer is a single molecule that can bind to other molecules to form a polymer.

262
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:53,891
In this case, the monosaccharides are the monomers that make up larger carbohydrates, but monomers by themselves are not complex carbohydrates, which is specifically described in this question.

263
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:57,233
So if you said answer choice A, I can understand why.

264
00:33:59,195 --> 00:34:05,160
A diosaccharide is a carbohydrate composed of two monosaccharide units.

265
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,444
This question specifically asked for several or many

266
00:34:11,598 --> 00:34:16,721
So that is why this question, that is why this answer isn't correct.

267
00:34:17,081 --> 00:34:25,565
Oligosaccharides are carbohydrates made up of a few monosaccharides, usually somewhere between like three and 10.

268
00:34:26,025 --> 00:34:37,691
And so while they are larger than diacycrites, they are not as large or as complex as polysaccharides, which have many more of those units.

269
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:45,721
Polysaccharides are large, complex carbohydrates made up of many monosaccharide units.

270
00:34:46,201 --> 00:34:53,502
They have more than any of the other options listed on here, which is why polysaccharides is the correct answer.

271
00:34:56,023 --> 00:35:03,064
Which of the following organelles is not separated from the cytoplasm due to the presence of its own membrane?

272
00:35:04,264 --> 00:35:08,945
The mitochondrion, the nucleus, the ribosome,

273
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:10,502
the vacuole.

274
00:35:16,064 --> 00:35:20,145
So the correct answer here is C, the bribosome.

275
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:29,728
So the question is asking organelles is not separated from the cytoplasm due to the presence of its own membrane.

276
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:30,368
So

277
00:35:31,258 --> 00:35:37,040
As a refresher, the ribosomes are a small structure in cells that make proteins.

278
00:35:37,481 --> 00:35:41,162
What makes them unique is that they do not have a membrane around them.

279
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:48,445
This means that they are directly in the cytoplasm, which is the jelly-like substance that fills the cell.

280
00:35:48,845 --> 00:35:52,187
I'm gonna add a picture of it here so you can see it.

281
00:35:53,507 --> 00:35:57,089
So let's talk about the other answer choices here.

282
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:59,770
So the mitochondrion

283
00:36:01,122 --> 00:36:05,483
is the part of the cell that makes the energy.

284
00:36:05,623 --> 00:36:12,544
It actually has a double membrane, which means it has two layers of membrane and that separates it from the cytoplasm.

285
00:36:13,285 --> 00:36:16,965
Then we've got the nucleus, which holds all of the cell's DNA.

286
00:36:17,365 --> 00:36:22,586
The nucleus is surrounded by nuclear membrane, which separates it from the cytoplasm.

287
00:36:23,187 --> 00:36:25,007
And then lastly we've got the vacuole,

288
00:36:25,468 --> 00:36:36,412
which is the storage organelles within the cells and they hold things like water and nutrients and they have a membrane around them to keep their contents separate from the cytoplasm.

289
00:36:36,812 --> 00:36:49,777
So that is why the ribosome is correct because it's the only organelle of these answer choices that does not have a membrane and it is the only one that is directly in the cytoplasm.

290
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:56,814
Which of the following is a primary use of microscopy in healthcare?

291
00:36:57,294 --> 00:36:58,735
Another microscope question.

292
00:36:59,976 --> 00:37:12,364
Administering treatments for chronic diseases, diagnosing infections, performing surgical procedures, or prescribing medications?

293
00:37:12,384 --> 00:37:19,209
Okay, the correct answer is B, diagnosing infections.

294
00:37:24,747 --> 00:37:41,210
So microscopy is a crucial tool in healthcare because it allows medical professionals to examine tiny organisms, things like bacteria and viruses up close or any cells that might be abnormal, that might be causing an infection or a disease.

295
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:54,173
So by using a microscope, doctors can identify pathogens in samples such as from blood or urine or tissues, which helps them diagnose infections as well as other conditions or diseases.

296
00:37:57,213 --> 00:38:04,376
In a DNA double helix, adaline is a nucleotide base that pairs with which of the following?

297
00:38:09,197 --> 00:38:11,498
The correct answer here is thymine.

298
00:38:11,918 --> 00:38:21,142
Okay, so in a DNA double helix, the nucleotide bases pair up in a very specific way to form the structure of the DNA molecule.

299
00:38:21,862 --> 00:38:24,703
And the base pairing follows essentially these rules.

300
00:38:25,418 --> 00:38:29,280
So we've got adaline always pairs with thymine.

301
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,801
That's our correct answer.

302
00:38:31,641 --> 00:38:38,104
And then we have cytosine always pairs with guanine.

303
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:43,367
And this is because of the very specific chemical bonds that form between the bases.

304
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:49,550
Specifically, adaline and thymine form two hydrogen bonds with each other and

305
00:38:50,932 --> 00:38:55,314
and cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds.

306
00:38:55,754 --> 00:39:02,378
So this complementary base pairing is crucial for DNA replication and maintaining the structure of genetic code.

307
00:39:02,898 --> 00:39:08,741
And so when you are studying for your cheese exam, you should definitely be prepared to see questions just like this.

308
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:14,984
You're going to be asked questions on genetics and DNA, and you're also going to

309
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,342
potentially see questions on Punnett Square.

310
00:39:18,402 --> 00:39:21,925
So brush up on your information regarding genetics and DNA.

311
00:39:22,225 --> 00:39:28,610
A patient's medication prescription is for 75 milligrams of a drug.

312
00:39:29,371 --> 00:39:37,657
If the tablets come in 25 milligram doses, which of the following indicates how many tablets should the patient take?

313
00:39:39,078 --> 00:39:43,082
One, two, three, or four.

314
00:39:54,526 --> 00:40:03,350
Well, the answer here is three tablets because three times 25 would equal 75 milligram.

315
00:40:03,751 --> 00:40:09,593
Which of the following is the primary advantage of using a light microscope?

316
00:40:11,674 --> 00:40:17,017
It provides higher resolution and magnification than electron microscopes.

317
00:40:18,058 --> 00:40:22,680
It allows for the observation of live microorganisms in real time.

318
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:27,933
It can visualize viruses and subcellular organelles.

319
00:40:28,773 --> 00:40:33,155
It is more complex and expensive than electron microscopes.

320
00:40:40,379 --> 00:40:47,262
So the answer here is B. It allows for the observation of live microorganisms in real time.

321
00:40:48,002 --> 00:40:51,224
Don't say I didn't tell you that you would

322
00:40:52,086 --> 00:40:54,047
have questions on microscopes.

323
00:40:54,067 --> 00:41:00,370
So you definitely want to make sure that you know light microscopes as well as electron microscopes.

324
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:08,534
So the primary advantage of a light microscope is that it is easier to use, it's more affordable, and it allows for the observation of live specimen.

325
00:41:09,114 --> 00:41:21,340
In contrast, an electron microscope offers much higher magnification and resolution and it allows for a super detailed examination of structures, but it's really more of like at a molecular

326
00:41:22,038 --> 00:41:29,523
or an anatomic level, and it requires specimens to be non-living and often prepared in very specific ways.

327
00:41:31,504 --> 00:41:35,486
So that is why light microscopes are awesome.

328
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:45,913
Which of the following ions from a base react with hydrogen ions in a neutralization reaction?

329
00:41:57,224 --> 00:42:00,547
Okay, the answer is going to be B, hydroxide.

330
00:42:00,887 --> 00:42:08,394
So in a neutralization reaction, a base reacts with an acid to produce water and a salt.

331
00:42:09,115 --> 00:42:20,405
The key to this reaction is the interaction between hydroxide ions from the base and the hydrogen ions from the acid.

332
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:22,387
So the,

333
00:42:24,511 --> 00:42:35,019
Hydroxic ions from the base react with the hydrogen ions from the acid to form water, which then neutralizes the solution.

334
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:41,825
Which of the following is classified as a type of acid-base reaction that produces a salt?

335
00:42:43,046 --> 00:42:49,311
Combination, decomposition, hydrolysis, or neutralization?

336
00:42:49,331 --> 00:42:52,113
So the answer here is neutralization.

337
00:42:55,877 --> 00:43:03,002
So in a neutralization reaction, an acid reacts with a base to produce a salt and water.

338
00:43:03,702 --> 00:43:15,410
So for example, when a hydrochloric acid reacts with sodium hydroxide, it forms sodium chloride, which is a salt and a water.

339
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:21,534
This is the classic acid-base reaction that produces as a salt as a product.

340
00:43:22,614 --> 00:43:23,655
This is the classic

341
00:43:24,186 --> 00:43:27,788
acid-base reaction that produces a salt as a product.

342
00:43:30,989 --> 00:43:34,491
So let's touch upon why the other options are not correct.

343
00:43:34,571 --> 00:43:46,017
So a combination reaction involves two or more substances combining to form a single product, but it doesn't specifically produce a salt from an acid and a base.

344
00:43:48,173 --> 00:43:55,114
A decomposition reaction involves a single compound breaking down into two or more simpler substances.

345
00:43:55,614 --> 00:43:59,295
This is not an acid-base reaction and it does not produce a salt.

346
00:44:01,855 --> 00:44:10,697
And lastly, hydrolysis involves the breakdown of a compound by water simply to form ions or molecules.

347
00:44:10,817 --> 00:44:14,558
It is not an acid-base reaction and it does not produce a salt.

348
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:38,084
In addition to your A&P questions, your scientific reasoning questions, and your biology questions, as you see here, you are going to be tested on your chemistry, knowledge, and comprehension, which seems scary for a lot of people, especially if you just have not taken a chemistry class as recently as maybe you took your A&P classes.

349
00:44:38,644 --> 00:44:45,389
So for the chemistry questions on the TEAS exam, you're gonna need to know things like acids and bases,

350
00:44:46,107 --> 00:45:00,661
trends of the periodic table, the types of chemical reactions, the type of chemical bonds, you're gonna need to know about chemical solutions, formulas, and equations, things like calculating moles, molarity, molality, and things like that.

351
00:45:00,761 --> 00:45:10,670
So if it's been a hot minute and chemistry scares you or really just preparing for the TEAS in general scares you and seems overwhelming,

352
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:14,572
I highly recommend that you check out our TEAS online course.

353
00:45:14,692 --> 00:45:24,036
It has everything that you need to study in one single place for your TEAS exam, not only for science, but also for reading, English, and math.

354
00:45:24,816 --> 00:45:40,863
But specifically, students love our science study materials because it's really short and sweet and simple to understand study lessons, but they also include lots of videos, lots of PDFs, as well as interactive practice questions and flashcards, so people

355
00:45:41,327 --> 00:45:46,230
really find those beneficial, especially visual learners or people that are on the go.

356
00:45:46,611 --> 00:45:56,097
So definitely check out the TEAS online course, open up a new tab right now and go to www.smartadditionacademy.com.

357
00:45:56,297 --> 00:45:58,779
Okay, let's get into the next question now.

358
00:46:04,963 --> 00:46:09,927
Which of the following methods helps to eliminate bias in an experiment?

359
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:28,441
So the correct answer here is a random assignment of participants to experimental groups.

360
00:46:32,663 --> 00:46:48,748
So this is our second question on eliminating bias and random assignment of participants to experimental groups is gonna be the best way to eliminate bias because you want the results to be as

361
00:46:49,920 --> 00:47:04,633
easy to replicate as possible and straying away from using people because of a personal preference or specific age groups or a specific environment or geographic location like the previous question had asked.

362
00:47:05,394 --> 00:47:15,403
The more random, the better for eliminating bias and the more you eliminate bias, the easier it is to replicate your experiment

363
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:26,665
So which of the following types of bond forms between nitrogen and oxygen and why?

364
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:32,211
The correct answer here is covalent because electrons are shared.

365
00:47:32,592 --> 00:47:39,379
So a covalent bond forms when two atoms share electrons in order to fill their outer electron shells.

366
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:42,522
In the case of nitrogen and oxygen,

367
00:47:43,154 --> 00:47:50,059
both elements need electrons to complete their outer shells so they share electrons to form a stable bond.

368
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:56,143
This type of bond is called a covalent bond where electrons are shared between the two atoms.

369
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:58,825
So let's talk about why the other ones are incorrect.

370
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:10,589
ionic bond because electrons are shared so ionic bonds form when electrons are transferred from one atom to another not shared.

371
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:20,333
The second one ionic because electrons are transferred so while ionic bonds do involve the transfer of electrons like we just discussed

372
00:48:20,933 --> 00:48:25,874
Nitrogen and oxygen form a covalent bond, not an ionic bond.

373
00:48:26,254 --> 00:48:34,776
They both have similar electronegativity, ability to attract electrons, so they share electrons rather than transferring them.

374
00:48:35,936 --> 00:48:39,237
And lastly, a covalent bond because electrons are transferred.

375
00:48:39,257 --> 00:48:46,278
We've sort of talked about this, but this is incorrect because in a covalent bond, electrons are shared, not transferred.

376
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,121
So when electrons are shared, it forms an ionic bond.

377
00:48:50,141 --> 00:49:01,925
So again, it's really important to know what covalent bonds are, what ionic bonds are, what they do, what they don't do, and just really have a deeper understanding of chemistry on that level.

378
00:49:01,985 --> 00:49:08,728
So again, if you need a refresher on all of these different chemistry topics, be sure to check out the online course.

379
00:49:15,413 --> 00:49:18,936
So which of the following atoms is a cation?

380
00:49:19,577 --> 00:49:27,583
Okay, the correct answer here is D, 82 protons, 125 neutrons, and 78 electrons.

381
00:49:29,785 --> 00:49:36,951
So a cation is an ion that has a positive charge, which means it has more protons than it has electrons.

382
00:49:37,415 --> 00:49:47,978
So when an atom loses electrons, it becomes positively charged because protons, which are positively charged, outnumber the electrons, which are negatively charged.

383
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:56,540
So with the answer choice D, 82 protons, 125 neutrons, 78 electrons, this atom has 82 protons and 78 electrons, which means that it has four more protons than electrons.

384
00:50:05,033 --> 00:50:08,237
which means it is a positively charged ion or a cation.

385
00:50:08,277 --> 00:50:11,841
The positive charge is because there are more protons than electrons.

386
00:50:26,308 --> 00:50:29,950
A spoonful of sugar is added to a hot cup of coffee.

387
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,111
All of the sugar dissolves.

388
00:50:32,911 --> 00:50:36,773
Which of the following describes the resulting solution?

389
00:50:43,897 --> 00:50:48,279
The correct answer here is unsaturated and homeogenous.

390
00:50:49,923 --> 00:50:52,764
Let's break this correct answer down into two parts.

391
00:50:52,844 --> 00:51:03,789
So a solution is unsaturated when more solute, in this case sugar, can be dissolved in the solvent, which in this case is the tea, at the given temperature.

392
00:51:04,309 --> 00:51:16,494
So since the sugar dissolved completely and no solid sugar remains, there is still potential to dissolve more sugar, assuming the solution is not at its maximum capacity.

393
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:18,995
So in simple words,

394
00:51:20,581 --> 00:51:27,944
the person making the tea can decide to add even more sugar into the tea, it's not completely saturated.

395
00:51:27,964 --> 00:51:40,008
The second part of this answer is the solution is homogeneous because the sugar completely dissolves in the tea and you cannot see any distinct layers of separation.

396
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:47,860
So meaning the tea and the sugar have become completely mixed in a uniform fashion at a molecular level.

397
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:53,362
Once that sugar is in the tea, you really can't take the sugar out of it.

398
00:51:53,742 --> 00:51:56,704
You can add more sugar to it, but you can't take the sugar out of it.

399
00:51:57,104 --> 00:51:58,444
Once it's mixed, it's mixed.

400
00:51:59,625 --> 00:52:01,606
So that is why the correct answer is C.

401
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:15,946
In the following single replacement reaction, blank replaces blank.

402
00:52:18,827 --> 00:52:22,649
Okay, so the correct answer here is chlorine and iodine.

403
00:52:23,189 --> 00:52:30,272
So in a single replacement reaction, one element replaces another in a compound.

404
00:52:30,913 --> 00:52:33,714
So let's break down this reaction.

405
00:52:34,454 --> 00:52:38,776
The chlorine reacts with the sodium iodine,

406
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:53,590
The chlorine then displaces the iodine from the sodium iodide, forming sodium chloride and iodine gas.

407
00:52:54,431 --> 00:53:00,234
This means that the chlorine replaces the iodine in the compound.

408
00:53:00,714 --> 00:53:03,115
So let's talk about some of the other answer choices.

409
00:53:03,816 --> 00:53:05,877
So sodium and iodine.

410
00:53:06,979 --> 00:53:11,643
This is incorrect because the sodium does not replace iodine in this reaction.

411
00:53:12,123 --> 00:53:16,306
The sodium does not change or replace anything in the process.

412
00:53:18,088 --> 00:53:19,088
Chlorine and sodium.

413
00:53:19,228 --> 00:53:23,552
So this is incorrect because the chlorine does not replace sodium in this reaction.

414
00:53:24,673 --> 00:53:28,956
The chlorine replaces the iodine and the sodium remains the same.

415
00:53:30,627 --> 00:53:32,848
and then sodium and chlorine.

416
00:53:33,248 --> 00:53:36,710
This is incorrect because the sodium is not replacing the chlorine.

417
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:41,612
The chlorine is the element that is replacing iodine in the reaction.

418
00:53:51,078 --> 00:53:55,381
What type of reaction is described by the following equation?

419
00:53:55,981 --> 00:54:05,187
And if you're taking this test along with me and you're like, man, this feels like a lot of chemistry all of the sudden, I can definitely understand.

420
00:54:05,247 --> 00:54:10,250
So as a reminder, when you're taking the real TEAS exam, there's gonna be 50 questions.

421
00:54:10,751 --> 00:54:20,517
Some of those are going to be unscored, but you should expect 18 AMP questions, eight chemistry questions, nine biology questions,

422
00:54:21,036 --> 00:54:25,139
and eight scientific reasoning questions that are actually scored.

423
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:29,503
So sometimes students say, man, my test felt like really heavy one way or the other.

424
00:54:29,903 --> 00:54:34,507
It could be that those extra unscored questions were in one particular topic.

425
00:54:34,527 --> 00:54:47,037
It could be A and P or it could be chemistry or any of the above, but just in case you were feeling like that and thinking like that, that's why, but on the real exam, you will only have eight scored.

426
00:54:47,574 --> 00:54:48,534
chemistry questions.

427
00:54:48,734 --> 00:54:57,216
You may see more than eight questions, but only eight of them will be scored and know when you're taking the real test, they're not going to tell you which are scored and which are not.

428
00:54:57,716 --> 00:55:02,778
Okay, so the answer, the correct answer here is double replacement.

429
00:55:02,898 --> 00:55:12,160
So in a double replacement reaction, two compounds react and their positive and negative ions basically switch places

430
00:55:12,732 --> 00:55:14,773
forming two new compounds.

431
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:17,814
So let's break down this equation a little bit.

432
00:55:19,674 --> 00:55:26,876
So the zinc bromide and the potassium hydroxide are basically dissolved in water.

433
00:55:28,737 --> 00:55:38,720
The zinc bromide reacts with the potassium hydroxide to form zinc hydroxide, which then becomes a solid.

434
00:55:41,568 --> 00:55:44,829
potassium bromate stays in the solution.

435
00:55:46,329 --> 00:55:57,152
So in this reaction, the zinc and the potassium switch places with the bromine and hydroxide, making it a double replacement reaction.

436
00:55:57,972 --> 00:56:00,273
So let's talk about why the other options are not correct.

437
00:56:00,353 --> 00:56:07,675
So a synthesis reaction occurs when two or more simple substances combine to form a more complex substance.

438
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:14,095
That's not what's happening here because two compounds are basically breaking apart and forming new compounds.

439
00:56:14,375 --> 00:56:15,516
They're not combining.

440
00:56:17,137 --> 00:56:23,343
A decomposition reaction occurs when a single compound breaks into two or more simpler substances.

441
00:56:23,803 --> 00:56:29,848
And so again, in this reaction, we have two compounds reacting, not one breaking apart.

442
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:35,693
And then in a single replacement reaction, one element replaces another in a compound.

443
00:56:36,128 --> 00:56:42,232
So for example, if the zinc replaced the potassium, then it would be a single replacement reaction.

444
00:56:42,272 --> 00:56:49,958
However, here, the two compounds are reacting and they're exchanging ions, so it's not a single replacement reaction.

445
00:56:51,539 --> 00:56:55,822
Which of the following best illustrates multiple alleles?

446
00:56:56,983 --> 00:57:01,286
Blood type in humans with A, B, and O alleles.

447
00:57:02,447 --> 00:57:03,427
Height in humans.

448
00:57:05,412 --> 00:57:14,758
two alleles blending together to create a mixed phenotype or genes inherited from two different chromosomes.

449
00:57:22,663 --> 00:57:29,027
Okay, the correct answer here is blood type in humans with A, B, and O alleles.

450
00:57:29,587 --> 00:57:32,169
So the reason why answer A is correct is because

451
00:57:32,693 --> 00:57:39,778
Multiple alleles means that there are more than two possible forms of gene in a population, okay?

452
00:57:39,818 --> 00:57:50,867
Remember when I said earlier that you would definitely need to have a good understanding of genetics and DNA for your TEAS test, so this is a great example question of that knowledge coming up.

453
00:57:51,527 --> 00:58:01,475
So in the case of the human blood type, there are three different alleles in this variation, A, B, and O, that would determine the blood type.

454
00:58:02,095 --> 00:58:13,283
These alleles can combine in various ways to create the blood types we know, such as A, B, AB, and O. So let's talk about really quick why the other ones are incorrect here.

455
00:58:13,964 --> 00:58:15,805
So B, height in humans.

456
00:58:15,905 --> 00:58:23,291
So height can be influenced by many genes working together rather than one gene with multiple alleles.

457
00:58:26,233 --> 00:58:31,137
This is an example of what's called a polygenic trait, which means many genes

458
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:39,481
which means many genes affect one trait, not a case of multiple alleles like this question is asking.

459
00:58:40,501 --> 00:58:44,022
Two alleles blending together to create a mixed phenotype.

460
00:58:44,582 --> 00:58:51,045
So this is describing an incomplete dominance rather than multiple alleles.

461
00:58:51,105 --> 00:58:57,847
So when we talk about incomplete dominance, what that means is two alleles blend together to make a

462
00:58:58,467 --> 00:59:03,249
mixed phenotype, like red and white flowers creating pink, for example.

463
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:13,234
Multiple alleles involves more than two choices, like the correct answer, A, B, and O blood types, not just blending.

464
00:59:14,095 --> 00:59:18,257
And lastly, genes inherited from two different chromosomes.

465
00:59:18,317 --> 00:59:22,299
This is not correct because this is completely unrelated to multiple alleles.

466
00:59:22,779 --> 00:59:26,381
Multiple alleles refers to different forms of the same gene.

467
00:59:26,828 --> 00:59:29,850
not genes on separate chromosomes.

468
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:37,174
Which of the following phase changes will the cohesion between the particles of a substance decrease?

469
00:59:37,354 --> 00:59:46,479
So this is pulling in some of that states of matter and properties of matter information that you should also be aware of when prepping for your TEAS exam.

470
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:54,403
So we've got condensation, deposition, freezing, and vaporization.

471
01:00:00,211 --> 01:00:03,832
Okay, the correct answer here is D, vaporization.

472
01:00:03,852 --> 01:00:10,014
So vaporization is the phase change that talks about a liquid to a gas.

473
01:00:10,054 --> 01:00:14,195
So an example of this is when water boils and turns into steam.

474
01:00:14,735 --> 01:00:29,800
During this change, the particles move further apart and the cohesion or say like the attraction between them decreases significantly because they are moving more freely and they are no longer tightly connected into a liquid form.

475
01:00:31,453 --> 01:00:38,138
So condensation is incorrect because condensation is the change from a gas to a liquid.

476
01:00:38,598 --> 01:00:41,821
So when steam cools down and then turns back into water.

477
01:00:42,301 --> 01:00:50,327
So in this case, particles are moving closer together, which then increases cohesion rather than decreases it.

478
01:00:51,078 --> 01:01:05,743
When you are refreshing your knowledge on states of matter, properties of matter, one of the things that you're going to want to make sure that you have a really good understanding of is what happens in each of the different stages, specifically when it comes to cohesion.

479
01:01:05,863 --> 01:01:08,104
Are the particles moving quicker?

480
01:01:08,284 --> 01:01:09,244
Are they moving slower?

481
01:01:09,404 --> 01:01:12,085
Are the particles slower and further apart?

482
01:01:12,325 --> 01:01:13,766
Or are they closer together?

483
01:01:13,906 --> 01:01:14,626
Are they more dense?

484
01:01:14,646 --> 01:01:20,788
So you kind of want to have a good understanding of, during each of these phases, what is happening to the particles.

485
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:31,357
So deposition is not correct because deposition is the change from a gas directly to a solid, something like frost forming on a window.

486
01:01:31,797 --> 01:01:39,101
During deposition, particles come closer together and they form a solid, which then increases cohesion.

487
01:01:39,261 --> 01:01:45,884
So again, knowing what the particles are doing and if it is increasing or decreasing cohesion.

488
01:01:46,805 --> 01:01:51,267
And then lastly, freezing is the phase change from a liquid to a solid.

489
01:01:51,703 --> 01:02:02,547
So when water becomes ice and freezing, particles move closer together and they form a solid structure, again, increasing cohesion instead of decreasing it.

490
01:02:03,067 --> 01:02:12,110
Okay, so you are gonna see just a little tiny bit of math when you are answering the questions on the science section.

491
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:16,551
This may actually also come up just a little tiny bit on the reading section.

492
01:02:16,591 --> 01:02:19,012
Sometimes there's questions about like say recipes,

493
01:02:20,034 --> 01:02:43,539
there's a question about you know how much time passed between the time that Bob arrived to the party and Stacy left so some of that information will be given to you it's typically pretty simple straightforward math so don't stress out too too much but here we've got kind of a math problem so let's tackle it together a patient's blood pressure is a hundred

494
01:02:44,308 --> 01:02:57,923
40 millimeters of mercury convert this pressure to kilopascals given that 1 mmHg is approximately 0.133 kPa.

495
01:02:58,564 --> 01:03:03,209
So while you're working out the math I do want to remind you that in most cases

496
01:03:03,763 --> 01:03:05,825
conversions are not provided to you.

497
01:03:05,905 --> 01:03:11,049
So when you take the math section, the formulas and the conversions are not provided to you.

498
01:03:11,269 --> 01:03:16,273
You are expected to have them memorized for the most common conversions.

499
01:03:16,353 --> 01:03:27,502
So we're talking things like ounces to cups, cups to gallons, milligrams to grams, kilograms to pounds, like your standard metric conversions.

500
01:03:27,908 --> 01:03:35,792
But when it comes to something like this, that's very specific, like a kilopascal, a kilopascal is not something that they're gonna expect you to have memorized.

501
01:03:35,832 --> 01:03:45,878
So in this case, you're basically just doing a little bit of math to determine what the answer is, given what they have provided you.

502
01:03:45,958 --> 01:03:51,361
So the correct answer here is actually A, 18.62 kilopascals.

503
01:03:51,962 --> 01:03:55,944
So kilopascals, the way you needed to do here was 140,

504
01:03:58,930 --> 01:04:02,511
Multiply that by 0.133.

505
01:04:02,971 --> 01:04:04,692
This information was provided to you.

506
01:04:04,772 --> 01:04:13,534
So when you calculate that with the four function calculator that they will provide to you on the screen, you will see 18.62.

507
01:04:13,714 --> 01:04:17,175
So this math problem is relatively simple.

508
01:04:17,315 --> 01:04:22,997
It's really more so testing your knowledge of how you would calculate it, right?

509
01:04:24,077 --> 01:04:26,798
So it wanted to test you to make sure that you knew

510
01:04:27,382 --> 01:04:31,563
that you just needed to multiply this and that you didn't need to make it more complicated than that.

511
01:04:32,163 --> 01:04:37,025
Okay, so here is another question very similar to the one that we just answered.

512
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:45,387
In which of the following states of matter are the intermolecular forces between particles in a substance the strongest?

513
01:04:46,267 --> 01:04:50,088
Gas, liquid, plasma, or solid?

514
01:05:00,795 --> 01:05:04,356
Okay, the correct answer here is going to be a solid.

515
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:11,839
So in a solid, particles are packed very closely together, and they vibrate in a very fixed position.

516
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:24,703
The intermolecular forces, which basically is a very fancy way of saying forces that hold the particles together, are the strongest in a solid, which is why solids have a fixed shape and volume.

517
01:05:26,063 --> 01:05:28,584
Just remember that solids, they are the densest,

518
01:05:29,389 --> 01:05:30,649
they are the strongest.

519
01:05:30,749 --> 01:05:32,610
They have the strongest molecular force.

520
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:37,831
And with the plasma, so plasma is very similar to gas.

521
01:05:37,951 --> 01:05:39,891
It has a very high energy state.

522
01:05:40,431 --> 01:05:45,032
The particles are very far apart and they actually almost have no molecular force at all.

523
01:05:45,452 --> 01:05:52,794
Plasmas are actually made of charged particles that move freely, so the intermolecular forces are very very weak.

524
01:05:53,178 --> 01:05:55,219
just like they would be in a gas.

525
01:05:55,679 --> 01:06:11,324
Sequence of amino acids in a gene determines which of the following, the primary structure of a codon, the primary structure of a protein, the primary structure of a nucleotide, or the primary structure of a nucleic acid?

526
01:06:20,507 --> 01:06:21,747
Okay, the correct answer here

527
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:25,520
is the primary structure of a protein.

528
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:33,844
So the primary structure of a protein is the specific sequence of anemo acids that are linked together in a chain.

529
01:06:33,964 --> 01:06:40,308
And this sequence is determined by a gene which provides instructions on the order of the anemo acids.

530
01:06:40,648 --> 01:06:47,052
So the primary structure is sort of like a blueprint that determines the shape and the function of a protein.

531
01:06:47,492 --> 01:06:50,574
So let's talk about why the other answers are incorrect.

532
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:59,733
A codon is a sequence of three nucleotides in an mRNA that codes for a single enema acids.

533
01:07:00,213 --> 01:07:03,595
They are not made of enema acids, they are made of nucleotides.

534
01:07:04,035 --> 01:07:12,521
So the gene sequence determines the codons, which then helps specify the enema acids, but the final product is the protein.

535
01:07:14,242 --> 01:07:21,366
Let's take a look at C. So nucleotides here are the building blocks of DNA and RNA, not proteins.

536
01:07:22,223 --> 01:07:28,464
gene sequence is made up of nucleotides, but it doesn't directly determine the primary structure of a nucleotide.

537
01:07:28,884 --> 01:07:33,605
Instead, what it does is it determines the anemo acid sequence in a protein.

538
01:07:35,526 --> 01:07:38,346
And lastly, we have the primary structure of a nucleic acid.

539
01:07:38,366 --> 01:07:44,728
So nucleic acids are chains of nucleotides, not anemo acids.

540
01:07:44,948 --> 01:07:46,728
Basically, this is meant to

541
01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:52,615
to code for a protein, not to define another nucleic acid's structure.

542
01:07:52,635 --> 01:08:05,247
So the right answer here is the primary structure of a protein, because the gene sequence directly determines the sequence of enema acids, which then would form the protein's primary structure.

543
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:12,533
Which of the following is true regarding the urinary system?

544
01:08:13,233 --> 01:08:14,774
Select all that apply.

545
01:08:15,274 --> 01:08:22,979
So when you're taking your TEAS exam, version seven does have a few different question types.

546
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:34,907
For the most part, you're mostly still going to see multiple choice questions, like the ones we've been answering up until now, but you will see sometimes some select all that apply.

547
01:08:36,067 --> 01:08:37,148
You will also see

548
01:08:37,753 --> 01:08:42,476
question types that are fill in the blank, and you will also see ordered response.

549
01:08:42,956 --> 01:08:52,041
There is also another question type called hotspot, where you will be shown an image and you will basically have to click on the image for the correct answer.

550
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,462
You won't see too many of them, just a few.

551
01:08:55,783 --> 01:09:06,188
Okay, so for this particular answer, the correct answers here are, can these help regulate water balance?

552
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:06,989
Yes.

553
01:09:07,915 --> 01:09:16,897
they regulate levels of electrolytes such as sodium and potassium, also yes, and they eliminate mellabotic waste.

554
01:09:18,478 --> 01:09:28,000
What is not true, kidneys do not make urine, and if you are watching this and you're like, what are you talking about, of course they make urine, they don't.

555
01:09:29,135 --> 01:09:32,256
They don't, and we'll talk about that more in just a moment.

556
01:09:32,336 --> 01:09:36,697
They don't make urine in the sense that you might think that they do.

557
01:09:37,278 --> 01:09:38,098
They don't make urine.

558
01:09:38,958 --> 01:09:43,620
And as a person ages, kidney tissues infiltration capacity increases.

559
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,340
That is also not true.

560
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:47,321
So let's break this down just a little bit more.

561
01:09:48,741 --> 01:09:50,262
So let's start with the correct answers.

562
01:09:51,666 --> 01:09:53,667
Kidneys help regulate water balance.

563
01:09:53,687 --> 01:10:01,068
So yes, the kidneys control the amount of water in the body by adjusting how much water is reabsorbed or excreted in the urine.

564
01:10:01,529 --> 01:10:08,050
This helps keep a stable water balance, which is essential for maintaining blood pressure and just overall hydration.

565
01:10:10,251 --> 01:10:14,192
Regulates levels of electrolytes such as sodium and potassium.

566
01:10:16,077 --> 01:10:30,151
So yes, kidneys definitely play a role in balancing electrolytes, they filter blood and they adjust the levels of these minerals based on the body's needs, which is crucial for functions like muscle contraction and nerve signaling.

567
01:10:34,015 --> 01:10:35,595
eliminates melobotic waste.

568
01:10:35,736 --> 01:10:45,138
So yes, this is true because the kidneys filter out waste products from the blood such as urea and creatine, which are byproducts of metabolism.

569
01:10:45,638 --> 01:10:48,759
These wastes are then eliminated from the body in urine.

570
01:10:49,880 --> 01:11:01,283
Now before we talk about why the other two answer choices are not correct, I also just want to let you know that on the TEAS exam, there is no such thing as partial credit.

571
01:11:01,838 --> 01:11:11,345
So when you've got a question like this, that is select all that apply, if you selected four instead of three, you're not gonna get like a 50%.

572
01:11:12,026 --> 01:11:18,230
If there was three correct answers and you only selected two of them, you're not getting a 66% on that question.

573
01:11:18,871 --> 01:11:21,653
It simply just will not, it'll just be straight up wrong.

574
01:11:22,133 --> 01:11:23,934
Same with the fill in the blank questions.

575
01:11:23,994 --> 01:11:27,957
If you spell the word wrong, you're not getting that question right.

576
01:11:30,641 --> 01:11:31,521
Kidneys make urine.

577
01:11:31,582 --> 01:11:44,428
So kidneys do play a role in filtering blood and they play a role in forming urine, but they do not actually make urine in the simple sense.

578
01:11:45,208 --> 01:11:57,135
Instead, kidneys filter out wastes and they adjust water and electrolytes, which is then excreted as urine through other parts of the urinary system.

579
01:11:57,895 --> 01:11:59,816
What actually makes urine

580
01:12:00,775 --> 01:12:05,639
are things called nephrons, which is what kidneys are actually made up of.

581
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:13,966
And as a reminder, nephrons are basically the functional units of the kidneys where all of the process of urine formation occurs.

582
01:12:15,217 --> 01:12:17,818
Each kidneys has about a million nephrons.

583
01:12:18,238 --> 01:12:23,679
And lastly, as a person ages, kidney tissue infiltration capacity increase.

584
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:24,759
So this is incorrect.

585
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:26,680
The statement is actually the opposite.

586
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:31,961
As people age, kidney tissue infiltration capacity tend to decrease, not increase.

587
01:12:32,601 --> 01:12:38,383
Aging can lead to reduced kidney function, which makes it harder for the kidneys to filter blood effectively.

588
01:12:45,655 --> 01:12:48,958
During the aging process, not all hormone levels decrease.

589
01:12:49,479 --> 01:12:50,760
Some actually increase.

590
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:56,025
Which of the following is a hormone that may increase as a person ages?

591
01:12:56,985 --> 01:13:01,930
Cortisol, insulin, luteinizing, or thyroid?

592
01:13:11,058 --> 01:13:13,339
Okay, the correct answer here is luteinizing.

593
01:13:13,959 --> 01:13:19,602
So the luteinizing hormone is a hormone involved in regulating the reproductive system.

594
01:13:19,682 --> 01:13:35,129
So as people age, particularly during menopause in women, levels of what's called LH often increase because the body tries to stimulate hormone production from the ovaries, which are becoming less responsive.

595
01:13:35,651 --> 01:13:43,665
This increase in LH is a natural part of the aging process in both men and women, though it is typically seen more so in women.

596
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,441
So let's talk about why the other three are incorrect.

597
01:13:47,481 --> 01:13:54,626
So cortisol is a stress hormone that helps regulate metabolism, blood sugar, and immune responses.

598
01:13:54,846 --> 01:14:08,374
And though cortisol levels can fluctuate with age and may be higher during times of stress, hashtag adulting anybody, cortisol generally does not increase just as a result of the normal aging process.

599
01:14:08,474 --> 01:14:09,695
That's just life.

600
01:14:10,175 --> 01:14:13,477
It has nothing to do with aging specifically.

601
01:14:14,892 --> 01:14:15,352
insulin.

602
01:14:15,873 --> 01:14:32,547
So insulin is the hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels and with age cells in the body may become less sensitive to insulin which can lead to higher blood sugar levels but the actual production of insulin by the pancreas does not typically increase as part of the aging process.

603
01:14:33,867 --> 01:14:35,768
And lastly, the thyroid hormone.

604
01:14:35,868 --> 01:14:44,051
So the thyroid hormone helps control metabolism and their levels typically decrease or they stay about the same with age.

605
01:14:44,111 --> 01:14:45,071
It really just depends.

606
01:14:45,572 --> 01:14:54,275
Some people may develop a thyroid issue as they age, but an increase in the thyroid hormone is not part of the aging process.

607
01:14:58,969 --> 01:15:04,834
A science student needs to measure 50 milliliters of water for an experiment.

608
01:15:05,475 --> 01:15:09,618
Which of the following measuring instruments should the student use?

609
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:16,584
A 100 milliliter graduated cylinder, a 500 milliliter beaker, a 50 milliliter

610
01:15:21,014 --> 01:15:26,656
volumetric flask or a 250 milliliter Erlenmeyer flask.

611
01:15:27,316 --> 01:15:38,859
So we talked about questions like this in the beginning of the video with some of the things that you're going to need to know regarding those nine scientific reasoning questions.

612
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:47,201
It goes back to scientific measurements, the scientific method, how to design an experiment, inductive versus deductive reasoning.

613
01:15:47,241 --> 01:15:49,762
So this is an example of that kind of question.

614
01:15:50,927 --> 01:16:00,472
it's important for you to be able to differentiate when you need to measure something in a scientific lab, you know, what is appropriate.

615
01:16:00,572 --> 01:16:01,872
Is a cylinder appropriate?

616
01:16:01,952 --> 01:16:03,453
Is a beaker appropriate?

617
01:16:03,573 --> 01:16:05,494
Or is a flask appropriate?

618
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:12,417
And there's pros and cons and there's do's and don'ts when measuring for scientific purposes.

619
01:16:12,497 --> 01:16:13,418
So again,

620
01:16:13,885 --> 01:16:26,156
brushing up on that knowledge using something like the T7 online course to brush up on everything related to your scientific and reasoning, your A&P, your chemistry, and your biology is gonna help you out quite a bit.

621
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:35,705
So the correct answer here is a 100 milliliter graduated cylinder.

622
01:16:36,249 --> 01:16:52,282
So a graduated cylinder is actually specifically designed for measuring liquid volumes accurately, and it is an acceptable device to be used for measuring specifically in scientific settings.

623
01:16:52,302 --> 01:17:04,512
100 milliliter graduated cylinder will have clear markings that will allow the student to measure exactly 50 milliliters of water, making it the best choice for precise measurement.

624
01:17:06,018 --> 01:17:09,200
So let's talk about the other things here.

625
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:15,063
We've got a beaker, we've got a volumetric flask, and then we have a Erlenmeyer flask.

626
01:17:15,123 --> 01:17:16,204
So let's start with the beaker.

627
01:17:16,744 --> 01:17:26,249
So a beaker is not considered to be as accurate because they have fewer and less precise markings.

628
01:17:26,769 --> 01:17:29,711
It just wouldn't be the appropriate thing to grab.

629
01:17:31,257 --> 01:17:34,440
So let's talk about the volumetric flasks.

630
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:41,787
Okay, so volumetric flasks are accurate and they are designed to be used in a scientific setting.

631
01:17:42,207 --> 01:17:49,895
However, they're typically used for making solutions rather than measuring out various amounts of a liquid.

632
01:17:52,505 --> 01:17:56,848
And then we've got the 250 milliliter Erlenmeyer flasks.

633
01:17:56,988 --> 01:18:02,973
So Erlenmeyer flasks are actually typically used for mixing or for holding liquids.

634
01:18:02,993 --> 01:18:05,595
They're not used for accurate measurements.

635
01:18:06,096 --> 01:18:12,861
And so they're kind of like beakers in that they just have a few markings, but they're not really designed for precise volume measurement.

636
01:18:13,161 --> 01:18:18,325
So again, the cylinder is the only thing that was listed here as an answer choice.

637
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:33,822
that is widely accepted for accurate and adjustable measurement, and then all of the other options either lacked precision or they were just not intended to be used for measurements in a scientific setting.

638
01:18:35,483 --> 01:18:42,549
So really important to, again, know the different types of microscopes, know the different kinds of scales, know the different type of glassware.

639
01:18:42,689 --> 01:18:45,151
All of that is going to come up on your TEAS exam.

640
01:18:45,171 --> 01:18:46,072
Which of the following

641
01:18:46,873 --> 01:18:49,834
phases is the cell cycle part of?

642
01:18:50,794 --> 01:18:55,316
Interphase, metaphase, prophase, or telephase?

643
01:19:05,419 --> 01:19:07,760
The correct answer is interphase.

644
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:14,162
So interphase is the phase of the cell cycle where the cell spends the majority of its time.

645
01:19:14,262 --> 01:19:16,763
So during the interphase, the cell is growing,

646
01:19:17,392 --> 01:19:23,213
performs all of its normal functions and then it prepares for division by duplicating its DNA.

647
01:19:23,734 --> 01:19:37,697
So interphase has three stages as a reminder that is G1 which is growth, you have the S phase which is where the DNA synthesizes, and then G2 is preparation for division.

648
01:19:38,477 --> 01:19:45,639
And interphase is the phase where really all of the essential cell activities happen before actual division begins.

649
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:53,284
So let's talk about these other phases, what they are and why they're not correct.

650
01:19:53,624 --> 01:19:58,068
So we've got metaphase, which is just one of the stages in mitosis.

651
01:19:58,808 --> 01:20:03,992
This is what is a specific part of cell division, but it's not the entire cell cycle.

652
01:20:04,452 --> 01:20:10,197
In metaphase, chromosomes basically line up in the center of the cell before being separated.

653
01:20:11,918 --> 01:20:12,979
Then we've got prophase.

654
01:20:13,019 --> 01:20:17,042
So prophase is also a stage in mitosis.

655
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:20,601
But again, it's not the entire cell cycle.

656
01:20:21,321 --> 01:20:27,522
What happens in prophase is that the chromosomes condense, and then the nuclear membrane starts to break down.

657
01:20:28,002 --> 01:20:31,383
But this is, again, it's only one part of cell division.

658
01:20:31,523 --> 01:20:33,904
It's not the cell cycle, which is why it's not correct.

659
01:20:34,764 --> 01:20:40,185
And then telophase is another stage inside of mitosis.

660
01:20:41,647 --> 01:20:48,268
During telophase, the cell finishes dividing its chromosomes and begins to form two new nuclei.

661
01:20:48,628 --> 01:20:56,129
But like the other stages, this is just one step in the cell division, and it's not a separate phase of the entire cell cycle.

662
01:21:03,971 --> 01:21:10,832
In which of the following states of matter do the particles of iron have the lowest amount of cohesion?

663
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:15,697
Solid iron particles have the lowest amount of cohesion.

664
01:21:16,517 --> 01:21:20,020
Liquid iron particles have the lowest amount of cohesion.

665
01:21:21,041 --> 01:21:24,764
Gaseous iron particles have the lowest amount of cohesion.

666
01:21:25,525 --> 01:21:29,028
Or the particles have the same amount of cohesion in all states of matter.

667
01:21:30,149 --> 01:21:32,170
So this question is very simple.

668
01:21:34,012 --> 01:21:39,957
It sounds harder because it's basically trying to add a false sense of

669
01:21:40,763 --> 01:21:45,328
Difficulty by having you think that iron might be different than anything else.

670
01:21:45,368 --> 01:21:47,490
So iron is no different from water.

671
01:21:47,751 --> 01:21:50,333
So the correct answer here is actually going to be C.

672
01:21:52,920 --> 01:22:05,988
The correct answer is actually going to be C, the gaseous iron particles have the lowest amount of cohesion, and that's because all gas particles have the lowest amount of cohesion.

673
01:22:06,268 --> 01:22:11,752
That's not specific to iron, that's just specific to gas particles.

674
01:22:20,503 --> 01:22:28,329
A person is diagnosed as having acidosis, a condition in which the blood pH is below 7.45.

675
01:22:30,650 --> 01:22:34,053
Which of the following does the doctor most likely conclude?

676
01:22:34,970 --> 01:22:38,252
There is too much carbon dioxide is found in the blood.

677
01:22:39,053 --> 01:22:41,914
Highly oxygenated blood circulates through the body.

678
01:22:41,934 --> 01:22:51,321
A blockage prevents blood from leaving the pulmonary artery or the nasal cavity is having a difficult time clearing particles from the air.

679
01:22:52,021 --> 01:22:58,185
Okay, and so the correct answer here is A, too much carbon dioxide is found in the blood.

680
01:23:01,985 --> 01:23:13,070
So as the question stated, acidosis refers to a condition where the blood becomes too acidic, which means that the blood pH is below 7.45.

681
01:23:13,351 --> 01:23:24,616
So when CO2 combines with water in the blood to form a carbonic acid, which lowers the pH, which then makes the blood more acidic.

682
01:23:27,089 --> 01:23:35,756
So this condition can happen when the body has trouble expelling CO2 through breathing, leading to what's called respiratory acidosis.

683
01:23:36,283 --> 01:23:40,486
So let's talk about why the other three answer choices are incorrect.

684
01:23:40,526 --> 01:23:41,907
So oxygenated blood.

685
01:23:42,547 --> 01:23:52,554
Again, oxygenated blood refers to blood that is rich in oxygen and acidosis is related to an imbalance in CO2 levels, not oxygen levels.

686
01:23:53,095 --> 01:23:57,558
If the blood is highly oxygenated, it would not cause acidosis.

687
01:24:00,232 --> 01:24:03,175
A blockage prevents blood from leaving the pulmonary artery.

688
01:24:03,315 --> 01:24:14,407
So a blockage in the pulmonary artery is actually called a pulmonary embolism, and that would affect blood flow and oxygen level, but it would not cause acidosis.

689
01:24:17,099 --> 01:24:21,460
And then the nasal cavity has a difficult time clearing particles from the air.

690
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:27,542
So this one is more so related to a respiratory issue, but it wouldn't explain acidosis.

691
01:24:28,102 --> 01:24:31,783
The point where the small and large intestine meet.

692
01:24:32,963 --> 01:24:39,344
The point where the small intestine and large intestine meet is which of the following?

693
01:24:40,765 --> 01:24:45,786
The anus, the appendix, the cecum, or the colon.

694
01:24:52,932 --> 01:24:55,233
The correct answer is the cecum.

695
01:24:55,713 --> 01:25:03,437
So the cecum is the first part of the large intestine, and it is located where the small intestine meets the large intestine.

696
01:25:04,098 --> 01:25:14,803
It's like this pouch-like structure that marks the beginning of the colon, and the small intestine empties its contents into the cecum, which then leads into the rest of the large intestine.

697
01:25:16,396 --> 01:25:18,897
So let's talk about why the other three are incorrect.

698
01:25:18,937 --> 01:25:23,599
So the anus is at the opening at the end of the digestive tract.

699
01:25:23,639 --> 01:25:28,341
I'm going to put a picture here so we can take a look at the entirety of the digestive tract together.

700
01:25:28,801 --> 01:25:31,382
And this is where waste is eliminated from the body.

701
01:25:32,883 --> 01:25:40,766
The appendix is a small tube-like structure that is attached to the cecum, but it is not where the small and large intestine meet.

702
01:25:43,197 --> 01:25:56,175
The colon is the main part of the large intestine but it's further along after the cecum and the colon is divided into several parts including the ascending, the transverse, and the descending.

703
01:25:56,777 --> 01:26:09,119
Also, it's really important as I say those words, this reminds me to remind you that it's important to really have a good understanding of anatomical position and the different planes in the body.

704
01:26:09,179 --> 01:26:18,021
So language like ascending, transverse, descending, lateral, all of those words are really important for you to know as you prepare to take this exam.

705
01:26:20,141 --> 01:26:25,722
So like I was saying, the colon is divided into several parts and the small intestine meets the large intestine

706
01:26:27,118 --> 01:26:28,959
Not at the colon, it's at the cecum.

707
01:26:35,742 --> 01:26:45,046
Which of the following processes involves the addition of water molecules to break down covalent bonds within macromolecules?

708
01:26:46,147 --> 01:26:54,531
The dehydration synthesis, the condensation synthesis, the hydrolysis, or the photosynthesis.

709
01:26:55,705 --> 01:27:02,486
So this is such a great question because I feel like it sounds like a really hard question.

710
01:27:02,866 --> 01:27:07,567
And I feel like it's because it sort of overlaps a lot of different concepts.

711
01:27:07,587 --> 01:27:13,828
So we're talking about macromolecules, we're talking about water molecules, and then we're talking about covalent bonds.

712
01:27:13,888 --> 01:27:18,989
So this just feels like a question loaded with some chemistry and some biology.

713
01:27:20,349 --> 01:27:24,670
So the correct answer here is actually going to be hydrolysis.

714
01:27:31,017 --> 01:27:44,980
And so hydrolysis is the process where water molecules are added to break down covalent bonds within macromolecules, like proteins, fats, carbohydrates, et cetera.

715
01:27:45,681 --> 01:27:51,722
During hydrolysis, the addition of water splits the large molecule into smaller molecules.

716
01:27:51,782 --> 01:28:00,124
So for example, in digestion, enzymes break down food by adding water to split macromolecules, like breaking down

717
01:28:00,828 --> 01:28:04,770
scarch, like breaking down starch into glucose.

718
01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:08,571
So let's talk about these other three answer choices.

719
01:28:09,392 --> 01:28:22,077
Dehydration synthesis, which is also another word for condensation synthesis, which is of course one of our answer choices here, so both of them are the same, is the opposite of hydrolysis.

720
01:28:23,244 --> 01:28:34,591
In dehydration synthesis, also known as condensation synthesis, two smaller molecules combine to form a larger molecule, and then water is then removed, not added.

721
01:28:35,091 --> 01:28:40,495
So this happens, for example, when two anemo acids bond to form a protein, water is released.

722
01:28:41,315 --> 01:28:43,336
And lastly, photosynthesis.

723
01:28:43,896 --> 01:28:46,056
Photosynthesis really has nothing to do with it.

724
01:28:47,116 --> 01:28:55,758
Photosynthesis, of course, is the process by which plants use light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.

725
01:28:56,359 --> 01:28:58,899
So hydrolysis is the correct answer.

726
01:29:04,941 --> 01:29:10,562
Which of the following liquids typically forms a convex meniscus when placed in a container?

727
01:29:11,514 --> 01:29:16,378
water, mercury, salt water, or alcohol?

728
01:29:21,341 --> 01:29:23,583
The correct answer here is mercury.

729
01:29:29,018 --> 01:29:47,812
So mercury forms a convex meniscus when placed in a container because it has really strong cohesive forces, which basically an attraction between mercury molecules, and it has weak adhesive forces, attraction between mercury and then the container surface.

730
01:29:48,357 --> 01:29:56,681
This causes the mercury to basically stick to itself more than to the sides of the container, which is where that curve happens up.

731
01:29:56,701 --> 01:30:00,003
That's called the convex at all of the edges.

732
01:30:01,704 --> 01:30:07,326
So again, this is something that you're going to see when you study scientific reasoning.

733
01:30:07,727 --> 01:30:12,689
You're going to learn the difference between a convex and a concave meniscus.

734
01:30:13,009 --> 01:30:14,590
It may appear on your test.

735
01:30:16,628 --> 01:30:22,871
Water, saltwater, and alcohol all act like one another when they're placed in a container.

736
01:30:22,891 --> 01:30:30,935
They form what's called a concave meniscus, and that basically means that it curves down at the edges.

737
01:30:32,315 --> 01:30:42,360
What that means is that their adhesive forces with the container surface are stronger than their actual cohesive forces with themselves, with their molecules.

738
01:30:43,909 --> 01:30:56,056
Before we answer the next set of practice questions, I want to give you a reminder that if you've got your T7 exam coming up in just a few weeks or in just a few months, that it's never too late to start studying with an online course.

739
01:30:56,456 --> 01:31:01,038
The online course is intended for you to ditch the boring study guides and to study

740
01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:08,141
using a very simple and easy to understand structured system that's guaranteed to help you pass.

741
01:31:08,762 --> 01:31:17,685
This online course will give you everything that you need to know and to relearn so that you can feel confident not only on test day, but as you get ready to go into your program.

742
01:31:18,926 --> 01:31:21,667
So if you're ready to simplify studying for your T7 exam,

743
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:28,994
and you don't wanna spend a bunch of money on test prep, know that the T7 online course has your back.

744
01:31:29,374 --> 01:31:33,096

745
01:31:34,336 --> 01:31:39,379
Which of the following best describes the primary reproductive mechanism of bacterial cells?

746
01:31:40,419 --> 01:31:45,522
Binary fission, sexual reproduction, budding, or sperm formation.

747
01:31:45,982 --> 01:31:52,525
This is a great example of why it's important to not just focus on just memorizing definitions

748
01:31:53,390 --> 01:31:58,273
and really having a good understanding of the content that you are studying.

749
01:31:58,493 --> 01:32:12,242
This question is not only asking you about cellular reproduction, it's also asking you to pull in your knowledge of what you know about microorganisms, in this case, specifically bacteria.

750
01:32:13,808 --> 01:32:25,493
So being able to know a little bit about how bacteria works, knowing how to pull in information on how cellular reproduction work will allow you to answer this question correctly.

751
01:32:26,693 --> 01:32:31,355
So for this question, the correct answer is actually A, binary fission.

752
01:32:36,485 --> 01:32:39,967
So binary fission is the main way that bacteria reproduce.

753
01:32:40,408 --> 01:32:49,274
What happens in binary fission is a bacterial cell copies its DNA, and then it splits in half, creating two identical cells.

754
01:32:49,734 --> 01:32:56,519
This process is a type of asexual reproduction, meaning it does not involve combining DNA from two parents.

755
01:32:56,999 --> 01:33:00,862
It is quick, and it allows for bacteria to multiply rapidly.

756
01:33:01,927 --> 01:33:12,290
though sexual reproduction is not correct because it involves the combination of genetic material from two parents to create an offspring with a mix of both parents' DNA.

757
01:33:13,951 --> 01:33:18,812
Budding is a type of asexual reproduction seen in organisms like yeast.

758
01:33:19,372 --> 01:33:24,594
In budding, a new organism grows off the side of the parent and eventually separates.

759
01:33:26,155 --> 01:33:27,335
In spore formation,

760
01:33:27,819 --> 01:33:38,217
So spore formation is a survival mechanism some bacteria use in harsh conditions to protect themselves, but it's not a primary method of reproduction.

761
01:33:43,428 --> 01:33:56,396
So when it comes to studying microorganisms, you're gonna wanna make sure that you have a very good understanding of things like bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi, how do they move?

762
01:33:56,456 --> 01:33:57,737
What are their characteristics?

763
01:33:57,777 --> 01:33:59,058
What are some examples of them?

764
01:33:59,198 --> 01:34:02,340
How do they reproduce and things like that?

765
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:04,241
What kind of diseases do they cause?

766
01:34:04,602 --> 01:34:08,064
Which of the following is an example of polygenic trait?

767
01:34:09,024 --> 01:34:10,005
ABO blood type,

768
01:34:11,447 --> 01:34:19,232
flower color in snapdragons, skin color in humans, or eye color in fruit flags?

769
01:34:27,918 --> 01:34:31,060
So the correct answer is skin color in humans.

770
01:34:31,661 --> 01:34:41,167
So polygenic trait, this basically means it is a trait that is influenced by multiple genes working together and skin color

771
01:34:42,817 --> 01:34:43,958
a polygenic trait.

772
01:34:44,358 --> 01:34:52,284
This combination of genes results in a range of possible skin colors rather than a simple one gene one trait outcome.

773
01:34:52,785 --> 01:34:59,850
Because many genes contribute, polygenic traits like skin color show a wide variety of appearances.

774
01:35:01,411 --> 01:35:04,473
So let's talk about the other three answer choices.

775
01:35:05,134 --> 01:35:05,534
We have

776
01:35:06,722 --> 01:35:08,424
ABO blood type.

777
01:35:08,744 --> 01:35:14,209
The ABO blood type system is controlled by a single gene with multiple alleles.

778
01:35:14,509 --> 01:35:20,174
This is an example of multiple alleles like we discussed earlier in this practice question.

779
01:35:21,255 --> 01:35:28,521
Flower color and snapdragons are determined by a single gene that shows incomplete dominance.

780
01:35:29,061 --> 01:35:34,286
In this case, crossing a red flower plant with a white flower plant would produce pink flowers.

781
01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:38,575
This is an example of incomplete dominance, not polygenic trait.

782
01:35:40,357 --> 01:35:47,586
Eye color in fruit flies is also controlled by a single gene with a simple inheritance pattern, not multiple genes.

783
01:35:47,666 --> 01:35:49,849
The cerebellum helps blank.

784
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:09,066
The correct answer is B, coordinate body movements.

785
01:36:12,468 --> 01:36:17,591
So the cerebellum is the part of the brain responsible for coordinating voluntary movements.

786
01:36:18,312 --> 01:36:21,754
That's things like balance, posture, and fine motor skills.

787
01:36:22,354 --> 01:36:25,236
It helps make movements smooth and accurate.

788
01:36:25,256 --> 01:36:32,280
So for example, the cerebellum allows us to walk straight or allows us to reach for objects without losing balance.

789
01:36:34,092 --> 01:36:47,740
Body pressure regulation is managed by other systems, specifically the autonomic nervous system and parts of the brains, like the medulla, which help control heart rate and blood pressure.

790
01:36:49,521 --> 01:36:58,526
Breathing mechanics are controlled by the brainstem, specifically, again, the medulla and the pons, which regulate respiratory rate and depth.

791
01:37:00,730 --> 01:37:13,002
Language processing and the interpretation of sounds occurs in areas of the brain that are located in the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum is not involved with language interpretation.

792
01:37:15,624 --> 01:37:19,068
Making coordinating body movements the correct answer.

793
01:37:23,110 --> 01:37:27,854
All right, and then our last question is going to be an A and P question.

794
01:37:27,874 --> 01:37:33,738
The B cells do not directly attack pathogens or infected cells.

795
01:37:33,979 --> 01:37:41,164
Instead, they mark the pathogens for destruction by macrophages and B cells.

796
01:37:41,624 --> 01:37:45,968
They mark the antibodies for destruction by B cells and natural killer cells.

797
01:37:46,608 --> 01:37:51,112
They mark the antibodies for destruction by macrophages and killer T cells.

798
01:37:51,468 --> 01:37:57,029
They mark the pathogens for destruction by macrophages and natural killer cells.

799
01:37:59,010 --> 01:38:06,292
Okay, and the correct answer is D, mark the pathogens for destruction by macrophages and natural killers.

800
01:38:06,532 --> 01:38:14,054
So B cells produce antibodies, which are proteins that bind to specific pathogens like bacterias or viruses.

801
01:38:14,614 --> 01:38:19,755
And by attaching to these pathogens, the antibodies mark them so that other immune cells

802
01:38:20,108 --> 01:38:29,927
macrophages, which basically eat invaders, and natural killer cells, which help destroy infected or harmful cells, can recognize and destroy them.

803
01:38:30,503 --> 01:38:38,931
The B cells don't directly attack, but they rather like tag or identify the pathogen so that the other cells can eliminate it.

804
01:38:39,472 --> 01:38:43,076
So just a few reasons why the other answer choices are not correct.

805
01:38:43,196 --> 01:38:46,639
So B cells, they do not destroy pathogens directly.

806
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:49,842
Instead, they just produce antibodies.

807
01:38:50,043 --> 01:38:54,287
Macrophages are the ones that handle the actual destruction of the pathogens.

808
01:38:56,587 --> 01:39:02,282
Antibodies are the markers that B cells produce and are not themselves marked for destruction.

809
01:39:02,402 --> 01:39:07,836
Instead, antibodies attach to pathogens, marking the pathogens for destruction.

810
01:39:07,856 --> 01:39:12,126
Okay, and that wraps up our last question.

811
01:39:12,187 --> 01:39:17,019
So if you've stuck in with me throughout this entire video, this entire test, amazing job.
