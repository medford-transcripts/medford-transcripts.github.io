1
00:00:00,428 --> 00:00:11,595
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're taking your T7 soon, whether it's in just a few weeks or in a few months and you're a little bit scared or maybe a lot scared of the science section, this video is for you.

2
00:00:12,035 --> 00:00:18,360
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video, we're gonna be going over the most realistic and aligned free T7 practice test.

3
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:26,505
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna be answering questions on chemistry, A&P, scientific reasoning, and biology.

4
00:00:26,805 --> 00:00:29,907
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the most legit free test that you're going to find.

5
00:00:30,328 --> 00:00:33,671
[SPEAKER_00]: We also offer a reading, math, and English test.

6
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:38,095
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sign up to take those tests using the link in the description below.

7
00:00:39,096 --> 00:00:42,399
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you grab a pen and a piece of paper.

8
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:49,453
[SPEAKER_00]: because not only am I going to be explaining to you why the correct answers are correct, I'm going to be explaining to you why they're incorrect.

9
00:00:49,593 --> 00:00:58,837
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we dive on in, I do want to remind you that if you're taking your TEAS exam, taking a practice test is the best thing for you to do, especially in the very beginning.

10
00:00:59,237 --> 00:01:01,738
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one mistake that we see students make

11
00:01:02,398 --> 00:01:18,407
[SPEAKER_00]: people find out that they have to take this test and they just start studying random stuff and they have no idea what's actually on the test, how in-depth or not in-depth the test is, and people get really stressed out and they get really overwhelmed or they just straight-up study the wrong thing.

12
00:01:18,847 --> 00:01:20,488
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking a practice test is

13
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:37,358
[SPEAKER_00]: and figuring out what is actually on the test, what is not on the test, what do I know, what do I not know, that allows you to be able to gauge how ready you are for each section of the exam, and it'll allow you to also gauge what it is you need to study.

14
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:39,439
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for being here.

15
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:43,119
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing the right thing by taking a TEAS practice test.

16
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,720
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further ado, let's get on into it.

17
00:01:49,093 --> 00:02:04,516
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's dive right on into our first question, which looks like it's going to be on A and P. A patient presents with excessive bruising, excessive bleeding, and slow wound healing.

18
00:02:05,076 --> 00:02:08,616
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following does the patient's blood test reveal?

19
00:02:10,117 --> 00:02:18,198
[SPEAKER_00]: A low platelet count, high antibody count, high red blood cell count, or low white blood cell count?

20
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:27,076
[SPEAKER_00]: the right answer is going to be A, low platelet count.

21
00:02:29,117 --> 00:02:32,599
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about why the correct answer is low platelet count.

22
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:41,384
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you probably remember, platelets are tiny cell fragments in the blood that help form clots to stop bleeding.

23
00:02:42,365 --> 00:02:44,726
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this question,

24
00:02:45,294 --> 00:03:00,045
[SPEAKER_00]: when someone is experiencing excessive bruising, excessive bleeding, and slow wound healing, that's because their blood is not clotting as well as it should be, which would indicate low platelet count.

25
00:03:00,065 --> 00:03:06,450
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great question to get the test started with because you will definitely see questions like this.

26
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:12,495
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not always a matter of knowing your vocabulary words and memorizing

27
00:03:13,013 --> 00:03:16,917
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great example of why it's important to understand context.

28
00:03:18,218 --> 00:03:19,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to our next question.

29
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,165
[SPEAKER_00]: Blood oxygen levels are most likely low when blood does which of the following?

30
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:34,235
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves the aorta, fills the right atrium, reaches the body's tissues, or flows through the arteries?

31
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:44,328
[SPEAKER_00]: The right answer here is fills the right atrium.

32
00:03:44,468 --> 00:03:54,430
[SPEAKER_00]: So the right atrium is one of the four chambers of the heart and it's where blood returns from the body after it has delivered oxygen to the tissues.

33
00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:01,492
[SPEAKER_00]: So the blood is now lower in oxygen because it has already been used by the body cells.

34
00:04:02,072 --> 00:04:10,174
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the blood fills up the right atrium, it's carrying less oxygen and is on its way to the lungs to pick up more.

35
00:04:10,962 --> 00:04:16,646
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about why the other answers are incorrect, leaving the aorta.

36
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:25,573
[SPEAKER_00]: So the aorta is the largest artery in the body, and it carries oxygen-rich blood directly from the heart to the rest of the body.

37
00:04:25,994 --> 00:04:34,020
[SPEAKER_00]: And blood in the aorta has just come from the lungs where it was just reoxygenated, so now it is high and oxygen not low.

38
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:37,178
[SPEAKER_00]: reaches the body's tissue.

39
00:04:37,258 --> 00:04:43,121
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is incorrect because when blood reaches the body tissues, it is delivering oxygen to them.

40
00:04:43,561 --> 00:04:47,443
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that it is still high in oxygen when it arrives at the tissues.

41
00:04:47,903 --> 00:04:54,387
[SPEAKER_00]: It only becomes low in oxygen after it has delivered the oxygen and is on its way back to the heart.

42
00:04:55,887 --> 00:04:58,088
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, flows through the arteries.

43
00:04:58,108 --> 00:05:03,930
[SPEAKER_00]: So arteries generally carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the different parts of the body.

44
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:13,373
[SPEAKER_00]: The only exception to this is the pulmonary arteries, which carry oxygen-poor blood from the heart to the lungs.

45
00:05:13,453 --> 00:05:19,475
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in general, blood flowing through the arteries is usually high in oxygen.

46
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:29,327
[SPEAKER_00]: An intracellular chemical signal can be produced in the cell membrane.

47
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:33,669
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it is produced, it goes to which of the following?

48
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,230
[SPEAKER_00]: A, to a different cell.

49
00:05:37,051 --> 00:05:39,652
[SPEAKER_00]: B, to another part of the same cell.

50
00:05:40,752 --> 00:05:43,814
[SPEAKER_00]: C, to a region right outside of the cell.

51
00:05:44,254 --> 00:05:48,516
[SPEAKER_00]: Or D, to an area with high ion concentration.

52
00:05:58,243 --> 00:06:02,165
[SPEAKER_00]: The correct answer to this is B, to another part of the same cell.

53
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:08,927
[SPEAKER_00]: So an intracellular chemical signal is a signal which is produced inside of a cell.

54
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:10,728
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the intra part means.

55
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:15,550
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does is it communicates information within that same cell.

56
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:26,875
[SPEAKER_00]: So when this signal is created, usually that happens inside of the cell membrane, it travels to another part within the same cell to carry out specific functions.

57
00:06:27,352 --> 00:06:31,355
[SPEAKER_00]: An example of a function might be something like activating enzymes.

58
00:06:32,456 --> 00:06:44,186
[SPEAKER_00]: All in all, intracellular signals are designed to act within the same cell where they are produced and traveling to different areas of that cell to carry out their task.

59
00:06:44,826 --> 00:06:55,675
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these other answer options here are talking about intercellular signals, which would mean that the signal would have to leave the cell or go to unrelated areas.

60
00:07:01,382 --> 00:07:05,284
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following enzymes breaks down proteins?

61
00:07:07,785 --> 00:07:15,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it A, amylase, B, lactase, C, pepsin, or D, suocrase?

62
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:27,256
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great question because on the TEAS exam, you're going to have questions that come up on

63
00:07:28,004 --> 00:07:31,005
[SPEAKER_00]: macromolecules kind of in two different ways.

64
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:39,429
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to see questions like this where it's really related to A and P, specifically the gastrointestinal system.

65
00:07:39,989 --> 00:07:44,471
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're also going to see questions about macromolecules

66
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:53,603
[SPEAKER_00]: asked of you in more of the sense of a biology question.

67
00:07:53,763 --> 00:08:10,188
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important that you really understand your macromolecules, also known as your biomolecules, really well through and through, because there's a good chance that you're gonna be asked an A and P as well as a biology question about them.

68
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:15,910
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, the correct answer is C, pepsin.

69
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:29,320
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason that pepsin is the correct answer is because pepsin is an enzyme that is specifically helps break down proteins into smaller pieces, making it easier for the body to digest them.

70
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:36,043
[SPEAKER_00]: Pepsin is produced in the stomach where it works best in the acidic environment to start protein digestion.

71
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:38,824
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about why the other three are incorrect.

72
00:08:38,904 --> 00:08:46,587
[SPEAKER_00]: So amylase is the enzyme that breaks down starches, meaning complex carbohydrates into simple sugars,

73
00:08:47,337 --> 00:08:49,819
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically doesn't have anything to do with proteins at all.

74
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Lactase.

75
00:08:52,321 --> 00:08:59,206
[SPEAKER_00]: Lactase is an enzyme that breaks down lactose, that's the sugar found in milk, into simpler sugars.

76
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:04,010
[SPEAKER_00]: So lactase works on lactose, not proteins, that's why it's incorrect.

77
00:09:04,931 --> 00:09:14,839
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, sucrose is an enzyme that breaks down sucrose, which is basically table sugar, into simpler sugars, which are

78
00:09:15,613 --> 00:09:17,274
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, like glucose.

79
00:09:17,595 --> 00:09:23,439
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, petsin is the right answer because it's the only enzyme, at least on this list, that breaks down proteins.

80
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:31,544
[SPEAKER_00]: The diffusion of nutrients through the walls of the digestive system is critical to homeostasis in the body.

81
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:38,529
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority of this diffusion takes place in which of the following areas of the digestive system?

82
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:44,313
[SPEAKER_00]: The large intestine, the colon, the liver,

83
00:09:45,158 --> 00:09:46,598
[SPEAKER_00]: or the small intestine?

84
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:57,022
[SPEAKER_00]: The correct answer here is the small intestine.

85
00:10:00,443 --> 00:10:07,205
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the small intestine is where the majority of nutrient absorption takes place in the digestive system.

86
00:10:08,195 --> 00:10:22,761
[SPEAKER_00]: The walls inside of the small intestine are lined with tiny structures called villi and microvilli, and that increases the surface area, making it highly efficient at absorbing nutrients and passing them into the bloodstream.

87
00:10:23,402 --> 00:10:29,684
[SPEAKER_00]: This is obviously essential for homeostasis as the body needs these nutrients to function properly.

88
00:10:30,585 --> 00:10:32,946
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's talk about why the other options are incorrect.

89
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:35,371
[SPEAKER_00]: large intestine.

90
00:10:35,952 --> 00:10:44,615
[SPEAKER_00]: The large intestine mainly absorbs water and some minerals, but it does not play a major role in absorbing nutrients from food.

91
00:10:44,715 --> 00:10:49,677
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time food reaches the large intestine, most of the nutrients have already been absorbed.

92
00:10:51,037 --> 00:10:57,039
[SPEAKER_00]: The colon is part of the large intestine and has a similar role in absorbing water and minerals.

93
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:03,502
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps to form solid waste, but it's not involved in the significant absorption of nutrients.

94
00:11:04,342 --> 00:11:08,583
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, the liver does not absorb any nutrients from the digestive system.

95
00:11:08,803 --> 00:11:17,844
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, it processes and it stores nutrients after they have been absorbed by the small intestine.

96
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:32,027
[SPEAKER_00]: So the small intestine is the primary site for nutrient absorption in the body, while the large intestine, colon, and liver have very different functions in the digestive system and they do not absorb nutrients.

97
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:49,024
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as this invader enters the body, the body initiates immunological responses.

98
00:11:49,364 --> 00:11:52,046
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following is the name of this invader?

99
00:11:52,066 --> 00:12:01,911
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it A, foreign particles, B, pathogen, C, toxin, or D, vaccine?

100
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:09,175
[SPEAKER_00]: The correct answer is B, pathogen.

101
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:18,071
[SPEAKER_00]: So a pathogen is a harmful microorganism.

102
00:12:18,131 --> 00:12:26,354
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be anything such as a virus, a bacteria, or a fungus, and a pathogen can cause disease.

103
00:12:26,394 --> 00:12:34,137
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a pathogen enters the body, it triggers an immune response because the body is recognizing it as a threat.

104
00:12:34,953 --> 00:12:38,675
[SPEAKER_00]: On the TEAS exam, you're going to want to make sure that you study microorganisms.

105
00:12:38,715 --> 00:12:59,567
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to make sure that you understand different types of transmissions of diseases, immunity responses, as well as you're going to want to have a really good understanding of the different types of microorganisms, the harmful kinds like a pathogen, and also the beneficial kind.

106
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,644
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following muscles do circulating hormones stimulate?

107
00:13:09,565 --> 00:13:14,349
[SPEAKER_00]: Extension, flexor, skeletal, or smooth?

108
00:13:18,712 --> 00:13:23,797
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the answer for this question is D, smooth muscles.

109
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so smooth muscles

110
00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:37,381
[SPEAKER_00]: are found in places like the walls of the blood vessels, the digestive tract, as well as the bladder.

111
00:13:37,741 --> 00:13:50,065
[SPEAKER_00]: And they respond to circulating hormones in the body, which can cause them to contract or relax to help control processes like blood flow, digestion, as well as waste elimination.

112
00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:57,487
[SPEAKER_00]: These muscles work automatically, meaning involuntarily, and are directly affected by hormones.

113
00:13:59,377 --> 00:14:02,719
[SPEAKER_00]: The other three answer choices are incorrect, so let's talk about why.

114
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:07,061
[SPEAKER_00]: So extension is a type of movement, it's not a type of muscle.

115
00:14:08,562 --> 00:14:14,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Flexors are a type of muscle that causes bending at the joints, like when you bend your elbow.

116
00:14:14,785 --> 00:14:20,308
[SPEAKER_00]: Flexor muscles are usually skeletal muscles that are controlled by the nervous system, not by hormones.

117
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:28,252
[SPEAKER_00]: And then skeletal muscles are the muscles attached to the bones that control voluntary movements like walking or

118
00:14:28,705 --> 00:14:30,326
[SPEAKER_00]: picking up a piece of apple pie.

119
00:14:30,987 --> 00:14:35,210
[SPEAKER_00]: These muscles are controlled by nerve signals rather than by hormones.

120
00:14:40,194 --> 00:14:47,300
[SPEAKER_00]: If this practice test is making you feel like you definitely have some studying to do in the science section, just know that you are not alone.

121
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,423
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is exactly why the T7 online course exists.

122
00:14:51,810 --> 00:15:03,558
[SPEAKER_00]: The T7 online course helps you relearn and freshen up your knowledge about everything that we've seen so far on the science topics, that's A&P, chemistry, scientific reasoning, and biology.

123
00:15:04,038 --> 00:15:10,422
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, the T7 online course goes over everything you need to know for reading, English, and math.

124
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,104
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have way more than just practice questions.

125
00:15:13,124 --> 00:15:20,049
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also going to find flashcards, educational video lessons, and interactive study modules.

126
00:15:21,564 --> 00:15:27,469
[SPEAKER_00]: and get everything you need to pass your TEAS exam with Smart Addition Academy's T7 online course.

127
00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:31,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out at www.smartadditionacademy.com.

128
00:15:33,254 --> 00:15:37,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this is our first question on scientific reasoning.

129
00:15:37,878 --> 00:15:43,322
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to have eight scored scientific reasoning questions.

130
00:15:43,823 --> 00:15:50,108
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take your real TEAS exam, scientific reasoning is anything like designing an experiment,

131
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:58,591
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific method, inductive, deductive, reasoning, as well as things like conversions and scientific measurements.

132
00:15:58,712 --> 00:16:07,314
[SPEAKER_00]: So which of the following actions contribute to minimizing bias when selecting a sample for an experiment?

133
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:19,458
[SPEAKER_00]: Selecting participants based on personal beliefs, using convenience sampling methods, ensuring that the sample represents the population of interest,

134
00:16:20,843 --> 00:16:24,606
[SPEAKER_00]: choosing participants from a single geographic location.

135
00:16:24,626 --> 00:16:41,278
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so the correct answer for this is going to be C, ensuring that the sample represents the population of interest.

136
00:16:42,712 --> 00:16:46,294
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this question, it's asking you about eliminating bias.

137
00:16:46,354 --> 00:16:55,180
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're conducting an experiment, it's important that you have a sample that accurately represents the larger population in which you are studying.

138
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:06,847
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps ensure that the findings are reliable and they can be applied to the whole population, not just a specific group like question D talking about a specific geographic area.

139
00:17:07,507 --> 00:17:14,733
[SPEAKER_00]: By selecting a representative sample, you minimize bias, meaning your results are going to be more fair and accurate.

140
00:17:19,697 --> 00:17:28,624
[SPEAKER_00]: If a person smells something sweet, which of the following forms of information is this initially perceived as in the nervous system?

141
00:17:29,825 --> 00:17:35,210
[SPEAKER_00]: Cognitive, integrative, motor, or sensory?

142
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:43,177
[SPEAKER_00]: The correct answer is sensory.

143
00:17:48,421 --> 00:17:54,806
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a person smells something sweet, the information is first picked up by the sensory receptors in the nose.

144
00:17:55,386 --> 00:17:58,909
[SPEAKER_00]: And these receptors send signals to the brain about the smell.

145
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:01,874
[SPEAKER_00]: which is an example of sensory information.

146
00:18:02,734 --> 00:18:11,316
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensory information can be defined as data gathered from the senses like smell, taste, touch, hearing, and sight.

147
00:18:12,497 --> 00:18:15,017
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's why the other answers are not correct.

148
00:18:15,097 --> 00:18:20,159
[SPEAKER_00]: So a cognitive process includes things like thinking, reasoning, and understanding.

149
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:26,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Recognizing and thinking about a smell might come later, but the initial detection of the sweet smell is sensory.

150
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:27,681
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not cognitive.

151
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:36,263
[SPEAKER_00]: Your integrative processes, they happen when the brain combines sensory information with other information to make sense of it.

152
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:46,709
[SPEAKER_00]: But since we're talking about the initial perception of the sweet smell is purely sensory, the integrative aspect of it would happen after the sensory data is received.

153
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:53,313
[SPEAKER_00]: And motor information involves movement, like moving your muscles to walk or grab something sweet.

154
00:18:53,774 --> 00:18:58,817
[SPEAKER_00]: Smelling something is not related to movement, so it does not involve motor information.

155
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:08,240
[SPEAKER_00]: While hiking, a person is startled after encountering a bear.

156
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:12,064
[SPEAKER_00]: Her palms get sweaty and her heart starts racing.

157
00:19:12,324 --> 00:19:17,109
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following parts of her nervous system was directly stimulated?

158
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:24,657
[SPEAKER_00]: Central, parasympathetic, somatic, or sympathetic?

159
00:19:33,957 --> 00:19:36,138
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is D, sympathetic.

160
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:50,864
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sympathetic nervous system is part of the anatomic nervous system and it is responsible for that fight or flight response that we are all so familiar with.

161
00:19:51,365 --> 00:20:03,090
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a person is encountering something scary or stressful like a bear on a hike, the sympathetic nervous system would be activated causing physical changes such as sweaty palms and a racing heart.

162
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,963
[SPEAKER_00]: These reactions are basically preparing the body to either fight the bear or flee from the danger of the bear.

163
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:18,967
[SPEAKER_00]: So central nervous system would be incorrect because the CNS consists of the brain and the spinal cord.

164
00:20:19,387 --> 00:20:33,794
[SPEAKER_00]: And while the CNS processes the information and sends the signals, the physical reactions like the sweaty palms and the racing heart are controlled by the anatomic nervous system, not in the CNS directly.

165
00:20:35,352 --> 00:20:46,185
[SPEAKER_00]: The parasympathetic nervous system is the rest and digest system, which just helps the body relax and return to a normal state after a stressful event.

166
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:50,770
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, it would slow down the heart rate and calm the body down.

167
00:20:52,564 --> 00:21:08,383
[SPEAKER_00]: The somnomic nervous system controls involuntary movements like moving muscles to walk or pick up something, but it doesn't control the anatomic or automatic reactions like sweating and heart rate changes in response to stress.

168
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:27,496
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following types of tissues include cells of the immune system and of the blood?

169
00:21:28,517 --> 00:21:34,479
[SPEAKER_00]: Connective, epithelial, muscles, or neural?

170
00:21:39,862 --> 00:21:42,263
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is A, connective.

171
00:21:43,682 --> 00:21:56,208
[SPEAKER_00]: Connective tissue is a broad category of tissue that includes several types of cells including cells of the immune system like white blood cells and cells of the blood like red and white blood cells.

172
00:21:57,329 --> 00:22:05,293
[SPEAKER_00]: So blood is considered a type of connective tissue because it connects and it transports essential substances throughout the body.

173
00:22:06,537 --> 00:22:09,740
[SPEAKER_00]: So epithelial tissue covers the surfaces of the body.

174
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,803
[SPEAKER_00]: This is things like the lining of the organs or the skin.

175
00:22:13,283 --> 00:22:17,807
[SPEAKER_00]: It acts as a protective barrier, but does not contain immune or blood cells.

176
00:22:18,828 --> 00:22:22,992
[SPEAKER_00]: Muscle tissue is responsible for movement, and it is made up of muscle cells.

177
00:22:24,032 --> 00:22:28,777
[SPEAKER_00]: And neural tissues make up the brain, the spinal cord, and of course, the nerves.

178
00:22:29,297 --> 00:22:34,098
[SPEAKER_00]: It's involved in transmitting nerve signals, but it does not include blood or immune cells.

179
00:22:34,418 --> 00:22:37,459
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why connective tissue is the correct answer.

180
00:22:37,979 --> 00:22:41,800
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following correctly describes homeostasis?

181
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:57,803
[SPEAKER_00]: A functional system of the body, blood flow to every cell in the body, a relatively constant environment within the body, or neural pathways that have integrated into the body.

182
00:23:05,944 --> 00:23:10,707
[SPEAKER_00]: The correct answer is C, a relatively constant environment within the body.

183
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:21,675
[SPEAKER_00]: So homeostasis refers to the body's ability to maintain a stable internal environment despite changes in the external environment.

184
00:23:21,715 --> 00:23:29,461
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can include things like keeping the body temperature regulated, blood pressure, and pH levels within a narrow and optimal

185
00:23:30,054 --> 00:23:31,815
[SPEAKER_00]: range for proper functioning.

186
00:23:32,395 --> 00:23:38,437
[SPEAKER_00]: The body uses feedback mechanisms to regulate these processes and ensures that everything stays in balance.

187
00:23:39,597 --> 00:23:53,722
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take your TEAS exam, not only should you expect to answer questions for each of the systems within the A and P questions, you'll definitely be presented on questions on homeostasis.

188
00:23:53,762 --> 00:23:57,463
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure that you have a really good understanding of homeostasis.

189
00:23:58,057 --> 00:24:04,419
[SPEAKER_00]: So fertilization, which is the fusing of one sperm and an ovum, results in which of the following?

190
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:11,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Embryo, fetus, an infant, or a zygote?

191
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:16,381
[SPEAKER_00]: The correct answer here is a zygote.

192
00:24:21,223 --> 00:24:27,324
[SPEAKER_00]: So fertilization occurs when a sperm cell from the male fuses with an ovum,

193
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:30,216
[SPEAKER_00]: also known as an egg from a female.

194
00:24:30,716 --> 00:24:34,178
[SPEAKER_00]: This union forms a single cell called a zygote.

195
00:24:34,678 --> 00:24:40,761
[SPEAKER_00]: The zygote contains all of the genetic material needed to develop into a new organism.

196
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:45,643
[SPEAKER_00]: It is basically the very first stage after fertilization.

197
00:24:46,863 --> 00:24:53,686
[SPEAKER_00]: So an embryo, a fetus, and an infant will all happen after that, after the zygote is formed.

198
00:24:53,746 --> 00:24:57,288
[SPEAKER_00]: They're basically just later stages of development.

199
00:24:57,825 --> 00:25:02,589
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following are included in the male reproductive system?

200
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:17,603
[SPEAKER_00]: The penis and the epididymis, the vas deferens and uterus, the penis and the fallopian tubes, the penis, scrotum, and cervix.

201
00:25:20,722 --> 00:25:24,284
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is A, the penis and the epididymis.

202
00:25:24,725 --> 00:25:38,614
[SPEAKER_00]: So the penis and the epididymis are both inside of the male reproductive system, which are the organs responsible for producing and delivering sperm for reproduction purposes.

203
00:25:39,134 --> 00:25:46,800
[SPEAKER_00]: The penis is the external organ used for sexual intercourse and the delivery of sperm, while the epididymis is a coiled tube

204
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:51,870
[SPEAKER_00]: located behind the testes where sperm mature and are stored.

205
00:25:53,992 --> 00:26:00,837
[SPEAKER_00]: Technically, the scrotum and the vas deferens are also part of the reproductive system.

206
00:26:00,978 --> 00:26:05,641
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the uterus and the cervix are part of the female reproductive system.

207
00:26:06,142 --> 00:26:08,584
[SPEAKER_00]: So those answers are incorrect.

208
00:26:09,044 --> 00:26:16,570
[SPEAKER_00]: Which phenomenon begins with red blood cells releasing oxygen to the other cells in the body?

209
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:29,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it air conduction, cellular respiration, internal respiration, or pulmonary ventilation?

210
00:26:41,293 --> 00:26:45,395
[SPEAKER_00]: So the correct answer here is C, internal respiration.

211
00:26:45,947 --> 00:27:04,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we talk about why internal respiration is the correct answer, I do wanna make a point that on your TEAS exam, you should be prepared to study cellular respiration, cellular reproduction are all things that you should study as they may show up on the biology questions of your exam.

212
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:14,106
[SPEAKER_00]: So internal respiration is the process where oxygen is released from the red blood cells into the tissues and the cells of the body.

213
00:27:14,751 --> 00:27:25,613
[SPEAKER_00]: this occurs in the capillaries where oxygen moves from the blood to the cells and carbon dioxide moves from the cells into the blood to be carried away for exhalation.

214
00:27:26,153 --> 00:27:31,854
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a crucial part of how the body gets oxygen to the cells and removes waste gases.

215
00:27:32,335 --> 00:27:39,196
[SPEAKER_00]: So air conduction refers to the movement of air through the respiratory system such as like through the nose and through the trachea

216
00:27:39,805 --> 00:27:45,708
[SPEAKER_00]: but it does not directly involve the exchange of oxygen between blood and the body cells.

217
00:27:46,808 --> 00:27:57,413
[SPEAKER_00]: Cellular respiration is the process by which cells use oxygen to produce energy, also known as ATP, and release carbohydrate as a waste product.

218
00:27:57,993 --> 00:28:07,017
[SPEAKER_00]: But this process happens inside of cells, and it's not really about the release of oxygen from red blood cells like this question is asking.

219
00:28:08,157 --> 00:28:09,658
[SPEAKER_00]: And pulmonary ventilation

220
00:28:10,308 --> 00:28:14,389
[SPEAKER_00]: is the process of basically breathing in or inhaling and breathing out.

221
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:25,833
[SPEAKER_00]: And it involves the movement of air into and out of the lungs, but it does not directly involve the exchange of gases between the blood and the body tissue.

222
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:34,816
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is why internal respiration is correct because it is the exchange of gases like oxygen between the blood and the body's cells.

223
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:39,437
[SPEAKER_00]: The correct answer is D, the cardiovascular system.

224
00:28:40,008 --> 00:28:52,955
[SPEAKER_00]: So hemopoiethesis is the process by which blood cells, such as red blood cells, are produced and it occurs in the bone marrow of the skeletal system.

225
00:28:53,515 --> 00:29:00,378
[SPEAKER_00]: So once these blood cells are produced, they enter the bloodstream, which is then part of the cardiovascular system.

226
00:29:00,899 --> 00:29:09,623
[SPEAKER_00]: The blood cells are then transported throughout the body via blood vessels, playing crucial roles in oxygen transport, immune defense, and clotting.

227
00:29:11,727 --> 00:29:21,450
[SPEAKER_00]: The other systems such as the urinary, digestive, and muscular system, they just don't play a direct role in the production or the transportation of blood cells.

228
00:29:21,951 --> 00:29:27,692
[SPEAKER_00]: So the urethra is the final structure through which urine travels to exit the body.

229
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:36,255
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's time to urinate, the urine moves from the bladder through the urethra and then it is expelled from the body.

230
00:29:36,596 --> 00:29:40,737
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did it take many years for the cell theory to be developed?

231
00:29:43,053 --> 00:29:46,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Advancements in microscopy took place slowly.

232
00:29:47,297 --> 00:29:51,181
[SPEAKER_00]: Cells were difficult to isolate for experimental analysis.

233
00:29:52,642 --> 00:29:56,586
[SPEAKER_00]: Researchers believed a cell formed from pre-existing cells.

234
00:29:57,607 --> 00:30:00,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Or scientists already proved that cells were essential for life.

235
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:09,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the correct answer here is advancements in microscopy took place slowly.

236
00:30:10,386 --> 00:30:27,120
[SPEAKER_00]: And before I dive a little deeper into why this is the correct answer, I do also want to say that this is cell theory as well as microscopy is going to be something that you should expect at least one to two questions on, on your exam.

237
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,802
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important to understand

238
00:30:31,323 --> 00:30:37,565
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much everything there is to know about cells from a biology subject matter context.

239
00:30:37,645 --> 00:30:47,889
[SPEAKER_00]: So cell type, cell function, plant cell versus animal cell, cellular respiration, and cellular reproduction as I mentioned earlier.

240
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:50,370
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, you want to know

241
00:30:51,845 --> 00:31:00,590
[SPEAKER_00]: microscopy in terms of the different types of popular microscopes that you would use in a scientific lab setting.

242
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:08,774
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also want to know things like the different types of like glass containers, different types of scales and things like that.

243
00:31:08,814 --> 00:31:18,880
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to understand the advantages and different that you want to understand the advantages as well as the disadvantages of different types of microscopes.

244
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,421
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a refresher,

245
00:31:20,955 --> 00:31:28,500
[SPEAKER_00]: The cell theory states that all the things are made up of cells and that cells are the basic unit of structure and function in living things.

246
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:42,589
[SPEAKER_00]: But it took a really long time for this idea to develop because microscopy technology, which is the tools you use to actually see the cells, it really took a while to improve and develop over time.

247
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:50,474
[SPEAKER_00]: Early microscopes were not powerful enough to observe the small details of cells and scientists really could not make accurate

248
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:54,769
[SPEAKER_00]: conclusions about cells until the microscopes got better.

249
00:31:55,269 --> 00:32:03,032
[SPEAKER_00]: Which term describes complex carbohydrate molecules consisting of numerous monosaccharide units?

250
00:32:05,032 --> 00:32:14,095
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it monomers, diosaccharides, polysaccharides, or oligosaccharides?

251
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,736
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of those questions

252
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:26,712
[SPEAKER_00]: that I was alluding to in the beginning of the video when we first had that question about enzymes that help digest proteins.

253
00:32:26,832 --> 00:32:35,415
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was saying that it's really important to have a good understanding of macromolecules because you will see questions on it kind of in an A and P context.

254
00:32:35,556 --> 00:32:46,900
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to see questions on macromolecules in more of a biology context, which is going to be just a little bit more detailed than what you would see in an A and P setting.

255
00:32:47,578 --> 00:32:48,858
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a prime example of that.

256
00:32:49,338 --> 00:32:52,499
[SPEAKER_00]: And the correct answer here is polysaccharides.

257
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:10,263
[SPEAKER_00]: So polysaccharides is a complex carbohydrate made up of many monosaccharide units, which is basically what this question is asking.

258
00:33:11,283 --> 00:33:14,944
[SPEAKER_00]: Monosaccharide is a simple sugar and it's linked together.

259
00:33:15,652 --> 00:33:28,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Polysaccharides can be very large molecules and include substances like starch, glycerin, and cellulose, which are important for energy storage and structural support in organisms.

260
00:33:30,006 --> 00:33:32,689
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about why the other options are not correct here.

261
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:39,255
[SPEAKER_00]: So a monomer is a single molecule that can bind to other molecules to form a polymer.

262
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:53,891
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the monosaccharides are the monomers that make up larger carbohydrates, but monomers by themselves are not complex carbohydrates, which is specifically described in this question.

263
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:57,233
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you said answer choice A, I can understand why.

264
00:33:59,195 --> 00:34:05,160
[SPEAKER_00]: A diosaccharide is a carbohydrate composed of two monosaccharide units.

265
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,444
[SPEAKER_00]: This question specifically asked for several or many

266
00:34:11,598 --> 00:34:16,721
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is why this question, that is why this answer isn't correct.

267
00:34:17,081 --> 00:34:25,565
[SPEAKER_00]: Oligosaccharides are carbohydrates made up of a few monosaccharides, usually somewhere between like three and 10.

268
00:34:26,025 --> 00:34:37,691
[SPEAKER_00]: And so while they are larger than diacycrites, they are not as large or as complex as polysaccharides, which have many more of those units.

269
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:45,721
[SPEAKER_00]: Polysaccharides are large, complex carbohydrates made up of many monosaccharide units.

270
00:34:46,201 --> 00:34:53,502
[SPEAKER_00]: They have more than any of the other options listed on here, which is why polysaccharides is the correct answer.

271
00:34:56,023 --> 00:35:03,064
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following organelles is not separated from the cytoplasm due to the presence of its own membrane?

272
00:35:04,264 --> 00:35:08,945
[SPEAKER_00]: The mitochondrion, the nucleus, the ribosome,

273
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:10,502
[SPEAKER_00]: the vacuole.

274
00:35:16,064 --> 00:35:20,145
[SPEAKER_00]: So the correct answer here is C, the bribosome.

275
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:29,728
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is asking organelles is not separated from the cytoplasm due to the presence of its own membrane.

276
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:30,368
[SPEAKER_00]: So

277
00:35:31,258 --> 00:35:37,040
[SPEAKER_00]: As a refresher, the ribosomes are a small structure in cells that make proteins.

278
00:35:37,481 --> 00:35:41,162
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes them unique is that they do not have a membrane around them.

279
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:48,445
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that they are directly in the cytoplasm, which is the jelly-like substance that fills the cell.

280
00:35:48,845 --> 00:35:52,187
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna add a picture of it here so you can see it.

281
00:35:53,507 --> 00:35:57,089
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the other answer choices here.

282
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:59,770
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mitochondrion

283
00:36:01,122 --> 00:36:05,483
[SPEAKER_00]: is the part of the cell that makes the energy.

284
00:36:05,623 --> 00:36:12,544
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually has a double membrane, which means it has two layers of membrane and that separates it from the cytoplasm.

285
00:36:13,285 --> 00:36:16,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got the nucleus, which holds all of the cell's DNA.

286
00:36:17,365 --> 00:36:22,586
[SPEAKER_00]: The nucleus is surrounded by nuclear membrane, which separates it from the cytoplasm.

287
00:36:23,187 --> 00:36:25,007
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly we've got the vacuole,

288
00:36:25,468 --> 00:36:36,412
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the storage organelles within the cells and they hold things like water and nutrients and they have a membrane around them to keep their contents separate from the cytoplasm.

289
00:36:36,812 --> 00:36:49,777
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is why the ribosome is correct because it's the only organelle of these answer choices that does not have a membrane and it is the only one that is directly in the cytoplasm.

290
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:56,814
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following is a primary use of microscopy in healthcare?

291
00:36:57,294 --> 00:36:58,735
[SPEAKER_00]: Another microscope question.

292
00:36:59,976 --> 00:37:12,364
[SPEAKER_00]: Administering treatments for chronic diseases, diagnosing infections, performing surgical procedures, or prescribing medications?

293
00:37:12,384 --> 00:37:19,209
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the correct answer is B, diagnosing infections.

294
00:37:24,747 --> 00:37:41,210
[SPEAKER_00]: So microscopy is a crucial tool in healthcare because it allows medical professionals to examine tiny organisms, things like bacteria and viruses up close or any cells that might be abnormal, that might be causing an infection or a disease.

295
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:54,173
[SPEAKER_00]: So by using a microscope, doctors can identify pathogens in samples such as from blood or urine or tissues, which helps them diagnose infections as well as other conditions or diseases.

296
00:37:57,213 --> 00:38:04,376
[SPEAKER_00]: In a DNA double helix, adaline is a nucleotide base that pairs with which of the following?

297
00:38:09,197 --> 00:38:11,498
[SPEAKER_00]: The correct answer here is thymine.

298
00:38:11,918 --> 00:38:21,142
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so in a DNA double helix, the nucleotide bases pair up in a very specific way to form the structure of the DNA molecule.

299
00:38:21,862 --> 00:38:24,703
[SPEAKER_00]: And the base pairing follows essentially these rules.

300
00:38:25,418 --> 00:38:29,280
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got adaline always pairs with thymine.

301
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,801
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our correct answer.

302
00:38:31,641 --> 00:38:38,104
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have cytosine always pairs with guanine.

303
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:43,367
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is because of the very specific chemical bonds that form between the bases.

304
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:49,550
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, adaline and thymine form two hydrogen bonds with each other and

305
00:38:50,932 --> 00:38:55,314
[SPEAKER_00]: and cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds.

306
00:38:55,754 --> 00:39:02,378
[SPEAKER_00]: So this complementary base pairing is crucial for DNA replication and maintaining the structure of genetic code.

307
00:39:02,898 --> 00:39:08,741
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you are studying for your cheese exam, you should definitely be prepared to see questions just like this.

308
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:14,984
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be asked questions on genetics and DNA, and you're also going to

309
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,342
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially see questions on Punnett Square.

310
00:39:18,402 --> 00:39:21,925
[SPEAKER_00]: So brush up on your information regarding genetics and DNA.

311
00:39:22,225 --> 00:39:28,610
[SPEAKER_00]: A patient's medication prescription is for 75 milligrams of a drug.

312
00:39:29,371 --> 00:39:37,657
[SPEAKER_00]: If the tablets come in 25 milligram doses, which of the following indicates how many tablets should the patient take?

313
00:39:39,078 --> 00:39:43,082
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three, or four.

314
00:39:54,526 --> 00:40:03,350
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the answer here is three tablets because three times 25 would equal 75 milligram.

315
00:40:03,751 --> 00:40:09,593
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following is the primary advantage of using a light microscope?

316
00:40:11,674 --> 00:40:17,017
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides higher resolution and magnification than electron microscopes.

317
00:40:18,058 --> 00:40:22,680
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows for the observation of live microorganisms in real time.

318
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:27,933
[SPEAKER_00]: It can visualize viruses and subcellular organelles.

319
00:40:28,773 --> 00:40:33,155
[SPEAKER_00]: It is more complex and expensive than electron microscopes.

320
00:40:40,379 --> 00:40:47,262
[SPEAKER_00]: So the answer here is B. It allows for the observation of live microorganisms in real time.

321
00:40:48,002 --> 00:40:51,224
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't say I didn't tell you that you would

322
00:40:52,086 --> 00:40:54,047
[SPEAKER_00]: have questions on microscopes.

323
00:40:54,067 --> 00:41:00,370
[SPEAKER_00]: So you definitely want to make sure that you know light microscopes as well as electron microscopes.

324
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:08,534
[SPEAKER_00]: So the primary advantage of a light microscope is that it is easier to use, it's more affordable, and it allows for the observation of live specimen.

325
00:41:09,114 --> 00:41:21,340
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, an electron microscope offers much higher magnification and resolution and it allows for a super detailed examination of structures, but it's really more of like at a molecular

326
00:41:22,038 --> 00:41:29,523
[SPEAKER_00]: or an anatomic level, and it requires specimens to be non-living and often prepared in very specific ways.

327
00:41:31,504 --> 00:41:35,486
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is why light microscopes are awesome.

328
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:45,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following ions from a base react with hydrogen ions in a neutralization reaction?

329
00:41:57,224 --> 00:42:00,547
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the answer is going to be B, hydroxide.

330
00:42:00,887 --> 00:42:08,394
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a neutralization reaction, a base reacts with an acid to produce water and a salt.

331
00:42:09,115 --> 00:42:20,405
[SPEAKER_00]: The key to this reaction is the interaction between hydroxide ions from the base and the hydrogen ions from the acid.

332
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:22,387
[SPEAKER_00]: So the,

333
00:42:24,511 --> 00:42:35,019
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydroxic ions from the base react with the hydrogen ions from the acid to form water, which then neutralizes the solution.

334
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:41,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following is classified as a type of acid-base reaction that produces a salt?

335
00:42:43,046 --> 00:42:49,311
[SPEAKER_00]: Combination, decomposition, hydrolysis, or neutralization?

336
00:42:49,331 --> 00:42:52,113
[SPEAKER_00]: So the answer here is neutralization.

337
00:42:55,877 --> 00:43:03,002
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a neutralization reaction, an acid reacts with a base to produce a salt and water.

338
00:43:03,702 --> 00:43:15,410
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, when a hydrochloric acid reacts with sodium hydroxide, it forms sodium chloride, which is a salt and a water.

339
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:21,534
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the classic acid-base reaction that produces as a salt as a product.

340
00:43:22,614 --> 00:43:23,655
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the classic

341
00:43:24,186 --> 00:43:27,788
[SPEAKER_00]: acid-base reaction that produces a salt as a product.

342
00:43:30,989 --> 00:43:34,491
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's touch upon why the other options are not correct.

343
00:43:34,571 --> 00:43:46,017
[SPEAKER_00]: So a combination reaction involves two or more substances combining to form a single product, but it doesn't specifically produce a salt from an acid and a base.

344
00:43:48,173 --> 00:43:55,114
[SPEAKER_00]: A decomposition reaction involves a single compound breaking down into two or more simpler substances.

345
00:43:55,614 --> 00:43:59,295
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not an acid-base reaction and it does not produce a salt.

346
00:44:01,855 --> 00:44:10,697
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, hydrolysis involves the breakdown of a compound by water simply to form ions or molecules.

347
00:44:10,817 --> 00:44:14,558
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not an acid-base reaction and it does not produce a salt.

348
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:38,084
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to your A&P questions, your scientific reasoning questions, and your biology questions, as you see here, you are going to be tested on your chemistry, knowledge, and comprehension, which seems scary for a lot of people, especially if you just have not taken a chemistry class as recently as maybe you took your A&P classes.

349
00:44:38,644 --> 00:44:45,389
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the chemistry questions on the TEAS exam, you're gonna need to know things like acids and bases,

350
00:44:46,107 --> 00:45:00,661
[SPEAKER_00]: trends of the periodic table, the types of chemical reactions, the type of chemical bonds, you're gonna need to know about chemical solutions, formulas, and equations, things like calculating moles, molarity, molality, and things like that.

351
00:45:00,761 --> 00:45:10,670
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's been a hot minute and chemistry scares you or really just preparing for the TEAS in general scares you and seems overwhelming,

352
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:14,572
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend that you check out our TEAS online course.

353
00:45:14,692 --> 00:45:24,036
[SPEAKER_00]: It has everything that you need to study in one single place for your TEAS exam, not only for science, but also for reading, English, and math.

354
00:45:24,816 --> 00:45:40,863
[SPEAKER_00]: But specifically, students love our science study materials because it's really short and sweet and simple to understand study lessons, but they also include lots of videos, lots of PDFs, as well as interactive practice questions and flashcards, so people

355
00:45:41,327 --> 00:45:46,230
[SPEAKER_00]: really find those beneficial, especially visual learners or people that are on the go.

356
00:45:46,611 --> 00:45:56,097
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely check out the TEAS online course, open up a new tab right now and go to www.smartadditionacademy.com.

357
00:45:56,297 --> 00:45:58,779
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's get into the next question now.

358
00:46:04,963 --> 00:46:09,927
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following methods helps to eliminate bias in an experiment?

359
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:28,441
[SPEAKER_00]: So the correct answer here is a random assignment of participants to experimental groups.

360
00:46:32,663 --> 00:46:48,748
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our second question on eliminating bias and random assignment of participants to experimental groups is gonna be the best way to eliminate bias because you want the results to be as

361
00:46:49,920 --> 00:47:04,633
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to replicate as possible and straying away from using people because of a personal preference or specific age groups or a specific environment or geographic location like the previous question had asked.

362
00:47:05,394 --> 00:47:15,403
[SPEAKER_00]: The more random, the better for eliminating bias and the more you eliminate bias, the easier it is to replicate your experiment

363
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:26,665
[SPEAKER_00]: So which of the following types of bond forms between nitrogen and oxygen and why?

364
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:32,211
[SPEAKER_00]: The correct answer here is covalent because electrons are shared.

365
00:47:32,592 --> 00:47:39,379
[SPEAKER_00]: So a covalent bond forms when two atoms share electrons in order to fill their outer electron shells.

366
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:42,522
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of nitrogen and oxygen,

367
00:47:43,154 --> 00:47:50,059
[SPEAKER_00]: both elements need electrons to complete their outer shells so they share electrons to form a stable bond.

368
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:56,143
[SPEAKER_00]: This type of bond is called a covalent bond where electrons are shared between the two atoms.

369
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:58,825
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about why the other ones are incorrect.

370
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:10,589
[SPEAKER_00]: ionic bond because electrons are shared so ionic bonds form when electrons are transferred from one atom to another not shared.

371
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:20,333
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one ionic because electrons are transferred so while ionic bonds do involve the transfer of electrons like we just discussed

372
00:48:20,933 --> 00:48:25,874
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen and oxygen form a covalent bond, not an ionic bond.

373
00:48:26,254 --> 00:48:34,776
[SPEAKER_00]: They both have similar electronegativity, ability to attract electrons, so they share electrons rather than transferring them.

374
00:48:35,936 --> 00:48:39,237
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, a covalent bond because electrons are transferred.

375
00:48:39,257 --> 00:48:46,278
[SPEAKER_00]: We've sort of talked about this, but this is incorrect because in a covalent bond, electrons are shared, not transferred.

376
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,121
[SPEAKER_00]: So when electrons are shared, it forms an ionic bond.

377
00:48:50,141 --> 00:49:01,925
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's really important to know what covalent bonds are, what ionic bonds are, what they do, what they don't do, and just really have a deeper understanding of chemistry on that level.

378
00:49:01,985 --> 00:49:08,728
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if you need a refresher on all of these different chemistry topics, be sure to check out the online course.

379
00:49:15,413 --> 00:49:18,936
[SPEAKER_00]: So which of the following atoms is a cation?

380
00:49:19,577 --> 00:49:27,583
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the correct answer here is D, 82 protons, 125 neutrons, and 78 electrons.

381
00:49:29,785 --> 00:49:36,951
[SPEAKER_00]: So a cation is an ion that has a positive charge, which means it has more protons than it has electrons.

382
00:49:37,415 --> 00:49:47,978
[SPEAKER_00]: So when an atom loses electrons, it becomes positively charged because protons, which are positively charged, outnumber the electrons, which are negatively charged.

383
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:56,540
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the answer choice D, 82 protons, 125 neutrons, 78 electrons, this atom has 82 protons and 78 electrons, which means that it has four more protons than electrons.

384
00:50:05,033 --> 00:50:08,237
[SPEAKER_00]: which means it is a positively charged ion or a cation.

385
00:50:08,277 --> 00:50:11,841
[SPEAKER_00]: The positive charge is because there are more protons than electrons.

386
00:50:26,308 --> 00:50:29,950
[SPEAKER_00]: A spoonful of sugar is added to a hot cup of coffee.

387
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,111
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the sugar dissolves.

388
00:50:32,911 --> 00:50:36,773
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following describes the resulting solution?

389
00:50:43,897 --> 00:50:48,279
[SPEAKER_00]: The correct answer here is unsaturated and homeogenous.

390
00:50:49,923 --> 00:50:52,764
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's break this correct answer down into two parts.

391
00:50:52,844 --> 00:51:03,789
[SPEAKER_00]: So a solution is unsaturated when more solute, in this case sugar, can be dissolved in the solvent, which in this case is the tea, at the given temperature.

392
00:51:04,309 --> 00:51:16,494
[SPEAKER_00]: So since the sugar dissolved completely and no solid sugar remains, there is still potential to dissolve more sugar, assuming the solution is not at its maximum capacity.

393
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:18,995
[SPEAKER_00]: So in simple words,

394
00:51:20,581 --> 00:51:27,944
[SPEAKER_00]: the person making the tea can decide to add even more sugar into the tea, it's not completely saturated.

395
00:51:27,964 --> 00:51:40,008
[SPEAKER_00]: The second part of this answer is the solution is homogeneous because the sugar completely dissolves in the tea and you cannot see any distinct layers of separation.

396
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:47,860
[SPEAKER_00]: So meaning the tea and the sugar have become completely mixed in a uniform fashion at a molecular level.

397
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:53,362
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that sugar is in the tea, you really can't take the sugar out of it.

398
00:51:53,742 --> 00:51:56,704
[SPEAKER_00]: You can add more sugar to it, but you can't take the sugar out of it.

399
00:51:57,104 --> 00:51:58,444
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's mixed, it's mixed.

400
00:51:59,625 --> 00:52:01,606
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is why the correct answer is C.

401
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:15,946
[SPEAKER_00]: In the following single replacement reaction, blank replaces blank.

402
00:52:18,827 --> 00:52:22,649
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the correct answer here is chlorine and iodine.

403
00:52:23,189 --> 00:52:30,272
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a single replacement reaction, one element replaces another in a compound.

404
00:52:30,913 --> 00:52:33,714
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's break down this reaction.

405
00:52:34,454 --> 00:52:38,776
[SPEAKER_00]: The chlorine reacts with the sodium iodine,

406
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:53,590
[SPEAKER_00]: The chlorine then displaces the iodine from the sodium iodide, forming sodium chloride and iodine gas.

407
00:52:54,431 --> 00:53:00,234
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that the chlorine replaces the iodine in the compound.

408
00:53:00,714 --> 00:53:03,115
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about some of the other answer choices.

409
00:53:03,816 --> 00:53:05,877
[SPEAKER_00]: So sodium and iodine.

410
00:53:06,979 --> 00:53:11,643
[SPEAKER_00]: This is incorrect because the sodium does not replace iodine in this reaction.

411
00:53:12,123 --> 00:53:16,306
[SPEAKER_00]: The sodium does not change or replace anything in the process.

412
00:53:18,088 --> 00:53:19,088
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorine and sodium.

413
00:53:19,228 --> 00:53:23,552
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is incorrect because the chlorine does not replace sodium in this reaction.

414
00:53:24,673 --> 00:53:28,956
[SPEAKER_00]: The chlorine replaces the iodine and the sodium remains the same.

415
00:53:30,627 --> 00:53:32,848
[SPEAKER_00]: and then sodium and chlorine.

416
00:53:33,248 --> 00:53:36,710
[SPEAKER_00]: This is incorrect because the sodium is not replacing the chlorine.

417
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:41,612
[SPEAKER_00]: The chlorine is the element that is replacing iodine in the reaction.

418
00:53:51,078 --> 00:53:55,381
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of reaction is described by the following equation?

419
00:53:55,981 --> 00:54:05,187
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're taking this test along with me and you're like, man, this feels like a lot of chemistry all of the sudden, I can definitely understand.

420
00:54:05,247 --> 00:54:10,250
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a reminder, when you're taking the real TEAS exam, there's gonna be 50 questions.

421
00:54:10,751 --> 00:54:20,517
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those are going to be unscored, but you should expect 18 AMP questions, eight chemistry questions, nine biology questions,

422
00:54:21,036 --> 00:54:25,139
[SPEAKER_00]: and eight scientific reasoning questions that are actually scored.

423
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:29,503
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes students say, man, my test felt like really heavy one way or the other.

424
00:54:29,903 --> 00:54:34,507
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be that those extra unscored questions were in one particular topic.

425
00:54:34,527 --> 00:54:47,037
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be A and P or it could be chemistry or any of the above, but just in case you were feeling like that and thinking like that, that's why, but on the real exam, you will only have eight scored.

426
00:54:47,574 --> 00:54:48,534
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry questions.

427
00:54:48,734 --> 00:54:57,216
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see more than eight questions, but only eight of them will be scored and know when you're taking the real test, they're not going to tell you which are scored and which are not.

428
00:54:57,716 --> 00:55:02,778
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the answer, the correct answer here is double replacement.

429
00:55:02,898 --> 00:55:12,160
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a double replacement reaction, two compounds react and their positive and negative ions basically switch places

430
00:55:12,732 --> 00:55:14,773
[SPEAKER_00]: forming two new compounds.

431
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:17,814
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's break down this equation a little bit.

432
00:55:19,674 --> 00:55:26,876
[SPEAKER_00]: So the zinc bromide and the potassium hydroxide are basically dissolved in water.

433
00:55:28,737 --> 00:55:38,720
[SPEAKER_00]: The zinc bromide reacts with the potassium hydroxide to form zinc hydroxide, which then becomes a solid.

434
00:55:41,568 --> 00:55:44,829
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium bromate stays in the solution.

435
00:55:46,329 --> 00:55:57,152
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this reaction, the zinc and the potassium switch places with the bromine and hydroxide, making it a double replacement reaction.

436
00:55:57,972 --> 00:56:00,273
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about why the other options are not correct.

437
00:56:00,353 --> 00:56:07,675
[SPEAKER_00]: So a synthesis reaction occurs when two or more simple substances combine to form a more complex substance.

438
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:14,095
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what's happening here because two compounds are basically breaking apart and forming new compounds.

439
00:56:14,375 --> 00:56:15,516
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not combining.

440
00:56:17,137 --> 00:56:23,343
[SPEAKER_00]: A decomposition reaction occurs when a single compound breaks into two or more simpler substances.

441
00:56:23,803 --> 00:56:29,848
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, in this reaction, we have two compounds reacting, not one breaking apart.

442
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:35,693
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in a single replacement reaction, one element replaces another in a compound.

443
00:56:36,128 --> 00:56:42,232
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if the zinc replaced the potassium, then it would be a single replacement reaction.

444
00:56:42,272 --> 00:56:49,958
[SPEAKER_00]: However, here, the two compounds are reacting and they're exchanging ions, so it's not a single replacement reaction.

445
00:56:51,539 --> 00:56:55,822
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following best illustrates multiple alleles?

446
00:56:56,983 --> 00:57:01,286
[SPEAKER_00]: Blood type in humans with A, B, and O alleles.

447
00:57:02,447 --> 00:57:03,427
[SPEAKER_00]: Height in humans.

448
00:57:05,412 --> 00:57:14,758
[SPEAKER_00]: two alleles blending together to create a mixed phenotype or genes inherited from two different chromosomes.

449
00:57:22,663 --> 00:57:29,027
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the correct answer here is blood type in humans with A, B, and O alleles.

450
00:57:29,587 --> 00:57:32,169
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why answer A is correct is because

451
00:57:32,693 --> 00:57:39,778
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple alleles means that there are more than two possible forms of gene in a population, okay?

452
00:57:39,818 --> 00:57:50,867
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember when I said earlier that you would definitely need to have a good understanding of genetics and DNA for your TEAS test, so this is a great example question of that knowledge coming up.

453
00:57:51,527 --> 00:58:01,475
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the case of the human blood type, there are three different alleles in this variation, A, B, and O, that would determine the blood type.

454
00:58:02,095 --> 00:58:13,283
[SPEAKER_00]: These alleles can combine in various ways to create the blood types we know, such as A, B, AB, and O. So let's talk about really quick why the other ones are incorrect here.

455
00:58:13,964 --> 00:58:15,805
[SPEAKER_00]: So B, height in humans.

456
00:58:15,905 --> 00:58:23,291
[SPEAKER_00]: So height can be influenced by many genes working together rather than one gene with multiple alleles.

457
00:58:26,233 --> 00:58:31,137
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of what's called a polygenic trait, which means many genes

458
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:39,481
[SPEAKER_00]: which means many genes affect one trait, not a case of multiple alleles like this question is asking.

459
00:58:40,501 --> 00:58:44,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Two alleles blending together to create a mixed phenotype.

460
00:58:44,582 --> 00:58:51,045
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is describing an incomplete dominance rather than multiple alleles.

461
00:58:51,105 --> 00:58:57,847
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about incomplete dominance, what that means is two alleles blend together to make a

462
00:58:58,467 --> 00:59:03,249
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed phenotype, like red and white flowers creating pink, for example.

463
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:13,234
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple alleles involves more than two choices, like the correct answer, A, B, and O blood types, not just blending.

464
00:59:14,095 --> 00:59:18,257
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, genes inherited from two different chromosomes.

465
00:59:18,317 --> 00:59:22,299
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not correct because this is completely unrelated to multiple alleles.

466
00:59:22,779 --> 00:59:26,381
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple alleles refers to different forms of the same gene.

467
00:59:26,828 --> 00:59:29,850
[SPEAKER_00]: not genes on separate chromosomes.

468
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:37,174
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following phase changes will the cohesion between the particles of a substance decrease?

469
00:59:37,354 --> 00:59:46,479
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is pulling in some of that states of matter and properties of matter information that you should also be aware of when prepping for your TEAS exam.

470
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:54,403
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got condensation, deposition, freezing, and vaporization.

471
01:00:00,211 --> 01:00:03,832
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the correct answer here is D, vaporization.

472
01:00:03,852 --> 01:00:10,014
[SPEAKER_00]: So vaporization is the phase change that talks about a liquid to a gas.

473
01:00:10,054 --> 01:00:14,195
[SPEAKER_00]: So an example of this is when water boils and turns into steam.

474
01:00:14,735 --> 01:00:29,800
[SPEAKER_00]: During this change, the particles move further apart and the cohesion or say like the attraction between them decreases significantly because they are moving more freely and they are no longer tightly connected into a liquid form.

475
01:00:31,453 --> 01:00:38,138
[SPEAKER_00]: So condensation is incorrect because condensation is the change from a gas to a liquid.

476
01:00:38,598 --> 01:00:41,821
[SPEAKER_00]: So when steam cools down and then turns back into water.

477
01:00:42,301 --> 01:00:50,327
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, particles are moving closer together, which then increases cohesion rather than decreases it.

478
01:00:51,078 --> 01:01:05,743
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are refreshing your knowledge on states of matter, properties of matter, one of the things that you're going to want to make sure that you have a really good understanding of is what happens in each of the different stages, specifically when it comes to cohesion.

479
01:01:05,863 --> 01:01:08,104
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the particles moving quicker?

480
01:01:08,284 --> 01:01:09,244
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they moving slower?

481
01:01:09,404 --> 01:01:12,085
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the particles slower and further apart?

482
01:01:12,325 --> 01:01:13,766
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are they closer together?

483
01:01:13,906 --> 01:01:14,626
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they more dense?

484
01:01:14,646 --> 01:01:20,788
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of want to have a good understanding of, during each of these phases, what is happening to the particles.

485
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:31,357
[SPEAKER_00]: So deposition is not correct because deposition is the change from a gas directly to a solid, something like frost forming on a window.

486
01:01:31,797 --> 01:01:39,101
[SPEAKER_00]: During deposition, particles come closer together and they form a solid, which then increases cohesion.

487
01:01:39,261 --> 01:01:45,884
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, knowing what the particles are doing and if it is increasing or decreasing cohesion.

488
01:01:46,805 --> 01:01:51,267
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, freezing is the phase change from a liquid to a solid.

489
01:01:51,703 --> 01:02:02,547
[SPEAKER_00]: So when water becomes ice and freezing, particles move closer together and they form a solid structure, again, increasing cohesion instead of decreasing it.

490
01:02:03,067 --> 01:02:12,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so you are gonna see just a little tiny bit of math when you are answering the questions on the science section.

491
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:16,551
[SPEAKER_00]: This may actually also come up just a little tiny bit on the reading section.

492
01:02:16,591 --> 01:02:19,012
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes there's questions about like say recipes,

493
01:02:20,034 --> 01:02:43,539
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a question about you know how much time passed between the time that Bob arrived to the party and Stacy left so some of that information will be given to you it's typically pretty simple straightforward math so don't stress out too too much but here we've got kind of a math problem so let's tackle it together a patient's blood pressure is a hundred

494
01:02:44,308 --> 01:02:57,923
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 millimeters of mercury convert this pressure to kilopascals given that 1 mmHg is approximately 0.133 kPa.

495
01:02:58,564 --> 01:03:03,209
[SPEAKER_00]: So while you're working out the math I do want to remind you that in most cases

496
01:03:03,763 --> 01:03:05,825
[SPEAKER_00]: conversions are not provided to you.

497
01:03:05,905 --> 01:03:11,049
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you take the math section, the formulas and the conversions are not provided to you.

498
01:03:11,269 --> 01:03:16,273
[SPEAKER_00]: You are expected to have them memorized for the most common conversions.

499
01:03:16,353 --> 01:03:27,502
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking things like ounces to cups, cups to gallons, milligrams to grams, kilograms to pounds, like your standard metric conversions.

500
01:03:27,908 --> 01:03:35,792
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to something like this, that's very specific, like a kilopascal, a kilopascal is not something that they're gonna expect you to have memorized.

501
01:03:35,832 --> 01:03:45,878
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, you're basically just doing a little bit of math to determine what the answer is, given what they have provided you.

502
01:03:45,958 --> 01:03:51,361
[SPEAKER_00]: So the correct answer here is actually A, 18.62 kilopascals.

503
01:03:51,962 --> 01:03:55,944
[SPEAKER_00]: So kilopascals, the way you needed to do here was 140,

504
01:03:58,930 --> 01:04:02,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiply that by 0.133.

505
01:04:02,971 --> 01:04:04,692
[SPEAKER_00]: This information was provided to you.

506
01:04:04,772 --> 01:04:13,534
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you calculate that with the four function calculator that they will provide to you on the screen, you will see 18.62.

507
01:04:13,714 --> 01:04:17,175
[SPEAKER_00]: So this math problem is relatively simple.

508
01:04:17,315 --> 01:04:22,997
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really more so testing your knowledge of how you would calculate it, right?

509
01:04:24,077 --> 01:04:26,798
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wanted to test you to make sure that you knew

510
01:04:27,382 --> 01:04:31,563
[SPEAKER_00]: that you just needed to multiply this and that you didn't need to make it more complicated than that.

511
01:04:32,163 --> 01:04:37,025
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here is another question very similar to the one that we just answered.

512
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:45,387
[SPEAKER_00]: In which of the following states of matter are the intermolecular forces between particles in a substance the strongest?

513
01:04:46,267 --> 01:04:50,088
[SPEAKER_00]: Gas, liquid, plasma, or solid?

514
01:05:00,795 --> 01:05:04,356
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the correct answer here is going to be a solid.

515
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:11,839
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a solid, particles are packed very closely together, and they vibrate in a very fixed position.

516
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:24,703
[SPEAKER_00]: The intermolecular forces, which basically is a very fancy way of saying forces that hold the particles together, are the strongest in a solid, which is why solids have a fixed shape and volume.

517
01:05:26,063 --> 01:05:28,584
[SPEAKER_00]: Just remember that solids, they are the densest,

518
01:05:29,389 --> 01:05:30,649
[SPEAKER_00]: they are the strongest.

519
01:05:30,749 --> 01:05:32,610
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the strongest molecular force.

520
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:37,831
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the plasma, so plasma is very similar to gas.

521
01:05:37,951 --> 01:05:39,891
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a very high energy state.

522
01:05:40,431 --> 01:05:45,032
[SPEAKER_00]: The particles are very far apart and they actually almost have no molecular force at all.

523
01:05:45,452 --> 01:05:52,794
[SPEAKER_00]: Plasmas are actually made of charged particles that move freely, so the intermolecular forces are very very weak.

524
01:05:53,178 --> 01:05:55,219
[SPEAKER_00]: just like they would be in a gas.

525
01:05:55,679 --> 01:06:11,324
[SPEAKER_00]: Sequence of amino acids in a gene determines which of the following, the primary structure of a codon, the primary structure of a protein, the primary structure of a nucleotide, or the primary structure of a nucleic acid?

526
01:06:20,507 --> 01:06:21,747
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the correct answer here

527
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:25,520
[SPEAKER_00]: is the primary structure of a protein.

528
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:33,844
[SPEAKER_00]: So the primary structure of a protein is the specific sequence of anemo acids that are linked together in a chain.

529
01:06:33,964 --> 01:06:40,308
[SPEAKER_00]: And this sequence is determined by a gene which provides instructions on the order of the anemo acids.

530
01:06:40,648 --> 01:06:47,052
[SPEAKER_00]: So the primary structure is sort of like a blueprint that determines the shape and the function of a protein.

531
01:06:47,492 --> 01:06:50,574
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about why the other answers are incorrect.

532
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:59,733
[SPEAKER_00]: A codon is a sequence of three nucleotides in an mRNA that codes for a single enema acids.

533
01:07:00,213 --> 01:07:03,595
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not made of enema acids, they are made of nucleotides.

534
01:07:04,035 --> 01:07:12,521
[SPEAKER_00]: So the gene sequence determines the codons, which then helps specify the enema acids, but the final product is the protein.

535
01:07:14,242 --> 01:07:21,366
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at C. So nucleotides here are the building blocks of DNA and RNA, not proteins.

536
01:07:22,223 --> 01:07:28,464
[SPEAKER_00]: gene sequence is made up of nucleotides, but it doesn't directly determine the primary structure of a nucleotide.

537
01:07:28,884 --> 01:07:33,605
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, what it does is it determines the anemo acid sequence in a protein.

538
01:07:35,526 --> 01:07:38,346
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, we have the primary structure of a nucleic acid.

539
01:07:38,366 --> 01:07:44,728
[SPEAKER_00]: So nucleic acids are chains of nucleotides, not anemo acids.

540
01:07:44,948 --> 01:07:46,728
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, this is meant to

541
01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:52,615
[SPEAKER_00]: to code for a protein, not to define another nucleic acid's structure.

542
01:07:52,635 --> 01:08:05,247
[SPEAKER_00]: So the right answer here is the primary structure of a protein, because the gene sequence directly determines the sequence of enema acids, which then would form the protein's primary structure.

543
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:12,533
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following is true regarding the urinary system?

544
01:08:13,233 --> 01:08:14,774
[SPEAKER_00]: Select all that apply.

545
01:08:15,274 --> 01:08:22,979
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're taking your TEAS exam, version seven does have a few different question types.

546
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:34,907
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part, you're mostly still going to see multiple choice questions, like the ones we've been answering up until now, but you will see sometimes some select all that apply.

547
01:08:36,067 --> 01:08:37,148
[SPEAKER_00]: You will also see

548
01:08:37,753 --> 01:08:42,476
[SPEAKER_00]: question types that are fill in the blank, and you will also see ordered response.

549
01:08:42,956 --> 01:08:52,041
[SPEAKER_00]: There is also another question type called hotspot, where you will be shown an image and you will basically have to click on the image for the correct answer.

550
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,462
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't see too many of them, just a few.

551
01:08:55,783 --> 01:09:06,188
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so for this particular answer, the correct answers here are, can these help regulate water balance?

552
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:06,989
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

553
01:09:07,915 --> 01:09:16,897
[SPEAKER_00]: they regulate levels of electrolytes such as sodium and potassium, also yes, and they eliminate mellabotic waste.

554
01:09:18,478 --> 01:09:28,000
[SPEAKER_00]: What is not true, kidneys do not make urine, and if you are watching this and you're like, what are you talking about, of course they make urine, they don't.

555
01:09:29,135 --> 01:09:32,256
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't, and we'll talk about that more in just a moment.

556
01:09:32,336 --> 01:09:36,697
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't make urine in the sense that you might think that they do.

557
01:09:37,278 --> 01:09:38,098
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't make urine.

558
01:09:38,958 --> 01:09:43,620
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a person ages, kidney tissues infiltration capacity increases.

559
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,340
[SPEAKER_00]: That is also not true.

560
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:47,321
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's break this down just a little bit more.

561
01:09:48,741 --> 01:09:50,262
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the correct answers.

562
01:09:51,666 --> 01:09:53,667
[SPEAKER_00]: Kidneys help regulate water balance.

563
01:09:53,687 --> 01:10:01,068
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, the kidneys control the amount of water in the body by adjusting how much water is reabsorbed or excreted in the urine.

564
01:10:01,529 --> 01:10:08,050
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps keep a stable water balance, which is essential for maintaining blood pressure and just overall hydration.

565
01:10:10,251 --> 01:10:14,192
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulates levels of electrolytes such as sodium and potassium.

566
01:10:16,077 --> 01:10:30,151
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, kidneys definitely play a role in balancing electrolytes, they filter blood and they adjust the levels of these minerals based on the body's needs, which is crucial for functions like muscle contraction and nerve signaling.

567
01:10:34,015 --> 01:10:35,595
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminates melobotic waste.

568
01:10:35,736 --> 01:10:45,138
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, this is true because the kidneys filter out waste products from the blood such as urea and creatine, which are byproducts of metabolism.

569
01:10:45,638 --> 01:10:48,759
[SPEAKER_00]: These wastes are then eliminated from the body in urine.

570
01:10:49,880 --> 01:11:01,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Now before we talk about why the other two answer choices are not correct, I also just want to let you know that on the TEAS exam, there is no such thing as partial credit.

571
01:11:01,838 --> 01:11:11,345
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you've got a question like this, that is select all that apply, if you selected four instead of three, you're not gonna get like a 50%.

572
01:11:12,026 --> 01:11:18,230
[SPEAKER_00]: If there was three correct answers and you only selected two of them, you're not getting a 66% on that question.

573
01:11:18,871 --> 01:11:21,653
[SPEAKER_00]: It simply just will not, it'll just be straight up wrong.

574
01:11:22,133 --> 01:11:23,934
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with the fill in the blank questions.

575
01:11:23,994 --> 01:11:27,957
[SPEAKER_00]: If you spell the word wrong, you're not getting that question right.

576
01:11:30,641 --> 01:11:31,521
[SPEAKER_00]: Kidneys make urine.

577
01:11:31,582 --> 01:11:44,428
[SPEAKER_00]: So kidneys do play a role in filtering blood and they play a role in forming urine, but they do not actually make urine in the simple sense.

578
01:11:45,208 --> 01:11:57,135
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, kidneys filter out wastes and they adjust water and electrolytes, which is then excreted as urine through other parts of the urinary system.

579
01:11:57,895 --> 01:11:59,816
[SPEAKER_00]: What actually makes urine

580
01:12:00,775 --> 01:12:05,639
[SPEAKER_00]: are things called nephrons, which is what kidneys are actually made up of.

581
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:13,966
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a reminder, nephrons are basically the functional units of the kidneys where all of the process of urine formation occurs.

582
01:12:15,217 --> 01:12:17,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Each kidneys has about a million nephrons.

583
01:12:18,238 --> 01:12:23,679
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, as a person ages, kidney tissue infiltration capacity increase.

584
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:24,759
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is incorrect.

585
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:26,680
[SPEAKER_00]: The statement is actually the opposite.

586
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:31,961
[SPEAKER_00]: As people age, kidney tissue infiltration capacity tend to decrease, not increase.

587
01:12:32,601 --> 01:12:38,383
[SPEAKER_00]: Aging can lead to reduced kidney function, which makes it harder for the kidneys to filter blood effectively.

588
01:12:45,655 --> 01:12:48,958
[SPEAKER_00]: During the aging process, not all hormone levels decrease.

589
01:12:49,479 --> 01:12:50,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Some actually increase.

590
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:56,025
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following is a hormone that may increase as a person ages?

591
01:12:56,985 --> 01:13:01,930
[SPEAKER_00]: Cortisol, insulin, luteinizing, or thyroid?

592
01:13:11,058 --> 01:13:13,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the correct answer here is luteinizing.

593
01:13:13,959 --> 01:13:19,602
[SPEAKER_00]: So the luteinizing hormone is a hormone involved in regulating the reproductive system.

594
01:13:19,682 --> 01:13:35,129
[SPEAKER_00]: So as people age, particularly during menopause in women, levels of what's called LH often increase because the body tries to stimulate hormone production from the ovaries, which are becoming less responsive.

595
01:13:35,651 --> 01:13:43,665
[SPEAKER_00]: This increase in LH is a natural part of the aging process in both men and women, though it is typically seen more so in women.

596
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,441
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about why the other three are incorrect.

597
01:13:47,481 --> 01:13:54,626
[SPEAKER_00]: So cortisol is a stress hormone that helps regulate metabolism, blood sugar, and immune responses.

598
01:13:54,846 --> 01:14:08,374
[SPEAKER_00]: And though cortisol levels can fluctuate with age and may be higher during times of stress, hashtag adulting anybody, cortisol generally does not increase just as a result of the normal aging process.

599
01:14:08,474 --> 01:14:09,695
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just life.

600
01:14:10,175 --> 01:14:13,477
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nothing to do with aging specifically.

601
01:14:14,892 --> 01:14:15,352
[SPEAKER_00]: insulin.

602
01:14:15,873 --> 01:14:32,547
[SPEAKER_00]: So insulin is the hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels and with age cells in the body may become less sensitive to insulin which can lead to higher blood sugar levels but the actual production of insulin by the pancreas does not typically increase as part of the aging process.

603
01:14:33,867 --> 01:14:35,768
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, the thyroid hormone.

604
01:14:35,868 --> 01:14:44,051
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thyroid hormone helps control metabolism and their levels typically decrease or they stay about the same with age.

605
01:14:44,111 --> 01:14:45,071
[SPEAKER_00]: It really just depends.

606
01:14:45,572 --> 01:14:54,275
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may develop a thyroid issue as they age, but an increase in the thyroid hormone is not part of the aging process.

607
01:14:58,969 --> 01:15:04,834
[SPEAKER_00]: A science student needs to measure 50 milliliters of water for an experiment.

608
01:15:05,475 --> 01:15:09,618
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following measuring instruments should the student use?

609
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:16,584
[SPEAKER_00]: A 100 milliliter graduated cylinder, a 500 milliliter beaker, a 50 milliliter

610
01:15:21,014 --> 01:15:26,656
[SPEAKER_00]: volumetric flask or a 250 milliliter Erlenmeyer flask.

611
01:15:27,316 --> 01:15:38,859
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked about questions like this in the beginning of the video with some of the things that you're going to need to know regarding those nine scientific reasoning questions.

612
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:47,201
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes back to scientific measurements, the scientific method, how to design an experiment, inductive versus deductive reasoning.

613
01:15:47,241 --> 01:15:49,762
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example of that kind of question.

614
01:15:50,927 --> 01:16:00,472
[SPEAKER_00]: it's important for you to be able to differentiate when you need to measure something in a scientific lab, you know, what is appropriate.

615
01:16:00,572 --> 01:16:01,872
[SPEAKER_00]: Is a cylinder appropriate?

616
01:16:01,952 --> 01:16:03,453
[SPEAKER_00]: Is a beaker appropriate?

617
01:16:03,573 --> 01:16:05,494
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is a flask appropriate?

618
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:12,417
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's pros and cons and there's do's and don'ts when measuring for scientific purposes.

619
01:16:12,497 --> 01:16:13,418
[SPEAKER_00]: So again,

620
01:16:13,885 --> 01:16:26,156
[SPEAKER_00]: brushing up on that knowledge using something like the T7 online course to brush up on everything related to your scientific and reasoning, your A&P, your chemistry, and your biology is gonna help you out quite a bit.

621
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:35,705
[SPEAKER_00]: So the correct answer here is a 100 milliliter graduated cylinder.

622
01:16:36,249 --> 01:16:52,282
[SPEAKER_00]: So a graduated cylinder is actually specifically designed for measuring liquid volumes accurately, and it is an acceptable device to be used for measuring specifically in scientific settings.

623
01:16:52,302 --> 01:17:04,512
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 milliliter graduated cylinder will have clear markings that will allow the student to measure exactly 50 milliliters of water, making it the best choice for precise measurement.

624
01:17:06,018 --> 01:17:09,200
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the other things here.

625
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:15,063
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a beaker, we've got a volumetric flask, and then we have a Erlenmeyer flask.

626
01:17:15,123 --> 01:17:16,204
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the beaker.

627
01:17:16,744 --> 01:17:26,249
[SPEAKER_00]: So a beaker is not considered to be as accurate because they have fewer and less precise markings.

628
01:17:26,769 --> 01:17:29,711
[SPEAKER_00]: It just wouldn't be the appropriate thing to grab.

629
01:17:31,257 --> 01:17:34,440
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the volumetric flasks.

630
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:41,787
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so volumetric flasks are accurate and they are designed to be used in a scientific setting.

631
01:17:42,207 --> 01:17:49,895
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they're typically used for making solutions rather than measuring out various amounts of a liquid.

632
01:17:52,505 --> 01:17:56,848
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got the 250 milliliter Erlenmeyer flasks.

633
01:17:56,988 --> 01:18:02,973
[SPEAKER_00]: So Erlenmeyer flasks are actually typically used for mixing or for holding liquids.

634
01:18:02,993 --> 01:18:05,595
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not used for accurate measurements.

635
01:18:06,096 --> 01:18:12,861
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're kind of like beakers in that they just have a few markings, but they're not really designed for precise volume measurement.

636
01:18:13,161 --> 01:18:18,325
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the cylinder is the only thing that was listed here as an answer choice.

637
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:33,822
[SPEAKER_00]: that is widely accepted for accurate and adjustable measurement, and then all of the other options either lacked precision or they were just not intended to be used for measurements in a scientific setting.

638
01:18:35,483 --> 01:18:42,549
[SPEAKER_00]: So really important to, again, know the different types of microscopes, know the different kinds of scales, know the different type of glassware.

639
01:18:42,689 --> 01:18:45,151
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that is going to come up on your TEAS exam.

640
01:18:45,171 --> 01:18:46,072
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following

641
01:18:46,873 --> 01:18:49,834
[SPEAKER_00]: phases is the cell cycle part of?

642
01:18:50,794 --> 01:18:55,316
[SPEAKER_00]: Interphase, metaphase, prophase, or telephase?

643
01:19:05,419 --> 01:19:07,760
[SPEAKER_00]: The correct answer is interphase.

644
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:14,162
[SPEAKER_00]: So interphase is the phase of the cell cycle where the cell spends the majority of its time.

645
01:19:14,262 --> 01:19:16,763
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the interphase, the cell is growing,

646
01:19:17,392 --> 01:19:23,213
[SPEAKER_00]: performs all of its normal functions and then it prepares for division by duplicating its DNA.

647
01:19:23,734 --> 01:19:37,697
[SPEAKER_00]: So interphase has three stages as a reminder that is G1 which is growth, you have the S phase which is where the DNA synthesizes, and then G2 is preparation for division.

648
01:19:38,477 --> 01:19:45,639
[SPEAKER_00]: And interphase is the phase where really all of the essential cell activities happen before actual division begins.

649
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:53,284
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about these other phases, what they are and why they're not correct.

650
01:19:53,624 --> 01:19:58,068
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got metaphase, which is just one of the stages in mitosis.

651
01:19:58,808 --> 01:20:03,992
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what is a specific part of cell division, but it's not the entire cell cycle.

652
01:20:04,452 --> 01:20:10,197
[SPEAKER_00]: In metaphase, chromosomes basically line up in the center of the cell before being separated.

653
01:20:11,918 --> 01:20:12,979
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got prophase.

654
01:20:13,019 --> 01:20:17,042
[SPEAKER_00]: So prophase is also a stage in mitosis.

655
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:20,601
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's not the entire cell cycle.

656
01:20:21,321 --> 01:20:27,522
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens in prophase is that the chromosomes condense, and then the nuclear membrane starts to break down.

657
01:20:28,002 --> 01:20:31,383
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is, again, it's only one part of cell division.

658
01:20:31,523 --> 01:20:33,904
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the cell cycle, which is why it's not correct.

659
01:20:34,764 --> 01:20:40,185
[SPEAKER_00]: And then telophase is another stage inside of mitosis.

660
01:20:41,647 --> 01:20:48,268
[SPEAKER_00]: During telophase, the cell finishes dividing its chromosomes and begins to form two new nuclei.

661
01:20:48,628 --> 01:20:56,129
[SPEAKER_00]: But like the other stages, this is just one step in the cell division, and it's not a separate phase of the entire cell cycle.

662
01:21:03,971 --> 01:21:10,832
[SPEAKER_00]: In which of the following states of matter do the particles of iron have the lowest amount of cohesion?

663
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:15,697
[SPEAKER_00]: Solid iron particles have the lowest amount of cohesion.

664
01:21:16,517 --> 01:21:20,020
[SPEAKER_00]: Liquid iron particles have the lowest amount of cohesion.

665
01:21:21,041 --> 01:21:24,764
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaseous iron particles have the lowest amount of cohesion.

666
01:21:25,525 --> 01:21:29,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the particles have the same amount of cohesion in all states of matter.

667
01:21:30,149 --> 01:21:32,170
[SPEAKER_00]: So this question is very simple.

668
01:21:34,012 --> 01:21:39,957
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds harder because it's basically trying to add a false sense of

669
01:21:40,763 --> 01:21:45,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Difficulty by having you think that iron might be different than anything else.

670
01:21:45,368 --> 01:21:47,490
[SPEAKER_00]: So iron is no different from water.

671
01:21:47,751 --> 01:21:50,333
[SPEAKER_00]: So the correct answer here is actually going to be C.

672
01:21:52,920 --> 01:22:05,988
[SPEAKER_00]: The correct answer is actually going to be C, the gaseous iron particles have the lowest amount of cohesion, and that's because all gas particles have the lowest amount of cohesion.

673
01:22:06,268 --> 01:22:11,752
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not specific to iron, that's just specific to gas particles.

674
01:22:20,503 --> 01:22:28,329
[SPEAKER_00]: A person is diagnosed as having acidosis, a condition in which the blood pH is below 7.45.

675
01:22:30,650 --> 01:22:34,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following does the doctor most likely conclude?

676
01:22:34,970 --> 01:22:38,252
[SPEAKER_00]: There is too much carbon dioxide is found in the blood.

677
01:22:39,053 --> 01:22:41,914
[SPEAKER_00]: Highly oxygenated blood circulates through the body.

678
01:22:41,934 --> 01:22:51,321
[SPEAKER_00]: A blockage prevents blood from leaving the pulmonary artery or the nasal cavity is having a difficult time clearing particles from the air.

679
01:22:52,021 --> 01:22:58,185
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and so the correct answer here is A, too much carbon dioxide is found in the blood.

680
01:23:01,985 --> 01:23:13,070
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the question stated, acidosis refers to a condition where the blood becomes too acidic, which means that the blood pH is below 7.45.

681
01:23:13,351 --> 01:23:24,616
[SPEAKER_00]: So when CO2 combines with water in the blood to form a carbonic acid, which lowers the pH, which then makes the blood more acidic.

682
01:23:27,089 --> 01:23:35,756
[SPEAKER_00]: So this condition can happen when the body has trouble expelling CO2 through breathing, leading to what's called respiratory acidosis.

683
01:23:36,283 --> 01:23:40,486
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about why the other three answer choices are incorrect.

684
01:23:40,526 --> 01:23:41,907
[SPEAKER_00]: So oxygenated blood.

685
01:23:42,547 --> 01:23:52,554
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, oxygenated blood refers to blood that is rich in oxygen and acidosis is related to an imbalance in CO2 levels, not oxygen levels.

686
01:23:53,095 --> 01:23:57,558
[SPEAKER_00]: If the blood is highly oxygenated, it would not cause acidosis.

687
01:24:00,232 --> 01:24:03,175
[SPEAKER_00]: A blockage prevents blood from leaving the pulmonary artery.

688
01:24:03,315 --> 01:24:14,407
[SPEAKER_00]: So a blockage in the pulmonary artery is actually called a pulmonary embolism, and that would affect blood flow and oxygen level, but it would not cause acidosis.

689
01:24:17,099 --> 01:24:21,460
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the nasal cavity has a difficult time clearing particles from the air.

690
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:27,542
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one is more so related to a respiratory issue, but it wouldn't explain acidosis.

691
01:24:28,102 --> 01:24:31,783
[SPEAKER_00]: The point where the small and large intestine meet.

692
01:24:32,963 --> 01:24:39,344
[SPEAKER_00]: The point where the small intestine and large intestine meet is which of the following?

693
01:24:40,765 --> 01:24:45,786
[SPEAKER_00]: The anus, the appendix, the cecum, or the colon.

694
01:24:52,932 --> 01:24:55,233
[SPEAKER_00]: The correct answer is the cecum.

695
01:24:55,713 --> 01:25:03,437
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cecum is the first part of the large intestine, and it is located where the small intestine meets the large intestine.

696
01:25:04,098 --> 01:25:14,803
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this pouch-like structure that marks the beginning of the colon, and the small intestine empties its contents into the cecum, which then leads into the rest of the large intestine.

697
01:25:16,396 --> 01:25:18,897
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about why the other three are incorrect.

698
01:25:18,937 --> 01:25:23,599
[SPEAKER_00]: So the anus is at the opening at the end of the digestive tract.

699
01:25:23,639 --> 01:25:28,341
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put a picture here so we can take a look at the entirety of the digestive tract together.

700
01:25:28,801 --> 01:25:31,382
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where waste is eliminated from the body.

701
01:25:32,883 --> 01:25:40,766
[SPEAKER_00]: The appendix is a small tube-like structure that is attached to the cecum, but it is not where the small and large intestine meet.

702
01:25:43,197 --> 01:25:56,175
[SPEAKER_00]: The colon is the main part of the large intestine but it's further along after the cecum and the colon is divided into several parts including the ascending, the transverse, and the descending.

703
01:25:56,777 --> 01:26:09,119
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's really important as I say those words, this reminds me to remind you that it's important to really have a good understanding of anatomical position and the different planes in the body.

704
01:26:09,179 --> 01:26:18,021
[SPEAKER_00]: So language like ascending, transverse, descending, lateral, all of those words are really important for you to know as you prepare to take this exam.

705
01:26:20,141 --> 01:26:25,722
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I was saying, the colon is divided into several parts and the small intestine meets the large intestine

706
01:26:27,118 --> 01:26:28,959
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at the colon, it's at the cecum.

707
01:26:35,742 --> 01:26:45,046
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following processes involves the addition of water molecules to break down covalent bonds within macromolecules?

708
01:26:46,147 --> 01:26:54,531
[SPEAKER_00]: The dehydration synthesis, the condensation synthesis, the hydrolysis, or the photosynthesis.

709
01:26:55,705 --> 01:27:02,486
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is such a great question because I feel like it sounds like a really hard question.

710
01:27:02,866 --> 01:27:07,567
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it's because it sort of overlaps a lot of different concepts.

711
01:27:07,587 --> 01:27:13,828
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about macromolecules, we're talking about water molecules, and then we're talking about covalent bonds.

712
01:27:13,888 --> 01:27:18,989
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just feels like a question loaded with some chemistry and some biology.

713
01:27:20,349 --> 01:27:24,670
[SPEAKER_00]: So the correct answer here is actually going to be hydrolysis.

714
01:27:31,017 --> 01:27:44,980
[SPEAKER_00]: And so hydrolysis is the process where water molecules are added to break down covalent bonds within macromolecules, like proteins, fats, carbohydrates, et cetera.

715
01:27:45,681 --> 01:27:51,722
[SPEAKER_00]: During hydrolysis, the addition of water splits the large molecule into smaller molecules.

716
01:27:51,782 --> 01:28:00,124
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, in digestion, enzymes break down food by adding water to split macromolecules, like breaking down

717
01:28:00,828 --> 01:28:04,770
[SPEAKER_00]: scarch, like breaking down starch into glucose.

718
01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:08,571
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about these other three answer choices.

719
01:28:09,392 --> 01:28:22,077
[SPEAKER_00]: Dehydration synthesis, which is also another word for condensation synthesis, which is of course one of our answer choices here, so both of them are the same, is the opposite of hydrolysis.

720
01:28:23,244 --> 01:28:34,591
[SPEAKER_00]: In dehydration synthesis, also known as condensation synthesis, two smaller molecules combine to form a larger molecule, and then water is then removed, not added.

721
01:28:35,091 --> 01:28:40,495
[SPEAKER_00]: So this happens, for example, when two anemo acids bond to form a protein, water is released.

722
01:28:41,315 --> 01:28:43,336
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, photosynthesis.

723
01:28:43,896 --> 01:28:46,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthesis really has nothing to do with it.

724
01:28:47,116 --> 01:28:55,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthesis, of course, is the process by which plants use light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.

725
01:28:56,359 --> 01:28:58,899
[SPEAKER_00]: So hydrolysis is the correct answer.

726
01:29:04,941 --> 01:29:10,562
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following liquids typically forms a convex meniscus when placed in a container?

727
01:29:11,514 --> 01:29:16,378
[SPEAKER_00]: water, mercury, salt water, or alcohol?

728
01:29:21,341 --> 01:29:23,583
[SPEAKER_00]: The correct answer here is mercury.

729
01:29:29,018 --> 01:29:47,812
[SPEAKER_00]: So mercury forms a convex meniscus when placed in a container because it has really strong cohesive forces, which basically an attraction between mercury molecules, and it has weak adhesive forces, attraction between mercury and then the container surface.

730
01:29:48,357 --> 01:29:56,681
[SPEAKER_00]: This causes the mercury to basically stick to itself more than to the sides of the container, which is where that curve happens up.

731
01:29:56,701 --> 01:30:00,003
[SPEAKER_00]: That's called the convex at all of the edges.

732
01:30:01,704 --> 01:30:07,326
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is something that you're going to see when you study scientific reasoning.

733
01:30:07,727 --> 01:30:12,689
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to learn the difference between a convex and a concave meniscus.

734
01:30:13,009 --> 01:30:14,590
[SPEAKER_00]: It may appear on your test.

735
01:30:16,628 --> 01:30:22,871
[SPEAKER_00]: Water, saltwater, and alcohol all act like one another when they're placed in a container.

736
01:30:22,891 --> 01:30:30,935
[SPEAKER_00]: They form what's called a concave meniscus, and that basically means that it curves down at the edges.

737
01:30:32,315 --> 01:30:42,360
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is that their adhesive forces with the container surface are stronger than their actual cohesive forces with themselves, with their molecules.

738
01:30:43,909 --> 01:30:56,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we answer the next set of practice questions, I want to give you a reminder that if you've got your T7 exam coming up in just a few weeks or in just a few months, that it's never too late to start studying with an online course.

739
01:30:56,456 --> 01:31:01,038
[SPEAKER_00]: The online course is intended for you to ditch the boring study guides and to study

740
01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:08,141
[SPEAKER_00]: using a very simple and easy to understand structured system that's guaranteed to help you pass.

741
01:31:08,762 --> 01:31:17,685
[SPEAKER_00]: This online course will give you everything that you need to know and to relearn so that you can feel confident not only on test day, but as you get ready to go into your program.

742
01:31:18,926 --> 01:31:21,667
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're ready to simplify studying for your T7 exam,

743
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:28,994
[SPEAKER_00]: and you don't wanna spend a bunch of money on test prep, know that the T7 online course has your back.

744
01:31:29,374 --> 01:31:33,096
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out at www.smartadditionacademy.com.

745
01:31:34,336 --> 01:31:39,379
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following best describes the primary reproductive mechanism of bacterial cells?

746
01:31:40,419 --> 01:31:45,522
[SPEAKER_00]: Binary fission, sexual reproduction, budding, or sperm formation.

747
01:31:45,982 --> 01:31:52,525
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great example of why it's important to not just focus on just memorizing definitions

748
01:31:53,390 --> 01:31:58,273
[SPEAKER_00]: and really having a good understanding of the content that you are studying.

749
01:31:58,493 --> 01:32:12,242
[SPEAKER_00]: This question is not only asking you about cellular reproduction, it's also asking you to pull in your knowledge of what you know about microorganisms, in this case, specifically bacteria.

750
01:32:13,808 --> 01:32:25,493
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to know a little bit about how bacteria works, knowing how to pull in information on how cellular reproduction work will allow you to answer this question correctly.

751
01:32:26,693 --> 01:32:31,355
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this question, the correct answer is actually A, binary fission.

752
01:32:36,485 --> 01:32:39,967
[SPEAKER_00]: So binary fission is the main way that bacteria reproduce.

753
01:32:40,408 --> 01:32:49,274
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens in binary fission is a bacterial cell copies its DNA, and then it splits in half, creating two identical cells.

754
01:32:49,734 --> 01:32:56,519
[SPEAKER_00]: This process is a type of asexual reproduction, meaning it does not involve combining DNA from two parents.

755
01:32:56,999 --> 01:33:00,862
[SPEAKER_00]: It is quick, and it allows for bacteria to multiply rapidly.

756
01:33:01,927 --> 01:33:12,290
[SPEAKER_00]: though sexual reproduction is not correct because it involves the combination of genetic material from two parents to create an offspring with a mix of both parents' DNA.

757
01:33:13,951 --> 01:33:18,812
[SPEAKER_00]: Budding is a type of asexual reproduction seen in organisms like yeast.

758
01:33:19,372 --> 01:33:24,594
[SPEAKER_00]: In budding, a new organism grows off the side of the parent and eventually separates.

759
01:33:26,155 --> 01:33:27,335
[SPEAKER_00]: In spore formation,

760
01:33:27,819 --> 01:33:38,217
[SPEAKER_00]: So spore formation is a survival mechanism some bacteria use in harsh conditions to protect themselves, but it's not a primary method of reproduction.

761
01:33:43,428 --> 01:33:56,396
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to studying microorganisms, you're gonna wanna make sure that you have a very good understanding of things like bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi, how do they move?

762
01:33:56,456 --> 01:33:57,737
[SPEAKER_00]: What are their characteristics?

763
01:33:57,777 --> 01:33:59,058
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some examples of them?

764
01:33:59,198 --> 01:34:02,340
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they reproduce and things like that?

765
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:04,241
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of diseases do they cause?

766
01:34:04,602 --> 01:34:08,064
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the following is an example of polygenic trait?

767
01:34:09,024 --> 01:34:10,005
[SPEAKER_00]: ABO blood type,

768
01:34:11,447 --> 01:34:19,232
[SPEAKER_00]: flower color in snapdragons, skin color in humans, or eye color in fruit flags?

769
01:34:27,918 --> 01:34:31,060
[SPEAKER_00]: So the correct answer is skin color in humans.

770
01:34:31,661 --> 01:34:41,167
[SPEAKER_00]: So polygenic trait, this basically means it is a trait that is influenced by multiple genes working together and skin color

771
01:34:42,817 --> 01:34:43,958
[SPEAKER_00]: a polygenic trait.

772
01:34:44,358 --> 01:34:52,284
[SPEAKER_00]: This combination of genes results in a range of possible skin colors rather than a simple one gene one trait outcome.

773
01:34:52,785 --> 01:34:59,850
[SPEAKER_00]: Because many genes contribute, polygenic traits like skin color show a wide variety of appearances.

774
01:35:01,411 --> 01:35:04,473
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the other three answer choices.

775
01:35:05,134 --> 01:35:05,534
[SPEAKER_00]: We have

776
01:35:06,722 --> 01:35:08,424
[SPEAKER_00]: ABO blood type.

777
01:35:08,744 --> 01:35:14,209
[SPEAKER_00]: The ABO blood type system is controlled by a single gene with multiple alleles.

778
01:35:14,509 --> 01:35:20,174
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of multiple alleles like we discussed earlier in this practice question.

779
01:35:21,255 --> 01:35:28,521
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower color and snapdragons are determined by a single gene that shows incomplete dominance.

780
01:35:29,061 --> 01:35:34,286
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, crossing a red flower plant with a white flower plant would produce pink flowers.

781
01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:38,575
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of incomplete dominance, not polygenic trait.

782
01:35:40,357 --> 01:35:47,586
[SPEAKER_00]: Eye color in fruit flies is also controlled by a single gene with a simple inheritance pattern, not multiple genes.

783
01:35:47,666 --> 01:35:49,849
[SPEAKER_00]: The cerebellum helps blank.

784
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:09,066
[SPEAKER_00]: The correct answer is B, coordinate body movements.

785
01:36:12,468 --> 01:36:17,591
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cerebellum is the part of the brain responsible for coordinating voluntary movements.

786
01:36:18,312 --> 01:36:21,754
[SPEAKER_00]: That's things like balance, posture, and fine motor skills.

787
01:36:22,354 --> 01:36:25,236
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps make movements smooth and accurate.

788
01:36:25,256 --> 01:36:32,280
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, the cerebellum allows us to walk straight or allows us to reach for objects without losing balance.

789
01:36:34,092 --> 01:36:47,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Body pressure regulation is managed by other systems, specifically the autonomic nervous system and parts of the brains, like the medulla, which help control heart rate and blood pressure.

790
01:36:49,521 --> 01:36:58,526
[SPEAKER_00]: Breathing mechanics are controlled by the brainstem, specifically, again, the medulla and the pons, which regulate respiratory rate and depth.

791
01:37:00,730 --> 01:37:13,002
[SPEAKER_00]: Language processing and the interpretation of sounds occurs in areas of the brain that are located in the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum is not involved with language interpretation.

792
01:37:15,624 --> 01:37:19,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Making coordinating body movements the correct answer.

793
01:37:23,110 --> 01:37:27,854
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, and then our last question is going to be an A and P question.

794
01:37:27,874 --> 01:37:33,738
[SPEAKER_00]: The B cells do not directly attack pathogens or infected cells.

795
01:37:33,979 --> 01:37:41,164
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, they mark the pathogens for destruction by macrophages and B cells.

796
01:37:41,624 --> 01:37:45,968
[SPEAKER_00]: They mark the antibodies for destruction by B cells and natural killer cells.

797
01:37:46,608 --> 01:37:51,112
[SPEAKER_00]: They mark the antibodies for destruction by macrophages and killer T cells.

798
01:37:51,468 --> 01:37:57,029
[SPEAKER_00]: They mark the pathogens for destruction by macrophages and natural killer cells.

799
01:37:59,010 --> 01:38:06,292
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and the correct answer is D, mark the pathogens for destruction by macrophages and natural killers.

800
01:38:06,532 --> 01:38:14,054
[SPEAKER_00]: So B cells produce antibodies, which are proteins that bind to specific pathogens like bacterias or viruses.

801
01:38:14,614 --> 01:38:19,755
[SPEAKER_00]: And by attaching to these pathogens, the antibodies mark them so that other immune cells

802
01:38:20,108 --> 01:38:29,927
[SPEAKER_00]: macrophages, which basically eat invaders, and natural killer cells, which help destroy infected or harmful cells, can recognize and destroy them.

803
01:38:30,503 --> 01:38:38,931
[SPEAKER_00]: The B cells don't directly attack, but they rather like tag or identify the pathogen so that the other cells can eliminate it.

804
01:38:39,472 --> 01:38:43,076
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a few reasons why the other answer choices are not correct.

805
01:38:43,196 --> 01:38:46,639
[SPEAKER_00]: So B cells, they do not destroy pathogens directly.

806
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:49,842
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, they just produce antibodies.

807
01:38:50,043 --> 01:38:54,287
[SPEAKER_00]: Macrophages are the ones that handle the actual destruction of the pathogens.

808
01:38:56,587 --> 01:39:02,282
[SPEAKER_00]: Antibodies are the markers that B cells produce and are not themselves marked for destruction.

809
01:39:02,402 --> 01:39:07,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, antibodies attach to pathogens, marking the pathogens for destruction.

810
01:39:07,856 --> 01:39:12,126
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and that wraps up our last question.

811
01:39:12,187 --> 01:39:17,019
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've stuck in with me throughout this entire video, this entire test, amazing job.
