1
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:08,368
And we're back with the Mustang Report.

2
00:00:09,949 --> 00:00:11,630
Before I go, I want to say one thing.

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:17,835
I get the opportunity to announce the graduation speaker for next year, for this year, actually, 2016.

4
00:00:17,955 --> 00:00:20,558
It was a very, very close vote.

5
00:00:21,398 --> 00:00:22,499
The difference was two votes.

6
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:23,980
I had to recount it three times.

7
00:00:25,522 --> 00:00:30,546
The graduation speaker for this year, I'd like him to come down here, is Mr. Michael Skorka.

8
00:01:19,563 --> 00:01:20,025
Ha ha ha!

9
00:02:15,462 --> 00:02:29,926
The money that you have donated today will go back to the children living in public schools and we appreciate it.

10
00:02:49,692 --> 00:03:19,093
Dashing through the snow In a one-horse open sleigh O'er the fields we go Laughing all the way The bells on bobtail ring They make our spirits bright What fun it is to ride And sing a sleighing song tonight Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh Jingle bells, jingle bells

11
00:03:22,743 --> 00:03:25,989
What fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh!

12
00:03:35,445 --> 00:03:43,991
A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride, And soon Miss Fanny Bright was seated by my side.

13
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:52,697
The horse was lean and lank, Miss Fortune seemed his lot, He got into a drifted bank and wee-wee got upside.

14
00:03:53,557 --> 00:03:57,440
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.

15
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,203
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh.

16
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:06,366
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.

17
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:10,669
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh.

18
00:04:21,368 --> 00:04:24,929
It's the most wonderful time of the year

19
00:04:45,178 --> 00:05:04,158
With the kids jingle-belling and everyone telling you be of good cheer It's the most wonderful time of the year It's the hap-happiest season of all

20
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:20,082
With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings when friends come to call, it's the happiest season of all.

21
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:27,168
There'll be parties for hosting, marshmallows for toasting, and caroling out in the snow.

22
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:32,813
There'll be scary ghost stories and tales of the glories of Christmas as well.

23
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:42,354
It's the most wonderful time of the year.

24
00:05:43,455 --> 00:05:44,917
There'll be much to see.

25
00:05:44,937 --> 00:05:44,917
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

26
00:06:07,471 --> 00:06:08,632
Seniors!

27
00:06:08,692 --> 00:06:09,572
Whoa, right here!

28
00:06:09,872 --> 00:06:12,554
Oh my god, we're like totals!

29
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,661
on the left and you have down the right.

30
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:28,201
No, running.

31
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,923
They're trying to get open.

32
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,724
Okay, so I'll look for that.

33
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:32,584
So what about like blocking?

34
00:06:32,644 --> 00:06:33,225
I'm blocking.

35
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:37,327
Okay, so you guys got to be like a tight link because they're coming right in the camera.

36
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:16,412
Oh say can you see, by the dawn's early light, what so proudly.

37
00:07:45,224 --> 00:07:45,665
1, 2, 3, Green Team!

38
00:07:45,685 --> 00:07:46,506
That makes sense to me.

39
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,427
I think it's going really well, much better than last year.

40
00:08:11,687 --> 00:08:12,868
So I think we have him already.

41
00:08:13,128 --> 00:08:13,688
Game's over.

42
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:14,629
Game's over.

43
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:15,609
Good luck, Mr. Murdoch.

44
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:38,749
That's a nice crowd.

45
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:39,809
Worth every penny.

46
00:08:39,949 --> 00:08:40,749
Worth every penny.

47
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:55,855
Hey, watch the D now.

48
00:08:56,115 --> 00:08:56,635
Watch the D.

49
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:26,204
Yeah!

50
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:18,043
I think both sides did their homework on each other.

51
00:10:18,063 --> 00:10:20,664
They prepared defensively.

52
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:43,341
Right now it's pretty tough to move the ball down the field on either side, so it seems like it's whoever has the ball last may win the game.

53
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:43,802
We'll see.

54
00:10:57,606 --> 00:10:58,427
A little sore.

55
00:10:58,447 --> 00:11:01,668
I think the last time I played flag football was about 40 years ago.

56
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,550
Right back, right back, right back, right back.

57
00:11:11,111 --> 00:11:37,477
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

58
00:11:41,072 --> 00:11:42,158
Up, up, up, up!

59
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:42,843
Yeah!

60
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:53,130
How are you?

61
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:58,074
I'm here with Jackie Dempsey at the second annual Air Force 95 football game.

62
00:11:58,174 --> 00:12:03,337
And Jackie Dempsey just got the second touchdown, I was going to say home run, for the great team.

63
00:12:03,677 --> 00:12:04,198
How do you feel?

64
00:12:05,138 --> 00:12:06,179
You know, I'm pretty excited.

65
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:09,922
We've got this amazing quarterback, stellar defense.

66
00:12:09,942 --> 00:12:11,643
Go Jackie!

67
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,440
I got it!

68
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,661
I got it!

69
00:12:31,681 --> 00:12:34,022
I got it!

70
00:12:34,082 --> 00:12:39,143
I got it!

71
00:12:40,484 --> 00:12:41,985
I got it!

72
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:42,685
I got it!

73
00:13:12,086 --> 00:13:13,628
Oh, you are good.

74
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:34,071
So Mr. Michels, this is your first flag football game, faculty flag football game, how are you feeling?

75
00:13:34,531 --> 00:13:38,972
Pretty tired right now, I'm not going to lie to you, I'm in bad shape, but it's a pretty fun experience, it's awesome.

76
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,313
How did it feel when you got that first touchdown for your team?

77
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:47,474
I was nervous I was going to drop it, I was wide open, but luckily I caught it, it felt pretty good to get on the board.

78
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,495
Well hopefully you get some more, and good luck tonight.

79
00:13:49,575 --> 00:13:50,635
Thank you very much, thank you.

80
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,301
The teams are just so good that there's no winner.

81
00:14:20,518 --> 00:14:33,515
is the day when we will do battle with them, where the Mustangs will show their Mustang pride, their Mustang spirit, where they will dig a little deeper to make sure that they come out victorious against all odds!

82
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:40,223
There'll be scary ghost stories and tales of the glories of Christmases long, long ago
