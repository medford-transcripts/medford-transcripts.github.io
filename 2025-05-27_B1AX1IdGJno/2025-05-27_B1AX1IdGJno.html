    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1618.455s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1619.616s">Councilor</a>  Tseng and then Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1622.016s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1623.496s">I</a>  wanted to thank Councilor Leming for putting this on the agenda and to thank him for his really meaningful words yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1632.699s">It's</a>  important that our residents see ourselves reflected in the things that we celebrate as a city and the things that we recognize as a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1643.701s">So</a>  many Medford residents have given their lives and, you know, even put their lives on the line for our country, for the ideals that we hold together, for freedom, for justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1659.074s">for</a>  life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and these really, I think, unifying values that, as a country, I think we need to take a deep look at and embrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1673.482s">And</a>  as our veteran service director said yesterday in her wonderful remarks at the ceremony too, <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1683.055s">it's</a>  time to remember those who gave their life for their conscience, for serving a country with those ideals. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1692.843s">And</a>  I found that very meaningful. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1694.545s">So</a>  I wanted to thank, again, thank you, Councilor Leming for putting this on the agenda and thank our Veteran Services Department for all they do day in, day out for residents.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1708.976s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1711.854s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1713.977s">I</a>  also wanted to thank Councilor, Leming for bringing this up and for speaking yesterday I was traveling this weekend so I couldn't attend the ceremony but I'm glad there's an opportunity to commemorate Memorial Day at this meeting, I was actually spending the weekend with an active duty. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1730.716s">member</a>  of the military, she's in the army. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1733.979s">She</a>  had a really tough childhood and is now an infectious disease PhD, serving in the army and protecting our country right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1746.272s">Something</a>  Councilor Leming and I talked about this weekend was that the military <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1754.686s">in</a>  the United States provides a lot of people with some things you wouldn't necessarily expect, which is economic mobility and a pathway to improve your station in a way that is still challenging for a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1770.478s">And</a>  that is something that it provided for my grandfather when he served in World War II. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1776.943s">And</a>  then because of the GI Bill, he was able to buy a triple-decker in Worcester and raise a family there. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1786.208s">Even</a>  though he was a mailman for the rest of his life. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1790.433s">So</a>  he was a really a government worker, all the whole time. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1795.258s">But</a>  nobody in my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1798.635s">was</a>  killed in action. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1801.297s">But</a>  when I first met my husband, we've been married for 15 years, this was quite a while ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1806.461s">He,</a>  one of his friends from college, they were orientation leaders together and he was in the ROTC and immediately joined the military and was deployed to Afghanistan. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1820.151s">And</a>  like a couple of weeks after I met my husband, he went to this kid, this child, he was like 24, he was killed in Afghanistan. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1828.577s">and</a>  he was at his funeral. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1831.339s">And</a>  we talk about him a lot, especially around Memorial Day and how hard that must have been for his family, but how dedicated he was to serving his country. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1844.13s">And</a>  I think it's really important that we continue to remember him and remember the sacrifices that are made and what the sacrifices are made for. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1858.112s">And</a>  I really appreciate Councilor Leming bringing this forward and reminding us. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1863.136s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1866.119s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1869.008s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears Thank you, Councilor Leming for bringing this forward and thank you for representing the city council at the Memorial Day event. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1876.873s">Yesterday,</a>  I'm very grateful for holidays on the calendars like these which give us a reason to collectively, remember and celebrate the veterans in our lives and remember those who have passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1891.842s">I</a>  think it's evident most people have. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1897.185s">You</a>  know, some people have military experience they are themselves veterans most people have a veteran in their family or amongst their circle of loved ones, and it strikes me that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1908.903s">It's</a>  so important to have these opportunities to collectively reflect on what that means and to be prompted to think about what remembering means when we're remembering people that we love who have passed away because they're members of the armed forces. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1923.693s">Or</a>  just to try to reflect on what that means for those people who do have a veteran experience, something that we should do, not just once a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1930.678s">but</a>  all the time as veterans can't help but do. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1932.799s">For</a>  myself, my two grandfathers both served in World War II, and I know they had experiences so traumatic that they never spoke about them for the rest of their lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1939.2s">I</a>  think about that so often. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1941.061s">I</a>  think that Memorial Day is an important reminder of what we owe to veterans and people who have sacrificed for various reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1950.843s">What</a>  they continue to sacrifice and the lived experiences and memories that they don't reflect on once a year, they reflect on all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1957.604s">And</a>  I'm grateful to be in a city where we think about what that means <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1960.545s">for</a>  us for the other 364 days of the year, and how we can uplift life in our community for people who come from that background and people who have served and sacrificed in every ways, and especially in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1978.448s">most</a>  total way. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1979.289s">So</a>  thank you for putting this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1981.95s">I</a>  am glad that we as a community are observing Memorial Day on the day I'm glad that we talked about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1986.172s">The</a>  Tuesday after, I'm really grateful to have a veteran services director who is doing such ambitious work on behalf of veterans in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=1994.097s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2486.211s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears and city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2489.752s">Before</a>  I begin, I just want to let you know Councilor Leming and got an email today about how wonderful your remarks were yesterday so I figured I'd let you know that publicly. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2499.814s">And</a>  thank you for all the team. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2502.135s">Good</a>  evening and thank you President Bears and Councilors for allowing me some time to speak to you about the fiscal year 26 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2509.736s">Also,</a>  thank you for meeting with each department over the last several weeks to review each budget individually. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2516.923s">Before</a>  I begin, I must take this opportunity to thank everybody who contributed to completing this budget and delivering it to your honorable body by the newly established deadline per the budget ordinance that you established. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2530.572s">Compiling</a>  this comprehensive breakdown of the city's financial outlook took countless hours of preparation, debate, and insight from our department heads and our budget team, led by finance director Bob Dickinson, our former assistant finance director and budget director Courtney Cordello, and my team in the mayor's office, led by Chief of Staff Nina Nazarian, who is here with me tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2553.238s">I</a>  also want to give credit to our Communications Director Steve Smearty and Communications Specialist Emma Tombley for putting in so many hours of work on the nitty gritty aspects of the budget book that tend to get overlooked. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2565.608s">Their</a>  work is invaluable, and will hopefully lead us to a third Distinguished Budget Award from the Government Finance Officers Association, after having received the award again last year for our fiscal year 25 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2579.159s">It's</a>  a recognition we all, including this Council, I'm sure are extremely proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2584.792s">Though</a>  sadly, this is the last budget that Courtney works on with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2587.833s">She</a>  is moving on to another position, but was gracious enough to stay on on a limited basis to assist with completing the compilation of this budget and allow time for our new assistance finance director to get acclimated to the role. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2602.476s">Thank</a>  you, Courtney, for all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2604.017s">You</a>  will be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2606.918s">We</a>  enter fiscal year 26 in a somewhat familiar yet also much more secure position than previous budget cycles. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2615.623s">Due</a>  to years of sound fiscal management coupled with newly injected revenue from the successful override votes last November, we're able to maintain our levels of service across our departments and also make targeted investments in key areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2630.695s">That's</a>  not to say compiling and navigating this budget has been easy or without its hard decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2636.357s">It</a>  only means that for the first time in a while, we are not in need of right-sizing the budget with federal dollars or cash reserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2644.199s">This</a>  is partially due to the support the community has shown for the two ballot questions voted on this past fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2651.482s">Despite</a>  our community approving two proposed Proposition 2.5 ballot questions last fall, <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2658.89s">I</a>  want to make clear that we are not managing our finances as though we suddenly have a windfall and can spend as freely as some of our more affluent neighboring cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2668.635s">Instead,</a>  we are still bound by our tax revenue and are making targeted investments that will have the most long-term impact without over leveraging our operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2678.899s">One</a>  key investment is in our engineering department, which is carrying an extremely high workload, with infrastructure maintenance increasing by roughly 400%. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2689.723s">To</a>  help alleviate this burden, we had to have to hire a new position to the team that will assist with managing capital improvement projects on and under our streets and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2700.905s">This</a>  is just the beginning of a multi-year plan to decrease the backlog of much needed upgrades throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2707.626s">The</a>  upgrades will consist of water main upgrades in low pressure areas, street and sidewalk work, lead line removals in our environmental justice designated areas, <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2718.147s">removal</a>  of sewer inflow and infiltration and localized drainage improvement in flood prone areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2724.411s">There's</a>  hundreds of millions of dollars worth of work needed, so it is imperative we have a staff to manage it all next year in the years to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2732.395s">Our</a>  streets are highly traveled both by cars and pedestrians, which is why improving safety measures for all modes of transportation is also extremely important. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2742.363s">In</a>  collaboration with MassDOT, we've advanced plans to reconstruct high crash intersections along Main Street, specifically where it intersects with South Street, Mystic Valley Parkway, Route 16 ramps, and Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2756.31s">This</a>  project will reduce vehicle speeds while also improving ADA-compliant sidewalks and curb ramps, and add separate and buffered bike lanes, all in an effort to enhance accessibility and deliver a safer travel experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2773.463s">In</a>  addition to the work done on the city side, the fiscal year 26 budget reflects a strategic investment in education is funding focuses on maintaining staffing levels and evaluating needs across the backdrop of an extension to the instructional day. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2789.182s">Additionally,</a>  we're addressing critical infrastructure needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2792.917s">With</a>  the city council support the school committee has advanced repairs for the Andrews and McGlynn schools, targeting malfunctioning HVAC systems, as well as security and it upgrades throughout our entire district. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2805.464s">These</a>  efforts are part of a broader initiative to ensure safe and conducive learning environments for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2812.962s">The</a>  school budget is almost always the most difficult one to develop, as there are several critical needs throughout our educational system, like the ones I just mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2821.988s">But</a>  there are also significant challenges like the rise in costs that require not only hard decisions but comprehensive financial planning by both the school administration, city council, school committee and city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2835.662s">The</a>  Medford public school fiscal year 26 budget reflects a significant increase over of over $9.5 million supported by state aid, equating to an over 12.6% rise compared to fiscal year 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2850.265s">This</a>  increase is primarily driven by heightened expenses and special education, particularly in transportation and tuition, which have substantial rate hikes. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2859.891s">The</a>  district anticipates a $557,000 increase to transportation costs due to a new special education transportation contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2869.42s">Both</a>  the schools in the city are also facing a significant rise in operational expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2874.98s">Healthcare</a>  costs for city employees are projected to increase by 10% again this year, potentially consuming revenue from new growth of approximately $2.5 million and forcing us to reevaluate investments in programming and services. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2892.21s">This</a>  is not unique to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2894.011s">Healthcare</a>  costs are rising across the country, but it certainly is a challenge that we must overcome in the upcoming fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2901.758s">Despite</a>  budget constraints, we are still making incredible progress across so many areas that are driving our growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2909.047s">We</a>  are making significant investment in several core city systems, maintaining as much service as possible and providing a sustainable roadmap for future big ticket expenditures like a new Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2923.543s">We're</a>  continuing to make more substantial investments in our library and increasing its budget by nearly 5% with the support of state aid. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2932.571s">Our</a>  continued commitment to prioritizing the needs of our library has allowed everyone in our community to gain more access to the resources and programs that our fabulous library offers. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2944.964s">As</a>  I said, the workload at the fleet, the feet of our team in the engineering department is immense. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2951.367s">And</a>  that undoubtedly overlaps with the work being done by our staff in the Department of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2957.378s">We're</a>  increasing the DPW's budget by nearly $1.2 million, which will help keep up with increased costs and services, as well as give us more flexibility as we continue to address stump removal, tree pruning and repair, as well as updates to our aging water infrastructure and improvements in accessibility and pedestrian mobility in our squares and green spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2980.84s">In</a>  addition to investing in our public infrastructure, we're also been working to enhance and upgrade many of our public spaces for the community to utilize and enjoy. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2990.625s">Gillis</a>  Park is one of many that opened last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2994.327s">Carr</a>  Park phase two renovation is being worked on with the dog park already open for the public to enjoy. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=2999.97s">We're</a>  wrapping up a project at Morrison Park to upgrade the fencing and dugouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3005.332s">Logan</a>  Park is getting a facelift with a new pathway, natural play area and a tree sculpture. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3011.654s">I</a>  thank the team in our Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability, along with the staff at Medford Recreation for working so diligently on all these projects and many more. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3022.302s">With</a>  so many wonderful upgrades to our public spaces, it's important that we ensure our team and recreation are properly equipped and staffed appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3032.25s">To</a>  ensure this, we are adding a part-time office manager to offset some of the duties from our full-time staff to allow them to focus on expanding our programming <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3041.81s">including</a>  our inclusive programming and developing more accessible youth and young adult activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3048.815s">This</a>  past year, we also unveiled our newly universal accessible schoolyard at the McGlynn School. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3055.64s">The</a>  playground goes above Federal American with Disabilities Act accessibility standards and was designed and built with input from stakeholders well-versed in accessibility play structures. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3066.758s">We're</a>  continuing to work towards goals laid out in our Climate Action and Adaptation Plan and are committed to making sustainable practices more accessible for our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3076.806s">To</a>  add to this endeavor, we have partnered with Garbage to Garden to launch a free municipal curbside composting program for eligible residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3085.594s">Now,</a>  nearly a year into the launch, the program is widely accessible and convenient, making it easy for residents to participate in creating a greener, more sustainable future. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3095.908s">To</a>  date we have nearly 6700 active participants enrolled and are well positioned to hit our goal of 10,000 signups by the end of fiscal year 26. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3105.451s">I'm</a>  grateful to our team in the Office of Prevention and Outreach and the Board of Health for once again receiving a municipal vulnerability preparedness grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3117.018s">of</a>  $750,000 to fund our exemplary Medford Connects program. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3122.68s">This</a>  program was designed to help connect our most vulnerable residents to essential city resources and funds a wide variety of programs and events throughout the city, including our amazing multilingual and multicultural community engagement team. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3137.365s">Our</a>  MVP project has been such a success that is the model that the state uses for other cities to repeat. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3146.31s">Building</a>  off the work and guidance of our MedFedConnects team, our nearly $1 million grant from the federal government to transform the Hagener Center into a municipal vulnerability preparedness site, as well as a facility for after school programming, is moving forward full steam ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3161.695s">Our</a>  team is compiling the materials needed to submit to HUD and working with Congresswoman Clark's office to ensure this project is completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3170.205s">While</a>  emergency preparedness is an essential sector of our work and prevention and outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3174.93s">There</a>  are many in our community who need resources and mental health supports right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3180.095s">That's</a>  where a social worker and recovery team comes in and works in tandem with our connectors and liaisons to direct those in need with resources and programs that can get them the assistance they need to thrive. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3192.807s">Our</a>  electrify Medford program is up and running making gains throughout the community strengthening support specifically for underrepresented and underserved residents interested in decarbonizing their homes and vehicles through energy efficiency, solar and electrification of heating, water heating appliances and electric vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3212.178s">The</a>  team has been out walking the streets to raise awareness for the program is in set in setting up coaching sessions to help people navigate their heating and cooling needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3221.962s">As</a>  part of our commitment to residents we are always looking for ways to expand diversity equity inclusion throughout our city and create an environment of belonging for the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3232.075s">DEI</a>  has been working with human resources to update best practices for recruiting, interviewing, and hiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3238.918s">Due</a>  to this work, the city has been able to recruit, hire, and retain highly qualified, diverse candidates for a variety of city positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3247.642s">This</a>  team also hosts trainings and other professional development opportunities to ensure employees have the tools they need to uphold our values and mission, something that will be enhanced and continued through fiscal year 26. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3260.577s">Our</a>  DEI office has also made a concerted effort to equip many events with ASL interpreters, enabling those in our community who use sign language to better engage with city services and programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3273.78s">On</a>  the development side, our plan to revitalize and activate Medford Square near Clippership Drive has taken a major step forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3281.631s">We</a>  have selected development company transcom real estate as a partner in the city's project to transform three underdeveloped undeveloped city on lots behind city hall into a combination of mixed use retail and residential with ample parking for our seniors and Chevalier theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3299.954s">The</a>  project as proposed will combine the creation of market rate and affordable housing anchored with a 13,500 square foot grocery store, all in the context of a village square environment that prioritizes the pedestrian experience with beautiful public art and landscaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3317.444s">This</a>  proposal dynamically addresses the city's multifaceted objectives outlined in the RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3325.155s">creating</a>  a vibrant new community hub in Medford Square that is consistent with the objectives in the city's comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3332.201s">We</a>  will make further adjustments and improvements to this proposal, as well as negotiate a final land lease agreement over the next several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3340.348s">And</a>  the final agreement will be presented to the city council for consideration and approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3345.673s">With</a>  the activation of the square underway, the next logical step is to expand our pedestrian paths along the Mystic River waterfront. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3353.212s">The</a>  Clipper Ship Connector is opening this summer, according to the Department of Conservation and Recreation, and will create a path that connects over 10 miles of continuous greenways along the waterfront. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3364.285s">In</a>  2025, we continue to embrace public art as a means to enrich our community spaces, foster local identity, and engage residents across generations. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3373.97s">A</a>  series of mural projects and public art initiatives have been launched throughout the city, reflecting Medford's commitment to creativity, inclusivity, and civic pride. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3383.194s">In</a>  the past year, we've also seen our art scene flourish with over 2,500 cultural events, more than double the amount six years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3393.718s">In</a>  fiscal year 25 we saw the opening of one of the most anticipated restaurants and event spaces, with the unveiling of the great American beer hall, the 17,000 square foot space is already a destination for our region, and is has contributed heavily to expanding our commercial tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3411.565s">While</a>  focusing on our commercial development is critically important to both our growth and expanding our tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3417.232s">We</a>  are also deeply, deeply focusing on working to help solve the housing crisis that is afflicting, not just Medford but the greater Boston region, the Commonwealth in the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3428.002s">We</a>  are actively addressing housing affordability, along with the council's help through a multifaceted strategy that combines funding mechanisms, the city council zoning reforms and development initiatives to expand access to affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3444.185s">Through</a>  successful negotiation, we gain leverage with our 40 B developers to bring more community benefits to the planning process, like better pedestrian accessibility, reduction of potential traffic congestion, more open space, more access to public transportation, and more affordable housing units with a priority for Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3464.641s">We're</a>  making a concerted effort to care for and support our sizable veteran population through a number of comprehensive programs and projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3473.908s">As</a>  we all know, housing is at a premium and especially challenging to afford for our veterans, many of whom rely on financial assistance from a host of government agencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3484.177s">That's</a>  why I'm proud of the work being done by the City Council, the Veterans Service Office, and for the successful passage of the Landlord Incentive Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3495.906s">This</a>  initiative offers landlords up to $750 annually for renting to qualified Medford veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3503.439s">Administered</a>  in collaboration with the nonprofit housing families, the program seeks to reduce barriers veterans face in securing housing, such as credit challenges or income discrimination. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3514.87s">By</a>  encouraging landlords to provide stable housing options, it's our hope that we're able to facilitate successful reintegration of veterans into civilian life in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3526.541s">And</a>  as I'm sure you all know, this was a brief overview, I will stop soon, of all the work we all have done over the past year and the investments we've made that will help build on the vision we share and the work that we'll continue to do into fiscal year 26. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3542.552s">Everything</a>  we do, of course, is not linked to one department or a handful of staff, but felt across our entire workforce and undoubtedly linked to all the work you do here in the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3554.148s">Our</a>  city is at its best when we collaborate and lean on one another for insight advice and constructive criticism. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3560.729s">I'm</a>  proud of everything we've accomplished together and I look forward to our continued partnership and teamwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3566.63s">Thank</a>  you for allowing me the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3568.511s">I</a>  know I'm always lengthy but thank you for allowing me the time and I'm here to Nina Nazarian chief of staff and I are here to answer any questions you may have of myself.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3579.212s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor, do we have questions for the mayor on the budget submission. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3587.612s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3590.714s">This</a>  is something that, full disclosure, I already brought up to Nina before the meeting, but we have been working with a number of parents on this exact issue, so I would like to have some public discussion on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3605.744s">I'll</a>  also acknowledge that I was absent from the meeting that <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3613.387s">this</a>  council had with Kevin Bailey. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3615.668s">But</a>  so I do very much appreciate the addition of the office manager position part-time for 20, I believe 27,500 to the Medford rec department. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3630.073s">The</a>  concern I had, especially working with the parents who really do want to see, who really do want to see afterschool programs for their kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3640.777s">And</a>  I'd also like to <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3642.618s">Thank</a>  Councilor Scarpelli as well for his, for his work on on this is that we, the, the impression I got was that an additional full time therapeutic recreation specialist would really help out. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3659.783s">in</a>  actually making these programs a reality just in the sense that they did need that is my impression that Kevin really did need more staffing in order to do that with the ambition being that it would that they would end up founding a more regional program and collaboration with. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3676.952s">Malden</a>  and Somerville as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3678.933s">And</a>  my fear is that although the office manager is a big addition because it takes a lot of work off of Kevin's hands that they might need more staffing to make that a reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3690.895s">So</a>  I'd appreciate any conversation about that as well as just future plans for how those parents could be served in the future.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3702.3s">Sure,</a>  sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3702.94s">Thank</a>  you for the question console let me thank you all for advocating for additional staffing and recreation I know the city school committee is also working on enhancements in the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3716.391s">And</a>  I think we're definitely glad the parents did come speak to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3721.476s">I</a>  was lucky to be joined by Councilor Scarpelli and Chief of Staff Nina Nazarian with a few parents last week to for me to better understand the needs, because I saw it as more need for more teen program. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3737.51s">inclusive</a>  programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3738.93s">And</a>  then I also see it as the age range that is aging out of high school so you know that 2122 to 25 year olds that also need support and inclusive programming so what we are doing is adding the office, we're doing a few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3754.793s">First,</a>  I think Somerville Malden and Medford for working together you see these collaborations throughout the state and they do work. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3763.195s">So</a>  Medford I know Kevin is big with aquatics Danny has his specialties. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3768.697s">And</a>  so being able to work with Medford Somerville and Malden, we should be able to have a full range of offerings for our young adults 13 through 25 plus. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3780.965s">We</a>  also are implementing that part time office managers to free up the three full time staff we do have that actually create and administer the programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3790.967s">And</a>  I think that will alleviate a lot of the nitty gritty work that is done on the computer, hours and hours a day, so that they can offer and create ways to create more programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3802.65s">I'm</a>  also hearing from the parents like yourselves that they do hope that, and I didn't really hear it till last week, I thought it was more REC, but I think they're looking for somebody in the city to kind of oversee all inclusive programming, like find out what's going on in the library, what's going on in REC, what's going on at our senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3821.88s">So</a>  there's one central person that's kind of overseeing it and make sure we're offering needs from zero to our seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3831.666s">So</a>  what we have, what I'm going to do is I sent an email to a whole list of staff members, our DEI office, our connectors program, we do have a connector, her name's June. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3845.394s">She's</a>  a connector for our seniors and persons with disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3849.496s">So</a>  I'm going to kind of bring that team together and try to make sure that somebody takes the lead and whether it's June or somebody in DEI, <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3857.101s">just</a>  to make sure we have some oversight over every department and make sure we're offering as much as we possibly can along with the partnership with Malden and Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3867.343s">So</a>  I think we do have some staffing that we can tap into, some monthly coordinated meetings that aren't happening now between departments, and we can make sure we're accomplishing those goals for the parents that have reached out to all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3881.146s">So</a>  yes, I mean, you see the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3884.627s">We're</a>  taking in a few, <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3886.729s">remaining</a>  positions in different ways, like 10% here or there for different positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3891.685s">in</a>  planning, but our budget we were able to increase by 1.5 plus the new library position that we're using, you know, work conveniently with Barbara and do a new children's librarian, but there really isn't room in the budget to add five, 10, 15 positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3909.656s">So</a>  we're do our best to listen to all department heads, figure out what the needs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3913.939s">And</a>  I think we're gonna make great progress with that additional 0.5 and the current city staff and the partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3920.703s">for</a>  all of our residents that need more inclusive programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3925.552s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3926.815s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3930.725s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3931.406s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3931.906s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3932.286s">Really</a>  appreciate your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3933.928s">And</a>  just want to thank you and your staff, Chief of Staff Nazarian, Finance Director Bob Dickinson, and everybody else who I know worked really hard to put this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3944.417s">And</a>  thank you for the ongoing collaboration with the budget ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3949.302s">It</a>  is really great to get a budget proposal with a really comfortable amount of time to continue to absorb and digest and discuss <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3957.128s">everything</a>  that goes along with it so that's been a really wonderful evolution to get to participate in over the past few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3963.59s">Thank</a>  you very much for your partnership on that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3968.352s">Thank</a>  you for creating the budget ordinance I think it's given us a tie like almost a timeline so it's helped us collaborate but it's also been helpful on our side to really come a long way.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3978.015s">We</a>  have.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3984.449s">Yeah,</a>  I think it helps all of us when we have a structure that we can mutually rely on and predict. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3993.794s">And</a>  I think that's a great example of the collaboration that you were talking about in your closing remarks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=3997.515s">I</a>  think residents love good TV, but I think residents love more to see different branches of government collaborating. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4005.199s">Good</a>  things happen we collaborate, even when it's hard it's so much better than we do when we do think the creation of the stabilization funds last year and the passage of question seven and eight are just wonderful evidence of that and it's great to see those bearing fruit in this year's budget proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4022.175s">In</a>  regards to the budget proposal that you've introduced us to tonight I think we're off to a really good start. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4028.138s">This</a>  is an operating budget that does not significant really sorry significantly rely on one time funding, which, you know, we've all been through the past few fiscal years together. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4038.962s">And</a>  that is a really refreshing thing to respond to. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4042.065s">That's</a>  a product of a lot of hard work by a lot of people in City Hall on your team and a lot of people on this council, and the hard work of everybody who campaigned for the overrides and the willingness of the majority of Medford voters to say yes to investing in our schools and our shared infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4059.12s">The</a>  passage of questions seven and eight directly allowed us to fund new positions within the DPW and to balance the school's budget, meaning that we do not have to balance this on forced district-wide personnel cuts, which I'm gonna say a couple of times this evening, because I'm just so happy about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4072.028s">It's</a>  really great. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4073.048s">And</a>  we have a little bit further to go on the school's budget, as we know from the presentation earlier, but it's great to see that number become more and more approachable. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4083.234s">For</a>  me, as we collaboratively put ARPA and ESSER further and further into the rear view, <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4088.797s">I</a>  think all of us we want to see Medford operate sustainably we want to see it emerge from austerity bunch budgeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4094.223s">We</a>  want to fund our infrastructure and our services the way that residents deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4098.588s">We</a>  want to begin to make bolder and bolder strides on our capital needs and sustainably add capacity to our operating budgets at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4107.297s">So</a>  given the hard work and the very genuine <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4109.96s">progress</a>  that we have made on stabilizing the operating budget in the last fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4115.667s">I</a>  think that now is a really important opportunity to emphasize the capital investments side. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4120.973s">In</a>  the past several years we have seen the city's free cash reserves amass and we've done great work together in allocating that in really intentional specific ways into our various stabilization funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4132.166s">I</a>  think that now is the time to go even further and we've talked about this we talked about this collaboratively with the financial task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4138.133s">And</a>  I think that a really exciting and really important accompaniment to the passage of the fiscal 26 budget proposal this year will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4150.587s">a</a>  specific plan for allocating much of the remainder of our free cash reserves into our various stabilization accounts of which we have several, due to the passage of a couple more that we collaborated on last year for myself as one Councilor won't speak for other Councilors even though I know a lot of us feel the same way it is a really happy occasion to get to translate that <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4172.585s">ever</a>  annoying and confusing term free cash into being able to say, we are investing this amount of money in this fund because we use it for this purpose and be able to speak to the questions and the concerns that residents bring to all of us around and say, we know <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4190.093s">We</a>  hear you, it's been in the capital improvement plan and we are making this allocation for that purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4195.32s">I</a>  know this is something that you and your team and working hard on curious if you could speak a little bit more to how that is shaping up the timeline of that submissions that we can make sure these two things go hand in hand this year.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4204.231s">Sure,</a>  sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4204.812s">Yeah,</a>  we actually have a big whiteboard on the probably <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4210.81s">25</a>  to 30 papers we have to get before you in June between your two meetings, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4217.394s">But</a>  some of those papers are capital expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4220.675s">I</a>  think there's a project or two for the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4223.137s">I</a>  know there's the nexus study that the councils in the Affordable Housing Trust has been asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4229.32s">So</a>  we're going to put that paper before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4231.401s">We're</a>  also going to replenish the stabilization accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4237.424s">And</a>  I think what we'll end up seeing left on this, I'd like to call it a reserve fund, a rainy day emergency fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4247.229s">We'll</a>  probably have about 10 to 12 left. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4249.41s">So</a>  we will have a full updated pre-cash plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4253.773s">My</a>  office did one right around the October timeframe, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4258.215s">We'll</a>  have an updated chart for you along with all these papers before you in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4264.638s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4265.178s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4265.739s">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4268.7s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4270.342s">And</a>  we can talk about which ones are for the 10th and which ones are for the 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4274.045s">So,</a>  yes, we don't make you do them all in two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4277.609s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro and then Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4280.351s">My</a>  comment is a similar one. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4282.774s">I</a>  just wanted to, again, thank you for the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4288.6s">Big,</a>  beautiful budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4291.887s">I'm</a>  feeling a little loopy already. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4293.107s">It's</a>  not even that late. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4295.988s">I</a>  think it was the music. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4297.028s">It</a>  was just really nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4298.968s">The</a>  thing that I was really prioritizing when coming into this was public safety and hoping that we could allow the fire department after kind of a wonky sort of community relations moment to <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4321.782s">give</a>  a boost that would make everybody in the community, everybody in the fire department feel like we were reconnecting, we were moving forward in a way that was allowing the fire department to feel like they were able to be like really a cohesive, high morale, you know, a department with a leader that's really forward thinking and clear eyed about <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4350.975s">what</a>  needs to improve and how to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4355.32s">And</a>  sort of a first step in that direction was something that I talked with the chief about, which was the dive team. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4361.146s">You</a>  and I talked about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4362.287s">It's</a>  not in the budget, but I wanted to give you the opportunity to sort of talk about where there are <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4367.652s">avenues</a>  that we could, you know, access funds to pay for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4371.855s">And</a>  there's an estimate that the chief has that is that the dive team would cost about $120,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4379.381s">It's</a>  not entirely one time, but it really like, you know, it pays for dry suits, it pays for training. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4386.145s">There</a>  are a few people that have started training on their own fully, like, you know, like started it with self funded because there was an incident in Medford, where <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4395.752s">a</a>  young man drowned and they couldn't, you know, we didn't have folks in our fighter department that had training, we didn't have the suits, we didn't have the boats, we didn't have like any of the equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4407.359s">And</a>  then after that, because we had to call in teams from that city, after that, a few people took it upon themselves to start, you know, a training program. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4417.545s">So</a>  this estimate was for concluding the training, having a 12 person team, so that <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4424.19s">There</a>  would always be three people on rotation available at all times in a fire in like on staff, so it wouldn't be over time, it would just be always three people available to do to be on call and. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4442.067s">the</a>  equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4443.528s">So</a>  $120,000, kind of one time, but it would be, you know, I think it's like 10 years down the line, you have to renew the suits, but it feels to me like that is something closer to one time than something that is in an operating budget on an ongoing basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4456.616s">But</a>  I just wanted to, like, ask you what you think would be a way to access funds for something like that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4463.32s">Yep,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4463.9s">Thank</a>  you for advocating and thank you for trying to help us help me and the chief, you know, build that relationship back we've made really good gains. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4472.206s">We've</a>  had some great promotions recently so I'm chief Evans is off and running and doing, doing a really good job and I can tell the changes that are happening so appreciate you helping in any way you can as a Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4485.074s">I</a>  think what we have what we're doing in June with the 25 papers or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4491.564s">is</a>  my next step. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4493.346s">And</a>  then I think I mentioned to a few of you that there is probably, you know, every other department is coming coming at us for to work on this capital improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4501.953s">We</a>  have 2 million in requests to be spent from the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4505.476s">So</a>  what we're going to do, starting probably end of June into July is figuring out all those requests, including that one because we're taking it seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4513.823s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4515.82s">not</a>  update fully our capital improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4518.061s">We</a>  have the call-in center come and do that, usually biannually, but we have to see where we're at, see what we have in the stabilization accounts, and make sure we're providing our departments with what they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4528.947s">And</a>  that's included in my list. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4530.688s">It's</a>  on my desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4531.548s">I</a>  get free cash requests, I have papers for June, and then my July and August work. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4536.751s">So</a>  I kind of take things in stages because we <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4539.024s">between</a>  my office and what all the work City Council's doing, I think we all have very, very full plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4544.585s">So</a>  we're trying to take it one step at a time, but I'm glad we had that conversation and that's on my radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4550.907s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4554.047s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4555.507s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4557.608s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Mayor for coming and presenting this budget and being so thorough in your comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4563.609s">I</a>  appreciate that crafting a budget is always <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4567.934s">tough.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4569.074s">It</a>  requires making tough choices and saying yes and no to certain projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4574.876s">I'm</a>  grateful, especially to the voters, but I'm grateful in general that this year we're in a better position than the previous years, certainly much smoother this year in my memory compared to previous years. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4588.12s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4590.394s">You</a>  know, I appreciate that we're truly making some historical, historic progress, especially in the schools, but, but, including investments in DPW and recovering what we've lost over, you know, decades of austerity. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4604.438s">and</a>  making progress on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4606.159s">Now,</a>  there's still a long way to go, and I think residents recognize that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4613.603s">We,</a>  as a city council, through the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, put out a public feedback form with regards to what people were looking for from this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4626.57s">And</a>  through just the whole budget crafting process, we've received a lot of feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4632.233s">A</a>  lot of it is about infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4634.92s">and</a>  about improving roads, improving road safety for cyclists and pedestrians as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4642.142s">And</a>  I think that's why in our city council budget recommendations, we included funding or requests for funding for an additional traffic engineer, for staff positions, for restriping, adjusting signal timing, patching potholes, <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4663.106s">and</a>  shrinking the repair backlog and also just more money to install and maintain road safety markings, signage and bike related equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4675.071s">I</a>  was wondering what progress we can expect to make this year with regards to those like infrastructure and traffic safety improvements, what we might not be able to get this year and how we can plan the budget for that going forward.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4689.383s">Yeah,</a>  I think one of the biggest things is the assistant traffic engineer and I may not have that title 100% perfectly, but I could be corrected corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4699.005s">It</a>  was held by somebody over a year ago and we have posted it twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4706.447s">We</a>  just recently took that down and we're going to adjust it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4710.248s">to</a>  try to fill that role that would be somebody under Todd and Owen and the engineering department for traffic related matters which are important to all of us I know I've seen you on the walks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4722.575s">And</a>  I know we have, you know, some. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4725.636s">trouble</a>  spots that DCR, MassDOT are helping us with, but we need the in-house staff for the rest of our roads and the safety improvements that need to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4734.282s">We're</a>  progressively doing work on our streets and streets, but we could always use that second person. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4740.946s">So</a>  Director Blake actually emailed me today to discuss the new job description. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4746.049s">So</a>  we'll be meeting with him very soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4748.131s">And</a>  I really hope to fill that position sometime over the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4752.125s">So</a>  that's, I think, I hope that answered part of your question I know the water sewer sidewalk, all the major projects like I said in my message 400% we are up on the work we are doing and the amount of engineers that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4768.173s">cannot</a>  handle that that amount of work so that is the one position that it wasn't even a, should we put this position and we, we had to to be able to maintain the projects that we have this construction season and that we have planned for next construction season and the construction seasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4784.604s">After</a>  that, there's just between water and sewer work lead line replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4789.927s">streets</a>  sidewalks it's I think there's another something I'm missing but it's overwhelming it's hundreds of millions of dollars and it's it's overwhelming and we we are starting to message that we have an eight million dollar it's it's a loan but hopefully part of that will be a grant through the MWRA <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4810.894s">That</a>  8 million will only touch 20% of our lead lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4815.02s">So</a>  you're talking 50 million alone that needs to be spent on our lead lines to change them out throughout our entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4822.23s">And</a>  that takes personnel and we need that engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4827.289s">So,</a>  so we are making those investments we read your we read all of your requests, and we knew that was that was one of them streets and sidewalks we hear a lot, and on the management side, we're, we're working every day and I'm got a meeting scheduled you know just to make sure we're keeping up with see click fix and we're keeping up with managing our staff and things are getting done.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4848.607s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4850.97s">Obviously</a>  I think infrastructure is always an ongoing conversation so anything that you know what what goes through my mind is how can we plan long term to get those positions that we need and. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4864.175s">Commissioner</a>  McIvern was here earlier today talking about how there's still positions in DPW, we need to fill. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4870.022s">So</a>  I think a priority for this council now and going forward, especially, is about how can we make, how can we fill those positions, because it's so important to get the, you know, people in the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4883.52s">I</a>  don't want to steal the thunder from Councilor Callaghan. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4886.484s">I</a>  know she's been working on a volunteer tree planting program as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4891.272s">And</a>  I was wondering what capacity we might have in this budget to get that off the ground.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4898.907s">I</a>  did meet with Councilor Callahan, it's been a little bit over a month and I loved her idea so I think, I think that too is on my list for capital. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4908.072s">I</a>  think whatever additional money we want to meet our tree goals and now without being able to. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4915.143s">invest</a>  ARPA funds into those additional trees that we need to plant. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4919.809s">We've</a>  been doing consistently over 200 a year the last several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4923.234s">I</a>  want to keep to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4924.435s">So</a>  I would hope to have something before you over the summer to meet our tree goals.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4931.227s">Um,</a>  we also talked at our first committee the whole meeting about updating our financial software because we don't necessarily, the system that Medford uses is really archaic and it's, it's hard for people coming, you know, coming to Medford to work to use the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4947.836s">It's</a>  also slowing down, you know, payments to workers and especially when we do <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4953.679s">retro,</a>  and that, you know, affects morale as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4957.642s">I</a>  was wondering what we might be able to see in the upcoming year about getting us to a place where we maybe look at new options for software. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4965.849s">I</a>  know Director Dickinson's kind of looked at options, it's a little pricey, but what can we expect in terms of long-term planning for something like that?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4974.015s">Yeah,</a>  I think, unfortunately, that was part of our free cash planning when we released that in October, and unfortunately the <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4983.458s">I</a>  think the money is the least of our worries, especially if the council wants to invest in it through a stabilization account or free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4991.221s">I</a>  think it's the staffing to implement something that takes two plus years. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=4995.443s">I'm</a>  not sure we have the capability to do everything that our finance team is doing and have somebody oversee that project currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5004.146s">So</a>  next step would probably be to explore, and we've talked about it, <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5011.493s">be</a>  to explore whether it's a consultant or somebody to come on part-time to just fully manage implementing and changing over immunists. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5020.259s">It's</a>  an endeavor that I know one or two cities that have done it and they'll just say how difficult it is, but I do know we need to get there.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5029.425s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5030.646s">That's</a>  a helpful answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5033.468s">I</a>  think residents have also been asking about, <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5039.343s">protections</a>  for immigrants, especially at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5043.044s">And</a>  we have our non cooperation policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5045.665s">But</a>  in we you know, I know, members of city staff are making various efforts to protect residents and inform you know, residents of what they're able to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5057.208s">I</a>  was wondering what you could speak to in this budget about about protecting our immigrant neighbors?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5065.21s">Sure,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5065.89s">I</a>  mean, that's <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5067.535s">top</a>  priority, especially what we've been seeing on the federal level. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5072.217s">And</a>  we've been doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5073.257s">It's</a>  always screaming at the rooftops about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5076.038s">No,</a>  but that's the connectors and liaisons. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5079.299s">We</a>  have 12 people that speak a second language that are out in our community weekly meeting with residents from all over every neighborhood, our housing authorities, our senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5090.623s">They're</a>  out hosting events, and we are trying to build the trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5095.186s">So</a>  if people have questions or concerns, we are giving them the right answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5101.771s">We</a>  are passing out Know Your Rights cards. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5105.133s">We</a>  also are having events. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5108.756s">We</a>  had an immigration attorney speak last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5111.978s">We</a>  also had an event for business owners so they know how to protect their staffs and themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5118.743s">So</a>  this stuff is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5120.846s">I</a>  also have a meeting with the Attorney General General's office, we meet bi weekly with the mayors and the Attorney General staff but I also have a meeting just set up just with myself and their two attorneys they actually <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5133.743s">booked</a>  it with me because I brought up, you know, how do I educate myself in knowing what we can and cannot do as a city what we should and shouldn't say and it would be really great to be able to provide the council in myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5149.784s">information</a>  on what can and can't be done, because we want to do everything we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5154.209s">I</a>  know we're bound by certain federal laws, but we still want to do, you know, we have a welcoming ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5161.596s">I</a>  think everybody knows that we want to protect our innocent immigrant residents and that's, we have to do it.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5168.623s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5169.484s">And</a>  my last question, I promise. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5173.746s">You</a>  mentioned the Hegner Centre for after school childcare, obviously a very important issue in our community, a really difficult one too, because it's not just about spending money, it's also about getting space and sorting out all the details. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5186.595s">I</a>  was wondering, after the Hegner Centre, what can we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5189.557s">Because</a>  as helpful as that's going to be, it won't solve all the childcare problems? <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5194.819s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5195.239s">And</a>  it's a regional problem as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5196.96s">But</a>  I was wondering after that, what next steps are there as a city? <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5202.882s">What</a>  groundwork is being laid?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5204.683s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5206.103s">Yes,</a>  I can actually, myself or I could have Dr. Galussi, superintendent of schools, send the presentation that we were given by Dr. Galussi, not yesterday, a week ago Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5220.549s">So</a>  she did a full presentation on all the work that her team <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5225.37s">including</a>  Megan Fidelicari, and I know one or two school committee members have been highly involved in, and they have a plan in place to increase afterschool programming within our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5235.592s">So</a>  it was very exciting to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5238.052s">There</a>  was a whole host of residents that were here to advocate, and they really just came up to the podium and said, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5244.333s">So</a>  Dr. Galusi is taking that issue along with the school committee, especially several members that are <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5253.355s">I</a>  talk to a number of parents all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5256.958s">She's</a>  taking that issue as one of the biggest issues to solve, which I'm super excited about because I've been asking, can we just increase each school by 10 students a year? <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5266.765s">Can</a>  we set goals? <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5268.567s">And</a>  she has a plan to increase it quite a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5271.929s">I'm</a>  very excited about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5273.831s">So</a>  we can send you that presentation because there's so much going on and everybody's trying to solve every problem here in the city between the school committee, school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5282.538s">city</a>  and the council so we can get that to you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5284.72s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5285.301s">That'd</a>  be super helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5286.683s">Thank</a>  you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5287.484s">Thank</a>  you for the council for entertaining my questions.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5290.007s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5290.928s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5291.469s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5293.218s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5293.759s">And</a>  1st, I just want to apologize for not being there in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5296.822s">I</a>  am feeling pretty under the weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5298.624s">Um,</a>  and in fact, I think I will probably drop off after this budget vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5303.689s">Um,</a>  but, uh, but I also want to thank Councilor Tseng for, um, mentioning the tree planting the volunteer tree planting project and just give a tiny little update so that people understand and then ask 1 question. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5315.141s">of</a>  the mayor as well, that the volunteer tree planting project is full steam ahead I have a team of dedicated volunteers who are working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5324.254s">We</a>  anticipate having our first pilot planting happened this fall, and we are working with trees Medford and you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5332.205s">beginning</a>  to talk to folks in the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5335.007s">So</a>  I believe that that project is going to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5338.049s">And</a>  Madam Mayor, I know that you had suggested when we met that the trees themselves, which is a relatively small part of the cost of planting trees, might come out of free cash when that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5351.938s">And</a>  I just wanted to see if that was still the plan.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5356.537s">Yes,</a>  that's what I mentioned, I think when Councilor Tseng ask the question that is I'm also on my list of free crap free cash requests, which we will be going through probably end of June into July so between the 25 papers we have to put before you in June that are kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5375.565s">All</a>  we can handle right now, we're gonna continue to work through all the capital requests, all the requests in for funding, because there's something coming in from almost every department. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5385.808s">We</a>  obviously need to make sure we're budgeting correctly and doing things in the proper years, but trees has been a huge goal of mine as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5393.47s">So</a>  I thank you for taking this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5395.23s">And</a>  I do plan on putting a paper before you, whether that's in June or July, to make sure we are reaching our tree planting goals.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5403.593s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5403.933s">I</a>  really appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5404.774s">And</a>  I'm also very, very excited to see the free cash and stabilization fund plans later this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5410.3s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5411.781s">Thank</a>  you feel better.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5412.742s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5414.024s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5421.047s">I'm</a>  going to shift in a different direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5423.61s">I</a>  think that there's still a lot of pain in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5426.873s">And</a>  a lot has to go back from the beginning of the process of the override and how we got to this process and how people didn't feel like they were being listened to or being part of the solution to get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5440.426s">When</a>  you talk to the rank and file across the community, across all of our departments, <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5444.827s">You</a>  hear concerns that maybe what was mentioned in the schools, really, it's not hitting the schools they don't see much of a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5453.172s">When</a>  you see the streets and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5455.453s">You</a>  don't see what was said I believe you said $500,000 would really <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5460.656s">um</a>  fix the pothole and sidewalk solutions and and it would help it would help it's not so as we're moving forward you're seeing these these issues that um have come up and we talk about funding issues and concerns something i've i've been bringing forward for years now the the cost of legal fees and seeing what's happening with our unions and <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5485.577s">the</a>  battles that are happening with lawsuits and arbitrations and hearings and not truly understanding and seeing the funding where our city's funds are being spent when you look at those situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5502.085s">But</a>  I think the biggest piece is that I find alarming and it's great to hear that glowing reports, but when you see and hear <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5514.355s">Our</a>  residents really feel like they're not being listened to. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5516.637s">I</a>  think it's important, whether it's the seniors talking about parking, I know you mentioned at the senior center and not feeling heard when it's with the new development that's coming in, or whether it's the override questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5531.747s">that</a>  our residents were concerned about preparing them to take on such a hit when it came for increased taxes or with the charter questions that this council put forth and made some drastic changes to get it just put forth to the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5550.095s">Or</a>  even now, I'm sure you're hearing with the concerns with the process and how we're working with the zoning and how people are scared that we're changing what Method looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5561.301s">So</a>  I think that there's a lot going on that I don't like. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5565.947s">I've</a>  asked this council to vote on <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5568.38s">on</a>  a state audit to come in that this council will vote just to look at the processes of free cash and see what we were last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5576.684s">And</a>  then meeting with the state auditors association and understanding the process through these professionals and understanding that a nine to $11 million free cash safety net for the city of Medford to maintain your bond rating and have enough money with the size and the budget that we have of our community <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5598.235s">that</a>  will be sustainable. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5599.536s">And</a>  then you see $28 million of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5602.417s">And</a>  now we're talking about all these different pockets that we're gonna be pooling, taking money out of, where free cash is budgeted money that this council voted on your request to move initiatives forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5616.382s">And</a>  we see time after time, this huge surplus in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5624.886s">And</a>  maybe it'll end, <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5626.537s">But</a>  we look at what's going on now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5628.999s">You're</a>  seeing under undermanned fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5632.662s">You're</a>  seeing undermanned funded DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5637.126s">You</a>  still have questions in the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5639.427s">You</a>  still have questions with streets and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5642.77s">There</a>  are so many concerns that are happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5644.832s">I</a>  know I'm the odd duck here bringing these concerns up. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5650.616s">But</a>  these are concerns that we should look at and really <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5657.553s">re-evaluate</a>  and understand that someone needs to be listening to the residents of the city because this council is not doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5666.89s">And</a>  it falls on our mayor and our leader to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5670.611s">So</a>  I'm not too happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5673.393s">There's</a>  too many gaps and too many concerns that haven't been answered to me when it comes to the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5680.315s">And</a>  I won't be supporting the budget, shockingly, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5684.917s">But</a>  I just think that <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5688.118s">there</a>  are way too many people that aren't being listened to and I know the override is a is was a was a huge success for some but it was a very close vote and it really divided the community more than you think and a lot of people mostly our most vulnerable people in our community are feeling that pain today and <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5705.002s">they</a>  don't hear any resolutions, they don't see any resolve, they don't see an assistance to support them as they're making very difficult decisions in their lives today. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5713.425s">So,</a>  again, I apologize that I, like my fellow colleagues, I'm not throwing roses at your feet and saying how wonderful this is, but, you know, my colleagues find it very difficult when you don't line up with what their philosophy or their views are. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5735.018s">To</a>  me, I think sometimes things need to be said, even though it doesn't fit the narrative of seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5741.862s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5743.883s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5745.384s">I</a>  just want to say one thing I for one don't think the mayor lines up with my ideology and views all that much but you know, we can still work together.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5751.908s">We</a>  do our best. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5752.588s">Yeah,</a>  I guess I can address a few things I mean I have to, I have to stick up for the school override money. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5763.928s">Member</a>  Graham and Member Ruseau negotiate the teacher contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5770.801s">I</a>  believe, I think that's 2.5 million to extend the school day per year and they've done their job, and being part of the school committee I know very well that every dollar that we've spent on this override money has gone to exactly what we said it will go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5785.893s">I</a>  know it's, I know there's people that are not happy with the override I know there's people that can't afford it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5790.857s">I,</a>  I understand that and I know who you're speaking for and you're who you're hearing from. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5795.32s">But</a>  from a standpoint of where it's being spent, I can assure you it's being spent where we said it was going to be spent and it is positively affecting our students and our faculty. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5806.546s">With</a>  regards to the DPW monies, we went through a process of <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5811.189s">That</a>  was 500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5811.709s">We</a>  needed more staffing we had to do the through the CBA we had to do internal postings first. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5818.813s">I</a>  believe just recently, we have those three new crew members, and that's just recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5823.875s">I</a>  never said that was going to fully fix our streets and sidewalks, it's not going to but to have another crew and have two crews out at the same time, especially around the time frame of <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5833.78s">Now</a>  until July until we get all the potholes fix until the next winter when they all get torn up, torn up again it's just a constant, constant issue but our dpw is is working hard and if they're not we are doing our best to manage. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5848.624s">That's</a>  that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5849.244s">Okay,</a>  that's my. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5856.38s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5859.783s">Pre</a>  cash we're at 23 million we just spent 5 million to offset 5 million of the $30 million bond we may use more, depending on where we are next year to offset that bond because the debt is going to be now 1.4 million we're going to have to pay back in the fiscal year 27 budget alone so we do between the financial task force and our outside audit we are making sure that we are doing right by the by the residents and <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5885.603s">Yes,</a>  that free cash will go down based on all the projects we have before us, Freedom Way alone just to repave it and do sidewalks soup to nuts is probably going to be $15 million, we have to do the new roofs at the Roberts Brooks and miss a tuck. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5901.589s">That's</a>  going to be I think a few million each. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5903.97s">I</a>  mean, and these are just projects that are continually coming up, we have to fix the heat in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5908.892s">We're</a>  going to have to use that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5911.013s">stabilization</a>  account next over the summer, it needs to be fixed because people need to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5915.755s">So</a>  there's just project after project in a city that's built when it was built and facilities that were built when they were built. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5923.197s">And</a>  now it's finally paying attention over the last several years of for facility maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5927.858s">There's</a>  a lot of work to do a lot of spending we need to do, just like, just like I said if we're down to 23 and dpw has requested almost 2 million on machinery and equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5940.222s">That</a>  is just one department of the many that need equipment and capital expenses that we need to fund over the next several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5949.486s">Our</a>  fire department, we're hiring 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5951.587s">I</a>  know that you're aware, Chief Evans and the team must have told you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5954.789s">So</a>  we are gonna be much better staffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5957.63s">Thankfully,</a>  we're going through that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5961.372s">I</a>  guess that's it for comments on those, but I hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5965.914s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5966.234s">Vice</a>  President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5969.477s">I'm</a>  just going to go to Vice President Collins and I'll come back to you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5973.881s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5974.261s">I</a>  want to keep the focus of our discussion on the operating budget proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5983.008s">And</a>  I don't want to rehash disagreements that we've had a billion times. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5987.112s">But</a>  since this has come up a couple times tonight, I do think it's important to correct the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=5993.52s">Nobody</a>  ever said that $500,000 to the DPW is going to wave a magic wand and fix every road and sidewalk in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6001.409s">We</a>  shouldn't pretend that that's what any department said, department head said last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6006.154s">That's</a>  not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6008.806s">That</a>  money that the residents of Medford voted to invest in our DPW capacity is to bring more of the labor of continually fixing those roads and sidewalks in-house so we can have city employees doing the work of day in, day out, year in, year out, fixing our roads and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6026.093s">It</a>  is misinformation to say that voters should have expected every road and sidewalk to be fixed because questions seven and eight were approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6033.836s">That</a>  is a fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6034.517s">That</a>  is what everybody has been saying since last summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6036.497s">And</a>  I think that we should <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6037.898s">I</a>  think it is fine and good to have disagreements about what we are funding and how in the city, but I think that we're all better than having to rely on misinformation to do that part of the reason I am eager to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6051.914s">a</a>  formal free cash allocation plan, or that you put it in different terms, it means the same thing, to go along with our budget proposal this year is because there's a lot of right answers for what we should be investing in. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6069.174s">You</a>  said right now we have 23 million, <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6072.457s">$5</a>  million to pay off the bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6074.678s">The</a>  Massachusetts Department of Revenue, I'm pretty sure the best practice is for 3 to 5% of a municipality's budget to be available as cash reserves, which would put us, that would be right around $10 million for City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6089.487s">So</a>  by my arithmetic, that means if we commit $7 million more <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6096.66s">this</a>  cycle to the list of projects that we have that we know we need investing in, which total way more than $7 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6105.563s">That</a>  will get us right back down to best practice, state best practice, and be able to say, all right, residents, we have a action plan for what we are investing in on what timetable. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6118.768s">And</a>  that is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6119.308s">That</a>  is just simply, you could say it's not good or bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6122.129s">It's</a>  just what we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6122.749s">It's</a>  what we should be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6127.12s">I</a>  just don't think that the conversation has to happen this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6129.882s">And</a>  since I'm already picking a scab, I think it's useful to restate that the city is audited every single year by statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6142.029s">And</a>  since I think we all are committed to the shared goal of fiscal prudence, I don't know why the residents of Medford would want us to spend money on an additional audit <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6155.075s">when</a>  we get one every single year as a matter of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6157.416s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6159.857s">I</a>  thank you, Council Collins I am in a way flattered if it's about free cash because as mayor you can't when you have too much free cash, then you're mismanaging funds if we go low, we don't have enough so I, we are doing our best we have a lot in the pipeline, we're going to probably get that down, you're right to about 12 million replenish our stabilization accounts and <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6185.805s">throughout</a>  the months ahead, do the capital needs that we need to do while trying to stay in balance and while not trying to overspend. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6194.988s">So</a>  we are doing our best on the city side with the council support on or requests as well on the projects that are needed throughout our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6203.651s">So</a>  I do like the feedback either way. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6205.971s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6206.792s">No,</a>  and I thank you for your time.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6210.393s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6213.628s">Again,</a>  I think that it's uncomfortable because it doesn't fit the dialogue for some of my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6220.97s">So</a>  it's easy to say the narrative that suits them. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6223.971s">But</a>  again, they can go back and revisit all their Reddit sites and the comments they've made that said that $500,000 would fix their roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6233.713s">So</a>  we can go on in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6235.354s">So</a>  the other piece that I appreciate. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6238.514s">The</a>  assessment says we need $200 million.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6241.609s">Our</a>  assessment, we need over 200 million to fix our roads and sidewalks, and we've been saying that for five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6247.331s">So</a>  we use it.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6248.552s">Oh,</a>  the assessor and finance director. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6250.273s">No,</a>  the assessment.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6251.493s">The</a>  pavement management plan.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6253.314s">Oh,</a>  I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6254.254s">No,</a>  I know that, but what I'm saying is the assessor and finance director that weren't involved in the original override process. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6262.394s">were</a>  they involved in assessing the roads and sidewalks and stuff? <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6265.436s">Was</a>  that private? <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6266.656s">Because</a>  that's what I'm a little confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6268.097s">So</a>  I don't know, maybe it's late. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6270.678s">I</a>  just, I look at the different dialogue that's being said with the requests to the audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6279.362s">Maybe</a>  my colleagues, they tune me out, they don't listen, but the audit that's requested, the ones that we pay for every year as a city because it's mandated, <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6287.621s">That</a>  lines up as the audit, when I spoke with the auditors, state audits department, they explained that the lineup of what we do here is the audit of the money we spend, $10, we spend $10. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6304.19s">The</a>  audit that we're requesting is saying, why are we not spending that money correctly? <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6310.333s">Why</a>  is it that every year we have an abundance in free cash? <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6315.745s">So</a>  it doesn't fit their dialogue, so I understand that it's an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6321.584s">But</a>  when you talk about the free cash and the capital needs that we need, that's usually done through capital improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6328.428s">That's</a>  usually done as a process where we work together in finding out these big projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6333.992s">When</a>  you talk about Freedom Way, that shouldn't be done as an emergency basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6337.794s">This</a>  didn't happen overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6339.515s">That's</a>  a capital project. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6340.736s">That's</a>  a capital plan put in place by our office. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6343.577s">We've</a>  been working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6344.618s">No,</a>  I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6345.419s">But</a>  when you respond by saying, well, we're using that free cash to pay for that bond, <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6351.122s">Well,</a>  that's not used correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6355.184s">That</a>  money isn't used correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6357.225s">So</a>  again, we could keep beating this up, but this is my opinion that I'm sharing with you, that residents are sharing with me, because they seem that no one is listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6371.091s">So</a>  thank you again.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6374.292s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6376.193s">I</a>  mean, just for one person, <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6380.455s">And</a>  maybe we're just using different words. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6383.436s">When</a>  we talk about how did we spend the money and did it go to the places we set it, but we're doing that every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6388.998s">And</a>  that's, that's what the audit is right yes we talked about how should the city spend money, where should money be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6397.153s">Well,</a>  we have a conversation about that every two years and it's, we have it every year it's called the city budget and we have it every two years it's called an election. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6403.637s">I</a>  mean, that's different, you know, people disagree with how the mayor's making decisions about, and I disagree with you often, and all of us do, how to spend money. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6415.504s">Then</a>  you have to put someone else in the office to make different decisions I mean that's just say that's an audit that's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6421.785s">That's</a>  I just think we're using different words to talk about what decision making is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6425.786s">So</a>  that's just my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6427.687s">And</a>  I appreciate that we are a little more clear on the differences of what we're talking about now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6433.309s">Is</a>  there anything else you'd like to add or the chief of staff.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6436.07s">No,</a>  just thank you for your time President Bears and vice president Collins and the city council we appreciate we appreciate you allowing us to present and answer questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6443.853s">And</a>  I think maybe June 10 but you'll let us know we have a few things to get you before then and hope <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6449.757s">that</a>  you vote in favor of this budget?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6452.078s">Well,</a>  we're gonna go to any public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6455.218s">Well,</a>  first I need a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=6457.579s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor, Vice President Collins?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7381.483s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7382.163s">My</a>  only question is that the residents that will be impacted by the construction, you know, just making sure I know we have 72 hours of notification and is that just done by, you know, just the butters or could we get something more extensive?</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7397.227s">No,</a>  this is just the poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7399.508s">This</a>  is just the joint poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7400.868s">We're</a>  not talking about the dormitory. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7402.389s">We're</a>  not talking about the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7403.889s">This</a>  is just them relocating your utility pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7406.37s">They're</a>  going to dig a hole and they're going to put a new pole in and then rehang some wires. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7410.691s">So</a>  the disturbance for a pole relocation is very minimal to Albutters.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7418.416s">So</a>  the sidewalks won't be closed, driveways won't be impacted?</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7422.959s">They</a>  currently have both sidewalks open and it should be relocated within a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7431.204s">So</a>  this is like a day's worth of work.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7434.346s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7435.227s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Rocco DiRico]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7486.276s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears, Rocco DiRico, 14 Capen Street, Medford, Tufts University, Office of Government and Community Relations. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7496.822s">Appreciate</a>  the Council taking this up as the City Engineer explained. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7503.206s">This</a>  is part of our dormitory project, which will add 664 <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7509.649s">on-campus</a>  beds for juniors and seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7512.95s">The</a>  other benefit of this project, aside from allowing us to proceed with the construction, is it's going to allow for new trees on both sides of Boston Avenue, as well as streetscape improvements and bike lanes on both sides of Boston Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7531.234s">To</a>  answer Councilor Scarpelli's question, on this side of Boston Ave, <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7537.655s">there</a>  are no driveways and the the abutter is the MBTA train tracks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7544.381s">So</a>  this should not have an impact on the neighbors, but nonetheless we are meeting with the neighbors every month to go through construction concerns, answer their questions, and then we also send a newsletter out to our neighbors in the middle of the month <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7564.837s">to</a>  communicate further construction news. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7568.539s">So</a>  we'll continue to do that as part of this particular project, which is just moving the poles, but also throughout the course of the larger project. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7577.884s">So</a>  just here to voice my support for this grant of location, appreciate the time and a long night.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7584.288s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7585.529s">We'll</a>  go to Jeremy Martin. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7587.81s">Jeremy,</a>  name and address for the record, and please register your comment on this grant of location.</p>

 <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7697.987s">Now,</a>  therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we adopt the provisions of Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 60, Section 3F, <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7705.632s">which</a>  allows municipalities to add a section for voluntary donations on excise tax bills that will go towards a fund for in need residents Councilor by me.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7715.115s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7715.615s">So</a>  this is a another request from our veteran services director who I think is doing a wonderful job supporting veterans in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7723.977s">Essentially,</a>  she wants to add a <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7727.519s">an</a>  option for residents to be able to donate if they choose to on their excise tax bills to a fund that would assist in need veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7736.047s">The</a>  requirement for doing so is that the city council vote to adopt this particular section of mass general law. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7745.596s">I</a>  think it's a very worthwhile initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7749.259s">I</a>  don't want to belabor the point <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7751.989s">too</a>  much after all of our fine words about the veteran community earlier in the night and considering that we still have a lot to get to. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7764.045s">But</a>  I think it's a very worthwhile resolution and I'd motion to approve.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7770.182s">On</a>  the motion of Council I'm going to approve this adoption of Massachusetts general law chapter 60 section three F, second about second by Councilor Tseng, since this is an adoption of state law.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7817.472s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7818.373s">Yes,</a>  to restate what you just said, people who have been paying attention to this process have heard me say this dozens of times before, every zoning proposal or zoning amendment <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7828.34s">goes</a>  from the planning and permitting committee reported out this body then statutorily must refer to the Community Development Board where there are public hearings on the proposal, and that is then submitted back to this body for a vote with recommendations if the Community Development Board so chooses so this is the stage where we refer this proposal to the Community Development Board they will hold <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7850.162s">Their</a>  public hearings the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7852.865s">This</a>  year has been great about taking the time that they need to ask the questions and get the comments in the context that they need to form their recommendations I'm sure that they will do this on the accessory dwellings accessory dwelling units proposed changes as well for folks who would like to educate themselves about these proposed changes before the CDP public hearing dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7874.563s">There</a>  is a lot of information available on Medford ma.org slash zoning we have been discussing these proposed updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7881.951s">Since</a>  March we held a public q amp a earlier this month. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7886.736s">And</a>  this update encompasses both updates that are required of us and other communities due to a recent change in state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7895.927s">As</a>  well as some proposed changes that go better outside the bounds of nearly what is required to be in compliance with the state housing law. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=7905.061s">So</a>  with that emotion to refer to the Community Development Board.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8229.731s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears, and thank you for flagging that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8234.382s">The</a>  community control over public surveillance ordinance was passed by the city council, and I believe February March of 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8242.427s">We</a>  have gone through this annual public report process. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8249.172s">One</a>  time before in April of 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8253.274s">We</a>  reviewed the annual reporting of the one city agency that was registered as having surveillance technology at that time which was the Medford Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8263.686s">That</a>  was a bit of an unusual public reporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8272.429s">That</a>  was a bit of an unusual annual public report in that the only surveillance technology known and use in the city at that time was body worn cameras by the Medford Police Department which also per a negotiated contract carve out in the ordinance is not subject to the approval of a use policy which all other surveillance technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8291.774s">in</a>  the city would be because sorry I should back up here for people who don't know the Community Control of Republic surveillance ordinance is an ordinance passed in 2023 that sets up a structure for the city council and residents of Medford to look together at <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8308.492s">surveillance</a>  technology that is approved to be used by any public entity in the city of Medford so this doesn't regulate ring cameras or nest cameras it's just surveillance technology that the city wants to use and make sure that we have a public process for saying, what are the pros, what are the cons, what are the costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8324.906s">What</a>  are we hoping to get out of this and what are the potential risks that we can so that we can make sure we have that full conversation before the city council takes a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8332.572s">to</a>  approve a surveillance technology with the use policy or deny one or ask for modifications in order for the surveillance technology to be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8342.898s">So</a>  last year we were just having a review of the use of body worn cameras by the Medford Police Department they hadn't been in effect for very long by that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8350.643s">point</a>  so it was a pretty short report. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8354.026s">This</a>  time the reporting looks a little bit different because we have a full year of experience and data on the Medford Police Department's use of body-worn cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8363.515s">They</a>  went over this with us in a committee of the whole or sorry a public health and community safety committee a few weeks ago and this is also the first time that our reporting includes use of surveillance technology <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8375.125s">by</a>  the Medford parking department. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8377.106s">This</a>  surveillance technology automatic license plate readers was inadvertently already in use by the Medford parking department prior to their submission of an impact port and a use policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8389.35s">However,</a>  in committee of the whole, we reviewed a draft impact report, we reviewed a draft use policy, the committee discussed it and reported it out and we are looking at a use policy tonight that includes a couple of small modifications that the council requested <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8405.155s">to</a>  the license plate reader use policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8408.679s">So</a>  the documents included in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8410.801s">So,</a>  the one of the requirements of the city council per the community control of the public surveillance ordinance is to hold these meetings annually to review the use of surveillance technology by city agencies and then to compile <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8426.918s">In</a>  this report, the findings, how many list them out here, the number of requests for approval, the number of times the city council approved requests for surveillance technology the number of times the city council requested modifications. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8442.585s">The</a>  number of times that the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8448.323s">declined</a>  to approve a surveillance technology use policy and all annual surveillance reports and reporting that were submitted this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8458.411s">So</a>  this compiles that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8460.733s">Again,</a>  this was a bit of another unusual year, but for a different reason in that we did not receive any requests for a new use of a new surveillance technology that would be, say, for example, if the parking department said, hey, there's this new hardware that we want to use, we want to introduce, we're gonna ask for permission. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8476.485s">Before</a>  we use it that is how the process should go. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8478.327s">This</a>  was more of a approval of a pre existing surveillance technology use. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8487.139s">The</a>  City Council annual report compiles the impact report, or sorry, it compiles the Medford Police Department's annual reporting, it compiles the parking department's impact report and updated use policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8505.26s">It</a>  also includes <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8509.301s">public</a>  comment that was submitted on the annual report by the Medford police department so this is a part of our public record now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8517.395s">That</a>  is one of the goals of the ordinance is to. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8520.815s">maintain</a>  and add to a public record of surveillance technology in the city both those submitted by the agencies that are using it, and the city council's discussions and findings and takeaways from our, from what we discussed with these departments about their use of surveillance technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8540.308s">With</a>  that, I would make a motion to approve the parking department's use policy for automatic license plate readers. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=8548.413s">I</a>  would also make a motion to approve the city council annual surveillance report, unless there is any questions or comments from my fellow councilors or members in public.</p>

    <p>[Micah Kesselman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9141.302s">I</a>  attended tonight's session. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9144.305s">I've</a>  just been super excited about lots of very cool budget stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9149.529s">And</a>  a really dope concert by our middle schoolers, which is really cool to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9154.593s">But</a>  mainly to support Councilor Lazzaro's resolution that was unfortunately tabled, though I do understand the reasoning behind tabling it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9164.781s">However,</a>  with that said, I'd <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9166.523s">I'm</a>  still gonna make comments about it because I have a right to and you have to listen to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9170.465s">So</a>  enjoy. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9171.346s">I</a>  do think that it could benefit from an amendment that make have Buckley or have the chief of police present that report in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9186.014s">The</a>  issue that I think that that would address and that I observed in part during the earlier committee of the whole meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9194.421s">where</a>  the MPD came and gave a wonderful presentation was that there clearly is a sort of disconnect between the information that the MPD know or believe they know and what the residents of <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9211.442s">the</a>  city, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9213.543s">So</a>  that would go a long way to sort of bridging that gap, I think, just to have that regular in-person presentation so that he could actually also come here and receive feedback directly from residents of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9225.692s">Because</a>  without that, they're just going to continue to live in this thicker and thicker bubble of nonsense and spout some of the totally incorrect things that they were saying during today's committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9235.638s">So</a>  that's my one recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9238.58s">And</a>  I do think that <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9241.736s">I</a>  do urge you plead for urgency to provide more accountability from the MPD towards to the residents of the city because at the end of the day their job is to protect the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9258.453s">That</a>  is their one job. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9261.269s">Not</a>  to nitpick the mayor's speech earlier, but it isn't just to protect the so-called non-criminal citizens of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9274.715s">Everyone</a>  here has rights, no matter what their status is. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9278.376s">And</a>  it's to protect everyone's rights, regardless of status, regardless if they are, even if they are criminals, they still need to be protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9285.299s">Their</a>  rights need to be protected by the police, even as they're enforcing laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9289.441s">So</a>  that's, I'm just gonna continue shouting to the ether until something happens with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9295.586s">All</a>  right, thanks guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9296.887s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9300.309s">Good</a>  to go to Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9301.75s">I</a>  have Mr. Castagnani on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9304.552s">Name</a>  and address for the record, you have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9366.581s">Yes,</a>  Mr. Cassidy. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9368.522s">Kevin</a>  Foley has been hired to serve as the city solicitor.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9372.946s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9373.486s">Same</a>  office as usual.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9376.635s">The</a>  physical office, I guess it's the law department office on the second floor.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9390.581s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9390.921s">Is</a>  there anything else you'd like to comment on?</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9393.623s">No,</a>  thanks.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9394.923s">Thank</a>  you so much, Andy. <a href="https://youtu.be/B1AX1IdGJno&t=9395.884s">Have</a>  a good night.</p>
