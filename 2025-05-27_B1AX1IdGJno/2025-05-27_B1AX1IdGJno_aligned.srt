00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:00,154

Okay, I told her that she emailed me and then I called her.

3
00:00:03,705 --> 00:00:05,926
I was like, she asked me if we could do something else.

4
00:00:05,946 --> 00:00:07,768
She was like, never mind.

5
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:09,169
And you put me on the agenda.

6
00:00:09,189 --> 00:00:10,730
So I was like, yeah, sure.

I'm seated.

10
00:06:52,207 --> 00:06:53,349
Justin, could you help Kevin?

11
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:59,556
Could you help Kevin?

12
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:03,441
OK.

13
00:07:03,481 --> 00:07:06,425

Yeah, we're gonna start the meeting.

Thank you, President bears.

27
00:08:44,094 --> 00:08:53,557
I'll be very brief, briefer than I was planning on, because I'm the, you know, our students have been waiting for a while to perform for us and the music will speak for them for itself.

28
00:08:55,608 --> 00:08:59,510
Art is such a vital part of who we are as a Medford community.

29
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:12,175
It was a vital part of my childhood growing up and being part of the high school orchestra was a foundational memory of my high school experience.

30
00:09:12,195 --> 00:09:19,718
I know that these kids have worked so hard and they deserve this gold medal so much.

31
00:09:19,838 --> 00:09:23,600
And I'm just so happy that we're able to hear from them today.

32
00:09:24,812 --> 00:09:35,616
Before I turn it over to them, I should also note that the school committee will be honoring the middle school string ensemble at their June 9th meeting as well.

33
00:09:35,756 --> 00:09:37,417
So they'll get their accommodations there.

34
00:09:38,357 --> 00:09:41,158
With all that being said, I'll hand it over to the orchestra.

35
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:49,758
Thank you Medford Council for arranging this event to recognize our students hard work and achievement.

36
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,085
I'm just very, very proud of the achievement.

37
00:09:55,966 --> 00:09:58,689
I felt very connected to my students.

38
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:08,911
And thank you all administrators and especially parents for your support, for your continued unwavering support.

00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:46,454
Ask them how they stay together.

48
00:14:46,754 --> 00:14:54,561
They listen with their eyes and they hear with, they watch with their ears.

49
00:14:56,343 --> 00:14:56,703
Thank you.

50
00:14:57,144 --> 00:15:01,227
It's such a, it's very enjoyable to work with the students.

51
00:15:01,908 --> 00:15:04,731
And thank you, thank you for your beautiful playing.

52
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:29,695
All right.

53
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:30,716
Thank you so much.

54
00:15:32,476 --> 00:15:33,357
We'd love to hear more.

55
00:15:34,037 --> 00:15:40,059
I'm going to introduce Councillor Seng up here to read off the student names and folks can come through.

56
00:15:40,099 --> 00:15:44,361
We'll come down here and we'll shake everyone's hand as they come through and then we'll take a photo with you.

57
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:46,262
But do you have more music first?

58
00:15:47,382 --> 00:15:48,703
Is there any more music to be played or?

59
00:15:50,144 --> 00:15:50,904
Is that the only song?

60
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:52,004
Okay.

61
00:15:52,945 --> 00:15:54,225
I don't want to put you on the spot.

62
00:15:55,086 --> 00:15:56,226
Everyone just looks very ready.

00:16:16,512 --> 00:16:18,894
But yeah, thank you for that wonderful playing.

00:16:19,074 --> 00:16:24,216

You need these.

Oh, you're gonna have to chase it.

00:21:30,758 --> 00:21:31,938
All right, thank you everyone.

92
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,079
Much appreciated.

All right, on the motion of counselor saying to approve seconded by seconded by counselor Collins.

94
00:22:08,318 --> 00:22:10,218
Mr. Clerk, please call the role.

95
00:22:18,081 --> 00:22:19,601
Council, Council Kelly.

96
00:22:19,981 --> 00:22:20,221
Yes.

97
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:22,742
Vice President Collins.

98
00:22:30,338 --> 00:22:31,078
Councilor Kelly.

99
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:31,799
Yes.

100
00:22:33,379 --> 00:22:37,321
Councilor saying, President bears yes have the affirmative, none of the negative emotion passes.

101
00:22:38,862 --> 00:22:45,545
The motion of Council, I'm going to take the paper under suspension, seconded by Councilor saying, let's please call the roll.

102
00:23:00,949 --> 00:23:01,569
Council Kelly.

103
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:02,230
Yes.

104
00:23:03,571 --> 00:23:11,115
Vice President Collins Council is our council lemon Council Scarpelli Council saying present bears.

105
00:23:11,535 --> 00:23:13,937
Yes, I mean from the negative emotion passes so we'll take 25092, and 25039.

106
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:39,234
25092 offered under suspension by Council Lemming, resolution for the City of Medford to commemorate those who gave their lives in service to their country this Memorial Day, whereas Medford is home to many veterans and as well as their families and descendants who dutifully served their country throughout its history, whereas Medford is honored to be the final resting place of many men and women who gave their lives in military conflicts, including the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World War I,

107
00:23:39,894 --> 00:23:43,916
World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, Desert Storm, and Operation Enduring Freedom.

108
00:23:44,436 --> 00:23:48,577
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council commemorate Memorial Day to honor our veterans and all those who support them.

109
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:49,458
Councilor Lemming.

110
00:23:50,818 --> 00:23:52,419
Thank you, Council President.

111
00:23:52,659 --> 00:24:00,682
So, folks may have noticed that I've been absent for the past two weeks from City Council meetings.

112
00:24:00,762 --> 00:24:07,165
I was over in Virginia on reserve orders and I was happy to come back to

113
00:24:08,937 --> 00:24:14,698
Medford's annual Memorial Day celebration in the Oak Grove Cemetery yesterday.

114
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:33,183
And that is always one of my favorite events that I get to partake in in this job, because going there and seeing the folks who show up, it's not only the veterans who come, but it is the descendants of the veterans.

115
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,644
It is the people who have veterans and their families.

116
00:24:37,804 --> 00:24:46,768
A lower portion of the population these days tends to serve in the military because we don't have as many large scale wars like World War II.

117
00:24:46,888 --> 00:25:04,297
But what I did see is, you know, a guy came up to me and he just told me a story about how his uncle and father both left their welding jobs to join the Marines in World War II.

118
00:25:05,751 --> 00:25:07,392
And it mattered a lot to him.

119
00:25:07,412 --> 00:25:09,272
He just talked to me about it for a couple of minutes.

120
00:25:09,312 --> 00:25:24,698
And after I spoke, another woman came up to me and she said that her grandfather had been responsible for a lot of the, sorry, no, her father had been responsible for a lot of the statues in the Oak Grove Cemetery.

121
00:25:24,738 --> 00:25:27,739
He was a sculptor and he was also a veteran as well.

122
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,221
And it was clear just how much that history

123
00:25:32,235 --> 00:25:34,417
meant to all the folks in Medford.

124
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:52,468
And it's, I had much better words for this yesterday, I feel like, but just speaking off the cuff about it, it's always an honor to partake in, to partake in those, in those events.

125
00:25:53,009 --> 00:26:00,774
And I always, I just always love to have opportunities to

126
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:10,096
remember the history of the country and the way that we send masses off, many of whom don't make it back.

127
00:26:10,556 --> 00:26:19,542
But it's also an honor to remember the accomplishments that we've had on those masses.

128
00:26:20,263 --> 00:26:24,566
America gained its independence on the lives of service members.

129
00:26:24,926 --> 00:26:27,468
It was on the lives of service members that we ended slavery.

130
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:38,254
was on those lives that we and many of our allied nations defeated the Axis powers during World War II.

131
00:26:39,415 --> 00:26:41,595
And they continue to serve.

132
00:26:41,896 --> 00:26:52,159
So I just like to take this opportunity to have this body do its own very small part in commemorating their lives and

133
00:26:52,994 --> 00:26:56,635
I'd like to thank everybody for, like to thank everybody for listening to me.

134
00:26:56,655 --> 00:26:57,735
Thank you.

135
00:26:58,455 --> 00:26:59,295
Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

136
00:26:59,616 --> 00:27:01,296
Councilor Sang and then Councilor Zara.

137
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,456
Thank you.

138
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:10,238
I wanted to thank Councilor Lemming for putting this on the agenda and to thank him for his really meaningful words yesterday.

139
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:21,681
It's important that our residents see ourselves reflected in the things that we celebrate as a city and the things that we recognize as a city.

140
00:27:23,701 --> 00:27:37,600
So many Medford residents have given their lives and, you know, even put their lives on the line for our country, for the ideals that we hold together, for freedom, for justice for all.

141
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:52,641
for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and these really, I think, unifying values that, as a country, I think we need to take a deep look at and embrace.

142
00:27:53,482 --> 00:28:00,725
And as our veteran service director said yesterday in her wonderful remarks at the ceremony too,

143
00:28:03,055 --> 00:28:11,782
it's time to remember those who gave their life for their conscience, for serving a country with those ideals.

144
00:28:12,843 --> 00:28:14,124
And I found that very meaningful.

145
00:28:14,545 --> 00:28:24,753
So I wanted to thank, again, thank you, Councilor Leving for putting this on the agenda and thank our Veteran Services Department for all they do day in, day out for residents.

146
00:28:28,976 --> 00:28:30,418
Thank you, Councilor Lazaro.

147
00:28:31,854 --> 00:28:32,255
Thank you.

148
00:28:33,977 --> 00:28:49,096
I also wanted to thank counselor, lemming for bringing this up and for speaking yesterday I was traveling this weekend so I couldn't attend the ceremony but I'm glad there's an opportunity to commemorate Memorial Day at this meeting, I was actually spending the weekend with an active duty.

149
00:28:50,716 --> 00:28:52,638
member of the military, she's in the army.

150
00:28:53,979 --> 00:29:04,771
She had a really tough childhood and is now an infectious disease PhD, serving in the army and protecting our country right now.

151
00:29:06,272 --> 00:29:13,339
Something counselor lemming and I talked about this weekend was that the military

152
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:29,737
in the United States provides a lot of people with some things you wouldn't necessarily expect, which is economic mobility and a pathway to improve your station in a way that is still challenging for a lot of people.

153
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:35,201
And that is something that it provided for my grandfather when he served in World War II.

154
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:43,968
And then because of the GI Bill, he was able to buy a triple-decker in Worcester and raise a family there.

155
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:48,170
Even though he was a mailman for the rest of his life.

156
00:29:50,433 --> 00:29:53,636
So he was a really a government worker, all the whole time.

157
00:29:55,258 --> 00:29:56,259
But nobody in my family.

158
00:29:58,635 --> 00:30:00,236
was killed in action.

159
00:30:01,297 --> 00:30:05,160
But when I first met my husband, we've been married for 15 years, this was quite a while ago.

160
00:30:06,461 --> 00:30:19,911
He, one of his friends from college, they were orientation leaders together and he was in the ROTC and immediately joined the military and was deployed to Afghanistan.

161
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:28,137
And like a couple of weeks after I met my husband, he went to this kid, this child, he was like 24, he was killed in Afghanistan.

162
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:29,758
and he was at his funeral.

163
00:30:31,339 --> 00:30:43,670
And we talk about him a lot, especially around Memorial Day and how hard that must have been for his family, but how dedicated he was to serving his country.

164
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:56,821
And I think it's really important that we continue to remember him and remember the sacrifices that are made and what the sacrifices are made for.

165
00:30:58,112 --> 00:31:02,636
And I really appreciate Councilor Lemming bringing this forward and reminding us.

166
00:31:03,136 --> 00:31:03,717
So thank you.

167
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:07,320
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

168
00:31:09,008 --> 00:31:16,112
Thank you, President bears Thank you, Councilor lemming for bringing this forward and thank you for representing the city council at the Memorial Day event.

169
00:31:16,873 --> 00:31:31,822
Yesterday, I'm very grateful for holidays on the calendars like these which give us a reason to collectively, remember and celebrate the veterans in our lives and remember those who have passed away.

170
00:31:31,842 --> 00:31:34,684
I think it's evident most people have.

171
00:31:37,185 --> 00:31:45,472
You know, some people have military experience they are themselves veterans most people have a veteran in their family or amongst their circle of loved ones, and it strikes me that.

172
00:31:48,903 --> 00:32:02,473
It's so important to have these opportunities to collectively reflect on what that means and to be prompted to think about what remembering means when we're remembering people that we love who have passed away because they're members of the armed forces.

173
00:32:03,693 --> 00:32:10,058
Or just to try to reflect on what that means for those people who do have a veteran experience, something that we should do, not just once a year.

174
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,439
but all the time as veterans can't help but do.

175
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:19,160
For myself, my two grandfathers both served in World War II, and I know they had experiences so traumatic that they never spoke about them for the rest of their lives.

176
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,021
I think about that so often.

177
00:32:21,061 --> 00:32:29,743
I think that Memorial Day is an important reminder of what we owe to veterans and people who have sacrificed for various reasons.

178
00:32:30,843 --> 00:32:37,344
What they continue to sacrifice and the lived experiences and memories that they don't reflect on once a year, they reflect on all the time.

179
00:32:37,604 --> 00:32:39,885
And I'm grateful to be in a city where we think about what that means

180
00:32:40,545 --> 00:32:55,731
for us for the other 364 days of the year, and how we can uplift life in our community for people who come from that background and people who have served and sacrificed in every ways, and especially in this.

181
00:32:58,448 --> 00:32:59,028
most total way.

182
00:32:59,289 --> 00:33:01,930
So thank you for putting this resolution forward.

183
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:06,152
I am glad that we as a community are observing Memorial Day on the day I'm glad that we talked about it.

184
00:33:06,172 --> 00:33:13,456
The Tuesday after, I'm really grateful to have a veteran services director who is doing such ambitious work on behalf of veterans in our community.

185
00:33:14,097 --> 00:33:14,337
Thank you.

186
00:33:15,998 --> 00:33:19,640
Thank you, Mr. President Collins Yes, thank you, Councilmember for putting this resolution forward.

187
00:33:20,463 --> 00:33:35,033
and for representing the council and thank you to our veteran services office and the mayor and her team and all of the volunteers from post 45 and everyone else who makes what happened yesterday.

188
00:33:35,433 --> 00:33:38,535
Kevin, I could, the band, I could go on and on and on.

189
00:33:38,635 --> 00:33:40,436
That event doesn't happen without a lot of people.

190
00:33:42,418 --> 00:33:48,401
And, you know, in my family, I mean, I have a cousin right now who's in the Air Force, but really the

191
00:33:49,523 --> 00:33:54,786
when I think about the sacrifice that people make.

192
00:33:55,207 --> 00:34:03,792
In my family, those sacrifices were in the World Wars, in World War I and World War II.

193
00:34:04,392 --> 00:34:09,936
And I think often on Memorial Day about Gettysburg Address.

194
00:34:10,056 --> 00:34:12,777
And I'm also very much drawn in this moment to

195
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:20,019
Why we asked people to make sacrifices and what were they sacrificing their lives for.

196
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,387
And, you know, Franklin Roosevelt speech in 1940 before the war about.

197
00:34:29,044 --> 00:34:35,528
building the arsenal of democracy to fight fascism stands with me in a very strong way.

198
00:34:35,548 --> 00:34:52,297
It has for a long time, but especially now, so many people gave their lives to fight fascism and far right extremism and genocide and these things that are just inhuman.

199
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,701
We need to honor that memory.

200
00:34:58,481 --> 00:35:10,646
So thank you for putting this resolution on on the motion of Council I mean to approve second by Councilor Collins was to please call the roll.

201
00:35:11,126 --> 00:35:11,347
Yes.

202
00:35:12,427 --> 00:35:23,312

242
00:39:29,611 --> 00:39:39,839
And to meet these appropriations, the sum of $205,200,573.76 to be raised and appropriated from the fiscal year 2026 tax levy and other general revenues of the city, and that $105,300 be transferred from the sale of cemetery lots, $257,756.40 be transferred from the cemetery perpetual care funds, and $185,034.84 be transferred from casino mitigation funds.

243
00:39:59,763 --> 00:40:03,586
Further, we have the Enterprise Fund, Water and Sewer Enterprise Budget, $26,996,930.

244
00:40:03,906 --> 00:40:05,508
Water and Sewer Bonds and Interests, $2,336,757.

245
00:40:05,548 --> 00:40:09,231
Further, that $29,333,687 be funded by anticipated revenue of the Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund.

246
00:40:09,251 --> 00:40:11,032
Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

247
00:40:28,954 --> 00:40:30,275
We're gonna let go current mayor.

248
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:33,256
We'll hear from the mayor in just a moment.

249
00:40:33,376 --> 00:40:39,679
And just to give introduction to the process, we did hear from some of our departments earlier tonight, as well as the Metro Public Schools.

250
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,222
We have had six preliminary budget meetings going over all of our departments.

251
00:40:44,522 --> 00:40:51,265
The council issued a series of recommendations to the mayor last month after our first preliminary budget meetings.

252
00:40:52,886 --> 00:40:56,168
And what will happen from here is we will take consideration of the budget.

253
00:40:57,648 --> 00:41:01,250
likely not finally voting at this meeting, but voting at a future meeting.

254
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:07,972
There will be some other associated papers for budgeted transfers and other items.

255
00:41:08,492 --> 00:41:17,776
And once we complete our process, then the school committee will take back up their budget based on the allocation finally voted here by the city council.

256
00:41:17,816 --> 00:41:20,617
And with that, I'll introduce the mayor, Breanna Lugo-Kirk.

257
00:41:26,211 --> 00:41:28,532
Thank you, President bears and city council.

258
00:41:29,752 --> 00:41:38,134
Before I begin, I just want to let you know Councilor Lemming and got an email today about how wonderful your remarks were yesterday so I figured I'd let you know that publicly.

259
00:41:39,814 --> 00:41:41,415
And thank you for all the team.

260
00:41:42,135 --> 00:41:48,916
Good evening and thank you President bears and counselors for allowing me some time to speak to you about the fiscal year 26 budget.

261
00:41:49,736 --> 00:41:55,858
Also, thank you for meeting with each department over the last several weeks to review each budget individually.

262
00:41:56,923 --> 00:42:09,312
Before I begin, I must take this opportunity to thank everybody who contributed to completing this budget and delivering it to your honorable body by the newly established deadline per the budget ordinance that you established.

263
00:42:10,572 --> 00:42:31,943
Compiling this comprehensive breakdown of the city's financial outlook took countless hours of preparation, debate, and insight from our department heads and our budget team, led by finance director Bob Dickinson, our former assistant finance director and budget director Courtney Cordello, and my team in the mayor's office, led by Chief of Staff Nina Nazarian, who is here with me tonight.

264
00:42:33,238 --> 00:42:44,492
I also want to give credit to our Communications Director Steve Smearty and Communications Specialist Emma Tombley for putting in so many hours of work on the nitty gritty aspects of the budget book that tend to get overlooked.

265
00:42:45,608 --> 00:42:58,278
Their work is invaluable, and will hopefully lead us to a third Distinguished Budget Award from the Government Finance Officers Association, after having received the award again last year for our fiscal year 25 budget.

266
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:03,182
It's a recognition we all, including this Council, I'm sure are extremely proud of.

267
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:07,633
Though sadly, this is the last budget that Courtney works on with us.

268
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:21,556
She is moving on to another position, but was gracious enough to stay on on a limited basis to assist with completing the compilation of this budget and allow time for our new assistance finance director to get acclimated to the role.

269
00:43:22,476 --> 00:43:23,917
Thank you, Courtney, for all your hard work.

270
00:43:24,017 --> 00:43:24,757
You will be missed.

271
00:43:26,918 --> 00:43:34,543
We enter fiscal year 26 in a somewhat familiar yet also much more secure position than previous budget cycles.

272
00:43:35,623 --> 00:43:49,252
Due to years of sound fiscal management coupled with newly injected revenue from the successful override votes last November, we're able to maintain our levels of service across our departments and also make targeted investments in key areas.

273
00:43:50,695 --> 00:43:55,697
That's not to say compiling and navigating this budget has been easy or without its hard decisions.

274
00:43:56,357 --> 00:44:03,099
It only means that for the first time in a while, we are not in need of right-sizing the budget with federal dollars or cash reserves.

275
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:10,401
This is partially due to the support the community has shown for the two ballot questions voted on this past fall.

276
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:18,024
Despite our community approving two proposed Proposition 2.5 ballot questions last fall,

277
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:27,814
I want to make clear that we are not managing our finances as though we suddenly have a windfall and can spend as freely as some of our more affluent neighboring cities.

278
00:44:28,635 --> 00:44:37,599
Instead, we are still bound by our tax revenue and are making targeted investments that will have the most long-term impact without over leveraging our operating budget.

279
00:44:38,899 --> 00:44:46,923
One key investment is in our engineering department, which is carrying an extremely high workload, with infrastructure maintenance increasing by roughly 400%.

280
00:44:49,723 --> 00:44:59,705
To help alleviate this burden, we had to have to hire a new position to the team that will assist with managing capital improvement projects on and under our streets and sidewalks.

281
00:45:00,905 --> 00:45:06,626
This is just the beginning of a multi-year plan to decrease the backlog of much needed upgrades throughout the city.

282
00:45:07,626 --> 00:45:17,228
The upgrades will consist of water main upgrades in low pressure areas, street and sidewalk work, lead line removals in our environmental justice designated areas,

283
00:45:18,147 --> 00:45:23,350
removal of sewer inflow and infiltration and localized drainage improvement in flood prone areas.

284
00:45:24,411 --> 00:45:30,875
There's hundreds of millions of dollars worth of work needed, so it is imperative we have a staff to manage it all next year in the years to come.

285
00:45:32,395 --> 00:45:41,341
Our streets are highly traveled both by cars and pedestrians, which is why improving safety measures for all modes of transportation is also extremely important.

286
00:45:42,363 --> 00:45:55,149
In collaboration with MassDOT, we've advanced plans to reconstruct high crash intersections along Main Street, specifically where it intersects with South Street, Mystic Valley Parkway, Route 16 ramps, and Mystic Avenue.

287
00:45:56,310 --> 00:46:10,977
This project will reduce vehicle speeds while also improving ADA-compliant sidewalks and curb ramps, and add separate and buffered bike lanes, all in an effort to enhance accessibility and deliver a safer travel experience.

288
00:46:13,463 --> 00:46:28,121
In addition to the work done on the city side, the fiscal year 26 budget reflects a strategic investment in education is funding focuses on maintaining staffing levels and evaluating needs across the backdrop of an extension to the instructional day.

289
00:46:29,182 --> 00:46:31,445
Additionally, we're addressing critical infrastructure needs.

290
00:46:32,917 --> 00:46:44,363
With the city council support the school committee has advanced repairs for the Andrews and McGlynn schools, targeting malfunctioning HVAC systems, as well as security and it upgrades throughout our entire district.

291
00:46:45,464 --> 00:46:51,667
These efforts are part of a broader initiative to ensure safe and conducive learning environments for our students.

292
00:46:52,962 --> 00:47:01,267
The school budget is almost always the most difficult one to develop, as there are several critical needs throughout our educational system, like the ones I just mentioned.

293
00:47:01,988 --> 00:47:13,995
But there are also significant challenges like the rise in costs that require not only hard decisions but comprehensive financial planning by both the school administration, city council, school committee and city hall.

294
00:47:15,662 --> 00:47:28,885
The Medford public school fiscal year 26 budget reflects a significant increase over of over $9.5 million supported by state aid, equating to an over 12.6% rise compared to fiscal year 25.

295
00:47:30,265 --> 00:47:39,087
This increase is primarily driven by heightened expenses and special education, particularly in transportation and tuition, which have substantial rate hikes.

296
00:47:39,891 --> 00:47:47,878
The district anticipates a $557,000 increase to transportation costs due to a new special education transportation contract.

297
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:53,884
Both the schools in the city are also facing a significant rise in operational expenses.

298
00:47:54,980 --> 00:48:11,250
Healthcare costs for city employees are projected to increase by 10% again this year, potentially consuming revenue from new growth of approximately $2.5 million and forcing us to reevaluate investments in programming and services.

299
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:13,471
This is not unique to Medford.

300
00:48:14,011 --> 00:48:20,355
Healthcare costs are rising across the country, but it certainly is a challenge that we must overcome in the upcoming fiscal year.

301
00:48:21,758 --> 00:48:27,985
Despite budget constraints, we are still making incredible progress across so many areas that are driving our growth.

302
00:48:29,047 --> 00:48:41,782
We are making significant investment in several core city systems, maintaining as much service as possible and providing a sustainable roadmap for future big ticket expenditures like a new Medford High School.

303
00:48:43,543 --> 00:48:51,490
We're continuing to make more substantial investments in our library and increasing its budget by nearly 5% with the support of state aid.

304
00:48:52,571 --> 00:49:03,021
Our continued commitment to prioritizing the needs of our library has allowed everyone in our community to gain more access to the resources and programs that our fabulous library offers.

305
00:49:04,964 --> 00:49:10,667
As I said, the workload at the fleet, the feet of our team in the engineering department is immense.

306
00:49:11,367 --> 00:49:16,290
And that undoubtedly overlaps with the work being done by our staff in the Department of Public Works.

307
00:49:17,378 --> 00:49:39,451
We're increasing the DPW's budget by nearly $1.2 million, which will help keep up with increased costs and services, as well as give us more flexibility as we continue to address stump removal, tree pruning and repair, as well as updates to our aging water infrastructure and improvements in accessibility and pedestrian mobility in our squares and green spaces.

308
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:49,624
In addition to investing in our public infrastructure, we're also been working to enhance and upgrade many of our public spaces for the community to utilize and enjoy.

309
00:49:50,625 --> 00:49:53,687
Gillis Park is one of many that opened last year.

310
00:49:54,327 --> 00:49:59,950
Car Park phase two renovation is being worked on with the dog park already open for the public to enjoy.

311
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:04,312
We're wrapping up a project at Morrison Park to upgrade the fencing and dugouts.

312
00:50:05,332 --> 00:50:10,095
Logan Park is getting a facelift with a new pathway, natural play area and a tree sculpture.

313
00:50:11,654 --> 00:50:20,741
I thank the team in our Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability, along with the staff at Medford Recreation for working so diligently on all these projects and many more.

314
00:50:22,302 --> 00:50:30,949
With so many wonderful upgrades to our public spaces, it's important that we ensure our team and recreation are properly equipped and staffed appropriately.

315
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:41,117
To ensure this, we are adding a part-time office manager to offset some of the duties from our full-time staff to allow them to focus on expanding our programming

316
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:47,094
including our inclusive programming and developing more accessible youth and young adult activities.

317
00:50:48,815 --> 00:50:54,640
This past year, we also unveiled our newly universal accessible schoolyard at the McGlynn School.

318
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:05,368
The playground goes above Federal American with Disabilities Act accessibility standards and was designed and built with input from stakeholders well-versed in accessibility play structures.

319
00:51:06,758 --> 00:51:15,485
We're continuing to work towards goals laid out in our Climate Action and Adaptation Plan and are committed to making sustainable practices more accessible for our residents.

320
00:51:16,806 --> 00:51:24,433
To add to this endeavor, we have partnered with Garbage to Garden to launch a free municipal curbside composting program for eligible residents.

321
00:51:25,594 --> 00:51:34,862
Now, nearly a year into the launch, the program is widely accessible and convenient, making it easy for residents to participate in creating a greener, more sustainable future.

322
00:51:35,908 --> 00:51:45,291
To date we have nearly 6700 active participants enrolled and are well positioned to hit our goal of 10,000 signups by the end of fiscal year 26.

323
00:51:45,451 --> 00:51:55,115
I'm grateful to our team in the Office of Prevention and Outreach and the Board of Health for once again receiving a municipal vulnerability preparedness grant.

324
00:51:57,018 --> 00:52:01,740
of $750,000 to fund our exemplary Medford Connects program.

325
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:15,825
This program was designed to help connect our most vulnerable residents to essential city resources and funds a wide variety of programs and events throughout the city, including our amazing multilingual and multicultural community engagement team.

326
00:52:17,365 --> 00:52:25,168
Our MVP project has been such a success that is the model that the state uses for other cities to repeat.

327
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:40,794
Building off the work and guidance of our MedFedConnects team, our nearly $1 million grant from the federal government to transform the Hagener Center into a municipal vulnerability preparedness site, as well as a facility for after school programming, is moving forward full steam ahead.

328
00:52:41,695 --> 00:52:48,737
Our team is compiling the materials needed to submit to HUD and working with Congresswoman Clark's office to ensure this project is completed.

329
00:52:50,205 --> 00:52:54,089
While emergency preparedness is an essential sector of our work and prevention and outreach.

330
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:59,254
There are many in our community who need resources and mental health supports right now.

331
00:53:00,095 --> 00:53:11,666
That's where a social worker and recovery team comes in and works in tandem with our connectors and liaisons to direct those in need with resources and programs that can get them the assistance they need to thrive.

332
00:53:12,807 --> 00:53:31,218
Our electrify Medford program is up and running making gains throughout the community strengthening support specifically for underrepresented and underserved residents interested in decarbonizing their homes and vehicles through energy efficiency, solar and electrification of heating, water heating appliances and electric vehicles.

333
00:53:32,178 --> 00:53:40,721
The team has been out walking the streets to raise awareness for the program is in set in setting up coaching sessions to help people navigate their heating and cooling needs.

334
00:53:41,962 --> 00:53:51,045
As part of our commitment to residents we are always looking for ways to expand diversity equity inclusion throughout our city and create an environment of belonging for the entire community.

335
00:53:52,075 --> 00:53:58,058
DEI has been working with human resources to update best practices for recruiting, interviewing, and hiring.

336
00:53:58,918 --> 00:54:06,721
Due to this work, the city has been able to recruit, hire, and retain highly qualified, diverse candidates for a variety of city positions.

337
00:54:07,642 --> 00:54:18,567
This team also hosts trainings and other professional development opportunities to ensure employees have the tools they need to uphold our values and mission, something that will be enhanced and continued through fiscal year 26.

338
00:54:20,577 --> 00:54:31,980
Our DEI office has also made a concerted effort to equip many events with ASL interpreters, enabling those in our community who use sign language to better engage with city services and programming.

339
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:40,662
On the development side, our plan to revitalize and activate Medford Square near Clippership Drive has taken a major step forward.

340
00:54:41,631 --> 00:54:58,565
We have selected development company transcom real estate as a partner in the city's project to transform three underdeveloped undeveloped city on lots behind city hall into a combination of mixed use retail and residential with ample parking for our seniors and Chevalier theater.

341
00:54:59,954 --> 00:55:16,604
The project as proposed will combine the creation of market rate and affordable housing anchored with a 13,500 square foot grocery store, all in the context of a village square environment that prioritizes the pedestrian experience with beautiful public art and landscaping.

342
00:55:17,444 --> 00:55:23,648
This proposal dynamically addresses the city's multifaceted objectives outlined in the RFP.

343
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:30,880
creating a vibrant new community hub in Medford Square that is consistent with the objectives in the city's comprehensive plan.

344
00:55:32,201 --> 00:55:39,708
We will make further adjustments and improvements to this proposal, as well as negotiate a final land lease agreement over the next several months.

345
00:55:40,348 --> 00:55:44,292
And the final agreement will be presented to the city council for consideration and approval.

346
00:55:45,673 --> 00:55:52,239
With the activation of the square underway, the next logical step is to expand our pedestrian paths along the Mystic River waterfront.

347
00:55:53,212 --> 00:56:03,333
The Clipper Ship Connector is opening this summer, according to the Department of Conservation and Recreation, and will create a path that connects over 10 miles of continuous greenways along the waterfront.

348
00:56:04,285 --> 00:56:13,249
In 2025, we continue to embrace public art as a means to enrich our community spaces, foster local identity, and engage residents across generations.

349
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:22,214
A series of mural projects and public art initiatives have been launched throughout the city, reflecting Medford's commitment to creativity, inclusivity, and civic pride.

350
00:56:23,194 --> 00:56:32,419
In the past year, we've also seen our art scene flourish with over 2,500 cultural events, more than double the amount six years ago.

351
00:56:33,718 --> 00:56:50,363
In fiscal year 25 we saw the opening of one of the most anticipated restaurants and event spaces, with the unveiling of the great American beer hall, the 17,000 square foot space is already a destination for our region, and is has contributed heavily to expanding our commercial tax base.

352
00:56:51,565 --> 00:56:56,371
While focusing on our commercial development is critically important to both our growth and expanding our tax base.

353
00:56:57,232 --> 00:57:06,765
We are also deeply, deeply focusing on working to help solve the housing crisis that is afflicting, not just Medford but the greater Boston region, the Commonwealth in the country.

354
00:57:08,002 --> 00:57:23,159
We are actively addressing housing affordability, along with the council's help through a multifaceted strategy that combines funding mechanisms, the city council zoning reforms and development initiatives to expand access to affordable housing.

355
00:57:24,185 --> 00:57:43,220
Through successful negotiation, we gain leverage with our 40 B developers to bring more community benefits to the planning process, like better pedestrian accessibility, reduction of potential traffic congestion, more open space, more access to public transportation, and more affordable housing units with a priority for Medford residents.

356
00:57:44,641 --> 00:57:52,568
We're making a concerted effort to care for and support our sizable veteran population through a number of comprehensive programs and projects.

357
00:57:53,908 --> 00:58:03,276
As we all know, housing is at a premium and especially challenging to afford for our veterans, many of whom rely on financial assistance from a host of government agencies.

358
00:58:04,177 --> 00:58:14,926
That's why I'm proud of the work being done by the City Council, the Veterans Service Office, and for the successful passage of the Landlord Incentive Program.

359
00:58:15,906 --> 00:58:22,272
This initiative offers landlords up to $750 annually for renting to qualified Medford veterans.

360
00:58:23,439 --> 00:58:33,549
Administered in collaboration with the nonprofit housing families, the program seeks to reduce barriers veterans face in securing housing, such as credit challenges or income discrimination.

361
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:44,460
By encouraging landlords to provide stable housing options, it's our hope that we're able to facilitate successful reintegration of veterans into civilian life in our community.

362
00:58:46,541 --> 00:59:00,811
And as I'm sure you all know, this was a brief overview, I will stop soon, of all the work we all have done over the past year and the investments we've made that will help build on the vision we share and the work that we'll continue to do into fiscal year 26.

363
00:59:02,552 --> 00:59:12,880
Everything we do, of course, is not linked to one department or a handful of staff, but felt across our entire workforce and undoubtedly linked to all the work you do here in the chamber.

364
00:59:14,148 --> 00:59:19,849
Our city is at its best when we collaborate and lean on one another for insight advice and constructive criticism.

365
00:59:20,729 --> 00:59:25,730
I'm proud of everything we've accomplished together and I look forward to our continued partnership and teamwork.

366
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:28,491
Thank you for allowing me the time.

367
00:59:28,511 --> 00:59:37,372
I know I'm always lengthy but thank you for allowing me the time and I'm here to Nina Nazarian chief of staff and I are here to answer any questions you may have of myself.

368
00:59:39,212 --> 00:59:42,473
Thank you, Mayor, do we have questions for the mayor on the budget submission.

369
00:59:47,612 --> 00:59:48,092
Councilor Lemming.

370
00:59:50,714 --> 01:00:05,163
This is something that, full disclosure, I already brought up to Nina before the meeting, but we have been working with a number of parents on this exact issue, so I would like to have some public discussion on it.

371
01:00:05,744 --> 01:00:10,427
I'll also acknowledge that I was absent from the meeting that

372
01:00:13,387 --> 01:00:15,328
this council had with Kevin Bailey.

373
01:00:15,668 --> 01:00:28,512
But so I do very much appreciate the addition of the office manager position part-time for 20, I believe 27,500 to the Medford rec department.

374
01:00:30,073 --> 01:00:40,737
The concern I had, especially working with the parents who really do want to see, who really do want to see afterschool programs for their kids.

375
01:00:40,777 --> 01:00:41,537
And I'd also like to

376
01:00:42,618 --> 01:00:57,779
Thank Councilor Scarpelli as well for his, for his work on on this is that we, the, the impression I got was that an additional full time therapeutic recreation specialist would really help out.

377
01:00:59,783 --> 01:01:15,572
in actually making these programs a reality just in the sense that they did need that is my impression that Kevin really did need more staffing in order to do that with the ambition being that it would that they would end up founding a more regional program and collaboration with.

378
01:01:16,952 --> 01:01:18,372
Malden and Somerville as well.

379
01:01:18,933 --> 01:01:30,835
And my fear is that although the office manager is a big addition because it takes a lot of work off of Kevin's hands that they might need more staffing to make that a reality.

380
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:41,718
So I'd appreciate any conversation about that as well as just future plans for how those parents could be served in the future.

381
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:42,860
Sure, sure.

382
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:55,248
Thank you for the question console let me thank you all for advocating for additional staffing and recreation I know the city school committee is also working on enhancements in the school department.

383
01:01:56,391 --> 01:02:01,456
And I think we're definitely glad the parents did come speak to the council.

384
01:02:01,476 --> 01:02:16,369
I was lucky to be joined by Councilor Scarpelli and Chief of Staff Nina Nazarian with a few parents last week to for me to better understand the needs, because I saw it as more need for more teen program.

385
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:18,510
inclusive programming.

386
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:34,613
And then I also see it as the age range that is aging out of high school so you know that 2122 to 25 year olds that also need support and inclusive programming so what we are doing is adding the office, we're doing a few things.

387
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:42,195
First, I think Somerville Malden and Medford for working together you see these collaborations throughout the state and they do work.

388
01:02:43,195 --> 01:02:47,477
So Medford I know Kevin is big with aquatics Danny has his specialties.

389
01:02:48,697 --> 01:02:58,521
And so being able to work with Medford Somerville and Malden, we should be able to have a full range of offerings for our young adults 13 through 25 plus.

390
01:03:00,965 --> 01:03:10,947
We also are implementing that part time office managers to free up the three full time staff we do have that actually create and administer the programming.

391
01:03:10,967 --> 01:03:22,130
And I think that will alleviate a lot of the nitty gritty work that is done on the computer, hours and hours a day, so that they can offer and create ways to create more programming.

392
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:41,760
I'm also hearing from the parents like yourselves that they do hope that, and I didn't really hear it till last week, I thought it was more REC, but I think they're looking for somebody in the city to kind of oversee all inclusive programming, like find out what's going on in the library, what's going on in REC, what's going on at our senior center.

393
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:50,165
So there's one central person that's kind of overseeing it and make sure we're offering needs from zero to our seniors.

394
01:03:51,666 --> 01:04:04,974
So what we have, what I'm going to do is I sent an email to a whole list of staff members, our DEI office, our connectors program, we do have a connector, her name's June.

395
01:04:05,394 --> 01:04:09,116
She's a connector for our seniors and persons with disabilities.

396
01:04:09,496 --> 01:04:16,521
So I'm going to kind of bring that team together and try to make sure that somebody takes the lead and whether it's June or somebody in DEI,

397
01:04:17,101 --> 01:04:26,923
just to make sure we have some oversight over every department and make sure we're offering as much as we possibly can along with the partnership with Malden and Somerville.

398
01:04:27,343 --> 01:04:40,546
So I think we do have some staffing that we can tap into, some monthly coordinated meetings that aren't happening now between departments, and we can make sure we're accomplishing those goals for the parents that have reached out to all of us.

399
01:04:41,146 --> 01:04:43,467
So yes, I mean, you see the budget.

400
01:04:44,627 --> 01:04:45,567
We're taking in a few,

401
01:04:46,729 --> 01:04:51,081
remaining positions in different ways, like 10% here or there for different positions.

402
01:04:51,685 --> 01:05:09,596
in planning, but our budget we were able to increase by 1.5 plus the new library position that we're using, you know, work conveniently with Barbara and do a new children's librarian, but there really isn't room in the budget to add five, 10, 15 positions.

403
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:13,859
So we're do our best to listen to all department heads, figure out what the needs are.

404
01:05:13,939 --> 01:05:19,963
And I think we're gonna make great progress with that additional 0.5 and the current city staff and the partnership.

405
01:05:20,703 --> 01:05:24,029
for all of our residents that need more inclusive programming.

406
01:05:24,891 --> 01:05:25,232
Thank you.

407
01:05:25,552 --> 01:05:25,873
Thank you.

408
01:05:26,815 --> 01:05:28,338
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

409
01:05:30,725 --> 01:05:31,386
Thank you, President Barras.

410
01:05:31,406 --> 01:05:31,886
Thank you, Mayor.

411
01:05:31,906 --> 01:05:32,266
Thank you.

412
01:05:32,286 --> 01:05:33,668
Really appreciate your presentation.

413
01:05:33,928 --> 01:05:44,177
And just want to thank you and your staff, Chief of Staff Nazarian, Finance Director Bob Dickinson, and everybody else who I know worked really hard to put this together.

414
01:05:44,417 --> 01:05:48,461
And thank you for the ongoing collaboration with the budget ordinance.

415
01:05:49,302 --> 01:05:56,068
It is really great to get a budget proposal with a really comfortable amount of time to continue to absorb and digest and discuss

416
01:05:57,128 --> 01:06:03,550
everything that goes along with it so that's been a really wonderful evolution to get to participate in over the past few years.

417
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:05,171
Thank you very much for your partnership on that.

418
01:06:08,352 --> 01:06:17,715
Thank you for creating the budget ordinance I think it's given us a tie like almost a timeline so it's helped us collaborate but it's also been helpful on our side to really come a long way.

419
01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:18,595
We have.

420
01:06:24,449 --> 01:06:31,853
Yeah, I think it helps all of us when we have a structure that we can mutually rely on and predict.

421
01:06:33,794 --> 01:06:37,475
And I think that's a great example of the collaboration that you were talking about in your closing remarks.

422
01:06:37,515 --> 01:06:44,719
I think residents love good TV, but I think residents love more to see different branches of government collaborating.

423
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:59,973
Good things happen we collaborate, even when it's hard it's so much better than we do when we do think the creation of the stabilization funds last year and the passage of question seven and eight are just wonderful evidence of that and it's great to see those bearing fruit in this year's budget proposal.

424
01:07:02,175 --> 01:07:07,377
In regards to the budget proposal that you've introduced us to tonight I think we're off to a really good start.

425
01:07:08,138 --> 01:07:18,122
This is an operating budget that does not significant really sorry significantly rely on one time funding, which, you know, we've all been through the past few fiscal years together.

426
01:07:18,962 --> 01:07:22,045
And that is a really refreshing thing to respond to.

427
01:07:22,065 --> 01:07:38,200
That's a product of a lot of hard work by a lot of people in City Hall on your team and a lot of people on this council, and the hard work of everybody who campaigned for the overrides and the willingness of the majority of Medford voters to say yes to investing in our schools and our shared infrastructure.

428
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:51,827
The passage of questions seven and eight directly allowed us to fund new positions within the DPW and to balance the school's budget, meaning that we do not have to balance this on forced district-wide personnel cuts, which I'm gonna say a couple of times this evening, because I'm just so happy about it.

429
01:07:52,028 --> 01:07:52,668
It's really great.

430
01:07:53,048 --> 01:08:01,033
And we have a little bit further to go on the school's budget, as we know from the presentation earlier, but it's great to see that number become more and more approachable.

431
01:08:03,234 --> 01:08:08,057
For me, as we collaboratively put ARPA and ESSER further and further into the rear view,

432
01:08:08,797 --> 01:08:14,203
I think all of us we want to see Medford operate sustainably we want to see it emerge from austerity bunch budgeting.

433
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:17,887
We want to fund our infrastructure and our services the way that residents deserve.

434
01:08:18,588 --> 01:08:26,657
We want to begin to make bolder and bolder strides on our capital needs and sustainably add capacity to our operating budgets at the same time.

435
01:08:27,297 --> 01:08:29,340
So given the hard work and the very genuine

436
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:35,246
progress that we have made on stabilizing the operating budget in the last fiscal year.

437
01:08:35,667 --> 01:08:40,953
I think that now is a really important opportunity to emphasize the capital investments side.

438
01:08:40,973 --> 01:08:51,325
In the past several years we have seen the city's free cash reserves amass and we've done great work together in allocating that in really intentional specific ways into our various stabilization funds.

439
01:08:52,166 --> 01:08:57,632
I think that now is the time to go even further and we've talked about this we talked about this collaboratively with the financial task force.

440
01:08:58,133 --> 01:09:07,864
And I think that a really exciting and really important accompaniment to the passage of the fiscal 26 budget proposal this year will be.

441
01:09:10,587 --> 01:09:31,284
a specific plan for allocating much of the remainder of our free cash reserves into our various stabilization accounts of which we have several, due to the passage of a couple more that we collaborated on last year for myself as one counselor won't speak for other counselors even though I know a lot of us feel the same way it is a really happy occasion to get to translate that

442
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:49,333
ever annoying and confusing term free cash into being able to say, we are investing this amount of money in this fund because we use it for this purpose and be able to speak to the questions and the concerns that residents bring to all of us around and say, we know

443
01:09:50,093 --> 01:09:54,959
We hear you, it's been in the capital improvement plan and we are making this allocation for that purpose.

444
01:09:55,320 --> 01:10:04,031
I know this is something that you and your team and working hard on curious if you could speak a little bit more to how that is shaping up the timeline of that submissions that we can make sure these two things go hand in hand this year.

445
01:10:04,231 --> 01:10:04,772
Sure, sure.

446
01:10:04,812 --> 01:10:08,757
Yeah, we actually have a big whiteboard on the probably

447
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:16,673
25 to 30 papers we have to get before you in June between your two meetings, sorry.

448
01:10:17,394 --> 01:10:20,635
But some of those papers are capital expenses.

449
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:22,516
I think there's a project or two for the schools.

450
01:10:23,137 --> 01:10:29,200
I know there's the nexus study that the councils in the Affordable Housing Trust has been asking for.

451
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:31,381
So we're going to put that paper before you.

452
01:10:31,401 --> 01:10:36,404
We're also going to replenish the stabilization accounts.

453
01:10:37,424 --> 01:10:46,329
And I think what we'll end up seeing left on this, I'd like to call it a reserve fund, a rainy day emergency fund.

454
01:10:47,229 --> 01:10:48,990
We'll probably have about 10 to 12 left.

455
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:52,872
So we will have a full updated pre-cash plan.

456
01:10:53,773 --> 01:10:57,815
My office did one right around the October timeframe, 2024.

457
01:10:58,215 --> 01:11:03,397
We'll have an updated chart for you along with all these papers before you in June.

458
01:11:04,638 --> 01:11:05,018
Great.

459
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:05,599
Thank you.

460
01:11:05,739 --> 01:11:06,319
You're welcome.

461
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:09,160
Thank you, Mayor.

462
01:11:10,342 --> 01:11:13,985
And we can talk about which ones are for the 10th and which ones are for the 24th.

463
01:11:14,045 --> 01:11:17,068
So, yes, we don't make you do them all in two weeks.

464
01:11:17,609 --> 01:11:19,230
Councilor Lozaro and then Councilor Singh.

465
01:11:20,351 --> 01:11:21,853
My comment is a similar one.

466
01:11:22,774 --> 01:11:26,878
I just wanted to, again, thank you for the budget.

467
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:29,721
Big, beautiful budget.

468
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:33,067
I'm feeling a little loopy already.

469
01:11:33,107 --> 01:11:33,908
It's not even that late.

470
01:11:35,988 --> 01:11:36,988
I think it was the music.

471
01:11:37,028 --> 01:11:37,868
It was just really nice.

472
01:11:38,968 --> 01:11:58,892
The thing that I was really prioritizing when coming into this was public safety and hoping that we could allow the fire department after kind of a wonky sort of community relations moment to

473
01:12:01,782 --> 01:12:30,352
give a boost that would make everybody in the community, everybody in the fire department feel like we were reconnecting, we were moving forward in a way that was allowing the fire department to feel like they were able to be like really a cohesive, high morale, you know, a department with a leader that's really forward thinking and clear eyed about

474
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:35,300
what needs to improve and how to do it.

475
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:40,425
And sort of a first step in that direction was something that I talked with the chief about, which was the dive team.

476
01:12:41,146 --> 01:12:42,127
You and I talked about it.

477
01:12:42,287 --> 01:12:46,832
It's not in the budget, but I wanted to give you the opportunity to sort of talk about where there are

478
01:12:47,652 --> 01:12:51,735
avenues that we could, you know, access funds to pay for that.

479
01:12:51,855 --> 01:12:58,540
And there's an estimate that the chief has that is that the dive team would cost about $120,000.

480
01:12:59,381 --> 01:13:05,385
It's not entirely one time, but it really like, you know, it pays for dry suits, it pays for training.

481
01:13:06,145 --> 01:13:14,391
There are a few people that have started training on their own fully, like, you know, like started it with self funded because there was an incident in Medford, where

482
01:13:15,752 --> 01:13:26,379
a young man drowned and they couldn't, you know, we didn't have folks in our fighter department that had training, we didn't have the suits, we didn't have the boats, we didn't have like any of the equipment.

483
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:36,945
And then after that, because we had to call in teams from that city, after that, a few people took it upon themselves to start, you know, a training program.

484
01:13:37,545 --> 01:13:43,149
So this estimate was for concluding the training, having a 12 person team, so that

485
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:58,444
There would always be three people on rotation available at all times in a fire in like on staff, so it wouldn't be over time, it would just be always three people available to do to be on call and.

486
01:14:02,067 --> 01:14:02,948
the equipment.

487
01:14:03,528 --> 01:14:16,536
So $120,000, kind of one time, but it would be, you know, I think it's like 10 years down the line, you have to renew the suits, but it feels to me like that is something closer to one time than something that is in an operating budget on an ongoing basis.

488
01:14:16,616 --> 01:14:22,960
But I just wanted to, like, ask you what you think would be a way to access funds for something like that.

489
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:23,860
Yep, thank you.

490
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:31,525
Thank you for advocating and thank you for trying to help us help me and the chief, you know, build that relationship back we've made really good gains.

491
01:14:32,206 --> 01:14:43,933
We've had some great promotions recently so I'm chief Evans is off and running and doing, doing a really good job and I can tell the changes that are happening so appreciate you helping in any way you can as a counselor.

492
01:14:45,074 --> 01:14:48,136
I think what we have what we're doing in June with the 25 papers or so.

493
01:14:51,564 --> 01:14:53,185
is my next step.

494
01:14:53,346 --> 01:15:01,673
And then I think I mentioned to a few of you that there is probably, you know, every other department is coming coming at us for to work on this capital improvement.

495
01:15:01,953 --> 01:15:05,075
We have 2 million in requests to be spent from the DPW.

496
01:15:05,476 --> 01:15:13,803
So what we're going to do, starting probably end of June into July is figuring out all those requests, including that one because we're taking it seriously.

497
01:15:13,823 --> 01:15:13,883
And

498
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:18,041
not update fully our capital improvement plan.

499
01:15:18,061 --> 01:15:28,567
We have the call-in center come and do that, usually biannually, but we have to see where we're at, see what we have in the stabilization accounts, and make sure we're providing our departments with what they need.

500
01:15:28,947 --> 01:15:30,628
And that's included in my list.

501
01:15:30,688 --> 01:15:31,488
It's on my desk.

502
01:15:31,548 --> 01:15:36,411
I get free cash requests, I have papers for June, and then my July and August work.

503
01:15:36,751 --> 01:15:38,332
So I kind of take things in stages because we

504
01:15:39,024 --> 01:15:44,545
between my office and what all the work City Council's doing, I think we all have very, very full plate.

505
01:15:44,585 --> 01:15:50,446
So we're trying to take it one step at a time, but I'm glad we had that conversation and that's on my radar.

506
01:15:50,907 --> 01:15:51,107
So.

507
01:15:54,047 --> 01:15:54,687
Great, thank you.

508
01:15:55,507 --> 01:15:56,048
Councilor Sang.

509
01:15:57,608 --> 01:16:02,429
Thank you, Madam Mayor for coming and presenting this budget and being so thorough in your comments.

510
01:16:03,609 --> 01:16:07,210
I appreciate that crafting a budget is always

511
01:16:07,934 --> 01:16:08,174
tough.

512
01:16:09,074 --> 01:16:13,516
It requires making tough choices and saying yes and no to certain projects.

513
01:16:14,876 --> 01:16:27,239
I'm grateful, especially to the voters, but I'm grateful in general that this year we're in a better position than the previous years, certainly much smoother this year in my memory compared to previous years.

514
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:28,320
And

515
01:16:30,394 --> 01:16:43,469
You know, I appreciate that we're truly making some historical, historic progress, especially in the schools, but, but, including investments in DPW and recovering what we've lost over, you know, decades of austerity.

516
01:16:44,438 --> 01:16:46,059
and making progress on that.

517
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:51,602
Now, there's still a long way to go, and I think residents recognize that as well.

518
01:16:53,603 --> 01:17:05,229
We, as a city council, through the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, put out a public feedback form with regards to what people were looking for from this budget.

519
01:17:06,570 --> 01:17:12,133
And through just the whole budget crafting process, we've received a lot of feedback.

520
01:17:12,233 --> 01:17:13,614
A lot of it is about infrastructure.

521
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:20,961
and about improving roads, improving road safety for cyclists and pedestrians as well.

522
01:17:22,142 --> 01:17:42,186
And I think that's why in our city council budget recommendations, we included funding or requests for funding for an additional traffic engineer, for staff positions, for restriping, adjusting signal timing, patching potholes,

523
01:17:43,106 --> 01:17:54,031
and shrinking the repair backlog and also just more money to install and maintain road safety markings, signage and bike related equipment.

524
01:17:55,071 --> 01:18:08,477
I was wondering what progress we can expect to make this year with regards to those like infrastructure and traffic safety improvements, what we might not be able to get this year and how we can plan the budget for that going forward.

525
01:18:09,383 --> 01:18:18,985
Yeah, I think one of the biggest things is the assistant traffic engineer and I may not have that title 100% perfectly, but I could be corrected corrected.

526
01:18:19,005 --> 01:18:25,987
It was held by somebody over a year ago and we have posted it twice.

527
01:18:26,447 --> 01:18:29,708
We just recently took that down and we're going to adjust it again.

528
01:18:30,248 --> 01:18:41,994
to try to fill that role that would be somebody under Todd and Owen and the engineering department for traffic related matters which are important to all of us I know I've seen you on the walks.

529
01:18:42,575 --> 01:18:44,896
And I know we have, you know, some.

530
01:18:45,636 --> 01:18:53,801
trouble spots that DCR, MassDOT are helping us with, but we need the in-house staff for the rest of our roads and the safety improvements that need to be made.

531
01:18:54,282 --> 01:19:00,426
We're progressively doing work on our streets and streets, but we could always use that second person.

532
01:19:00,946 --> 01:19:05,989
So Director Blake actually emailed me today to discuss the new job description.

533
01:19:06,049 --> 01:19:07,690
So we'll be meeting with him very soon.

534
01:19:08,131 --> 01:19:11,233
And I really hope to fill that position sometime over the summer.

535
01:19:12,125 --> 01:19:27,713
So that's, I think, I hope that answered part of your question I know the water sewer sidewalk, all the major projects like I said in my message 400% we are up on the work we are doing and the amount of engineers that we have.

536
01:19:28,173 --> 01:19:43,783
cannot handle that that amount of work so that is the one position that it wasn't even a, should we put this position and we, we had to to be able to maintain the projects that we have this construction season and that we have planned for next construction season and the construction seasons.

537
01:19:44,604 --> 01:19:48,886
After that, there's just between water and sewer work lead line replacement.

538
01:19:49,927 --> 01:20:10,229
streets sidewalks it's I think there's another something I'm missing but it's overwhelming it's hundreds of millions of dollars and it's it's overwhelming and we we are starting to message that we have an eight million dollar it's it's a loan but hopefully part of that will be a grant through the MWRA

539
01:20:10,894 --> 01:20:14,740
That 8 million will only touch 20% of our lead lines.

540
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:22,130
So you're talking 50 million alone that needs to be spent on our lead lines to change them out throughout our entire community.

541
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:26,216
And that takes personnel and we need that engineer.

542
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:47,673
So, so we are making those investments we read your we read all of your requests, and we knew that was that was one of them streets and sidewalks we hear a lot, and on the management side, we're, we're working every day and I'm got a meeting scheduled you know just to make sure we're keeping up with see click fix and we're keeping up with managing our staff and things are getting done.

543
01:20:48,607 --> 01:20:48,987
Thank you.

544
01:20:50,970 --> 01:21:01,662
Obviously I think infrastructure is always an ongoing conversation so anything that you know what what goes through my mind is how can we plan long term to get those positions that we need and.

545
01:21:04,175 --> 01:21:09,642
Commissioner McIvern was here earlier today talking about how there's still positions in DPW, we need to fill.

546
01:21:10,022 --> 01:21:21,677
So I think a priority for this council now and going forward, especially, is about how can we make, how can we fill those positions, because it's so important to get the, you know, people in the office.

547
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,404
I don't want to steal the thunder from Councillor Callaghan.

548
01:21:26,484 --> 01:21:31,131
I know she's been working on a volunteer tree planting program as well.

549
01:21:31,272 --> 01:21:38,002
And I was wondering what capacity we might have in this budget to get that off the ground.

550
01:21:38,907 --> 01:21:48,052
I did meet with Councillor Callahan, it's been a little bit over a month and I loved her idea so I think, I think that too is on my list for capital.

551
01:21:48,072 --> 01:21:53,174
I think whatever additional money we want to meet our tree goals and now without being able to.

552
01:21:55,143 --> 01:21:59,529
invest ARPA funds into those additional trees that we need to plant.

553
01:21:59,809 --> 01:22:03,194
We've been doing consistently over 200 a year the last several years.

554
01:22:03,234 --> 01:22:04,395
I want to keep to that.

555
01:22:04,435 --> 01:22:09,242
So I would hope to have something before you over the summer to meet our tree goals.

556
01:22:11,227 --> 01:22:27,776
Um, we also talked at our first committee the whole meeting about updating our financial software because we don't necessarily, the system that Medford uses is really archaic and it's, it's hard for people coming, you know, coming to Medford to work to use the system.

557
01:22:27,836 --> 01:22:32,759
It's also slowing down, you know, payments to workers and especially when we do

558
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:36,802
retro, and that, you know, affects morale as well.

559
01:22:37,642 --> 01:22:45,829
I was wondering what we might be able to see in the upcoming year about getting us to a place where we maybe look at new options for software.

560
01:22:45,849 --> 01:22:53,655
I know Director Dickinson's kind of looked at options, it's a little pricey, but what can we expect in terms of long-term planning for something like that?

561
01:22:54,015 --> 01:23:02,562
Yeah, I think, unfortunately, that was part of our free cash planning when we released that in October, and unfortunately the

562
01:23:03,458 --> 01:23:10,701
I think the money is the least of our worries, especially if the council wants to invest in it through a stabilization account or free cash.

563
01:23:11,221 --> 01:23:15,303
I think it's the staffing to implement something that takes two plus years.

564
01:23:15,443 --> 01:23:23,606
I'm not sure we have the capability to do everything that our finance team is doing and have somebody oversee that project currently.

565
01:23:24,146 --> 01:23:28,868
So next step would probably be to explore, and we've talked about it,

566
01:23:31,493 --> 01:23:39,759
be to explore whether it's a consultant or somebody to come on part-time to just fully manage implementing and changing over immunists.

567
01:23:40,259 --> 01:23:48,705
It's an endeavor that I know one or two cities that have done it and they'll just say how difficult it is, but I do know we need to get there.

568
01:23:49,425 --> 01:23:50,326
Got it.

569
01:23:50,646 --> 01:23:52,027
That's a helpful answer.

570
01:23:53,468 --> 01:23:56,990
I think residents have also been asking about,

571
01:23:59,343 --> 01:24:01,764
protections for immigrants, especially at this time.

572
01:24:03,044 --> 01:24:05,625
And we have our non cooperation policy.

573
01:24:05,665 --> 01:24:17,068
But in we you know, I know, members of city staff are making various efforts to protect residents and inform you know, residents of what they're able to do.

574
01:24:17,208 --> 01:24:24,049
I was wondering what you could speak to in this budget about about protecting our immigrant neighbors?

575
01:24:25,210 --> 01:24:25,830
Sure, yes.

576
01:24:25,890 --> 01:24:26,310
I mean, that's

577
01:24:27,535 --> 01:24:31,476
top priority, especially what we've been seeing on the federal level.

578
01:24:32,217 --> 01:24:33,097
And we've been doing it.

579
01:24:33,257 --> 01:24:35,878
It's always screaming at the rooftops about it.

580
01:24:36,038 --> 01:24:39,259
No, but that's the connectors and liaisons.

581
01:24:39,299 --> 01:24:50,163
We have 12 people that speak a second language that are out in our community weekly meeting with residents from all over every neighborhood, our housing authorities, our senior center.

582
01:24:50,623 --> 01:24:54,966
They're out hosting events, and we are trying to build the trust.

583
01:24:55,186 --> 01:25:01,711
So if people have questions or concerns, we are giving them the right answers.

584
01:25:01,771 --> 01:25:04,413
We are passing out Know Your Rights cards.

585
01:25:05,133 --> 01:25:08,055
We also are having events.

586
01:25:08,756 --> 01:25:11,458
We had an immigration attorney speak last week.

587
01:25:11,978 --> 01:25:18,223
We also had an event for business owners so they know how to protect their staffs and themselves.

588
01:25:18,743 --> 01:25:20,065
So this stuff is happening.

589
01:25:20,846 --> 01:25:33,165
I also have a meeting with the Attorney General General's office, we meet bi weekly with the mayors and the Attorney General staff but I also have a meeting just set up just with myself and their two attorneys they actually

590
01:25:33,743 --> 01:25:47,305
booked it with me because I brought up, you know, how do I educate myself in knowing what we can and cannot do as a city what we should and shouldn't say and it would be really great to be able to provide the council in myself.

591
01:25:49,784 --> 01:25:54,188
information on what can and can't be done, because we want to do everything we can.

592
01:25:54,209 --> 01:26:01,356
I know we're bound by certain federal laws, but we still want to do, you know, we have a welcoming ordinance.

593
01:26:01,596 --> 01:26:07,822
I think everybody knows that we want to protect our innocent immigrant residents and that's, we have to do it.

594
01:26:08,623 --> 01:26:09,043
Thank you.

595
01:26:09,484 --> 01:26:11,286
And my last question, I promise.

596
01:26:13,746 --> 01:26:25,614
You mentioned the Hegner Centre for after school childcare, obviously a very important issue in our community, a really difficult one too, because it's not just about spending money, it's also about getting space and sorting out all the details.

597
01:26:26,595 --> 01:26:29,537
I was wondering, after the Hegner Centre, what can we do?

598
01:26:29,557 --> 01:26:34,340
Because as helpful as that's going to be, it won't solve all the childcare problems?

599
01:26:34,819 --> 01:26:35,219
Sure.

600
01:26:35,239 --> 01:26:36,940
And it's a regional problem as well.

601
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:42,142
But I was wondering after that, what next steps are there as a city?

602
01:26:42,882 --> 01:26:44,343
What groundwork is being laid?

603
01:26:44,683 --> 01:26:44,883
Sure.

604
01:26:46,103 --> 01:27:00,168
Yes, I can actually, myself or I could have Dr. Galussi, superintendent of schools, send the presentation that we were given by Dr. Galussi, not yesterday, a week ago Monday.

605
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:04,030
So she did a full presentation on all the work that her team

606
01:27:05,370 --> 01:27:15,572
including Megan Fidelicari, and I know one or two school committee members have been highly involved in, and they have a plan in place to increase afterschool programming within our schools.

607
01:27:15,592 --> 01:27:17,392
So it was very exciting to hear.

608
01:27:18,052 --> 01:27:24,133
There was a whole host of residents that were here to advocate, and they really just came up to the podium and said, thank you.

609
01:27:24,333 --> 01:27:32,695
So Dr. Galluzzi is taking that issue along with the school committee, especially several members that are

610
01:27:33,355 --> 01:27:36,457
I talk to a number of parents all the time.

611
01:27:36,958 --> 01:27:46,685
She's taking that issue as one of the biggest issues to solve, which I'm super excited about because I've been asking, can we just increase each school by 10 students a year?

612
01:27:46,765 --> 01:27:48,106
Can we set goals?

613
01:27:48,567 --> 01:27:51,829
And she has a plan to increase it quite a bit.

614
01:27:51,929 --> 01:27:53,290
I'm very excited about it.

615
01:27:53,831 --> 01:28:01,757
So we can send you that presentation because there's so much going on and everybody's trying to solve every problem here in the city between the school committee, school department.

616
01:28:02,538 --> 01:28:04,700
city and the council so we can get that to you.

617
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:05,261
Awesome.

618
01:28:05,301 --> 01:28:06,623
That'd be super helpful.

619
01:28:06,683 --> 01:28:07,464
Thank you for your time.

620
01:28:07,484 --> 01:28:09,867
Thank you for the council for entertaining my questions.

621
01:28:10,007 --> 01:28:10,327
Thank you.

622
01:28:10,928 --> 01:28:11,369
Thank you.

623
01:28:11,469 --> 01:28:12,150
Councilor Callahan.

624
01:28:13,218 --> 01:28:13,719
Thank you so much.

625
01:28:13,759 --> 01:28:16,622
And 1st, I just want to apologize for not being there in person.

626
01:28:16,822 --> 01:28:18,604
I am feeling pretty under the weather.

627
01:28:18,624 --> 01:28:23,369
Um, and in fact, I think I will probably drop off after this budget vote.

628
01:28:23,689 --> 01:28:34,601
Um, but, uh, but I also want to thank counselor saying for, um, mentioning the tree planting the volunteer tree planting project and just give a tiny little update so that people understand and then ask 1 question.

629
01:28:35,141 --> 01:28:43,853
of the mayor as well, that the volunteer tree planting project is full steam ahead I have a team of dedicated volunteers who are working on it.

630
01:28:44,254 --> 01:28:51,745
We anticipate having our first pilot planting happened this fall, and we are working with trees Medford and you know,

631
01:28:52,205 --> 01:28:53,926
beginning to talk to folks in the administration.

632
01:28:55,007 --> 01:28:57,589
So I believe that that project is going to move forward.

633
01:28:58,049 --> 01:29:11,858
And Madam Mayor, I know that you had suggested when we met that the trees themselves, which is a relatively small part of the cost of planting trees, might come out of free cash when that happens.

634
01:29:11,938 --> 01:29:14,880
And I just wanted to see if that was still the plan.

635
01:29:16,537 --> 01:29:35,020
Yes, that's what I mentioned, I think when counselor saying ask the question that is I'm also on my list of free crap free cash requests, which we will be going through probably end of June into July so between the 25 papers we have to put before you in June that are kind of

636
01:29:35,565 --> 01:29:45,588
All we can handle right now, we're gonna continue to work through all the capital requests, all the requests in for funding, because there's something coming in from almost every department.

637
01:29:45,808 --> 01:29:53,430
We obviously need to make sure we're budgeting correctly and doing things in the proper years, but trees has been a huge goal of mine as well.

638
01:29:53,470 --> 01:29:54,970
So I thank you for taking this on.

639
01:29:55,230 --> 01:30:02,752
And I do plan on putting a paper before you, whether that's in June or July, to make sure we are reaching our tree planting goals.

640
01:30:03,593 --> 01:30:03,913
Wonderful.

641
01:30:03,933 --> 01:30:04,714
I really appreciate that.

642
01:30:04,774 --> 01:30:10,280
And I'm also very, very excited to see the free cash and stabilization fund plans later this summer.

643
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:10,820
Thank you so much.

644
01:30:11,781 --> 01:30:12,722
Thank you feel better.

645
01:30:12,742 --> 01:30:13,923
Thank you.

646
01:30:14,024 --> 01:30:14,284
Thank you.

647
01:30:21,047 --> 01:30:23,570
I'm going to shift in a different direction.

648
01:30:23,610 --> 01:30:26,412
I think that there's still a lot of pain in this community.

649
01:30:26,873 --> 01:30:39,605
And a lot has to go back from the beginning of the process of the override and how we got to this process and how people didn't feel like they were being listened to or being part of the solution to get involved.

650
01:30:40,426 --> 01:30:43,929
When you talk to the rank and file across the community, across all of our departments,

651
01:30:44,827 --> 01:30:52,652
You hear concerns that maybe what was mentioned in the schools, really, it's not hitting the schools they don't see much of a difference.

652
01:30:53,172 --> 01:30:54,913
When you see the streets and sidewalks.

653
01:30:55,453 --> 01:30:58,255
You don't see what was said I believe you said $500,000 would really

654
01:31:00,656 --> 01:31:24,737
um fix the pothole and sidewalk solutions and and it would help it would help it's not so as we're moving forward you're seeing these these issues that um have come up and we talk about funding issues and concerns something i've i've been bringing forward for years now the the cost of legal fees and seeing what's happening with our unions and

655
01:31:25,577 --> 01:31:41,425
the battles that are happening with lawsuits and arbitrations and hearings and not truly understanding and seeing the funding where our city's funds are being spent when you look at those situations.

656
01:31:42,085 --> 01:31:51,069
But I think the biggest piece is that I find alarming and it's great to hear that glowing reports, but when you see and hear

657
01:31:54,355 --> 01:31:56,557
Our residents really feel like they're not being listened to.

658
01:31:56,637 --> 01:32:11,149
I think it's important, whether it's the seniors talking about parking, I know you mentioned at the senior center and not feeling heard when it's with the new development that's coming in, or whether it's the override questions.

659
01:32:11,747 --> 01:32:29,915
that our residents were concerned about preparing them to take on such a hit when it came for increased taxes or with the charter questions that this council put forth and made some drastic changes to get it just put forth to the state.

660
01:32:30,095 --> 01:32:40,600
Or even now, I'm sure you're hearing with the concerns with the process and how we're working with the zoning and how people are scared that we're changing what Method looks like.

661
01:32:41,301 --> 01:32:45,367
So I think that there's a lot going on that I don't like.

662
01:32:45,947 --> 01:32:47,550
I've asked this council to vote on

663
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:56,604
on a state audit to come in that this council will vote just to look at the processes of free cash and see what we were last year.

664
01:32:56,684 --> 01:33:17,755
And then meeting with the state auditors association and understanding the process through these professionals and understanding that a nine to $11 million free cash safety net for the city of Memphis to maintain your bond rating and have enough money with the size and the budget that we have of our community

665
01:33:18,235 --> 01:33:19,296
that will be sustainable.

666
01:33:19,536 --> 01:33:22,397
And then you see $28 million of free cash.

667
01:33:22,417 --> 01:33:35,882
And now we're talking about all these different pockets that we're gonna be pooling, taking money out of, where free cash is budgeted money that this council voted on your request to move initiatives forward.

668
01:33:36,382 --> 01:33:44,085
And we see time after time, this huge surplus in free cash.

669
01:33:44,886 --> 01:33:45,546
And maybe it'll end,

670
01:33:46,537 --> 01:33:48,158
But we look at what's going on now.

671
01:33:48,999 --> 01:33:52,282
You're seeing under undermanned fire department.

672
01:33:52,662 --> 01:33:56,425
You're seeing undermanned funded DPW.

673
01:33:57,126 --> 01:33:59,147
You still have questions in the school department.

674
01:33:59,427 --> 01:34:02,270
You still have questions with streets and sidewalks.

675
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:04,812
There are so many concerns that are happening.

676
01:34:04,832 --> 01:34:10,216
I know I'm the odd duck here bringing these concerns up.

677
01:34:10,616 --> 01:34:14,720
But these are concerns that we should look at and really

678
01:34:17,553 --> 01:34:25,903
re-evaluate and understand that someone needs to be listening to the residents of the city because this council is not doing it.

679
01:34:26,890 --> 01:34:30,511
And it falls on our mayor and our leader to do that.

680
01:34:30,611 --> 01:34:33,353
So I'm not too happy.

681
01:34:33,393 --> 01:34:39,655
There's too many gaps and too many concerns that haven't been answered to me when it comes to the budget.

682
01:34:40,315 --> 01:34:44,457
And I won't be supporting the budget, shockingly, I'm sure.

683
01:34:44,917 --> 01:34:46,317
But I just think that

684
01:34:48,118 --> 01:35:03,441
there are way too many people that aren't being listened to and I know the override is a is was a was a huge success for some but it was a very close vote and it really divided the community more than you think and a lot of people mostly our most vulnerable people in our community are feeling that pain today and

685
01:35:05,002 --> 01:35:13,365
they don't hear any resolutions, they don't see any resolve, they don't see an assistance to support them as they're making very difficult decisions in their lives today.

686
01:35:13,425 --> 01:35:33,032
So, again, I apologize that I, like my fellow colleagues, I'm not throwing roses at your feet and saying how wonderful this is, but, you know, my colleagues find it very difficult when you don't line up with what their philosophy or their views are.

687
01:35:35,018 --> 01:35:41,722
To me, I think sometimes things need to be said, even though it doesn't fit the narrative of seven.

688
01:35:41,862 --> 01:35:42,623
So, thank you.

689
01:35:43,883 --> 01:35:45,184
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

690
01:35:45,384 --> 01:35:51,888
I just want to say one thing I for one don't think the mayor lines up with my ideology and views all that much but you know, we can still work together.

691
01:35:51,908 --> 01:35:52,548
We do our best.

692
01:35:52,588 --> 01:35:59,732
Yeah, I guess I can address a few things I mean I have to, I have to stick up for the school override money.

693
01:36:03,928 --> 01:36:08,978
Member Graham and Member Rousseau negotiate the teacher contract.

694
01:36:10,801 --> 01:36:25,212
I believe, I think that's 2.5 million to extend the school day per year and they've done their job, and being part of the school committee I know very well that every dollar that we've spent on this override money has gone to exactly what we said it will go to.

695
01:36:25,893 --> 01:36:30,316
I know it's, I know there's people that are not happy with the override I know there's people that can't afford it.

696
01:36:30,857 --> 01:36:34,820
I, I understand that and I know who you're speaking for and you're who you're hearing from.

697
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:45,566
But from a standpoint of where it's being spent, I can assure you it's being spent where we said it was going to be spent and it is positively affecting our students and our faculty.

698
01:36:46,546 --> 01:36:50,329
With regards to the DPW monies, we went through a process of

699
01:36:51,189 --> 01:36:51,669
That was 500,000.

700
01:36:51,709 --> 01:36:58,313
We needed more staffing we had to do the through the CBA we had to do internal postings first.

701
01:36:58,813 --> 01:37:03,415
I believe just recently, we have those three new crew members, and that's just recently.

702
01:37:03,875 --> 01:37:12,720
I never said that was going to fully fix our streets and sidewalks, it's not going to but to have another crew and have two crews out at the same time, especially around the time frame of

703
01:37:13,780 --> 01:37:28,224
Now until July until we get all the potholes fix until the next winter when they all get torn up, torn up again it's just a constant, constant issue but our dpw is is working hard and if they're not we are doing our best to manage.

704
01:37:28,624 --> 01:37:29,224
That's that.

705
01:37:29,244 --> 01:37:34,226
Okay, that's my.

706
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:38,622
Okay.

707
01:37:39,783 --> 01:38:05,263
Pre cash we're at 23 million we just spent 5 million to offset 5 million of the $30 million bond we may use more, depending on where we are next year to offset that bond because the debt is going to be now 1.4 million we're going to have to pay back in the fiscal year 27 budget alone so we do between the financial task force and our outside audit we are making sure that we are doing right by the by the residents and

708
01:38:05,603 --> 01:38:20,949
Yes, that free cash will go down based on all the projects we have before us, Freedom Way alone just to repave it and do sidewalks soup to nuts is probably going to be $15 million, we have to do the new roofs at the Roberts Brooks and miss a tuck.

709
01:38:21,589 --> 01:38:23,610
That's going to be I think a few million each.

710
01:38:23,970 --> 01:38:28,872
I mean, and these are just projects that are continually coming up, we have to fix the heat in this building.

711
01:38:28,892 --> 01:38:30,553
We're going to have to use that.

712
01:38:31,013 --> 01:38:35,274
stabilization account next over the summer, it needs to be fixed because people need to work.

713
01:38:35,755 --> 01:38:42,737
So there's just project after project in a city that's built when it was built and facilities that were built when they were built.

714
01:38:43,197 --> 01:38:47,838
And now it's finally paying attention over the last several years of for facility maintenance.

715
01:38:47,858 --> 01:38:59,162
There's a lot of work to do a lot of spending we need to do, just like, just like I said if we're down to 23 and dpw has requested almost 2 million on machinery and equipment.

716
01:39:00,222 --> 01:39:08,726
That is just one department of the many that need equipment and capital expenses that we need to fund over the next several months.

717
01:39:09,486 --> 01:39:10,847
Our fire department, we're hiring 12.

718
01:39:11,587 --> 01:39:14,589
I know that you're aware, Chief Evans and the team must have told you.

719
01:39:14,789 --> 01:39:17,050
So we are gonna be much better staffed.

720
01:39:17,630 --> 01:39:19,671
Thankfully, we're going through that process.

721
01:39:21,372 --> 01:39:25,874
I guess that's it for comments on those, but I hear you.

722
01:39:25,914 --> 01:39:26,214
Thank you.

723
01:39:26,234 --> 01:39:28,075
Vice President Collins.

724
01:39:29,477 --> 01:39:31,199
I'm just going to go to Vice President Collins and I'll come back to you.

725
01:39:33,881 --> 01:39:34,241
Thank you.

726
01:39:34,261 --> 01:39:42,268
I want to keep the focus of our discussion on the operating budget proposal.

727
01:39:43,008 --> 01:39:46,211
And I don't want to rehash disagreements that we've had a billion times.

728
01:39:47,112 --> 01:39:50,975
But since this has come up a couple times tonight, I do think it's important to correct the record.

729
01:39:53,520 --> 01:40:01,249
Nobody ever said that $500,000 to the DPW is going to wave a magic wand and fix every road and sidewalk in Medford.

730
01:40:01,409 --> 01:40:06,134
We shouldn't pretend that that's what any department said, department head said last year.

731
01:40:06,154 --> 01:40:06,855
That's not the case.

732
01:40:08,806 --> 01:40:25,993
That money that the residents of Medford voted to invest in our DPW capacity is to bring more of the labor of continually fixing those roads and sidewalks in-house so we can have city employees doing the work of day in, day out, year in, year out, fixing our roads and sidewalks.

733
01:40:26,093 --> 01:40:33,816
It is misinformation to say that voters should have expected every road and sidewalk to be fixed because questions seven and eight were approved.

734
01:40:33,836 --> 01:40:34,477
That is a fact.

735
01:40:34,517 --> 01:40:36,477
That is what everybody has been saying since last summer.

736
01:40:36,497 --> 01:40:37,438
And I think that we should

737
01:40:37,898 --> 01:40:49,819
I think it is fine and good to have disagreements about what we are funding and how in the city, but I think that we're all better than having to rely on misinformation to do that part of the reason I am eager to see.

738
01:40:51,914 --> 01:41:09,134
a formal free cash allocation plan, or that you put it in different terms, it means the same thing, to go along with our budget proposal this year is because there's a lot of right answers for what we should be investing in.

739
01:41:09,174 --> 01:41:10,275
You said right now we have 23 million,

740
01:41:12,457 --> 01:41:13,577
$5 million to pay off the bond.

741
01:41:14,678 --> 01:41:28,646
The Massachusetts Department of Revenue, I'm pretty sure the best practice is for 3 to 5% of a municipality's budget to be available as cash reserves, which would put us, that would be right around $10 million for City of Medford.

742
01:41:29,487 --> 01:41:35,050
So by my arithmetic, that means if we commit $7 million more

743
01:41:36,660 --> 01:41:44,883
this cycle to the list of projects that we have that we know we need investing in, which total way more than $7 million.

744
01:41:45,563 --> 01:41:56,407
That will get us right back down to best practice, state best practice, and be able to say, all right, residents, we have a action plan for what we are investing in on what timetable.

745
01:41:58,768 --> 01:41:59,268
And that is good.

746
01:41:59,308 --> 01:42:02,109
That is just simply, you could say it's not good or bad.

747
01:42:02,129 --> 01:42:02,689
It's just what we do.

748
01:42:02,749 --> 01:42:03,630
It's what we should be doing.

749
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:09,161
I just don't think that the conversation has to happen this way.

750
01:42:09,882 --> 01:42:21,789
And since I'm already picking a scab, I think it's useful to restate that the city is audited every single year by statute.

751
01:42:22,029 --> 01:42:34,457
And since I think we all are committed to the shared goal of fiscal prudence, I don't know why the residents of Medford would want us to spend money on an additional audit

752
01:42:35,075 --> 01:42:37,396
when we get one every single year as a matter of course.

753
01:42:37,416 --> 01:42:38,537
Thank you.

754
01:42:39,857 --> 01:43:03,549
I thank you, Council Collins I am in a way flattered if it's about free cash because as mayor you can't when you have too much free cash, then you're mismanaging funds if we go low, we don't have enough so I, we are doing our best we have a lot in the pipeline, we're going to probably get that down, you're right to about 12 million replenish our stabilization accounts and

755
01:43:05,805 --> 01:43:14,588
throughout the months ahead, do the capital needs that we need to do while trying to stay in balance and while not trying to overspend.

756
01:43:14,988 --> 01:43:23,230
So we are doing our best on the city side with the council support on or requests as well on the projects that are needed throughout our community.

757
01:43:23,651 --> 01:43:25,951
So I do like the feedback either way.

758
01:43:25,971 --> 01:43:26,772
I appreciate it.

759
01:43:26,792 --> 01:43:29,632
No, and I thank you for your time.

760
01:43:30,393 --> 01:43:30,613
Thank you.

761
01:43:33,628 --> 01:43:39,730
Again, I think that it's uncomfortable because it doesn't fit the dialogue for some of my colleagues.

762
01:43:40,970 --> 01:43:43,711
So it's easy to say the narrative that suits them.

763
01:43:43,971 --> 01:43:53,013
But again, they can go back and revisit all their Reddit sites and the comments they've made that said that $500,000 would fix their roads.

764
01:43:53,713 --> 01:43:55,294
So we can go on in that.

765
01:43:55,354 --> 01:43:58,494
So the other piece that I appreciate.

766
01:43:58,514 --> 01:44:00,115
The assessment says we need $200 million.

767
01:44:01,609 --> 01:44:07,071
Our assessment, we need over 200 million to fix our roads and sidewalks, and we've been saying that for five years.

768
01:44:07,331 --> 01:44:08,172
So we use it.

769
01:44:08,552 --> 01:44:10,233
Oh, the assessor and finance director.

770
01:44:10,273 --> 01:44:11,393
No, the assessment.

771
01:44:11,493 --> 01:44:13,294
The pavement management plan.

772
01:44:13,314 --> 01:44:13,654
Oh, I know.

773
01:44:14,254 --> 01:44:20,237
No, I know that, but what I'm saying is the assessor and finance director that weren't involved in the original override process.

774
01:44:22,394 --> 01:44:25,396
were they involved in assessing the roads and sidewalks and stuff?

775
01:44:25,436 --> 01:44:26,636
Was that private?

776
01:44:26,656 --> 01:44:28,057
Because that's what I'm a little confused.

777
01:44:28,097 --> 01:44:30,218
So I don't know, maybe it's late.

778
01:44:30,678 --> 01:44:38,501
I just, I look at the different dialogue that's being said with the requests to the audit.

779
01:44:39,362 --> 01:44:46,505
Maybe my colleagues, they tune me out, they don't listen, but the audit that's requested, the ones that we pay for every year as a city because it's mandated,

780
01:44:47,621 --> 01:45:03,129
That lines up as the audit, when I spoke with the auditors, state audits department, they explained that the lineup of what we do here is the audit of the money we spend, $10, we spend $10.

781
01:45:04,190 --> 01:45:09,892
The audit that we're requesting is saying, why are we not spending that money correctly?

782
01:45:10,333 --> 01:45:14,495
Why is it that every year we have an abundance in free cash?

783
01:45:15,745 --> 01:45:20,123
So it doesn't fit their dialogue, so I understand that it's an issue.

784
01:45:21,584 --> 01:45:27,888
But when you talk about the free cash and the capital needs that we need, that's usually done through capital improvement plan.

785
01:45:28,428 --> 01:45:33,972
That's usually done as a process where we work together in finding out these big projects.

786
01:45:33,992 --> 01:45:37,774
When you talk about Freedom Way, that shouldn't be done as an emergency basis.

787
01:45:37,794 --> 01:45:38,975
This didn't happen overnight.

788
01:45:39,515 --> 01:45:40,716
That's a capital project.

789
01:45:40,736 --> 01:45:43,537
That's a capital plan put in place by our office.

790
01:45:43,577 --> 01:45:44,258
We've been working on it.

791
01:45:44,618 --> 01:45:45,379
No, I understand that.

792
01:45:45,419 --> 01:45:50,262
But when you respond by saying, well, we're using that free cash to pay for that bond,

793
01:45:51,122 --> 01:45:54,804
Well, that's not used correctly.

794
01:45:55,184 --> 01:45:56,444
That money isn't used correctly.

795
01:45:57,225 --> 01:46:09,730
So again, we could keep beating this up, but this is my opinion that I'm sharing with you, that residents are sharing with me, because they seem that no one is listening.

796
01:46:11,091 --> 01:46:12,111
So thank you again.

797
01:46:14,292 --> 01:46:14,612
Thank you.

798
01:46:16,193 --> 01:46:17,434
I mean, just for one person,

799
01:46:20,455 --> 01:46:21,996
And maybe we're just using different words.

800
01:46:23,436 --> 01:46:28,458
When we talk about how did we spend the money and did it go to the places we set it, but we're doing that every year.

801
01:46:28,998 --> 01:46:35,440
And that's, that's what the audit is right yes we talked about how should the city spend money, where should money be spent.

802
01:46:37,153 --> 01:46:43,037
Well, we have a conversation about that every two years and it's, we have it every year it's called the city budget and we have it every two years it's called an election.

803
01:46:43,637 --> 01:46:54,023
I mean, that's different, you know, people disagree with how the mayor's making decisions about, and I disagree with you often, and all of us do, how to spend money.

804
01:46:55,504 --> 01:47:00,828
Then you have to put someone else in the office to make different decisions I mean that's just say that's an audit that's not.

805
01:47:01,785 --> 01:47:05,106
That's I just think we're using different words to talk about what decision making is about.

806
01:47:05,786 --> 01:47:06,607
So that's just my opinion.

807
01:47:07,687 --> 01:47:11,348
And I appreciate that we are a little more clear on the differences of what we're talking about now.

808
01:47:13,309 --> 01:47:15,730
Is there anything else you'd like to add or the chief of staff.

809
01:47:16,070 --> 01:47:23,213
No, just thank you for your time President bears and vice president Collins and the city council we appreciate we appreciate you allowing us to present and answer questions.

810
01:47:23,853 --> 01:47:29,275
And I think maybe June 10 but you'll let us know we have a few things to get you before then and hope

811
01:47:29,757 --> 01:47:31,937
that you vote in favor of this budget?

812
01:47:32,078 --> 01:47:35,158
Well, we're gonna go to any public participation.

813
01:47:35,218 --> 01:47:36,398
Well, first I need a motion.

814
01:47:37,579 --> 01:47:40,599
Is there a motion on the floor, Vice President Collins?

815
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:48,901
I will motion to table the paper to June 10th.

816
01:47:49,421 --> 01:47:54,422
On the motion of Vice President Collins to table the paper to June 10th, seconded by Councilor Sang.

817
01:47:54,442 --> 01:47:56,703
Is there any further discussion by members of the council?

818
01:47:58,336 --> 01:48:08,752
Seeing none, is there any discussion by members of the public either in person or on zoom about the city budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 income to the podium on in person or raise your hand on zoom.

819
01:48:20,803 --> 01:48:27,725
Seeing no further discussion on the motion of Vice President Collins to table the budget to June 10 seconded by Councilor Sagan.

820
01:48:27,745 --> 01:48:28,725
Mr. Clerk please call the roll.

821
01:48:30,186 --> 01:48:30,906
Councilor Callahan.

822
01:48:32,667 --> 01:48:35,388
Actually looks like we've lost Councilor Callahan so all those in favor.

823
01:48:36,188 --> 01:48:37,128
Opposed.

824
01:48:37,328 --> 01:48:38,208
Motion passes.

825
01:48:41,249 --> 01:48:42,810
Councilor Scarpelli opposed.

826
01:48:46,311 --> 01:48:49,552
So the budget will be tabled to June 10th but we'll pick it up for further discussion.

827
01:48:51,070 --> 01:48:58,673
The regular order of business records the records of the meeting of May 13 2025 for past counselor Scott Kelly counselor Scott Kelly, how did you find those records.

828
01:49:01,173 --> 01:49:07,235
On the motion of counselor Scott probably to approve the record seconded by seconded by Vice President Collins, all those in favor.

829
01:49:08,696 --> 01:49:13,918
Passes reports of committees 24033 offered by Vice President Collins planning and permitting committee may 14 2025.

830
01:49:19,012 --> 01:49:24,257
Thank you President bears at this most recent meeting of the planning and permitting committee.

831
01:49:25,198 --> 01:49:36,650
For the first time we reviewed a were, we need to find a better term for the quote unquote other quarters proposal, this is a proposal to apply a quarter zoning framework to several of the

832
01:49:38,231 --> 01:49:59,504
other corridors throughout the city, notably High Street from West Medford to the Arlington border, parts of Boston Avenue, the notably not the parts that are going to be included in the Tufts Institutional Zone, Harvard Avenue, Main Street, and the Broadway Corridor District to align it with Somerville Broadway District zoning.

833
01:49:59,825 --> 01:50:03,027
We also talked about the neighborhood

834
01:50:03,927 --> 01:50:25,201
neighborhood commercial nodes topic for the first time, we are going to be picking up both of these topics the other corridors and the neighborhood commercial nodes at the planning and permitting committee meeting tomorrow night, 6pm in the chambers and on zoom, as usual, motion to approve the motion of Councilor Collins to approve the committee report seconded by Council is our all is in favor.

835
01:50:25,822 --> 01:50:27,523
I oppose motion passes.

836
01:50:28,531 --> 01:50:32,616
2-5-0-6-9 offered by Councilor Callahan, Public Works and Facilities Committee, May 20, 2025.

837
01:50:32,776 --> 01:50:34,257
Report to follow.

838
01:50:34,297 --> 01:50:37,541
This is a meeting on the Chevalier Theatre.

This job is basically just to move these five poles to the other side of Boston Ave.

989
02:01:42,235 --> 02:01:48,777
Because Tufts will be building new dorms and they will be too close to where the existing electric lines are.

provide truck access to their site.

994
02:02:07,751 --> 02:02:12,735

Great, I'll go to Councillor Scarpelli.

997
02:02:19,339 --> 02:02:20,100
Thank you, Mr. President.

998
02:02:20,220 --> 02:02:30,327
Again, I think it's, we know the answer, but question, when you say shared, it's not a double pole, it's one pole shared by multiple entities, correct?

999
02:02:30,787 --> 02:02:31,008
Yes.

1000
02:02:31,088 --> 02:02:34,010
Okay, and how long is the project gonna last?

1001
02:02:37,705 --> 02:02:39,706
That I don't know.

1002
02:02:41,146 --> 02:02:42,146
I have information on that.

1003
02:02:43,026 --> 02:02:53,889
Basically, their project, National Grids project, will be completed within a week of approval, or a couple weeks of approval, maybe days.

1004
02:02:54,669 --> 02:02:58,190
The project, the dormitory project, will last through September of 2027.

1005
02:03:01,483 --> 02:03:02,103
I appreciate that.

1006
02:03:02,163 --> 02:03:16,627
My only question is that the residents that will be impacted by the construction, you know, just making sure I know we have 72 hours of notification and is that just done by, you know, just the butters or could we get something more extensive?

1007
02:03:17,227 --> 02:03:19,268
No, this is just the poles.

1008
02:03:19,508 --> 02:03:20,808
This is just the joint poles.

1009
02:03:20,868 --> 02:03:22,369
We're not talking about the dormitory.

1010
02:03:22,389 --> 02:03:23,689
We're not talking about the building.

1011
02:03:23,889 --> 02:03:26,350
This is just them relocating your utility pole.

1012
02:03:26,370 --> 02:03:30,211
They're going to dig a hole and they're going to put a new pole in and then rehang some wires.

1013
02:03:30,691 --> 02:03:38,376
So the disturbance for a pole relocation is very minimal to Albutters.

1014
02:03:38,416 --> 02:03:42,098
So the sidewalks won't be closed, driveways won't be impacted?

1015
02:03:42,959 --> 02:03:50,884
They currently have both sidewalks open and it should be relocated within a day.

1016
02:03:51,204 --> 02:03:53,246
So this is like a day's worth of work.

1017
02:03:54,346 --> 02:03:54,666
Thank you.

1018
02:03:55,227 --> 02:03:55,367
Yep.

1019
02:03:57,772 --> 02:04:00,473
Great, thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, thank you, Engineer Wirtala.

1020
02:04:01,994 --> 02:04:04,135
Are there any other questions by members of the council?

1021
02:04:07,376 --> 02:04:10,857
Seeing none, I'm going to open the public hearing.

1022
02:04:10,878 --> 02:04:21,662
Public hearing is open to anyone who would like to speak in favor, in opposition, or otherwise register a comment of any kind on this project.

1023
02:04:22,843 --> 02:04:26,064
If you would like to comment, register your support.

1024
02:04:27,464 --> 02:04:28,365
National Grid support.

1025
02:04:29,646 --> 02:04:30,747
National Grid support.

1026
02:04:31,808 --> 02:04:32,288
Thank you.

1027
02:04:32,929 --> 02:04:36,792
I see two folks here.

1028
02:04:37,373 --> 02:04:39,495
I'll recognize Rocco DiRico.

1029
02:04:40,956 --> 02:04:45,040
Rocco, just your name and address for the record, and if you could provide your comment.

1030
02:04:46,276 --> 02:04:55,741
Thank you, President Baer, Rocco DiRico, 14 Capen Street, Medford, Tufts University, Office of Government and Community Relations.

1031
02:04:56,822 --> 02:05:02,925
Appreciate the Council taking this up as the City Engineer explained.

1032
02:05:03,206 --> 02:05:06,948
This is part of our dormitory project, which will add 664

1033
02:05:09,649 --> 02:05:11,950
on-campus beds for juniors and seniors.

1034
02:05:12,950 --> 02:05:31,214
The other benefit of this project, aside from allowing us to proceed with the construction, is it's going to allow for new trees on both sides of Boston Avenue, as well as streetscape improvements and bike lanes on both sides of Boston Avenue.

1035
02:05:31,234 --> 02:05:36,575
To answer Councilor Scarpelli's question, on this side of Boston Ave,

1036
02:05:37,655 --> 02:05:43,680
there are no driveways and the the abutter is the MBTA train tracks.

1037
02:05:44,381 --> 02:06:04,297
So this should not have an impact on the neighbors, but nonetheless we are meeting with the neighbors every month to go through construction concerns, answer their questions, and then we also send a newsletter out to our neighbors in the middle of the month

1038
02:06:04,837 --> 02:06:08,499
to communicate further construction news.

1039
02:06:08,539 --> 02:06:17,204
So we'll continue to do that as part of this particular project, which is just moving the poles, but also throughout the course of the larger project.

1040
02:06:17,884 --> 02:06:23,187
So just here to voice my support for this grant of location, appreciate the time and a long night.

1041
02:06:24,288 --> 02:06:24,788
Thank you.

1042
02:06:25,529 --> 02:06:27,450
We'll go to Jeremy Martin.

1043
02:06:27,810 --> 02:06:32,973
Jeremy, name and address for the record, and please register your comment on this grant of location.

1044
02:06:33,899 --> 02:06:34,800
Thanks, President Behrs.

1045
02:06:34,860 --> 02:06:36,921
Jeremy Martin, 65, Burgadave.

1046
02:06:37,401 --> 02:06:40,883
I'm here as a resident of the Hillside neighborhood to speak in favor of the petition.

1047
02:06:41,784 --> 02:06:51,670
The relocation of this equipment, as Rob Go describes, helps to facilitate the improvements that are sorely needed along Boston Avenue in order to keep pace with the changes happening in our neighborhood.

1048
02:06:53,051 --> 02:06:59,055
I appreciate Tufts' commitment that they've made to our community to help improve Boston Avenue.

1049
02:06:59,824 --> 02:07:05,307
and I hope that that is matched with enthusiastic investment and action by the city as we go forward.

1050
02:07:05,927 --> 02:07:06,227
Thank you.

1051
02:07:07,548 --> 02:07:08,168
Thank you, Jeremy.

1052
02:07:09,469 --> 02:07:11,550
Is there any further comment on this item?

1053
02:07:14,071 --> 02:07:17,092
Seeing none, I'm declaring this public hearing closed.

1054
02:07:18,473 --> 02:07:25,896
On the motion of Councillor Scarpelli to approve with the conditions of the city engineer, seconded by Councillor Zaro.

1055
02:07:26,396 --> 02:07:27,297
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1056
02:07:38,854 --> 02:07:41,635
That's Kelly is I'm sorry, it's absent.

1057
02:07:42,276 --> 02:07:43,096
Vice President Collins.

1058
02:07:43,116 --> 02:07:46,958
That's all those are Council Lemming.

1059
02:07:47,818 --> 02:07:50,940
Councilor Scarpelli counter saying present bears.

1060
02:07:51,160 --> 02:07:53,981
Yes, 60 affirmative what happens the motion passes Thank you so much.

1061
02:07:54,261 --> 02:07:55,242
Thanks for sharing with us.

1062
02:07:56,742 --> 02:07:57,923
Fun way to spend a Tuesday night.

1063
02:08:00,674 --> 02:08:02,936
Motions, orders, and resolutions.

1064
02:08:02,956 --> 02:08:17,366
25-075 offered by Councilor Lemming, whereas veterans are often in need of food, transportation, and heat expenses, and whereas the good people of Medford may like to contribute to this cause, and whereas Medford area has provisions for allowing voluntary donations to the police and fire department on our excise tax bills.

1065
02:08:17,987 --> 02:08:23,711
Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we adopt the provisions of Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 60, Section 3F,

1066
02:08:25,632 --> 02:08:33,134
which allows municipalities to add a section for voluntary donations on excise tax bills that will go towards a fund for in need residents counselor by me.

1067
02:08:35,115 --> 02:08:35,555
Thank you.

1068
02:08:35,615 --> 02:08:43,957
So this is a another request from our veteran services director who I think is doing a wonderful job supporting veterans in this community.

1069
02:08:43,977 --> 02:08:46,458
Essentially, she wants to add a

1070
02:08:47,519 --> 02:08:55,466
an option for residents to be able to donate if they choose to on their excise tax bills to a fund that would assist in need veterans.

1071
02:08:56,047 --> 02:09:05,576
The requirement for doing so is that the city council vote to adopt this particular section of mass general law.

1072
02:09:05,596 --> 02:09:09,219
I think it's a very worthwhile initiative.

1073
02:09:09,259 --> 02:09:11,221
I don't want to belabor the point

1074
02:09:11,989 --> 02:09:23,424
too much after all of our fine words about the veteran community earlier in the night and considering that we still have a lot to get to.

1075
02:09:24,045 --> 02:09:27,810
But I think it's a very worthwhile resolution and I'd motion to approve.

1076
02:09:30,182 --> 02:09:40,014
On the motion of Council I'm going to approve this adoption of Massachusetts general law chapter 60 section three F, second about second by counselor saying, since this is an adoption of state law.

1077
02:09:47,940 --> 02:09:48,941
Council Callahan is absent.

1078
02:09:49,502 --> 02:10:07,040
Vice President Collins Council is our council let me Councilor Scarpelli Councilor saying, President bears, yes, six affirmative what happens the motion passes, 2005 086 offered by Vice President Collins proposed amendments to the Medford zoning ordinance accessory dwelling units for referral to the Community Development Board.

1079
02:10:07,765 --> 02:10:15,891
This is reported out of the planning and permitting committee, and the procedural next step is for us to refer to Community Development Board.

1080
02:10:15,931 --> 02:10:16,792
Vice President Collins.

1081
02:10:17,472 --> 02:10:18,353
Thank you, President Behrs.

1082
02:10:18,373 --> 02:10:27,780
Yes, to restate what you just said, people who have been paying attention to this process have heard me say this dozens of times before, every zoning proposal or zoning amendment

1083
02:10:28,340 --> 02:10:49,562
goes from the planning and permitting committee reported out this body then statutorily must refer to the Community Development Board where there are public hearings on the proposal, and that is then submitted back to this body for a vote with recommendations if the Community Development Board so chooses so this is the stage where we refer this proposal to the Community Development Board they will hold

1084
02:10:50,162 --> 02:10:52,744
Their public hearings the Community Development Board.

1085
02:10:52,865 --> 02:11:14,063
This year has been great about taking the time that they need to ask the questions and get the comments in the context that they need to form their recommendations I'm sure that they will do this on the accessory dwellings accessory dwelling units proposed changes as well for folks who would like to educate themselves about these proposed changes before the CDP public hearing dates.

1086
02:11:14,563 --> 02:11:21,130
There is a lot of information available on Medford ma.org slash zoning we have been discussing these proposed updates.

1087
02:11:21,951 --> 02:11:25,955
Since March we held a public q amp a earlier this month.

1088
02:11:26,736 --> 02:11:34,445
And this update encompasses both updates that are required of us and other communities due to a recent change in state law.

1089
02:11:35,927 --> 02:11:44,440
As well as some proposed changes that go better outside the bounds of nearly what is required to be in compliance with the state housing law.

1090
02:11:45,061 --> 02:11:47,625
So with that emotion to refer to the Community Development Board.

1091
02:11:49,282 --> 02:11:56,505
Thank you on the motion of cancer cancer for Community Development Board seconded by seconded by Council is our counselor Scarborough.

1092
02:11:56,645 --> 02:11:57,686
Thank you, Mr. President.

1093
02:11:58,166 --> 02:12:10,291
It's come to my attention from multiple residents I know that reaching out and very concerned about some of the, the processes and how the ADU proposal has been.

1094
02:12:13,933 --> 02:12:14,453
presented.

1095
02:12:15,254 --> 02:12:20,336
One question was that the proposal went out in 430 and it wasn't written until 521.

1096
02:12:20,416 --> 02:12:41,246
That's that was a concern that was brought to my attention by a resident and then multiple residents who feel again that this process is being rushed and and really that this council isn't hearing us hearing our residents and and when it is being heard and we do have meetings

1097
02:12:41,974 --> 02:12:50,697
and zoning is put forth with some changes that this council will revert back and eliminate those requests from residents.

1098
02:12:50,737 --> 02:12:54,219
So I can't support this moving forward.

1099
02:12:54,239 --> 02:12:54,559
Thank you.

1100
02:12:55,539 --> 02:12:56,800
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

1101
02:12:58,060 --> 02:12:58,901
Thank you, President Behrs.

1102
02:12:58,921 --> 02:13:00,441
Thank you for that, Councilor Scarpelli.

1103
02:13:04,483 --> 02:13:05,303
Appreciate the comments.

1104
02:13:05,323 --> 02:13:06,323
I'll just go in reverse order.

1105
02:13:06,343 --> 02:13:10,225
I do just want to take a little bit more time to explain what I

1106
02:13:11,985 --> 02:13:23,512
said in introducing the zoning proposal I do think it's important to know that part of what's being referred out in this in these proposed updates to the accessory dwelling units proposal is required of us by state law.

1107
02:13:24,093 --> 02:13:34,219
There's parts of it that are not required by state law but there are parts that very much are where the city would be opened up to liability if we were to fail to be in compliance with the new state law so I just want to make that clear.

1108
02:13:34,819 --> 02:13:43,762
to my colleagues and to residents who were not a part of the extensive public process and putting this proposal together.

1109
02:13:43,782 --> 02:13:48,963
To your other point and of course we've discussed this before and I think it's worth discussing.

1110
02:13:49,663 --> 02:13:51,664
I know that there are some in the community.

1111
02:13:52,364 --> 02:14:02,306
who have not been in favor of some of the recent zoning proposals that we have made or some of the recent votes that have gone forward on zoning proposals.

1112
02:14:02,726 --> 02:14:04,707
Of course, every councilor's vote is their own.

1113
02:14:06,907 --> 02:14:16,389
That being said, I think it is also, and we obviously, we will never achieve 100% consensus in the community on anything that is not a realistic standard to hold ourself to.

1114
02:14:16,449 --> 02:14:18,310
It's not the standard that we are holding ourselves to.

1115
02:14:18,890 --> 02:14:25,833
But I do really appreciate every resident who has been a part of this process on these various proposals over the last year.

1116
02:14:25,853 --> 02:14:38,179
It is a challenging topic and I really welcome and appreciate the participation from residents, especially the residents who show up and say, I think you should change this and I'm not in favor because that is challenging and I really do appreciate that.

1117
02:14:39,880 --> 02:14:42,862
But it is also true at the same time that we have had

1118
02:14:43,442 --> 02:15:06,098
We have responded to calls for more opportunities for public participation in this process by adding a whole other step to our zoning review timeline one that is not typically followed we have added a lot of public opportunities for public participation, we have added a whole web page about the zoning process, the mass municipal association.

1119
02:15:06,718 --> 02:15:19,562
wrote an article about our communications and outreach efforts because it was so unique to them for us to be going to such great lengths to publicize and message the work that we are doing this term.

1120
02:15:20,963 --> 02:15:32,366
And to your other point about this this feeling of inevitability that the city council is just going to quote unquote reverse whatever the quote unquote community asks for and of course we shouldn't be speaking in monoliths here.

1121
02:15:35,139 --> 02:15:45,544
The CDB refers back to recommendations to the city council, if it so chooses that has happened twice now, not just once we approved mystic Avenue quarter district zoning, as well as Salem Street quarter district zoning.

1122
02:15:46,644 --> 02:15:54,108
I don't think that it's fair or productive to pretend that a vote is going to go the same way every single time, because the data doesn't bear that out.

1123
02:15:54,788 --> 02:15:55,048
Thank you.

1124
02:15:56,289 --> 02:15:56,609
Thanks.

1125
02:15:56,649 --> 02:15:59,891
Yeah, we adopted all of the CDB recommendations for Mr.

1126
02:16:01,071 --> 02:16:07,153
Green score, the phase one changes and all but one CDB recommendation for the Salem Street neighborhood quarter district.

1127
02:16:11,775 --> 02:16:13,215
On the motion, all those in favor.

1128
02:16:14,016 --> 02:16:18,137
Opposed motion passes.

1129
02:16:18,157 --> 02:16:24,179
25087 offered by Councilor Collins, 2024 Community Control Republic Surveillance Annual Report.

1130
02:16:25,880 --> 02:16:26,600
One second here.

1131
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:38,776
Be it resolved that the City Council discuss and approve the 2024 Community Control Republic Surveillance Annual Report pursuant to Section 50 Article 3 Community Control Republic Surveillance Ordinance.

1132
02:16:40,016 --> 02:16:50,103
One question I have here before we get started, Vice President Collins, is this also going to constitute approval of the LPR use policy that is included here?

1133
02:16:51,977 --> 02:16:56,621
The license plate reader use policy was included in this packet from the parking department.

1134
02:16:56,961 --> 02:17:01,765
Does approval of the annual report also constitute approval of the license plate reader policy?

1135
02:17:02,746 --> 02:17:03,006
Okay.

1136
02:17:03,907 --> 02:17:05,408
I might want us to take two votes.

1137
02:17:07,329 --> 02:17:08,070
Vice President Collins.

1138
02:17:09,731 --> 02:17:11,533
Thank you, President Behrs, and thank you for flagging that.

1139
02:17:14,382 --> 02:17:21,827
The community control over public surveillance ordinance was passed by the city council, and I believe February March of 2023.

1140
02:17:22,427 --> 02:17:28,811
We have gone through this annual public report process.

1141
02:17:29,172 --> 02:17:30,613
One time before in April of 2024.

1142
02:17:33,274 --> 02:17:43,205
We reviewed the annual reporting of the one city agency that was registered as having surveillance technology at that time which was the Medford Police Department.

1143
02:17:43,686 --> 02:17:48,411
That was a bit of an unusual public reporting.

1144
02:17:52,429 --> 02:18:10,273
That was a bit of an unusual annual public report in that the only surveillance technology known and use in the city at that time was body worn cameras by the Medford Police Department which also per a negotiated contract carve out in the ordinance is not subject to the approval of a use policy which all other surveillance technology.

1145
02:18:11,774 --> 02:18:27,391
in the city would be because sorry I should back up here for people who don't know the Community Control of Republic surveillance ordinance is an ordinance passed in 2023 that sets up a structure for the city council and residents of Medford to look together at

1146
02:18:28,492 --> 02:18:44,726
surveillance technology that is approved to be used by any public entity in the city of Medford so this doesn't regulate ring cameras or nest cameras it's just surveillance technology that the city wants to use and make sure that we have a public process for saying, what are the pros, what are the cons, what are the costs.

1147
02:18:44,906 --> 02:18:51,972
What are we hoping to get out of this and what are the potential risks that we can so that we can make sure we have that full conversation before the city council takes a vote.

1148
02:18:52,572 --> 02:19:01,498
to approve a surveillance technology with the use policy or deny one or ask for modifications in order for the surveillance technology to be used.

1149
02:19:02,898 --> 02:19:10,483
So last year we were just having a review of the use of body worn cameras by the Medford Police Department they hadn't been in effect for very long by that point.

1150
02:19:10,643 --> 02:19:11,984
point so it was a pretty short report.

1151
02:19:14,026 --> 02:19:22,594
This time the reporting looks a little bit different because we have a full year of experience and data on the Medford Police Department's use of body-worn cameras.

1152
02:19:23,515 --> 02:19:34,625
They went over this with us in a committee of the whole or sorry a public health and community safety committee a few weeks ago and this is also the first time that our reporting includes use of surveillance technology

1153
02:19:35,125 --> 02:19:36,486
by the Medford parking department.

1154
02:19:37,106 --> 02:19:48,229
This surveillance technology automatic license plate readers was inadvertently already in use by the Medford parking department prior to their submission of an impact port and a use policy.

1155
02:19:49,350 --> 02:20:04,595
However, in committee of the whole, we reviewed a draft impact report, we reviewed a draft use policy, the committee discussed it and reported it out and we are looking at a use policy tonight that includes a couple of small modifications that the council requested

1156
02:20:05,155 --> 02:20:07,838
to the license plate reader use policy.

1157
02:20:08,679 --> 02:20:10,521
So the documents included in this.

1158
02:20:10,801 --> 02:20:25,978
So, the one of the requirements of the city council per the community control of the public surveillance ordinance is to hold these meetings annually to review the use of surveillance technology by city agencies and then to compile

1159
02:20:26,918 --> 02:20:41,585
In this report, the findings, how many list them out here, the number of requests for approval, the number of times the city council approved requests for surveillance technology the number of times the city council requested modifications.

1160
02:20:42,585 --> 02:20:45,086
The number of times that the city council.

1161
02:20:48,323 --> 02:20:57,871
declined to approve a surveillance technology use policy and all annual surveillance reports and reporting that were submitted this year.

1162
02:20:58,411 --> 02:20:59,332
So this compiles that.

1163
02:21:00,733 --> 02:21:15,805
Again, this was a bit of another unusual year, but for a different reason in that we did not receive any requests for a new use of a new surveillance technology that would be, say, for example, if the parking department said, hey, there's this new hardware that we want to use, we want to introduce, we're gonna ask for permission.

1164
02:21:16,485 --> 02:21:18,307
Before we use it that is how the process should go.

1165
02:21:18,327 --> 02:21:22,511
This was more of a approval of a pre existing surveillance technology use.

1166
02:21:27,139 --> 02:21:45,220
The City Council annual report compiles the impact report, or sorry, it compiles the Medford Police Department's annual reporting, it compiles the parking department's impact report and updated use policy.

1167
02:21:45,260 --> 02:21:46,241
It also includes

1168
02:21:49,301 --> 02:21:56,934
public comment that was submitted on the annual report by the Medford police department so this is a part of our public record now.

1169
02:21:57,395 --> 02:21:59,178
That is one of the goals of the ordinance is to.

1170
02:22:00,815 --> 02:22:18,747
maintain and add to a public record of surveillance technology in the city both those submitted by the agencies that are using it, and the city council's discussions and findings and takeaways from our, from what we discussed with these departments about their use of surveillance technology.

1171
02:22:20,308 --> 02:22:28,393
With that, I would make a motion to approve the parking department's use policy for automatic license plate readers.

1172
02:22:28,413 --> 02:22:36,858
I would also make a motion to approve the city council annual surveillance report, unless there is any questions or comments from my fellow councilors or members in public.

1173
02:22:38,078 --> 02:22:45,943
On the motion to approve the B paper to approve the LPR policy, we'll take that first.

1174
02:22:45,963 --> 02:22:49,405
Is there any further discussion on the approval of the license plate reader policy?

1175
02:22:52,895 --> 02:22:53,656
Councilor Scarpelli.

1176
02:22:53,816 --> 02:23:02,362
I think that without having a conversation with the Chief, I will not support these initiatives.

1177
02:23:02,442 --> 02:23:02,903
So thank you.

1178
02:23:03,944 --> 02:23:04,384
Thank you.

1179
02:23:05,004 --> 02:23:11,750
On the motion to approve the license plate reader report by Vice President Collins, seconded by Vice President Collins.

1180
02:23:12,450 --> 02:23:16,994
I just want to be clear that the Chief submitted the report that we're voting on.

1181
02:23:18,775 --> 02:23:19,255
Thank you.

1182
02:23:19,496 --> 02:23:20,156
On the motion.

1183
02:23:21,297 --> 02:23:22,058
All those in favor.

1184
02:23:23,242 --> 02:23:29,425
Opposed motion passes on the main paper to approve the annual surveillance report is our motion.

1185
02:23:31,346 --> 02:23:35,508
Motion approved by Vice President Collins seconded by Council is our all those in favor.

1187

Thank you, we, this is something that residents.

1188
02:23:53,290 --> 02:23:54,911
have requested.

1189
02:23:55,892 --> 02:24:07,558
And earlier tonight, when we had representatives from the Medford Police Department here to talk about their budget, we spoke about this.

1190
02:24:08,939 --> 02:24:14,142
For tonight, since Chief Buckley is not available, I

1191
02:24:14,886 --> 02:24:28,352
would motion to table and also because what Officer Covino mentioned is that they're still discussing and compiling what sort of information they may have access to, and I would like to give them a little bit of time.

1192
02:24:28,952 --> 02:24:31,673
So I would motion to table this resolution.

1193
02:24:31,693 --> 02:24:39,937
I motion to table by Council is our second by counselor saying the motion is a debatable all those in favor.

1194
02:24:40,937 --> 02:24:41,478
Opposed.

02:24:42,558 --> 02:24:44,319

1197
02:24:53,845 --> 02:24:56,206
I neglected to mention this as part of the committee report.

1198
02:24:56,266 --> 02:25:05,391
We did discuss this last Wednesday at our committee meeting, and we heard from our parking director and our city engineer on this.

1199
02:25:06,151 --> 02:25:06,951
Councilor Collins.

1200
02:25:10,453 --> 02:25:14,595
One second, just so I read it into the record.

1201
02:25:15,972 --> 02:25:24,443

1204

The balance of free cash before this vote is $22,311,303.11.

1205
02:25:46,838 --> 02:25:51,019
Respectfully submitted, Brianna Lingo, current mayor.

1206
02:25:52,159 --> 02:25:56,321
On the motion of Vice President Collins to approve the appropriation, seconded by Councilor Sang.

1207
02:25:56,361 --> 02:25:57,281
Is there any further discussion?

02:26:01,335 --> 02:26:05,178
seeing even the city engineer is shaking his head so he's he's all set.

1209
02:26:07,240 --> 02:26:17,409
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

Vice President Collins.

1212
02:26:23,505 --> 02:26:24,026
That's a lemon.

1213

I'll just go Kelly.

1214
02:26:28,416 --> 02:26:29,317
Yes, the affirmative.

02:27:20,971 --> 02:27:27,152
But Director Crowley is on this one so I want to make sure that she can speak to the paper.

Yes.

1223
02:27:29,925 --> 02:27:36,072
Thank you, director Crowley, if you could make a presentation on this paper, anything you'd like to add.

1224
02:27:36,133 --> 02:27:38,576
Thank you President Beas, through you to the council.

1225
02:27:38,976 --> 02:27:49,088
This is just a, as you can see, a color adjustment to go along with the adjustments that we've made throughout the city through our union contracts to bring out non-union employees.

1226
02:27:51,369 --> 02:28:01,092
up alongside those colors that are being given in July for our union representatives as well, our union employees, excuse me.

1227
02:28:02,813 --> 02:28:04,313
So it's just to bring them online.

Thank you, Director Crowley.

1229
02:28:08,434 --> 02:28:09,155

02:28:19,877 --> 02:28:25,320
I will not support increasing non-union raises until our union contracts are ratified.

1233
02:28:25,360 --> 02:28:25,640
Thank you.

1234
02:28:26,101 --> 02:28:26,541
Thank you.

1235

On the motion to approve for first reading by Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Sang, any further discussion?

1236
02:28:38,447 --> 02:28:43,689
Seeing no further discussion by members of the council, no hands on Zoom, no one in the chamber.

1237
02:28:43,809 --> 02:28:44,790
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1240
02:29:06,351 --> 02:29:12,714
091 submitted by Mary brain on the curtain authorization of a five year contract for Rico USA copy machines and printers.

1241
02:29:14,132 --> 02:29:22,058
Dear President Behrs and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend the City Council approve the following five-year contract with Ricoh USA Inc.

1242
02:29:22,118 --> 02:29:31,826
for the lease of copy machines and a print technology solution in accordance with Massachusetts General Law Chapter 30b, Section 12, which requires City Council approval for a contract that exceeds three years.

1243
02:29:32,366 --> 02:29:35,349
Please see the attached for an outline of the scope of the agreement for the School Department.

1244
02:29:35,489 --> 02:29:36,950
Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

1245
02:29:37,010 --> 02:29:38,911
Respectfully submitted, Brianna Lovego Kern, Mayor.

1246
02:29:39,572 --> 02:29:42,955
And I will recognize Dr. Cushing, our Assistant Superintendent

1247
02:29:44,421 --> 02:29:46,423
of operations and innovation, is that right?

1248
02:29:46,523 --> 02:29:47,103
Did I get it right?

1249
02:29:47,544 --> 02:29:48,104
And enrichment.

1250
02:29:51,327 --> 02:29:51,727
Thank you.

1251
02:29:52,107 --> 02:29:53,469
Anything you'd like to add on this?

1252
02:29:54,289 --> 02:30:05,598
So I just want to make the committee, the council aware that through some negotiation, right now we pay about $185,000 a year for our copying over 57 devices.

1253
02:30:05,619 --> 02:30:12,945
55 of those are on one bulk contract and two are kind of on random contracts.

1254
02:30:13,565 --> 02:30:27,383
We're going to increase by 1 machine to 58 total, bring them all under the same contract and through some negotiations, we're going to reduce the annual costs down to 147000 dollars and by adding the paper cut.

1255
02:30:31,809 --> 02:30:39,018
solution we hope to save another $10,000 so bring our annual costs from about $185,000 down to $138,000 or so while increasing one machine increasing the functionality

1256
02:30:49,431 --> 02:30:57,676
Really in negotiating with many of our vendors, what I'm trying to do is drive as many dollars as possible towards student academics.

1257
02:30:58,096 --> 02:31:06,941
So respectfully requested, the council approves this five-year lease, which we need to execute by June 1st.

1258
02:31:08,261 --> 02:31:10,162
Thank you, Assistant Superintendent Cushing.

1259
02:31:10,883 --> 02:31:14,785
Is there any further discussion or questions by members of the council for Dr. Cushing?

1260
02:31:17,346 --> 02:31:18,247
Seeing none, is there a motion?

1261
02:31:19,516 --> 02:31:24,639
on the motion to approve by Vice President Colin seconded by seconded by counselor saying Mr. Clerk, please call the room.

1262
02:31:28,801 --> 02:31:30,842
Council Kelly has absent Vice President calls.

1263
02:31:32,122 --> 02:31:39,005
Councils are Council lemon Councils compelling Council saying President bears, yes.

1264
02:31:39,025 --> 02:31:43,968
561 absent the motion passes Thank you Dr. fishing.

1265
02:31:46,317 --> 02:31:58,868
Move to public participation and for school that counselor saying no that she is not available, is there a motion to postpone that paper to the next regular meeting on the motion of counselors saying seconded by counselors are all those in favor.

1266
02:31:59,589 --> 02:32:01,030
Opposed motion passes.

1267
02:32:02,331 --> 02:32:06,155
Is there anyone else who'd like to speak in public participation, either in person or on zoom.

1268
02:32:07,996 --> 02:32:09,838
Sure, give me one second to get the timer going.

1269
02:32:16,258 --> 02:32:17,099
Name and address for the record.

1270
02:32:17,119 --> 02:32:17,659
You have three minutes.

1271
02:32:21,302 --> 02:32:24,024
I attended tonight's session.

1272
02:32:24,305 --> 02:32:29,249
I've just been super excited about lots of very cool budget stuff.

1273
02:32:29,529 --> 02:32:34,513
And a really dope concert by our middle schoolers, which is really cool to see.

1274
02:32:34,593 --> 02:32:43,280
But mainly to support Councilor Lazaro's resolution that was unfortunately tabled, though I do understand the reasoning behind tabling it.

1275
02:32:44,781 --> 02:32:45,462
However, with that said, I'd

1276
02:32:46,523 --> 02:32:50,405
I'm still gonna make comments about it because I have a right to and you have to listen to them.

1277
02:32:50,465 --> 02:32:51,326
So enjoy.

1278
02:32:51,346 --> 02:33:03,993
I do think that it could benefit from an amendment that make have Buckley or have the chief of police present that report in person.

1279
02:33:06,014 --> 02:33:13,719
The issue that I think that that would address and that I observed in part during the earlier committee of the whole meeting

1280
02:33:14,421 --> 02:33:30,505
where the MPD came and gave a wonderful presentation was that there clearly is a sort of disconnect between the information that the MPD know or believe they know and what the residents of

1281
02:33:31,442 --> 02:33:32,563
the city, no.

1282
02:33:33,543 --> 02:33:44,891
So that would go a long way to sort of bridging that gap, I think, just to have that regular in-person presentation so that he could actually also come here and receive feedback directly from residents of the city.

1283
02:33:45,692 --> 02:33:54,598
Because without that, they're just going to continue to live in this thicker and thicker bubble of nonsense and spout some of the totally incorrect things that they were saying during today's committee of the whole meeting.

1284
02:33:55,638 --> 02:33:57,840
So that's my one recommendation.

1285
02:33:58,580 --> 02:34:00,582
And I do think that

1286
02:34:01,736 --> 02:34:17,292
I do urge you plead for urgency to provide more accountability from the MPD towards to the residents of the city because at the end of the day their job is to protect the city.

1287
02:34:18,453 --> 02:34:19,314
That is their one job.

1288
02:34:21,269 --> 02:34:32,994
Not to nitpick the mayor's speech earlier, but it isn't just to protect the so-called non-criminal citizens of the city.

1289
02:34:34,715 --> 02:34:37,896
Everyone here has rights, no matter what their status is.

1290
02:34:38,376 --> 02:34:45,279
And it's to protect everyone's rights, regardless of status, regardless if they are, even if they are criminals, they still need to be protected.

1291
02:34:45,299 --> 02:34:48,341
Their rights need to be protected by the police, even as they're enforcing laws.

1292
02:34:49,441 --> 02:34:55,205
So that's, I'm just gonna continue shouting to the ether until something happens with this.

1293
02:34:55,586 --> 02:34:56,566
All right, thanks guys.

1294
02:34:56,887 --> 02:34:57,247
Thank you.

1295
02:35:00,309 --> 02:35:01,730
Good to go to Zoom.

1296
02:35:01,750 --> 02:35:04,472
I have Mr. Castagnani on Zoom.

1297
02:35:04,552 --> 02:35:06,433
Name and address for the record, you have three minutes.

1298
02:35:17,621 --> 02:35:17,881
Hello.

1299
02:35:19,187 --> 02:35:20,348
Hi, Andy, you have three minutes.

1300
02:35:20,428 --> 02:35:21,568
Name and address for the record, please.

1301
02:35:22,429 --> 02:35:22,909
Can you hear me?

1302
02:35:22,929 --> 02:35:23,810
I have headphones on.

1303
02:35:24,550 --> 02:35:25,291
Yes, we can hear you.

1304
02:35:26,091 --> 02:35:26,371
Okay.

1305
02:35:26,411 --> 02:35:27,752
Thank you, Councilor Beers.

1306
02:35:29,213 --> 02:35:29,893
Thank you very much.

1307
02:35:33,335 --> 02:35:47,163
I hope you all had a good Memorial Day yesterday, and I want to thank the veterans for all they did to try to keep our

1308
02:35:48,085 --> 02:35:53,289
Democratic Republic alive for 250 years almost.

1309
02:35:54,490 --> 02:35:55,531
But I want to thank them.

1310
02:35:55,551 --> 02:35:57,153
They had a lot of courage.

1311
02:35:58,234 --> 02:35:59,154
I have a question.

1312
02:35:59,174 --> 02:36:04,098
Did I hear this evening that we have a city solicitor again?

1313
02:36:06,581 --> 02:36:07,782
Yes, Mr. Cassidy.

1314
02:36:08,522 --> 02:36:11,425
Kevin Foley has been hired to serve as the city solicitor.

1315
02:36:12,946 --> 02:36:13,246
Great.

1316
02:36:13,486 --> 02:36:14,907
Same office as usual.

1317
02:36:16,635 --> 02:36:21,277
The physical office, I guess it's the law department office on the second floor.

1318
02:36:24,479 --> 02:36:24,919
Thank you.

1319
02:36:30,581 --> 02:36:30,881
Thank you.

1320
02:36:30,921 --> 02:36:32,262
Is there anything else you'd like to comment on?

1321
02:36:33,623 --> 02:36:34,083
No, thanks.

1322
02:36:34,923 --> 02:36:35,724
Thank you so much, Andy.

1323
02:36:35,884 --> 02:36:36,364
Have a good night.

1324
02:36:37,524 --> 02:36:38,025
You too.

1325
02:36:38,125 --> 02:36:45,608
Is there anyone else who would like to comment in public participation?

1326
02:36:48,720 --> 02:36:52,124
Seeing no one at the podium and no hands on zoom.

1327
02:36:53,346 --> 02:36:59,033
Is there a motion on the floor on the motion adjourned by Councillor saying seconded by Vice President Collins.

1328
02:36:59,774 --> 02:37:00,475
All those in favor.

1329
02:37:01,196 --> 02:37:03,739
Opposed motion passes, and the meeting is adjourned.

1330
02:37:03,779 --> 02:37:04,040
Thank you.
