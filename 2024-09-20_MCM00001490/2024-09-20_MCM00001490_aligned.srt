1
00:00:00,631 --> 00:00:01,772
An old school theater.

2
00:00:02,412 --> 00:00:02,932
Oh, thank you.

3
00:00:03,152 --> 00:00:04,313
Somebody's recording about that.

4
00:00:04,353 --> 00:00:05,233
I forgot to do that.

5
00:00:05,273 --> 00:00:05,593
Sorry.

6
00:00:07,494 --> 00:00:09,755
Okay, we'll try and we'll try to remember it every time.

7
00:00:11,496 --> 00:00:19,359
So, a number of these items are, you know, related to that, and they've sort of been pending for, you know, at least a few months, I'd say.

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,522
So, you can sort of see some of the things that we're that are on our

9
00:00:25,622 --> 00:00:29,424
on our radar, active efforts to improve the theater.

10
00:00:30,665 --> 00:00:34,227
So the estimates for ceiling lights are digital.

11
00:00:35,748 --> 00:00:42,231
This is the notes from Paul noting that bids should be out very shortly.

12
00:00:43,612 --> 00:00:49,055
New banners we've been talking about for a couple of months and those are hung, which is nice.

13
00:00:49,235 --> 00:00:50,155
I haven't actually seen them.

14
00:00:50,195 --> 00:00:51,036
Has anybody seen them?

15
00:00:53,577 --> 00:00:53,797
No.

16
00:00:53,817 --> 00:00:54,037
Yes.

17
00:00:54,617 --> 00:00:55,357
You have, yeah?

18
00:00:55,918 --> 00:00:56,338
Look good.

19
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:57,418
New font.

20
00:00:58,018 --> 00:00:58,318
Nice.

21
00:00:58,998 --> 00:00:59,298
Great.

22
00:00:59,338 --> 00:01:00,158
I'll have to go by there.

23
00:01:00,178 --> 00:01:02,559
I actually was downtown today, but I didn't think about it.

24
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:03,679
Okay.

25
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:10,000
And the other thing that Paul shared was this third, fourth item about the marquee approval.

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:22,683
We're trying to put up a sort of digital display, but they need some documentation, workers' comp, et cetera, before we can get the work proceeding with a work permit.

27
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,401
So that's came in.

28
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:29,884
We had some hiccups with the lobby elevator that appears to be fixed.

29
00:01:33,006 --> 00:01:35,248
The roof leak update we're waiting for.

30
00:01:35,948 --> 00:01:38,650
I wasn't quite sure from Mike's notes.

31
00:01:40,071 --> 00:01:48,457
I just copied this from his notes that the vendor has the purchase order waiting for work to be completed.

32
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:50,819
Did you understand that Ken?

33
00:01:52,923 --> 00:01:55,677
uh... it well i know the last thing i want to see how much

34
00:01:57,656 --> 00:02:05,602
The last I heard from Paul is he had somebody go up and take a look at it with Matt Baxter from the BBP crew and they identified what needed to be done.

35
00:02:05,702 --> 00:02:07,944
So it looks like, and Paul was waiting for a quote.

36
00:02:08,004 --> 00:02:18,972
It looks like the quote came in and the purchase order has been issued and they are waiting for the vendor to get the work done, I guess.

37
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:19,633
Okay.

38
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:21,114
The way I'm reading that.

39
00:02:21,134 --> 00:02:24,056
Okay, so I'm sort of saying, change it like that.

40
00:02:25,077 --> 00:02:26,058
So, it's a little clearer.

41
00:02:26,198 --> 00:02:26,498
Okay.

42
00:02:26,538 --> 00:02:35,266
And then a couple of things that are still, you know, we haven't really made progress, the vestibule door automatic opener and the handicap ramp repairs.

43
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:38,768
And, oh, thank you.

44
00:02:38,788 --> 00:02:39,369
Yeah.

45
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,712
Picture of the banners in the chat.

46
00:02:42,752 --> 00:02:45,314
Ken shared the pictures of the banner in the chat.

47
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:45,694
Yeah.

48
00:02:46,515 --> 00:02:46,935
Great.

49
00:02:47,676 --> 00:02:49,357
That does look nice.

50
00:02:49,858 --> 00:02:50,178
All right.

51
00:02:52,617 --> 00:03:05,346
And so I think sort of moving on from those, the next items might be sort of more your feedback, Ken, around the gym windows restoration.

52
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:06,506
Do you have any updates?

53
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:09,789
Right, yes.

54
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:14,712
You remember last meeting we were exploring the possibility of a Community Preservation Act

55
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:25,383
Grant for the gym window restoration is similar to what we received for the theater windows a couple of years ago.

56
00:03:25,483 --> 00:03:33,491
Well, rather sheepishly, we discovered that the window that we showed pictures of last.

57
00:03:34,747 --> 00:04:02,858
meeting that looked like they had like this steel window steel frame windows had broken apart the window was actually just open so the window was intact rusted all to heck but it just had come open so apparently they tilt in so that uh led us to well paul was going to get his window consultant window vendor to look at the windows and see what what actually what they need the um

58
00:04:04,068 --> 00:04:11,811
Vendor was going to look at them anyway to see if they what they needed, but now it sounds like they need more repair than restoration.

59
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:13,851
The kind that the CPA.

60
00:04:14,732 --> 00:04:18,733
Funds and also some way to keep them from opening by themselves.

61
00:04:19,513 --> 00:04:22,854
The windows are right inside where the heating units are.

62
00:04:22,914 --> 00:04:24,115
So it's really bad to have them.

63
00:04:24,755 --> 00:04:28,680
Open all the time, so I haven't heard back and I check with Kevin Bailey today.

64
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,701
He hadn't heard back.

65
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:31,182
Kevin's the recreation director.

66
00:04:31,242 --> 00:04:37,969
He was unable to come tonight because of a family matter, but he had not heard back from Paul on the assessment from the window.

67
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:38,950
So the.

68
00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:42,034
CPA deadline came and went, it was.

69
00:04:43,467 --> 00:05:01,055
The end of the last month, so there was no application put in, but yeah, so we're waiting for the evaluation of the windows and what they need and then determine next steps, including where the money would come from.

70
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,556
So I would guess there's more.

71
00:05:03,576 --> 00:05:06,758
To come for the next meeting on that.

72
00:05:07,518 --> 00:05:07,858
Okay.

73
00:05:08,218 --> 00:05:08,478
All right.

74
00:05:08,498 --> 00:05:09,979
Regarding yeah.

75
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,640
Any questions on that?

76
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:20,355
Okay, and the basketball apparatus, so the friends of Chevalier received a grant.

77
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:26,841
Of trying to remember, that's not 5,000 dollars.

78
00:05:26,881 --> 00:05:36,190
I think the basketball apparatus, the hoops and the backboards and the apparatus that lowers and raises the.

79
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:41,853
basketball hoops, it's in really bad shape.

80
00:05:42,053 --> 00:05:43,634
And some of them are inoperable.

81
00:05:44,034 --> 00:05:48,817
So a quote was received for $28,000 to repair all six of them.

82
00:05:49,257 --> 00:05:56,421
Well, the friends got a grant of $5,000 for the work and the friends have committed 2,000 for the work.

83
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,583
So that's only 25% of the cost.

84
00:05:59,883 --> 00:06:03,425
And the recreation department has some funds available, but not,

85
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:04,766
the balance.

86
00:06:04,806 --> 00:06:15,233
So Kevin went back to the vendor and asked him for basically a estimate or a report on what they could do for $12,000.

87
00:06:16,954 --> 00:06:24,880
So he's hoping that might be enough to do like the four side baskets, which are in really bad shape, like they don't go up and down.

88
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,903
And he's waiting to hear back on that.

89
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:31,185
So that's the status on that one.

90
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:36,333
All right, thank you, yeah.

91
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:43,920
Do you know if there's any sort of timing or we just, I mean, do you think we'll get any news within the month or?

92
00:06:44,861 --> 00:06:46,562
Hard to say, hard to say.

93
00:06:46,602 --> 00:06:53,389
The only thing I can say definitively on the timing is that our grant has to be spent by March.

94
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:56,692
So hopefully it'll be done way sooner than that.

95
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:08,866
Okay, all right, yeah, so if we, yeah, how long it actually takes to do anything once it's been approved and whether the vendor's available and that sort of thing.

96
00:07:10,109 --> 00:07:19,815
Okay, the next item that was on the agenda was this designated areas for the ride share pickup and drop off that we've been talking about for a bit.

97
00:07:19,915 --> 00:07:29,741
And I know that for the Blumenreich group, congestion around the theater can be really problematic on show nights.

98
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:32,903
Jessica, maybe you have some updates on this?

99
00:07:34,524 --> 00:07:36,345
No, unfortunately, I don't have any updates.

100
00:07:37,032 --> 00:07:51,122
Okay, do we know if we've got a location picked out, or is this, we have to... I forget who, yeah, someone was supposed to... Somebody in facilities or transportation?

101
00:07:51,982 --> 00:07:58,827
Yeah, Andrew Mather from BBP has been in touch with Todd Blake, who's in charge of

102
00:08:00,755 --> 00:08:05,158
traffic and bike lanes and pedestrian improvements and stuff like that.

103
00:08:05,238 --> 00:08:11,202
And from what Andrew said, he was very receptive to the concept.

104
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:20,107
And there were a couple of places identified, one on Riverside Avenue that used to be a taxi cab stand, conveniently enough, and another one on Salem Street.

105
00:08:20,147 --> 00:08:21,648
So they're definitely exploring that.

106
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:27,011
And I haven't shared this with Andrew yet, but just anecdotally, I'll share quickly.

107
00:08:27,232 --> 00:08:28,733
I was outside the theater.

108
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:38,358
A couple of Fridays ago, about 8 15, I was just dropping something off at the post office and some a woman came up onto the sidewalk and said, do you know where deep cuts is?

109
00:08:38,378 --> 00:08:46,763
And I and she said, I said, yeah, he said, I just got I just took an Uber here and I told him to take me to deep cuts and they dropped me off here.

110
00:08:48,604 --> 00:08:49,385
Right in front of the fire.

111
00:08:49,425 --> 00:08:50,886
So, well, I was heading to the con and show.

112
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:52,587
So I said, well, I'll walk you down that way.

113
00:08:53,087 --> 00:09:02,874
But the concept of the ride share drop off area is not just for it's for all of the destinations in the square.

114
00:09:03,034 --> 00:09:06,717
And it made me think that if we had this designated area.

115
00:09:07,437 --> 00:09:12,101
This type of thing would be less likely to happen because people would be dropped off and picked up.

116
00:09:12,821 --> 00:09:32,995
Right at that location and also Jess and her office are starting to work on a wayfinding program and how great would it be for somebody to step off the curb when they get out of that ride share and they look up and there's a sign that says here's where deep cuts is here's where the royal house is here's where Chevalier is so it just sort of.

117
00:09:33,455 --> 00:09:42,802
I thought demonstrated the need for what Andrew and Todd are talking about for the benefit of Chevalier and deep cuts and all the destinations in the square.

118
00:09:43,342 --> 00:09:45,584
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

119
00:09:46,784 --> 00:09:59,313
That's in, I mean, I'm just sort of, as an ordinary person, I'm sort of wondering why it, you know, what more needs to, why does it take so long to come to this decision?

120
00:09:59,753 --> 00:10:02,035
Are there things that we are not aware of?

121
00:10:03,923 --> 00:10:11,438
You know, and to publicize it, I don't know if Jess wants to speak to that, but the gaming commission.

122
00:10:12,921 --> 00:10:14,564
Mitigation fund that the city.

123
00:10:15,941 --> 00:10:20,925
just received approval of at the end of May.

124
00:10:20,945 --> 00:10:27,830
10 or 11 projects were on there, including the lighting and the billboards for Chevalier, but one of them was to start a wayfinding study.

125
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:37,798
So I think it involves a consultant to, you know, review the existing conditions and, you know, come up with something that will

126
00:10:39,282 --> 00:10:42,623
Do what we need to do and I think.

127
00:10:44,523 --> 00:10:57,707
Sal, the head of the director of economic development indicated that might take until next fall to have it in place, but I think that's why it takes a while because they hire somebody to bring their expertise to bear on it.

128
00:10:58,584 --> 00:11:06,009
Yeah, since it's a project over $10,000, we'll have to do an RFP for a consultant.

129
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:08,791
So that's going to be the target for the fall.

130
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:13,475
And then hopefully, we get someone in for winter, spring and have that completed by then.

131
00:11:14,115 --> 00:11:16,017
Yeah.

132
00:11:16,117 --> 00:11:18,759
Is the ride share location part of that?

133
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:23,382
Or is that a decision that could be taken separately?

134
00:11:25,168 --> 00:11:37,462
That's separate and I imagine it's really just on the city court to reach out to ubers and lifts and the other TNT companies to designate that spot.

135
00:11:39,044 --> 00:11:39,265
Okay.

136
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:46,443
Well, maybe when Andrew's back with us next month, we might get an update and maybe some confirmation.

137
00:11:46,883 --> 00:11:47,644
That'd be really good.

138
00:11:48,425 --> 00:11:48,745
Okay.

139
00:11:48,765 --> 00:11:49,285
Thank you.

140
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,448
Thank you, Ken and Jessica for filling in the gaps.

141
00:11:54,109 --> 00:11:57,492
The next item is organ update, and I'm pretty sure that's Ken's.

142
00:12:00,128 --> 00:12:02,049
We're moving along on the Oregon.

143
00:12:02,109 --> 00:12:11,573
We are just about reaching the end of the work on a contract for $40,000 worth of work.

144
00:12:12,013 --> 00:12:15,935
We're really to the stage where a lot of the work has to be done by professionals.

145
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:22,497
We did a lot of the work early on with volunteers, but we're getting toward the part where they're finishing the

146
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:39,475
connections to all the different wind chests and pipes and it's really technical work and so we just are at the completion of that contract and hopefully by Friday we'll be approving another contract for about $45,000.

147
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:40,816
Our goal is to have the Oregon

148
00:12:45,243 --> 00:12:49,228
about 85% complete by next spring.

149
00:12:49,748 --> 00:12:51,470
It's about two-thirds complete now.

150
00:12:52,011 --> 00:13:03,904
The penciled-in date for a lot of this installation, the work is being done in a organ professional shop, is the week of Thanksgiving, and we've tentatively

151
00:13:05,365 --> 00:13:12,690
uh, got the okay from BBP on that, that they don't have any shows that week, uh, particularly Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday of Thanksgiving week.

152
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,352
If that changes, we have some, um, flexibility.

153
00:13:15,372 --> 00:13:21,856
Um, but if all goes well, we'll be in there with a crew Thanksgiving week.

154
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:26,499
And then a couple of days after that, depending on, um, how much they can get done.

155
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:33,664
But the idea is to get as much done in the, uh, in the shop, they actually set up basically what they're going to.

156
00:13:35,204 --> 00:13:46,274
construct, if you will, in the chamber in their shop so they can get it as close to ready to go and easy to install when they get there with it.

157
00:13:46,494 --> 00:13:55,962
There's a couple of things that are difficult to do that way, but that's the goal, to minimize the amount of time they have to spend there because obviously they're getting paid by the hour.

158
00:13:57,443 --> 00:13:59,145
But we're happy with how it's moving along.

159
00:13:59,185 --> 00:14:01,126
I did mention last month that we

160
00:14:01,847 --> 00:14:05,609
had an application in for a grant from the American Theater Organ Society.

161
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,351
We were not approved for that.

162
00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:11,512
It was for $9,500.

163
00:14:12,453 --> 00:14:17,816
But we have identified some other funders to provide what we were asking for.

164
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,717
So the funding's in place.

165
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:28,762
We just got a proposal from the professional yesterday that I'm going to try to get board approval of by the end of the week so we can keep it moving forward.

166
00:14:28,862 --> 00:14:31,103
So that's where it stands.

167
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:37,632
Okay, great.

168
00:14:38,793 --> 00:14:41,657
You mentioned a second contract of 45k.

169
00:14:42,578 --> 00:14:43,399
Where does that fit in?

170
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,044
Is that to finish the organ or is that

171
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:48,759
Oh, that would get it.

172
00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:51,022
That would get us to the 85 percent.

173
00:14:52,023 --> 00:14:53,204
OK, Mark.

174
00:14:53,505 --> 00:14:53,785
Yeah.

175
00:14:53,845 --> 00:14:57,950
Which is essentially the theater pipe organ sound.

176
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:04,397
The things that are in that remaining 15 percent are these theater organ has.

177
00:15:06,892 --> 00:15:10,774
a bunch of elements that are to make it sound like a full orchestra.

178
00:15:10,894 --> 00:15:15,275
These were created to be used to accompany silent films.

179
00:15:15,996 --> 00:15:22,979
Whereas in the in the early days, a small orchestra would often be used to accompany the films.

180
00:15:23,099 --> 00:15:29,381
Well, this organ was invented to sort of mimic the sound of an orchestra.

181
00:15:29,421 --> 00:15:31,222
So one organist could

182
00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:34,250
take the place of the entire orchestra.

183
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:45,079
So what would be left or there's an actual like xylophone and chimes and glockenspiel and sleigh bells and things like that.

184
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:50,523
And so those are the last things that would be unfinished by the end of this contract.

185
00:15:50,604 --> 00:15:54,607
And we actually just received a word of a different of a new

186
00:15:57,103 --> 00:16:05,167
Nonprofit grant making organization that focuses specifically on Oregon restoration and preservation.

187
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:10,829
So that's our next target to get the money for those last 5 pieces, which.

188
00:16:13,424 --> 00:16:17,966
could cost as much as $75,000 just for the five of them.

189
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:22,807
They're very intricate and labor-intensive things to restore.

190
00:16:22,907 --> 00:16:27,789
So that's why they're sort of on the back burner, because these other things we can afford, we don't have $75,000 for.

191
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:42,438
The remaining part, but we're hopeful that this new grant making, or this foundation would be receptive to that, especially if it would pretty much finish the project and make it usable.

192
00:16:44,355 --> 00:16:52,406
whenever BBP would like to incorporate it into shows or we could have our own, you know, silent movies or concerts and things like that.

193
00:16:52,486 --> 00:17:00,457
So everybody is eager to see it available so it can be integrated into the Schreyer schedule on a regular basis.

194
00:17:02,007 --> 00:17:03,449
Yeah, that's pretty impressive.

195
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,514
Okay.

196
00:17:07,534 --> 00:17:13,842
So, I guess that's all the sort of updates on sort of prior items.

197
00:17:13,882 --> 00:17:20,431
Does anybody have anything else that we've sort of mentioned in the past that hasn't been documented here?

198
00:17:26,143 --> 00:17:32,667
And then, so I guess the new business is somebody suggested friends of the Chevalier balcony seat campaign.

199
00:17:32,807 --> 00:17:34,067
Who wants to talk about that?

200
00:17:37,729 --> 00:17:38,910
I can go over that if you want.

201
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:43,052
So last meeting in particular and pretty much.

202
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:47,475
Almost every meeting 1 of the major.

203
00:17:48,355 --> 00:17:50,437
Projects near the top of the list.

204
00:17:51,597 --> 00:17:55,041
for capital improvements is the balcony seats.

205
00:17:56,223 --> 00:18:03,051
You may know that the orchestra level seats were replaced with upholstered seats in 2007, I think it was.

206
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:12,552
Long range plan is to do the same with the balcony seats, which are still the wooden original seats.

207
00:18:12,612 --> 00:18:17,134
So, not only replacing the ones that are there, but also modifying.

208
00:18:17,894 --> 00:18:25,778
The seating, particularly in the front corners where it's, it's obstructed for a number of reasons.

209
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:27,739
They don't really face the.

210
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:41,483
the stage and then also the stage was extended a number of years ago and that compromised the sight lines from the first couple of rows in the balcony level.

211
00:18:41,883 --> 00:18:44,824
So that's one modification that will need to be done.

212
00:18:45,564 --> 00:18:49,666
There's also been talk of converting the

213
00:18:52,377 --> 00:19:06,964
Projection booth, which is at the far top center of the balcony into seats that would accommodate about 44 more seats and is eager to get as many seats as possible in the building as close to 2000 as possible.

214
00:19:07,585 --> 00:19:08,125
The.

215
00:19:09,146 --> 00:19:16,609
Conversion to the upholstered seats in the orchestra level actually reduce the seating capacity because the.

216
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:30,463
The spacing between the rows were increased, so the number of rows was reduced and also a handicap seating was added and companion seats were added.

217
00:19:31,024 --> 00:19:37,871
Similarly, that probably would have to be done in the balcony when you come in from the elevator.

218
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:42,215
adding some handicap seats there, and then also aisle lighting.

219
00:19:42,255 --> 00:19:44,637
So that's a lot of what it entails.

220
00:19:45,097 --> 00:19:53,003
But from the last meeting in particular, we talked about, okay, if this is a project that we want to do, let's look at all the funding sources.

221
00:19:53,103 --> 00:20:05,153
So we have the Massachusetts Cultural Facilities Fund, Capital Facilities Fund, Mass Cultural Council, which money has been obtained before.

222
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:18,018
For the air conditioning in particular, there's the community preservation act, which may or may not be a source for new seats that would have to be explored.

223
00:20:18,438 --> 00:20:25,001
We have an annual allocation now from the mass gaming commission this year.

224
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,502
It was a 1Million dollars and.

225
00:20:27,642 --> 00:20:34,447
Lighting from the, for the led lighting and the ceiling and the digital billboards were 2 projects that were approved for that.

226
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:38,511
So next year, those, the applications are due in January.

227
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:40,292
So the seats.

228
00:20:41,113 --> 00:20:52,902
Might be the 1 of the projects every year as long as Paul Donato has been in the state legislature, he's been able to get an earmark for this current fiscal year that just started.

229
00:20:52,982 --> 00:20:53,242
It's 100,000. so.

230
00:20:55,844 --> 00:20:59,870
We're trying to look at all the buckets that could potentially pay for.

231
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:10,886
The new seats, which would be, you know, many hundreds of thousands of dollars and then at our last friends meeting, as we were talking about things we want to focus on.

232
00:21:11,727 --> 00:21:20,030
Paul Donato mentioned perhaps what the friends could contribute is a sponsor a seat campaign.

233
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:33,775
Let's say if the community was invited to sponsor a seat for X amount of dollars, perhaps at different levels, and in return for that, they might get their name on a seat.

234
00:21:33,795 --> 00:21:34,095
A lot of

235
00:21:36,574 --> 00:21:38,576
Facilities do campaigns like that.

236
00:21:38,676 --> 00:21:43,340
So, um, that could raise, you know, a portion of the money that could go.

237
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:48,485
So, again, we're trying to look at all the potential funding areas to.

238
00:21:49,446 --> 00:21:54,570
Pay for this project, which we, you know, we don't know at this point what it would cost, but that was the idea.

239
00:21:54,631 --> 00:22:00,436
So, I just wanted to make the commission aware of that and get any feedback they might have about.

240
00:22:01,497 --> 00:22:02,418
That being part of this.

241
00:22:03,158 --> 00:22:03,418
Mm-hmm.

242
00:22:03,878 --> 00:22:04,199
Okay.

243
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:12,783
Well, let's open it up for discussion or comments from everyone who's here.

244
00:22:12,803 --> 00:22:17,985
Yeah, I just want to make a point, Chris.

245
00:22:18,846 --> 00:22:24,849
Paul Donato has been absolutely instrumental and a pivotal resource in getting money for years and years and years.

246
00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:30,571
And I don't know if you know that every single ticket that's sold holds just under 1900.

247
00:22:32,223 --> 00:22:33,904
a dollar goes back to the city of Medford.

248
00:22:34,464 --> 00:22:41,747
So we're also trying to make them a little bit more responsible and stepping up to the plate and making some of these repairs.

249
00:22:41,847 --> 00:22:45,348
He sells out two shows, let's say, in a week, which is not uncommon.

250
00:22:45,388 --> 00:22:46,108
You're talking $3,800.

251
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:50,930
So we have to make the city more accountable.

252
00:22:51,951 --> 00:22:55,552
He has been certainly instrumental and

253
00:22:56,261 --> 00:23:05,787
Bill has also been very kind, often in matching up, pulling out of his own pocket to make sure that the Chevalier is, you know, the hidden gem in Medford.

254
00:23:06,447 --> 00:23:07,027
Right, right.

255
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:16,333
All these funding sources that Ken just named, I mean, are these annual applications or like, are they missed opportunities?

256
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,554
Well, Ken is like the Grand Wizard.

257
00:23:17,574 --> 00:23:18,474
I know, right?

258
00:23:18,494 --> 00:23:18,935
This is amazing.

259
00:23:18,955 --> 00:23:24,138
Ken is like the Grand Wizard of like, you know, the Jeopardy King of researching these and

260
00:23:25,482 --> 00:23:33,272
actually doing the work with minimal assistance, but kudos and accolades to Kent.

261
00:23:34,064 --> 00:23:42,509
Yeah, well, we've helped prepare the application information because technically, in a lot of cases, the city has to be the applicant because it owns the builder.

262
00:23:42,949 --> 00:23:49,553
But yeah, annually, the Massachusetts Cultural Facilities Fund, it's usually the end of January when their applications are due.

263
00:23:49,573 --> 00:23:56,777
And that's a great source for us because their focus specifically is on

264
00:23:57,617 --> 00:24:12,414
investing in facilities, performing arts centers, other cultural institutions that demonstrate the potential for increasing economic activity in the downtown areas where they're located.

265
00:24:13,195 --> 00:24:14,737
What's an average award for that?

266
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:18,049
It varies quite a bit.

267
00:24:18,069 --> 00:24:24,155
They're all on the Mass Cultural Council's website, all the ones that have been given over the years.

268
00:24:24,235 --> 00:24:27,518
So, but easily a few hundred thousand.

269
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:34,065
I forget what we got for the air conditioning, but the air conditioning was a extremely strong candidate because

270
00:24:34,745 --> 00:24:46,968
the facility couldn't be used basically in July and August so and it became a 12-month venue so that increased you know substantially the number of shows that BBP can have that continues to grow.

271
00:24:46,988 --> 00:24:51,269
That's probably a very competitive application though I guess they all are funding.

272
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:54,310
It is it's statewide but you know

273
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:59,375
I think Chevalier is a strong candidate.

274
00:25:00,315 --> 00:25:06,238
And yeah, other big time facilities like the Wang Center and the

275
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:16,693
Hanover center and Worcester and, you know, they're all, all different types have, have, have got them.

276
00:25:16,773 --> 00:25:24,916
So it's not, um, and I think the BPL may have gotten done some, but if you look at the list, it's, it's, it's, it's quite broad who gets them.

277
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:26,957
But, um, I think.

278
00:25:28,298 --> 00:25:32,821
While it is competitive, we have a very good case to make for our facility.

279
00:25:32,901 --> 00:25:47,951
And 1 of the things that we made successfully, or the city made successfully in the mitigation, the gaming mitigation fund, which is also annual in January that it has to 1 be something that.

280
00:25:50,861 --> 00:25:57,505
is needed to kind of offset the presence of the Encore Casino in our region.

281
00:25:57,846 --> 00:26:02,949
And the city also gets $100,000 a year separate from this million dollars that I mentioned.

282
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:08,052
The million is for all kinds of projects related to the casino's impact.

283
00:26:08,112 --> 00:26:11,595
But the $100,000 specifically comes to kind of help

284
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:16,601
Chevalier remained competitive with a brand new facility like Encore.

285
00:26:16,681 --> 00:26:19,463
Yeah, that goes right to, that 100K goes right to the theater?

286
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,224
Right to the theater, yeah.

287
00:26:21,284 --> 00:26:21,604
So that's 100,000.

288
00:26:21,644 --> 00:26:23,865
That's a healthy amount, yeah.

289
00:26:24,646 --> 00:26:28,588
Yeah, and the city is actually in the process of renegotiating that.

290
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:37,614
It's a surrounding community agreement where that 100,000 is spelled out because it was negotiated in 2014.

291
00:26:37,714 --> 00:26:39,916
So that's one reason to update it.

292
00:26:39,936 --> 00:26:40,897
Plus they're building,

293
00:26:41,777 --> 00:26:44,819
it's on hold right now there, but they're building a new facility across the street.

294
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:53,145
They'll have a 999 seat performing arts center that will have shows much like Chevalier puts on and also comedy and things like that.

295
00:26:53,185 --> 00:27:00,751
So, so again, what we stressed is, you know, this is the 1939 original high school auditorium.

296
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:09,457
And so we're doing everything we can to make it competitive with these brand new spanking, new, exciting, lively, um,

297
00:27:10,858 --> 00:27:14,583
Facilities that have all the modern lighting and all that kind of stuff.

298
00:27:14,663 --> 00:27:16,465
And we're starting to get there.

299
00:27:16,485 --> 00:27:21,050
The mitigation fund approved the LED lighting and the digital billboard.

300
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:24,795
So we're trying to make it more visually appealing.

301
00:27:25,255 --> 00:27:29,020
That's exclusively for the Chevalier and this year's project is the lighting and the billboard?

302
00:27:29,937 --> 00:27:31,939
No, it's not exclusively for the Chevalier.

303
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:38,686
The $1 million has about 5 categories under which the city can apply.

304
00:27:39,026 --> 00:27:42,790
Some of them are for public safety related to impact.

305
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:43,931
Some of them are traffic.

306
00:27:45,252 --> 00:27:49,897
People that go to the Encore through Medford, so there's traffic improvements.

307
00:27:49,917 --> 00:27:52,580
But did you say there's an allocation specifically for the feeder?

308
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:54,004
Of 100,000.

309
00:27:54,164 --> 00:27:55,586
Yeah, that's right.

310
00:27:55,686 --> 00:27:59,511
And is that what you do in the lighting and display?

311
00:28:00,091 --> 00:28:03,996
No, the lighting and the digital billboards came from the million.

312
00:28:04,697 --> 00:28:06,619
It was one of the 11 projects because that far exceeded $100,000.

313
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:08,301
The $100,000 went to other smaller projects.

314
00:28:13,832 --> 00:28:14,413
Gotcha, gotcha.

315
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:18,239
So that's annual, CPA is annual.

316
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:22,767
But that's more, is CPA more preservation?

317
00:28:23,067 --> 00:28:27,395
Like is that, like you seem to indicate that couldn't be used for new seats, say.

318
00:28:28,121 --> 00:28:38,430
It's hard to say it's historic preservation, but 1 successful application was received because.

319
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:44,295
It also covers access to historic facilities, right?

320
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:44,676
So.

321
00:28:45,296 --> 00:28:50,641
We got a grant for adding a handicapped.

322
00:28:52,002 --> 00:29:03,410
chairlift as a backup in case the elevator fails, which it has done a couple of times, and also completing an ADA restroom that was unfinished.

323
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:08,454
So, that could be one element because it would improve access.

324
00:29:08,554 --> 00:29:14,218
So, it just would be up, and especially with the additional handicap seating that doesn't exist now.

325
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:18,461
So, it might be a stretch, but you never know.

326
00:29:18,521 --> 00:29:20,563
On the other hand... The code is preservation.

327
00:29:21,315 --> 00:29:22,876
You know, you got to keep it current.

328
00:29:23,576 --> 00:29:25,818
I say on the other hand, we're replacing the original seats.

329
00:29:25,878 --> 00:29:29,120
So that might not be, you know, sort of historical preservation.

330
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:38,846
There might be a, uh, not as much support for that from the CPA, but it's definitely next year, putting in an eligibility form for sure.

331
00:29:39,046 --> 00:29:39,246
Sure.

332
00:29:39,406 --> 00:29:45,290
Well, but you know, all these are different levers that you have to pull and it's seems really helpful.

333
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:45,730
You can,

334
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:53,040
Perhaps with the Gaming Commission allocation of 100K, that helps fund like ongoing maintenance, say?

335
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:53,720
I don't know.

336
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,801
And then these other awards are nice for bigger things.

337
00:29:57,021 --> 00:29:58,381
Is that how it's been working or, yeah?

338
00:29:58,561 --> 00:29:58,781
Yeah.

339
00:29:59,741 --> 00:30:01,382
Well, Chris, are you familiar with the CPA?

340
00:30:02,022 --> 00:30:04,102
Were you a resident here about five years ago?

341
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:05,623
When it passed?

342
00:30:06,323 --> 00:30:06,523
Yes.

343
00:30:07,123 --> 00:30:07,743
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

344
00:30:08,964 --> 00:30:10,064
Okay, so you're familiar with that.

345
00:30:10,084 --> 00:30:10,224
Good.

346
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,622
Yeah, it seems like – I mean they've stretched it a long way.

347
00:30:13,802 --> 00:30:19,567
They've done a lot of playgrounds and a lot of different work around town, at least what I think I've seen.

348
00:30:19,587 --> 00:30:20,648
Yeah, they have a certain criteria.

349
00:30:20,688 --> 00:30:22,949
It's all over the board, which is good.

350
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:25,091
We happen to fall into that.

351
00:30:26,537 --> 00:30:27,478
That's great.

352
00:30:27,538 --> 00:30:36,783
But to your question about Chevalier, yes, the smaller amount can be used for anything, and it has been used for smaller repair projects and things like that.

353
00:30:37,183 --> 00:30:47,329
The bigger ones have to have a direct, the million dollar fund, they have to demonstrate clearly that it's something related to the impact of

354
00:30:48,109 --> 00:30:49,470
the presence of the casino.

355
00:30:50,131 --> 00:30:57,657
For example, one project that the city had on its list originally was about for a facade improvement.

356
00:30:58,478 --> 00:31:04,523
And they were like, the commission said, that really doesn't have anything to do with the presence of the casino.

357
00:31:04,543 --> 00:31:11,529
So fortunately, they allowed the city to swap that out and with the wayfinding project, I think it was.

358
00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:13,670
But it does have to be connected.

359
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:16,213
And another example, like the city of Cambridge,

360
00:31:17,113 --> 00:31:24,880
Applied for 3 new motorcycles for their police department and the commission said, well, you already have motorcycles.

361
00:31:25,141 --> 00:31:27,983
You had motorcycles before the casino came along.

362
00:31:28,043 --> 00:31:29,725
So that we're not going to fund that.

363
00:31:29,785 --> 00:31:34,169
So, again, it has to be something directly specify the funding source has their own mission.

364
00:31:34,389 --> 00:31:34,589
Right?

365
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,231
You just, you got to know how it speaks to it.

366
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:40,765
Very much, but I think we, and you'll, you'll appreciate this.

367
00:31:40,785 --> 00:31:43,968
The biggest thing we need to do, and we're starting to do that.

368
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:49,333
So, you know, this is a major, a major project in an active venue.

369
00:31:49,413 --> 00:31:49,694
So.

370
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,536
Paul Riggi, the facilities director and.

371
00:31:53,357 --> 00:32:01,182
Raul, the general manager and Mike with the commission and yourself and the friends and everybody that's involved in making this happen.

372
00:32:01,222 --> 00:32:07,906
We have to look at the target for when we'd want to do this and say, OK, we want to do this in August of 2025.

373
00:32:07,946 --> 00:32:09,046
So, you know, think about.

374
00:32:12,028 --> 00:32:24,118
A period when perhaps the theaters is not that heavily used and they could carve out some time where it's either closed or the balcony is just not available for shows and then and begin to look at it.

375
00:32:24,178 --> 00:32:31,724
Now we have the city has to look at the structure, get a structural engineer and evaluate, say, the.

376
00:32:33,646 --> 00:32:39,696
Possibility of removing that projection booth is, is it possible, you know, there's big, thick walls that surround it.

377
00:32:39,736 --> 00:32:42,821
So, but so we need to be kind of backing up from, let's say.

378
00:32:43,483 --> 00:32:46,247
Next summer and and and get.

379
00:32:47,283 --> 00:33:09,432
moving on with the city now has a retainer with they call it a house doctor some people that do some of this type of analysis and evaluation from an engineering standpoint so we need to start start mapping out like a 12-month plan and say okay we're going to start with that we're going to start with getting somebody in there to give us an initial quote so we have some sort of

380
00:33:10,494 --> 00:33:11,915
dollar figure to go on.

381
00:33:12,816 --> 00:33:14,937
We don't really have that now because nobody's looked at it.

382
00:33:15,257 --> 00:33:20,821
You know, figure out what the timetable is on delivering the seats, producing the states, installing the seats, and all that kind of stuff.

383
00:33:20,861 --> 00:33:23,984
And then think strategically about the funding.

384
00:33:24,064 --> 00:33:36,132
Okay, we need to have a number to know how much it is by January so we can put in the application to the Mass Culture Facilities Fund and we can put in the application to the Mass Gaming Commission Mitigation Fund.

385
00:33:36,192 --> 00:33:39,235
So we really need to be looking at it, you know, from that

386
00:33:39,855 --> 00:33:42,580
end-to-end standpoint, and hopefully we can start doing that.

387
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:49,551
And that's part of the reason why the seat campaign idea came up, because we do know pretty much what the main funding sources would be.

388
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,595
And to Cindy's point about Paul Donato's help,

389
00:33:53,751 --> 00:34:01,276
specifically when the, um, orchestra level seats were done, he got much more money that year for the seats.

390
00:34:01,396 --> 00:34:02,837
It was several hundred thousand dollars.

391
00:34:02,877 --> 00:34:05,519
So it's, you know, it's a coordination on funding.

392
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:07,760
It's a coordination on execution.

393
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,141
You, you do this all the time.

394
00:34:09,221 --> 00:34:13,984
So, uh, that's, that's what we're trying to get in motion, I think.

395
00:34:14,265 --> 00:34:17,567
And, um, hopefully we can, we can, uh,

396
00:34:18,025 --> 00:34:24,087
Pull it off if that's what the people that involved think should be kind of the next big project.

397
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:32,150
And I think it's high up there in addition to the interior lighting that's coming exterior lighting on the building.

398
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,411
Right?

399
00:34:34,471 --> 00:34:36,291
Lobby improvements and things like that.

400
00:34:36,351 --> 00:34:40,072
But I think the next, the next big 1 is the is the balcony seats.

401
00:34:40,092 --> 00:34:41,173
Would you agree with that role?

402
00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:45,319
Yes, I agree.

403
00:34:46,279 --> 00:34:48,320
That's been a long time coming.

404
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,400
We've been advocating for that for since the beginning.

405
00:34:53,421 --> 00:34:56,461
So that's something that that will tie everything together.

406
00:34:57,581 --> 00:34:59,362
It's the balcony seating.

407
00:35:01,522 --> 00:35:05,883
So it sounds like January is a pretty big date for at least a couple of these.

408
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:12,484
You know, do you be able to say what what the deadlines are for the other

409
00:35:13,755 --> 00:35:17,257
I mean, maybe we can come back with that, but just laying that out for one.

410
00:35:19,738 --> 00:35:25,480
I can help out to develop a plan for something like this.

411
00:35:26,441 --> 00:35:28,422
It would be very rough and conceptual.

412
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:39,747
By January, we could have a basic idea for how long the process is going to take, including, you know, we're asking for

413
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:44,933
All of our funding at that point, you know, it would start with your survey and analysis.

414
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:49,275
You know, who can tell me what I can and can't build here and how many seats can I get in here?

415
00:35:49,975 --> 00:35:52,736
That would be sort of your first cost that you'd look to spend.

416
00:35:53,036 --> 00:35:53,316
I don't know.

417
00:35:53,336 --> 00:35:53,976
This is how I do it.

418
00:35:54,056 --> 00:35:56,917
I'm sure you guys might have a more cost-effective way to do it.

419
00:35:58,838 --> 00:36:07,901
And then the second part of that plan is the schedule for coordination and bidding and the like, and maybe finishing any other design or structural questions.

420
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:15,344
And then you're getting into, you know, at the end of bidding, you need to make an award, somebody needs to order the stuff and plan the work.

421
00:36:18,046 --> 00:36:23,730
For a project this scale, that's going to take more than 12 months from today, which is next August.

422
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:29,214
It could be 14 months, I don't know, just to get to that point where we're ready to actually execute construction.

423
00:36:30,415 --> 00:36:31,876
So I don't think we can really say

424
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:40,687
The time frame that we could necessarily build this right now, but if we start working on it by January, we could have a pretty good plan set up for how long that'll take.

425
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:48,070
And then we could sync that up with theater schedules to see when that might work out.

426
00:36:48,971 --> 00:36:49,551
Would that be helpful?

427
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:53,040
I would say very much.

428
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,181
Paul Riggi is the director of facilities.

429
00:36:55,201 --> 00:37:13,529
He's not on the call tonight, unfortunately, but he has 18 buildings to cover, including City Hall, where they're putting in a new elevator at present, the new fire station that's in the works, you know, the senior center, the library, which, you know, is newer, but still has its issues.

430
00:37:13,569 --> 00:37:14,690
So I think

431
00:37:16,717 --> 00:37:22,519
he would hopefully welcome your contributions and partnership on this.

432
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:25,559
So I think it would be very useful.

433
00:37:25,699 --> 00:37:38,763
To your question about the deadlines, yes, January 31st would be the deadline for both the Cultural Facilities Fund application and the Gaming Commission Fund if the schedules hold.

434
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:45,245
Now CPA, the applications are due in October and they're usually awarded

435
00:37:46,385 --> 00:37:51,366
Early in the next year, they have to be approved by the city council ultimately.

436
00:37:52,246 --> 00:37:58,508
So, this round, the applicant, we wouldn't be in a position to apply for that this round.

437
00:37:59,088 --> 00:38:10,331
And then the fiscal year for the state legislature, obviously, is July 1 to June 30. so the budget season just ended for this fiscal year and mentioned Paul got 100,000 dollars.

438
00:38:12,811 --> 00:38:30,118
If he's in the legislature next year, you know, springtime, he'll be working to get what he can in the budget, so it would be good to have a conversation with him, say how much, you know, does he think we might be able to get?

439
00:38:30,138 --> 00:38:39,962
You know, the budget, the state revenue has been all over the place, but the time to sit with him and

440
00:38:41,082 --> 00:38:45,910
figure out what he thinks he could ask for and we'll at that time know what we need.

441
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:50,819
It sounds like based on how you've laid it out, that would be the time for that one.

442
00:38:52,449 --> 00:38:54,090
So, those would be the main ones.

443
00:38:54,110 --> 00:39:02,497
The 1 little caveat there is some of these require a match and I think the cultural facilities fund is 1 of them.

444
00:39:02,537 --> 00:39:06,621
So that's another element that the city needs to be thinking about.

445
00:39:06,701 --> 00:39:06,901
Okay.

446
00:39:06,921 --> 00:39:08,782
If we're going to apply for 250,000 dollars from.

447
00:39:12,285 --> 00:39:19,990
Fund X, we have to be prepared to demonstrate that we have that money to provide our portion of the match.

448
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:25,233
And Cindy was saying a dollar per ticket goes into the restoration fund.

449
00:39:25,293 --> 00:39:30,776
So perhaps that could start to be, I don't know.

450
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:40,423
For this project, if we deem that this is the project, we're going to put our most effort behind.

451
00:39:40,483 --> 00:39:42,285
So that's another 1 that.

452
00:39:42,705 --> 00:39:46,047
Another pocket of money, but it would probably be good to have a separate.

453
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:47,529
There's a capital facilities.

454
00:39:48,289 --> 00:40:00,839
Subcommittee of the commission and with you coming on board, it probably is a good time to have a meeting of that subcommittee with Paul Riggie and Mike and Raul and yeah.

455
00:40:01,459 --> 00:40:13,029
We can we can talk in a little more detail about the things you just described and then other projects that might be able to also continue with the other sources of money that we know about.

456
00:40:13,049 --> 00:40:14,270
That's great.

457
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:16,993
Yeah, I mean, all of this I view as like potential funding source.

458
00:40:17,013 --> 00:40:18,034
So you got to make your pitch.

459
00:40:19,115 --> 00:40:21,797
And when you do, you know, interesting things could occur.

460
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:27,502
So whether it's for these or for any others, we can just develop a plan and shop it around and see what kind of funding we can get.

461
00:40:29,388 --> 00:40:30,369
I'm excited to help out with that.

462
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:38,697
Yeah, and there was talk that some of this could be done in phases, like, say, the work on the projection booth.

463
00:40:38,877 --> 00:40:42,341
If that could be taken out, maybe some of that work can be done.

464
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:43,702
Obviously, you wouldn't want to leave it.

465
00:40:45,063 --> 00:40:50,169
No, but you'd want to be able to have the seats put in, you know, it's a pretty major shutdown to do it all at once.

466
00:40:50,269 --> 00:40:58,158
So, you know, yeah, it'd be good to give the booking agent plenty of opportunities to still book while we're doing the work and you could do it.

467
00:40:58,399 --> 00:40:58,799
Right.

468
00:40:59,019 --> 00:41:00,201
Spread the cost out too, you know.

469
00:41:00,918 --> 00:41:01,138
Yeah.

470
00:41:01,198 --> 00:41:11,369
And they have some creative ideas for the corners of the balcony, like putting like high seats, like you see it, you know, like Fenway Park in the corner where they put those seats in there.

471
00:41:11,389 --> 00:41:11,929
Oh, yeah.

472
00:41:11,949 --> 00:41:12,129
Yeah.

473
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:12,390
OK.

474
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:16,894
Would make those seats go from obstructed view to premium.

475
00:41:17,735 --> 00:41:25,727
Top shelf seats, you know, yeah, so that maybe could be something that could be done in a phase, you know, the front quarter.

476
00:41:25,807 --> 00:41:33,178
I believe that one of the important phases should be some type of LED lighting on the floors and the balcony.

477
00:41:34,078 --> 00:41:36,178
like we have downstairs in the orchestra.

478
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:44,400
You know, if you go up there, once the show starts, lights go out, it's completely dark and you're at an incline.

479
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,420
So it's like potential for someone to get hurt.

480
00:41:48,601 --> 00:42:00,503
So I think adding some type of LED lighting should be one of the, you know, priorities before anything on the floors at the balcony.

481
00:42:01,843 --> 00:42:02,743
Yeah, interesting.

482
00:42:03,727 --> 00:42:05,948
That's for code purposes, yeah.

483
00:42:07,509 --> 00:42:22,279
Chris, just for notification, as you heard, Paul is responsible for 18 city-owned buildings, but I have been abundantly clear and vocal that Chevalier is the only city-owned building that generates revenue, so our staff should be elevated.

484
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:30,024
And sometimes we are perceived, or has been in the future, we're trying to change this, in the past, excuse me, as the orphan.

485
00:42:30,344 --> 00:42:30,684
Sure.

486
00:42:32,292 --> 00:42:35,593
We need to make sure that our needs are known and addressed.

487
00:42:37,774 --> 00:42:42,916
Because this is, again, a hidden gem with this, you know, six largest data in New England.

488
00:42:43,316 --> 00:42:46,317
I don't want to wax poetic, but I'm adamant about that.

489
00:42:46,417 --> 00:42:46,617
So.

490
00:42:47,157 --> 00:42:48,458
Yeah, it makes total sense.

491
00:42:49,998 --> 00:42:52,559
And, you know, I just see them all as a funding source.

492
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:56,381
How can we get to them and give them a really good case that they should invest in this?

493
00:42:57,421 --> 00:42:57,581
Yeah.

494
00:42:58,908 --> 00:43:04,671
Yeah, I said, and that seems Chris, you're ideally qualified to help develop that kind of plan.

495
00:43:05,252 --> 00:43:09,234
It was higher ed and municipal governments operate similarly.

496
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:14,017
Yeah, this is exciting.

497
00:43:14,237 --> 00:43:16,378
It's a really fun goal to get done.

498
00:43:16,438 --> 00:43:24,062
And, you know, the fact that there's any funding sources out there, like, you can really, it gives you something to work with and get stuff done.

499
00:43:24,082 --> 00:43:26,544
You know, things like lighting is.

500
00:43:27,568 --> 00:43:29,009
pretty low dollar these days.

501
00:43:29,029 --> 00:43:37,012
They've got really small, compact units that are kind of cheap, that can move, you know, move the needle in a lot of places.

502
00:43:37,093 --> 00:43:39,874
So anyways, I'm looking forward to get started.

503
00:43:39,894 --> 00:43:44,916
So again, that's a separate subcommittee, or I mean, I was going to ask, can I get a tour of the theater?

504
00:43:45,777 --> 00:43:48,658
Maybe can we set up a meeting with, who is it, Mike?

505
00:43:50,748 --> 00:43:52,789
Yeah, Mike's the acting chairperson.

506
00:43:53,549 --> 00:43:55,490
I'd also be happy to lead you on a tour.

507
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:55,830
Of course.

508
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:57,450
I was expecting you.

509
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:58,271
Yeah.

510
00:43:58,391 --> 00:44:00,851
Who's the city department head?

511
00:44:00,911 --> 00:44:02,212
Paul Righi.

512
00:44:02,712 --> 00:44:02,892
Right.

513
00:44:02,912 --> 00:44:04,153
R-I-G-H-I.

514
00:44:04,233 --> 00:44:04,573
Yeah.

515
00:44:04,653 --> 00:44:09,394
He's regularly on the meetings, but was out, I guess, out of town this month.

516
00:44:09,894 --> 00:44:10,075
Sure.

517
00:44:10,955 --> 00:44:14,136
Well, maybe we could set something up for early September.

518
00:44:15,276 --> 00:44:20,098
I'd love to get oriented and help develop some data for this.

519
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:21,472
Yeah, sure.

520
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:25,233
Yeah, you'll be interested to see, because it's an old building.

521
00:44:25,313 --> 00:44:40,636
And just an example of getting the lights on each of the aisle seats in every row upstairs will be somewhat challenging, just in terms of their access, if they're going to be wired.

522
00:44:40,656 --> 00:44:41,596
So little things like that.

523
00:44:41,616 --> 00:44:42,456
It's an old system.

524
00:44:42,496 --> 00:44:42,876
Yeah, yeah.

525
00:44:42,936 --> 00:44:43,936
I don't mean to oversimplify it.

526
00:44:43,956 --> 00:44:44,056
Yeah.

527
00:44:44,196 --> 00:44:46,477
A lot of places, you've got to get illumination.

528
00:44:47,297 --> 00:44:48,077
Right, right.

529
00:44:49,185 --> 00:44:57,853
Um, but, yeah, yeah, what are the other projects like the lighting and signage is the city running that or who's.

530
00:44:58,614 --> 00:45:02,818
Who's running point on that was basically.

531
00:45:03,338 --> 00:45:07,663
Yeah, Paul, the city, the facilities directors is in charge.

532
00:45:08,563 --> 00:45:08,744
Nice.

533
00:45:09,344 --> 00:45:09,584
Yeah.

534
00:45:09,965 --> 00:45:10,305
Okay.

535
00:45:10,445 --> 00:45:11,887
And in consultation with the.

536
00:45:13,058 --> 00:45:16,779
Blumenreich presents people, particularly like a marquee has been donated.

537
00:45:17,539 --> 00:45:27,301
From the Wilbur theater through the Bill Blumenreich himself, and that's being going to be installed on the side of the building in addition to the digital billboards on the front.

538
00:45:27,321 --> 00:45:37,664
So, Paul is shepherding that through, and it requires a permit and notification of the butters if they're within a certain distance of and all that kind of thing.

539
00:45:37,684 --> 00:45:40,684
So, yeah, he's, he's seeing that through.

540
00:45:41,185 --> 00:45:41,345
Cool.

541
00:45:41,965 --> 00:45:42,145
Okay.

542
00:45:42,825 --> 00:45:42,925
Yeah.

543
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:56,318
Ken, I was thinking maybe you could share that Google Doc link again so that Chris can see some of the other improvements that have been raised and where we are.

544
00:45:56,338 --> 00:45:57,379
He sent me a list before the meeting.

545
00:45:57,799 --> 00:45:58,520
Oh, you've got that?

546
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,361
Yeah, I was presenting that earlier.

547
00:46:00,902 --> 00:46:01,562
Okay.

548
00:46:01,602 --> 00:46:03,584
Yeah, Mike asked me to send that to him this morning, so I did.

549
00:46:03,624 --> 00:46:05,206
Okay, all right, so we've got that.

550
00:46:05,226 --> 00:46:08,849
I can throw it in the chat again if anybody else needs it.

551
00:46:11,111 --> 00:46:12,492
Sure, I think I've got it linked.

552
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:28,833
Okay, yeah, I think the next, you know, the after after, if we get the upstairs balcony seats done, then, you know, the next big sort of thing seems to be the, the foyer.

553
00:46:30,393 --> 00:46:33,214
What, what, what's, what did the rest of you?

554
00:46:33,314 --> 00:46:33,714
Lobby.

555
00:46:34,274 --> 00:46:35,295
The lobby, the lobby.

556
00:46:35,895 --> 00:46:36,455
Yeah, thank you.

557
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:44,934
But that also would be a huge job and very disruptive for any kind of presentation.

558
00:46:46,014 --> 00:46:46,375
Thank you.

559
00:46:46,615 --> 00:46:47,355
Thank you for the link.

560
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:59,903
So are there any other new business items that we want to talk about?

561
00:47:01,984 --> 00:47:07,447
No, I just want to let people know that the Friends of Travalia, their annual meeting is October 24th.

562
00:47:09,252 --> 00:47:15,194
It'll be great if people could come and dovetailing that, we're working on a number of different issues.

563
00:47:15,574 --> 00:47:18,054
One is increasing the membership.

564
00:47:18,495 --> 00:47:20,295
So it's short money for $20.

565
00:47:20,435 --> 00:47:26,037
Any new members or current members.

566
00:47:27,597 --> 00:47:30,098
By it on, we'd be quite happy, right, Ken?

567
00:47:31,758 --> 00:47:37,580
And we have a subcommittee that is trying to, again, strategize to see how we can

568
00:47:39,133 --> 00:48:05,599
optimize I've talked to Bill about membership options and he's all in he's been very receptive etc so if folks could make it on October 24th at seven o'clock Maple Park condos 65 Valley Street that would be great because we usually the mayor does come Bill is there we did just have a 30th anniversary

569
00:48:07,032 --> 00:48:09,833
We had a knockoff Fritz Tamari at the Chevalier.

570
00:48:09,854 --> 00:48:14,676
There were a few glitches and Raoul stepped up to the plate and handled it magnificently.

571
00:48:14,816 --> 00:48:16,397
So that was all good.

572
00:48:18,198 --> 00:48:26,702
And I will say that probably half of the board has been on the board for 25 years or more.

573
00:48:27,383 --> 00:48:30,804
So that's a testimony to the commitment and the efforts of the friends.

574
00:48:32,145 --> 00:48:33,666
Yeah.

575
00:48:33,846 --> 00:48:35,407
Cindy, what was that date again, please?

576
00:48:36,975 --> 00:48:39,657
October 24th, it's the Thursday.

577
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:41,219
Yes.

578
00:48:41,659 --> 00:48:43,281
And you said at 7 p.m.?

579
00:48:44,742 --> 00:48:45,022
Yes.

580
00:48:45,382 --> 00:48:46,924
And it's at Maple Park Condos.

581
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:50,767
The address, I don't know, it's on the Fells Way, right across from St.

582
00:48:50,787 --> 00:48:51,628
Francis Church.

583
00:48:52,148 --> 00:48:53,529
It's 65 Valley Street.

584
00:48:55,451 --> 00:48:56,071
Oh, all right.

585
00:48:56,092 --> 00:48:59,414
65 Valley Street.

586
00:48:59,615 --> 00:49:00,475
I'll just put that.

587
00:49:00,695 --> 00:49:02,057
Oops, didn't get that right.

588
00:49:03,218 --> 00:49:03,538
Thank you.

589
00:49:05,129 --> 00:49:06,870
65 Valley Street, okay.

590
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:13,752
And we have a good cross-section of, I mean, Kevin Bailey usually speaks, et cetera, like I said, the mayor.

591
00:49:15,232 --> 00:49:23,894
Debbie Amaral from Hawaii, because the friends do a lot more than just acknowledging the Chevalier.

592
00:49:25,055 --> 00:49:28,996
So it's a good evening, but I'm prejudiced, so.

593
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:31,489
Yeah.

594
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:42,256
Is there any new update regarding the future of the gym and the rec center, the kids' rec area?

595
00:49:43,577 --> 00:49:44,437
In terms of a move?

596
00:49:45,138 --> 00:49:45,498
Yeah.

597
00:49:46,058 --> 00:49:46,879
Or just in general?

598
00:49:47,807 --> 00:49:56,075
Well, I know, you know, there was, we have sort of seemed to have been talking of them eventually moving and trying to find a new venue.

599
00:49:58,317 --> 00:50:04,722
How, how is any, is any progress on that or plans solidifying?

600
00:50:04,943 --> 00:50:05,163
No.

601
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:09,367
Well, the hope was that they were going to go into St.

602
00:50:09,407 --> 00:50:10,728
Francis, but

603
00:50:11,306 --> 00:50:12,426
Unfortunately, that fell through.

604
00:50:12,446 --> 00:50:17,387
The SJS has approved it, but I guess there's a mega asbestos problems, et cetera.

605
00:50:17,427 --> 00:50:24,988
So we didn't, you know, require an investment of a million plus to examine that.

606
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:27,289
So I haven't heard anything lately.

607
00:50:27,329 --> 00:50:28,509
I don't know if Ken, have you?

608
00:50:28,529 --> 00:50:32,370
No, not at all.

609
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:33,310
No.

610
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:34,010
Okay.

611
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:40,531
And the Tufts Curtis School, what was their story with that one as a venue, possible venue?

612
00:50:41,969 --> 00:50:44,450
It was something Kevin Bailey expressed an interest in.

613
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:56,774
There's the Curtis Tufts Alternative School, which is down on Main Street near Tufts Park, which is the summer kind of headquarters of the Rec Center.

614
00:50:57,574 --> 00:51:02,616
But that would be challenging because the building is also old.

615
00:51:02,676 --> 00:51:03,656
It doesn't have a gym.

616
00:51:03,916 --> 00:51:05,077
It doesn't, I don't think, has

617
00:51:06,123 --> 00:51:08,645
handicap access that you need today.

618
00:51:08,745 --> 00:51:22,716
But on the other hand, there's discussion seriously about the Curtis Tufts School leaving that location and perhaps being the students being integrated into the new high school that's under discussion.

619
00:51:22,736 --> 00:51:25,758
But the new high school is probably at least five years away.

620
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:30,642
So it's still, I think, still pretty much a long term idea.

621
00:51:31,447 --> 00:51:32,207
Very long term.

622
00:51:32,588 --> 00:51:32,888
Okay.

623
00:51:33,628 --> 00:51:34,048
All right.

624
00:51:34,389 --> 00:51:34,729
Great.

625
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:41,092
So, any last comments, observations?

626
00:51:42,373 --> 00:51:49,097
Otherwise, I guess our next meeting should be about a month from today on a Wednesday evening.

627
00:51:50,057 --> 00:51:53,099
And I don't know that date.

628
00:51:53,859 --> 00:51:56,321
Is that something that we set or does Mike choose it?

629
00:51:57,818 --> 00:51:59,499
It's usually the second Wednesday of the month.

630
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:10,068
Mike usually has it on the agenda next meeting, didn't this time, but I would tentatively figure September 11th.

631
00:52:10,569 --> 00:52:17,214
It can't be September 18th because the one and only Ringo Starr is performing at Shabbat night, so that's out.

632
00:52:17,875 --> 00:52:19,016
Have you already got your tickets?

633
00:52:19,777 --> 00:52:20,217
I do!

634
00:52:22,278 --> 00:52:26,760
We just looked the other night and it was almost full, fully booked.

635
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,481
That's why I was asking you about ushering.

636
00:52:30,501 --> 00:52:36,403
You're more than welcome to come usher for that night.

637
00:52:37,744 --> 00:52:38,004
Yeah.

638
00:52:39,415 --> 00:52:40,816
I will definitely follow up with you.

639
00:52:40,976 --> 00:52:41,336
Thank you.

640
00:52:41,537 --> 00:52:41,697
Yeah.

641
00:52:41,837 --> 00:52:42,417
All right.

642
00:52:42,937 --> 00:52:52,024
So next meeting is September 11th and we will probably meet in the theater, right?

643
00:52:52,124 --> 00:52:54,826
If everybody's available.

644
00:52:54,866 --> 00:52:55,006
Yes.

645
00:52:59,574 --> 00:53:02,880
Something like that, with a Zoom link, of course, as well, for those who can't make it.

646
00:53:03,541 --> 00:53:03,902
All right.

647
00:53:05,825 --> 00:53:07,107
Well, thanks, everybody.

648
00:53:07,127 --> 00:53:09,972
I'm just a scribe here.

649
00:53:09,992 --> 00:53:13,739
Well, thank you for filling in and stepping up to the plate, Debra.

650
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:14,621
Thanks, Deb.

651
00:53:14,641 --> 00:53:15,061
Good job.

652
00:53:15,682 --> 00:53:16,864
Have a good evening, everyone.

653
00:53:17,606 --> 00:53:18,888
You too.

654
00:53:18,908 --> 00:53:20,391
Thank you, Chris, for attending.

655
00:53:20,411 --> 00:53:21,753
Thanks for having me.

656
00:53:21,813 --> 00:53:22,234
Glad to be here.

657
00:53:22,254 --> 00:53:23,536
Nice to see you.

658
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:23,837
All right.

659
00:53:23,877 --> 00:53:24,177
Take care.

660
00:53:24,197 --> 00:53:24,558
Bye, all.

661
00:53:25,339 --> 00:53:25,540
Bye.
