1
00:00:00,271 --> 00:00:05,234
[SPEAKER_04]: So motion to accept the minutes from the last meeting?

2
00:00:07,075 --> 00:00:07,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

3
00:00:10,016 --> 00:00:10,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

4
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:18,361
[SPEAKER_04]: All in favor of approving, say aye.

5
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:19,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

6
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:23,404
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

7
00:00:23,484 --> 00:00:24,724
[SPEAKER_00]: Natasha says aye.

8
00:00:25,965 --> 00:00:26,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally aye.

9
00:00:28,386 --> 00:00:33,667
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, and then we can start the meeting.

10
00:00:33,787 --> 00:00:34,727
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a moment.

11
00:00:34,807 --> 00:00:36,948
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought Stacy was, oh, there we go.

12
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:39,528
[SPEAKER_00]: She's just connecting to audio.

13
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,011
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, actually, can we go back on that a little bit?

14
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:55,312
[SPEAKER_00]: Natasha, did you join the last meeting later?

15
00:00:58,241 --> 00:01:00,502
[SPEAKER_00]: or did you not, okay.

16
00:01:00,522 --> 00:01:05,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we are wrapping up and we should get joined in less time.

17
00:01:05,485 --> 00:01:13,189
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I had a note in the minutes that said something about some suggestions that you had for activities.

18
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:22,934
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't sure if that was something that you had said in the meeting or if that was just a note that I noted to myself about something that you had said before.

19
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:30,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, all right.

20
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,661
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can remove that comment from the minutes.

21
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:39,703
[SPEAKER_00]: So sorry about that.

22
00:01:39,763 --> 00:01:50,467
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll need to go through the vote again with the understanding that you're approving the minutes with that comment that I said Natasha had removed from them.

23
00:01:57,129 --> 00:01:58,090
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense, everyone?

24
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:05,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so should I go again now?

25
00:02:05,698 --> 00:02:06,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sorry about that.

26
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:14,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so motion to approve the minutes from last meeting.

27
00:02:15,122 --> 00:02:15,463
[SPEAKER_00]: Second.

28
00:02:15,663 --> 00:02:21,926
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, it should be a motion to approve the minutes from last meeting with the comment about Natasha removed.

29
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,067
[SPEAKER_04]: With the comment about Natasha removed.

30
00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:33,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so motion to approve the minutes from last meeting with the comment from Natasha removed.

31
00:02:34,643 --> 00:02:35,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

32
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:39,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, all in favor, say aye.

33
00:02:40,464 --> 00:02:40,604
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

34
00:02:41,884 --> 00:02:42,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

35
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:46,725
[SPEAKER_00]: And Stacy has a thumbs up and Natasha says aye.

36
00:02:46,745 --> 00:02:51,706
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can begin.

37
00:02:53,326 --> 00:02:53,786
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.

38
00:02:58,107 --> 00:03:02,148
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I wanted to talk about during this administrative session, oh, here's Lisette.

39
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:06,011
[SPEAKER_00]: During the administrative portion of the meeting.

40
00:03:07,634 --> 00:03:11,840
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be able to do hybrid meetings on Friday evenings anymore.

41
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:22,885
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the change in the timesheet policy and all of that, I can't stay that many hours after City Hall closes.

42
00:03:24,907 --> 00:03:34,173
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could either do a Zoom meeting on Friday evenings that I could take from home, or we could do a hybrid meeting another day of the week.

43
00:03:38,283 --> 00:03:43,128
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we could do a Zoom meeting some other time during the week.

44
00:03:43,188 --> 00:03:47,573
[SPEAKER_00]: We could do it even at lunchtime if that was a better time for folks than evenings are.

45
00:03:49,275 --> 00:03:50,977
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would everybody prefer?

46
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Brenda, apologies for coming in late.

47
00:03:55,252 --> 00:04:05,120
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking to a coordinator for the Hispanic Heritage Month event for Thursday, the salsa and then, you know, the other stuff for the Bedford Family Network storytelling.

48
00:04:05,721 --> 00:04:13,667
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was on a call with them, but I was wondering if maybe we can just put in what were available, like our availability on a sheet.

49
00:04:14,148 --> 00:04:19,872
[SPEAKER_02]: And then maybe you can see what we can sort of coordinate to do together, because

50
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:46,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I know for me though I think in November I'm going to open up my Wednesday like full day like I'm not working at Target so I can do Wednesday at whatever time so if anybody else is open that for example that day that'd be great.

51
00:04:47,608 --> 00:04:49,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Wednesday is pretty busy for me.

52
00:04:50,304 --> 00:04:55,185
[SPEAKER_04]: But we used to do Monday.

53
00:04:55,686 --> 00:05:01,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Monday was like what we used to do and that worked well for me.

54
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:05,228
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know that Samia can't come in on Monday and that's why I moved it to Friday.

55
00:05:05,668 --> 00:05:12,410
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think probably the best option is to keep it Friday and just do Zoom.

56
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:17,532
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate the changes and they just changed my schedule because the new grant we got.

57
00:05:19,656 --> 00:05:22,579
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm flexible too, so whatever works for everybody.

58
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:30,644
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the only confrontation that I have is the Wednesday with our meetings at the City Hall and the study.

59
00:05:30,845 --> 00:05:36,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Next month, I'll be giving the classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays at the library.

60
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,612
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Monday will be a good day if everybody's okay with that or Friday.

61
00:05:44,254 --> 00:05:45,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm okay with Monday.

62
00:05:46,525 --> 00:05:49,646
[SPEAKER_04]: So Monday at this time, right?

63
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:52,566
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes, at 530.

64
00:05:56,587 --> 00:05:57,988
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

65
00:05:58,288 --> 00:05:59,288
[SPEAKER_00]: Stacey, Natasha?

66
00:05:59,308 --> 00:06:03,669
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if Monday is going to work for me now.

67
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:09,731
[SPEAKER_06]: I was planning to sign up for the market Monday evening.

68
00:06:09,751 --> 00:06:11,671
[SPEAKER_06]: So what time?

69
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:12,051
[SPEAKER_06]: 530, I think.

70
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:24,016
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I was going to go 4 to 6 or something like that.

71
00:06:24,036 --> 00:06:25,416
[SPEAKER_06]: So Friday would work for me.

72
00:06:25,436 --> 00:06:29,459
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to do Fridays too, but I figured I'd take a Friday off.

73
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,460
[SPEAKER_06]: But maybe I can do that for a Monday too.

74
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,921
[SPEAKER_06]: So perhaps I could be flexible.

75
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:39,885
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we could do Mondays at 6 o'clock instead of 5.30.

76
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:48,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever works for the majority, I can try to be flexible.

77
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,483
[SPEAKER_06]: It's once a month, so kind of mix things up.

78
00:06:54,264 --> 00:06:56,165
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm speaking for myself, mixing things up.

79
00:07:00,308 --> 00:07:02,849
[SPEAKER_00]: So Monday or Friday for me is good.

80
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:05,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Natasha says Monday at 6 p.m.

81
00:07:05,971 --> 00:07:07,272
[SPEAKER_00]: or Friday is good for her.

82
00:07:10,018 --> 00:07:13,280
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lizette, Samia, that is okay.

83
00:07:14,722 --> 00:07:25,550
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do Mondays then, because that would definitely be easier for me, because City Hall does close at 1230, so I don't have to take off all that time in between and then go back on again.

84
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:33,496
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that our October meeting would be...

85
00:07:37,444 --> 00:07:39,685
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to do the 21st?

86
00:07:41,026 --> 00:07:56,458
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to be a six, right?

87
00:07:57,058 --> 00:07:57,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

88
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,842
[SPEAKER_02]: The 21st of October, I think is perfect.

89
00:08:06,844 --> 00:08:07,344
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.

90
00:08:09,426 --> 00:08:11,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone else, does that work for you?

91
00:08:11,088 --> 00:08:14,872
[SPEAKER_00]: Natasha gives a thumbs up.

92
00:08:18,135 --> 00:08:18,355
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

93
00:08:18,475 --> 00:08:22,479
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so Monday, October 21st at 6pm is the next one.

94
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:30,144
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we get an e-vite, Brenda?

95
00:08:31,384 --> 00:08:37,447
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an ongoing invitation in your calendar right now for Fridays, so I'll just move that to Mondays instead.

96
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:47,671
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a particular Monday that doesn't work for someone, just let us know and we can be flexible too.

97
00:08:47,691 --> 00:08:47,771
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

98
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,017
[SPEAKER_00]: One more administrative update I wanted to give.

99
00:08:56,178 --> 00:09:01,020
[SPEAKER_00]: We've hired a new head clerk in the Planning, Development, and Sustainability Department.

100
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:09,603
[SPEAKER_00]: Jackie Forcino was one of the interns that we've had for more than a year now, and now she's our new head clerk.

101
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:12,865
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pretty excited to have someone back in that position again.

102
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:15,166
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been tough the last month or so.

103
00:09:15,826 --> 00:09:18,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it head clerk or senior clerk?

104
00:09:19,307 --> 00:09:20,108
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.

105
00:09:21,142 --> 00:09:33,164
[SPEAKER_02]: because we just got a forward email from Catherine that she told us about that position that was open, senior clerk.

106
00:09:34,684 --> 00:09:38,585
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it must be that position then because we don't have another opening in our department.

107
00:09:38,605 --> 00:09:43,806
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.

108
00:09:44,146 --> 00:09:48,027
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've been without a clerk for more than a month now.

109
00:09:49,227 --> 00:09:51,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was going to apply, Barbara.

110
00:09:51,787 --> 00:09:52,788
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Barbara, Brenda.

111
00:09:53,108 --> 00:09:54,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going crazy now.

112
00:09:54,608 --> 00:09:55,828
[SPEAKER_00]: Aw, that's too bad.

113
00:09:55,868 --> 00:09:56,868
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have been wonderful.

114
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:01,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was going to apply, but I was going to do it like on the weekend.

115
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:02,750
[SPEAKER_02]: But good you told me now.

116
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:08,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not trying to work at Target anymore.

117
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:14,692
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, well, I'll keep my eye out if there are openings that I think would be good for you.

118
00:10:14,832 --> 00:10:15,032
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

119
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:16,092
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

120
00:10:25,303 --> 00:10:27,964
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's it for the administrative stuff.

121
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:31,947
[SPEAKER_00]: Do folks have anything else for the administrative portion of the meeting?

122
00:10:34,228 --> 00:10:39,851
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I would like to add that it was success.

123
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:44,934
[SPEAKER_02]: The event that we had, the electric vehicles, success.

124
00:10:46,314 --> 00:10:46,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved it.

125
00:10:48,368 --> 00:10:49,749
[SPEAKER_02]: we should do another event like that.

126
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:56,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely, yeah.

127
00:10:56,554 --> 00:11:13,768
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm terrible at estimating the number of people, but I would say maybe 50 people came through throughout the day, just based on the fact that 35 of the scavenger hunt sheets were taken, and I know there were a lot of people who didn't take those.

128
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,070
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good.

129
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,171
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really good.

130
00:11:19,641 --> 00:11:19,801
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

131
00:11:21,683 --> 00:11:40,517
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, um, yeah, we had 14 electric vehicles there and I think seven e-bikes, um, because people just kept showing up and saying, sorry, I didn't sign up ahead of time, but can I, can I join?

132
00:11:40,538 --> 00:11:42,679
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, sure, go park over there.

133
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:46,102
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's good.

134
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:46,782
[SPEAKER_02]: You see that?

135
00:11:46,802 --> 00:11:48,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was wonderful.

136
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:50,694
[SPEAKER_02]: More people, the better.

137
00:11:50,714 --> 00:11:52,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

138
00:11:52,615 --> 00:11:54,797
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the pictures, the weather was nice too.

139
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:55,577
[SPEAKER_03]: It was nice.

140
00:11:55,657 --> 00:11:56,898
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was perfect.

141
00:11:57,739 --> 00:12:00,901
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was, it was hot though in the parking lot there.

142
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:08,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a, I got a face like burnt in my arms and I was sitting down in the Cybertruck cause it had AC.

143
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,367
[SPEAKER_00]: I have such a farmer's tan from that.

144
00:12:11,508 --> 00:12:16,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I was telling everyone, I was like, come in AC.

145
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:17,291
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you the features.

146
00:12:19,515 --> 00:12:20,255
[SPEAKER_02]: It was too much.

147
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:23,336
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun.

148
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:27,337
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor rode in one of the cargo bikes with her dog.

149
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:28,757
[SPEAKER_00]: That was cute.

150
00:12:29,557 --> 00:12:30,677
[SPEAKER_02]: You got the picture, Brenda?

151
00:12:31,298 --> 00:12:31,778
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

152
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:33,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

153
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:37,199
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys want to see it, whoever didn't get to go?

154
00:12:37,219 --> 00:12:40,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was such a cute picture, guys.

155
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Look.

156
00:12:48,002 --> 00:12:48,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me tell you something.

157
00:12:48,982 --> 00:12:53,225
[SPEAKER_02]: I want an electric bike like yesterday.

158
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:54,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

159
00:12:54,485 --> 00:12:59,147
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I would do the kind of cargo bike that had the thing in front like that, because it was a little bit hard to steer.

160
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:01,969
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not have a trailer in the back or something.

161
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:02,389
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

162
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:06,531
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that one that Michelle, was her name Michelle?

163
00:13:09,241 --> 00:13:14,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Like she had the bike on itself and it was the one that we like, Oh yes, she had a red shirt on.

164
00:13:14,683 --> 00:13:16,343
[SPEAKER_00]: She's one of the electrified med for coaches.

165
00:13:16,643 --> 00:13:16,843
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

166
00:13:17,123 --> 00:13:17,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

167
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:20,825
[SPEAKER_02]: She, that thing was insane.

168
00:13:20,845 --> 00:13:22,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I was having a panic attack.

169
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:27,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I thought it like, if I went like that, I would have gone flying and then fall off the bike.

170
00:13:27,187 --> 00:13:29,087
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, no, let me not do that.

171
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:31,208
[SPEAKER_00]: They do go fast.

172
00:13:31,468 --> 00:13:31,668
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

173
00:13:32,248 --> 00:13:33,149
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was really good.

174
00:13:33,469 --> 00:13:33,910
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked it.

175
00:13:35,371 --> 00:13:40,695
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sent along the EV resources flyer that we used at that event.

176
00:13:41,315 --> 00:13:42,516
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that useful?

177
00:13:42,637 --> 00:13:46,900
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something else that you think would be more useful when you're talking with people?

178
00:13:51,343 --> 00:13:54,386
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean this one that said electric vehicle resources?

179
00:13:54,706 --> 00:13:54,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

180
00:13:57,669 --> 00:13:57,949
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean,

181
00:13:59,457 --> 00:14:01,018
[SPEAKER_02]: And all honestly, this was good.

182
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:07,541
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, I always feel like every single like our tables, like, I mean, we're coming up already with our stuff.

183
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:11,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, Brenda, I'm gonna send you a fly the PDF of this stuff.

184
00:14:11,843 --> 00:14:19,227
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, I feel like maybe, um, I don't know, it needs we need to have something more interactive.

185
00:14:20,748 --> 00:14:23,669
[SPEAKER_02]: That is, like, you know what I mean?

186
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:25,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Of like, electric, like,

187
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,221
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, resources.

188
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:33,685
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but you had looked for, you would ask for like some frequently asked questions or something that you could that you could share with people.

189
00:14:34,366 --> 00:14:34,646
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

190
00:14:35,747 --> 00:14:36,747
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good idea.

191
00:14:37,348 --> 00:14:38,028
[SPEAKER_00]: You should do that.

192
00:14:39,349 --> 00:14:41,611
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what you were thinking of when you said that?

193
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:42,371
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm hmm.

194
00:14:42,931 --> 00:14:43,752
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I meant that.

195
00:14:43,772 --> 00:14:44,192
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was.

196
00:14:44,432 --> 00:14:44,573
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.

197
00:14:45,933 --> 00:14:47,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that possible that you have?

198
00:14:49,536 --> 00:14:50,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, let me go.

199
00:14:52,238 --> 00:14:53,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that possible to have like a

200
00:14:55,712 --> 00:14:59,473
[SPEAKER_03]: like a document without the flyers available.

201
00:14:59,753 --> 00:15:08,355
[SPEAKER_03]: So when do we want, you know, find someone who want to, you know, forward the flyers and can just go to that specific place and now the flyers are there.

202
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:18,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you mean like, just like a link online that you could Yeah, maybe make a Google Docs and, you know, make a folder without the flyers.

203
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,760
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think it'll be very helpful for us, even like if you're in advance,

204
00:15:25,763 --> 00:15:33,645
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, for our events too, you know, like if you, we think about, oh, let me see what do we have available and maybe can print some stuff and bring it to us, you know.

205
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:34,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.

206
00:15:35,026 --> 00:15:38,206
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be great.

207
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:48,689
[SPEAKER_00]: I also, I have some flyers from like ABCD about the weatherization program and fuel assistance and things like that that are really useful for people.

208
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:49,970
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the,

209
00:15:51,773 --> 00:15:57,316
[SPEAKER_00]: community choice, community electricity aggregation flyer that would be useful, I think.

210
00:15:59,737 --> 00:16:03,219
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I'll just add what I have to a folder and share it with you.

211
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,301
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let me know if there are other things that you would like that you'd be looking for.

212
00:16:07,321 --> 00:16:13,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because Lizette, you are taking care of our Facebook page, right, for our office?

213
00:16:15,466 --> 00:16:15,846
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you mean?

214
00:16:17,927 --> 00:16:20,328
[SPEAKER_03]: For our office,

215
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,043
[SPEAKER_03]: prevention outreach office, right?

216
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:30,814
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you saying, like the page, the thing, the questions that I want to do for our office?

217
00:16:31,014 --> 00:16:34,937
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm asking so you have access to our Facebook, right?

218
00:16:34,997 --> 00:16:35,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

219
00:16:35,938 --> 00:16:36,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

220
00:16:36,338 --> 00:16:46,526
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so maybe we can even make an album over there, you know, like and put out the flyers and say the resources, you know, for, you know, something like that.

221
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:49,669
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's available right now, Facebook and maybe even the city page.

222
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:54,212
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have an album just without the flyers available with resources like that.

223
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:57,354
[SPEAKER_03]: where people can go directly and see it.

224
00:16:57,374 --> 00:16:57,994
[SPEAKER_03]: It's there.

225
00:16:58,795 --> 00:17:03,717
[SPEAKER_02]: If you send it to me, Brendan, in email, I can do an album of it and post it.

226
00:17:04,997 --> 00:17:05,217
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

227
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:13,861
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it might be more useful if I have, like Samia said, to have a folder online that you can just go to if you want to print them off for some reason.

228
00:17:13,881 --> 00:17:20,204
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that way, you have it digitally and something that you can use.

229
00:17:20,224 --> 00:17:22,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so and then you can just go and check it out.

230
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:23,225
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

231
00:17:25,292 --> 00:17:28,173
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can pull from there to put into the album.

232
00:17:29,693 --> 00:17:30,093
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good.

233
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:40,535
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next thing I think on the agenda was the Medford Connects events.

234
00:17:42,876 --> 00:17:48,437
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's the Hispanic Heritage Month events coming up.

235
00:17:50,818 --> 00:17:52,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, three.

236
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, three, which I'm planning it is.

237
00:17:59,011 --> 00:17:59,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

238
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:02,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, let me get my stuff.

239
00:18:02,392 --> 00:18:02,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

240
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:06,954
[SPEAKER_02]: So this Thursday, September 26, we're going to have five to seven.

241
00:18:07,054 --> 00:18:08,494
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be from five to seven.

242
00:18:08,974 --> 00:18:09,914
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the chambers.

243
00:18:10,014 --> 00:18:11,315
[SPEAKER_02]: It's salsa dancing.

244
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:17,697
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be very interactive because, um, I just, like I said, spoke with like one of the, um,

245
00:18:19,457 --> 00:18:20,078
[SPEAKER_02]: instructors.

246
00:18:20,118 --> 00:18:22,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Her name's Esther Gomez.

247
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,103
[SPEAKER_02]: She works with Marie Cassidy a lot and she's Mexican.

248
00:18:26,143 --> 00:18:29,905
[SPEAKER_02]: So she does a lot of like interactive like storytelling and stuff like that.

249
00:18:30,005 --> 00:18:38,492
[SPEAKER_02]: So she also does like this like very interactive like salsa dancing with like, like kind of like those like fun like tarps and stuff.

250
00:18:38,532 --> 00:18:43,075
[SPEAKER_02]: You go in and out and play like, you know, dance in and out and stuff.

251
00:18:43,116 --> 00:18:44,336
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's for

252
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:46,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Thursday.

[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, October 11th, we're gonna have a pop up restaurant at the, um, Medford Community Center, which is gonna be really cool.

259
00:19:27,784 --> 00:19:32,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering too, if you want, you can have a table too, Brenda.

260
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:45,280
[SPEAKER_00]: With your resources, unfortunately, I'm not going to be in town that day, but maybe I can get 1 of the coaches to to do a table there.

261
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:50,123
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be good and then.

262
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,565
[SPEAKER_02]: The last 1 is October 18th, Friday.

263

[SPEAKER_02]: And sorry, give me two seconds because she's calling me.

267
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:30,532
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you guys, are there, are the connectors also going to have a table at Tufts Community Day?

268
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,371
[SPEAKER_00]: on September 29th?

269
00:20:32,391 --> 00:20:37,875
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think it was too late for us to remember.

270
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:42,699
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.

271
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:43,079
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

272
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:48,163
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to share a table?

273
00:20:48,283 --> 00:20:50,545
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another instance where I'm not going to be there.

274
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:54,688
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be out of town, but a few of the coaches will be there.

275
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:58,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, maybe.

276
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:28,043
[SPEAKER_04]: let me get in touch if you want to get in touch with Catherine see if it would be okay for us to do that but I would be open because I was I was saying that I was gonna uh when they asked us who wants to table for the for that day I said yes but it turns out we we never had a table to begin with so we said you know what forget it but now you know I can uh I can sit into your table if you like

277
00:21:30,258 --> 00:21:30,538
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

278
00:21:33,581 --> 00:21:36,383
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want me to reach out to Catherine about that?

279
00:21:37,404 --> 00:21:37,744
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

280
00:21:38,345 --> 00:21:42,488
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.

282
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:52,477
[SPEAKER_00]: And FYI, so I'm going to be out of the office for the first two weeks of October.

283
00:21:53,898 --> 00:21:56,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, starting September 28th.

284
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:04,404
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I am going to be frantically trying to finish up a bunch of stuff this, this coming week.

285
00:22:04,504 --> 00:22:11,048
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll, I'll try to get that all worked out, but hopefully it's not going to be too chaotic.

286
00:22:11,268 --> 00:22:14,971
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, getting that information over to you.

287
00:22:15,031 --> 00:22:15,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

288
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:16,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

289
00:22:16,492 --> 00:22:17,032
[SPEAKER_04]: No worries.

290
00:22:24,034 --> 00:22:28,218
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what else.

291
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:34,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there other events coming up other than the Hispanic Heritage Month ones?

292
00:22:39,287 --> 00:22:42,749
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have the winter preparedness in November.

293
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:51,376
[SPEAKER_03]: The flyer itself said we are just waiting for the confirmation of the drop-off location for the nation.

294
00:22:52,446 --> 00:22:54,928
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can release the flyer.

295
00:22:56,028 --> 00:22:56,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

296
00:22:56,629 --> 00:22:57,970
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you share the flyer with me?

297
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:58,850
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see it.

298
00:22:59,591 --> 00:22:59,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

299
00:23:02,012 --> 00:23:08,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, regarding that, I don't know if you saw my email, but I got in touch with a person from ABCD.

300
00:23:08,557 --> 00:23:11,158
[SPEAKER_04]: And they never got back to me.

301
00:23:11,178 --> 00:23:11,699
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

302
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:15,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's because they don't know me.

303
00:23:15,901 --> 00:23:16,221
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

304
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:19,924
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll reach out to someone at ABCD.

305
00:23:22,137 --> 00:23:26,121
[SPEAKER_00]: a different person than you reached out to so that we can try to get the right person.

306
00:23:26,681 --> 00:23:29,864
[SPEAKER_00]: She might not have been the right person to deal with this.

307
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:39,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Brenda.

308
00:23:39,412 --> 00:23:45,558
[SPEAKER_00]: For the winter preparedness event, so that's for winter coat donations, that sort of thing?

309
00:23:47,577 --> 00:23:47,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

310
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:49,999
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

311
00:23:50,599 --> 00:24:03,487
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know that there is a knitting organization in Medford that they knit hats and scarves and things like that to donate to people?

312
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,906
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be a good thing to connect with.

313
00:24:10,926 --> 00:24:12,387
[SPEAKER_00]: True.

314
00:24:13,147 --> 00:24:16,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Mary Cassidy bought some of those things last year.

315
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:17,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, OK.

316
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,891
[SPEAKER_03]: And she got it from some organization like that.

317
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:24,913
[SPEAKER_03]: So I shouldn't assume that she's going to do the same thing this year.

318
00:24:25,494 --> 00:24:31,156
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think for letting me know, I would definitely pass on to Catherine and Sophie and see what I can find about it.

319
00:24:31,717 --> 00:24:31,917
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

320
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,718
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's called the knitting connection.

321
00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:37,540
[SPEAKER_00]: And the person who was running it

322
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:44,388
[SPEAKER_00]: um, is not, you know, her, her health is not, she's not up to managing it right now.

323
00:24:44,448 --> 00:24:47,009
[SPEAKER_00]: So other people are, are sort of helping her.

324
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,911
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it might be a little chaotic right now.

325
00:24:51,092 --> 00:25:00,897
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but if you have a hard time getting in touch with someone, Alicia from my office, um, knits things for that organization.

326
00:25:00,997 --> 00:25:03,558
[SPEAKER_00]: So she could help to get in touch with people.

327
00:25:20,123 --> 00:25:24,806
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is the date for the winter preparedness event?

328
00:25:24,886 --> 00:25:25,266
[SPEAKER_00]: November 14.

329
00:25:25,307 --> 00:25:25,907
[SPEAKER_00]: 14, okay.

330
00:25:26,627 --> 00:25:28,789
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's at City Hall?

331
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:30,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Library.

332
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,951
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.

333
00:25:32,992 --> 00:25:37,555
[SPEAKER_03]: The only problem, I'm glad I went in person to see the dates.

334
00:25:37,695 --> 00:25:40,136
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't have anything available for November anymore.

335
00:25:41,377 --> 00:25:45,520
[SPEAKER_03]: And the 14 was the only date they had available, you know.

336
00:25:46,441 --> 00:25:49,202
[SPEAKER_03]: But they have an event before, so our event is going to start at 6.30.

337
00:25:51,987 --> 00:25:54,568
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so hard to schedule events at the library.

338
00:25:54,588 --> 00:25:56,568
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so booked up.

339
00:25:59,129 --> 00:26:01,590
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but like, it was the end of August.

340
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:05,731
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought like, oh, we have plenty of time, but just check, check it out.

341
00:26:05,771 --> 00:26:07,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe have more options, you know?

342
00:26:07,671 --> 00:26:08,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, come on.

343
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:24,676
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other events that we should be aware of?

344
00:26:24,696 --> 00:26:32,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I don't know if we mentioned already the, is it the River Day Festival?

345
00:26:32,879 --> 00:26:34,900
[SPEAKER_04]: The Sunday, they got moved to Sunday.

346
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,401
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, the Mystic River Celebration.

347
00:26:39,542 --> 00:26:39,722
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

348
00:26:40,162 --> 00:26:42,223
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you, are you guys going to be there too?

349
00:26:42,243 --> 00:26:46,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, now that it's on Sunday, I can make it.

350
00:26:50,886 --> 00:26:51,387
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.

351
00:26:51,447 --> 00:26:52,007
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be there too.

352
00:26:55,782 --> 00:27:01,166
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully there won't be too much wind or any leftover rain.

353
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:02,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well.

354
00:27:09,452 --> 00:27:12,094
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, that's 12 to 4 on Sunday.

355
00:27:20,421 --> 00:27:24,264
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, should we move on to the city updates?

356
00:27:32,596 --> 00:27:38,662
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go back to the Hispanic Heritage Month things if we need to once Lizette's back.

357
00:27:38,682 --> 00:27:42,946
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see.

358
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:59,288
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so on Thursday I did an activity with the McGlynn School and an organization called Canoe Mobile that takes kids on canoe trips on rivers and lakes.

359
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:13,100
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they take half of the kids out on a canoe trip and the other half stay on shore going to different like activity stations and then they switch.

360
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:25,531
[SPEAKER_00]: So my activity station was, I was having them light up little LED lights using pencils, like the graphite and the pencil as a conductor.

361
00:28:26,592 --> 00:28:28,513
[SPEAKER_00]: and connecting it with a nine volt battery.

362
00:28:28,533 --> 00:28:31,814
[SPEAKER_00]: And the kids had a blast doing that.

363
00:28:31,874 --> 00:28:32,834
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was really fun.

364
00:28:32,874 --> 00:28:44,598
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was talking with them about electricity and the wind turbine there and the solar panels we're going to put on the schools and on the Andrews School this fall and other things.

365
00:28:44,658 --> 00:28:45,878
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a great activity.

366
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:50,260
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd like to do it next year.

367
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:55,042
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a very last minute thing.

368
00:28:55,122 --> 00:28:55,782
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard about it.

369
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:03,780
[SPEAKER_00]: less than a week ago, but if they do it again next year, that might be something that would be great for the Medford Connects folks to get involved with too.

370
00:29:10,241 --> 00:29:16,503
[SPEAKER_03]: And I saw your calendar that the city has a Halloween bash or something.

371
00:29:16,523 --> 00:29:17,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you hear anything from that?

372
00:29:18,983 --> 00:29:21,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Halloween bash.

373
00:29:22,564 --> 00:29:23,405
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't.

374
00:29:24,265 --> 00:29:24,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see here.

375
00:29:26,192 --> 00:29:28,813
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not planning on doing anything.

376
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:32,554
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the pumpkin smash.

377
00:29:34,175 --> 00:29:38,316
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see that one, just saw Halloween something.

378
00:29:39,097 --> 00:29:39,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Pumpkin smash?

379
00:29:40,637 --> 00:29:49,240
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Halloween fest and pumpkin float at some time in October, but I don't know if that's something that they're doing again this year.

380
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,521
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard anything about it.

381
00:29:53,728 --> 00:29:55,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just wondering because it's almost October.

382
00:29:55,952 --> 00:29:58,155
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just thought maybe you have a date, you know.

383
00:29:58,816 --> 00:30:00,699
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I haven't heard anything.

384
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:03,483
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't even know who puts that on.

385
00:30:03,524 --> 00:30:05,827
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just something I pulled from last year's calendar.

386
00:30:07,353 --> 00:30:13,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, I think that pumpkin smash might have been something the community center did was make the community center.

387
00:30:13,697 --> 00:30:17,079
[SPEAKER_00]: I think well, the sounds familiar.

388
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,482
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the pumpkin smash is a different event from the Halloween fest.

389
00:30:20,502 --> 00:30:26,986
[SPEAKER_00]: The pumpkin smash happens like a couple days after Halloween and mothers out puts it on at Wrights Pond.

390
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:36,032
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is just to get people to bring their pumpkins in so they can be composted, but they do the smashing of the pumpkins as a way to.

391
00:30:36,962 --> 00:30:38,463
[SPEAKER_00]: do it in a way that's entertaining.

392
00:30:39,203 --> 00:30:39,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Make it fun.

393
00:30:39,844 --> 00:30:40,684
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

394
00:30:41,745 --> 00:30:47,348
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will have a table there for the pumpkin smash and you guys are welcome to as well if you are interested.

395
00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:50,190
[SPEAKER_00]: They had quite a bit of turn out last time.

396
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's see here, I'm going to be at the farmers market on.

397
00:31:06,641 --> 00:31:09,501
[SPEAKER_00]: September 26, so next Thursday.

398
00:31:09,521 --> 00:31:16,323
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and.

399
00:31:17,643 --> 00:31:19,063
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's it.

400
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:23,724
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have electrified methods going to have a table at Tufts community day, although I won't be there.

401
00:31:24,804 --> 00:31:29,145
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the harvest your energy festival, as, you know, is October 19th.

402
00:31:31,752 --> 00:31:36,274
[SPEAKER_00]: Did the Medford Connects folks, do you have a table there signed up for already?

403
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:44,760
[SPEAKER_00]: For which event?

404
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,961
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's October 19th.

405
00:31:48,062 --> 00:31:48,802
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Saturday.

406
00:31:49,423 --> 00:31:50,543
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it called again?

407
00:31:51,084 --> 00:31:52,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest Your Energy Festival.

408
00:31:53,325 --> 00:31:56,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, we should have a table.

409
00:31:57,083 --> 00:32:00,666
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if we registered for table, but we're definitely going to be there.

410
00:32:02,468 --> 00:32:02,708
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

411
00:32:03,028 --> 00:32:04,009
[SPEAKER_00]: I can check.

412
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:08,773
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jackie, the clerk in our office is the one who's heading that up.

413
00:32:08,914 --> 00:32:14,418
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can check with her to make sure that you're on the list of people with tables.

414
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:15,399
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

415
00:32:15,459 --> 00:32:15,940
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

416
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:16,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

417
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,381
[SPEAKER_03]: At the McLean School?

418
00:32:17,901 --> 00:32:18,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

419
00:32:18,902 --> 00:32:19,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

420
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Charbel, Samir, and Stacey signed up for that.

421
00:32:24,057 --> 00:32:25,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a flyer for that yet?

422
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:35,869
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a. Yeah, I can double check on that.

423
00:32:38,572 --> 00:32:40,994
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there's a physical flyer.

424
00:32:41,034 --> 00:32:43,237
[SPEAKER_00]: There was definitely some social media posts.

425
00:32:43,517 --> 00:32:46,280
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were more like digital banners that I've seen.

426
00:32:48,316 --> 00:32:56,380
[SPEAKER_00]: they might be waiting to put out an actual flyer until they've confirmed all of the vendors that are going to be there.

427
00:32:56,781 --> 00:33:08,847
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be like an e-waste recycling company and there's going to be paper shredding and things like, and they're still pinning down some sponsors like Wegmans took a little while to respond to us and things like that.

428
00:33:12,388 --> 00:33:14,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I found the post on Facebook.

429
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,851
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, shall we do stay secure on?

430
00:33:18,027 --> 00:33:18,747
[SPEAKER_03]: as a flyer.

431
00:33:20,428 --> 00:33:23,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Brenda Beck.

432
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:24,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Lizette.

433
00:33:25,451 --> 00:33:26,852
[SPEAKER_02]: So guess what, guys?

434
00:33:26,912 --> 00:33:28,954
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Esther for both events.

435
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:32,936
[SPEAKER_02]: We have what?

436
00:33:34,677 --> 00:33:36,978
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Esther for both events.

437
00:33:37,579 --> 00:33:38,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.

438
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:39,500
[SPEAKER_02]: So continue.

439
00:33:46,893 --> 00:33:47,473
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.

440
00:33:47,553 --> 00:33:55,779
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's both the salsa and the Medford Family Network storytelling.

441
00:33:55,859 --> 00:33:56,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Storytelling.

442
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:56,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.

443
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,620
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

444
00:33:58,641 --> 00:34:08,188
[SPEAKER_02]: The good thing is though, what I like, like, unfortunately, like I was gonna get another lady and she's obviously, she does a lot of Latin dancing, but she's

445
00:34:09,643 --> 00:34:10,543
[SPEAKER_02]: American, right?

446
00:34:10,603 --> 00:34:30,008
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really wanted, you know, someone who was Latino, who, you know, has the culture in her, not saying that they're not, but you know, like, Esther, I got to like, meet her a little bit before and like, she has this very, like, cool way of like, showing the, like, Hispanic culture.

447
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:34,129
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, I have to have her, but I had the other lady as a backup.

448
00:34:34,269 --> 00:34:35,249
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm so happy.

449
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:37,570
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.

450
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:41,146
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

451
00:34:41,266 --> 00:34:43,468
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just talking about the Harvest Your Energy Festival.

452
00:34:43,788 --> 00:34:47,591
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this year they're encouraging people to have interactive activities.

453
00:34:47,631 --> 00:34:49,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Electrify Medford, we're going to have our dollhouse.

454
00:34:50,453 --> 00:34:54,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Mothers Upfront is going to have an induction cooktop demonstration.

455
00:34:55,196 --> 00:34:58,818
[SPEAKER_00]: The Energy Committee is going to have a hand crank that lights up a light bulb.

456
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:04,762
[SPEAKER_00]: I think your trivia wheel would be great for that event if you wanted to do it then.

457
00:35:08,779 --> 00:35:09,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

458
00:35:10,059 --> 00:35:10,300
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

459
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,041
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could help you come up with some trivia questions if you want some help with that.

460
00:35:14,061 --> 00:35:16,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that would be great.

461
00:35:16,902 --> 00:35:17,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

462
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:20,603
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm definitely going to do climate-related questions.

463
00:35:21,123 --> 00:35:21,303
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

464
00:35:24,184 --> 00:35:29,806
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to do better than my scavenger hunt, though, because I made my Eevee showcase scavenger hunt questions way too difficult.

465
00:35:30,146 --> 00:35:33,067
[SPEAKER_00]: And only four people actually submitted to the raffle.

466
00:35:33,087 --> 00:35:34,567
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

467
00:35:34,607 --> 00:35:36,948
[SPEAKER_02]: My husband was like, we got to ask every single thing.

468
00:35:38,247 --> 00:35:39,528
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like, yeah.

469
00:35:40,288 --> 00:35:46,971
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have to answer every question, just half of them, but you did have to talk to almost all the drivers to be able to answer them.

470
00:35:47,492 --> 00:35:51,774
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's the thing, you interact with the people.

471
00:35:51,794 --> 00:36:04,240
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I like... Yeah, the questions I had prepared during the national night out, apparently they were too hard, but I thought, I didn't think that they were that difficult.

472
00:36:04,893 --> 00:36:08,154
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was giving the kids pretty softball questions.

473
00:36:09,555 --> 00:36:13,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what do you do on a hot day or something?

474
00:36:15,877 --> 00:36:19,759
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to send me the questions that you have so I can give feedback on them?

475
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:23,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I will share the document with you after the meeting.

476
00:36:23,821 --> 00:36:24,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that sounds great.

477
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:26,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, let me do it right now.

478
00:36:26,782 --> 00:36:27,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

479
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:37,661
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the other things that are going on at the Harvester Energy Festival, we are going to have another EV showcase there.

480
00:36:39,422 --> 00:36:41,942
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be all Medford people.

481
00:36:42,402 --> 00:36:47,163
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Energy Consumers Alliance is looking for volunteers from their membership.

482
00:36:48,223 --> 00:36:53,044
[SPEAKER_00]: But we should have probably 10 cars at the festival.

483
00:36:53,164 --> 00:36:54,025
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will be cool.

484
00:36:55,025 --> 00:37:00,346
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be doing a tour of the wind turbine again, where we open it up so people can see inside it.

485
00:37:03,028 --> 00:37:09,474
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we won't be doing a raffle this year because that didn't seem to work so well last year.

486
00:37:10,775 --> 00:37:14,078
[SPEAKER_00]: People were not necessarily going table to table to, to do it.

487
00:37:14,138 --> 00:37:18,161
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just kind of hanging around the raffle booth waiting for their raffle.

488
00:37:20,803 --> 00:37:25,888
[SPEAKER_02]: You should do like a, um, like a raffle.

489
00:37:26,805 --> 00:37:36,972
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, you know how you put like it in and you grab like the person, like they sign up to be on like the, I don't know, like a, like the newsletter or something like that.

490
00:37:37,532 --> 00:37:38,152
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?

491
00:37:38,473 --> 00:37:44,436
[SPEAKER_02]: That way, like they're enticed to like get the information slash get the giveaway.

492
00:37:46,318 --> 00:37:46,598
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

493
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:51,521
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're too late at this point to do it for this year, but that's a good idea for next year.

494
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:51,621
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

495
00:37:57,892 --> 00:38:04,716
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think that's it for events that I'm doing in the near future.

496
00:38:05,337 --> 00:38:13,962
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a run run Medford event, September 27th and 28th, but we're not, I'm not going to be there or electrify Medford's not going to be there.

497
00:38:14,723 --> 00:38:17,124
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's Oktoberfest on October 5th.

498
00:38:18,025 --> 00:38:26,630
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not going to be there either, mostly because I'm gone and it's hard to get to organize it with other people when I'm not around.

499
00:38:33,537 --> 00:38:36,558
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, moving on to curbside composting.

500
00:38:37,598 --> 00:38:59,181
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I wanted to talk with you about, we might be doing a pilot where Garbage to Garden drops off bins at people's houses with a note saying, you can start using this or if you leave it untouched, then we'll just pick it up again as a way of making it easier for people so they don't have to sign up and then get the bin delivered.

501
00:38:59,221 --> 00:39:02,142
[SPEAKER_00]: They just get a bin delivered and then they can sign up if they want to.

502
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:11,274
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something you think that would work, or do you think that would irritate people to get a random bin delivered to their house?

503
00:39:12,135 --> 00:39:18,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're going to get a lot of complaint calls, especially the elderly people saying, I didn't ask for that.

504
00:39:18,718 --> 00:39:19,879
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not paying for that.

505
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,140
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't walk.

506
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,223
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's free, but yeah, we'll probably still get those.

507
00:39:26,783 --> 00:39:37,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe, maybe could be like we have available, you know, at this neighborhood, you know, this day if you wanna, you know.

508
00:39:38,311 --> 00:39:40,292
[SPEAKER_03]: let us know we drop off or something.

509
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:45,815
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think I would be very mad if I found something from my house.

510
00:39:46,716 --> 00:39:48,597
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know what to do with that.

511
00:39:48,837 --> 00:39:50,578
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, what's going on?

512
00:39:50,658 --> 00:39:55,200
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll, it's not that I'll be mad, but like, oh, like, what's going on?

513
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,782
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I need to try to figure out what this is.

514
00:39:57,822 --> 00:40:00,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me call and see what I need to do.

515
00:40:00,443 --> 00:40:02,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Because no matter what people don't read.

516
00:40:02,204 --> 00:40:05,106
[SPEAKER_03]: I was gonna say, even if there's a note there.

517
00:40:05,126 --> 00:40:05,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

518
00:40:06,286 --> 00:40:13,072
[SPEAKER_03]: people don't read, you know, like, and I think if the city hall gonna be going crazy with all the calls and stuff.

519
00:40:15,795 --> 00:40:20,759
[SPEAKER_03]: And they always have those people that is very negative and they hate, you know, towards the city hall.

520
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:26,924
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, can we set up an opportunity like that, you know, to get people in.

521
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,487
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it would work if we

522
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:35,423
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, did like one of the robocall things to give people a heads up ahead of time.

523
00:40:35,643 --> 00:40:39,206
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did the drop off of the bins.

524
00:40:43,309 --> 00:40:48,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say 50-50 in all honesty, because a lot of people don't like the robocall.

525
00:40:50,494 --> 00:40:51,675
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's yeah.

526
00:40:53,476 --> 00:40:54,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Half and half.

527
00:40:54,617 --> 00:40:54,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

528
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:22,244
[SPEAKER_03]: What about like it's just like we're gonna start going to the market, you know, it's mystic markets that the name is that Yeah, the food the food yeah, yeah, you know like places like that and you know have at least couple video available and say hey don't sign up this is how it is and show people how it is and we can drop off at your house and this how work and

529
00:41:23,025 --> 00:41:29,492
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and getting people like little by little where they are coming for service, because maybe they don't even know how things work.

530
00:41:31,434 --> 00:41:32,355
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.

531
00:41:32,415 --> 00:41:38,222
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know the Garbage to Garden has been tabling at different things like the farmers market and things like that.

532
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,025
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they've been at the Mystic Market before.

533
00:41:43,926 --> 00:41:50,075
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a better day or time that more people might be coming there?

534
00:41:50,095 --> 00:41:50,896
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea.

535
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:53,600
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to start going over there the second week.

536
00:41:54,241 --> 00:41:55,541
[SPEAKER_03]: of October.

537
00:41:55,561 --> 00:41:59,303
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe you can give a feedback about that.

538
00:41:59,323 --> 00:42:04,724
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, hey this day is super busy and I just think you're gonna target different people over there.

539
00:42:05,944 --> 00:42:12,226
[SPEAKER_03]: What I see at the farmers market when they go there is there's always the same people that come over there.

540
00:42:13,007 --> 00:42:17,768
[SPEAKER_03]: So people probably already saw or have seen don't even stop at the table anymore you know just

541
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:24,392
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's why they were trying to look at different ways of reaching people.

542
00:42:24,412 --> 00:42:26,793
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they were thinking about the drop-off thing.

543
00:42:26,853 --> 00:42:28,935
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mystic Market is a great idea.

544
00:42:28,955 --> 00:42:39,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a way to send it as a text message?

545
00:42:40,522 --> 00:42:42,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that's what the robocalls are.

546
00:42:42,202 --> 00:42:45,064
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sign up either as a phone call or a text message.

547
00:42:46,045 --> 00:42:46,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

548
00:42:48,752 --> 00:42:53,497
[SPEAKER_03]: We just started working with the PTOs from schools too.

549
00:42:53,698 --> 00:43:04,510
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, they have events at schools, you know, maybe it would be a good idea too to present that to the parents or, I don't know.

550
00:43:07,748 --> 00:43:14,856
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you need to find a way to bring the stuff to people so they can see it because people really don't come to us and try to get information as much.

551
00:43:15,456 --> 00:43:15,697
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

552
00:43:16,237 --> 00:43:23,485
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other suggestions for locations or events like that that you think would be useful for Garbage to Garden to be at?

553
00:43:24,326 --> 00:43:25,147
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear more.

554
00:43:37,272 --> 00:43:38,993
[SPEAKER_00]: We've signed the contract with the designer.

555
00:43:39,613 --> 00:43:50,216
[SPEAKER_00]: They're working on the existing conditions assessment, and they're doing some more immediate designs for the Brooks water heater, because they don't have any hot water right now at the Brooks school.

556
00:43:50,237 --> 00:43:51,597
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're working on that as well.

557
00:43:52,698 --> 00:43:58,162
[SPEAKER_00]: and many split heat pump replacements for the IT closets in most of the schools.

558
00:43:58,242 --> 00:44:00,964
[SPEAKER_00]: I think about half of them have failed at this point.

559
00:44:01,544 --> 00:44:13,232
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of the equipment is overheating because of that, like the computer, like network equipment is overheating and that's really bad for it.

560
00:44:13,312 --> 00:44:17,255
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to get those replaced quickly or we'll be losing equipment.

561
00:44:22,462 --> 00:44:23,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what else.

562
00:44:23,663 --> 00:44:32,348
[SPEAKER_00]: The EV charging revolving fund that we talked about last time, the city council passed it for its first reading.

563
00:44:33,949 --> 00:44:36,451
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second, so it's three readings.

564
00:44:37,251 --> 00:44:42,695
[SPEAKER_00]: The first reading of the city council, the second reading is when it gets posted in the newspaper.

565
00:44:42,715 --> 00:44:48,238
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third reading, it goes back to city council again and they do the final vote on it.

566
00:44:57,324 --> 00:44:58,365
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what else.

567
00:44:58,525 --> 00:45:00,506
[SPEAKER_00]: The Great American Beer Hall.

568
00:45:00,526 --> 00:45:04,309
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys have heard about that, that opened recently.

569
00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:13,757
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really excited because they applied for interconnection for a solar panel installation on the roof of that.

570
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:15,418
[SPEAKER_00]: 247 kilowatts.

571
00:45:18,831 --> 00:45:24,855
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not, it hasn't been installed yet on it, but they applied to National Grid to be able to install that on there.

572
00:45:27,217 --> 00:45:33,281
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, at first they had said, no, they didn't think the building would be able to hold the weight of it.

573
00:45:33,441 --> 00:45:38,645
[SPEAKER_00]: And we said, well, at least do a study to see if that's true and how much it would cost.

574
00:45:39,165 --> 00:45:43,588
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did the study and they found out, oh, actually it can, and it's going to save you a lot of money.

575
00:45:43,728 --> 00:45:46,130
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're moving forward with it, which is great.

576
00:45:47,635 --> 00:45:48,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is it located?

577
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:52,638
[SPEAKER_00]: On Mystic?

578
00:45:52,718 --> 00:45:53,959
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see here.

579
00:45:59,661 --> 00:46:02,243
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me drop it into the chat.

580
00:46:10,347 --> 00:46:12,028
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite a large space.

581
00:46:17,581 --> 00:46:22,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the pictures of the ones that mayor put on the Facebook page.

582
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:26,611
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks gorgeous.

583
00:46:29,434 --> 00:46:26,611
142.

584
00:46:31,617 --> 00:46:32,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yep.

585
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:34,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

586
00:46:38,384 --> 00:46:39,165
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I know where it is.

587
00:46:43,001 --> 00:46:59,314
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the energy committee met earlier this month and a couple of things from that a resident came and got added to the agenda to speak to them about how she'd like to start a zero waste Medford volunteer group.

588
00:47:01,135 --> 00:47:06,940
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if that's something that you or anyone else, you know, might be interested, I can, I can put you in touch with her.

589
00:47:12,187 --> 00:47:20,892
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting because I think groups like that can sometimes be more flexible than official city boards.

590
00:47:22,372 --> 00:47:26,854
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, like Trees Medford is an official city organization.

591
00:47:26,894 --> 00:47:28,955
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a resident volunteer group.

592
00:47:32,857 --> 00:47:39,481
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the next Energy Committee meeting on October 7th, they're going to have a presentation about PFAS.

593
00:47:40,738 --> 00:47:48,925
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a chemical in some plastics that has some really negative impacts on people's health.

594
00:47:51,227 --> 00:47:56,752
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a public meeting, you're welcome to listen in on that if you're interested, it's a Zoom meeting.

595
00:48:02,313 --> 00:48:11,808
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what else, Electrify Medford, we've had 65 residents sign up so far, 19 of them have had a coaching session.

596
00:48:13,487 --> 00:48:19,088
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been sort of split between people who are really focused on saving money and people who want to reduce their carbon footprint.

597
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:29,030
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the first group, we really talked to them more about reducing their energy rates and getting a mass safe home energy assessment, usually with ABCD because they're income eligible.

598
00:48:30,851 --> 00:48:37,512
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the second group, we talked with them more about heat pumps, solar panels, electric vehicles, those sorts of things.

599
00:48:40,137 --> 00:48:46,244
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the coaches have taken on their first coaching session and some have moved on to their second.

600
00:48:46,284 --> 00:48:52,191
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited of getting them ramped up so that we can get more of these coaching sessions done.

601
00:48:57,717 --> 00:48:59,799
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I did five myself last week.

602
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:06,355
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a couple more updates here.

603
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:10,939
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're submitting our annual greenhouse gas report this week.

604
00:49:12,961 --> 00:49:23,910
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have a good summary of it for you right now, because I'm still working on it, but I can summarize it for you at our next meeting.

605
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:29,475
[SPEAKER_00]: And sort of do a good comparison between previous years and this year.

606
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:40,770
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll also be doing our green communities annual report so that's a state level report that we do that makes us eligible for grant funding.

607
00:49:45,322 --> 00:49:53,809
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also going to be finishing up a building inventory for our green communities decarbonization roadmap.

608
00:49:54,589 --> 00:50:02,575
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one step to becoming what they call a green communities climate leader, and that makes us eligible for even more funding from green communities.

609
00:50:02,755 --> 00:50:04,977
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just got...

610
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:14,485
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing an assessment of every single system in our buildings for this decarbonization roadmap.

611
00:50:14,905 --> 00:50:18,367
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's taking forever to collect all of that information from them.

612
00:50:20,688 --> 00:50:21,368
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's good.

613
00:50:22,449 --> 00:50:25,530
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, that'll be really useful moving forward, definitely.

614
00:50:26,491 --> 00:50:27,872
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that way we can plan it out.

615
00:50:27,932 --> 00:50:29,853
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of being surprised by something,

616
00:50:31,317 --> 00:50:45,366
[SPEAKER_00]: failing like the Brooks water heater, we can say, oh, okay, that water heater we know is 10 is, you know, more than 10 years old, we should make a plan for what we're going to do and put some and plan some capital dollars to fund replacing it.

617
00:50:50,788 --> 00:51:01,017
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're also working on what's called a SEMP, a strategic energy management plan with National Grid, which is similar to the building inventory.

618
00:51:01,037 --> 00:51:10,045
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, what are the projects that we're going to be doing in our buildings over the next three years that will save energy and that National Grid can give us rebates for?

619
00:51:10,545 --> 00:51:17,511
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we do this bigger plan with them, instead of doing them as just one-off projects, then we can get extra incentives from National Grid.

620
00:51:18,252 --> 00:51:21,634
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything that can give us more money for these projects is good.

621
00:51:27,539 --> 00:51:27,839
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

622
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:33,943
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's it for my updates.

623
00:51:34,003 --> 00:51:37,826
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you guys have questions on any of those or comments?

624
00:51:39,419 --> 00:51:40,500
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a question.

625
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:49,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I was talking to someone recently and talking about money that comes to the city and everything with that kind of project.

626
00:51:50,423 --> 00:51:58,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything that is dedicated to give a job opportunity for people to work on those projects?

627
00:52:01,127 --> 00:52:01,588
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.

628
00:52:01,648 --> 00:52:07,550
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mean for the projects that the city is doing, having a requirement that there's certain amount of local

629
00:52:08,661 --> 00:52:19,218
[SPEAKER_03]: residents that can do a stipend or any kind of a part-time job or full-time job during that project, you know, that you get the grant for.

630
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:36,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's not right now, but I think a large project like the high school replacement, I think that's the sort of project where you can write in those sorts of like local worker requirements into it.

631
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:45,895
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's definitely something that we should keep top of mind and remember to try to include in the high school project.

632
00:52:47,337 --> 00:52:53,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because it's kind of like helping both sides, you know, we have a lot of people looking for jobs and opportunities.

633
00:52:53,658 --> 00:52:59,000
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe they are not even they don't even know what what is about and they can learn new things too.

634
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:03,541
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe it's an area that they want to continue working on with that.

635
00:53:03,981 --> 00:53:09,902
[SPEAKER_03]: But also for the companies that provide services in New York City, you know, that can be hired for that, you know.

636
00:53:10,802 --> 00:53:11,222
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

637
00:53:13,703 --> 00:53:14,463
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also

638
00:53:18,186 --> 00:53:24,771
[SPEAKER_00]: There are training programs that exist right now that people can get into.

639
00:53:25,211 --> 00:53:36,519
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the training programs have connections to different companies so that people are more likely to get a job with one of these companies that have partnered with the training program.

640
00:53:39,298 --> 00:53:40,999
[SPEAKER_00]: I know of a few of them.

641
00:53:41,019 --> 00:53:50,501
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be useful if I have a list of them that we can have posted online and we can talk to people about.

642
00:53:50,541 --> 00:53:57,724
[SPEAKER_00]: So if people are interested in getting involved with them, then... Yeah, but it would be nice if we have a program.

643
00:53:59,129 --> 00:54:17,468
[SPEAKER_03]: just an example, you know, when they're building the casino, you know, near my house, you know, they're talking about all the opportunity jobs that will bring so have all those training, because people already knew the jobs were coming, you know, so we can offer people training and everything, but like you

644
00:54:18,575 --> 00:54:19,296
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we going to say?

645
00:54:19,396 --> 00:54:20,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, because they're coming.

646
00:54:20,877 --> 00:54:22,039
[SPEAKER_03]: New positions are coming.

647
00:54:22,139 --> 00:54:31,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Mad for it for those positions, you know, or, you know, like, so be good to kind of have that balance, that answer.

648
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:33,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, like we have.

649
00:54:34,381 --> 00:54:44,667
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think partnering with these training programs is a great way to do it though, because then you can point to, you're not just saying to a company, oh, you have to hire this many local people.

650
00:54:44,707 --> 00:54:54,792
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say, you have to hire this many local people and here's a training program that you can pull people from so that you're not just saying, figure out how to do it.

651
00:54:54,832 --> 00:54:58,634
[SPEAKER_00]: You're actually making it easier for the companies to hire them too.

652
00:54:58,654 --> 00:55:00,535
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

653
00:55:07,466 --> 00:55:08,807
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else?

654
00:55:15,432 --> 00:55:24,200
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I think the next thing on the agenda is the second part of that Electrify Medford abbreviated training.

655
00:55:26,062 --> 00:55:32,027
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can share my screen so we can get started with that.

656
00:55:37,585 --> 00:55:38,466
[SPEAKER_00]: Can everybody see that?

657
00:55:41,508 --> 00:55:41,788
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.

658
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:50,994
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just move my Zoom screen around so I can actually see it too.

659
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:12,300
[SPEAKER_00]: So last time we talked about energy efficiency in your home and air source heat pumps, and this time we'll talk about heat pump water heaters, solar water heaters, induction cooktops, solar panels, and electric vehicles.

660
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:13,682
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a lot to talk about.

661
00:56:19,358 --> 00:56:20,780
[SPEAKER_00]: So heat pump water heaters.

662
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:26,585
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are basically like regular storage tank water heaters, but with a heat pump on top of it.

663
00:56:27,906 --> 00:56:37,755
[SPEAKER_00]: And because as we learned last time, heat pumps can be three times more efficient than other equipment or more actually, these can save a lot of energy.

664
00:56:38,556 --> 00:56:42,619
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a comparison between an electric resistance water heater on the left

665
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:45,060
[SPEAKER_00]: and a heat pump water heater on the right.

666
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,661
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that difference there.

667
00:56:47,721 --> 00:56:54,582
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dollar values here, because this is a nationwide, the energy guide is a nationwide thing.

668
00:56:55,242 --> 00:56:59,043
[SPEAKER_00]: This is based on the national average, which is $0.12 per kilowatt hour.

669
00:56:59,363 --> 00:57:02,164
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're paying $0.31 per kilowatt hour.

670
00:57:02,224 --> 00:57:05,965
[SPEAKER_00]: So our savings would be almost three times the savings that you see here.

671
00:57:09,257 --> 00:57:14,461
[SPEAKER_00]: And domestic hot water heater, hot water is about a quarter of a home's energy use.

672
00:57:14,942 --> 00:57:16,903
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in the Northeast, at least.

673
00:57:17,304 --> 00:57:18,324
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really adds up.

674
00:57:19,245 --> 00:57:33,076
[SPEAKER_00]: And another interesting way of looking at it is with the electricity that you save switching from a standard electric water heater to a heat pump water heater in one year, you could drive my electric car all around the country.

675
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:40,956
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not as big of a change as switching over your heating system.

676
00:57:41,016 --> 00:57:44,761
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't save as much as that, but it's still a big deal.

677
00:57:50,615 --> 00:58:02,049
[SPEAKER_00]: So heat pump water heaters are taller than regular storage tanks because they have the heat pump on top and they're pulling heat from the air around them so they need some room around them, they can't be in a closet.

678
00:58:03,251 --> 00:58:06,575
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can cool off that room up to five degrees.

679
00:58:09,805 --> 00:58:16,767
[SPEAKER_00]: And because water condenses out of the air during this process, they dehumidify the space around them too.

680
00:58:16,847 --> 00:58:18,487
[SPEAKER_00]: So they make a lot of sense for basements.

681
00:58:19,827 --> 00:58:25,168
[SPEAKER_00]: In places where people have their water heaters in a closet or something, they don't make as much sense.

682
00:58:27,349 --> 00:58:36,931
[SPEAKER_00]: They also need a drain for the condensed water and they need to plug into a 240 volt outlet, like an electric dryer or stove outlet.

683
00:58:38,853 --> 00:58:46,267
[SPEAKER_00]: There are heat pump water heaters that plug into a regular 120 volt outlet, but they don't work very well in cold areas like ours yet.

684
00:58:46,408 --> 00:58:48,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that's something that will come in the future.

685
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:59,675
[SPEAKER_00]: So solar hot water or solar thermal, you might hear it called that.

686
00:59:00,555 --> 00:59:06,818
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as common as solar photovoltaics or PV, but it's actually more efficient than that.

687
00:59:07,018 --> 00:59:11,660
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 80% efficient compared to 15% efficient for solar PV.

688
00:59:12,781 --> 00:59:21,545
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way it works is it has piping that collects the heat from the sun that's behind that like dark panel that you see there.

689
00:59:23,054 --> 00:59:26,656
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that piping runs through a storage water tank to transfer the heat.

690
00:59:27,376 --> 00:59:31,958
[SPEAKER_00]: And then inside the piping is a type of antifreeze, propylene glycol.

691
00:59:32,518 --> 00:59:34,419
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a non-toxic type of antifreeze.

692
00:59:34,439 --> 00:59:36,160
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not the kind that you have in your car.

693
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,141
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also an electric resistance coil.

694
00:59:40,641 --> 00:59:43,182
[SPEAKER_00]: Natasha, it looks like it's jumping back in.

695
00:59:43,202 --> 00:59:44,543
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

696
00:59:44,923 --> 00:59:49,425
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also an electric resistance coil inside the water heater

697
00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:52,140
[SPEAKER_00]: up even higher.

698
00:59:53,821 --> 01:00:01,606
[SPEAKER_00]: So this whole system, it saves about 70% of the energy that you would use heating your water, and it lasts a long time.

699
01:00:01,866 --> 01:00:06,489
[SPEAKER_00]: If the storage tank dies, you can just replace that part of the system instead of the whole thing.

700
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:10,912
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an upfront investment, but it's a really good one.

701
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:21,607
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may have heard my spiel about induction cooktops before.

702
01:00:22,588 --> 01:00:33,436
[SPEAKER_00]: Cooking is probably one of the most sensitive topics for electrification because so many people love their gas stoves, to the point where we have that phrase, now we're cooking with gas, right?

703
01:00:34,016 --> 01:00:35,117
[SPEAKER_00]: To mean that something's good.

704
01:00:38,158 --> 01:00:45,500
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we have that phrase, the gas companies actually knew as early as the 1960s that it was bad for people with asthma.

705
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:52,921
[SPEAKER_00]: And they hired the same PR firm that the tobacco industry used to convince people that it was good for them.

706
01:00:55,602 --> 01:00:58,883
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't really help that electric stoves weren't great in the past.

707
01:00:59,463 --> 01:01:02,543
[SPEAKER_00]: They had uneven heat and they cost a lot of money to operate.

708
01:01:03,504 --> 01:01:05,084
[SPEAKER_00]: But now with induction stoves,

709
01:01:06,886 --> 01:01:09,671
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not just better for indoor air quality, but they're more efficient.

710
01:01:10,352 --> 01:01:14,839
[SPEAKER_00]: People like how well they work, partially because you have more control over the temperature.

711
01:01:16,597 --> 01:01:17,879
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're also easy to clean.

712
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:29,528
[SPEAKER_00]: But you do need metal cookware that a magnet could stick to, because the way that they work is there are coils inside that create an electromagnetic field and that agitates the molecules in your pot.

713
01:01:30,109 --> 01:01:32,971
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just heats up the pot and not the air around it.

714
01:01:33,592 --> 01:01:38,476
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not going to burn yourself or anything else by touching the stove while it's on.

715
01:01:38,556 --> 01:01:39,957
[SPEAKER_00]: You can even cook through a towel.

716
01:01:42,635 --> 01:01:47,258
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love that you can get a portable one to test out before replacing your whole stove.

717
01:01:47,398 --> 01:01:51,380
[SPEAKER_00]: And the library has two portable induction cooktops that people can borrow.

718
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,742
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and a fun fact.

719
01:01:55,163 --> 01:01:59,605
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor actually told me recently that she just bought a portable one to try out.

720
01:02:00,906 --> 01:02:04,408
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was excited about it because she was like, oh, my kids can use this.

721
01:02:09,051 --> 01:02:09,731
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so cool.

722
01:02:10,252 --> 01:02:10,452
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

723
01:02:12,542 --> 01:02:20,307
[SPEAKER_00]: So, after reducing your energy use as much as possible and switching away from fossil fuels, the next step is to get your electricity from renewable sources.

724
01:02:21,007 --> 01:02:23,048
[SPEAKER_00]: And for most people, that's going to be solar.

725
01:02:24,929 --> 01:02:34,375
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people connect their solar panels to the electric grid so that when they're generating a lot of electricity, they can, but not using a lot, they can

726
01:02:35,135 --> 01:02:36,355
[SPEAKER_00]: feed it back into the grid.

727
01:02:36,996 --> 01:02:41,297
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they're using a lot of electricity but not generating a lot, they can get it from the grid.

728
01:02:41,757 --> 01:02:42,997
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's called net metering.

729
01:02:43,377 --> 01:02:46,778
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see it on your bill as a credit that reduces what you have to pay.

730
01:02:49,539 --> 01:02:56,761
[SPEAKER_00]: So say you use a lot of electricity in the winter because you have heat pumps and you have a heat pump water heater.

731
01:02:57,461 --> 01:03:03,003
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use the net metering credits that you saved up all summer when you're not using as much electricity to pay for it.

732
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:07,571
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of what it might look like.

733
01:03:11,993 --> 01:03:17,555
[SPEAKER_00]: So owning your own solar panels on your own property will give you the most cost savings.

734
01:03:18,215 --> 01:03:27,819
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are options if you can't do that, like leasing power purchase agreements, community shared solar, or Medford's community electricity aggregation, 100% green option.

735
01:03:31,994 --> 01:03:43,140
[SPEAKER_00]: If you install it on your roof, you should make sure that your roof is new enough that you won't have to remove the solar panels at some point over the next 20 years to repair your roof.

736
01:03:46,367 --> 01:03:55,496
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally, if you lease, the way it works is you'll pay a set fee for the panels each month, and then you get the electricity from them.

737
01:03:56,216 --> 01:04:04,665
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a power purchase agreement, the way it usually works is you agree to pay the installer a set cost per kilowatt hour for the electricity that you get from it.

738
01:04:05,126 --> 01:04:07,128
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little bit different between those two things.

739
01:04:09,253 --> 01:04:17,677
[SPEAKER_00]: And those last two options can be tricky because you are making a decades-long agreement to pay this company.

740
01:04:18,317 --> 01:04:24,399
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you sell your house, you either need to pay them off or you need to get the next owner to take over your contract.

741
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:31,562
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's important that people understand it before they sign any agreements for that.

742
01:04:33,616 --> 01:04:36,899
[SPEAKER_00]: For community shared solar, you're not installing anything on your own roof.

743
01:04:36,999 --> 01:04:42,664
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just buying into a solar farm somewhere else, either through a lease or a PPA type arrangement.

744
01:04:44,025 --> 01:04:50,491
[SPEAKER_00]: And like any competitive supplier, people need to really be careful about reading the small print.

745
01:04:52,031 --> 01:04:54,772
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you know exactly what price are you going to be paying?

746
01:04:55,352 --> 01:04:58,933
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there an introductory cost that increases after six months?

747
01:04:59,794 --> 01:05:03,755
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a fee to break your contract before the end of your contract?

748
01:05:05,475 --> 01:05:17,219
[SPEAKER_00]: So same thing that we always tell people when we're talking about Medford's Community Electricity Aggregation and other competitive suppliers out there, we're like, just make sure you understand exactly what you're going to be paying for.

749
01:05:19,697 --> 01:05:22,499
[SPEAKER_00]: This image here is actually from the roof of the library.

750
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:29,662
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the little waves that are up there, and each one of them has these solar panels on it.

751
01:05:31,202 --> 01:05:39,806
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have solar panels on the police station and the Department of Public Works, and we're looking to add some to the Andrews School this fall.

752
01:05:42,928 --> 01:05:43,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

753
01:05:45,659 --> 01:05:48,321
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to take over all Medford, Brenda, with that.

754
01:05:48,821 --> 01:05:52,964
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I hope we get solar panels on all of the city buildings, definitely.

755
01:05:52,984 --> 01:05:55,085
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.

756
01:05:57,727 --> 01:05:58,868
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see.

757
01:05:59,748 --> 01:06:04,292
[SPEAKER_00]: Battery storage, this is especially interesting for people if they have solar.

758
01:06:05,632 --> 01:06:12,237
[SPEAKER_00]: But an important thing to keep in mind is it's probably not going to power your entire home in the event of a power outage.

759
01:06:13,506 --> 01:06:23,538
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you strung enough batteries together to do that, it would cost a lot of money and so probably wouldn't make economic sense in our area where we don't lose power that often.

760
01:06:24,922 --> 01:06:31,508
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you wanted to have a battery for backup, you could choose what you put on that battery, right?

761
01:06:31,568 --> 01:06:40,475
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you want it to be your refrigerator and some outlets so you don't lose your food and you can keep medical equipment running during an outage?

762
01:06:41,616 --> 01:06:47,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want it to be powering your heat pump so that you have heat during the winter?

763
01:06:49,987 --> 01:06:55,009
[SPEAKER_00]: For some of my family in Maine, for instance, they lose power more often in the winter than we do here.

764
01:06:55,969 --> 01:06:58,490
[SPEAKER_00]: So they really feel like they need some sort of backup.

765
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:07,933
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of choosing a battery or multiple batteries, they chose to get a backup propane generator that could power their house.

766
01:07:09,677 --> 01:07:16,161
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, it's not used often enough that it's really terrible for the environment.

767
01:07:16,301 --> 01:07:21,224
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, my sister, her house is heated by heat pumps.

768
01:07:21,264 --> 01:07:25,067
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's mostly using, you know, more renewable sources.

769
01:07:27,028 --> 01:07:30,570
[SPEAKER_00]: But then occasionally when the power goes out, she uses the propane generator.

770
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:32,031
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems like a fair trade off.

771
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:39,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, moving on to transportation.

772
01:07:39,662 --> 01:07:44,365
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously walking or biking is best for the environment.

773
01:07:44,465 --> 01:07:46,707
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, riding the subway or the bus.

774
01:07:46,767 --> 01:07:53,052
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do drive a car, electric vehicles and hybrids are a better option than gasoline powered ones.

775
01:07:54,553 --> 01:07:56,274
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, excuse me.

776
01:07:59,271 --> 01:08:13,841
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this slide because it shows the spectrum of how much gas versus electricity different types of cars use from a from conventional gas to fully battery powered and because we use the word hybrid for both the.

777
01:08:14,721 --> 01:08:18,922
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a traditional hybrid and a plug-in hybrid, it can confuse people.

778
01:08:20,083 --> 01:08:34,588
[SPEAKER_00]: But like a more conventional hybrid, like a Prius, mostly runs on gas, but has the battery to assist for like short distances and things like that.

779
01:08:35,348 --> 01:08:41,810
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the plug-in hybrid is mostly using the battery, but you use the gas more on long distance trips.

780
01:08:46,784 --> 01:08:58,050
[SPEAKER_00]: And electric vehicles might cost more upfront, although there are rebates and tax credits that can help with that, but the operating costs and the maintenance costs are lower.

781
01:08:58,853 --> 01:09:01,936
[SPEAKER_00]: for electric vehicles than for gasoline cars.

782
01:09:03,517 --> 01:09:06,160
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's true for a lot of things that we've talked about here.

783
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:10,643
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more upfront cost, but the operating costs are less.

784
01:09:11,324 --> 01:09:14,687
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are rebates and tax credits to help with the upfront cost.

785
01:09:15,868 --> 01:09:18,851
[SPEAKER_00]: The plug-in hybrid is interesting because you get

786
01:09:20,535 --> 01:09:28,417
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you still have a gas engine, you get all of the maintenance of a gas engine plus the electric stuff too.

787
01:09:28,797 --> 01:09:35,239
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of a, it's not necessarily a cheaper option than a fully electric car.

788
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:48,282
[SPEAKER_00]: People get concerned about charging an electric vehicle, but most people could plug into a regular outlet at home each night and be fine.

789
01:09:50,775 --> 01:09:52,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I don't even have a driveway.

790
01:09:52,477 --> 01:09:54,238
[SPEAKER_00]: I just use public charging stations.

791
01:09:55,740 --> 01:10:01,685
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are more public chargers every day, including Medford owns 11 public chargers.

792
01:10:02,166 --> 01:10:03,967
[SPEAKER_00]: They're level two charging stations.

793
01:10:05,229 --> 01:10:11,915
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see all the chargers in our area that are publicly available by going to a map like this one I got from PlugShare.com.

794
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:18,978
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones that are on here, these are just stations that my car can use.

795
01:10:18,998 --> 01:10:24,008
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't even include things like Tesla superchargers that my car can't use.

796
01:10:26,907 --> 01:10:29,048
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Brenda, what's what's it like?

797
01:10:29,248 --> 01:10:29,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

798
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:35,252
[SPEAKER_06]: With your car so so what do you have to plug it in every.

799
01:10:35,272 --> 01:10:42,616
[SPEAKER_06]: 3 or 4 days and what do you just roll up on some do you mostly use the city.

800
01:10:43,436 --> 01:10:45,618
[SPEAKER_06]: City's charger, or I mean, in.

801
01:10:46,578 --> 01:10:49,520
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you use the city charger, you can do that while you're there at work.

802
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:50,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

803
01:10:50,641 --> 01:10:51,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

804
01:10:52,402 --> 01:10:58,386
[SPEAKER_06]: But what if you're not at work or something, you just roll up to a charger and what do you do?

805
01:10:58,426 --> 01:11:09,433
[SPEAKER_06]: You just, do you make a, I mean, are you plugged in for an hour or, you know, are you near a mall or something and you go visit the mall for a little while and have a lot, I mean, how do you know what I mean?

806
01:11:09,753 --> 01:11:10,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, exactly.

807
01:11:10,954 --> 01:11:14,657
[SPEAKER_06]: So most days in the life of a electric car owner life,

808
01:11:15,337 --> 01:11:17,578
[SPEAKER_06]: charge and, you know.

809
01:11:17,598 --> 01:11:19,878
[SPEAKER_00]: And no driveway to charge at home.

810
01:11:19,938 --> 01:11:20,338
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

811
01:11:21,479 --> 01:11:21,659
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

812
01:11:22,039 --> 01:11:33,122
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, most of the time I either charge here at work just like once a week for like four hours, or I'll charge at a charger near my home.

813
01:11:33,202 --> 01:11:37,703
[SPEAKER_00]: I have three of them in a, like a 15 minute walk from my house.

814
01:11:38,703 --> 01:11:44,848
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can just drive up to them, plug in, and walk home, and then go pick it up later.

815
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:49,672
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I usually do if I'm around here.

816
01:11:50,092 --> 01:12:02,602
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm traveling up to Maine to visit my family, I'll just plan where I'm stopping for bathroom breaks and for lunch around where there are level 3 chargers so they can charge pretty fast.

817
01:12:04,564 --> 01:12:06,885
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've kind of got my spots all mapped out.

818
01:12:06,945 --> 01:12:09,607
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time they add a new one in, I'm like, ooh, exciting.

819
01:12:09,647 --> 01:12:11,368
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go to a new restaurant now.

820
01:12:12,889 --> 01:12:13,589
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool.

821
01:12:13,609 --> 01:12:17,271
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have some close by and walking distance.

822
01:12:17,311 --> 01:12:29,599
[SPEAKER_06]: So you essentially could go plug your car in for the afternoon, go home, do a little house cleaning or reading or whatever it is you got planned to do at home for the day, and then go get it.

823
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:32,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, what about in the wintertime?

824
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:37,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it take longer to charge or is there any sort of difference?

825
01:12:39,943 --> 01:12:47,806
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say it probably, depending on the temperature, it could lose up to a third of its range.

826
01:12:48,487 --> 01:12:59,291
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got on the 260, I think they say the average is 260 for my car, for the range, but depending on how I drive it,

827
01:12:59,853 --> 01:13:02,296
[SPEAKER_00]: or in what the weather is like, I can get over 300 miles.

828
01:13:02,316 --> 01:13:07,321
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the cold weather, it's down more in the 200 mile range.

829
01:13:13,543 --> 01:13:14,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm sorry I'm sorry.

830
01:13:14,843 --> 01:13:15,844
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't mean to go ahead.

831
01:13:16,064 --> 01:13:17,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

832
01:13:17,545 --> 01:13:18,305
[SPEAKER_06]: 1 more 1 more question.

833
01:13:18,345 --> 01:13:20,046
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I have about, like.

834
01:13:20,927 --> 01:13:23,348
[SPEAKER_06]: So, if you just start a long drive somewhere.

835
01:13:23,908 --> 01:13:25,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe there are 2 questions here.

836
01:13:25,429 --> 01:13:35,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder about, you know, are these charging stations now kind of showing up at rest stops and a lot of rest stops and stuff like that when you're traveling, like, on the bike or something like that.

837
01:13:36,605 --> 01:13:37,306
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.

838
01:13:37,326 --> 01:13:42,029
[SPEAKER_00]: So just just to finish the coal temperature thing.

839
01:13:42,850 --> 01:13:48,474
[SPEAKER_00]: My car is it's not as good as some of the newer cars out there.

840
01:13:48,875 --> 01:13:50,856
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the newer ones have heat pump heaters.

841
01:13:51,577 --> 01:13:55,880
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're much more efficient and they so they don't lose range as much as mine does.

842
01:13:58,122 --> 01:14:01,665
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, so I think we had last Saturday we had

843
01:14:03,323 --> 01:14:07,890
[SPEAKER_00]: five cars here that had heat pump heaters, and so they didn't lose range like that.

844
01:14:10,994 --> 01:14:14,259
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, oh, rest areas, yeah.

845
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:15,381
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think

846
01:14:17,582 --> 01:14:25,706
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say all of the rest areas on the up 95 going up to Maine have them, but a lot of them do.

847
01:14:25,726 --> 01:14:33,229
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I know there are rest areas on 90 going west that have them as well.

848
01:14:33,289 --> 01:14:38,052
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there are actually federal incentives for

849
01:14:39,212 --> 01:14:44,556
[SPEAKER_00]: or actually each state had to make a plan for how they were going to build out their EV network.

850
01:14:45,237 --> 01:14:50,501
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the priorities was rest areas, getting level three chargers in rest areas.

851
01:14:50,821 --> 01:14:51,782
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty awesome.

852
01:14:51,822 --> 01:14:55,245
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're sort of popping up, you know, they're popping up here and there.

853
01:14:55,985 --> 01:14:56,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

854
01:14:57,266 --> 01:14:57,907
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't

855
01:14:59,415 --> 01:14:59,715
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.

856
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:07,477
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna say, and if you go on PlugShare and take a look, there are some of those dots on here that have like wrenches on them.

857
01:15:07,697 --> 01:15:11,359
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are ones that don't exist yet, but they're coming soon.

858
01:15:11,659 --> 01:15:15,000
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're planned new chargers.

859
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:23,322
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'll see those popping up, like as the state plans have come out, people have entered those into PlugShare saying, okay, this is gonna be coming.

860
01:15:23,342 --> 01:15:25,903
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a year before it gets here, but there's one coming here.

861
01:15:26,643 --> 01:15:27,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming soon.

862
01:15:27,844 --> 01:15:29,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's pretty awesome.

863
01:15:30,266 --> 01:15:34,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I just kind of wondered if the electric cars or anything like, um.

864
01:15:34,729 --> 01:15:38,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, motorcycles where gas powered motorcycles, of course.

865
01:15:39,132 --> 01:15:41,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we, we, we, you have, like, a reserve.

866
01:15:41,554 --> 01:15:42,595
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, if you.

867
01:15:43,195 --> 01:15:47,959
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess, because on a bike, you can't see, you know, you don't have a gas gauge most bikes.

868
01:15:48,459 --> 01:15:51,381
[SPEAKER_06]: So, do the electric cars sort of have something like that?

869
01:15:51,442 --> 01:15:52,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there some sort of, like.

870
01:15:55,225 --> 01:16:02,731
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, reserve, I don't know, battery or whatever, where, you know, it kind of starts, it sends you a warning.

871
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:08,336
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, yo, you know, you're on, you're about to, you're about to hop on borrowed time here.

872
01:16:08,356 --> 01:16:11,999
[SPEAKER_06]: So plan accordingly.

873
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:17,664
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and I've actually done, gotten to that point before, because I was driving home

874
01:16:18,865 --> 01:16:23,570
[SPEAKER_00]: by myself from Maine and it was nighttime and I didn't want to stop somewhere and charge.

875
01:16:25,292 --> 01:16:28,816
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was almost home and I was like, yeah, I can make it home.

876
01:16:28,876 --> 01:16:29,537
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be fine.

877
01:16:29,897 --> 01:16:35,423
[SPEAKER_00]: And it like, when I got below like 20 miles left on the rain, my range, it was like,

878
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:41,636
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Oh no, I don't know if I can make it.

879
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:42,918
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did.

880
01:16:43,138 --> 01:16:43,699
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fine.

881
01:16:43,739 --> 01:16:50,446
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they do plan in some like buffer into that range estimate that they give you, especially at that lower end.

882
01:16:51,007 --> 01:16:51,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

883
01:16:51,888 --> 01:16:52,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

884
01:16:52,429 --> 01:16:52,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

885
01:16:53,239 --> 01:16:53,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

886
01:16:53,659 --> 01:16:55,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

887
01:16:55,780 --> 01:17:03,142
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too bad you couldn't have like a power pack you could carry in your purse or maybe pop in the trunk of the car.

888
01:17:03,222 --> 01:17:06,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Those do exist.

889
01:17:06,563 --> 01:17:07,003
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

890
01:17:07,483 --> 01:17:20,686
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, in order for it to be big enough to hold enough charge to be useful for something like that, it would be pretty big and heavy, and it would actually reduce your efficiency of your car.

891
01:17:21,147 --> 01:17:22,347
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would actually lose

892
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:29,312
[SPEAKER_00]: more mileage than you would gain from having it.

893
01:17:30,052 --> 01:17:41,041
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will have that, especially if they're going on long trips in rural areas or something, but I don't think that's useful for most people.

894
01:17:41,061 --> 01:17:42,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

895
01:17:42,843 --> 01:17:43,763
[SPEAKER_06]: They interest me.

896
01:17:43,783 --> 01:17:49,488
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't know if there's one in my future, but they are incredibly interesting to me.

897
01:17:49,508 --> 01:17:49,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

898
01:17:53,366 --> 01:18:07,171
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and people are often worried about the cost of it, but compared to another new car, they're not necessarily more expensive.

899
01:18:08,712 --> 01:18:13,073
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine cost about 25,000 after all of the rebates.

900
01:18:15,894 --> 01:18:17,135
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you start looking at

901
01:18:18,565 --> 01:18:21,408
[SPEAKER_00]: the used vehicles out there.

902
01:18:21,428 --> 01:18:26,393
[SPEAKER_00]: There was someone at the EV showcase last weekend who bought her car used for $14,000.

903
01:18:26,633 --> 01:18:30,337
[SPEAKER_00]: There are definitely possibilities out there.

904
01:18:30,437 --> 01:18:30,557
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

905
01:18:38,402 --> 01:18:43,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, 14 grand, that doesn't, you know, it doesn't sound like a ton of money.

906
01:18:43,146 --> 01:18:47,770
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, in these days for a vehicle, an electric vehicle, that's pretty awesome.

907
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:48,350
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

908
01:18:48,450 --> 01:18:50,432
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the operating costs are cheaper, right?

909
01:18:50,492 --> 01:18:58,819
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and it's, it's pegged to your electricity at home rather than the, you know, shifting gas prices.

910
01:18:58,959 --> 01:18:59,240
[SPEAKER_00]: So.

911
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:00,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

912
01:19:00,721 --> 01:19:00,921
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

913
01:19:01,822 --> 01:19:01,942
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

914
01:19:04,292 --> 01:19:06,575
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned that there are different levels of chargers.

915
01:19:08,116 --> 01:19:13,683
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're charging with a regular 120 volt outlet, you can charge about 50 miles overnight.

916
01:19:15,344 --> 01:19:19,769
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're charging with a level two charger, like we have here at City Hall, you can get about 300 miles overnight.

917
01:19:22,452 --> 01:19:34,519
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with a level two, you can either, if you're at home, you can either plug it into like a 240 volt outlet, like a dryer outlet, or you can install a full charger at home.

918
01:19:35,459 --> 01:19:40,762
[SPEAKER_00]: And National Grid has incentives to pay, I think 100% of the cost of installing a charger at your home.

919
01:19:43,701 --> 01:19:50,706
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're charging with a level three station, like you find at rest stops on the highway, you can get about 170 miles in 30 minutes.

920
01:19:55,530 --> 01:20:01,575
[SPEAKER_00]: So different types of charging for different uses, right?

921
01:20:01,635 --> 01:20:14,384
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you wouldn't want level three chargers everywhere because that's just a really high spike in electricity usage and that's not great for the grid necessarily if you can just charge slowly at home instead overnight.

922
01:20:17,006 --> 01:20:20,949
[SPEAKER_03]: And people can leave their car overnight on those chargers in the city?

923
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:22,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

924
01:20:25,193 --> 01:20:36,107
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the one here at City Hall, there's a hotel right on the corner here, and we often have people from the hotel plugging in at City Hall after hours and leaving it overnight.

925
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:41,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you have to pay, don't you?

926
01:20:44,311 --> 01:20:45,131
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to pay.

927
01:20:46,532 --> 01:20:49,353
[SPEAKER_06]: The longer it's on there, the more you pay?

928
01:20:49,593 --> 01:20:57,575
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, you're just paying for the number of kilowatt hours that you're drawing from it.

929
01:20:58,716 --> 01:21:04,224
[SPEAKER_00]: If you stop charging, then you're not paying for it anymore.

930
01:21:04,344 --> 01:21:06,707
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, we are going to be moving.

931
01:21:06,767 --> 01:21:10,873
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned last time we met we are going to be moving to a to a system where.

932
01:21:12,011 --> 01:21:21,076
[SPEAKER_00]: if your car is sitting there for an hour after you've finished charging, then we'll start charging you to be parked there.

933
01:21:21,096 --> 01:21:27,380
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're really only supposed to be connected to the chargers while you're charging.

934
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:35,325
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to say, I think there's a way for us to make an exception for people who are charging overnight.

935
01:21:35,345 --> 01:21:40,948
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we do want to encourage people to charge overnight because that's better for the electric grid because it helps to balance things out.

936
01:21:44,218 --> 01:21:46,339
[SPEAKER_06]: So, when you, when you charge, do you.

937
01:21:47,039 --> 01:21:51,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you say how much how much time you how much time you want to charge for.

938
01:21:51,981 --> 01:21:56,082
[SPEAKER_06]: So, when you go to plug in, do you say, okay, I'm, I'm charging for 2 hours.

939
01:21:57,183 --> 01:22:00,644
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you just plug in and then you need to.

940
01:22:00,664 --> 01:22:00,844
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

941
01:22:01,024 --> 01:22:01,184
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

942
01:22:04,739 --> 01:22:05,280
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, 1 more.

943
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:05,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

944
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:14,074
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this I'm hoping that this maybe this is my last questions for for this, but so let me ask you this.

945
01:22:14,154 --> 01:22:19,542
[SPEAKER_06]: So, if if I were planning to, if I was thinking about buying an electric vehicle.

946
01:22:20,784 --> 01:22:25,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a certain order to do things?

947
01:22:25,907 --> 01:22:48,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Before I even consider an electric car and I'm thinking about having a plug at my home and stuff, do I need to find out what kind of plug I can install at the house or if it would be even configurable at my house kind of thing, then go look at a car?

948
01:22:49,528 --> 01:23:01,532
[SPEAKER_06]: And does charging system, are there different charging systems for different cars or different makes of cars or that sort of thing?

949
01:23:02,152 --> 01:23:05,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's some of the different plugs that you'll see here.

950
01:23:05,813 --> 01:23:13,116
[SPEAKER_00]: So the J1772 here and the Tesla are both level two charging, but they're for different types of cars.

951
01:23:13,936 --> 01:23:19,420
[SPEAKER_00]: And same with the DC fast charging ones here, they're all DC fast charging, but they're for different types of cars.

952
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:25,003
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd want to choose 1st, what car you wanted and then see what plug it needs.

953
01:23:25,864 --> 01:23:36,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, car 1st, then plug and so do you think that, um, you know, most plate, most homes and stuff are configurable for.

954
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:38,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever sort of plug you might need.

955
01:23:39,352 --> 01:23:44,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, do you know of any roadblocks for that sort of thing?

956
01:23:44,895 --> 01:24:01,284
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the only roadblocks that I'm aware of would be, well, A, if you don't have a driveway like me, or if you're in an apartment building or something where you don't have permission to make that change to it.

957
01:24:01,384 --> 01:24:02,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

958
01:24:02,765 --> 01:24:02,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

959
01:24:03,866 --> 01:24:04,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

960
01:24:05,632 --> 01:24:20,562
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I know in addition to National Grid having incentives to install chargers at your home, I know some of the car manufacturers also offer that as a bonus thing to try to convince you to do it.

961
01:24:20,602 --> 01:24:28,607
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll also either pay completely for or give you some money towards getting a charger installed.

962
01:24:28,907 --> 01:24:30,488
[SPEAKER_00]: It will add on.

963
01:24:31,088 --> 01:24:31,308
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

964
01:24:31,768 --> 01:24:46,252
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of them I know, like Alicia in my office just bought an EV, and she got two years of free charging on Electrify America charging stations.

965
01:24:47,052 --> 01:24:49,813
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's not what we have here at City Hall, we have Chargepoint.

966
01:24:51,433 --> 01:24:58,275
[SPEAKER_00]: but those Electrify America ones are more of the level three chargers that you'll find at rest stops and places like that.

967
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:02,116
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a nice little bonus.

968
01:25:02,496 --> 01:25:03,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no doubt.

969
01:25:06,777 --> 01:25:07,277
[SPEAKER_03]: No doubt.

970
01:25:07,777 --> 01:25:13,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Brenda, we had the parking department come to our office.

971
01:25:13,919 --> 01:25:18,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me?

972
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:19,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

973
01:25:20,127 --> 01:25:21,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I couldn't see you over here.

974
01:25:21,328 --> 01:25:22,729
[SPEAKER_03]: It was weird.

975
01:25:23,349 --> 01:25:29,312
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was talking about the increasing the number of the two-hour parking in the city.

976
01:25:30,133 --> 01:25:36,156
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that they have this sensor that if the person stay more than two hours, you know, they get a ticket.

977
01:25:37,237 --> 01:25:42,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe something that you guys can use for those chargers, you know, those parking with the charger.

978
01:25:43,723 --> 01:25:44,184
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.

979
01:25:44,864 --> 01:25:49,168
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that on city streets or were they in the parking lot?

980
01:25:49,449 --> 01:25:49,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

981
01:25:49,829 --> 01:26:00,079
[SPEAKER_03]: The city parking that they have and then they increased the two-hour parking and they eliminated the 15-minute one, something like that, she was explaining to us.

982
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:08,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Then she said, well, we're probably going to ask how we know if the person passed the time, like we have a sensor.

983
01:26:08,967 --> 01:26:20,072
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that automatic, you know, let us know if you pass that time, so the person is going to get a ticket, you know, because two hours is more than enough for them to take care of whatever they need to do, you know.

984
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:20,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

985
01:26:21,873 --> 01:26:27,595
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe something that you guys can check with them, what do they do, you know, how is that system?

986
01:26:28,196 --> 01:26:29,436
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good suggestion.

987
01:26:29,456 --> 01:26:37,480
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was asking about whether it was street or parking lot, because right now the parking lots are four hours, I think.

988
01:26:38,424 --> 01:26:49,542
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm wondering if they're reducing the number of hours in the parking lots or if they're just like doing that for like the on street parking and like business areas or something.

989
01:26:50,935 --> 01:27:02,278
[SPEAKER_03]: My understanding was the main streets, those 15 minutes parking spots that they have in the street, and they increase for two hours.

990
01:27:02,338 --> 01:27:13,522
[SPEAKER_03]: So people will have time to go to the business and stuff without getting ticket or not extending, staying longer than that, what is not fair for the other people that also can take advantage of that.

991
01:27:13,542 --> 01:27:15,022
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

992
01:27:17,177 --> 01:27:21,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we don't have any chargers on the actual streets right now.

993
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:23,601
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just in city parking lots.

994
01:27:24,201 --> 01:27:33,126
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would love to have some on the streets, especially in neighborhoods where there's not a lot of parking, like there's not a lot of off-street parking.

995
01:27:33,667 --> 01:27:40,751
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like multifamily buildings without enough area in the driveway for everybody to park there.

996
01:27:40,771 --> 01:27:42,312
[SPEAKER_00]: So more people are parking on the street.

997
01:27:42,332 --> 01:27:46,074
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be really useful for people to be able to plug in

998
01:27:46,774 --> 01:27:52,736
[SPEAKER_00]: and charge overnight where they're parked on the side of the road there.

999
01:27:52,756 --> 01:28:02,799
[SPEAKER_00]: We're running into some issues with that, so that might not be the very next thing that we do, but I'm working on it.

1000
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:13,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know if that is a limit of residence parking passes that a house can have?

1001
01:28:15,699 --> 01:28:23,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I see my neighbors, like they have like four or five cars, you know, like, because everybody rent a room, you know, so, so many people living over there.

1002
01:28:24,682 --> 01:28:39,247
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and I was just thinking like, you know, maybe have a limit by household, you know, like, well, your house is a two family home, you know, maybe each house can have two cars, you know, and have that many, you know what I'm saying?

1003
01:28:39,267 --> 01:28:40,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Like resident parking.

1004
01:28:40,887 --> 01:28:43,408
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there are any, any limits for that.

1005
01:28:46,344 --> 01:28:51,549
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are limits on visitor parking passes that you can have about resident parking.

1006
01:28:54,332 --> 01:28:55,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well.

1007
01:28:59,057 --> 01:28:59,197
[SPEAKER_00]: Um.

1008
01:29:01,711 --> 01:29:05,212
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all that I have for this information.

1009
01:29:05,353 --> 01:29:22,680
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the only other things that I wanted to mention, I didn't make slides for these, but just to mention in passing, for other appliances, the major thing you should do is just look for the Energy Star label, because the federal government is already labeling things that are more energy efficient than others.

1010
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:29,283
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for lighting, look for LEDs instead of other things.

1011
01:29:30,644 --> 01:29:38,208
[SPEAKER_00]: Most lighting right now is efficient LEDs, but there are still halogens on store shelves that are less efficient.

1012
01:29:38,809 --> 01:29:43,251
[SPEAKER_00]: So it still matters that you're looking out for the LEDs.

1013
01:29:43,271 --> 01:29:49,375
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's...

1014
01:29:50,724 --> 01:29:54,467
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, any any other questions about any other part of it?

1015
01:29:54,507 --> 01:29:57,229
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a lot of conversation about the electric vehicle part.

1016
01:30:08,479 --> 01:30:10,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool, I think that's it for that part of it then.

1017
01:30:11,781 --> 01:30:11,981
[SPEAKER_00]: Um.

1018
01:30:14,664 --> 01:30:18,627
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we want to talk about at the next meeting?

1019
01:30:20,686 --> 01:30:22,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me stop sharing my screen here.

1020
01:30:24,469 --> 01:30:28,552
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a few things that we've mentioned in previous meetings.

1021
01:30:30,314 --> 01:30:41,163
[SPEAKER_00]: We had said there were, we maybe wanted to have the tree warden come to a future meeting to talk about trees in the city.

1022
01:30:44,452 --> 01:30:49,334
[SPEAKER_00]: We said maybe ask to have someone from the transportation department come by.

1023
01:30:49,354 --> 01:31:04,421
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a useful thing for that would be to have some specific topics that we wanted to talk to them about so that we could tell them ahead of time what we're looking to learn and then they could talk about that and then anything else they thought would be useful for us.

1024
01:31:09,343 --> 01:31:13,625
[SPEAKER_00]: So was there anything in particular about either one of those that you really wanted to dig into?

1025
01:31:16,323 --> 01:31:20,226
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you have the list to the to share just so.

1026
01:31:21,206 --> 01:31:23,268
[SPEAKER_00]: We can, I can refresh my memory.

1027
01:31:23,848 --> 01:31:28,391
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I'm dropping it in the chat, but the only things that I had written down were.

1028
01:31:28,411 --> 01:31:35,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Those 2 things, and then just the, the green jobs in general talking about, like.

1029
01:31:38,213 --> 01:31:47,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like we were saying about training programs and how to connect people to jobs, especially city projects.

1030
01:31:48,530 --> 01:31:58,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like Lizette has a topic because I'm very disappointed now that you pointed out about the tree warden.

1031
01:32:00,437 --> 01:32:03,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Any tree that's in that's in Medford has to be.

1032
01:32:03,838 --> 01:32:06,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, reported to take out right?

1033
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:09,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, they have to go to the city and ask whoever like.

1034
01:32:10,642 --> 01:32:11,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.

1035
01:32:11,662 --> 01:32:17,723
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a series of three tree ordinances that are being considered by the city council.

1036
01:32:19,004 --> 01:32:26,525
[SPEAKER_00]: And the update I got on that was they made some revisions to them and they resubmitted them to the city council.

1037
01:32:27,265 --> 01:32:31,086
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're talking with city staff and the city council is considering them.

1038
01:32:31,126 --> 01:32:32,466
[SPEAKER_00]: So those haven't been passed yet.

1039
01:32:33,426 --> 01:32:37,687
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully by our next meeting, we'll have some update on where those are.

1040
01:32:38,777 --> 01:32:52,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying because the, I don't know if you guys know where the Franklin School is, but they took out a gorgeous, beautiful tree that has been there for years since I went there in kindergarten.

1041
01:32:52,685 --> 01:32:54,886
[SPEAKER_02]: So imagine I'm 31 now, so imagine how far.

1042
01:32:55,586 --> 01:33:02,851
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm very annoyed because like, you know, we kind of planted our like stuff for like the future.

1043
01:33:02,891 --> 01:33:04,792
[SPEAKER_02]: So like after 50 years, we opened it.

1044
01:33:04,812 --> 01:33:06,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, your time capsule.

1045
01:33:07,613 --> 01:33:15,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Capsule other like beside that I'm really mad about the tree Just saying yeah, do you know if there was a reason for it like was it?

1046
01:33:16,959 --> 01:33:19,981
[SPEAKER_00]: Like honestly it did not even construction or something.

1047
01:33:20,001 --> 01:33:33,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh It's like the the Franklin school already was like like on the outside obviously It's like a more than a hundred year old building at this point, but like they remodeled the whole entire thing inside There was no construction to do whatsoever.

1048
01:33:34,229 --> 01:33:35,310
[SPEAKER_02]: They literally just like

1049
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:39,021
[SPEAKER_02]: chopped that tree into pieces and it was gorgeous.

1050
01:33:39,401 --> 01:33:40,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't block anything.

1051
01:33:40,982 --> 01:33:48,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't, I'd be so pissed if the people from the apartment said something because I swear that tree was absolutely gorgeous there.

1052
01:33:49,346 --> 01:33:54,908
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a sick tree that... The school was turned into condos or something?

1053
01:33:54,928 --> 01:33:56,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1054
01:33:57,389 --> 01:34:00,190
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not, you said it didn't block a view or anything like that?

1055
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:01,471
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it didn't at all.

1056
01:34:02,531 --> 01:34:04,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm telling you, I don't know if, let me, where's my.

1057
01:34:05,533 --> 01:34:10,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, but that's why the residents need to stop participating in the city council meetings.

1058
01:34:10,877 --> 01:34:14,059
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing was gonna get chopped up, that's the problem, okay?

1059
01:34:14,079 --> 01:34:16,200
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the reason for the tree ordinance, right?

1060
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:26,387
[SPEAKER_00]: Is so that there will be notice about things like that beforehand and, you know, if there's not a good reason for it, then they wouldn't be able to do it.

1061
01:34:26,407 --> 01:34:27,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but you need permission for that, right?

1062
01:34:28,008 --> 01:34:30,450
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to pass through the city and everything, correct?

1063
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:36,171
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the city council needs to take it up and approve the ordinance before it.

1064
01:34:37,811 --> 01:34:45,033
[SPEAKER_03]: We always pay attention to the agenda to make sure we know what it is so we can participate and have our voice heard.

1065
01:34:45,133 --> 01:34:52,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm sure if people knew or aware of that, everybody would be attending the meeting and complain about it.

1066
01:34:52,274 --> 01:34:53,314
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just so sad.

1067
01:34:54,354 --> 01:34:57,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at how gorgeous the tree is.

1068
01:34:58,756 --> 01:35:07,041
[SPEAKER_02]: In the wintertime, obviously, you didn't even see nothing because it wasn't, but I just.

1069
01:35:07,201 --> 01:35:20,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this tree ordinance, is it for trees on public property or is the ordinance also for trees on private property?

1070
01:35:21,259 --> 01:35:22,040
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for both.

1071
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:23,701
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why there are three ordinances.

1072
01:35:23,921 --> 01:35:25,402
[SPEAKER_00]: One is for public trees.

1073
01:35:26,182 --> 01:35:28,544
[SPEAKER_00]: One is for private trees on private property.

1074
01:35:29,044 --> 01:35:42,493
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one is to create a tree committee in order to help to manage the extra work that will be coming in for people getting permits to cut down trees.

1075
01:35:45,995 --> 01:35:46,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1076
01:35:48,917 --> 01:35:49,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1077
01:35:50,132 --> 01:36:03,179
[SPEAKER_02]: All I know is Brenda, every time I drive Gabe now, like, you know, to the Andrews and I see like that, they literally like shaved it up and had a pile of the shavings for like a week.

1078
01:36:03,959 --> 01:36:12,844
[SPEAKER_02]: And then now it's like that, like, kind of like soil, like brown soil put there or something.

1079
01:36:12,864 --> 01:36:13,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1080
01:36:13,780 --> 01:36:14,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to cry.

1081
01:36:15,121 --> 01:36:17,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm serious, like, really bothered me so much.

1082
01:36:18,443 --> 01:36:24,688
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's a true childhood that was just ripped down and was uprooted.

1083
01:36:24,708 --> 01:36:27,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was not ready for that.

1084
01:36:27,349 --> 01:36:32,433
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, like, at least like, you know, I knew that the buildings there and nothing around it changed.

1085
01:36:32,473 --> 01:36:35,735
[SPEAKER_02]: But like that for me was like, sad.

1086
01:36:37,477 --> 01:36:48,537
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I will get a copy of the revised ordinances so that I can share it with you guys and then maybe we can talk more about it in our next meeting.

1087
01:36:49,779 --> 01:36:49,979
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1088
01:36:51,092 --> 01:36:51,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1089
01:36:52,092 --> 01:36:59,974
[SPEAKER_02]: You do realize that the trees are like the best thing that we could have for our, you know, planet gives us oxygen.

1090
01:37:00,374 --> 01:37:07,376
[SPEAKER_00]: So for so many reasons, pulling carbon emissions out of the air, giving a shade and cooling us down.

1091
01:37:07,956 --> 01:37:08,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1092
01:37:08,856 --> 01:37:12,357
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the best tree to like sit there and chill.

1093
01:37:13,197 --> 01:37:13,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me tell you.

1094
01:37:15,378 --> 01:37:16,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was so beautiful.

1095
01:37:16,818 --> 01:37:17,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't get it.

1096
01:37:17,398 --> 01:37:17,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1097
01:37:18,079 --> 01:37:18,459
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1098
01:37:18,699 --> 01:37:18,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

1099
01:37:18,979 --> 01:37:19,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1100
01:37:19,219 --> 01:37:19,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll it.

1101
01:37:21,297 --> 01:37:22,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Take a hole and plant another.

1102
01:37:25,201 --> 01:37:28,704
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes so many years for it to get to that height.

1103
01:37:28,784 --> 01:37:29,245
[SPEAKER_06]: No doubt.

1104
01:37:29,385 --> 01:37:29,845
[SPEAKER_06]: No doubt.

1105
01:37:29,925 --> 01:37:30,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know.

1106
01:37:32,167 --> 01:37:43,138
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the ordinance is if you are cutting down a larger tree, you will need to replant multiple smaller trees in order to make up for it.

1107
01:37:45,014 --> 01:37:45,434
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.

1108
01:37:46,314 --> 01:37:49,095
[SPEAKER_00]: Then think twice about taking out the tree.

1109
01:37:51,455 --> 01:37:57,917
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we can talk about this in more detail at our next meeting, and I'll see if Aggie, the tree warden, can come to it too.

1110
01:37:59,597 --> 01:38:00,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, yeah.

1111
01:38:00,257 --> 01:38:01,377
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great idea.

1112
01:38:03,438 --> 01:38:03,778
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.

1113
01:38:04,238 --> 01:38:10,839
[SPEAKER_03]: And can we just maybe have the link for the resources too?

1114
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:12,440
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe can

1115
01:38:13,398 --> 01:38:16,059
[SPEAKER_03]: If we have the time to talk about that too, the flyers.

1116
01:38:16,839 --> 01:38:17,739
[SPEAKER_03]: For what resources?

1117
01:38:18,479 --> 01:38:24,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the document, the folder without the flyers with the resources.

1118
01:38:25,021 --> 01:38:25,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1119
01:38:25,441 --> 01:38:25,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1120
01:38:26,202 --> 01:38:27,242
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely all the flyers.

1121
01:38:27,402 --> 01:38:27,602
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

1122
01:38:27,622 --> 01:38:32,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

1123
01:38:32,804 --> 01:38:33,044
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1124
01:38:34,644 --> 01:38:37,745
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody have anything else we should talk about tonight?

1125
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:56,482
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I, when I met Brenda, when I was like the chat thing was like, you know, the, the, the, the thing you had that gave us all of the topics that we wanted to talk about.

1126
01:38:56,802 --> 01:38:57,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I meant the link of that.

1127
01:38:58,644 --> 01:38:59,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.

1128
01:38:59,965 --> 01:39:01,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Lost for me in the email.

1129
01:39:01,607 --> 01:39:04,550
[SPEAKER_02]: And I need to like pin that thing there at this point.

1130
01:39:05,490 --> 01:39:07,652
[SPEAKER_00]: The list of priorities.

1131
01:39:07,873 --> 01:39:08,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

1132
01:39:10,152 --> 01:39:11,293
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I can resend that.

1133
01:39:12,253 --> 01:39:13,173
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I'm going to pin it.

1134
01:39:13,994 --> 01:39:14,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1135
01:39:15,174 --> 01:39:22,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe just put it together with maybe a different folder and everything just in one place, every time you need it, everything's there.

1136
01:39:22,638 --> 01:39:23,098
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fair.

1137
01:39:23,158 --> 01:39:30,881
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we should just have a shared folder for everything that we do, including all of the meeting minutes and agendas and things like that.

1138
01:39:30,901 --> 01:39:30,981
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1139
01:39:31,001 --> 01:39:32,182
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, most of those are available.

1140
01:39:32,262 --> 01:39:38,485
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all available online as well, but we could just have a shared folder that we can have for our own information as well.

1141
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:41,021
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I pin it.

1142
01:39:41,041 --> 01:39:50,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me tell you the amount of emails that we get and then I'm trying to find something and I'm like.

1143
01:39:51,584 --> 01:39:52,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to cry.

1144
01:39:52,725 --> 01:39:54,565
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot.

1145
01:39:59,107 --> 01:40:03,628
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's nothing else we should, I think we need a motion to adjourn.

1146
01:40:05,629 --> 01:40:06,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing else guys.

1147
01:40:08,490 --> 01:40:08,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

1148
01:40:11,026 --> 01:40:12,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Natasha, you're okay?

1149
01:40:13,009 --> 01:40:13,690
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't talk?

1150
01:40:15,954 --> 01:40:16,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Samia?

1151
01:40:16,936 --> 01:40:17,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Nada?

1152
01:40:18,278 --> 01:40:18,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Nada.

1153
01:40:19,219 --> 01:40:21,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so motion to adjourn the meeting.

1154
01:40:22,825 --> 01:40:23,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

1155
01:40:27,672 --> 01:40:28,273
[SPEAKER_00]: All in favor?

1156
01:40:30,076 --> 01:40:30,196
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

1157
01:40:30,998 --> 01:40:31,839
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

1158
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:33,301
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up from Natasha.

1159
01:40:33,321 --> 01:40:35,064
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

1160
01:40:35,144 --> 01:40:35,845
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, everyone.
