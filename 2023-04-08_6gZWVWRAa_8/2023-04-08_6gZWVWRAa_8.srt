1
00:00:00,051 --> 00:00:01,593
[SPEAKER_14]: It was before Bill got here.

2
00:00:01,633 --> 00:00:05,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Bill got here in 2016 and we had community breakfast before he came.

3
00:00:17,134 --> 00:00:18,475
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I do remember that.

4
00:00:18,555 --> 00:00:19,176
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course I do.

5
00:00:19,196 --> 00:00:19,676
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember.

6
00:00:19,696 --> 00:00:21,257
[SPEAKER_09]: I absolutely remember.

7
00:00:21,357 --> 00:00:24,379
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm so glad we started it off because it's good to get folks here.

8
00:00:35,027 --> 00:00:38,029
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, to see what we're doing at the community center.

9
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:39,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Before then, nobody knew.

10
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,794
[SPEAKER_14]: Except you, because you were here coming to the senior lunches, right?

11
00:00:44,974 --> 00:00:46,115
[SPEAKER_14]: You knew, but nobody else.

12
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:02,426
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, what's her name?

13
00:01:02,446 --> 00:01:02,927
[SPEAKER_14]: Melody.

14
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:03,407
[SPEAKER_14]: Melody.

15
00:01:03,427 --> 00:01:04,809
[SPEAKER_14]: Top of the morning.

16
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:05,470
[SPEAKER_14]: How are you?

17
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,371
[SPEAKER_14]: Good, how are you?

18
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:07,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:12,058
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I, um... How old were you when you first met her?

20
00:01:12,098 --> 00:01:13,139
[SPEAKER_14]: You didn't know her?

21
00:01:13,179 --> 00:01:15,162
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I didn't know her.

22
00:01:15,182 --> 00:01:16,463
[SPEAKER_14]: You didn't know her?

23
00:01:16,603 --> 00:01:17,765
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I didn't know her.

24
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:18,686
[SPEAKER_14]: You didn't know her?

25
00:01:18,726 --> 00:01:19,527
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I didn't know her.

26
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:20,808
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a good one.

27
00:01:36,205 --> 00:01:39,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Is your granddaughter going to come do basketball again this year?

28
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:40,607
[SPEAKER_14]: She had a ball last year.

29
00:01:40,687 --> 00:01:41,287
[SPEAKER_14]: I did, I did.

30
00:01:41,307 --> 00:01:44,108
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I look forward to that every year.

31
00:01:44,148 --> 00:01:45,129
[SPEAKER_14]: She had a great time.

32
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:47,230
[SPEAKER_14]: Good, you're doing it again.

33
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,710
[SPEAKER_15]: So long.

34
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:54,753
[SPEAKER_07]: You saw the report that just came out that put us down to the third and highest in the league of reds.

35
00:01:54,813 --> 00:01:57,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I put her in the top of the list.

36
00:01:57,594 --> 00:01:58,975
[SPEAKER_07]: What can we do with that?

37
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,336
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got a bigger alternative.

38
00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:02,076
[SPEAKER_14]: That's for sure.

39
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:06,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

40
00:02:06,378 --> 00:02:06,658
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

41
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:27,169
[SPEAKER_14]: Good.

42
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:28,470
[SPEAKER_14]: How are you doing?

43
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:34,315
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just going to ask one of your questions.

44
00:02:34,395 --> 00:02:40,099
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought you were going to ask one of my questions.

45
00:02:40,339 --> 00:02:41,640
[SPEAKER_17]: How did you get it?

46
00:02:52,687 --> 00:02:55,448
[SPEAKER_07]: So, when COVID struck, she was in New York.

47
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:56,868
[SPEAKER_07]: She was in New York.

48
00:02:57,008 --> 00:03:00,169
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't a good place, but she took it to New York.

49
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:03,850
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how she found out that New York was good for her.

50
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,070
[SPEAKER_14]: So, she started dancing.

51
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,350
[SPEAKER_14]: She's finishing up her junior.

52
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,051
[SPEAKER_09]: So, she went back home.

53
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:11,131
[SPEAKER_14]: And she wasn't done.

54
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:16,772
[SPEAKER_15]: She said that she was bragging about, you know, being terrible, being 70.

55
00:03:17,232 --> 00:03:17,732
[SPEAKER_15]: I know!

56
00:03:17,872 --> 00:03:18,232
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.

57
00:03:21,293 --> 00:03:23,314
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, which way is that going?

58
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:48,021
Thank you very much.

59
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,500
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything as good as gold.

60
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:29,793
[SPEAKER_14]: Representative Donato, here's a chair here for you.

61
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:48,088
[SPEAKER_15]: If I got to get it, I'm going to do a little library.

62
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:53,009
[SPEAKER_15]: I heard the majority of the family gave us another 10.

63
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:06,552
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

64
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,881
[SPEAKER_09]: I did some things wrong.

65
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:27,581
[SPEAKER_09]: It does.

66
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:28,642
[SPEAKER_15]: A little massage.

67
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:45,232
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

68
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:46,313
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm good.

69
00:06:05,971 --> 00:06:09,132
[SPEAKER_14]: I never went in that session.

70
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:10,352
[SPEAKER_14]: There was an English teacher.

71
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,613
[SPEAKER_14]: Julia was the mom of someone I went to school with.

72
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:34,820
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom will be there in about 10 minutes.

73
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,621
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going anyway, but I said she's going.

74
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:40,443
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll try to show her the ATV.

75
00:06:40,523 --> 00:06:40,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Ma'am.

76
00:06:41,043 --> 00:06:41,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sure.

77
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:47,006
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you all are trying to make the test happen for us, but I want to also...

78
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:49,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it okay if I announce?

79
00:06:49,306 --> 00:06:53,047
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I wanted to ask, but should I announce?

80
00:06:53,087 --> 00:06:58,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Your announcement has to go first, then I can announce the winners at the next meeting.

81
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:01,529
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have a meeting on Monday.

82
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:04,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, whatever, listen, whatever works for you.

83
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't worry, you know, I'm good, I'm fine.

84
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,511
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was debating, and I'm like, well, you know what, I should let your things go first.

85
00:07:11,551 --> 00:07:12,332
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

86
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,615
[SPEAKER_06]: I drove by your mural yesterday.

87
00:07:18,675 --> 00:07:20,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, do you see it with my big face?

88
00:07:20,756 --> 00:07:22,898
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to pull over and get a photo.

89
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:23,919
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost caused an accident.

90
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:24,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you don't want to do that.

91
00:07:31,403 --> 00:07:35,905
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, I will follow up, but what I wanted to have happen is I wanted yours.

92
00:07:35,945 --> 00:07:56,254
[SPEAKER_09]: For you to be yours first, and then for me to say, this is a mentor to a lawyer, or is it okay when you send me a list, I can recognize them also at, well, you will formally recognize them, I can at least say their names at the school committee, and I don't know, I didn't wanna, I didn't want to steal any of, like.

93
00:07:56,294 --> 00:07:58,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so, I don't think you would.

94
00:07:59,436 --> 00:08:02,697
[SPEAKER_06]: So do it in whatever way makes sense to you, really.

95
00:08:02,737 --> 00:08:08,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I've gotten confirmation from most of them that they're going to be there.

96
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,722
[SPEAKER_06]: They're a couple because of school vacation week that's traveling.

97
00:08:11,762 --> 00:08:23,048
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I will do is the two or three that can't make it, I'm going to actually have them come on the 25th, which is my other night when I have the adult parts.

98
00:08:23,268 --> 00:08:26,249
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll introduce them, I'll recognize them then.

99
00:08:32,647 --> 00:08:43,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and then what we're going to do to kind of augment the AT is I'm going to add an open mic component for some of the kids that didn't win.

100
00:08:43,974 --> 00:08:48,617
[SPEAKER_06]: So that, you know, they can at least get to, you know, speak their piece.

101
00:08:48,637 --> 00:08:53,460
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to sit on his side because I think the name is supposed to survive.

102
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, she's here.

103
00:08:54,461 --> 00:08:57,363
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why I'm going to sit facing, looking toward him.

104
00:08:57,383 --> 00:08:59,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I can tell you, you know,

105
00:09:02,546 --> 00:09:05,188
[SPEAKER_09]: I can put another seat up, that's not a problem.

106
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:31,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Get an appetizer.

107
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,752
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to make sure there's a seat for the mayor, okay.

108
00:09:34,812 --> 00:09:36,553
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know who else.

109
00:09:36,714 --> 00:09:37,914
[SPEAKER_09]: I can be late today.

110
00:09:38,015 --> 00:09:40,016
[SPEAKER_15]: I can be a little late today.

111
00:09:40,056 --> 00:09:50,764
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but Barbara's telling me that we were doing as well, but we keep asking about her because she hasn't been dealing with it, but it's becoming quite a problem.

112
00:09:50,804 --> 00:09:55,007
[SPEAKER_14]: They even ask, can we, can you figure out that parking?

113
00:09:57,989 --> 00:09:59,049
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no, no, no, no.

114
00:10:24,136 --> 00:10:24,216
Yeah.

115
00:10:24,276 --> 00:10:24,356
Yeah.

116
00:10:48,763 --> 00:10:49,885
You're welcome.

117
00:11:03,865 --> 00:11:05,005
I'm getting a front row.

118
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:05,786
Has everyone got one now?

119
00:11:05,806 --> 00:11:06,386
My daughter's on it.

120
00:11:31,853 --> 00:11:32,354
[SPEAKER_14]: It's perfect.

121
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:00,493
[SPEAKER_15]: Good morning.

122
00:12:26,952 --> 00:12:28,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning, friends and neighbors.

123
00:12:29,575 --> 00:12:33,339
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Terry E. Carter, and I am a writer and a poet.

124
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:38,185
[SPEAKER_06]: I am the Poet Laureate of Medford, Massachusetts, at least for a few more months.

125
00:12:39,776 --> 00:12:45,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I also have the privilege of directing elder services here at our beloved West Medford Community Center.

126
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:51,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to our first live community legislative forum in a few years.

127
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:59,310
[SPEAKER_06]: COVID and Zoom have structured a unique long distance relationship for us for quite some time now.

128
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:10,864
[SPEAKER_06]: But our doors have been open for some time, and we're coming to you in person here at 111 Arlington Street.

129
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:22,050
[SPEAKER_06]: We're very proud to be presenting this opportunity for you to hear from a significant slice of Medford's local and state legislators and public officials.

130
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,882
[SPEAKER_06]: We've received a number of questions from several folks in attendance this morning.

131
00:13:29,502 --> 00:13:36,864
[SPEAKER_06]: We've taken a look at that list and tried to be mindful of which inquiries impact the greatest number of constituents in this city.

132
00:13:37,764 --> 00:13:43,266
[SPEAKER_06]: In the interest of time, we may not be able to address every question that we've received.

133
00:13:43,746 --> 00:13:57,754
[SPEAKER_06]: However, these duly elected and appointed officials have assured us that they are open and available to continuing these conversations in the ongoing attempt to respond to each concern.

134
00:14:00,135 --> 00:14:08,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Today is about the dignity of community and respect for an institution that has been here for 80 plus years.

135
00:14:10,298 --> 00:14:17,302
[SPEAKER_06]: We recognize that there are strong opinions and valid differing views and political perspectives in the room.

136
00:14:18,223 --> 00:14:32,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Our intent is to have folks agree to disagree without being disagreeable and without pulling us away from the core values of respect, civility, and simple decency.

137
00:14:33,032 --> 00:14:38,255
[SPEAKER_06]: I would ask that you maintain an air of decorum as we go about today's business.

138
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:45,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Please allow me to introduce you to a group of legislators that has joined us for this morning's conversation.

139
00:14:47,848 --> 00:14:49,889
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to start on my left, your right.

140
00:14:51,530 --> 00:15:00,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Last but certainly not least on this end of the room, or first but certainly not least, is Sean Gabali, a state representative.

141
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:03,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

142
00:15:05,712 --> 00:15:14,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Sitting next to Shawn is our superintendent of Medford Public Schools, appointed, not elected, Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent.

143
00:15:16,676 --> 00:15:20,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Sitting next to her is Isaac Zach Beers.

144
00:15:23,678 --> 00:15:28,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Sitting next to Zach is the vice chair of the school committee, Jenny Graham.

145
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,061
[SPEAKER_06]: The school committee member, Melanie McLaughlin.

146
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:38,284
[SPEAKER_06]: The Mayor of Medford, Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn.

147
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:46,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, and then to my right, beginning, is Paul Russo, the Secretary of the School Committee.

148
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:51,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Rick Caraviello of the City Council.

149
00:15:55,175 --> 00:15:58,618
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Nicole Morel, who's the President of the City Council.

150
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,261
[SPEAKER_06]: City Councilor Justin Tseng.

151
00:16:06,087 --> 00:16:07,388
[SPEAKER_06]: School committee person.

152
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:09,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry.

153
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,292
[SPEAKER_06]: City Council.

154
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:14,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, excuse me, not on my list.

155
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:16,856
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, excuse me.

156
00:16:17,596 --> 00:16:20,259
[SPEAKER_06]: City Councilor Kate Collins.

157
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:21,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Kate Collins, excuse me.

158
00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:26,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me for that faux pas.

159
00:16:26,864 --> 00:16:28,965
[SPEAKER_06]: State Representative Paul Donato.

160
00:16:31,868 --> 00:16:33,429
[SPEAKER_06]: And Senator Pat Jalen.

161
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:50,085
[SPEAKER_06]: So, as has mostly been my custom in getting conversations about neighborhoods started, I'd like to first offer a bit of poetry.

162
00:16:50,185 --> 00:16:57,229
[SPEAKER_06]: April is usually the time of year in Medford when hearts and minds turn toward the blessings of spring.

163
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,382
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's also National Poetry Month.

164
00:17:01,102 --> 00:17:10,689
[SPEAKER_06]: So as we gather together in this community space, indulge your poet laureate as I read, Let Medford Be a Blessing.

165
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:19,210
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't come for the civics lesson or ask this poet to teach the session.

166
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:23,833
[SPEAKER_06]: And yet, the Bard is honor-bound to spread this gospel all around.

167
00:17:23,913 --> 00:17:28,656
[SPEAKER_06]: To all who hear these words today, I'm offering this winning play.

168
00:17:29,137 --> 00:17:33,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Beyond mere pomp and window dressing, I say, let Medford be a blessing.

169
00:17:34,981 --> 00:17:39,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Politics as a context sport shouldn't be the last report.

170
00:17:39,384 --> 00:17:44,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Though we may scuffle like cats and dogs, the wheel must spin with many cogs.

171
00:17:44,768 --> 00:17:47,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Forgiveness is a fruit of the spirit.

172
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:50,251
[SPEAKER_06]: We must be able to grin and bear it.

173
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:52,513
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the stuff of neighborhood.

174
00:17:52,953 --> 00:17:55,054
[SPEAKER_06]: We come together for common good.

175
00:17:55,575 --> 00:18:00,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Strident voices will raise alarm, decrying the town's historic charm.

176
00:18:00,718 --> 00:18:05,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Let not dissension be the farm where anger sows the seeds of harm.

177
00:18:06,222 --> 00:18:11,145
[SPEAKER_06]: In new opinion, in fresh insight, we gain new vision to make things right.

178
00:18:11,685 --> 00:18:13,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's make a list and check it twice.

179
00:18:14,047 --> 00:18:16,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Respect for all will blend the spice.

180
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Respect for the old as well as the new.

181
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Respect for the red, the white, and the blue.

182
00:18:21,832 --> 00:18:24,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Respect for the tried, the tested, the true.

183
00:18:24,414 --> 00:18:26,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Respect for the path of your neighbor's shoe.

184
00:18:26,957 --> 00:18:45,454
[SPEAKER_06]: A divide and conquer mentality can never lead to community, can never sponsor equality, can never rejoice in diversity, can never host creativity, can never buy universality, can never delight in veracity, is never a righteous reality.

185
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:52,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's meet where streams of hope converge and move beyond the spiteful urge.

186
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:54,860
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not the road where we should merge.

187
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,381
[SPEAKER_06]: It only leads the vein to purge.

188
00:18:57,701 --> 00:18:59,903
[SPEAKER_06]: It only fuels pandemic surge.

189
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:12,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's be that bright and shining town where good folks gather from all around, who don't build fences to keep folks out, who don't fill children with constant doubt.

190
00:19:12,545 --> 00:19:17,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Despite the season of COVID we're in, we haven't let viral exposure win.

191
00:19:18,027 --> 00:19:20,228
[SPEAKER_06]: We've worn our masks and taken our shots.

192
00:19:20,628 --> 00:19:23,289
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't come down with scales and green spots.

193
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:32,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Within our fractured history remains a shroud of mystery, and so we seek to bear the truth beyond our own confessional booth.

194
00:19:32,746 --> 00:19:39,889
[SPEAKER_06]: We stand on shoulders of our best, the ones who mastered every test, black and white and tan and brown.

195
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:43,450
[SPEAKER_06]: who push to build this wondrous town.

196
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,090
[SPEAKER_06]: We hold their stories close and dear.

197
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,491
[SPEAKER_06]: They salt and seed our atmosphere.

198
00:19:48,551 --> 00:19:54,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Tales of courage and wisdom abound, which make our commons hallowed ground.

199
00:19:54,532 --> 00:20:02,934
[SPEAKER_06]: We battle against the enemy that looks to bring adversity, that looks to turn our hearts away from kindred ties that rule the day.

200
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:08,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Such is the call to a city soul, the road that leads to a common goal.

201
00:20:08,676 --> 00:20:14,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Such is the nature of clasping hands that move in concert as faith demands.

202
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:25,504
[SPEAKER_06]: We've overcome such pain and grief, but try to hold to our belief that standing at the edge of night is promise in God's perfect light.

203
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:28,566
[SPEAKER_06]: We honor our heroes with tempered pride.

204
00:20:29,126 --> 00:20:31,188
[SPEAKER_06]: We never toss the struggling aside.

205
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:35,892
[SPEAKER_06]: We recognize that rising tides lift the ships where freedom rides.

206
00:20:36,572 --> 00:20:38,454
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not parades that make us great.

207
00:20:38,794 --> 00:20:41,196
[SPEAKER_06]: It's making room for the lost and the late.

208
00:20:41,556 --> 00:20:46,760
[SPEAKER_06]: We build our legacy out of the past to godly acts we cling to fast.

209
00:20:47,421 --> 00:20:52,484
[SPEAKER_06]: To all four winds the dross we cast, remembering to lift the last.

210
00:20:53,345 --> 00:20:57,609
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we get to that promised place where all may share abundant grace?

211
00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:03,374
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we break down rough-hewn walls to reach that land where challenge falls?

212
00:21:04,015 --> 00:21:06,237
[SPEAKER_06]: What do our differences amplify?

213
00:21:06,617 --> 00:21:09,599
[SPEAKER_06]: How can diversity multiply?

214
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,204
[SPEAKER_06]: The cultural soup we want to try, the blended family's strong reply.

215
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,792
[SPEAKER_06]: We sit and talk to make things right.

216
00:21:19,253 --> 00:21:21,975
[SPEAKER_06]: We work out issues in plain sight.

217
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,637
[SPEAKER_06]: We build consensus day and night.

218
00:21:24,937 --> 00:21:27,800
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't make war to show our might.

219
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,622
[SPEAKER_06]: We share a meal to ease our fears.

220
00:21:31,022 --> 00:21:33,204
[SPEAKER_06]: We welcome folks with new ideas.

221
00:21:33,564 --> 00:21:36,167
[SPEAKER_06]: We find the laughter that always endears.

222
00:21:36,207 --> 00:21:39,109
[SPEAKER_06]: We offer shoulders to capture our tears.

223
00:21:39,649 --> 00:21:42,051
[SPEAKER_06]: We smile when human contact nears.

224
00:21:43,032 --> 00:21:52,295
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the strength of community, where neighbors strive for dignity, where diverse people share a bond that ignorance may frown upon.

225
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:57,816
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the goal of the fair and the just, to break down walls and build up trust.

226
00:21:58,376 --> 00:22:00,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Who can dispute such fellowship?

227
00:22:00,997 --> 00:22:03,498
[SPEAKER_06]: We cling now to this noble grip.

228
00:22:04,401 --> 00:22:09,504
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll work to ease our fear of strangers and not advance new trials or dangers.

229
00:22:09,984 --> 00:22:14,948
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll strive to make our city's crest always stand for Medford's best.

230
00:22:15,588 --> 00:22:17,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Here is our hand of strength extended.

231
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,831
[SPEAKER_06]: We won't let friendship be upended.

232
00:22:21,351 --> 00:22:23,233
[SPEAKER_06]: All of our people must be protected.

233
00:22:23,753 --> 00:22:26,415
[SPEAKER_06]: No one here should feel neglected.

234
00:22:27,307 --> 00:22:29,408
[SPEAKER_06]: We vote to achieve our common goals.

235
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:32,049
[SPEAKER_06]: We meet each other at the polls.

236
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:34,610
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't make rules to eliminate.

237
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,451
[SPEAKER_06]: We move real equity into the slate.

238
00:22:38,151 --> 00:22:40,232
[SPEAKER_06]: We show respect and minimize doubt.

239
00:22:40,272 --> 00:22:43,053
[SPEAKER_06]: We flow from a wide and open spout.

240
00:22:43,473 --> 00:22:49,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Let leadership speak to a brave new vision that answers to all without derision.

241
00:22:49,575 --> 00:22:54,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Let public officials carry the weight of promoting peace and reducing hate.

242
00:22:55,801 --> 00:23:01,345
[SPEAKER_06]: At the end of the day, we're all we have to bind our wounds with Gilead's salve.

243
00:23:01,905 --> 00:23:14,453
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we measure each sunrise as ample chance to strategize, as ample chance to grow more wise, as ample chance to empathize, as ample chance to change the lies

244
00:23:14,953 --> 00:23:17,795
[SPEAKER_06]: as ample chance to grow our ties.

245
00:23:18,515 --> 00:23:23,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Let us lift as we climb to greater heights and strive to eliminate petty fights.

246
00:23:24,058 --> 00:23:29,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Let us look to the heavens as God reveals the fortune that our strife conceals.

247
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:32,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Our grasp propels extended reach.

248
00:23:33,002 --> 00:23:35,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's always endeavor to rightly teach.

249
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's always practice what we preach.

250
00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:41,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's follow our leaders into the breach.

251
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:46,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see the lines before we cross, embrace the gain and cut the loss.

252
00:23:47,152 --> 00:23:52,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine is a message of healing first, the blessing that quenches every thirst.

253
00:23:52,195 --> 00:23:57,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine is a letter to Medford's soul, preaching for a unified goal.

254
00:23:58,097 --> 00:24:03,240
[SPEAKER_06]: We've seen disease and rage provoke some ignorance as wisdom spoke.

255
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:12,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Now is the season for love and peace to lose our hearts and reason for love and peace to lose our hearts and regrets.

256
00:24:13,605 --> 00:24:15,807
[SPEAKER_06]: So now you've had the civics lesson.

257
00:24:16,407 --> 00:24:24,873
[SPEAKER_06]: The poet yet must ask the question, for still this bard is honor bound to show good proof that words resound.

258
00:24:25,393 --> 00:24:31,257
[SPEAKER_06]: To all who hear this ode today, we clasp our hands and yes, we pray.

259
00:24:31,897 --> 00:24:34,299
[SPEAKER_06]: A single hope we're all confessing.

260
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:37,901
[SPEAKER_06]: We shout, let Medford be a blessing.

261
00:24:38,322 --> 00:24:42,164
[SPEAKER_06]: We shout, let Medford be a blessing.

262
00:24:42,184 --> 00:24:43,185
[SPEAKER_06]: All righty.

263
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,646
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's see how we do.

264
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:06,308
[SPEAKER_06]: He sees rear access walkway project.

265
00:25:14,351 --> 00:25:15,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, everybody.

266
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:18,580
[SPEAKER_01]: It is great to be here with all of you.

267
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,162
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish you and your family a wonderful start of spring.

268
00:25:21,222 --> 00:25:23,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully it'll warm up soon.

269
00:25:24,464 --> 00:25:32,148
[SPEAKER_01]: So Senator Jalen and I have been working on this for longer than we should have had to work on it.

270
00:25:33,249 --> 00:25:37,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Rachel Tanner came to me over five years ago, as did Reggie.

271
00:25:37,931 --> 00:25:38,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's Reggie?

272
00:25:38,632 --> 00:25:39,152
[SPEAKER_01]: He was here.

273
00:25:39,292 --> 00:25:39,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Reggie.

274
00:25:40,613 --> 00:25:44,135
[SPEAKER_01]: About trying to get a walkway, just a simple walkway to the road.

275
00:25:45,005 --> 00:25:52,891
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, because there's grass out there and in the winter it can be hazard to try to access the West Medford Community Center in the winter.

276
00:25:52,971 --> 00:26:08,121
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been working closely as a delegation with the mayor to try to get money in the budget, in ARPA, and to try to get the Department of Conservation and Recreation to finally allow us to do it.

277
00:26:08,922 --> 00:26:10,783
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have secured around $350,000

278
00:26:13,525 --> 00:26:19,549
[SPEAKER_01]: over the last few years in ARPA and in the general budget to try to make this happen.

279
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:25,393
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will tell you, when we first got this request, I went to the commissioner at the time.

280
00:26:25,453 --> 00:26:28,155
[SPEAKER_01]: The commissioner changes about every six months, unfortunately.

281
00:26:28,195 --> 00:26:32,178
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the time, we went to the commissioner, and the commissioner said, no problem.

282
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:33,659
[SPEAKER_01]: This makes sense.

283
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,041
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do it ASAP.

284
00:26:36,741 --> 00:26:37,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Five years later.

285
00:26:38,893 --> 00:26:39,934
[SPEAKER_01]: That it's still there.

286
00:26:40,014 --> 00:26:41,334
[SPEAKER_01]: So the money has been appropriated.

287
00:26:42,155 --> 00:26:45,156
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking to Reggie upstairs and to the mayor.

288
00:26:45,776 --> 00:26:50,378
[SPEAKER_01]: The state has given the money, part of the money, to the city of Medford.

289
00:26:50,939 --> 00:26:53,020
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's out for bid right now.

290
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,923
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would assume we're going to see progress in the next two or three months.

291
00:27:00,123 --> 00:27:00,903
[SPEAKER_01]: But the money's there.

292
00:27:00,923 --> 00:27:02,804
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been appropriated.

293
00:27:03,024 --> 00:27:04,085
[SPEAKER_01]: The schedule is there.

294
00:27:04,565 --> 00:27:07,947
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we should see progress very, very soon.

295
00:27:09,153 --> 00:27:14,475
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say there will be a new commissioner of DCR announced on Monday.

296
00:27:14,495 --> 00:27:20,157
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the Healey administration has every right to do that, but the money is there.

297
00:27:20,998 --> 00:27:22,799
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can't take the money away.

298
00:27:22,819 --> 00:27:25,920
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been signed into law and the city of Medford has it.

299
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Rachel, I'm looking at you.

300
00:27:28,061 --> 00:27:30,182
[SPEAKER_01]: So I promise we'll get it soon.

301
00:27:30,202 --> 00:27:37,607
[SPEAKER_01]: I will also announce, because it is important, usually this breakfast happens after the House does its budget, not this year.

302
00:27:38,248 --> 00:27:43,631
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had it obviously today, but we're doing the budget in two weeks and the delegation has worked hard.

303
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:48,534
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to file the $50,000 appropriation for the West Medford Community Center.

304
00:27:49,255 --> 00:27:50,996
[SPEAKER_01]: We are able to secure it every year.

305
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:53,358
[SPEAKER_01]: This year should be no different.

306
00:27:53,578 --> 00:27:55,099
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks so much, Senator.

307
00:27:58,425 --> 00:28:00,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, just how can I add to that?

308
00:28:00,766 --> 00:28:06,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say that we have had dozens of DCR commissioners in the last five years.

309
00:28:07,068 --> 00:28:17,132
[SPEAKER_05]: And this commissioner, Doug Rice, cut through, came up here, looked at the situation, and said, the first thing we have to do is clear up between the lawyers.

310
00:28:17,632 --> 00:28:18,432
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's been done.

311
00:28:19,113 --> 00:28:22,654
[SPEAKER_05]: And for five years, we didn't even know what had to be done.

312
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I just thought, you know, put down some stuff.

313
00:28:26,467 --> 00:28:28,988
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that would be simple, but no.

314
00:28:29,449 --> 00:28:43,797
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, I hope the new commissioner's gonna be good, but let me say that I think Doug Rice deserves a great deal of credit, not only here, but on Route 16, farther south.

315
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:47,639
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been really accessible, and I'm very grateful to him.

316
00:28:57,909 --> 00:28:58,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Sean.

317
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Senator Jalen.

318
00:29:00,691 --> 00:29:01,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so.

319
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:25,209
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is an interesting question, and I'm not sure who will want to take a crack at it, but is the zoning board in Medford taking a look at how excessive condominium development is destabilizing the neighborhoods of Medford and accelerating the lack of affordable housing?

320
00:29:27,927 --> 00:29:39,870
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi everybody nice to see you all I know some of you I don't know all of you Hope to know all of you very soon.

321
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:54,314
[SPEAKER_19]: So I can't speak on personal experience to what the Zoning Board of Appeals is doing about Regulating and observing the Development of condos in Medford, but I can't say on the City Council side some action that we are trying to take

322
00:29:55,070 --> 00:30:18,133
[SPEAKER_19]: do what is within our jurisdiction to observe and moderate and regulate the conversion of rental units into condos in Medford because I think especially in this neighborhood it goes without saying what an impact that can have to take rental units off the market and also, you know, these speculative market forces turning neighborhoods into, you know, the commodification of housing.

323
00:30:18,713 --> 00:30:38,133
[SPEAKER_19]: So the city council has begun to look at a condominium conversion ordinance This is something that exists in many similar communities close to us in the region what that does or what it would do what's proposing to do is to put a set of conditions and stipulations on the conversion of certain rentals into condos in Medford and so

324
00:30:38,673 --> 00:30:39,993
[SPEAKER_19]: We're in the really early stages.

325
00:30:40,033 --> 00:31:04,018
[SPEAKER_19]: There's lots of time for community input zba input neighborhood input on How this should be targeted where it should be targeted But the main thrust of that is to say if you are a for-profit developer that's coming in and turning Neighborhood homes, especially rental units into condos that are going to be flipped from which a for-profit developer can derive a lot of value we need to make sure that value is getting put back into the community because of

326
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:22,827
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, it's only fair the developers are making money off of the housing stock and the wonderful neighborhoods and the amenities that we have here in Medford the community needs to be benefiting to maybe that is measures to improve stability for the tenants the residents that are getting displaced because of those conversions in Medford

327
00:31:23,313 --> 00:31:27,356
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe it's an appropriation into our very new affordable housing trust in Medford.

328
00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:31,899
[SPEAKER_19]: That's something on the ordinance side, thanks to the advocates for that, recently passed.

329
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:46,089
[SPEAKER_19]: But that's something that we are looking at and we can hopefully work in tandem with the ZBA to make sure that when condo conversions do occur in Medford, that they're occurring at a pace and in a way that is very careful about the impact on the community.

330
00:31:48,751 --> 00:31:48,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

331
00:31:48,971 --> 00:31:49,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

332
00:31:49,231 --> 00:31:49,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you want to speak?

333
00:31:51,337 --> 00:31:51,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

334
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:52,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

335
00:31:52,338 --> 00:31:52,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

336
00:31:52,758 --> 00:31:53,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

337
00:31:53,659 --> 00:31:54,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

338
00:31:56,841 --> 00:31:57,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

339
00:31:57,241 --> 00:32:14,794
[SPEAKER_06]: So, another question that has arisen is about, and there's a couple of different questions, but one of the questions, and it's, it was asked specifically if Representative Garbali could speak to this.

340
00:32:16,455 --> 00:32:31,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there an awareness amongst your folks that there's been a very serious deterioration in the service of amenities like the ride that the MBTA provides?

341
00:32:32,606 --> 00:32:36,028
[SPEAKER_06]: The ride needs serious oversight and renovation according to some.

342
00:32:39,951 --> 00:32:41,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the question, Eileen.

343
00:32:46,289 --> 00:32:46,593
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.

344
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:55,184
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, you know, Senator Jalen, Representative Donato are here, Representative Barber, wish she could be here, but could not make it.

345
00:32:56,564 --> 00:32:58,425
[SPEAKER_01]: There is absolutely an awareness.

346
00:32:59,326 --> 00:33:07,270
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say there's awareness that the whole system, quality of service, has deteriorated.

347
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:12,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's the commuter rail, the ride, our buses, our trains.

348
00:33:14,373 --> 00:33:17,375
[SPEAKER_01]: The better bus pilot was a disaster.

349
00:33:18,634 --> 00:33:21,098
[SPEAKER_01]: It really was from lack of feedback.

350
00:33:21,578 --> 00:33:25,063
[SPEAKER_01]: The process was botched from the very beginning.

351
00:33:25,724 --> 00:33:31,352
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed like they already had their answer of what they wanted to do, and they just did it.

352
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:39,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, part of it wasn't a complete disaster, because the goal was to support the inner core, the city of Boston.

353
00:33:40,496 --> 00:33:47,942
[SPEAKER_01]: I strongly support giving the city of Boston and the riders and a lot of our gateway communities service.

354
00:33:48,122 --> 00:33:49,723
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's critically important.

355
00:33:50,244 --> 00:33:57,610
[SPEAKER_01]: But it shouldn't be done taking away service from people in Medford, Somerville, Arlington, and Cambridge.

356
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:04,453
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I think many of you know I've been working on public transportation for a long time.

357
00:34:05,934 --> 00:34:15,539
[SPEAKER_01]: I strongly support the idea of reforming the system, but I just want to be very clear, it has to be in conjunction with adequate revenue.

358
00:34:16,359 --> 00:34:20,780
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not fund our transportation system here in Massachusetts appropriately.

359
00:34:21,761 --> 00:34:23,681
[SPEAKER_01]: The communities get assessed, right?

360
00:34:23,721 --> 00:34:25,622
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's an assessment for cities and towns.

361
00:34:26,142 --> 00:34:26,962
[SPEAKER_01]: They pay into it.

362
00:34:27,402 --> 00:34:32,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford pays a considerable amount of assessment, as does Arlington, as does other communities.

363
00:34:33,084 --> 00:34:36,125
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's revenue from the sales tax.

364
00:34:36,945 --> 00:34:43,128
[SPEAKER_01]: But the sales tax underperforms each year and has been doing that for the last two decades.

365
00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:48,551
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is one of the reasons why the T is in terrible shape, not the only reason.

366
00:34:48,571 --> 00:34:52,693
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had really bad leadership at the T for a number of years.

367
00:34:52,794 --> 00:34:58,877
[SPEAKER_01]: So just because I'm saying we need more revenue doesn't excuse their performance.

368
00:34:58,977 --> 00:35:04,320
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean specifically about the ride, it has gotten really bad.

369
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,641
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to do something about it.

370
00:35:08,301 --> 00:35:16,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody should be left for two hours waiting for the ride to pick them up when they've made a previous schedule that the ride would pick them up.

371
00:35:17,443 --> 00:35:18,463
[SPEAKER_01]: That's inexcusable.

372
00:35:20,043 --> 00:35:31,926
[SPEAKER_01]: I have asked that the committee post audit and oversight and the committee on transportation have a hearing to get to the bottom of this and then come up with recommendations on how we can fix it.

373
00:35:33,847 --> 00:35:38,990
[SPEAKER_01]: Positive news is we have a new general manager from New York with a lot of experience.

374
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:47,534
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already talked to him early last week about some of these problems, not the ride directly, but I have sent him a letter.

375
00:35:49,155 --> 00:35:55,339
[SPEAKER_01]: So my hope is, you know, the system's not gonna turn around just like that, right?

376
00:35:55,499 --> 00:35:58,160
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs investment, it needs legislation.

377
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,742
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to hire bus drivers.

378
00:36:01,711 --> 00:36:06,254
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a serious problem, is that we just can't hire bus drivers.

379
00:36:06,294 --> 00:36:09,136
[SPEAKER_01]: But part of that is we don't give them a lot of benefits.

380
00:36:09,176 --> 00:36:10,897
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to increase the benefits.

381
00:36:12,018 --> 00:36:17,521
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're being spit on every day doing your job, you wouldn't want to be a bus driver either.

382
00:36:17,621 --> 00:36:20,143
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to pay them what they're worth.

383
00:36:20,903 --> 00:36:25,026
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's going to be a critical part of transportation reform.

384
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:27,307
[SPEAKER_01]: But my hope is that this session,

385
00:36:28,248 --> 00:36:37,651
[SPEAKER_01]: that we will be taking up a comprehensive piece of legislation to look at governance, funding of the MBTA.

386
00:36:37,731 --> 00:36:46,013
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, I'm not talking about the ride, I'm talking about in general buses.

387
00:36:55,648 --> 00:37:07,054
[SPEAKER_01]: So Eileen what pointed out is the ride, and it wasn't always this case, and I think it has led the deterioration of the quality of the service, is the ride contracts service out for the drivers.

388
00:37:09,376 --> 00:37:11,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just add to what Sean is saying.

389
00:37:11,837 --> 00:37:28,788
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gratified that the Haley administration has taken and found a very, very qualified individual to be the general manager of the T. And it is just discouraging

390
00:37:29,568 --> 00:37:44,591
[SPEAKER_03]: that I recall at one time if somebody, many times people would be calling up and saying my son, my father, my uncle, my cousin would like to be a bus driver and we could not accommodate those individuals.

391
00:37:45,112 --> 00:37:51,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Today we're desperately looking for those who are interested in working in the MBTA.

392
00:37:51,733 --> 00:37:59,317
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you know anyone, let us know because they are desperately looking for bus drivers and people to run the trains.

393
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:16,737
[SPEAKER_03]: The other good news that I think that you should at least be aware of is that when the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts voted for the millionaires tax, a portion of that money that comes in is going to be for transportation.

394
00:38:17,398 --> 00:38:22,440
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are encouraged, and I know that it is the speaker's priority,

395
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:36,550
[SPEAKER_03]: and the legislative priority to make sure that those dollars go into transportation and we fund the proper departments to make sure that we are getting the kind of service that we deserve.

396
00:38:39,292 --> 00:38:39,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

397
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Paul.

398
00:38:41,126 --> 00:38:48,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Mom and Terry, and by name there's a person by the name of Nicole Shuler, and didn't mind having her name being given.

399
00:38:49,554 --> 00:38:55,179
[SPEAKER_06]: She lives in the Hillside neighborhood and has a six-year-old daughter who attends the Missituk Elementary School.

400
00:38:55,719 --> 00:39:03,547
[SPEAKER_06]: She's part of the leadership team for the local Moms Demand Action Group, which is a national grassroots organization for gun violence prevention.

401
00:39:04,989 --> 00:39:34,075
[SPEAKER_06]: uh... their local group formed about a year ago and they've been working with the school city and state officials on gun violence prevention and gun safety awareness and she just wants to sincerely thank those who have supported their efforts so far and express constituents of uh... the areas and make it so that we can continue to have affordable transportation and transportation that's convenient to all of the people in the uh... in the area and uh... so when

402
00:39:35,233 --> 00:39:39,134
[SPEAKER_03]: We agree that maintenance has always taken a back seat.

403
00:39:40,055 --> 00:39:59,262
[SPEAKER_03]: And although we have at the legislative level for a number of years provided additional funds for general maintenance, it seems that those funds unfortunately aren't enough to take care of all of the maintenance needs that has to be done.

404
00:39:59,362 --> 00:40:01,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that the mayor is working with the

405
00:40:02,824 --> 00:40:21,178
[SPEAKER_03]: with the T, with regard to a new maintenance facility at the Wellington area, and to try to accommodate additional maintenance facilities that are going to make it so that the type of transportation that we have is not only affordable, but working in the interest of the public.

406
00:40:21,198 --> 00:40:26,442
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to say, I agree with everything that Rep Donato has said, but I will never

407
00:40:34,033 --> 00:40:51,410
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'll just add, on the state level, I've been getting pretty involved in the transportation arena, but there is a capital improvement proposal, billion dollar capital improvement proposal, so we will, as a city, publicize that, because they're gonna take public comment.

408
00:40:51,732 --> 00:40:54,033
[SPEAKER_23]: And they're going to vote on that, they say in May.

409
00:40:54,153 --> 00:40:56,714
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know if that will lead to June, but I believe May.

410
00:40:56,734 --> 00:40:57,994
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know if anybody wants to correct me.

411
00:40:59,174 --> 00:41:09,418
[SPEAKER_23]: So that is obviously we're focusing on continuing to extend transportation, but also the state is hoping to improve through that capital improvement plan.

412
00:41:10,307 --> 00:41:13,988
[SPEAKER_23]: And myself as mayor, I know the better bus network.

413
00:41:14,368 --> 00:41:17,889
[SPEAKER_23]: We've lost a number of stops.

414
00:41:17,989 --> 00:41:21,370
[SPEAKER_23]: We lost the 94, the 80, the 710.

415
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:25,771
[SPEAKER_23]: So I know our director of transportation, myself, the city council.

416
00:41:25,791 --> 00:41:29,892
[SPEAKER_20]: Design proposals to update them, make them more ADA compliant, easier to access.

417
00:41:29,912 --> 00:41:32,932
[SPEAKER_20]: So maybe some slight moving, some changes to the sidewalk, things like that.

418
00:41:33,412 --> 00:41:38,514
[SPEAKER_20]: They're coming back April 25th because we didn't have a ton of, there wasn't a ton of notice about it.

419
00:41:38,554 --> 00:41:40,034
[SPEAKER_20]: We didn't have any public participation.

420
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:48,636
[SPEAKER_20]: So April 25th, if you have strong opinions about certain stops, we can make sure we get the content they gave us on the website so people can see what the proposals are.

421
00:41:49,296 --> 00:41:53,279
[SPEAKER_20]: This isn't the team that's doing the Better Bus project, but they do answer the emails.

422
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:57,342
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's not a bad time, too, that we'll actually have the MBTA in the room.

423
00:41:57,703 --> 00:42:03,567
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, it's not exactly the same people, but it's not a bad idea for them to take the opportunity to speak at that meeting.

424
00:42:03,627 --> 00:42:09,191
[SPEAKER_20]: So April 25th, they will be back, and there's an opportunity to weigh in on some improvements, ideally.

425
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:12,482
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

426
00:42:15,163 --> 00:42:20,484
[SPEAKER_12]: During the time we have our state delegation here, one of my concerns is our West Medford train station over here.

427
00:42:21,244 --> 00:42:22,704
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not ADA compliance.

428
00:42:23,445 --> 00:42:30,306
[SPEAKER_12]: And our neighboring city, Winchester, has had both of their stations both been renovated and they're both brand new.

429
00:42:30,886 --> 00:42:37,728
[SPEAKER_12]: When are we going to see some type of investments in the West Medford station, which is long overdue and neglected?

430
00:42:42,323 --> 00:42:42,724
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

431
00:42:42,744 --> 00:42:47,418
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that's a really good and important point on the ADA compliance and it's something that

432
00:42:48,247 --> 00:42:53,469
[SPEAKER_21]: The city overall needs to really consider because we have lots of ADA noncompliance in our city.

433
00:42:54,069 --> 00:43:04,792
[SPEAKER_21]: And particularly we're concerned about some of the schools, particularly access to the schools, curb cuts, all sorts of things that disabled parking, all sorts of things that are issues.

434
00:43:04,852 --> 00:43:13,935
[SPEAKER_21]: So we do have a disability sort of ADA committee at the school level where we're talking about some of these things and really trying to get some things in motion.

435
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:24,053
[SPEAKER_21]: The more people that can coalesce around this issue, the better, because as you all know, the more voices, the more people listen, and this is a really important cause across the city.

436
00:43:24,113 --> 00:43:30,615
[SPEAKER_21]: I see far too many people that are not able to access our city, and if we want equity, we really need to ensure access.

437
00:43:30,895 --> 00:43:31,155
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks.

438
00:43:32,816 --> 00:43:33,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

439
00:43:33,656 --> 00:43:35,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

440
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:44,739
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so, and, you know, I'm sure there'd be more than a few folks who would like to weigh in on this question.

441
00:43:44,819 --> 00:43:56,169
[SPEAKER_06]: How can Medford do more to prepare for the aging of its current population in the areas of housing, food security, healthcare, and economic assistance?

442
00:44:01,568 --> 00:44:04,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's just a little question.

443
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:07,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Zach, please.

444
00:44:10,013 --> 00:44:10,594
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everybody.

445
00:44:11,114 --> 00:44:15,917
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing I want to say is happy Easter, happy Passover, and Ramadan as well.

446
00:44:18,018 --> 00:44:28,224
[SPEAKER_00]: When we have a concurrence like that, I think it shows us that maybe we believe slightly different things, but we're all moving towards the same goal.

447
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:38,969
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also just want to take a moment in that spirit to just think about all the people who want to be welcomed and accepted who maybe aren't finding that right now here in Medford or anywhere in our country.

448
00:44:41,312 --> 00:44:47,378
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question of aging, it's a big deal on all of those points.

449
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:51,603
[SPEAKER_00]: One suggestion I've heard about the ride, to go back to Eileen's question, is maybe

450
00:44:52,683 --> 00:44:55,705
[SPEAKER_00]: the ride shouldn't be part of the MBTA, it should be part of elder services.

451
00:44:56,485 --> 00:45:07,030
[SPEAKER_00]: And not to say that it only serves elderly people, but that may be a different view at it where it's not just one small piece of a large system, but really a direct focus on that might be an approach.

452
00:45:08,811 --> 00:45:21,598
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we talk about what the city can do on the question of aging, or the question of ADA access, or the question of sidewalks and potholes and housing affordability, or really anything else, you know, something I think

453
00:45:22,866 --> 00:45:30,392
[SPEAKER_00]: probably everyone up here is pretty much willing to say, at least at some point, is that it really is a question of a budget and revenue and money.

454
00:45:31,953 --> 00:45:44,842
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we want to provide health care access, or we want to provide more senior housing, or we want to provide better paratransit, or we want to provide food assistance, or classes for folks, or programming for seniors,

455
00:45:46,003 --> 00:45:46,883
[SPEAKER_00]: We need money to do that.

456
00:45:48,284 --> 00:45:50,024
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't have the money to do that right now.

457
00:45:50,124 --> 00:45:59,367
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about this question of aging and the aging that we're going to see in this city and in our state over the next 10, 15, 20 years, we're not prepared for it.

458
00:46:00,148 --> 00:46:02,168
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to be a Debbie Downer.

459
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:12,131
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you may watch city council meetings or you may see me and I sound like a broken record because I'm just talking about the budget and money and our needs to be prepared for these things all the time.

460
00:46:12,431 --> 00:46:13,552
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very important.

461
00:46:14,672 --> 00:46:18,774
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at the end of the day, that's the main thing that a city government or a state government does.

462
00:46:19,034 --> 00:46:23,777
[SPEAKER_00]: It allocates funding collectively to advocate for our needs.

463
00:46:23,857 --> 00:46:24,617
[SPEAKER_00]: I see your hand, Roberta.

464
00:46:24,637 --> 00:46:25,978
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to finish and then I'll go to you.

465
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:30,020
[SPEAKER_00]: But so that to me really is the question.

466
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,562
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we all admit that we don't have the money that we need to provide basic services.

467
00:46:34,462 --> 00:46:54,891
[SPEAKER_00]: Until we're willing to have that conversation and really think about the different tools that we need to change that We're going to be working around the edges on these questions And that doesn't really help people a lot of people are hurt by that quite frankly so something that I'm I'm really hopeful and that the City Council is working on very strongly is working on a

468
00:46:55,571 --> 00:47:18,269
[SPEAKER_00]: a budget ordinance which can better assess, show the public this is exactly what our budget process is, these are the steps to be involved, work on making that process more transparent, accessible, and bringing the community in so that we can have the values like this question about how we're gonna address the aging in our community and what resources we can bring to bear to that question in our budget.

469
00:47:19,745 --> 00:47:22,226
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm working on with my colleagues on the city council.

470
00:47:22,246 --> 00:47:25,028
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all seven of us are passionate and committed to work on that.

471
00:47:25,068 --> 00:47:27,929
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been working on that with members of the mayor's administration as well.

472
00:47:28,549 --> 00:47:38,534
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if we can really get a handle around the core issue here, which is we don't have the revenue to provide these services and to address the needs of our community and the problems that we face.

473
00:47:39,475 --> 00:47:46,158
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can get our hands around that problem and come together around solutions and use every tool in our toolbox to fix it, I think we'll be in a much better place.

474
00:47:47,038 --> 00:47:54,703
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a direct answer just to this question, because I think this question is really interlinked with so many of the other policy questions and work that we need to do as a city government.

475
00:47:55,743 --> 00:47:56,824
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's three questions.

476
00:47:56,924 --> 00:47:59,385
[SPEAKER_00]: So Roberta, Matt, and then Eileen.

477
00:47:59,405 --> 00:48:14,634
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just going to ask, could we prepare for this by preparing an age-friendly community plan for Medford, so that when those resources, those opportunities pop up, we know exactly what we want to do, and we can grab them and be able to implement them?

478
00:48:16,134 --> 00:48:23,138
[SPEAKER_17]: So like preparation is planning, and we can plan without having the money already in place to be able to implement it.

479
00:48:23,178 --> 00:48:24,779
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I think that's a great idea.

480
00:48:24,799 --> 00:48:28,561
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have a lot of plans right now that we don't have the money to fulfill.

481
00:48:28,902 --> 00:48:37,106
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have a problem adding another plan to the list, but it comes back around to we can have a lot of plans on the shelf, but if we don't have the money to implement them.

482
00:48:37,186 --> 00:48:38,527
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not disagreeing with your point.

483
00:48:38,547 --> 00:48:39,548
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be a great idea.

484
00:48:40,957 --> 00:48:41,157
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt.

485
00:49:10,457 --> 00:49:13,299
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of ideas being thrown around to answer the substance of your question.

486
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:14,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a long-term plan?

487
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:37,393
[SPEAKER_00]: No Yeah, I mean there's work that we're doing I mean we passed a zoning change that we have planned development districts There are projects that are coming in or they're definitely gonna help the city and bring more revenue to the city, but it's piecemeal it's ad hoc and and I think the question is if you can build a really open and transparent process where you can involve people and put a plan to paper and

488
00:49:38,365 --> 00:49:45,767
[SPEAKER_00]: Then have goals and benchmarks where you're leading towards what your needs are and meet, you know Having the revenue to meet those needs.

489
00:49:46,907 --> 00:49:51,929
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really the the golden goose on how we can fix this Eileen I

490
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,961
[SPEAKER_13]: As Paul told me that money will not be available till next year.

491
00:50:04,581 --> 00:50:12,903
[SPEAKER_13]: But do we have any idea how much money would be coming to the city and, you know, and how it could be used?

492
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:16,143
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a I don't have the answer to that.

493
00:50:16,464 --> 00:50:19,484
[SPEAKER_00]: The state lawmakers are the ones who are appropriating that funding.

494
00:50:20,644 --> 00:50:24,345
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some plans out there from Governor Haley as well, but I can't speak to the details.

495
00:50:24,905 --> 00:50:27,286
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll probably know in late June, early July

496
00:50:27,882 --> 00:50:31,243
[SPEAKER_00]: what the first round looks at once the House and the Senate have agreed on a budget.

497
00:50:31,263 --> 00:50:36,545
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't the state also awash in money?

498
00:50:36,965 --> 00:50:37,605
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they are.

499
00:50:37,745 --> 00:50:40,066
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Senator Jalen thinks that they are.

500
00:50:44,556 --> 00:50:52,220
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they are, and I'm going to get off the totem pole, and I want to hear from Senator Jalen, I would just say we may be in a wash in money right now.

501
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:59,963
[SPEAKER_00]: The long-term fiscal health of the state budget is in a similar situation, quite frankly, to the city, where we've actually had major revenue losses over the last 20 years.

502
00:50:59,983 --> 00:51:06,266
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why DCR has been cut by 35%, and the T's in massive trouble, and public higher education.

503
00:51:07,046 --> 00:51:11,648
[SPEAKER_00]: God, I think anyone who knows anyone going to college knows what the debt burden and the tuition cost looks like there.

504
00:51:11,689 --> 00:51:12,409
[SPEAKER_00]: So the state's not.

505
00:51:13,059 --> 00:51:15,440
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear, oh, we have this surplus, we have this and that.

506
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,481
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the long run, it's in a pretty tight spot as well.

507
00:51:18,501 --> 00:51:19,941
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

508
00:51:20,222 --> 00:51:21,342
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the mayor wanted to go.

509
00:51:23,783 --> 00:51:26,564
[SPEAKER_23]: Senator, do you want to speak?

510
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:28,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm chair of elder affairs.

511
00:51:29,165 --> 00:51:32,746
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was going to first talk about old people.

512
00:51:35,327 --> 00:51:37,568
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope you all get a chance to get old.

513
00:51:38,148 --> 00:51:38,308
[SPEAKER_05]: But.

514
00:51:41,533 --> 00:51:56,662
[SPEAKER_05]: We do need, actually Monday we're having a hearing on three bills that we think because of the speaker's support are gonna strengthen both nursing home accountability and mostly accountability and making it better.

515
00:51:58,162 --> 00:52:00,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Similarly for assisted living, which why don't we have any here?

516
00:52:01,664 --> 00:52:04,046
[SPEAKER_05]: And third, home care.

517
00:52:05,327 --> 00:52:11,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Across the board, there is a shortage of people to take care of people

518
00:52:11,717 --> 00:52:23,241
[SPEAKER_05]: who need help, from the ambulance driver, to the emergency room, to the hospital, to the rehab place, to discharge to a nursing home or home care.

519
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:28,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Every single place is short of workers, and it is costing lives.

520
00:52:28,863 --> 00:52:30,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I am so upset about this.

521
00:52:30,524 --> 00:52:31,184
[SPEAKER_05]: The workforce

522
00:52:32,184 --> 00:52:32,964
[SPEAKER_05]: And why?

523
00:52:33,084 --> 00:52:35,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we aren't paying people enough money.

524
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:39,746
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason is because we live in a state that thinks we're in a state of austerity.

525
00:52:40,106 --> 00:52:40,426
[SPEAKER_05]: We are.

526
00:52:41,067 --> 00:52:44,628
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a lot of money right now because the federal government gave us a lot of money.

527
00:52:45,108 --> 00:52:50,249
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a situation last year that brought in more money from some, do I understand it?

528
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:54,650
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but from pass through entities that will not be here this year.

529
00:52:55,351 --> 00:52:58,871
[SPEAKER_05]: And do you think we will ever have a recession in the future?

530
00:52:59,832 --> 00:53:00,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Just asking.

531
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:06,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Because every time we have a lot of money, we cut taxes.

532
00:53:06,733 --> 00:53:10,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time we don't have a lot of money, we cut services.

533
00:53:10,836 --> 00:53:12,457
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've talked about transit.

534
00:53:13,217 --> 00:53:19,621
[SPEAKER_05]: There was just a poll that said, do you prefer cutting taxes or increasing spending?

535
00:53:19,741 --> 00:53:24,564
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard people here talking about needs for transit, for housing,

536
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:31,161
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to talk about people needing to be paid enough to work.

537
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:41,964
[SPEAKER_05]: So people make no connection, none, between the money they pay the state and the things they want from the state.

538
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:51,766
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now we're being asked to cut another, we just added a billion dollars to the future, which people pointed out from the fair share.

539
00:53:51,946 --> 00:53:55,667
[SPEAKER_05]: That took seven years and hundreds of thousands of people working really hard.

540
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:00,928
[SPEAKER_05]: We have on the table a proposal for a billion dollars in tax cuts.

541
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:03,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of it is good.

542
00:54:05,029 --> 00:54:10,170
[SPEAKER_05]: And about, what, a quarter to a third of it goes to the wealthiest people in the state.

543
00:54:13,971 --> 00:54:15,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's what I'm worried about.

544
00:54:15,372 --> 00:54:22,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Senators and Gentlemen.

545
00:54:23,514 --> 00:54:26,395
[SPEAKER_05]: This state really limits what's

546
00:54:27,318 --> 00:54:34,100
[SPEAKER_23]: not only just all of us, but the employees we have at City Hall, our directors and our boards and commissions.

547
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:41,361
[SPEAKER_23]: I see some, you know, Reggie from the Park Board and Roberta from CPC, Laurel from Charter Review.

548
00:54:41,741 --> 00:54:46,202
[SPEAKER_23]: We are doing some amazing work in the city and on all levels.

549
00:54:46,703 --> 00:54:51,204
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's because of the team that we put together and it's all the people that volunteer.

550
00:54:51,344 --> 00:54:57,005
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, when we hit, when COVID hit, we put together a team and we handled

551
00:54:57,549 --> 00:55:06,974
[SPEAKER_23]: Tackled the food insecurity that was going on at the time and we continue to do so rep barber who couldn't make it today Was able to get us a large grant for our mystic market.

552
00:55:07,334 --> 00:55:22,962
[SPEAKER_23]: We are looking for a new home for them There is just constant ever-changing things going on We have three 40 B projects that we are negotiating one is going to be 350 units on mystic Valley Parkway right behind Wegman's that's going to be count

553
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:29,884
[SPEAKER_23]: as those 350 will count as within our 10% affordable housing stock, 25% will be affordable housing.

554
00:55:30,364 --> 00:55:37,188
[SPEAKER_23]: We are working tirelessly to, in the planning department alone, we've doubled the staff in our planning department.

555
00:55:37,248 --> 00:55:41,411
[SPEAKER_23]: We now have a new CPC, CPA manager that will start soon.

556
00:55:41,451 --> 00:55:52,818
[SPEAKER_23]: We have a staff planner that's new, a housing planner that is posted, and an economic development director position that we are currently interviewing for.

557
00:55:53,387 --> 00:56:04,517
[SPEAKER_23]: And through Victor's work, who was our prior economic development director, we have 40 plus projects in the pipeline that, Matt, to your question, one source of revenue is a new growth.

558
00:56:04,998 --> 00:56:10,383
[SPEAKER_23]: And our new growth is only moving up, thankfully, because we need it for budgetary purposes.

559
00:56:10,883 --> 00:56:17,209
[SPEAKER_23]: But the city's continuing to tackle every issue we have on our plate, and that's not just because of me, that's because of the team here.

560
00:56:17,639 --> 00:56:20,061
[SPEAKER_23]: as well as the team at City Hall and our wonderful volunteers.

561
00:56:20,121 --> 00:56:29,329
[SPEAKER_23]: So I just wanted to let you know we do press releases weekly on all the good things we have going on, grants that we're providing to businesses, and the list goes on.

562
00:56:29,449 --> 00:56:29,890
[SPEAKER_23]: So thank you.

563
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:30,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

564
00:56:30,871 --> 00:56:31,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mayor.

565
00:56:32,512 --> 00:56:32,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, please.

566
00:56:34,335 --> 00:56:40,940
[SPEAKER_21]: I also just wanted to mention the intersectionality, right, of aging and disability, right?

567
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:46,464
[SPEAKER_21]: And so you heard Senator Jalen say, maybe we'll all be lucky enough to get older someday.

568
00:56:46,985 --> 00:56:49,807
[SPEAKER_21]: And with that getting older, usually comes disability.

569
00:56:50,227 --> 00:56:52,869
[SPEAKER_21]: And so getting back to the ADA point, when we're talking about

570
00:56:53,256 --> 00:56:57,817
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, accessibility, it is elderly, it is individuals with disabilities, it's across the city.

571
00:56:58,197 --> 00:57:03,318
[SPEAKER_21]: And some things are about money and some things are about priorities, but some things are also legislated.

572
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:10,060
[SPEAKER_21]: So the Americans with Disabilities Act is a law that requires access when reasonable, when reasonable accommodation.

573
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:19,322
[SPEAKER_21]: So really thinking about how people are coalescing around this, what civic engagement folks can get involved in, whether it's the Disability Commission, whether it's reaching out to us all here,

574
00:57:21,222 --> 00:57:33,449
[SPEAKER_21]: creating groups to talk about how do we move these things forward because we can sit here for two hours and talk about all of this, or we can work together to get some things done and really creating, to Matt's point, some strategies around, okay, what are our goals this year?

575
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:35,370
[SPEAKER_21]: We're not going to tackle it all at once.

576
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:36,291
[SPEAKER_21]: What are our goals this year?

577
00:57:36,331 --> 00:57:38,732
[SPEAKER_21]: Can we pick two goals this year that we want to get done?

578
00:57:38,832 --> 00:57:40,373
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, who wants to work on those two goals?

579
00:57:41,074 --> 00:57:44,636
[SPEAKER_21]: So certainly, one of the things I want to work on is accessibility in the city.

580
00:57:44,856 --> 00:57:50,219
[SPEAKER_21]: So if there's anybody here that wants to work on that, sign me up, I'm working with you, and I think it's a really important cause.

581
00:57:50,769 --> 00:57:52,731
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's about really civic engagement, too.

582
00:57:52,912 --> 00:57:53,232
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

583
00:57:54,994 --> 00:57:55,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Please, Jenny.

584
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:56,996
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't heard from you, so.

585
00:57:59,659 --> 00:58:00,200
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks, Terry.

586
00:58:02,122 --> 00:58:05,346
[SPEAKER_22]: Earlier last year, we applied for a grant through the MSBA to

587
00:58:07,101 --> 00:58:09,022
[SPEAKER_22]: take a look at what needs to happen in Medford High.

588
00:58:09,062 --> 00:58:11,243
[SPEAKER_22]: And when we were here last year, I talked about that.

589
00:58:11,884 --> 00:58:19,608
[SPEAKER_22]: We were advised in December that we did not make the cut this year, but that things look good for next year.

590
00:58:20,008 --> 00:58:25,271
[SPEAKER_22]: At about the same time, I got a refund check from the state.

591
00:58:26,072 --> 00:58:35,277
[SPEAKER_22]: And I thought to myself, 10 schools could have been built with the refunds that went to taxpayers, 10 schools.

592
00:58:35,781 --> 00:58:39,124
[SPEAKER_22]: So 10 communities like Medford are waiting.

593
00:58:40,044 --> 00:58:41,485
[SPEAKER_22]: What happens during that time?

594
00:58:41,906 --> 00:58:47,530
[SPEAKER_22]: It's going to cost us more to build that school next year than it would have this year.

595
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:55,936
[SPEAKER_22]: So if you are able, take that refund check and find a place in Medford that can benefit from the money.

596
00:58:57,377 --> 00:59:01,761
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a small way to try to sort of level the playing field.

597
00:59:02,361 --> 00:59:04,923
[SPEAKER_22]: But we need to stop cutting checks when we can't

598
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,189
[SPEAKER_22]: meet our basic services and needs.

599
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,671
[SPEAKER_22]: Our kids deserve a functioning high school.

600
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:14,956
[SPEAKER_22]: And we're sort of on the brink of that building not being serviceable.

601
00:59:15,717 --> 00:59:17,839
[SPEAKER_22]: And we're going to go at it again with MSBA.

602
00:59:17,859 --> 00:59:23,905
[SPEAKER_22]: I hope the city council will unanimously support that on Tuesday, I think, is your vote.

603
00:59:25,152 --> 00:59:27,334
[SPEAKER_22]: because that support is very necessary.

604
00:59:27,554 --> 00:59:31,776
[SPEAKER_22]: I hope the MSBA will come to the table so that we can get started.

605
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:35,979
[SPEAKER_22]: And if they don't, I hope that the city will say we have to start anyway.

606
00:59:36,459 --> 00:59:43,343
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's an example of how this failure of government lands here in Medford.

607
00:59:43,763 --> 00:59:46,325
[SPEAKER_22]: So we need to be prepared to take action.

608
00:59:47,705 --> 00:59:53,487
[SPEAKER_22]: if the government continues to not be able to provide those services from the federal level, from the state level.

609
00:59:54,107 --> 01:00:00,490
[SPEAKER_22]: Unfortunately, it rests on the feet of the people in front of you, so thank you for your patience.

610
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:08,232
[SPEAKER_22]: We really do need to think carefully about the impact of things like big tax refund checks, and what does that mean we didn't get?

611
01:00:08,412 --> 01:00:09,953
[SPEAKER_22]: What does that mean we didn't spend?

612
01:00:10,513 --> 01:00:11,993
[SPEAKER_22]: Are we okay with that?

613
01:00:12,894 --> 01:00:13,294
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not.

614
01:00:14,374 --> 01:00:16,375
[SPEAKER_22]: So I hope we never cut another refund check.

615
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:26,823
[SPEAKER_22]: until we can fix the MBTA, fix housing instability, fix the chronic aging issues that Pat was talking about, and fix public education.

616
01:00:30,842 --> 01:00:31,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Jenny.

617
01:00:32,082 --> 01:00:33,423
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not all right with it either.

618
01:00:33,683 --> 01:00:35,544
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to repeal that 1980 law.

619
01:00:36,204 --> 01:00:36,904
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt about it.

620
01:00:37,044 --> 01:00:42,266
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to raise, because Melanie brought it up, the issue around disabilities.

621
01:00:42,646 --> 01:00:46,928
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if a lot of people know this in this room, but a recent law was signed

622
01:00:47,308 --> 01:00:49,950
[SPEAKER_01]: a bill that I have been filing for about 10 years.

623
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:58,476
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been working on it to open the doors of public higher education for individuals with autism, Down syndrome, and other disabilities.

624
01:00:58,736 --> 01:01:00,758
[SPEAKER_01]: We finally got it passed.

625
01:01:00,798 --> 01:01:04,120
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the last bill Governor Baker signed into law.

626
01:01:04,721 --> 01:01:12,226
[SPEAKER_01]: So Massachusetts becomes the first state in the country to open all 29 campuses for individuals with autism and Down syndrome.

627
01:01:12,507 --> 01:01:13,627
[SPEAKER_01]: The first in the country.

628
01:01:14,348 --> 01:01:16,790
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just wanted to make sure everyone here knew that.

629
01:01:19,847 --> 01:01:25,211
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna try and leave some time at the end for questions, so if you can just hold your questions, let's get through these.

630
01:01:25,231 --> 01:01:30,836
[SPEAKER_12]: Only with the word old, that's all I wanna say, and then I'll do the questions.

631
01:01:30,996 --> 01:01:31,156
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

632
01:01:31,176 --> 01:01:31,437
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

633
01:01:32,638 --> 01:01:32,958
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

634
01:01:33,258 --> 01:01:37,081
[SPEAKER_12]: So one of the questions I get all the time is senior housing.

635
01:01:38,042 --> 01:01:39,944
[SPEAKER_12]: People are looking for senior housing in the community.

636
01:01:40,904 --> 01:01:41,905
[SPEAKER_12]: We have very little.

637
01:01:42,426 --> 01:01:44,968
[SPEAKER_12]: I know many people in this room own homes.

638
01:01:45,885 --> 01:01:50,791
[SPEAKER_12]: that their seniors, they can't afford to stay, they can't afford to age in the home.

639
01:01:52,392 --> 01:01:54,375
[SPEAKER_12]: Taxes have gone up, cost of living has gone up.

640
01:01:55,015 --> 01:01:58,860
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe they no longer have a spouse that gives them that second income.

641
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:00,301
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're all struggling.

642
01:02:02,023 --> 01:02:11,290
[SPEAKER_12]: What I would like to see going forward is maybe our administration in the council looking at maybe public-private partnerships For assisted living.

643
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:12,751
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we have some space.

644
01:02:12,791 --> 01:02:16,533
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the Property up at the lawn tomorrow.

645
01:02:16,553 --> 01:02:21,557
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll make a great assisted living area up there Maybe we have to work with the Housing Authority.

646
01:02:21,977 --> 01:02:25,419
[SPEAKER_12]: I know this I know they're looking to put but we need more

647
01:02:26,482 --> 01:02:29,323
[SPEAKER_12]: housing for people that are aging in the community.

648
01:02:29,743 --> 01:02:32,845
[SPEAKER_12]: Listen, I'm aging, I know this.

649
01:02:32,865 --> 01:02:39,348
[SPEAKER_12]: But I know many people in this room here, they live in homes that they're struggling to pay for with their taxes and just the upkeep of the home.

650
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:46,951
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd like to see maybe some type of private public partnership with somebody to build senior housing or assisted living.

651
01:02:48,572 --> 01:02:48,832
Thank you.

652
01:02:48,852 --> 01:02:49,192
Thank you.

653
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:50,432
Jane, I'm sorry.

654
01:02:51,313 --> 01:02:55,695
[SPEAKER_02]: You won't expect what's coming out of my mouth, but just think of the word old.

655
01:02:56,790 --> 01:03:02,875
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the hats I've worn in this city is with the Medford Family Network, and I teach nature in the parks.

656
01:03:04,816 --> 01:03:08,039
[SPEAKER_02]: How can you tell the difference between Winchester and Medford?

657
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,362
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stumps, and it's old trees.

658
01:03:13,503 --> 01:03:18,567
[SPEAKER_02]: The value that they do to clean our air is beyond what I can tell you.

659
01:03:19,147 --> 01:03:19,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know it.

660
01:03:21,709 --> 01:03:23,570
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very, very important.

661
01:03:24,131 --> 01:03:25,532
[SPEAKER_02]: And before we change things,

662
01:03:26,321 --> 01:03:36,111
[SPEAKER_02]: look at the old tree that's there and say, it's going to take those little, little trees to grow how many years to help our air.

663
01:03:36,932 --> 01:03:47,743
[SPEAKER_02]: And the love of my life, before Dr. Walker died, said, after you've polluted the last river, try and eat your money in the bank.

664
01:03:49,605 --> 01:03:49,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

665
01:03:53,301 --> 01:04:02,263
[SPEAKER_06]: So, okay, just a few more questions that I wanna get through here, and hopefully there'll still be a little bit of time for a more open forum.

666
01:04:02,283 --> 01:04:04,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

667
01:04:05,064 --> 01:04:10,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the lengthening of the mayoral term for office on the table for discussion?

668
01:04:10,785 --> 01:04:20,607
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems as if the current term assures that a burdensome amount of time is spent on getting elected to the potential detriment of making and implementing city policy.

669
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:26,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a Miss Mayor question?

670
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:28,611
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not going to give my opinion.

671
01:04:29,111 --> 01:04:32,793
[SPEAKER_23]: I think I mentioned in 19 campaign that there should be term limits.

672
01:04:32,853 --> 01:04:37,476
[SPEAKER_23]: So what is important is that four out of seven Councilors voted for charter review.

673
01:04:37,896 --> 01:04:42,099
[SPEAKER_23]: Unfortunately, that's not enough to get through the statehouse.

674
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:47,922
[SPEAKER_23]: So thankfully, we have a number of residents, including our co-chair, who's here today.

675
01:04:48,522 --> 01:04:52,464
[SPEAKER_23]: They're doing diligent work along with the Collins Center.

676
01:04:52,664 --> 01:04:58,466
[SPEAKER_23]: We gave them a good budget to have the Collins Center come to at least 10 meetings to provide support.

677
01:04:58,946 --> 01:05:00,567
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think everything is on the table.

678
01:05:00,727 --> 01:05:02,568
[SPEAKER_23]: There'll be surveys coming out.

679
01:05:02,888 --> 01:05:11,551
[SPEAKER_23]: There'll be community meetings that we hope many, many attend so that we can bring our charter that's decades and decades old.

680
01:05:11,691 --> 01:05:13,012
[SPEAKER_23]: It is a page and a half.

681
01:05:13,472 --> 01:05:15,813
[SPEAKER_23]: It only references he and him.

682
01:05:16,741 --> 01:05:20,924
[SPEAKER_23]: It's time to bring that up to date and I thank our committee for doing that hard work.

683
01:05:21,424 --> 01:05:35,213
[SPEAKER_23]: It's Many meetings every month that they're they're working through and I'm just very thankful that we have such a great committee and the council would love to like to vote over maybe we can Pursue both avenues 7-0 vote would be great.

684
01:05:35,934 --> 01:05:37,315
[SPEAKER_23]: But Laura, I don't know if you want to add anything.

685
01:05:37,335 --> 01:05:37,355
[SPEAKER_23]: I

686
01:05:39,828 --> 01:05:46,680
[SPEAKER_07]: just wanted to add that we will be holding our first public information session on Thursday June 8th at City Hall from 630 to 8 p.m.

687
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:47,000
[SPEAKER_07]: so both yes

688
01:05:57,488 --> 01:05:58,648
[SPEAKER_06]: This is very interesting.

689
01:05:58,728 --> 01:06:07,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Can there be a series of meetings to explain the basics of the city's existing charter and discuss in plain terms what charter review means?

690
01:06:08,495 --> 01:06:09,916
[SPEAKER_06]: When can this start happening?

691
01:06:10,096 --> 01:06:14,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if it is public currently going on, how is it being publicized?

692
01:06:17,181 --> 01:06:18,001
[SPEAKER_23]: The committee worked

693
01:06:19,745 --> 01:06:29,390
[SPEAKER_23]: very hard on basic question and answer document that will be publicized very soon, along with the series of dates and times for public meetings and the survey that will come out.

694
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:47,558
[SPEAKER_23]: So, charter review is very difficult to understand, so we brought it down to grade level terms, so everybody would be able, and that's actually how I understand it best anyway, so everybody will be able to understand what that means, what changes we could possibly make, how to make those changes, although it takes

695
01:06:48,298 --> 01:07:00,650
[SPEAKER_23]: Some great deal of time, but we are we're doing all we can to get resident involvement and make sure everybody understands the process Thank you very much Okay So

696
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:04,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

697
01:07:09,502 --> 01:07:19,349
[SPEAKER_10]: The Medford Charter Study Committee meetings are open to the public, and we do allow public comment at the end of each one of our meetings.

698
01:07:19,389 --> 01:07:21,791
[SPEAKER_10]: So anybody is free to attend those.

699
01:07:21,851 --> 01:07:24,513
[SPEAKER_10]: They're virtual if they want to.

700
01:07:24,533 --> 01:07:25,113
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

701
01:07:25,193 --> 01:07:30,357
[SPEAKER_06]: And how do the citizens get to know about when those meetings are taking place?

702
01:07:31,058 --> 01:07:35,062
[SPEAKER_10]: It should it should be on the Medford public website website.

703
01:07:35,082 --> 01:07:54,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and if Laura if you want it So, yes, we do have a page on the city's website for the Charter Study Committee Our meetings are on the first Thursday of the month currently and they are on zoom right now and also, all of our meetings are published on the city calendar and

704
01:07:54,698 --> 01:07:54,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

705
01:07:55,138 --> 01:07:55,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

706
01:07:55,598 --> 01:07:56,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

707
01:07:57,519 --> 01:07:58,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

708
01:07:59,279 --> 01:07:59,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

709
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:12,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Diversifying the workforce, especially the fire department, the police department, and the school system, teachers in particular, what new initiatives are planned or currently underway?

710
01:08:21,463 --> 01:08:22,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Good morning, everyone.

711
01:08:23,598 --> 01:08:25,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I've been listening.

712
01:08:25,599 --> 01:08:33,202
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been such a rich conversation this morning, and thank you again, Terry, for your wonderful poem this morning.

713
01:08:33,962 --> 01:08:38,724
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of diversifying the school force, we are making a concerted effort.

714
01:08:38,984 --> 01:08:49,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Every time we publicize and advertise jobs, not only do we do it on the district school website, but we also use NEMNET, which is another organization,

715
01:08:50,608 --> 01:09:00,357
[SPEAKER_08]: where candidates of color, they could be from other states, also have access to jobs that are posted just to see if there's interest.

716
01:09:00,977 --> 01:09:06,342
[SPEAKER_08]: And most recently we are working collaboratively with a few of our neighboring districts.

717
01:09:07,663 --> 01:09:12,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Chelsea, Everett, Malden, Revere, there's going to be a

718
01:09:13,148 --> 01:09:26,548
[SPEAKER_08]: upcoming job fair April 26 so we're working with five other communities and Medford will be represented at that one to see if that will increase our chances of having other candidates

719
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:44,893
[SPEAKER_08]: participate so we did do it last year with Chelsea and we did have other candidates but more bilingual candidates that came through but again once they have options and you're working with four or five other districts the candidates have to decide what districts maybe where they live.

720
01:09:45,914 --> 01:09:47,295
[SPEAKER_08]: So, those are other factors.

721
01:09:47,335 --> 01:09:53,100
[SPEAKER_08]: So, we are trying to be intentional about partnering and collaborating with other districts.

722
01:09:53,621 --> 01:09:55,502
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all in the same exact boat.

723
01:09:56,023 --> 01:10:07,652
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, when I say that everyone's looking for teachers, so it's about what is most special about your community, that someone will say, oh, I want to come to Medford instead of going to,

724
01:10:08,553 --> 01:10:09,774
[SPEAKER_08]: another district.

725
01:10:10,295 --> 01:10:27,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, we are partnering with universities and trying to work with Lesley, UMass, and some of our other local schools to say if we're advertising and looking for candidates, please advertise and post for us as well.

726
01:10:27,491 --> 01:10:28,612
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are trying to find

727
01:10:30,173 --> 01:10:59,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Unusual interesting ways if we're able to bring in interns that could potentially be trained with us for one year and then if there's an opening in their specific area, then they would be able to come but Right now with education and in other areas that the numbers there isn't as much interest as there was in the past And I do think the pandemic did make a lot of people fearful in terms of working in a school environment or

728
01:11:00,043 --> 01:11:02,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people, like, I don't want to be in a classroom anymore.

729
01:11:02,465 --> 01:11:03,746
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to do something else.

730
01:11:04,167 --> 01:11:07,129
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people have chosen work from home options.

731
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:09,711
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're working remotely in all sectors.

732
01:11:10,372 --> 01:11:13,194
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are going to have our work cut out for us.

733
01:11:13,334 --> 01:11:22,541
[SPEAKER_08]: And even at the state level, DESE with the department, our department of education, elementary and secondary education, they are also aware of that.

734
01:11:23,482 --> 01:11:30,131
[SPEAKER_08]: trying to think about ways to be able to recruit and allow people to come into education.

735
01:11:30,652 --> 01:11:40,805
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are looking at waivers for people who may have special licenses in math or physics or even languages that are being taught.

736
01:11:41,366 --> 01:11:46,811
[SPEAKER_08]: that they may not yet be fully licensed, but DESE is willing to work with them and say, OK, we'll give you a waiver.

737
01:11:46,851 --> 01:11:56,278
[SPEAKER_08]: But with with that waiver, you have like a one to three year window to go and get all of the official credentialing in line.

738
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:58,841
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you would be official with the state.

739
01:11:59,301 --> 01:12:03,845
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are trying all different avenues, but it is something that's going to take time.

740
01:12:04,345 --> 01:12:07,489
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I do want people to know that it's not for a lack of trying.

741
01:12:07,549 --> 01:12:15,297
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just that there are a lack of candidates or a very limited number of candidates.

742
01:12:15,938 --> 01:12:18,801
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want everyone to know that as well.

743
01:12:19,082 --> 01:12:19,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

744
01:12:21,993 --> 01:12:22,794
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Superintendent.

745
01:12:22,834 --> 01:12:27,337
[SPEAKER_21]: And I was just going to add, if folks will spread the word that, you know, we need folks here in Medford.

746
01:12:27,737 --> 01:12:39,705
[SPEAKER_21]: And also, if there are folks here that are interested, there's positions for paraprofessionals, there's positions for substitutes, people that might want to just pick up a little extra work, you know, and get into our schools and see what's going on.

747
01:12:39,765 --> 01:12:40,325
[SPEAKER_21]: We need you.

748
01:12:40,345 --> 01:12:41,766
[SPEAKER_21]: It does take a village.

749
01:12:41,846 --> 01:12:43,007
[SPEAKER_21]: So please spread the word.

750
01:12:43,087 --> 01:12:47,690
[SPEAKER_21]: And also, you know, consider if you're interested, letting Dr. Edouard-Vincent know.

751
01:12:49,721 --> 01:12:53,522
[SPEAKER_22]: The MTA last year started a scholarship fund here in Medford.

752
01:12:53,922 --> 01:12:57,023
[SPEAKER_22]: So the MTA is the Medford Teachers Association, our teachers union.

753
01:12:57,443 --> 01:13:04,726
[SPEAKER_22]: They started a scholarship program for our students, for students of color here in Medford interested in pursuing education.

754
01:13:05,306 --> 01:13:09,387
[SPEAKER_22]: So back to what you might want to do with those few pennies that you have.

755
01:13:10,027 --> 01:13:11,427
[SPEAKER_22]: That's another really worthy cause.

756
01:13:11,447 --> 01:13:12,148
[SPEAKER_22]: They're set up, they're a 501c3.

757
01:13:14,654 --> 01:13:16,556
[SPEAKER_22]: they can employer match and all of that good stuff.

758
01:13:16,616 --> 01:13:25,667
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's a tax deductible way to invest in students of color here in Medford who want to pursue education and hopefully come back and work for Medford Public Schools.

759
01:13:26,688 --> 01:13:27,309
[SPEAKER_21]: That's awesome.

760
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:32,315
[SPEAKER_21]: And also, you know, the pipeline is really drying up for teachers and especially for

761
01:13:32,867 --> 01:13:41,810
[SPEAKER_21]: Teachers in special education, so if you know young people who are looking for guaranteed positions when they're gonna get out of school, let them know that that's a field to really consider.

762
01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:46,512
[SPEAKER_21]: Also, teacher for the visually impaired, TVI, they're almost impossible to find.

763
01:13:47,232 --> 01:13:51,534
[SPEAKER_21]: So really specialist teachers too are really a great career to consider.

764
01:13:52,816 --> 01:13:59,359
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll just speak briefly on this, on the city side, um, because fire police, um, city hall was mentioned as well.

765
01:13:59,839 --> 01:14:06,161
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, and I think it just piggyback on Dr. Edouard-Vincent, you have to be intentional about wanting to diversify your workforce.

766
01:14:06,302 --> 01:14:08,242
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's what we are doing on the city side.

767
01:14:08,823 --> 01:14:19,027
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, I think over six months span, 25% of our, um, new employees were of diverse backgrounds and we're, we've made great progress on the police side.

768
01:14:19,427 --> 01:14:21,148
[SPEAKER_23]: We have far more females than ever.

769
01:14:21,168 --> 01:14:21,968
[SPEAKER_23]: We have far more,

770
01:14:22,585 --> 01:14:24,748
[SPEAKER_23]: employees that speak a second language.

771
01:14:25,049 --> 01:14:31,398
[SPEAKER_23]: It's really important to us to the point where the chief of police, myself, and our diversity equity inclusion director.

772
01:14:31,966 --> 01:14:38,970
[SPEAKER_23]: two years ago, petitioned civil service to ask that bilingual candidates be moved up on the list after veterans.

773
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:43,513
[SPEAKER_23]: That became a big hoopla, if you remember, but I wasn't afraid to do it.

774
01:14:43,693 --> 01:14:45,654
[SPEAKER_23]: We need to diversify our workforce.

775
01:14:45,894 --> 01:14:53,679
[SPEAKER_23]: We have some work to do on the fire side, but we've only hired once since I've been mayor, and I made sure that there was diverse candidates that moved forward.

776
01:14:54,159 --> 01:15:01,404
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'd like to give the example, and I gave it last week in front of the students at Medford High School, when you talk intentional,

777
01:15:02,723 --> 01:15:17,431
[SPEAKER_23]: The best candidates obviously have to get the job but we had a situation in the city for City Hall employee and it was a Medford resident who I happen to know versus a candidate from another city who was bilingual and who did we pick?

778
01:15:17,852 --> 01:15:26,517
[SPEAKER_23]: Person from another community that was bilingual because we want City Hall and our entire workforce in the city and schools to represent the people that we serve.

779
01:15:28,177 --> 01:15:28,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Paul.

780
01:15:29,743 --> 01:15:30,103
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

781
01:15:31,624 --> 01:15:42,931
[SPEAKER_18]: To come back to what Vice President Bears said about having enough resources, there was an article this week out of Arkansas or Missouri or Mississippi, forgive me for not knowing which ones it was.

782
01:15:44,212 --> 01:15:46,313
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is not a place with much money.

783
01:15:46,373 --> 01:15:49,015
[SPEAKER_18]: In fact, the community is particularly poor.

784
01:15:49,675 --> 01:15:52,497
[SPEAKER_18]: And so they could not get anybody for teachers.

785
01:15:53,578 --> 01:15:56,460
[SPEAKER_18]: And what they decided to do, and clearly they had to spend money,

786
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:02,866
[SPEAKER_18]: is that we do have a workforce in our public schools that is particularly diverse, our paraprofessionals.

787
01:16:04,667 --> 01:16:19,561
[SPEAKER_18]: And what Arkansas did, which I'm still kind of surprised, because it has to be wildly expensive, they not only would take their paraprofessionals, they would pay for their entire education,

788
01:16:20,664 --> 01:16:24,725
[SPEAKER_18]: And they would pay them their salaries they were getting as a paraprofessional to not actually work.

789
01:16:25,405 --> 01:16:28,546
[SPEAKER_18]: And all they had to do was be a teacher for three years after they graduated.

790
01:16:29,666 --> 01:16:31,607
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not a cheap endeavor.

791
01:16:32,447 --> 01:16:37,068
[SPEAKER_18]: But like probably most people up here, we got checks in December.

792
01:16:39,289 --> 01:16:44,950
[SPEAKER_18]: And the non-white teaching workforce is tiny.

793
01:16:45,894 --> 01:16:50,562
[SPEAKER_18]: And frankly, I think if you graduate and you're

794
01:16:51,657 --> 01:16:59,399
[SPEAKER_18]: a black woman or a black man in particular, you can pick and choose any district in this country you wanna work for and they're gonna pay you whatever they're paying.

795
01:17:00,259 --> 01:17:13,362
[SPEAKER_18]: So our teacher pay isn't, when we talk about diversifying our workforce, it isn't Medford versus Everett and Winchester, it's Medford against the entire nation of school districts that would like to have some teachers that aren't all white.

796
01:17:14,142 --> 01:17:16,603
[SPEAKER_18]: So we really have to think about that.

797
01:17:18,228 --> 01:17:23,991
[SPEAKER_18]: If you get to pick where you're gonna go, are you gonna go a place where you can't afford to buy a house on a teacher salary?

798
01:17:26,332 --> 01:17:33,655
[SPEAKER_18]: The pay in communities that are a 20 minute drive from here isn't really any different than Medford's, but you can buy a house for a lot less.

799
01:17:34,395 --> 01:17:47,241
[SPEAKER_18]: So if we want to solve these problems, all these things that I've heard are really important and good, but like Representative Garbally said, we're just talking around the edges here.

800
01:17:48,010 --> 01:17:54,473
[SPEAKER_18]: Because we're not going to diversify the workforce without a bigger workforce of people to hire.

801
01:17:55,233 --> 01:17:58,435
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we want to solve that, we could solve it.

802
01:17:58,455 --> 01:18:02,437
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, if Arkansas can do it, I'm pretty sure we could do it.

803
01:18:02,577 --> 01:18:08,340
[SPEAKER_18]: Not to suggest we're better than them, but seriously, we have so much money here.

804
01:18:09,367 --> 01:18:18,757
[SPEAKER_18]: and somehow a place that couldn't figure out how to hire teachers, because their pay is probably terrible, found a way to create a workforce.

805
01:18:19,698 --> 01:18:20,219
[SPEAKER_18]: We can do it.

806
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:24,083
[SPEAKER_18]: And every time I hear there's not enough workers, I do want to scream a bit.

807
01:18:26,145 --> 01:18:31,310
[SPEAKER_18]: Would anybody in this community really be that upset if all the people that worked at every fast food joint

808
01:18:32,384 --> 01:18:39,569
[SPEAKER_18]: found another job paying significantly more, doing something in education, or working for the city, or the state, or a bus driver.

809
01:18:40,409 --> 01:18:41,890
[SPEAKER_18]: There are plenty of people.

810
01:18:43,191 --> 01:18:44,772
[SPEAKER_18]: We are not willing to pay for it.

811
01:18:45,433 --> 01:18:48,735
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think there's not enough people.

812
01:18:48,795 --> 01:18:49,616
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just a cop-out.

813
01:18:50,576 --> 01:18:57,081
[SPEAKER_18]: And it really makes me angry, because I can go to McDonald's right now and get something, and there's nothing wrong with that work.

814
01:18:58,065 --> 01:19:04,769
[SPEAKER_18]: But if those workers were told they could get paid twice as much to come be a paraprofessional, they'd all quit.

815
01:19:06,010 --> 01:19:06,430
[SPEAKER_18]: They would.

816
01:19:06,670 --> 01:19:07,731
[SPEAKER_18]: There's enough workers.

817
01:19:08,451 --> 01:19:09,632
[SPEAKER_18]: There's plenty of workers.

818
01:19:09,652 --> 01:19:19,258
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to add, it's also really important to make sure that we're making the first level of the ladder accessible to people who are just graduating.

819
01:19:23,017 --> 01:19:25,379
[SPEAKER_17]: The first job is really hard to get.

820
01:19:25,879 --> 01:19:33,705
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we can make those first jobs be accessible to people, we can feed them into the public sector jobs that we need.

821
01:19:34,485 --> 01:19:34,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Agreed.

822
01:19:34,986 --> 01:19:52,639
[SPEAKER_06]: I also want to dovetail back to your point earlier, Roberta, in that if people can't afford to live where they work, and Paul, you were saying much of the same thing, then it's going to be difficult to get them to come to where you want them to work because they won't have a place to live.

823
01:19:53,335 --> 01:20:04,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Compounding that, if public transportation is not appropriate to get them to the places because they live in another town, it's going to be difficult to solve those equations.

824
01:20:04,729 --> 01:20:05,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Justin, you wanted to speak.

825
01:20:07,792 --> 01:20:12,113
[SPEAKER_24]: I wanted to make sure to speak because this is an issue I'm particularly passionate about.

826
01:20:12,793 --> 01:20:28,416
[SPEAKER_24]: I know I wrote a resolution that was supported by my fellow Councilors here asking our city about exploring ways to clarify the plans to train to develop that pipeline and to find new people to join our city.

827
01:20:29,376 --> 01:20:33,777
[SPEAKER_24]: But I think the most important point here is what Paul talked about with the lack of resources.

828
01:20:35,158 --> 01:20:36,358
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not just school districts but

829
01:20:37,178 --> 01:20:53,507
[SPEAKER_24]: Governments all across the country are seeing the importance of having diverse lived experiences and how that ties into good decent public services and how we provide that to our residents and Medford we're not again like Paul said we're not competing with our neighbors.

830
01:20:53,527 --> 01:20:59,691
[SPEAKER_24]: We're competing with everyone else and I have a lot of friends from diverse backgrounds who you know have

831
01:21:00,111 --> 01:21:04,796
[SPEAKER_24]: have taken well-paying jobs that pay double what they would in the public sector.

832
01:21:04,856 --> 01:21:10,641
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's a problem that we need to fix at all levels, from federal, state, and local levels.

833
01:21:11,742 --> 01:21:17,327
[SPEAKER_24]: But that brings us back to the need to have an open and honest and transparent discussion about our budget as well.

834
01:21:19,169 --> 01:21:32,932
[SPEAKER_24]: But we can also, in the meantime, talk about what we can do to address the little problems that come up and to capture some of the benefits of that lived experience with the resources that we have right now.

835
01:21:33,352 --> 01:21:44,314
[SPEAKER_24]: And so I've worked really closely with the diversity director and with the mayor to look at ways that we can expand language access in City Hall and in our city services.

836
01:21:44,794 --> 01:21:46,955
[SPEAKER_24]: If we can get more translators in, if we can

837
01:21:48,495 --> 01:21:55,961
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, the diversity director especially has been working really hard to do more in sign language, which is super important.

838
01:21:56,522 --> 01:21:59,464
[SPEAKER_24]: And that doesn't make up for the lack of diversity.

839
01:21:59,524 --> 01:22:01,686
[SPEAKER_24]: It doesn't make up for the lack of lived experience.

840
01:22:02,186 --> 01:22:07,030
[SPEAKER_24]: But it's something that we can do to capture the benefits that we would from lived experience.

841
01:22:08,912 --> 01:22:09,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Justin.

842
01:22:10,833 --> 01:22:11,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

843
01:22:11,514 --> 01:22:11,854
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

844
01:22:16,278 --> 01:22:16,478
Yes.

845
01:22:18,405 --> 01:22:19,385
I had an opportunity.

846
01:22:19,585 --> 01:22:21,066
I used to work for Boston Public.

847
01:22:21,826 --> 01:22:22,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thanks.

848
01:22:23,946 --> 01:22:28,647
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to work for Boston Public, and I was a paraprofessional, OK?

849
01:22:29,787 --> 01:22:39,729
[SPEAKER_04]: And at one point, I was going to come to Medford, and I asked the pay, about the pay.

850
01:22:40,449 --> 01:22:47,951
[SPEAKER_04]: It was less than Boston, even though I had to commute to go to it.

851
01:22:48,384 --> 01:22:49,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked in Austin.

852
01:22:50,006 --> 01:22:55,150
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had to get up real early and drive all the way to Austin.

853
01:22:55,651 --> 01:22:58,854
[SPEAKER_04]: But I really wish that Medford had paid more.

854
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:01,876
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just didn't.

855
01:23:02,077 --> 01:23:04,359
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just kept my job until I retired.

856
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:06,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

857
01:23:07,622 --> 01:23:09,083
[SPEAKER_06]: So you may have heard that we have

858
01:23:13,997 --> 01:23:23,565
[SPEAKER_22]: like 11 union contracts and they've all been out for renewal and there's been a lot of discussion about particularly the teachers contract, it's the biggest one.

859
01:23:24,205 --> 01:23:30,230
[SPEAKER_22]: But one of the really important things we did this year was dramatically increase the pay of our paraprofessionals.

860
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:32,452
[SPEAKER_22]: So I won't say it

861
01:23:33,627 --> 01:23:34,829
[SPEAKER_22]: It impacted everybody.

862
01:23:35,149 --> 01:23:37,392
[SPEAKER_22]: All paraprofessionals received a significant increase.

863
01:23:38,093 --> 01:23:44,620
[SPEAKER_22]: Many of our paraprofessionals, particularly those who work with our high-need students, saw a very significant increase.

864
01:23:45,281 --> 01:23:46,803
[SPEAKER_22]: Does that mean it's perfect?

865
01:23:47,504 --> 01:23:47,624
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

866
01:23:49,797 --> 01:23:53,440
[SPEAKER_22]: Our paraprofessionals were making an average of like $17,000 a year prior, a year, a year, 184 days.

867
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:55,682
[SPEAKER_22]: And now their average pay is over $25,000 a year.

868
01:23:55,722 --> 01:23:56,603
[SPEAKER_22]: Up to about $30,000 a year.

869
01:23:56,623 --> 01:24:01,387
[SPEAKER_22]: So it was a huge investment in our paraprofessional workforce.

870
01:24:16,157 --> 01:24:20,019
[SPEAKER_22]: We should have done it many years ago, so Ruth could have come to work for Medford Public Schools.

871
01:24:22,541 --> 01:24:33,408
[SPEAKER_22]: But it was a lot of hard work and shared commitment by everybody from the administration to the school committee to the mayor's office.

872
01:24:34,629 --> 01:24:42,555
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's a really, really important first step into stabilizing that workforce for Medford Public Schools, but it is just the first step.

873
01:24:44,242 --> 01:24:45,944
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, thank you, Jenny.

874
01:24:46,344 --> 01:24:54,214
[SPEAKER_21]: And even on that end, even at a $25,000, $30,000 annual salary, that's still not a living wage, right?

875
01:24:55,215 --> 01:24:57,337
[SPEAKER_21]: And so that's a huge part of it.

876
01:24:57,417 --> 01:25:02,303
[SPEAKER_21]: But also, it's really important to point out that if you're only given so much of the pie,

877
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:09,305
[SPEAKER_21]: and you cut a bigger piece off for somebody else, then somebody else gets a smaller piece, right?

878
01:25:09,765 --> 01:25:11,246
[SPEAKER_21]: And so we have to think about that.

879
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:12,307
[SPEAKER_21]: What are our priorities?

880
01:25:12,347 --> 01:25:24,397
[SPEAKER_21]: So when we're getting a million emails and phone calls and everything else and signs and everything else in the community about what we're not providing one workforce, folks need to understand that it's because we're trying to maybe

881
01:25:24,917 --> 01:25:43,917
[SPEAKER_21]: Help another workforce that has been underpaid for quite some time and we want to be able to increase the rates for everybody But again, if you're only given so much you can only do so much So it's really, you know thinking about what our priorities are and our budget shows what our priorities are Yeah

882
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:46,741
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be really short since I went really long last time.

883
01:25:46,801 --> 01:25:47,782
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for indulging me.

884
01:25:47,862 --> 01:25:51,445
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think what you just said also speaks, it brings us back to that point.

885
01:25:52,145 --> 01:25:53,146
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to grow the pie.

886
01:25:53,786 --> 01:26:08,536
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't be paraprofessionals don't get paid because teachers do or teachers don't get paid because paraprofessionals do because then at the end of the day, either the teacher or the paraprofessional or the student or the parents and the families or the whole community who needs

887
01:26:10,305 --> 01:26:20,629
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone needs resources and when we're pitting people against each other because the pie is too small It's it's not fair and and we all lose and Medford loses and I think you know again.

888
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:22,010
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here with you know

889
01:26:22,879 --> 01:26:26,182
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the mayor saying the good things, because I've been saying all the bad things.

890
01:26:26,222 --> 01:26:32,887
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's so many great things that are happening in Medford, and I'm so proud to represent Medford and to have grown up here.

891
01:26:33,787 --> 01:26:34,948
[SPEAKER_00]: But I grew up with this.

892
01:26:35,649 --> 01:26:41,513
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up when we cut music and art and recreation in the Great Recession.

893
01:26:41,653 --> 01:26:45,116
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up when my parents could buy a starter house here, and I can't.

894
01:26:45,296 --> 01:26:49,880
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew up at a time when people who grew up here could stay here, and now all my friends are gone.

895
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:59,167
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know everyone has a lived story like that, and it's because the pie is too small and the city can't help people, can't help the residents live here anymore.

896
01:26:59,427 --> 01:27:02,049
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a real problem.

897
01:27:02,449 --> 01:27:02,730
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

898
01:27:03,090 --> 01:27:03,450
[SPEAKER_21]: I like that.

899
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:04,751
[SPEAKER_21]: We need to make a bigger pie.

900
01:27:06,393 --> 01:27:08,915
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, sorry.

901
01:27:11,056 --> 01:27:11,677
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

902
01:27:11,957 --> 01:27:19,083
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so hopefully we've all got some good baking skills, because it sounds like a lot of pies need to be baked.

903
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:21,121
[SPEAKER_06]: sooner rather than later.

904
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:38,311
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a lot and it's an ongoing conversation and the one thing that we're thankful of here at the West Medford Community Center is that people are beginning to feel more and more comfortable about coming here and having the conversation.

905
01:27:45,016 --> 01:27:52,324
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot going on in Medford right now that speaks to the spirit of the community.

906
01:27:53,185 --> 01:27:58,931
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that's taking place on April 15th is the community cleanup.

907
01:28:01,854 --> 01:28:04,898
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can certainly find out more about this on

908
01:28:05,398 --> 01:28:19,389
[SPEAKER_06]: the city, Medford City website, but it'll be taking place in various places all over the city, 17 different locations, so if you want to get involved, that's definitely one way to get involved.

909
01:28:19,709 --> 01:28:25,053
[SPEAKER_06]: The cleaner the city looks, the more attractive the city looks, the more people

910
01:28:25,557 --> 01:28:29,658
[SPEAKER_06]: that we want to come live in the city will be attracted to it, I would imagine.

911
01:28:30,698 --> 01:28:32,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, all right.

912
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:34,219
[SPEAKER_06]: I missed a couple of questions.

913
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:37,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully we can do this again, probably sooner than later.

914
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:42,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe this becomes something we do twice a year instead of once a year.

915
01:28:42,161 --> 01:28:45,022
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's probably a good idea.

916
01:28:48,909 --> 01:28:50,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Be careful what you wish for.

917
01:29:00,032 --> 01:29:02,513
[SPEAKER_06]: So we appreciate everybody coming out today.

918
01:29:02,573 --> 01:29:07,915
[SPEAKER_06]: We think that we're getting greater and greater showings every time we have a public event.

919
01:29:08,335 --> 01:29:09,656
[SPEAKER_06]: here at the community center.

920
01:29:09,676 --> 01:29:20,187
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, I think that speaks to the fact that people recognize that this is a safe place to come and talk and fellowship and learn and grow.

921
01:29:20,407 --> 01:29:23,330
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why we've been here from the very beginning.

922
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:42,364
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is the heart of the historical African-American community in West Medford, and as you look around and you see the elder photo on the top and the African-American remembrance project on the bottom, there's no escaping that fact, nor are we trying to escape that fact.

923
01:29:42,704 --> 01:29:46,707
[SPEAKER_06]: But we want everybody who lives in the neighborhood to be comfortable with that fact.

924
01:29:47,087 --> 01:29:53,937
[SPEAKER_06]: And to know that that fact is not exclusive, it's inclusive, because black history is American history.

925
01:29:54,517 --> 01:29:56,080
[SPEAKER_06]: So the community's history.

926
01:30:01,275 --> 01:30:02,655
[SPEAKER_06]: It belongs to all of us.

927
01:30:03,156 --> 01:30:18,700
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that Medford is trying to do more and more as time goes by to recognize how valuable and important the contributions that these people have made to the growth and success of this very dynamic city.

928
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:20,261
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for coming.

929
01:30:20,721 --> 01:30:23,782
[SPEAKER_06]: On behalf of Lisa Crossman, our executive director,

930
01:30:30,532 --> 01:30:31,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

931
01:30:32,213 --> 01:30:38,075
[SPEAKER_06]: And our board members who are in the building, and Melanie back there, and Ms.

932
01:30:38,095 --> 01:30:49,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Furtado, and Dr. Kilpatrick, and Eileen Lerner, and Brian Collins, obviously, and me.

933
01:30:49,479 --> 01:30:51,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, excuse me, excuse me.

934
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:57,802
[SPEAKER_06]: And Rachel, who occupies a totally different category as a board member emeritus.

935
01:30:59,396 --> 01:31:04,362
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to say thank you and we hope to see you around the neighborhood.

936
01:31:05,504 --> 01:31:12,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, bye-bye.

937
01:31:16,875 --> 01:31:17,656
[SPEAKER_09]: One picture?

938
01:31:17,796 --> 01:31:19,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.

939
01:31:35,179 --> 01:31:37,500
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll let the experts deal with that.

940
01:31:52,328 --> 01:31:53,408
Thank you.

941
01:32:12,556 --> 01:32:17,159
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we're gonna be here in a few minutes.

942
01:32:28,907 --> 01:32:29,308
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
