00:00:04,503 --> 00:00:06,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, my name is Dave Crowley.

2
00:00:06,604 --> 00:00:09,285
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm president of the Mustang Hall of Fame.

3
00:00:11,206 --> 00:00:29,236
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mustang Hall of Fame is dedicated to honoring and recognizing those exceptional athletes, coaches, and community service contributors who have made outstanding contributions to the Medford High School athletic program over the years.

4
00:00:30,662 --> 00:00:36,586
[SPEAKER_01]: During this video, you'll learn a little bit about a few of the 13 people who will be inducted into the Hall of Fame.

5
00:00:37,487 --> 00:00:41,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Their stories and their accomplishments are varied and amazing.

6
00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:43,511
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they have one thing in common.

7
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:51,456
[SPEAKER_01]: They represent the very best of the Medford High School Mustang values and tradition.

8
00:00:53,419 --> 00:01:03,402
[SPEAKER_01]: nine athletes, one coach, and three community service leaders will be inducted on November 20th in the afternoon, that's the Sunday before Thanksgiving.

9
00:01:05,822 --> 00:01:12,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if you know someone who you believe should be in the Hall of Fame, we'd love to have that nomination from you.

10
00:01:13,264 --> 00:01:22,207
[SPEAKER_01]: So to find out more about the induction ceremony on November 20th, or to nominate someone to be in the Hall of Fame, please go to our website

11
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:27,933
[SPEAKER_01]: to read more information or to fill in and submit an induction form.

12
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:32,974
[SPEAKER_01]: The site is mustanghalloffame, all one word, .com.

13
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:45,978
[SPEAKER_01]: And one more thing, congratulations again to all the inductees who on November 20th will become members of the Medford High School Mustang Hall of Fame.

14
00:01:47,018 --> 00:01:47,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

15
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:53,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, I'm Cariann Luchares and I'm here with David Crowley, the president of the Mustang Hall of Fame.

16
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:55,477
[SPEAKER_07]: David, how are you doing today?

17
00:01:56,037 --> 00:01:57,237
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing fine, how are you doing?

18
00:01:57,657 --> 00:01:58,558
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing good, thank you.

19
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:02,679
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand you're a Mustang, so I wanted to know some of the sports you played in high school.

20
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was a long time ago.

21
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,461
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran cross country, I played hockey, and I also played baseball.

22
00:02:12,442 --> 00:02:13,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Which one was your favorite?

23
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,791
[SPEAKER_01]: baseball, without a doubt.

24
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:18,714
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was so great to see the Cubs do what the Red Sox did, ending in a long drought.

25
00:02:20,175 --> 00:02:23,098
[SPEAKER_01]: But baseball was absolutely my first love.

26
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,285
[SPEAKER_01]: And I played catcher, which gave me a chance to not only play the game, but watch it at the same time.

27
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:36,169
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about it, every other player in the field has their back to some part of the playing field.

28
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:52,053
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be able to see the whole game and influence it as directly as a catcher does, calling pitches, calling plays, setting up all sorts of schemes, if you will, in order to win, I really enjoyed that.

29
00:02:52,393 --> 00:02:55,374
[SPEAKER_01]: And watching it is just as much fun now as it was then, too.

30
00:02:56,274 --> 00:02:58,915
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a catcher as well, so I can totally relate to what you're saying.

31
00:02:58,935 --> 00:03:05,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you would agree that catchers are the best looking, most intelligent, have the greatest personalities.

32
00:03:05,157 --> 00:03:05,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, of course.

33
00:03:05,897 --> 00:03:06,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, OK.

34
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:09,559
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the greatest memory that you had playing baseball?

35
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:14,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, there are a number of memories on the field.

36
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:21,681
[SPEAKER_01]: The teams that I played on, I played varsity three years, and every year we made the tournament, and every year we lost in the first round.

37
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,342
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was great and frustrating at the same time.

38
00:03:26,282 --> 00:03:28,163
[SPEAKER_01]: But getting to those games,

39
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:33,245
[SPEAKER_01]: The talent of the team and the quality of the coaching was phenomenal.

40
00:03:34,565 --> 00:03:36,166
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of really good memories.

41
00:03:36,886 --> 00:03:44,910
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I remember most, and really had a huge impact on my life going forward, is actually off the field, but related to sports.

42
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:53,034
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time, there was a guidance Councilor named Peter Brady, who's still around, and I think a lot of people in Medford will recognize the name or know him.

43
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:58,409
[SPEAKER_01]: I was walking down the hall in the fall, and he said, how's cross country going?

44
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,630
[SPEAKER_01]: You getting ready for hockey?

45
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,832
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do for baseball right now?

46
00:04:01,932 --> 00:04:03,153
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were chatting about that.

47
00:04:03,173 --> 00:04:04,814
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he said, where are you applying to colleges?

48
00:04:05,675 --> 00:04:08,537
[SPEAKER_01]: And I told him, and he said, well, why isn't Harvard on the list?

49
00:04:09,257 --> 00:04:10,858
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, I can't afford to go to Harvard.

50
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Only rich people go there or whatever.

51
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,181
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, well, I'll make a bet.

52
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:20,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I told him it was another application fee, another $15 that our family just didn't have.

53
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:22,107
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, I'll make a bet with you.

54
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,652
[SPEAKER_01]: You apply to Harvard, and if you get in, you pay the fee.

55
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,774
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't get in, I'll pay the fee.

56
00:04:30,174 --> 00:04:30,815
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't lose.

57
00:04:31,775 --> 00:04:34,776
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I lost the bet, so I had to pay the fee.

58
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:55,784
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was my involvement in sports, and Mr. Brady, who was also very involved in sports, that connection, that, you know, it's really the personal connections between and among teammates and coaches and supporters and fans, that personal connection and interest that people took in me that really affected my whole life.

59
00:04:55,964 --> 00:04:58,945
[SPEAKER_01]: My whole life would have been very different, I'm sure, if I didn't go to college at Harvard.

60
00:04:59,785 --> 00:05:05,990
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it would have gone well, but still, it was a very different track that I ended up on as a result of Medford High Sports.

61
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:07,432
[SPEAKER_07]: That's nice.

62
00:05:08,372 --> 00:05:11,235
[SPEAKER_07]: After college, how did you get involved with the Mustang Hall of Fame?

63
00:05:12,663 --> 00:05:25,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, um, to be honest with you, I didn't think much about it until I got a phone call from the president of the Hall of Fame, Reggie, Reggie Graham, uh, on a Saturday morning, uh, letting me know that I was inducted.

64
00:05:26,648 --> 00:05:34,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that was the start because within months after being inducted, I was asked by the new president who took over for Reggie, Mark Romano, to join the board.

65
00:05:35,812 --> 00:05:36,332
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um,

66
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:52,103
[SPEAKER_01]: So I joined the board and spent four, five, six years working with the board to continue what we're trying to do for the athletes in the school currently, as well as recognizing Hall of Famers and their achievements in the past when they were students at Medford High.

67
00:05:53,223 --> 00:06:03,767
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really believe in that and spend a fair amount of time making our mission real for people because it's not just about recognizing great achievements.

68
00:06:03,847 --> 00:06:15,291
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really about building the community that we all enjoyed when we were here and to some extent reviving it and reliving it and re-experiencing classmates decades later.

69
00:06:15,311 --> 00:06:17,592
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean that's really a lot of what we try to do.

70
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:23,813
[SPEAKER_07]: I do think the community aspect really does go into the Mustang Hall of Fame as you can see with all these interviews.

71
00:06:24,974 --> 00:06:30,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there any criteria for kids, for upcoming student-athletes who are aspiring to be in the Mustang Hall of Fame that you guys look for?

72
00:06:31,702 --> 00:06:33,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, completely forget it.

73
00:06:34,497 --> 00:06:39,061
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're playing a sport to get into the Hall of Fame, then you're not playing the sport for the love of the game.

74
00:06:39,721 --> 00:06:43,584
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really, if you talk to most of the Hall of Famers, none of them.

75
00:06:44,124 --> 00:06:46,466
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, first of all, when I was playing, it didn't exist.

76
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:52,231
[SPEAKER_01]: And second, if it did exist, I think the greatest of the players played because they love the game.

77
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:56,094
[SPEAKER_01]: They love the camaraderie and the community of the team that happens.

78
00:06:57,214 --> 00:06:59,076
[SPEAKER_01]: They love the competitive element in it.

79
00:07:00,097 --> 00:07:02,458
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much to love about just playing the game.

80
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:11,964
[SPEAKER_01]: that if you focus on that, then whatever happens after that, whether it's a Hall of Fame nomination or not, will be a good part of your life.

81
00:07:12,585 --> 00:07:20,770
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only criteria is that you were an athlete at Medford High School, and that you're five years out of Medford High School.

82
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,013
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, we can consider you and anyone can be nominated by anyone else.

83
00:07:25,593 --> 00:07:37,681
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, you know, in terms of criteria, don't worry about criteria, because if you never get in and all you did was have a great time playing sports at Medford High School, you're already a winner.

84
00:07:38,682 --> 00:07:39,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Well said.

85
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,964
[SPEAKER_07]: I also understand that you are a chemistry teacher.

86
00:07:42,084 --> 00:07:47,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there anything that you took away from being a teacher that you apply to being the president of the Mustang Hall of Fame?

87
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:54,704
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an interesting question.

88
00:07:54,764 --> 00:07:59,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let lithium get exposed to open air in an airplane.

89
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:02,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you have the right iPhone, so to speak.

90
00:08:04,374 --> 00:08:04,734
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

91
00:08:04,754 --> 00:08:05,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Teaching, for me, is more

92
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:38,499
[SPEAKER_01]: uh... mode of operating than uh... a profession at this point i did teach professionally i did teach high school i taught in college uh... i'm now in sales and i view that as teaching to how do i help someone learn something that might help them succeed better in their business and if it doesn't work that's great here's what you might try instead of what we have right so it's really about teaching uh... and i think to some extent that expresses itself and has an effect on what happens in the hall of fame and how i work with the rest of the board members to uh...

93
00:08:39,422 --> 00:08:43,746
[SPEAKER_01]: achieve our mission, but I'm going to have to think about that for more details.

94
00:08:45,368 --> 00:08:48,370
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, thank you for taking your time out of your day to come talk to us.

95
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:49,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Back to you.

96
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:53,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, my name is Cariann Lutraris, and I'm here with the Mustang Report.

97
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:58,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here with Dave Richard and Meg Richard, who are brother and sisters that got inducted into the Hall of Fame.

98
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you guys tell me how that felt when you were nominated?

99
00:09:03,613 --> 00:09:25,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Megha was nominated first and I found out a few weeks later and I thought it was kind of a joke being played on me by some friends, a little prank, but I found out that the director was congratulating me and then it finally sank in and it's a pretty cool honor.

100
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:47,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I found out probably late August and I was very excited because I loved playing as a Mustang in high school and everyone was really excited and then we were on a family vacation and Dave found out that he was so everyone was just like an added excitement for that.

101
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:51,230
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just really cool to be nominated and inducted with your brother.

102
00:09:52,511 --> 00:09:54,172
[SPEAKER_07]: What sports did you guys play in high school?

103
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:57,655
[SPEAKER_04]: I played football and indoor and outdoor track.

104
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,147
[SPEAKER_05]: and I played soccer, basketball, and softball.

105
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:03,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one is your favorite sport?

106
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,869
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm always asked that question.

107
00:10:08,332 --> 00:10:11,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't even know how to answer it because I've played all three kind of my whole life.

108
00:10:14,256 --> 00:10:16,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe softball, I guess.

109
00:10:16,778 --> 00:10:18,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Good choice, good choice.

110
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,002
[SPEAKER_07]: What role model did you guys have if you had any being a Mustang?

111
00:10:24,093 --> 00:10:38,043
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was just kind of older teammates that I might have looked up to and practiced with and tried to work hard to be like them or to win a starting spot or be on the team.

112
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:44,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, when Dave was a senior, I was in eighth grade.

113
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:53,186
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually was given the opportunity to be the ball girl for the soccer team while he was there, because my phys ed teacher in middle school was the head coach.

114
00:10:54,026 --> 00:10:56,948
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd say a lot of those girls on the team I kind of looked up to.

115
00:10:57,328 --> 00:11:03,752
[SPEAKER_05]: And also my assistant softball coach, Sarah Sweat, who I'm very honored to have her induct me in the banquet.

116
00:11:04,653 --> 00:11:07,795
[SPEAKER_05]: So there were a lot of role models that a lot of girls my age could have looked up to.

117
00:11:08,571 --> 00:11:10,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you guys have any favorite memory while you were playing?

118
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:13,815
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a few.

119
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:20,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, a lot of them were obviously unexpected wins or advances into the tournament.

120
00:11:21,341 --> 00:11:23,803
[SPEAKER_05]: My soccer team was always very successful, which was awesome.

121
00:11:25,564 --> 00:11:27,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Basketball, not so much, but we had a lot of fun.

122
00:11:28,787 --> 00:11:31,149
[SPEAKER_05]: And softball, we just always had a good time with all the girls.

123
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,000
[SPEAKER_04]: The track teams, we were pretty good.

124
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,701
[SPEAKER_04]: We were pretty consistent in my four years, but football, not so much.

125
00:11:42,442 --> 00:11:50,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Only a few wins, if any, each season, but I think the best memory is that we won every year against Malden.

126
00:11:51,424 --> 00:11:53,584
[SPEAKER_04]: So four years in a row that we beat Malden.

127
00:11:54,824 --> 00:11:56,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I understand that D.U.

128
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Rich won more games with 21 than you.

129
00:11:58,145 --> 00:11:58,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that true?

130
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,228
[SPEAKER_05]: not agree with that whatsoever.

131
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:04,970
[SPEAKER_05]: We did play a lot growing up, we always played in our driveway.

132
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:11,754
[SPEAKER_05]: He is a good shooter, I'll give him that, but I do not know if I agree with the winning statistic.

133
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,096
[SPEAKER_05]: We might have to play again to see who would win.

134
00:12:16,257 --> 00:12:17,598
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's pretty even.

135
00:12:19,377 --> 00:12:20,718
[SPEAKER_04]: And I might have had a few more wins.

136
00:12:20,998 --> 00:12:22,658
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say even over winning.

137
00:12:22,818 --> 00:12:23,378
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say that.

138
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:26,360
[SPEAKER_07]: So was it really competitive growing up between you two?

139
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Or were you guys constantly building each other up?

140
00:12:29,821 --> 00:12:30,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm the youngest.

141
00:12:30,841 --> 00:12:31,661
[SPEAKER_05]: We have another brother.

142
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:33,702
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm the youngest and the only girl.

143
00:12:35,023 --> 00:12:43,105
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, we always were outside doing something, playing catch, playing pickle with a tennis ball, or playing off the wall, or playing basketball or something.

144
00:12:45,392 --> 00:12:49,893
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we were naturally competitive just because we were siblings and loved to play sports and everything.

145
00:12:50,933 --> 00:12:53,893
[SPEAKER_05]: But they were great role models to look up to, to play sports.

146
00:12:54,194 --> 00:12:59,694
[SPEAKER_07]: What would you guys say for any Mustang student who would want to be elected into the Hall of Fame?

147
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,515
[SPEAKER_07]: What advice do you have for them?

148
00:13:03,255 --> 00:13:14,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just, if you love the sport, you need to work hard at it and to do your best in whatever the sport asks you to do, whether it's off-season training or

149
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:26,567
[SPEAKER_04]: extra work in practice or watching film, getting better in however you can to be the best you can in that sport and just be dedicated to it.

150
00:13:28,038 --> 00:13:28,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I would agree with that.

151
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:45,110
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, hard work is kind of the epitome of being a solid athlete and to definitely work well with your teammates and encourage each other and just do your best every practice, every game, every scrimmage, like Dave said, in and out of the season to just be the best athlete you can be.

152
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:49,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you guys play sports in college as well?

153
00:13:49,213 --> 00:13:50,774
[SPEAKER_05]: I played intramural sports.

154
00:13:51,254 --> 00:13:52,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to UMass Amherst.

155
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:54,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I worked for the athletic department instead.

156
00:13:54,676 --> 00:13:56,458
[SPEAKER_05]: That is one of my biggest regrets, not playing.

157
00:13:57,398 --> 00:13:59,839
[SPEAKER_05]: on a college team, but I played intramural sports.

158
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:03,100
[SPEAKER_04]: I played football at UMass Dartmouth.

159
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,341
[SPEAKER_07]: And I understand you run the Boston Marathon.

160
00:14:06,841 --> 00:14:08,622
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the experience like that, doing that?

161
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:14,403
[SPEAKER_05]: It was probably one of the most surreal things I ever decided to do, and I ever did.

162
00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:21,105
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just something I always decided I wanted to do before I was 30, and I'll be 30 next year, so I kind of was running out of time.

163
00:14:22,246 --> 00:14:25,967
[SPEAKER_05]: I ran for Jocelyn Diabetes, which our brother Chris is diabetic.

164
00:14:26,748 --> 00:14:30,209
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a crazy experience.

165
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:31,810
[SPEAKER_05]: I trained from November to April.

166
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,731
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually had a bad injury to my foot in February, so I lost a month of training.

167
00:14:36,771 --> 00:14:38,892
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was hard to kind of come back from.

168
00:14:38,972 --> 00:14:43,333
[SPEAKER_05]: But I had a ton of support from my family, from my friends, from my students at school.

169
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:50,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Not sure if I'll ever do it again, but it was something I'm very proud of being able to do.

170
00:14:51,054 --> 00:14:52,134
[SPEAKER_07]: When are you running a D-reg?

171
00:14:53,895 --> 00:14:57,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no plans to run a marathon anytime soon.

172
00:14:57,075 --> 00:15:00,256
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, thank you guys.

173
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:02,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, this is Lydia Ryan with the Mustang News.

174
00:15:03,197 --> 00:15:06,637
[SPEAKER_08]: And today, I'm here with Coach Egerio of Medford High's cross-country team.

175
00:15:06,957 --> 00:15:10,178
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're here to talk about his recent induction into the Medford High's Hall of Fame.

176
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:14,379
[SPEAKER_08]: So first of all, to get this started, how did you feel when you were first inducted?

177
00:15:15,018 --> 00:15:16,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thanks, Lydia.

178
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,581
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of shocked about it.

179
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:20,362
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still coaching.

180
00:15:21,383 --> 00:15:26,727
[SPEAKER_03]: And when Mr. Crowley gave me a call, I said, what?

181
00:15:28,048 --> 00:15:28,869
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still coaching.

182
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I was really honored.

183
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,012
[SPEAKER_03]: It was more than I ever expected.

184
00:15:35,114 --> 00:15:39,157
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was really proud of being something I really am proud of.

185
00:15:39,177 --> 00:15:40,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

186
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:40,918
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad.

187
00:15:41,619 --> 00:15:43,921
[SPEAKER_08]: So how did you first get involved in running?

188
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:52,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, back in high school, my parents wanted us to get involved in some kind of athletics, and I couldn't play football or baseball.

189
00:15:53,944 --> 00:16:00,168
[SPEAKER_03]: So the cross-country team was out running, and coach came over and said, no, you like to try running?

190
00:16:00,508 --> 00:16:01,048
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, sure.

191
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:08,933
[SPEAKER_03]: So I ran 12 years in high school and then 12 years in college, so it's something I really enjoy doing.

192
00:16:10,153 --> 00:16:12,975
[SPEAKER_08]: And did you have any specific role model that you aspired to be like?

193
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:24,378
[SPEAKER_03]: If I look back on my career, I'd say my high school coach, his name was Brother Conson, and my college coach, Bill Squires at Boston State.

194
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:31,705
[SPEAKER_03]: They taught me so much about running, what it means to you, and how you can use it in other parts of your life.

195
00:16:31,845 --> 00:16:34,648
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would consider those two, and my dad.

196
00:16:34,848 --> 00:16:35,449
[SPEAKER_03]: My dad was

197
00:16:37,012 --> 00:16:37,993
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a great role model.

198
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:46,159
[SPEAKER_03]: He wasn't a runner, but he wanted us to do things, and he made sure that everything I did was the best I could be.

199
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:47,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

200
00:16:48,081 --> 00:16:51,404
[SPEAKER_08]: And did those role models help you become the coach that you are today?

201
00:16:53,706 --> 00:16:54,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I learned a lot from them.

202
00:16:55,687 --> 00:16:58,349
[SPEAKER_03]: They were just so inspiring.

203
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:00,051
[SPEAKER_03]: They just had so much love for the sport.

204
00:17:03,934 --> 00:17:08,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they were definitely the reason I'm still coaching today.

205
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:12,461
[SPEAKER_08]: And how long have you been coaching for?

206
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:14,662
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a tough one.

207
00:17:15,903 --> 00:17:20,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I graduated college in 1970, and I've been coaching since then.

208
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:32,736
[SPEAKER_03]: So I coached my first 10 years at Mall in the Catholic, and then I was fortunate enough to get a job here at Medford, and I've been here since then.

209
00:17:33,938 --> 00:17:37,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Out of all those years of coaching, is there any one specific memory that sticks out to you?

210
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wow, that's a tough one.

211
00:17:41,021 --> 00:17:45,923
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're doing something so long, it's hard to pick out one specific thing.

212
00:17:45,963 --> 00:17:47,023
[SPEAKER_03]: I had great teams.

213
00:17:47,763 --> 00:17:50,824
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had several All-Scholastic runners.

214
00:17:53,225 --> 00:17:54,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Amanda Fitzmyer.

215
00:17:56,587 --> 00:17:57,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, Chuck Martin.

216
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:02,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Phil Gailback, he's also coming into the Hall of Fame.

217
00:18:04,006 --> 00:18:08,513
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say he ran the state meet his senior year, was leading the whole way.

218
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:16,284
[SPEAKER_03]: He fell down with about a quarter mile to go, and the two favorites were well ahead of him.

219
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:26,635
[SPEAKER_03]: And somehow he put his whole self together, great guts and determination, and he ended up pulling out being a state champ.

220
00:18:27,495 --> 00:18:28,496
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one big memory.

221
00:18:29,136 --> 00:18:37,519
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think having the ability to coach so many individuals, so many boys and girls, which are young men and women,

222
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:40,120
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unbelievable.

223
00:18:41,001 --> 00:18:54,092
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big reason I still coach is that being able to work with all these individuals and bring them from being a non-runner to feeling, oh, I accomplished something.

224
00:18:54,572 --> 00:18:55,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would say that would be it.

225
00:18:57,398 --> 00:19:01,262
[SPEAKER_08]: So being a coach so long, you've definitely seen a lot and a lot of kids.

226
00:19:01,422 --> 00:19:07,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anything that you try and teach your students and your runners as a coach so they improve and become better people overall?

227
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:11,691
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you teach them that hard work.

228
00:19:13,312 --> 00:19:19,177
[SPEAKER_03]: brings out results, whether it's on the cross-country course, whether it's in the classroom.

229
00:19:20,538 --> 00:19:27,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Budget your time, work hard, commitment to whatever you really want to improve is a big thing.

230
00:19:28,063 --> 00:19:32,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that carries over into your life, your life goals.

231
00:19:34,627 --> 00:19:38,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Communication, communicating with the coach is a big thing.

232
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:41,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, you've got to communicate with your parents, with your job.

233
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:46,075
[SPEAKER_03]: All those little things that people think, oh, you just run.

234
00:19:46,555 --> 00:19:47,736
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes well beyond that.

235
00:19:47,756 --> 00:19:58,721
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, oh, when I meet runners from years past, that's one of the things they always tell me, well, you taught us some kind of commitment.

236
00:19:59,301 --> 00:20:02,563
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that makes you really feel good.

237
00:20:03,944 --> 00:20:06,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anything that you can remember that running has taught you?

238
00:20:08,906 --> 00:20:09,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Running taught me.

239
00:20:10,087 --> 00:20:11,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, running taught me a lot of things, I think.

240
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:20,922
[SPEAKER_03]: hard work, socialization, making other people work hard.

241
00:20:23,243 --> 00:20:29,665
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many, so many people that I've met through running, friends.

242
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:34,446
[SPEAKER_03]: It just goes beyond just the day in and day out of running, I would say.

243
00:20:36,806 --> 00:20:49,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think I can go on and on, but yeah, I think the overall experience of meeting people, you know, yeah, teaching Mr. Dempsey, we were classmates back in high school.

244
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:51,449
[SPEAKER_03]: We've become great friends.

245
00:20:51,489 --> 00:20:53,070
[SPEAKER_03]: We've met a lot of people through him.

246
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:58,251
[SPEAKER_03]: My assistant coach, Tom Lynch, Tom's been with me for 20 years.

247
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:00,672
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes me feel good.

248
00:21:03,152 --> 00:21:05,733
[SPEAKER_03]: The officials I meet nowadays go way back.

249
00:21:06,993 --> 00:21:08,273
[SPEAKER_03]: It just goes on and on and on.

250
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:10,834
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a great experience.

251
00:21:10,934 --> 00:21:12,455
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't change anything.

252
00:21:13,675 --> 00:21:20,718
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, I was a teacher here in Medford for 38 years, teaching elementary school, which was just fabulous.

253
00:21:22,158 --> 00:21:32,166
[SPEAKER_03]: the little kids in the morning, and then in the afternoon I come up here, so I had both worlds, so it's been a great experience teaching, and the city of Medford's been great.

254
00:21:33,007 --> 00:21:34,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the city of Medford.

255
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:40,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I've lived here my whole life, up until I get married, but yes, running's been wonderful.

256
00:21:41,794 --> 00:21:46,978
[SPEAKER_08]: And outside of running, is there anything that maybe as being a teacher that stands out to you and that you're most proud of?

257
00:21:47,991 --> 00:21:49,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Outside being a runner.

258
00:21:50,673 --> 00:21:51,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Proud of my family.

259
00:21:52,534 --> 00:21:57,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Proud of my wife, giving me the opportunity to do things over the years.

260
00:21:58,198 --> 00:22:03,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I spend a lot of time away from home in the afternoons, on weekends.

261
00:22:03,742 --> 00:22:04,943
[SPEAKER_03]: So that makes me feel good.

262
00:22:06,464 --> 00:22:10,787
[SPEAKER_03]: And everything's been, I've had a great experience.

263
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:15,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe as being a teacher, because I know you were involved in teaching the Special Olympics.

264
00:22:15,858 --> 00:22:18,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yes, that's a good idea.

265
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:28,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Back, I think it's 40 years ago, myself and two or three other phys ed teachers together, we put together the Junior Olympics.

266
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Here now it's going to be the 40th year and it's still going on.

267
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:47,710
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why we had the Junior Olympics, we brought all the, at that time, the junior highs together, and had all the sixth graders at that time, now it's the fifth graders, to intermingle with each other.

268
00:22:48,351 --> 00:23:03,380
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when they came up the high school, they got to know each other, better communication with each other, more friendship, and I think it kind of pulls all the, at that time, fifth graders together, and I think it makes better experience at the high school.

269
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Now do you have any advice for students coming into high school or runners on your team that you'd like to share?

270
00:23:11,061 --> 00:23:12,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, advice, yikes.

271
00:23:13,962 --> 00:23:18,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think when they come up to the high school, I'd like to see them participate in something.

272
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:20,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we'd like them to run.

273
00:23:20,825 --> 00:23:25,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, whether it's cross country or track, definitely.

274
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:31,670
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think they should get involved into some kind of athletics or get involved in clubs.

275
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:35,372
[SPEAKER_03]: I have like nine people on my team on the band.

276
00:23:36,172 --> 00:23:40,096
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really involved in the band, several involved in various clubs.

277
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:45,720
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I would say, what you do when you go to Medford High, it's a get involved.

278
00:23:47,142 --> 00:23:52,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't necessarily mean after school, go home at, I think it's 2.18 you go home, we call it, you know.

279
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:57,470
[SPEAKER_03]: But whether it's sports, I think it develops a lot of friendship.

280
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:02,515
[SPEAKER_03]: meeting each other, working together, socializing together.

281
00:24:03,016 --> 00:24:04,938
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be football, it could be hockey.

282
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:11,705
[SPEAKER_03]: I have hockey players, I have basketball players, I have kids on the math team.

283
00:24:11,845 --> 00:24:13,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Band, band's a big thing in my sport.

284
00:24:14,728 --> 00:24:19,169
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think if you get involved in stuff, you really learn the high school experience.

285
00:24:19,629 --> 00:24:23,750
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't let it slide and say, 10 years from now, jeez, I wish I got involved.

286
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:34,332
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say my big thing is coming to Medford High, involvement, whatever it is, sports, clubs, yourselves in the media.

287
00:24:35,573 --> 00:24:37,473
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something you'll cherish the rest of your life.

288
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:41,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Well thank you so much and congratulations once again on your induction.

289
00:24:41,693 --> 00:24:47,199
[SPEAKER_08]: You definitely sound like you deserve it and you've waited a long time to get something like this, although you didn't expect it.

290
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,023
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're probably the best candidate for this award that I can think of.

291
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:57,251
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank you very much and I just thank all the people who gave me the opportunity to stay here coaching.

292
00:24:57,591 --> 00:24:58,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

293
00:24:58,582 --> 00:24:59,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back to you.

294
00:24:59,523 --> 00:25:07,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, I'm Lydia Ryan with the Mustang Report, and today we're here with Kayla Sherry to talk about her induction to the Medford Mustang Hall of Fame.

295
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:10,109
[SPEAKER_08]: So first of all, congratulations on your induction.

296
00:25:10,129 --> 00:25:11,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

297
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,291
[SPEAKER_08]: And how did you feel when you were first inducted?

298
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so when I first got the call, I thought it was a prank.

299
00:25:18,202 --> 00:25:19,203
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I was being pranked.

300
00:25:19,223 --> 00:25:23,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was a friend, because all my friends would know I would love that to happen.

301
00:25:23,847 --> 00:25:27,030
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I realized, as I heard more details, like, oh, this is real.

302
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,431
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was just amazing.

303
00:25:28,491 --> 00:25:32,414
[SPEAKER_06]: It was super exciting.

304
00:25:32,935 --> 00:25:35,076
[SPEAKER_06]: The first thing I did after was call my grandpa.

305
00:25:36,297 --> 00:25:39,340
[SPEAKER_06]: He was a huge supporter of the teams that I played on.

306
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:41,542
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it was just pretty amazing.

307
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you ever expect something like this would come your way?

308
00:25:44,764 --> 00:25:46,968
[SPEAKER_06]: No, absolutely not.

309
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:49,152
[SPEAKER_08]: So what sports did you play in high school?

310
00:25:49,472 --> 00:25:52,698
[SPEAKER_06]: I played basketball, volleyball, and track, and field outdoor track.

311
00:25:53,521 --> 00:25:54,682
[SPEAKER_08]: You did a lot, that's awesome.

312
00:25:54,782 --> 00:25:57,906
[SPEAKER_08]: So what motivated you to play all these sports?

313
00:25:58,206 --> 00:26:01,449
[SPEAKER_06]: So growing up, my dad coached me in basketball a lot.

314
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:02,931
[SPEAKER_06]: I started when I was like six.

315
00:26:03,531 --> 00:26:05,233
[SPEAKER_06]: So basketball was kind of a big sport.

316
00:26:06,154 --> 00:26:09,477
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, he coached me, my mom was involved, like she drove everyone to practice.

317
00:26:09,878 --> 00:26:11,459
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that is definitely a huge part of it.

318
00:26:11,499 --> 00:26:13,481
[SPEAKER_06]: It definitely wasn't all just like me being motivated.

319
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:14,843
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a support system.

320
00:26:16,344 --> 00:26:24,249
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think just like getting into the whole athletic family at Medford High, you meet people on the basketball team who do volleyball, and they're like, you should play.

321
00:26:24,469 --> 00:26:28,812
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I mean, you just kind of go where your friends are going, and it made sense.

322
00:26:28,952 --> 00:26:29,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing with track.

323
00:26:29,853 --> 00:26:37,137
[SPEAKER_06]: I had friends who played basketball who were into track, and it just made sense to kind of stay in that group.

324
00:26:38,058 --> 00:26:42,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you have a specific role model, maybe your dad, who coached you through doing these sports throughout high school?

325
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would say my mom and my dad.

326
00:26:45,681 --> 00:26:59,187
[SPEAKER_06]: They both definitely helped me after a bad game, tell me that it wasn't the end of the world and my life wasn't ending and it wasn't going to be a failure, which is a hard thing to actually understand when you're a freshman and you just put all this pressure on yourself.

327
00:26:59,747 --> 00:27:01,809
[SPEAKER_06]: So they were helpful in that.

328
00:27:01,889 --> 00:27:08,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Other role models I'd say were the captains on my team when I was a freshman, like the seniors that I really look up to.

329
00:27:08,254 --> 00:27:19,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean if you had a bad practice, I'm sure this is true today, when you have a bad practice or a bad game, they're the first people to kind of like pick you up and say like this is fine, this is nothing, you're gonna be great, you are great.

330
00:27:19,963 --> 00:27:24,987
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that like team relationship is really strong here at Medford High.

331
00:27:26,025 --> 00:27:30,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any specific lessons that you learned being on a team that you've carried with you, like past Medford High School?

332
00:27:31,847 --> 00:27:32,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

333
00:27:33,768 --> 00:27:36,049
[SPEAKER_06]: I am going to take this opportunity to talk about feminism.

334
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:47,154
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the biggest thing I learned from high school sports and being on a team with other women, and I went to an all-women's college, so I have a little more experience with the all-women situation.

335
00:27:48,095 --> 00:27:56,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Having that bond with other women and realizing from older women that it doesn't help anyone if you are pushing your teammates down.

336
00:27:56,588 --> 00:28:02,637
[SPEAKER_06]: It really just takes the whole team down and the only way you're all going to succeed is if you're lifting each other up.

337
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:04,980
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what I was taught as a freshman.

338
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,143
[SPEAKER_06]: The seniors kind of lifted me up when I was feeling down.

339
00:28:07,723 --> 00:28:10,327
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a better player and they were a better player because of it.

340
00:28:10,387 --> 00:28:15,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if it was like, say, another point guard who, you know, we were a little competitive, they still wanted me to do well.

341
00:28:15,514 --> 00:28:17,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though that meant I could maybe start over than one game.

342
00:28:17,817 --> 00:28:20,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, everyone was kind of excelling together.

343
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:27,824
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I became a senior, it was second nature to just kind of see the freshmen and when they were down, I'm going to pull them up.

344
00:28:27,864 --> 00:28:33,147
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just what you do because you know that when you're doing well, they're doing well.

345
00:28:33,267 --> 00:28:34,768
[SPEAKER_06]: When they're doing well, you're a better player.

346
00:28:34,848 --> 00:28:41,952
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of this idea of everyone rising together, which has definitely followed me basketball and college and just in my career.

347
00:28:43,386 --> 00:28:48,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any specific memory that has stuck with you from any of the teams you were on that you can still think of today?

348
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:51,769
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many.

349
00:28:51,849 --> 00:28:56,491
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many good memories, but I would say

350
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:02,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably like senior night, senior night basketball.

351
00:29:02,693 --> 00:29:08,974
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was kind of just like all my years of work and just like all these relationships I've made coming to a head.

352
00:29:09,434 --> 00:29:12,174
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was, I mean, it's just such an emotional night.

353
00:29:12,294 --> 00:29:17,435
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're kind of just like reflecting on the past four years and what you put all this time and effort into.

354
00:29:17,575 --> 00:29:20,256
[SPEAKER_06]: And it just that night, it kind of all seemed worth it.

355
00:29:20,716 --> 00:29:22,536
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, that was pretty great.

356
00:29:23,616 --> 00:29:28,057
[SPEAKER_08]: So your experiences at Medford High through sports have carried on into college as well, correct?

357
00:29:28,645 --> 00:29:38,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I played basketball my first year at Wellesley College and a little bit into my sophomore year and then I had to stop to go abroad.

358
00:29:39,372 --> 00:29:45,956
[SPEAKER_06]: But I definitely was kind of carrying over my Mustang spirit and it was a really tough decision.

359
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:47,257
[SPEAKER_06]: I did want to keep playing.

360
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:51,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Are sports involved in anything that you're doing today?

361
00:29:51,154 --> 00:29:55,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I do some pickup basketball leagues.

362
00:29:55,215 --> 00:29:56,656
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in a couple of co-ed leagues.

363
00:29:56,676 --> 00:29:59,537
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in a men's league this past winter.

364
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:02,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really know how that happened, but I found myself in a men's league.

365
00:30:02,138 --> 00:30:02,858
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty great.

366
00:30:02,938 --> 00:30:07,300
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really competitive, but I would say the co-ed leagues were also pretty great and competitive.

367
00:30:09,401 --> 00:30:16,306
[SPEAKER_06]: I run every day, I do some races, I play volleyball in the summer, which is just for fun.

368
00:30:16,326 --> 00:30:24,032
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, just generally when I can get enough people to come together and play pick up or some kind of sport, it's just like the best thing ever.

369
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's rare as you get older, just that.

370
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,095
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's harder.

371
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:35,181
[SPEAKER_08]: So lastly, what is your advice to upcoming student-athletes in high school?

372
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:38,965
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say just don't be too hard on yourself.

373
00:30:39,686 --> 00:30:42,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoy your team, enjoy every competition.

374
00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:48,890
[SPEAKER_06]: enjoy the fact that it's hard and that you are struggling because that makes you a better person, it makes you a better player.

375
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:58,932
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if you're blowing out every team every game and you're the best on the team and you're scoring the most, that's cool, but it's also not challenging you and making you a better player.

376
00:30:58,952 --> 00:31:02,893
[SPEAKER_06]: So just enjoy that competition, enjoy that time with your teammates.

377
00:31:03,473 --> 00:31:10,014
[SPEAKER_06]: And it goes by really fast and there's no other feeling like playing and representing your high school.

378
00:31:10,114 --> 00:31:12,895
[SPEAKER_06]: So just know that and don't take it for granted.

379
00:31:14,307 --> 00:31:17,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank you for being with us today, and congratulations once again.

380
00:31:17,089 --> 00:31:19,690
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you for sharing your experience with us.

381
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,671
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really nice to hear it.

382
00:31:21,731 --> 00:31:22,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Back to you.

383
00:31:23,412 --> 00:31:26,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, I'm Carrie Ann Lutraris, and I'm here with the Mustang Report.

384
00:31:26,234 --> 00:31:30,276
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here with Al Uwango, who is one of the inductees for the Mustang Hall of Fame.

385
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:33,878
[SPEAKER_07]: How did you feel when you got nominated for this award?

386
00:31:34,838 --> 00:31:37,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Very surprised, and glad, and proud.

387
00:31:39,521 --> 00:31:41,782
[SPEAKER_07]: What motivated you to play soccer in high school?

388
00:31:44,242 --> 00:31:45,804
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I didn't play soccer.

389
00:31:46,684 --> 00:31:50,648
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came from Italy in 1958, I was 16.

390
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,752
[SPEAKER_00]: Necessity, I had to go to work.

391
00:31:56,033 --> 00:31:59,076
[SPEAKER_00]: But I played recreation after work, but not high school.

392
00:32:01,518 --> 00:32:05,382
[SPEAKER_07]: So did you have a role model when you were coming here and you were motivated?

393
00:32:07,706 --> 00:32:09,607
[SPEAKER_00]: I was too young to have a role model.

394
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:11,669
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know the environment here.

395
00:32:11,689 --> 00:32:15,012
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did it on my own.

396
00:32:15,032 --> 00:32:24,540
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally I see the program at the high school and I try to emulate that.

397
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:40,160
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hear that you started Medford Youth Soccer and I just wanted to know how you kind of started the program and how built up it is now considering a lot of kids are playing soccer and a lot of kids are very motivated doing that.

398
00:32:42,307 --> 00:32:49,491
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the motivation was that we need a program here because our kids were interesting.

399
00:32:50,171 --> 00:32:52,872
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order for them to play, they had to go out of town.

400
00:32:53,993 --> 00:32:59,856
[SPEAKER_00]: So myself and a few other people decided to let's give it a try.

401
00:33:00,876 --> 00:33:04,478
[SPEAKER_00]: We start with two teams, and then we balled up.

402
00:33:05,955 --> 00:33:10,338
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, over the years and become very successful.

403
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,800
[SPEAKER_00]: At one point we had about 20 teams.

404
00:33:14,821 --> 00:33:22,826
[SPEAKER_00]: They won several trophies and state champs and they were very enthusiastic years.

405
00:33:24,327 --> 00:33:28,770
[SPEAKER_07]: You also were the head coach for the Medford varsity girls soccer teams, right?

406
00:33:29,571 --> 00:33:32,313
[SPEAKER_07]: So how was coaching that different from playing?

407
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:40,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Coaching, especially girls, it's a lot different than boys.

408
00:33:41,003 --> 00:33:49,469
[SPEAKER_00]: So myself and Jim Reno had to adjust to it, even though my daughter was playing and his daughter was playing.

409
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:51,831
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to handle that.

410
00:33:51,911 --> 00:33:54,973
[SPEAKER_00]: Both daughters were cut.

411
00:33:58,395 --> 00:34:11,220
[SPEAKER_00]: in a little thing because the father was the coach and you know the house is spread that you prefer your daughter so on so we have to be very careful how we handle the whole team all around.

412
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:16,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have any advice to upcoming student-athletes who are interested in playing soccer?

413
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:25,484
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, student athletes, to begin with, the main study, it's study.

414
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:33,648
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to school, have good grades, because if you don't have good grades, they won't let you play, regardless of what talent you are.

415
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:41,953
[SPEAKER_00]: And then practice, practice, practice, and be respectful to your teammate and to the opponent.

416
00:34:43,534 --> 00:34:43,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

417
00:34:43,894 --> 00:34:44,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations again.

418
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

419
00:34:47,309 --> 00:34:49,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, I'm Cariann Luchares and I'm with the Mustang Report.

420
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:53,592
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here with Greg Wilson, one of the inductees for the Mustang Hall of Fame.

421
00:34:54,073 --> 00:34:56,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Greg, how did it feel when you found out you were inducted?

422
00:34:56,914 --> 00:34:57,474
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an honor.

423
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:11,942
[SPEAKER_02]: My mother's an inductee, my father's an inductee at his high school as well, so it's definitely an honor to kind of join the prestigious class and also have bragging rights as being the youngest member in my family now to be a Hall of Fame member.

424
00:35:12,742 --> 00:35:13,943
[SPEAKER_07]: What sports did you go in for?

425
00:35:14,598 --> 00:35:15,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Hockey and baseball.

426
00:35:15,799 --> 00:35:19,840
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up playing those two my whole life, continue to kind of dabble with them now.

427
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Just two of the sports I was most passionate about.

428
00:35:23,282 --> 00:35:25,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you have a favorite out of hockey and baseball?

429
00:35:26,192 --> 00:35:27,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably hockey.

430
00:35:27,953 --> 00:35:46,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I was fortunate enough to play baseball in college, however, you know, growing up around here, you know, being a huge Bruins fan and just living in New England, you're always taught that hockey, you know, is the number one and growing up playing pond hockey is something I definitely miss doing, but yeah, I'd definitely say hockey is my number one for sure.

431
00:35:46,345 --> 00:35:50,328
[SPEAKER_07]: In high school when you were playing sports, did you have a role model that motivated you?

432
00:35:51,365 --> 00:35:52,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't say I had one.

433
00:35:52,905 --> 00:35:56,126
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my parents were definitely always there for me.

434
00:35:56,806 --> 00:35:59,146
[SPEAKER_02]: They were people I looked up to all the time.

435
00:35:59,186 --> 00:36:05,588
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the sacrifices they made basically, you know, showed me and paved the way on how to be successful, not just in sports, but in life.

436
00:36:06,448 --> 00:36:07,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you have a favorite memory while playing?

437
00:36:09,548 --> 00:36:10,948
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a funny question.

438
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:11,949
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a ton.

439
00:36:12,669 --> 00:36:20,170
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, definitely a shootout win in a state tournament upsetting Woburn my junior year, beating Baldwin Catholic multiple times in the Hall of Fame tournament.

440
00:36:20,835 --> 00:36:26,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I'd say overall, you know, uh, play, I was able to play with some of my best friends growing up.

441
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:28,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not many people are fortunate enough to do that.

442
00:36:28,941 --> 00:36:33,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, play with kids that you grew up playing with since you were eight years old and graduating and still being good friends with those guys.

443
00:36:33,704 --> 00:36:36,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so it's almost a culmination of things.

444
00:36:36,546 --> 00:36:41,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, I mean, I was fortunate enough to, to have a lot, so it's definitely hard to pick one.

445
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:46,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have any advice for upcoming student athletes who maybe want to get inducted into the hall of fame?

446
00:36:47,863 --> 00:36:50,044
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just work.

447
00:36:51,205 --> 00:36:55,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Have that work ethic, but also focus on, you know, your schoolwork's important.

448
00:36:57,907 --> 00:37:05,390
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get it done in the classroom, especially if you want to play in college, and I think that should be, you know, motivation for every athlete is getting to the next level.

449
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:15,915
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, not all of us are fortunate enough to play professional sports, but, you know, we should have that drive and ambition to get there, and it can take us a lot of places.

450
00:37:17,213 --> 00:37:20,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have anything you took away from sports that now you continue to pursue in your job?

451
00:37:22,756 --> 00:37:25,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, just the work ethic, having that mentality.

452
00:37:26,337 --> 00:37:29,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming up, growing up in Medford, you kind of develop a blue collar mentality.

453
00:37:29,799 --> 00:37:33,340
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to outwork the next person in order to get where you want to go in life.

454
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,923
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, it definitely has helped me transition into the so-called real world.

455
00:37:39,773 --> 00:37:47,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean it's definitely what I learned here and the character traits I took from my coaches and my teammates continue to help me today.

456
00:37:47,525 --> 00:37:50,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you so much and congratulations again.
