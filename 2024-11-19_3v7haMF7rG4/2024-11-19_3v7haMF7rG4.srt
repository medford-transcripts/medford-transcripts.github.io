69
00:05:30,313 --> 00:05:35,294
[SPEAKER_14]: Russ, name and address of the record, and if you can give us a brief synopsis of the project.

00:05:36,074 --> 00:05:41,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, my name is Russ Bilodeau, representing Verizon New England, 21 Oxford Road, Mansfield, Massachusetts.

71
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:50,957
[SPEAKER_10]: The petition I have is actually to place one four-inch conduit from a manhole on Medford Street and extend across the town line into Somerville.

72
00:05:52,893 --> 00:05:57,637
[SPEAKER_10]: to a new customer place manhole, hand hole rather, on Dexter Street.

73
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:12,129
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that the portion of this work that falls in Medford is probably only five or six feet, but we will be connecting from a manhole to a customer place hand hole on the opposite end of that conduit.

74
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:17,954
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Belco.

75
00:06:18,234 --> 00:06:19,135
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

76
00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:21,017
[SPEAKER_13]: I threw you to,

77
00:06:22,327 --> 00:06:23,928
[SPEAKER_13]: the representative from Verizon.

78
00:06:24,908 --> 00:06:27,509
[SPEAKER_13]: If this gets approved, do you know when the work will be taking place?

79
00:06:28,609 --> 00:06:30,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Not offhand, no.

80
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:38,433
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that this is for a customer and it's pending service orders, so probably as soon as they can get to it.

81
00:06:40,474 --> 00:06:44,635
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, if you could just clarify, what service are they actually providing to the customer?

82
00:06:45,676 --> 00:06:46,356
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure.

83
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Some sort of fiber service.

84
00:06:48,096 --> 00:06:49,497
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all the information I was given.

85
00:06:53,272 --> 00:06:57,114
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so do we know the duration of the project?

86
00:06:57,934 --> 00:06:59,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably no more than two or three days.

87
00:07:01,035 --> 00:07:01,895
[SPEAKER_13]: Two or three days, okay.

88
00:07:02,015 --> 00:07:05,497
[SPEAKER_13]: And what's the impact to the residents that live in that area?

89
00:07:06,397 --> 00:07:11,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, we will have to dig a trench and put a conduit in the ground, so there should be some minor impact.

90
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:13,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing too crazy.

91
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,580
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't happen over a day.

92
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,961
[SPEAKER_10]: We can plate the road and come back the next day and finish.

93
00:07:20,462 --> 00:07:21,742
[SPEAKER_13]: The residents going to be notified?

94
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, they all should have been notified as a part of this hearing.

95
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:30,012
[SPEAKER_13]: Will they be notified when the work is being done?

96
00:07:31,832 --> 00:07:33,733
[SPEAKER_10]: We can make that a possibility, yes.

97
00:07:35,654 --> 00:07:45,357
[SPEAKER_13]: If you could, I think that would be just good if we could just make sure that residents of that neighborhood receive some sort of a message with regard to how they're going to be impacted.

98
00:07:45,717 --> 00:07:45,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

99
00:07:52,737 --> 00:07:54,038
[SPEAKER_13]: That is it for now, yes, thank you.

100
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:55,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

101
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:55,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Ross.

102
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:58,441
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate you being here tonight.

103
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:07,228
[SPEAKER_03]: My question is, whether it's 100 feet or five feet, what is the expectations of the resurfacing of that road as you enter to Medford?

104
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:16,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I do understand that the DPW laid out some, let me get back to it here.

105
00:08:16,575 --> 00:08:18,316
[SPEAKER_10]: They did, I can't find it.

106
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:27,362
[SPEAKER_10]: They laid out some conditions for some milling and paving and restoration of sidewalks as necessary.

107
00:08:28,123 --> 00:08:29,824
[SPEAKER_10]: So all those conditions will be met.

108
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:31,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

109
00:08:32,725 --> 00:08:33,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

110
00:08:34,526 --> 00:08:35,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Tim, I see you're on the call.

111
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:37,308
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything you want to add?

112
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:37,468
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

113
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:39,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

114
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:42,710
[SPEAKER_09]: I would just add that this is a very small piece of

115
00:08:44,425 --> 00:08:45,125
[SPEAKER_09]: of the whole project.

116
00:08:45,145 --> 00:08:46,626
[SPEAKER_09]: So like you said, I think five or six feet.

117
00:08:46,686 --> 00:08:54,130
[SPEAKER_09]: And the other thing I would mention, it's in between an existing crosswalk with some granite edging and some nice stamped brick work.

118
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:59,372
[SPEAKER_09]: So out of all the restoration that that's, you know, what needs to be put back in place properly.

119
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:06,675
[SPEAKER_09]: And as far as the cut goes, we're gonna lay out where we think the restoration makes the most sense for them.

120
00:09:06,695 --> 00:09:10,517
[SPEAKER_09]: And just because this is an odd one, it's just a kind of a strange spot.

121
00:09:11,838 --> 00:09:12,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

122
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:15,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Any other questions for the council?

123
00:09:16,781 --> 00:09:18,323
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, hearing and seeing none.

124
00:09:18,363 --> 00:09:21,345
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion by Councilor Scarpelli for approval, seconded by?

[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Knight.

144
00:10:16,202 --> 00:10:17,623
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

145
00:10:18,023 --> 00:10:20,766
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate you reading this into the record.

146
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:31,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Very recently, I received an email with a post indicating that the Benford Historic Commission was seeking applicants to fill a vacancy.

147
00:10:31,815 --> 00:10:34,457
[SPEAKER_04]: And at first glance, I looked at it and I said,

148
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,090
[SPEAKER_04]: That's no big deal.

149
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:40,472
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I went on to read the requirements of the application.

150
00:10:40,812 --> 00:10:42,353
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have some talking points on this.

151
00:10:44,094 --> 00:10:49,256
[SPEAKER_04]: The historic commission is calling for letters of intent for interested parties to join their commission.

152
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:55,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Applicants should have an interest knowledge and experience in fields related to historic preservation and method history.

153
00:10:56,179 --> 00:10:58,640
[SPEAKER_04]: And they may contact the commission for further information.

154
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:02,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Candidates may be contacted by the commission for an interview

155
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:08,454
[SPEAKER_04]: and the commission shall then present a list of nominees to the mayor for final selection and appointment.

156
00:11:09,494 --> 00:11:11,315
[SPEAKER_04]: And this struck me as odd, Mr. President.

157
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:18,380
[SPEAKER_04]: The way the boards and commissions are filled usually doesn't operate in this fashion.

158
00:11:20,441 --> 00:11:28,086
[SPEAKER_04]: The composition, appointment, powers, and duties of the commission are outlined by statute, by general law, chapter 40, section 8D.

159
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,709
[SPEAKER_04]: And nowhere in that

160
00:11:32,273 --> 00:11:36,995
[SPEAKER_04]: legislative act, does it provide the commission with human resource authority or selection power?

161
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:40,637
[SPEAKER_04]: That power is the exclusive purview of the mayor, Mr. President.

162
00:11:41,898 --> 00:11:56,044
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I look at the commission seeking to attain letters of intent to then screen applicants to then send it to the mayor for who's going to be appointed, it becomes concerning to me.

163
00:11:56,104 --> 00:11:59,166
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a clear overreach of the authority that's outlined in the statute, Mr. President.

164
00:12:00,363 --> 00:12:02,724
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's problematic from a human resource perspective.

165
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,767
[SPEAKER_04]: A member of a board of commission, once appointed, becomes a city employee.

166
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:11,369
[SPEAKER_04]: And that opens a city up to certain liabilities.

167
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:21,095
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're applying for a position on a board or a commission, the process should be open, transparent, but you should also be very cognizant of workers' rights and the applicants' rights, Mr. President.

168
00:12:21,135 --> 00:12:29,159
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that the board of commission has the technical expertise to ensure that the city's liabilities aren't going to be at risk.

169
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:46,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Further, when a board of commission is the screening entity to select members of its own board of commission, creates the impression that this becomes a good old boys club, a network where you have to be a friend of the board in order to participate.

170
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:51,102
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor was the person that was vested with this authority through statute for a reason.

171
00:12:51,582 --> 00:12:58,907
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so that we can have a diverse board that represents various aspects and walks of life in our community that have concern and interest over our historic preservation

172
00:12:59,765 --> 00:13:02,305
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought that that was very concerning, Mr. President.

173
00:13:03,986 --> 00:13:09,907
[SPEAKER_04]: And the biggest, most concerning part of it is that, you know, certain applications will never reach the mayor's desk.

174
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:17,528
[SPEAKER_04]: The commission will interview individuals and then they will send to the mayor who they feel should be appointed after their screening process.

175
00:13:18,368 --> 00:13:23,929
[SPEAKER_04]: So that raises some concerns relative to record retention and the like that surround the municipal government, Mr. President.

176
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,230
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, I'm asking that the,

177
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:53,279
[SPEAKER_04]: the administration report to us what their hiring practices, what their policy is, and take a look into this issue that's going on with the historic commission because I feel as though number one, it's a extreme overreach of the statutory authority, number one, and number two, opens the city up to liabilities related to the human resource world and also records retention and other criteria that behest upon a professional administration related to the implementation of human resource policies.

178
00:13:53,859 --> 00:13:57,140
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support this measure.

179
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:08,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, and looking at it, I feel as though it's somewhat odd that a border commission would try to handpick the members that they're going to serve with and the members that they're going to work with.

180
00:14:09,071 --> 00:14:16,958
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that that's problematic and I don't think that that was the intent of the state statute that was passed when it was enacted here in the city of Medford to establish a historic commission.

181
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:18,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

182
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:21,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

183
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,944
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is a worthy thing to look into for all commissions that I think Councilor Knight, Vice President Knight for bringing it up.

184
00:14:28,304 --> 00:14:39,653
[SPEAKER_01]: I am curious if we could add as either a B paper or an amendment just to get an updated list of stipends associated with commissions, as well as length of terms, if we're going to be asking for this information, just to have it all in one place.

185
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:43,776
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly have no problem with that, Mr. President.

186
00:14:43,836 --> 00:14:51,062
[SPEAKER_04]: I do believe we look back in our package four weeks, four and a half weeks, five weeks ago, I believe we did get a copy of the list of the boards of commission, but I have no problem asking for that again.

187
00:14:53,874 --> 00:14:54,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, thank you.

188
00:14:56,175 --> 00:14:57,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Chief of Staff Rodriguez.

189
00:14:58,315 --> 00:14:59,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

190
00:14:59,196 --> 00:15:01,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Vice President and I for bringing it up.

191
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:04,278
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't aware of the email that was sent out by the historic commission.

192
00:15:04,318 --> 00:15:08,139
[SPEAKER_08]: If you could forward that over to the administration, I'd appreciate it so I can take a look.

193
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:12,661
[SPEAKER_08]: From one of the first things that we did once we came into office last January,

194
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:25,074
[SPEAKER_08]: was to put together an interest forum for folks that's currently on our website that anyone in the community can fill out and email to boardsandcommissions at medford-ma.gov to show their interest directly to us.

195
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:33,013
[SPEAKER_08]: And we build a database as it exists for people who are interested in commissions.

196
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:39,577
[SPEAKER_08]: So as vacancies come up, those are the people that generally we reach out to to gauge their interest in serving on a particular commission.

197
00:15:39,617 --> 00:15:44,280
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm curious about this process that's being entered into by the historic commission as well.

198
00:15:44,341 --> 00:15:56,389
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wanna reach out to them and make sure that it's in alignment with the exact processes that you were talking about, the human resources aspect of it, the diversity aspect of it, and kind of the existing practice that we've enacted since we came in office.

199
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,360
[SPEAKER_08]: in January.

200
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,421
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you could turn it over, I'd appreciate it just so I can take a look.

201
00:16:01,721 --> 00:16:04,621
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's been generally the process that we've been following since last January.

202
00:16:06,022 --> 00:16:07,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, through you to the gentleman.

203
00:16:07,562 --> 00:16:08,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Vice President Knight.

204
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:15,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Through you to the gentleman, Mr. President, that was our case in point when we were speaking about some of our appointments that the council has authority for.

205
00:16:15,363 --> 00:16:23,625
[SPEAKER_04]: We requested that the administration provide us with any applicants that expressed interest in the Mel commission, for example, because I was under the impression that they had a policy.

206
00:16:24,145 --> 00:16:25,825
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is just something I want to make sure that I'm able

207
00:16:26,105 --> 00:16:26,945
[SPEAKER_04]: without a rise across it.

208
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:29,227
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a slippery slope.

209
00:16:29,607 --> 00:16:33,389
[SPEAKER_04]: And I appreciate the chief of staff for his willingness to investigate.

210
00:16:34,169 --> 00:16:34,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

211
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:35,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Belco.

212
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:36,950
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

213
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,052
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor, for bringing this forward.

214
00:16:40,192 --> 00:16:40,812
[SPEAKER_13]: This is important.

215
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:41,493
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very important.

216
00:16:41,513 --> 00:16:51,238
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to make sure that we get the process that we, but that the administration is doing the process right, making sure that we're consistent with the way we do this.

217
00:16:52,038 --> 00:16:53,759
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just say, actually,

218
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,419
[SPEAKER_13]: through you to Chief of Staff Rodriguez.

219
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:03,862
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it possible, I just kind of did a little preliminary research this past weekend when I saw the resolution on the agenda.

220
00:17:04,243 --> 00:17:11,346
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we just make sure that the online list of commissions is just updated?

221
00:17:11,386 --> 00:17:14,827
[SPEAKER_13]: It seemed like some people's terms may have actually expired.

222
00:17:15,248 --> 00:17:18,549
[SPEAKER_13]: And we just make sure that's an up-to-date list on the website.

223
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:20,130
[SPEAKER_13]: And if someone knew,

224
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:26,605
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, someone who took on a role, they should be listed and the terms should be listed as well on the expiration dates.

225
00:17:27,065 --> 00:17:30,288
[SPEAKER_13]: But I look quickly and it looked like there was some that expired back last year.

226
00:17:30,328 --> 00:17:37,414
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just wanna make sure that's up to date so people can see if there's any availability or if there's any vacancies on the commissions.

227
00:17:37,554 --> 00:17:37,874
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

228
00:17:38,214 --> 00:17:38,955
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor.

229
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:39,976
[SPEAKER_14]: Any further questions on this?

230
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:42,478
[SPEAKER_13]: And if I could add that as an amendment.

231
00:17:43,489 --> 00:17:44,589
[SPEAKER_14]: as amended by Councilor.

232
00:17:44,629 --> 00:17:45,009
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

233
00:17:45,109 --> 00:17:49,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, that's been an ongoing project of the office for a while.

234
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,251
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're trying to keep up with it.

235
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:55,872
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll be doing our call for interest in several boards and commissions in the next couple of weeks.

236
00:17:56,752 --> 00:17:57,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

237
00:17:57,652 --> 00:17:58,012
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

238
00:17:58,932 --> 00:18:06,474
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Vice President Mayne, seconded by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Morell, and amended by Councilor Falco.

239
00:18:06,494 --> 00:18:07,854
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

240
00:18:11,435 --> 00:18:12,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Bears.

241
00:18:12,595 --> 00:18:12,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

242
00:18:14,175 --> 00:18:14,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco.

243
00:18:15,536 --> 00:18:15,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

244
00:18:16,316 --> 00:18:17,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Knight.

245
00:18:18,158 --> 00:18:18,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

246
00:18:19,218 --> 00:18:19,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

247
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:20,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

248
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:21,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Morell.

249
00:18:22,361 --> 00:18:22,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

250
00:18:23,501 --> 00:18:24,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

251
00:18:24,422 --> 00:18:24,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

252
00:18:24,982 --> 00:18:25,823
[SPEAKER_03]: President Caraviello.

253
00:18:25,903 --> 00:18:28,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, seven in favor of the motion passes.

254
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,226
[SPEAKER_14]: 21060 offered by President Knight.

255
00:18:30,506 --> 00:18:34,769
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Knight has been removed, has been withdrawn.

256
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:40,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Withdrawn the paper, Mr. President, the administration not provided that information prior to the meeting.

257
00:18:40,373 --> 00:18:41,033
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

258
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,775
[SPEAKER_14]: 21061 offered by Vice President Knight has also been withdrawn.

259
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:50,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Mr. President, the administration has established the Cannabis Advisory Commission meetings.

260
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:55,827
[SPEAKER_04]: They kicked off just last week, I believe.

261
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:57,388
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

262
00:18:57,408 --> 00:18:59,851
[SPEAKER_14]: 21062, offered by Vice President Knight, has been withdrawn.

263
00:19:00,751 --> 00:19:10,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Mr. President, that was related to the Board of Health, and the administration has put out a couple of new hotline numbers related to COVID vaccine response and coronavirus response.

264
00:19:11,681 --> 00:19:12,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I did have a difficult time

265
00:19:13,967 --> 00:19:18,329
[SPEAKER_04]: reaching the individual on the phone there last week, I called over 30 times and did not get a live operator.

266
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:24,951
[SPEAKER_04]: But it appears that the administration's cognizant of the high volume of calls that are going through the office and have taken appropriate steps to address it.

267
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:26,131
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have no issue here.

268
00:19:27,552 --> 00:19:28,632
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Vice President Knight.

269
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:30,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Knight, if you could take the chair,

270
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:06,238
[SPEAKER_03]: to take on 21063.

271
00:20:11,483 --> 00:20:13,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

272
00:20:13,965 --> 00:20:18,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Council paper 21063 offered by President Caraviello.

273
00:20:19,209 --> 00:20:31,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved, the Medford City Council receive a report from the MWRA on what is the plan to return Memorial Field's fondant shelf in the Auburn Street side of the parkland back to its original condition or better.

274
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:42,050
[SPEAKER_04]: and be it further resolved that while Memorial Field is being used by the MWRA, now would be the time to discuss changing the lighting at the field and possibly with some assistance from the MWRA.

275
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviello.

276
00:20:43,991 --> 00:20:45,433
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Knight.

277
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:57,201
[SPEAKER_14]: This is something, I don't know, people have been driving by and they've been seeing the large amount of work being done by the MWRA, both at the Carleton Shell, Memorial Field, and on the other side of the river.

278
00:20:58,462 --> 00:21:00,784
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it's just work they're doing, I think they're lining the pipe.

279
00:21:01,104 --> 00:21:01,965
[SPEAKER_14]: But for whatever they're doing,

280
00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:05,226
[SPEAKER_14]: field and everything is getting pretty beat up.

281
00:21:06,387 --> 00:21:13,631
[SPEAKER_14]: And summer's going to be, the spring's going to be coming, and the kids are going to be down there, going to be looking to play a little league ball.

282
00:21:14,211 --> 00:21:23,076
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would hope that the MWRA will be finished, and putting that field in Carleton Shell back to its original condition and better.

283
00:21:23,437 --> 00:21:31,261
[SPEAKER_14]: And also, this is something that I brought up many times over the years about the lights at Memorial Field being on all the time, never shutting off.

284
00:21:32,336 --> 00:21:34,917
[SPEAKER_14]: and they were saying they're old and they have to be fixed.

285
00:21:34,937 --> 00:21:46,022
[SPEAKER_14]: So while the field is dug up in MWRA, I would think now would be the time to discuss changing those lights and maybe using the MWRA to help pay for some of that.

286
00:21:46,422 --> 00:21:53,465
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd ask my councilors for support and any suggestions to how we can maybe get these lights changed.

287
00:21:56,706 --> 00:21:58,167
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Falco.

288
00:21:58,187 --> 00:21:58,927
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, president.

289
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,601
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Caraviello for bringing this forward.

290
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:05,583
[SPEAKER_13]: This is something that definitely needs to be addressed.

291
00:22:05,623 --> 00:22:18,991
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to receive some sort of an update, but specifically if I could amend the paper to get the timing of the project and when it will be complete, I think that will go a long way in trying to figure out how we can resolve the situation.

292
00:22:19,492 --> 00:22:20,832
[SPEAKER_04]: On the amendment, does the chair have a second?

293
00:22:21,393 --> 00:22:21,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

294
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

295
00:22:24,215 --> 00:22:26,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

296
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:26,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

297
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor.

298
00:22:27,737 --> 00:22:29,458
[SPEAKER_03]: President Caraviello bringing this forward.

299
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:31,487
[SPEAKER_03]: We see the movement.

300
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:47,012
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be nice to hear if there's any discussion with the city administration with any open requests from the Community Preservation Committee that there could be something worked together.

301
00:22:48,232 --> 00:22:58,135
[SPEAKER_03]: If there is any requests from the city to work together, maybe to make that park that I know it's a state run facility, but maybe it might be something that

302
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:02,669
[SPEAKER_03]: we can work with the DCR and MWRA to maybe take control of that.

303
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:26,200
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the issues with the lights that we've had in my profession, when we've had issues with that, Councilor Caraviello, it might behoove us that we request the DCR and our director of DPW look into the possibility of putting in

304
00:23:27,185 --> 00:23:31,667
[SPEAKER_03]: satellite system where it could be controlled via your iPhone.

305
00:23:32,247 --> 00:23:34,648
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a very easy fix.

306
00:23:34,828 --> 00:23:45,293
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that some lighting systems are outdated, but in my community where I work, there was an outdated system.

307
00:23:45,313 --> 00:23:55,197
[SPEAKER_03]: We thought it wouldn't be compatible, but it was only a $5,000 fix that turned a whole field that lights are being left on.

308
00:23:55,985 --> 00:23:58,167
[SPEAKER_03]: and to a very easy solution.

309
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:14,078
[SPEAKER_03]: And the money that was saved just on wasted electricity on those lights that were left on over and over again, it saved, that box saved the outgoing funding and they take a few trips.

310
00:24:14,118 --> 00:24:23,105
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we could ask the Director of Lines, Wise Lines and maybe the DPW Director,

311
00:24:23,744 --> 00:24:38,475
[SPEAKER_03]: to work with DCR about seeing if it's compatible to put in the, I'm not, I think athletic director Maloney might have the company that does it through the satellite system.

312
00:24:39,075 --> 00:24:42,078
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they can work together to see if we can do that, that might be a solution.

313
00:24:42,418 --> 00:24:42,698
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

314
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:44,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scapello.

315
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:46,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Chair, would you second on Councilor Scapello's motion?

316
00:24:46,661 --> 00:24:46,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

317
00:24:48,122 --> 00:24:49,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

318
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,484
[SPEAKER_04]: see that we have Tim McGivern on the call.

319
00:24:54,664 --> 00:25:00,828
[SPEAKER_04]: If any of the council is one of anything else they'd like to add, maybe we can ask Tim if you can give us an update on the status of the construction location.

320
00:25:02,589 --> 00:25:02,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Tim.

321
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:09,312
[SPEAKER_09]: The MWRA manhole project in Memorial Field, that's what we're discussing, correct?

322
00:25:09,352 --> 00:25:11,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that's correct.

323
00:25:11,814 --> 00:25:17,177
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is all area that's within their rights to work and we don't have a lot of information on that.

324
00:25:17,217 --> 00:25:19,078
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you guys asked me, I was gonna try to see if I could

325
00:25:19,628 --> 00:25:20,729
[SPEAKER_09]: find some out for you.

326
00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:26,732
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know exactly when they're supposed to end, but I think I can find out whatever information you guys want from their team.

327
00:25:28,272 --> 00:25:28,573
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

328
00:25:29,053 --> 00:25:29,273
[SPEAKER_14]: Tim.

329
00:25:29,753 --> 00:25:31,134
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviello.

330
00:25:31,194 --> 00:25:41,179
[SPEAKER_14]: Tim, I would hope that they're gonna put that field in cause and show back into, at least it's original vision, if not better.

331
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:46,962
[SPEAKER_14]: So even though it's their property, are the standards still the same?

332
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:54,154
[SPEAKER_09]: They would be, yeah, and Medford does have rights, lease rights on that land through DCR.

333
00:25:54,474 --> 00:25:56,836
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have some rights, they have some rights.

334
00:25:57,717 --> 00:26:01,499
[SPEAKER_09]: The expectation would be that, you know, they put it back to the way it was or better.

335
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:10,906
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, after this conversation, I can find out some more information, you know, find out when they're gonna end and find out, confirm that they're going to be

336
00:26:11,485 --> 00:26:12,446
[SPEAKER_09]: putting it all back together.

337
00:26:12,466 --> 00:26:21,633
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't heard much about this project besides some of the early on scope and some of the early on traffic management that they wanted to do that they're, I think they're complete with.

338
00:26:21,974 --> 00:26:26,758
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's basically work that's left on their property that they have kind of full rights to.

339
00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:28,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

340
00:26:33,637 --> 00:26:44,506

[SPEAKER_04]: With seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

[SPEAKER_03]: Council paper 21064 offered by President Caraviello.

358
00:27:21,076 --> 00:27:30,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved, the Medford City Council send a birthday wish to Anna Ekpenyong on the celebration of her 96th birthday.

359
00:27:30,062 --> 00:27:30,863

360
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:40,665
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to send out a birthday wish.

361
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:50,771
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a constant volunteer vote that Western River Community Center and AACP, and anything really going on down there, and there is always involved.

362
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:57,756
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just want to wish her a celebration of her young 96th birthday.

363
00:27:57,836 --> 00:27:58,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations, Joanna.

364
00:27:59,297 --> 00:27:59,577
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

371
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,860
[SPEAKER_03]: We get this right this time.

[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

[SPEAKER_03]: President Caraviello.

379
00:28:21,803 --> 00:28:22,043
Yes.

380
00:28:22,244 --> 00:28:22,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President.

381
00:28:22,984 --> 00:28:23,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

382
00:28:27,385 --> 00:28:29,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

383
00:28:44,330 --> 00:29:04,544
[SPEAKER_14]: 21066 offered by Vice President Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council request the Building Commissioner take the necessary steps to have the donation collection boxes located at Felsbury Plaza relocated to a location on the property that does not abut residential parcels.

384
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:06,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Knight.

385
00:29:06,608 --> 00:29:07,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

386
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:28,141
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been an ongoing issue in our community for a number of years, so much so that this council took the initiative to implement, just last meeting, a donation box ordinance that would give the building commissioner enhanced powers and responsibilities, as well as the city some control over the regulation of these types of businesses located in our community.

387
00:29:29,261 --> 00:29:33,684
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the largest violators, biggest offenders of

388
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:38,130
[SPEAKER_04]: overflowing donation boxes would be the Felsway Plaza, Mr. President.

389
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:42,673
[SPEAKER_04]: And a number of years ago, a resident had brought their concerns to my attention.

390
00:29:42,773 --> 00:29:46,396
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was something I think that we needed to take a look at, we needed to act on.

391
00:29:46,857 --> 00:29:59,707
[SPEAKER_04]: And many numbers behind this rail have also taken a position that this is something that needs to be addressed, so much so that the council was able to pass an ordinance, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, moving this initiative through first reading.

392
00:30:00,492 --> 00:30:09,255
[SPEAKER_04]: But currently, Mr. President, the ordinance has not passed and we need some relief in the neighborhoods related to Felsway Plaza and the location of some of the drop boxes that they placed there.

393
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:23,421
[SPEAKER_04]: So I bring this paper forward requesting that the code enforcement officer through the building commissioner's office take the necessary steps to have these donation bins relocated to a spot where there will not be a budding residential parcel, Mr. President.

394
00:30:23,481 --> 00:30:25,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I ask my council colleagues to support this measure.

395
00:30:25,622 --> 00:30:27,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

396
00:30:27,462 --> 00:30:28,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

397
00:30:29,365 --> 00:30:30,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President, I bring this forward.

398
00:30:31,546 --> 00:30:39,128
[SPEAKER_03]: I too received a few phone calls as soon as these eyesores were put back into place.

399
00:30:39,749 --> 00:30:43,270
[SPEAKER_03]: And not only what was there, but now I heard that they've doubled.

400
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:50,472
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we're hearing and what we're seeing is exactly why we will move forward with the ordinance.

401
00:30:50,572 --> 00:30:58,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Public safety being one, the idea of road infestation, and then again, the eyesore for abutters

402
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:07,914
[SPEAKER_03]: wake up and step on the front porch and see these four donation bins that, from what we were told, even the property owner doesn't know who they belong to.

403
00:31:08,354 --> 00:31:11,055
[SPEAKER_03]: We put the ordinance into place.

404
00:31:11,895 --> 00:31:16,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I've called the building department, the code enforcement officer.

405
00:31:16,637 --> 00:31:27,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that Mr. Murky was working on this as soon as possible to make something happen, to get rid of these, remove these donation bins that,

406
00:31:27,942 --> 00:31:30,443
[SPEAKER_03]: question whether they're donation bins or for profit.

407
00:31:30,843 --> 00:31:34,744
[SPEAKER_03]: We truly don't know, but I know that something has to be done.

408
00:31:35,464 --> 00:31:42,346
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know we await the passing of the ordinance that this council worked so hard to put forward to make sure this doesn't happen.

409
00:31:42,386 --> 00:31:56,110
[SPEAKER_03]: But here we are in the middle of the night, someone comes in and just drops four bins right in front of their home with piles of snow and these projecting out.

410
00:31:57,223 --> 00:32:10,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Drivers either entering Fellsway Plaza and cars leaving the plaza are having a difficult time to see and are causing a very dangerous situation for our residents and shoppers in that area.

411
00:32:10,952 --> 00:32:16,316
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for bringing this forward Councilor Knight and hope we see some movement quickly.

412
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

413
00:32:20,298 --> 00:32:23,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank Councilor Knight for putting this on tonight.

414
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:27,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Indeed, there are a number of these drop boxes throughout the community.

415
00:32:28,499 --> 00:32:36,781
[SPEAKER_02]: The Fells Plaza over the last many years has been an issue of concern to many area residents and as well as this council.

416
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:43,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Many calls have been made to the property owner of Fells Plaza to no avail, to be quite frank.

417
00:32:43,803 --> 00:32:44,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Recently, Mr. President,

418
00:32:45,364 --> 00:32:55,172
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a number of drop boxes that were located, if you're familiar with it, at the entrance of where Aldi's is, that goes into the Fells Plaza.

419
00:32:55,532 --> 00:32:57,854
[SPEAKER_02]: And the drop boxes are right next to the entrance.

420
00:32:58,274 --> 00:33:03,718
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're pulling in, you can't see the cars that are inside the lot that are coming towards you.

421
00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:06,460
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very, very dangerous situation.

422
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:14,787
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though we have an ordinance now that hasn't been signed, but will be signed shortly, you can't legislate common sense.

423
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:29,046
[SPEAKER_02]: And common sense would dictate that you don't put these giant mountains of steel next to an entrance and an exit, because it's very difficult to see cars coming and going into the lot.

424
00:33:29,747 --> 00:33:32,329
[SPEAKER_02]: And it creates a safety concern, Mr. President.

425
00:33:32,689 --> 00:33:37,834
[SPEAKER_02]: And even for pedestrians walking by that area, there are a lot of people that walk the Fells Way.

426
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:49,388
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very dangerous area to walk because of these boxes obstruct vehicles view of oncoming pedestrians or oncoming traffic, which is extremely dangerous.

427
00:33:50,468 --> 00:33:56,312
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope that we can get some results immediately by having these boxes.

428
00:33:56,693 --> 00:34:01,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with vice president should be removed.

429
00:34:02,343 --> 00:34:22,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, there's a giant area in the back of the Fells Plaza that you can drive, and maybe that should be where there's signage put for any drop-off blocks for the Fells Plaza, that they'd be located behind the Fells Plaza, which is a safe area and somewhere people can drop donations.

430
00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:29,344
[SPEAKER_02]: That area has also become an area where you leave off discarded old TVs, old computers,

431
00:34:30,077 --> 00:34:34,399
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, old clothing, you name it, it's been left out there.

432
00:34:34,819 --> 00:34:36,239
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't blame the area residents.

433
00:34:36,279 --> 00:34:54,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we have an area resident, Mr. Poley, up here tonight that would like to speak on the issue, Mr. President, that lives across the street and has to deal with the unsightliness of these boxes and the public health concern with these boxes on a daily basis.

434
00:34:55,466 --> 00:34:57,527
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to thank my colleague again for putting this on.

435
00:34:58,555 --> 00:34:59,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor.

436
00:34:59,215 --> 00:34:59,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco.

437
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:00,816
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

438
00:35:00,856 --> 00:35:05,138
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to also thank Vice President Knight for putting this on the agenda tonight.

439
00:35:05,178 --> 00:35:11,941
[SPEAKER_13]: This has been a continuous issue, an absolutely continuous issue that has gone on for years.

440
00:35:13,022 --> 00:35:14,302
[SPEAKER_13]: You're right, we worked out an ordinance.

441
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:15,343
[SPEAKER_13]: We have an ordinance drafted.

442
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:21,865
[SPEAKER_13]: It passed its first reading, and soon we'll have something in place that has some teeth in it that can help us manage this.

443
00:35:22,006 --> 00:35:24,767
[SPEAKER_13]: But for the time being, this does need to be addressed.

444
00:35:25,507 --> 00:35:27,308
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's gone on far too long.

445
00:35:28,234 --> 00:35:34,759
[SPEAKER_13]: As my council colleagues have mentioned, it's a safety issue, but I think one of the big things is it's a quality of life issue.

446
00:35:34,779 --> 00:35:38,101
[SPEAKER_13]: For anyone that lives in that neighborhood, this is a quality of life issue.

447
00:35:38,581 --> 00:35:40,383
[SPEAKER_13]: They get up, they have to see this every day.

448
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:44,406
[SPEAKER_13]: One of our residents sent me a video once, it was on fire.

449
00:35:44,526 --> 00:35:46,307
[SPEAKER_13]: It was literally fire pouring out of the box.

450
00:35:47,448 --> 00:35:48,609
[SPEAKER_13]: You shouldn't have to see that.

451
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:51,090
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you shouldn't have to look out your window and see that.

452
00:35:51,731 --> 00:35:55,994
[SPEAKER_13]: Trash everywhere, things backed up, more outside the box than in the box.

453
00:35:57,776 --> 00:35:58,436
[SPEAKER_13]: It's ridiculous.

454
00:35:58,496 --> 00:35:59,517
[SPEAKER_13]: It needs to be addressed.

455
00:35:59,997 --> 00:36:09,643
[SPEAKER_13]: I asked, I agreed with my colleagues that the code enforcement or someone from the building department needs to contact the owner and really take some action here and make sure that this gets resolved.

456
00:36:10,063 --> 00:36:12,385
[SPEAKER_13]: But vice president, I thank you for bringing this forward tonight.

457
00:36:12,945 --> 00:36:14,506
[SPEAKER_13]: And I second the motion.

458
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:15,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

459
00:36:15,687 --> 00:36:20,049
[SPEAKER_14]: And if I could get your mail in two cents, you know, I was by the yesterday.

460
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:23,071
[SPEAKER_14]: There was no phone number on the box or company where it belongs to.

461
00:36:23,512 --> 00:36:27,134
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, what spurred me to put the,

462
00:36:28,155 --> 00:36:35,718
[SPEAKER_14]: the motion on last year for the ordinance to do this, was I had talked to somebody from another box.

463
00:36:36,158 --> 00:36:46,503
[SPEAKER_14]: And he explained to me, and he helped me out with the ordinances, and he also gave me the number to the company that's over the Fells Plaza.

464
00:36:46,523 --> 00:36:50,844
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think a lot of people understand that there's three different companies that own the Fells Plaza.

465
00:36:51,605 --> 00:36:56,787
[SPEAKER_14]: And the company had no idea that those boxes, and they were there for almost a year.

466
00:36:57,527 --> 00:36:58,087
[SPEAKER_14]: that they were there.

467
00:36:58,267 --> 00:37:02,370
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, I don't even know if the owners of that part, the fellows even know that it's there.

468
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:08,053
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, I do support my fellow Councilors' motions to have this cleaned up again.

469
00:37:08,433 --> 00:37:11,434
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we have somebody in presence that would like to speak on this?

470
00:37:14,516 --> 00:37:14,936
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

471
00:37:14,976 --> 00:37:16,157
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

472
00:37:16,177 --> 00:37:19,198
[SPEAKER_15]: 669 Felsway.

473
00:37:20,459 --> 00:37:25,001
[SPEAKER_15]: I lived there 51 years of my life, and I've never seen such a disgrace in my life.

474
00:37:26,836 --> 00:37:29,977
[SPEAKER_15]: They had removed, I got videos that caught on fire.

475
00:37:30,617 --> 00:37:32,678
[SPEAKER_15]: I have videos that they made mess.

476
00:37:32,938 --> 00:37:34,819
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe last year they removed everything.

477
00:37:35,259 --> 00:37:42,201
[SPEAKER_15]: They came in with a bobcat, a flatbed to remove all these bins that had babies that appeared.

478
00:37:43,282 --> 00:37:46,083
[SPEAKER_15]: They have two more babies and they appeared again.

479
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:52,225
[SPEAKER_15]: It might be a good cause for these bins.

480
00:37:53,049 --> 00:37:59,935
[SPEAKER_15]: They tell me it's for kids with cancer, kids, people that, houses catch on fire, they need clothing.

481
00:38:00,716 --> 00:38:02,458
[SPEAKER_15]: But we're in the middle of a pandemic here.

482
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:04,860
[SPEAKER_15]: I see people dying every day.

483
00:38:05,621 --> 00:38:12,927
[SPEAKER_15]: I work at Melrose Wakeville Hospital, and I do the sign on the cross every time I walk by the, where they put the dead people in.

484
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:14,149
[SPEAKER_15]: It's sad.

485
00:38:15,009 --> 00:38:18,793
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, they're gonna catch diseases from this.

486
00:38:19,552 --> 00:38:25,415
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what sanitation they go through to wash these clothes.

487
00:38:26,015 --> 00:38:34,799
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want them relocated back, like Mr. Mark says, in the back of the plaza, where it belongs, near the trash compactor.

488
00:38:34,819 --> 00:38:35,099
[SPEAKER_15]: Who cares?

489
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,580
[SPEAKER_15]: They're going to be washed.

490
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,460
[SPEAKER_15]: They're going to be sanitized.

491
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:46,544
[SPEAKER_15]: And those people that have Facebook, that are on Facebook for this, live across the street from there.

492
00:38:47,063 --> 00:38:52,728
[SPEAKER_15]: They tell me, oh, I got two lanes, I got a sidewalk, I got this, I got that, I'm five distance.

493
00:38:53,048 --> 00:38:55,450
[SPEAKER_15]: I open my window and I see this in front of my house.

494
00:38:56,171 --> 00:38:56,752
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a disgrace.

495
00:38:57,312 --> 00:39:02,457
[SPEAKER_15]: People get off the T, see the bags of clothing.

496
00:39:02,737 --> 00:39:04,558
[SPEAKER_15]: They walk by, they shuffle through it.

497
00:39:04,899 --> 00:39:05,599
[SPEAKER_15]: It's disgusting.

498
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,684
[SPEAKER_15]: They go through that and I think it's disgusting.

499
00:39:12,405 --> 00:39:13,847
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you for, you know,

500
00:39:15,106 --> 00:39:16,166
[SPEAKER_15]: putting this on the agenda.

501
00:39:16,186 --> 00:39:20,248
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for all you guys do with this pandemic going on.

502
00:39:21,209 --> 00:39:22,029
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys are well-deserved.

503
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:23,910
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll give you a round of applause.

504
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,150
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Foley.

505
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:25,911
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

506
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:26,191

[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

00:39:27,892 --> 00:39:28,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

511
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:28,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

512
00:39:28,452 --> 00:39:28,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

513
00:39:28,752 --> 00:39:29,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

514
00:39:29,032 --> 00:39:29,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

00:39:31,053 --> 00:39:31,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

00:39:31,273 --> 00:39:31,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

522
00:39:31,633 --> 00:39:31,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

523
00:39:31,933 --> 00:39:32,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

524
00:39:32,174 --> 00:39:32,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

525
00:39:32,874 --> 00:39:33,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

526
00:39:33,254 --> 00:39:33,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

00:39:33,514 --> 00:39:33,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

528
00:39:33,814 --> 00:39:34,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

00:39:34,074 --> 00:39:34,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

00:39:34,274 --> 00:39:34,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

531
00:39:34,475 --> 00:39:34,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

532
00:39:34,675 --> 00:39:34,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

533
00:39:34,975 --> 00:39:35,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

534
00:39:35,655 --> 00:39:35,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

535
00:39:35,955 --> 00:39:36,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

536
00:39:36,175 --> 00:39:36,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

537
00:39:36,455 --> 00:39:36,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

538
00:39:36,716 --> 00:39:36,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

00:39:36,936 --> 00:39:37,116

00:39:38,336 --> 00:39:38,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

546
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:39,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

547
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:39,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

548
00:39:39,557 --> 00:39:39,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

549
00:39:39,797 --> 00:39:39,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

550
00:39:40,017 --> 00:39:40,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

551
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:40,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

552
00:39:40,637 --> 00:39:41,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

553
00:39:41,578 --> 00:39:41,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

554
00:39:41,818 --> 00:39:42,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

555
00:39:42,038 --> 00:39:42,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

556
00:39:42,438 --> 00:39:42,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

557
00:39:42,658 --> 00:39:42,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

558
00:39:42,858 --> 00:39:43,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

559
00:39:43,058 --> 00:39:43,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

560
00:39:43,338 --> 00:39:43,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

561
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:43,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

562
00:39:43,819 --> 00:39:43,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

563
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:44,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

564
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:44,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

565
00:39:44,992 --> 00:39:47,212
[SPEAKER_03]: there's an open space that they could be utilized.

566
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:58,154
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think it's, you know, for the cause, we're right, it's important, but as long as it's maintained and it's put in the proper place, we would support it.

567
00:39:58,174 --> 00:40:03,435
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we, you know, some of the issues we put into the, stipulations we put into the ordinance.

568
00:40:03,475 --> 00:40:11,877
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'll be interesting to see, but again, I apologize that you have to go through this again, Mr. Foley, and thank you for coming up here this evening to share your information.

569
00:40:14,297 --> 00:40:15,178
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

570
00:40:15,198 --> 00:40:15,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President.

571
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:16,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks.

572
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:26,405
[SPEAKER_02]: While we have Mr. Poli here too, he's been a big advocate of placing a pedestrian crosswalk on the Felsway.

573
00:40:27,326 --> 00:40:40,855
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the intersection of Bradbury and the Felsway in particular, there is a current crosswalk there now, but you take your life in your hand crossing because there's no pedestrian controls there.

574
00:40:41,646 --> 00:40:51,109
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happens is you're in a crosswalk, you think you're safe, and the minute the light turns green at Wellington Circle, that becomes a raceway.

575
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:55,930
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good half a mile stretch that it becomes a raceway.

576
00:40:56,270 --> 00:41:02,432
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're caught midway and that fails, let me tell you, trying to cross, you are in trouble.

577
00:41:02,772 --> 00:41:04,272
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see it happen constantly.

578
00:41:04,652 --> 00:41:06,613
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know Mr. Poli has been a big advocate

579
00:41:06,946 --> 00:41:16,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this council has voted on several occasions asking our state delegation to look at putting an active pedestrian crossing right there, which is needed.

580
00:41:16,528 --> 00:41:29,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight we'll be voting on a paper 21-068 from the administration asking that they put a transportation engineer from the money we're getting from Wynn Resorts, Mr. President.

581
00:41:29,731 --> 00:41:35,552
[SPEAKER_02]: And much of that money is targeted for transportation and safety improvements in the Wellington area.

582
00:41:36,522 --> 00:41:41,723
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell you firsthand, there hasn't been much improvement in the Wellington area.

583
00:41:42,003 --> 00:41:57,427
[SPEAKER_02]: With all this new development going on, that area has received very little upkeep and very little in regards to safety initiatives for pedestrians and vehicular traffic and so forth.

584
00:41:57,447 --> 00:42:05,069
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would ask Mr. President as part of this resolution that we send another message to our state delegation

585
00:42:05,667 --> 00:42:17,092
[SPEAKER_02]: asking about an update for a crosswalk at the corner of Bradbury and the Felsway, a pedestrian crossing in the interest of public safety.

586
00:42:18,432 --> 00:42:19,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

587
00:42:21,533 --> 00:42:24,435
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, any further, excuse me, Paul C has his hand up.

588
00:42:24,455 --> 00:42:26,095
[SPEAKER_14]: Paul C, name and address of the record, please.

589
00:42:28,016 --> 00:42:29,757
[SPEAKER_00]: Unmute.

590
00:42:29,817 --> 00:42:35,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Camuso, 114 Lincoln Road, Medford Mass, here in our fine community.

591
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:39,904
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I want to thank the Honorable Vice President Knight for bringing this up tonight.

592
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:43,567
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is an issue that has been championed for a long time.

593
00:42:43,867 --> 00:42:49,512
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember Councilor Marks bringing up this very particular issue when I was a member of the City Council.

594
00:42:49,893 --> 00:42:51,114
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is an easy fix.

595
00:42:51,554 --> 00:42:57,119
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't something that has to be long debated like the issue that I appeared on last week, which has, you know,

596
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,081
[SPEAKER_00]: brought up several more issues.

597
00:43:00,121 --> 00:43:06,305
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been called from community members regarding Oak Grove Cemetery, for instance, regarding that matter in cleaning up the leaves in the fall.

598
00:43:06,345 --> 00:43:12,589
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll be at the committee of the whole meeting to discuss that, because I know my loved ones are very concerned about the leaves at Oak Grove Cemetery.

599
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:15,231
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is something that can be done easy.

600
00:43:15,531 --> 00:43:19,814
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the rents down there at Felsway Plaza are in the area of $30,000 plus a month.

601
00:43:20,835 --> 00:43:25,698
[SPEAKER_00]: They have made several beautification projects on that facility.

602
00:43:26,111 --> 00:43:28,592
[SPEAKER_00]: but I have to agree with Mr. Poli.

603
00:43:29,252 --> 00:43:32,334
[SPEAKER_00]: The people of Wellington do not deserve to look at that albatross.

604
00:43:32,834 --> 00:43:36,535
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember last year there was a fire out there right behind that box.

605
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:40,217
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone threw a cigarette, the mulch went up and then half of the box.

606
00:43:40,257 --> 00:43:43,318
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do what we have to do to maintain our neighborhoods.

607
00:43:43,638 --> 00:43:51,361
[SPEAKER_00]: The top job as a city councilor is meeting the needs of the constituents in all these neighborhoods throughout the community and the councilors that are sitting there doing just that.

608
00:43:51,781 --> 00:43:52,942
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanna commend you.

609
00:43:54,322 --> 00:43:54,763
[SPEAKER_00]: Furthermore,

610
00:43:56,795 --> 00:43:59,637
[SPEAKER_00]: on a few other upcoming agenda items.

611
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:04,420
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's important to keep doing the people's business.

612
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,561
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're showing a continuity in government.

613
00:44:06,641 --> 00:44:10,823
[SPEAKER_00]: People are down there doing the people's business week after week, and it doesn't go unnoticed.

614
00:44:10,903 --> 00:44:21,289
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanna tell you, councilors, this pandemic is slowing a lot of things down, but the Medford City Council is still meeting at City Hall on Tuesday nights, getting the job done that you're voted in there to do.

615
00:44:21,629 --> 00:44:23,170
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanna commend all of you.

616
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:26,052
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you very much for listening.

617
00:44:27,479 --> 00:44:28,779
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, former Councilor Camusa.

618
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Any further discussion on this?

619
00:44:34,081 --> 00:44:43,804
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, on the motion by Vice President Knight, as amended by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Scapelli.

620
00:44:43,824 --> 00:44:45,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

621
00:44:52,787 --> 00:44:53,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Bears?

622
00:44:53,967 --> 00:44:54,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

623
00:44:55,408 --> 00:44:56,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco?

624
00:44:56,168 --> 00:44:56,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

625
00:44:57,756 --> 00:44:58,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

626
00:44:59,996 --> 00:45:00,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

627
00:45:02,017 --> 00:45:02,257
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

628
00:45:03,997 --> 00:45:04,397
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

629
00:45:05,778 --> 00:45:09,758
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, seven affirmative motion passes.

630
00:45:10,178 --> 00:45:21,721
[SPEAKER_14]: 21067 offered by Vice President Knight being resolved at the Medford City Council request a copy of all the materials presented at the 211 CAC meeting.

631
00:45:22,041 --> 00:45:22,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Knight.

632
00:45:23,709 --> 00:45:24,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

633
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:29,313
[SPEAKER_04]: As I had stated earlier in the meeting, the Cannabis Advisory Commission has been meeting.

634
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:35,497
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, today at 530, we met and we talked about the financial circumstances surrounding our community.

635
00:45:35,577 --> 00:45:39,939
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking at anywhere between a five and a half and $8 million structural deficit.

636
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,422
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need to come up with ways to generate revenues.

637
00:45:44,102 --> 00:45:52,047
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of those ways that we can generate these revenues, Mr. President, is by enacting the voter approved

638
00:45:52,437 --> 00:45:54,397
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana dispensaries here in the city of Medford.

639
00:45:55,117 --> 00:45:58,978
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the 11th, I did understand there was a meeting.

640
00:45:59,058 --> 00:46:03,759
[SPEAKER_04]: I logged into the meeting and I watched a portion of it, and it did raise some concerns.

641
00:46:04,479 --> 00:46:16,601
[SPEAKER_04]: This council, when it met and crafted the ordinance for the Cannabis Advisory Commission, did so in a fashion that was very cognizant of number one, the mayor's reported conflict of interest.

642
00:46:17,821 --> 00:46:21,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two, keeping politics out of the selection process.

643
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:39,971
[SPEAKER_04]: And number three, ensuring that through the screening and application process, the entities that are going to be responsible for regulating these type of businesses in the community would have a large say in who gets to get a good score going forward to negotiate a host community agreement with the administration.

644
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:46,035
[SPEAKER_04]: The administration seemed to have quite a hands-on role in the last meeting.

645
00:46:46,215 --> 00:46:50,478
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit concerning to me because the legislative intent was to keep the administration separate.

646
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:57,574
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason the council structured it that way was because the administration is going to be responsible for negotiating the host community agreement.

647
00:46:58,595 --> 00:47:04,878
[SPEAKER_04]: So the administration was kind enough to provide us with the materials that were presented at the 2-11 meeting.

648
00:47:06,439 --> 00:47:09,801
[SPEAKER_04]: The 2-11 meeting wasn't called by the commission, it was called by the mayor's office.

649
00:47:09,962 --> 00:47:11,543
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like us calling a school committee meeting.

650
00:47:11,583 --> 00:47:14,584
[SPEAKER_04]: We're the city council, we're not the school committee, we can't call a school committee meeting.

651
00:47:15,325 --> 00:47:20,388
[SPEAKER_04]: The Cannabis Advisory Council has an outline responsibility in the ordinance, it's a duty.

652
00:47:20,937 --> 00:47:22,677
[SPEAKER_04]: that they have to follow through with, Mr. President.

653
00:47:23,118 --> 00:47:31,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And in looking at the materials that have been submitted, I haven't had a chance to give it a good glance because it was sitting on my desk when I got in here this evening.

654
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:44,984
[SPEAKER_04]: But it appears that they have put forward a proposed scoring system that adds weight to certain criteria more so than others.

655
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:49,365
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's really determination that the Canvas Advisory Commission should be making.

656
00:47:50,053 --> 00:47:52,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I'm a little concerned about how this is going.

657
00:47:52,874 --> 00:48:09,297
[SPEAKER_04]: But with that being said, Mr. President, I think the biggest concern that everybody has in here is that the mayor has this conflict of interest that she's expressed time and time again when it comes down to the issue of implementing the will of the voters and creating legislation that would authorize the marijuana dispensaries here in the community.

658
00:48:09,857 --> 00:48:14,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so at this point in time, Mr. President, I'd just like to ask the administration to disclose

659
00:48:14,772 --> 00:48:18,434
[SPEAKER_04]: their conflict of interest to provide the council with a copy of the conflict of interest opinion.

660
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:20,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that's a public documents, public record.

661
00:48:21,216 --> 00:48:28,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so that maybe some of these concerns could be set to rest because, uh, one of the biggest things that we want to ensure Mr. President is that we do this the right way.

662
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,782
[SPEAKER_04]: And the last thing we want is people in orange jumpsuits when this is all done.

663
00:48:32,463 --> 00:48:38,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so with that being said, you know, I want to make sure that everything's done about bar, um, and that, you know, every individual gets a fair shake.

664
00:48:38,887 --> 00:48:40,888
[SPEAKER_04]: It does apply investment application.

665
00:48:41,517 --> 00:48:48,542
[SPEAKER_04]: And understanding what this conflict of interest is, I think will be very helpful in us in alleviating some of our fears and concerns moving forward.

666
00:48:49,282 --> 00:48:56,207
[SPEAKER_04]: The administration has made quite a pledge to transparency throughout many press releases and campaign pledges that have been made.

667
00:48:56,607 --> 00:48:59,949
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see that that transparency pledge should apply here.

668
00:48:59,969 --> 00:49:01,150
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be looked at.

669
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:04,052
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to approve the measure.

670
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:05,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

671
00:49:06,133 --> 00:49:06,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears.

672
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:08,554
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

673
00:49:08,594 --> 00:49:10,836
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank Councilor Knight for putting this on the agenda.

674
00:49:11,642 --> 00:49:21,430
[SPEAKER_11]: and I agree, you know, having this process move swiftly and in accordance with the ordinance is important for raising the revenue the city so urgently needs.

675
00:49:22,511 --> 00:49:26,675
[SPEAKER_11]: And I agree with Councilor Knight's request for the conflict of interest letter as well.

676
00:49:27,115 --> 00:49:28,857
[SPEAKER_11]: I just had one question for the administration.

677
00:49:28,877 --> 00:49:30,378
[SPEAKER_11]: I do see Chief of Staff Rodriguez.

678
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:37,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Was the mayor personally involved in these meetings and setting up this meeting or any of the materials therein?

679
00:49:40,726 --> 00:49:41,987
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Roderick, is he still on the call?

680
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:43,308
[SPEAKER_14]: Dave, you on the call?

681
00:49:45,729 --> 00:49:46,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, thank you, Mr. President.

682
00:49:46,769 --> 00:49:47,290
[SPEAKER_08]: No, she wasn't.

683
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:59,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the materials were prepared by staff in order to support the committee's efforts and the individuals that were selected by the council to serve on that committee and to do the actual evaluations.

684
00:50:01,354 --> 00:50:04,436
[SPEAKER_08]: probably the five busiest people in the city administration.

685
00:50:05,097 --> 00:50:24,693
[SPEAKER_08]: So the workflow was designed in order to support that and to make the value judgments be theirs, but to support them in any possible way that we can, to make sure that we can work through the timelines that were established by the council, work through things to be clean, quick, transparent, and every effort's being made to do that.

686
00:50:24,893 --> 00:50:27,675
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's support, but every decision is being made by the CAC.

687
00:50:29,792 --> 00:50:31,434
[SPEAKER_08]: to speak to the conflict question.

688
00:50:32,214 --> 00:50:43,042
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor did file a disclosure that's been on file with the city clerk for a few months now, that's available for public viewing, and that could be dispersed at the clerk's discretion whenever he feels the need.

689
00:50:44,463 --> 00:50:45,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President?

690
00:50:49,587 --> 00:50:51,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilman Bench?

691
00:50:51,208 --> 00:50:52,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Just kind of a follow-up to that.

692
00:50:54,216 --> 00:51:00,738
[SPEAKER_11]: What staff are supporting the CAC, and did the CAC itself request specific staff support?

693
00:51:03,379 --> 00:51:09,201
[SPEAKER_08]: The staff support is Victor Schrader, who's the economic development director, who you all had a chance to work through.

694
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:11,281
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they didn't select it.

695
00:51:13,162 --> 00:51:18,504
[SPEAKER_08]: This was done as part of a workflow management system on a workflow management plan to help the CAC with their work.

696
00:51:21,104 --> 00:51:21,584
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, thank you.

697
00:51:22,805 --> 00:51:23,125
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

698
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:30,073
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Mr. Rodrigue, while I get you on the call, has the mayor signed the ordinance yet?

699
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:31,094
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

700
00:51:31,114 --> 00:51:32,875
[SPEAKER_14]: She has, all right, thank you.

701
00:51:33,395 --> 00:51:42,861
[SPEAKER_14]: And if I could ask the clerk, if he could send us the letter with the conflict of interest would be appreciated.

702
00:51:45,322 --> 00:51:46,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Paul C has his hand up.

703
00:51:46,843 --> 00:51:47,864
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record, please.

704
00:51:49,641 --> 00:51:50,562
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

705
00:51:50,822 --> 00:51:55,387
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Camuso, once again, 114 Lincoln Road here in our fine community.

706
00:51:55,927 --> 00:51:58,890
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this up this evening.

707
00:51:59,271 --> 00:52:06,117
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is a very unique opportunity for the city of Medford to bring in new non-tax revenue, which is very important.

708
00:52:06,598 --> 00:52:11,543
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is the revenues that we should be going after, not trying to take more money out of people's pockets.

709
00:52:12,323 --> 00:52:16,647
[SPEAKER_00]: that might be living on fixed incomes and other things throughout this community.

710
00:52:16,948 --> 00:52:18,329
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a unique opportunity.

711
00:52:18,369 --> 00:52:25,796
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to try to maximize and hold the people that wanna come in accountable to benefit this community.

712
00:52:26,236 --> 00:52:32,082
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would have liked to seen this done over the last two or three years before other communities had this off the ground.

713
00:52:32,502 --> 00:52:37,166
[SPEAKER_00]: For whatever reason, it stalled under the past city solicitor, but I'm glad you guys got it to this.

714
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:43,609
[SPEAKER_00]: point where we're at today, working with the administration, and I think you have to bring in value with this.

715
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:46,050
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a good opportunity.

716
00:52:46,511 --> 00:53:02,897
[SPEAKER_00]: It's overwhelmingly been supported by the voters in our community, so it's a good source of new non-tax revenue to bring in that can do many good things in this community under the leadership of the mayor's office and this honorable body by putting the money to good use where you see fit.

717
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:08,529
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get going and get out there and bring home the bacon as they say.

718
00:53:09,169 --> 00:53:09,750
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks guys.

719
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:11,830
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for Councilor Camuso.

720
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:13,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further questions?

721
00:53:13,671 --> 00:53:14,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President.

722
00:53:14,831 --> 00:53:15,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks.

723
00:53:16,372 --> 00:53:34,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I would also ask like we do with most boards and commissions in this community that they hold meetings where we can receive the most community participation and to have a four o'clock meeting in my opinion is not advantageous to attracting a wide amount

724
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,562
[SPEAKER_02]: of people into this meeting.

725
00:53:36,962 --> 00:53:54,976
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would ask that they look, I know they scheduled one for February 18th at 4 p.m., but in their next meetings, if they can respectfully look at making this meeting at a later time, Mr. President, for the, to allow for the most input from Method residents.

726
00:53:55,897 --> 00:53:56,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Council Member.

727
00:53:56,717 --> 00:53:57,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

728
00:53:57,518 --> 00:53:58,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further questions?

729
00:53:58,939 --> 00:54:03,823
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, on the motion by Vice President Knight, as amended by Council, sorry?

730
00:54:04,566 --> 00:54:06,168
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just I have one more question.

731
00:54:06,928 --> 00:54:09,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, just the previous comments brought up a thought for me.

732
00:54:10,132 --> 00:54:20,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Rodriguez, are you aware of any impacts of the litigation and Cannabis Control Commission's, you know, discussions around host community agreements and how that might impact the process here?

733
00:54:21,867 --> 00:54:31,452
[SPEAKER_08]: We are closely monitoring that legislation as well as the SJC cases that were heard a couple weeks ago that involved the Salem and Marshfield communities.

734
00:54:31,632 --> 00:54:35,074
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are keeping a very close eye on those particular cases as well as that legislation.

735
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:50,962
[SPEAKER_08]: From what I understand of the ordinance and of the process that's been set up, that will not currently affect how we do things, but that could change based upon the structure of the legislation that's passed at the state level or regulation that's passed by the CCC.

736
00:54:52,633 --> 00:54:53,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

737
00:54:54,754 --> 00:54:55,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Rodriguez.

738
00:54:55,994 --> 00:55:06,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, on the motion offered by Vice President Knight as amended by Vice President Knight and amended by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Falco.

739
00:55:07,058 --> 00:55:08,478
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

740
00:55:11,999 --> 00:55:12,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Bears.

741
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:13,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

742
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:15,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco.

[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

747
00:55:19,121 --> 00:55:19,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

748
00:55:19,922 --> 00:55:20,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Morell.

749
00:55:20,982 --> 00:55:21,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

750
00:55:22,283 --> 00:55:23,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli?

751
00:55:23,123 --> 00:55:23,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

752
00:55:23,603 --> 00:55:24,424
[SPEAKER_03]: President Caraviello?

753
00:55:24,524 --> 00:55:26,384
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, 70 affirmative, motion passes.

754
00:55:26,845 --> 00:55:45,491
[SPEAKER_14]: Communications from the mayor, 21-068, to the honorable president and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford Mass, dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body accept under the Massachusetts General Laws of 2020, chapter 325, to appropriate 75,000

755
00:55:50,609 --> 00:56:05,539
[SPEAKER_14]: $81.00 from the Method Casino Special Revenue Fund to fund a staffed transportation engineer position within the non-union cap dash 11 pay range $63,540.70 to $75,680.39.

756
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:09,742
[SPEAKER_14]: This request is in compliance with the Method and Wynn Casino Surrounding Community Impact Agreement

757
00:56:20,103 --> 00:56:23,944
[SPEAKER_14]: specifically the transportation hub payment.

758
00:56:24,284 --> 00:56:28,045
[SPEAKER_14]: City engineer Tim McGibbon is present to answer any of the City Council's questions.

759
00:56:28,065 --> 00:56:32,646
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a role with the Gaming Commission that I represent the City of Medford.

760
00:56:43,411 --> 00:56:46,172
[SPEAKER_14]: that oversees the funding of this year.

761
00:56:46,573 --> 00:56:47,913
[SPEAKER_14]: And I also chaired that commission.

762
00:56:47,953 --> 00:56:52,435
[SPEAKER_14]: So at this point, I will turn the meeting over to Councilor Marks to run it.

763
00:56:52,715 --> 00:56:53,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

764
00:56:54,096 --> 00:56:59,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I too, as the alternate to the gaming commission, will be joining you in a recusal.

765
00:57:07,201 --> 00:57:07,841
[SPEAKER_16]: President Marks.

766
00:57:08,742 --> 00:57:09,502
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Falco.

767
00:57:09,922 --> 00:57:10,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

768
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:15,091
[SPEAKER_13]: If I may, did you say Tim McGivern's on the line?

769
00:57:16,731 --> 00:57:17,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe he is.

770
00:57:17,812 --> 00:57:19,072
[SPEAKER_02]: City Engineer, are you on the line?

771
00:57:23,393 --> 00:57:23,753
[SPEAKER_09]: I am here.

772
00:57:26,034 --> 00:57:32,155
[SPEAKER_13]: Tim, yes, if you could please tell us a little bit more about the position, what the person will be doing, and is this in addition to Todd Blake, or is this... Sure.

773
00:57:33,556 --> 00:57:34,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Could you give us a little bit more detail?

774
00:57:35,658 --> 00:57:41,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely, and Chief of Staff David Rodriguez may chime in, and we have Todd here as well.

775
00:57:41,502 --> 00:57:44,084
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll get the three of us to answer whatever questions may come up.

776
00:57:44,784 --> 00:57:55,511
[SPEAKER_09]: But basically, I think as everybody is aware, there are traffic and road impacts in general from just increased use of our roadways.

777
00:57:56,452 --> 00:57:57,372
[SPEAKER_09]: We talk about it all the time.

778
00:57:57,833 --> 00:58:01,035
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the contributors is obviously Wynn Casino, and as you

779
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:09,163
[SPEAKER_09]: are aware they're providing surrounding community agreement funding to help resolve some of these impacts.

780
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:17,707
[SPEAKER_09]: And it just so happens to align with the increased workload that Todd has been seeing over the past year, especially.

781
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:21,449
[SPEAKER_09]: And since I've started, I'm sure he's been one of the busiest people that I know.

782
00:58:24,115 --> 00:58:39,442
[SPEAKER_09]: basically what we tried to do is take advantage of the SCA funds and to try to see where we can satisfy those needs as well as help meet some of the goals in the engineering office and for the city.

783
00:58:40,362 --> 00:58:43,764
[SPEAKER_09]: So this person would be mostly assisting Todd in his work.

784
00:58:44,464 --> 00:58:51,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the things that we fall short on in the engineering office, private development review, traffic management plan review,

785
00:58:51,794 --> 00:59:01,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and as the council mentioned, there's a focus on the Wellington area, uh, and also mentioned tonight, there are impacts that hit the Wellington area more severe.

786
00:59:01,661 --> 00:59:20,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, so, you know, we're taking a look at projects in that area and we're taking a look at what they mean by the surrounding area, which, um, you know, the Wellington study that's going on right now sort of takes a big piece of Medford, uh, to consider the, the sort of the contributing area of Wellington station.

787
00:59:21,153 --> 00:59:32,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, my personal opinion is all of Medford is going to be impacted, is being impacted, uh, and, um, needs improvement and assistance in the roadway safety, transportation safety world.

788
00:59:32,758 --> 00:59:39,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so this would include things like field assistance, data collection, uh, for things like traffic counts, uh, even GIS data.

789
00:59:40,341 --> 00:59:47,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and like I was talking about it as development comes, because one of the things that's going to happen, development comes with, with things that are near transit stations.

790
00:59:47,464 --> 00:59:49,145
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're already sort of, um,

791
00:59:50,175 --> 01:00:01,462
[SPEAKER_09]: know what that demand is just from seeing projects come into town and we need improved reviews of those projects and what those projects are gonna be giving to the city.

792
01:00:01,742 --> 01:00:07,306
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's sort of a broad overview, but I think it's something that we really need.

793
01:00:07,326 --> 01:00:13,870
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something that I identified almost as soon as I started here as a need that we have.

794
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:16,412
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm hoping this is seen favorably.

795
01:00:16,652 --> 01:00:16,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

796
01:00:19,178 --> 01:00:19,899
[SPEAKER_13]: Tim, thank you very much.

797
01:00:19,919 --> 01:00:22,742
[SPEAKER_13]: Appreciate that information.

798
01:00:23,683 --> 01:00:25,504
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very helpful to understanding this.

799
01:00:25,925 --> 01:00:35,454
[SPEAKER_13]: And as far as with regard to the budget, so this here is actually, this is strictly money from the casino special revenue fund that has no impact on the city budget, correct?

800
01:00:36,315 --> 01:00:37,136
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my understanding.

801
01:00:37,156 --> 01:00:41,340
[SPEAKER_13]: That's correct.

802
01:00:42,517 --> 01:00:44,138
[SPEAKER_13]: So I make complete support of this.

803
01:00:44,178 --> 01:00:50,821
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that I offered the original resolution years ago to bring on Todd.

804
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:52,742
[SPEAKER_13]: He's done a fabulous job.

805
01:00:52,762 --> 01:00:56,483
[SPEAKER_13]: I know he's super busy.

806
01:00:56,523 --> 01:00:58,764
[SPEAKER_13]: He's always representing the city.

807
01:00:59,524 --> 01:01:03,906
[SPEAKER_13]: It's good to have someone at the table that's representing the city on various projects come in.

808
01:01:04,006 --> 01:01:04,707
[SPEAKER_13]: Todd's done that.

809
01:01:04,747 --> 01:01:06,327
[SPEAKER_13]: He's done a great job at that.

810
01:01:06,808 --> 01:01:12,150
[SPEAKER_13]: I know I've talked to him numerous times just to make various traffic improvements

811
01:01:12,685 --> 01:01:14,706
[SPEAKER_13]: within each of the neighborhoods in our community.

812
01:01:14,946 --> 01:01:19,888
[SPEAKER_13]: And traffic is a real quality of life issue throughout our community, no matter what neighborhood you live in.

813
01:01:19,908 --> 01:01:25,590
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it would definitely be good to have someone on board that can help out.

814
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:28,371
[SPEAKER_13]: And I move approval, thank you.

815
01:01:28,891 --> 01:01:30,192
[SPEAKER_13]: I second that motion, Mr. President.

816
01:01:30,792 --> 01:01:35,694
[SPEAKER_02]: On the approval by Councilor Falco, second by Councilor Scarpelli.

817
01:01:36,254 --> 01:01:39,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have just a question to the administration.

818
01:01:40,398 --> 01:01:42,839
[SPEAKER_02]: and I will call upon you next Councilor Morell.

819
01:01:43,499 --> 01:01:56,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we anticipating that this will be a yearly appropriation that is received from Wynn Resorts and that the funding will be from Wynn Resorts going forward?

820
01:01:57,326 --> 01:01:59,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Or will this eventually be part of the city budget?

821
01:02:01,328 --> 01:02:03,629
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll let Dave talk to that, but I can talk to it a little bit.

822
01:02:03,689 --> 01:02:06,630
[SPEAKER_09]: My understanding is this is an annual payment that is made every year.

823
01:02:07,087 --> 01:02:10,608
[SPEAKER_09]: So it would be something that we would budget in into that.

824
01:02:11,628 --> 01:02:19,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully the city grows and we can continue to meet strategic goals, but this is one step for meeting strategic goals for sure.

825
01:02:20,231 --> 01:02:21,991
[SPEAKER_09]: So hopefully that answers your question.

826
01:02:24,952 --> 01:02:27,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Tim kind of hit it.

827
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:32,774
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is an annual appropriation from the SCA special revenue fund that was set up by the council via home rule.

828
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:34,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, later earlier in 20.

829
01:02:35,271 --> 01:02:39,092
[SPEAKER_08]: It was signed by the governor in late 21 late January 21.

830
01:02:39,192 --> 01:02:43,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me, but there is no plans at this time to add this to the general fund appropriation.

831
01:02:43,313 --> 01:02:47,915
[SPEAKER_08]: This is gonna be something that's gonna be exclusively funded through the special special revenue fund.

832
01:02:49,555 --> 01:02:50,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that.

833
01:02:50,856 --> 01:02:53,836
[SPEAKER_02]: My other question is to the city engineer.

834
01:02:53,856 --> 01:02:58,578
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you mentioned that this has an impact on the entire community.

835
01:02:59,578 --> 01:03:16,104
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I believe in living in the Wellington area that Wellington Circle along with the Felsway, Mystic Valley Parkway and Middlesex Ave will be a brunt of the traffic that is for this casino.

836
01:03:16,844 --> 01:03:19,185
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are state roads.

837
01:03:19,985 --> 01:03:26,607
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was wondering maybe if you could talk a little about what we're gonna do in conjunction with the city and the state

838
01:03:27,327 --> 01:03:43,653
[SPEAKER_02]: because if these are roads that we have no jurisdiction over, however, they are roads that will be highly used, what are we doing in cooperation with the state to improve vehicular traffic and pedestrian safety in that area?

839
01:03:44,733 --> 01:03:47,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, and we have tied it to, but there's a couple of ongoing things.

840
01:03:48,654 --> 01:03:51,815
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, right now, one of them is the underpass project.

841
01:03:51,835 --> 01:03:54,516
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a quick build bike lane project.

842
01:03:54,556 --> 01:03:56,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are both on the same stretch of route 28,

843
01:03:57,389 --> 01:04:00,770
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's an example of some projects that are currently ongoing now.

844
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:09,053
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we also have some improvements that should be happening on Middlesex Avenue that we're working directly with the state.

845
01:04:09,073 --> 01:04:12,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we've done the work, now it's just the sort of wait for it to happen.

846
01:04:12,033 --> 01:04:16,235
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's four intersections are getting basically redone, new ped ramps, one.

847
01:04:17,545 --> 01:04:23,150
[SPEAKER_09]: I think one intersection is getting a flashing beacon, actuated flashing beacon.

848
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:29,096
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's some mitigation elements that are happening because of the BJ's gas project, things like that.

849
01:04:30,217 --> 01:04:35,942
[SPEAKER_09]: And your point is well taken, the idea, I've read this agreement too many times to count at this point.

850
01:04:36,342 --> 01:04:44,270
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, you know, my understanding of it is a little bit on the, you know, this casino is going to impact the whole city.

851
01:04:44,731 --> 01:04:51,358
[SPEAKER_09]: But but, you know, the the transportation hub idea is that we have Wellington and we're going to have other transit stations, too.

852
01:04:51,778 --> 01:04:53,719
[SPEAKER_09]: and those funnel people into those casinos.

853
01:04:53,939 --> 01:05:00,041
[SPEAKER_09]: And you are right, that Wellington neighborhood, not only is it sort of blocked in by these roads, right?

854
01:05:00,061 --> 01:05:05,403
[SPEAKER_09]: It's sort of, it's troubling for a pedestrian to get out of there and get to Wellington, for example.

855
01:05:05,683 --> 01:05:07,384
[SPEAKER_09]: So things like that, we wanna take a look at.

856
01:05:07,424 --> 01:05:08,464
[SPEAKER_09]: We wanna look at connectivity.

857
01:05:08,584 --> 01:05:11,485
[SPEAKER_09]: We wanna look at, you know, where are pedestrians going?

858
01:05:11,525 --> 01:05:12,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are they going there?

859
01:05:12,245 --> 01:05:13,806
[SPEAKER_09]: And how do we, you know, help that out?

860
01:05:14,326 --> 01:05:19,268
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have a list of, you know, there are lots of roads that are impacted, Riverside,

861
01:05:19,621 --> 01:05:24,322
[SPEAKER_09]: for example, Commercial Street, Locust Street, we've seen some improvements there, and the list goes on.

862
01:05:24,342 --> 01:05:33,565
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not just those state roads, it's all the other roads that are connecting, including the first, second, third, fourth, all those, the residential streets.

863
01:05:33,605 --> 01:05:37,206
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's the whole city with a focus on that area, really.

864
01:05:37,706 --> 01:05:46,248
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, if I may add to that, that's a great point, Councilor Marks, because as you said, that area does get impacted,

865
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:58,833
[SPEAKER_12]: I would point out that even though there are a lot of state owned and operated roadways and even properties like DCR property, MBTA property, they do take up time for Medford city staff, right?

866
01:05:58,873 --> 01:06:02,234
[SPEAKER_12]: So, and we want to improve those areas, not just Medford owned areas.

867
01:06:02,654 --> 01:06:08,335
[SPEAKER_12]: So things like the underpass project, we coordinate with both MassDOT and DCR on that.

868
01:06:08,695 --> 01:06:15,657
[SPEAKER_12]: With the route 28 bike lane quick build project, we're coordinating with Somerville, DCR, MassDOT,

869
01:06:16,685 --> 01:06:18,266
[SPEAKER_12]: and possibly even private entities.

870
01:06:18,706 --> 01:06:30,650
[SPEAKER_12]: So even though they're not Medford owned and operated roadways and even parklands, it does take a considerable amount of time to plan and advocate for this stuff and manage and design and things like that.

871
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:35,192
[SPEAKER_12]: So this will help Medford be the squeaky wheel, so to speak, right?

872
01:06:35,292 --> 01:06:44,996
[SPEAKER_12]: With any of those state agencies to continually stay on top of those things on Middlesex Ave or Felsway, like the crosswalk at Felsway and Bradbury that was mentioned earlier.

873
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:59,313
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, continue to be the squeaky wheel on getting improvements for that crosswalk, whatever enhancements, you know, we could have an eye towards the long-term improvements, but also try to get quick immediate improvements as well whenever we can.

874
01:06:59,953 --> 01:07:01,214
[SPEAKER_12]: So this will help us do that.

875
01:07:01,975 --> 01:07:02,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

876
01:07:02,235 --> 01:07:13,525
[SPEAKER_02]: And my, the reason why I bring it up, I just want to make sure that the fact that there are so many state roads in the area are not an impediment for us to move forward on issues of safety in the area.

877
01:07:14,023 --> 01:07:19,105
[SPEAKER_02]: because of the fact that we may have to reach out to the state and that adds a whole other layer of red tape.

878
01:07:19,406 --> 01:07:27,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that, but I would hope that doesn't add to the layer of complexity when we need to get stuff done in the Wellington area.

879
01:07:27,649 --> 01:07:28,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Morell.

880
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:30,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Marks.

881
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:33,812
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could ask a question of Chief of Staff Rodriguez to the chair.

882
01:07:35,233 --> 01:07:39,755
[SPEAKER_01]: The language that establishes this special revenue fund in one section notes that

883
01:07:40,657 --> 01:07:53,148
[SPEAKER_01]: the treasurer of the city of Medford shall provide a report to the mayor and city council, which shall include but not be limited to the amount of donations and appropriations received the amount of grants and loans made and to whom and the balance of the special fund.

884
01:07:53,228 --> 01:07:57,992
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this was just recently passed, so I'm curious when we might be able to expect to see something like that.

885
01:08:00,354 --> 01:08:02,395
[SPEAKER_08]: And I apologize if you could just repeat the question.

886
01:08:02,415 --> 01:08:03,516
[SPEAKER_08]: My zoom dropped out a little bit.

887
01:08:03,576 --> 01:08:04,077
[SPEAKER_08]: I dropped.

888
01:08:04,397 --> 01:08:05,358
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't hear the first part.

889
01:08:05,829 --> 01:08:23,005
[SPEAKER_01]: sure, in the in the acts that establishes special revenue fund, there is a section that says annually, the treasurer of the city of Medford shall provide a report to the mayor and city council, which shall include but not be limited to the amount of donations and appropriations received the amount of grants and loans made, and to whom and the balance of the special fund.

890
01:08:23,245 --> 01:08:25,608
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just curious, as I know, this was recently passed.

891
01:08:25,648 --> 01:08:28,210
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just curious, we could maybe expect to see something like that.

892
01:08:29,673 --> 01:08:35,036
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was language that was inserted by the legislature at their request through the legislative process.

893
01:08:35,096 --> 01:08:36,997
[SPEAKER_08]: That's standard language for our special revenue fund.

894
01:08:37,717 --> 01:08:41,719
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a static amount of money that's going to be according to the SCA.

895
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:47,943
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not, and this is the only place that that money is going to be parked, and the only money that's going to be parked there.

896
01:08:48,663 --> 01:08:52,385
[SPEAKER_08]: So the report is going to be the amount of money that's included within the SCA.

897
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:58,044
[SPEAKER_08]: So the expenditures are subject to appropriation, so those will all be there.

898
01:08:58,485 --> 01:09:05,611
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to, and I talked to Aleesha Nunley about this briefly, we're going to kind of treat this kind of academically like an enterprise fund.

899
01:09:06,776 --> 01:09:12,920
[SPEAKER_08]: and say, this is the budget for this process going forward on a year by year basis, that would be subject to appropriation.

900
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:19,604
[SPEAKER_08]: But the static amount of money that's received year over year, there's no escalations within the SCA, so that would all be there.

901
01:09:20,124 --> 01:09:26,428
[SPEAKER_08]: If you need a copy, I'm happy to scan a copy and send it over that outlines the exact amount of money that are gonna be parked in that account.

902
01:09:27,448 --> 01:09:29,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that would be much appreciated.

903
01:09:30,030 --> 01:09:30,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

904
01:09:30,610 --> 01:09:30,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

905
01:09:32,891 --> 01:09:34,592
[SPEAKER_16]: Are there any other questions from the council?

906
01:09:35,133 --> 01:09:35,593
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

907
01:09:37,187 --> 01:09:37,867
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Beals.

908
01:09:38,328 --> 01:09:39,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

909
01:09:40,529 --> 01:09:43,270
[SPEAKER_11]: And my question is through to Chief Staff Rodriguez.

910
01:09:44,011 --> 01:09:44,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Two questions.

911
01:09:46,292 --> 01:09:49,133
[SPEAKER_11]: What is the balance in the special revenue fund currently?

912
01:09:49,834 --> 01:09:59,199
[SPEAKER_11]: And are there any projects in the Wellington area that don't require coordination with the state that you may be coming back to us for approval using these funds?

913
01:10:00,882 --> 01:10:02,023
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know the balance at this time.

914
01:10:02,083 --> 01:10:03,024
[SPEAKER_08]: I can get back to you.

915
01:10:03,044 --> 01:10:04,065
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll email Alicia.

916
01:10:04,085 --> 01:10:07,848
[SPEAKER_08]: And she'll provide that information, the exact balance in the special revenue fund.

917
01:10:08,428 --> 01:10:13,492
[SPEAKER_08]: And then to the question about projects, I don't know the exact projects that are being planned.

918
01:10:14,053 --> 01:10:20,678
[SPEAKER_08]: This engineer will obviously have something to do with that, the planning of any projects that maybe they're subject to.

919
01:10:21,406 --> 01:10:23,187
[SPEAKER_08]: appropriation from the Special Revenue Fund.

920
01:10:23,547 --> 01:10:32,871
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll defer to Tim and Todd about any particular projects that they might know that are in the hopper for that particular area, or any state projects that might be part of that discussion.

921
01:10:35,972 --> 01:10:38,073
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you very much.

922
01:10:38,633 --> 01:10:41,054
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are a lot of potential projects.

923
01:10:41,094 --> 01:10:43,075
[SPEAKER_09]: So right now, Wellington Study is happening.

924
01:10:43,095 --> 01:10:44,115
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just getting kicked off.

925
01:10:44,475 --> 01:10:48,837
[SPEAKER_09]: So one of the tasks would be to track that and be involved with that.

926
01:10:49,858 --> 01:10:56,064
[SPEAKER_09]: and understanding the implications of our roads when a study like that is done, because it's a massive study.

927
01:10:56,124 --> 01:10:59,427
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's most likely gonna trickle into our area.

928
01:11:00,147 --> 01:11:06,413
[SPEAKER_09]: There are things that we've discussed in my office about potential projects to study.

929
01:11:07,714 --> 01:11:15,681
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things that bothers me about that whole neighborhood is the fact that if you are a pedestrian, how the heck do you get out of your neighborhood and get to Wellington?

930
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:17,800
[SPEAKER_09]: There's study opportunity.

931
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:30,863
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that there is project opportunity because as things like Middlesex Avenue get improved, some of the improvements I mentioned before, then we're going to also want to improve our side streets and all the roads that go through there.

932
01:11:31,763 --> 01:11:35,804
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, just another potential idea is the Route 28 underpass project.

933
01:11:35,844 --> 01:11:40,845
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to leave its design phase at some point, and we'll need to build it.

934
01:11:41,539 --> 01:11:46,681
[SPEAKER_09]: That's, I'm not saying we're going to use this money for that project, but it's a project that's coming to that area.

935
01:11:46,961 --> 01:11:51,782
[SPEAKER_09]: And there will be more, you know, and Todd can, Todd's got more ideas than I do.

936
01:11:51,802 --> 01:11:52,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are just a few.

937
01:11:53,523 --> 01:12:06,727
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sure this council has discussed all sorts of ideas and we can mine through resolutions and figure out, you know, some big picture planning type efforts for the whole area, which is something we like to do.

938
01:12:07,327 --> 01:12:09,248
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, Todd, if you have anything to add, please do.

939
01:12:10,755 --> 01:12:14,757
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a good, thank you, Councilor for those questions because that's a good point.

940
01:12:14,937 --> 01:12:21,340
[SPEAKER_12]: We're always looking to use the correct funding for the correct project or issue, right?

941
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:31,904
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're, you know, long-term goals involve bicycle connections along both sides of the river, things like that, crossing these major state roadways as well.

942
01:12:32,524 --> 01:12:38,747
[SPEAKER_12]: So depending on the grants and funding available, we'll try to use those resources as best as possible so that

943
01:12:39,181 --> 01:12:40,562
[SPEAKER_12]: we don't have to use city resources.

944
01:12:40,602 --> 01:12:47,365
[SPEAKER_12]: We could go after gaming commission grant funds, which the city already does for say the 20 underpass project design.

945
01:12:47,765 --> 01:13:08,396
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we could work with DCR and other state entities to figure out what the best pool of money is to go for the construction money for that, say as Tim just pointed out, maybe not these, but then looking at all those strategies collectively to best use the resources available to us so that we don't have to dip into city general fund for these things.

946
01:13:08,846 --> 01:13:24,718
[SPEAKER_12]: So hopefully there'll be, you know, it seems like after looking at the state owned areas, there will be opportunity for city owned areas to improve things like on say, first, second, third street, those types of streets that may not get touched by major projects.

947
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:27,400
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you both.

948
01:13:39,627 --> 01:13:41,809
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll second by Councilor Scarpelli.

949
01:13:41,829 --> 01:13:42,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, call the roll.

950
01:13:44,691 --> 01:13:45,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Bears.

951
01:13:45,812 --> 01:13:46,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

952
01:13:48,274 --> 01:13:49,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco.

953
01:13:49,034 --> 01:13:49,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

954
01:13:50,095 --> 01:13:51,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Knight has accused himself.

955
01:13:52,597 --> 01:13:53,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to call you last.

956
01:13:53,778 --> 01:13:54,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Morell.

957
01:13:54,799 --> 01:13:55,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

958
01:13:57,381 --> 01:13:58,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

959
01:13:58,562 --> 01:13:58,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

960
01:13:59,302 --> 01:14:01,004
[SPEAKER_03]: President Caraviello has accused himself.

961
01:14:01,744 --> 01:14:02,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Acting President Marks.

962
01:14:03,225 --> 01:14:03,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

963
01:14:06,548 --> 01:14:09,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Five in the affirmative, two recused.

964
01:14:09,783 --> 01:14:10,884
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion passes.

965
01:14:13,385 --> 01:14:15,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

966
01:14:15,687 --> 01:14:16,207
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

967
01:14:16,668 --> 01:14:17,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

968
01:14:21,831 --> 01:14:37,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, before we move on, I'd just like to take an opportunity to recognize the work of traffic engineer Todd Blake and his assistants in getting a couple of signs on the corner of Winthrop Street and South Street removed at the request of a constituent last week.

969
01:14:38,592 --> 01:14:41,273
[SPEAKER_04]: He and I have been going back and forth for a few weeks trying to get this done.

970
01:14:41,353 --> 01:14:45,415
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just wanted to thank him for his hard work and his effort in making sure that it became a reality.

971
01:14:45,475 --> 01:14:52,797
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to point out a job well done by our traffic engineer in response to a constituent concern, Mr. President.

972
01:14:54,578 --> 01:14:55,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

973
01:14:57,419 --> 01:14:58,319
[SPEAKER_14]: Reports of committees.

974
01:14:58,339 --> 01:15:00,560
[SPEAKER_14]: 2006-680, February 9, 2021.

975
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:01,881
[SPEAKER_14]: Committee of the report.

976
01:15:08,247 --> 01:15:13,951
[SPEAKER_14]: The paper 20680, we met last week to discuss council priorities.

977
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:21,977
[SPEAKER_14]: And the council outlined a list of both budget and legislative priorities.

978
01:15:22,478 --> 01:15:29,002
[SPEAKER_14]: And we had a discussion on both sides.

979
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:37,769
[SPEAKER_14]: And the papers have now been sent to all the councillors to figure out which papers are the most important to them.

980
01:15:38,211 --> 01:15:43,655
[SPEAKER_14]: So I am awaiting the return of everyone's list to me so we can have a second meeting.

981
01:15:45,537 --> 01:15:47,959

[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bears, you are chairman of that committee, would you like to give a brief synopsis?

1021
01:17:12,923 --> 01:17:13,803
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1022
01:17:14,123 --> 01:17:23,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we met last week, myself, Councilor Falco and Councilor Marks, along with members of the city administration and residents to discuss housing stability related issues.

1023
01:17:23,987 --> 01:17:29,368
[SPEAKER_11]: The first one was on the request by the council for the mayor to implement an eviction moratorium.

1024
01:17:29,809 --> 01:17:31,069
[SPEAKER_11]: We had extensive discussion.

1025
01:17:31,089 --> 01:17:36,611
[SPEAKER_11]: The legal questions had not been answered any further at that meeting than in the prior

1026
01:17:37,534 --> 01:17:45,235
[SPEAKER_11]: We were able to make some connections hopefully between some local residents who have experience in this area with the administration that hopefully will move that along.

1027
01:17:45,795 --> 01:17:55,997
[SPEAKER_11]: And we voted unanimously, neither favorably nor unfavorably to report the paper on the eviction moratorium request out to committee of the whole for further discussion.

1028
01:17:56,917 --> 01:18:05,199
[SPEAKER_11]: We also discussed the paper 20-302, which regarded some housing stability requests around a task force

1029
01:18:06,717 --> 01:18:08,518
[SPEAKER_11]: and we had a good discussion.

1030
01:18:08,558 --> 01:18:14,342
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a housing stability working group that is meeting convened by the office of community development and the mayor.

1031
01:18:14,703 --> 01:18:17,645
[SPEAKER_11]: We had some input into what the structure of that will look like.

1032
01:18:17,865 --> 01:18:25,330
[SPEAKER_11]: And we are planning a future meeting to follow up on that as well as on Councilor Falco's notification ordinance.

1033
01:18:26,871 --> 01:18:27,812
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you Councilor Bearsley.

1034
01:18:28,573 --> 01:18:31,375
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Bearsley, seconded by Vice President Knight.

1035
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:32,255
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1036
01:18:32,275 --> 01:18:33,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, before you call the roll.

1037
01:18:35,525 --> 01:18:36,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1038
01:18:36,866 --> 01:18:38,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to add my two cents.

1039
01:18:39,147 --> 01:18:44,189
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was a very productive meeting that we held regarding the housing task force.

1040
01:18:44,769 --> 01:19:03,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Originally, we were looking at the creation of an ordinance to set up this task force, and upon deliberation and more discussion, we currently have a working group, as Councilor Bears mentioned, and we felt best to work with the existing working group

1041
01:19:03,724 --> 01:19:06,225
[SPEAKER_02]: and not pursue the ordinance avenue.

1042
01:19:06,965 --> 01:19:13,686
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think in that direction, it gives us much more flexibility and much more community input.

1043
01:19:14,947 --> 01:19:19,788
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look forward to working with this new task force when it's created.

1044
01:19:21,648 --> 01:19:22,689
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor.

1045
01:19:22,709 --> 01:19:27,450
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion by Councilor Bears, seconded by Vice President Knight.

1046
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:28,950

[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President.

1069
01:20:01,523 --> 01:20:02,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks.

1070
01:20:03,025 --> 01:20:09,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, at some point, we do have a number of items under reports due slash deadlines.

1071
01:20:09,967 --> 01:20:15,408
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not saying we have to take them up now, but at some point we really should go through the reports due and deadlines.

1072
01:20:16,068 --> 01:20:18,029
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's just tidy up some council business.

[SPEAKER_14]: If I could have a moment.

1078
01:20:28,951 --> 01:20:30,612
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to let everybody know that

1079
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:38,996
[SPEAKER_14]: On March 12th, the Medford Public Library Foundation will be ending its paper program.

1080
01:20:40,137 --> 01:20:50,322
[SPEAKER_14]: So if anybody is interested in purchasing a paper for their family or their business, please reach out to either myself or somebody on the library to purchase one.

1081
01:20:51,182 --> 01:20:52,183
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a few left.

1082
01:20:52,703 --> 01:20:56,665
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, if anybody, March 12th is the deadline to purchase one.

1083
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:57,426
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to thank everybody.

1084
01:20:58,846 --> 01:20:59,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President.

1085
01:21:01,414 --> 01:21:09,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if I could, we did get two correspondence back from the city administration regarding two council papers that were offered by myself.

1086
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:17,705
[SPEAKER_02]: One being 21-036 regarding the condition of engine four and engine six, the leaking roofs.

1087
01:21:18,205 --> 01:21:28,852
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did get a correspondence back from the city administration saying they're working with procurement and the chief to begin to get quotes and move forward on these very important

1088
01:21:29,535 --> 01:21:30,636
[SPEAKER_02]: projects, Mr. President.

1089
01:21:30,676 --> 01:21:34,377
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was one correspondence we received from that paper.

1090
01:21:34,917 --> 01:21:39,839
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other council resolution was regarding the water and sewer base charge.

1091
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:55,845
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't read it all, Mr. President, but more or less it mentioned that a million dollars, roughly a million dollars a year goes towards the water and sewer bills in order to keep a flow of money into the account

1092
01:21:56,630 --> 01:22:10,038
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a paper I think was offered by Councilor Scarpelli or Vice President Knight regarding the donations that are received through the tax bill for library, police and fire.

1093
01:22:10,739 --> 01:22:16,342
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I could Mr. President over the last three fiscal years, fiscal 19, 20 and 21 residents donated $4,719.21.

1094
01:22:24,544 --> 01:22:30,026
[SPEAKER_02]: to the fire station donation, and that was over three year period through their tax bill.

1095
01:22:30,427 --> 01:22:33,428
[SPEAKER_02]: The police donation was $2,687.92, and the library donation was $4,892 over the last three fiscal years.

1096
01:22:33,468 --> 01:22:34,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1097
01:22:34,488 --> 01:22:36,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Martins.

1098
01:22:36,109 --> 01:22:36,449

1099
01:22:36,489 --> 01:22:36,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks, how did you find those records?

1103
01:22:57,909 --> 01:22:59,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I didn't have a chance to look through the records.

1104
01:22:59,950 --> 01:23:01,830
