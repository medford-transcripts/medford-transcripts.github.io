1
00:00:00,231 --> 00:00:00,531
[SPEAKER_05]: up to the $6,500.

2
00:00:00,631 --> 00:00:05,174
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of the case itself?

3
00:00:05,534 --> 00:00:06,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Expenses?

4
00:00:06,134 --> 00:00:06,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

5
00:00:06,675 --> 00:00:07,235
[SPEAKER_07]: That type of thing?

6
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:07,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

7
00:00:07,815 --> 00:00:13,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Under medical expenses, which I guess would fall under medical cost, but the way that's always been worded is other.

8
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:20,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I suspect it would fall under something that's not necessarily medical cost, but a copay, something to that effect.

9
00:00:20,182 --> 00:00:23,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Out-of-pocket expenses will usually fall under other as well.

10
00:00:24,464 --> 00:00:24,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

11
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:25,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

12
00:00:26,353 --> 00:00:29,174
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Knight.

13
00:00:29,635 --> 00:00:30,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_03]: No.

18
00:00:33,796 --> 00:00:34,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight?

19
00:00:34,797 --> 00:00:35,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

20
00:00:35,637 --> 00:00:36,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Kerrio?

21
00:00:36,397 --> 00:00:36,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

22
00:00:36,798 --> 00:00:37,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice-President Moniz?

23
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:37,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

24
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:38,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scott Fevella?

25
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:39,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

26
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:40,359
[SPEAKER_03]: President Calviro?

27
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:40,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

28
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Formally, for the affirmative, a three absent motion passes.

29
00:00:47,782 --> 00:00:49,783
[SPEAKER_02]: 17-723, request for an expenditure from our department.

30
00:00:49,823 --> 00:00:50,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Claims offer $1,000.

31
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:55,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear President and members of Honorable City Council, Stephanie Burke, client name,

32
00:00:56,622 --> 00:00:58,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Deidre Alessio versus City of Medford.

33
00:00:59,743 --> 00:01:02,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you please give us a synopsis of the case, please?

34
00:01:02,624 --> 00:01:02,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Certainly.

35
00:01:03,144 --> 00:01:05,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President, members of the City Council.

36
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:09,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, my name is Kimberly Scanlon, the Assistant City Solicitor for the City of Medford.

37
00:01:09,746 --> 00:01:18,449
[SPEAKER_07]: The claimant in this case is requesting compensation for injuries due to a street fact at or about 161 College Avenue, namely a pothole.

38
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:22,370
[SPEAKER_07]: As a result, she fractured her elbow and sustained a concussion.

39
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,810
[SPEAKER_07]: She was

40
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:35,025
[SPEAKER_07]: treated at Massachusetts General Hospital, and because her medical bills are in excess of $7,000, again, under the statute, I am requesting $5,000, which is the cap.

41
00:01:36,307 --> 00:01:40,972
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

42
00:01:41,532 --> 00:01:42,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor DelaRusso?

43
00:01:42,574 --> 00:01:42,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

44
00:01:50,752 --> 00:01:51,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

45
00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:52,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

46
00:01:52,673 --> 00:01:56,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, for the affirmative, uh, three absent motion passes.

47
00:01:56,394 --> 00:01:59,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clark, could you please go in and inform the other three members?

48
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:03,436
[SPEAKER_02]: They have two minutes to come in or the meeting will be adjourned.

49
00:02:04,396 --> 00:02:05,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

50
00:02:05,396 --> 00:02:06,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Members of the city council.

51
00:02:08,957 --> 00:02:14,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I cannot take those Mr. Del Rosso because the person that has made those requests is not here.

52
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,700
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mr. Clark, if you, uh, we'll take a two minute recess.

53
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion, you got five minutes, you had 10 minutes.

54
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to resume the meeting.

55
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:00,453

56
00:04:01,434 --> 00:04:02,814

00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:12,298

00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:13,859

[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Carviello.

62
00:04:19,438 --> 00:04:24,361
[SPEAKER_06]: I first could just ask that you mark Councilor Marks, Councilor Falco, and I present for this meeting.

63
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:27,103
[SPEAKER_06]: We were over at the Zoning Board of Appeals meeting.

64
00:04:27,123 --> 00:04:39,169
[SPEAKER_06]: The Zoning Board of Appeals is gonna be gracious enough to let any city councilor that wants to speak on the matter of Medford Street and Broadway, a development that we've received a number of complaints on this week.

65
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,191
[SPEAKER_06]: They're gonna allow us to speak in the next several minutes.

66
00:04:42,211 --> 00:04:43,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, if we can get done quickly, you over there.

67
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:52,215
[SPEAKER_06]: We would, I would like, I would ask, respectfully ask that we take a break, a 20 minute recess.

68
00:04:54,116 --> 00:05:02,179
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion by Council Member Kern to take a 20 minute recess to attend the Board of Appeals hearing, seconded by?

69
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:02,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded.

70
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by Council Member Falco.

71
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:06,401
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

72
00:05:06,421 --> 00:05:06,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

73
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:10,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, the chair is in doubt.

74
00:05:11,964 --> 00:05:13,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

75
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, excuse me, Councilor Knight.

76
00:05:16,508 --> 00:05:22,750
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, looking at the papers that are remaining here, I think that if we put our heads down and just focus on what's going on, we'll be able to get out of here before 10 minutes is over.

77
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,932
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we only have all the items on our agenda have been disposed of.

78
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:37,436
[SPEAKER_15]: The only items that we have here are a couple of under suspension items that Councilor Marks has put forward relative to some public, uh, public safety concerns that he has in the neighborhood from knocking on doors or from his, from his parks.

79
00:05:41,198 --> 00:05:42,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

80
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:48,906
Yes.

81
00:05:49,646 --> 00:05:49,826
No.

82
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:49,966
Yes.

83
00:05:49,986 --> 00:05:50,187
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

84
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Moves this page to take 17-726.

85
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:55,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Reading the prayer book.

[SPEAKER_06]: start roll call vote please I believe

89
00:06:28,871 --> 00:06:31,992
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't wanna push the meeting to a Monday or Wednesday.

90
00:06:32,012 --> 00:06:33,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I just interject one second?

91
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:33,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

92
00:06:33,553 --> 00:06:41,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I was informed by the clerk that there is a National Grid hearing that evening at seven that he has already sent out a notification for.

93
00:06:42,677 --> 00:06:42,937
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

94
00:06:43,258 --> 00:06:45,479
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanna let you know that, so.

95
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,680
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

96
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,041
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion by Council Member Kern.

97

[SPEAKER_02]: Motion two is that we have no for the paper of the business.

00:07:06,574 --> 00:07:09,937
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all done with them.

101
00:07:10,157 --> 00:07:11,058
[SPEAKER_02]: We just did the last two.

102
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:15,923
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all done with them.

103
00:07:16,283 --> 00:07:18,906
[SPEAKER_02]: The records of the meeting.

104
00:07:20,657 --> 00:07:27,903
[SPEAKER_03]: We're past two.

105
00:07:27,983 --> 00:07:30,846
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the resolution of that?

106
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:31,086
[SPEAKER_02]: 17-726.

107
00:07:31,126 --> 00:07:41,695
[SPEAKER_02]: There's already a hearing scheduled for 7 o'clock that evening with National Grid, and the clerk has already sent out notifications, so that could not happen.

[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to table by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

00:07:51,224 --> 00:07:57,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Reckons of October 17th will pass to Councilor Longo-Kern, which we will table as she has gone.

113
00:07:57,906 --> 00:08:00,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion by Councilor Knight to table, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

114
00:08:01,446 --> 00:08:02,186
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

115
00:08:03,247 --> 00:08:03,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

116
00:08:05,947 --> 00:08:09,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to adjourn by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Schapelle.

117
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:10,648
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

118
00:08:11,428 --> 00:08:12,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

119
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:14,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Meeting is adjourned.

120
00:10:37,891 --> 00:10:44,056
[SPEAKER_08]: America and moving to Detroit because they heard it was a city with an insatiable demand for labor.

121
00:10:44,557 --> 00:10:54,906
[SPEAKER_08]: And so Detroit became a magnet for folks from Poland, from Italy, from many parts of southern and eastern Europe during the period of the great global immigration.

122
00:10:55,306 --> 00:11:02,833
[SPEAKER_13]: And how did these different communities, both from inside the United States and from abroad, how did they settle and live together, or perhaps apart?

123
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:09,232
[SPEAKER_08]: The biggest collision between different types of Detroiters ended up being the black-white division.

124
00:11:09,572 --> 00:11:16,055
[SPEAKER_08]: That is, many of the immigrants from southern and eastern Europe, you could say, made peace with each other relatively quickly.

125
00:11:16,156 --> 00:11:17,816
[SPEAKER_08]: They lived in the same neighborhoods.

126
00:11:18,337 --> 00:11:19,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Many of them were Roman Catholics.

127
00:11:19,577 --> 00:11:20,698
[SPEAKER_08]: They attended church together.

128
00:11:21,218 --> 00:11:22,499
[SPEAKER_08]: They worked together in factories.

129
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:23,940
[SPEAKER_08]: They drank together in bars.

130
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:30,543
[SPEAKER_08]: African-Americans, on the other hand, were very quickly and rigidly segregated in Detroit's housing market.

131
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:37,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Housing segregation meant that, by and large, folks weren't interacting across the racial divide on a daily basis.

132
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:39,148
[SPEAKER_08]: They were living in different neighborhoods.

133
00:11:39,348 --> 00:11:40,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Their children were going to different schools.

134
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:45,091
[SPEAKER_08]: They were going to different religious congregations.

135
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,893
[SPEAKER_08]: And so Detroit begins to emerge

136
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:55,783
[SPEAKER_08]: already by the 1920s and intensifying into the 20th century as a city with a very clear black-white divide.

137
00:11:56,264 --> 00:12:00,850
[SPEAKER_13]: Detroit's auto industry evolved through the early 20th century, as did its population.

138
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:05,516
[SPEAKER_13]: In World War II, the city's peoples and factories contributed enormously to the war effort.

139
00:12:06,037 --> 00:12:12,179
[SPEAKER_13]: And by 1950, the population was approaching almost 2 million, an incredibly steep growth in just a few decades.

140
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:19,301
[SPEAKER_13]: But as well as producing cars and other products, the factories of Detroit also hosted countless creative individuals.

141
00:12:19,741 --> 00:12:27,104
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll talk about Motown in a moment, but perhaps lesser well-known are the poets and writers who experienced the car industry growing up.

142
00:12:27,864 --> 00:12:29,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Anna, can you introduce us to a couple of them?

143
00:12:30,147 --> 00:12:31,549
[SPEAKER_13]: Philip Levine, for example?

144
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:36,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Philip Levine is the son of Russian Jewish immigrants in Detroit.

145
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:42,963
[SPEAKER_01]: He began working in factories as a teenager and returned to them after graduating from college in 1950.

146
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:45,986
[SPEAKER_01]: He hated it.

147
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:48,788
[SPEAKER_01]: He found the work very exhausting and tiresome.

148
00:12:48,828 --> 00:12:51,009
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a literary sensibility.

149
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:59,873
[SPEAKER_01]: He worried that he was wasting his energies on a lot of this very difficult manual labor when what he really wanted to do was to be working on his poetry.

150
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:05,656
[SPEAKER_01]: But in time, the working life in Detroit would become the great subject of his life.

151
00:13:06,216 --> 00:13:12,279
[SPEAKER_01]: And he went on to publish a number of poetry collections, perhaps most well known, a book called What Work Is.

152
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:15,581
[SPEAKER_01]: He won the National Book Award, Pulitzer Prize, he was a U.S.

153
00:13:15,622 --> 00:13:23,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Poet Laureate, and always he kept coming back to his time in the Detroit factories as one of the most significant subjects of his life.

154
00:13:23,848 --> 00:13:24,829
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dudley Randall?

155
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,050
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Dudley Randall.

156
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:26,891
[SPEAKER_01]: He was many things.

157
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:38,601
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a poet, he was the founder of the groundbreaking Broadside Press, an independent publishing company that put out the work of African American poets at a time when almost nobody else was.

158
00:13:39,181 --> 00:13:43,364
[SPEAKER_01]: But he got his start, as many young men did, working in factories.

159
00:13:43,804 --> 00:13:53,470
[SPEAKER_13]: And Herb, speaking of creative people who worked in the factories, you're now a scholar and an author of more than 20 books, but in earlier years you too worked in manufacturing in Detroit.

160
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,141
[SPEAKER_10]: no doubt about it, all over the place.

161
00:13:56,661 --> 00:14:01,804
[SPEAKER_10]: But I spent at least four or five months, you know, at Dodge, Maine in Hamtramck.

162
00:14:02,545 --> 00:14:04,746
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was what you call a swing worker.

163
00:14:04,766 --> 00:14:08,928
[SPEAKER_10]: If someone didn't show up to do their job, then that was my assignment.

164
00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:16,633
[SPEAKER_10]: And consequently, I moved all over the plant, from the wet deck to assembly to rolling the cars off.

165
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:21,536
[SPEAKER_10]: So, all of these opportunities put me in touch with many, many of the workers there.

166
00:14:21,616 --> 00:14:28,941
[SPEAKER_10]: And later on, I was going to see these workers, some of them at Wayne State University, because they told me, say, hey, schoolboy.

167
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:31,763
[SPEAKER_10]: They used to call me schoolboy there, because I always had a book in my hand.

168
00:14:31,783 --> 00:14:34,805
[SPEAKER_10]: And they say, schoolboy, you want to get out of here as soon as you can.

169
00:14:35,325 --> 00:14:37,767
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't only writers who were shaped by Detroit.

170
00:14:37,847 --> 00:14:39,287
[SPEAKER_13]: So were the city's musicians.

171
00:14:39,668 --> 00:14:42,870
[SPEAKER_13]: Perhaps the city's most famous cultural export is music.

172
00:14:51,972 --> 00:14:56,975
[SPEAKER_13]: In 1959, a man called Barry Gordy founded a company that would become known as Motown.

173
00:14:57,475 --> 00:15:01,837
[SPEAKER_13]: This is one of its early hits, Please, Mr. Postman, by the Marvelettes.

174
00:15:02,538 --> 00:15:10,322
[SPEAKER_04]: There must be some work today, for my boyfriend's so far away.

175
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Stephen, can you tell us a bit about what Motown was and who Berry Gordy was?

176
00:15:24,426 --> 00:15:31,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, so Motown is a record company or was a record company that was started by Berry Gordy in Detroit.

177
00:15:31,975 --> 00:15:36,881
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a very small company at first and of course grew to be one of the largest

178
00:15:37,321 --> 00:15:52,500
[SPEAKER_09]: record companies in America, if not the world, Barry Gordy sort of saw an opportunity in the idea of black music produced and created by black people, but that could appeal to people of all races.

179
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,244
[SPEAKER_09]: So there were very catchy sort of

180
00:15:55,804 --> 00:16:04,412
[SPEAKER_09]: cutesy lines in some of the songs and in the music that were very catchy to people who were not African-American.

181
00:16:04,932 --> 00:16:13,500
[SPEAKER_09]: At the same time, Motown gave birth to black music that took on many of the issues of that day.

182
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:22,288
[SPEAKER_09]: If you think of Marvin Gaye, for instance, in his seminal album, What's Going On, a piece of work that absolutely

183
00:16:23,008 --> 00:16:33,552
[SPEAKER_09]: cries out with sort of anguish and despair about the black condition, about the Vietnam War, about all kinds of things that were going on, that comes out of Motown.

184
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:35,713
[SPEAKER_09]: And there are lots of other examples of that as well.

185
00:16:35,753 --> 00:16:50,999
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's this sort of coalescing of pop music, but also music with a message and coming from an African American perspective that could only happen, I think, in Detroit and only have come from Detroit.

186
00:16:51,717 --> 00:17:06,429
[SPEAKER_13]: And during its heyday in the 60s and into the 70s, Motown was incredibly efficient, turning out huge numbers of performers and hits, as though it took some inspiration from the efficient production model found in the city's car factories, a musical assembly line of sorts.

187
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:10,973
[SPEAKER_13]: Anna, we've heard about Berry Gordy, but there were important women behind Motown too, weren't there?

188
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:13,495
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you tell us about a couple of them, briefly?

189
00:17:14,355 --> 00:17:14,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

190
00:17:14,755 --> 00:17:22,277
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is Esther Gordy Edwards, who is Barry's sister, an entrepreneur in her own right who became a top executive at Motown.

191
00:17:22,357 --> 00:17:30,458
[SPEAKER_01]: She's credited with the Motortown Review, which popularized Motown music across the United States by sending the artists on tour.

192
00:17:30,518 --> 00:17:31,578
[SPEAKER_01]: They traveled by bus.

193
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:38,980
[SPEAKER_01]: She also is credited with a lot of the overseas outreach of Motown to make sure that it was reaching audiences around the world.

194
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,921
[SPEAKER_01]: And another big contributor was Maxine Powell.

195
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,641
[SPEAKER_01]: She was basically Motown's charm school teacher.

196
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:52,743
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the folks who were performing in these Motown hits, I mean, they were local kids in Detroit.

197
00:17:53,183 --> 00:18:03,625
[SPEAKER_01]: They would spend a couple hours a day with Maxine, and she would teach them the kind of manners and etiquette so that they could move with ease to get their music out there.

198
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:09,006
[SPEAKER_13]: If the 60s in Detroit was an exciting time for music, it was also a time of change and unrest.

199
00:18:09,527 --> 00:18:20,570
[SPEAKER_13]: For years, the city had been a hive of homegrown labor activity, as trades union activists and workers clubbed together to campaign for better conditions, notably during the Great Depression of the 1930s.

200
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:31,593
[SPEAKER_13]: But in the 1960s, Detroit also drew the attention of activists from outside the city who were pushing for change, African-American leaders such as Malcolm X and Martin Luther King.

201
00:18:32,473 --> 00:18:35,757
[SPEAKER_13]: Herb, Dr. King came to town in 1963, didn't he?

202
00:18:36,097 --> 00:18:36,718
[SPEAKER_13]: Why was that?

203
00:18:36,778 --> 00:18:39,120
[SPEAKER_13]: Why was this visit important for him and for the city?

204
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:54,336
[SPEAKER_10]: The whole civil rights movement had some resonance in the city of Detroit and we had a number of activists and civic leaders who identified with that and felt a need to help that movement out, to raise finances and what have you for it.

205
00:18:55,297 --> 00:19:02,979
[SPEAKER_10]: So one of the ideas that was promoted at that time was to get a fundraiser for Dr. King and the Civil Rights Movement in general.

206
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:11,001
[SPEAKER_10]: And to promote that, they invited Dr. King to come to Detroit and participate in the Walk to Freedom.

207
00:19:11,021 --> 00:19:24,944
[SPEAKER_10]: And so when he came to Detroit in 1963 and spoke at Cobo Arena at that time, he had an opportunity to kind of do a rehearsal on I Have a Dream speech that became so absolutely famous later on.

208
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:27,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Stephen, what's your perspective on this?

209
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:33,131
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you see as the challenges and problems faced by African Americans that was driving this activism in Detroit at the time?

210
00:19:33,351 --> 00:19:41,398
[SPEAKER_09]: You had several things that set all of this up in the years and maybe the decade before the late 1960s.

211
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:42,620
[SPEAKER_09]: One was the destruction of

212
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:55,487
[SPEAKER_09]: the neighborhood called Black Bottom and the adjacent neighborhood called Paradise Valley, which were an African-American residential neighborhood and a business and entertainment district.

213
00:19:55,867 --> 00:20:02,671
[SPEAKER_09]: They were the only places really that African-Americans could live or work or entertain themselves.

214
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:10,615
[SPEAKER_09]: And their destruction sent African-Americans sort of scattering through the city to other places to try to find places to live and work.

215
00:20:10,995 --> 00:20:14,679
[SPEAKER_09]: where they bumped up against a lot of other cultures.

216
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:30,273
[SPEAKER_09]: And the sort of tensions that grew up around that proximity, the inability of African Americans to really fulfill the promise of good jobs and decent housing were, I think, more prominent and more in people's faces.

217
00:20:30,774 --> 00:20:33,276
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you have this sort of tension building up.

218
00:20:33,777 --> 00:20:34,878
[SPEAKER_09]: You also had the election.

219
00:20:35,618 --> 00:20:46,245
[SPEAKER_09]: in the early 1960s of a mayor named Jerry Kavanaugh, who promised a lot of advancement and opportunity for African Americans, but didn't really deliver on it.

220
00:20:46,265 --> 00:20:57,872
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, so you sort of have this perfect storm of promise, but then sort of frustration with the fact that it's not happening through the normal democratic processes.

221
00:20:58,032 --> 00:21:01,795
[SPEAKER_09]: And so by 1967, the city is something of a powder keg.

222
00:21:02,275 --> 00:21:10,200
[SPEAKER_13]: You set the scene for the key date which is July 1967 when Detroit saw five days of violent urban unrest.

223
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:21,406
I have not seen streets like these since the blitz in London.

224
00:21:21,826 --> 00:21:26,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Hundreds of buildings gutted by fire and fallen rubble spilled over into the streets.

225
00:21:27,149 --> 00:21:28,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Governor Romney in his telegram to President

226
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:35,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Michigan Governor George Romney deployed the National Guard and President Lyndon Johnson sent in troops.

227
00:21:35,846 --> 00:21:40,510
[SPEAKER_13]: By the end of it all, 43 people were dead, the majority of whom were African-American.

228
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:46,035
[SPEAKER_13]: Many people were injured, thousands were arrested, buildings were burned, stores were looted.

229
00:21:46,716 --> 00:21:49,038
[SPEAKER_13]: Thomas, what was the immediate trigger for this?

230
00:21:49,438 --> 00:21:50,720
[SPEAKER_13]: What's seen as the catalyst?

231
00:21:51,205 --> 00:21:57,888
[SPEAKER_08]: The immediate trigger was the police raid of a so-called blind pig, which was an illegal after-hours bar.

232
00:21:58,528 --> 00:22:09,092
[SPEAKER_08]: The deeper roots of what happened in July 1967 had to do with Detroit's long and sordid history of police brutality and harassment toward African Americans.

233
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:18,920
[SPEAKER_08]: In 1967, about 95% of Detroit's police department was white in a city that was getting close to 40% African American.

234
00:22:19,581 --> 00:22:21,583
[SPEAKER_08]: The possibilities of tension were enormous.

235
00:22:21,943 --> 00:22:30,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Police in the late 50s and early 1960s began stepping up a stop and frisk tactics, that is stopping African American men

236
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:35,413
[SPEAKER_08]: for the color of their skin and for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

237
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:53,163
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you were an African American man in a predominantly white neighborhood by car, by foot, by bicycle, you could almost be guaranteed of being stopped by the police, subject to derogatory slurs, beatings, being pushed up against walls, being arrested frequently for spurious charges.

238
00:22:53,759 --> 00:23:06,648
[SPEAKER_13]: One incident that took place during these days was at the Algiers motel when three African-American teenagers were shot dead and others present were badly beaten after police and others arrived there responding to reports of sniper fire.

239
00:23:07,188 --> 00:23:09,670
[SPEAKER_13]: Thomas, this was a shocking incident for many, wasn't it?

240
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:18,236
[SPEAKER_13]: But though some of the officers present that night at the motel did face various charges, none was ever convicted of any wrongdoing.

241
00:23:18,556 --> 00:23:19,036
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

242
00:23:19,596 --> 00:23:34,043
[SPEAKER_08]: The incident at the Algiers Motel embodied in stark and tragic form the tensions between African-Americans and the police in the city, the profound distrust, the regularity, frequency of harassment.

243
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:39,073
[SPEAKER_13]: You're listening to The Forum from the BBC World Service, where we're talking about the story of Detroit.

244
00:23:39,573 --> 00:23:48,996
[SPEAKER_13]: So far, we've heard how this American city was shaped by the car industry, became famous for its incredible cultural exports, and was transformed by the turbulent events of 1967.

245
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:57,138
[SPEAKER_13]: When we come back in a few moments, we'll talk about Detroit's first African-American mayor, who came to power in the 1970s.

246
00:23:57,658 --> 00:24:00,858
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'll also talk about the city's fall into bankruptcy.

247
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:03,059
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all coming up after the news summary.

248
00:24:04,364 --> 00:24:06,185
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the BBC World Service.

249
00:24:06,485 --> 00:24:08,667
[SPEAKER_14]: Now close your eyes and listen.

250
00:24:10,168 --> 00:24:12,449
[SPEAKER_12]: Sound is a powerful medium.

251
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:17,893
[SPEAKER_12]: It can take you from a busy market to outer space.

252
00:24:18,453 --> 00:24:20,414
[SPEAKER_12]: Create memorable characters.

253
00:24:20,454 --> 00:24:22,235
[SPEAKER_12]: Your dad believes I was here.

254
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,136
[SPEAKER_04]: But that doesn't make it a real memory.

255
00:24:24,156 --> 00:24:24,937
[SPEAKER_12]: To your dad it does.

256
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:27,258
[SPEAKER_12]: And intriguing plot lines.

257
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:28,259
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't see!

258
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:28,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are you?

259
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:29,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Here!

260
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,801
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to go!

261
00:24:30,901 --> 00:24:32,662
[SPEAKER_05]: I told you to stay in the car!

262
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:37,950
[SPEAKER_12]: If you have a story to tell, why not bring it to life in a radio play?

263
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:45,715
[SPEAKER_12]: Our international playwriting competition is free to enter and open to anyone living outside the UK.

264
00:24:46,175 --> 00:24:53,500
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a cash prize and a chance to visit London to see your play recorded for broadcast around the world.

265
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,261
[SPEAKER_14]: The International Playwriting Competition.

266
00:24:56,521 --> 00:25:03,225
[SPEAKER_14]: For details of how to enter and the full terms and conditions, go to bbcworldservice.com slash radio play.

267
00:25:04,467 --> 00:25:15,555
[SPEAKER_13]: Still to come on the Forum, more on the story of Detroit, how the North American city responded to the turbulent events of 1967, when violent unrest spread across the streets.

268
00:25:16,175 --> 00:25:20,618
[SPEAKER_13]: And after the city recently emerged from bankruptcy, what might the future look like?

269
00:25:20,998 --> 00:25:30,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Still with me are the writer Anna Clarke, the journalist Stephen Henderson, the scholar Thomas Segrew, and Herb Boyd, who's written a history of African-American life in Detroit.

270
00:25:31,085 --> 00:25:33,307
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll all be back after the news summary.

271
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,840
[SPEAKER_11]: BBC News.

272
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:42,403
[SPEAKER_11]: The US Republican Senator Jeff Flake says he won't run for re-election, adding there may be no place for him in the party.

273
00:25:42,983 --> 00:25:48,725
[SPEAKER_11]: He said US politics had become inured to reckless, outrageous and undignified behaviour from the White House.

274
00:25:49,485 --> 00:25:54,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Another Republican Senator, Bob Corker, earlier described Donald Trump as an utterly untruthful president.

275
00:25:56,227 --> 00:25:59,749
[SPEAKER_11]: Twitter is to introduce new rules for advertisements relating to elections.

276
00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:05,652
[SPEAKER_11]: It says it's responding to criticism of Russian interference in the 2016 US election.

277
00:26:06,292 --> 00:26:12,655
[SPEAKER_11]: The United States has threatened to introduce regulation over the lack of transparency in political spending on social media.

278
00:26:14,265 --> 00:26:20,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Russia has vetoed a UN resolution renewing the mandate of a mission investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.

279
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:24,970
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the ninth time Russia has used its veto to protect its ally.

280
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:29,892
[SPEAKER_11]: The investigators have said forensic tests show Syria has used nerve agents.

281
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:39,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Pakistan's Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif has said there's a huge trust deficit between his country and the United States over Afghanistan.

282
00:26:39,801 --> 00:26:46,582
[SPEAKER_11]: He blamed what he called the ineptitude of American and international forces in Afghanistan for not being able to end the conflict.

283
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:57,164
[SPEAKER_11]: The Venezuelan opposition coalition has been badly split after one of its leading members, a former presidential candidate Enrique Capriles, announced he would leave.

284
00:26:57,665 --> 00:27:09,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr Capriles said he was protesting against the decision by a group of newly elected opposition governors to pledge allegiance to a pro-government constituent assembly regarded as illegitimate by the coalition.

285
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:14,701
[SPEAKER_11]: Tanzania's government has banned a pro-opposition newspaper for three months.

286
00:27:15,161 --> 00:27:18,184
[SPEAKER_11]: Tanzania Daima is the fourth such closure since June.

287
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:25,451
[SPEAKER_11]: And a note written by Albert Einstein describing his theory on happy living has sold at auction for 1.56 million dollars.

288
00:27:26,031 --> 00:27:31,736
[SPEAKER_11]: It reads, a quiet and modest life brings more joy than a pursuit of success bound with constant unrest.

289
00:27:32,477 --> 00:27:33,318
[SPEAKER_11]: BBC News.

290
00:27:34,496 --> 00:27:40,203
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the forum from the BBC World Service where we're talking about the story of the North American city of Detroit.

291
00:27:40,723 --> 00:27:42,205
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm joined by four experts.

292
00:27:42,365 --> 00:27:47,091
[SPEAKER_13]: They are Anna Clarke, a writer who's researched literature from and about Detroit.

293
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:52,297
[SPEAKER_13]: Stephen Henderson, an award-winning journalist from that city who writes for the Detroit Free Press.

294
00:27:53,158 --> 00:28:04,123
[SPEAKER_13]: Thomas Sugrue, a scholar who's researched race and inequality in post-war Detroit, and Herb Boyd, whose latest book tells the history of that city through the lens of African-American experience.

295
00:28:04,803 --> 00:28:16,868
[SPEAKER_13]: So far, we've heard about the city's early story, its growth with the rise of the car in the early 20th century, the emergence of Berry Gordy's Motown music industry in the 1960s, and the events of July 1967, when unrest raged across the city.

296
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,091
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's turn now to the aftermath of that.

297
00:28:23,711 --> 00:28:26,552
[SPEAKER_13]: And Stephen, what was the aftermath of 1967?

298
00:28:26,632 --> 00:28:37,056
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we describe what happened to Detroit in the years and decades that followed as an extraordinary decline in comparison to the booming automobile city of the first half of the 20th century?

299
00:28:37,396 --> 00:28:40,337
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you paint a picture of the city you must have grown up in?

300
00:28:40,357 --> 00:28:42,778
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been a lot of, I think, mythology

301
00:28:43,518 --> 00:28:46,079
[SPEAKER_09]: that has grown up around 1967.

302
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:54,462
[SPEAKER_09]: One of those mythologies was that that was the turning point and that the city declined after 67 and as a result of 67.

303
00:28:54,502 --> 00:28:58,024
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's not entirely the case.

304
00:28:58,204 --> 00:29:06,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Detroit, because of slowdowns in the auto industry, because of changes in the international market in terms of

305
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:09,829
[SPEAKER_09]: manufacturing, Detroit had already started to decline by 1967.

306
00:29:10,069 --> 00:29:14,072
[SPEAKER_09]: It started to lose populations in the late 1950s.

307
00:29:14,192 --> 00:29:19,875
[SPEAKER_09]: And by 1967, its suburbs were growing exponentially.

308
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:27,820
[SPEAKER_09]: White people, primarily, were leaving the city in large, large numbers to try to find opportunity and space.

309
00:29:27,941 --> 00:29:29,902
[SPEAKER_09]: And we made it very easy for them by building

310
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:35,148
[SPEAKER_09]: more freeways through the middle of the city than any other major American urban center.

311
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:44,701
[SPEAKER_09]: The immediate reaction also to the rebellion in the city becomes an enhancement of the brutality by the police department after 67.

312
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,382
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is what

313
00:29:47,424 --> 00:29:55,226
[SPEAKER_09]: ultimately leads to the election of Coleman Young in 1973 as a reaction to those things.

314
00:29:55,647 --> 00:30:08,791
[SPEAKER_09]: This new, vibrant black mayor, first black mayor of the city, who really is energizing the idea among African-Americans that things can get better, that the city can survive and come back.

315
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:16,813
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll come on to Mayor Young in a moment, but Thomas, can I ask you to elaborate on what Stephen's saying about the long-term causes of this decline?

316
00:30:17,093 --> 00:30:30,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Detroit's decline as an industrial center and as a major city began in the heyday of the auto industry, a moment when America's economic strength globally was unchallenged.

317
00:30:31,926 --> 00:30:39,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Beginning in the early 1950s, the auto industry began to decentralize to other parts of the United States.

318
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:47,916
[SPEAKER_08]: foreshadowing a later movement of American industry to other parts of the world in search of lax regulation, lower taxes, and cheap labor.

319
00:30:48,676 --> 00:30:52,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Decline in the auto industry had devastating consequences for Detroit.

320
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:55,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Between the late 1940s and the early 1960s, Detroit lost about 130,000 manufacturing jobs.

321
00:31:00,642 --> 00:31:09,085
[SPEAKER_08]: In addition, in the post-Second World War II period, Detroit emerged as one of the most racially segregated metropolitan areas in the United States.

322
00:31:09,445 --> 00:31:18,349
[SPEAKER_08]: So all of those conspired, you could say, to lead to a population decline and an economic decline in Detroit well before the events of 1967.

323
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:31,794
[SPEAKER_13]: And as Stephen was saying, one man who was rising through the political ranks in the 1960s was Coleman Young, who in the early 1970s ran to become mayor of Detroit and won.

324
00:31:32,535 --> 00:31:38,563
[SPEAKER_13]: Stephen, by the 1970s, when Coleman Young was running for mayor, what was the platform that he stood on?

325
00:31:38,883 --> 00:31:44,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, first and foremost, he was standing for jobs and better housing for African Americans in the city.

326
00:31:44,668 --> 00:31:51,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Still a problem by 1973, even though it had boiled over in 1967.

327
00:31:51,853 --> 00:31:59,119
[SPEAKER_09]: But he was also specifically targeting police activity at that time, which between 1967 and 1973 actually got worse as it regarded

328
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:14,585
[SPEAKER_09]: the African-American community, the police started a special unit called Stop the Robberies, Enjoy Safe Streets, Stress, that was particularly brutal on African-Americans.

329
00:32:15,025 --> 00:32:22,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Young was a pushback against all of those things, but importantly, he was a pushback in a multiracial sense.

330
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:31,553
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, this is somebody who said blacks and whites together could live in the city, they could govern the city, and that things could get better for everyone.

331
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:35,794
[SPEAKER_13]: Thomas, Coleman Young has had his detractors as well as his supporters.

332
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:38,355
[SPEAKER_13]: How's his legacy being weighed up briefly?

333
00:32:38,675 --> 00:32:49,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Coleman Young became very controversial among white Detroiters and especially white suburbanites who saw him as the embodiment of a new black power politics.

334
00:32:51,318 --> 00:32:52,878
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a misreading of Young.

335
00:32:53,298 --> 00:33:00,200
[SPEAKER_08]: He believed also in collaborating closely with the white power elite, particularly with the city's corporate leadership.

336
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:15,228
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was deeply committed to building up the city's economic infrastructure in particular, although, as Stephen pointed out, his efforts to build up the city's economic infrastructure met with some really serious obstacles.

337
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:27,755
[SPEAKER_08]: But at that point, the ability of these economic efforts to revitalize the city's economy was ultimately quite limited for forces that were well beyond Coleman Young's control.

338
00:33:28,449 --> 00:33:33,091
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, through Young's many terms in office, change wasn't only taking place in City Hall.

339
00:33:33,371 --> 00:33:39,093
[SPEAKER_13]: It was also happening on the dance floor with techno, a kind of music that emerged in Detroit in these years.

340
00:33:39,713 --> 00:33:44,295
[SPEAKER_13]: Anna, there are three men who are often credited with creating the blueprint for techno, aren't there?

341
00:33:44,795 --> 00:33:46,276
[SPEAKER_13]: Who are they and what was their background?

342
00:33:47,024 --> 00:34:00,536
[SPEAKER_01]: The three most credited for the founding of techno in Detroit is Derek May, Juan Atkins, and Kevin Saunderson, who are collectively known as the Belleville Three, three African-American folks who bonded over their love of music.

343
00:34:00,656 --> 00:34:04,219
[SPEAKER_01]: And they eventually became DJs in the Detroit party scene.

344
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:06,000
[SPEAKER_01]: They came of age in the Coleman Young era.

345
00:34:06,061 --> 00:34:13,787
[SPEAKER_01]: They were born in the early 60s and were beginning to get out there with their musical experimentations in the late 70s, early 80s.

346
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:24,155
[SPEAKER_13]: Carlton Goles is the founder and executive director of the Detroit Sound Conservancy, which works to promote and support Detroit's sound and music heritage.

347
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:29,960
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's his introduction to techno as born in Detroit in the time of Coleman Young.

348
00:34:31,683 --> 00:34:35,365
[SPEAKER_00]: Techno emerged in Detroit in the late 70s and early 80s.

349
00:34:35,805 --> 00:34:48,591
[SPEAKER_00]: It was part of a larger global movement of different genres working in electronic and industrial music and in dance music and in disco that were converging around the world at that time.

350
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:59,537
[SPEAKER_00]: And Detroit was a place where it stepped off really the funkiest and in some cases the strongest and then was picked up later in the late 80s and became a global phenomenon.

351
00:35:03,607 --> 00:35:16,599
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important to know about Detroit Techno put in this context is that many of the people who created Detroit Techno really don't remember a world where black leadership wasn't incredibly prominent in the city.

352
00:35:17,019 --> 00:35:18,741
[SPEAKER_00]: Coleman Young was elected in 73.

353
00:35:19,121 --> 00:35:22,184
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who created Detroit Techno would have been very young at the time.

354
00:35:22,485 --> 00:35:24,807
[SPEAKER_00]: They saw themselves in leadership positions.

355
00:35:24,887 --> 00:35:27,849
[SPEAKER_00]: They saw a successful black middle class in a city.

356
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:36,653
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's sort of an exuberance and joy and attitude that comes from that, that I think you can hear in the music if you listen to it long enough.

357
00:35:37,393 --> 00:35:39,334
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a revolution here in the city of Detroit.

358
00:35:39,894 --> 00:35:44,635
[SPEAKER_00]: Detroit techno was part of that rebellion and revolution in America in the 60s, 70s, and 80s.

359
00:35:45,075 --> 00:35:51,517
[SPEAKER_00]: As director of Detroit Sound Conservancy, one of my jobs is to try to tell this more complicated story of Detroit.

360
00:35:51,538 --> 00:35:52,818
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ways we're doing that is we're

361
00:35:53,318 --> 00:36:02,062
[SPEAKER_00]: renovating an old sound system that one of the godfathers of Detroit techno, Ken Collier, played on in the 1980s and 1990s to Detroiters.

362
00:36:02,222 --> 00:36:07,564
[SPEAKER_00]: Bringing back that system is part of this process of retelling Detroit's story to the rest of the world.

363
00:36:09,045 --> 00:36:11,666
[SPEAKER_13]: Carlton Goles talking about the rise of techno.

364
00:36:12,006 --> 00:36:16,688
[SPEAKER_13]: The track you heard there was one version of Strings of Life from Rhythm is Rhythm.

365
00:36:17,283 --> 00:36:22,947
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Detroit continues to be a creative city, but in recent years, it's also faced some vast challenges.

366
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:31,353
[SPEAKER_13]: By the mid-1990s, its population had fallen to half its peak in the 1950s, and it's also faced severe financial problems.

367
00:36:31,693 --> 00:36:34,775
[SPEAKER_13]: And then in 2013, the city filed for bankruptcy.

368
00:36:35,435 --> 00:36:37,297
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an event that's had quite a back story.

369
00:36:37,837 --> 00:36:41,259
[SPEAKER_13]: Stephen, what did it mean for the city to be officially declared bankrupt?

370
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,941
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you explain in simple terms what that actually meant?

371
00:36:45,383 --> 00:36:57,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, in technical terms, what it meant was that we no longer had the means in the short-term or the long-term to shoulder the financial burdens that we had.

372
00:36:57,809 --> 00:37:06,514
[SPEAKER_09]: So one way to look at it was that at the time the bankruptcy was filed, Detroit and Detroiters owed

373
00:37:07,734 --> 00:37:13,597
[SPEAKER_09]: 33 times what the value of everything we owned in the city was.

374
00:37:14,037 --> 00:37:15,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, how did the city get there?

375
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:18,640
[SPEAKER_09]: There were a lot of different players.

376
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:35,308
[SPEAKER_09]: I wrote a lot in the run-up to the declaration of bankruptcy about the pattern of disinvestment that had unfolded over such a long time, disinvestment at the federal level, disinvestment at the state level.

377
00:37:36,609 --> 00:37:44,682
[SPEAKER_09]: I talked about the borrowing that we did in Detroit as a result of that disinvestment, just to keep the lights on, for instance.

378
00:37:44,702 --> 00:37:48,608
[SPEAKER_09]: We sort of had to just borrow to pay off borrowing.

379
00:37:49,165 --> 00:37:56,508
[SPEAKER_13]: Thomas, was this perhaps an inevitable result of the long story you've sketched out of Detroit's decline?

380
00:37:57,489 --> 00:38:00,610
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think was really behind the city getting to this point?

381
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:02,351
[SPEAKER_13]: How should we understand the story?

382
00:38:02,611 --> 00:38:09,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Detroit saw a hemorrhaging of its tax base as the result of the disappearance of manufacturers and jobs.

383
00:38:10,074 --> 00:38:13,796
[SPEAKER_08]: and because of the dramatic decline in the city's population.

384
00:38:14,716 --> 00:38:21,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Today, Detroit has only about 30% of the, 40% of the population that it had in 1950.

385
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:32,725
[SPEAKER_08]: In addition, the city faced racial hostility that played out in state and federal politics.

386
00:38:33,785 --> 00:38:37,267
[SPEAKER_08]: During the post-1960s period, there was a growing sense that

387
00:38:38,508 --> 00:38:48,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Detroit's problems, at least in the eyes of lawmakers in Lansing, the state capital, and in Washington, D.C., Detroit's problems were the problems of black misrule, of mismanagement.

388
00:38:49,315 --> 00:38:50,636
[SPEAKER_08]: It's their problem.

389
00:38:51,076 --> 00:38:57,100
[SPEAKER_08]: They should solve it themselves was a line that one heard increasingly in the halls of political power.

390
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,622
[SPEAKER_13]: And Stephen, what did all this look like on the ground?

391
00:39:00,042 --> 00:39:02,924
[SPEAKER_13]: How was the city's financial strife affecting everyday life?

392
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:16,515
[SPEAKER_09]: If you, for instance, had a fire in your house and called the fire department, the fire trucks would roll past two or three other closed fire departments on the way to your house.

393
00:39:17,115 --> 00:39:24,884
[SPEAKER_09]: and get there in 30 to 40 minutes, sufficient enough time for your house to burn to the ground before they got there.

394
00:39:25,265 --> 00:39:35,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Similarly, if you called a police officer to help you if you were in trouble, you could wait just as long for them to respond.

395
00:39:36,677 --> 00:39:43,621
[SPEAKER_09]: 40% of the streetlights in Detroit, we had 88,000 streetlights at that time, 40% of them were dark.

396
00:39:44,721 --> 00:39:53,886
[SPEAKER_09]: And so people who lived in neighborhoods from one end of the city to another, rich, poor, black, white, whatever, were wandering around at night in the dark.
