1
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,347
[SPEAKER_03]: This meeting is called to order.

2
00:10:02,387 --> 00:10:06,950
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the May 7th Public Health and Community Safety Committee.

3
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:15,975
[SPEAKER_03]: On the agenda today is our annual surveillance report presentation from the Medford Police Department.

4
00:10:16,796 --> 00:10:23,520
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from the community, I don't know what CCOP stands for.

5
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,420
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.

6
00:10:25,521 --> 00:10:27,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Community Control of

7
00:10:28,668 --> 00:10:29,549
[SPEAKER_03]: over public surveillance.

8
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:31,510
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew that.

9
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:37,074
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are going to be reviewing the 2024 Annual Surveillance Report.

10
00:10:37,194 --> 00:10:40,296
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would love to welcome Chief Buckley to the podium.

11
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:43,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for this report.

12
00:10:44,219 --> 00:10:48,182
[SPEAKER_03]: We had some time to review it since April.

13
00:10:48,462 --> 00:10:52,005
[SPEAKER_03]: And why don't you

14
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:55,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me your presentation.

15
00:10:55,817 --> 00:11:00,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a couple of questions, but I'd love to hear a summary of the report.

16
00:11:00,523 --> 00:11:04,088
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like 35 pages, so there's a lot in there.

17
00:11:04,108 --> 00:11:04,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Carry on.

18
00:11:07,143 --> 00:11:08,264
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just wanted to.

19
00:11:08,384 --> 00:11:14,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you for having us here and I'm happy to have submitted this report and I see that everyone has had a chance to review it.

20
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:20,292
[SPEAKER_09]: I did bring Lieutenant Pat Duffy here with me he is the commanding officer of the 41 camera unit.

21
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:28,298
[SPEAKER_09]: He, if we have to get into a little bit of how we redacted how we do the statistics etc he's probably much better at explaining these.

22
00:11:28,978 --> 00:11:31,579
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition, I have Officer Frank Casarino who works with them full-time.

23
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:32,799
[SPEAKER_09]: We have two full-time officers.

24
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:34,279
[SPEAKER_09]: They are the officers who handle that.

25
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:44,202
[SPEAKER_09]: And additionally, I brought Lieutenant Joe Casey, who's the public records access officer for the police department, should there be questions as it relates to that aspect of the body-worn cameras.

26
00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:55,925
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember last year in 2024, we presented the 23 annual surveillance report, and it was much shorter than this because we were only in operation with body-worn cameras for about one month.

27
00:11:57,005 --> 00:12:00,348
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a full year of the 41 cameras in play.

28
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:05,112
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have to say, we find the program to be successful.

29
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:15,020
[SPEAKER_09]: It is accomplishing all of the objectives that we as a police department wanted to, you know, want to obtain.

30
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:20,685
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, we, in 2024, officers made over 31,000 videos.

31
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:40,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Of those 31,1883 were related to rest now that doesn't specifically mean we had 1800 arrests, a single arrest may have 123 and or more body one camera so it's just we count them separately and how many videos that we actually record.

32
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:54,711
[SPEAKER_09]: And of all of these videos, 342 of them were requested by the district attorney's office to assist with their investigations and prosecutions.

33
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:59,474
[SPEAKER_09]: But technically not a public records request.

34
00:12:59,734 --> 00:13:01,175
[SPEAKER_09]: It's part of discovery in the courts.

35
00:13:01,195 --> 00:13:10,821
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still akin to a public records request, but they are far and away the largest agency or a group of people that we distribute our,

36
00:13:11,982 --> 00:13:25,570
[SPEAKER_09]: public records reports to separate from that separate from the district attorney's office there were 32 public records requests filed, of which four of them we could not, by law, fulfill.

37
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:31,333
[SPEAKER_09]: That's mostly because they were related to domestic violence cases will never share those videos as it comes out.

38
00:13:32,609 --> 00:13:37,091
[SPEAKER_09]: And we did audit the body-worn cameras.

39
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,373
[SPEAKER_09]: And if there's questions on that, we have an audit process.

40
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:47,736
[SPEAKER_09]: And we run three general scenarios where we check every officer's body-worn camera to see if they're complying.

41
00:13:47,816 --> 00:13:49,277
[SPEAKER_09]: And we keep statistics related to that.

42
00:13:49,777 --> 00:13:54,539
[SPEAKER_09]: That is definitely a Lieutenant Duffy area to talk about if you want to get into that once we're done.

43
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,722
[SPEAKER_09]: We are finding areas where we're doing well and areas where we need to improve, I think, as would be expected.

44
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:11,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Additionally, without audit we we audit our supervisors to make sure that they're accessing the appropriate videos and under their command and not just randomly.

45
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,891
[SPEAKER_09]: fall through, I would say that.

46
00:14:15,907 --> 00:14:17,448
[SPEAKER_09]: with some marked improvements.

47
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:20,049
[SPEAKER_09]: This program is doing very well.

48
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:23,051
[SPEAKER_09]: The costs are relatively the same from last year.

49
00:14:23,091 --> 00:14:29,154
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the salaries of my lieutenant and the patrol officer, Casarino, who's in there.

50
00:14:29,354 --> 00:14:31,135
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition, there's some overtime costs.

51
00:14:31,195 --> 00:14:36,278
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we get a number of requests for 41 cameras that are needed last second.

52
00:14:36,318 --> 00:14:39,200
[SPEAKER_09]: So those weren't totally calculated here.

53
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,562
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we need to purchase five more body-worn cameras.

54
00:14:42,622 --> 00:14:47,026
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can see the amount is $10,926 as it relates to that.

55
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:49,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Outside of that, there's a whole bunch of statistics here.

56
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:52,390
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if that's exactly what you want.

57
00:14:54,212 --> 00:14:55,993
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're there for people to review.

58
00:14:56,094 --> 00:15:03,820
[SPEAKER_09]: And if they're factual and people have an interest in those, they can ask questions of them.

59
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,304
[SPEAKER_09]: So in general, I think the program is running well.

60
00:15:08,888 --> 00:15:11,834
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we have no major issues.

61
00:15:13,097 --> 00:15:18,208
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm here to answer any questions I can as it relates to the use of the 41 cameras.

62
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:22,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

63
00:15:23,328 --> 00:15:31,409
[SPEAKER_03]: This being the first time you did the full year's worth of reporting, were there any issues you faced with?

64
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:44,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that occurred to me right in the beginning is the, were there any complications with, I mean, everything's, is everything self-reported or you audited the, there was like random samples taken

65
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:50,654
[SPEAKER_03]: of certain incidents and then that was reviewed.

66
00:15:51,535 --> 00:16:00,297
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't really the officers reporting themselves, it was that the team that was doing the audits was reviewing the data from the camera.

67
00:16:00,557 --> 00:16:01,037
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

68
00:16:01,077 --> 00:16:02,978
[SPEAKER_09]: The team will randomly just pick it.

69
00:16:02,998 --> 00:16:06,179
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll check my body on camera, they'll pick three just

70
00:16:07,664 --> 00:16:23,530
[SPEAKER_09]: random, like body worn cameras, they try to one has to be connected to a motor vehicle stop type stuff, and just a general incident, and they'll audit in that case, I will say that in many instances, if we're sending that body with camera off the court, they're doing that audit at that same time, right?

71
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:27,531
[SPEAKER_09]: So because they're reviewing the officers, but in general, they're just random audits.

72
00:16:29,612 --> 00:16:29,732
[SPEAKER_09]: The

73
00:16:30,798 --> 00:16:39,872
[SPEAKER_09]: all all body one camera that an officer produces is downloaded to our system anyway so they don't it's not like they have a selective choice of what to be reviewed we do it once it's gathered.

74
00:16:40,693 --> 00:16:40,813
[SPEAKER_09]: The.

75
00:16:44,717 --> 00:16:54,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Two things that I noticed in the review of the data that was pulled is that it seems like it's still difficult for everybody to remember to take their cameras, probably just because it's still kind of a new process.

76
00:16:55,667 --> 00:17:00,952
[SPEAKER_03]: And somebody is running out and they put their camera down or they're charging it and they ran out without it.

77
00:17:01,132 --> 00:17:07,398
[SPEAKER_03]: And the second thing is something that I noticed really consistently is, did the officer advise all involved they were being recorded?

78
00:17:08,518 --> 00:17:16,463
[SPEAKER_03]: In the audits, in the general incident audit, more often than not, they're not advising people that they're being recorded.

79
00:17:16,843 --> 00:17:21,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that like another thing about having to rewire your brain, it's the first thing you say?

80
00:17:21,846 --> 00:17:25,088
[SPEAKER_09]: So in both of them are, this is new practice, right?

81
00:17:25,108 --> 00:17:28,169
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have to get this drilled into offices and build them up.

82
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:31,851
[SPEAKER_09]: But they are two of the shortcomings that we want to improve on when it comes to that.

83
00:17:32,272 --> 00:17:33,933
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'll add a separate caveat too.

84
00:17:34,573 --> 00:17:45,602
[SPEAKER_09]: You know the body one cameras can sometimes we get to use them all the time so if I'm out there and I have that body one camera for about an hour and a half on a call and I show up at the police station again and I want to start writing a report.

85
00:17:46,642 --> 00:17:49,384
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm downloading that in the middle of the shift so.

86
00:17:50,642 --> 00:17:55,345
[SPEAKER_09]: as opposed to at the end of my shift, I'm putting it in there, everything is downloaded and I put the camera back on me.

87
00:17:55,365 --> 00:18:03,710
[SPEAKER_09]: And sometimes when you're doing that randomly throughout your shift, another call comes in, it could be a call of an emergency nature and you're gathering up your stuff and you go out the door and you forget.

88
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:15,677
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's, it's a little bit, it is still habit forming and stuff we have to work on, but it's for the reason that we're constantly downloading the 41 cameras to make sure that we have that data as soon as possible.

89
00:18:16,618 --> 00:18:20,904
[SPEAKER_09]: and that the officer doesn't have to wait at the end of the shift of a total that we get a lot of those.

90
00:18:20,984 --> 00:18:22,546
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot to grab my camera.

91
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:27,192
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think I had one more.

92
00:18:28,144 --> 00:18:43,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there, I was hoping when I was looking at the data that it might be at the beginning of the year that there would be higher incidence of forgetting or not advising people that they were being recorded, but I didn't notice that pattern.

93
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:52,814
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was wondering if I could ask, and maybe this is a question for you, Lieutenant, if there are methods being implemented to remediate those things.

94
00:18:53,194 --> 00:18:55,155
[SPEAKER_09]: So short of we spent the first year as,

95
00:18:57,972 --> 00:19:06,899
[SPEAKER_09]: not a training period, but like a grace period of like, look, we're not gonna get into a level of discipline yet because this is a totally new process and concept.

96
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:12,262
[SPEAKER_09]: The lieutenant does work consistently with officers who forget and advise and advise and advise.

97
00:19:12,302 --> 00:19:18,787
[SPEAKER_09]: But at some point we are probably going to get into the level where we have to just sit officers down a little bit more and make sure that's happening.

98
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:24,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Additionally, we're just gonna throw some more training at them and it's just habit form, right?

99
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:24,912
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will,

100
00:19:26,181 --> 00:19:37,482
[SPEAKER_09]: There's all sort of circumstances right not every call is a call where you can walk up as a police officer and say okay here's step one step two step three sometimes you're in the middle of it without, you know,

101
00:19:38,348 --> 00:19:41,048
[SPEAKER_09]: people yelling at each other and you don't really have that time.

102
00:19:41,108 --> 00:19:45,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Now the policy will say as soon as possible you do it, but you get caught up and you forget.

103
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:56,351
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a lot of extenuating circumstances is why a police officer on the street might be either distracted or forget to do those things to no fault of their own.

104
00:19:57,191 --> 00:20:04,973
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just something that we have to continue to work on and we will do so through training and exercises.

105
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:06,493
[SPEAKER_09]: But we see that as,

106
00:20:08,287 --> 00:20:12,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Having put this in policy, we've learned a lot about the 41-camera program.

107
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:13,968
[SPEAKER_09]: We've learned a lot about what happened to the police departments.

108
00:20:14,008 --> 00:20:20,950
[SPEAKER_09]: And they are seeing this across Massachusetts and other police departments, too, where there's little aspects that you forget.

109
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:25,251
[SPEAKER_09]: It's getting them to turn it on is the big part, and shut it off on the right time.

110
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,692
[SPEAKER_09]: And the advisements are coming along.

111
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:29,592
[SPEAKER_09]: It's habit.

112
00:20:29,652 --> 00:20:30,232
[SPEAKER_09]: It's practice.

113
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:30,832
[SPEAKER_09]: It's training.

114
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:35,173
[SPEAKER_09]: But to their defense, there are a lot of situations that are just volatile.

115
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,314
[SPEAKER_09]: And those things sometimes go out the window.

116
00:20:39,335 --> 00:20:40,677
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand.

117
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:46,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Vice President Collins is number four.

118
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:46,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

119
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:51,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

120
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:51,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait.

121
00:20:52,512 --> 00:20:52,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Enable.

122
00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:53,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Takes me a while, too.

123
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:54,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotcha.

124
00:20:54,395 --> 00:20:54,795
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

125
00:20:55,016 --> 00:20:55,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

126
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for being here, Chief.

127
00:20:57,129 --> 00:20:58,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice to see you.

128
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:05,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank you for your efforts in putting together the annual surveillance report and for your whole team, which for one, I'm sure was a collaborative effort.

129
00:21:07,112 --> 00:21:13,015
[SPEAKER_04]: As was stated, this is the first annual surveillance report that we're getting on the body-worn cameras program for a full year of usage.

130
00:21:13,075 --> 00:21:18,037
[SPEAKER_04]: When we spoke last year, I think it was just about like a month of 2023 that they had been in operation for.

131
00:21:18,057 --> 00:21:20,538
[SPEAKER_04]: This one is different in that we're

132
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Glad that we're really sinking our teeth in on this one.

133
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:29,255
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good to be able to see a full year's worth of reflections and data.

134
00:21:29,295 --> 00:21:34,698
[SPEAKER_04]: For folks who are just tuning in for the first time, I just want to set some context.

135
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:39,241
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the annual recording that we get on body-worn cameras.

136
00:21:40,402 --> 00:21:41,922
[SPEAKER_04]: through to year 2028.

137
00:21:42,042 --> 00:21:48,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Ordinarily, surveillance technology undergoes a use policy and impact report process.

138
00:21:48,304 --> 00:21:50,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Body-worn cameras were exempted from that through 2028.

139
00:21:50,304 --> 00:22:02,867
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think this makes this an all the more valuable part of this process, because this is our opportunity to discuss and to learn and to talk about those topics, which would otherwise we'd have several conversations about and several documents about.

140
00:22:09,554 --> 00:22:38,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I also just feel it's important to state that in terms of the goals of this ordinance that this report falls under, to me as one counselor, it's more important than ever to be having these conversations, and it's more important than ever to be refocusing on the goals behind all of the reporting and all of the conversations under the CCOPS ordinance, which is to make sure that residents in Medford are informed of what surveillance is going on in our community, to make sure that they have all of the information that they need about surveillance technologies that are approved in our community,

141
00:22:39,581 --> 00:22:47,037
[SPEAKER_04]: And to make sure that we are all of us as city leaders very aware of protocols and the policies to keep that information surveillance data secure.

142
00:22:50,642 --> 00:22:59,730
[SPEAKER_04]: It's important all the time, as we discussed a lot over the past couple of years, lots of security risks, cybersecurity concerns to take into account when we're talking about surveillance technology.

143
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:17,485
[SPEAKER_04]: And in these times when we know that there are other jurisdictions active and present and working in Medford, I think it's all the more incumbent on us to make sure that we're getting good information out to Medford residents and being really aware of what our policies are for keeping a very, very tight lid on the surveillance technology and data that we do have.

144
00:23:18,825 --> 00:23:25,767
[SPEAKER_04]: and staying really clear on those policies that make sure that we're only collecting the surveillance data that we absolutely need for local public safety goals.

145
00:23:26,707 --> 00:23:39,671
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just feel that that's important to state at this time, especially just a couple days after ICE was in Medford, again, for federal agendas that may or may not be related to local public safety goals.

146
00:23:42,472 --> 00:23:43,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Having said that,

147
00:23:46,703 --> 00:23:51,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, this is the second annual surveillance report that we've looked at on body-worn cameras.

148
00:23:51,767 --> 00:24:02,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I do just want to be transparent as we're talking about the guidelines of the report and state per the ordinance, we're supposed to receive the annual surveillance report by March 15.

149
00:24:02,735 --> 00:24:04,196
[SPEAKER_04]: We got this one on April 24.

150
00:24:05,157 --> 00:24:11,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Going forward, I think it's really helpful for us to get it by the first quarter so that we can have more time earlier in the year to review.

151
00:24:12,462 --> 00:24:20,128
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope that next year we can be more familiar with the cadence of reporting on a full year of body worn camera usage.

152
00:24:20,408 --> 00:24:22,870
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get that in the calendar and have it prepped up for that time.

153
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:23,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

154
00:24:23,651 --> 00:24:23,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

155
00:24:27,838 --> 00:24:30,260
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very useful to be able to look through a report, very thorough.

156
00:24:30,361 --> 00:24:41,211
[SPEAKER_04]: And speaking of, you know, the scope of the report, a lot of what is in there in my read is, you know, I'm more familiar with the ordinance than most because I drafted a lot of it.

157
00:24:41,832 --> 00:24:45,776
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of what is in the report is critical information, well organized, asked for.

158
00:24:45,796 --> 00:24:50,381
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some areas where those statistics are not asked for by the ordinance.

159
00:24:51,702 --> 00:25:13,680
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they can be valuable to be in there, but just in case that is inflating the scope of work, I just do want to clarify that mention of specific, some of the statistics that mention specific people requesting special notification forms or specific officers involved in certain reporting requirements, that's not asked for in the ordinance.

160
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,304
[SPEAKER_04]: So if that is inflating the scope of work, if that added to the timeline issues, that's actually not necessary.

161
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,087
[SPEAKER_04]: just wanted to take this opportunity to clarify that.

162
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:23,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Not an issue, yeah.

163
00:25:23,168 --> 00:25:23,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

164
00:25:23,848 --> 00:25:28,552
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think that there are some other, I'm sure we'll talk a lot more about the results of the internal audit later.

165
00:25:28,572 --> 00:25:38,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there are some other areas we're going forward would be helpful to have more detail and more of a story attached to those results of the internal, the results of the internal audits.

166
00:25:42,452 --> 00:25:51,850
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I had a couple quick I had a couple questions most relating to the results of the internal audits, but before I get further on that I just wanted to mention that again this is for folks who haven't.

167
00:25:54,045 --> 00:26:17,491
[SPEAKER_04]: tuned into meetings about this particular ordinance before, so folks can know we're talking about the goals of the annual surveillance report, and this is true of any surveillance technology administered by any city, any department or agency in the city, is to provide a high level and generalized summary of the policies and usages concerning the surveillance technology, how it's been used, if the user feels it has been effective, which the chief has stated he believes that it has,

168
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:18,771
[SPEAKER_04]: the city.

169
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:25,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Um whether and how often surveillance data was shared with external persons or entities, the number of public records requests received by the city.

170
00:26:26,353 --> 00:26:29,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Summary of any complaints or concerns that were received about it.

171
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,335
[SPEAKER_04]: The results of any audits.

172
00:26:32,075 --> 00:26:41,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether the civil liberties and civil rights of any communities of groups in the city of being or have been disproportionately impacted by the use of the surveillance technology estimate of the

173
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:50,762
[SPEAKER_04]: with entities outside of the city relating to that data.

174
00:26:51,123 --> 00:26:54,465
[SPEAKER_04]: And the report covered all of those topics, some more detailed than others.

175
00:26:54,825 --> 00:26:56,587
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for that thoroughness.

176
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:14,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of my specific questions for you, Chief and to your team related to the results of the internal audit on the body worn cameras and I appreciated the clarity around, there was an audit for use, and then an audit for access.

177
00:27:15,206 --> 00:27:15,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's important.

178
00:27:15,987 --> 00:27:17,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for breaking it down that way.

179
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:28,586
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I'm interpreting the report correctly, there was a random sampling that the internal audit drew from.

180
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:41,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I think in terms of the use audit, the biggest thing that jumped out to me was that it seemed like, in aggregate, in one in three cases, the officer did not advise all of the residents in their vicinity that they were being recorded.

181
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,895
[SPEAKER_04]: So that jumps out to me as the biggest red flag.

182
00:27:44,715 --> 00:27:47,677
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a pretty high number to be deviating from the policy.

183
00:27:47,697 --> 00:27:49,738
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm curious if you can fill out that picture with

184
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:57,865
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think isn't getting across what specific training is planned to make sure that we get that up to 99.9% instead of 33?

185
00:27:58,045 --> 00:27:58,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

186
00:27:59,086 --> 00:27:59,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

187
00:27:59,326 --> 00:28:06,332
[SPEAKER_09]: With permission of the chair, I'll bring my team up because they're the actual officers who do the audit and they can tell you a little bit of how they go into it and what they're seeing.

188
00:28:06,693 --> 00:28:06,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

189
00:28:06,993 --> 00:28:07,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

190
00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:17,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, some people, you know, I advise people that are dealing with it being recorded, but my little video, that person could have been the third or fourth person on scene.

191
00:28:19,215 --> 00:28:24,518
[SPEAKER_10]: per policy, it's up to the responsibility for the first responding officer to tell people they are being recorded.

192
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:29,860
[SPEAKER_10]: So we don't have the second person saying a third person saying fourth person saying in a chaotic scene.

193
00:28:30,561 --> 00:28:42,967
[SPEAKER_10]: So it may have been that this person was the fourth person on scene and just assume that the first person on scene advised everybody they were being recorded if you're a domestic in a small setting.

194
00:28:43,978 --> 00:28:50,888
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just didn't have the time or the resources to go back and look at all other seven videos just to check that person off.

195
00:28:50,928 --> 00:28:53,932
[SPEAKER_10]: So there are some instances where that probably did happen.

196
00:28:54,653 --> 00:28:59,699
[SPEAKER_10]: And like I said, there's some instances that they didn't advise and we're on people all the time that they have to.

197
00:29:01,355 --> 00:29:03,076
[SPEAKER_10]: notify people at roll calls.

198
00:29:03,596 --> 00:29:09,857
[SPEAKER_10]: If I see someone that is showing up a lot that they're not advising, I call them in and I tell them I got to do it.

199
00:29:09,997 --> 00:29:11,298
[SPEAKER_10]: And I usually don't have a problem.

200
00:29:11,398 --> 00:29:12,818
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a consistent problem.

201
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:15,019
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we have 31,000 videos.

202
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:19,860
[SPEAKER_10]: They're doing what they should be doing a great majority of the time.

203
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:22,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you.

204
00:29:22,933 --> 00:29:23,434
[SPEAKER_04]: That's helpful.

205
00:29:24,214 --> 00:29:34,399
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can understand it's a lot of footage to sift through to run down every individual case of, oh, did this person not say it because somebody, three officers ahead of them did.

206
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:42,123
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that is important information for us to have because the goal of this is to have an accurate picture of how effective is that training and really what is that number of

207
00:29:44,184 --> 00:29:47,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there residents who aren't being informed that they're being surveilled?

208
00:29:47,205 --> 00:29:53,166
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that everybody's picking this up as fast as they can, but especially in these times, it's very important.

209
00:29:53,206 --> 00:30:03,027
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for your efforts and making sure that the officers who need a reminder are getting reminders, but this is an issue of critical importance.

210
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:10,429
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can say that if anyone says they don't want to be recorded, unless there's like a crime going on, we shut our cameras off.

211
00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:15,713
[SPEAKER_10]: make a note of that at the request of the person being recorded.

212
00:30:15,733 --> 00:30:16,994
[SPEAKER_10]: They wanted us to shut our cameras off.

213
00:30:17,014 --> 00:30:17,575
[SPEAKER_10]: We shut them off.

214
00:30:18,075 --> 00:30:21,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, if we're in a call, we're going to be possibly making an arrest.

215
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:24,281
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to shut off that.

216
00:30:24,902 --> 00:30:33,270
[SPEAKER_10]: But we have not had, to my knowledge, one complaint where someone said, you were recording me, and I didn't know about it, to my knowledge.

217
00:30:34,218 --> 00:30:35,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, well, that's good to hear.

218
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:36,361
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very good to hear.

219
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:38,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for that context.

220
00:30:38,964 --> 00:30:40,086
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

221
00:30:40,807 --> 00:30:51,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I noted that there were also statistics on when officers either failed to start or failed to stop the recording, whether it was

222
00:30:52,922 --> 00:31:00,665
[SPEAKER_04]: You get to an incident, you forget to turn it on right at the start or you leave an incident and you forget to turn it off so maybe they're walking down the street walking to their cruiser.

223
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you speak a little bit more to cases like that.

224
00:31:03,485 --> 00:31:10,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Just based on the ones that I reviewed, if I come across a video where they're at a traffic stop, and they're already talking to the person.

225
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:15,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I failed them, because they should have started it as soon as they were walking up to the car.

226
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:25,983
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, I mean they could have pulled up to that car and the person who's trying to get out, or they saw something when they had to get out of the car quick and they weren't thinking to turn the camera on and again it's muscle memory.

227
00:31:27,263 --> 00:31:32,545
[SPEAKER_10]: There's, I don't see any ill intent on someone hiding anything or trying not to record it just.

228
00:31:33,929 --> 00:31:34,869
[SPEAKER_10]: they're not used to it yet.

229
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:38,411
[SPEAKER_10]: And they turn around as soon as they remember.

230
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:50,216
[SPEAKER_10]: And as far as the end of the call, sometimes they're clearing the call and they walk into the cruiser and something, they shut it off and something, they get called back.

231
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:52,477
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have two videos from that call.

232
00:31:52,997 --> 00:31:57,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they should have let the camera roll until they were clearing the scene completely.

233
00:31:58,843 --> 00:32:03,765
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's why they would get failed on something like that, because sometimes it just doesn't end when they think it's going to end.

234
00:32:03,805 --> 00:32:08,867
[SPEAKER_10]: They might get called back, potty call, and they see people still coming out of the house and they say, let's go back there.

235
00:32:09,267 --> 00:32:10,447
[SPEAKER_10]: But they stopped their camera.

236
00:32:10,968 --> 00:32:11,808
[SPEAKER_10]: They started up again.

237
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:17,450
[SPEAKER_10]: So I failed them on, just keep rolling to the very end, to you and your crew driving away.

238
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotcha.

239
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:22,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can see how that could be a blurry line sometimes of when does the episode end?

240
00:32:23,212 --> 00:32:23,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

241
00:32:23,372 --> 00:32:28,073
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, it's no ill intent, but they're just probably thinking that's something I could do to shut my camera off.

242
00:32:28,494 --> 00:32:28,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

243
00:32:28,954 --> 00:32:30,714
[SPEAKER_10]: And then something happens, and they're putting it back on.

244
00:32:31,434 --> 00:32:33,215
[SPEAKER_10]: But I tell them just keep rolling.

245
00:32:33,515 --> 00:32:36,796
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care if we have five minutes, if you want to cruise or drive away.

246
00:32:38,236 --> 00:32:38,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense.

247
00:32:38,817 --> 00:32:39,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

248
00:32:39,697 --> 00:32:50,600
[SPEAKER_04]: In cases where I'm curious, have cases come up where an officer forgot to stop the recording, and they didn't just get in the cruiser, they were out in the street scene, non-involved people are captured

249
00:32:52,317 --> 00:32:53,738
[SPEAKER_04]: that you came across in your audit.

250
00:32:53,758 --> 00:33:00,445
[SPEAKER_04]: My concern is a camera not stopping and then people being surveilled who are just, you know, walking to Duncan going on the street.

251
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:06,310
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't say I've seen anything that I that would be alarming to me that it kept going and going and going.

252
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:11,054
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be more just like I said that continue to talk to another officer after they cleared something.

253
00:33:11,555 --> 00:33:14,938
[SPEAKER_10]: And they did one of them left their camera and they talked for 15 minutes between the two but

254
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:17,289
[SPEAKER_10]: not keeping it recording.

255
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:22,431
[SPEAKER_10]: And because we have an alarm that goes off every four minutes that notifies that they're recording it buzzes.

256
00:33:23,152 --> 00:33:23,472
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

257
00:33:23,612 --> 00:33:23,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

258
00:33:24,072 --> 00:33:24,552
[SPEAKER_04]: That's helpful.

259
00:33:24,612 --> 00:33:33,616
[SPEAKER_04]: And the intent of my question is just, obviously, I think we're all very lasered in on wanting to make sure that there's not superfluous surveillance of people going on.

260
00:33:33,676 --> 00:33:34,977
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the intent behind the question.

261
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:37,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Glad to hear that that hasn't come up.

262
00:33:37,918 --> 00:33:38,119
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

263
00:33:38,339 --> 00:33:38,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

264
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:39,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

265
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:40,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

266
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:44,402
[SPEAKER_04]: This might be more of a Chief Buckley question.

267
00:33:46,818 --> 00:33:54,704
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could just speak a little bit more to the purchase of the additional cameras and the equipment that was made last year, was that just to outfit more officers?

268
00:33:54,744 --> 00:33:56,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that to replenish equipment?

269
00:33:58,006 --> 00:33:59,467
[SPEAKER_09]: You have the wrong person.

270
00:33:59,687 --> 00:34:00,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, guess wrong.

271
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:05,011
[SPEAKER_09]: I approve it, but he is the additional 541 cameras.

272
00:34:05,912 --> 00:34:11,536
[SPEAKER_10]: We were running low, and we plan on hiring people, so we wanted to make sure we had

273
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:14,937
[SPEAKER_10]: How about your cameras?

274
00:34:15,237 --> 00:34:16,098
[SPEAKER_10]: It was simple as that.

275
00:34:16,478 --> 00:34:16,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

276
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,846
[SPEAKER_09]: There are times cameras will go down or so we need replacements to be able to handle all the different offices.

277
00:34:24,886 --> 00:34:26,568
[SPEAKER_09]: So five is just not enough.

278
00:34:26,588 --> 00:34:28,369
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're going to need more eventually anyway.

279
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:28,549
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

280
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:34,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it current policy that any officer out in the community will be outfitted with a camera?

281
00:34:35,376 --> 00:34:35,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

282
00:34:35,736 --> 00:34:35,916
Okay.

283
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:36,217
Yep.

284
00:34:36,597 --> 00:34:36,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

285
00:34:37,278 --> 00:34:37,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

286
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:41,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Every officer has a camera, and they're responsible for that camera.

287
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:45,531
[SPEAKER_10]: And if something goes wrong, no one's lost or anything like that.

288
00:34:45,731 --> 00:34:47,652
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's just like their own piece of equipment.

289
00:34:47,672 --> 00:34:48,692
[SPEAKER_10]: They're responsible for it.

290
00:34:49,612 --> 00:34:52,573
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not trading them around and dropping them off.

291
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:53,934
[SPEAKER_10]: And no one's losing them.

292
00:34:54,074 --> 00:34:54,934
[SPEAKER_10]: They take good care of them.

293
00:34:55,274 --> 00:34:55,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

294
00:34:55,654 --> 00:34:55,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure.

295
00:34:55,954 --> 00:34:56,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

296
00:34:57,635 --> 00:34:57,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

297
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:01,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything more that you can share?

298
00:35:03,057 --> 00:35:07,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Given that these have been in use for, I was going to say, 13 months, but more than that now, coming up on

299
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:11,337
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, getting close to two years of usage.

300
00:35:11,377 --> 00:35:23,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious if there are any updates to the outfitting and training protocols, given that the department now has more experience with both using them and with training officers to use them.

301
00:35:23,602 --> 00:35:27,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Have there been any changes to the training protocol as we've spent more time with these?

302
00:35:28,312 --> 00:35:41,321
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think so we're keeping the pretty much the same training protocols going forward and there'd be, I'd like to tell you that they're becoming second nature as part of how we operate after after a full year, and of course there are things that we recognize we have to work on.

303
00:35:42,161 --> 00:35:45,564
[SPEAKER_09]: But the training remains the same right it's this the problems that we're having to not.

304
00:35:47,152 --> 00:35:56,196
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the technology is the technology, it's the human behavior of turning off at the right time turning on the wrong time, and that the action of advising people.

305
00:35:58,517 --> 00:36:02,059
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think training is going to continue the way we've.

306
00:36:04,124 --> 00:36:07,045
[SPEAKER_09]: been doing it with the hope of sort of increasing numbers.

307
00:36:08,026 --> 00:36:21,410
[SPEAKER_09]: But I will go back because I probably should have mentioned earlier, the randomness of these audits, maybe are potentially are creating some of these statistical statistical anomalies, because we're just grabbing a video from Chief Jack Buckley.

308
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:29,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, again, if he's the second, third, fourth officer on it, we were grading him on that call based on the questions and statistics, but

309
00:36:30,483 --> 00:36:44,941
[SPEAKER_09]: He may have already abided by policy because the first officer and see that's something but if we were to go back and say okay, let me check and see if that happened, who was the first officer, we would never get an audit that would take that long for us to get through all of these audits.

310
00:36:46,112 --> 00:36:57,239
[SPEAKER_09]: So it is sort of problematic statistically that we don't have the full picture of who else was on the scene when we're taking these audits, but we are just looking at them straightforward and then trying to improve on those numbers.

311
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:58,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotcha.

312
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:58,760
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.

313
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I can understand that would multiply the work significantly.

314
00:37:01,662 --> 00:37:09,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it could be interesting, maybe this would be a useful part of the narrative for next year's reporting, is not to apply that auditing scheme to

315
00:37:11,705 --> 00:37:28,035
[SPEAKER_04]: to every interaction that you do audit, but just one or two to say, can we verify in this case, was it really just that they already heard somebody say it to try to identify if there are gaps there or if it can be perhaps a little bit more confidently attributed to somebody else got to it first.

316
00:37:28,576 --> 00:37:30,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, makes sense to some degree.

317
00:37:30,397 --> 00:37:32,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

318
00:37:32,498 --> 00:37:32,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

319
00:37:33,259 --> 00:37:35,880
[SPEAKER_04]: In your experience, I know that you've said a lot of this is muscle memory.

320
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,643
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes time to get used to using these and used to the protocols.

321
00:37:42,154 --> 00:37:50,617
[SPEAKER_04]: In your experience, and I'm talking high level here, do you see officers getting more comfortable and getting more accustomed to saying the disclaimer over the course of the year?

322
00:37:50,637 --> 00:37:54,398
[SPEAKER_04]: I know this report is kind of a snapshot of the full year.

323
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:59,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you feel that January to December officers are improving at the disclaimer?

324
00:37:59,859 --> 00:38:00,620
[SPEAKER_09]: You can have two answers.

325
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,860
[SPEAKER_09]: From a high level, I say yes.

326
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:04,841
[SPEAKER_09]: But from the lieutenant who's reviewing this on a daily basis,

327
00:38:05,757 --> 00:38:06,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

328
00:38:06,298 --> 00:38:16,265
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, in the beginning, you could see people, especially more of the low key officers were a little maybe uncomfortable or felt reluctant to say it because they were nervous or whatever.

329
00:38:16,525 --> 00:38:17,806
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't part of the repertoire.

330
00:38:18,967 --> 00:38:20,128
[SPEAKER_10]: But now it's second nature.

331
00:38:20,168 --> 00:38:21,989
[SPEAKER_10]: They get right out of the car, right, show right up.

332
00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:24,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, just so you know, you're being audio and visual recorded.

333
00:38:25,112 --> 00:38:27,474
[SPEAKER_10]: And some of them are really, really good at it.

334
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:28,755
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of them do it.

335
00:38:28,815 --> 00:38:31,877
[SPEAKER_10]: And some of them might, might be a little weak on it, but they do it.

336
00:38:33,015 --> 00:38:46,238
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm telling you, I look at thousands of videos, and Officer Casarino does too, and he'll tell me if he sees someone that's having a problem, and we don't see anyone that sticks out, that will say that he's not doing a good job.

337
00:38:46,638 --> 00:38:51,800
[SPEAKER_10]: If anyone even gets close to being a somewhat issue, we're calling them in, and we're addressing it.

338
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,140
[SPEAKER_10]: We're telling their sergeant to keep an eye on them.

339
00:38:54,580 --> 00:39:00,782
[SPEAKER_10]: We are following up and watching their videos from the time we talk to them, and it's not a major problem.

340
00:39:02,388 --> 00:39:03,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you for your fairness.

341
00:39:03,749 --> 00:39:08,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Another point to kind of highlight some of the difficulties we have.

342
00:39:08,672 --> 00:39:11,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep in mind that every officer has a body-worn camera.

343
00:39:11,794 --> 00:39:22,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I think, naturally, when we talk about these in an open forum like this, we're thinking of the patrol officer who's in a cruiser responding to call after call, and their habits are getting much better.

344
00:39:23,101 --> 00:39:25,982
[SPEAKER_09]: The worst person in the department is probably myself.

345
00:39:26,082 --> 00:39:27,443
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I have a body-worn camera.

346
00:39:27,643 --> 00:39:28,344
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm turning it on.

347
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:34,183
[SPEAKER_09]: three times a year, maybe, and it's just not a habit that is forming for me, right?

348
00:39:34,243 --> 00:39:44,412
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I wrote the policy, I know all these policies, but some of the audits and what we're doing with people who are not just using body-worn camera every single day and every interaction within their careers, right?

349
00:39:44,432 --> 00:39:52,700
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a degree in how much a police officer would use that versus another police officer when it comes down to it.

350
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:54,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Understandable.

351
00:39:55,391 --> 00:39:58,235
[SPEAKER_04]: And I appreciate both of your attention to this issue.

352
00:39:58,315 --> 00:40:08,087
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously, you know, my take on it, I think it's really important that we do that disclaimer every single time in addition to all of the other essentially security protocols that are baked into this policy.

353
00:40:08,267 --> 00:40:12,952
[SPEAKER_04]: So appreciate your commitment to making sure that we get better and better at those as time goes on.

354
00:40:13,853 --> 00:40:14,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

355
00:40:14,713 --> 00:40:20,276
[SPEAKER_04]: And just my last question for right now, most of my questions are around the use audit relating to the access audit.

356
00:40:20,316 --> 00:40:25,158
[SPEAKER_04]: It seemed like there was much fewer issues that popped up in that one.

357
00:40:25,198 --> 00:40:27,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any, can you just fill in the picture a little bit for us?

358
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:40,484
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's the only, the higher level officers that would be accessing videotape in any case, and that would be only if in the event of a specific trigger, if there's a specific reason or justification for them to be using that.

359
00:40:41,224 --> 00:40:51,250
[SPEAKER_04]: for them viewing that video footage, could you speak a little bit to how that audit worked with the access audit and any findings or updates to trainings that you're planning?

360
00:40:51,911 --> 00:40:54,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so I'll speak to the intent and then we can get to the audit with the lieutenant.

361
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:59,836
[SPEAKER_09]: So the intent is that we just don't want people watching body-worn cameras that they have no real interest in.

362
00:41:00,316 --> 00:41:01,617
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll use the extreme example.

363
00:41:01,837 --> 00:41:03,178
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not look at body-worn camera video.

364
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:06,072
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't, I don't access my office's body-worn cameras.

365
00:41:06,132 --> 00:41:10,095
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't sit there and see what people are doing during the course of the day.

366
00:41:10,575 --> 00:41:14,038
[SPEAKER_09]: The only time I will access a video is if there's a need to, right?

367
00:41:14,118 --> 00:41:17,301
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's there, few and far between.

368
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Outside of that, we will have a command level.

369
00:41:20,023 --> 00:41:28,049
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're a patrol officer, your sergeant has access to review your body-worn camera video to make sure a report is accurate on what you're doing on that shift, as well as your lieutenant.

370
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Outside of that chain of command,

371
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:33,532
[SPEAKER_09]: nobody should be looking at those body-worn cameras videos.

372
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:40,676
[SPEAKER_09]: There is exceptions made for detectives when they can get assigned a case, they should have access to body-worn cameras and they could have to review.

373
00:41:41,697 --> 00:41:43,037
[SPEAKER_09]: But as far as the audit goes.

374
00:41:44,258 --> 00:41:50,702
[SPEAKER_10]: Like the chief said, we have a video evidence library and right now we have 40,000 videos.

375
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:55,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Each officer can only access their own videos.

376
00:41:56,775 --> 00:42:02,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Detectives, sergeants, lieutenants, captains and the chief have access to all 40,000 videos.

377
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:19,270
[SPEAKER_10]: To prevent anyone from video surfing, what I did was picked out some of our more high profile calls where people talked about it or there were several officers on scene so there'd be a lot of videos.

378
00:42:20,191 --> 00:42:22,593
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm the only one that has access to that audit.

379
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:25,535
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would access who looked at that video.

380
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:30,151
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I would see if they were justified in looking at that video.

381
00:42:30,891 --> 00:42:33,172
[SPEAKER_10]: See if that was the sergeant that was on scene.

382
00:42:33,312 --> 00:42:33,832
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine.

383
00:42:34,072 --> 00:42:35,853
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the lieutenant that was working that shift.

384
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:36,473
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine.

385
00:42:37,734 --> 00:42:41,775
[SPEAKER_10]: For instance, it's a break in and entering, and now a detective is assigned to it.

386
00:42:42,135 --> 00:42:43,295
[SPEAKER_10]: That detective's looking at it.

387
00:42:43,735 --> 00:42:44,296
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine.

388
00:42:44,876 --> 00:42:48,097
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's how I was able to audit those calls.

389
00:42:48,897 --> 00:42:54,399
[SPEAKER_10]: And there really is no desire from speaking to the majority of supervisors over the year

390
00:42:55,665 --> 00:42:57,866
[SPEAKER_10]: they don't want to look at any videos that they don't have to.

391
00:43:00,067 --> 00:43:00,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Great work.

392
00:43:02,348 --> 00:43:02,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

393
00:43:03,129 --> 00:43:03,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

394
00:43:03,489 --> 00:43:03,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

395
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:18,616
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, with all of these questions, it's not a line of query is not about any sort of bad faith from the force, but rather wanting to make sure that there are these really secure protocols and just giving the city council a chance to hear what are the security measures that are in place?

396
00:43:18,676 --> 00:43:19,997
[SPEAKER_04]: How are they being enforced and maintained?

397
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:21,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

398
00:43:21,998 --> 00:43:22,179
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

399
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:24,200
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll probably have more later, but I think that's it for me for now.

400
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:24,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

401
00:43:27,703 --> 00:43:29,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a point of information.

402
00:43:29,424 --> 00:43:30,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I had two interactions.

403
00:43:30,886 --> 00:43:38,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Malden also has body-worn cameras, and I had two interactions at the Malden Warming Center this winter with some officers.

404
00:43:39,472 --> 00:43:41,474
[SPEAKER_03]: One was an extremely chaotic night.

405
00:43:41,554 --> 00:43:44,176
[SPEAKER_03]: I was not the first person to see the officer and

406
00:43:45,297 --> 00:43:52,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I was running back and forth in the center and I ran back and talked to him to help them address a concern.

407
00:43:52,781 --> 00:44:01,046
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't hear him say, you're being recorded but I think it was probably because he said it when he walked in the door to somebody else.

408
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,428
[SPEAKER_03]: And the second time.

409
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:09,112
[SPEAKER_03]: It was somebody that I talked to outside who was just asking if we were at capacity.

410
00:44:09,132 --> 00:44:12,374
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, do I have your consent to record?

411
00:44:12,594 --> 00:44:14,276
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, yeah, why?

412
00:44:14,296 --> 00:44:16,157
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was like, are you guys at capacity tonight?

413
00:44:16,177 --> 00:44:16,818
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, we are.

414
00:44:16,858 --> 00:44:17,678
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was like, OK, bye.

415
00:44:18,519 --> 00:44:20,180
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the whole interaction.

416
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, you recorded that?

417
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:21,601
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.

418
00:44:22,022 --> 00:44:23,163
[SPEAKER_03]: But every single time, of course.

419
00:44:24,523 --> 00:44:29,746
[SPEAKER_03]: But even, I mean, even the first interaction, I don't doubt that he said it, he probably did.

420
00:44:30,146 --> 00:44:34,328
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just missed it because I was, it was an extremely chaotic night.

421
00:44:34,428 --> 00:44:39,930
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's, but I think muscle memory is exactly it, right?

422
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:43,212
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just part of the thing, you know, after a while,

423
00:44:44,677 --> 00:44:46,678
[SPEAKER_03]: probably when they first did Miranda roads, it was the same thing.

424
00:44:46,718 --> 00:44:49,099
[SPEAKER_03]: And people didn't weren't used to saying them.

425
00:44:49,419 --> 00:44:50,220
[SPEAKER_03]: And then now they do.

426
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:56,603
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate your all of your responses.

427
00:44:56,683 --> 00:45:01,505
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems like you're very thoughtful about the ways you're going about handling this stuff.

428
00:45:01,525 --> 00:45:02,125
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate it.

429
00:45:03,146 --> 00:45:07,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Callahan has had her mic request on for a long time.

430
00:45:07,267 --> 00:45:08,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I will go to Councilor Callahan.

431
00:45:10,024 --> 00:45:10,284
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

432
00:45:10,584 --> 00:45:12,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for being here.

433
00:45:12,485 --> 00:45:24,049
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have a really kind of a follow-up question to Chair Lazaro's, just because I did notice that the sort of percent and number of incidents between January and December didn't seem to change.

434
00:45:24,909 --> 00:45:35,633
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think I understood that, Chief Buckley, your response was that there are actually types of incidents that are just difficult to, you know, make that happen from beginning to end.

435
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:43,803
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was curious if there if, like how our sort of percentage rate compares to other.

436
00:45:46,403 --> 00:45:48,444
[SPEAKER_11]: cities who also use body worn cameras.

437
00:45:48,864 --> 00:45:58,570
[SPEAKER_11]: If we have a goal, if we have already reached the goal in terms of like percent of, you know, special notification forms that we get per month compared to like out of the recorded events.

438
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:14,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so just curious if, uh, we feel like we are at our goal like as an average of 0.72 or if we think we can get better, or do we think that this is where we're where we're expected to be a year or two from now?

439
00:46:14,766 --> 00:46:21,293
[SPEAKER_10]: I've spoken to several departments, and more than not, they don't even do audits.

440
00:46:23,015 --> 00:46:28,681
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was just at a recent department myself and Officer Casarino, they're not even entertaining audits.

441
00:46:30,747 --> 00:46:37,069
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say that we're probably leading the pack as far as doing the audit, by far.

442
00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:44,512
[SPEAKER_10]: If someone can produce another department's audit that's better than this, then we'll work to improve it and be better than them.

443
00:46:44,632 --> 00:46:45,672
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't see one.

444
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:47,273
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm talking to them.

445
00:46:48,373 --> 00:46:48,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

446
00:46:49,093 --> 00:46:54,355
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd just like to add that we did come in here and we openly say, these are numbers that we want to improve.

447
00:46:55,015 --> 00:47:00,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Having said that, we're less than 3 quarters of 1 percentage point off

448
00:47:02,218 --> 00:47:06,984
[SPEAKER_09]: If you would, we didn't set a goal I wouldn't set a number this is a first year we're looking at if you would ask me to set a goal.

449
00:47:07,645 --> 00:47:16,035
[SPEAKER_09]: What would that number be half a percentage point, I mean, it's it's difficult to that's probably we're working with such infant test.

450
00:47:17,218 --> 00:47:21,681
[SPEAKER_09]: small numbers that we will, we'll just keep working to kind of improve that process.

451
00:47:21,721 --> 00:47:24,423
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, it's not bad.

452
00:47:25,444 --> 00:47:27,185
[SPEAKER_09]: And we are auditing it and the things.

453
00:47:27,685 --> 00:47:30,767
[SPEAKER_09]: But I did say, and I openly say, we came in here saying we want to improve on that.

454
00:47:30,827 --> 00:47:32,508
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will continue to work on that.

455
00:47:33,149 --> 00:47:36,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

456
00:47:36,531 --> 00:47:37,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Councillor Lemming.

457
00:47:39,253 --> 00:47:39,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

458
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:45,017
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank, I'd like to thank all of y'all for coming out here tonight and

459
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:48,183
[SPEAKER_05]: presenting the report and answering our questions.

460
00:47:50,044 --> 00:48:12,649
[SPEAKER_05]: In the statistics section where it talks about the special reports, the special notifications forms that were submitted, looking at the month to month fail to activate ones, it's a pretty consistent amount there between nine and

461
00:48:14,885 --> 00:48:17,829
[SPEAKER_05]: 15 from each month reported in 2024.

462
00:48:17,909 --> 00:48:18,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm curious, is it

463
00:48:23,146 --> 00:48:31,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it completely different officers who have these failed to activate reports submitted each time?

464
00:48:31,632 --> 00:48:36,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it sort of a smaller subsection of officers?

465
00:48:36,295 --> 00:48:48,063
[SPEAKER_05]: It says in the paragraph above that this is usually due to an officer being at the police station and then just forgetting to bring their body-worn camera when they're taken out in an emergency.

466
00:48:49,143 --> 00:48:50,144
[SPEAKER_05]: So that does seem to be

467
00:48:51,966 --> 00:48:52,529
[SPEAKER_05]: another human.

468
00:48:54,065 --> 00:48:54,365
[SPEAKER_05]: error.

469
00:48:54,646 --> 00:48:56,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of these are technical.

470
00:48:56,307 --> 00:49:03,393
[SPEAKER_05]: It says they have to do with the Motorola failure on the technical end.

471
00:49:04,013 --> 00:49:18,885
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm curious if these cases of failure to activate are due to, if they're completely random across the department, or if you happen to know if it's smaller.

472
00:49:19,886 --> 00:49:21,828
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd say it's the majority of the patrol division.

473
00:49:22,987 --> 00:49:29,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the majority of probably these fail to activate are, these are self-reported by the officer.

474
00:49:30,213 --> 00:49:31,313
[SPEAKER_10]: They fill out this form.

475
00:49:31,654 --> 00:49:35,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Most of the time, a supervisor even go on to them and say, you didn't make a recording.

476
00:49:35,937 --> 00:49:39,279
[SPEAKER_10]: They run out of the station to back their partner up or whatever.

477
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:41,801
[SPEAKER_10]: They get their camera, say, I'm not going back.

478
00:49:41,881 --> 00:49:43,542
[SPEAKER_10]: My partner will have his camera on.

479
00:49:44,163 --> 00:49:46,424
[SPEAKER_10]: That's more important to back his partner up.

480
00:49:46,444 --> 00:49:47,945
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there was going to be a camera there.

481
00:49:48,506 --> 00:49:50,748
[SPEAKER_10]: And they come back and they fill out this form.

482
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:57,170
[SPEAKER_05]: You actually answered my other question right there in your response, which is how how is it?

483
00:49:57,710 --> 00:49:58,651
[SPEAKER_05]: How is it reported?

484
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:03,713
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is the patrol division, as you said, but do

485
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:13,627
[SPEAKER_05]: But is it has like everybody in the patrol division kind of like made this like made this mistake sort of once or twice throughout the year.

486
00:50:13,667 --> 00:50:16,309
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just kind of like a random things that happens to everybody.

487
00:50:16,469 --> 00:50:21,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Or do you see like a couple of like a couple that you see self-reported?

488
00:50:21,613 --> 00:50:27,938
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure there are officers that have never had an issue and there probably are officers that had three or four times during the year that we spoke to them.

489
00:50:29,712 --> 00:50:36,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, there's no one person that's 10, 12, 15 times over the course of the year, that would be a red flag for us.

490
00:50:38,039 --> 00:50:39,360
[SPEAKER_10]: It's more once or twice.

491
00:50:40,341 --> 00:50:43,403
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's probably several offices that haven't had any issues.

492
00:50:45,165 --> 00:50:45,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.

493
00:50:46,886 --> 00:50:49,428
[SPEAKER_05]: That answers the question.

494
00:50:49,448 --> 00:50:51,090
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the only thing that I was

495
00:50:52,384 --> 00:50:57,790
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the only thing that I was curious about in the report.

496
00:50:59,392 --> 00:50:59,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

497
00:50:59,952 --> 00:51:02,915
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

498
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:10,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep in mind that we respond to thousands and thousands and thousands of calls each month at police offices.

499
00:51:11,064 --> 00:51:12,626
[SPEAKER_09]: These are the numbers we're getting.

500
00:51:14,911 --> 00:51:26,116
[SPEAKER_05]: see that it's like it was just just for context, this is, I believe it was, yeah, it was saying that it was a 2024, 224 of these special notifications forms were filed, of which 131 were failed to activate, and this seems to be out of

501
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:38,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a 31,326 with 224 special notifications forms and it says here that's point 72%.

502
00:51:38,893 --> 00:51:43,997
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, just for just for anybody from the public watching what I was having questions about was

503
00:51:52,675 --> 00:51:57,578
[SPEAKER_05]: an extremely low percentage of the overall cases.

504
00:51:57,738 --> 00:52:05,081
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just curious about the overall trends within the department if these were completely random.

505
00:52:05,602 --> 00:52:12,925
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, the failure to activate is not something that happens often by any stretch of the imagination.

506
00:52:12,965 --> 00:52:14,786
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for clarifying that.

507
00:52:14,806 --> 00:52:21,730
[SPEAKER_10]: May I add to also, when we have three or four officers that go to a call that results in an arrest, and when the district attorney requests

508
00:52:22,365 --> 00:52:42,176
[SPEAKER_10]: the body one footage, they will look at the report and request every officer on scene, their footage, and then officer Casarino myself will go through, find those videos and send them over if we come across officer x was at that call, and there was no video.

509
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:52,592
[SPEAKER_10]: he better have a special notification form, because the court also requests, after we tell them that there's no video, they want that special notification form.

510
00:52:52,953 --> 00:52:58,536
[SPEAKER_10]: So these officers don't want to be filling out a special notification form saying, I didn't turn my camera on.

511
00:52:58,896 --> 00:53:04,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if it's especially on something like an arrest, they're going to be called to court and say, why didn't you turn your camera on?

512
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:11,584
[SPEAKER_10]: So there are a lot of safeguards that we can figure out who didn't turn their camera on.

513
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:17,667
[SPEAKER_10]: If they didn't, 99% of the time, they fill out a special notification form.

514
00:53:18,027 --> 00:53:23,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if we're not asking for it, the district attorney is going to ask for it when they request that, but in discovery.

515
00:53:25,901 --> 00:53:32,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you guys presenting this report to us with so much thoroughness.

516
00:53:32,946 --> 00:53:35,468
[SPEAKER_03]: It's our first time seeing it to this degree.

517
00:53:36,348 --> 00:53:47,235
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a new technology, it's a new ordinance with the reporting requirement, and it's our first time having access to this level of data, and we're also learning about

518
00:53:48,936 --> 00:53:50,537
[SPEAKER_03]: how you process the data.

519
00:53:50,737 --> 00:53:56,780
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've had a lot of questions today and I appreciate your comprehensive, thorough responses.

520
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,881
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you very much.

521
00:53:59,921 --> 00:54:03,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Do any other councillors have any comments or questions at this time?

522
00:54:03,203 --> 00:54:07,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing none, I will, oh, one more, sorry.

523
00:54:07,165 --> 00:54:07,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Councillor Seng.

524
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:09,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

525
00:54:09,866 --> 00:54:13,387
[SPEAKER_07]: My fellow councillors stole all my questions about the BWCs.

526
00:54:13,407 --> 00:54:13,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I,

527
00:54:17,761 --> 00:54:31,848
[SPEAKER_07]: ask while we have you guys here, I know residents have been reaching out to us about the police department's policy with Immigration Customs Enforcement vis-a-vis the non-cooperation policy that we have in place.

528
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:47,176
[SPEAKER_07]: I was wondering if you could speak to reports of the FBI trucks that were in the police department's parking lot, as well as FBI agents walking through the offices and public spaces of the police building itself.

529
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,267
[SPEAKER_09]: That specifics I've not heard.

530
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:55,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's what I know of the incident, and it seems that others know a lot more than I do.

531
00:54:56,169 --> 00:55:02,850
[SPEAKER_09]: We were notified yesterday morning from Immigration ERO that they would be in the city of Medford.

532
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:07,512
[SPEAKER_09]: That call came in around four o'clock in the morning, right?

533
00:55:07,592 --> 00:55:11,973
[SPEAKER_09]: So these federal agencies and the city of Medford, we do that to de-conflict.

534
00:55:12,133 --> 00:55:13,473
[SPEAKER_09]: We do that with other agencies, right?

535
00:55:13,613 --> 00:55:17,174
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't wanna have problems knowing that there are other agencies out there.

536
00:55:17,935 --> 00:55:21,656
[SPEAKER_09]: outside of that, we have no knowledge of when they're coming, where they're going, or what they're going to do.

537
00:55:22,656 --> 00:55:29,638
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't until I received a text message from Council Abiz that they were on Salem Street by the target area.

538
00:55:30,398 --> 00:55:45,441
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I have no knowledge of that or what they were doing there, but at some point in time, whether a crowd gathered or some other instance, they felt that they were creating a stir and it was unsafe for them, so they responded to the public area of the police department

539
00:55:47,258 --> 00:55:49,841
[SPEAKER_09]: to kind of finish up whatever they were doing, talking to each other.

540
00:55:50,161 --> 00:55:54,285
[SPEAKER_09]: There was no operations with the police department or within the police department, and then they left.

541
00:55:54,905 --> 00:55:56,747
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know the full extent of how long they were there.

542
00:55:56,887 --> 00:55:58,629
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm venturing to guess it was less than 10 minutes.

543
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:11,281
[SPEAKER_09]: The theory sort of being that, you know, if you got immigration units out there in the city, and they're just standing on corners, they create a lot of havoc and people get

544
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:19,784
[SPEAKER_09]: scared and nervous, whereas if they have to gather and they pull in near a police station, it sort of looks like they belong there, right, and it causes less concern.

545
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:27,708
[SPEAKER_09]: It is what it is, but as far as our policy goes, we are not, you know, we have nothing to do with their operations.

546
00:56:29,169 --> 00:56:35,853
[SPEAKER_09]: What they were doing there, I have no knowledge, but to the extent of that, I'm fully aware, and I had my lieutenant captain look at it.

547
00:56:36,433 --> 00:56:38,094
[SPEAKER_09]: They just pulled in there, talked, and left.

548
00:56:39,894 --> 00:56:50,737
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I understand it's like a it's a tight, tough tightrope to walk with regards to, you know, deep deep between different levels.

549
00:56:51,177 --> 00:57:05,861
[SPEAKER_07]: I think what the Council was what you know the Council was reminded of and what we've, we want to emphasize to is that in the welcoming city ordinance, there is language in there about not

550
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:15,588
[SPEAKER_07]: using, not giving police spaces over, public space, or city spaces over to, for use in, you know, operations like that.

551
00:57:15,628 --> 00:57:21,071
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think just, just that was flagged to us, for us to flag as well.

552
00:57:22,532 --> 00:57:33,517
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I mean, I think the question is, why were agents, why did it seem like agents were in the buildings, especially in private parts of the buildings that needed to, they needed to be scanned in?

553
00:57:33,537 --> 00:57:34,158
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that was a

554
00:57:34,578 --> 00:57:35,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's reporting that?

555
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:36,440
[SPEAKER_07]: I was there.

556
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:43,808
[SPEAKER_07]: So I saw an agent walk through the first floor, including through the kind of doors that you have to tap.

557
00:57:44,028 --> 00:57:45,971
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to have a badge to slip into.

558
00:57:46,651 --> 00:57:47,072
[SPEAKER_07]: When was this?

559
00:57:47,392 --> 00:57:50,075
[SPEAKER_07]: This was, I went early yesterday, 10-ish.

560
00:57:52,498 --> 00:57:53,619
[SPEAKER_07]: It was in the morning yesterday.

561
00:57:55,533 --> 00:57:58,014
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'll take a look, I have no idea.

562
00:57:58,414 --> 00:58:01,274
[SPEAKER_07]: It was someone in that FBI year, so it wasn't someone in ICE gear.

563
00:58:03,375 --> 00:58:11,737
[SPEAKER_07]: And I didn't know if those two things were completely linked with each other, so I flagged it to Councilor Behrs, who flagged it to you and the Mayor.

564
00:58:12,477 --> 00:58:25,000
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the other kind of question that Councilors had at the time was if we have a kind of system built into place where at least we might know about these things happening when you

565
00:58:25,922 --> 00:58:27,904
[SPEAKER_07]: As the police department find them out as well.

566
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:39,257
[SPEAKER_07]: I was wondering if it would be possible for you to notify the mayor's office city councilors department heads when you know you get a notification that they might be in the city.

567
00:58:40,378 --> 00:58:40,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

568
00:58:43,062 --> 00:58:59,526
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not gonna happen, and I don't mean it in a cruel way, but ICE or any other federal agency works with the police department on a law enforcement level, and we do things interoperability-wise to sort of survive and understand what's going on.

569
00:59:02,947 --> 00:59:10,608
[SPEAKER_09]: In following up, the question is, immigration calls the city of Medford tomorrow and says, hey, we're in the city of Medford, and I call you.

570
00:59:11,569 --> 00:59:12,669
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you gonna do with that information?

571
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:18,902
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think sending out know your rights information I think would be helpful.

572
00:59:18,923 --> 00:59:29,429
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to go on social media and tell everybody ISIS in the city, the police are telling us it's not and then I'm going to get charged with, you know, interference obstruction and then they're never going to call us again.

573
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,130
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I put my offices in danger.

574
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:34,231
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think, yeah, I mean, this is the conversation.

575
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,872
[SPEAKER_07]: This is why we're asking the question.

576
00:59:35,892 --> 00:59:37,193
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can have this conversation.

577
00:59:37,253 --> 00:59:40,654
[SPEAKER_07]: So members of the public can know what's going through all of our heads.

578
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:41,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

579
00:59:42,035 --> 00:59:47,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, I think that's they understand what cities they're working in, and where there are non cooperation clauses.

580
00:59:47,298 --> 00:59:51,740
[SPEAKER_09]: So they know where they are, and they behave in a certain manner, right?

581
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,801
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's, they're not going to tell us anything, they're not going to operate with us.

582
00:59:54,901 --> 00:59:54,981
[SPEAKER_09]: And

583
00:59:58,392 --> 00:59:58,972
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the only way.

584
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,453
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no idea what they were doing.

585
01:00:00,633 --> 01:00:05,276
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no idea if they took somebody into custody or what they did.

586
01:00:06,236 --> 01:00:07,357
[SPEAKER_09]: No knowledge at all.

587
01:00:07,477 --> 01:00:09,378
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's probably no way they're going to tell me.

588
01:00:10,198 --> 01:00:13,160
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's consistent with what's going around in Massachusetts.

589
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:21,925
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do want to clarify that the non-cooperation policy law ordinance is just for

590
01:00:22,795 --> 01:00:24,576
[SPEAKER_07]: civil cases and not criminal as well.

591
01:00:24,916 --> 01:00:26,336
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's for the public to know that.

592
01:00:26,376 --> 01:00:27,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

593
01:00:27,577 --> 01:00:35,399
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will just openly say, I mean, the question is like, behind the police station is not just, I'm not gonna say public property, but that's a public street.

594
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:37,720
[SPEAKER_09]: That's Union Street, it's a public road.

595
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:44,082
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know where we're going to get in this world if I walk out there and say, hey, listen, you're not allowed on public property.

596
01:00:45,027 --> 01:00:52,350
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand what the ordinance says about use of facilities and like assistance with booking and all that sort of stuff.

597
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:54,131
[SPEAKER_09]: There's this one standard of what that is.

598
01:00:55,892 --> 01:01:00,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe, what if they pulled over to use the bathroom in the public lobby?

599
01:01:02,757 --> 01:01:04,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I restricted from telling them no?

600
01:01:04,078 --> 01:01:06,199
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a fine line for me to draw.

601
01:01:06,219 --> 01:01:08,881
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think that's what the ordinance would say, but yeah.

602
01:01:09,561 --> 01:01:13,623
[SPEAKER_03]: No, actually, I have the language from the Welcoming City Ordinance.

603
01:01:13,643 --> 01:01:25,250
[SPEAKER_03]: It says no city funds, resources, facilities, property, equipment, or personnel may be used to assist or participate in the enforcement of federal immigration laws, except as required by law.

604
01:01:26,012 --> 01:01:27,974
[SPEAKER_03]: or a court of competent jurisdiction.

605
01:01:27,994 --> 01:01:36,280
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we're talking about is just the civil removal of people in violation of immigration laws.

606
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:40,723
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, if it is an FBI operation, that's a separate thing.

607
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:46,868
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's a criminal investigation, if somebody is, if there is a warrant for their arrest,

608
01:01:47,964 --> 01:01:50,445
[SPEAKER_03]: that's legitimate, that's not what we're talking about.

609
01:01:50,505 --> 01:02:00,087
[SPEAKER_03]: So we get a lot of inquiries about the stuff and we're following up on sometimes on questions that we get asked by our constituents.

610
01:02:00,107 --> 01:02:06,029
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate your- Yeah, at the risk of saying you may know more than me at this point in time.

611
01:02:06,049 --> 01:02:08,550
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, these are very tough questions.

612
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:09,830
[SPEAKER_07]: We get tough questions ourselves.

613
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:12,091
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think in these situations,

614
01:02:13,412 --> 01:02:17,557
[SPEAKER_07]: best for us to get a bit of transparency, just for us to know where you guys are coming from.

615
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:22,444
[SPEAKER_07]: For us to flag things that residents are using as well.

616
01:02:22,464 --> 01:02:27,831
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I may, you said you saw this right so that yeah I was there, were they all wearing FBI gear.

617
01:02:28,815 --> 01:02:31,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I believe so.

618
01:02:31,217 --> 01:02:39,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I believe, at least the people, I mean, I think everyone was either in MPD year, and I think the MPD folks were just doing their regular jobs.

619
01:02:40,202 --> 01:02:43,944
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't see them, you know, interact with or talk to the FBI agents.

620
01:02:43,964 --> 01:02:51,269
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I saw a bunch of FBI agents in the lot, because we were trying to park there to get the, I was there to get a police report.

621
01:02:51,749 --> 01:02:56,552
[SPEAKER_07]: And then while I was in the hall in the lobby, getting the police report, I saw someone walk through.

622
01:02:57,941 --> 01:03:01,143
[SPEAKER_07]: and exit from the front, but they looked like they were walking from the back.

623
01:03:01,423 --> 01:03:07,746
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just don't know the layout of the first floor well enough, but it seemed like they were walking through a place I hadn't been to before.

624
01:03:08,206 --> 01:03:17,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, it's interesting because the immigration and the removal teams are borrowing weekly from all other federal agencies, right?

625
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:24,493
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not unheard of to see FBI or DEA or US Marshals on an immigration team when it comes down to that.

626
01:03:24,513 --> 01:03:26,474
[SPEAKER_09]: But we also do a lot of other work with the FBI.

627
01:03:26,915 --> 01:03:38,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, and that's why, you know, just wanted to flag this and say, I, the reason why I didn't make a big fuss about this was because I didn't know if this was like,

628
01:03:39,237 --> 01:03:41,438
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, another routine kind of cooperation.

629
01:03:41,498 --> 01:03:42,358
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to flag.

630
01:03:42,958 --> 01:03:54,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they have not put us in that position and nor have we been in that position where they've either demanded assistance or they're going about operating independently when it comes to it.

631
01:03:54,342 --> 01:03:57,444
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not even been an issue for us in that sense.

632
01:03:57,924 --> 01:04:00,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Collins.

633
01:04:03,433 --> 01:04:03,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

634
01:04:05,896 --> 01:04:21,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to follow up on that, and I think this is probably implied in what you just said, but since the report that we're looking at today covers 2024 and not January through May of this year, have any federal agencies requested surveillance data that was captured in 2025 that wouldn't have been captured in this report?

635
01:04:22,272 --> 01:04:23,513
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think so, but yeah.

636
01:04:23,813 --> 01:04:26,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Not through my office, definitely, and not through the 41 camera here.

637
01:04:26,875 --> 01:04:28,036
[SPEAKER_09]: And they would have to go through them.

638
01:04:28,236 --> 01:04:30,457
[SPEAKER_09]: So no agents, no federal agencies at all.

639
01:04:30,557 --> 01:04:33,419
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we only know the public records request.

640
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:33,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

641
01:04:34,059 --> 01:04:36,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Lieutenant Casey, anything on public records from a federal agency?

642
01:04:43,565 --> 01:04:48,288
[SPEAKER_09]: And to some degree, if they did file a public records request and it was legitimate, we would probably service that.

643
01:04:48,548 --> 01:04:51,190
[SPEAKER_09]: But as if through a public records request, yeah.

644
01:04:52,195 --> 01:04:55,958
[SPEAKER_10]: I can say that nothing's been given up.

645
01:04:56,318 --> 01:05:01,342
[SPEAKER_08]: The only agency that has requested any public records would be DCF as of this year.

646
01:05:02,243 --> 01:05:08,787
[SPEAKER_08]: And we work in partnership with the Department of Children's and Families on cases of child abuse and neglect.

647
01:05:09,268 --> 01:05:11,910
[SPEAKER_08]: But no federal agencies have requested anything from us.

648
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:13,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

649
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:15,061
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good to have confirmed.

650
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:25,146
[SPEAKER_04]: And not to belabor the point I know we have folks in the audience who also wanted to speak to the matter at hand but since Councilor Stang brought it up.

651
01:05:26,046 --> 01:05:27,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate the candor about this chief.

652
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:31,880
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's troubling.

653
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,101
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that we're all troubled.

654
01:05:33,261 --> 01:05:34,061
[SPEAKER_04]: We all share in that.

655
01:05:34,522 --> 01:05:43,669
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think that we need to honestly have more of a discussion about what a more collaborative notification system could look like in the city.

656
01:05:43,709 --> 01:05:47,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that there's a lot I don't know about the pressure that you're under.

657
01:05:48,172 --> 01:05:55,718
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I do think that there's more to this story about which city officials should know if one gets a notification that ICE is coming to town.

658
01:05:55,738 --> 01:05:57,360
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that the only way this could look is

659
01:05:58,361 --> 01:05:59,783
[SPEAKER_04]: social media and then a mass panic.

660
01:05:59,823 --> 01:06:09,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that there is a vested local public safety interest in having some heads up about, you know, obviously sometimes other jurisdictions come in and the goal is

661
01:06:11,349 --> 01:06:17,252
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a warrant for a dangerous person and it's in the interest of public safety, that is dealt with.

662
01:06:17,912 --> 01:06:21,413
[SPEAKER_04]: We've also seen raids in neighboring communities.

663
01:06:21,453 --> 01:06:26,956
[SPEAKER_04]: We've seen ICE show up at schools and things that I think are counter to all of our values and goals.

664
01:06:28,697 --> 01:06:34,059
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just, for me, I think that, I don't think this is the meeting to figure it out, but I do just want to put it on the record.

665
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:40,302
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we have to have more of a conversation about this notification system and what that could look like, because I certainly don't think that

666
01:06:41,102 --> 01:06:48,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's something that any of us want, is you say, heads up, I got a heads up, and that's all that I got.

667
01:06:49,146 --> 01:07:00,290
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I don't think it's, personally, I don't think any colleague of mine would say, let me create a conflagration that's only going to upset people and not be helpful.

668
01:07:00,490 --> 01:07:06,233
[SPEAKER_04]: And to me, it doesn't follow that would, the action of another leader would,

669
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:12,002
[SPEAKER_04]: justify accusing you with impinging on an investigation.

670
01:07:12,022 --> 01:07:14,164
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that there's a valid reason to talk more about this and

671
01:07:18,335 --> 01:07:28,524
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, we can have the conversations, and at this point in time, I don't change my opinion on where it goes, and it's not a political, it's just a law enforcement type safety opinion.

672
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:34,729
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't jeopardize my offices when it comes to other law enforcement agencies operating in the city of Medford.

673
01:07:35,770 --> 01:07:39,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Having said that, the obvious outcome would be is they're not gonna call us.

674
01:07:42,056 --> 01:07:45,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, I guess to me, it's like, what's the difference?

675
01:07:47,678 --> 01:07:48,619
[SPEAKER_09]: my office of safety.

676
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:53,041
[SPEAKER_04]: The officer's safety is impacted.

677
01:07:53,781 --> 01:07:53,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

678
01:07:54,041 --> 01:07:56,082
[SPEAKER_04]: If they know if ISIS is here or if they don't.

679
01:07:56,142 --> 01:07:58,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Not all police operations are safe, right?

680
01:07:58,624 --> 01:08:01,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes they go sideways and haywire.

681
01:08:02,906 --> 01:08:09,049
[SPEAKER_09]: When we're aware that there's another agency operating within the city of Bedford, we at least have that knowledge in our head.

682
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:14,292
[SPEAKER_09]: And there are people in emergencies that we can reach out to and contact.

683
01:08:15,992 --> 01:08:17,673
[SPEAKER_09]: a time when we managed to get that information.

684
01:08:17,833 --> 01:08:22,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Without that knowledge, we might be just responding to an individual with a gun in the street.

685
01:08:24,195 --> 01:08:30,337
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's very clearly and very, I mean, this is tried through the ages in law enforcement.

686
01:08:33,418 --> 01:08:43,062
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't put the officers in danger in that manner, but I mean, the inherent problems, as they notified me, we kind of know what's happening in the city for officers safety-wise.

687
01:08:45,209 --> 01:08:51,311
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you follow through what your actual request is and intent is for me to notify you so that a whole bunch of other stuff can happen, right?

688
01:08:51,891 --> 01:08:54,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes that can inherently cause undue fears.

689
01:08:55,293 --> 01:09:00,335
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will add this, sometimes it can inherently just draw attention to the city of Medford.

690
01:09:03,636 --> 01:09:11,919
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we all need to be aware that the actions that we take as individuals when it comes to immigration, the statements we make, somebody somewhere is paying attention.

691
01:09:15,113 --> 01:09:27,902
[SPEAKER_09]: and we don't want to create a situation where we're sort of poking the bear or bringing agencies to the city because of our own doings.

692
01:09:28,862 --> 01:09:36,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly, and I think we all are very focused on that and thinking very, very deeply about that.

693
01:09:36,775 --> 01:09:46,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think for me, given that when it sounds like when ice is notifying MPD that they're going to be in Medford that they're giving such vague information anyway.

694
01:09:47,387 --> 01:09:54,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Based on that that's my interpretation of what you said and you can correct me if I'm wrong they're not giving you details you don't know details you just know we're coming to the community.

695
01:09:56,772 --> 01:10:09,099
[SPEAKER_04]: It just seems to me that there might be a little bit of room for negotiation on what can other leaders know again with, I don't think anybody is trying to create panic or create a mob situation I think I mean for me personally as one counselor.

696
01:10:09,819 --> 01:10:15,722
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're all aware of how unhelpful and dangerous that kind of consequences that's not the goal.

697
01:10:17,996 --> 01:10:37,450
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll tell you, I don't, I know where my position is now and I'm not, I guess to some degree I am an expert to some of it, but like, I will also tell you that I don't know of another community that's doing that where the police department gets, you know, law enforcement sensitive information and sharing it with the public that makes the situation better.

698
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:45,176
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I would tend to try to want to look at that and see where it's going and not put ourselves out on an island for,

699
01:10:47,174 --> 01:10:51,758
[SPEAKER_09]: and also not to create more conflict between the police and the public.

700
01:10:52,079 --> 01:10:52,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

701
01:10:52,799 --> 01:10:54,221
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a really complicated situation.

702
01:10:54,261 --> 01:11:00,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we're all trying very hard to mitigate harm and reduce harm and

703
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:09,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, establish some control in a, you know, certainly a bear was poked, not by us, you know, these politics are bigger than us.

704
01:11:09,686 --> 01:11:10,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's my conviction.

705
01:11:10,827 --> 01:11:20,714
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we're all trying to deal with the fallout and I think that there are things to discuss in terms of what can we do within our jurisdiction, not to be flashy not to get on national news but just to make sure that people are safer.

706
01:11:21,715 --> 01:11:22,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Understood.

707
01:11:22,075 --> 01:11:22,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

708
01:11:22,775 --> 01:11:24,337
[SPEAKER_09]: If I do that we will be on national news.

709
01:11:27,567 --> 01:11:29,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

710
01:11:29,069 --> 01:11:31,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have any other comments from Councillors?

711
01:11:33,875 --> 01:11:34,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing none.

712
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:36,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

713
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:37,221
[SPEAKER_09]: I had one quick point.

714
01:11:37,641 --> 01:11:37,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Please.

715
01:11:38,021 --> 01:11:39,362
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot to mention this earlier today.

716
01:11:39,682 --> 01:11:47,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Last year, while we were doing this, we mentioned the question was, how do we do redaction of these body-worn cameras and the suggestion of a policy?

717
01:11:47,287 --> 01:11:48,668
[SPEAKER_09]: We did put a policy together.

718
01:11:48,728 --> 01:11:49,528
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in there.

719
01:11:49,548 --> 01:11:55,852
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't a whole lot to talk about, but I just wanted to mention it, at least before we leave, in case there was a question to it, that we do do a redaction.

720
01:11:55,872 --> 01:11:58,934
[SPEAKER_09]: We do it in accordance to a policy, which was one of the things that was brought up in the year prior.

721
01:11:58,974 --> 01:12:01,896
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's in there, and I forgot to mention it earlier.

722
01:12:02,268 --> 01:12:03,829
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed that, yeah, it looks good.

723
01:12:03,909 --> 01:12:07,571
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a specific, yeah, I was, I'm looking at it right now.

724
01:12:07,971 --> 01:12:16,775
[SPEAKER_03]: The requests and, or that's on this page, but there's a chart where people requested the redactions and yeah.

725
01:12:17,195 --> 01:12:18,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate it.

726
01:12:21,477 --> 01:12:25,579
[SPEAKER_03]: I will open it up to public participation in person or on Zoom.

727
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:28,281
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have a seat and you can come up to the podium.

728
01:12:28,321 --> 01:12:30,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Please say your name and address for the record.

729
01:12:32,085 --> 01:12:36,087
[SPEAKER_03]: and I will alternate if there are folks who would like to speak on Sam.

730
01:12:36,587 --> 01:12:37,528
[SPEAKER_01]: I will first go to the podium.

731
01:12:37,548 --> 01:12:39,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Marie Izzo, Pilgrim Road, Medford, Mass.

732
01:12:40,749 --> 01:12:50,234
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to thank the committee and the chief for making available for public comment, as required by the CCOPS ordinance, the annual surveillance report.

733
01:12:50,554 --> 01:12:58,578
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of CCOPS is to create a transparent community engaged process focused on the use of surveillance technology by the city.

734
01:12:58,839 --> 01:12:59,219
[SPEAKER_01]: To date,

735
01:12:59,939 --> 01:13:14,614
[SPEAKER_01]: We have body wooden cameras used from Medford Police Department and the automatic license plate readers used by the traffic department use policies and the reports help ensure that Medford residents understand what technology is being used in our community and how.

736
01:13:15,374 --> 01:13:23,378
[SPEAKER_01]: We're glad to see that the ordinance is working as intended and that the public is being informed of their use and provided the opportunity to comment.

737
01:13:24,179 --> 01:13:30,462
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope for the future that the timeline stated in the ordinance can be followed as we were prepared to review and comment in April.

738
01:13:30,982 --> 01:13:33,363
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the report was not submitted on time.

739
01:13:33,944 --> 01:13:38,706
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not know that the MPD report was submitted and would be heard until this weekend.

740
01:13:40,847 --> 01:13:46,170
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that we're all adjusting to this ordinance and that the reporting requirement.

741
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:52,713
[SPEAKER_01]: However, and Medford people power did not have time as a group to meet and discuss the report.

742
01:13:53,313 --> 01:13:55,754
[SPEAKER_01]: We request additional time to comment.

743
01:13:57,992 --> 01:14:03,054
[SPEAKER_01]: time to comment so that we can meet as a group and submit additional written comments if necessary.

744
01:14:03,434 --> 01:14:03,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

745
01:14:04,455 --> 01:14:09,077
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the fault of the committee, not the police department.

746
01:14:09,137 --> 01:14:10,698
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is the fault of the committee.

747
01:14:10,718 --> 01:14:11,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

748
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:13,659
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, yeah, we can.

749
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:17,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'd like to be able to just be more engaged.

750
01:14:17,761 --> 01:14:18,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

751
01:14:18,561 --> 01:14:18,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Understood.

752
01:14:19,301 --> 01:14:27,365
[SPEAKER_03]: The open meeting law requires 48 hours of notice, but I understand why your organization would want to meet and talk about it.

753
01:14:27,565 --> 01:14:27,665
[SPEAKER_03]: So

754
01:14:28,763 --> 01:14:29,523
[SPEAKER_03]: apologize for that.

755
01:14:30,524 --> 01:14:30,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

756
01:14:34,506 --> 01:14:37,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Vice President Collins.

757
01:14:38,929 --> 01:14:39,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

758
01:14:39,289 --> 01:14:41,812
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just wanted to follow up on Marie's point about timing.

759
01:14:42,392 --> 01:14:56,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Per the ordinance passed in 2023, this report was due March 15, and the council's annual public reporting was due April 15, which we didn't complete because this piece was not submitted until after that deadline.

760
01:14:57,265 --> 01:15:00,468
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was just going to say to give constituents more time to

761
01:15:01,789 --> 01:15:11,095
[SPEAKER_04]: review the reports and the Medford Parking Department's report, if they so choose, and have those comments be reflected in our annual public reporting.

762
01:15:11,375 --> 01:15:21,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we are already past due, I would propose I was going to make a motion to myself craft the annual public report like I did last year, because I'm very familiar with it.

763
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:43,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I would, just to inform my councillors, I think it'd be fine to have that be due for the City Council meeting on the 27th instead of the most immediate one, which is on May 13th, just to give constituents a little extra time to review the reporting and put any comments on the record before it is filed.

764
01:15:45,348 --> 01:15:51,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and I didn't mean to imply that we were late in posting it.

765
01:15:51,433 --> 01:15:54,915
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just we didn't happen to notify you guys ahead of time.

766
01:15:55,035 --> 01:15:58,758
[SPEAKER_03]: But um, can you restate that motion?

767
01:15:58,838 --> 01:15:59,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a motion?

768
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:02,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry.

769
01:16:04,127 --> 01:16:16,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I could make it as a motion after a public comment, but I was just going to say I was going to offer to put together the council's annual public report and I could do that for the May 27th meeting instead of the May 13th meeting just to give residents a little extra time to digest.

770
01:16:16,894 --> 01:16:18,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's hold on to it until after the

771
01:16:19,973 --> 01:16:20,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

772
01:16:21,394 --> 01:16:24,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing no hands raised on Zoom, I will go to the podium again.

773
01:16:24,697 --> 01:16:26,638
[SPEAKER_03]: State your name and address for the record, please.

774
01:16:27,099 --> 01:16:36,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Elizabeth Burke, 12 Stephen Street, and I'm also a member of Medford People Power and want to thank the committee and the Medford Police Department for making this available for public comment.

775
01:16:37,727 --> 01:16:45,033
[SPEAKER_02]: The main focus of the ordinance is to ensure that surveillance technology is not being used indiscriminately against the public with no knowledge or input.

776
01:16:45,713 --> 01:16:50,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford People Power as a group has not taken a position on body worn cameras as a technology.

777
01:16:51,018 --> 01:16:59,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Our main concern is that they are not used as general surveillance tools outside of the investigation of crimes and that the privacy of residents is protected.

778
01:16:59,947 --> 01:17:06,554
[SPEAKER_02]: The report provided by the Medford Police Department focuses significantly on the use of body worn cameras for case investigations.

779
01:17:06,994 --> 01:17:15,601
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it could provide more detail on how the privacy of Medford residents is protected and how this technology isn't being used against any particular population in Medford.

780
01:17:16,815 --> 01:17:25,902
[SPEAKER_02]: It is unclear if there is a disparate impact on Medford's residents as race and ethnicity data is not provided for when body-worn camera data is used by officers.

781
01:17:26,442 --> 01:17:32,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we don't have a breakdown of the race, ethnicity, and the instances when the camera was not turned on versus when it was on.

782
01:17:33,628 --> 01:17:39,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that the audit and the focus on training is to have the officers turn on the camera every time it is required.

783
01:17:39,853 --> 01:17:44,817
[SPEAKER_02]: We would like to see those numbers improve over time with training and be assured that there is no bias in their use.

784
01:17:45,417 --> 01:17:53,566
[SPEAKER_02]: The Medford Police Department states that they do not believe there has been a disparate impact, but in future, having that statement backed up by data would be great.

785
01:17:54,067 --> 01:17:54,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

786
01:17:55,729 --> 01:17:56,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

787
01:17:58,092 --> 01:17:59,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I will go to the podium again.

788
01:17:59,273 --> 01:18:00,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Please state your name and address for the record.

789
01:18:02,938 --> 01:18:03,980
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

790
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:04,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon.

791
01:18:05,201 --> 01:18:07,403
[SPEAKER_00]: Jean Zotter, 36 Saunders Street.

792
01:18:08,044 --> 01:18:13,309
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank City Council for holding this hearing and the Medford Police Department for submitting the report.

793
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:16,092
[SPEAKER_00]: Our comments are kind of as a group.

794
01:18:17,113 --> 01:18:19,515
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go on to the redaction policy.

795
01:18:20,736 --> 01:18:24,400
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate that the police department has a redaction policy.

796
01:18:25,322 --> 01:18:31,766
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a process and that residents have an opportunity to assert their right to privacy under this policy.

797
01:18:32,487 --> 01:18:43,514
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we would like to know why residents must pay to have their video redacted if they're not integral to the criminal investigation.

798
01:18:45,215 --> 01:18:50,756
[SPEAKER_00]: and they want to assert their privacy rights and have their video taken out of the body-worn camera.

799
01:18:51,717 --> 01:18:56,438
[SPEAKER_00]: There is in the request log, it seems like there has to be a check paid.

800
01:18:56,458 --> 01:19:08,161
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if they want to remove their data from the body-worn camera video, they have to pay to have their information video removed.

801
01:19:08,641 --> 01:19:11,802
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to set up a two-tiered system where people who can afford to pay

802
01:19:12,372 --> 01:19:18,355
[SPEAKER_00]: to have their private data protected, can pay for it, and people who can't don't have that right.

803
01:19:18,435 --> 01:19:24,318
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question I have for the police department is, am I understanding the policy correctly?

804
01:19:24,378 --> 01:19:27,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that why people are redacting their video data?

805
01:19:27,599 --> 01:19:32,962
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, we believe that should be available to any resident regardless of their ability to pay.

806
01:19:35,463 --> 01:19:39,945
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, there's some additional data we hope we could see in future reports.

807
01:19:41,105 --> 01:19:46,228
[SPEAKER_00]: We noticed that there were several use of force incidents where the body worn cameras were used.

808
01:19:47,732 --> 01:19:54,137
[SPEAKER_00]: and activated, and I think also audited, if I'm understanding the report correctly.

809
01:19:55,158 --> 01:20:00,322
[SPEAKER_00]: We would like to know if there was a determination from the audit if that use of force was justified.

810
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:03,645
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see any specifics of that.

811
01:20:03,685 --> 01:20:04,105
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want

812
01:20:05,266 --> 01:20:14,391
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lot of detail, which is a high-level summary, body-worn cameras are considered to be a protection for the public, especially when police use force.

813
01:20:15,432 --> 01:20:19,494
[SPEAKER_00]: We just would like to know that that's being reviewed and that has been considered to be justified.

814
01:20:21,456 --> 01:20:39,188
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the body-worn camera policy of the police department allows officers to request a redaction of the video when it has reported sensitive information, which seems different than the public requesting that the video be redacted.

815
01:20:40,391 --> 01:20:45,436
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see any data about how often police officers have requested videos to be redacted.

816
01:20:46,017 --> 01:20:54,647
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be nice for the public to know if that is happening, if police are redacting or requesting a redaction of videos themselves.

817
01:20:57,149 --> 01:21:05,774
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the body worn camera policy has Discusses and some of these things I don't completely understand.

818
01:21:05,854 --> 01:21:07,815
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe the police can clarify at some point.

819
01:21:08,836 --> 01:21:10,817
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something called record after the fact.

820
01:21:11,695 --> 01:21:17,257
[SPEAKER_00]: where it seems like if you're interacting with someone, you forget to record.

821
01:21:17,317 --> 01:21:22,998
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell the camera to record after the fact, but it's supposed to be reported if they do that.

822
01:21:23,498 --> 01:21:25,159
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see whether that happened at all.

823
01:21:25,819 --> 01:21:28,400
[SPEAKER_00]: There are prohibited recordings.

824
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:33,603
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't noted whether any of those prohibited recordings were violated.

825
01:21:34,503 --> 01:21:39,446
[SPEAKER_00]: And also their improper use of body worn cameras which I think they addressed did not happen.

826
01:21:39,786 --> 01:21:43,468
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the kinds of privacy protections of the public.

827
01:21:44,009 --> 01:21:48,191
[SPEAKER_00]: We would like to have noted and future reports so we can just be assured it's not happening.

828
01:21:48,211 --> 01:21:49,412
[SPEAKER_00]: And then.

829
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:55,329
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I think we're learning to understand how the policy works.

830
01:21:56,610 --> 01:22:03,014
[SPEAKER_00]: We disagreed with the police chief about allowing officers to review their own footage.

831
01:22:03,674 --> 01:22:07,577
[SPEAKER_00]: This came up at the last hearing around the annual report.

832
01:22:09,318 --> 01:22:20,325
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that that gives an unfair advantage to the police if the defendant also doesn't have the opportunity to review the recording before the statement is made.

833
01:22:21,306 --> 01:22:32,638
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if that happens every single time, so it would be nice to have more information about when are police reviewing the video recordings and how does that process work.

834
01:22:34,458 --> 01:22:44,225
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that process is allowed, and I didn't notice any reports of police misconduct, but can that happen in the cases of police misconduct?

835
01:22:44,866 --> 01:22:45,766
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that made sense.

836
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:48,208
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are some of the things we'd like to see in the future.

837
01:22:48,669 --> 01:22:54,113
[SPEAKER_00]: We think it would protect the public and their privacy rights and rights to not be surveilled.

838
01:22:54,613 --> 01:22:55,614
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much.

839
01:22:56,615 --> 01:22:56,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

840
01:23:02,411 --> 01:23:04,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing no further public comment.

841
01:23:05,913 --> 01:23:06,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have any?

842
01:23:06,513 --> 01:23:08,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes, Vice President Collins.

843
01:23:10,236 --> 01:23:11,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Chair.

844
01:23:11,636 --> 01:23:13,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate the additional

845
01:23:14,618 --> 01:23:17,099
[SPEAKER_04]: comment and attention to detail from constituents.

846
01:23:17,499 --> 01:23:34,563
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just wondering, I know there were a lot of specific questions just raised, if there's anything that she or your team could speak to in this meeting, specifically the cost for redaction from the public, is that something that you can provide a little clarity on or some of the other questions that Jean raised?

847
01:23:44,653 --> 01:23:48,816
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's just me trying to get a technical answer from that.

848
01:23:49,377 --> 01:23:59,205
[SPEAKER_09]: So if someone asks them for their video to be redacted, we don't have a process for charging them for that.

849
01:23:59,445 --> 01:24:00,166
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not an issue.

850
01:24:00,186 --> 01:24:09,414
[SPEAKER_09]: But if somebody is doing a public records request and wants that video or videos associated with their calls, then there are public records laws that allow us to charge them for that.

851
01:24:09,974 --> 01:24:11,255
[SPEAKER_09]: But specifically, I'm not sure.

852
01:24:14,316 --> 01:24:17,000
[SPEAKER_09]: You're more the public records access officer.

853
01:24:18,202 --> 01:24:26,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, under mass general laws, based on our population density in Medford required it allows us to charge.

854
01:24:27,337 --> 01:24:32,079
[SPEAKER_08]: $25 per hour for redaction beyond the first two hours.

855
01:24:32,299 --> 01:24:41,442
[SPEAKER_08]: So anything in excess of two hours, we petition the Secretary of Supervisor of Public Records at the Secretary of State's office for authorization to redact.

856
01:24:42,102 --> 01:24:50,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Every time we're gonna charge for redaction, we file a petition that gets reviewed with the Supervisor of Records and they give us an answer whether we're authorized or not.

857
01:24:50,965 --> 01:24:54,426
[SPEAKER_08]: And in all of our instances of

858
01:24:55,548 --> 01:25:12,728
[SPEAKER_08]: petitions, as long as we make file the petition within 10 days, we've been granted based on the redaction and the redactions of a privacy interest of the public that may be or may be captured under the video that we don't want to just release out to whoever the requester may be.

859
01:25:13,328 --> 01:25:13,769
[SPEAKER_08]: If the requesters

860
01:25:15,244 --> 01:25:29,960
[SPEAKER_08]: video they're looking for, if there's third party interactions in that, victims, other witnesses or things like that, any sensitive information that someone may get recorded, we want to redact that for individual privacy.

861
01:25:31,407 --> 01:25:39,890
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is in when somebody does a public records request, there will be redaction required, and that has a cost to it.

862
01:25:40,330 --> 01:25:49,073
[SPEAKER_03]: But if somebody within your policy around redaction for themselves requests a redaction there's no cost associated.

863
01:25:51,083 --> 01:26:13,297
[SPEAKER_08]: made a recording that he felt that it was something in there that would be a privacy issue for within that recording, whether it's personal to that officer or to the public, he can request that the body worn camera unit do some redaction on that specific image or audio, whatever that case is, or the member of the public can request it to member of the public.

864
01:26:14,672 --> 01:26:18,113
[SPEAKER_08]: that we're not releasing any videos unless there's a public records request.

865
01:26:18,633 --> 01:26:33,578
[SPEAKER_08]: The only other release goes to the district attorney's office when they request it for a case, or if another state agency, like we work with DCF, as I mentioned earlier, if they request a video, it'll be reviewed.

866
01:26:33,638 --> 01:26:40,420
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's anything that per the records request, per the records statute, it's an exemption.

867
01:26:41,502 --> 01:26:45,645
[SPEAKER_08]: is a number of the exemptions under the law, and we'll apply those exemptions.

868
01:26:47,026 --> 01:26:47,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I see.

869
01:26:48,927 --> 01:26:51,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

870
01:26:52,030 --> 01:26:54,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I do see one more public comment on Zoom.

871
01:26:55,652 --> 01:26:57,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you still?

872
01:26:57,894 --> 01:26:59,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

873
01:27:01,096 --> 01:27:01,657
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I'm on.

874
01:27:10,962 --> 01:27:12,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Please state your name and address for the record.

875
01:27:13,663 --> 01:27:15,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Barry Ingber, 9 Draper Street.

876
01:27:17,824 --> 01:27:19,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the opportunity to speak.

877
01:27:20,224 --> 01:27:32,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also a member of Medford People Power, but I am actually right now not speaking on behalf of Medford People Power because I haven't had a chance to discuss my comments with other people.

878
01:27:32,327 --> 01:27:37,108
[SPEAKER_06]: So folks may or may not disagree with what I have to say.

879
01:27:39,913 --> 01:27:50,475
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to respond to Chief Buckley's response to the question of whether body-worn cameras have been effective at achieving their identified purchase.

880
01:27:51,635 --> 01:28:07,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Chief Buckley states that he believes they have been effective in all of their intended purposes, he said all, and very clearly describes those as documenting crime and accidents, or more generally, as a law enforcement tool.

881
01:28:07,650 --> 01:28:08,430
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's fair enough.

882
01:28:09,091 --> 01:28:14,354
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a strong opinion about the use of body-worn cameras as a law enforcement tool.

883
01:28:15,394 --> 01:28:19,176
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm able to see problems with them as well as substantial benefits from them.

884
01:28:20,057 --> 01:28:24,399
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not have any major problems with the way that they are actually being used in Medford.

885
01:28:25,139 --> 01:28:31,843
[SPEAKER_06]: And I appreciate the Medford Police Department's efforts to improve compliance with the use policy.

886
01:28:34,005 --> 01:28:45,774
[SPEAKER_06]: But while I'm not criticizing the use of body-worn cameras as a law enforcement tool, I do have a serious problem with the sleight of hand that has been pulled by Chief Buckley.

887
01:28:46,635 --> 01:29:01,726
[SPEAKER_06]: When he was going through the process of acquiring these tools, he consistently, in person and in writing, touted their purpose as being improved police accountability, less police misconduct, and more trust

888
01:29:02,273 --> 01:29:04,635
[SPEAKER_06]: in MPD community relations.

889
01:29:05,835 --> 01:29:13,000
[SPEAKER_06]: It has been clear from the outset and confirmed by the two reports he has submitted to date that these were never their real purpose.

890
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:20,084
[SPEAKER_06]: This misrepresentation was disrespectful to both the community at large and to our elected officials.

891
01:29:21,104 --> 01:29:30,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Important conversation about whether body-worn cameras were or were not a good idea as a law enforcement tool never was allowed to happen.

892
01:29:32,884 --> 01:29:47,397
[SPEAKER_06]: That said, I am curious to know, however, if there have been, incidental to their true law enforcement purpose, any improvements regarding instances of police misconduct or in relations with the community.

893
01:29:48,397 --> 01:29:48,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

894
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:51,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

895
01:29:55,083 --> 01:29:56,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any further public comment?

896
01:29:58,403 --> 01:30:02,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing none, do we have any other councilor comments?

897
01:30:03,290 --> 01:30:04,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Collins?

898
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:07,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Chair.

899
01:30:17,168 --> 01:30:36,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I think digesting some of the public comment, I think one of the themes brought up by the public on this topic is, you know, the value of reporting in getting the data to back up what we know about the good faith intent of these equipment, this equipment and people using them.

900
01:30:37,401 --> 01:30:46,067
[SPEAKER_04]: And I heard Jean say earlier, it would be helpful to know how many instances of record after the fact, prohibited recordings, improper use of body-worn camera videos.

901
01:30:48,309 --> 01:31:06,381
[SPEAKER_04]: If the audits or just the day-in, day-out supervision that goes on in the office, if those are observed, I think it'd be helpful for us to have a record of for the next annual surveillance report, even if the number for each of those

902
01:31:07,422 --> 01:31:16,116
[SPEAKER_04]: record after the fact, prohibit recordings, improper use of body-worn camera videos, even if the number for every single one of those is zero, I still think it would be helpful to have that added as a line item on the report.

903
01:31:18,877 --> 01:31:28,446
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, obviously, we have the twin goals of these improving public safety in Medford and following through on the goal of them, improving accountability trust transparency.

904
01:31:29,127 --> 01:31:36,794
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that one of the best things we can do with this structure of the seacops ordinance in general and with the reporting is if there's really good stuff to report let's report it.

905
01:31:37,795 --> 01:31:44,861
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's no impropriety that's ever been absorbed in the office, you know, with this equipment and their usage, that's great.

906
01:31:45,182 --> 01:31:47,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, let's report it, let's include it on the report.

907
01:31:47,564 --> 01:31:51,968
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to flag that for next year's reporting.

908
01:31:52,068 --> 01:31:54,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be useful to track and to add.

909
01:31:55,271 --> 01:31:55,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

910
01:31:57,493 --> 01:32:01,137
[SPEAKER_04]: With that, since my microphone is already on, I would formally make my motion to

911
01:32:02,577 --> 01:32:28,845
[SPEAKER_04]: have myself as sponsor create the annual City Council's annual public report on all of the surveillance documentation that we've received this year about 2024, and that includes Medford Parking Department as well as Medford Police Department for inclusion on the May 27th City Council agenda.

912
01:32:29,105 --> 01:32:30,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And just for folks who are newer to this process,

913
01:32:31,646 --> 01:32:44,312
[SPEAKER_04]: that is just the City Council's compilation of all of the use policies, impact reports, and annual surveillance reports that we have received from city departments and agencies that do have an authorized use of surveillance technology.

914
01:32:47,654 --> 01:32:48,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have a second?

915
01:32:49,755 --> 01:32:51,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded by Councilor Snider.

916
01:32:51,316 --> 01:32:53,017
[SPEAKER_03]: All in favor?

917
01:32:53,757 --> 01:32:53,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait.

918
01:33:01,407 --> 01:33:05,529
[SPEAKER_04]: the motion is just for me to make the annual public report and put it on for May 27.

919
01:33:08,331 --> 01:33:09,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Is everybody clear on what the motion is?

920
01:33:11,012 --> 01:33:11,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lemming?

921
01:33:14,334 --> 01:33:14,774
[SPEAKER_03]: All in favor?

922
01:33:15,935 --> 01:33:16,355
[SPEAKER_03]: All opposed?

923
01:33:16,756 --> 01:33:17,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

924
01:33:18,957 --> 01:33:29,443
[SPEAKER_03]: As a point of information, question number two in the annual surveillance report says, whether the surveillance technology has been effective at achieving its identified purpose

925
01:33:30,969 --> 01:33:57,752
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the sentences in that says, body-worn cameras are effective law enforcement tools that reinforce the public's perception of police professionalism and preserve factual representations of officer-civilian interactions, which I would say covers most of the bases of both helping law enforcement achieve its goals and also helping the public

926
01:33:59,986 --> 01:34:02,548
[SPEAKER_03]: achieve its goals, be they the same or not.

927
01:34:03,849 --> 01:34:04,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're usually the same.

928
01:34:06,551 --> 01:34:09,613
