00:00:11,073 --> 00:00:11,573
And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,314 --> 00:00:14,955
Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

00:00:15,255 --> 00:00:17,996
And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:18,637 --> 00:00:20,358
And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,618 --> 00:00:28,502
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,404
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,905
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:37,758 --> 00:00:39,979
Thanks so much for being here with us today.

10
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,660
Shelly's back.

11
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:43,742
We've missed her for a while, but she's here today.

12
00:00:43,762 --> 00:00:45,383
I missed you guys too.

13
00:00:45,403 --> 00:00:46,703
Good to be back.

14
00:00:47,144 --> 00:00:47,404
All right.

15
00:00:48,044 --> 00:00:52,687
So the rest of you, if you don't mind introducing yourselves, just with your name, pronouns, and who you are.

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:03,970
Yeah, my name is Nicole Morrell she her, I am the chair of invest in Medford, which is the ballot question campaign in favor of questions, six, seven and eight.

17
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,236
I'm also a former city counselor and mom in Medford, and that covers it.

18
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,661
Hi, I'm Christina McCourty.

19
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:24,125
I am a volunteer with the Invest in Medford campaign, mostly focusing on the comms, so I might be coming to your door soon to Canvas.

20
00:01:25,426 --> 00:01:33,450
I am a currently substitute teaching in the Medford public schools and was a former teacher before that.

21
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:39,073
And I'm also a parent of two kids in the Medford public schools.

22
00:01:42,512 --> 00:01:44,593
Hi, I'm Jessica Parks.

23
00:01:44,613 --> 00:01:52,677
I am also a volunteer with the Invest in Medford campaign and a mom and longtime resident in Medford.

24
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:55,058
All right, thank you all.

25
00:01:55,098 --> 00:01:59,921
So I'll just prompt the question of the podcast that we ask everybody, sometimes the hardest one.

26
00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:04,003
If you could just share your favorite place to eat in Medford and what you like to eat there.

27
00:02:05,915 --> 00:02:06,676
Yeah, I'll go.

28
00:02:06,736 --> 00:02:12,220
I've been on before, and I gave the same question before, the same answer before, but I'm going to get into specifics.

29
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,681
So we'll go with Chili Garden.

30
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:19,686
I like the super spicy stuff, but I also like the bamboo shoots and sesame oil.

31
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:22,929
And they've been extra good lately because my son is a huge fan.

32
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:26,111
So that's just a win because he's a toddler.

33
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:28,914
So anything he likes and will eat, it makes it extra good.

34
00:02:30,295 --> 00:02:30,575
Thanks.

35
00:02:33,054 --> 00:02:39,759
It is very hard to pick, but I'll say one of my favorite things is the carnitas torta from Tenoch.

36
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,320
Nice.

37
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:47,804
And I'm going to go with peppermint stick ice cream from Colleen's.

38
00:02:49,205 --> 00:02:50,506
Yeah, we have a frequent one.

39
00:02:50,526 --> 00:02:51,606
Nice.

40
00:02:51,646 --> 00:02:52,487
Yeah, that's a good one.

41
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,023
haven't heard about Colleen's in a while so it's nice to hear about it again.

42
00:02:56,803 --> 00:03:03,569
So I'm hoping that you can describe for us kind of what the Invest in Medford campaign is.

43
00:03:05,911 --> 00:03:08,693
Sure I can kick it off and then I'll let other folks join in.

44
00:03:08,713 --> 00:03:14,258
So the Invest in Medford campaign at its most basic is a ballot question committee for people who are in favor

45
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:21,883
Of question 678 which pertain to a debt exclusion for the new fire headquarters and to overrides for the schools and our streets and sidewalk.

46
00:03:22,324 --> 00:03:26,410
The campaign is like most local campaigns is made up of your

47
00:03:26,871 --> 00:03:39,858
your friends, your cousins, your neighbors, people in Medford who are invested in investing in Medford and wanna see these campaign, these ballot questions come to fruition and have Medford be funded in the way that it deserves.

48
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:51,044
So the ballot measures cover a number of different needs for the city and ask Medford residents if they're in favor of investing in the city in the form of a fixed dollar amount of tax increase to make these things happen.

49
00:03:52,004 --> 00:03:55,466
And I'm happy to go in more detail or if anyone else wants to jump in.

50
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:05,988
And I think that's great Nicole, and maybe you could expand on what a vote of yes on 678 would mean for this.

51
00:04:07,107 --> 00:04:10,269
Yeah, so I'll break them down into each question.

52
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:12,030
So I'm just in sequential order.

53
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:23,859
So by voting yes on six, voters are approving a debt exclusion, which would increase taxes for residents and commercial to fund the design and construction of a new fire headquarters that would cover the cost of the project as they are outlined today.

54
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:31,944
Any kind of like small changes for timing of project or slight adjustment would be covered, but we're looking at roughly $30 million.

55
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:37,187
And what makes it a debt exclusion is this is a tax increase over a set period of time.

56
00:04:37,248 --> 00:04:42,811
So once the bill is paid for that project, that amount of tax increase is going to come off everyone's bills.

57
00:04:43,662 --> 00:04:48,125
Seven and eight are overrides, which are permanent, but like the debt exclusion, they're a set amount.

58
00:04:48,245 --> 00:04:49,865
So it's not a percentage increase.

59
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:53,808
It's a set dollar increase to your yearly tax bill.

60
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,829
They total $7.5 million together.

61
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:07,795
And question seven helps to stabilize our school district and avoid cuts to our school system, as well as fund a permanent street and sidewalk crew in-house instead of always contracting out.

62
00:05:08,215 --> 00:05:11,078
for the huge amount of work we need down in the city.

63
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:25,813
And question eight really helps the schools reach beyond just stabilizing and making sure everything can stay as it is and reach for things that would really benefit our students and our community through a number of different things that are outlined that I can talk about later or let someone else talk about.

64
00:05:31,068 --> 00:05:31,428
Thank you.

65
00:05:31,488 --> 00:05:31,688
Yeah.

66
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:38,350
So I think, you know, Christina and Jessica, you guys are also here as parents in different roles in the city.

67
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:39,990
So I want to hear from you in a second.

68
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:49,692
But one thing we did do in preparation for this episode was to reach out to residents to see kind of what their support or lack of support was for the override.

69
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:55,034
We didn't receive any messages that conveyed that people did not want this.

70
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,814
So they were all messages in support.

71
00:05:56,854 --> 00:05:59,435
But I want to read a couple and then and sort of see

72
00:06:01,175 --> 00:06:04,738
How these resonate with you all if you have anything that you would add or agree with here.

73
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:13,927
So, a resident named Michelle and said right now made for public schools have already had to cut valuable valuable positions and services due to budget issues last year.

74
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:20,513
If these tax overrides don't pass 35 to 45 more positions will be cut along with services such as behavioral support staff.

75
00:06:20,993 --> 00:06:24,996
paraprofessionals, advanced courses at the high school, and the arts throughout the district.

76
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:36,546
This means teachers will take on more work, have less time and energy to create engaging lessons, and certainly less time and energy to spend with students individually as class sizes throughout the district would rise.

77
00:06:37,086 --> 00:06:41,690
To have less than adequate funding makes teaching near impossible.

78
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:46,254
The added burdens of inadequate funding make what should be a joyful job a miserable one.

79
00:06:46,634 --> 00:06:49,036
These difficult working conditions will directly affect

80
00:06:50,106 --> 00:06:56,688
Our students in Medford, please don't ever forget that teacher working conditions are student learning conditions.

81
00:06:56,768 --> 00:07:00,589
If teachers are struggling and unhappy, students will be too.

82
00:07:00,609 --> 00:07:08,471
I want my children to go to a school in a district where teachers are happy and supported, and I hope that district can be Medford.

83
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:17,073
Another person said that they're in support of 6, 7, and 8 because Medford's needs can't be met as is.

84
00:07:17,573 --> 00:07:27,155
The value to our community of being able to do more instead of figuring out how to do less is worth way more to me than $37 in my pocket a month.

85
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:34,156
Honestly, I would have gladly supported a bigger ask because these three initiatives are only scratching the surface of what our community needs.

86
00:07:34,636 --> 00:07:35,196
Prop 2.5 has not made

87
00:07:37,737 --> 00:07:39,199
was not made to never be broken.

88
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:46,747
The majority of our cities and towns have passed multiple overrides, which is why our surrounding communities have more resources and amenities than we have.

89
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:55,196
I have two young kids and hope to stay in Medford for their childhoods, but the decision will certainly have to be revisited if there's no broad community support for our schools.

90
00:07:57,118 --> 00:07:58,679
I'll pause there and see, you know.

91
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:22,330
Yeah, I mean, I feel like one of the big things there that runs through is like that Medford Public Schools always tries to do as much as they can with the budget they're given, but that's really not okay for our kids and for our teachers.

92
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,552
We are supposed to meet

93
00:08:27,964 --> 00:08:28,945
each child's needs.

94
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:37,891
We're supposed to figure out each child as an individual, get to know them, figure out their needs, and that can't happen the way things are now.

95
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:45,757
So class size came up, and we are feeling the effects right now of the cuts that already happened last year.

96
00:08:45,777 --> 00:08:49,840
We have large class sizes, and you know,

97
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:58,203
is when you have like 24 second graders, which I am subbing right now in a class of 24 second graders.

98
00:08:59,044 --> 00:09:04,226
And you're trying to get to know them and figure them out as learners and give them what they need.

99
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:06,907
It is impossible.

100
00:09:08,787 --> 00:09:11,709
Education has come a long way from what it was decades ago.

101
00:09:11,849 --> 00:09:15,190
And I feel like the expectations are higher and they should be.

102
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:19,372
But it is not a sustainable job when your class sizes are

103
00:09:19,972 --> 00:09:21,013
are large.

104
00:09:22,935 --> 00:09:34,065
Another thing that didn't come up in what those comments, but that comes up for me is like how the underfunding in our schools has created inequity.

105
00:09:34,425 --> 00:09:38,449
And if there are further cuts, it just furthers the inequity.

106
00:09:39,069 --> 00:09:45,335
Because it's so hard to get, for example, a child on an IP and get kids the services they need.

107
00:09:45,715 --> 00:09:57,799
What happens is that it's the parents who are the most in the know, the parents who have the money for lawyers and the parents who have the money for advocates that can fight hard for their kids.

108
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:02,761
A lot of people know the easiest way to get things for your kids is when the parents initiate it.

109
00:10:05,662 --> 00:10:24,969
what I would like to see is a funded school where teachers can feel comfortable like bringing up kids and not being brushed off and where parents can bring up concerns and not be brushed off the way that often happens in Medford because we just don't have the funds to really give the kids what they need.

110
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,010
So the equity piece is really big for me.

111
00:10:28,491 --> 00:10:31,772
There's a lot of inequity in Medford and you see it in the schools.

112
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:45,606
And to me, when there were cuts, it concerned me because I felt like the larger classes with the needier populations is really hard.

113
00:10:45,626 --> 00:10:48,229
And if there are more cuts, I don't know how

114
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,091
just to be honest, I don't know how we could have more cuts.

115
00:10:52,872 --> 00:11:02,376
So I'd like us to fund the school so that we don't have to make the cuts, but then we also can actually provide what the kids need and the teachers.

116
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,196
That was another thing they spoke to.

117
00:11:04,696 --> 00:11:06,197
We want to keep our teachers.

118
00:11:06,377 --> 00:11:17,642
And honestly, financially, people can go, paraprofessionals too, everyone that works in the schools, they can go somewhere else nearby for more money.

119
00:11:18,622 --> 00:11:27,888
So we wanna make their job doable and keep the class sizes smaller and have the support staff we need.

120
00:11:27,928 --> 00:11:33,872
I heard guidance, we need so much social emotional learning support and guidance.

121
00:11:35,053 --> 00:11:41,637
So part of this too is helping to increase salaries hopefully for teachers in Paris.

122
00:11:43,338 --> 00:11:46,440
So yeah, a lot of that is big.

123
00:11:49,059 --> 00:12:11,644
Another thing that I heard in those comments, which is tied into the inequity piece, I think somewhat, but just the reality of what happens if they don't pass is, I think one of the people said that they could potentially leave Medford if they don't pass.

124
00:12:12,884 --> 00:12:14,925
And that's troublesome.

125
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:16,505
We've been here for,

126
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,028
13 years, we're not going anywhere.

127
00:12:21,048 --> 00:12:26,730
The cost of houses in this area are ridiculous.

128
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,211
So we're not moving anywhere.

129
00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:32,431
We're not in a position to move anywhere else.

130
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:43,535
And if it doesn't pass, then is it that people who can move elsewhere to other districts where they're investing in their children,

131
00:12:44,315 --> 00:12:46,316
then those children have the opportunities.

132
00:12:46,456 --> 00:12:51,939
Or people who can't afford to have their children go to private schools, their children get those opportunities.

133
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:59,482
And then the children left in the Medford schools are left with what the Medford schools end up becoming.

134
00:13:00,022 --> 00:13:09,267
And so that worries me personally for my own kid and all the other kids who will be left in the Medford school district if it doesn't pass.

135
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:19,394
And I did hear that from a few other people, like how this decision is going to affect their decision about if they stay in Medford or not.

136
00:13:20,314 --> 00:13:23,276
And that's, yeah.

137
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:28,960
Yeah, you can't blame people because if a community says we don't want to invest in this, we don't care about our public schools.

138
00:13:29,461 --> 00:13:30,982
That's, you know, that's really jarring.

139
00:13:32,585 --> 00:13:39,067
Chrissy, I just wanted to key in on an important point you made, sharing that you're already feeling the weight of larger class sizes.

140
00:13:39,347 --> 00:13:40,647
It is September 20th, right?

141
00:13:40,907 --> 00:13:57,731
And so I wondered if you might speak to maybe some of the, you know, you've got years of expertise in teaching some of the ramifications of what larger class sizes mean in so far as learning, not to mention the kind of individualized support that all our kids deserve, but maybe some of the kids, you know, navigating learning stuff.

142
00:13:58,452 --> 00:13:59,952
But yeah, what are the classrooms feeling like?

143
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:15,880
So it's just, I mean, as simple as it sounds, it's just like having all those like bodies in the room and then trying to manage them takes a lot of energy.

144
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:20,405
So, you know, you're here to teach and learn and, you know,

145
00:14:21,802 --> 00:14:34,909
talk about how to be kind and good people and all this stuff, but you get bogged down sometimes with trying to get 24 people ready.

146
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:42,373
We had to just do this assessment that we have to do on the Chromebooks, and it took 10 minutes to get everyone set up.

147
00:14:42,393 --> 00:14:43,373
There's just a lot of time wasted.

148
00:14:47,315 --> 00:14:49,036
it takes kids longer.

149
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:50,697
Everything takes longer.

150
00:14:53,298 --> 00:15:01,761
When you're teaching something, you want to be able to assess their background knowledge, see where they are, and meet them where they are.

151
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:02,922
You want to be able to

152
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:08,716
rotate around the room and feel like you've checked in with each student.

153
00:15:09,756 --> 00:15:11,297
See, okay, who's got it?

154
00:15:11,718 --> 00:15:15,421
Okay, I need to check in with like these kids, they really don't have it.

155
00:15:17,262 --> 00:15:19,304
You know, and when there's so many

156
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:20,485
children.

157
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:28,412
It is really hard to go around, especially because of all the things that come up, like children are children.

158
00:15:28,452 --> 00:15:34,037
There's kids who are just having a hard time paying attention or there's kids chatting.

159
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:36,359
There's all these behaviors that you have to manage.

160
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:36,459
And

161
00:15:39,737 --> 00:15:42,060
So, you know, that, that becomes hard.

162
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:54,112
And then also, like, if you have kids that you want to bring up that are concerning, you know, it's just hard because, you know, when I was a teacher, I always felt like I had, you know, I couldn't bring up

163
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:58,036
all the kids because there were so many.

164
00:15:58,437 --> 00:16:03,342
You have to make all these decisions about who's the most neediest and things like that.

165
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:09,208
It's just like the more kids you have, the harder all that is.

166
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:16,535
Last year I happened to be in a class, I know it's ideal, but there were 15 children and it just

167
00:16:17,456 --> 00:16:18,176
It was wonderful.

168
00:16:18,216 --> 00:16:21,497
Like, I did feel like I could check in with everyone.

169
00:16:22,157 --> 00:16:25,498
I did feel like we were a nice family, like a community.

170
00:16:26,358 --> 00:16:35,361
It's just hard when, yeah, like the more of them there are, the harder it is to give them the individual attention that they need.

171
00:16:37,428 --> 00:16:38,228
Thank you, yeah.

172
00:16:38,549 --> 00:16:50,916
And there was one other person who wrote into us that said that if there's no vote on these questions that Medford will continue to be in a worse state year after year and that it almost guarantees that we'll be passed over for the new high school.

173
00:16:50,936 --> 00:17:00,381
So I don't know if, yeah, I think that like the new high school was sort of the reason that I started thinking about this or hearing about overrides or like a budget increase.

174
00:17:00,461 --> 00:17:03,223
And so I wonder if there's any thoughts about that.

175
00:17:05,295 --> 00:17:08,856
Yeah, Nicole, I don't know if you know more about the the heist.

176
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:12,337
Um, so yeah, so part of this is, none of us can see the future.

177
00:17:12,357 --> 00:17:19,439
But I think what that person is getting to is that we have something on the ballot right now that's asking people whether or not they want to invest in our public schools.

178
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:25,860
And if they say no, that's going to signal to the MSBA that covers part of a new high school.

179
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,281
It doesn't cover the entirety of the community has to cover for part of it as well.

180
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:32,044
And that requires another debt exclusion down the line.

181
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:40,196
If we're already saying now we don't want to invest in our public schools, they're not going to likely want to go through the process with us to continue towards a new high school.

182
00:17:40,516 --> 00:17:45,423
If they think that the next time it comes up to invest in our public schools in the form of new high school, we're going to say no again.

183
00:17:45,823 --> 00:17:50,524
So it's kind of them reading the tea leaves of what we're telling them with this vote.

184
00:17:50,584 --> 00:17:52,565
So it's really important in that sense, too.

185
00:17:52,585 --> 00:17:58,126
And I know there's some confusion, understandably, that people think that what does this vote have to do with the new high school?

186
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:02,747
It's its own separate vote, but it definitely does have an impact in a different way.

187
00:18:05,588 --> 00:18:06,008
Absolutely.

188
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:12,129
I think when you spend money, you're showcasing your values, and this is an opportunity to showcase our municipal values.

189
00:18:12,969 --> 00:18:13,390
Absolutely.

190
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,330
Community values, rather.

191
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,210
Right.

192
00:18:17,732 --> 00:18:32,066
So I don't want to frame it that everyone was writing to us about the schools because there was another person who was talking about streets and sidewalk repair maintenance and saying that those things are projects that have been kicked down the road by many mayors and city councils in the past.

193
00:18:32,927 --> 00:18:37,031
He said that there's 95 miles of roadway in Medford and in 2023 one street that was 1300 feet long was replaced.

194
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:42,614
At that rate, we'll have dirt roads in 10 years.

195
00:18:43,434 --> 00:18:48,076
And we need more funding for infrastructure, lead pipes, burst pipes, sidewalks that you trip over.

196
00:18:48,096 --> 00:18:50,517
I think this is a good example.

197
00:18:50,537 --> 00:18:53,738
I think even when we talk about the school budget, we talk about teacher salaries.

198
00:18:53,818 --> 00:18:59,940
But I think you all did a great job of illustrating all the other things that we don't maybe think about every day if we aren't in the schools.

199
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:04,862
And I think this person does a good job of talking about, we hear complaints about the roads all the time.

200
00:19:04,982 --> 00:19:06,323
This is a way to start addressing

201
00:19:07,283 --> 00:19:10,286
fixing them, but also all of the other things that maybe we need to fix.

202
00:19:11,928 --> 00:19:19,555
And I think one of the arguments I was hearing along the way was like, we don't need to raise taxes because we're going to be getting more revenue from businesses in the city.

203
00:19:19,595 --> 00:19:23,699
And I think if our roads are a mess, no one's going to want to drive through here to get to different places.

204
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:32,267
But yeah, any other thoughts about the road maintenance projects, the infrastructure impacts of these overrides?

205
00:19:33,517 --> 00:19:36,059
Yeah, I mean, I think it's an essential part of it.

206
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:53,052
I mean, this allows us to bring a crew in-house, allows us to be that much more agile, allows us to have people, you know, in our DPW that this is like the sole focus of their job as opposed to contracting out every single time we need work done, which not only is, of course, a cost, but it's also, you know, a scheduling challenge.

207
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:56,495
So it's something completely different, allows us to be much more agile and allows us to

208
00:19:57,676 --> 00:20:03,619
chip away on that backlog of street and sidewalk repairs that's been talked about so often.

209
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:08,242
And I think, yeah, I'll stop there.

210
00:20:08,302 --> 00:20:10,303
But it's another equity issue though, too, right?

211
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:15,105
Because we're all using the roads, whether we're walking, we're driving, we're biking.

212
00:20:15,546 --> 00:20:24,511
And this is something that asks for a smaller collective investment rather than someone repairing their car every time they hit a pothole or, you know,

213
00:20:25,253 --> 00:20:31,956
Investing in a different mode of transportation because the roads do not allow them to travel in the way they need to travel for their own mobility constraints.

214
00:20:32,056 --> 00:20:39,640
So I think it's, it's all part of a whole of just a collective investment in a city which may be, you know, it's going to be

215
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:42,794
$40 give or take every month.

216
00:20:43,194 --> 00:20:55,541
But you have to compare to what if you address those issues out of your own pocket through expensive transportation, through tutors, through all of these things that a large amount of people don't have access to, don't have the funds for.

217
00:20:55,982 --> 00:21:00,184
But $40 to get them that is something completely different and something game changing.

218
00:21:00,204 --> 00:21:00,184
100%.

219
00:21:03,306 --> 00:21:09,810
I feel like I'm sitting here thinking about the breadth of time that has to do with how important this vote is, and this seems

220
00:21:10,775 --> 00:21:21,182
to a certain extent to be about visioning and being able to think about where Medford could be, where we want it to be and what are the necessary steps to take now in order to ensure that.

221
00:21:22,183 --> 00:21:36,633
But then a different part of me is thinking about the sort of question of how did we get here and pulling in some equity pieces around knowing that for a very long time, Medford was run by men, run by white men.

222
00:21:37,753 --> 00:21:38,314
It's hard for me

223
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:58,389
And I'm also very much ignorant to a lot of the sort of nuts and bolts, but it's hard for me to place this larger moment at the feet of like, you know, current leaders or like folks who've been only part of the conversation in the last 10 years, because we know that these sort of like property revenue conversations have been in motion for decades.

224
00:21:58,749 --> 00:22:09,435
So I wondered maybe Nicole, if you might kind of speak to how we got here in Medford, maybe some of the larger choices that have happened that are kind of creating this moment.

225
00:22:10,094 --> 00:22:10,735
Yeah, definitely.

226
00:22:11,035 --> 00:22:15,639
So we got here because of Prop 2.5 that was passed in the early 1980s.

227
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:20,124
What is the simplest way to explain this?

228
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:34,538
But it basically limits, a city may increase its total property tax by up to 2.5% of the value of taxable property per year plus an additional amount for new construction, commonly referred to as new growth.

229
00:22:35,618 --> 00:22:41,562
So any increase beyond that must be approved by the majority of voters in the term of an override or a debt exclusion.

230
00:22:41,942 --> 00:22:44,084
So this was passed in the 1980s.

231
00:22:45,124 --> 00:22:51,968
People that were alive then and making financial decisions then can think about, you know, the financial landscape that we were in at the time.

232
00:22:52,589 --> 00:22:54,770
Perhaps it was passed with good intentions, who knows.

233
00:22:55,370 --> 00:23:01,154
But basically any time inflation goes up more than two and a half percent, it's essentially, it's going to be a cut to your city budget.

234
00:23:02,795 --> 00:23:17,585
This was definitely a constraining statute that was established, but it was also set up with a tool of an override or a debt exclusion that allows the majority of the voters to say, hey, we want to collect a little bit more taxes because we want these things in our budget.

235
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,166
We want to do more with our budget.

236
00:23:19,186 --> 00:23:23,148
We don't want to have our budget essentially cut little by little every single year.

237
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:27,071
And I think part of how we got here is it's a,

238
00:23:28,672 --> 00:23:30,053
I think it's a fairly well-known fact.

239
00:23:30,293 --> 00:23:38,900
Well, it's a fact that we had the same mayor for a very long time in Medford, and I think it's a fairly well-known fact that he was against bringing an override to the voters.

240
00:23:39,782 --> 00:23:45,447
you have the same mayor for 28 years, that is a long time of little cut, little cut, little cut, little cut.

241
00:23:45,867 --> 00:23:52,533
And we know things like healthcare, healthcare costs that we cover in the city for our employees go up much, much faster than 2.5%.

242
00:23:53,874 --> 00:23:57,457
If we want to pay our workers what they deserve, it's going to be more than 2.5%.

243
00:23:57,938 --> 00:23:59,559
Look at the contracts that are being settled.

244
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:03,823
If they're getting more than 2.5%, we have to sit and think, where else is that coming from?

245
00:24:04,783 --> 00:24:07,185
So that's kind of how we got here.

246
00:24:07,205 --> 00:24:16,312
I think a lot of cities you'll see that maybe the first time they tried an override, sometimes they pass, a lot of times they pass in the first, sometimes they don't.

247
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:21,856
Sometimes it's just getting it out into the lexicon and people realizing that this is a thing, this is a tool we have in our toolbox.

248
00:24:23,498 --> 00:24:29,042
We are pushing so that this passes, our first attempt at override passes because it's an absolute need.

249
00:24:32,016 --> 00:24:35,237
If it doesn't, hard decisions will have to be made.

250
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:36,638
Cuts will come.

251
00:24:36,658 --> 00:24:38,798
It will be not good.

252
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:41,519
But I know for one, I will try again.

253
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:45,821
And we will get an override passed, ideally this November.

254
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:48,762
And I do.

255
00:24:49,482 --> 00:24:55,368
But I think, you know, it's kind of like the the genies out of the bottle, you know, we've said we are Medford, and we can do an override.

256
00:24:55,648 --> 00:24:59,271
So these conversations are happening, it can be a little uncomfortable for some folks.

257
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:02,594
But for so long, we wouldn't even say it.

258
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,397
And for 28 years for for, you know, for

259
00:25:06,118 --> 00:25:09,200
40 something years since two and a half was passed, that's how we get here.

260
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:14,023
And that's how it can feel like how, you know, people are saying like, how did we suddenly get here?

261
00:25:14,163 --> 00:25:17,325
It was cut by cut by cut by cut every single year.

262
00:25:17,345 --> 00:25:23,910
Um, and then the, the ARPA funding and ESSER funding that came with the pandemic kind of gave us a little bit of a lifeline.

263
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:31,354
And it also let us see some things that we could have in Medford that are really nice to have in Medford that we really should have in Medford.

264
00:25:31,755 --> 00:25:35,257
And now some of those things and some very basic things need to go away.

265
00:25:35,753 --> 00:25:37,255
unless we find another funding source.

266
00:25:38,617 --> 00:25:38,957
I love that.

267
00:25:38,978 --> 00:25:49,272
I'm wondering if any of you have any thoughts about what you might say to somebody who's sort of on the fence or worried about maybe how this would, their ability to pay for an increased tax rate.

268
00:25:50,184 --> 00:25:50,884
Yeah, absolutely.

269
00:25:50,964 --> 00:25:58,826
And I understand our, I think it's, we're lucky and we're also a little bit cursed about these home values.

270
00:25:59,006 --> 00:26:03,787
So as home values go up, our assessments go up and our taxes go up, but of course our tax rate comes down.

271
00:26:04,127 --> 00:26:10,729
So we're within those prop two and a half limits, but I know we're all in different scenarios for how, what our income is in our homes.

272
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:13,830
So as far as folks that are affected, just number one,

273
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:31,116
This is just an investment in the community, and it will absolutely pay dividends in our roads and in our students and in our community as a whole, but for the actual dollars and cents of it, there are a number of programs for seniors on fixed incomes that

274
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:37,621
Medford mandates that are not mandates that Medford operates that are really opt in programs to the state.

275
00:26:37,641 --> 00:26:44,086
So we have our work off program where seniors can work, put in some hours for the city to offset their bill.

276
00:26:44,547 --> 00:26:46,368
There are a number of exemptions.

277
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:57,157
And then there is also the tax deferral program, which allows you to defer the entirety of your real estate bill until you either sell your home or the owner passes away.

278
00:26:57,835 --> 00:27:00,698
And there is, I believe, a 5% interest on that.

279
00:27:00,738 --> 00:27:04,441
So the interest does accrue on that and that bill does have to be paid at some point.

280
00:27:05,161 --> 00:27:15,610
But I think understanding that a lot of our longtime residents may have paid a small amount for their home relative to what it's worth now, I think that's an option that may work for some people.

281
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:20,054
So there are things out there to help folks with real estate taxes in a number of ways.

282
00:27:20,114 --> 00:27:26,139
And those are available on the city website, as well as the Invest in Medford website can tell you more about that.

283
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:34,043
We'll make sure to put links to those in our show notes so people can read more about that.

284
00:27:34,702 --> 00:27:50,926
I wanted to add too that if people are wondering how much this actually impacts you, there's a calculator on the Invest in Medford website and I think the city website too, where you can put in your address and see what the actual impact would be around.

285
00:27:51,866 --> 00:28:01,988
Because although there are, for some people on a tight budget, those programs Nicole mentioned are really important, but for others, they might be surprised like what the actual impact is.

286
00:28:02,668 --> 00:28:03,629
I was definitely surprised.

287
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:04,629
I put my house in there.

288
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:05,830
I was surprised by two things.

289
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:12,195
One, the low cost per month that I assumed it would be much higher, but also the assessed value of my home has changed.

290
00:28:12,715 --> 00:28:14,616
So lots of good things to know there.

291
00:28:16,723 --> 00:28:21,246
It's worth noting that that calculator is powered by the Department of Revenue for the state.

292
00:28:21,306 --> 00:28:26,989
So it's not some magical equation we made up, like this is the state that's saying, you know, here's how your tax bill is gonna be affected.

293
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:29,050
It is based on this fiscal year.

294
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:38,075
So it's, you know, it will change a little bit, but this is our best guess, you know, from the Department of Revenue of how it's gonna impact, what that total bill is gonna look like.

295
00:28:39,235 --> 00:28:39,336
Okay.

296
00:28:40,976 --> 00:28:41,797
Shelley, were you gonna say something?

297
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:47,386
No, just that with very high property values, folks are going to expect to have a certain level of municipal service.

298
00:28:47,466 --> 00:28:49,327
And this is one of the ways that we can get there.

299
00:28:49,367 --> 00:28:51,429
So zooming out, it doesn't seem complicated.

300
00:28:51,449 --> 00:28:52,750
Right.

301
00:28:52,971 --> 00:28:54,232
We have taxes for a reason.

302
00:28:55,142 --> 00:29:00,704
Yeah, I do like the framing around the community aspect.

303
00:29:00,744 --> 00:29:23,654
I think one thing that most folks that I talk to in the city agree with is they care about their neighbors, they care about people in the city, and this is a way of doing that, of paying a little bit of extra money or a little bit more money than we were paying to make sure that people are taken care of or that we're moving towards the city that I think everybody would agree that they want.

304
00:29:24,914 --> 00:29:26,775
Yeah, I think that is a really helpful framing.

305
00:29:27,215 --> 00:29:39,660
So yeah, it seems like a vote no would have some kind of grim impacts, but I'm wondering if these measures do pass, when we would expect to see like the increase in our taxes and then the like revenue for the city.

306
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,040
Absolutely.

307
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,642
So this will impact our next fiscal year budget.

308
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:53,607
So if these don't pass the fiscal year in June, July, well, not what goes into effect in July, what's being established by June, that's where the cuts are going to come in if these don't pass.

309
00:29:54,427 --> 00:29:56,969
If they do pass, we can avoid those cuts.

310
00:29:57,249 --> 00:30:02,211
We don't have to have this conversation in June and people will see the impact on their tax bills actually in January 2025.

311
00:30:02,251 --> 00:30:03,052
So very quick turnaround.

312
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:07,955
Question six actually is a little different.

313
00:30:08,315 --> 00:30:13,459
It won't go into effect right away because that project needs to move on a little bit further is my understanding.

314
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,442
But we do have the calculator just for simplicity.

315
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:18,143
It includes all three questions.

316
00:30:18,803 --> 00:30:19,844
So that's the total amount.

317
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:24,448
But seven and eight, if they pass, will go into effect in January 2025.

318
00:30:24,968 --> 00:30:28,271
And question six will be a little bit later, depending on how that project advances.

319
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,841
It's really helpful to know, thank you.

320
00:30:32,942 --> 00:30:38,425
Anything else anybody wants to add or mention before we wrap up?

321
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:54,536
I wanted to add, because I don't think we went over this, but because some people with the funds that are coming in want more detail about where they'll go, but if they look on

322
00:30:55,036 --> 00:30:57,239
the wording for question eight.

323
00:30:57,299 --> 00:31:12,775
There are there are some things that are very specific like last year when there were cuts to with band and things like that one of the things that came up was they said well a lot there weren't a lot of people who chose band or color guard or those and it

324
00:31:13,295 --> 00:31:19,038
brought up the problem was like that was because of the way it was scheduled and there were scheduling issues.

325
00:31:19,818 --> 00:31:31,303
And so question A, which is like the expansion of the school budget, is going would be part of it would be going to like changing the schedule so that more students can choose the arts.

326
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:38,606
I know Medford always prides itself in investing in the arts, and I do think we have some good programs.

327
00:31:38,926 --> 00:31:47,330
Last year, my daughter was on Color Guard just for the year, and watching the band in the Color Guard, I was moved, and I was like, this is Medford?

328
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,310
This is amazing.

329
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,471
I was so proud of it.

330
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:58,447
you know, having more kids be able to be a part of that and the community that comes from being from that is amazing.

331
00:31:58,808 --> 00:32:08,752
And the other was expanding the vocational program, because we are lucky to have a vocational school, but sometimes they don't offer things and kids have to go to other schools like Minuteman.

332
00:32:09,092 --> 00:32:14,014
So increasing that helps them to, you know, stay in Medford and have those opportunity.

333
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:18,816
So I just wanted to mention those, because I think they're both really important.

334
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:21,137
And I know sometimes I focus on elementary,

335
00:32:21,897 --> 00:32:22,938
Because that's my world.

336
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,922
But those are, you know, those are high school initiatives.

337
00:32:26,843 --> 00:32:27,023
Yeah.

338
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:42,259
And to jump on your point, Christine, about the vocational school, too, is one of the ideas I've seen is because there is such an interest in the vocational programming, some of the different offerings have waitlists and making sure every student that's interested in a specific offering can actually get into that class and get into that program.

339
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:43,520
Yeah.

340
00:32:44,872 --> 00:32:45,213
Thank you.

341
00:32:45,293 --> 00:32:52,025
And if anyone wants to be more involved in your campaign, is there a way that they can reach out or a way they can get more involved?

342
00:32:53,565 --> 00:32:55,767
Yeah, so we are investinmedford.com.

343
00:32:56,548 --> 00:33:11,000
That is great for FAQs, the calculator, just going over the questions that say, here's what it's gonna say on the ballot and here's what this means, because there is specific language you have to use on ballots, which is sometimes not the way we all talk.

344
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:15,183
And then you can learn how to volunteer or donate or just spread the word.

345
00:33:17,045 --> 00:33:17,385
Thank you.

346
00:33:18,223 --> 00:33:20,184
Are there any upcoming events or?

347
00:33:22,045 --> 00:33:26,187
Yes, well, this weekend is like the canvassing kickoff.

348
00:33:27,147 --> 00:33:28,028
There's a whole list.

349
00:33:28,088 --> 00:33:32,830
I think all the weekends coming up or having their be canvassing events.

350
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:41,654
And then in addition, there's a number of house parties that are going on to in different neighborhoods just to be able to talk for the folks working on campaigns and just have conversations with your neighbors.

351
00:33:42,434 --> 00:33:45,536
So if you reach out on that contact form on the website and say, hey, I'm

352
00:33:46,136 --> 00:33:51,859
interested in the house party or I'd like to attend a house party, we'll make sure we can connect you with one in your neighborhood that works for your schedule.

353
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:52,799
Or you can always host one.

354
00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:03,404
Yeah, so hosting an event to learn more, going to an event to learn more, also looking out for canvassing opportunities and canvassers coming to your neighborhood to talk to you.

355
00:34:03,985 --> 00:34:04,245
Great.

356
00:34:04,765 --> 00:34:10,208
And if you want a lawn sign there on that contact tab on the website too, there's a link or

357
00:34:11,088 --> 00:34:13,129
we can click to order a yard sign.

358
00:34:13,269 --> 00:34:14,590
We need to get out more signs.

359
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:21,194
There's so many out, but in certain parts of Medford, we could use some more yes signs.

360
00:34:21,914 --> 00:34:22,275
Perfect.

361
00:34:22,855 --> 00:34:23,075
Awesome.

362
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:24,796
So get a yard sign through the website as well.

363
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:25,356
Yeah.

364
00:34:26,237 --> 00:34:26,497
All right.

365
00:34:26,517 --> 00:34:27,958
Well, this was very informative.

366
00:34:28,018 --> 00:34:29,839
Thank you all for being with us.

367
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:33,361
And people can vote on November.

368
00:34:33,381 --> 00:34:36,943
People can vote on November 5th.

369
00:34:37,263 --> 00:34:37,443
Great.

370
00:34:37,483 --> 00:34:38,224
Well, thank you so much.

371
00:34:39,507 --> 00:34:40,088
Thank you.
