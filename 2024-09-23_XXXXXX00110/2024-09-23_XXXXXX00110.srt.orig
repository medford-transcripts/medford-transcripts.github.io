7
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

[SPEAKER_04]: And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:37,758 --> 00:00:39,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks so much for being here with us today.

10
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Shelly's back.

11
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:43,742
[SPEAKER_04]: We've missed her for a while, but she's here today.

12
00:00:43,762 --> 00:00:45,383
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed you guys too.

13
00:00:45,403 --> 00:00:46,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to be back.

14
00:00:47,144 --> 00:00:47,404
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

15
00:00:48,044 --> 00:00:52,687
[SPEAKER_04]: So the rest of you, if you don't mind introducing yourselves, just with your name, pronouns, and who you are.

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:03,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my name is Nicole Morrell she her, I am the chair of invest in Medford, which is the ballot question campaign in favor of questions, six, seven and eight.

17
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also a former city counselor and mom in Medford, and that covers it.

18
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Christina McCourty.

19
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:24,125
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a volunteer with the Invest in Medford campaign, mostly focusing on the comms, so I might be coming to your door soon to Canvas.

20
00:01:25,426 --> 00:01:33,450
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a currently substitute teaching in the Medford public schools and was a former teacher before that.

21
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:39,073
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also a parent of two kids in the Medford public schools.

22
00:01:42,512 --> 00:01:44,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I'm Jessica Parks.

23
00:01:44,613 --> 00:01:52,677
[SPEAKER_03]: I am also a volunteer with the Invest in Medford campaign and a mom and longtime resident in Medford.

24
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:55,058
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thank you all.

25
00:01:55,098 --> 00:01:59,921
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll just prompt the question of the podcast that we ask everybody, sometimes the hardest one.

26
00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:04,003
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could just share your favorite place to eat in Medford and what you like to eat there.

27
00:02:05,915 --> 00:02:06,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll go.

28
00:02:06,736 --> 00:02:12,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been on before, and I gave the same question before, the same answer before, but I'm going to get into specifics.

29
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,681
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll go with Chili Garden.

30
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:19,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the super spicy stuff, but I also like the bamboo shoots and sesame oil.

31
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:22,929
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've been extra good lately because my son is a huge fan.

32
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:26,111
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just a win because he's a toddler.

33
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:28,914
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything he likes and will eat, it makes it extra good.

34
00:02:30,295 --> 00:02:30,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

35
00:02:33,054 --> 00:02:39,759
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very hard to pick, but I'll say one of my favorite things is the carnitas torta from Tenoch.

36
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

37
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:47,804
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to go with peppermint stick ice cream from Colleen's.

38
00:02:49,205 --> 00:02:50,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we have a frequent one.

39
00:02:50,526 --> 00:02:51,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

40
00:02:51,646 --> 00:02:52,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a good one.

41
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,023
[SPEAKER_04]: haven't heard about Colleen's in a while so it's nice to hear about it again.

42
00:02:56,803 --> 00:03:03,569
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm hoping that you can describe for us kind of what the Invest in Medford campaign is.

43
00:03:05,911 --> 00:03:08,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure I can kick it off and then I'll let other folks join in.

44
00:03:08,713 --> 00:03:14,258
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Invest in Medford campaign at its most basic is a ballot question committee for people who are in favor

45
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:21,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Of question 678 which pertain to a debt exclusion for the new fire headquarters and to overrides for the schools and our streets and sidewalk.

46
00:03:22,324 --> 00:03:26,410
[SPEAKER_02]: The campaign is like most local campaigns is made up of your

47
00:03:26,871 --> 00:03:39,858
[SPEAKER_02]: your friends, your cousins, your neighbors, people in Medford who are invested in investing in Medford and wanna see these campaign, these ballot questions come to fruition and have Medford be funded in the way that it deserves.

48
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:51,044
[SPEAKER_02]: So the ballot measures cover a number of different needs for the city and ask Medford residents if they're in favor of investing in the city in the form of a fixed dollar amount of tax increase to make these things happen.

49
00:03:52,004 --> 00:03:55,466
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm happy to go in more detail or if anyone else wants to jump in.

50
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:05,988
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's great Nicole, and maybe you could expand on what a vote of yes on 678 would mean for this.

51
00:04:07,107 --> 00:04:10,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I'll break them down into each question.

52
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:12,030
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just in sequential order.

53
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:23,859
[SPEAKER_02]: So by voting yes on six, voters are approving a debt exclusion, which would increase taxes for residents and commercial to fund the design and construction of a new fire headquarters that would cover the cost of the project as they are outlined today.

54
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:31,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Any kind of like small changes for timing of project or slight adjustment would be covered, but we're looking at roughly $30 million.

55
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:37,187
[SPEAKER_02]: And what makes it a debt exclusion is this is a tax increase over a set period of time.

56
00:04:37,248 --> 00:04:42,811
[SPEAKER_02]: So once the bill is paid for that project, that amount of tax increase is going to come off everyone's bills.

57
00:04:43,662 --> 00:04:48,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven and eight are overrides, which are permanent, but like the debt exclusion, they're a set amount.

58
00:04:48,245 --> 00:04:49,865
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not a percentage increase.

59
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:53,808
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a set dollar increase to your yearly tax bill.

60
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,829
[SPEAKER_02]: They total $7.5 million together.

61
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:07,795
[SPEAKER_02]: And question seven helps to stabilize our school district and avoid cuts to our school system, as well as fund a permanent street and sidewalk crew in-house instead of always contracting out.

62
00:05:08,215 --> 00:05:11,078
[SPEAKER_02]: for the huge amount of work we need down in the city.

63
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:25,813
[SPEAKER_02]: And question eight really helps the schools reach beyond just stabilizing and making sure everything can stay as it is and reach for things that would really benefit our students and our community through a number of different things that are outlined that I can talk about later or let someone else talk about.

64
00:05:31,068 --> 00:05:31,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

65
00:05:31,488 --> 00:05:31,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

66
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:38,350
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think, you know, Christina and Jessica, you guys are also here as parents in different roles in the city.

67
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:39,990
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to hear from you in a second.

68
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:49,692
[SPEAKER_04]: But one thing we did do in preparation for this episode was to reach out to residents to see kind of what their support or lack of support was for the override.

69
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:55,034
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't receive any messages that conveyed that people did not want this.

70
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,814
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were all messages in support.

71
00:05:56,854 --> 00:05:59,435
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to read a couple and then and sort of see

72
00:06:01,175 --> 00:06:04,738
[SPEAKER_04]: How these resonate with you all if you have anything that you would add or agree with here.

73
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:13,927
[SPEAKER_04]: So, a resident named Michelle and said right now made for public schools have already had to cut valuable valuable positions and services due to budget issues last year.

74
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:20,513
[SPEAKER_04]: If these tax overrides don't pass 35 to 45 more positions will be cut along with services such as behavioral support staff.

75
00:06:20,993 --> 00:06:24,996
[SPEAKER_04]: paraprofessionals, advanced courses at the high school, and the arts throughout the district.

76
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:36,546
[SPEAKER_04]: This means teachers will take on more work, have less time and energy to create engaging lessons, and certainly less time and energy to spend with students individually as class sizes throughout the district would rise.

77
00:06:37,086 --> 00:06:41,690
[SPEAKER_04]: To have less than adequate funding makes teaching near impossible.

78
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:46,254
[SPEAKER_04]: The added burdens of inadequate funding make what should be a joyful job a miserable one.

79
00:06:46,634 --> 00:06:49,036
[SPEAKER_04]: These difficult working conditions will directly affect

80
00:06:50,106 --> 00:06:56,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Our students in Medford, please don't ever forget that teacher working conditions are student learning conditions.

81
00:06:56,768 --> 00:07:00,589
[SPEAKER_04]: If teachers are struggling and unhappy, students will be too.

82
00:07:00,609 --> 00:07:08,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I want my children to go to a school in a district where teachers are happy and supported, and I hope that district can be Medford.

83
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:17,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Another person said that they're in support of 6, 7, and 8 because Medford's needs can't be met as is.

84
00:07:17,573 --> 00:07:27,155
[SPEAKER_04]: The value to our community of being able to do more instead of figuring out how to do less is worth way more to me than $37 in my pocket a month.

85
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:34,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I would have gladly supported a bigger ask because these three initiatives are only scratching the surface of what our community needs.

86
00:07:34,636 --> 00:07:35,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Prop 2.5 has not made

87
00:07:37,737 --> 00:07:39,199
[SPEAKER_04]: was not made to never be broken.

88
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:46,747
[SPEAKER_04]: The majority of our cities and towns have passed multiple overrides, which is why our surrounding communities have more resources and amenities than we have.

89
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:55,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I have two young kids and hope to stay in Medford for their childhoods, but the decision will certainly have to be revisited if there's no broad community support for our schools.

90
00:07:57,118 --> 00:07:58,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll pause there and see, you know.

91
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:22,330
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I feel like one of the big things there that runs through is like that Medford Public Schools always tries to do as much as they can with the budget they're given, but that's really not okay for our kids and for our teachers.

92
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,552
[SPEAKER_00]: We are supposed to meet

93
00:08:27,964 --> 00:08:28,945
[SPEAKER_00]: each child's needs.

94
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:37,891
[SPEAKER_00]: We're supposed to figure out each child as an individual, get to know them, figure out their needs, and that can't happen the way things are now.

95
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:45,757
[SPEAKER_00]: So class size came up, and we are feeling the effects right now of the cuts that already happened last year.

96
00:08:45,777 --> 00:08:49,840
[SPEAKER_00]: We have large class sizes, and you know,

97
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:58,203
[SPEAKER_00]: is when you have like 24 second graders, which I am subbing right now in a class of 24 second graders.

98
00:08:59,044 --> 00:09:04,226
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're trying to get to know them and figure them out as learners and give them what they need.

99
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:06,907
[SPEAKER_00]: It is impossible.

100
00:09:08,787 --> 00:09:11,709
[SPEAKER_00]: Education has come a long way from what it was decades ago.

101
00:09:11,849 --> 00:09:15,190
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like the expectations are higher and they should be.

102
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:19,372
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is not a sustainable job when your class sizes are

103
00:09:19,972 --> 00:09:21,013
[SPEAKER_00]: are large.

104
00:09:22,935 --> 00:09:34,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that didn't come up in what those comments, but that comes up for me is like how the underfunding in our schools has created inequity.

105
00:09:34,425 --> 00:09:38,449
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there are further cuts, it just furthers the inequity.

106
00:09:39,069 --> 00:09:45,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's so hard to get, for example, a child on an IP and get kids the services they need.

107
00:09:45,715 --> 00:09:57,799
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is that it's the parents who are the most in the know, the parents who have the money for lawyers and the parents who have the money for advocates that can fight hard for their kids.

108
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:02,761
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people know the easiest way to get things for your kids is when the parents initiate it.

109
00:10:05,662 --> 00:10:24,969
[SPEAKER_00]: what I would like to see is a funded school where teachers can feel comfortable like bringing up kids and not being brushed off and where parents can bring up concerns and not be brushed off the way that often happens in Medford because we just don't have the funds to really give the kids what they need.

110
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,010
[SPEAKER_00]: So the equity piece is really big for me.

111
00:10:28,491 --> 00:10:31,772
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of inequity in Medford and you see it in the schools.

112
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:45,606
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, when there were cuts, it concerned me because I felt like the larger classes with the needier populations is really hard.

113
00:10:45,626 --> 00:10:48,229
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there are more cuts, I don't know how

114
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,091
[SPEAKER_00]: just to be honest, I don't know how we could have more cuts.

115
00:10:52,872 --> 00:11:02,376
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like us to fund the school so that we don't have to make the cuts, but then we also can actually provide what the kids need and the teachers.

116
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,196
[SPEAKER_00]: That was another thing they spoke to.

117
00:11:04,696 --> 00:11:06,197
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to keep our teachers.

118
00:11:06,377 --> 00:11:17,642
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, financially, people can go, paraprofessionals too, everyone that works in the schools, they can go somewhere else nearby for more money.

119
00:11:18,622 --> 00:11:27,888
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanna make their job doable and keep the class sizes smaller and have the support staff we need.

120
00:11:27,928 --> 00:11:33,872
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard guidance, we need so much social emotional learning support and guidance.

121
00:11:35,053 --> 00:11:41,637
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of this too is helping to increase salaries hopefully for teachers in Paris.

122
00:11:43,338 --> 00:11:46,440
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, a lot of that is big.

123
00:11:49,059 --> 00:12:11,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing that I heard in those comments, which is tied into the inequity piece, I think somewhat, but just the reality of what happens if they don't pass is, I think one of the people said that they could potentially leave Medford if they don't pass.

124
00:12:12,884 --> 00:12:14,925
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's troublesome.

125
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:16,505
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been here for,

126
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,028
[SPEAKER_03]: 13 years, we're not going anywhere.

127
00:12:21,048 --> 00:12:26,730
[SPEAKER_03]: The cost of houses in this area are ridiculous.

128
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,211
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not moving anywhere.

129
00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:32,431
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not in a position to move anywhere else.

130
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:43,535
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it doesn't pass, then is it that people who can move elsewhere to other districts where they're investing in their children,

131
00:12:44,315 --> 00:12:46,316
[SPEAKER_03]: then those children have the opportunities.

132
00:12:46,456 --> 00:12:51,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Or people who can't afford to have their children go to private schools, their children get those opportunities.

133
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:59,482
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the children left in the Medford schools are left with what the Medford schools end up becoming.

134
00:13:00,022 --> 00:13:09,267
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that worries me personally for my own kid and all the other kids who will be left in the Medford school district if it doesn't pass.

135
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:19,394
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did hear that from a few other people, like how this decision is going to affect their decision about if they stay in Medford or not.

136
00:13:20,314 --> 00:13:23,276
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, yeah.

137
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:28,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can't blame people because if a community says we don't want to invest in this, we don't care about our public schools.

138
00:13:29,461 --> 00:13:30,982
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, you know, that's really jarring.

139
00:13:32,585 --> 00:13:39,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Chrissy, I just wanted to key in on an important point you made, sharing that you're already feeling the weight of larger class sizes.

140
00:13:39,347 --> 00:13:40,647
[SPEAKER_01]: It is September 20th, right?

141
00:13:40,907 --> 00:13:57,731
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wondered if you might speak to maybe some of the, you know, you've got years of expertise in teaching some of the ramifications of what larger class sizes mean in so far as learning, not to mention the kind of individualized support that all our kids deserve, but maybe some of the kids, you know, navigating learning stuff.

142
00:13:58,452 --> 00:13:59,952
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, what are the classrooms feeling like?

143
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:15,880
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just, I mean, as simple as it sounds, it's just like having all those like bodies in the room and then trying to manage them takes a lot of energy.

144
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:20,405
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you're here to teach and learn and, you know,

145
00:14:21,802 --> 00:14:34,909
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about how to be kind and good people and all this stuff, but you get bogged down sometimes with trying to get 24 people ready.

146
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:42,373
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to just do this assessment that we have to do on the Chromebooks, and it took 10 minutes to get everyone set up.

147
00:14:42,393 --> 00:14:43,373
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just a lot of time wasted.

148
00:14:47,315 --> 00:14:49,036
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes kids longer.

149
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:50,697
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything takes longer.

150
00:14:53,298 --> 00:15:01,761
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're teaching something, you want to be able to assess their background knowledge, see where they are, and meet them where they are.

151
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:02,922
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be able to

152
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:08,716
[SPEAKER_00]: rotate around the room and feel like you've checked in with each student.

153
00:15:09,756 --> 00:15:11,297
[SPEAKER_00]: See, okay, who's got it?

154
00:15:11,718 --> 00:15:15,421
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I need to check in with like these kids, they really don't have it.

155
00:15:17,262 --> 00:15:19,304
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and when there's so many

156
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:20,485
[SPEAKER_00]: children.

157
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:28,412
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really hard to go around, especially because of all the things that come up, like children are children.

158
00:15:28,452 --> 00:15:34,037
[SPEAKER_00]: There's kids who are just having a hard time paying attention or there's kids chatting.

159
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:36,359
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these behaviors that you have to manage.

160
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:36,459
[SPEAKER_00]: And

161
00:15:39,737 --> 00:15:42,060
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that, that becomes hard.

162
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:54,112
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, like, if you have kids that you want to bring up that are concerning, you know, it's just hard because, you know, when I was a teacher, I always felt like I had, you know, I couldn't bring up

163
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:58,036
[SPEAKER_00]: all the kids because there were so many.

164
00:15:58,437 --> 00:16:03,342
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to make all these decisions about who's the most neediest and things like that.

165
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:09,208
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like the more kids you have, the harder all that is.

166
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:16,535
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year I happened to be in a class, I know it's ideal, but there were 15 children and it just

167
00:16:17,456 --> 00:16:18,176
[SPEAKER_00]: It was wonderful.

168
00:16:18,216 --> 00:16:21,497
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I did feel like I could check in with everyone.

169
00:16:22,157 --> 00:16:25,498
[SPEAKER_00]: I did feel like we were a nice family, like a community.

170
00:16:26,358 --> 00:16:35,361
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just hard when, yeah, like the more of them there are, the harder it is to give them the individual attention that they need.

171
00:16:37,428 --> 00:16:38,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, yeah.

172
00:16:38,549 --> 00:16:50,916
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was one other person who wrote into us that said that if there's no vote on these questions that Medford will continue to be in a worse state year after year and that it almost guarantees that we'll be passed over for the new high school.

173
00:16:50,936 --> 00:17:00,381
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if, yeah, I think that like the new high school was sort of the reason that I started thinking about this or hearing about overrides or like a budget increase.

174
00:17:00,461 --> 00:17:03,223
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I wonder if there's any thoughts about that.

175
00:17:05,295 --> 00:17:08,856
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Nicole, I don't know if you know more about the the heist.

176
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:12,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah, so part of this is, none of us can see the future.

177
00:17:12,357 --> 00:17:19,439
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think what that person is getting to is that we have something on the ballot right now that's asking people whether or not they want to invest in our public schools.

178
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:25,860
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they say no, that's going to signal to the MSBA that covers part of a new high school.

179
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,281
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't cover the entirety of the community has to cover for part of it as well.

180
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:32,044
[SPEAKER_02]: And that requires another debt exclusion down the line.

181
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:40,196
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're already saying now we don't want to invest in our public schools, they're not going to likely want to go through the process with us to continue towards a new high school.

182
00:17:40,516 --> 00:17:45,423
[SPEAKER_02]: If they think that the next time it comes up to invest in our public schools in the form of new high school, we're going to say no again.

183
00:17:45,823 --> 00:17:50,524
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of them reading the tea leaves of what we're telling them with this vote.

184
00:17:50,584 --> 00:17:52,565
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really important in that sense, too.

185
00:17:52,585 --> 00:17:58,126
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know there's some confusion, understandably, that people think that what does this vote have to do with the new high school?

186
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:02,747
[SPEAKER_02]: It's its own separate vote, but it definitely does have an impact in a different way.

187
00:18:05,588 --> 00:18:06,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

188
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:12,129
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when you spend money, you're showcasing your values, and this is an opportunity to showcase our municipal values.

189
00:18:12,969 --> 00:18:13,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

190
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Community values, rather.

191
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

192
00:18:17,732 --> 00:18:32,066
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't want to frame it that everyone was writing to us about the schools because there was another person who was talking about streets and sidewalk repair maintenance and saying that those things are projects that have been kicked down the road by many mayors and city councils in the past.

193
00:18:32,927 --> 00:18:37,031
[SPEAKER_04]: He said that there's 95 miles of roadway in Medford and in 2023 one street that was 1300 feet long was replaced.

194
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:42,614
[SPEAKER_04]: At that rate, we'll have dirt roads in 10 years.

195
00:18:43,434 --> 00:18:48,076
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need more funding for infrastructure, lead pipes, burst pipes, sidewalks that you trip over.

196
00:18:48,096 --> 00:18:50,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is a good example.

197
00:18:50,537 --> 00:18:53,738
[SPEAKER_04]: I think even when we talk about the school budget, we talk about teacher salaries.

198
00:18:53,818 --> 00:18:59,940
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think you all did a great job of illustrating all the other things that we don't maybe think about every day if we aren't in the schools.

199
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:04,862
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this person does a good job of talking about, we hear complaints about the roads all the time.

200
00:19:04,982 --> 00:19:06,323
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a way to start addressing

201
00:19:07,283 --> 00:19:10,286
[SPEAKER_04]: fixing them, but also all of the other things that maybe we need to fix.

202
00:19:11,928 --> 00:19:19,555
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think one of the arguments I was hearing along the way was like, we don't need to raise taxes because we're going to be getting more revenue from businesses in the city.

203
00:19:19,595 --> 00:19:23,699
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think if our roads are a mess, no one's going to want to drive through here to get to different places.

204
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:32,267
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, any other thoughts about the road maintenance projects, the infrastructure impacts of these overrides?

205
00:19:33,517 --> 00:19:36,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I think it's an essential part of it.

206
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:53,052
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this allows us to bring a crew in-house, allows us to be that much more agile, allows us to have people, you know, in our DPW that this is like the sole focus of their job as opposed to contracting out every single time we need work done, which not only is, of course, a cost, but it's also, you know, a scheduling challenge.

207
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:56,495
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's something completely different, allows us to be much more agile and allows us to

208
00:19:57,676 --> 00:20:03,619
[SPEAKER_02]: chip away on that backlog of street and sidewalk repairs that's been talked about so often.

209
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:08,242
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, yeah, I'll stop there.

210
00:20:08,302 --> 00:20:10,303
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's another equity issue though, too, right?

211
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:15,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're all using the roads, whether we're walking, we're driving, we're biking.

212
00:20:15,546 --> 00:20:24,511
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is something that asks for a smaller collective investment rather than someone repairing their car every time they hit a pothole or, you know,

213
00:20:25,253 --> 00:20:31,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Investing in a different mode of transportation because the roads do not allow them to travel in the way they need to travel for their own mobility constraints.

214
00:20:32,056 --> 00:20:39,640
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's, it's all part of a whole of just a collective investment in a city which may be, you know, it's going to be

215
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:42,794
[SPEAKER_02]: $40 give or take every month.

216
00:20:43,194 --> 00:20:55,541
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to compare to what if you address those issues out of your own pocket through expensive transportation, through tutors, through all of these things that a large amount of people don't have access to, don't have the funds for.

217
00:20:55,982 --> 00:21:00,184
[SPEAKER_02]: But $40 to get them that is something completely different and something game changing.

218
00:21:00,204 --> 00:21:00,184
100%.

219
00:21:03,306 --> 00:21:09,810
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm sitting here thinking about the breadth of time that has to do with how important this vote is, and this seems

220
00:21:10,775 --> 00:21:21,182
[SPEAKER_01]: to a certain extent to be about visioning and being able to think about where Medford could be, where we want it to be and what are the necessary steps to take now in order to ensure that.

221
00:21:22,183 --> 00:21:36,633
[SPEAKER_01]: But then a different part of me is thinking about the sort of question of how did we get here and pulling in some equity pieces around knowing that for a very long time, Medford was run by men, run by white men.

222
00:21:37,753 --> 00:21:38,314
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard for me

223
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:58,389
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm also very much ignorant to a lot of the sort of nuts and bolts, but it's hard for me to place this larger moment at the feet of like, you know, current leaders or like folks who've been only part of the conversation in the last 10 years, because we know that these sort of like property revenue conversations have been in motion for decades.

224
00:21:58,749 --> 00:22:09,435
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wondered maybe Nicole, if you might kind of speak to how we got here in Medford, maybe some of the larger choices that have happened that are kind of creating this moment.

225
00:22:10,094 --> 00:22:10,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.

226
00:22:11,035 --> 00:22:15,639
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got here because of Prop 2.5 that was passed in the early 1980s.

227
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:20,124
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the simplest way to explain this?

228
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:34,538
[SPEAKER_02]: But it basically limits, a city may increase its total property tax by up to 2.5% of the value of taxable property per year plus an additional amount for new construction, commonly referred to as new growth.

229
00:22:35,618 --> 00:22:41,562
[SPEAKER_02]: So any increase beyond that must be approved by the majority of voters in the term of an override or a debt exclusion.

230
00:22:41,942 --> 00:22:44,084
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was passed in the 1980s.

231
00:22:45,124 --> 00:22:51,968
[SPEAKER_02]: People that were alive then and making financial decisions then can think about, you know, the financial landscape that we were in at the time.

232
00:22:52,589 --> 00:22:54,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps it was passed with good intentions, who knows.

233
00:22:55,370 --> 00:23:01,154
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically any time inflation goes up more than two and a half percent, it's essentially, it's going to be a cut to your city budget.

234
00:23:02,795 --> 00:23:17,585
[SPEAKER_02]: This was definitely a constraining statute that was established, but it was also set up with a tool of an override or a debt exclusion that allows the majority of the voters to say, hey, we want to collect a little bit more taxes because we want these things in our budget.

235
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,166
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to do more with our budget.

236
00:23:19,186 --> 00:23:23,148
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to have our budget essentially cut little by little every single year.

237
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:27,071
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think part of how we got here is it's a,

238
00:23:28,672 --> 00:23:30,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a fairly well-known fact.

239
00:23:30,293 --> 00:23:38,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's a fact that we had the same mayor for a very long time in Medford, and I think it's a fairly well-known fact that he was against bringing an override to the voters.

240
00:23:39,782 --> 00:23:45,447
[SPEAKER_02]: you have the same mayor for 28 years, that is a long time of little cut, little cut, little cut, little cut.

241
00:23:45,867 --> 00:23:52,533
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know things like healthcare, healthcare costs that we cover in the city for our employees go up much, much faster than 2.5%.

242
00:23:53,874 --> 00:23:57,457
[SPEAKER_02]: If we want to pay our workers what they deserve, it's going to be more than 2.5%.

243
00:23:57,938 --> 00:23:59,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the contracts that are being settled.

244
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:03,823
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're getting more than 2.5%, we have to sit and think, where else is that coming from?

245
00:24:04,783 --> 00:24:07,185
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of how we got here.

246
00:24:07,205 --> 00:24:16,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of cities you'll see that maybe the first time they tried an override, sometimes they pass, a lot of times they pass in the first, sometimes they don't.

247
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:21,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's just getting it out into the lexicon and people realizing that this is a thing, this is a tool we have in our toolbox.

248
00:24:23,498 --> 00:24:29,042
[SPEAKER_02]: We are pushing so that this passes, our first attempt at override passes because it's an absolute need.

249
00:24:32,016 --> 00:24:35,237
[SPEAKER_02]: If it doesn't, hard decisions will have to be made.

250
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:36,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Cuts will come.

251
00:24:36,658 --> 00:24:38,798
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be not good.

252
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:41,519
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know for one, I will try again.

253
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:45,821
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will get an override passed, ideally this November.

254
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:48,762
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do.

255
00:24:49,482 --> 00:24:55,368
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think, you know, it's kind of like the the genies out of the bottle, you know, we've said we are Medford, and we can do an override.

256
00:24:55,648 --> 00:24:59,271
[SPEAKER_02]: So these conversations are happening, it can be a little uncomfortable for some folks.

257
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:02,594
[SPEAKER_02]: But for so long, we wouldn't even say it.

258
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,397
[SPEAKER_02]: And for 28 years for for, you know, for

259
00:25:06,118 --> 00:25:09,200
[SPEAKER_02]: 40 something years since two and a half was passed, that's how we get here.

260
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:14,023
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how it can feel like how, you know, people are saying like, how did we suddenly get here?

261
00:25:14,163 --> 00:25:17,325
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cut by cut by cut by cut every single year.

262
00:25:17,345 --> 00:25:23,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then the, the ARPA funding and ESSER funding that came with the pandemic kind of gave us a little bit of a lifeline.

263
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:31,354
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also let us see some things that we could have in Medford that are really nice to have in Medford that we really should have in Medford.

264
00:25:31,755 --> 00:25:35,257
[SPEAKER_02]: And now some of those things and some very basic things need to go away.

265
00:25:35,753 --> 00:25:37,255
[SPEAKER_02]: unless we find another funding source.

266
00:25:38,617 --> 00:25:38,957
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.

267
00:25:38,978 --> 00:25:49,272
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering if any of you have any thoughts about what you might say to somebody who's sort of on the fence or worried about maybe how this would, their ability to pay for an increased tax rate.

268
00:25:50,184 --> 00:25:50,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.

269
00:25:50,964 --> 00:25:58,826
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand our, I think it's, we're lucky and we're also a little bit cursed about these home values.

270
00:25:59,006 --> 00:26:03,787
[SPEAKER_02]: So as home values go up, our assessments go up and our taxes go up, but of course our tax rate comes down.

271
00:26:04,127 --> 00:26:10,729
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're within those prop two and a half limits, but I know we're all in different scenarios for how, what our income is in our homes.

272
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:13,830
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as folks that are affected, just number one,

273
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:31,116
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just an investment in the community, and it will absolutely pay dividends in our roads and in our students and in our community as a whole, but for the actual dollars and cents of it, there are a number of programs for seniors on fixed incomes that

274
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:37,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford mandates that are not mandates that Medford operates that are really opt in programs to the state.

275
00:26:37,641 --> 00:26:44,086
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have our work off program where seniors can work, put in some hours for the city to offset their bill.

276
00:26:44,547 --> 00:26:46,368
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a number of exemptions.

277
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:57,157
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there is also the tax deferral program, which allows you to defer the entirety of your real estate bill until you either sell your home or the owner passes away.

278
00:26:57,835 --> 00:27:00,698
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is, I believe, a 5% interest on that.

279
00:27:00,738 --> 00:27:04,441
[SPEAKER_02]: So the interest does accrue on that and that bill does have to be paid at some point.

280
00:27:05,161 --> 00:27:15,610
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think understanding that a lot of our longtime residents may have paid a small amount for their home relative to what it's worth now, I think that's an option that may work for some people.

281
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:20,054
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are things out there to help folks with real estate taxes in a number of ways.

282
00:27:20,114 --> 00:27:26,139
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are available on the city website, as well as the Invest in Medford website can tell you more about that.

283
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:34,043
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll make sure to put links to those in our show notes so people can read more about that.

284
00:27:34,702 --> 00:27:50,926
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to add too that if people are wondering how much this actually impacts you, there's a calculator on the Invest in Medford website and I think the city website too, where you can put in your address and see what the actual impact would be around.

285
00:27:51,866 --> 00:28:01,988
[SPEAKER_00]: Because although there are, for some people on a tight budget, those programs Nicole mentioned are really important, but for others, they might be surprised like what the actual impact is.

286
00:28:02,668 --> 00:28:03,629
[SPEAKER_04]: I was definitely surprised.

287
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:04,629
[SPEAKER_04]: I put my house in there.

288
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:05,830
[SPEAKER_04]: I was surprised by two things.

289
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:12,195
[SPEAKER_04]: One, the low cost per month that I assumed it would be much higher, but also the assessed value of my home has changed.

290
00:28:12,715 --> 00:28:14,616
[SPEAKER_04]: So lots of good things to know there.

291
00:28:16,723 --> 00:28:21,246
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth noting that that calculator is powered by the Department of Revenue for the state.

292
00:28:21,306 --> 00:28:26,989
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not some magical equation we made up, like this is the state that's saying, you know, here's how your tax bill is gonna be affected.

293
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:29,050
[SPEAKER_02]: It is based on this fiscal year.

294
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:38,075
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, you know, it will change a little bit, but this is our best guess, you know, from the Department of Revenue of how it's gonna impact, what that total bill is gonna look like.

295
00:28:39,235 --> 00:28:39,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

296
00:28:40,976 --> 00:28:41,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Shelley, were you gonna say something?

297
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:47,386
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just that with very high property values, folks are going to expect to have a certain level of municipal service.

298
00:28:47,466 --> 00:28:49,327
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of the ways that we can get there.

299
00:28:49,367 --> 00:28:51,429
[SPEAKER_01]: So zooming out, it doesn't seem complicated.

300
00:28:51,449 --> 00:28:52,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

301
00:28:52,971 --> 00:28:54,232
[SPEAKER_00]: We have taxes for a reason.

302
00:28:55,142 --> 00:29:00,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I do like the framing around the community aspect.

303
00:29:00,744 --> 00:29:23,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I think one thing that most folks that I talk to in the city agree with is they care about their neighbors, they care about people in the city, and this is a way of doing that, of paying a little bit of extra money or a little bit more money than we were paying to make sure that people are taken care of or that we're moving towards the city that I think everybody would agree that they want.

304
00:29:24,914 --> 00:29:26,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that is a really helpful framing.

305
00:29:27,215 --> 00:29:39,660
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it seems like a vote no would have some kind of grim impacts, but I'm wondering if these measures do pass, when we would expect to see like the increase in our taxes and then the like revenue for the city.

306
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

307
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,642
[SPEAKER_02]: So this will impact our next fiscal year budget.

308
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:53,607
[SPEAKER_02]: So if these don't pass the fiscal year in June, July, well, not what goes into effect in July, what's being established by June, that's where the cuts are going to come in if these don't pass.

309
00:29:54,427 --> 00:29:56,969
[SPEAKER_02]: If they do pass, we can avoid those cuts.

310
00:29:57,249 --> 00:30:02,211
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to have this conversation in June and people will see the impact on their tax bills actually in January 2025.

311
00:30:02,251 --> 00:30:03,052
[SPEAKER_02]: So very quick turnaround.

312
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:07,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Question six actually is a little different.

313
00:30:08,315 --> 00:30:13,459
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't go into effect right away because that project needs to move on a little bit further is my understanding.

314
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,442
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do have the calculator just for simplicity.

315
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:18,143
[SPEAKER_02]: It includes all three questions.

316
00:30:18,803 --> 00:30:19,844
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the total amount.

317
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:24,448
[SPEAKER_02]: But seven and eight, if they pass, will go into effect in January 2025.

318
00:30:24,968 --> 00:30:28,271
[SPEAKER_02]: And question six will be a little bit later, depending on how that project advances.

319
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,841
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really helpful to know, thank you.

320
00:30:32,942 --> 00:30:38,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else anybody wants to add or mention before we wrap up?

321
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:54,536
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to add, because I don't think we went over this, but because some people with the funds that are coming in want more detail about where they'll go, but if they look on

322
00:30:55,036 --> 00:30:57,239
[SPEAKER_00]: the wording for question eight.

323
00:30:57,299 --> 00:31:12,775
[SPEAKER_00]: There are there are some things that are very specific like last year when there were cuts to with band and things like that one of the things that came up was they said well a lot there weren't a lot of people who chose band or color guard or those and it

324
00:31:13,295 --> 00:31:19,038
[SPEAKER_00]: brought up the problem was like that was because of the way it was scheduled and there were scheduling issues.

325
00:31:19,818 --> 00:31:31,303
[SPEAKER_00]: And so question A, which is like the expansion of the school budget, is going would be part of it would be going to like changing the schedule so that more students can choose the arts.

326
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:38,606
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Medford always prides itself in investing in the arts, and I do think we have some good programs.

327
00:31:38,926 --> 00:31:47,330
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, my daughter was on Color Guard just for the year, and watching the band in the Color Guard, I was moved, and I was like, this is Medford?

328
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,310
[SPEAKER_00]: This is amazing.

329
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,471
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so proud of it.

330
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:58,447
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, having more kids be able to be a part of that and the community that comes from being from that is amazing.

331
00:31:58,808 --> 00:32:08,752
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other was expanding the vocational program, because we are lucky to have a vocational school, but sometimes they don't offer things and kids have to go to other schools like Minuteman.

332
00:32:09,092 --> 00:32:14,014
[SPEAKER_00]: So increasing that helps them to, you know, stay in Medford and have those opportunity.

333
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:18,816
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to mention those, because I think they're both really important.

334
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:21,137
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know sometimes I focus on elementary,

335
00:32:21,897 --> 00:32:22,938
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's my world.

336
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,922
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are, you know, those are high school initiatives.

337
00:32:26,843 --> 00:32:27,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

338
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:42,259
[SPEAKER_02]: And to jump on your point, Christine, about the vocational school, too, is one of the ideas I've seen is because there is such an interest in the vocational programming, some of the different offerings have waitlists and making sure every student that's interested in a specific offering can actually get into that class and get into that program.

339
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:43,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

340
00:32:44,872 --> 00:32:45,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

341
00:32:45,293 --> 00:32:52,025
[SPEAKER_04]: And if anyone wants to be more involved in your campaign, is there a way that they can reach out or a way they can get more involved?

342
00:32:53,565 --> 00:32:55,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so we are investinmedford.com.

343
00:32:56,548 --> 00:33:11,000
[SPEAKER_02]: That is great for FAQs, the calculator, just going over the questions that say, here's what it's gonna say on the ballot and here's what this means, because there is specific language you have to use on ballots, which is sometimes not the way we all talk.

344
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:15,183
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can learn how to volunteer or donate or just spread the word.

345
00:33:17,045 --> 00:33:17,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

346
00:33:18,223 --> 00:33:20,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any upcoming events or?

347
00:33:22,045 --> 00:33:26,187
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, well, this weekend is like the canvassing kickoff.

348
00:33:27,147 --> 00:33:28,028
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole list.

349
00:33:28,088 --> 00:33:32,830
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all the weekends coming up or having their be canvassing events.

350
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:41,654
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in addition, there's a number of house parties that are going on to in different neighborhoods just to be able to talk for the folks working on campaigns and just have conversations with your neighbors.

351
00:33:42,434 --> 00:33:45,536
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you reach out on that contact form on the website and say, hey, I'm

352
00:33:46,136 --> 00:33:51,859
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in the house party or I'd like to attend a house party, we'll make sure we can connect you with one in your neighborhood that works for your schedule.

353
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:52,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can always host one.

354
00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:03,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so hosting an event to learn more, going to an event to learn more, also looking out for canvassing opportunities and canvassers coming to your neighborhood to talk to you.

355
00:34:03,985 --> 00:34:04,245
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

356
00:34:04,765 --> 00:34:10,208
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want a lawn sign there on that contact tab on the website too, there's a link or

357
00:34:11,088 --> 00:34:13,129
[SPEAKER_00]: we can click to order a yard sign.

358
00:34:13,269 --> 00:34:14,590
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get out more signs.

359
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:21,194
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many out, but in certain parts of Medford, we could use some more yes signs.

360
00:34:21,914 --> 00:34:22,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

361
00:34:22,855 --> 00:34:23,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

362
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:24,796
[SPEAKER_04]: So get a yard sign through the website as well.

363
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:25,356
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

364
00:34:26,237 --> 00:34:26,497
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

365
00:34:26,517 --> 00:34:27,958
