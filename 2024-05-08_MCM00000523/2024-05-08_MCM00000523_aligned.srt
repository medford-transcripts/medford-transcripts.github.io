1
00:00:00,231 --> 00:00:01,272
Good evening, everybody.

2
00:00:01,552 --> 00:00:07,915
I am Paulette Vander Kloot, chair of this subcommittee on the School Committee for the Charter Study.

3
00:00:08,556 --> 00:00:10,196
And I'm calling this meeting to order.

4
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:22,863
Present, we have Ron Giovino, Eunice Brown, Aubrey Webb, and Milva.

5
00:00:23,984 --> 00:00:24,244
Milva.

6
00:00:27,975 --> 00:00:30,076
And we're expecting one other member soon.

7
00:00:31,617 --> 00:00:32,778
Phyllis will be joining us.

8
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,342
So tonight we're going to take off where we left off more or less last week.

9
00:00:39,443 --> 00:00:50,450
In terms of the agenda for the first item of a business approval of the minutes of the meeting held on 3-19-2024, I'm going to ask that we table that for tonight.

10
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:54,433
So if we can have a motion to table.

11
00:00:55,154 --> 00:00:55,875
Motion to table.

12
00:00:56,255 --> 00:00:56,535
Okay.

13
00:00:56,575 --> 00:00:56,955
Thank you.

14
00:00:57,696 --> 00:00:58,276
All in favor?

15
00:00:59,557 --> 00:00:59,717
Aye.

16
00:01:00,177 --> 00:01:00,257
Aye.

17
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:01,899
Okay.

18
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:15,087
The second item of business is we're going to go back to the comparison document and which we were originally working from.

19
00:01:15,107 --> 00:01:18,230
Aubrey, if you could bring that up.

20
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:22,773
That's at the article four.

21
00:01:23,608 --> 00:01:28,390
Yeah, it's four, and we're going to go to 4-3 initially.

22
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:40,996
Last time, we spent a lot of time on 4-1 and 4-2 when we worked through ideas and where we're going to head on those items, wording.

23
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:48,679
We're going to pick up on 4-5, but I'm going to leave that for, we're going to discuss 4-3 and 4-4, and I think 4-6 first actually.

24
00:01:54,453 --> 00:02:08,544
Now, I was not able to be at the meeting, the larger meeting on last Thursday, but my sense of it is that we are tonight have before us some of the same issues.

25
00:02:09,345 --> 00:02:16,030
And again, I know you didn't get to any, I read the minutes, but I haven't been able to watch the whole meeting.

26
00:02:18,607 --> 00:02:25,329
Section 4-3 is pretty standard and says prohibitions.

27
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:35,251
As I looked at these, I did not work out new wording for these sections as I had earlier.

28
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:46,233
I think that this first Melrose one and Aubrey, can you just slide it up a little bit?

29
00:02:48,615 --> 00:02:50,476
They're very similar in intent.

30
00:02:53,677 --> 00:02:57,459
Basically, they all say you cannot hold any other position.

31
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:08,104
And so you can't basically be paid twice by the city.

32
00:03:08,184 --> 00:03:14,247
So you can't be a school committee member and hold a paying position within the city.

33
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,360
But you can be mayor and be paid on the school committee.

34
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,500
Is that correct?

35
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,601
Yes, that's true.

36
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:25,002
Well, yes.

37
00:03:27,502 --> 00:03:29,903
I think that's sort of interesting, Ron.

38
00:03:31,264 --> 00:03:39,147
Remember, we initially, when we started out, I mean, those were considered stipends.

39
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:42,408
So the mayor received a stipend

40
00:03:43,673 --> 00:03:46,774
And for the service time on the school committee.

41
00:03:47,355 --> 00:03:54,738
Then as time went on, because of tax reasons, we were told that we had to, it had to be salaried.

42
00:03:54,778 --> 00:03:58,259
So that became an additional part of the mayor's salary.

43
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,861
But not a separate position as to prohibit.

44
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:05,683
So we might want to figure,

45
00:04:06,905 --> 00:04:07,765
that wording out.

46
00:04:08,946 --> 00:04:16,627
But there's a question, I think a bigger question about compensation in the next area.

47
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:34,472
All of these, they have this thing though that if you work for the city and you leave so that you can run and be on the school committee,

48
00:04:35,724 --> 00:04:44,027
But then you decide you want to leave the school committee position and go back to your employment, you can do that without the year wait.

49
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:47,328
Where does it say that?

50
00:04:47,508 --> 00:04:49,169
Is it in writing or is that?

51
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:50,389
No, it is.

52
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:58,212
Aubrey, if you scroll down so I can see more of the green,

53
00:04:59,369 --> 00:05:02,011
I need another sentence of the green, yeah.

54
00:05:02,131 --> 00:05:18,743
It says, this section shall not prevent a city officer or any other city employee who has vacated a position in order to serve as a member of the school committee from returning to the same office or other position of city employment held at the time the position was vacated.

55
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:28,900
provided, however, that no such person shall be eligible for any other municipal position until at least one year following the termination.

56
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:41,911
So if I'm the budget person at City Hall and I decide to take a leave, I can go take a leave and run for school committee.

57
00:05:42,772 --> 00:05:47,156
And then if I decide to leave the school committee, I can come back and go right into my position.

58
00:05:47,656 --> 00:05:48,737
This is how I understand it.

59
00:05:49,268 --> 00:05:52,130
But I can't take a different job within the city.

60
00:05:53,250 --> 00:06:08,299
Well, and the other question, too, is if you don't take a leave, say you terminate your position and then want to come back, is that different than having taken a leave to be in the school committee?

61
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,521
I have no idea.

62
00:06:11,081 --> 00:06:13,823
Yeah, so I guess my point of this is that

63
00:06:15,186 --> 00:06:23,132
I'd like to know what the Mass General Laws are saying and how we, you know, what's in line with what their legal employment rights are.

64
00:06:23,272 --> 00:06:32,239
I don't know if that's something we can dictate unless, you know, it sounds right that if you go, you leave your position, you have the ability to go back to your position.

65
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:35,941
But then again, what's the term before you do that?

66
00:06:36,422 --> 00:06:40,425
And if that position gets filled, do you still have that ability?

67
00:06:41,328 --> 00:06:41,508
Right.

68
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:44,129
I don't understand.

69
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:47,810
That was from my school committee perspective.

70
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:52,252
I know that we had Bill Brady was the case in point.

71
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,333
He ran for the school committee.

72
00:06:55,353 --> 00:07:01,816
He had to leave his job because he couldn't get paid in two different areas.

73
00:07:02,236 --> 00:07:03,216
And that's what he did.

74
00:07:03,296 --> 00:07:04,096
He left his job.

75
00:07:05,957 --> 00:07:18,679
I know that it's pretty standard practice that if you serve on the school committee, you can't get paid by the city in a job for a year.

76
00:07:21,055 --> 00:07:27,219
So the other things in those paragraphs are all consistent with what I understand.

77
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:37,885
All three of the schools, all three of the towns, had this thing about if you leave and go back.

78
00:07:37,985 --> 00:07:40,987
And that's not something, I mean, to me, that's all very theoretical.

79
00:07:41,988 --> 00:07:50,253
The thing that I see, when I see all three towns identical with their thoughts, it makes me believe that they're just following mass general laws.

80
00:07:51,494 --> 00:07:53,756
Okay, so we have to look up Mass General Laws.

81
00:07:54,476 --> 00:07:55,898
I didn't do that, again.

82
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:06,086
Well, I think it is safe to assume that because they're all listed here, I think it's safe to assume that it is within the Massachusetts General Laws that that's true.

83
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:16,374
But I think there are other conditions that I don't know the answers to, such as if a finance director leaves to go to the school committee,

84
00:08:17,442 --> 00:08:21,426
Then decides to leave the school committee to go back and that position is not available.

85
00:08:22,046 --> 00:08:24,188
They have no ability to go back to that position.

86
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:26,831
Right, but is that our.

87
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:31,195
Is that really our purview to.

88
00:08:36,227 --> 00:08:38,489
I mean, there's so many hypotheticals in that.

89
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:38,849
Right.

90
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:40,811
No, I hear you.

91
00:08:40,951 --> 00:08:41,631
That's what I'm saying.

92
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:49,157
I think we're crossing an HR line boundary here that I don't know if any of us know the answer.

93
00:08:49,218 --> 00:08:58,065
It's interesting that it's here for everybody that they can go back if they want to, but nowhere does it define within six months, within three months,

94
00:08:58,724 --> 00:09:00,785
Right, what happens if the position isn't there?

95
00:09:00,885 --> 00:09:03,006
Because you would assume the position isn't there.

96
00:09:03,486 --> 00:09:15,551
Now, in the areas that people have reviewed for the charter for city council, is there also not a similar position?

97
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:18,553
I thought I remember reading something similar.

98
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,334
That's what I was going to say.

99
00:09:20,454 --> 00:09:25,717
Isn't this language that's going to have to be consistent across all three branches of government?

100
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:27,739
I certainly think it's going to be.

101
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:33,222
Whatever we put here needs to be the same in the other two areas.

102
00:09:35,023 --> 00:09:39,066
I take it this is not an area that was discussed last week.

103
00:09:40,527 --> 00:09:40,987
I don't remember.

104
00:09:41,067 --> 00:09:41,468
Yeah.

105
00:09:41,608 --> 00:09:47,331
I don't recall if this provision is under city council or mayor, but we'd have to look.

106
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:53,111
Okay, so right now on this particular one, we have some questions.

107
00:09:53,231 --> 00:10:01,676
All of the wording, I think it's actually, I think they're all the same, but again, I'm only seeing part of it now as I was re-reviewing it this afternoon.

108
00:10:02,516 --> 00:10:03,737
They're very, very similar.

109
00:10:06,158 --> 00:10:08,319
So I think we put this aside.

110
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:10,840
The question is what's under Mass General Law?

111
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,662
What's under for City Council?

112
00:10:13,982 --> 00:10:14,202
Is that?

113
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:22,260
Well, this must be standard language, because it's in all three of these charters, and I'm guessing it would be in others too.

114
00:10:23,601 --> 00:10:33,468
So I don't, you know, I don't think that the mass general law conflict is going to be a big issue, but.

115
00:10:33,668 --> 00:10:36,470
Okay.

116
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:42,334
So I think, I mean, nobody has any, we're not debating the points within the language.

117
00:10:42,994 --> 00:10:44,195
Is that true, everybody?

118
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:46,550
No, I think we all agree on that.

119
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:51,655
I just think the verbiage of what we put in there will be up to the Collins Center to help us with.

120
00:10:52,255 --> 00:10:52,876
OK.

121
00:10:53,356 --> 00:10:54,697
Yeah, I think we don't need to.

122
00:10:55,017 --> 00:10:57,299
I think we all agree that that's OK.

123
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:59,841
It's just consistently OK.

124
00:11:00,362 --> 00:11:00,662
OK.

125
00:11:01,343 --> 00:11:05,106
So I think we can move on to section 4-4, compensation.

126
00:11:09,337 --> 00:11:12,582
And now I'm going to start sort of really asking the same thing.

127
00:11:14,084 --> 00:11:19,493
In terms of compensation, the discussions for the city council

128
00:11:21,574 --> 00:11:37,622
And I mean, earlier, when I was at earlier, some earlier meetings, we talked about maybe making a committee, a city committee that would, of people who would deliberate on compensation.

129
00:11:38,443 --> 00:11:42,485
And so we had discussed that in the entire committee.

130
00:11:43,885 --> 00:11:52,433
I clearly think that, and I'm sure you agree that whatever we say for compensation for the school committee should be consistent with the city council.

131
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,916
And I'm not talking about the amounts, I'm talking about the process.

132
00:11:59,931 --> 00:12:08,353
I think this reflects what it says for city council and the committee would not set the salaries.

133
00:12:08,573 --> 00:12:14,694
They would just be a research and advisory committee so that they would still need to be set by ordinance.

134
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:21,756
And the ordinance would be put together by the city council, not by the school committee, correct?

135
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:22,536
Yes.

136
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:29,538
As far as we know, the school committee cannot set its own pay scale.

137
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:31,498
Is that correct?

138
00:12:32,438 --> 00:12:34,740
I haven't seen any place where that happens.

139
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:41,846
I'm pretty sure that the city council is the appropriating body for ordinance, yes.

140
00:12:42,827 --> 00:12:51,635
What's very interesting here is the, in the first one, is the 18 months, it shall have to be adopted during the first 18 months of the term?

141
00:12:53,343 --> 00:12:56,124
for which the school committee members were elected.

142
00:12:56,244 --> 00:13:08,651
In other words, not wanting to have a last minute November, December, as we saw this year, which ended up, you know, causing.

143
00:13:09,211 --> 00:13:11,032
So that's kind of an interesting thing.

144
00:13:12,272 --> 00:13:15,214
Aubrey, can you scroll down a little bit more so we can see Pittsfield?

145
00:13:22,997 --> 00:13:25,778
Pittsburgh, Pittsfields has that 18 months as well.

146
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:26,339
Yeah.

147
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:27,599
And so does Weymouth.

148
00:13:34,383 --> 00:13:36,984
Weymouth does include a piece on expenses.

149
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:43,868
And so that's interesting.

150
00:13:43,928 --> 00:13:45,248
It's a very open-ended

151
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:59,781
statement, I would think that we would want to say the expenses of conferences

152
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,050
I think we would want to define it.

153
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:08,892
So the school committee members have a conference they can go to on a yearly basis every November.

154
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,172
It's usually held in Hyannis.

155
00:14:12,812 --> 00:14:16,093
It's sponsored by the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.

156
00:14:16,873 --> 00:14:19,674
And traditionally, the school district does pay for it.

157
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:25,655
There has been some, you know, there were some years where there were a particular member or two.

158
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:28,857
who objected to that.

159
00:14:29,717 --> 00:14:35,761
It is definitely, it's, you know, basically professional development for the school committee.

160
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,784
And that's a very positive thing.

161
00:14:39,944 --> 00:14:41,085
I went for many years.

162
00:14:42,846 --> 00:14:45,587
And traditionally, our expenses were covered for that.

163
00:14:45,748 --> 00:14:52,192
So I would, I think we should articulate that and maybe other, you know,

164
00:14:53,820 --> 00:15:20,022
expect this this is a the way that it's written it's um uh if i go to a school event and there's a charge i could um uh i i could ask to be um compensated for it and i don't think that that's the the what we want well and since you you if you can remember paulette was the um

165
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:32,646
superintendent's office, the place that has a budget item that would allow for seminars and other type committees?

166
00:15:33,326 --> 00:15:41,508
And does it also include, there was that other one where you all go to, where you have a representative to the Mass Association of School Committees.

167
00:15:43,188 --> 00:15:44,329
Isn't there one person?

168
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:47,589
Wasn't, didn't, what is?

169
00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:50,030
Anne Marie Cuno?

170
00:15:50,626 --> 00:15:53,328
Yeah, she was like on the board, right?

171
00:15:53,428 --> 00:15:54,650
Right, she was the board.

172
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,312
So who determines that she can expense?

173
00:15:57,792 --> 00:15:59,754
Does that come from the superintendent's office?

174
00:15:59,954 --> 00:16:05,759
No, when you get to that level, the Mass Association of School Committee pays for those.

175
00:16:05,859 --> 00:16:07,481
So it's only for the local conference.

176
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:12,505
And there's a day on the Hill conference as well.

177
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:15,368
I mean, I certainly never put in for expenses.

178
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:27,431
I think that it would be useful to articulate that the expenses regarding the annual conference would be reimbursed.

179
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:43,198
But I think I think being careful about putting details specifics like that is because what if that conference changed and then it wasn't, you know, and the chart is a charter is it's very difficult to change.

180
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,242
It's not I think it's it's intended to be general.

181
00:16:46,842 --> 00:16:54,606
So, okay, the only the opposite of that, though, is that in the general statement, the general statement as it is in way myth.

182
00:16:56,047 --> 00:17:04,892
Suggests that you could be reimbursed for any expense and there are great subject to appropriation and prior authorization.

183
00:17:05,873 --> 00:17:10,095
Yeah, yeah, I don't I don't think we should put a limit on this.

184
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:13,136
I don't think I don't think we should confine it.

185
00:17:13,156 --> 00:17:13,797
This is Phyllis.

186
00:17:15,305 --> 00:17:19,127
Right, so should we just take, I mean, we don't have to include the paragraph at all.

187
00:17:19,727 --> 00:17:32,872
Well, Paulette, is it business as usual that if you wanted to go to some special seminar somewhere, you would go to the superintendent or would you go to the mayor to get it appropriated that you would be reimbursed?

188
00:17:33,392 --> 00:17:39,235
Well, if it's the school committee conference, it's discussed on the floor.

189
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:40,432
Right.

190
00:17:40,672 --> 00:17:45,276
And it's always been that if you went, your expenses would be covered.

191
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:46,216
Right.

192
00:17:46,577 --> 00:17:50,339
Are there other conferences and stuff that they could avail themselves of?

193
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,041
Well, there are always things that you can go to.

194
00:17:53,061 --> 00:17:55,143
Right.

195
00:17:56,544 --> 00:17:58,745
But do they not have to have prior approval?

196
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:01,608
Yeah.

197
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:06,971
So a school committee, so they would, but prior authorization from who?

198
00:18:08,232 --> 00:18:08,953
That's my question.

199
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,931
Well, who generally has done it, Paula?

200
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:16,213
Did you ever go to a conference that wasn't this one you're talking about in IANIS?

201
00:18:17,573 --> 00:18:19,014
I did, but I paid for it myself.

202
00:18:19,754 --> 00:18:20,035
Okay.

203
00:18:20,195 --> 00:18:24,256
But if you didn't pay for yourself, could you have been reimbursed?

204
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:27,278
And if so, what would that process be?

205
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:36,137
Well, I don't honestly know, because I don't think it said anything and, you know, it just wasn't clear.

206
00:18:36,237 --> 00:18:39,260
And I don't know what other school committee members did.

207
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:48,347
Well, I think as long as that we put something in there that, you know, it needs authorization or prior approval.

208
00:18:53,635 --> 00:19:01,861
Yeah, I'm also okay with the prior authorization, but this being broad, if there's prior authorizations, I think that will keep folks from... Yeah.

209
00:19:02,461 --> 00:19:07,545
It'll not be worth the time to go through all the paperwork to be reimbursed for a $5 school event or something.

210
00:19:07,685 --> 00:19:12,088
Are we saying prior authorization from the superintendent, from the school committee?

211
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:14,790
Yeah, good question.

212
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:18,132
Well, we don't know who distributes the funds, so... Yeah.

213
00:19:18,861 --> 00:19:34,452
Well, what I'm saying is, so if I'm a school committee member and I go to the superintendent and say, hey, I want to go to this $1,000 or $2,000 thing out in San Francisco, OK, pay my expenses.

214
00:19:34,813 --> 00:19:36,974
Well, the superintendent doesn't want to piss me off.

215
00:19:37,715 --> 00:19:39,076
So they say yes.

216
00:19:41,577 --> 00:19:46,561
I'm just saying, and I'm being theoretical here, that you don't

217
00:19:48,715 --> 00:19:50,096
you don't want to put the superintendent.

218
00:19:50,176 --> 00:19:53,479
Now, maybe it's from prior authorization from the school committee as a whole.

219
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:54,499
Right.

220
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,882
And it comes out of someone's budget.

221
00:19:57,962 --> 00:20:01,565
So someone would say, wait a minute, we're not the budgetary person here.

222
00:20:02,225 --> 00:20:02,986
We have to go here.

223
00:20:04,675 --> 00:20:17,458
Exactly, and I think that this kind of ruling that they have to go to get pre-approval from the superintendent will force the superintendent to create a line item in her budget for such expenses.

224
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:21,900
That's my guess.

225
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,581
Then it would be up to the superintendent to release that money if it's her budget item.

226
00:20:28,672 --> 00:20:34,595
But now to Paul, it's point of asking for something and the superintendent doesn't want to tick her off.

227
00:20:35,076 --> 00:20:36,797
Well, the superintendent works for the.

228
00:20:36,817 --> 00:20:37,377
Answers to.

229
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,164
the school committee members.

230
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:47,585
So that appears to be a bit problematic there.

231
00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:59,029
Well, I have to say, and I may be naive, but it would be pretty terrible if the superintendent or a mayor would approve something because they didn't want to piss someone off.

232
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:00,889
I mean, I hope we're past that.

233
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:06,291
I think it makes more sense to prior authorization from the school committee.

234
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,224
Yeah, as a whole.

235
00:21:08,284 --> 00:21:11,647
Well, first it says subject to appropriation.

236
00:21:11,928 --> 00:21:13,769
So there has to be an appropriation.

237
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,393
And then prior, that's how I read it anyway.

238
00:21:18,314 --> 00:21:20,136
Right, but what does appropriation mean?

239
00:21:20,156 --> 00:21:22,398
Do you have to go to the city council to get the bill paid?

240
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:31,547
No, there is money in the school budget to cover professional development.

241
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:43,045
I just feel that giving the school committee the power to approve that expense is not, it's kind of a conflict there.

242
00:21:45,407 --> 00:21:47,348
So I think we just leave off the paragraph.

243
00:21:47,948 --> 00:21:51,531
I agree.

244
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:51,631
Yeah.

245
00:21:52,031 --> 00:21:55,934
If you look, I think it's the only one of the three that included it.

246
00:21:56,474 --> 00:21:56,834
It is.

247
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:57,055
Yeah.

248
00:21:57,515 --> 00:22:01,878
Okay, so let's just, we've discussed it, we're going to drop it.

249
00:22:02,525 --> 00:22:02,905
Yeah.

250
00:22:03,386 --> 00:22:03,746
OK.

251
00:22:06,489 --> 00:22:06,749
Great.

252
00:22:06,949 --> 00:22:15,236
And I don't think it matters if you could go, Aubrey, if you could go back up to the green writing.

253
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:36,491
I think the only other difference I noticed was the Melrose had the line about the health and life insurance.

254
00:22:37,712 --> 00:22:39,974
Oh.

255
00:22:41,335 --> 00:22:41,996
How does that work?

256
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:48,181
There must be some reason they put that in there.

257
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:51,924
And there's a good reason why we should include it in ours.

258
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:55,687
Now, unless...

259
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:06,274
unless something changes, because that has been an issue in the past in the school committee, and it needs to be spelt out.

260
00:23:10,535 --> 00:23:13,877
So I think that Melrose is the one that we should use.

261
00:23:13,897 --> 00:23:18,199
Can I ask a question, Paulette?

262
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:18,559
Yeah.

263
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:26,482
Do your years of service on the school committee apply to a city pension at the end of your career?

264
00:23:27,608 --> 00:23:30,190
Well, you know, Ron, that's such an interesting question.

265
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,873
Because theoretically, maybe I should go ask that question.

266
00:23:34,893 --> 00:23:36,034
Yeah.

267
00:23:37,194 --> 00:23:39,116
Because I think it does.

268
00:23:40,436 --> 00:23:45,240
But I've never asked for myself, and I'm not collecting a pension at this point.

269
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,983
So I think that there have certainly been others who have, and that it does.

270
00:23:50,993 --> 00:23:54,456
I've been told that the city council gets a pension after 10 years.

271
00:23:54,636 --> 00:23:55,497
That's what I've been told.

272
00:23:56,157 --> 00:23:56,438
Right.

273
00:23:56,538 --> 00:24:01,542
But you can also define years of service by different ways.

274
00:24:01,602 --> 00:24:04,264
I mean, you don't have to be a city councilor for 10 years.

275
00:24:04,304 --> 00:24:06,546
You could be a city councilor for five.

276
00:24:06,606 --> 00:24:10,529
You could be a crossing guard for three and a teacher for two.

277
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:16,254
So I'm just wondering what those are and whether it's part of the purview of what we're talking about.

278
00:24:18,827 --> 00:24:20,028
Well, it's an excellent question.

279
00:24:20,068 --> 00:24:20,648
I don't know.

280
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:24,210
And I'm not quite sure who I would ask.

281
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:24,991
Does anybody know?

282
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:27,092
I don't know.

283
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:31,415
I haven't seen mention of pensions in any charters that we've looked at.

284
00:24:31,935 --> 00:24:32,656
No, right.

285
00:24:33,156 --> 00:24:37,719
But it just came up because we're talking about health insurance and life insurance.

286
00:24:37,939 --> 00:24:39,980
Well, the city has an HR person now.

287
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,922
So yeah, that'd be the place to start.

288
00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:55,152
Well, again, I assume there are established rules and laws that the city must abide by that when an employee starts at the city, they get the HR package.

289
00:24:55,172 --> 00:24:55,972
I would assume that.

290
00:24:56,652 --> 00:25:03,614
So until we know what people get and what they don't get, how do we know what they're eligible for or what they're not?

291
00:25:03,674 --> 00:25:12,797
Obviously, Melrose did a deep dive in finding that out, but... Well, they did say notwithstanding any general or special law, to the contrary, so...

292
00:25:15,531 --> 00:25:25,679
And at some point, if we're talking about equity between our elected officers, health care is obviously a very big chunk.

293
00:25:26,139 --> 00:25:37,487
And city council, I mean, apart from the pay inequity that there was, the other inequity that has been longstanding was that city council was getting health insurance and school committee was not.

294
00:25:39,481 --> 00:25:53,005
Now, I'm not about to go suggest that school committee now gets health care even only, you know, this is a major issue, but I'm not sure that I'm going to be the one who's going to put it out there.

295
00:25:53,025 --> 00:25:54,245
Somebody will.

296
00:25:55,366 --> 00:25:55,586
Yeah.

297
00:25:55,746 --> 00:26:03,288
Well, again, I mean, maybe this is way above our pay grades here, but I think we should not include that in what we're saying.

298
00:26:03,468 --> 00:26:03,908
If that's

299
00:26:05,298 --> 00:26:16,303
If that's the, I'm sure there are established employee benefits packages that, I mean, Paulette, you've been there for a long time, and you are unaware of those things, so.

300
00:26:16,883 --> 00:26:20,064
So one of the things, right, because nobody ever told me.

301
00:26:20,564 --> 00:26:21,285
Well, that's what I mean.

302
00:26:21,485 --> 00:26:22,505
It's kind of like.

303
00:26:22,585 --> 00:26:23,866
And so at one point,

304
00:26:25,493 --> 00:26:43,496
When someone all of a sudden decided, a school committee member all of a sudden decided that they should get health insurance, they went and got it, and the rest of us had never asked and never got it.

305
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:44,356
Wow.

306
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:52,798
After that person left the school committee, I think somewhere it actually says that, no, you don't get health insurance.

307
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:55,769
Right.

308
00:26:55,889 --> 00:26:57,730
So yeah.

309
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,811
Health insurance is based on hours.

310
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:02,372
And how do you measure the hours a school committee person works?

311
00:27:02,392 --> 00:27:03,533
So, right.

312
00:27:03,773 --> 00:27:07,995
So, and each one probably works a different amount of hours, right.

313
00:27:08,175 --> 00:27:20,302
But city council had, again, this seems to me to be something that either the larger committee is going to talk to, or we're going to talk to, you know, if we talk to about making a, uh, um,

314
00:27:21,492 --> 00:27:33,676
a committee within the city who's going to review the pay, the salary, that this would ultimately come up before that person or those people.

315
00:27:33,696 --> 00:27:34,556
Yeah.

316
00:27:34,716 --> 00:27:37,457
Was that an argument to not include it in the charter in case?

317
00:27:38,838 --> 00:27:44,259
On the other hand, part of me says, yeah, you should include it in the charter so that it's clear.

318
00:27:47,338 --> 00:27:56,141
Now, with that particular thing, what I can find out is whether where it's written that the school committee does not get health insurance.

319
00:27:56,962 --> 00:28:01,003
Okay, so that's a detail that I need to find out.

320
00:28:02,304 --> 00:28:08,866
Yeah, I'm just, I'm agreeing with what Aubrey said in that it's not,

321
00:28:11,343 --> 00:28:14,806
something that we know enough about to put into the charter at this point.

322
00:28:14,846 --> 00:28:18,048
It doesn't enhance what would happen.

323
00:28:18,188 --> 00:28:19,670
It doesn't take away from what would happen.

324
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:32,580
We don't have the ability to say who's eligible and who's not eligible without doing a deep dive into how the city handles their employees, and that shouldn't be in this charter.

325
00:28:35,564 --> 00:28:51,094
Do we think that there still is interest from the larger committee to craft language around how compensation should work for the mayor, the city council, and the school committee?

326
00:28:52,234 --> 00:28:53,675
In terms of that advisory board?

327
00:28:54,055 --> 00:28:54,235
Yeah.

328
00:28:54,896 --> 00:28:56,557
Yeah, I think that that's still on the table.

329
00:28:56,577 --> 00:28:58,218
I don't remember it being shot down.

330
00:28:58,736 --> 00:29:01,477
Right, okay, so there's still an advisory board.

331
00:29:02,057 --> 00:29:05,719
Anyway, I think that we've covered the issues in this.

332
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:11,261
I think we're taking out the expenses and we're taking out this.

333
00:29:12,522 --> 00:29:16,783
And the rest of the statements seems to be consistent.

334
00:29:17,844 --> 00:29:21,625
And are we covering the mayor getting two salaries?

335
00:29:23,086 --> 00:29:24,627
Is that being okay?

336
00:29:24,987 --> 00:29:27,268
Are we gonna put that in there or just turn it?

337
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:45,633
I think we need to add a clause with the exception of the mayor who will receive compensation both for his or her, or their mayoral duties and those of the school.

338
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:47,755
Aubrey, can you find a place to put that?

339
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:55,641
So we're using the Melrose verbiage?

340
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:05,649
Go down to Pittsfield, I think.

341
00:30:22,834 --> 00:30:26,615
Oh, so that actually is under prohibitions.

342
00:30:26,695 --> 00:30:27,895
It's in the previous section.

343
00:30:29,172 --> 00:30:32,673
So we need to add a clause to prohibitions.

344
00:30:35,474 --> 00:30:36,515
That's where it was, Ron.

345
00:30:36,995 --> 00:30:37,355
OK.

346
00:30:37,975 --> 00:30:38,215
Yeah.

347
00:30:40,616 --> 00:30:42,817
Where it forbids to have two salaries.

348
00:30:44,678 --> 00:30:47,199
That mayor, that the mayor.

349
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:54,881
With the exception of the mayor holding mayoral office and chairperson of the school committee.

350
00:30:55,281 --> 00:30:55,441
Right.

351
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:02,305
It sounds good.

352
00:31:03,326 --> 00:31:03,646
Okay.

353
00:31:07,527 --> 00:31:08,268
Okie dokie.

354
00:31:08,588 --> 00:31:08,868
Um.

355
00:31:11,749 --> 00:31:21,093
And I think 1 of the challenges you have Paulette is that some of the stuff we're going to talk about will go out of the school committee and hit the city council and the mayor.

356
00:31:22,193 --> 00:31:23,234
In different ways, so.

357
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:32,787
I think it's great that we come up with our opinion here, but that could be subject to change if the body of the whole wants to do something that impacts everybody else.

358
00:31:33,347 --> 00:31:34,308
No, I totally agree.

359
00:31:34,729 --> 00:31:34,949
Yeah.

360
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:35,990
Okay.

361
00:31:37,171 --> 00:31:37,491
Okay.

362
00:31:37,691 --> 00:31:40,874
So that's compensation.

363
00:31:42,135 --> 00:31:48,320
Now, I'm going to skip to, could we skip to 4.6, the filling of vacancies?

364
00:31:59,036 --> 00:32:08,738
Now, reading through the notes of the last meeting, it certainly sounds like you guys touched on this.

365
00:32:08,758 --> 00:32:21,202
The thing where it gets a little bit more complicated is when you've got Ward,

366
00:32:22,811 --> 00:32:27,192
when you've got people voted for by warts.

367
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:30,173
Or in our case, by double warts.

368
00:32:30,713 --> 00:32:30,913
Right.

369
00:32:30,953 --> 00:32:31,193
Yeah.

370
00:32:31,293 --> 00:32:31,974
Or double warts.

371
00:32:32,014 --> 00:32:32,614
Double warts.

372
00:32:32,894 --> 00:32:33,094
Yeah.

373
00:32:37,735 --> 00:32:38,075
Right.

374
00:32:38,855 --> 00:32:51,359
So with that, I think that if we take the Melrose

375
00:32:52,874 --> 00:32:54,835
um, wording.

376
00:32:57,035 --> 00:32:58,676
The vacancy shall be filled.

377
00:33:00,976 --> 00:33:05,818
Um, shall be filled.

378
00:33:05,838 --> 00:33:15,581
Yeah, I think the next, um, highest risk of folks within the ward.

379
00:33:16,441 --> 00:33:16,901
Yeah.

380
00:33:21,429 --> 00:33:25,072
What does it does it have an option when we run out of other candidates?

381
00:33:28,335 --> 00:33:29,636
Well, it does have an option.

382
00:33:29,656 --> 00:33:29,697
So.

383
00:33:31,418 --> 00:33:37,383
Yeah, so so that's.

384
00:33:37,444 --> 00:33:38,084
So if it's by

385
00:33:45,961 --> 00:33:56,270
So when we say by ward, it's from the ward that the person creating the vacancy.

386
00:34:03,257 --> 00:34:03,557
Right.

387
00:34:08,962 --> 00:34:10,904
Descending order of votes received.

388
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,281
What happens if there's no one in that ward?

389
00:34:19,861 --> 00:34:20,982
Well, that's the next step.

390
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:23,103
The first step is there is someone.

391
00:34:23,643 --> 00:34:28,205
So if there is someone, it's by the next person in line.

392
00:34:28,646 --> 00:34:28,706
OK.

393
00:34:28,806 --> 00:34:28,886
OK.

394
00:34:28,906 --> 00:34:29,286
Yeah.

395
00:34:29,906 --> 00:34:30,347
Yeah.

396
00:34:31,107 --> 00:34:31,427
OK.

397
00:34:31,827 --> 00:34:35,909
So that's now it's, OK, there is no person in that ward.

398
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:37,870
OK.

399
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:38,871
Yeah.

400
00:34:39,151 --> 00:34:40,932
There is no person in that ward.

401
00:34:43,438 --> 00:34:48,900
Is it going to be a person that's been elected in the city?

402
00:34:51,482 --> 00:34:54,283
We've got two, the potential.

403
00:34:57,125 --> 00:35:11,372
I can remember clearly and distinctly reading this portion that when there is nobody next up and nobody wants it, you wait until you get somebody to do it.

404
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,701
And I think that's Massachusetts law.

405
00:35:15,242 --> 00:35:19,625
You really couldn't ask somebody out of a ward to come in to take over that position.

406
00:35:20,086 --> 00:35:20,406
Okay.

407
00:35:20,446 --> 00:35:22,708
So Ron, to my recollection.

408
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:23,509
Yes.

409
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:25,330
At our last meeting.

410
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:26,251
Yes.

411
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:29,674
We had two different alternatives.

412
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:37,060
One is eight wards, eight members.

413
00:35:38,258 --> 00:35:38,638
Okay.

414
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:40,039
Plus the mayor, right?

415
00:35:40,299 --> 00:35:40,900
Plus the mayor.

416
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:46,563
So in that case, it's next, it's the next person in line.

417
00:35:47,984 --> 00:35:48,164
Right.

418
00:35:48,544 --> 00:35:48,884
Okay.

419
00:35:49,124 --> 00:35:51,146
No, no, it wouldn't be the next person in line.

420
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:52,727
It would be the next person in a ward.

421
00:35:53,167 --> 00:35:53,387
Right.

422
00:35:53,427 --> 00:35:55,308
Next person in the ward in line.

423
00:35:55,608 --> 00:35:56,269
Right.

424
00:35:57,309 --> 00:36:02,132
If then there was nobody in the ward.

425
00:36:03,033 --> 00:36:03,253
Right.

426
00:36:04,032 --> 00:36:07,739
And then think about our recent with Melanie leaving.

427
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:08,380
OK.

428
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:08,701
Yeah.

429
00:36:09,202 --> 00:36:11,806
There's nobody in the war now behind her.

430
00:36:12,468 --> 00:36:14,631
Are you going to leave that spot?

431
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:35,785
All I can say, all I can say is, and I don't, I'm trying to find it in front of me, but in the Massachusetts general law, when they're talking about if next up is not available and there's nobody who runs for that position, it does not have an option other than to wait for that person, somebody to step up.

432
00:36:37,006 --> 00:36:38,347
And what do they mean by step up?

433
00:36:38,998 --> 00:36:53,401
become, so let's say we decide to go to four ward representative districts of two wards in each section, that would be four, then you'd have two at large, you'd have the mayor.

434
00:36:54,042 --> 00:36:59,423
So in one ward, if the ward says we don't have anybody,

435
00:37:00,423 --> 00:37:07,488
then the city would have to say to the ward, well, you need to come up with somebody who's going to be doing this.

436
00:37:07,528 --> 00:37:18,895
I think in that scenario is just only because if we're all in a room, somebody says, well, the only way we're going to get out of here is if one of you decide to be the leader.

437
00:37:19,476 --> 00:37:22,098
Well, then I think somebody would be the leader.

438
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:32,705
But if I recall reading general laws, the mayor doesn't appoint somebody, doesn't come outside from another area.

439
00:37:34,567 --> 00:37:37,469
I think the worst case scenario is it's left blank.

440
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,251
And let me ask another question, Ron.

441
00:37:40,651 --> 00:37:45,575
Does that person who steps up have to be from that ward?

442
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:46,413
Yes.

443
00:37:47,013 --> 00:37:47,834
Okay, all right.

444
00:37:47,854 --> 00:37:48,074
Yes.

445
00:37:48,574 --> 00:37:55,998
Yeah, because you can't, once you start bringing people to be ward reps who aren't in the ward, you deteriorate the whole ward process.

446
00:37:56,518 --> 00:37:57,259
Yeah, yeah.

447
00:37:57,619 --> 00:38:00,500
Well, I just wanted to know what the Massachusetts law said, yeah.

448
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:13,607
Yeah, and I'm trying to find it here in my, I know I read it and I know that's, I was shocked when it said, you do nothing until somebody steps up.

449
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:18,485
I'm a little bit confused about what that step up would mean if it's not an election, though.

450
00:38:19,425 --> 00:38:22,825
Well, because, well, you would, well, here's what you would be.

451
00:38:23,626 --> 00:38:32,027
If somebody leaves and there's no next stop person, the next person who got any votes, you would have to have an election.

452
00:38:32,987 --> 00:38:38,048
If nobody pulls papers to nominate to be elected, then somebody has to pull papers.

453
00:38:38,528 --> 00:38:41,629
And if it's one person that pulls the papers, they automatically get in.

454
00:38:44,093 --> 00:38:44,673
So there is an election.

455
00:38:44,693 --> 00:38:48,354
You wouldn't have an election when there's, there's no election when there's one person running.

456
00:38:49,754 --> 00:38:49,954
Right.

457
00:38:50,654 --> 00:38:58,976
But if you, you know, the process, if you envision the process, this here's, here's our ward and nobody in our ward cares enough to want to do this.

458
00:38:59,516 --> 00:39:07,298
So you start looking for people and maybe you come up with two, three people, but the ability to not have to run a campaign.

459
00:39:07,934 --> 00:39:11,976
because you would just walk in is very enticing, I think, to find somebody.

460
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,136
So I think that's why it's there.

461
00:39:14,677 --> 00:39:19,539
And to me, it kind of makes sense because if you start appointing people, it's not good.

462
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:29,743
I would rather see an absentee slot than have somebody who's been appointed that doesn't represent or doesn't live in the ward, in my opinion.

463
00:39:30,303 --> 00:39:30,563
Yeah.

464
00:39:32,984 --> 00:39:35,305
No, I think it should be a person from the ward myself.

465
00:39:36,325 --> 00:39:36,866
Absolutely.

466
00:39:36,886 --> 00:39:37,586
Yeah.

467
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:45,504
Okay, and so then you're left with the potential of a school committee which has an even number of people.

468
00:39:47,146 --> 00:39:48,247
Well, you don't actually.

469
00:39:48,267 --> 00:39:55,814
You have a school committee that would assemble as if a seven-member committee would with one person not able to come, not attending.

470
00:39:56,795 --> 00:39:57,115
Right.

471
00:39:57,215 --> 00:39:58,096
It'd be a position.

472
00:39:58,116 --> 00:40:00,038
Is there a tiebreaker vote?

473
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:01,119
Right.

474
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:02,160
That there is a VP?

475
00:40:03,061 --> 00:40:03,201
Yeah.

476
00:40:04,366 --> 00:40:21,328
Yeah, well, the chairperson has the tiebreaker vote, but in any case, Paulette, you would know in a case where two members are, you know, on vacation, not attending the meeting, as long as you have the quorum, the mayor would be in charge of being the final vote.

477
00:40:21,908 --> 00:40:22,930
If there were six people,

478
00:40:23,372 --> 00:40:24,853
No, no, no, no, you're wrong.

479
00:40:25,153 --> 00:40:37,339
The mayor is a vote equal to, so if there's a, so now we're talking about eight members and someone leaves, so now there's seven members and the mayor.

480
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,681
So your vote could easily be four to four.

481
00:40:40,701 --> 00:40:46,824
Now, the way that it goes in terms of Robert rules for order, if it's four to four, it loses, it doesn't pass.

482
00:40:47,485 --> 00:40:49,846
Right, unless you open it for reconsideration.

483
00:40:50,527 --> 00:40:52,668
Right, so that's just the way it would be.

484
00:40:53,309 --> 00:40:57,751
Okay, so that's scenario one, where we have eight wards, okay?

485
00:40:58,472 --> 00:41:08,738
Scenario two was that we had four wards and two school committee members at large.

486
00:41:09,498 --> 00:41:16,503
Now, next week, am I presenting the eight wards or am I presenting the four wards?

487
00:41:16,703 --> 00:41:18,524
I thought we agreed to the four wards.

488
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:20,825
the four wards plus two.

489
00:41:21,466 --> 00:41:38,601
Yeah, but you bring up an excellent point here, Paula, that makes me think that if a ward, if you're living in a ward and you run for at-large, and all of a sudden that ward becomes empty, would you have the ability to move from your at-large position to the ward position?

490
00:41:40,903 --> 00:41:42,104
Oh, that's a good question.

491
00:41:44,466 --> 00:41:45,447
Conceivably, you could.

492
00:41:46,911 --> 00:41:53,754
I think we should cover that, because then you'd have an open at-large position, which would gather a lot more candidates.

493
00:41:55,115 --> 00:41:55,235
Okay.

494
00:41:55,255 --> 00:41:55,415
Right.

495
00:41:56,395 --> 00:41:56,835
Interesting.

496
00:41:57,616 --> 00:42:00,797
But maybe if someone doesn't want to give up their at-large position.

497
00:42:00,997 --> 00:42:03,938
Well, you wouldn't have to be forced to do it, but it could be an option.

498
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:04,719
Okay.

499
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:11,241
Or could it be that if there's nobody in that, so I ran for Ward 7, lost.

500
00:42:12,082 --> 00:42:12,302
Right.

501
00:42:13,668 --> 00:42:15,529
Or I ran out large lost.

502
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:17,130
Somebody stepped down and word 7.

503
00:42:17,311 --> 00:42:20,753
I'm eligible to step into that word 7 slot.

504
00:42:20,773 --> 00:42:21,413
Interesting.

505
00:42:21,433 --> 00:42:23,194
Yeah, I would think yes to that.

506
00:42:23,795 --> 00:42:27,697
Yeah, it's very complicated.

507
00:42:28,538 --> 00:42:32,981
If we're proposing that the recommendation of this committee is.

508
00:42:33,001 --> 00:42:36,884
The 4 words, um.

509
00:42:38,525 --> 00:42:38,725
Then.

510
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:44,134
Do we have to figure out how we're defining where those wards are?

511
00:42:45,154 --> 00:42:47,035
If that's something we're proposing to the larger group?

512
00:42:48,095 --> 00:42:49,836
Yes, but not as part of the charter, I think.

513
00:42:50,016 --> 00:42:51,257
It would be a separate commission.

514
00:42:51,757 --> 00:42:52,637
Yeah, it wouldn't be us.

515
00:42:52,697 --> 00:43:00,780
It would be the clerks, the election commission would have to determine, does they have rules and guidelines from the Secretary of State to establish that?

516
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,300
Yeah, they do.

517
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:02,460
OK.

518
00:43:02,961 --> 00:43:09,323
So guys, I think that I actually thought that we were presenting both next week, the eight and the four.

519
00:43:10,479 --> 00:43:15,481
I thought what we were doing, you're right, Paulette, but we were also recommending the four.

520
00:43:15,941 --> 00:43:17,141
That's what I thought we did.

521
00:43:17,221 --> 00:43:17,962
Okay.

522
00:43:18,082 --> 00:43:29,506
In terms of thinking about that succession for the four, and Aubrey brought up a great point, I think that that is wordsmithing that I could work on this week.

523
00:43:29,626 --> 00:43:35,247
I can send it out to you guys, unless you think we can do it right now.

524
00:43:36,828 --> 00:43:38,749
I think you have the concept, putting it in words.

525
00:43:39,999 --> 00:43:45,560
Yeah, I just think it's wordsmithing for replacement.

526
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:54,762
Yeah, and it would only be effective for the four double up ward reps that would matter.

527
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,122
If you have eight, you can't do it.

528
00:43:56,662 --> 00:43:59,543
Yeah, I understand where everybody's going.

529
00:44:00,123 --> 00:44:01,363
Okay, fair enough.

530
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:01,803
Yeah.

531
00:44:01,823 --> 00:44:01,903
Okay.

532
00:44:02,283 --> 00:44:03,704
All right, that was good.

533
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:05,864
All right, now,

534
00:44:07,475 --> 00:44:08,736
That's filling a vacancy.

535
00:44:08,816 --> 00:44:12,359
Okay, Aubrey, now we need to go back to 4-5, which was the powers and whatever.

536
00:44:23,082 --> 00:44:28,143
Aubrey put together some language to combine the two.

537
00:44:28,263 --> 00:44:43,748
The document that I had provided, which was largely taken from the school committee policy handbook and some wording from the separate towns.

538
00:44:46,549 --> 00:44:47,509
I looked that over.

539
00:45:05,508 --> 00:45:19,536
There was one sentence, Aubrey, that you left out on the first part that I wanted to tell you is really critical to include.

540
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:31,944
And that sentence is, if you were to go back to what I provided, which was on the top,

541
00:45:34,678 --> 00:45:46,609
It says, a voting majority of the school committee shall exercise the following powers and perform the following duties, and no individual member is empowered to act unless by the vote of the school committee.

542
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:58,620
I truly believe that we should be including that sentence because- Can you just take me back from the beginning?

543
00:46:00,201 --> 00:46:03,587
I'm lost as to what, maybe I need to see the verbiage.

544
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:08,377
Okay, so yeah, Aubrey, it was there on the first page.

545
00:46:12,661 --> 00:46:14,323
Well, you just had it on top.

546
00:46:14,423 --> 00:46:30,240
If you go after 5 and to the next paragraph, which says, a voting majority of the school committee shall exercise the following powers and perform the following duties, and no individual is empowered to act unless by a vote of the school committee.

547
00:46:32,758 --> 00:46:37,081
Aubrey simplified it to the powers and the duties of the school committee shall include.

548
00:46:37,441 --> 00:46:39,663
And I totally understand why she did that.

549
00:46:40,263 --> 00:46:54,733
But the reason why it's so important to say that sentence is because it's very important for the members of the school committee to understand that one of them alone is one of them alone and doesn't count.

550
00:46:55,833 --> 00:47:00,837
It only counts when you are a member of the body and there's a majority.

551
00:47:02,745 --> 00:47:21,211
And so I think that that sentence is an extreme, you know, no individual member is empowered to act, is a very important reminder to the members of the school committee that they only act as a body, not as an individual.

552
00:47:21,767 --> 00:47:37,573
Paula, can you give me a hypothetical example of when that would happen, that one member would be able to do something, have the power to do something that they shouldn't do or should have approval for?

553
00:47:45,356 --> 00:47:49,258
What a member going out and making a statement to the public

554
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:52,398
That's misleading.

555
00:47:54,540 --> 00:48:07,347
Okay.

556
00:48:07,488 --> 00:48:10,990
I guess, Ron, you're probably thinking, well, it's understood.

557
00:48:12,044 --> 00:48:17,385
Well, no, I'm thinking that you have experienced this, that it's important to you as a school committee person.

558
00:48:17,725 --> 00:48:20,526
And I would follow whatever you advise.

559
00:48:20,646 --> 00:48:34,850
My question is, are we setting limitations that if I'm being called by a parent as a school committee person and they say, well, it looks like they're doing this or that, am I allowed to give my personal opinion?

560
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:41,833
So yes, let's suppose someone calls and they're upset about a certain thing happening.

561
00:48:41,853 --> 00:48:50,677
You can certainly talk to the parent and give your personal opinion, but you can't say, I'm going to make this happen.

562
00:48:52,198 --> 00:48:52,398
Yeah.

563
00:48:53,298 --> 00:48:53,659
Okay.

564
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:58,541
So they've got a complaint about their kid not being put into the game.

565
00:48:58,561 --> 00:48:59,541
Yeah.

566
00:49:00,162 --> 00:49:00,502
Okay.

567
00:49:00,822 --> 00:49:01,902
It's not appropriate.

568
00:49:04,397 --> 00:49:18,259
But beyond conversation, is it possible in the current, without the statement being there, for a school committee member to call, for your example, call the head coach of Memphis High School Baseball and say he's playing today?

569
00:49:20,436 --> 00:49:23,897
It's hypothetical completely, but is that what you're saying?

570
00:49:23,957 --> 00:49:24,757
They take action.

571
00:49:24,797 --> 00:49:29,758
It's not like if somebody calls me and says, I'm going to fix that, or I'm going to try to fix that.

572
00:49:29,898 --> 00:49:35,280
Is that, or is somebody like saying, I'm going to call Mr. X and say, you know.

573
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,740
As a member of the school committee, I shouldn't be calling any coach at all.

574
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:42,701
I should be going to the superintendent and saying, I have an issue.

575
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:47,783
And the issue, and the superintendent should be resolving it from her point of view, not

576
00:49:49,963 --> 00:49:55,725
not from an individual member.

577
00:49:56,325 --> 00:49:56,505
Yeah.

578
00:49:56,705 --> 00:49:59,346
So that's why you want the verbiage in here is what my point is.

579
00:49:59,446 --> 00:49:59,766
Got it.

580
00:50:00,007 --> 00:50:00,587
I support it.

581
00:50:01,647 --> 00:50:05,068
I support it and added it as an example here.

582
00:50:05,108 --> 00:50:10,690
I think that it's also bounded because of the way it's written by the duties below.

583
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:15,672
So it's not that you can't do anything ever, it's that you can't remove a superintendent on your own.

584
00:50:16,192 --> 00:50:18,453
You can't make reasonable rules and make them,

585
00:50:19,656 --> 00:50:20,477
Yeah.

586
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:24,059
Does it say something about speaking on behalf of the entire school committee?

587
00:50:27,341 --> 00:50:27,621
No.

588
00:50:28,222 --> 00:50:28,782
It doesn't.

589
00:50:28,802 --> 00:50:32,264
But I think that's part of it.

590
00:50:32,304 --> 00:50:33,265
Speaking is an act.

591
00:50:34,146 --> 00:50:34,366
Yeah.

592
00:50:34,846 --> 00:50:36,447
OK.

593
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:47,834
I think then under A, on the next paragraph, you should put selection, evaluation, and removal of a superintendent of the school's

594
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:53,200
Who shall be charged with the admission, the administration of the school system?

595
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:57,143
I want the word evaluation should be put in there.

596
00:51:05,227 --> 00:51:05,567
Okay.

597
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:07,148
Fair enough.

598
00:51:08,349 --> 00:51:08,729
And then.

599
00:51:12,047 --> 00:51:19,629
The next, there was one other sentence which I would, on the next page, Aubrey.

600
00:51:19,989 --> 00:51:22,130
Aubrey, can you make it a bit bigger, please?

601
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:35,633
Thanks.

602
00:51:37,274 --> 00:51:40,335
Okay, so on number, so it's C.

603
00:51:41,851 --> 00:51:55,415
And then subset B, unless a central municipal maintenance department, which may include maintenance of school building and grounds is established.

604
00:51:56,135 --> 00:52:02,297
I think that clause, unless a central municipal maintenance department, it should be taken out.

605
00:52:15,793 --> 00:52:32,979
And we could then add potentially augmented by city services or augmented by the city.

606
00:52:47,461 --> 00:52:49,842
I have to, I'm just trying to work out the sentence.

607
00:52:49,862 --> 00:53:10,209
What I was saying was, and let's see, shall provide ordinary maintenance of all school buildings and grounds, potentially augmented by city services, such as, but not limited to, snow plowing and trash removal.

608
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:34,683
Um, Okay.

609
00:53:36,362 --> 00:53:38,803
Can I just wordsmith this quickly?

610
00:53:38,903 --> 00:53:40,043
Yeah, absolutely.

611
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:53,569
Where it says that the school committee shall provide, I think it should say the school committee shall provide policies and procedures for ordinary maintenance because they're not grabbing brushes and brooms and doing it themselves.

612
00:53:53,629 --> 00:53:54,549
Right, absolutely.

613
00:54:07,269 --> 00:54:07,509
Okay.

614
00:54:11,433 --> 00:54:16,017
It's provide policies and procedures for ordinary maintenance.

615
00:54:17,298 --> 00:54:17,438
Yeah.

616
00:54:17,538 --> 00:54:27,326
And I think there's probably another sentence that needs to be, I think it needs to, I'm not sure it still reads as clearly as it should, but right now it's up there.

617
00:54:27,346 --> 00:54:31,129
It takes out, you know,

618
00:54:32,692 --> 00:54:38,577
There's a theoretical sentence in there which I'm taking out, and I'm putting in what we do.

619
00:54:39,477 --> 00:54:43,801
And while for many it doesn't make any difference, it does make a difference.

620
00:54:44,761 --> 00:54:56,991
I'm not trying to suggest, I don't want our charter to suggest that all of a sudden we're going to have a combined city services, and there's reasons, very clear reasons not to do that.

621
00:54:58,892 --> 00:55:07,534
At the same time, there's clearly cooperation between the city in providing resources, sorts of services.

622
00:55:07,614 --> 00:55:11,914
So anyway, sorry.

623
00:55:11,954 --> 00:55:12,955
That sounds good.

624
00:55:12,995 --> 00:55:16,515
Can I go up and just look at the original model language where this came from?

625
00:55:19,456 --> 00:55:19,796
Sure.

626
00:55:20,456 --> 00:55:20,696
Hey, Bob.

627
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:51,575
Paulette, is this the time where we put in that the school committee can make recommendation on names of school changes, but it's done by ordinance of the city council?

628
00:55:51,735 --> 00:55:52,676
Is that where we put this in?

629
00:55:56,151 --> 00:56:00,036
That power has always been in the school committee hands, not the council hands.

630
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:02,699
I certainly understand.

631
00:56:02,739 --> 00:56:06,404
That's why we have Mississippi Tech School.

632
00:56:06,584 --> 00:56:09,128
We have Columbus Park at Mississippi Tech School.

633
00:56:13,533 --> 00:56:14,655
OK, over there, Paulette.

634
00:56:15,344 --> 00:56:17,466
Yeah, no, actually, I got a leg cramp.

635
00:56:17,746 --> 00:56:21,009
That's why I was grabbing my leg in agony down here.

636
00:56:21,269 --> 00:56:25,112
No, you can always shut your camera off and take a walk and talk at the same time.

637
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:25,172
OK.

638
00:56:25,192 --> 00:56:27,554
I just thought it was Ron's jerk.

639
00:56:28,555 --> 00:56:29,115
What?

640
00:56:30,797 --> 00:56:32,698
Yeah, so I probably should go get some water.

641
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,700
But we're not that far.

642
00:56:36,361 --> 00:56:42,466
So all the other changes that Aubrey did provided, I thought were just fine.

643
00:56:42,486 --> 00:56:43,147
Yeah.

644
00:56:44,329 --> 00:56:45,951
I think you ladies are doing a great job.

645
00:56:46,011 --> 00:56:47,353
I'm just putting that right out there.

646
00:56:47,793 --> 00:56:47,973
Yeah.

647
00:56:48,214 --> 00:56:51,137
So everything else Aubrey that you did was terrific.

648
00:56:51,217 --> 00:56:51,477
I know.

649
00:56:51,578 --> 00:56:56,563
And I'm being nitty gritty on a couple of things just from my experience.

650
00:56:56,644 --> 00:56:59,247
But otherwise, that all made sense to me.

651
00:57:01,493 --> 00:57:27,779
And so the happy news then is if people are in general agreement, and I still know there's a little bit of cleanup, but we're far enough along now that I can then take whatever, and we can put together in the beginning, we will have, you know, we can still provide the, we can do the four, I can write it with the four, and then I can write it just in case, have it back up as a presentation if people, you know, don't wanna do the four and two.

652
00:57:30,595 --> 00:57:39,840
But I'll write everything as if we're doing it the four and two, and everything else that we decided on last time around.

653
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:43,161
I think that then we bring it to the committee.

654
00:57:43,181 --> 00:57:53,966
I think that there's likely to be changes because I think that we always want to be in step on these issues with the city council, so the compensation.

655
00:57:54,027 --> 00:57:56,668
There's still some questions around how that's going to work out.

656
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:17,576
But everything else, and Ron, I did notice our next order of business having gone through this piece is we've held this long is the regarding community participation at school committee meetings.

657
00:58:18,391 --> 00:58:26,817
And I saw in the notes from the last meeting last Thursday that you suggested there should be a subcommittee to discuss this overall.

658
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:27,137
I did.

659
00:58:27,498 --> 00:58:29,579
It's actually on the April 18th agenda.

660
00:58:32,423 --> 00:58:38,505
And to me, you know, I just think if you have public participation, for one, you should offer it across the board.

661
00:58:38,585 --> 00:58:43,586
So whatever we decide in terms of, and believe me, school committee I understand is different.

662
00:58:43,706 --> 00:58:52,908
However, there's got to be a mechanism for people to find things to put on the agenda, ability to discuss in some kind of rules and guide.

663
00:58:52,948 --> 00:58:54,649
So it's on the agenda for the 18th.

664
00:58:54,729 --> 00:58:55,209
So I don't know.

665
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:56,906
Right.

666
00:58:56,946 --> 00:59:15,389
So I think that that's, you know, right now, the funny enough thing is that the wording of the two is not very different because I looked at the city council, I sent it out to you several months ago and said, you know, the thing is, because Eunice was saying, but it works different at the city council.

667
00:59:15,949 --> 00:59:17,710
And I was sort of saying it does.

668
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:19,870
But frankly, if you look at the wording, the wording is the same.

669
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:21,490
And so it's how it's being enacted.

670
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:25,451
Although, of course, now in the months in between, people may have different opinions.

671
00:59:27,294 --> 00:59:43,559
So when we now make, so right now, I think on item number three on our agenda, discussion regarding community participation, I think that we're gonna put that into the larger discussion.

672
00:59:44,659 --> 00:59:45,859
Does that make sense to everybody?

673
00:59:45,879 --> 00:59:47,020
It does.

674
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,580
Yeah, absolutely.

675
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:54,482
Okay, so on the 18th now, we've promised to make a,

676
00:59:57,449 --> 01:00:07,214
a presentation, so I will go back through the work we did this week, and the work we did this, and make one document.

677
01:00:08,175 --> 01:00:15,259
And then, Aubrey, I'm going to send it to you, and you're going to post and do something so we can post it, okay?

678
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:17,820
You're going to do something and put it somewhere.

679
01:00:18,541 --> 01:00:20,262
Right, I will try and do it early enough.

680
01:00:20,302 --> 01:00:24,524
I will tell you right now, I do have an emergency in my family, and I'm a little nervous about it.

681
01:00:28,005 --> 01:00:29,687
Anyway, big emergency.

682
01:00:29,747 --> 01:00:36,072
So I will try and get to this and put it up and send it to you guys just so you can read it through collectively.

683
01:00:36,632 --> 01:00:43,118
Now, I did want to ask you whether you think

684
01:00:44,264 --> 01:00:50,449
We need to go back and post that whole, remember we made that whole chart about pros and cons and whatever.

685
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:58,676
Do we need to bring that to the committee or do we need to say we went through all these options and this is what we think is best?

686
01:01:01,499 --> 01:01:05,102
I like the second option and we can make, because it's been on Google Drive.

687
01:01:06,223 --> 01:01:06,443
Yeah.

688
01:01:06,643 --> 01:01:07,804
That can be available.

689
01:01:07,824 --> 01:01:11,688
I mean, I'm not necessarily trying to open up the debate.

690
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:13,551
Right.

691
01:01:13,611 --> 01:01:14,992
Everything all over again.

692
01:01:15,012 --> 01:01:18,255
And if we bring that list, we could be opening up the debate.

693
01:01:18,696 --> 01:01:25,362
I think that there is still we're leaving a little leeway for the one from each ward for whatever.

694
01:01:27,802 --> 01:01:47,088
Well I think that's going to be the the most challenging part of what we're presenting is the folks will have opinions on that and I agree I don't think you should put up a pros and cons because we've certainly have all done our homework in terms of what the other options are so when people are asking questions we'll be able to

695
01:01:49,229 --> 01:01:52,373
Everybody here is capable of presenting how we got to that point.

696
01:01:52,534 --> 01:01:53,835
So I'm with you.

697
01:01:54,196 --> 01:02:04,811
I think we should, what Aubrey said is present what we like and explain it as much as they need explanation to, but hopefully they would understand it.

698
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:08,592
I think we just have it in our back pocket in case we need some sort of backup.

699
01:02:09,853 --> 01:02:13,635
But no sense opening the can of worms.

700
01:02:14,136 --> 01:02:20,740
If there's a big debate about it, it's good to have the documentation that we've put together.

701
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:26,964
But I think we can state our case without it.

702
01:02:26,984 --> 01:02:30,246
If folks have questions, we can refer to it.

703
01:02:31,327 --> 01:02:31,487
Yeah.

704
01:02:32,686 --> 01:02:50,259
Okay, so I think then that what we're doing is we're presenting this section of the charter, the section 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, and 4.6, as we worked out to the committee of the whole.

705
01:02:52,881 --> 01:03:01,287
And my job will be to send it to you in the next two or three days, and then so we can send it out to the whole committee

706
01:03:02,295 --> 01:03:02,757
by Monday.

707
01:03:08,835 --> 01:03:14,238
The sending to everybody I get, we are not allowed to discuss.

708
01:03:14,638 --> 01:03:19,980
The only thing we're allowed to discuss once it's out there is we can change punctuation.

709
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:21,961
We can change grammar.

710
01:03:22,682 --> 01:03:26,523
We can't discuss, oh, I want to go back to eight ward reps.

711
01:03:26,643 --> 01:03:27,084
We can't.

712
01:03:27,244 --> 01:03:28,304
Nobody is allowed to.

713
01:03:29,225 --> 01:03:34,167
You're not allowed to have a discussion through email at all.

714
01:03:34,207 --> 01:03:37,669
Do you think, I mean, should I send it out to the whole?

715
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:37,989
I wouldn't.

716
01:03:38,687 --> 01:03:39,768
I wouldn't for that reason.

717
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:40,709
Oh, okay.

718
01:03:40,749 --> 01:03:43,772
So you would just send it out to you guys for review purposes?

719
01:03:44,352 --> 01:03:46,674
To make sure it's nice and neat for our presentation.

720
01:03:46,694 --> 01:03:49,477
We only have 30 minutes on the agenda.

721
01:03:49,537 --> 01:03:51,158
So my opinion is

722
01:03:52,843 --> 01:04:02,314
I don't like the fact that they would get to read it without hearing or being able to ask questions right away and form opinions on things without having us there to guide them.

723
01:04:02,394 --> 01:04:12,665
So I would say that we should all see it to make sure the presentation looks what we want it to be, but we can't change what the, you know, the,

724
01:04:14,385 --> 01:04:19,788
the meat of what is in there, and I would keep it from the group until we meet on the 18th.

725
01:04:21,448 --> 01:04:25,290
I think with the city council, I remember we had two sessions.

726
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:28,011
So one was we talked through it, and then the next one we voted.

727
01:04:28,592 --> 01:04:28,932
Right.

728
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:30,332
That's possible, too.

729
01:04:30,453 --> 01:04:31,873
Yeah, that's possible.

730
01:04:32,233 --> 01:04:41,298
So the only thing I want to be really clear on, when I write this up, am I writing it up as four wards and two at large?

731
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:42,298
Correct.

732
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:43,161
Yes.

733
01:04:43,721 --> 01:04:46,842
Do I give them the eight ward potential at all?

734
01:04:47,722 --> 01:04:49,762
No, I think we would have it.

735
01:04:50,022 --> 01:04:50,642
I just don't.

736
01:04:51,002 --> 01:04:54,583
I think our presentation should be that.

737
01:04:54,603 --> 01:05:01,604
And that's the biggest part of the presentation is the decision to go from eight wards down to four double wards.

738
01:05:02,324 --> 01:05:03,184
I think that's a big.

739
01:05:04,345 --> 01:05:07,525
And in that presentation, you're going to have that option.

740
01:05:08,285 --> 01:05:11,566
We looked at the eight wards and decided instead to go to a

741
01:05:12,908 --> 01:05:14,489
So they'll have that option.

742
01:05:15,069 --> 01:05:20,431
I will probably have paragraphs separately, depending on the discussion that we can reel out or not.

743
01:05:20,771 --> 01:05:23,593
But we'll start our discussion with the four awards.

744
01:05:23,953 --> 01:05:24,853
Yeah.

745
01:05:25,893 --> 01:05:26,834
OK?

746
01:05:27,314 --> 01:05:31,516
And I know this is, oh, the next thing is community participation.

747
01:05:31,876 --> 01:05:33,837
Do we have any community participation?

748
01:05:33,857 --> 01:05:35,698
I don't see anybody here.

749
01:05:36,158 --> 01:05:37,438
I don't see anything, any.

750
01:05:37,598 --> 01:05:39,959
So can you believe it?

751
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,460
We're going to end our meeting.

752
01:05:41,801 --> 01:05:42,788
This was a great meeting.

753
01:05:42,808 --> 01:05:44,581
I thought we really did a lot of damage.

754
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:56,342
I think what we've come up with is, I mean, there was nothing in the charter about school committee charter to begin with.

755
01:05:56,882 --> 01:06:01,823
So anything that we came up with was better than what we had.

756
01:06:01,843 --> 01:06:14,665
But the fact that we came up with all that we did over the course of five or six or four or five meetings, however it was, and I think what we've got,

757
01:06:15,405 --> 01:06:36,236
In comparison to the three charters that we were provided by the Collins Center, and I know some others that I've looked at, and maybe many others of us have also looked at, I think ours is, particularly in the powers and duties part, is leaps and bounds better.

758
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:38,358
And that is,

759
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:48,087
We've been fortunate through the whole process to have Paulette here, who has given us so much.

760
01:06:48,187 --> 01:06:56,235
And Phyllis, as an educator as well, you've been able to chime in in a few places that have been very advantageous as well.

761
01:06:58,137 --> 01:07:03,241
to have Paulette's experience for her many years on the school committee.

762
01:07:03,261 --> 01:07:14,448
As you said, last meeting, it's pretty clear that whoever wrote the samples that we got, nobody had ever served on a school committee.

763
01:07:14,568 --> 01:07:16,429
So we've got a hell of a lot more than

764
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:21,412
Any of the other charters that we've had to look at.

765
01:07:21,452 --> 01:07:25,813
The other thing which I've particularly appreciated this is movement.

766
01:07:26,354 --> 01:07:32,216
I appreciate that some of us disagreed and we moved.

767
01:07:32,756 --> 01:07:36,399
And then in another case, some of us had disagreed and we moved back.

768
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:46,529
And so while it's not, you know, maybe what everybody wanted all the time, that the spirit of compromise and understanding is alive in our subcommittee.

769
01:07:46,569 --> 01:07:49,692
And believe me that in these days, I so appreciate that.

770
01:07:50,512 --> 01:08:02,500
Yeah, one of the things I'd like to say, Paula, too, is that even though we disagreed on things, you know, sometimes when I disagree with someone and I listen back to them, I find out information that I might not have had in this little pea brain of mine.

771
01:08:02,981 --> 01:08:04,382
And it does make a difference.

772
01:08:05,522 --> 01:08:05,843
It does.

773
01:08:05,883 --> 01:08:07,484
That's why I like these discussions.

774
01:08:07,524 --> 01:08:09,205
That's why I think they're so valuable.

775
01:08:10,013 --> 01:08:13,694
I don't have all of the information.

776
01:08:13,814 --> 01:08:18,115
I don't have a lot of back experience that some people might have on these committees.

777
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:22,956
So I'm actually learning a great deal, too, while I'm engaging in these committees.

778
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:27,037
And to me, that's just like, I know it sounds hokey, but it's a win-win for me.

779
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:28,497
Well, that's great.

780
01:08:28,857 --> 01:08:30,977
OK, so it's 741.

781
01:08:31,257 --> 01:08:32,678
It's 19 minutes early.

782
01:08:32,698 --> 01:08:35,618
I don't know what I'm going to do with the rest of my evening.

783
01:08:35,638 --> 01:08:37,759
Oh my god, what will we do?

784
01:08:39,413 --> 01:08:39,694
Go ahead.

785
01:08:39,714 --> 01:08:43,661
Let's create maybe we can create a subcommittee for a 19 minute subcommittee.

786
01:08:44,242 --> 01:08:46,265
I'm definitely going to disagree with you there.

787
01:08:46,286 --> 01:08:48,790
Let's go to bed early.

788
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:49,852
All done.

789
01:08:49,972 --> 01:08:50,273
All right.

790
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:51,615
Take care, everybody.

791
01:08:51,635 --> 01:08:51,996
Thank you.

792
01:08:52,096 --> 01:08:52,998
All right.

793
01:08:53,018 --> 01:08:54,160
See you next week.

794
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:54,581
Good night.
