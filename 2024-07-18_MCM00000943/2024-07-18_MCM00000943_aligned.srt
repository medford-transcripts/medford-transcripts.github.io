1
00:00:00,311 --> 00:00:06,154
So let's start off by accepting the minutes of the previous meeting.

2
00:00:07,854 --> 00:00:12,576
I'm going to motion to accept.

3
00:00:15,697 --> 00:00:19,779
Actually, I think Stacy pointed out a typo in the minutes.

4
00:00:20,419 --> 00:00:21,880
Yeah, the rescheduling part.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,261
It said April 29.

6
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:24,501
Did we reschedule June 17th still?

7
00:00:31,457 --> 00:00:39,300
And June 17 leading to, no, that would be, oh, June, June.

8
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,520
I'm on the wrong date.

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,861
I have the wrong month.

10
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:43,421
Okay.

11
00:00:44,722 --> 00:00:47,142
June 17th moved to the 24th, okay.

12
00:00:48,323 --> 00:00:51,904
Okay, yes, so it's just the, I think I had it.

13
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:59,999
typo in the minutes where I said today's meeting was rescheduled to the 29th, but it's actually today, the 22nd.

14
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:03,500
And will the June 24th meeting be in person?

15
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:12,424
Well, I think that's a good question for you guys, because it didn't seem like in-person worked out for most people today.

16
00:01:12,444 --> 00:01:18,247
Do you want to try that again in June, or do you just want to stick to the Zoom meetings?

17
00:01:24,202 --> 00:01:25,983
I think we could try it in June.

18
00:01:26,023 --> 00:01:27,784
It just didn't work out.

19
00:01:27,984 --> 00:01:30,165
I was originally planning to come in today.

20
00:01:30,205 --> 00:01:31,306
It just didn't work out.

21
00:01:32,046 --> 00:01:34,127
Had some stuff come up last minute.

22
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:38,249
But I'm still to try again.

23
00:01:38,269 --> 00:01:40,451
I'm still open to trying it again.

24
00:01:42,332 --> 00:01:44,493
Especially, you know, everyone's feeling better.

25
00:01:44,513 --> 00:01:45,733
The weather will be better.

26
00:01:48,968 --> 00:01:49,468
Sounds good.

27
00:01:50,209 --> 00:02:03,239
Okay, so I think we can, so I think if someone wants to put out a motion to approve the minutes with the revision of the April 29th meeting is actually today, April 22nd.

28
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:03,980
Yeah.

29
00:02:05,841 --> 00:02:07,682
And June 24th will be in person.

30
00:02:09,244 --> 00:02:11,766
Yes, and June 24th will be in person.

31
00:02:13,487 --> 00:02:13,867
Okay.

32
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:17,250
I second this motion.

33
00:02:18,435 --> 00:02:18,875
Or should I?

34
00:02:18,895 --> 00:02:24,020
I think we need a person to make the motion first and I can't do it.

35
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:37,150
Make the motion to approve of the changes of the meeting being today as opposed to next week and that we will be meeting in person June 24th.

36
00:02:39,472 --> 00:02:39,913
I second.

37
00:02:41,558 --> 00:02:43,039
Okay, everyone.

38
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,502
Everyone is agreeing.

39
00:02:47,222 --> 00:02:52,906
Say, I, I, I okay.

40
00:02:54,468 --> 00:02:55,949
And Liz has a thumbs up.

41
00:02:56,029 --> 00:02:58,411
So, yeah, I think we're all set.

42
00:03:05,058 --> 00:03:18,148
One thing that I wanted to talk about, I know Samia is not here because she works late on Mondays, is should we reschedule these meetings from Mondays to another day of the week?

43
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:25,914
Well, what day works for everybody else?

44
00:03:28,443 --> 00:03:34,146
Monday's good for me, Tuesday's not good for me, Wednesday's not good for me.

45
00:03:36,108 --> 00:03:40,410
So, Thursday, Friday, I could do.

46
00:03:42,211 --> 00:03:46,574
I could potentially- On Friday, everybody is usually available.

47
00:03:48,135 --> 00:03:56,280
I'm not available on Friday at this time, but perhaps Thursday.

48
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:10,134
Well, I think the one who's not here is Samia.

49
00:04:10,674 --> 00:04:17,016
So it might really kind of, I mean, I don't know.

50
00:04:17,816 --> 00:04:22,778
Well, it sounds like Thursday is the only day that would work for everybody else here.

51
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,439
So maybe we could ask Samia.

52
00:04:27,178 --> 00:04:29,599
if Thursdays are better for her than Mondays.

53
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:32,360
And if that's true, we could move it.

54
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:36,341
Yeah.

55
00:04:38,802 --> 00:04:43,283
Could email, send in an email later with the minutes?

56
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,504
Yeah, I can email her with it.

57
00:04:50,005 --> 00:04:52,446
We did hear from Lizette though.

58
00:04:54,726 --> 00:04:56,387
Lizette, what about your schedule?

59
00:05:10,748 --> 00:05:16,072
If you're talking, we can't hear you.

60
00:05:17,453 --> 00:05:19,374
Is she sending a chat to you, Brenda?

61
00:05:21,776 --> 00:05:23,117
No, she did before.

62
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,203
Saying that she wasn't feeling well, but doesn't say it's working, but she's texting me.

63
00:05:32,283 --> 00:05:35,446
So she's available Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

64
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:37,467
So not Thursday.

65
00:05:40,395 --> 00:05:41,055
Oh, okay.

66
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:41,495
Yep.

67
00:05:41,595 --> 00:05:42,396
I just got that too.

68
00:05:43,036 --> 00:05:47,057
Um, so it's a bit tough.

69
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:00,082
Okay.

70
00:06:00,202 --> 00:06:08,865
So maybe, so maybe we should stick to Mondays then and, and Simia can join as her time allows her to.

71
00:06:09,988 --> 00:06:12,009
Sounds like sometimes she can if it's not too busy.

72
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:12,190
Yeah.

73
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:14,331
Yeah.

74
00:06:16,673 --> 00:06:19,014
I guess that's the only option here.

75
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:37,347
OK.

76
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:38,888
I think that's all the administrative.

77
00:06:39,548 --> 00:06:41,310
items then.

78
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:56,662
We have Emma on here from the city's communications team to talk about some of the methods of communication that the city uses and that we can use to get some of our messaging out, too.

79
00:06:56,682 --> 00:07:01,667
I think you guys met with Emma once before to talk about social media.

80
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,631
guys either in person or on Zoom.

81
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:24,662
But yeah, so I am a communication specialist, as you guys probably know, and I do a lot of work for like our website, press releases, social media, newsletters, all that type of stuff.

82
00:07:25,323 --> 00:07:29,747
So I feel like basically, there's kind of three groupings of

83
00:07:30,745 --> 00:07:32,046
ways we can push things out.

84
00:07:32,646 --> 00:07:40,909
I would say the first grouping would be on the city calendar slash website, on social media, and then in the mayor's monthly newsletter.

85
00:07:40,929 --> 00:07:48,013
And I feel like we push out just about every event we get on those three platforms.

86
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:52,595
So feel free to send me everything you have on those.

87
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:59,117
And then the next one I would say, the mayor does like bi-weekly robocalls to the whole city.

88
00:08:01,527 --> 00:08:11,614
And usually we're a little bit more picky with what we include in those, just because we don't want it to get too long, because people will just stop listening, obviously, after the first few minutes of this call.

89
00:08:12,174 --> 00:08:26,984
So usually we keep that to major events or things that are happening in the next one, two, maybe three weeks, if it's something big, just to give everyone a heads up on the very upcoming ones.

90
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:37,546
And then I feel like the last category really of ways we push things out, there might be other small ways, but the last big category would be in press releases.

91
00:08:38,187 --> 00:08:52,076
And I feel like we try to save press releases for like really big events, or like series of events, things we're doing for the first time maybe that are like we've never done before.

92
00:08:52,236 --> 00:08:53,617
So that's kind of like the bigger things.

93
00:08:53,797 --> 00:08:55,678
But yeah, I feel like

94
00:08:57,337 --> 00:09:00,180
like to push out just about everything this team does.

95
00:09:00,521 --> 00:09:04,425
And I work with Sophie a lot, obviously, to create flyers.

96
00:09:05,286 --> 00:09:06,828
She sends me stuff.

97
00:09:06,988 --> 00:09:13,856
But yeah, feel free to send me whatever you guys have that we can always discuss, like what platforms will be best for it.

98
00:09:14,737 --> 00:09:17,720
And I don't know if you guys have my email, but I can put it in the chat.

99
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:30,692
Emma, so the robo calls that you were talking about, are those just calls or are those also texts?

100
00:09:32,713 --> 00:09:34,373
Yeah, they're calls, texts, and emails.

101
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,434
Okay, okay.

102
00:09:37,754 --> 00:09:39,435
And those were every other week?

103
00:09:41,295 --> 00:09:41,835
Every other week.

104
00:09:42,636 --> 00:09:48,497
Okay, great.

105
00:09:48,697 --> 00:09:50,678
And then the mayor's newsletter you said was monthly?

106
00:09:54,473 --> 00:09:58,795
last week of the month, maybe the first week of the next month if I get busy.

107
00:09:59,495 --> 00:10:00,095
Yeah.

108
00:10:00,755 --> 00:10:03,676
Okay.

109
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:10,139
Good to keep in mind in terms of timing of things, the last week of the month.

110
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,999
Oh, interesting.

111
00:10:12,099 --> 00:10:20,742
I think I don't have it turned on so that anybody can direct it.

112
00:10:21,022 --> 00:10:21,803
Emma just sent me,

113
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:27,068
her email address and I'll just put it in the chat for everybody.

114
00:10:27,849 --> 00:10:30,051
Everyone should be able to chat, put things in the chat now.

115
00:10:31,272 --> 00:10:33,934
But it's etwombly at MedfordMA.org.

116
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:44,163
Now, Emma, there's also things like the Mayor's Good News videos, right?

117
00:10:44,263 --> 00:10:46,685
What are those and how often do they come out?

118
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:56,006
Maybe one or two a month, depending on how busy it is.

119
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:01,314
Yeah, I feel like they can do those really anytime.

120
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,934
They're pretty easy to set up.

121
00:11:03,554 --> 00:11:18,379
Either the mayor can talk about an event or a topic alone, or sometimes she likes to have guests come and talk with her, like in her office, and it's just kind of like a casual, informal conversation about whatever the event is or whatever.

122
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,900
Those are usually like a minute or two long, so they're pretty easy to shoot.

123
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,121
You just do one take.

124
00:11:26,681 --> 00:11:28,082
And is there a certain, like,

125
00:11:28,925 --> 00:11:33,548
sort of level of event that those are reserved for?

126
00:11:34,588 --> 00:11:45,555
Like really big high profile things or can they be used for smaller things too?

127
00:11:45,935 --> 00:11:55,740
A bigger item, but really anything that's good news that we want to share with the community would work.

128
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:09,262
Um, and then I think there are things like, I don't know, like welcome kits for new residents.

129
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:10,903
Is that something that you're involved with?

130
00:12:10,923 --> 00:12:24,589
I. Committee, which basically is the city hall staff person for that.

131
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:26,710
I can pass along any information obviously to.

132
00:12:28,971 --> 00:12:30,812
Sorry, I think you're breaking up a little bit there.

133
00:12:30,852 --> 00:12:31,532
Did you say there was a.

134
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,391
A committee that was that does it, but you can pass along information.

135
00:12:37,351 --> 00:12:39,592
The welcoming committee would handle the.

136
00:12:56,775 --> 00:13:00,256
Great, so for the other things here, would you be the main point of contact?

137
00:13:00,856 --> 00:13:01,656
We're getting the word out.

138
00:13:03,638 --> 00:13:10,181
send anything to me and you can feel free to CC Steve, but otherwise I can loop him in.

139
00:13:16,825 --> 00:13:30,952
I mean, I think some other things that we're thinking of in terms of means of outreach for like the Electrify Medford campaign was, you know, putting information out in tax bills.

140
00:13:32,873 --> 00:13:33,033
Like,

141
00:13:34,093 --> 00:13:38,517
water bills, real estate bills, excise tax bills.

142
00:13:38,537 --> 00:13:43,041
I think they reach slightly different audiences, right?

143
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:51,448
So like the real estate bills and stuff would reach the owners of the property and excise tax bills won't get to anyone with a car in the city.

144
00:13:51,468 --> 00:13:59,615
I know that's not strictly a communications team thing, but I think

145
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,551
you could help us to get that information in there, right?

146
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:06,612
Yeah.

147
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:16,275
I feel like whoever the office is that sends out those bills might have final say, but I can definitely help write it and send it along to them.

148
00:14:17,115 --> 00:14:18,075
Great, definitely.

149
00:14:21,456 --> 00:14:28,058
And then I was thinking things like, you know, information at the library or information at schools.

150
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:40,809
Um, for instance, today, the library put up, um, the, their solar, the solar dashboard for the solar panels on the roof of the library.

151
00:14:40,849 --> 00:14:49,331
They put it up on a screen in the, in the library so that the patrons could see like in real time, like what the solar panels were generating.

152
00:14:49,351 --> 00:14:53,272
Um, and so I think that they would be open to having things

153
00:14:55,402 --> 00:14:57,764
you know, put up there for people to see.

154
00:14:57,784 --> 00:15:12,791
And then there are things like, there are like SUFA signs in like a couple of places around the city.

155
00:15:13,591 --> 00:15:21,315
I'm not sure, I think that might actually be something that Alicia Hunt in my department is sort of the primary contact for.

156
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,718
And are you involved in that at all?

157
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:26,599
Not.

158
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:32,143
I actually think that we don't even pay for those signs anymore, but SUFA just never took them away.

159
00:15:32,323 --> 00:15:37,286
So I'm not sure how, like, up to date the information is on them.

160
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:40,468
But yeah, I'm not involved.

161
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:44,791
I think Alicia might still be paying for them out of our office's budget.

162
00:15:44,831 --> 00:15:46,212
I'm not sure how that happened.

163
00:15:46,332 --> 00:15:49,334
But okay, so she might be the contact there.

164
00:15:49,934 --> 00:15:51,015
And then in terms of like,

165
00:15:51,695 --> 00:15:53,715
the schools.

166
00:15:54,176 --> 00:15:57,216
I don't have a really good contact right now for communications with them.

167
00:15:57,236 --> 00:16:01,477
Emma, do you have any contacts there?

168
00:16:01,497 --> 00:16:06,518
Their comms person is, name is Thomas Dalton.

169
00:16:07,138 --> 00:16:09,419
I can find his email too.

170
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:11,379
But yeah, he would be the contact for that.

171
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,641
What about, what about utilizing Medford Access?

172
00:16:18,681 --> 00:16:19,801
Is that a school thing?

173
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:20,161
Or is that

174
00:16:20,788 --> 00:16:23,869
City thing or separate?

175
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:25,190
The public access team?

176
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,130
Yeah.

177
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,711
I think that's a city thing.

178
00:16:27,751 --> 00:16:30,732
And I think they're actually on right now recording this meeting.

179
00:16:30,752 --> 00:16:41,237
And all of these meetings are, if we tell them ahead of time, and they have the time for it or whatever, it's posted live.

180
00:16:41,257 --> 00:16:43,418
It's live streamed.

181
00:16:43,998 --> 00:16:46,859
Or they'll put the recordings that we make up

182
00:16:47,608 --> 00:16:48,269
after the fact.

183
00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:55,034
Okay, because I know once upon a time they used to have like slides and stuff of events or whatever were going on.

184
00:16:55,074 --> 00:17:03,281
So that might be another place for some of the go green information could be.

185
00:17:03,581 --> 00:17:06,884
Yeah.

186
00:17:06,964 --> 00:17:09,206
Kevin Harrington is the contact there.

187
00:17:09,226 --> 00:17:14,911
And yeah, if you if you want to reach out to him ever, then

188
00:17:15,878 --> 00:17:18,700
I can get the contact information.

189
00:17:28,706 --> 00:17:29,786
Great.

190
00:17:30,127 --> 00:17:40,213
Emma, how much advance notice do you need to get this information into any of these channels?

191
00:17:44,853 --> 00:17:45,553
Not too much.

192
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:52,595
I would say we usually start to push out events maybe at the latest like two weeks before they happen.

193
00:17:52,695 --> 00:17:55,356
So I would say at least a two week warning.

194
00:17:55,376 --> 00:18:01,838
It's not bad.

195
00:18:02,338 --> 00:18:03,239
Good to keep in mind.

196
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:13,042
Just out of curiosity, what is like the process of like

197
00:18:14,688 --> 00:18:19,970
I guess, advertising or marketing events that are happening in the city.

198
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:32,453
And what do you think is the most effective way to reach Medford residents and alert them about these events happening?

199
00:18:34,534 --> 00:18:39,376
Yeah, it's tough because there's no one spot that everyone gets their news from.

200
00:18:39,456 --> 00:18:42,296
So you kind of have to hit it from a few different channels.

201
00:18:45,097 --> 00:18:48,178
So yeah, for events, we'll obviously put it on the city calendar.

202
00:18:48,198 --> 00:18:52,738
And then I think one of the best ways is to do social media posts.

203
00:18:52,778 --> 00:18:54,079
So we'll do a few of those.

204
00:18:54,099 --> 00:19:01,820
But also I think posting it in public places like at the library or maybe at the senior center, depending on the event.

205
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:12,942
Yeah, including it in the newsletters and the robocalls, just so we can try to hit people in just about any way that they get their news.

206
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:22,886
And do you ever do, like, I guess, like, when people are driving through, let's say, Medford Square, do you ever do, like, those, like, big banners?

207
00:19:24,127 --> 00:19:26,368
Or is that for only for, like, select events?

208
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:37,252
Yeah, I would say it's for, like, the really large city events that go on.

209
00:19:40,308 --> 00:19:46,792
I'm not sure how they decide which ones to put up, but yeah, I would say the big events like run Medford or.

210
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:50,675
I don't know, maybe, like, the winter festival or something like that.

211
00:19:50,695 --> 00:19:52,116
Annual kind of.

212
00:19:52,136 --> 00:19:53,276
Yeah, now, what about.

213
00:20:00,052 --> 00:20:01,694
What about the patch?

214
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:11,308
Because I know sometimes every now and again, you know, you might see, you know, what's happening in Medford or something like that.

215
00:20:11,548 --> 00:20:16,115
And I don't know, is there some sort of connect that we have with the patch?

216
00:20:18,004 --> 00:20:21,948
Yeah, we do have reporters that we send the news to at Patch.

217
00:20:22,108 --> 00:20:24,710
The thing is they don't always pick up the news that we send them.

218
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,132
So that's kind of hit or miss.

219
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:28,674
That's a hit or miss.

220
00:20:28,974 --> 00:20:29,795
Yeah, okay.

221
00:20:29,935 --> 00:20:31,816
Yeah, but we do send news to them.

222
00:20:31,876 --> 00:20:33,858
So when they do run it, it's nice.

223
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:34,919
Yeah.

224
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:42,566
So is the way to do that to do a press release and then it would be automatically sent out to the Patch along with other places?

225
00:20:45,244 --> 00:21:02,308
I don't know that it's a press release, per se, or as opposed to just, you know, sort of an event, what's going on in the city on a weekend or things to do or, you know, something for the children.

226
00:21:02,948 --> 00:21:04,348
What is the patch?

227
00:21:05,588 --> 00:21:10,389
It's the newspaper, you know, I mean, Medford Patch.

228
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,610
Like the local newspaper?

229
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:32,756
yeah online it's you know it's not a i don't think it's a hard copy i always see it online oh i didn't know about that yeah a lot of most cities have have it you know you know there's some local news there

230
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:43,853
There's also some, the Tufts Daily, if you're trying to reach students at all, they have a little, they have a paper.

231
00:21:44,393 --> 00:21:49,378
They just put an article out about the Electrify Medford program.

232
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:50,999
Tufts Daily.

233
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,261
Yeah.

234
00:21:52,401 --> 00:21:59,847
So maybe you've got to get a, got to get on that list so we can see what's happening and Tufts Daily.

235
00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:45,419
Yeah, Emma, any other maybe smaller, not city, official city methods of getting the word out that you would recommend?

236
00:22:45,439 --> 00:22:56,287
I think Hatch might still have a community calendar where people can just submit events on their own if you have an account.

237
00:22:58,729 --> 00:23:02,232
I think there might be other community calendars like that.

238
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,993
We might be able to do Eventbrite posts.

239
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:09,874
I'm not exactly sure, but yeah.

240
00:23:10,855 --> 00:23:12,076
Smaller calendars like that too.

241
00:23:19,422 --> 00:23:25,506
Yeah, I don't know of a lot of other, I don't know of other community calendars like that one.

242
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:32,792
But there are definitely like, you know, Medford Mass Facebook groups and

243
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:40,342
Reddit forums and things like that where it would be another way to reach out to people.

244
00:24:13,302 --> 00:24:15,303
Any other questions for Emma?

245
00:24:15,323 --> 00:24:27,528
And for me?

246
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:39,033
I know that there are some events coming up this month that I've seen in the city events calendar and places like that.

247
00:24:39,113 --> 00:24:41,474
So it sounds like that you're

248
00:24:42,658 --> 00:24:50,562
at least for some of the events that you guys are working on, you're already getting the word out through the official City Channel.

249
00:24:50,582 --> 00:25:07,390
Are we ready to move on?

250
00:25:19,469 --> 00:25:19,969
All right.

251
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:21,691
Thank you so much, Emma, for calling in.

252
00:25:21,711 --> 00:25:23,812
All right.

253
00:25:25,214 --> 00:25:25,874
Thanks, Emma.

254
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:36,343
Okay.

255
00:25:36,423 --> 00:25:40,786
Up next, I see stormwater improvements in South Medford.

256
00:25:41,527 --> 00:25:44,349
An update on this project.

257
00:25:46,475 --> 00:26:04,231
Oh, in talking to the grantor, Owen was basically told that that project would likely not be competitive for the MVP grant because it doesn't include green infrastructure upgrades, because there's no room there with how narrow the streets are.

258
00:26:04,251 --> 00:26:05,372
And so

259
00:26:09,173 --> 00:26:17,300
We were thinking, we were hoping that talking to residents about doing green infrastructure in their backyards would be sufficient, and it doesn't sound like it would be.

260
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:23,565
So he'll likely want to apply to another grant for that project.

261
00:26:23,645 --> 00:26:26,288
It's called the BRIC grant, B-R-I-C.

262
00:26:26,308 --> 00:26:34,615
And the deadline is not this month for that, so I'm sure you'll hear about it as that does get closer.

263
00:26:36,342 --> 00:26:51,410
And he might apply to the MVP grant for a stormwater project at Tufts Park that does have green infrastructure elements, because it does have the space there to be able to add those in.

264
00:26:53,691 --> 00:27:01,936
And I think Tufts Park, because it does serve sort of that same area in South Medford, like everybody around there uses it,

265
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:10,322
I mean, I think it's still a good equity argument to the grantors there.

266
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:28,892
So I think what we'd like to do is sort of use the letter of support that the Climate Equity Council approved for the MVP project at Golden and Bowen Streets to sort of repurpose that for these other two grants.

267
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:34,432
Because it's essentially the same project.

268
00:27:34,492 --> 00:27:44,221
It's trying to reduce flooding in South Medford by improving the stormwater infrastructure there.

269
00:27:45,742 --> 00:27:48,245
Is that something that folks would be comfortable with?

270
00:27:49,966 --> 00:27:53,750
Is having that letter of support repurposed for the other two grants?

271
00:27:56,072 --> 00:27:56,312
Sure.

272
00:27:59,899 --> 00:28:00,620
I would think so.

273
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,180
Okay.

274
00:28:02,141 --> 00:28:04,923
Could we do a vote on that just so that it's official?

275
00:28:04,943 --> 00:28:06,585
Okay.

276
00:28:07,105 --> 00:28:13,350
I motion to approve of the repurposing of the letter of support.

277
00:28:17,213 --> 00:28:17,794
I'll second.

278
00:28:20,396 --> 00:28:20,856
I agree.

279
00:28:22,297 --> 00:28:23,999
Everyone agree?

280
00:28:27,221 --> 00:28:27,762
In favor?

281
00:28:31,017 --> 00:28:31,578
of those.

282
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:35,561
Liz, that gives us a thumbs up.

283
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:37,983
Very good.

284
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:42,026
Great, thanks.

285
00:28:42,807 --> 00:28:54,137
Hopefully, it's so frustrating trying to fight for money for these projects that we know we really need.

286
00:28:54,457 --> 00:28:56,158
So can the letter stand as it is?

287
00:28:58,744 --> 00:29:01,466
Um, I think we would need to, we would need to change the letter.

288
00:29:01,486 --> 00:29:02,147
Okay.

289
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:02,507
Yep.

290
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:03,148
Yeah.

291
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:12,275
Um, cause I think we are specifically referencing both the MVP grant and the Bowen and Golden in there.

292
00:29:12,295 --> 00:29:12,375
Yeah.

293
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:21,743
Sorry.

294
00:29:21,903 --> 00:29:25,266
Sophie is asking for the meeting link.

295
00:29:26,747 --> 00:29:27,828
I'm just sending it to her.

296
00:29:39,607 --> 00:29:51,110
Okay, so um, so I had on the agenda for today, the MVP letter of support for the actually for the Medford connects program.

297
00:29:53,251 --> 00:30:01,233
But I would Sophie told me that that has already been signed as the as the Medford connectors not as officially as the Climate Equity Council.

298
00:30:01,293 --> 00:30:05,134
So we don't need to do anything else for that.

299
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,102
What does MVP stand for, aside from most valuable?

300
00:30:14,382 --> 00:30:16,123
Municipal vulnerability.

301
00:30:19,104 --> 00:30:20,945
God, what is the P part of it?

302
00:30:27,428 --> 00:30:28,249
Preparedness.

303
00:30:28,989 --> 00:30:32,591
Municipal vulnerability preparedness.

304
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:32,891
Yeah.

305
00:30:33,591 --> 00:30:36,773
So it's for climate resilience in particular, really.

306
00:30:40,455 --> 00:30:49,938
And it really mostly goes towards addressing flooding and heat island effects and things like that.

307
00:31:01,041 --> 00:31:07,303
So unless there's any questions about any of that,

308
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:10,092
I think we can move on to the city actions.

309
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:16,557
I think so.

310
00:31:16,657 --> 00:31:16,938
Okay.

311
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:27,847
So for the Electrify Medford program, the energy coaches who can receive stipends are finishing up their paperwork with HR.

312
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:32,031
Um, this week and coach training will start next week.

313
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:38,019
And, um, I'll be sending an invitation out to the coaches about that tomorrow.

314
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:39,602
Yeah.

315
00:31:39,782 --> 00:31:42,245
So we're finally moving forward with that part of it.

316
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:42,846
Yeah.

317
00:31:43,907 --> 00:31:44,107
Yeah.

318
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:46,431
Um,

319
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:52,219
And I'm working with Emma on getting the website and the flyers ready for this.

320
00:31:52,619 --> 00:32:00,625
And once we have draft versions of those, we'll actually lay it out and everything, not just the text of it.

321
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:04,788
We'll share it with the council so that we can get your feedback.

322
00:32:05,009 --> 00:32:05,349
Awesome.

323
00:32:05,569 --> 00:32:09,892
Will it be a separate website, or will it be pages

324
00:32:10,933 --> 00:32:14,355
within the Medford City's website?

325
00:32:14,415 --> 00:32:25,343
So there will be one page within the Medford City site, and then it will point over to the Go Green Medford site, which is like all of our climate efforts have been on a separate site.

326
00:32:25,603 --> 00:32:26,043
Excellent.

327
00:32:26,183 --> 00:32:33,088
Yeah, that Go Green Medford site has, you know, sort of housed our climate efforts for the last 10 plus years.

328
00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:35,169
Oh, so it's all there now.

329
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:36,290
Okay.

330
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,992
It's everything the city does around climate, basically.

331
00:32:39,152 --> 00:32:40,513
So it's all housed there.

332
00:32:40,997 --> 00:32:44,560
Yeah, we don't have the electrified Medford stuff up there yet.

333
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,280
Got it.

334
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:45,661
Yeah.

335
00:32:48,323 --> 00:32:49,964
I think we talked about that.

336
00:32:50,544 --> 00:33:00,032
It's just, I think the city site, we're going to have a lot of information on there about all the different technologies and programs that are available to people.

337
00:33:00,552 --> 00:33:05,776
And I don't, I think the city site isn't great for that much information.

338
00:33:05,856 --> 00:33:06,097
Yeah.

339
00:33:06,357 --> 00:33:06,537
Yeah.

340
00:33:06,967 --> 00:33:23,521
Yeah, I mean, this is very specific and those who are, you know, super duper conscientious about, you know, being green, climate change and such, you know, it's the perfect place for them to hang out.

341
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:31,347
Yeah, I think, and I think the goal is to try to give people as little or as much information as they're looking for.

342
00:33:31,387 --> 00:33:32,228
So if they're just like,

343
00:33:33,335 --> 00:33:37,098
I just want to talk to you and have you tell me which things are just right for me.

344
00:33:37,118 --> 00:33:42,602
And that's like the very simple sort of city site and it goes straight to the form to sign up.

345
00:33:42,922 --> 00:33:51,468
And if they're like, I want to do all my own research and dig around the internet for hours, then they can go to Go Green Medford and go through all the links that we'll have there.

346
00:33:51,709 --> 00:33:52,189
Perfect.

347
00:33:52,469 --> 00:33:52,689
Yeah.

348
00:33:57,053 --> 00:34:00,235
Um, so I think that's it for electrifying Medford right now.

349
00:34:04,354 --> 00:34:13,443
For community electricity aggregation, we renewed our electricity supply contract that expires at the end of this year.

350
00:34:15,104 --> 00:34:18,227
And we increased the additional renewable energy content to 10%.

351
00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:24,614
And it's at a lower cost than people are paying now to the aggregation.

352
00:34:25,826 --> 00:34:26,967
Um, which is really exciting.

353
00:34:27,007 --> 00:34:28,427
We haven't started sharing that yet.

354
00:34:28,827 --> 00:34:32,709
We don't want to confuse people because the changeover doesn't happen until the end of the year.

355
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:36,831
So we'll probably start really publicizing that in September.

356
00:34:36,931 --> 00:34:37,271
Yeah.

357
00:34:37,711 --> 00:34:37,931
Yeah.

358
00:34:38,552 --> 00:34:39,192
That's awesome.

359
00:34:39,492 --> 00:34:39,812
Yeah.

360
00:34:39,832 --> 00:34:41,073
I'm really excited about it.

361
00:34:41,153 --> 00:34:46,975
It will stay, it'll stay at that cost three years.

362
00:34:46,995 --> 00:34:48,316
Wow.

363
00:34:48,356 --> 00:34:48,716
Yeah.

364
00:34:48,816 --> 00:34:51,257
Locking in a pretty low price for the next three years.

365
00:34:51,277 --> 00:34:52,418
Wow.

366
00:34:52,478 --> 00:34:52,678
Yeah.

367
00:34:53,395 --> 00:34:59,777
So it means like it will be lower gas and electric prices?

368
00:35:00,697 --> 00:35:01,717
Just for electricity.

369
00:35:02,237 --> 00:35:03,317
For electricity, okay.

370
00:35:03,938 --> 00:35:04,138
Yeah.

371
00:35:04,678 --> 00:35:05,358
That's very good.

372
00:35:07,478 --> 00:35:12,960
Yeah, that's something we'll definitely be letting people know about through the Electrify Medford program.

373
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,300
Yeah, that's pretty awesome.

374
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,080
Three years.

375
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:24,709
let's see, curbside composting.

376
00:35:25,529 --> 00:35:34,754
We have 112 people who have, you know, newly signed up to join the program, starting, you know, immediately.

377
00:35:34,774 --> 00:35:40,897
And we have another 918 people signed up to start in July.

378
00:35:40,917 --> 00:35:42,517
Yeah, yeah.

379
00:35:44,633 --> 00:35:47,435
I mean, it's a free program, so it's not that hard to sell.

380
00:35:47,775 --> 00:35:48,416
Yeah.

381
00:35:48,516 --> 00:35:57,822
But, you know, sometimes, you know, sometimes just getting people to, you know, open up their laptop or, you know what I mean?

382
00:35:58,002 --> 00:35:59,604
And wow.

383
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:01,665
It's just a huge number.

384
00:36:01,685 --> 00:36:03,827
It just sounds like a very large number.

385
00:36:04,147 --> 00:36:06,569
And we have 900 people in July.

386
00:36:06,889 --> 00:36:08,130
So you get 112 now.

387
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:11,212
And we have nine people who newly signed up for now.

388
00:36:11,232 --> 00:36:11,612
We had 800.

389
00:36:13,726 --> 00:36:17,287
and 40 people who had already signed up before and were paying for it before.

390
00:36:17,307 --> 00:36:17,367
Wow.

391
00:36:18,067 --> 00:36:18,507
Yeah.

392
00:36:20,968 --> 00:36:21,908
Yeah.

393
00:36:21,928 --> 00:36:25,689
So we've got 1,860 people signed up for it now.

394
00:36:25,709 --> 00:36:26,649
That's awesome.

395
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,610
We have room for a lot more though.

396
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:29,870
So we're going to keep getting the word out.

397
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:36,792
And again, it's not, I'm not sure it totally fits into the Electrify Medford program, but I really think of this as kind of a,

398
00:36:38,014 --> 00:36:45,296
A stew of, you know, anything that anybody is looking for, we want to have information for them.

399
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:49,017
And if we don't know, we want to find out and get back to them about it.

400
00:36:49,037 --> 00:37:02,241
And Garbage to Garden, the compost company, they're having a bulk compost and bin distribution event May 18th at City Hall.

401
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:07,689
And I don't think that's something that we've started really getting the word out about yet.

402
00:37:08,129 --> 00:37:17,332
So for new customers, they're going to have bins here for them to pick up, but people can also come by and purchase compost.

403
00:37:18,953 --> 00:37:22,174
And I think anybody can come by and purchase compost from them.

404
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:24,975
It doesn't have to be just people who signed up for the program.

405
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:30,077
So compost in the bins and compost for sale.

406
00:37:30,297 --> 00:37:30,497
Yep.

407
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:31,138
Yep.

408
00:37:31,298 --> 00:37:31,458
May 18th.

409
00:37:36,258 --> 00:37:38,739
Hopefully people are still working on their gardens at that point.

410
00:37:39,699 --> 00:37:41,320
Is it on the events calendar?

411
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,020
Not yet.

412
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:42,920
No, they haven't.

413
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,441
They don't have that up there yet.

414
00:37:49,022 --> 00:37:57,084
I think 10 o'clock, but I'm not going to promise that until it's actually up on the events calendar.

415
00:37:57,124 --> 00:37:57,284
Yeah.

416
00:38:01,985 --> 00:38:08,868
And people can, yeah, just a reminder that people can sign up for the program at medfordcompost.com.

417
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:17,271
And there's an online form for people who want to volunteer to help get the word out.

418
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:19,891
Mothers Out Front has signed up to help.

419
00:38:20,512 --> 00:38:29,615
And so they've been talking with Garbage to Garden about going around and doing door hangers and just talking to people door to door about it.

420
00:38:38,822 --> 00:38:40,803
Free, free, free, free.

421
00:38:41,303 --> 00:38:41,904
Exactly.

422
00:38:42,144 --> 00:38:43,725
That's the important part of it.

423
00:38:43,745 --> 00:38:45,306
Free, free, free, free.

424
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:48,388
And it's not just an introductory offer.

425
00:38:48,448 --> 00:38:50,449
It's going to be free for the life of the program.

426
00:38:50,489 --> 00:38:53,851
Free is always good.

427
00:38:54,051 --> 00:39:02,557
It's always a good start just to get people more interested in what's going on here within the city.

428
00:39:03,037 --> 00:39:07,320
It was interesting when I was working on the Mass Save program, they wouldn't let us use the word free.

429
00:39:08,072 --> 00:39:09,893
Cause they were like, well, technically it's not free.

430
00:39:10,193 --> 00:39:12,194
It's just no cost to you right now.

431
00:39:12,435 --> 00:39:14,436
You're already paying for it on your electric bills.

432
00:39:14,516 --> 00:39:18,998
So yeah.

433
00:39:19,439 --> 00:39:19,719
Yeah.

434
00:39:20,799 --> 00:39:21,280
Yeah.

435
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,821
Better to be safe than sorry.

436
00:39:22,941 --> 00:39:28,204
Cause you know, somebody will turn around and it's really not free.

437
00:39:29,264 --> 00:39:30,925
So let's see what else here.

438
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:50,498
Oh, we applied for a congressionally directed spending request, which is a fancy term for a federal earmark, to help the Medford Housing Authority replace the Willis-Appe Community Center.

439
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:59,742
And the idea is that it will be larger and in better condition with heat pumps and solar panels, too.

440
00:40:01,451 --> 00:40:06,193
so that they can offer more services all year round and then serve as a, yeah.

441
00:40:07,394 --> 00:40:11,576
And serve as like a trusted location for people to go to during emergencies like power outages.

442
00:40:12,236 --> 00:40:16,898
So you've heard this Resilience Hub idea many times before.

443
00:40:16,918 --> 00:40:18,679
So yeah, so that's the idea.

444
00:40:18,699 --> 00:40:24,282
This hopefully will be one of the city's Resilience Hubs or Resilient Community Centers.

445
00:40:24,302 --> 00:40:27,363
That would be really awesome.

446
00:40:28,589 --> 00:40:29,309
Yeah.

447
00:40:29,389 --> 00:40:32,250
And having a bigger space, they'll be able to offer more programs.

448
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:38,611
So right now, they're doing after school and summer programs and food distribution and computer learning.

449
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:48,214
But they'd like to have moving to work and family self-sufficiency programs and enhanced reading programs for kids and daycare and senior programs.

450
00:40:48,314 --> 00:40:51,074
So hopefully, the extra space will let them do that.

451
00:40:51,174 --> 00:40:51,394
Yeah.

452
00:40:51,755 --> 00:40:52,035
Yeah.

453
00:40:54,715 --> 00:40:55,715
That would be awesome.

454
00:40:58,755 --> 00:41:01,936
The timeline for this, it's a really long process.

455
00:41:02,816 --> 00:41:08,377
We'll know this summer if the project would be supported by our congressional delegation.

456
00:41:10,338 --> 00:41:13,919
But we won't be officially awarded the funding until the summer of next year.

457
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:19,680
And then they won't be able to start construction for a little while after that.

458
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,501
So it's a long process, but it's the first step in it.

459
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:29,337
That's a nice first step.

460
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:42,983
We're working on the HVAC upgrades for the Andrews and McGlynn schools.

461
00:41:43,563 --> 00:41:47,585
We're going to be presenting to the school committee on April 29th about

462
00:41:51,631 --> 00:41:58,632
Our plan is to replace the heating and cooling systems at the schools and repair the systems at three other schools.

463
00:42:00,173 --> 00:42:06,914
And we're in the process right now of hiring an owner's project manager and a design engineer to design the systems.

464
00:42:08,594 --> 00:42:12,315
And right now we think that there'll be heat pumps with a condensing boiler backup.

465
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:18,716
So it's partial electrification that will put us in a good place so that at some point in the future,

466
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:23,447
you know, 15 years from now, probably we can we can do full electrification.

467
00:42:25,449 --> 00:42:37,719
And with that, be a part of the idea of I remember we kind of talked about it being a space for emergency space or something like that.

468
00:42:38,399 --> 00:42:40,821
Is this sort of building towards that?

469
00:42:42,323 --> 00:42:44,244
It will help it definitely.

470
00:42:44,264 --> 00:42:49,008
So we're doing the electrical recircuiting work for that we're doing that

471
00:42:49,577 --> 00:43:03,785
This year before June 30th, because that's when our grant we have to for our grant, but that electrical recircuiting will allow us to use it as an emergency shelter right away using the backup generator.

472
00:43:04,005 --> 00:43:04,365
Okay.

473
00:43:04,505 --> 00:43:06,406
Like the diesel generator that's there right now.

474
00:43:06,426 --> 00:43:11,569
So, that's already in once, but that doesn't really do.

475
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:15,909
The HVAC isn't included as part of that right now.

476
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:19,091
It's really more lighting and things like that.

477
00:43:21,533 --> 00:43:27,617
So and, you know, water and yeah, those types of things.

478
00:43:28,258 --> 00:43:31,920
This HVAC project will sort of contribute to that as well.

479
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:32,301
Yeah.

480
00:43:42,227 --> 00:43:46,189
And I don't think that the school committee agenda for the 29th is up yet.

481
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:50,491
So it's possible that we'll be bumped, but I think that's what we're going to be talking to.

482
00:43:53,392 --> 00:43:56,073
On the 29th of April?

483
00:43:56,273 --> 00:43:57,074
Yeah, next week.

484
00:43:58,314 --> 00:44:06,658
Let's see, a couple more things here.

485
00:44:07,797 --> 00:44:14,842
We got an electric street sweeper in January, thanks in part to some grant funding from the Masty EP.

486
00:44:15,062 --> 00:44:17,424
And we're using it during the big sweep that starts today.

487
00:44:17,444 --> 00:44:32,133
And yeah, I've heard some good stuff from one of the operators of it, who was saying that it doesn't leave a snail trail of dirt behind it that he has to turn around and do a second pass for.

488
00:44:32,153 --> 00:44:33,454
So he's excited.

489
00:44:33,514 --> 00:44:36,216
It's like cutting his time down for doing it.

490
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,581
Is it smooth like butter?

491
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:53,112
There have been some issues that they've had to deal with the manufacturer on to get it to be, you know, after it was delivered to get it to be useful.

492
00:44:53,813 --> 00:44:56,134
But I think they're going to be happy with it.

493
00:44:56,155 --> 00:45:02,460
Awesome.

494
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,502
And we're holding another

495
00:45:05,565 --> 00:45:13,469
training on the stretch and specialized energy code for building inspectors at the library on May 1st.

496
00:45:14,209 --> 00:45:16,750
This one, the last one was focused on the residential code.

497
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:18,952
This one is focused on the commercial energy code.

498
00:45:20,472 --> 00:45:29,817
And then after this, once the building inspectors are really up to speed on it, we'd like to hold some trainings for building owners and developers and contractors so that they understand it too.

499
00:45:30,878 --> 00:45:34,940
prior to the July 1st implementation date of it.

500
00:45:42,283 --> 00:45:46,425
And I have a couple of events coming up that I wanted to mention again.

501
00:45:46,505 --> 00:45:51,348
So the Boston Glory Green Fest is April 26th at Hormel Stadium.

502
00:45:53,629 --> 00:45:54,949
That's a ticketed event.

503
00:45:56,835 --> 00:46:05,602
but I was happy that they wanted to use it for, you know, to table about various climate-related things and do tips over the labs.

504
00:46:05,622 --> 00:46:06,603
What's it called again?

505
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:09,085
Boston Glory Green Fest.

506
00:46:09,306 --> 00:46:13,789
So Boston Glory is the ultimate, is a professional ultimate frisbee team.

507
00:46:13,809 --> 00:46:13,869
Yep.

508
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:18,293
Yeah, I remember looking it up.

509
00:46:18,613 --> 00:46:18,854
Yeah.

510
00:46:19,114 --> 00:46:20,155
So it's from the sixth.

511
00:46:21,376 --> 00:46:23,618
Yeah, so that's this Friday at seven.

512
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:38,498
And then the community cleanup is Saturday the 27th at 10 o'clock.

513
00:46:38,618 --> 00:46:44,200
And people can still sign up for that, I think right up until the day of.

514
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:49,742
And I think there are 20-something sites all around the city.

515
00:46:50,854 --> 00:47:05,278
Yeah, I remember I had thought about, um, I had thought about maybe doing one and I, you know, I kind of lost sight of it and I, because I was thinking about over in West Medford over there down the park and, you know, sort of that area.

516
00:47:05,298 --> 00:47:09,979
Um, but I, we have an event on that day anyway, on the 27th.

517
00:47:10,059 --> 00:47:13,720
So in the afternoon, right?

518
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,061
3 o'clock is it?

519
00:47:16,721 --> 00:47:18,222
Is that what time the event is?

520
00:47:19,042 --> 00:47:19,482
Chabot.

521
00:47:21,227 --> 00:47:23,028
What time is the event on Saturday?

522
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:25,750
Two.

523
00:47:27,031 --> 00:47:27,832
Is it three?

524
00:47:28,352 --> 00:47:28,492
One.

525
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,733
Oh, it's at three?

526
00:47:29,753 --> 00:47:30,134
Yeah.

527
00:47:30,354 --> 00:47:31,675
Oh, it starts at three.

528
00:47:31,955 --> 00:47:35,017
But we're going to be there earlier to set up and stuff.

529
00:47:35,337 --> 00:47:35,838
Oh, OK.

530
00:47:36,518 --> 00:47:37,739
I didn't realize.

531
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:38,980
OK.

532
00:47:39,581 --> 00:47:40,941
It's Saturday at three.

533
00:47:41,702 --> 00:47:41,802
OK.

534
00:47:41,982 --> 00:47:44,164
I'm hoping to do both.

535
00:47:44,204 --> 00:47:46,606
They don't know Hill app, so there's time to do both.

536
00:47:46,626 --> 00:47:46,726
Yeah.

537
00:47:48,973 --> 00:47:53,256
I'm working Saturday, so as soon as I get off of work, I'll be heading over to that, so.

538
00:47:53,276 --> 00:47:56,158
Mm-hmm.

539
00:47:56,358 --> 00:47:56,598
Yeah.

540
00:47:56,618 --> 00:47:57,499
See you there.

541
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:58,780
Huh?

542
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,321
We hope to see you there.

543
00:48:01,242 --> 00:48:01,442
Oh.

544
00:48:02,783 --> 00:48:03,103
Yeah.

545
00:48:04,524 --> 00:48:05,364
Of course.

546
00:48:09,327 --> 00:48:10,928
Oh, there's a lot going on.

547
00:48:11,068 --> 00:48:11,889
There's a lot going on.

548
00:48:11,909 --> 00:48:13,090
There's a lot going on.

549
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:14,891
This is a crazy month.

550
00:48:16,392 --> 00:48:25,359
And I was trying to get the electrified Medford stuff off the ground in time for Earth Week, because I know that, you know, get more mentions during that week.

551
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:26,160
Definitely.

552
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,281
Could not get it off the ground.

553
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:34,186
And I'm kind of grateful at this point, because there's so much going on.

554
00:48:34,606 --> 00:48:37,489
Oh, and the update on the Energy and Environment Committee.

555
00:48:37,509 --> 00:48:45,355
So they submitted a letter encouraging the city council to pass a resolution supporting the make polluters pay bill.

556
00:48:46,922 --> 00:48:48,923
which is being considered at the state level.

557
00:48:48,943 --> 00:48:53,905
So they were just asking the city council to tell the state that they supported it.

558
00:48:55,726 --> 00:49:00,348
And some of the members said they, some of the members attended the city council meeting to comment on it.

559
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:12,434
And at the next meeting, Senator Barrett, who's head of the Telecommunications Utilities and Energy Committee is coming

560
00:49:15,425 --> 00:49:25,214
We're on a Zoom call, so he's coming to the Zoom call on May 6 at 6.30 to talk about bills that his committee is working on.

561
00:49:25,234 --> 00:49:34,403
And the Energy and Environment Committee is open to the public, so you're all welcome to attend if you're interested.

562
00:49:37,606 --> 00:49:40,709
Their meetings are posted to the events calendar.

563
00:49:41,497 --> 00:49:45,461
And I just dropped the Zoom link to it in the chat.

564
00:49:50,205 --> 00:49:54,428
And at the last meeting, they finalized what priorities they want to focus on this year.

565
00:49:57,031 --> 00:50:00,574
That was a long conversation broken up over multiple meetings.

566
00:50:08,215 --> 00:50:10,116
I think that's the end of my updates.

567
00:50:10,136 --> 00:50:15,459
Do you guys have any questions about anything that's going on?

568
00:50:19,862 --> 00:50:21,043
No, that's a lot.

569
00:50:21,723 --> 00:50:24,105
Yeah, Brenda.

570
00:50:25,205 --> 00:50:31,449
So I helped my dad sign up for, what was that thing?

571
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:36,953
It's like the, I'm like,

572
00:50:38,555 --> 00:50:42,218
Blanking on the name, the Lee Heap, L-I Heap.

573
00:50:42,658 --> 00:50:44,260
Oh, Lye Heap, yes.

574
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,361
With the ECD.

575
00:50:46,021 --> 00:50:55,489
Yeah, I helped my father sign up for that so that he could get some, get like, you know, hopefully they will pay some of the electric bill.

576
00:50:55,629 --> 00:50:58,531
And he recently got a letter that he was approved for it.

577
00:50:59,452 --> 00:51:02,995
So do you know what the step after this is?

578
00:51:03,195 --> 00:51:07,038
Or like, it will proceed as its own, on its own?

579
00:51:08,162 --> 00:51:13,744
For the discounted energy prices, that will happen on its own.

580
00:51:14,244 --> 00:51:22,827
So ABCD will communicate the list of people who are eligible to the utility and then the utility will make that change.

581
00:51:23,627 --> 00:51:26,028
Okay, very good.

582
00:51:27,228 --> 00:51:33,371
If he was signing up for fuel assistance as well, to like,

583
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:39,533
help pay his existing bills, not just get a discounted price moving forward.

584
00:51:40,074 --> 00:51:42,196
Yeah, the fuel assistance one.

585
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,077
The fuel assistance, yeah.

586
00:51:44,417 --> 00:51:49,101
Okay, yeah, so ABCD should be following up with him about the fuel assistance.

587
00:51:49,822 --> 00:51:50,102
Okay.

588
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:51,323
Yeah.

589
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:54,145
Okay, then.

590
00:51:56,513 --> 00:52:05,975
But if he signs up for fuel assistance, if he signs up for LIHEAP and he signs up for fuel assistance, then he automatically will get the discount rate added to his bill moving forward too.

591
00:52:06,795 --> 00:52:07,315
Very good.

592
00:52:08,635 --> 00:52:12,036
And they will communicate with National Grid?

593
00:52:13,356 --> 00:52:13,636
Yes.

594
00:52:14,777 --> 00:52:15,037
Yeah.

595
00:52:15,057 --> 00:52:16,417
All right.

596
00:52:18,017 --> 00:52:18,497
Thank you.

597
00:52:18,617 --> 00:52:21,878
And then this also means that he's eligible for

598
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:28,410
energy efficiency upgrades to his house through the Mass Save program for free.

599
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:33,631
The heat pump, like for a heat pump, for example?

600
00:52:34,391 --> 00:52:35,012
Yes.

601
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:48,296
For insulation, for air sealing, for heat pumps, I think they also do refrigerators for free for people who are eligible for LIHEAP and fuel assistance and all of that.

602
00:52:48,316 --> 00:52:52,157
That's something that I think

603
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:58,209
If ABCD hasn't already talked to him about it, he should reach back out to them and ask about it.

604
00:52:59,290 --> 00:52:59,590
Okay.

605
00:53:01,893 --> 00:53:07,599
Yeah, I just, I know that he received a letter and he was telling me about it.

606
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,444
Cause like I said, I helped him create the application.

607
00:53:13,579 --> 00:53:17,582
And I just wasn't sure where to go from there.

608
00:53:18,082 --> 00:53:23,906
They basically said, oh, you get this amount of money in benefits.

609
00:53:24,006 --> 00:53:26,147
So it's like, OK, what do I do now?

610
00:53:27,028 --> 00:53:29,869
So that's a good thing to ask you.

611
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:31,230
Thank you.

612
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:35,073
Yeah, the fuel assistance and the discounts will be automatic.

613
00:53:36,394 --> 00:53:41,797
But yeah, any changes to be made to his house, like insulation, air sealing, all of that stuff.

614
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:46,943
I think he would want to reach back out to ABCD to talk to them about signing up for that program.

615
00:53:46,963 --> 00:53:50,184
Yeah, that's great.

616
00:53:50,484 --> 00:53:55,026
How did you find the experience of doing that application?

617
00:53:55,086 --> 00:53:56,246
Was it difficult?

618
00:53:57,266 --> 00:53:58,507
It wasn't difficult.

619
00:53:58,547 --> 00:54:01,948
It was just, it took like a long time to kind of

620
00:54:04,296 --> 00:54:10,301
for them to like, I guess, like the process just like took a long time, like two months or something.

621
00:54:11,662 --> 00:54:14,384
The application itself is not difficult at all.

622
00:54:14,424 --> 00:54:21,950
They just, you know, they require, you know, identification, income, all that stuff, which is standard these days, you know.

623
00:54:24,111 --> 00:54:25,132
Yep, that makes sense.

624
00:54:25,813 --> 00:54:27,214
So yeah, so I think the thing that

625
00:54:28,168 --> 00:54:34,930
Hearing that that I would tell people is it's not that difficult, but it takes a while for them to respond when you get signed up.

626
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:37,090
So do it sooner rather than later.

627
00:54:38,251 --> 00:54:41,091
It is nice that you can do it all online.

628
00:54:41,932 --> 00:54:45,852
You don't necessarily have to call them unless you have questions.

629
00:54:46,293 --> 00:54:50,634
So yeah, it's good that way you can upload all the documents online.

630
00:54:51,514 --> 00:54:52,114
That's great.

631
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,415
All right.

632
00:55:01,772 --> 00:55:18,643
Any other questions about any of the city updates?

633
00:55:20,564 --> 00:55:23,406
In terms of new business and future meetings,

634
00:55:25,759 --> 00:55:42,157
Do we want to add an item each week for like Medford Connects events and things that you're doing that you might want to just bring up in this meeting and discuss?

635
00:55:45,901 --> 00:55:47,743
I think that would be a good idea.

636
00:55:49,835 --> 00:56:00,958
Because apart from my event, I know that we have the Haitian Flag Day coming up in May, so I'm sure Natasha will want to share more details about that.

637
00:56:03,078 --> 00:56:09,820
We all help each other when it comes to these events, so I think that would be nice.

638
00:56:12,624 --> 00:56:13,205
That would be great.

639
00:56:13,605 --> 00:56:18,869
And I think they're a great opportunity to get the word out to people about all of these programs.

640
00:56:18,949 --> 00:56:23,113
So yeah, good to know everything that's going on.

641
00:56:27,857 --> 00:56:35,443
And then for future meeting topics, do you have any suggestions for things you want to discuss at the next meeting?

642
00:56:40,971 --> 00:56:51,096
Do you want to put together a list of priorities for this group in the same way that the energy committee did so that you kind of have a focus moving forward for the rest of the year?

643
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:56,218
That might be a good idea.

644
00:56:58,199 --> 00:56:58,479
Yeah.

645
00:57:00,704 --> 00:57:13,470
Because I can't really think of new topics to discuss, but maybe just updates on the priorities, prioritized subjects.

646
00:57:18,132 --> 00:57:29,098
I can put together a spreadsheet like the Energy Committee had and maybe put some suggestions in and then send it out to you guys so that you could add your own suggestions.

647
00:57:30,019 --> 00:57:33,941
sort of vote on what topics you're the most interested in.

648
00:57:35,241 --> 00:57:36,442
Sure, sounds good.

649
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:51,149
Anything right now that's kind of coming to the top of your mind that you'd like to make sure is included in that?

650
00:58:02,703 --> 00:58:04,324
Nothing's coming to me right now.

651
00:58:06,664 --> 00:58:15,547
I think maybe once the, you know, if you're going to create a spreadsheet and start putting and throwing some topics out there, it might, I think it might start to, yeah.

652
00:58:17,148 --> 00:58:17,328
Yep.

653
00:58:18,588 --> 00:58:19,088
Sounds good.

654
00:58:26,811 --> 00:58:27,131
Okay.

655
00:58:27,331 --> 00:58:29,512
Anything else we want to talk about today?

656
00:58:42,368 --> 00:58:43,630
Can we get a motion to adjourn?

657
00:58:46,593 --> 00:58:47,694
Motion to adjourn.

658
00:58:49,235 --> 00:58:50,697
I have a question.

659
00:58:51,157 --> 00:58:55,161
Oh, I'm sorry.

660
00:58:55,582 --> 00:58:56,983
It's all good.

661
00:58:57,083 --> 00:59:00,227
I've been in so much meeting, my brain is fucked.

662
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:04,311
What's your question?

663
00:59:06,282 --> 00:59:17,328
Yeah, I wanted to know, you brought up a point about like my event for the Haitian community, Haitian Flag Day is coming up next month.

664
00:59:17,448 --> 00:59:24,532
And I was wondering, do you guys would like to come to do a little, maybe a little tabling over there?

665
00:59:26,093 --> 00:59:32,257
So you could put kind of like some of the things that you spoke about that

666
00:59:33,097 --> 00:59:53,320
the community, Haitian community, could be probably not aware of that is happening because it's a lot of things that you've said that my aunt is a homeowner and she doesn't know much about these things, you understand, and she's been in a Medford residence for like over 20 somewhat years.

667
00:59:54,383 --> 01:00:02,829
So and I don't think her children know of these things in Medford to the point that they would like share it with her.

668
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:07,252
So basically now it's going to be on my my end to do so.

669
01:00:08,535 --> 01:00:10,036
So but that's my aunt.

670
01:00:10,156 --> 01:00:30,944
But I'm wondering if there's other Haitian residents who are homeowners in Medford that knows about these great opportunities, you know, and what for them to do, like about flooding in Medford, if their house, because one of our friends, my sister in church, one of her house is in Medford.

671
01:00:31,024 --> 01:00:36,807
And when it rains, her house is bombarded with flood, you know, and she don't know what to do with that.

672
01:00:37,547 --> 01:00:45,294
So yeah, so those are the things that are going in my mind right now, as you guys were speaking, because it's like so much.

673
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:57,586
So I'm wondering if you would like to come on May 18th, if you have time in your schedule, maybe you could do a little tabling and enjoy the Haitian fiesta.

674
01:00:58,672 --> 01:01:00,654
That would be great, absolutely.

675
01:01:01,594 --> 01:01:11,682
And we also, a couple of our Electrify Medford coaches are from the Haitian community too, so I'd love to have them there.

676
01:01:13,103 --> 01:01:15,285
Awesome, I would love to meet them, yes.

677
01:01:17,046 --> 01:01:19,088
That's great, yeah, that sounds wonderful.

678
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:24,783
When I get the flyer ready, I'll pass it on to you via email.

679
01:01:25,624 --> 01:01:26,104
That's great.

680
01:01:28,105 --> 01:01:33,308
And as I mentioned, as we're getting all of the Electrify Medford materials together, we'll share them with you.

681
01:01:33,328 --> 01:01:45,175
And at any point, if you have any feedback on it, even if it's a finished flyer, it's printed out, it's out there, and you're like, actually, I think you should probably change this, let me know.

682
01:01:45,195 --> 01:01:46,256
We can change them anytime.

683
01:01:49,942 --> 01:01:52,363
Matt, sit on the bed.

684
01:01:52,463 --> 01:01:57,006
And Natasha, you mentioned that your friend's house floods when it rains.

685
01:01:57,126 --> 01:02:01,088
So yeah, do you want to follow up with me separately about that?

686
01:02:01,108 --> 01:02:04,970
Because I'd love to hear more about it and see if there's something that could be done.

687
01:02:06,344 --> 01:02:08,945
Yes, I will speak to her.

688
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:14,106
Maybe we could do a three-way to talk about it, because she was mentioning this.

689
01:02:14,126 --> 01:02:15,127
She's like, I don't know what to do.

690
01:02:15,147 --> 01:02:17,047
Maybe I should sell the house and this and that.

691
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:19,288
I'm like, oh, OK.

692
01:02:20,188 --> 01:02:20,729
Don't know.

693
01:02:22,049 --> 01:02:26,990
That would be hard for you to disclose that, right?

694
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:30,952
Yeah, I'm like, OK.

695
01:02:31,112 --> 01:02:33,092
I hit my car?

696
01:02:33,753 --> 01:02:34,013
Yeah.

697
01:02:36,748 --> 01:02:38,829
especially if you see water lines in the basement.

698
01:02:39,069 --> 01:02:40,470
Yeah, definitely.

699
01:02:41,971 --> 01:02:43,252
So thanks, Natasha.

700
01:02:50,055 --> 01:02:51,236
Re-motion to adjourn.

701
01:02:51,256 --> 01:02:57,900
I second this motion.

702
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:01,702
All in favor?

703
01:03:01,802 --> 01:03:01,902
Aye.

704
01:03:07,921 --> 01:03:08,461
Opposed?

705
01:03:11,344 --> 01:03:11,944
Abstained?

706
01:03:12,345 --> 01:03:14,586
I see Lizette is giving thumbs up there.

707
01:03:14,606 --> 01:03:15,587
Hi.

708
01:03:16,808 --> 01:03:21,532
I'm sorry my son just got in the car.

709
01:03:21,552 --> 01:03:23,093
I didn't like talk to you so much.

710
01:03:23,594 --> 01:03:25,776
Sorry guys.

711
01:03:27,497 --> 01:03:27,837
Great.

712
01:03:28,398 --> 01:03:29,338
Thanks a lot everyone.

713
01:03:29,378 --> 01:03:29,939
We'll see you.

714
01:03:29,959 --> 01:03:31,200
