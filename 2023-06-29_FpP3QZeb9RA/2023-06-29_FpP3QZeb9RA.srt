[SPEAKER_09]: We have continued business.

40
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:31,980
[SPEAKER_09]: First up is 3A, recommendation to approve the Medford Public Schools bullying report.

41
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,823
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna pass it over to Member Ruseau.

42
00:02:34,843 --> 00:02:36,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mayor.

43
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:38,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

44
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:50,000
[SPEAKER_01]: The bullying, excuse me, the rules and policy subcommittee has met five times over the course of the past winter and spring to update our bullying prevention and intervention policy, plan policy.

45
00:02:51,040 --> 00:03:01,382
[SPEAKER_01]: This proposed policy represents many hours of work in and out of meetings, drafting and redrafting language, researching how other school committees have written their policies, reading and rereading the law.

46
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:04,223
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am proud of this work product before us tonight.

47
00:03:05,168 --> 00:03:08,629
[SPEAKER_01]: I see all policy as a statement of direction for our district leadership.

48
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:10,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Policy is not written in stone.

49
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,990
[SPEAKER_01]: This policy is not perfect.

50
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,291
[SPEAKER_01]: No policy ever is.

51
00:03:14,031 --> 00:03:22,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, it is imperative that policy be regularly reviewed and based on actual outcomes, it should be changed so that the goal of the policy can be achieved.

52
00:03:23,294 --> 00:03:25,855
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank the members of the Rules and Policy Subcommittee.

53
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:28,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Member McLaughlin, Member Graham.

54
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:40,015
[SPEAKER_01]: I also especially want to thank Vice Chair Graham for her work to generate a new policy document rather than trying to transform our old policy document, which is how we tried to make that go.

55
00:03:40,135 --> 00:03:47,698
[SPEAKER_01]: But without her effort to sort of hit the blank page and start over, I think we would still be having meetings on this policy.

56
00:03:48,547 --> 00:03:57,809
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to thank our administration and principals that took the time to share their experiences and insights, especially Principal Tucci of the Morgan Middle School and Assistant Superintendent Peter Cushing.

57
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:14,472
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, I'd like to thank the community members that were at every one of these meetings, especially Nicole Bramley, who single-handedly forced this policy into the crowded policy space of the school committee and helped us to understand from the caregiver perspective what was right and what was wrong with our policy.

58
00:04:14,772 --> 00:04:18,273
[SPEAKER_01]: I am deeply sorry that this attention to this policy required an incident

59
00:04:18,598 --> 00:04:19,799
[SPEAKER_01]: that we all know too well.

60
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,924
[SPEAKER_01]: I am hopeful that this new policy will allow the Medford Public Schools to move forward with clarity on bullying prevention and intervention.

61
00:04:27,544 --> 00:04:31,787
[SPEAKER_01]: I am also hopeful that this drastically improved policy provides some resolution to Ms.

62
00:04:31,827 --> 00:04:38,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Branley and to those who have experienced bullying, and in many ways it harms our community and our students we serve.

63
00:04:38,992 --> 00:04:43,555
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, I'd like to make a motion to amend line 261 to remove the

64
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:48,301
[SPEAKER_01]: random period that is sitting in between a couple of words.

65
00:04:53,785 --> 00:04:54,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

66
00:04:57,967 --> 00:05:00,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to amend by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Graham.

67
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call, please.

68
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:05,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, before the roll is called, member Kreatz, you have your hand up.

69
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:12,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I just had a question on one of the sections in the policy, but I can wait until the roll call for this one.

70
00:05:13,418 --> 00:05:15,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'll call the roll on this one amendment.

71
00:05:16,527 --> 00:05:16,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

72
00:05:16,907 --> 00:05:17,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham?

73
00:05:18,088 --> 00:05:18,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

74
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:19,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Hays?

75
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:21,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

76
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:23,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Kreatz?

77
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:27,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Kreatz?

78
00:05:31,537 --> 00:05:32,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm muted, sorry.

79
00:05:32,898 --> 00:05:33,878
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good, thank you.

80
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:35,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin?

81
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:36,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

82
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:38,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Bestone?

83
00:05:38,902 --> 00:05:39,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

84
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:41,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Rissell?

85
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:41,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

86
00:05:41,323 --> 00:05:41,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

87
00:05:42,974 --> 00:05:45,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

88
00:05:45,515 --> 00:05:46,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Amendment passes.

89
00:05:47,335 --> 00:05:49,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Kreatz, then Member Hays.

90
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:50,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

91
00:05:51,076 --> 00:05:55,637
[SPEAKER_04]: First, I wanted to say something similar to what my colleague said, and I'll just keep it simple.

92
00:05:56,137 --> 00:06:04,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to the entire committee for all your work on this document and to all the community members and everybody who helped work on this comprehensive procedure.

93
00:06:04,838 --> 00:06:08,679
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just had a question or maybe some clarification on number 11.

94
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,720
[SPEAKER_04]: First, I had noticed that

95
00:06:13,494 --> 00:06:21,818
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the terms that's in the section on page 14 isn't listed in section 11 on page 12.

96
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:28,021
[SPEAKER_04]: The word that's used in section 11 is is the word target.

97
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:39,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Typically, I've seen the word victim in policies, but I don't know if this is something different with language, with what was discussed in the committee where I wasn't involved in that.

98
00:06:40,586 --> 00:06:45,268
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one of the questions about that particular word choice.

99
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:49,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the other one was in the same section.

100
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:54,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a little confused about the section because it says,

101
00:06:55,533 --> 00:07:01,579
[SPEAKER_04]: In the section it says I understand that the caregiver won't be informed of the disciplinary actions they have no problem with that.

102
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:05,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it mentions that the caregiver.

103
00:07:07,737 --> 00:07:09,759
[SPEAKER_04]: each other as a caregiver.

104
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

105
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,320
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm reading something else.

106
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:11,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

107
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

108
00:07:14,242 --> 00:07:14,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

109
00:07:15,263 --> 00:07:19,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not share the names of the disciplinary actions with the third party.

110
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:21,067
[SPEAKER_04]: That I understand.

111
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:26,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it says, caregivers of targets do not have the right to know the name of the aggressor.

112
00:07:27,772 --> 00:07:30,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Caregivers of the aggressor do not have the right to know the name of the victim.

113
00:07:31,515 --> 00:07:35,858
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was just curious about this and had questions because

114
00:07:39,406 --> 00:07:43,002
[SPEAKER_04]: victim and or the aggressor are students in their minors.

115
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:58,386
[SPEAKER_04]: I was under the impression that the caregivers would be informed of the names because their child or their dependent, the person they're taking care of, would want to talk to them.

116
00:07:59,006 --> 00:08:09,514
[SPEAKER_04]: And the caregiver would have to assist or help and support their minor, whomever it may be, person they're taking care of or they have custody of.

117
00:08:10,595 --> 00:08:14,938
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was wondering if somebody could provide clarification about those two things.

118
00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:15,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

119
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor, you can answer those.

120
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Member Ruseau.

121
00:08:22,381 --> 00:08:24,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Member Kreatz.

122
00:08:24,562 --> 00:08:31,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Target is used in the law in a bunch of places, but I would agree that Target is not in the definitions.

123
00:08:31,725 --> 00:08:37,187
[SPEAKER_01]: So, looking at the law right now, they don't

124
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:38,786
[SPEAKER_01]: have a definition for it.

125
00:08:39,427 --> 00:08:43,672
[SPEAKER_01]: They have definitions for all kinds of things, then they use words that they don't have definitions for.

126
00:08:44,252 --> 00:08:51,801
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would agree that we would want to amend it to have some kind of definition to describe what target means.

127
00:08:52,902 --> 00:08:55,665
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that I don't think I can do that on the fly right now.

128
00:08:55,825 --> 00:08:56,867
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, we want

129
00:08:57,487 --> 00:09:09,274
[SPEAKER_01]: I would certainly be happy to put a motion on for our first meeting in September to amend the policy with a definition if that's acceptable to Democrats.

130
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:25,238
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking, I know in the definitions in, I don't have it open, I'm just looking at my notes I put together here, was it said something like the aggressor, the similar term would be a perpetrator.

131
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:40,026
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it was like in, you know, in brackets at the end of the definition, maybe something like that could be worded under victim, you know, because that's where I think, you know, that's where I think you want to put with the

132
00:09:40,706 --> 00:10:04,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Individual is labeled as a target because there was perpetrator and aggressor were similar terms mentioned, and then maybe victim and target individual, part of the same definition as victim or underneath it, kind of in the same sentence.

133
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,038
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that's fine for September.

134
00:10:09,013 --> 00:10:12,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Cressy, is that your last question?

135
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I still didn't get an answer on, you know,

136
00:10:18,837 --> 00:10:40,176
[SPEAKER_04]: the question about, so if like my child's bullied, and I know, because my child has talked to me, let's just say in hypothetical, and I know who the student is, and my child has come to me and they say, I've been bullied, and this is the person, well then, I'm gonna wanna talk with my child.

137
00:10:40,756 --> 00:10:45,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think it would be difficult if the caregiver or the parent or guardian doesn't know

138
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:53,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Whom, you know, is the person involved with the conflict, you know, whatever it is, because, you know.

139
00:10:54,551 --> 00:11:18,207
[SPEAKER_04]: the parent, in my mind, I was thinking the parent or caregiver can look out for their own, you know, child, you know, care person that's in custody with them, you know, just, you know, if they're out and about, you know, let's try to, you know, let's just try to go over here, you know, you know, I'm not sure like if somebody could explain maybe if there was a discussion about that,

140
00:11:19,368 --> 00:11:23,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally understand that the disciplinary actions wouldn't be given out.

141
00:11:24,374 --> 00:11:32,664
[SPEAKER_04]: I know at one point, just a very simple example in elementary school when my son was bullied for lunch money.

142
00:11:34,105 --> 00:11:36,446
[SPEAKER_04]: the two students were brought together by the principal.

143
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:40,206
[SPEAKER_04]: We were called in so that both parents could have a discussion.

144
00:11:40,246 --> 00:11:48,408
[SPEAKER_04]: This is very early elementary school, but so that everybody was brought together so that we're all on the same page that you don't want to do that.

145
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:54,149
[SPEAKER_04]: If you need money for milk money, we'll try to set up a plan or we'll work with you and your parents, something like that.

146
00:11:55,830 --> 00:12:02,431
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if this is something new in the policy or if this has always been in the policy and I'm just not aware of it.

147
00:12:04,548 --> 00:12:07,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, ma'am.

148
00:12:11,604 --> 00:12:16,326
[SPEAKER_01]: understood, but it's also the law that this information cannot be handed down.

149
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:18,246
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a pretty old law at this point.

150
00:12:19,867 --> 00:12:23,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether a principal, I mean, this is in relation to bullying though.

151
00:12:23,528 --> 00:12:29,790
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't know what, at the early elementary level, how that is handled.

152
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:35,813
[SPEAKER_01]: I assume it would be handled a little differently than it does for high school seniors, but

153
00:12:37,413 --> 00:12:51,438
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't envision that this restricts any of that in any other way other than making it clear that, in case there was any confusion, that you can't get a phone call saying, your child was bullied and here's the name of the kid that did it.

154
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:57,620
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a clear violation of the law, not even regulation.

155
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:06,743
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether or not, if your kid knows the name, which, I mean, it seems hard to imagine a kid doesn't know the name, how did there get to be a report?

156
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:10,620
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the kids, your child's gonna tell you their name.

157
00:13:11,401 --> 00:13:20,547
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you talk to the school, you might use the name and the school is going to respond as if that is, could be a name, it might not be the name.

158
00:13:21,187 --> 00:13:29,032
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not supposed to be responding that anything about that other student, at least their identity.

159
00:13:29,112 --> 00:13:36,617
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that isn't always a great time when you're the parent of the target victim.

160
00:13:37,438 --> 00:13:41,271
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever word is appropriate, but that's definitely not new.

161
00:13:45,188 --> 00:13:47,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, thanks for the clarification.

162
00:13:48,029 --> 00:14:09,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, you know, needed that clarification so I understood and, you know, I was even thinking that the child wouldn't be allowed to tell the caregiver and I thought it would be a little stressful for, you know, if the child knew, you know, because they want to work with the caregiver to, you know, some supports and, you know, just to get them through it.

163
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:10,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

164
00:14:10,457 --> 00:14:12,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

165
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:13,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Hays.

166
00:14:18,117 --> 00:14:18,577
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

167
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,939
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I wanted to echo what everyone has said.

168
00:14:21,979 --> 00:14:23,320
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a huge amount of work.

169
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:28,423
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched a couple of the meetings, so I know the back and forth and how long those meetings went.

170
00:14:28,523 --> 00:14:34,306
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is wonderful that we have this plan in place now, and it's updated with all the new information.

171
00:14:35,427 --> 00:14:46,453
[SPEAKER_00]: I did want to mention, I had my hand up a minute ago, in terms of the definition of target, I mean, it's a pretty short definition, but they do have definitions for those newer terms.

172
00:14:47,106 --> 00:14:51,988
[SPEAKER_00]: on the DESI website in their model bullying prevention and intervention plan.

173
00:14:52,048 --> 00:14:58,570
[SPEAKER_00]: So those definitions could just be taken from there if the team decided to do that.

174
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:06,734
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question, I had a couple of questions, but my main question really had to do with the definition of bullying.

175
00:15:07,194 --> 00:15:12,816
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a definition on the first page, which is page three when you print it up,

176
00:15:13,772 --> 00:15:21,715
[SPEAKER_00]: Lines 17 through 24 has a definition of bullying that I know it was taken pretty much verbatim.

177
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:26,436
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I think it was definitely verbatim from the law, the Massachusetts law.

178
00:15:26,516 --> 00:15:30,518
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked at a couple of their district websites.

179
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:33,419
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like everyone really just pulls that and uses it verbatim.

180
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:40,721
[SPEAKER_00]: But then on page, the next page, page four lines 55 through,

181
00:15:44,096 --> 00:15:52,901
[SPEAKER_00]: 61, when it's talking about the investigation and how the conclusions of the findings may come out, there's a different definition of bullying.

182
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:58,103
[SPEAKER_00]: It adds in that bullying can only be found to have occurred.

183
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:08,869
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, a finding of bullying occurs when the incident is determined to be between two students who are not considered to be equal in power within the quarrel or the problem.

184
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:13,111
[SPEAKER_00]: Bullying is abuse and occurs when a socially powerful student

185
00:16:14,488 --> 00:16:18,589
[SPEAKER_00]: abuses, sorry, it goes on mentally or physically abuses the weaker.

186
00:16:18,989 --> 00:16:22,850
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a different definition, really.

187
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:27,490
[SPEAKER_00]: It's adding in that idea of it has to be an unequal power.

188
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:31,671
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't see that anywhere in the law.

189
00:16:31,771 --> 00:16:36,792
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see that anywhere in the DESE website plans.

190
00:16:37,512 --> 00:16:41,413
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest, I looked through a few other local, several other

191
00:16:42,276 --> 00:16:45,637
[SPEAKER_00]: neighboring districts, and I don't see that anywhere in their plans either.

192
00:16:46,037 --> 00:16:50,538
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like a pretty significant change of the definition.

193
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:52,198
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was wondering about that.

194
00:16:58,319 --> 00:16:59,860
[SPEAKER_09]: I know member Graham has her hand up too.

195
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,260
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if that's to answer that question or member Rousseau.

196
00:17:03,081 --> 00:17:03,381
[SPEAKER_09]: It was.

197
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,241
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just to answer member Hays' question.

198
00:17:06,095 --> 00:17:09,617
[SPEAKER_09]: member Graham than member Ruseau, two answers to embrace.

199
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:10,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

200
00:17:10,657 --> 00:17:31,087
[SPEAKER_05]: So the reason that it appears in the section that you're referring to is because we heard from caregivers in particular that very often, and whether it's too often or not, I think is a question for another day, but the conclusion or the finding will come back that it is not bullying, but it is conflict.

201
00:17:31,747 --> 00:17:38,808
[SPEAKER_05]: And we really pressed the administrators to be clear with us about what does it mean?

202
00:17:38,888 --> 00:17:42,149
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the difference between conflict and bullying?

203
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:50,010
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is where that nuance comes in about sort of social power and recurrence and repeatedness.

204
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:59,812
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we're trying to do in that section is talk about what this looks like in practice so that people can start to understand that conflict doesn't mean it's not serious.

205
00:18:01,473 --> 00:18:04,635
[SPEAKER_05]: it just means that it doesn't rise to the level of bullying under the law.

206
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:21,687
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is why it appears in that section really to try to sort of thread the needle between the difference between bullying and conflict because there are lots and lots and lots of times where the findings come back and the finding is that this isn't bullying, it's conflict.

207
00:18:21,887 --> 00:18:23,648
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's really confusing to parents.

208
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:26,270
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that was why we were trying to clear that up.

209
00:18:27,324 --> 00:18:34,648
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, so my question is that actually under the law, that doesn't require the finding that there was a differential in power.

210
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:39,231
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're actually changing the definition compared to what the law says.

211
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:40,752
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't say that in the law.

212
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:43,694
[SPEAKER_00]: The law doesn't say everything that's in our policy.

213
00:18:45,075 --> 00:18:47,656
[SPEAKER_00]: But the law clearly defines bullying.

214
00:18:47,756 --> 00:18:53,600
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to find the passage now where it actually says that you should not change the scope of the definition.

215
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,842
[SPEAKER_00]: You can clarify the definition, but you can't change

216
00:18:57,677 --> 00:19:00,619
[SPEAKER_00]: the meaning or the scope, and I would, I'm concerned.

217
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:05,681
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that- I'm not seeing how that changes the scope personally, but, and we talked about this for like five meetings.

218
00:19:06,722 --> 00:19:11,844
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, but I think it, it adds something that's not in the law.

219
00:19:12,124 --> 00:19:20,289
[SPEAKER_00]: It adds something that requires a judgment call on the, whoever's doing the investigation that the law doesn't require.

220
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:26,592
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't find that in any other local school district adding in this definition of

221
00:19:26,994 --> 00:19:32,358
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, abuse of power or a power differential between the aggressor and the target.

222
00:19:33,398 --> 00:19:36,760
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I think that's a change to the law.

223
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:52,411
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would, I would, I as a parent, if I had a child who was being bullied or thought was, I thought was being bullied, if they met every other criteria based on the law, and then you said, well, they didn't, it wasn't bullying because we require it to be a difference in power.

224
00:19:52,431 --> 00:19:55,673
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I would probably look to

225
00:19:56,431 --> 00:20:02,377
[SPEAKER_00]: getting some legal advice on whether that's legally allowed for school to add that into the law.

226
00:20:02,397 --> 00:20:05,901
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember McLaughlin and then member.

227
00:20:05,921 --> 00:20:12,988
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I think it was a person there that was it I, I think I had my hand up for sorry.

228
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:14,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

229
00:20:15,868 --> 00:20:23,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I just have an issue because I didn't unfortunately receive the policy and I just, I did just reach out and ask for it.

230
00:20:23,533 --> 00:20:26,516
[SPEAKER_07]: So I am getting a copy of it and I have got a copy of it.

231
00:20:26,536 --> 00:20:31,399
[SPEAKER_07]: I think from one of the members, I have been part of the subcommittee.

232
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:36,643
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm aware of a lot of it, but I didn't get to do a final read through because I did not receive it.

233
00:20:36,683 --> 00:20:38,244
[SPEAKER_07]: It was sent to another McLaughlin.

234
00:20:40,226 --> 00:20:40,846
[SPEAKER_07]: in the district.

235
00:20:42,046 --> 00:20:47,589
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to put that out there as well that I haven't had a chance to read through this.

236
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:53,631
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to be able to read through that before I take a final vote.

237
00:20:55,312 --> 00:20:56,512
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know this is the first reading.

238
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:02,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau?

239
00:21:03,956 --> 00:21:04,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, thank you.

240
00:21:04,877 --> 00:21:09,319
[SPEAKER_01]: The word power occurs is listed in the law seven times.

241
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Power differential is listed.

242
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:17,744
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to share my screen if somebody wants to, doesn't believe it.

243
00:21:17,824 --> 00:21:24,088
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm on the mass legislature.gov website looking at the law myself.

244
00:21:24,308 --> 00:21:27,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Power differential is actually discussed.

245
00:21:28,111 --> 00:21:32,793
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know what to say other than that.

246
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,546
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's worth noting that power differential is always implied.

247
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:42,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, we're going to have no more sports teams.

248
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:53,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Because stuff that happens on sports teams between people who are hanging out and doing things on sports teams, if we don't have power differential in this equation,

249
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:57,040
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be considered bullying every day there.

250
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,661
[SPEAKER_01]: At least how I think happens at a lot of sports teams.

251
00:22:01,902 --> 00:22:10,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff that two people don't even think is bullying will be bullying because the policy requires that if an adult sees it, doesn't require that the students say they were bullied.

252
00:22:12,906 --> 00:22:17,508
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's a very, very important thing to recognize that we have

253
00:22:18,376 --> 00:22:21,281
[SPEAKER_01]: We have not required that the students say I was bullied.

254
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:29,575
[SPEAKER_01]: We have said our staff is responsible for seeing something that we believe based on the definition is bullying and acting.

255
00:22:31,001 --> 00:22:33,063
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the expectation.

256
00:22:33,403 --> 00:22:38,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Frankly, that's the expectation I think that's always existed for school staff.

257
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,527
[SPEAKER_01]: I doubt anybody would disagree.

258
00:22:40,008 --> 00:22:51,856
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of that, I think that the definition does have to be pretty darn airtight because part of the reason we're here is that everybody had an opinion on whether it was bullying.

259
00:22:52,357 --> 00:22:56,420
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one person, the person who was dealing with it says it's not bullying.

260
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,422
[SPEAKER_01]: And then five other people in the administration look at it and go,

261
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:01,013
[SPEAKER_01]: How is that not bullying?

262
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:09,858
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not suggesting that the people who are making these determinations that things are not bullying are doing anything wrong.

263
00:23:10,078 --> 00:23:17,183
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying they've had a pretty bad definition that is really hard to follow.

264
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:23,067
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just trying to give some feedback on what we've talked about in our five meetings.

265
00:23:23,207 --> 00:23:28,250
[SPEAKER_01]: But I certainly respect that the definition does look different.

266
00:23:29,551 --> 00:23:34,133
[SPEAKER_01]: But the word power and power differential is in the law multiple times.

267
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:34,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

268
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,475
[SPEAKER_00]: Point of information, I think, if that's the right term.

269
00:23:38,495 --> 00:23:44,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, yeah, which will be a question, and then Member McLaughlin.

270
00:23:44,897 --> 00:23:51,800
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the law in front of me, and I actually don't see that unless there's an updated version and I found the wrong one.

271
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:58,503
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't see the definition of bullying in this law that I have in front of me, the chapter

272
00:23:59,935 --> 00:24:01,076
[SPEAKER_00]: 71 section 370.

273
00:24:03,617 --> 00:24:19,026
[SPEAKER_00]: That definition of bullying is exactly what is on the first page of this plan, but I see nowhere else any discussion of there needing to be a power differential between the victim or the target and the aggressor.

274
00:24:19,046 --> 00:24:26,990
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if anything, adding that power differential makes it harder to define something as bullying because that requires

275
00:24:27,523 --> 00:24:31,548
[SPEAKER_00]: the investigation to decide whether there was a power differential between the two people.

276
00:24:32,689 --> 00:24:37,094
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think the law requires that based on my reading of the definition.

277
00:24:37,114 --> 00:24:42,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin, I don't know.

278
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:46,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, I just was looking at the.

279
00:24:47,262 --> 00:24:57,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm just looking at the agenda and I just want to clarify for myself and for folks that what what we're doing right now is the first read through right so.

280
00:24:58,627 --> 00:25:06,292
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget, and maybe through the chair, Member Ruseau, if you can remind me of the policy for the read through for the new policy.

281
00:25:06,312 --> 00:25:12,516
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do read through one, and then we do read through two, and then we vote for approval or not.

282
00:25:12,776 --> 00:25:13,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that accurate?

283
00:25:17,139 --> 00:25:17,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau?

284
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:23,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Our policy number 46 does say that we would have two readings.

285
00:25:23,103 --> 00:25:25,605
[SPEAKER_01]: The first reading has to be approved for there to be a second reading.

286
00:25:26,603 --> 00:25:28,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

287
00:25:28,106 --> 00:25:33,735
[SPEAKER_01]: The second reading, my understanding is the second reading needs to be exactly what the first one was, what we voted it.

288
00:25:33,855 --> 00:25:37,261
[SPEAKER_01]: So second reading is not an opportunity to come in to continue to amend.

289
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,306
[SPEAKER_01]: If we amend, then that's a new first reading.

290
00:25:41,727 --> 00:25:44,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so thank you to the chair.

291
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:54,498
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I understand correctly, the first reading is the opportunity to have input make changes, you know, public comment, whatever.

292
00:25:54,939 --> 00:26:04,647
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the second reading is just sort of reading officially what was agreed upon in the first reading before making the final vote and that affords the opportunity for

293
00:26:05,888 --> 00:26:22,816
[SPEAKER_07]: folks to, you know, I guess review once again even though they can't have change or input so I guess I'm in a little bit of a quandary here and I'm looking to my colleagues to let me know what they think before I make a motion if I need to to make a motion to table because I haven't read this.

294
00:26:23,556 --> 00:26:35,790
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm looking to my colleagues for what suggestions they might have since I haven't actually had the opportunity to read through this and were they in that position, what would they like to do?

295
00:26:37,452 --> 00:26:39,354
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd have to table it if you needed more time.

296
00:26:39,454 --> 00:26:39,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

297
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:41,778
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm thinking.

298
00:26:41,918 --> 00:26:47,680
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to make a motion to table, because I have not gotten the materials I would like to get the materials.

299
00:26:48,561 --> 00:27:00,045
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can read through them so that we can have a full first reading and maybe that will also afford us the opportunity to reflect on whatever the other issues are regarding the law and I also want to thank my colleagues on the on the subcommittee.

300
00:27:00,105 --> 00:27:02,966
[SPEAKER_07]: This has been a lot of work and the people that have attended the subcommittee.

301
00:27:02,986 --> 00:27:04,126
[SPEAKER_07]: This has been a lot of work and

302
00:27:05,066 --> 00:27:14,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Also to miss Branley thanking her and to know that there was a lot of people and there are a lot of people who are watching and or have been involved prior to miss Branley as we were working through this process.

303
00:27:15,371 --> 00:27:24,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Prior to it going to the policy subcommittee which unfortunately took an incident for it to get you know that far and there are other people out there in the community I know.

304
00:27:25,676 --> 00:27:28,899
[SPEAKER_07]: that have had ongoing issues as well and that we've talked to and worked with.

305
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:38,407
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want them to know that we very much care about the issue and it has been a big commitment to an important commitment and an ongoing commitment that we'll continue to have.

306
00:27:38,487 --> 00:27:44,952
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do need to make a motion to table so that I can give it my full attention and get the documents that I have not received.

307
00:27:45,032 --> 00:27:47,154
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would like a second, please.

308
00:27:48,215 --> 00:27:48,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

309
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:54,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to table is debatable by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Kreatz.

310
00:27:55,353 --> 00:27:56,333
[SPEAKER_09]: We have two hands up.

311
00:27:56,373 --> 00:28:00,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin, I just want to know if you want to withdraw until Member Graham and Ms.

312
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:02,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Branley give a comment on that.

313
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:04,998
[SPEAKER_09]: I do.

314
00:28:05,718 --> 00:28:06,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, Ms.

315
00:28:06,338 --> 00:28:06,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Branley.

316
00:28:07,078 --> 00:28:07,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.

317
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:08,679
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

318
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:09,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin?

319
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin?

320
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

321
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I will.

322
00:28:12,381 --> 00:28:13,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

323
00:28:13,301 --> 00:28:13,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

324
00:28:13,882 --> 00:28:14,122
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

325
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:18,324
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, I'm getting some feedback.

326
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:18,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

327
00:28:18,524 --> 00:28:18,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Branley?

328
00:28:18,944 --> 00:28:19,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

329
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:19,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Branley?

330
00:28:20,785 --> 00:28:24,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, I just think it's a shame to have this delayed any further.

331
00:28:26,945 --> 00:28:28,105
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a disservice to all.

332
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:32,246
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just been worked on so hard for so many months and for so many meetings.

333
00:28:33,066 --> 00:28:41,708
[SPEAKER_03]: And just before if we table or whatever is going to happen next, I just wanted to thank Member Ruseau for his kind words.

334
00:28:41,788 --> 00:28:43,748
[SPEAKER_03]: I do appreciate all of your attention in this matter.

335
00:28:45,609 --> 00:28:52,650
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank the school committee overall, and especially those that have been in the subcommittee meetings, Attorney Greenspan,

336
00:28:55,643 --> 00:29:00,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try not to get emotional, so I've written my notes so that I don't get emotional.

337
00:29:00,085 --> 00:29:08,630
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm grateful that you guys have made this meeting a priority, and including me in all the correspondence has meant a lot.

338
00:29:09,991 --> 00:29:13,373
[SPEAKER_03]: This policy revision gives me hope that the policy can be executed properly.

339
00:29:15,794 --> 00:29:21,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Our family suffered greatly by the lack of policy execution.

340
00:29:22,247 --> 00:29:27,648
[SPEAKER_03]: But to know that this policy will help reduce that extra stress in an already emotional time gives me great peace.

341
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:28,888
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to thank you all.

342
00:29:28,948 --> 00:29:34,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether we have another meeting or don't have any other meeting, I think the policy looks great.

343
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:43,211
[SPEAKER_03]: It's readable by a parent who might be in an emotional situation that can read through this and say, OK, I know what the next steps are.

344
00:29:43,291 --> 00:29:44,231
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what's going to be done.

345
00:29:44,371 --> 00:29:45,632
[SPEAKER_03]: I know who's going to handle it.

346
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:49,713
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did not see that in our 40-page document prior.

347
00:29:53,243 --> 00:29:58,464
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that I never saw the document for two months after Jacqueline had already been assaulted.

348
00:29:58,785 --> 00:30:01,525
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that we're going to do better.

349
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:02,766
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to do better.

350
00:30:02,846 --> 00:30:10,468
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to thank you all for, you know, really helping me get through this.

351
00:30:10,888 --> 00:30:13,088
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is one, just one part of it.

352
00:30:13,148 --> 00:30:14,709
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to make sure that that was said.

353
00:30:14,749 --> 00:30:15,349
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you all.

354
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:17,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

355
00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:17,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

356
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:18,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham.

357
00:30:22,915 --> 00:30:24,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, hi.

358
00:30:24,737 --> 00:30:29,021
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not in favor of tabling this or delaying this in any way.

359
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:39,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I think all policies are such that they are open to review and revision and changes at any point in time and that can happen.

360
00:30:40,211 --> 00:30:43,934
[SPEAKER_05]: But to me the value of doing this right now is that the superintendent

361
00:30:44,975 --> 00:30:49,979
[SPEAKER_05]: needs to implement this policy with some fidelity, which is something that has been sorely lacking.

362
00:30:50,520 --> 00:31:01,208
[SPEAKER_05]: And the longer that we wait to fully approve this policy, the longer it goes before she can begin her planning to make sure that every single administrator knows what their role is in this policy.

363
00:31:01,229 --> 00:31:08,595
[SPEAKER_05]: It is different in terms of the expectations of our staff, and it is not going to be a small undertaking to get

364
00:31:09,455 --> 00:31:12,897
[SPEAKER_05]: 500 and something people lined up and working in the same direction.

365
00:31:12,957 --> 00:31:22,643
[SPEAKER_05]: So I am absolutely not in favor of tabling this any further, because I don't think there's anything substantive that's going to materially change the implementation work.

366
00:31:22,803 --> 00:31:28,126
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there are small things that need to change, subsequent policy revision is always a possibility.

367
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:28,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

368
00:31:31,448 --> 00:31:32,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin.

369
00:31:33,373 --> 00:31:34,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, thank you.

370
00:31:34,814 --> 00:31:38,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to hear from members as well and from the community.

371
00:31:39,016 --> 00:31:42,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I do have to respectfully agree to disagree.

372
00:31:42,397 --> 00:31:48,600
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we've come this far with the five meetings that we had and I don't want to push something through without having had the ability to read it.

373
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:54,763
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't feel like I'd be doing due diligence to my constituents and to the people of Medford not having read it as part of the subcommittee.

374
00:31:55,183 --> 00:31:57,805
[SPEAKER_07]: I really do feel like it needs to be read and that's the important piece.

375
00:31:57,845 --> 00:32:00,366
[SPEAKER_07]: I put a lot of work into it and a lot of work before the subcommittee.

376
00:32:00,826 --> 00:32:02,328
[SPEAKER_07]: into it working with a number of families.

377
00:32:02,368 --> 00:32:08,453
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's important for every member of our school committee to be able to read the proposed policy before we can vote on and approve of it.

378
00:32:08,813 --> 00:32:15,299
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do believe that any other member of this community, the school committee, if they had not had the opportunity to read this would feel likewise.

379
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:27,490
[SPEAKER_07]: So I am respectfully asking that we table this, but I will ask and amend that we table it to the very first possible meeting in September

380
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:32,716
[SPEAKER_07]: so that it can be the first item of issue on the agenda so that we can get this moved forward.

381
00:32:33,177 --> 00:32:35,319
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that the superintendent knows that this is coming.

382
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:44,931
[SPEAKER_07]: We just need to be able to fully do our work and diligence for the community that we've been voted to do, which is reading through it and having a say on it.

383
00:32:45,071 --> 00:32:46,373
[SPEAKER_07]: I cannot vote on something

384
00:32:46,713 --> 00:33:03,162
[SPEAKER_07]: That I haven't even seen the final version of especially when I had so much input on it as a subcommittee member and also having been a family member who has experienced bullying in the community as well I really feel like it's important to take the time to be able to read this one or two more meetings is not going to make that much of a difference.

385
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:08,127
[SPEAKER_07]: And I won't feel I'm doing this in good conscience without having read through the policy.

386
00:33:08,147 --> 00:33:12,032
[SPEAKER_06]: It's unfortunate that it went elsewhere.

387
00:33:12,052 --> 00:33:14,895
[SPEAKER_06]: I can appreciate that people make mistakes.

388
00:33:15,015 --> 00:33:16,657
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm making a motion to move forward.

389
00:33:16,677 --> 00:33:19,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm asking that the question be moved forward, please.

390
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:19,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

391
00:33:23,857 --> 00:33:29,481
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, before the roll's called, you know, I feel that you should be able to read it as well.

392
00:33:30,061 --> 00:33:35,585
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also would be willing to try to find a date sometime in July where we could do a quick four o'clock meeting.

393
00:33:36,185 --> 00:33:37,626
[SPEAKER_09]: So we wouldn't have to wait till September.

394
00:33:38,547 --> 00:33:40,568
[SPEAKER_09]: So motion on the floor by Member McLaughlin.

395
00:33:40,648 --> 00:33:43,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a second by Member Hays?

396
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call, please.

397
00:33:45,611 --> 00:33:46,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Graham.

398
00:33:46,552 --> 00:33:46,752
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

399
00:33:47,753 --> 00:33:48,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Hays.

400
00:33:48,713 --> 00:33:48,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

401
00:33:50,335 --> 00:33:50,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Gratz.

402
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:51,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

403
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:53,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin.

404
00:33:54,163 --> 00:33:54,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

405
00:33:55,344 --> 00:33:56,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McDowell.

406
00:33:56,365 --> 00:33:56,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

407
00:33:59,167 --> 00:33:59,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau.

408
00:33:59,828 --> 00:34:00,048
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

409
00:34:00,368 --> 00:34:01,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor Langeau-Kern.

410
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:02,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

411
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:04,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

412
00:34:04,232 --> 00:34:11,598
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion's tabled, and we'll see if we can schedule some meeting around vacations in July.

413
00:34:11,818 --> 00:34:12,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

414
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:12,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor?

415
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:13,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau.

416
00:34:14,361 --> 00:34:16,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to schedule a special meeting.

417
00:34:18,911 --> 00:34:23,612

[SPEAKER_10]: Remember his.

429
00:35:09,961 --> 00:35:12,123
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to just ask I had to check my calendar.

430
00:35:12,163 --> 00:35:13,323
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still with July 19th.

431
00:35:14,144 --> 00:35:14,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

432
00:35:14,464 --> 00:35:15,005
[SPEAKER_10]: We're on right now.

433
00:35:15,025 --> 00:35:15,225
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_10]: Never cuts.

435
00:35:17,904 --> 00:35:18,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

436
00:35:19,365 --> 00:35:20,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin.

437
00:35:20,705 --> 00:35:20,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

438
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:22,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Mustone.

439
00:35:22,906 --> 00:35:23,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

440
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:24,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau, yes.

441
00:35:25,067 --> 00:35:25,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor Lengelker.

442
00:35:26,688 --> 00:35:28,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

443
00:35:28,688 --> 00:35:32,970
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have a meeting to take this first reading on July 19th, 4 p.m.

444
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:34,010
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor.

445
00:35:34,711 --> 00:35:40,813
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll make sure that Member McLaughlin and the whole committee gets the materials accordingly.

446
00:35:42,194 --> 00:35:42,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau.

447
00:35:44,045 --> 00:36:00,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do believe that the committee received from our executive assistant on Monday, the materials, but I would like to just say that, well, I guess I can't say it because that's what we'll do in that meeting.

448
00:36:01,113 --> 00:36:04,494
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would probably be discussing it without it being on the agenda.

449
00:36:04,714 --> 00:36:05,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevermind.

450
00:36:05,575 --> 00:36:07,556
[SPEAKER_01]: I will stop speaking.

451
00:36:07,896 --> 00:36:08,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

452
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

453
00:36:12,018 --> 00:36:12,778
[SPEAKER_02]: We are on.

454
00:36:18,034 --> 00:36:18,635
[SPEAKER_02]: stay generous.

455
00:36:20,696 --> 00:36:26,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, be recommendation to approve the 2022 2023 school year superintendent evaluation.

456
00:36:36,606 --> 00:36:37,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there emotional member?

457
00:36:37,887 --> 00:36:38,968
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, Dr Edouard-Vincent.

458
00:36:39,308 --> 00:36:41,770
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I just was saying, Mayor, that this, uh,

459
00:36:43,109 --> 00:36:49,218
[SPEAKER_08]: On the previous meeting, it was listed as minutes only and it needed to be it needed to go to an official vote.

460
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:54,906
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's, that's why it was listed on the special meeting today.

461
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:03,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, of the revised, there were slight revisions.

462
00:37:03,132 --> 00:37:06,895
[SPEAKER_08]: There were some numbers that had to be revised.

463
00:37:07,455 --> 00:37:13,018
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe there were a few comments that hadn't made it into the final evaluation.

464
00:37:13,378 --> 00:37:26,666
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to thank member Hays for coordinating all of that and sending the final revised version, which included all of the amendments or additions that the committee requested.

465
00:37:29,171 --> 00:37:29,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Hays?

466
00:37:32,432 --> 00:37:33,253
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw your hand up.

467
00:37:33,953 --> 00:37:35,274
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, I was just going to mention that.

468
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:46,478
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't sure that part of the reason also we had to come back to this was there were two changes to numbers and then there was also member Rousseau's full comment.

469
00:37:46,919 --> 00:37:54,442
[SPEAKER_00]: We added a page to put the full comment as formatted so that it's exactly how he sent it to me.

470
00:37:54,582 --> 00:37:57,343
[SPEAKER_00]: So those were the there were two numbers that needed to be updated.

471
00:37:57,861 --> 00:38:02,803
[SPEAKER_00]: and I updated those, and like I said, added a page to put in the full comments of Member Ruseau.

472
00:38:05,864 --> 00:38:06,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

473
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:10,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a motion on the floor?

474
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:15,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to approve.

475
00:38:16,347 --> 00:38:16,707

[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor Mustone?

487
00:38:39,032 --> 00:38:39,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

488
00:38:41,073 --> 00:38:43,274
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, am I saying mayor before everyone's saying member?

489
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:45,495
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, wait a minute.

490
00:38:46,336 --> 00:38:46,956
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about that.

491
00:38:47,096 --> 00:38:49,557
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you were going to say Mia, Mia, Mia.

492
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,059
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Mayor Mustone, yes.

493
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:52,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor Lungo, correct?

494
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

495
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:58,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, paper passes.

496
00:38:59,153 --> 00:39:02,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Seat approval of the fiscal year 24 operating budget.

497
00:39:03,115 --> 00:39:06,238
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, can I, this will be my first time making motion.

498
00:39:06,278 --> 00:39:09,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I make a motion about the superintendent's evaluation?

499
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:12,162
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I'm out of order doing that.

500
00:39:12,722 --> 00:39:18,386
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make a motion that we post that to the school committee page on the school district website.

501
00:39:20,307 --> 00:39:20,688
[SPEAKER_00]: Second.

502

[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call, please.

504
00:39:32,712 --> 00:39:33,132
[SPEAKER_02]: One moment.

505
00:39:37,033 --> 00:39:37,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham?

506
00:39:38,274 --> 00:39:38,494
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

507
00:39:39,934 --> 00:39:40,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Hays?

508
00:39:40,935 --> 00:39:41,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

509
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:43,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Kreatz?

510
00:39:43,836 --> 00:39:44,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

511
00:39:45,436 --> 00:39:46,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin?

512
00:39:49,418 --> 00:39:49,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

513
00:39:51,258 --> 00:39:51,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McDowd?

514
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:52,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

515
00:39:53,752 --> 00:39:54,393
[SPEAKER_02]: member of seven.

516
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,333
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Mayor Lundgren.

517
00:39:57,175 --> 00:39:57,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

518
00:39:58,776 --> 00:40:00,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

519
00:40:01,938 --> 00:40:02,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Paper passes.

520
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:08,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we'll go on to number C, approval of the fiscal year 24 MPS operating budget.

521
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:18,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a motion for approval of the final budget numbers?

522
00:40:27,165 --> 00:40:43,131
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I have a question maybe before a motion for approval, just with regards to hiring a new chief financial officer for the school department just maybe a status update on where we're at, because I just know this is a delicate budget and it's going to need.

523
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:46,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we, we are looking.

524
00:40:48,233 --> 00:40:58,658
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been in contact with MASS and speaking with other superintendents and just trying to see if we can get, it's a very, very limited pool.

525
00:40:59,578 --> 00:41:03,660
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are a lot of candidates that have financial backgrounds.

526
00:41:05,241 --> 00:41:09,263
[SPEAKER_08]: They have like a CPA licensure, but they do not have school finance.

527
00:41:10,264 --> 00:41:23,152
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are so many really critically important innuendos with school finance that the school finance administrative license is very, very limited.

528
00:41:23,653 --> 00:41:31,518
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have been working with colleagues and have put out several feelers, and we do continue to have

529
00:41:32,038 --> 00:41:43,830
[SPEAKER_08]: That position posted, but the majority of the applicants do not have the proper credentialing they have financial credentialing but they don't have school finance experience at all.

530
00:41:44,691 --> 00:41:48,414
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we are looking at all options.

531
00:41:49,895 --> 00:42:04,503
[SPEAKER_08]: including like possibly trying to get retirees or other financial school finance administrators who would take the job even if it were to be for interim like a one-year interim basis.

532
00:42:05,103 --> 00:42:08,324
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are looking at you know different options but

533
00:42:10,117 --> 00:42:15,621
[SPEAKER_08]: The pickings are slim and there are other districts that they found themselves in the same exact position.

534
00:42:16,301 --> 00:42:31,191
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're trying to think creatively about getting someone with the proper credentials to be able to come in and help us because next year will definitely be a year where we have to really start planning early.

535
00:42:33,012 --> 00:42:41,339
[SPEAKER_08]: to make sure that, you know, everyone is informed in a timely fashion and they know where we are, what's the status of our finances.

536
00:42:47,623 --> 00:42:48,484
[SPEAKER_02]: You're on mute, Mayor.

537
00:42:49,945 --> 00:42:52,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham, thank you for the update, Member Graham.

538
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:58,032
[SPEAKER_09]: And just on the update, just think we need somebody as soon as possible, even if it's just

539
00:42:58,919 --> 00:43:01,722
[SPEAKER_09]: finance background that can be doing the accounting.

540
00:43:01,742 --> 00:43:04,225
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we want a school finance person.

541
00:43:05,767 --> 00:43:09,211
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to make sure that this budget is managed accordingly.

542
00:43:09,231 --> 00:43:12,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Fingers crossed we find somebody.

543
00:43:12,915 --> 00:43:13,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham?

544
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

545
00:43:16,981 --> 00:43:17,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I agree.

546
00:43:17,741 --> 00:43:36,630
[SPEAKER_05]: I also wonder if you can recirculate to us the position description, because maybe there is something about the way the position's being described that can be adjusted, especially like our last assistant superintendent of finance and operations had a very broad scope of responsibility.

547
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:40,232
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess the question is whether that continues to be

548
00:43:42,437 --> 00:43:53,286
[SPEAKER_05]: what we must have or what we would like to have and where does the position description sort of describe the set of responsibilities to perhaps be more appealing to candidates.

549
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,568
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you could send that around, that would be great.

550
00:43:57,409 --> 00:44:08,298
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my other question about the budget was, what does this budget account for in terms of increases for non-unit employees?

551
00:44:10,163 --> 00:44:15,045
[SPEAKER_05]: So in other words, is there money in the budget for compensation increases for non-unit employees?

552
00:44:15,125 --> 00:44:16,085
[SPEAKER_05]: And if so, how much?

553
00:44:17,746 --> 00:44:28,770
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a little space where we have compensation allocated for non-unit employees.

554
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:30,030
[SPEAKER_08]: How much?

555
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:35,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if we were to be looking at all of

556
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:44,643
[SPEAKER_08]: The totals, depending on what the committee will end up approving or not approving, we should be able to cover it.

557
00:44:45,723 --> 00:44:50,765
[SPEAKER_05]: But is it a 2% compensation increase for non-unit employees, or is it something else?

558
00:44:50,885 --> 00:44:56,007
[SPEAKER_08]: For the majority of non-unit employees, we have 2% allocated.

559
00:44:56,827 --> 00:45:05,190
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are a few individual contracts that are in the process of being renegotiated as we speak.

560
00:45:06,397 --> 00:45:07,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

561
00:45:07,598 --> 00:45:08,958
[SPEAKER_09]: How much do we have set aside?

562
00:45:13,061 --> 00:45:13,801
[SPEAKER_02]: And in what account?

563
00:45:15,642 --> 00:45:27,489
[SPEAKER_08]: With the non-unit increases, we would have that coming out of the undistributed account, our undistributed errors and omissions.

564
00:45:28,189 --> 00:45:31,011
[SPEAKER_08]: That is where we place

565
00:45:37,142 --> 00:45:45,008
[SPEAKER_02]: some of our anticipated salary line items.

566
00:45:48,691 --> 00:45:50,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we know how much is in that account?

567
00:45:51,873 --> 00:46:01,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now, it's slightly over 500,000, and we're still negotiating a few of our contracts, unsettled contracts.

568
00:46:03,936 --> 00:46:04,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

569
00:46:04,396 --> 00:46:05,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Gramey, hands still up.

570
00:46:06,056 --> 00:46:30,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Approximately for all, for the non-unit employees, we're probably in the vicinity of 120,000 to include the raises from the different departments across the district and level setting some salaries that were not level set for several years.

571
00:46:32,352 --> 00:47:01,307
[SPEAKER_08]: So right-sizing salaries that are not competitive with our neighboring districts and colleagues, which is something where, you know, we're subject to people being recruited to go to other districts, good people that you wanna hold on to because other districts are able to recruit them at significantly higher rates.

572
00:47:08,937 --> 00:47:09,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Mayor.

573
00:47:10,018 --> 00:47:14,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham, yes.

574
00:47:15,644 --> 00:47:26,596
[SPEAKER_05]: So before I make a motion to approve this budget, I just want to reiterate that this budget is really fragile and it is going to require

575
00:47:29,298 --> 00:47:33,921
[SPEAKER_05]: really sharp management of every single penny that's being spent in the district.

576
00:47:34,341 --> 00:47:48,529
[SPEAKER_05]: That includes contractors, consultants, everybody, how we bring new folks on board, what their salaries are, like every last penny is gonna need to be watched very carefully over the next year.

577
00:47:48,549 --> 00:47:53,052
[SPEAKER_05]: And we cannot be on June 28th next year,

578
00:47:55,033 --> 00:48:13,158
[SPEAKER_05]: At a point where we're just finally able to approve the budget because we have a just a tremendous amount of work to do with the exhaustion of Esther there's 28 people on Esther funds and that work has to start as quickly as it possibly can to really look at the organization structure and ask.

579
00:48:14,457 --> 00:48:32,055
[SPEAKER_05]: ourselves, what about this structure serves students and what doesn't, so that we can start to make decisions that are in the best interest of students and deal with the reality of coming off of an amount of money that is just no longer going to be available to us.

580
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:39,498
[SPEAKER_05]: will be in the fall putting forward a series of resolutions to make sure that this work is happening proactively.

581
00:48:39,518 --> 00:48:48,190
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the meantime, I, with lots of hesitation in my heart, make a motion to approve the budget.

582
00:48:50,601 --> 00:48:51,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

583
00:48:51,802 --> 00:49:13,788
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to second what your your comments to so if it's looking like CFO is, even if we adjust the job description and give it give it a few weeks if we're still not getting the applicants that we look at bringing out I know Michelle's going to be deep in the budget and managing as best she can but she's going to need help.

584
00:49:14,388 --> 00:49:16,449
[SPEAKER_09]: A second set of eyes and somebody that's

585
00:49:18,101 --> 00:49:26,230
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, has that ability to manage and do the job that needs to be done here.

586
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:31,897
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just feel like we're going to need to find, you know, some sort of an accountant or somebody.

587
00:49:32,437 --> 00:49:34,680
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know on the city side, we went through this

588
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:42,194
[SPEAKER_09]: where we didn't have a CFO for many months and it just can be extremely difficult to manage.

589
00:49:42,254 --> 00:49:46,156
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm hoping that we can get updated on it throughout the summer.

590
00:49:46,636 --> 00:49:50,698
[SPEAKER_09]: So we know if we've been able to bring somebody on and what their capacity is.

591
00:49:53,019 --> 00:49:58,982
[SPEAKER_09]: So motion for approval by member Graham, seconded by- Seconded.
