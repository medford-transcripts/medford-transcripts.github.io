23

[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

24
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:18,736
[SPEAKER_05]: So what the governor Baker's March, March 12th, 2020 order suspending certain provisions of the open meeting law.

25
00:01:19,873 --> 00:01:28,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Chapter 38, section 18 of the governor's March 15th, 2020 order, imposing strict limitation on the number of people that may gather in one place.

26
00:01:29,081 --> 00:01:35,247
[SPEAKER_05]: This meeting of the Medford City Council will be conducted via remote participation to the greatest extent possible.

27

[SPEAKER_05]: No person in attendance or members of the public will be permitted, but every, every effort will be made to ensure that the public can actually access the proceedings in real time by a technical, technological means.

[SPEAKER_05]: In the event that we are unable to do so, despite best efforts, we will post on the city of Medford or the media community media's website, an audio or video recording transcript, a rather comprehensive record of the proceedings as soon as possible after the meeting.

33
00:02:34,174 --> 00:02:34,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

34
00:02:39,497 --> 00:02:43,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

35
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:59,971
[SPEAKER_05]: 21013 offered by Councilor Morell, be it resolved that the method that the City Council request an update from the administration on any engagement with the City of Somerville regarding traffic mitigation and potential parking issues relative to proposed marijuana dispensary in Ball Square.

36
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:01,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Morell.

37
00:03:06,124 --> 00:03:06,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Morell.

38
00:03:07,363 --> 00:03:07,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

39
00:03:08,024 --> 00:03:10,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hear me now?

40
00:03:11,026 --> 00:03:11,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

41
00:03:11,586 --> 00:03:12,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

42
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:13,708
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you all for bearing with me.

43
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:18,972
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a pretty straightforward resolution as has come to the attention of many of us.

44
00:03:19,092 --> 00:03:26,698
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a marijuana dispensary seeking to locate in the ball square neighborhood in Somerville, which, you know, that is for the city of Somerville to work out.

45
00:03:26,798 --> 00:03:31,742
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course, ball square is densely populated and part of it lies in the city of Medford.

46
00:03:32,323 --> 00:03:34,985
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's also increasing interest in the area in general.

47
00:03:35,886 --> 00:03:39,470
[SPEAKER_06]: due to the expected Green Line Extension Station that's going to be there.

48
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:53,406
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to thank Jim Silva from SMARTO and many other things for doing a great job leading some fact finding information on the plans for the dispensary and any plans they have for parking and traffic mitigation plans.

49
00:03:53,727 --> 00:03:54,768
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know Todd Blake

50
00:03:55,328 --> 00:03:58,349
[SPEAKER_06]: the city traffic engineer has also been looped in.

51
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:05,232
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do know that some of these parking plans reference parking lots that are in the city of Medford.

52
00:04:05,732 --> 00:04:14,776
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, regardless of the size of the parking lot, the size of the dispensary, it is going to, if approved, increase traffic in this area in Medford.

53
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:16,537
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just seeking that the administration

54
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:30,860
[SPEAKER_06]: provide an update to the council as far as any work that has been done to be in touch with the city of Somerville administration and see if there's any kind of updates on the mitigation plans and anything that we can advocate for on our side.

55
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,560
[SPEAKER_06]: So I move approval.

56
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:39,242
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if the chief of staff has anything he can, I don't know if he has anything he can add at this time, but I move approval.

57
00:04:40,342 --> 00:04:41,704
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Morell.

58
00:04:41,724 --> 00:04:42,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

59
00:04:43,186 --> 00:04:43,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli.

60
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:44,487
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

61
00:04:44,948 --> 00:04:54,959
[SPEAKER_11]: I did, after reading this resolution, I did contact representatives from Somerville, talked to the director of OCD, and it was very enlightening.

62
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,703
[SPEAKER_11]: There is, right now, the only

63
00:05:00,277 --> 00:05:07,659
[SPEAKER_11]: parking that is relegated to these dispensaries are only off on street parking.

64
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:10,320
[SPEAKER_11]: So there really isn't any designated parking.

65
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:16,702
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't feel the need that there will be for the fact that they look like they'll be having nine host agreements.

66
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Nine.

67
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:21,063
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're looking at their philosophies.

68
00:05:21,163 --> 00:05:31,452
[SPEAKER_11]: The dispensaries are going to be looked at as a neighborhood package store in the same sense that residents will have the opportunity to visit.

69
00:05:31,773 --> 00:05:40,460
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a small mom and pop type establishments they're looking at that's economically empowered for local residents.

70
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Mom and pop storefront,

71
00:05:44,103 --> 00:05:45,645
[SPEAKER_11]: and spread out throughout their community.

72
00:05:46,565 --> 00:06:02,776
[SPEAKER_11]: They really like they like the big piece is that they're looking that you're looking out probably about six months minimal before they start seeing these shops open.

73
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:07,279
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we have some time but from what I gather there isn't much

74
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:14,372
[SPEAKER_11]: There isn't much input on parking lots or anything like that.

75
00:06:14,432 --> 00:06:35,219
[SPEAKER_11]: They expect that it will not be, they do not envision what happened in Brookline with the overcrowding in the neighboring areas being over, over impacted, but it's something that they were very open for future discussions with the council, making sure that they take,

76
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,662
[SPEAKER_11]: the residents of South Medford and keeping them informed if they do see some changes.

77
00:06:41,742 --> 00:06:45,665
[SPEAKER_11]: And I really appreciate them answering a lot of questions for me.

78
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:55,010
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that, uh, cause it is, it is a worry if you're looking at what happened in Brookline when that first opened and, um, you know, what it, what it brings to that neighborhood.

79
00:06:56,031 --> 00:07:03,455
[SPEAKER_11]: And then again, the biggest, uh, the biggest, um, solution to this is let's open our, um,

80
00:07:05,232 --> 00:07:19,745
[SPEAKER_11]: our recreational shops here in Medford, and our residents will be hopefully going to do their business in our districts and the districts that we relegated for business.

81
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:28,572
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, I thank them and hope that helps any residents of Medford that has some questions with their concerns.

82
00:07:28,692 --> 00:07:29,893
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you, Mr. President.

83
00:07:30,174 --> 00:07:31,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

84
00:07:31,555 --> 00:07:32,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion?

85
00:07:35,025 --> 00:07:37,207
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Morell, seconded by?

86
00:07:37,227 --> 00:07:40,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

87
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

88
00:07:48,056 --> 00:07:48,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Bears.

89
00:07:49,377 --> 00:07:49,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

90
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:51,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco.

91
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:51,919
Yes.

92
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Knight.

93
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:54,261
Yes.

94
00:07:55,121 --> 00:07:55,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks.

95
00:07:56,362 --> 00:07:56,502
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

96
00:07:57,263 --> 00:07:57,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Morell.

97
00:07:58,504 --> 00:07:58,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

98
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:00,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

99
00:08:00,566 --> 00:08:00,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

100
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:01,787
[SPEAKER_02]: President Quiravilla.

101
00:08:02,547 --> 00:08:06,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, 7 in the affirmative, motion passes.

102
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:20,096
[SPEAKER_05]: 21014, offered by Vice President Knight, Councilor Markson, Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved that the Medford City Council request an update from Hallmark Health, Circle Health, relative to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital site.

103
00:08:20,136 --> 00:08:20,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

104
00:08:21,437 --> 00:08:22,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

105
00:08:24,124 --> 00:08:45,268
[SPEAKER_09]: During the process of transition from the Lawrence Memorial Hospital to the ambulatory surgical care center that we're presently working with, this council initiated a series of meetings where Hallmark Health would have the opportunity, or Circle Health would have the opportunity to come down and present to us where they are in the stages of the plan, what the neighborhood mitigation plans have been, and so forth.

106
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,649
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's time that we bring these meetings back to

107
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:49,529
[SPEAKER_09]: the forefront, Mr. President.

108
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,330
[SPEAKER_09]: We've seen construction at the hospital go fairly well.

109
00:08:53,011 --> 00:08:54,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Some signage has been erected.

110
00:08:54,791 --> 00:09:04,014
[SPEAKER_09]: We've seen some shovels in the ground, some construction equipment, and some mitigation issues arise that we've been able to take care of concerning fences and pathways and the like.

111
00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:10,256
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it's important, Mr. President, that as we near the finish line, that we begin the dialogue and the engagement once again.

112
00:09:10,296 --> 00:09:13,478
[SPEAKER_09]: So I ask that my council colleagues support this measure and move for approval.

113
00:09:14,678 --> 00:09:15,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

114
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:17,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

115
00:09:18,962 --> 00:09:20,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

116
00:09:20,683 --> 00:09:27,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and I want to thank my colleagues, vice president, um, night and Councilor Scarpelli, uh, for putting this on the agenda.

117
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:37,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, do we have a representative, uh, from, uh, we do not, um, Councilor Marks, uh, Ryan Ford did send me a letter, asked me, asked me to read it into the record.

118
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, and he will be welcoming.

119
00:09:40,328 --> 00:09:42,129
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want him to come next week, he'll come next week.

120
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:44,769
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh, I do have a wreck, uh, letters to read into the record.

121
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:47,090
[SPEAKER_05]: If you allow me to read it now, or you want me to wait till the ends.

122
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:52,677
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can wait to the, if you can wait after the 2016 resolution, if you can, Mr. President.

123
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:53,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

124
00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:53,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

125
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause I think their letter refers to item 21-016.

126
00:09:56,181 --> 00:09:56,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

127
00:09:56,982 --> 00:10:05,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Not this paper, but I was curious, Mr. President, because as council vice president, um,

128
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:10,515
[SPEAKER_10]: Knight adequately stated that there has been a lot of change at Lawrence Memorial.

129
00:10:11,656 --> 00:10:15,498
[SPEAKER_10]: The parking lot, the structure itself, signage.

130
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:22,943
[SPEAKER_10]: However, Mr. President, when they do come up before the council, I would hope they can answer a few questions.

131
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:30,608
[SPEAKER_10]: I received two calls from community advisory group members, which is the CAG group.

132
00:10:31,148 --> 00:10:39,994
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was established to get direct abutters and area residents to give input to the hospital during this entire process.

133
00:10:40,695 --> 00:10:51,583
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's my understanding from talking to a few of the CAG members that it started out pretty good and the input was there from area residents.

134
00:10:52,603 --> 00:11:11,037
[SPEAKER_10]: in this CAG committee and then slowly but surely it started to dissipate and some of the members feel that they're not involved or at least advised on what's happening in the latest and greatest updates and they have some concern Mr. President.

135
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:16,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Also this council voted unanimously on a couple of conditions

136
00:11:17,382 --> 00:11:18,343
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, just recently.

137
00:11:19,164 --> 00:11:24,468
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of them was the icebox that's, um, on the top of the building.

138
00:11:25,289 --> 00:11:36,298
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, it was stated at the time that, uh, due to, I guess, uh, the fire department's request that that icebox couldn't be contained with an outer wall and so forth.

139
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:38,260
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not disputing that.

140
00:11:38,961 --> 00:11:41,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, that is a fire safety concern.

141
00:11:42,003 --> 00:11:43,384
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, that was raised.

142
00:11:43,665 --> 00:11:44,065
[SPEAKER_10]: However,

143
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:50,300
[SPEAKER_10]: The CAG was under the impression that the box itself would be

144
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:59,375
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, a different, uh, aesthetically pleasing exterior would be put on the surrounding of this box.

145
00:11:59,895 --> 00:12:02,715
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do agree when you go out, I, it does stick out.

146
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:10,417
[SPEAKER_10]: I know they try to do some painting and so forth, but the box definitely sticks out and it's not aesthetically pleasing to the neighborhood.

147
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:18,739
[SPEAKER_10]: So, uh, I would ask once again, Mr. President, when they come up that, uh, that issue of the icebox be revisited.

148
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:29,361
[SPEAKER_10]: on behalf of not just this council, but the members of the CAG who have asked repeatedly that something be done with that, Mr. President.

149
00:12:29,701 --> 00:12:39,924
[SPEAKER_10]: There was also some concern about construction materials that are left in the parking lot, including heavy equipment that's been in the parking lot.

150
00:12:40,304 --> 00:12:47,726
[SPEAKER_10]: And if that equipment is no longer being utilized, and if the materials are no longer being utilized, residents would ask that

151
00:12:49,506 --> 00:12:54,568
[SPEAKER_10]: construction equipment and materials be moved in the interest of public safety.

152
00:12:55,489 --> 00:13:06,193
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would just ask Mr. President when they do come before us that they open the lines of communication with the CAG group who is the eyes and ears of the community and this council.

153
00:13:06,773 --> 00:13:18,200
[SPEAKER_10]: And if they feel slighted, Mr. President, that doesn't speak well for what's taking place and the oversight that the neighborhood and director butters should have regarding this entire process.

154
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,741
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to put that out there, Mr. President.

155
00:13:21,261 --> 00:13:26,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, the facility does, in my opinion, uh, I'm very pleased with how it generally looks.

156
00:13:27,605 --> 00:13:27,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Um,

157
00:13:28,085 --> 00:13:31,447
[SPEAKER_10]: The configuration of the lot I think will be workable.

158
00:13:32,168 --> 00:13:37,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the signage that has been put out there I think will assist with safety concerns.

159
00:13:38,092 --> 00:13:45,938
[SPEAKER_10]: The other issue that was not addressed, Mr. President, is the issue that was brought up by many members of this council was the ADA access.

160
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:54,862
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know we requested that our ADA monitor in the city review ADA access within that facility and that a study be done.

161
00:13:55,322 --> 00:14:09,808
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would ask that part of this paper, if my colleagues would indulge me, that we send this back to the city administration because that was a condition that was laid on the approval of the ambulatory care center.

162
00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:12,830
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would ask that that, um,

163
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:17,773
[SPEAKER_10]: ADA access, an update on that report, Mr. President.

164
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:19,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Update on ADA access?

165
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:20,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

166
00:14:20,615 --> 00:14:24,477
[SPEAKER_05]: And all those amendments?

167
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:25,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'd like to get an update.

168
00:14:25,918 --> 00:14:27,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I'd like to get an update on that.

169
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:30,702
[SPEAKER_05]: And would you like to request that Ryan Fuller come to next week's meeting also?

170
00:14:31,122 --> 00:14:36,706
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's what Councilor Knight has requested, so I would agree with that.

171
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:52,725
[SPEAKER_10]: But I want to make sure, Mr. President, that they have a week to discuss the issues of the lack of communication, the icebox, and the equipment that's on the lot, as well as the ADA issues that were brought up during the conditions approval.

172
00:14:55,317 --> 00:14:57,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, please.

173
00:14:58,401 --> 00:14:59,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

174
00:14:59,141 --> 00:15:02,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, thank you, Vice President Knight and Council Marks.

175
00:15:02,405 --> 00:15:06,390
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is something that the three of us have been getting phone calls.

176
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,532
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I won't, I won't, uh,

177
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:17,647
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't repeat what my fellow colleagues have mentioned because these are the same concerns that residents have shared with me, but here we are.

178
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:26,489
[SPEAKER_11]: We started a little slow and then we rallied around the community and with the leadership team and it really picked up.

179
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:38,832
[SPEAKER_11]: The transparency was there, the big word, and everybody was involved and here we are on the one foot line and ready to close up and here we go with another, some more concerns and I think this is,

180
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:51,581
[SPEAKER_11]: Your first impressions are important, but you also want to make sure that that last taste is something that's just as important, because that's the final product that's left in the neighbor's lap.

181
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:57,565
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's important that we follow through with these initiatives and resolutions and these amendments that were put through.

182
00:15:58,185 --> 00:16:02,268
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hope that, and I think they will, they've been very responsible with that.

183
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:10,354
[SPEAKER_11]: The organization comes back with their team with some good results for next week's meeting.

184
00:16:10,374 --> 00:16:11,315
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you, Mr. President.

185
00:16:12,176 --> 00:16:12,436
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

186
00:16:12,456 --> 00:16:13,757
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco.

187
00:16:13,897 --> 00:16:14,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

188
00:16:14,778 --> 00:16:18,000
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to also thank my colleagues for bringing this resolution forward.

189
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,744
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this is a project, uh, like councilor Scarpelli said, it started off a little bit rough.

190
00:16:23,384 --> 00:16:26,887
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I think once we got going and we had a ton of community involvement,

191
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:28,227
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the key.

192
00:16:28,928 --> 00:16:49,340
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we all work together and we have, we have meetings every month with the hospital and, uh, it is long overdue that we do have a meeting with them as well to bring us up to date on everything that's going on the timelines on, uh, various pieces of this project because you know, there is some, most of it's done, but there's still more work that needs to be done in the parish, the parent, the, um,

193
00:16:50,467 --> 00:17:02,161
[SPEAKER_00]: the neighbors should be notified with regard to those timelines and the hospital should be available to answer any questions that the members of the community and the neighbors have.

194
00:17:03,002 --> 00:17:04,603
[SPEAKER_00]: So if my colleagues,

195
00:17:06,557 --> 00:17:15,941
[SPEAKER_00]: Council colleagues wouldn't mind if I could amend this also to, if we could have a robo call and go out to the residents in that neighborhood.

196
00:17:16,481 --> 00:17:19,822
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that's what we did in the past.

197
00:17:19,922 --> 00:17:20,823
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be consistent.

198
00:17:21,283 --> 00:17:31,387
[SPEAKER_00]: We always invited the residents to this meeting and there was tons of resident participation, especially when we had residents here in the chambers, but they should be, people should be,

199
00:17:32,447 --> 00:17:45,297
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, notified of this meeting, um, like, uh, we were saying, uh, we haven't heard from the hospital in a while and a resident should be, uh, there to ask questions, uh, with regard to the progress of this particular project.

200
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:54,384
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I may, uh, if I may offer a B paper as well, if we could, uh, uh, get some sort of an update from, uh, from this group with regard to the Malden hospital as well.

201
00:17:54,985 --> 00:17:55,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I didn't get that.

202
00:17:56,286 --> 00:17:57,006
[SPEAKER_00]: Malden hospital.

203
00:17:58,367 --> 00:18:00,629
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could get an update with regard to the Malden hospital.

204
00:18:00,689 --> 00:18:00,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

205
00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:01,250
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

206
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,008
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd offer that as a B paper.

207
00:18:04,108 --> 00:18:04,729
[SPEAKER_04]: On a B paper.

208
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Second, Mr. President.

209
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:08,211
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

210
00:18:09,132 --> 00:18:10,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Mayes, did you want to speak?

211
00:18:11,194 --> 00:18:13,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, I'm seconding Councilor Falco's B paper.

212
00:18:13,195 --> 00:18:25,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so, on the motion by Vice President Knight, as amended by Councilor Marks, and as also amended by Councilor Felkel,

213
00:18:27,516 --> 00:18:30,597
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have a B paper by Councilor Falco.

214
00:18:30,617 --> 00:18:32,318
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to vote on the B paper first.

215
00:18:32,338 --> 00:18:38,119
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the B paper as proposed by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Bears.

00:18:47,862 --> 00:18:48,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

224
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:50,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks?

225
00:18:50,323 --> 00:18:50,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

00:18:57,425 --> 00:18:58,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

00:19:08,152 --> 00:19:08,392

[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

243
00:19:19,719 --> 00:19:20,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Knight?

244
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,040
Yes.

245
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:22,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks?

246
00:19:23,481 --> 00:19:24,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Morell.

247
00:19:24,641 --> 00:19:24,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

248
00:19:25,342 --> 00:19:26,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

249
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:26,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_05]: So the affirmative motion passes.

253
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:39,266
[SPEAKER_05]: I will, uh, uh, uh, reach out to Ryan for tomorrow and requested, uh, he'd be at the meeting, uh, with, with, with, with all the information requested.

254
00:19:39,947 --> 00:19:40,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

255
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:59,098
[SPEAKER_05]: 21015, offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the City Council receive an update on the most recent site visit and Councilor recommendations at Fulton Spring Road and Murray Hill Road neighborhood regarding speeding and cut through traffic as well as pedestrian safety.

256
00:19:59,138 --> 00:19:59,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

257
00:20:02,188 --> 00:20:03,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

258
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:09,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Paper 20-625 was offered by myself several weeks back.

259
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:20,069
[SPEAKER_10]: It was regarding having an on-site committee of the whole meeting at Fulton Spring Road, which we did on Saturday, November 21st at 11 AM.

260
00:20:22,611 --> 00:20:39,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Every member of the council was present along with the mayor, DPW commissioner, and traffic engineer, and the city engineer, as well as a number of residents, Mr. President.

261
00:20:40,099 --> 00:20:41,780
[SPEAKER_10]: And there were a number of issues discussed.

262
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,781
[SPEAKER_10]: The council offered a number of recommendations.

263
00:20:45,822 --> 00:20:53,347
[SPEAKER_10]: be sent to the Traffic Commission and the City Administration, of which some were done pretty quickly.

264
00:20:54,028 --> 00:20:57,050
[SPEAKER_10]: There was striping done at some of the intersections.

265
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:08,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Just recently at the top of Vista Rav, where there was concern about a rotary at the top of Vista Rav, that was highlighted by some markings and signage.

266
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:10,420
[SPEAKER_10]: So there was some

267
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:15,842
[SPEAKER_10]: positive moves made from this meeting that we had.

268
00:21:16,303 --> 00:21:25,947
[SPEAKER_10]: However, Mr. President, there was also a recommendation made by myself that we reconvene two weeks after the November 21st meeting.

269
00:21:26,707 --> 00:21:28,268
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have yet to meet.

270
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:32,170
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand it was Christmas and New Year's and it was a

271
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,932
[SPEAKER_10]: very difficult time to get together.

272
00:21:35,332 --> 00:21:48,704
[SPEAKER_10]: However, I wanted to make sure that we did not drop the ball on this, and that's why I'm offering tonight that we find out where we stand on a number of the recommendations that were made, Mr. President.

273
00:21:49,444 --> 00:22:04,307
[SPEAKER_10]: One in particular, which residents keep calling me on, is the fact that one of the recommendations that was made was put forth by myself and offered by myself and a resident, Mr. Bailey.

274
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:16,310
[SPEAKER_10]: We asked, and it was approved by this council, that we erect limit access signs at Fell's Ave, Marley Hill Road, Fulton Spring Road, Terrace Road,

275
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:22,595
[SPEAKER_10]: and Grover Road in the morning and afternoon peak hours in both directions.

276
00:22:23,396 --> 00:22:26,158
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was a key point, Mr. President.

277
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,263
[SPEAKER_10]: It was great that we were able to put some signage up and we were able to paint some markings.

278
00:22:31,763 --> 00:22:32,744
[SPEAKER_10]: some crosswalks.

279
00:22:33,324 --> 00:22:38,747
[SPEAKER_10]: However, the issue that I'm hearing still from residents is the speeding cut through traffic.

280
00:22:39,387 --> 00:22:44,750
[SPEAKER_10]: If you were to rate it on a scale of one to 10, to me, that issue is the 10.

281
00:22:45,251 --> 00:22:53,775
[SPEAKER_10]: That is the most important issue that I'm hearing from residents in the area, that the speeding cut through traffic is of utmost concern.

282
00:22:54,316 --> 00:22:56,897
[SPEAKER_10]: So I ask once again, Mr. President, and this was voted

283
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:08,786
[SPEAKER_10]: unanimously by the Medford City Council at that Committee of the Whole on the 21st, that once again, we direct this back to the city and to, um,

284
00:23:10,602 --> 00:23:29,341
[SPEAKER_10]: the traffic commission requesting that resident only limit access signs be placed at Falzav, Murray Hill Road, Fulton Spring Road, Terrace Road, and Grover Road in the interest of public safety during peak morning and afternoon hours in both directions.

285
00:23:31,162 --> 00:23:36,484
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is not a first, this has been done in many sections of the community.

286
00:23:37,464 --> 00:23:39,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Enforcement is very important as well.

287
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:51,668
[SPEAKER_10]: You can put up all the signage, but it's important that we also ask that increased enforcement coupled with these signs take place in that area to help ease concerns.

288
00:23:52,448 --> 00:23:54,711
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to read off a few, Mr. President.

289
00:23:55,031 --> 00:23:59,176
[SPEAKER_10]: I went through the committee report, and it's been a month and a half now.

290
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:09,447
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think it's important to remember what's being done currently with some of the striping and signage, and what the request was of residents.

291
00:24:09,487 --> 00:24:11,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Because all too often, we bring things up.

292
00:24:12,794 --> 00:24:14,056
[SPEAKER_10]: And they get forgotten about.

293
00:24:14,796 --> 00:24:19,481
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to make sure that this council, and I know we will stay on top of this.

294
00:24:20,022 --> 00:24:27,570
[SPEAKER_10]: So speeding and consistent police presence with cut through traffic.

295
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:32,934
[SPEAKER_10]: was a concern that was raised over and over again according to the committee report.

296
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:37,197
[SPEAKER_10]: That we suppress certain streets from the Waze app.

297
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:48,785
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe it was mentioned by the traffic engineer, Todd Blake, that they only do it regarding construction purposes.

298
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:58,374
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd like to get more involved and see what we can do, because this is clearly not a construction purpose.

299
00:24:58,654 --> 00:25:00,255
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a public safety purpose.

300
00:25:00,775 --> 00:25:05,738
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that would trump construction work with ways.

301
00:25:06,118 --> 00:25:07,559
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm not quite sure why.

302
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,202
[SPEAKER_10]: public safety would take a backseat.

303
00:25:11,324 --> 00:25:14,268
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we need that looked at again.

304
00:25:15,089 --> 00:25:16,891
[SPEAKER_10]: Difficulty getting out of the driveways.

305
00:25:17,352 --> 00:25:24,422
[SPEAKER_10]: I think if we are able to stop this cut through traffic, I think that'll solve some of the concerns with residents getting out of their driveway.

306
00:25:24,722 --> 00:25:27,525
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have to tell Councilor Falco about that.

307
00:25:27,806 --> 00:25:29,768
[SPEAKER_10]: He deals with it on a daily basis.

308
00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:34,173
[SPEAKER_10]: The radar feedback signs installed in the neighborhood.

309
00:25:35,474 --> 00:25:39,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Residents were looking for additional radar feedback signs.

310
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,721
[SPEAKER_10]: As I mentioned, more police presence.

311
00:25:42,221 --> 00:25:44,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Concerns on parking on the sidewalks.

312
00:25:44,844 --> 00:25:51,928
[SPEAKER_10]: And that still takes place up in many sections of the city, in particular in the heights, because of some of the narrow streets and so forth.

313
00:25:52,228 --> 00:25:57,612
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of sidewalk parking, which poses a concern for residents that may have to go into the street.

314
00:25:58,172 --> 00:26:00,433
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's a public safety concern, Mr. President.

315
00:26:01,114 --> 00:26:03,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop signs at Rockland Road and Fels Ave.

316
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:08,278
[SPEAKER_10]: I know there were a number of residents there that were pushing that, Mr. President.

317
00:26:08,998 --> 00:26:12,861
[SPEAKER_10]: And the confusion about the rotary at the top of Vista Ave.

318
00:26:13,861 --> 00:26:24,006
[SPEAKER_10]: from what I hear has now been somewhat resolved with additional markings and a sign that was put at that rotary to better define the area.

319
00:26:24,686 --> 00:26:28,748
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to thank the DPW and Todd Blake for moving forward in that.

320
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:38,253
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would hope Mr. President that this council stays on top of this issue and that we receive through my motion tonight requesting that the

321
00:26:39,073 --> 00:26:48,400
[SPEAKER_10]: traffic commission and the city administration look at the limited access signs on the roads that I mentioned already that we stay on top of this very important issue.

322
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Marks, is that an amendment for those signs?

323
00:26:50,841 --> 00:26:51,822
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Mr. President.

324
00:26:51,982 --> 00:26:52,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

325
00:26:52,503 --> 00:26:53,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, do you have that?

326
00:26:54,564 --> 00:26:55,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Falco.

327
00:26:56,045 --> 00:26:56,966
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

328
00:26:57,686 --> 00:27:00,408
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Councilor Marks, for bringing this resolution forward.

329
00:27:00,608 --> 00:27:01,829
[SPEAKER_00]: This is before.

330
00:27:03,449 --> 00:27:15,765
[SPEAKER_00]: When President Caraviello and I were going back and forth with regard to issues or meetings that need to be scheduled in January, sent him a list of meetings that kind of were

331
00:27:17,101 --> 00:27:18,081
[SPEAKER_00]: related to last year.

332
00:27:18,141 --> 00:27:26,745
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, you know, this, in one of these, actually, this was part of the email that I sent to President Caraviello saying we need to make sure we stay on top of this and schedule meetings.

333
00:27:26,785 --> 00:27:30,827
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would hope that that's going to be coming up soon.

334
00:27:30,847 --> 00:27:36,869
[SPEAKER_00]: I, as someone who lives in that neighborhood, have noticed they have made some improvements.

335
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:43,052
[SPEAKER_00]: There has been some striping that has been done, signs that have been added, but of course there's more work to be done.

336
00:27:43,732 --> 00:27:52,078
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it'll be interesting to get an update from the administration with regard to short-term and long-term solutions, what's been done, what needs to be done.

337
00:27:52,098 --> 00:28:08,369
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I could amend this as well to, that we have a reverse 9-1-1 going to the residents, the same residents basically that we sent the reverse 9-1-1 to when we had the original committee, the whole meeting back in November.

338
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,151
[SPEAKER_00]: That meeting was well attended.

339
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:11,011
[SPEAKER_00]: It was,

340
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:19,258
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nice to actually have that many residents there and talking about the traffic and the issues that are happening in that neighborhood.

341
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:21,459
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know we promised them that we would follow up.

342
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:29,381
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we could have a reverse 9-1-1 going out to those same residents, so they know that we're on top of this.

343
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,241
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they have any questions, they can ask those same questions.

344
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:38,163
[SPEAKER_00]: And Councilor Marks, if I may, are we going to invite the same people, same department heads as we did last time?

345
00:28:39,757 --> 00:28:41,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you asking for an onsite meeting or just?

346
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:43,220
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.

347
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:47,302
[SPEAKER_00]: On the, when we have the updated, when we have the committee of the whole to update.

348
00:28:47,322 --> 00:28:47,863
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be great.

349
00:28:48,703 --> 00:28:49,324
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent idea.

350
00:28:49,364 --> 00:28:49,584
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

351
00:28:49,604 --> 00:28:55,448
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I could, if I could amend it as well to invite the department heads that we invited last time.

352
00:28:55,468 --> 00:29:01,672
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we could all, if we could have the chief of police was invited last time, but if he, if he cannot make it,

353
00:29:02,392 --> 00:29:07,257
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can have Sergeant Hartnett, someone from the Traffic Enforcement Division.

354
00:29:07,817 --> 00:29:11,321
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone really needs to be there to represent the police department.

355
00:29:11,421 --> 00:29:15,605
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I could amend that to have those people invited, that'd be great.

356
00:29:16,185 --> 00:29:19,689
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Marks, thank you for bringing this forward and I would second that motion.

357
00:29:21,227 --> 00:29:22,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scott Belli.

358
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:22,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

359
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:25,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, thank you, Councilor Marks, bringing this forward.

360
00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:26,790
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is very important.

361
00:29:27,971 --> 00:29:34,214
[SPEAKER_11]: As we see, when the community gets involved and the council work together, I think a lot of great things happen.

362
00:29:34,934 --> 00:29:39,937
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have seen some changes, but I think that we need to keep rolling and making sure that

363
00:29:40,837 --> 00:29:47,018
[SPEAKER_11]: There are some serious safety issues that follow through and completed in the very near future.

364
00:29:47,058 --> 00:30:02,602
[SPEAKER_11]: If we can, if Council Marks has a mind, if we can amend that, I know I brought it up many a times and I'm seeing it in neighboring communities and we talked about it there at the site visit that looking at the raised bumps,

365
00:30:04,743 --> 00:30:09,147
[SPEAKER_11]: and striping that area to see if what that cost analysis would be.

366
00:30:10,068 --> 00:30:18,434
[SPEAKER_11]: If we can have the city administration get back to us, the traffic engineer, to see what that would look like and how that would look like going up.

367
00:30:19,635 --> 00:30:22,836
[SPEAKER_11]: through that Fulton area.

368
00:30:22,896 --> 00:30:28,678
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's important that could really help the traffic calming measures.

369
00:30:28,738 --> 00:30:39,180
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that we discussed raised crosswalks there, but cost is an issue and different construction and ADA issues that are questionable.

370
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:44,562
[SPEAKER_11]: But we can add from what we were told that day that putting those

371
00:30:45,862 --> 00:30:54,207
[SPEAKER_11]: the not speed bumps or raised raised roads per se that would help mitigate some of that, the speeding issue.

372
00:30:54,248 --> 00:30:58,350
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we can amend that to the paper, I appreciate that.

373
00:30:58,951 --> 00:31:00,291
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, thank you for bringing this forward.

374
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:01,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

375
00:31:02,773 --> 00:31:03,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Any, any further discussion?

376
00:31:04,975 --> 00:31:05,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

377
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:06,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Biz.

378
00:31:07,624 --> 00:31:08,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

379
00:31:08,624 --> 00:31:13,327
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you, Councilor Marks, for bringing this forward and keeping us on track.

380
00:31:13,387 --> 00:31:20,830
[SPEAKER_04]: And Councilor Falco, Councilor Scarpelli, I will say I live nearby and was able to drive up there.

381
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:26,092
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was the first time I actually felt confident driving at the intersection of Fells Vista and Fulton Springs.

382
00:31:26,253 --> 00:31:29,114
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the improvements are good, but we need to keep going.

383
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:33,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I couldn't quite tell if this was included in another amendment.

384
00:31:33,656 --> 00:31:52,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I would also like to know if, uh, the, to amend the paper to ask, uh, the police department if they have done increased enforcement in the area and, uh, if there's any data or, um, you know, anecdotal data about, uh, what kind of traffic stops they're making in the area.

385
00:31:54,629 --> 00:31:55,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Buenaventura.

386
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:56,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further discussion?

387
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:58,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President.

388
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:01,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

389
00:32:01,388 --> 00:32:14,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, while we have this, uh, meeting that I appreciate council Falco calling for, um, also, and I brought this up in the past to 40 Salem street, uh, the building apartment building that was put up there.

390
00:32:15,758 --> 00:32:29,421
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, there were several promises made, uh, to area residents that live on, uh, Everett and, uh, Connors, Everett and Salem, uh, regarding curbing, uh, on the street, sidewalk, uh, and so forth.

391
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:40,804
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's important, Mr. President, that these promises when they met with the neighborhood, when the development met back some year and a half ago and promised X, Y, and Z that we follow through, Mr. President.

392
00:32:41,144 --> 00:32:41,884
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would ask that 240,

393
00:32:42,924 --> 00:32:47,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Salem Street be added to the conversations when we discuss these other issues as well.

394
00:32:48,865 --> 00:32:49,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

395
00:32:49,726 --> 00:32:50,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion?

396
00:32:51,766 --> 00:33:06,229
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, as amended by Councilor Marks, as amended by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, and again amended by Councilor Bears, and again amended by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Falco.

397
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

398
00:33:12,715 --> 00:33:13,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Bears.

399
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:14,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

400
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:15,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco.

401
00:33:15,857 --> 00:33:16,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

402
00:33:17,138 --> 00:33:17,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Knight.

403
00:33:18,238 --> 00:33:18,519
Yes.

404
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:19,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks.

405
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:20,600
Yes.

406
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:21,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Morell.

407
00:33:22,241 --> 00:33:22,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

408
00:33:22,861 --> 00:33:23,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

409
00:33:23,662 --> 00:33:23,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

410
00:33:24,242 --> 00:33:25,463
[SPEAKER_02]: President Caraviello.

411
00:33:25,623 --> 00:33:25,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

412
00:33:25,883 --> 00:33:26,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven in the affirmative.

413
00:33:27,084 --> 00:33:27,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

414
00:33:28,765 --> 00:33:37,630
[SPEAKER_05]: 21016 offered by Councilor Maks and Councilor Scarpelli be it resolved that the most recent site is posted on Governor's Ave, Lawrence Road and Forest Street be discussed.

415
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Maks.

416
00:33:41,504 --> 00:33:47,969
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to thank my council colleague, Councilor Scarpelli, for co-offering this resolution.

417
00:33:48,690 --> 00:34:02,521
[SPEAKER_10]: We both received, and I'm sure members of the council also received, a number of phone calls over the last week and a half with a number of new signs that have been popping up on Lawrence Road, Governor's Ave, and Forest Street.

418
00:34:03,262 --> 00:34:07,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Many residents saw some spray painting on the sidewalks.

419
00:34:07,425 --> 00:34:12,528
[SPEAKER_10]: to indicate maybe some utility work or possible signage going up.

420
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:17,231
[SPEAKER_10]: But they were never notified or didn't know what was going to happen in front of their homes.

421
00:34:18,792 --> 00:34:34,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Just recently, Mr. President, the city, in conjunction with Lawrence Memorial Hospital, entered into an agreement based on a traffic study that was done by Lawrence Memorial Hospital and also a traffic study that was done by the city of Medford.

422
00:34:34,962 --> 00:34:41,905
[SPEAKER_10]: regarding traffic calming initiatives with the new ambulatory care center that's going at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

423
00:34:42,645 --> 00:34:47,187
[SPEAKER_10]: So some additional signage was recommended, which I support 1,000%.

424
00:34:47,227 --> 00:34:50,128
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to let that be known.

425
00:34:50,688 --> 00:35:01,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the signs that went up, in particular, these radar traffic signs that went up didn't make any sense, the placement of the signs.

426
00:35:01,612 --> 00:35:15,078
[SPEAKER_10]: The one on Lawrence Road, which was coming around the bend from Forest Street, was about maybe 200 feet into Lawrence Road, right before a speed hump.

427
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:18,340
[SPEAKER_10]: It just made zero sense, Mr. President.

428
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,023
[SPEAKER_10]: And after a few phone calls, I know Councilor Scarpelli and I'm sure other members of the council made some phone calls.

429
00:35:25,463 --> 00:35:30,324
[SPEAKER_10]: to the traffic engineer, Todd Blake, and had a discussion with the mayor.

430
00:35:30,965 --> 00:35:41,027
[SPEAKER_10]: They looked into the four signs that were put up at the recommendation of this traffic study, but the launch board hired a vendor that put these signs up.

431
00:35:41,747 --> 00:35:43,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Come to find out all four signs were put

432
00:35:44,288 --> 00:35:51,435
[SPEAKER_10]: in the wrong space, in the wrong area, some not even remotely close to where they should have been placed.

433
00:35:52,176 --> 00:36:03,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Needless to say, right away, I have to say, the city got on top of it, and they reached out to Lawrence, and Lawrence reached out to their vendor, and these signs were moved within a matter of a day or two.

434
00:36:04,547 --> 00:36:06,549
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to thank them for that, Mr. President.

435
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:09,692
[SPEAKER_10]: In addition to the additional signage,

436
00:36:10,893 --> 00:36:25,732
[SPEAKER_10]: residents were concerned about the number of signs, the excessive number of signs on the roads in their particular neighborhood, turning some areas, some stretches, into what would look like Route 1.

437
00:36:26,293 --> 00:36:27,134
[SPEAKER_10]: That many signs.

438
00:36:27,715 --> 00:36:46,020
[SPEAKER_10]: So I went down to Lawrence Road, the stretch from Forest Street to Governor's Ave, and I counted a total on both sides, a total of, and that small stretch, it's probably five to 600 feet from Forest to Governor's Ave on Lawrence Road.

439
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,881
[SPEAKER_10]: I counted 14 signs.

440
00:36:51,096 --> 00:36:55,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Some signs are needed, they're necessary, but there were some signs that were excessive.

441
00:36:56,499 --> 00:37:07,265
[SPEAKER_10]: I think to have two signs notifying residents on each side, or drivers on each side of the street, that there's a speed hump, I think is excessive.

442
00:37:08,425 --> 00:37:15,131
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's not there's not one on Winthrop Street for the speed hump to signs notifying It just seems excessive.

443
00:37:15,171 --> 00:37:15,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President.

444
00:37:16,232 --> 00:37:28,683
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some outdated signage that still exists regarding a school that we used to have at the top of the Fulton school and not the Fulton school on the top of governor's

445
00:37:29,464 --> 00:37:32,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Forest Park at the top of Governor's Ave.

446
00:37:33,148 --> 00:37:48,602
[SPEAKER_10]: There's still signage on Lawrence Road for crossing students and you could tell these signs are from the 60s and 70s and there's no crosswalk there anymore there's just signs and

447
00:37:49,683 --> 00:37:58,708
[SPEAKER_10]: We received the correspondence from the city that DPW just recently removed some of this excessive signage that's around, Mr. President.

448
00:37:59,128 --> 00:38:06,232
[SPEAKER_10]: And I ask that they keep on removing some of the excessive signage around the community that's not needed.

449
00:38:06,512 --> 00:38:08,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes when you have a plethora of signs,

450
00:38:09,648 --> 00:38:11,149
[SPEAKER_10]: you might as well not put up any at all.

451
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:19,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Because one after another, after another, is gonna do nothing to reduce speed, to make people aware of what's gonna happen, to make crossing safer.

452
00:38:20,193 --> 00:38:22,154
[SPEAKER_10]: It's gonna do absolutely nothing, Mr. President.

453
00:38:22,454 --> 00:38:24,455
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just gonna be a blur of signage.

454
00:38:24,795 --> 00:38:27,216
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that's what we're seeing in certain stretches.

455
00:38:27,836 --> 00:38:32,978
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, I wanna thank Councilor Scarpelli, I know he has a lot to say on this too, for putting this on.

456
00:38:33,298 --> 00:38:38,681
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wanna thank the city administration and Lawrence Memorial Hospital for their quick action on this.

457
00:38:40,124 --> 00:38:40,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Marksley.

458
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:47,150
[SPEAKER_05]: If I can be moved by Councilor Scarpelli, I'd like to read into a record a letter from the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

459
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:56,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear President Caraviello, we are writing in response to an agenda item that was brought to our attention on January 12th at the Medford City Council meeting.

460
00:38:56,958 --> 00:39:00,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Item 21016 calls to the attention a four-speed

461
00:39:01,642 --> 00:39:11,026
[SPEAKER_05]: feedback signs placed on Governor's Ave, Lawrence Road, and Lawrence Memorial Hospital campus, as part of the speed reduction efforts developed in coordination with the Medford Traffic Commission.

462
00:39:11,926 --> 00:39:18,369
[SPEAKER_05]: These four signs were inadvertently installed in the wrong location due to a miscommunication with the subcontractor.

463
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:25,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Upon hearing the signs were installed in the wrong locations, we worked to rectify the situation.

464
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:33,131
[SPEAKER_05]: The four signs were reinstalled in the locations previously approved by the city of Medford on January 11th.

465
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:39,837
[SPEAKER_05]: We are sending a notice to our email distribution, notifying them of the error and the correction.

466
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:42,640
[SPEAKER_05]: We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

467
00:39:43,408 --> 00:39:49,731
[SPEAKER_05]: The installation of speed feedback signs is part of the traffic mitigation requested within the special permit.

468
00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:57,836
[SPEAKER_05]: We are pleased that this work has been completed in collaboration with the Bepatrack Traffic Commission in response to the community's request.

469
00:39:59,087 --> 00:40:05,811
[SPEAKER_05]: As shared in our end of the year notice, the construction of the new inventory care center is now completed.

470
00:40:06,211 --> 00:40:10,874
[SPEAKER_05]: The hospital's main lobby renovation is still underway and scheduled to be finished next month.

471
00:40:11,414 --> 00:40:16,037
[SPEAKER_05]: And a seasonal landscape and another final parking lot finish will be completed in the spring.

472
00:40:17,478 --> 00:40:26,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Currently, our efforts and resources are focused on the present COVID-19 surge, but we look forward to providing regular updates at future council meetings

473
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:29,709
[SPEAKER_05]: and continue to engage our community advisory group.

474
00:40:29,749 --> 00:40:35,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Respectfully, Ryan Fuller, Vice President of Strategy and Business Planning, Melrose-Wayfield Healthcare.

475
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,670
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to read that into the record.

476
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:39,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

477
00:40:39,531 --> 00:40:40,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

478
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:41,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for reading that in the record.

479
00:40:41,911 --> 00:40:43,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, thank you, Councilor Marks.

480
00:40:43,912 --> 00:40:47,033
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't be redundant, but again, these are the phone calls we were getting.

481
00:40:47,053 --> 00:40:52,014
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe there was some feedback to the constituents that this is something that the council voted for.

482
00:40:52,872 --> 00:40:55,496
[SPEAKER_11]: The council requested these signs to be put in.

483
00:40:55,876 --> 00:40:57,278
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the furthest from the truth.

484
00:40:57,338 --> 00:41:08,393
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that once we talked to the city administration, once our traffic engineers and everybody got involved, I think you saw some drastic changes.

485
00:41:09,927 --> 00:41:21,372
[SPEAKER_11]: The biggest concern is you're taking the look of a very quaint, historical neighborhood and really changing it to the point where it looked more urban with all these signs.

486
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:27,735
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that was one of the concerns and Councilor Marks hits a nail on the head when it

487
00:41:28,515 --> 00:41:30,877
[SPEAKER_11]: look like Route 1 in a sense.

488
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:41,345
[SPEAKER_11]: The raised speed bumps or the raised streets, I think that whether people like them or not, I think they're important because especially when you're talking about

489
00:41:43,607 --> 00:41:48,350
[SPEAKER_11]: people that aren't residents, but people that are cutting through Medford are increasing their speed in that area.

490
00:41:48,811 --> 00:41:50,612
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to bring the speed down.

491
00:41:50,652 --> 00:42:00,699
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the same time, what we're seeing in neighboring communities, especially more in the suburban communities that have these, you see the painting on the roadways, not signage on the sidewalks.

492
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,581
[SPEAKER_11]: So, and that does the job.

493
00:42:03,681 --> 00:42:05,822
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that Council Member Mox is right.

494
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:10,105
[SPEAKER_11]: When there's too many signs, it's redundant and becomes more of a distraction to people.

495
00:42:10,185 --> 00:42:12,007
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I think that

496
00:42:13,308 --> 00:42:16,470
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, as soon as this came forward, we did have a conversation with the mayor.

497
00:42:17,651 --> 00:42:22,776
[SPEAKER_11]: She did direct her staff to make sure that these were corrected.

498
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:32,664
[SPEAKER_11]: And the Meadows Wakefield site and the Lawrence Memorial representatives worked quickly to make sure those are rectified.

499
00:42:33,165 --> 00:42:40,291
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, as we move forward, we, you know, we continue to monitor the number of signs of putting on around the community.

500
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:42,012
[SPEAKER_11]: We know what they're important.

501
00:42:42,052 --> 00:42:55,383
[SPEAKER_11]: We know that we need a safety mitigation is very important, but at the same time there's got to be a collaboration with the neighborhood to make sure we don't lose its charm at the same time.

502
00:42:55,483 --> 00:43:01,749
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, I think Councilor Marks are bringing this forward and thank all the parties for moving this in the right direction.

503
00:43:02,269 --> 00:43:02,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

504
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:03,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

505
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:03,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Constable.

506
00:43:04,491 --> 00:43:05,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Any further discussion?

507
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:11,734
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, as amended by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

508
00:43:11,794 --> 00:43:12,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President.

509
00:43:12,735 --> 00:43:13,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks.

510
00:43:13,776 --> 00:43:19,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, just if I could, before you call the roll, uh, cause Councilor Scarpelli just jogged my, my memory on that.

511
00:43:19,821 --> 00:43:24,426
[SPEAKER_10]: The, uh, the raised speed bump, he's thousand percent correct.

512
00:43:25,046 --> 00:43:26,287
[SPEAKER_10]: It blends in with the street.

513
00:43:26,367 --> 00:43:27,789
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually hot top.

514
00:43:28,089 --> 00:43:28,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

515
00:43:28,629 --> 00:43:36,959
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's such a slight raise, and I'm sure it's done according to whatever the engineering specs are, but it's very difficult.

516
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:42,566
[SPEAKER_10]: I know there's signage indicating there's a speed hump, but it's very difficult to know that it's there.

517
00:43:43,247 --> 00:43:48,053
[SPEAKER_10]: And the intent is not to sneak up on people and say, ha ha, we got you on a speed hump.

518
00:43:48,813 --> 00:43:51,574
[SPEAKER_10]: It's to let people know that it's there so they can slow down.

519
00:43:52,175 --> 00:44:01,299
[SPEAKER_10]: And after standing out there for a good 15 to 20 minutes, when I was walking with one of the residents, we didn't see many tail lights, you know, brake lights.

520
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:05,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone was just going right over it, like it didn't exist, to be honest with you.

521
00:44:06,361 --> 00:44:15,185
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it would be helpful, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, to maybe have a directional white arrow or something that delineates the edges

522
00:44:15,605 --> 00:44:24,029
[SPEAKER_10]: like we do up on Winthrop Street, that shows that there's a raised hump, a speed hump, whatever you want to call it, that exists there.

523
00:44:24,389 --> 00:44:34,414
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that will go a long way for residents to slow down when they see something, an impediment in the road, rather than just, it looks like there's nothing there.

524
00:44:35,194 --> 00:44:42,578
[SPEAKER_10]: And really, I've done it myself actually, going over it, and you don't realize it until you're on the top of it and say, geez, I just hit this thing again.

525
00:44:43,758 --> 00:44:44,739
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's not the intent.

526
00:44:44,759 --> 00:44:46,680
[SPEAKER_10]: The intent is to slow down ahead of time.

527
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,360
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President.

528
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:59,867
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would ask if we can make a part of the committee report that, um, that we send this, uh, to the, uh, Todd Blake and ask them that they paint or put some design on it or something to make it more noticeable.

529
00:45:00,987 --> 00:45:01,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

530
00:45:01,328 --> 00:45:01,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Mark.

531
00:45:01,888 --> 00:45:02,628
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

532
00:45:03,449 --> 00:45:08,011
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Marks as amended by Councilor Marks and seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

533
00:45:08,411 --> 00:45:09,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

550
00:45:30,058 --> 00:45:32,760
[SPEAKER_05]: 21017 offered by Councilor Marks being resolved.

551
00:45:33,767 --> 00:45:40,470
[SPEAKER_05]: that the city council receive a breakdown of the total amount collected from the water and sewer base fee charge since inception in 2017.

552
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:55,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it further resolved that the breakdown include commercial versus resident residential fees collected and whether these fees and whether said fees are held separately or combined with the water and sewer surplus monies.

553
00:45:55,557 --> 00:45:56,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

554
00:45:57,678 --> 00:45:58,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

555
00:45:58,898 --> 00:46:00,259
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is really,

556
00:46:01,212 --> 00:46:21,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Follow up, back in 2017, as my resolution alluded to, this method city council at the recommendation of the city administration at the time and the water sewer commissioners asked for the council to vote on a proposed baseline charge for water and sewer services.

557
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:29,065
[SPEAKER_10]: And the explanation that we received at the time was to assist with stabilizing the water and sewer budget.

558
00:46:30,425 --> 00:46:49,751
[SPEAKER_10]: One could debate that until the cows come home because we, for many years, have looked at a $5 to $6 million surplus in the water and sewer enterprise accounts, which would indicate to me that we are overcharging water and sewer rate payers in order to have a slush fund available.

559
00:46:50,611 --> 00:46:55,573
[SPEAKER_10]: So that the issue of stabilizing the budget could be debated.

560
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:59,174
[SPEAKER_10]: However, Mr. President, the base rate at the time,

561
00:46:59,994 --> 00:47:03,917
[SPEAKER_10]: which was implemented was based on your meter size.

562
00:47:04,617 --> 00:47:08,699
[SPEAKER_10]: And most residential homeowners have the same meter size.

563
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:18,225
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the size water pipe that's coming into your home that indicates the $8.61 base rate that you pay.

564
00:47:18,685 --> 00:47:23,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Commercial would have a larger water pipe coming in, and they would pay a higher rate.

565
00:47:23,968 --> 00:47:25,629
[SPEAKER_10]: So the vast majority of residents,

566
00:47:26,749 --> 00:47:28,310
[SPEAKER_10]: We're paying the $8.61.

567
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:31,830
[SPEAKER_10]: The charge was a bimonthly charge.

568
00:47:32,471 --> 00:47:45,073
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you do the math, the 861 times 6 would bring you to an annual $51.66 that this base rate was charging residents.

569
00:47:47,354 --> 00:47:53,095
[SPEAKER_10]: I still have not yet to receive any answer other than stabilizing a budget.

570
00:47:53,796 --> 00:47:55,156
[SPEAKER_10]: What residents get for this?

571
00:47:56,216 --> 00:47:59,138
[SPEAKER_10]: additional tax, I would call it a tax.

572
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,523
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's important, Mr. President, that we receive an update.

573
00:48:04,563 --> 00:48:05,924
[SPEAKER_10]: This has been three years now.

574
00:48:06,944 --> 00:48:11,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Indeed, has this been successful in stabilizing the budget?

575
00:48:11,428 --> 00:48:21,776
[SPEAKER_10]: If so, I'd like that explained to me by the city administration, by the finance director, the water and sewer commissioners, and also the questions that were asked, Mr. President.

576
00:48:22,176 --> 00:48:24,118
[SPEAKER_10]: about a breakdown of where the funds go.

577
00:48:24,498 --> 00:48:31,584
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe it's very vital if the funds are co-mingled with the Water and Sewer Enterprise account money, we should know that.

578
00:48:31,984 --> 00:48:48,417
[SPEAKER_10]: If not, if they're held in a separate account, is that account used to offset projects that are happening in the community, leak detection, INI, and a breakdown by commercial versus residential fees that are collected.

579
00:48:51,757 --> 00:48:53,698
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that about covers it, Mr. President.

580
00:48:54,879 --> 00:49:00,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Tonight we have a very distinguished Method resident that would like to speak on this.

581
00:49:01,302 --> 00:49:13,389
[SPEAKER_10]: A former colleague of ours who served on this council with distinction for three decades, over three decades, is here tonight to speak on this, Mr. President.

582
00:49:13,669 --> 00:49:19,092
[SPEAKER_10]: So I had asked that my former colleague, Councilor Penta, be able to speak on this, Mr. President.

583
00:49:19,632 --> 00:49:20,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

584
00:49:23,645 --> 00:49:24,466
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, no, I'm good, thank you.

585
00:49:25,346 --> 00:49:26,747
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I'm good, thanks.

586
00:49:28,188 --> 00:49:29,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, fellow Councilor Bempton.

587
00:49:29,449 --> 00:49:30,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record, please.

588
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:32,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have to leave the mask on or can I take it off?

589
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,812
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could leave it on, it would be appreciated.

590
00:49:34,252 --> 00:49:34,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Say it again?

591
00:49:34,832 --> 00:49:36,293
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could leave it on, it would be appreciated.

592
00:49:36,834 --> 00:49:37,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

593
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:39,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Marksley.

594
00:49:39,155 --> 00:49:39,596
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate it.

595
00:49:39,616 --> 00:49:41,517
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you can hear me, if it makes it any clearer.

596
00:49:42,658 --> 00:49:50,363
[SPEAKER_08]: What Councilor Marksley has alluded to has brought me into this issue of public accounting as to what took place as it related to this

597
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:53,672
[SPEAKER_08]: connectivity fee, that's what it was called.

598
00:49:54,373 --> 00:50:02,682
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was implemented in August of 2017, and for the last three years, it has brought in in excess of $3 million to the city of Medford.

599
00:50:03,872 --> 00:50:14,374
[SPEAKER_08]: And having that at $3 million and not knowing how and what it's been used for, and if it was going to be an adjunct to the water and sewer system here in the city of Medford, then so be it.

600
00:50:14,954 --> 00:50:23,576
[SPEAKER_08]: We always get in advance from the MWRA their projected assessment as to what the city is going to be charged for water and sewer charges.

601
00:50:24,136 --> 00:50:26,497
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is built in your annual budget each and every year.

602
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:35,403
[SPEAKER_08]: And each and every year since then, the projection that this could be possibly used for a deficit has never happened because we're still dealing with the surplus.

603
00:50:36,084 --> 00:50:43,889
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think what Councilman Marks is alluding to is the fact that, you know, if you've collected $3 million, what have you used it for, number one?

604
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:46,491
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you have projected for its use?

605
00:50:47,072 --> 00:50:48,513
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the cost for it?

606
00:50:48,893 --> 00:50:52,456
[SPEAKER_08]: And more importantly, if it is separate from water and sewer, so be it.

607
00:50:53,196 --> 00:50:57,520
[SPEAKER_08]: As we know that you can't take the money from water and sewer because that's considered to be retained earnings.

608
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:04,786
[SPEAKER_08]: And the only way you can get through retained earnings is to the Department of Revenue to get a waiver and 90% of the time that they will give it to you.

609
00:51:05,287 --> 00:51:16,696
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is something that has led me after the resolution went on, if you can just bear with me, to other things that unfortunately the council and the public have not been apprised of and brought forward.

610
00:51:17,597 --> 00:51:22,385
[SPEAKER_08]: This base fee charge at a minimum of $51.66 annually, that's on the house side.

611
00:51:22,405 --> 00:51:23,948
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what the commercial side would be.

612
00:51:24,489 --> 00:51:28,255
[SPEAKER_08]: But if in fact it's bringing in approximately a million dollars a year, so be it.

613
00:51:30,143 --> 00:51:38,186
[SPEAKER_08]: If you look at your most recent tax bill here in the city of Medford, which is for the third quarter, they implemented a new system with a new vendor.

614
00:51:38,706 --> 00:51:41,827
[SPEAKER_08]: And the new vendor has really got this bill basically messed up.

615
00:51:41,867 --> 00:51:48,850
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be changed because they made a big mistake on it, especially when it gets to the tax itself and it talks about your CPA tax.

616
00:51:50,423 --> 00:52:02,773
[SPEAKER_08]: If you think about what's going on, and if you think about the taxes here that are going on here in the city of Medford, what can we do to some degree to help the Medford taxpayer as to what's going on and everything that's going on?

617
00:52:03,413 --> 00:52:07,897
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I would like to just introduce to you is something for you to think about.

618
00:52:08,437 --> 00:52:11,159
[SPEAKER_08]: When you look at your water and sewer tax.

619
00:52:11,479 --> 00:52:13,401
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could hold on a second, we've got a little glitch here.

620
00:52:21,099 --> 00:52:21,459
[SPEAKER_05]: We all set?

621
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

622
00:52:23,281 --> 00:52:23,581
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

623
00:52:23,901 --> 00:52:24,161
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

624
00:52:24,422 --> 00:52:30,586
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can look at your water and sewer bill, and if you can look at your tax bill, I'd like to introduce something for the council entertainers.

625
00:52:30,626 --> 00:52:34,009
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called a deadline discount program.

626
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:48,360
[SPEAKER_08]: And a deadline and discount program, which is implemented in a lot of states and a lot of counties, that the month that you get the bill, your tax bill, for example, you get your tax bill in November, and I believe it's due February 1st.

627
00:52:49,181 --> 00:52:50,121
[SPEAKER_08]: The next one is February 1st.

628
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:55,303
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you pay it on the month that you receive it, there's a 4% discount on your bill.

629
00:52:56,043 --> 00:53:00,324
[SPEAKER_08]: The next month, which would be January, there would be a 3% discount.

630
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:04,005
[SPEAKER_08]: And the city in itself would be getting its money quicker.

631
00:53:04,125 --> 00:53:08,185
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the same time, the taxpayer would be getting a break as it relates to that.

632
00:53:08,806 --> 00:53:10,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Same thing as it relates to your water and sewer bill.

633
00:53:11,306 --> 00:53:15,767
[SPEAKER_08]: If you get your water and sewer bill, it's usually six or seven weeks out before you pay it.

634
00:53:16,247 --> 00:53:20,568
[SPEAKER_08]: And the month that you get it, or the month before, you get a 4% discount if you pay for it ahead of time.

635
00:53:21,368 --> 00:53:26,152
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a thought, but it does work because it gets the city money quicker before you get it quicker.

636
00:53:27,052 --> 00:53:34,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Pinellas County in Florida, one of many counties, have implemented that and they've shown a marketable increase, a marketable increase.

637
00:53:35,271 --> 00:53:47,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Another thing, Mr. President, when we talk about the city's unfunded liability, for which this council, I can go back to 2014, Resolution 214725 was offered by myself.

638
00:53:47,906 --> 00:53:53,694
[SPEAKER_08]: And that particular resolution asked that on an annual basis, the city of Metra take out of its free cash a minimum

639
00:53:54,094 --> 00:53:59,375
[SPEAKER_08]: of $500,000 toward then in fund liability of $29 million.

640
00:53:59,976 --> 00:54:01,976
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea what the unfunded liability is.

641
00:54:02,316 --> 00:54:13,179
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think this council has any idea of what the balance is and how much each and every year has been taken out of the budget for the purposes of getting to that unfunded liability, which has to be paid by 2029.

642
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:20,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Another thing for which the taxpayers and the council should be aware of waste management.

643
00:54:21,688 --> 00:54:33,012
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know if you guys are aware of it, but in March of 2014, then Mayor McGlynn signed an extension, a three-year extension to the waste management contract in the City of Medford.

644
00:54:33,652 --> 00:54:35,633
[SPEAKER_08]: And that three-year extension went as follows.

645
00:54:36,353 --> 00:54:39,694
[SPEAKER_08]: For the first year, the City of Medford would get $300,000 in cash.

646
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:41,455
[SPEAKER_08]: The second year, they would get $100,000 more.

647
00:54:41,475 --> 00:54:42,415
[SPEAKER_08]: That's $400,000 from 2014 going forward.

648
00:54:42,435 --> 00:54:44,336
[SPEAKER_08]: But the catch to the whole thing was as follows.

649
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:59,761
[SPEAKER_08]: The amendment was, if you remember correctly, for those who did serve back then, recycling was an issue here in the city of Medford.

650
00:55:00,362 --> 00:55:02,626
[SPEAKER_08]: And at that point in time, when the contract was signed, we were at 11%.

651
00:55:04,638 --> 00:55:10,901
[SPEAKER_08]: At some point in time, the city worked itself up to a 29% inventory of recycling.

652
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:28,588
[SPEAKER_08]: But as a result of the city signing off on a three-year extension, what took place there was that the city of Medford allowed waste management, allowed waste management to increase our cost of recycling on an annual basis projected at

653
00:55:30,978 --> 00:55:37,526
[SPEAKER_08]: $85 per ton, and then it would set itself on an annual basis increase, according to the city of Boston, beginning on July 1st, 2015.

654
00:55:41,082 --> 00:55:44,746
[SPEAKER_08]: That's almost six months, that's almost a good year after the contract was signed.

655
00:55:45,386 --> 00:55:53,675
[SPEAKER_08]: And as a result of that, each and every year, the city of Medford has been being charged more for recycling than they had been according to the original agreement.

656
00:55:54,596 --> 00:56:01,763
[SPEAKER_08]: So for $300,000, $400,000 that the city got paid up front, the cost of recycling has gone forward.

657
00:56:02,103 --> 00:56:13,433
[SPEAKER_08]: And once this contract ends in the year 2023, yeah 2023, all the recycling bins, all the recycling bins that the people have in this city will come under the control of the city of Medford.

658
00:56:13,833 --> 00:56:15,755
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll own it and not waste management.

659
00:56:16,536 --> 00:56:21,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Another thing that I believe, Mr. President, needs to really be discussed is the CPA.

660
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:29,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Once again, taxpayers on an annual basis are at a cost of approximately $103, according to your household, in the value of your home.

661
00:56:30,427 --> 00:56:34,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the CPA, as we all know, five years are up.

662
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:40,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Any time after five years, according to the law, as it's written, that question can go back on the ballot.

663
00:56:41,094 --> 00:56:44,757
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would strongly suggest that this council put that question back on the ballot.

664
00:56:45,197 --> 00:56:57,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Because when it was first elected in 2015, 1,200 people did not vote on the question because it was on the backside of the ballot, and they didn't know that the question was there to be asked.

665
00:56:59,147 --> 00:57:01,508
[SPEAKER_08]: $103, think about that, annually for CPA.

666
00:57:02,089 --> 00:57:11,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you think about the $51 and the connectivity fee, and you put that together with maybe the discounts on paying for your taxes, it would be a great help to the city of Medford and to the taxpayers.

667
00:57:12,736 --> 00:57:13,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, Mr. President,

668
00:57:15,025 --> 00:57:15,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Cable costs.

669
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:20,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Our cable bills from the residents of this community keep going up each and every year.

670
00:57:21,087 --> 00:57:21,987
[SPEAKER_08]: They just went up again.

671
00:57:22,848 --> 00:57:26,949
[SPEAKER_08]: But they also have a 5% franchise fee in that cable bill.

672
00:57:27,529 --> 00:57:35,732
[SPEAKER_08]: You folks have not got an update on what that increase has brought to the city of Medford and where that money has gone, at least for the last four or five years.

673
00:57:36,072 --> 00:57:38,453
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that's something that Councilor Marks had brought up before.

674
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:41,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we get to the parking issues, Mr. President.

675
00:57:41,594 --> 00:57:42,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President.

676
00:57:42,987 --> 00:57:45,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Morocco.

677
00:57:46,589 --> 00:57:52,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought we were addressing an agenda item on water and sewer fees, so I'm a little lost right now.

678
00:57:54,633 --> 00:58:02,615
[SPEAKER_08]: This presented itself, Mr. President, onto other issues which could be beneficial to the taxpayers, and it would be a public accounting so people could become aware of it.

679
00:58:02,655 --> 00:58:03,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Penta?

680
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:03,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

681
00:58:04,155 --> 00:58:06,376
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could just stick to the war and soar.

682
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:11,957
[SPEAKER_05]: If you'd like to speak later on public participation of these other issues, you're more than happy to do that.

683
00:58:11,977 --> 00:58:12,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we're almost done.

684
00:58:13,017 --> 00:58:14,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you mind if I can just figure it out?

685
00:58:14,437 --> 00:58:15,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's unfortunate.

686
00:58:15,818 --> 00:58:16,658
[SPEAKER_08]: You know something?

687
00:58:16,678 --> 00:58:19,118
[SPEAKER_08]: You're supposed to seize the moment as the moment is.

688
00:58:19,138 --> 00:58:22,059
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're talking about the people of our community, what they have to pay.

689
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:27,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, at the same time, if we can offer them a benefit, and at the same time, the City gets a benefit.

690
00:58:27,643 --> 00:58:30,065
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a matter of being creative and looking at what you have.

691
00:58:30,746 --> 00:58:31,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Parking information.

692
00:58:31,746 --> 00:58:42,555
[SPEAKER_08]: You, Mr. President, you have asked on numerous occasions, numerous occasions for a report on how many tickets have been issued, how many have been abated, how much money has been collected, and how much has been given to the City of Medford.

693
00:58:43,496 --> 00:58:46,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me, none of you can do that because it's never been presented.

694
00:58:46,699 --> 00:58:51,243
[SPEAKER_08]: And what about the $50,000 that was supposed to go to each and every square here in the City of Medford?

695
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:52,960
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not there.

696
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:58,241
[SPEAKER_08]: The accounting for the squares hasn't come under any control as to what we're doing.

697
00:58:58,741 --> 00:59:06,503
[SPEAKER_08]: And lastly, Mr. President, if we all remember at the inaugural, we were told that seniors in this city would not have to pay any more to park in the city of Medford.

698
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:08,464
[SPEAKER_08]: That still hasn't come to fruition.

699
00:59:09,044 --> 00:59:17,006
[SPEAKER_08]: That's unfair, because you can't make a promise like that and not keep it, because that's what people look at, what your responsibilities are.

700
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:22,187
[SPEAKER_08]: I say this tonight, Mr. President, as I told you before, taxes pay for what makes this city run.

701
00:59:23,328 --> 00:59:25,570
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the same time, the city has a responsibility back.

702
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:29,974
[SPEAKER_08]: But if it can be a two hand, shaken hands compromise, why not?

703
00:59:31,057 --> 00:59:36,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Discounts to your water and sewer bill, discount to your cable bills, finding out where that money went.

704
00:59:37,301 --> 00:59:38,782
[SPEAKER_08]: And let's get back to the original thing.

705
00:59:38,802 --> 00:59:48,888
[SPEAKER_08]: The connectivity fee that was supposed to be helpful here to the city of Medford, you've never had a report where it's going, how much it's brought in, what projects, if anything, and how much it's gonna cost.

706
00:59:49,408 --> 00:59:56,913
[SPEAKER_08]: And why should that be considered an adjunct to the Water and Sewer Commission money, when in fact, if you can't project your budget in the future,

707
00:59:57,453 --> 01:00:01,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you're supposed to, and you get your water and sewer estimate ahead of time from the MWRA.

708
01:00:03,083 --> 01:00:10,369
[SPEAKER_08]: We should not be thinking about a deficit when, again, you're just taking more money from the taxpayer without giving them the reason why you took it.

709
01:00:10,389 --> 01:00:24,319
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be more than happy to answer any questions, but I would hope that one of you, someone, even would get into the idea of showing and having some kind of a discount in advance for people who pay their taxes and for people who pay their water and sewer bills.

710
01:00:24,659 --> 01:00:27,402
[SPEAKER_08]: It's out there, it's been a proven fact, and it does work.

711
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:30,604
[SPEAKER_08]: And it'd be a great handshake between taxpayers and the city.

712
01:00:30,844 --> 01:00:31,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Paeta.

713
01:00:34,426 --> 01:00:35,987
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be more than happy to answer any questions.

714
01:00:37,087 --> 01:00:37,508
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all set.

715
01:00:37,528 --> 01:00:38,608
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

716
01:00:38,628 --> 01:00:38,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

717
01:00:38,908 --> 01:00:39,529
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion.

718
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:42,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks.

719
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:43,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

720
01:00:43,891 --> 01:00:48,153
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to thank my colleague Councilor Penta for his presentation tonight.

721
01:00:48,873 --> 01:00:53,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, you know, uh, the resolution was regarding the base fee charge.

722
01:00:53,956 --> 01:01:00,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, but I think Councilor Penta brings up some very interesting points, Mr. President, regarding these additional charges.

723
01:01:01,299 --> 01:01:05,861
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not just one item, it's a number of items that exist within our community.

724
01:01:06,481 --> 01:01:23,528
[SPEAKER_10]: And at some point, I think as a council, when we're talking about people not being able to afford their rent or their mortgage, and people living from paycheck to paycheck, and a pandemic, I think we have to look at everything that may be available to help relieve

725
01:01:24,168 --> 01:01:26,349
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, the taxpayers of this community.

726
01:01:27,109 --> 01:01:29,450
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, he brings up some very valid points.

727
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:37,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, since I've been on the council, I've offered at least three resolutions, uh, to do away with the acts of 1982.

728
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:44,875
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if my colleagues, uh, haven't done a number of years now cause it kind of fell on deaf ears for a period of time.

729
01:01:45,355 --> 01:01:52,378
[SPEAKER_10]: But the acts of 1982, the city council voted by home rule petition to allow the city to get up to 5%

730
01:01:53,658 --> 01:01:56,261
[SPEAKER_10]: of a franchise fee on the cable bills.

731
01:01:57,242 --> 01:01:58,543
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the highest you can get.

732
01:01:59,524 --> 01:02:09,214
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not opposed to using franchise fees to run the operation of community access, the educational channel, the government channel.

733
01:02:09,655 --> 01:02:15,961
[SPEAKER_10]: However, out of the 5%, only 2% of the money goes to operate those three channels.

734
01:02:17,543 --> 01:02:22,246
[SPEAKER_10]: 3% because of this act of 1982 goes back into the city coffers.

735
01:02:22,606 --> 01:02:27,389
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's nothing more than another hidden tax in this community, Mr. President.

736
01:02:27,789 --> 01:02:34,754
[SPEAKER_10]: And that 3% is about $360,000 a year that goes back into the city coffers.

737
01:02:35,094 --> 01:02:38,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Some would say, that's great, the money's going back into the city coffers.

738
01:02:38,616 --> 01:02:42,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Other would say, you know what, that's not what this money was intended.

739
01:02:42,659 --> 01:02:52,464
[SPEAKER_10]: The purpose was to run local access, local cable, community access, governmental channel, and not to fund the city budget, Mr. President.

740
01:02:52,864 --> 01:03:01,949
[SPEAKER_10]: So Council Penta brings up, that's just one issue, a number of issues that I think we as a council need to take a look at and address in these tough times.

741
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:05,411
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're not going to get better quickly.

742
01:03:05,931 --> 01:03:11,815
[SPEAKER_10]: And any way we can save the rate payers some additional funds, I think we need to look at it, Mr. President.

743
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:12,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

744
01:03:12,715 --> 01:03:15,316
[SPEAKER_10]: All in a motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Falco.

745
01:03:15,796 --> 01:03:16,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

746
01:03:16,997 --> 01:03:22,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, before you call the roll, one quick thing as a notation on the tax bills that come out.

747
01:03:22,279 --> 01:03:25,040
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll notice it says police, fire, and library.

748
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,860
[SPEAKER_08]: It says 10, 25, 30, whatever it might be.

749
01:03:28,461 --> 01:03:39,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoever checks that, when those bills come out every quarter, I think it would be informative to have next to each one of those items how much money has been donated so far.

750
01:03:39,676 --> 01:03:43,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that would give either an incentive or not for somebody to make a contribution.

751
01:03:43,281 --> 01:03:43,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

752
01:03:43,942 --> 01:03:45,645
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the Councilors wants to make that amendment.

753
01:03:47,848 --> 01:03:49,809
[SPEAKER_05]: I move to make that amendment, Mr. President.

754
01:03:49,889 --> 01:03:52,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Councilor Scott Peli, would you like to make an amendment?

755
01:03:52,691 --> 01:03:52,931
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

756
01:03:53,851 --> 01:04:00,615
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, as amended by Councilor Scott Peli, seconded by Councilor Falco.

757
01:04:01,175 --> 01:04:01,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

758
01:04:02,536 --> 01:04:03,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears.

759
01:04:03,736 --> 01:04:07,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Could that be a B paper, since it's a different topic than the water and sewer?

760
01:04:07,798 --> 01:04:09,379
[SPEAKER_04]: If you'd like it to be a B paper, that's fine.

761
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:10,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

762
01:04:12,698 --> 01:04:27,001
[SPEAKER_05]: that we, on your tax bill, you get the little checkbox there for like library and whatever, you can donate money to or for certain things there, that'd be, we get some type of update of where we are with money that's come in on that.

763
01:04:27,101 --> 01:04:28,662
[SPEAKER_05]: No, on the bill itself.

764
01:04:28,902 --> 01:04:29,262
[SPEAKER_08]: On the bill.

765
01:04:29,422 --> 01:04:34,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, under each item it'll tell you, they can put in parentheses, that would designate how much money.

766
01:04:34,383 --> 01:04:36,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's an update, that's a B paper.

767
01:04:36,384 --> 01:04:39,144
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the B paper, offered by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by?

768
01:04:39,164 --> 01:04:40,765
[SPEAKER_05]: By your plan.

769
01:04:40,785 --> 01:04:41,625
[SPEAKER_05]: By Councilor Falco.

770
01:04:42,715 --> 01:04:44,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

771
01:04:46,976 --> 01:04:54,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry, Councilor Falco.

772
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:04,282
[SPEAKER_11]: If you guys could turn on your microphones, please.

773
01:05:06,123 --> 01:05:06,403
[SPEAKER_11]: They're on.

774
01:05:08,027 --> 01:05:12,148
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so if you can, I think that Councilor Falco brings up a good point.

775
01:05:12,588 --> 01:05:14,649
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's from the inception to present.

776
01:05:14,989 --> 01:05:15,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

777
01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:17,669
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to get an update to where we were.

778
01:05:17,709 --> 01:05:23,471
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's important to see the taxpayers should see where that money's going from, from the beginning all the way to the present time.

779
01:05:23,491 --> 01:05:23,991
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

780
01:05:24,191 --> 01:05:24,471

840
01:08:34,162 --> 01:08:36,543

842
01:08:48,849 --> 01:08:55,772
[SPEAKER_12]: With respect to the Director of Economic Development, it was just an oversight that was actually flagged by you, Mr. President, that we wanted to get on the agenda as quickly as possible.

843
01:08:56,312 --> 01:09:02,975
[SPEAKER_12]: and the other is to reflect the revised duties and the consolidated mission of the Office of Diversity and the Office of Human Resources.

844
01:09:03,035 --> 01:09:12,238
[SPEAKER_12]: So happy to answer any questions that you might have, but this was already drafted with the City Solicitor when we're ready to proceed at the Council's pleasure.

845
01:09:12,598 --> 01:09:12,918
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

846
01:09:12,938 --> 01:09:14,519
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we have any questions for the Chief of Staff?

847
01:09:15,579 --> 01:09:16,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

848
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:16,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion.

849
01:09:17,808 --> 01:09:21,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I'm hoping that I'm, I'd like to actually, I'm not hoping to like to make a motion.

850
01:09:21,391 --> 01:09:25,234
[SPEAKER_09]: I am making a motion now that we have a committee of the whole on this, um, on both positions.

851
01:09:25,254 --> 01:09:27,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I do have a couple of questions and concerns.

852
01:09:27,335 --> 01:09:41,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I do believe back in January or February of last year, uh, this council asked for a legal opinion from the city solicitor, um, relative to whether or not it would pose a conflict of interest that a diversity director was also acting as a human resources coordinator.

853
01:09:42,466 --> 01:09:45,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so I'd like to just take the opportunity to go through those, those, uh,

854
01:09:45,828 --> 01:09:50,889
[SPEAKER_09]: responses and files, Mr. President, before we take affirmative action on this paper that's before us.

855
01:09:50,949 --> 01:09:53,470
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd ask that the paper be scheduled for a committee of the whole.

856
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:55,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

857
01:09:55,351 --> 01:09:56,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any further discussion?

858
01:09:59,372 --> 01:10:00,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scott Belli.

859
01:10:00,192 --> 01:10:01,232
[SPEAKER_11]: I would second that motion.

860
01:10:01,252 --> 01:10:09,174
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that understanding the, uh, there's a salary increase or any other input that goes to these positions.

861
01:10:09,214 --> 01:10:14,516
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that be discussed in committee of the whole, um, as we move forward to a very difficult,

862
01:10:15,755 --> 01:10:16,656
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, budget process.

863
01:10:16,676 --> 01:10:23,981
[SPEAKER_11]: So it'd be interesting to ask some questions and possibly, um, you know, personal matters.

864
01:10:25,162 --> 01:10:30,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at, uh, executive session to make sure we don't violate any open meeting laws or any personal information.

865
01:10:31,067 --> 01:10:31,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

866
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:31,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

867
01:10:33,108 --> 01:10:38,312

893
01:12:07,027 --> 01:12:09,147

894
01:12:09,227 --> 01:12:11,368
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think he's a new chief of staff.

895
01:12:11,388 --> 01:12:12,028
[SPEAKER_12]: He's new, correct?

896
01:12:12,048 --> 01:12:13,548
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a new appointment, correct.

897
01:12:13,568 --> 01:12:14,188
[SPEAKER_12]: He's a new appointment.

898
01:12:14,328 --> 01:12:19,330
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Pacini showed some interest through the interest form that we have on the website.

899
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:29,432
[SPEAKER_12]: It was spoken to by both the mayor and Roberta Cameron, and we felt comfortable advancing his appointment to the council for their approval per the ordinance.

900
01:12:30,105 --> 01:12:30,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

901
01:12:30,425 --> 01:12:39,293
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, I'll say, I, I know Mr. Pacini personally, uh, he's a, he's a man of, uh, integrity and, um, I think he, he'll be a good choice, uh, on the committee.

902
01:12:39,773 --> 01:12:40,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, Mr. President.

903

01:12:41,494 --> 01:12:46,278
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, I too have a lifelong friend of and neighbor of Mr. Pacini.

905
01:12:46,298 --> 01:12:50,201
[SPEAKER_11]: I think he'll be a great addition to the, uh, the team.

906
01:12:50,582 --> 01:12:57,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, but I, I think that, um, for my fellow colleagues and people that don't know who he is, I think some information, um,

907
01:12:59,521 --> 01:13:08,647
[SPEAKER_11]: a resume or something that we can all share in his expertise.

908

909
01:13:10,188 --> 01:13:11,289

01:13:16,153 --> 01:13:17,634

01:13:42,329 --> 01:13:46,350
[SPEAKER_05]: If you'd like to give us a little brief background, it would be appreciated.

924
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:49,331
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you take any questions from the Councilors, it would be appreciated.

925
01:13:50,988 --> 01:13:53,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly, a quick overview of myself.

926
01:13:53,890 --> 01:13:58,333
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 years of project management experience in the private and public sectors.

927
01:13:58,653 --> 01:14:04,297

928
01:14:04,797 --> 01:14:09,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I deal mostly in security and wireless and a lot of

929
01:14:10,621 --> 01:14:16,723
[SPEAKER_03]: helping companies currently push their workforces remote via Microsoft Teams.

930
01:14:17,863 --> 01:14:24,785
[SPEAKER_03]: I have got volunteer experience working with the City of Medford as a, or with Medford Youth Soccer.

931
01:14:25,606 --> 01:14:33,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I've moved on from that in the last year and am looking to move my volunteer time into another organization, somebody else who could use me for a year or two.

932
01:14:35,268 --> 01:14:36,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Pessini.

933
01:14:36,429 --> 01:14:36,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco.

934
01:14:38,268 --> 01:14:39,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

935
01:14:40,389 --> 01:14:46,851
[SPEAKER_00]: I have known Steve Puccini most of my life, especially growing up with him close to 45 years ago.

936
01:14:47,491 --> 01:14:52,493
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know he's been active in the community through Medford Community Soccer.

937
01:14:52,533 --> 01:14:54,414
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know he's going to.

938
01:14:55,868 --> 01:15:00,209
[SPEAKER_00]: be a really a positive impact to the CPC committee and I'd move approval.

939
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:00,890
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

940
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:13,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, again, Mr. President, uh, I think that was the only piece having Mr. Pacini here and or a, uh, a resume that my fellow colleagues who look, look through, he's a,

941
01:15:13,954 --> 01:15:15,575
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a valuable member of our community.

942
01:15:16,635 --> 01:15:25,159
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can see that he's someone that has donated his expertise and his time to his kids and the people of Medford.

943
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:33,404
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that his input and his involvement would be a great asset to the commission.

944
01:15:33,424 --> 01:15:33,924
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

945
01:15:34,504 --> 01:15:34,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

946
01:15:35,044 --> 01:15:36,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further, any other, any other questions?

947
01:15:38,186 --> 01:15:38,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President,

948
01:15:40,742 --> 01:15:41,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

949
01:15:42,403 --> 01:15:52,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Through the President, Mr. Piccinini, just wondering what got you interested in the Community Preservation Committee and what would you look forward to doing as part of the committee?

950
01:15:53,506 --> 01:16:07,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Ironically, the thing that drew my attention most to it was being a soccer coach in Medford and traveling around to different communities and seeing the amazing resources that other communities have that I'd like to see some thought and input put into Medford.

951
01:16:09,348 --> 01:16:24,158
[SPEAKER_03]: being a soccer coach, going to see places, going to the facilities that you see in Everett and Waltham and Belmont and Chelmsford, I came back with some thoughts and some energy and I kind of look around at

952
01:16:25,219 --> 01:16:33,743
[SPEAKER_03]: our biggest facility here for Medford Youth Soccer prior to my son turning 14 was Play State Park and some of the things we could do there that aren't being done today.

953
01:16:34,203 --> 01:16:45,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Other communities, you know, when you go to these events, now my daughter is playing travel basketball, so I've seen even more diversity in how communities represent these open spaces.

954
01:16:46,109 --> 01:16:47,770
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really what turned my thought to this.

955
01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:52,192
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't just sports in particular, but it's how other communities use their open and green spaces.

956
01:16:53,762 --> 01:16:54,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

957
01:16:54,202 --> 01:16:54,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you.

958
01:16:54,782 --> 01:16:57,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know, that's one of the major charges of the CPC.

959
01:16:57,723 --> 01:17:05,185
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm glad to have someone on board who is thinking about how we can make our great open spaces even better for our residents.

960
01:17:05,285 --> 01:17:05,885
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks.

961
01:17:05,965 --> 01:17:07,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for answering my question.

962
01:17:07,486 --> 01:17:08,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

963
01:17:09,146 --> 01:17:17,229
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli to confirm, Mr. Passini, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

964
01:17:19,809 --> 01:17:20,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Bears.

965
01:17:21,330 --> 01:17:21,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

966
01:17:22,535 --> 01:17:23,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco.

967
01:17:23,516 --> 01:17:23,796

993

[SPEAKER_04]: We were discussing papers 20-300 and 20-302.

994
01:18:16,549 --> 01:18:21,731
[SPEAKER_04]: The first paper looks at some housing stability options that we can take as a city.

995
01:18:22,391 --> 01:18:25,712
[SPEAKER_04]: The housing stability task force being one of the main ones discussed.

997
01:18:34,562 --> 01:18:40,806
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a robust discussion between the councilors and also members of the administration and members of the public.

998
01:18:41,926 --> 01:18:43,848
[SPEAKER_04]: We kind of set up some follow-up steps.

999
01:18:44,788 --> 01:18:47,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Solicitor Scanlon was not able to be with us that evening.

1000
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:55,014
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am reaching out to her to see the progress on a draft ordinance around the housing stability task force.

1001
01:18:56,335 --> 01:19:04,221
[SPEAKER_04]: the mayor and the office of community development said that they would send some data regarding housing stability calls to the subcommittee.

1002
01:19:04,681 --> 01:19:08,664
[SPEAKER_04]: And we agreed that we would meet again, two weeks from January 5th.

1003
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:11,425
[SPEAKER_04]: So sometime next week to discuss.

1004
01:19:12,506 --> 01:19:17,328
[SPEAKER_04]: all of those updates, as well as updates from the mayor's office on the eviction moratorium in further detail.

1005
01:19:18,228 --> 01:19:20,709
[SPEAKER_04]: And just today, we received subcommittee appointments.

1006
01:19:20,769 --> 01:19:25,551

1007

[SPEAKER_05]: Public participation.

1026
01:20:01,043 --> 01:20:02,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any public participation?

1027
01:20:02,704 --> 01:20:03,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

1028
01:20:03,125 --> 01:20:04,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address of the record please.

1029
01:20:05,815 --> 01:20:06,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Summit Road.

1030
01:20:07,216 --> 01:20:09,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I want to go back to something that I had said earlier.

1031
01:20:10,318 --> 01:20:14,862
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like the council to entertain what they call a deadline and discount program.

1032
01:20:15,442 --> 01:20:20,006
[SPEAKER_08]: This would relate itself to your water bills and also to your taxes.

1033
01:20:20,807 --> 01:20:27,552
[SPEAKER_08]: And as I said before, it is well practiced in some states and some cities and towns where

1034
01:20:28,112 --> 01:20:33,774
[SPEAKER_08]: On the month that you receive, for example, your tax bill, if you pay it that month, you get a 4% discount.

1035
01:20:34,174 --> 01:20:38,136
[SPEAKER_08]: If you pay it the next month before the bill is due, you get a 3% discount.

1036
01:20:38,556 --> 01:20:41,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Or you wait till the very last day and pay it like a lot of people do.

1037
01:20:42,178 --> 01:20:43,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Same thing with the water bills.

1038
01:20:43,398 --> 01:20:47,700
[SPEAKER_08]: The water bills doesn't have as much of a leeway time between the tax bills when they come in.

1039
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:51,001
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the month that you receive the bill, it's usually halfway through the month.

1040
01:20:51,441 --> 01:20:53,822
[SPEAKER_08]: If you pay it that month, it's a 4% discount.

1041
01:20:54,202 --> 01:20:57,923
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it works well because it's a handshake between the cities and the taxpayers.

1042
01:20:58,343 --> 01:21:02,124
[SPEAKER_08]: And if the taxpayer is looking for a little bit of a break, there it is right there.

1043
01:21:02,204 --> 01:21:04,565
[SPEAKER_08]: If you pay your bill ahead of time, you get a discount.

1044
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:09,707
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the same time, the city gets its money to use at a quicker rate for whatever purpose it has.

1045
01:21:10,167 --> 01:21:10,927
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it works.

1046
01:21:11,007 --> 01:21:11,927
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it makes sense.

1047
01:21:12,467 --> 01:21:13,928
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's no loss to either side.

1048
01:21:14,228 --> 01:21:15,648
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a benefit to either side.

1049
01:21:15,889 --> 01:21:16,729
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the same time,

1050
01:21:17,509 --> 01:21:30,719
[SPEAKER_08]: What you're doing is you're telling the taxpayers, you're basically thinking out for them the best way you can, and you're thinking out for the city the best way you can, because you're giving us the money quicker than we would have gotten if we had to wait almost eight weeks for you to pay your tax bill.

1051
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:39,643
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would hope someone on the council would entertain it, present it before a committee of the whole for the purposes of discussing it, and moving forward with it.

1052
01:21:40,103 --> 01:21:42,104
[SPEAKER_08]: It works.

1053
01:21:42,424 --> 01:21:43,385
[SPEAKER_08]: It works in other cities.

1054
01:21:43,445 --> 01:21:45,645
[SPEAKER_08]: It works in other states and other cities and towns.

1055
01:21:45,905 --> 01:21:54,109
[SPEAKER_08]: And as I told you earlier, it's just a way of saying to the taxpayers, we're hearing what you're saying.

1056
01:21:54,149 --> 01:21:55,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody's got these problems today.

1057
01:21:56,210 --> 01:21:57,090
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to help you out.

1058
01:21:58,067 --> 01:22:13,347
[SPEAKER_08]: And the second thing on the citizen participation, I just don't understand why tax seniors have to pay that once a year $25 tax to park in the city when we were told in January inauguration that the seniors would be able to park for nothing in the city of Medford.

1059
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:14,649
[SPEAKER_08]: That still hasn't happened yet.

1060
01:22:14,689 --> 01:22:15,310
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why.

1061
01:22:16,311 --> 01:22:22,755
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a promise that should have been kept, that needs to be kept, and it's just, once again, it's, I don't know.

1062
01:22:22,895 --> 01:22:25,497
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how the city's operating lately, but all I can tell you is this.

1063
01:22:25,877 --> 01:22:32,501
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got to look for creative ways to keep the people's interest, and at the same time, to keep your own interest.

1064
01:22:33,022 --> 01:22:40,887
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I presented here tonight, I think, is a pretty good handshake with the taxpayers and with the city of Medford as well, Mr. President.

1065
01:22:41,959 --> 01:22:42,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Be more than happy.

1066
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:49,965
[SPEAKER_08]: When we talk about money here in the city of Medford, you talk about how the city is going to function.

1067
01:22:50,585 --> 01:22:53,247
[SPEAKER_08]: And the city can only function when the taxpayers are willing to pay.

1068
01:22:53,847 --> 01:22:56,069
[SPEAKER_08]: And sometimes people become delinquent in paying.

1069
01:22:56,349 --> 01:22:58,911
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they become delinquent, they can't pay it because they don't have it.

1070
01:22:59,291 --> 01:23:02,994
[SPEAKER_08]: And if those people that do have it want to relinquish some of their money quicker,

1071
01:23:03,774 --> 01:23:07,497
[SPEAKER_08]: and get a discount for doing it, it helps the city because they get the money quicker.

1072
01:23:07,997 --> 01:23:24,890
[SPEAKER_08]: And the last thing I want to say, Mr. President, I think it really needs to entertain itself that the CPA, which is now five years has come and gone, should be looked at about presenting itself on the ballot this November coming in 2021 for the purposes of whether you're going to use it again and re-up it and what have you, because that's what the law says.

1073
01:23:25,570 --> 01:23:27,252
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not advocating for it or against it.

1074
01:23:27,292 --> 01:23:29,594
[SPEAKER_08]: What I'm advocating is that the five years are up.

1075
01:23:30,195 --> 01:23:32,257
[SPEAKER_08]: The sunset legislation is now in effect.

1076
01:23:32,938 --> 01:23:36,241
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you don't do nothing, it's just going to stay there.

1077
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:42,308
[SPEAKER_08]: 1,200 people in 2015 did not vote on that question because it was on the opposite side of the ballot.

1078
01:23:42,348 --> 01:23:43,529
[SPEAKER_08]: They weren't aware it was there.

1079
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:45,551
[SPEAKER_08]: So we really have no idea.

1080
01:23:46,172 --> 01:23:47,913
[SPEAKER_08]: whether it would have passed or it didn't pass.

1081
01:23:48,474 --> 01:23:54,579
[SPEAKER_08]: This time, I think it would be incumbent if the question goes on the ballot, it's there, and the taxpayers make their decision.

1082
01:23:54,879 --> 01:23:57,501
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it's about, the taxpayers' use of their money.

1083
01:23:57,521 --> 01:23:59,943
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be more than happy to answer any questions.

1084
01:24:01,625 --> 01:24:02,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Penta.

1085
01:24:02,686 --> 01:24:02,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1086
01:24:04,596 --> 01:24:05,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, Mr. President.

1087
01:24:06,278 --> 01:24:06,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks.

1088
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:08,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1089
01:24:09,622 --> 01:24:17,150
[SPEAKER_10]: I am curious about the deadline discount program that Councilor Penter mentioned.

1090
01:24:18,392 --> 01:24:22,656
[SPEAKER_10]: I would not be opposed to putting it on the agenda for next week.

1091
01:24:23,737 --> 01:24:27,198
[SPEAKER_10]: where we can't vote on anything tonight, where this was just presented.

1092
01:24:28,338 --> 01:24:39,440
[SPEAKER_10]: And asking next week that the finance director do some due diligence and let us know how this program would work, if indeed it would work in this community.

1093
01:24:40,981 --> 01:24:47,642
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we'd be able to provide the same services, if a certain number of people took advantage of this discount program.

1094
01:24:48,242 --> 01:24:52,163
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think any information regarding it would be helpful, Mr. President.

1095
01:24:52,423 --> 01:24:53,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1096
01:24:53,243 --> 01:24:58,065
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I know in the past, um, many years ago, we looked at tax amnesty.

1097
01:24:58,385 --> 01:25:03,026
[SPEAKER_10]: We looked at a number of ways, creative ways of generating additional revenue.

1098
01:25:03,046 --> 01:25:07,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, and, uh, this may be a creative way if it works for our community.

1099
01:25:07,708 --> 01:25:11,049
[SPEAKER_10]: If it doesn't work, then we don't entertain it, but it's worth looking into.

1100
01:25:11,369 --> 01:25:11,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1101
01:25:12,069 --> 01:25:12,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1102
01:25:12,749 --> 01:25:20,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Council Marks, if you put that on the agenda, I will make sure that, uh, I would ask that where it's brought up by a resident that it appear on next week's agenda.

1103
01:25:21,330 --> 01:25:23,811
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're going to present it, I will be the sponsor.

1104
01:25:23,931 --> 01:25:24,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1105
01:25:24,231 --> 01:25:26,211
[SPEAKER_10]: I would ask that we put on the agenda.

1106
01:25:27,331 --> 01:25:30,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Just if we could, could we also invite the city solicitor?

1107
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:36,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I know, um, former Councilor Penta mentioned some programs, but they were out of state programs.

1108
01:25:36,654 --> 01:25:44,996
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to make sure that, you know, we even have the legal authority to do something like this in Massachusetts compared to, you know, Florida or other States.

1109
01:25:45,136 --> 01:25:45,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1110
01:25:45,716 --> 01:25:57,428
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we will invite the City Solicitor and Aleesha Nunley to give some input on Councilor Marks' motion next week.

1111
01:25:57,829 --> 01:25:58,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President.

1112
01:25:58,569 --> 01:26:01,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1113
01:26:01,773 --> 01:26:02,673
[SPEAKER_10]: If you could, yes.

1114
01:26:04,115 --> 01:26:07,198
[SPEAKER_10]: That it be discussed, a very general resolution, that it be discussed.

1115
01:26:07,819 --> 01:26:08,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President.

1116
01:26:09,443 --> 01:26:13,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Relative to Councilor Bears' comment, it doesn't make any difference whether it's in-state or out-of-state.

1117
01:26:13,986 --> 01:26:17,949
[SPEAKER_08]: It's how a city sets its tax rate and how it makes its collections.

1118
01:26:18,329 --> 01:26:21,492
[SPEAKER_08]: All I'm making reference to the fact that it works in other states.

1119
01:26:21,852 --> 01:26:22,573
[SPEAKER_08]: It's out there.

1120
01:26:22,893 --> 01:26:25,435
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe there's a few cities and towns in Massachusetts.

1121
01:26:25,735 --> 01:26:26,736
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not my call.

1122
01:26:26,876 --> 01:26:28,277
[SPEAKER_08]: It's only an offering to be made.

1123
01:26:28,677 --> 01:26:36,403
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it works, as Councilor Marks has alluded to, how can it not work if you're getting your money quicker and you're having a discount paying it ahead of time?

1124
01:26:36,683 --> 01:26:37,503
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I'm saying.

1125
01:26:37,644 --> 01:26:38,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1126
01:26:39,154 --> 01:26:40,315
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, records.

1127
01:26:40,335 --> 01:26:42,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me, Mr. Clerk, do you have any papers in there?

1128
01:26:43,798 --> 01:26:45,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we have no, the clerk has no papers.

1132
01:26:55,128 --> 01:26:58,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I reviewed the records, find them to be in order and move approval.

1133
01:26:58,591 --> 01:27:01,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, on the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.
