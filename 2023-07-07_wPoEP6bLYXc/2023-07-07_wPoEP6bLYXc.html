    <a href="https://youtu.be/wPoEP6bLYXc&t=0.69s">[Crowell]</a>:  Hello, Roberts families.
 My name is Michelle Kroll, your new principal.
 I am honored to join the Roberts School community.
 With over 20 years of experience in public education, my journey began as a classroom teacher, and I have since served as an assistant principal, principal, and curriculum leader.
 These roles have provided me with invaluable experience in leading a school community and creating an environment for student success.
 The Roberts School has a rich tradition of academic excellence and instilling a love of learning in its students.
 This is a testament to the dedication and hard work of its students, teachers, staff, and community.
 As your principal, I look forward to building upon this strong foundation to ensure that our students continue to thrive academically, socially, and emotionally.
 The Roberts School is committed to providing a robust 21st century education that nurtures students to become lifelong learners and contributors to a diverse and rapidly changing world.
 Our teachers provide instructional experiences that are challenging, personalized, and cater to the unique needs of each of our students.
 The Roberts School will continue to focus on promoting a collaborative partnership between home and school.
 When educators and families work together, our students benefit immensely.
 I encourage you to stay connected and take full advantage of the numerous opportunities and resources the Medford Public Schools have to offer.
 Additionally, we will be hosting various meet and greet events where you can learn more about our school and share your valuable insights.
 I look forward to working with you as a partner to ensure the success of each and every one of our students.
 Go Mustangs!
