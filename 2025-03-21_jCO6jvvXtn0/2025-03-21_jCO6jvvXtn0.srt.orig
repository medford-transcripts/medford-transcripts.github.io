00:01:39,156 --> 00:01:42,777

30
00:01:43,497 --> 00:01:51,479
[SPEAKER_11]: If it wasn't for Mr. Johnson, he's the one that educated me on how well you did, and we're all so proud of you.

31
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to let the public know, this is the 5th and 6th grade boys basketball team from St.

32
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Ray's.

33
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,901
[SPEAKER_11]: They recently had a big tournament in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

34
00:02:03,818 --> 00:02:13,286
[SPEAKER_11]: They outlasted, I guess, eight other participant teams and became the Northeast Regional CYO champions in their final game against St.

35
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,487
[SPEAKER_11]: Peter and Paul from Hartford.

36
00:02:16,128 --> 00:02:19,871
[SPEAKER_11]: They were seven points behind with six minutes left to play.

37
00:02:20,691 --> 00:02:31,220
[SPEAKER_11]: They went into, obviously, defense mode and allowed the opposition a mere two points for the rest of the game while scoring 14 points themselves and eventually winning the championship by five points.

38
00:02:31,963 --> 00:02:33,865
[SPEAKER_11]: you boys should be very proud of yourself.

39
00:02:34,005 --> 00:02:36,567
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sure your parents and grandparents are very proud.

40
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:40,671
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds like you had extra practice, which definitely paid off.

41
00:02:41,032 --> 00:02:45,616
[SPEAKER_11]: So hopefully you always practice and you get good results in sports.

42
00:02:46,036 --> 00:02:51,922
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that correlates to studying hard and extra study and obviously get better grades.

43
00:02:52,522 --> 00:02:57,347
[SPEAKER_11]: And you treat your parents and your grandparents with kindness, because you should just do that anyway.

44
00:03:08,477 --> 00:03:14,880
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to invite the coaches up if they're present to help me shake some hands.

45
00:03:25,725 --> 00:03:27,806
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to read the accommodation.

00:08:08,527 --> 00:08:09,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Five coaches?

00:08:09,607 --> 00:08:15,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, she's... Coach Dan O'Neill.

71
00:08:21,714 --> 00:08:22,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Coach Charlie Ball.

72
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:29,220
[SPEAKER_11]: And Coach Mike Philpott.

73
00:08:31,402 --> 00:08:41,290
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd just like to recognize the two assistant coaches, Coleman O'Neal and Paul McDonough.

74
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,500
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that him?

75
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:53,941
[SPEAKER_11]: Pauly?

76
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:55,042
This is Coleman.

77
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:57,564
Oh, that's Coleman.

78
00:08:58,084 --> 00:08:59,925
Pauly's our son.

79
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:00,706
[SPEAKER_11]: You're Pauly?

80
00:09:00,746 --> 00:09:02,307
[SPEAKER_11]: You're coached?

81
00:09:02,487 --> 00:09:10,174
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome job.

82
00:09:10,294 --> 00:09:12,095
[SPEAKER_11]: If anybody would like to say a few words.

83
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,337
[SPEAKER_08]: This is our spokesman.

84
00:09:14,657 --> 00:09:15,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

85
00:09:20,345 --> 00:09:23,188
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we really wanted to thank the council for having us come tonight.

86
00:09:23,748 --> 00:09:27,752
[SPEAKER_14]: We wanted to thank all the parents, the grandparents, everybody that made this season possible.

87
00:09:28,372 --> 00:09:31,555
[SPEAKER_14]: And mostly I know I speak for my other two assistant coaches here.

88
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,952
[SPEAKER_14]: No, they were a big help.

89
00:09:36,973 --> 00:09:38,634
[SPEAKER_14]: I said the players really made it possible.

90
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:42,177
[SPEAKER_14]: They made it really easy to coach this team.

91
00:09:42,918 --> 00:09:44,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Anytime we asked them to do something, they did it.

92
00:09:45,701 --> 00:09:52,487
[SPEAKER_14]: They usually did it with a smile, and they were a great tribute to their school and to their families by always thinking of the team first.

93
00:09:53,783 --> 00:09:59,124
[SPEAKER_14]: As my assistant coach, Mike Philpott, said many times, the important thing is to know your job.

94
00:09:59,624 --> 00:10:02,185
[SPEAKER_14]: And they each really figured out what their role was on that team.

95
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:03,425
[SPEAKER_14]: And they were able to come through.

96
00:10:03,665 --> 00:10:05,746
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can see the results that came from that teamwork.

97
00:10:05,766 --> 00:10:08,747
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you so much to the council.

98
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:11,527
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's an honor for us to be here tonight.

99
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:14,128
[SPEAKER_14]: And we really want to thank everybody.

100
00:10:14,188 --> 00:10:14,648
[SPEAKER_14]: So thanks.

101
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:24,805
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

102
00:10:26,386 --> 00:10:27,406
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Madam President.

103
00:10:28,407 --> 00:10:30,268
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to congratulate all the boys.

104
00:10:31,248 --> 00:10:32,549
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm a proud graduate of St.

105
00:10:32,609 --> 00:10:45,795
[SPEAKER_19]: Rayfield School, and I played basketball back some many years ago, and we never made it as far as Bridgeport, Connecticut, but I can tell you when we made it to the playoffs, we went as far as High Street to St.

106
00:10:45,835 --> 00:10:46,255
[SPEAKER_19]: Joseph's.

107
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,126
[SPEAKER_19]: And unfortunately, our playoffs ended there.

108
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:52,387
[SPEAKER_19]: But you've made us all proud.

109
00:10:52,547 --> 00:10:53,328
[SPEAKER_19]: And you've put St.

110
00:10:53,368 --> 00:10:54,328
[SPEAKER_19]: Raphael's on the map.

111
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:56,129
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's really a team effort.

112
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:57,630
[SPEAKER_19]: So you should all thank each other.

113
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,131
[SPEAKER_19]: And thank your parents and the coaches for taking the time.

114
00:11:09,116 --> 00:11:10,857
Thank you all.

115
00:11:10,957 --> 00:11:13,499
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody go back there, and we'll face this way.

116
00:13:46,521 --> 00:13:47,641
[SPEAKER_08]: You got that paper, George?

117
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:04,569
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of suspension of the rules by Councilor Knight for paper 16-463.

118
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:05,729
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

119
00:14:06,109 --> 00:14:06,870
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

120
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:07,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

121
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Under suspension, item number 16-463.

122
00:14:10,691 --> 00:14:11,272
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not it.

123
00:14:17,263 --> 00:14:18,864
[SPEAKER_08]: offered by Councilor DelaRusso.

124
00:14:19,285 --> 00:14:31,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council invite Kayla Hindle of the American Cancer Society to present to us about the upcoming Relay for Life.

125
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:33,475
[SPEAKER_08]: And we invite before us Kayla.

126
00:14:34,236 --> 00:14:46,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Just so you all know, over the past several years, the council has invited a representative of the American Cancer Society to present to us about the Relay for Life

127
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:57,759
[SPEAKER_08]: which is an awesome fundraising opportunity and night for people to gather and share their efforts in a cause to promote the greater good.

128
00:14:58,119 --> 00:15:04,945
[SPEAKER_08]: So we invite Kayla up to share with us her name and address for the record and to tell us about the Relay for Life.

129
00:15:05,462 --> 00:15:06,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

130
00:15:07,183 --> 00:15:08,344
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Kayla Hindle.

131
00:15:08,564 --> 00:15:09,505
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in Marlborough.

132
00:15:10,445 --> 00:15:14,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I need to be more specific than that?

133
00:15:14,308 --> 00:15:17,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much to you and to the council for your time.

134
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:25,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Relay for Life of Medford-Somerville has been around for many years, but we can always use more support, more people involved, and things like that.

135
00:15:25,296 --> 00:15:30,840
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to share some news and updates and opportunities for folks to get involved.

136
00:15:32,272 --> 00:15:34,834
[SPEAKER_01]: We need teams, survivors, sponsors.

137
00:15:35,515 --> 00:15:37,856
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone can sort of get involved in a way that suits them.

138
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,478
[SPEAKER_01]: So the event this year is June 4.

139
00:15:39,758 --> 00:15:41,339
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a month from tomorrow.

140
00:15:41,979 --> 00:15:47,524
[SPEAKER_01]: And down at Hormel Stadium, Bob Maloney is incredibly generous in hosting us there.

141
00:15:48,765 --> 00:15:53,248
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, we are continuing to make it a six-hour event as opposed to overnight.

142
00:15:53,288 --> 00:15:59,673
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're hoping to one day go back to the overnight event since that is a really meaningful part of Relay for Life

143
00:16:00,714 --> 00:16:17,608
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to give a little bit of background for any folks that aren't familiar with the history of Relay for Life, it is an event that is the main fundraiser for the American Cancer Society, but it's so community-driven, and it's very much built by the volunteers and by the community members.

144
00:16:17,968 --> 00:16:23,713
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, as much as possible, want to get folks from Medford and folks from Somerville very involved.

145
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:30,092
[SPEAKER_01]: and to drive these efforts because, unfortunately, cancer is something that virtually touches everyone's lives.

146
00:16:31,112 --> 00:16:44,398
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is an event where people can feel like they're taking action to fight back, joining together, and also sharing their emotions and, you know, experiencing something that other folks have experienced as well.

147
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:50,280
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's fun and food and entertainment and ceremonies, and it's a really great community effort.

148
00:16:51,058 --> 00:16:55,499
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I am happy to share the information that I have here with anyone who's interested.

149
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:59,240
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, you know, we encourage folks to create teams.

150
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,021
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know any survivors, please invite them to join us.

151
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:08,362
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a free survivor reception for survivors and a caregiver, a free dinner and gift and T-shirt.

152
00:17:08,422 --> 00:17:19,465
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to honor and celebrate them for the fight that they have fought and, you know, also looking for community sponsors, businesses to get involved as a promotional opportunity for them as well.

153
00:17:21,575 --> 00:17:22,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions?

154
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:25,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much, Kayla.

155
00:17:25,998 --> 00:17:26,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

156
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:27,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor Marks?

157
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:29,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe if you could give out your website?

158
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, yeah.

159
00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:33,583
[SPEAKER_01]: It's relayforlife.org slash MedfordMA.

160
00:17:33,983 --> 00:17:35,444
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty quick and easy.

161
00:17:35,464 --> 00:17:35,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

162
00:17:36,645 --> 00:17:36,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

163
00:17:36,985 --> 00:17:38,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else?

164
00:17:38,646 --> 00:17:40,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank you very much, Kayla, for coming up.

165
00:17:41,148 --> 00:17:41,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

166
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:42,689
[SPEAKER_08]: You have our support.

167
00:17:42,709 --> 00:17:43,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

168
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:49,533
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're grateful to the American Cancer Society and to the people who are involved in this effort for making

169
00:17:50,748 --> 00:17:57,472
[SPEAKER_08]: showing community support and encouraging life and health and progress in our city.

170
00:17:58,013 --> 00:17:58,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

171
00:17:59,053 --> 00:17:59,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

172
00:18:00,154 --> 00:18:02,955
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the motion of Councillor Knight that it be received and placed on file.

173
00:18:02,975 --> 00:18:03,676
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favour?

174
00:18:04,196 --> 00:18:04,816
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

175
00:18:05,097 --> 00:18:05,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

176
00:18:06,217 --> 00:18:13,461
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Councillor Knight while we're on suspension to take before us paper 16454.

177
00:18:14,882 --> 00:18:15,683
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favour?

178
00:18:16,003 --> 00:18:16,743
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

179
00:18:16,823 --> 00:18:17,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries. 16454.

180
00:18:20,178 --> 00:18:21,239
[SPEAKER_08]: offered by Councilor Knight.

181
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:34,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas it has come to the attention of the Medford City Council that approximately 36,000 Verizon workers in the company's landline and Fios division are currently on strike.

182
00:18:34,307 --> 00:18:46,294
[SPEAKER_08]: And whereas Verizon forced the workers on strike by demanding that they allow increased offshoring and contracting out of goods jobs from the communities, even after Verizon

183
00:18:46,930 --> 00:19:01,974
[SPEAKER_08]: has already sent thousands of formerly good union jobs overseas, and whereas Verizon workers are fighting for good family-supporting jobs, and whereas residents and businesses deserve high-quality telecommunications services

184
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:24,827
[SPEAKER_08]: and state-of-the-art fixed broadband services, not a network that Verizon chooses to neglect, especially in an emergency, by a low-skill, poorly-motivated replacement workforce, and whereas Verizon has made $39 billion in profit over the past three years

185
00:19:25,572 --> 00:19:54,630
[SPEAKER_08]: and paid its top five executives more than $230 million over the past five years, and be it therefore resolved that the City of Medford will not enter into any new contracts or obligations to purchase Verizon products or services while the strike continues, and be it further therefore resolved that the City of Medford will review any current contracts or obligations to purchase Verizon products or services

186
00:19:55,226 --> 00:20:16,364
[SPEAKER_08]: and then any contracts or obligations were permissible by the terms of the contract and the party's obligations to one another and be it further therefore resolved that the City of Medford urges Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam to end the Verizon campaign to destroy good jobs and be it therefore resolved

187
00:20:16,755 --> 00:20:20,816
[SPEAKER_08]: that the City of Medford go on record in support of the Striking Verizon workers.

188
00:20:21,536 --> 00:20:41,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Finally, be it therefore resolved that the City of Medford find good jobs and good telecommunication services are vital to local communities and supports Striking Verizon workers in the fight for good jobs that benefit for every worker and their families in our community.

189
00:20:42,535 --> 00:20:43,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

190
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:51,082
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize in advance for the length of the resolution before us this evening, and I thank you for indulging me in bringing it forward.

191
00:20:52,123 --> 00:20:55,746
[SPEAKER_09]: The issue that's before us this evening is really an issue of poverty, Mr. President.

192
00:20:56,286 --> 00:21:04,293
[SPEAKER_09]: As the top 1 percent continue to get richer in America, working families are under attack, and the situation here on the horizon is no different, Mr. President.

193
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:14,237
[SPEAKER_09]: If you take a look at what's going on with Verizon in the current situation between their workforce and their collective bargaining, you'll see that Verizon really has put profits ahead of people.

194
00:21:14,517 --> 00:21:19,220
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll see that their top five executives made $230 million in the last year.

195
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:29,027
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll see that in the first three months of 2016, they've made $1.8 billion in profit per month, Mr. President, but they want to replace

196
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:37,571
[SPEAKER_09]: jobs that pay a living wage, jobs that provide unemployment health benefits, jobs that provide retirement security, but jobs that don't.

197
00:21:37,692 --> 00:21:40,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, this hurts our local economy.

198
00:21:40,415 --> 00:21:46,422
[SPEAKER_09]: This hurts the 100-plus families in the city of Medford that have worked for Verizon for a number of years that have been committed to their job.

199
00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:58,813
[SPEAKER_09]: president that were working with Mar-Bell and Miller-Manning, the same people that have made this organization so successful and have put this organization in such a position that they can make such record profits.

200
00:21:59,273 --> 00:22:18,421
[SPEAKER_09]: But I really think that it's not right, it's not fair to put profits ahead of people and to really sell out the workforce to offshore overseas accounts and to a workforce that's not going to be as committed, because they're actually employees of a president, you know, such an organized party.

201
00:22:18,882 --> 00:22:19,602
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm here in the audience.

202
00:22:19,622 --> 00:22:25,545
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have several individuals who reside in the city of Manhattan who are directly impacted by this corporate grief.

203
00:22:25,905 --> 00:22:27,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Corporate grief, Mr. President.

204
00:22:27,486 --> 00:22:48,095
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd ask my council colleagues to stand with me and to stand with the 3,600 members that are striking between London and New York to fight corporate grief to its finest, to force Verizon, to urge Verizon to end the campaign to destroy the jobs, and to be sure that we can have jobs that pay a living wage and remain in our community because they are essential to the well-being of all of us, Mr. President.

205
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,620
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

206
00:22:54,341 --> 00:22:55,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Vice President.

207
00:22:55,802 --> 00:23:00,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Dela Russo, and I thank Councilor Knight for his presentation.

208
00:23:00,765 --> 00:23:14,833
[SPEAKER_11]: My question, because I know this involves city contracts, so my question to Councilor Knight through the chair is, has he had any conversations with the mayor of the, you know, Mayor Burke and how she feels about this?

209
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:20,056
[SPEAKER_11]: And if she's willing, if we do pass a resolution like this, is she willing to entertain it and follow through with it?

210
00:23:20,497 --> 00:23:22,638
[SPEAKER_09]: I spoke with mayor Burke briefly on the issue.

211
00:23:23,138 --> 00:23:31,141
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that the person that should speak with mayor Burke would be the men and women of IBEW local 2222 who endorsed her candidacy when she was running for mayor.

212
00:23:31,722 --> 00:23:33,962
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that those are the people that she should really be accountable to.

213
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:42,826
[SPEAKER_09]: However, she did not seem to be opposed to the idea that we support the striking Verizon workers, that we ensure that we have jobs that pay a living wage in our community, Mr. President.

214
00:23:43,086 --> 00:23:45,027
[SPEAKER_09]: She did not seem like she was opposed to that at all.

215
00:23:45,887 --> 00:23:48,068
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, I'd ask for approval.

216
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,963
[SPEAKER_09]: And my motion of approval by constant night and vice president.

217
00:23:52,003 --> 00:23:52,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

218
00:23:52,404 --> 00:23:59,133
[SPEAKER_11]: And with regards, do you have any idea of, cause we are mentioning contracts, um, held within with the city.

219
00:23:59,153 --> 00:24:03,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have a list of those contracts just so we know how the bottom line would be affected?

220
00:24:05,063 --> 00:24:12,385
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not have a list of those contracts, but I'm unaware of how the city's bottom line would be affected if we didn't enter into any new contracts.

221
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:24,889
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that the idea here is, Mr. President, is until the corporate juggernaut realizes that the people that made this corporate juggernaut successful do some respect.

222
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:29,810
[SPEAKER_09]: There's only one way that you can get these corporations to listen, Mr. President, and that's to hit them in the pocket.

223
00:24:30,476 --> 00:24:33,497
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that hitting them in the pocketbook is certainly the way to go.

224
00:24:33,877 --> 00:24:40,680
[SPEAKER_09]: We should take a long, hard look at the business that we're doing with Verizon and with other corporate entities that take advantage of their workforce, Mr. President.

225
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:49,463
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, with that being said, I do not know how this will affect the city's bottom line, but it's my understanding that we don't have much contractual obligation with Verizon at this point in time.

226
00:24:50,043 --> 00:24:53,145
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'll be happy to follow up with the Superintendent of Lights and Lines and get back to you on that.

227
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:57,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, if we could maybe get a report from the administration.

228
00:24:58,026 --> 00:24:59,507
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that all our self-employed

229
00:25:00,134 --> 00:25:01,335
[SPEAKER_11]: The department had cell phones.

230
00:25:02,796 --> 00:25:06,518
[SPEAKER_11]: The last time we heard during budget hearings, I believe that was through Verizon.

231
00:25:06,858 --> 00:25:08,459
[SPEAKER_11]: So I do know there are some contracts.

232
00:25:08,499 --> 00:25:11,280
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to see how that would affect our bottom line budget.

233
00:25:11,681 --> 00:25:16,643
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a close friend who's actually striking with Verizon at the VFW.

234
00:25:16,704 --> 00:25:22,067
[SPEAKER_11]: I think he's logged in about 120 miles walking back and forth, and it's been a couple weeks now.

235
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:24,208
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can only imagine the last strike was

236
00:25:25,585 --> 00:25:33,687
[SPEAKER_11]: It took a few months, so I understand the issue and I understand what the families are going through because I do have a close friend striking himself.

237
00:25:33,847 --> 00:25:41,169
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to make sure that what we're voting on is something in our purview, something that the administration will take into consideration.

238
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:53,053
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do want to know, you know, how this will affect the bottom line of our budget and, you know, what contracts, how many contracts are involved here before we maybe, you know, I'd like to hear from the public.

239
00:25:55,254 --> 00:26:01,978
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to strike out after the second, be it therefore resolved.

240
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:09,622
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like the resolution to read that the city of Medford will review any current contracts or obligations to purchase Verizon products or services.

241
00:26:10,043 --> 00:26:13,505
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to cross out in any contracts or obligations.

242
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:18,988
[SPEAKER_09]: We're permissible by the terms of the contract and the party's obligations to one another.

243
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:27,532
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that might address Councilor Longo's concern as to whether or not there is a monetary effect it will have on the taxpayers here in the community, and it will also send the same indistinct message.

244
00:26:27,793 --> 00:26:31,934
[SPEAKER_09]: And it will also, I think, make her friend feel very happy that she's supporting this cause as well.

245
00:26:32,775 --> 00:26:33,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

246
00:26:33,355 --> 00:26:37,357
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the motion of approval by Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Knight.

247
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:41,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair recognizes the citizen at the podium.

248
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:42,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, sir.

249
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:45,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Please state your name and address for the record, and welcome.

250
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

251
00:26:47,021 --> 00:26:49,562
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Robert Capucci of 71 Evans Street.

252
00:26:50,528 --> 00:27:03,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, my, my first question on this matter is has, has the city council of Medford, uh, decided to, uh, become a, uh, a union talking point.

253
00:27:03,697 --> 00:27:06,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I don't really take either side on this issue.

254
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:12,923
[SPEAKER_02]: My question is the function of the city council to represent all of the citizens, citizens of Medford.

255
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:16,806
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you're going to start taking up every single union issue that

256
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:21,020
[SPEAKER_02]: It reflects badly on this body, in my opinion.

257
00:27:22,281 --> 00:27:33,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not take up the issue of the local 25 here, where the new mayoral administration has pretty much nearly wiped out their overtime?

258
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:35,106
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's another matter.

259
00:27:36,286 --> 00:27:43,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Councillor Knight has brought up some very good points, but he doesn't just cite Verizon.

260
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:46,670
[SPEAKER_02]: He cites all of corporate

261
00:27:47,253 --> 00:27:48,033
[SPEAKER_02]: corporate America.

262
00:27:48,534 --> 00:28:00,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the unions in this case are actually representing the work line, not the entire workforce, as Councilor Knight alluded to.

263
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,822
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the work line force of Verizon.

264
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:15,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Since the year 2000, their responsibility, their Department of Verizon, in terms of their overall economic intake, in 2000 it was 60%

265
00:28:18,383 --> 00:28:20,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, in 2016, it's actually less than 7%.

266
00:28:22,187 --> 00:28:35,839
[SPEAKER_02]: What Verizon is doing is actually, in my research, and I got this all from the public record that anybody can look up, what Verizon is doing is conforming to the 21st century and the times.

267
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:45,187
[SPEAKER_02]: What is before this union and the company is a contract, and that's up to them to decide.

268
00:28:45,745 --> 00:28:52,088
[SPEAKER_02]: If the councilor wanted to, you know, make a statement on it, but to actually call for this city to take action, I think sets a precedent.

269
00:28:52,629 --> 00:28:53,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Now — Point of information, Mr. President?

270
00:28:54,189 --> 00:28:54,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information.

271
00:28:55,030 --> 00:29:04,134
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe about one and a half years ago, this city council did take action on a very similar matter that I brought forward when they were going to lay off 33 janitors up at Tufts University.

272
00:29:04,775 --> 00:29:07,116
[SPEAKER_09]: And we brought a similar resolution forward, Mr. President.

273
00:29:07,716 --> 00:29:11,638
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd like to point out that there were 33 people on the chopping block.

274
00:29:12,238 --> 00:29:13,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Only eight people got cut.

275
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:20,663
[SPEAKER_09]: So the council did take up an issue that might be outside its purview and outside its scope, and I don't think that's an unreasonable thing to say.

276
00:29:20,723 --> 00:29:25,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, this has nothing to do with, you know, the legislative body of a local municipality.

277
00:29:25,609 --> 00:29:28,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely not, Mr. President, but it does have to do with

278
00:29:28,507 --> 00:29:34,369
[SPEAKER_09]: the lives of 100-plus citizens in this community who aren't going to work and aren't collecting a check every day, Mr. President.

279
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,410
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what it's all about.

280
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:42,813
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about our neighbors and our family and the people that want to be able to provide for their families and people that want to make a living wage so that they can afford to live in Medford.

281
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:52,697
[SPEAKER_09]: The same people that have lived in Medford for their whole life, that have helped make Medford great, now can't afford to live here, and we're going to say it's okay, outsource their job, send it overseas, and tell them to go work for minimum wage?

282
00:29:53,217 --> 00:29:54,458
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that's right, Mr. President.

283
00:29:54,478 --> 00:29:55,078
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's fair.

284
00:29:56,918 --> 00:29:57,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Mr. Citizen.

285
00:29:58,099 --> 00:29:58,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

286
00:29:58,539 --> 00:29:59,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

287
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I thank the counselor for his comments.

288
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:09,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Being a longtime worker for unions, I'm sure he's representing them well.

289
00:30:09,944 --> 00:30:14,466
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's here to represent the city of Medford, in everybody's opinion, not just the unions.

290
00:30:15,406 --> 00:30:16,807
[SPEAKER_02]: The contract that's before these workers.

291
00:30:16,827 --> 00:30:17,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information, Mr. President.

292
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:18,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, Counselor Knight.

293
00:30:18,888 --> 00:30:20,969
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe I'm entitled to have an opinion as well.

294
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,370
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information.

295
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information, Madam Vice President.

296
00:30:25,475 --> 00:30:33,460
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree with what Mr. Pucci is saying in a way, but I also agree with my council colleague, Councilor Knight.

297
00:30:34,381 --> 00:30:39,984
[SPEAKER_11]: When somebody is passionate about a subject and they want to speak on it, and you're right, maybe it should just be a statement.

298
00:30:40,444 --> 00:30:42,606
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is a council forum.

299
00:30:43,486 --> 00:30:44,367
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a procedure.

300
00:30:44,787 --> 00:30:46,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody should be open to the public.

301
00:30:46,268 --> 00:30:52,512
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I agree if Councilor Knight wants to make a statement, then I'm all ears and I want to hear it.

302
00:30:52,845 --> 00:31:08,781
[SPEAKER_11]: I just hope that counselors, including Counselor Knight, understand that when maybe I want to talk about the schools or transparency of the school system, that that is relevant and obviously affects not workers, but our children and parents and teachers.

303
00:31:08,921 --> 00:31:11,744
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just hope the same courtesy is extended back and forth.

304
00:31:14,466 --> 00:31:15,447
[SPEAKER_08]: If I might point out.

305
00:31:16,743 --> 00:31:31,954
[SPEAKER_08]: that if local bodies didn't speak out on these passionate matters, especially with the livelihood of its citizens, perhaps the areas of the Rust Belt, the Midwest, greater Detroit, Michigan, would be thriving metropolises today.

306
00:31:32,655 --> 00:31:34,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Citizen, if you would continue.

307
00:31:34,616 --> 00:31:36,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

308
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:41,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Councillor Knight has said a lot about corporate greed and one of

309
00:31:43,186 --> 00:31:45,347
[SPEAKER_02]: outsourced jobs and things like that.

310
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:49,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take a look at what, first of all, Verizon is offering the workers right now.

311
00:31:50,769 --> 00:31:54,431
[SPEAKER_02]: A 7.5 percent wage increase.

312
00:31:54,451 --> 00:31:55,031
[SPEAKER_09]: The President.

313
00:31:55,051 --> 00:31:56,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, Mr. President.

314
00:31:56,892 --> 00:32:03,295
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if the gentleman would be qualified to discuss this, considering he's not a member of the bargaining team for Verizon and he's not at the table.

315
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:07,777
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe he's reporting to us what Verizon's reported out in their media campaign to destroy good jobs.

316
00:32:07,797 --> 00:32:09,057
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is a part of the public record.

317
00:32:09,778 --> 00:32:12,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, the counselor has brought up an agenda item.

318
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,590
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an open forum.

319
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:18,211
[SPEAKER_02]: He's brought up points about corporate greed and everything else.

320
00:32:18,391 --> 00:32:26,773
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the full right to offer my opinion in refusion to him citing corporate greed and everything else.

321
00:32:27,073 --> 00:32:29,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about what's actually being offered here.

322
00:32:29,194 --> 00:32:35,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about- Mr. Capucci, you are welcome to continue speaking, and we're grateful to you for coming up here to speak to us.

323
00:32:36,656 --> 00:32:36,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

324
00:32:36,856 --> 00:32:37,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

325
00:32:37,496 --> 00:32:38,156
[SPEAKER_02]: May I continue?

326
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:38,936
[SPEAKER_02]: You may.

327
00:32:39,656 --> 00:32:40,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

328
00:32:40,176 --> 00:32:40,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

329
00:32:41,357 --> 00:32:42,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what's actually being offered here,

330
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:56,028
[SPEAKER_02]: is a 7.5% wage increase, a no layoff provision, a 401k plan matching a pension plan, with three annual increases and access to health care.

331
00:32:56,929 --> 00:33:04,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year, Verizon invested $7.8 billion in America's technology infrastructure.

332
00:33:05,094 --> 00:33:10,777
[SPEAKER_02]: They paid $8.4 billion in taxes in 2015, added that to 2014

333
00:33:12,215 --> 00:33:14,617
[SPEAKER_02]: and they actually paid $15.6 billion.

334
00:33:15,037 --> 00:33:16,738
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a 35% tax rate.

335
00:33:17,618 --> 00:33:20,700
[SPEAKER_02]: In salaries, they paid a combined $16.1 billion.

336
00:33:21,441 --> 00:33:25,403
[SPEAKER_02]: They've purchased $4.25 billion from diverse suppliers.

337
00:33:26,024 --> 00:33:28,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Those purchases alone create jobs in other industries.

338
00:33:29,346 --> 00:33:32,708
[SPEAKER_02]: They paid $8.5 billion to shareholders in cash dividends.

339
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:36,471
[SPEAKER_02]: They paid $2.3 billion in pensions and retirement benefits.

340
00:33:37,251 --> 00:33:39,312
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all just last year.

341
00:33:39,513 --> 00:33:41,594
[SPEAKER_02]: $3.2 billion in health care benefits covering six

342
00:33:42,538 --> 00:33:54,668
[SPEAKER_02]: 170,000 beneficiaries given top-of-the-line access to medical, dental, prescription that was so robust that it qualifies for the Cadillac tax under Obamacare.

343
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:00,293
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the total, Mr. President, if the gentleman wouldn't mind answering that question?

344
00:34:00,313 --> 00:34:03,575
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the grand total, after all those billions that he just rattled off?

345
00:34:04,656 --> 00:34:06,918
[SPEAKER_02]: You're looking at almost $100 billion here.

346
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:11,367
[SPEAKER_09]: One third.

347
00:34:12,028 --> 00:34:22,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, if I have the floor, I would appreciate you ruling on civility in the forum, so I'm not shouting it down.

348
00:34:23,257 --> 00:34:24,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

349
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:36,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Verizon, just a month ago, signed a contract with Boston to bring in fiber technology to Boston, Mass., making it one of the most

350
00:34:37,917 --> 00:34:51,566
[SPEAKER_02]: advanced, industrialized, and technologicalized cities in America that Mayor Walsh has partnered with because it's going to bring jobs and benefits to the people of Boston that many of these Metro residents that are working on.

351
00:34:52,206 --> 00:34:54,428
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things with— Point of information, Mr. President.

352
00:34:54,488 --> 00:34:55,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information, Congressman.

353
00:34:56,049 --> 00:35:01,212
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also been very well publicized in the public record that the gentleman speaks about

354
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:09,741
[SPEAKER_09]: that while Verizon does bring Fios services and broadband services into certain communities, those communities that they bring them into are usually the more affluent communities.

355
00:35:09,981 --> 00:35:17,783
[SPEAKER_09]: And low-income communities don't necessarily receive the same treatment or the same service or the same level of service, Mr. President, which, again, is, you know, reflective.

356
00:35:19,103 --> 00:35:22,704
[SPEAKER_02]: So not only are they corporate greedy people, they're also

357
00:35:24,892 --> 00:35:26,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you're alluding to?

358
00:35:27,033 --> 00:35:33,535
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I believe that what I'm saying is they would deliver the services to the more affluent communities because they have an easier chance of getting paid.

359
00:35:33,775 --> 00:35:36,456
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a better chance of receiving some breaks.

360
00:35:36,956 --> 00:35:52,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, with the fact that this particular department has declined over 53 percent, what Verizon has done is expanded in fiber for broadband services.

361
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,081
[SPEAKER_02]: They invested in workers and tools.

362
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,123
[SPEAKER_02]: to keep a lot of these jobs.

363
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:09,528
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're talking about here, actually, is a private case that the council has brought forth that the city of Medford is now going to clamp down on corporate evil greed America.

364
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:13,969
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what's really fueling all of this, Mr. President.

365
00:36:14,549 --> 00:36:17,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, looking at the resolution, I believe the resolution asks that

366
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,931
[SPEAKER_09]: the City of Medford review any current contracts or obligations to purchase Verizon products or services.

367
00:36:22,111 --> 00:36:23,591
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what this resolution asks for.

368
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:24,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

369
00:36:24,171 --> 00:36:31,692
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reasons for that, Mr. President, as the Councilor outlined, are corporate greed and not doing things for poorer cities.

370
00:36:32,133 --> 00:36:32,373
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

371
00:36:32,673 --> 00:36:33,853
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you said, Councilor.

372
00:36:33,893 --> 00:36:36,913
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Mr. President, that's absolutely positively not what I cited.

373
00:36:36,933 --> 00:36:38,514
[SPEAKER_09]: That's exactly what you said, Mr. Bates.

374
00:36:38,574 --> 00:36:40,574
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not the forum for you to debate.

375
00:36:40,934 --> 00:36:41,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President.

376
00:36:41,654 --> 00:36:44,855
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Mr. Capucci, if you would just continue with your statement.

377
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:45,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

378
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:48,233
[SPEAKER_02]: will wrap it up shortly.

379
00:36:48,253 --> 00:36:48,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

380
00:36:48,934 --> 00:36:49,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

381
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:52,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from a union family.

382
00:36:52,716 --> 00:36:53,157
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened?

383
00:36:53,257 --> 00:36:55,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not against unions.

384
00:36:55,058 --> 00:36:56,439
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're not, Bernie.

385
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure I am.

386
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I am.

387
00:36:59,281 --> 00:37:02,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for calling order to this forum, Mr. President.

388
00:37:02,504 --> 00:37:04,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for not doing that.

389
00:37:05,886 --> 00:37:06,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Drinking Kool-Aid.

390
00:37:07,868 --> 00:37:08,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not drinking any Kool-Aid.

391
00:37:08,988 --> 00:37:12,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just reciting facts of what Verizon did.

392
00:37:12,691 --> 00:37:13,672
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I'm doing.

393
00:37:13,952 --> 00:37:15,273
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all part of the public record.

394
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,448
[SPEAKER_02]: that people can go home and look up.

395
00:37:17,808 --> 00:37:26,390
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm personally proud of a country I can live in where it can pay out this much money and provide all of these jobs.

396
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:30,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at what's being offered to these union workers.

397
00:37:30,471 --> 00:37:34,553
[SPEAKER_02]: A 7.5% wage increase, no layoff provision, 401k

398
00:37:36,537 --> 00:37:44,004
[SPEAKER_02]: They're offering you a medical plan that's so good that it qualifies for the Obamacare Cadillac tax.

399
00:37:44,364 --> 00:37:51,030
[SPEAKER_02]: They paid $15.5 billion in taxes in the last two years under a 35% rate.

400
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:51,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's being greedy?

401
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's being greedy there?

402
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,402
[SPEAKER_02]: I lift paycheck to paycheck.

403
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:01,964
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no pension.

404
00:38:02,385 --> 00:38:04,248
[SPEAKER_02]: I pay a lot for my health care.

405
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,853
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of this health care gets paid for by Verizon.

406
00:38:10,402 --> 00:38:19,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, if I may, I don't think that Mr. Capucci or I are going to be able to settle the Verizon dispute in this room right now, this evening.

407
00:38:19,868 --> 00:38:27,933
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason I brought this matter forward was to stand with the men and women of Local 4222, the men and women in this community.

408
00:38:28,353 --> 00:38:31,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Would someone move the question, please?

409
00:38:31,795 --> 00:38:32,896
[SPEAKER_08]: I've moved it like six times.

410
00:38:34,417 --> 00:38:35,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a Medford City resident for 46 years.

411
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:43,484
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Councilor Knight for approval as amended.

412
00:38:45,265 --> 00:38:48,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

413
00:38:48,908 --> 00:38:49,708
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Marks.

414
00:38:50,049 --> 00:38:51,590
[SPEAKER_19]: Just if I could, Mr. President.

415
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:56,914
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I've been on the council a number of years and this is the precise reason why

416
00:38:57,795 --> 00:39:00,496
[SPEAKER_19]: this body has never gotten involved with collective bargaining.

417
00:39:01,156 --> 00:39:03,797
[SPEAKER_19]: First of all, we have no business being in collective bargaining.

418
00:39:04,417 --> 00:39:16,760
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't get in any of the businesses of our local fire department, police department, who have all over the last couple of years gone through some real tumultuous collective bargaining with the administration.

419
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,780
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's not under the purview of this council.

420
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:25,682
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, as a recent union member myself, I support union workers.

421
00:39:26,098 --> 00:39:27,339
[SPEAKER_19]: I support the right to strike.

422
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:28,480
[SPEAKER_19]: I support a living wage.

423
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,242
[SPEAKER_19]: I support not sending good jobs out of the U.S.

424
00:39:32,683 --> 00:39:34,924
[SPEAKER_19]: And I support all that, Mr. President.

425
00:39:35,465 --> 00:39:45,412
[SPEAKER_19]: However, some of the language, and I'm sure the motion that was offered by Counselor Knight, he wanted to be thorough in his motion.

426
00:39:45,452 --> 00:39:54,598
[SPEAKER_19]: But some of the motion deals with issues that I, as a counselor, for years, Mr. President, and anyone that's been on this council for years, fought

427
00:39:55,075 --> 00:40:00,218
[SPEAKER_19]: to bring cable competition into this community that lacked for some 20 years.

428
00:40:00,758 --> 00:40:10,564
[SPEAKER_19]: For 20 years we had one cable provider, and it wasn't until several years back when Mayor McGlynn entered into a contract with Verizon to bring Fios

429
00:40:11,103 --> 00:40:13,905
[SPEAKER_19]: to allow cable competition into this community.

430
00:40:14,466 --> 00:40:21,792
[SPEAKER_19]: And anything that may or may not threaten that particular negotiation, Mr. President, is a concern of mine.

431
00:40:22,492 --> 00:40:33,521
[SPEAKER_19]: And some of the language in this, although I can support some of the other language, some of it talks about contracts and not entering into any new obligations and the purchase of project

432
00:40:33,922 --> 00:40:35,043
[SPEAKER_19]: products and services.

433
00:40:35,823 --> 00:40:46,530
[SPEAKER_19]: It's much more involved than just giving us support like we did with Tufts University and the custodians, which was a nod saying we empathize, we support you.

434
00:40:46,915 --> 00:40:47,575
[SPEAKER_19]: and so forth.

435
00:40:47,976 --> 00:41:05,326
[SPEAKER_19]: But I as one member, in good faith, the thousands, and I say thousands of Method residents that opted to leave Comcast and go to Verizon because they thought they could get a better competitive rate, they thought maybe Verizon was quicker and so forth, regarding cable, more dependable, who knows?

436
00:41:05,907 --> 00:41:16,293
[SPEAKER_19]: But I am not going to do anything tonight to jeopardize that contract that was signed back some years ago that I as one member and other members of this council fought very hard to bring

437
00:41:16,649 --> 00:41:18,830
[SPEAKER_19]: cable competition into this community.

438
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:24,713
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm not saying that's Councilman Knight's intent to eliminate one of the cable providers.

439
00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:31,276
[SPEAKER_19]: However, the language in here, I don't feel comfortable voting on this entire proposal, Mr. President.

440
00:41:31,996 --> 00:41:39,280
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, maybe a sentence or two stating that we as a city council support the workers, I have no problem with that.

441
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:44,322
[SPEAKER_19]: But anything other than that, Mr. President, in good faith, I cannot support that here tonight.

442
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:50,681
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's the reason why, Mr. President, if it remains the way it does, I cannot support this tonight.

443
00:41:50,881 --> 00:41:51,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Counselor.

444
00:41:51,561 --> 00:41:52,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Counselor Caviello?

445
00:41:52,521 --> 00:41:53,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

446
00:41:53,261 --> 00:42:01,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, you know, I think what started out here as a voice of support for the Men and Women Walking Alliance.

447
00:42:01,463 --> 00:42:08,404
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, before I came here tonight, I was at VFW and I shook hands with all the men and women on Mystic Avenue.

448
00:42:08,944 --> 00:42:14,365
[SPEAKER_05]: And I come from a family whose business was outsourced overseas.

449
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:24,082
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were a union facility for 60 years, and my whole family lost businesses because of jobs being sent overseas.

450
00:42:24,122 --> 00:42:28,703
[SPEAKER_05]: And I support all these men and women here tonight and the job they're doing.

451
00:42:28,723 --> 00:42:32,824
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, I don't think we came here to negotiate a contract for these guys.

452
00:42:36,145 --> 00:42:39,606
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're here just to give them a voice of support and that we stand behind them.

453
00:42:41,257 --> 00:42:41,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

454
00:42:42,718 --> 00:42:45,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair recognizes the speaker at the podium.

455
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Please state your name and address for the record.

456
00:42:47,882 --> 00:42:48,582
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

457
00:42:48,962 --> 00:42:51,164
[SPEAKER_18]: Rachel Tannenhaus, 26 Pearl Street.

458
00:42:53,025 --> 00:42:55,867
[SPEAKER_18]: I am a proud union member and steward.

459
00:42:56,608 --> 00:43:08,096
[SPEAKER_18]: I am not a Verizon employee, and I am not part of IBEW, but I wish solidarity to my fellow union members here.

460
00:43:09,742 --> 00:43:14,425
[SPEAKER_18]: walk by protests right near my office many times a week.

461
00:43:14,485 --> 00:43:20,968
[SPEAKER_18]: And I always thank the protesters, the employees striking out there.

462
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:24,670
[SPEAKER_18]: That having been said, I think that you want to do this right.

463
00:43:25,491 --> 00:43:30,193
[SPEAKER_18]: You want to do right by the employees here, and you want to do right by the citizens here.

464
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:36,437
[SPEAKER_18]: And so you want to make sure that you're actually doing something that you're allowed to do, because you don't want to, like,

465
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:41,473
[SPEAKER_18]: break the rules in the name of the union members here.

466
00:43:41,653 --> 00:43:46,537
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think that it's important to look at what the city council is and is not allowed to do.

467
00:43:46,977 --> 00:43:54,102
[SPEAKER_18]: If they're allowed to do these sorts of supportive things, yay, awesome, I am 100% in favor of them, and I'd like to state that.

468
00:43:54,482 --> 00:44:04,929
[SPEAKER_18]: But I also am a government employee, and I know that when there have been labor issues with folks that my employer has done business with, and I am not representing them here today,

469
00:44:07,038 --> 00:44:10,079
[SPEAKER_18]: there was not allowed to be any kind of official thing.

470
00:44:10,139 --> 00:44:30,265
[SPEAKER_18]: Like when Hyatt, and you'll notice there's a Hyatt down the way, when Hyatt was having their shady hiring practices going on, we were all really upset about it, but the state couldn't officially make a statement about, hey, Hyatt, you suck for doing this, even if people were really upset about it.

471
00:44:30,842 --> 00:44:40,831
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think that if it is allowed to make this statement, or to look at the contract or something like that, that's great, but you probably want to look at your rules.

472
00:44:43,898 --> 00:44:44,459
[SPEAKER_18]: around that.

473
00:44:44,739 --> 00:44:45,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

474
00:44:45,279 --> 00:44:47,620
[SPEAKER_18]: But if it is, absolutely do it.

475
00:44:47,820 --> 00:45:07,752
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that there is a difference between going around and telling local businesses, do this, don't do that, and looking at multinational, multi-continental corporations that, I mean, all right, let's be straight up here.

476
00:45:07,852 --> 00:45:11,334
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure any of the other telecommunications companies are doing any better, all right?

477
00:45:11,374 --> 00:45:12,795
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, they're all, like, wicked crooked.

478
00:45:13,183 --> 00:45:18,345
[SPEAKER_18]: But these guys are wicked crooked in public, apparently, which is not smart.

479
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:26,589
[SPEAKER_18]: And so since they happen to be the ones that we're noticing, I think that there is a huge difference looking at that.

480
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:30,271
[SPEAKER_18]: Verizon's a big company.

481
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:33,673
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not like they're terribly, it's not like we're hurting their feelings.

482
00:45:34,133 --> 00:45:34,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

483
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:35,994
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks.

484
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:42,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, sir.

485
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:44,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Please state your name and address for the record.

486
00:45:47,172 --> 00:45:50,153
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Nick Tomazook, 29 Garfield Ave.

487
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:53,854
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been a union member for over 40 years.

488
00:45:54,014 --> 00:45:56,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been fighting these corporations.

489
00:45:58,116 --> 00:45:58,916
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not going to help.

490
00:46:00,156 --> 00:46:10,620
[SPEAKER_03]: What you have to do is you have to stop all those lobbyists in Washington that are giving stuff away so they pass the bill, they can take all these jobs out of this country.

491
00:46:11,952 --> 00:46:15,733
[SPEAKER_03]: How the hell is anybody going to afford a house or anything else on minimum wage?

492
00:46:17,673 --> 00:46:20,834
[SPEAKER_03]: They take all the good IT jobs and they send them to India.

493
00:46:23,314 --> 00:46:25,114
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they're sending all those Indians here.

494
00:46:26,475 --> 00:46:32,716
[SPEAKER_03]: All the people that were involved with all the telecommunications in India, they're sending them here to work here.

495
00:46:34,196 --> 00:46:38,297
[SPEAKER_03]: What you have to do is get after Washington to pass a bill

496
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:43,522
[SPEAKER_03]: that it will cost you just as much to make a product in this country as it does in the other country.

497
00:46:44,683 --> 00:46:46,023
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll keep the jobs here.

498
00:46:47,344 --> 00:46:52,326
[SPEAKER_03]: But until that time, these corporations have all to say.

499
00:46:54,227 --> 00:46:54,908
[SPEAKER_03]: We have none.

500
00:46:56,408 --> 00:47:00,810
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have to get after those people down there and get rid of those lobbyists in Washington, D.C.

501
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:01,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

502
00:47:01,591 --> 00:47:04,672
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Councilor Knight for approval, all those in favor?

503
00:47:05,132 --> 00:47:05,913
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

504
00:47:07,273 --> 00:47:08,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

505
00:47:10,122 --> 00:47:31,808
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Vice President Ungel-Kern to resort to the regular order of business, hearings 16-426, notice of public hearing, City of Medford, July 1st, 2016, June 30th, 2017, annual action plan, year 42, development block grant application.

506
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:38,010
[SPEAKER_08]: A public hearing will be held by the City of Medford City Council and the Howard F. Alden Memorial Chambers

507
00:47:38,537 --> 00:47:41,059
[SPEAKER_08]: City Hall metric mass on Tuesday, May 3rd, 2016.

508
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:55,029
[SPEAKER_08]: The purpose of this public hearing will be to invite the general public and representatives of public service agencies to express comments regarding the city's annual action plan for community development and planning.

509
00:47:55,549 --> 00:47:59,492
[SPEAKER_08]: The action plan contains the proposed use of community development block grant funds

510
00:48:00,053 --> 00:48:05,436
[SPEAKER_08]: for year 42, which extends from July 1st, 2016 to June 30th, 2017.

511
00:48:06,397 --> 00:48:26,028
[SPEAKER_08]: The Office of Community Development will be requesting that the Medford City Council authorize Mayor Stephanie M. Burke, official representative of the city of Medford, to submit the one-year action plan application for funds and all other assurances and certifications to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.

512
00:48:26,489 --> 00:48:27,689
[SPEAKER_08]: The city is applying for

513
00:48:30,711 --> 00:48:34,433
[SPEAKER_08]: $1,403,910 in block grant funds.

514
00:48:34,973 --> 00:48:52,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Additional information and review of draft action plan can be obtained at the Office of Community Development, City Hall, Room 308, Medford during regular business hours on April 1st, April 13th, 2016 for public review and comment, et cetera.

515
00:48:53,604 --> 00:48:55,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Edward P. Finn, City Clerk.

516
00:48:56,243 --> 00:48:59,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilors, we all received the action plan in our packets over the weekend.

517
00:49:00,266 --> 00:49:08,553
[SPEAKER_08]: We discussed it in committee whole some several weeks ago, had presentations from all the representatives of the various charitable organizations.

518
00:49:09,194 --> 00:49:19,482
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have before us the year 42 draft action plan presented by Lauren DiLorenzo, our director of community development.

519
00:49:19,962 --> 00:49:22,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Before us at the rail is Ms.

520
00:49:22,044 --> 00:49:24,586
[SPEAKER_08]: DiLorenzo, and we invite her to present to us

521
00:49:25,783 --> 00:49:29,106
[SPEAKER_08]: the wonderful outcome of all these deliberations.

522
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:30,187
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

523
00:49:30,207 --> 00:49:31,107
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam Director.

524
00:49:32,228 --> 00:49:34,270
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for the opportunity to be before you again.

525
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:40,254
[SPEAKER_12]: The Community Development Block Grant Program, as many of you know, is an annual entitlement program.

526
00:49:40,274 --> 00:49:44,977
[SPEAKER_12]: The city is entitled to apply for it, but we have to follow a number of rules and regulations in order to

527
00:49:46,699 --> 00:49:49,641
[SPEAKER_12]: to receive that money and to spend it properly.

528
00:49:50,582 --> 00:49:53,525
[SPEAKER_12]: The Community Development Block Grant Program is administered by the U.S.

529
00:49:53,545 --> 00:49:58,989
[SPEAKER_12]: Department of Housing and Urban Development, and its primary purpose is to benefit low and moderate income citizens in the city.

530
00:49:59,009 --> 00:50:03,793
[SPEAKER_12]: It really isn't a source of money for supporting general municipal services.

531
00:50:03,853 --> 00:50:11,999
[SPEAKER_12]: It really is a targeted approach for community development and housing activities and employment activities, such as creation of jobs for people who are

532
00:50:13,535 --> 00:50:26,038
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, having a difficult time finding housing or jobs or living in conditions of housing that may be substandard or just not as up-to-date or as code-compliant as it should be.

533
00:50:26,738 --> 00:50:33,259
[SPEAKER_12]: So the actual plan that we submit is done on a computer, and we have a draft form of that.

534
00:50:33,319 --> 00:50:38,180
[SPEAKER_12]: I've given you a really general summary of that plan.

535
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,501
[SPEAKER_12]: So the plan that we submit is done on a computer system

536
00:50:41,998 --> 00:50:42,998
[SPEAKER_12]: And it is lengthy.

537
00:50:43,118 --> 00:50:44,819
[SPEAKER_12]: We analyze housing needs.

538
00:50:44,899 --> 00:50:49,200
[SPEAKER_12]: We identify resources and working relationships with our partner housing agencies.

539
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:57,043
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's a draft online and the final application will be put online at the city website for anybody who would like to look at that information.

540
00:50:57,063 --> 00:50:58,443
[SPEAKER_12]: It's also available up in our office.

541
00:50:59,663 --> 00:51:03,845
[SPEAKER_12]: We identify some general goals and these really are very consistent from year to year.

542
00:51:04,285 --> 00:51:05,305
[SPEAKER_12]: Housing is a goal.

543
00:51:05,867 --> 00:51:09,449
[SPEAKER_12]: We are allocating, we're recommending an allocation of $20,000 for that.

544
00:51:09,489 --> 00:51:14,731
[SPEAKER_12]: Now that seems small, it is small, but we also leverage our own resources with other resources.

545
00:51:15,152 --> 00:51:26,837
[SPEAKER_12]: The city is able to partner with other agencies and also to apply for home funds which are administered through a regional consortium and Medford is a partner agency of that.

546
00:51:27,277 --> 00:51:34,421
[SPEAKER_12]: We also are able to work with other agencies that provide housing services, non-profit agencies like Medford Community Housing.

547
00:51:34,811 --> 00:51:37,895
[SPEAKER_12]: So the number is low there, but we do leverage that with other resources.

548
00:51:39,617 --> 00:51:41,600
[SPEAKER_12]: Physical improvements to city systems.

549
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:48,228
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, this is a general catch-all for basically public facility improvements that are eligible under CDBG programs.

550
00:51:49,169 --> 00:51:53,675
[SPEAKER_12]: And in this, we include our general activities, water, sewer, street reconstruction.

551
00:51:54,096 --> 00:51:57,678
[SPEAKER_12]: Park Rehabilitation, which is eligible in low and moderate income areas only.

552
00:51:58,618 --> 00:52:01,300
[SPEAKER_12]: And some facility improvements.

553
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,882
[SPEAKER_12]: As I said previously, we really can't use this money for general purpose of city government.

554
00:52:05,902 --> 00:52:12,166
[SPEAKER_12]: So for instance, you want to do, as you can see, you need renovations at City Hall, would this be a good source of fund?

555
00:52:12,406 --> 00:52:14,727
[SPEAKER_12]: Unfortunately, it's not eligible for that activity.

556
00:52:15,868 --> 00:52:19,350
[SPEAKER_12]: The only way that we can really assist general purposes

557
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:24,733
[SPEAKER_12]: like the library, the schools, City Hall, is the removal of architectural barriers.

558
00:52:24,753 --> 00:52:32,437
[SPEAKER_12]: So we do do that often as, you know, the council has been active in funding removal of architectural barriers in other public facilities.

559
00:52:32,477 --> 00:52:35,038
[SPEAKER_12]: Most recently was at the Medford High School pool and locker room.

560
00:52:35,638 --> 00:52:43,383
[SPEAKER_12]: And this year we are going to use CDBG funds to do an ADA feasibility assessment at the public library.

561
00:52:44,123 --> 00:52:49,366
[SPEAKER_12]: And we hope that we'll be able to use CDBG funds to install an elevator there.

562
00:52:49,803 --> 00:52:54,407
[SPEAKER_12]: I think probably the ramp in the front needs to be upgraded, and we'll do a full assessment of the bathrooms.

563
00:52:54,447 --> 00:52:57,209
[SPEAKER_12]: I know the councils have been concerned about bathroom conditions.

564
00:52:57,249 --> 00:53:07,998
[SPEAKER_12]: It can't be a general upgrade in terms of beautification improvements, but again, we can use a CDBG portion of money to leverage other municipal funds or other kind of grants that may be available.

565
00:53:08,038 --> 00:53:08,679
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll do that.

566
00:53:08,859 --> 00:53:10,320
[SPEAKER_12]: That's intended to be under this program.

567
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:12,482
[SPEAKER_12]: We hope to get through the feasibility stage.

568
00:53:12,942 --> 00:53:17,765
[SPEAKER_12]: depending on where the general feasibility analysis happens with the overall improvements of the library.

569
00:53:17,785 --> 00:53:25,850
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, my goal is to get the elevator installed this year, but we do have to coordinate with other work that's being proposed, or will be proposed, I should say.

570
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:33,034
[SPEAKER_12]: A couple of these projects are ongoing, but they're in here anyways because some of the expenditures may have to happen after July 1st.

571
00:53:34,215 --> 00:53:37,677
[SPEAKER_12]: One, the most really significant one here is the Senior Center Renovations.

572
00:53:37,937 --> 00:53:40,538
[SPEAKER_12]: As you go by there, the Senior Center has two projects going on.

573
00:53:40,638 --> 00:53:41,439
[SPEAKER_12]: One is the Peace Garden.

574
00:53:41,826 --> 00:53:45,869
[SPEAKER_12]: and the other are the senior center renovations, which you have supported in the past.

575
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:49,372
[SPEAKER_12]: That's including roof replacement.

576
00:53:50,192 --> 00:53:53,895
[SPEAKER_12]: We are doing some masonry and waterproofing repairs on the exterior of the building.

577
00:53:54,295 --> 00:54:04,383
[SPEAKER_12]: There are some, we'll call them storefront improvements, which are really upgrades to the interior doors, the doors that enter and enter the building on both sides, the front and the back of the building.

578
00:54:04,903 --> 00:54:06,144
[SPEAKER_12]: We're replacing the flooring.

579
00:54:06,622 --> 00:54:13,187
[SPEAKER_12]: We are doing a small lift to get up to the stage that's inside the big general purpose room.

580
00:54:14,088 --> 00:54:19,332
[SPEAKER_12]: We have got some basically flooring, a little bit of carpeting in a couple of the office areas.

581
00:54:20,473 --> 00:54:23,195
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm probably missing something big, some painting.

582
00:54:23,536 --> 00:54:26,698
[SPEAKER_12]: So the senior center is in full construction mode right now.

583
00:54:26,718 --> 00:54:32,283
[SPEAKER_12]: The seniors have been very tolerant and have been very, you know, wonderful to work with quite honestly.

584
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:35,145
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they appreciate the investment that you're making in that building.

585
00:54:35,495 --> 00:54:37,837
[SPEAKER_12]: And I hope that you'll all be proud of it when it's completed.

586
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:47,343
[SPEAKER_12]: They did take a little reprieve from the billing for about three weeks so that the contractors could really get in there and work without having to worry about their safety as much as they do on a daily basis.

587
00:54:47,363 --> 00:54:50,666
[SPEAKER_12]: But generally the contractors are in there at 3 o'clock after the program is completed.

588
00:54:51,206 --> 00:54:55,929
[SPEAKER_12]: So that project is generally expected to be completed by June.

589
00:54:56,089 --> 00:54:59,572
[SPEAKER_12]: So hopefully that will happen shortly and we won't get into the next program year.

590
00:54:59,612 --> 00:55:02,594
[SPEAKER_12]: But we put that in here anyways just in case so we don't have to go through an amendment.

591
00:55:03,676 --> 00:55:13,638
[SPEAKER_12]: The mayor is working with the engineering department and DPW on priority areas and low and moderate income areas for street and sidewalk work.

592
00:55:13,798 --> 00:55:17,879
[SPEAKER_12]: So in terms of CDBG funding, that's really reconstructions, not repairs or maintenance.

593
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:24,541
[SPEAKER_12]: But she's working on that to identify what low and moderate income areas we can use CDBG money to upgrade.

594
00:55:24,561 --> 00:55:26,601
[SPEAKER_12]: So that will happen this program year.

595
00:55:27,189 --> 00:55:31,091
[SPEAKER_12]: Economic development has been an area that we have not usually spent that much money.

596
00:55:31,131 --> 00:55:39,316
[SPEAKER_12]: We used to spend a lot of money on that, but program regulations changed, which limited our ability to do general economic development activities.

597
00:55:40,117 --> 00:55:46,581
[SPEAKER_12]: We are going to allocate $100,000 and look at what we can do with the CDBG funds.

598
00:55:46,641 --> 00:55:52,184
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a little bit more limiting than what we could do with city sources of money, but we're going to do it anyway.

599
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:55,626
[SPEAKER_12]: So one will be the recreation of a storefront improvement program.

600
00:55:56,390 --> 00:56:04,135
[SPEAKER_12]: In order to participate in that program, the businesses will have to commit to creation or retention of low and moderate income jobs.

601
00:56:04,175 --> 00:56:16,404
[SPEAKER_12]: So it will be, you know, they won't, not every business will qualify, but the ones that can certainly will be welcome to participate and hopefully that will increase on the creation and retention of jobs and that can happen in the downtown areas.

602
00:56:17,304 --> 00:56:24,249
[SPEAKER_12]: And the other is just work, we got a small grant to do some, a business and economic development strategy in Medford Square.

603
00:56:24,805 --> 00:56:35,633
[SPEAKER_12]: But we've put this money in to just have some money available so that we may be able to continue that in other areas and also to leverage any additional activities that we may want to do in Medford Square.

604
00:56:36,553 --> 00:56:43,578
[SPEAKER_12]: Public services, so I don't think I said when you gave the number that basically it was a 2.1% cut from last year.

605
00:56:43,598 --> 00:56:46,621
[SPEAKER_12]: 15% of that allocation can go toward public services.

606
00:56:46,981 --> 00:56:49,322
[SPEAKER_12]: So we always fully allocate this to public services.

607
00:56:50,023 --> 00:56:52,425
[SPEAKER_12]: We did a little bit different on the

608
00:56:53,215 --> 00:56:56,516
[SPEAKER_12]: allocations which I can read if you would like, otherwise they're part of the package.

609
00:56:56,656 --> 00:56:57,456
[SPEAKER_12]: Would you like me to read them?

610
00:56:59,236 --> 00:57:01,137
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

611
00:57:01,237 --> 00:57:11,939
[SPEAKER_12]: I will point out that there was one agency that didn't apply again this year and there is a cut to the SCM community transportation to make up the difference in the deficit funding.

612
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:23,042
[SPEAKER_12]: And the reason why we picked them was basically they are the largest, it has nothing to do with the importance of the program and honestly it's a great program and we could spend a lot more money than that

613
00:57:23,392 --> 00:57:28,553
[SPEAKER_12]: But they do take up almost half of the block grant allocation.

614
00:57:28,593 --> 00:57:38,475
[SPEAKER_12]: So some of the agencies are getting little, you'll hear the amounts, and at some point it's not even feasible for them to receive a grant because they're getting such small amounts.

615
00:57:38,495 --> 00:57:43,516
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not that we wanted to cut it, but cuts did have to be made, and this is where the recommendation is.

616
00:57:44,136 --> 00:57:47,856
[SPEAKER_12]: Boys and Girls Club of Middlesex County, which is basically an after-school program, $1,937.

617
00:57:51,255 --> 00:57:51,855
[SPEAKER_12]: Bread of Life, $1,048.

618
00:57:51,895 --> 00:57:53,196
[SPEAKER_12]: Community Family, Inc., $1,745.

619
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:55,317
[SPEAKER_12]: Consumer Advisory Commission, $6,802.

620
00:57:55,357 --> 00:57:57,979
[SPEAKER_12]: The Council on Aging, $60,028, and that's for a few programs that they run.

621
00:57:57,999 --> 00:57:58,279
[SPEAKER_12]: EMARC, $4,533.

622
00:57:58,319 --> 00:57:59,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Heading Home, $3,778.

623
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:00,420
[SPEAKER_12]: Housing Families, $8,324.

624
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:24,156
[SPEAKER_12]: The Immigrant Learning Center, $3,778.

625
00:58:24,397 --> 00:58:28,038
[SPEAKER_12]: Medford Public Schools runs an after school program.

626
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:32,160
[SPEAKER_12]: This money goes to subsidize people who are low or moderate income.

627
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:33,161
[SPEAKER_12]: It's $8,505.

628
00:58:33,221 --> 00:58:34,401
[SPEAKER_12]: Mystic Valley Elder Services, $8,161.

629
00:58:34,441 --> 00:58:35,622
[SPEAKER_12]: Salvation Army, $1,162.

630
00:58:35,662 --> 00:58:37,523
[SPEAKER_12]: SCM Community Transportation, $80,000.

631
00:58:37,603 --> 00:58:41,164
[SPEAKER_12]: And the West Medford Community Center for the Senior Programming,

632
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:51,258
[SPEAKER_12]: and senior director, $20,485.

633
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:54,300
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's a total of $210,286.

634
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:55,700
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

635
00:59:06,906 --> 00:59:12,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Marks, do we have to do a public hearing process?

636
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:13,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

637
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:18,433
[SPEAKER_08]: So all those in, or anybody in favor of this, please present yourself.

638
00:59:19,248 --> 00:59:21,169
[SPEAKER_08]: and indicate so at the podium.

639
00:59:21,909 --> 00:59:22,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody in favor?

640
00:59:29,012 --> 00:59:30,192
[SPEAKER_08]: That will come up afterwards.

641
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:32,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody in opposition?

642
00:59:32,933 --> 00:59:34,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody in favor?

643
00:59:34,634 --> 00:59:38,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Hearing, seeing none, others, we close that portion of the public hearing closed.

644
00:59:39,436 --> 00:59:40,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody in opposition?

645
00:59:40,856 --> 00:59:41,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody in opposition?

646
00:59:42,457 --> 00:59:48,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Hearing, seeing none, we close, declare that portion of the public hearing closed and chair recognizes Council Martins.

647
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:50,431
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

648
00:59:51,191 --> 01:00:03,980
[SPEAKER_19]: Lauren, the economic development section, can that money be used for all of our business districts, or is it just allocated to the business districts in different economic sections of the city?

649
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:10,644
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we haven't created the guidelines for the program yet, and I'll have to re-look at and, you know, work with HUD to see what they're going to say to that.

650
01:00:10,684 --> 01:00:14,146
[SPEAKER_12]: But generally, it's more the business and the jobs that they're creating.

651
01:00:14,706 --> 01:00:18,569
[SPEAKER_12]: Any business that creates a low- and moderate-income job should be eligible for the program.

652
01:00:19,103 --> 01:00:29,927
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that we'll have to look at the amount and see whether it makes sense to, you know, you really want to get your impact with storefront improvements if that's generally what people use in a concentrated area to upgrade the area.

653
01:00:29,987 --> 01:00:40,131
[SPEAKER_12]: So, but yes, generally anybody, you know, we can do a citywide program if that's, you know, what we want to do, citywide program, but the criteria will really be based on the job creation and retention.

654
01:00:40,531 --> 01:00:40,831
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

655
01:00:40,911 --> 01:00:47,033
[SPEAKER_19]: But I remember some years back, I believe it was, I want to say it was the West Method Business District.

656
01:00:47,976 --> 01:00:50,078
[SPEAKER_19]: was not eligible for certain funding at the time.

657
01:00:50,158 --> 01:00:52,560
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't remember what the funding was for.

658
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:59,204
[SPEAKER_12]: We had, years ago, HUD has gotten more conservative, if that's possible.

659
01:00:59,605 --> 01:01:04,488
[SPEAKER_12]: So, years ago, we used to do the storefront program, and we would call it a slums and blight program.

660
01:01:04,528 --> 01:01:10,733
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, it sounds terrible, but that was the criteria, and the criteria for slums and blight work was a lot more lenient.

661
01:01:11,129 --> 01:01:20,873
[SPEAKER_12]: So what we would do is we'd basically take, like, Medford Square, and we'd do an analysis of inadequate infrastructure, maybe roads or sidewalks and conditions and buildings, et cetera.

662
01:01:21,293 --> 01:01:27,156
[SPEAKER_12]: And we would have documentation upstairs that would justify the slums of blight designation.

663
01:01:27,676 --> 01:01:28,856
[SPEAKER_12]: And we did that for a number of years.

664
01:01:28,896 --> 01:01:30,777
[SPEAKER_12]: Salem Street was one.

665
01:01:30,817 --> 01:01:32,778
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Gavin, who had an area, Medford Square.

666
01:01:33,218 --> 01:01:36,960
[SPEAKER_12]: The criteria changed, and HUD enforced that.

667
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:40,241
[SPEAKER_12]: So they actually made us stop doing the program that way.

668
01:01:42,172 --> 01:01:43,612
[SPEAKER_12]: How do I describe this now?

669
01:01:43,672 --> 01:01:50,253
[SPEAKER_12]: So now they follow the state guidelines on slums of blight, which is really what an urban renewal criteria is.

670
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:55,874
[SPEAKER_12]: And that means that 25% of the buildings in that area that you define have to be vacant.

671
01:01:56,495 --> 01:02:00,815
[SPEAKER_12]: And now they only want you to use the money for eliminating public safety issues.

672
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:10,097
[SPEAKER_12]: So for instance, if somebody had a cornice of a building that was falling down on their head outside, you could fix that, but you couldn't do the beautification improvements that we were doing,

673
01:02:10,948 --> 01:02:15,753
[SPEAKER_12]: the nice storefronts like we had done years ago and where Medford Square had originally been done.

674
01:02:16,394 --> 01:02:23,961
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's why West Medford just didn't qualify as a slums of blight area at that time for the criteria even at that time.

675
01:02:23,981 --> 01:02:34,672
[SPEAKER_12]: So now it probably wouldn't, I mean it definitely wouldn't qualify again as slums of blight, but perhaps the business itself may be serving enough people who are low and moderate income and have employees that

676
01:02:35,349 --> 01:02:41,153
[SPEAKER_12]: we can make some kind of justification that if they, you know, don't get this kind of assistance, they may lose jobs.

677
01:02:41,173 --> 01:02:44,415
[SPEAKER_12]: This is why it's all kind of related to an economic development strategy.

678
01:02:44,455 --> 01:02:59,384
[SPEAKER_19]: The Vice President My only concern is I just want to make sure that if funding is available in programs regarding improvements to facades and so forth, that all the business districts receive the same fair shake at any type of funding.

679
01:02:59,865 --> 01:03:03,427
[SPEAKER_19]: And if that can't be accomplished through this particular mechanism,

680
01:03:03,918 --> 01:03:10,943
[SPEAKER_19]: that the city allocate funds to help offset whatever can't be funded through this particular program?

681
01:03:11,504 --> 01:03:22,953
[SPEAKER_12]: I hear that, and I think ideally, I don't know what the budget will bring in terms of new funding for new programs, but ideally there would be another source of funding to match this.

682
01:03:22,973 --> 01:03:27,356
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know what it would be, but there'd be another source of funding that could be used more flexibly.

683
01:03:27,763 --> 01:03:41,216
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it would be nice to fund businesses like we did before that are just general upgrades to an area based on community development needs or economic development needs that can make an improvement in the appearance of some of these locations.

684
01:03:42,977 --> 01:03:43,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

685
01:03:44,899 --> 01:03:46,641
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there was a citizen who had a question.

686
01:03:54,583 --> 01:03:59,907
[SPEAKER_15]: So I had a couple of, oh, Rachel Tannenhaus, 26 Pearl Street.

687
01:04:03,549 --> 01:04:14,397
[SPEAKER_18]: I had a couple of questions about, I had some suggestions, but I don't know if they're feasible, because I don't quite, I haven't quite wrapped my brain around what the money can be used for and what it can't.

688
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:21,342
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the questions is, in terms of

689
01:04:22,933 --> 01:04:40,707
[SPEAKER_18]: retaining or creating jobs that are low or middle income, is it one of the most underemployed groups of people is, of course, people with disabilities.

690
01:04:42,548 --> 01:04:57,218
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometimes employers are concerned, while many of us don't require accommodations that cost any money, sometimes employers, Gesundheit, are concerned about spending money on accommodations that we may need.

691
01:04:57,998 --> 01:05:08,305
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it possible to have as an incentive or could one of the things to retain these jobs or to create these jobs be to have

692
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:23,627
[SPEAKER_18]: funds available that employers can apply for if they have an employee with a disability that requires an accommodation that costs money and they're not sure how they're going to do that, is that a sort of thing that could be set up as a potential program in the future?

693
01:05:24,047 --> 01:05:26,109
[SPEAKER_18]: Or is there money that could be leveraged towards that?

694
01:05:26,449 --> 01:05:30,491
[SPEAKER_18]: For example, I require software to be able to use a PC at work.

695
01:05:30,912 --> 01:05:31,612
[SPEAKER_18]: It costs money.

696
01:05:32,533 --> 01:05:34,074
[SPEAKER_18]: If I use a Mac, it doesn't cost money.

697
01:05:36,815 --> 01:05:51,766
[SPEAKER_18]: If somebody is hiring a person with my disability to work at a job that requires use of a computer and they use a PC, they may not be real excited about shelling out $500, even though they're legally supposed to do that.

698
01:05:52,346 --> 01:05:59,632
[SPEAKER_18]: But having the funds that they can apply for for the city may make them more likely to not think twice about hiring a person with a disability.

699
01:06:02,172 --> 01:06:02,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

700
01:06:02,472 --> 01:06:06,716
[SPEAKER_08]: DiLorenzo can try to answer that for us.

701
01:06:06,797 --> 01:06:07,998
[SPEAKER_18]: That is awesome.

702
01:06:08,158 --> 01:06:17,407
[SPEAKER_18]: And also the other thing is that in Cambridge, which I realize is its own planet, but in Cambridge they do have a facade improvement program.

703
01:06:17,427 --> 01:06:23,893
[SPEAKER_18]: And one of the things they do, and again this might involve leveraging other money using this, is that they have

704
01:06:25,604 --> 01:06:37,552
[SPEAKER_18]: If you make sure that when you are altering your facade that the entrance is completely accessible, et cetera, they will match the funds used for that, I think.

705
01:06:38,193 --> 01:06:47,659
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure exactly what the details are, but that's one of those things where they will, if you do that and you can apply for certain facade improvement funds,

706
01:06:48,018 --> 01:06:51,521
[SPEAKER_18]: And you can get more of them if you improve the accessibility.

707
01:06:51,581 --> 01:06:53,462
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's another possible thing.

708
01:06:53,762 --> 01:07:00,747
[SPEAKER_18]: It means that people with disabilities can not only spend money at these businesses, but we can also be employed by them if we can get in the door.

709
01:07:01,528 --> 01:07:02,429
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

710
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:06,992
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'll address the second item first.

711
01:07:07,172 --> 01:07:10,895
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, CDBG funds can be used for the removal of architectural barriers.

712
01:07:10,935 --> 01:07:14,818
[SPEAKER_12]: So doorways, thresholds, they tend to be a little bit more costly.

713
01:07:16,106 --> 01:07:20,249
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we may have to have a higher offset limit for those activities, but yes.

714
01:07:20,689 --> 01:07:22,550
[SPEAKER_12]: In terms of software, I do not believe so.

715
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:32,735
[SPEAKER_12]: HUD has, right, some things that like equipment, computers, equipment, or some kind of, but ramps to get in, yes.

716
01:07:32,835 --> 01:07:39,499
[SPEAKER_12]: Anything that's a removal of an architectural barrier that's a physical improvement can be used, CDBG funds can be used for that.

717
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:41,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

718
01:07:44,422 --> 01:07:45,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have a motion?

719
01:07:47,292 --> 01:07:50,756
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion for approval by Councillor Knight, seconded by Councillor Caviello.

720
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:52,378
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favour?

721
01:07:52,398 --> 01:07:55,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we need a roll call on this, Mr. Clerk?

722
01:07:57,884 --> 01:07:58,785
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll have a roll call.

723
01:07:59,585 --> 01:08:00,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

724
01:08:01,927 --> 01:08:03,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

725
01:08:03,429 --> 01:08:04,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

726
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:04,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

727
01:08:07,492 --> 01:08:07,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

728
01:08:08,934 --> 01:08:09,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

729
01:08:10,395 --> 01:08:10,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

730
01:08:10,815 --> 01:08:13,478
[SPEAKER_08]: With the vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

731
01:08:13,938 --> 01:08:16,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations for another years of good work.

732
01:08:16,461 --> 01:08:17,441
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

733
01:08:17,822 --> 01:08:18,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

734
01:08:19,123 --> 01:08:24,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, before we take 16, four 55 council card yellow,

735
01:08:41,125 --> 01:08:41,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

736
01:08:43,867 --> 01:08:44,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion 16.455.

737
01:08:46,928 --> 01:08:48,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Offered by Vice President Longo Kern.

738
01:08:48,669 --> 01:08:55,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council meet with the Office of Community Development to discuss the Meadow Glen Mall redevelopment.

739
01:08:56,073 --> 01:08:59,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it further resolved that the developer be invited to the said meeting.

740
01:08:59,815 --> 01:09:00,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Longo Kern.

741
01:09:01,436 --> 01:09:05,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Jeanne, I think Jeanne trying to grab Lauren DiLorenzo.

742
01:09:05,538 --> 01:09:08,880
[SPEAKER_11]: I should have grabbed her for this before she escaped.

743
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:25,487
[SPEAKER_11]: I had put this on the agenda about a month ago with regards to the Meadow Glen Mall redevelopment and how we should be updated and have a meeting, committee of the whole meeting to discuss with OCD.

744
01:09:30,058 --> 01:09:42,862
[SPEAKER_11]: With Lauren DiLorenzo and OCD, as well as invite the developer down, there are a number of residents who live in the area, and there's also a lot of questions and concerns with regards to the development and the landscape.

745
01:09:44,362 --> 01:09:45,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Lauren, thank you for coming back.

746
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:56,785
[SPEAKER_11]: It be resolved that the Memphis City Council meet with your office, yourself, and possibly a representative from the development team for the Meadow Glen Mall.

747
01:09:56,805 --> 01:09:59,146
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you'd be ready to give us an update

748
01:09:59,513 --> 01:10:02,655
[SPEAKER_11]: With regards to that, there's a number of concerns.

749
01:10:02,735 --> 01:10:09,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, there's a number of residents that live in the Mystic Valley Towers, as well as the Parkway condominiums.

750
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:17,122
[SPEAKER_11]: There's issues with regards to, or just questions and concerns with regards to the landscape that's gonna be used around the Meadow Glen Mall redevelopment.

751
01:10:17,763 --> 01:10:20,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there gonna be solar panels?

752
01:10:22,485 --> 01:10:25,567
[SPEAKER_11]: The drainage system, are there gonna be any walkways?

753
01:10:26,212 --> 01:10:29,835
[SPEAKER_11]: How is the, you know, is there going to be an improvement in lighting in the parking lots?

754
01:10:29,875 --> 01:10:31,236
[SPEAKER_11]: Will there be additional parking?

755
01:10:31,316 --> 01:10:33,037
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I don't know what you'd be able to update us on.

756
01:10:33,397 --> 01:10:33,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

757
01:10:33,677 --> 01:10:37,080
[SPEAKER_12]: So, they actually, they didn't go through any of the boards.

758
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:40,102
[SPEAKER_12]: It was basically a building rehab project.

759
01:10:40,122 --> 01:10:42,504
[SPEAKER_12]: So, they worked directly with the building department.

760
01:10:42,544 --> 01:10:44,105
[SPEAKER_12]: They did have a number of meetings with us.

761
01:10:44,645 --> 01:10:46,286
[SPEAKER_12]: There are landscaping improvements.

762
01:10:47,427 --> 01:10:55,853
[SPEAKER_12]: There, let's see, there is going to be some better pedestrian connections and some accommodations for bicycle

763
01:10:56,497 --> 01:11:04,600
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, there's not, there's improvements in drainage on the site, but there's still quite a bit of parking in the parking lot, as you can imagine.

764
01:11:06,221 --> 01:11:15,404
[SPEAKER_12]: I think if you would like to invite a representative to come to a committee of the whole meeting, say, I'm sure they would come, they would attend, they'd do a presentation for you if you'd like that.

765
01:11:16,265 --> 01:11:16,445
[SPEAKER_12]: But.

766
01:11:17,565 --> 01:11:19,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean, that's what I'm looking for.

767
01:11:19,026 --> 01:11:22,827
[SPEAKER_11]: There are residents who have, I think, emailed all of us with concerns.

768
01:11:22,947 --> 01:11:25,068
[SPEAKER_11]: I know there's a couple engineers that live in

769
01:11:25,578 --> 01:11:29,080
[SPEAKER_11]: the condominiums and people that are very concerned.

770
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:35,104
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd love to be able to have the residents that have the questions, have them answered with the developer, with your office.

771
01:11:35,665 --> 01:11:40,368
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd love to see the plans and be on top of it like we are on some other projects within the city.

772
01:11:41,108 --> 01:11:47,672
[SPEAKER_12]: So the building construction plans are a little bit different than if they went through a site plan review process, but those are available for anybody to see.

773
01:11:47,692 --> 01:11:49,333
[SPEAKER_12]: They should be able to see them at the building department.

774
01:11:50,054 --> 01:11:54,657
[SPEAKER_12]: And yes, if you would like to do a presentation, I'd be happy to call them and see.

775
01:11:56,001 --> 01:11:58,962
[SPEAKER_12]: If Ed works with me on a couple of times, I'd be happy to do that if you'd like that.

776
01:11:59,823 --> 01:12:01,583
[SPEAKER_11]: And do you know if they're doing solar panels?

777
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:07,085
[SPEAKER_12]: I do not think they're doing solar panels, but I think the lighting in the parking lot may have some solar.

778
01:12:07,485 --> 01:12:21,370
[SPEAKER_12]: Alicia was in on, Alicia Hunt, the director of energy environment, was in on some of the department head meetings, and she has her standard questions that she does ask people, so I know she did bring it up to them, but I do not believe they're doing solar panels.

779
01:12:22,729 --> 01:12:42,063
[SPEAKER_11]: I did ask for this meeting about a month ago, so I'll just ask the president kindly again if we could set up a meeting sometime, maybe the end of May before we start our budget hearings, a time that we can invite residents and the developer and Office of Community Development so we can review the plans and ask any concerns, ask questions with regards to the project.

780
01:12:42,123 --> 01:12:46,386
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a massive project that I believe is going to take a couple years to finish.

781
01:12:48,265 --> 01:12:49,346
[SPEAKER_11]: We always ask.

782
01:12:49,366 --> 01:12:57,392
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a filing to the Community Development Board, actually for the Board of Appeals, but the site plan part of it goes to the Community Development Board for a project across the street.

783
01:12:57,412 --> 01:12:59,014
[SPEAKER_12]: So there is a lot of work going on there.

784
01:12:59,034 --> 01:13:09,122
[SPEAKER_12]: There'll be a Community Development Board meeting on the Locust Street project at the Shaw site on May 18th at 6 o'clock in room 201, so anybody's welcome to come to that.

785
01:13:09,708 --> 01:13:18,951
[SPEAKER_12]: who would like to do that, and there is coordination between the two teams, between the proposed Wegmans and Meadow Glen Mall, and with this project.

786
01:13:18,971 --> 01:13:23,352
[SPEAKER_12]: So there is proposed coordination such as pedestrian crossings and improvements.

787
01:13:23,372 --> 01:13:30,215
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that, in general, there is a lot of development, but I think that you'll see quite an upgrade to what exists currently.

788
01:13:30,615 --> 01:13:36,477
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think you'll be happy with it, though I'm sure everything can be improved from what the original proposals always are.

789
01:13:36,917 --> 01:13:37,157
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

790
01:13:37,757 --> 01:13:42,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I would just ask that that meeting be called the end of May so that we can, you know, sit down with the developer.

791
01:13:42,978 --> 01:13:45,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it would be very interesting to see how we're going to connect the Shaw site.

792
01:13:45,959 --> 01:13:50,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have any potential buyers for, or, you know, can you give us an update on the Shaw site?

793
01:13:50,841 --> 01:13:55,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so the Shaw site, there was a plan for 490 luxury apartment units.

794
01:13:56,142 --> 01:13:59,603
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, they know they have to do a component of affordable housing in that.

795
01:14:00,403 --> 01:14:02,264
[SPEAKER_12]: They submitted this past week.

796
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:05,276
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a pretty intense set of plans.

797
01:14:05,796 --> 01:14:06,936
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they're well prepared.

798
01:14:06,956 --> 01:14:13,138
[SPEAKER_12]: The question of density, pedestrian access, and those kind of things, we had a meeting with them today.

799
01:14:13,178 --> 01:14:25,883
[SPEAKER_12]: The department heads to go over and ask some questions so they had an understanding of what the water and sewer requirements would be and what existing conditions are, what landscaping and site access will be, how much parking they'll provide.

800
01:14:27,201 --> 01:14:30,766
[SPEAKER_12]: There's had been a couple of meetings before that with these people.

801
01:14:30,907 --> 01:14:34,352
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, originally they've been around for a while, so they own the property, they own the straw site.

802
01:14:34,712 --> 01:14:37,497
[SPEAKER_12]: They originally tried to lease it out for a retail kind of purpose.

803
01:14:37,517 --> 01:14:43,085
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, quite honestly, the inquiries of people when it was up for sale and they were accepting bids on that property.

804
01:14:43,415 --> 01:14:50,158
[SPEAKER_12]: The calls that we were getting in my office were on storage and things like that, were pretty low level, not very exciting uses.

805
01:14:50,738 --> 01:15:02,363
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think at some point, well I know when the point was, when Wegmans appeared to be making a commitment to Meadow Glen Mall and the upgrades were happening at Meadow Glen Mall, it really changed

806
01:15:03,383 --> 01:15:09,947
[SPEAKER_12]: the interest of the other site and the possibility that something in a higher, better use could be developed at that location.

807
01:15:10,007 --> 01:15:13,069
[SPEAKER_12]: So they met with us.

808
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:16,091
[SPEAKER_12]: Just like, honestly, we met with the mall people.

809
01:15:16,151 --> 01:15:17,732
[SPEAKER_12]: We had wanted a mixed-use development there.

810
01:15:17,952 --> 01:15:21,935
[SPEAKER_12]: And we recommended a mixed-use development at this location, too.

811
01:15:22,355 --> 01:15:28,699
[SPEAKER_12]: But the economy generates and really dictates what people, developers, are willing to do with their land.

812
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:32,742
[SPEAKER_12]: So they have gone from a completely residential project to adding some

813
01:15:33,164 --> 01:15:41,187
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, the Eastern Bank would stay not in their building, but as a tenant on the first floor of one of the buildings.

814
01:15:41,207 --> 01:15:42,107
[SPEAKER_12]: There's three buildings.

815
01:15:42,127 --> 01:15:50,030
[SPEAKER_12]: They're quite long, but their frontage on the main street of Locust Street is fairly narrow, with two driveways going down between three buildings.

816
01:15:50,770 --> 01:15:56,572
[SPEAKER_12]: And they are willing to put in at least 4,000 square feet of retail, though we're trying to get them to increase that.

817
01:15:57,347 --> 01:16:04,170
[SPEAKER_12]: But so this discussion and meetings will be open and I'm sure when it gets to the CD board, there'll be a lot more comments on that project too.

818
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:05,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

819
01:16:05,150 --> 01:16:07,952
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much for the update for both sites.

820
01:16:08,232 --> 01:16:10,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and I look forward to hopefully a meeting in the near future.

821
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:11,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you ma'am.

822
01:16:11,753 --> 01:16:13,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice president council Scott Pelly.

823
01:16:14,285 --> 01:16:14,925
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can, thank you.

824
01:16:15,225 --> 01:16:20,947
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may, Mr. President, bring this forward.

825
01:16:21,767 --> 01:16:26,608
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to make sure that someone from the building department, you mentioned that, should be at this meeting.

826
01:16:26,628 --> 01:16:28,789
[SPEAKER_06]: The building department should definitely be representative.

827
01:16:29,169 --> 01:16:35,051
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you want to get into storm, drainage, or environment, we might as well invite the city engineer and police.

828
01:16:35,071 --> 01:16:36,271
[SPEAKER_12]: You can have everybody there.

829
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:41,253
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would say the relevant departments would be happy to work with that to identify who those are.

830
01:16:41,273 --> 01:16:42,313
[SPEAKER_06]: If we could just add those.

831
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:44,420
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

832
01:16:45,241 --> 01:16:45,821
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Falcone.

833
01:16:46,182 --> 01:16:47,162
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

834
01:16:47,522 --> 01:16:50,844
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you to Councilor Langelker for bringing this forward.

835
01:16:51,605 --> 01:16:53,666
[SPEAKER_17]: I agree that we definitely need to have a meeting.

836
01:16:53,926 --> 01:16:57,448
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a major development that's going to impact that neighborhood.

837
01:16:58,869 --> 01:17:07,895
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been getting many questions as well throughout the community, just specifically about the timeframe of the project, the layout of the area, but in particular the traffic.

838
01:17:08,995 --> 01:17:11,577
[SPEAKER_17]: Do we know, is the parking lot going to

839
01:17:13,112 --> 01:17:16,795
[SPEAKER_17]: remain the same as far as the way it's cut right now, the entrance, the exits.

840
01:17:16,855 --> 01:17:18,617
[SPEAKER_17]: Are there going to be any changes to that?

841
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:20,339
[SPEAKER_17]: Has there been any talk about traffic?

842
01:17:20,679 --> 01:17:21,019
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yes.

843
01:17:21,099 --> 01:17:22,420
[SPEAKER_12]: There's always talk about traffic.

844
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:30,528
[SPEAKER_17]: If you take a look at that project and then the project over at Shaw's, you're talking about a major amount of cars compared to what

845
01:17:31,415 --> 01:17:32,536
[SPEAKER_17]: the traffic flow down there now.

846
01:17:32,696 --> 01:17:35,117
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you could talk a little bit about traffic.

847
01:17:35,157 --> 01:17:35,297
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

848
01:17:35,337 --> 01:17:42,300
[SPEAKER_12]: So there are traffic studies that were prepared for both sites, and there will be an increase of traffic, but not over what's currently existing.

849
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:47,142
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm going to say how I want to qualify that is that some of the uses weren't really used very well.

850
01:17:47,922 --> 01:17:52,304
[SPEAKER_12]: But if they stand a traffic report, we'll look at numbers from a traffic manual.

851
01:17:52,445 --> 01:17:52,585
[SPEAKER_12]: And if

852
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:55,471
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, that's how they prepare their studies.

853
01:17:55,491 --> 01:18:09,722
[SPEAKER_12]: So based on those, it's not as great an increase as you would think because of all the retail use that was already at Meadow Glen Mall and because of the Shaw's site is technically a retail use, which is a higher generator of traffic than an apartment building.

854
01:18:09,882 --> 01:18:11,243
[SPEAKER_12]: So there is a lot.

855
01:18:11,623 --> 01:18:19,209
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we have some scheduled improvements that are being proposed by the developer themselves, at least of the Shaw site.

856
01:18:19,627 --> 01:18:24,209
[SPEAKER_12]: And those would be, they have been attached as conditions, but I'm certainly going to recommend them.

857
01:18:24,669 --> 01:18:26,110
[SPEAKER_12]: Things like signal retiming.

858
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:29,671
[SPEAKER_12]: So signal retiming at Locust Street and Riverside Avenue and Ross Street.

859
01:18:30,012 --> 01:18:32,413
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the same at Mystic Valley Parkway and Freedom Drive.

860
01:18:33,373 --> 01:18:42,897
[SPEAKER_12]: And this developer today, his traffic engineer, committed to them also making any required ADA improvements that are necessary.

861
01:18:42,957 --> 01:18:49,220
[SPEAKER_12]: Now they will have to work with the state to get approvals on state roadways, but in terms of local roadways, I don't think that's going to be an issue in terms of getting approvals.

862
01:18:52,499 --> 01:18:57,062
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody who comes in the door now has some general discussions when we approach them.

863
01:18:57,642 --> 01:19:02,405
[SPEAKER_12]: Pedestrian amenities, pedestrian facilities, bicycle amenities, bicycle facilities.

864
01:19:02,505 --> 01:19:05,347
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody is pretty much going for parking variances.

865
01:19:05,467 --> 01:19:07,488
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, Meadow Glen Mall didn't need any variances.

866
01:19:08,088 --> 01:19:13,172
[SPEAKER_12]: They're actually providing more parking than we require by ordinance for the retail use.

867
01:19:13,612 --> 01:19:18,755
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is because Wegmans has asked for parking in the concern that they wouldn't have enough parking.

868
01:19:19,358 --> 01:19:21,739
[SPEAKER_12]: The other project would be asking for parking variances.

869
01:19:22,019 --> 01:19:30,803
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, the idea of transit-oriented development is that you wouldn't need as much parking if you're really using public transportation.

870
01:19:30,823 --> 01:19:33,404
[SPEAKER_12]: So we don't just take that for granted.

871
01:19:33,464 --> 01:19:34,564
[SPEAKER_12]: We ask people.

872
01:19:34,864 --> 01:19:36,165
[SPEAKER_12]: So I saw the traffic study.

873
01:19:36,185 --> 01:19:37,845
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just reading it before I came down here.

874
01:19:38,466 --> 01:19:41,947
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a presentation today, and on the Loca Street Shaw site project.

875
01:19:42,986 --> 01:19:45,788
[SPEAKER_12]: They did their calculations very conservatively.

876
01:19:45,808 --> 01:19:48,851
[SPEAKER_12]: So they were estimating 10% of people would use public transportation.

877
01:19:48,931 --> 01:19:52,053
[SPEAKER_12]: In general, in Medford, based on the last census, it's 25%.

878
01:19:52,194 --> 01:19:55,396
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's good that they're underestimating how many people will go.

879
01:19:55,937 --> 01:19:59,540
[SPEAKER_12]: And there'll be accommodations for bicycle parking inside the buildings.

880
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:06,846
[SPEAKER_12]: We will ask them to do a transportation demand management program, which would be providing information on public transit.

881
01:20:07,691 --> 01:20:21,424
[SPEAKER_12]: how people can access it and all the other ride share programs and commuter programs and taking steps to encourage people to pretty much take the commute to work by public transit.

882
01:20:21,464 --> 01:20:25,388
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't eliminate the need for cars and there will be parking on site.

883
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:32,869
[SPEAKER_12]: Pedestrian amenities are just, you know, kind of safe and attractive sidewalks and safe crossings.

884
01:20:33,309 --> 01:20:38,271
[SPEAKER_12]: We went over the idea of, they have an idea of which would cause, of course, need traffic commission approval.

885
01:20:38,291 --> 01:20:53,154
[SPEAKER_12]: We're putting this new high intensity light across the crosswalk that goes basically from, it's a, let's see, it's the one that goes from the bus shelter across to the Shaw site.

886
01:20:53,194 --> 01:20:54,514
[SPEAKER_12]: So it would be one,

887
01:20:55,506 --> 01:20:57,687
[SPEAKER_12]: signalized, but it's not like a street signal.

888
01:20:57,707 --> 01:21:02,169
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a pedestrian activated signal for when people cross over Locust Street.

889
01:21:02,829 --> 01:21:07,631
[SPEAKER_12]: And I haven't seen the details of what that light looks like yet, but I think that's a good step.

890
01:21:07,651 --> 01:21:09,952
[SPEAKER_12]: So they seem to be willing to make the commitments of what they need to do.

891
01:21:10,012 --> 01:21:22,737
[SPEAKER_12]: We talked about, I'm going to give you the whole thing now, if you want it, but we talked about connections to the streets in the back, where Cummings is and the other streets are, and making sure that people can

892
01:21:23,497 --> 01:21:28,900
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to want to take the least route of travel, and they've had that connection on the Shaw site.

893
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:41,708
[SPEAKER_12]: So that needs a little bit of work, and I think the city's probably going to have to give them, maybe, perhaps an easement of something over some of their property over near Hormel Stadium in order to have a legal passageway.

894
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:43,469
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's that.

895
01:21:43,969 --> 01:21:48,192
[SPEAKER_12]: There's quite a lot, and it's a big project.

896
01:21:48,512 --> 01:21:49,092
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a big project.

897
01:21:49,452 --> 01:21:51,954
[SPEAKER_17]: Has there been any talk about, like I noticed,

898
01:21:53,590 --> 01:21:56,791
[SPEAKER_17]: 490 units, so what are we talking as far as height?

899
01:21:57,811 --> 01:22:00,751
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, do we know how tall these buildings are going to be?

900
01:22:00,971 --> 01:22:12,833
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they're going four, I haven't looked at the exact number, but they're going four and five stories, so I'm gonna guess it's probably 75 feet of height, but I don't really know the number off the top of my head, so I shouldn't use it, but I'm gonna guess it's about 75 feet.

901
01:22:13,073 --> 01:22:14,214
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's four or five stories?

902
01:22:14,374 --> 01:22:15,134
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

903
01:22:17,494 --> 01:22:20,775
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I was thinking, is that it would require a variance in that area?

904
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:21,575
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, pretty much.

905
01:22:22,404 --> 01:22:24,806
[SPEAKER_12]: The, there's a lot of variances required.

906
01:22:25,126 --> 01:22:37,555
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if everybody remembers here when we actually zoned that to residential at one point, and then the economy, Mr. Farese, poor Mr. Farese never got, never got his building started, and then it was rezoned back to industrial.

907
01:22:37,575 --> 01:22:38,455
[SPEAKER_12]: See, I'm really dating myself.

908
01:22:39,236 --> 01:22:45,180
[SPEAKER_12]: When, when Shaw's, whatever the supermarket was that started with Shaw's was, and we were at the time lucky to get that.

909
01:22:45,784 --> 01:22:48,306
[SPEAKER_12]: And so here we go again with residential at that site.

910
01:22:48,326 --> 01:22:52,188
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's an industrial zone and it does require use variances and a number of other variances.

911
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:57,532
[SPEAKER_17]: So now as a comparison, if those are going to be four or five stories, how tall are Mystic Towers doing?

912
01:22:57,572 --> 01:22:57,792
[SPEAKER_17]: How long?

913
01:22:58,032 --> 01:22:59,313
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, that's probably, I'm going to say 10 or 12.

914
01:22:59,353 --> 01:22:59,433
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

915
01:22:59,453 --> 01:23:00,573
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I was thinking.

916
01:23:00,854 --> 01:23:00,994
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

917
01:23:01,034 --> 01:23:01,294
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

918
01:23:01,554 --> 01:23:03,756
[SPEAKER_12]: It is far as, uh, it's not, it's not going to be close to that.

919
01:23:03,776 --> 01:23:09,679
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be more like the, um, more like I'd say station landings, maybe, uh, maybe one floor lower than that.

920
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:12,721
[SPEAKER_17]: Do we know if I, I'm not sure if you know the answer to this question.

921
01:23:12,741 --> 01:23:13,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe three and four stories.

922
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:15,019
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, three and four.

923
01:23:15,059 --> 01:23:17,920
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm still getting familiar with the plans myself, but maybe three and four stories.

924
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:18,340
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

925
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:24,341
[SPEAKER_17]: And do we know if that's a, does that pose a problem for any of our emergency vehicles, fire trucks or anything like that?

926
01:23:24,401 --> 01:23:25,461
[SPEAKER_17]: As far as if it was an issue.

927
01:23:25,481 --> 01:23:26,861
[SPEAKER_12]: The height of the building should be an issue.

928
01:23:26,881 --> 01:23:28,502
[SPEAKER_12]: There'll be fully sprinkled buildings.

929
01:23:28,582 --> 01:23:31,682
[SPEAKER_12]: When we go through, we, the fire department was represented at the meeting today.

930
01:23:32,182 --> 01:23:34,943
[SPEAKER_12]: Site circulation and access to buildings is always discussed.

931
01:23:35,143 --> 01:23:39,824
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it should not be approved if it does create, create a problem.

932
01:23:39,924 --> 01:23:41,444
[SPEAKER_17]: Did the fire department have any concerns?

933
01:23:41,913 --> 01:23:46,175
[SPEAKER_12]: they always have concerns about width of the streets and circulation and access.

934
01:23:46,195 --> 01:23:49,497
[SPEAKER_12]: So those kinds of concerns were raised again today.

935
01:23:49,537 --> 01:23:50,678
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you very much.

936
01:23:50,698 --> 01:23:50,938
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

937
01:23:52,539 --> 01:23:53,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

938
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,380
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

939
01:23:55,500 --> 01:24:09,588
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't know if this is a question for Lauren, but in general, um, we, uh, I don't know, it was probably close to a year ago when we had, uh, the projects on Riverside Ave, the Panera, the noodles and the smash burger.

940
01:24:09,988 --> 01:24:11,789
[SPEAKER_19]: There was a lot of discussion at the time and,

941
01:24:12,828 --> 01:24:21,711
[SPEAKER_19]: I've offered a couple of resolutions on what I thought were stipulations put on some of the licenses.

942
01:24:22,411 --> 01:24:33,815
[SPEAKER_19]: One was that the entrance to the stop and shop on Riverside Ave, there was supposed to be a marking on the street that prohibited cars from actually blocking the entrance.

943
01:24:34,596 --> 01:24:35,676
[SPEAKER_19]: And that never happened.

944
01:24:36,336 --> 01:24:41,498
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, one of the stipulations was to have the crosswalk across from Panera Noodles

945
01:24:42,189 --> 01:24:47,953
[SPEAKER_19]: and Smashburger replaced from the gas station down to the other gas station on the Fells way.

946
01:24:48,573 --> 01:24:50,014
[SPEAKER_19]: And that has yet to happen.

947
01:24:50,795 --> 01:24:59,901
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, you know, my, my concern is, uh, someone that, uh, lives in the area and drives the area is from locus street down to the Fells way.

948
01:25:00,382 --> 01:25:02,063
[SPEAKER_19]: The road is not clearly marked.

949
01:25:02,703 --> 01:25:09,348
[SPEAKER_19]: So it appears to be a two lane road, but, and people drive it as a two lane road, but there's no dividing line.

950
01:25:10,508 --> 01:25:20,511
[SPEAKER_19]: Secondly, the sidewalks, if you walk down any portion of Riverside Ave, going to Locust or going to the Felsway, there are trucks parked all over the sidewalks.

951
01:25:20,791 --> 01:25:23,512
[SPEAKER_19]: You cannot walk down without going in the middle of the street.

952
01:25:24,792 --> 01:25:36,736
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, these projects may create a safe walking area, pedestrian area on Locust Street, but once you exit Locust Street onto Riverside Ave, there the problem presents itself.

953
01:25:37,616 --> 01:25:39,617
[SPEAKER_19]: And I have a lot of concerns about

954
01:25:40,472 --> 01:25:48,078
[SPEAKER_19]: The size of this particular project, I'm not against building, you know, I welcome it, but this is a huge project, 490 units.

955
01:25:48,318 --> 01:25:50,800
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's 780 parking spots.

956
01:25:51,560 --> 01:26:01,307
[SPEAKER_19]: From what I read in the local paper, the developer had a traffic impact study and said there'll be absolutely no impact at all to that area, bringing in 490 units.

957
01:26:02,688 --> 01:26:03,268
[SPEAKER_19]: Good luck to them.

958
01:26:03,308 --> 01:26:09,533
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure, you know, if those people live in the area, but I could just tell you coming down Riverside Ave every day,

959
01:26:09,927 --> 01:26:15,511
[SPEAKER_19]: The cars queue from the Fellsway all the way up to the fire station on Riverside Ave.

960
01:26:16,212 --> 01:26:21,876
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's without this project and without the improvements that are being done to the Meadow Glen Mall.

961
01:26:22,416 --> 01:26:26,119
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's some grave concern that we have to discuss as a council.

962
01:26:26,479 --> 01:26:29,381
[SPEAKER_19]: And these are public safety concerns in the area.

963
01:26:30,082 --> 01:26:37,067
[SPEAKER_19]: And growth is fine and development is fine, but I think we have to take a long look at the infrastructure.

964
01:26:37,828 --> 01:26:39,589
[SPEAKER_19]: And this city has yet to

965
01:26:40,828 --> 01:26:43,990
[SPEAKER_19]: bring its infrastructure up to the 21st century.

966
01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:48,853
[SPEAKER_19]: And Riverside Ave is notorious, especially in that stretch from Locust to the Fellsway.

967
01:26:50,253 --> 01:27:04,441
[SPEAKER_19]: And we did very little to help alleviate the concern from residents that live in that particular area regarding the traffic coming out onto Riverside Ave from the new establishments in the Fells Plaza.

968
01:27:05,182 --> 01:27:09,504
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, we talked about possibly bringing in the state and having

969
01:27:11,492 --> 01:27:19,796
[SPEAKER_19]: You'll be able to cross over the Fellsway and go, what's that, north up the Fellsway, rather than come out onto Riverside Ave.

970
01:27:20,076 --> 01:27:25,838
[SPEAKER_19]: Because right now, if you come off of Fells Plaza, you have to take a right, and it brings you to Wellington Circle.

971
01:27:25,858 --> 01:27:26,719
[SPEAKER_19]: There's no way around it.

972
01:27:27,239 --> 01:27:31,661
[SPEAKER_19]: The only other way is coming out either through Commercial Street or Riverside Ave.

973
01:27:32,161 --> 01:27:37,444
[SPEAKER_19]: And both ways lead you to Riverside Ave, which is a real nightmare with traffic already.

974
01:27:38,125 --> 01:27:47,554
[SPEAKER_19]: At some point, Lorne, I think that these issues, and I know you've discussed pedestrian safety and bicycle and so forth, but these issues on Riverside Ave need to be discussed also.

975
01:27:48,235 --> 01:27:55,341
[SPEAKER_19]: And the two stipulations that I recall that will put us a stipulation on the license were never done.

976
01:27:55,902 --> 01:27:59,105
[SPEAKER_19]: And I offered a few resolutions, and I still can't get an answer.

977
01:27:59,367 --> 01:28:02,430
[SPEAKER_12]: So there should be conditions that were attached to the Board of Appeals.

978
01:28:02,450 --> 01:28:03,951
[SPEAKER_12]: We can take a look at that.

979
01:28:04,191 --> 01:28:10,197
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know there was still some finish work, because they were finishing up some of the site work at the very end of the season.

980
01:28:10,217 --> 01:28:11,478
[SPEAKER_12]: They were working with the city engineer.

981
01:28:11,498 --> 01:28:16,182
[SPEAKER_12]: I know the sidewalk that was replaced across the street was in bitumen.

982
01:28:16,202 --> 01:28:17,243
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that supposed to be concrete?

983
01:28:17,263 --> 01:28:18,524
[SPEAKER_12]: So I know that has to be completed.

984
01:28:19,184 --> 01:28:21,386
[SPEAKER_12]: And perhaps there was some striping also.

985
01:28:21,446 --> 01:28:22,367
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can check with the city engineer.

986
01:28:22,387 --> 01:28:26,191
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the council put a condition in regards to the drive-through.

987
01:28:27,076 --> 01:28:28,778
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's a conditional drive-thru, okay.

988
01:28:28,838 --> 01:28:31,080
[SPEAKER_19]: Not on the common vituals license, but on the drive-thru.

989
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:34,904
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we can check with the building department inspector and make sure that they have those conditions.

990
01:28:34,984 --> 01:28:40,109
[SPEAKER_19]: If you could, the striping at the exit of Fells Plaza, cars just queue up there.

991
01:28:40,149 --> 01:28:41,510
[SPEAKER_19]: No one can get out of Fells Plaza.

992
01:28:42,017 --> 01:28:47,020
[SPEAKER_19]: It's really, you take your life in your hands, because they're trying to get out of there in the worst way.

993
01:28:47,301 --> 01:28:49,342
[SPEAKER_19]: You're trying to get through the Felsway with a set of lights.

994
01:28:49,842 --> 01:28:53,545
[SPEAKER_19]: It really is a gridlock.

995
01:28:53,565 --> 01:28:54,786
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor.

996
01:28:55,006 --> 01:28:56,767
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a real gridlock issue in that area.

997
01:28:57,187 --> 01:29:01,991
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think at least the striping would help to notify people that they really shouldn't block that entrance.

998
01:29:03,051 --> 01:29:05,093
[SPEAKER_19]: And also the sidewalk across the street.

999
01:29:05,253 --> 01:29:09,095
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we don't own property over there, unfortunately.

1000
01:29:09,135 --> 01:29:11,357
[SPEAKER_12]: But if there was some way to increase connections and get

1001
01:29:11,852 --> 01:29:16,254
[SPEAKER_12]: some traffic to get out to commercial street, things would flow a lot better.

1002
01:29:16,274 --> 01:29:19,276
[SPEAKER_12]: And to get out to a signalized intersection, that would help a lot.

1003
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:24,979
[SPEAKER_19]: As part of that project, we did put a sign requesting people exit onto commercial.

1004
01:29:25,699 --> 01:29:30,522
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know how many people are using it, but I can tell you it doesn't appear that people are opting for that.

1005
01:29:31,641 --> 01:29:39,928
[SPEAKER_19]: But it definitely needs to, you know, the more we start redeveloping that particular area, the infrastructure really is not suitable.

1006
01:29:40,008 --> 01:29:40,428
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

1007
01:29:40,488 --> 01:29:43,671
[SPEAKER_12]: It was, you know, the Riverside industrial area was just that, an industrial area.

1008
01:29:43,691 --> 01:29:48,494
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that people really didn't give it much thought because it was a home for trucks and this and that.

1009
01:29:48,514 --> 01:29:52,698
[SPEAKER_12]: And now we have more people living in there and more people traveling and walking.

1010
01:29:54,959 --> 01:29:56,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1011
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:56,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarbelli.

1012
01:29:56,841 --> 01:29:58,022
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can, thank you.

1013
01:29:59,324 --> 01:30:08,590
[SPEAKER_06]: As, well, when we reach this topic, I just wanted to share some concerns that I think we should look at also.

1014
01:30:09,991 --> 01:30:19,177
[SPEAKER_06]: The possibility of Illuminae not being completely filled yet, now with 400 and somewhat units, what impact will it make on the school department numbers?

1015
01:30:19,658 --> 01:30:23,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that we're, you know, our biggest concern

1016
01:30:26,324 --> 01:30:27,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Has that been discussed we

1017
01:30:53,510 --> 01:30:58,214
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to do an economic study, and they are trying to contact Roy Bellson.

1018
01:30:58,234 --> 01:31:03,578
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if they did, but I can call them and make sure that they address specifically school population.

1019
01:31:03,618 --> 01:31:08,202
[SPEAKER_12]: The distribution of the units are predominantly single and twos and a few threes.

1020
01:31:08,782 --> 01:31:12,986
[SPEAKER_12]: But sometimes people stay someplace with it longer than they thought they were going to do.

1021
01:31:13,066 --> 01:31:18,512
[SPEAKER_12]: And all of a sudden the family's with them and they didn't necessarily, you know, maybe they thought they were going to own a house someplace and that doesn't happen.

1022
01:31:18,552 --> 01:31:22,556
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think it's a legitimate concern and they should be able to address that question.

1023
01:31:22,576 --> 01:31:22,656
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1024
01:31:22,896 --> 01:31:23,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1025
01:31:25,399 --> 01:31:26,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Scott.

1026
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:27,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scott Peveley.

1027
01:31:27,661 --> 01:31:29,823
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Longo-Kern.

1028
01:31:31,193 --> 01:31:49,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote, that we have a meeting with Lauren DiLorenzo, her department, the two developers of the metal gun projects, and all appropriate department heads, hopefully before the end of May.

1029
01:31:49,122 --> 01:31:50,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's budget season.

1030
01:31:50,563 --> 01:31:54,625
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, everyone's- You want to do the two meetings together, or you want to do them separately?

1031
01:31:55,103 --> 01:31:59,444
[SPEAKER_12]: If we can get the- I will caution that the other project is just beginning its permitting process.

1032
01:31:59,464 --> 01:32:00,924
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, well- Probably just the Middleton Mall.

1033
01:32:00,944 --> 01:32:01,064
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1034
01:32:01,145 --> 01:32:08,546
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe we just do the Middleton Mall first and then as the other one- Right, and you're all welcome again to participate in any of the community development board meeting is next.

1035
01:32:08,566 --> 01:32:09,467
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the 18th.

1036
01:32:09,887 --> 01:32:12,827
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the Board of Appeals, I believe, will probably be the last Tuesday of the month.

1037
01:32:13,047 --> 01:32:13,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1038
01:32:13,808 --> 01:32:14,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1039
01:32:14,328 --> 01:32:15,528
[SPEAKER_04]: A roll call vote has been requested.

1040
01:32:16,088 --> 01:32:17,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, if you'd call the roll.

1041
01:32:21,610 --> 01:32:22,530
[SPEAKER_07]: President DelaRosa.

1042
01:32:23,210 --> 01:32:23,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1043
01:32:24,501 --> 01:32:25,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falcone?

1044
01:32:25,501 --> 01:32:25,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1045
01:32:26,102 --> 01:32:26,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Layton?

1046
01:32:26,762 --> 01:32:27,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1047
01:32:27,342 --> 01:32:28,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Long-Term?

1048
01:32:28,783 --> 01:32:28,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1049
01:32:28,943 --> 01:32:30,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Moniz?

1050
01:32:30,504 --> 01:32:30,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1051
01:32:30,704 --> 01:32:32,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Spadafore?

1052
01:32:33,065 --> 01:32:33,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1053
01:32:34,326 --> 01:32:35,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Pavlio?

1054
01:32:37,767 --> 01:32:38,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1055
01:32:38,247 --> 01:32:39,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes 7-0.

1056
01:32:39,428 --> 01:32:54,135
[SPEAKER_05]: 16.456, offered by Vice President Long-Term, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council schedule a meeting with the Mayor to continue discussions that are of concern, such as status of the Memphis Public Library, the transparent succession plan

1057
01:32:54,660 --> 01:33:06,225
[SPEAKER_05]: about superintendent, parking enforcement, and the issue of parking on sidewalks, staffing changes at Memphis City Hall, and other topics that are of concern for the administration and the council.

1058
01:33:07,626 --> 01:33:08,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Longo, go ahead.

1059
01:33:09,927 --> 01:33:11,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Carviello.

1060
01:33:11,968 --> 01:33:13,548
[SPEAKER_11]: You put this resolution on.

1061
01:33:13,568 --> 01:33:23,773
[SPEAKER_11]: It was about six weeks ago now that we, maybe even almost two months now, that we sat down with the mayor of the community and discussed really just

1062
01:33:24,323 --> 01:33:27,064
[SPEAKER_11]: pinpoints of what you wanted to inform us of.

1063
01:33:27,624 --> 01:33:31,185
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we definitely are in need of a second meeting.

1064
01:33:31,805 --> 01:33:33,026
[SPEAKER_11]: We're in the beginning of May.

1065
01:33:33,206 --> 01:33:37,607
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a budget that should be coming out sooner rather than later.

1066
01:33:38,107 --> 01:33:43,789
[SPEAKER_11]: And a number of serious issues that are going on in our community that need discussion.

1067
01:33:43,809 --> 01:33:46,190
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to know what's going on.

1068
01:33:46,210 --> 01:33:50,471
[SPEAKER_11]: And I feel like we're not being apprised of some pertinent information.

1069
01:33:50,915 --> 01:33:59,119
[SPEAKER_11]: It's information that we're kind of just hearing rumors on, and people are asking us questions, and we really don't know how to answer it.

1070
01:33:59,159 --> 01:34:09,404
[SPEAKER_11]: It's almost like we're continuing this genre from what we left off on, from learning our information from the paper, and I think that's really unfortunate.

1071
01:34:09,864 --> 01:34:12,566
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the—these four issues are important to me.

1072
01:34:13,746 --> 01:34:15,807
[SPEAKER_11]: I know there's other issues that are of concern.

1073
01:34:17,763 --> 01:34:21,026
[SPEAKER_11]: It's extremely important that we sit down and meet with the mayor as soon as possible.

1074
01:34:21,466 --> 01:34:23,088
[SPEAKER_11]: The first is the Memphis Public Library.

1075
01:34:23,108 --> 01:34:31,275
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been a big advocate to redo the roof, obviously, and put some necessary upgrades within our library.

1076
01:34:31,295 --> 01:34:34,818
[SPEAKER_11]: The leaks are a serious problem.

1077
01:34:34,858 --> 01:34:42,945
[SPEAKER_11]: We've expended money on that and just would like an update with regards to where we're at and when everything's going to be complete and where we're going moving forward.

1078
01:34:43,862 --> 01:34:47,725
[SPEAKER_11]: with regards to the transparent succession plan of our superintendent.

1079
01:34:48,665 --> 01:34:53,088
[SPEAKER_11]: This is of grave concern to a number of parents, a number of residents.

1080
01:34:53,609 --> 01:35:10,360
[SPEAKER_11]: There are, I think, two petitions going around, one online and one hard copy, with regards to parents who have formed a group and are really, they're concerned about what's going on and they want transparency.

1081
01:35:10,999 --> 01:35:16,083
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that the contract was at issue last week with regards to the superintendent's contract.

1082
01:35:16,143 --> 01:35:31,176
[SPEAKER_11]: I did get a copy from the school committee's attorney, and the school committee, within the contract, it does state that the school committee shall advise the superintendent of its intent to extend his contract by June 30th, 2016.

1083
01:35:31,816 --> 01:35:35,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing has been brought to the table with regards to what their plans are.

1084
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:39,763
[SPEAKER_11]: If they have talked about it, it's in executive session, and we happen to know nothing.

1085
01:35:40,918 --> 01:35:47,743
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's of grave concern and something that obviously the mayor of the city could enlighten us on, because she does sit on that committee.

1086
01:35:49,004 --> 01:36:09,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Within the contract, it also mentions that the committee agrees to evaluate the superintendent using a five-step process, which includes self-assessment, dual analysis of goal setting and plan development, implementation of the plan, mid-cycle assessment, and a summative evaluation to a schedule

1087
01:36:10,028 --> 01:36:11,228
[SPEAKER_11]: agreed upon by the parties.

1088
01:36:11,269 --> 01:36:12,649
[SPEAKER_11]: That's supposed to be done every year.

1089
01:36:13,089 --> 01:36:19,131
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe somewhere within this contract, the evaluation portion is two pages long.

1090
01:36:19,652 --> 01:36:35,018
[SPEAKER_11]: But there should be a final evaluation report from not only the superintendent himself, but each individual school committee member was to create an evaluation of the superintendent.

1091
01:36:35,038 --> 01:36:37,959
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think there's some key issues that the parents are talking about.

1092
01:36:40,065 --> 01:36:45,166
[SPEAKER_11]: that school committee members are talking about, that residents are talking about.

1093
01:36:45,507 --> 01:36:47,347
[SPEAKER_11]: It really affects our budget.

1094
01:36:47,367 --> 01:36:49,348
[SPEAKER_11]: It affects the city as a whole.

1095
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:51,148
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the reason why I voted.

1096
01:36:52,088 --> 01:37:01,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Part of the issues are the reason why I voted against the budget in June 2015, because I believe that the school department is somewhat top heavy.

1097
01:37:01,651 --> 01:37:05,272
[SPEAKER_11]: You have the kindergarten aides who are only allowed to work three hours per day.

1098
01:37:05,292 --> 01:37:06,952
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it's three hours per day.

1099
01:37:06,972 --> 01:37:08,913
[SPEAKER_11]: I could be quoted maybe a little bit more than that.

1100
01:37:09,317 --> 01:37:24,363
[SPEAKER_11]: and are getting minuscule raises, where you have the upper-level department heads, some of which are making, over the three years, once I broke it down in spreadsheet form, 15% raises in three years.

1101
01:37:24,643 --> 01:37:29,025
[SPEAKER_11]: You're talking tens of thousands of dollars per person each year.

1102
01:37:29,465 --> 01:37:31,846
[SPEAKER_11]: This has nothing to do with the person that's listed.

1103
01:37:31,866 --> 01:37:33,326
[SPEAKER_11]: It has to do with our budget.

1104
01:37:33,746 --> 01:37:36,447
[SPEAKER_11]: It has to do with the PR job that was put in

1105
01:37:38,980 --> 01:37:44,002
[SPEAKER_11]: about four months ago, and the fact that that's a $90,000 job.

1106
01:37:45,443 --> 01:37:54,387
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I got calls from teachers with regards to books, and books needed to be replaced, and lack of stipends, and a whole host of issues.

1107
01:37:55,208 --> 01:37:58,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Maintenance of our schools was pointed out to me.

1108
01:37:58,289 --> 01:38:03,652
[SPEAKER_11]: A five and 10 year building and grounds maintenance upgrade plan.

1109
01:38:06,413 --> 01:38:08,574
[SPEAKER_11]: Issues with the facilities and community schools.

1110
01:38:09,365 --> 01:38:11,987
[SPEAKER_11]: Our schools are a level three district.

1111
01:38:12,588 --> 01:38:14,850
[SPEAKER_11]: We have decreased MCAS scores.

1112
01:38:15,710 --> 01:38:16,571
[SPEAKER_11]: This is of concern.

1113
01:38:16,591 --> 01:38:18,713
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I am passionate about it.

1114
01:38:19,373 --> 01:38:20,434
[SPEAKER_11]: I have kids in the school.

1115
01:38:20,454 --> 01:38:22,236
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a lot of friends with children in the school.

1116
01:38:22,876 --> 01:38:26,619
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's something that the city council needs to take hold of.

1117
01:38:26,659 --> 01:38:27,940
[SPEAKER_11]: And we need to get involved.

1118
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,541
[SPEAKER_11]: Number one, it's involved with our budget.

1119
01:38:31,167 --> 01:38:33,168
[SPEAKER_11]: I have people calling me.

1120
01:38:33,588 --> 01:38:36,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Lately, I feel like I'm on the school committee and the city council.

1121
01:38:37,549 --> 01:38:42,010
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't even get anything done at my office some days because my phone is ringing off the hook.

1122
01:38:42,410 --> 01:38:47,671
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm putting in 40 hours a week sometimes between the phone calls and the emails and meetings.

1123
01:38:50,432 --> 01:38:54,533
[SPEAKER_11]: Something needs to change, and people need to understand what is going on.

1124
01:38:56,673 --> 01:38:59,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Security issues, lack of communication with parents,

1125
01:38:59,733 --> 01:39:07,099
[SPEAKER_11]: what happened with the bomb threat and the McGlynn theft, people weren't notified, parents weren't notified for hours if not days after the fact.

1126
01:39:07,359 --> 01:39:10,422
[SPEAKER_11]: These are all things that should be evaluated by the school committee.

1127
01:39:11,022 --> 01:39:18,949
[SPEAKER_11]: I watched the school committee meeting last night and just the reactiveness of our superintendent, it's unfortunate.

1128
01:39:20,330 --> 01:39:23,573
[SPEAKER_11]: Good questions were asked and people were laughed at.

1129
01:39:24,233 --> 01:39:26,675
[SPEAKER_11]: I know a resident went up and questioned the

1130
01:39:27,783 --> 01:39:29,044
[SPEAKER_11]: contract of the superintendent.

1131
01:39:29,064 --> 01:39:29,965
[SPEAKER_11]: And she was laughed at.

1132
01:39:30,806 --> 01:39:31,326
[SPEAKER_11]: That's wrong.

1133
01:39:32,447 --> 01:39:36,430
[SPEAKER_11]: And we need to take this under our wing and help.

1134
01:39:36,991 --> 01:39:38,532
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I've been asked for help.

1135
01:39:38,932 --> 01:39:40,113
[SPEAKER_11]: People are asking me for help.

1136
01:39:40,594 --> 01:39:41,935
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not afraid to speak out.

1137
01:39:41,955 --> 01:39:44,176
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been retaliated against within the last four months.

1138
01:39:44,237 --> 01:39:45,578
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know it's going to keep happening.

1139
01:39:45,978 --> 01:39:46,899
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's my job.

1140
01:39:46,919 --> 01:39:47,960
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I'm getting paid for.

1141
01:39:47,980 --> 01:39:50,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we laughing over there?

1142
01:39:52,944 --> 01:39:53,344
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

1143
01:39:53,364 --> 01:39:55,626
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought a counselor was laughing at me.

1144
01:39:56,425 --> 01:39:57,666
[SPEAKER_11]: This is no joke.

1145
01:39:57,986 --> 01:39:59,247
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not a joke.

1146
01:39:59,447 --> 01:40:00,507
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a laughing matter.

1147
01:40:01,188 --> 01:40:07,031
[SPEAKER_11]: This is hundreds of thousands of dollars that should be reallocated within our school system, if not evaluated completely.

1148
01:40:07,651 --> 01:40:10,473
[SPEAKER_11]: And one person is responsible for this.

1149
01:40:11,113 --> 01:40:16,076
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw the superintendent shushing people last night, and it was really, really pathetic.

1150
01:40:17,077 --> 01:40:19,999
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's my spiel on the schools.

1151
01:40:20,039 --> 01:40:20,879
[SPEAKER_11]: And I could go on.

1152
01:40:20,899 --> 01:40:22,100
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I can go on and tell you

1153
01:40:23,325 --> 01:40:38,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Many many more things because I've got lists from probably six different people of everything that needs to be evaluated That's within the school school department that the third serious issue is the parking enforcement, you know, we have a public parking who sold a

1154
01:40:39,433 --> 01:40:41,494
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to know what's going on.

1155
01:40:41,994 --> 01:40:43,274
[SPEAKER_11]: We haven't been told anything.

1156
01:40:43,654 --> 01:40:47,675
[SPEAKER_11]: The administration is trying—you know, at first, we were so—we've been so quiet.

1157
01:40:47,715 --> 01:40:49,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody's like, your meetings are getting out so early, so early.

1158
01:40:50,196 --> 01:40:50,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know what?

1159
01:40:50,996 --> 01:40:53,997
[SPEAKER_11]: I want—for me personally, I want to give people a chance.

1160
01:40:54,077 --> 01:40:59,018
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to—you know, I didn't want to be how I was the last 14 years or at least the last 10.

1161
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:03,881
[SPEAKER_11]: The transparency is, it's like, oh, I'm trying to be transparent.

1162
01:41:03,921 --> 01:41:05,222
[SPEAKER_11]: But no, no, you're not.

1163
01:41:05,242 --> 01:41:07,242
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not transparent at all.

1164
01:41:07,262 --> 01:41:09,923
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we get minimal questions answered.

1165
01:41:10,383 --> 01:41:11,504
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not right.

1166
01:41:12,124 --> 01:41:16,425
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, if they have the four votes for the budget, then no, we're not going to get any documentation.

1167
01:41:16,725 --> 01:41:22,787
[SPEAKER_11]: But last year, we had four people who kind of stuck together and said, we want information.

1168
01:41:23,027 --> 01:41:25,008
[SPEAKER_11]: We want A, B, C, D. And we got it.

1169
01:41:25,748 --> 01:41:26,889
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the budget was approved.

1170
01:41:26,929 --> 01:41:27,490
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine.

1171
01:41:27,630 --> 01:41:30,953
[SPEAKER_11]: I chose not to vote for it, and that was my prerogative.

1172
01:41:31,173 --> 01:41:37,438
[SPEAKER_11]: But at least we had the group effort to get information that we needed.

1173
01:41:38,119 --> 01:41:39,220
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hope that happens again.

1174
01:41:39,340 --> 01:41:39,840
[SPEAKER_11]: I really do.

1175
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:42,983
[SPEAKER_11]: I ask my colleagues to stand strong and get in some information.

1176
01:41:43,023 --> 01:41:47,547
[SPEAKER_11]: And obviously, within the next few weeks, we're going to be asking for a lot of information from a lot of people.

1177
01:41:48,844 --> 01:42:02,372
[SPEAKER_11]: So parking enforcement, there's people who are complaining day after day about parking on sidewalks, about commercial vehicles on streets that aren't being tagged, about how certain streets aren't tagged for certain reasons, and spot enforcement.

1178
01:42:03,772 --> 01:42:07,014
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's definitely something that we need to talk to our administration about.

1179
01:42:07,875 --> 01:42:10,936
[SPEAKER_11]: The last thing is with regards to the staffing changes at City Hall.

1180
01:42:12,397 --> 01:42:13,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Changes are fine.

1181
01:42:13,698 --> 01:42:17,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Changes were expected to happen, but when you have

1182
01:42:18,231 --> 01:42:25,894
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to ask the city council to change ordinances so that you can hire certain people, and then they're leaving fired, whatever the case may be.

1183
01:42:26,314 --> 01:42:27,695
[SPEAKER_11]: And we don't know what's going on.

1184
01:42:28,075 --> 01:42:28,655
[SPEAKER_11]: That's wrong.

1185
01:42:29,715 --> 01:42:31,696
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm learning from the paper what is happening.

1186
01:42:31,956 --> 01:42:38,999
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm learning from school committee members that somebody in the schools is now going to be signing our city-side RFPs, whether or not that's true.

1187
01:42:40,712 --> 01:42:43,515
[SPEAKER_11]: And it may be fine, all well and good, but shouldn't we know that?

1188
01:42:43,535 --> 01:42:44,956
[SPEAKER_11]: Shouldn't the administration tell us that?

1189
01:42:45,276 --> 01:42:46,758
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's going to take over for Karen Rose?

1190
01:42:46,778 --> 01:42:48,399
[SPEAKER_11]: That's an important, important job.

1191
01:42:48,759 --> 01:42:50,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's going to take over for Louise Miller?

1192
01:42:52,603 --> 01:42:58,488
[SPEAKER_11]: We should be updated, and I think we all should be demanding answers.

1193
01:42:59,479 --> 01:43:03,843
[SPEAKER_11]: We shouldn't have to hear from the editor of the paper or reading the paper.

1194
01:43:06,525 --> 01:43:09,687
[SPEAKER_11]: These are four serious issues that need to be discussed.

1195
01:43:10,067 --> 01:43:19,995
[SPEAKER_11]: They need to be discussed on concerns that we have, not just a list of things that want to be told to us so that we can vote, so that she can have the votes for what she needs.

1196
01:43:21,937 --> 01:43:22,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Change has to start here.

1197
01:43:22,998 --> 01:43:24,339
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it really does.

1198
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:28,542
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hope my colleagues can move approval on this.

1199
01:43:29,263 --> 01:43:32,865
[SPEAKER_11]: so that we can get some of these answers and really start the discussion before the budget.

1200
01:43:34,205 --> 01:43:35,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

1201
01:43:35,126 --> 01:43:36,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, the paper is more plugged in than we are.

1202
01:43:38,527 --> 01:43:39,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor, President Del Rosso.

1203
01:43:40,168 --> 01:43:41,429
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Mr. Chairman.

1204
01:43:42,129 --> 01:43:48,552
[SPEAKER_08]: I have been in conversation with the mayor to plan our next quarterly meeting.

1205
01:43:49,193 --> 01:43:56,216
[SPEAKER_08]: We're working on scheduling issues, and I'm delighted to have

1206
01:43:56,680 --> 01:44:06,231
[SPEAKER_08]: these additional matters presented to us tonight on the floor so that we might ask them to be included in the agenda for the discussion.

1207
01:44:06,752 --> 01:44:07,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1208
01:44:09,916 --> 01:44:10,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Counselor Knight.

1209
01:44:11,638 --> 01:44:12,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1210
01:44:12,939 --> 01:44:14,521
[SPEAKER_09]: If I think back and remember correctly,

1211
01:44:15,043 --> 01:44:20,488
[SPEAKER_09]: When we met before at the Committee of the Whole meeting with the administration, we adjourned.

1212
01:44:20,508 --> 01:44:22,970
[SPEAKER_09]: And when we adjourned, we said that we would reconvene again in 90 days.

1213
01:44:23,650 --> 01:44:31,077
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that Consulate de la Ruzo has told us that he is working on setting up a date for that matter.

1214
01:44:31,177 --> 01:44:37,862
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I think we're looking to schedule a second meeting.

1215
01:44:37,962 --> 01:44:41,065
[SPEAKER_09]: We adjourned our last meeting with the intentions of having a second meeting.

1216
01:44:42,772 --> 01:44:47,735
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, a motion to receive and place on file, or a motion to send these questions to the mayor.

1217
01:44:47,995 --> 01:44:51,036
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't know what you want to do with the issue of having the meeting and scheduling the meeting.

1218
01:44:51,056 --> 01:44:53,917
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's already been decided and discussed and voted on by this council.

1219
01:44:54,738 --> 01:44:55,818
[SPEAKER_09]: We'd like to get these questions answered.

1220
01:44:55,838 --> 01:44:59,219
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have a problem with that, and I don't think it's a bad idea at all.

1221
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:01,520
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess my question is, how do we proceed at this point?

1222
01:45:02,581 --> 01:45:02,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1223
01:45:03,882 --> 01:45:04,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Falco.

1224
01:45:05,182 --> 01:45:06,002
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1225
01:45:06,283 --> 01:45:10,544
[SPEAKER_17]: If I could add two things to the meeting agenda when we do meet with the mayor.

1226
01:45:10,985 --> 01:45:11,765
[SPEAKER_17]: Budget format.

1227
01:45:12,653 --> 01:45:13,713
[SPEAKER_17]: I mentioned it a while ago.

1228
01:45:13,733 --> 01:45:14,754
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's important.

1229
01:45:14,834 --> 01:45:15,554
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to see it.

1230
01:45:15,794 --> 01:45:22,335
[SPEAKER_17]: It's one of the most important responsibilities that we have, passing the budget.

1231
01:45:22,975 --> 01:45:30,677
[SPEAKER_17]: And we should know what it's going to look like, the format at least, before we get to those meetings, before we get the budget book, so we know what we're dealing with.

1232
01:45:30,757 --> 01:45:31,777
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's important.

1233
01:45:31,797 --> 01:45:32,657
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to see that addressed.

1234
01:45:32,677 --> 01:45:34,498
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'd also like to see budget calendar.

1235
01:45:35,498 --> 01:45:37,498
[SPEAKER_17]: When are we expected to get the budget?

1236
01:45:37,538 --> 01:45:39,139
[SPEAKER_17]: When are we going to meet with department heads?

1237
01:45:39,199 --> 01:45:39,959
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's important.

1238
01:45:40,397 --> 01:45:41,357
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'd like to see that as well.

1239
01:45:41,397 --> 01:45:44,078
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we could discuss that at the meeting, I'd greatly appreciate it.

1240
01:45:44,298 --> 01:45:44,658
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1241
01:45:45,078 --> 01:45:45,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1242
01:45:45,379 --> 01:45:46,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor.

1243
01:45:46,059 --> 01:45:46,679
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Marks.

1244
01:45:48,079 --> 01:45:49,040
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1245
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:51,620
[SPEAKER_19]: And I want to thank council longer current for bringing this up.

1246
01:45:51,680 --> 01:46:09,866
[SPEAKER_19]: And, um, I, I too agree that, uh, in addition to what was mentioned by council along the one important topics, uh, the capital improvement plan, uh, that we've discussed for the last several years, uh, should be a topic of discussion, um, uh, regarding our municipal buildings and, you know,

1247
01:46:10,552 --> 01:46:20,294
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, there's been a lot of discussion about having meetings with the mayor and you know, the discussions are now centered around what we'll meet quarterly with the mayor.

1248
01:46:21,134 --> 01:46:35,056
[SPEAKER_19]: And, uh, I, I would say what, what happens between the quarterly meetings, what happens in the 90 or 85 days between the quarterly meetings is equally as important as the four meetings a year.

1249
01:46:35,936 --> 01:46:39,377
[SPEAKER_19]: And I agree with council Lungo that we should be kept abreast.

1250
01:46:40,015 --> 01:46:42,236
[SPEAKER_19]: of everything that's going on in this community.

1251
01:46:43,037 --> 01:46:52,182
[SPEAKER_19]: Not to micromanage the community, but be able to answer when constituents call us and email us and meet us in the street and ask questions.

1252
01:46:52,663 --> 01:46:56,465
[SPEAKER_19]: We should be able to give residents an answer, Mr. President.

1253
01:46:56,845 --> 01:46:58,146
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what we're elected to do.

1254
01:46:58,486 --> 01:46:59,687
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what we get paid to do.

1255
01:47:00,547 --> 01:47:04,570
[SPEAKER_19]: What better than to have seven people out here that are advocates for the community?

1256
01:47:05,210 --> 01:47:08,352
[SPEAKER_19]: And right now, the administration is not using us as advocates.

1257
01:47:09,183 --> 01:47:20,816
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, you know, and it's unfortunate and there's been a lot of rhetoric and lip service about, uh, you know, coming to meetings and so forth and assigning liaisons and the council liaison.

1258
01:47:21,217 --> 01:47:23,039
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me see if the council liaison is present.

1259
01:47:23,379 --> 01:47:27,704
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there a council liaison that works in the mayor's office here tonight?

1260
01:47:27,724 --> 01:47:28,405
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you raise your hand?

1261
01:47:30,593 --> 01:47:32,154
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I don't see anyone here.

1262
01:47:33,094 --> 01:47:38,916
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't recall seeing anyone here since the beginning of the year, Mr. President.

1263
01:47:38,936 --> 01:47:45,999
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't recall seeing anyone here since the beginning of the year, the council liaison.

1264
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,120
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think these are the issues.

1265
01:47:48,220 --> 01:47:49,861
[SPEAKER_19]: If you ran a private corporation,

1266
01:47:50,961 --> 01:48:02,310
[SPEAKER_19]: saying that, I'm only going to meet with the board of directors four times a year, or I'm only going to discuss what's going on with the employees that run the company or the employees that answer the questions and deal with the public.

1267
01:48:02,550 --> 01:48:04,652
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm only going to talk to them four times a year.

1268
01:48:04,972 --> 01:48:06,553
[SPEAKER_19]: You wouldn't have a successful business.

1269
01:48:06,934 --> 01:48:10,476
[SPEAKER_19]: And that follows suit in the city, you know, Mr. President.

1270
01:48:10,516 --> 01:48:13,199
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, I don't know about these quarterly meetings.

1271
01:48:13,699 --> 01:48:14,319
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, it's okay.

1272
01:48:14,339 --> 01:48:15,961
[SPEAKER_19]: It's great to meet with the mayor quarterly.

1273
01:48:16,521 --> 01:48:20,264
[SPEAKER_19]: What about having discussions with the mayor on a daily basis, Mr. President?

1274
01:48:20,749 --> 01:48:21,710
[SPEAKER_19]: or a weekly basis.

1275
01:48:22,550 --> 01:48:24,712
[SPEAKER_09]: And... One information, Councilor Knight.

1276
01:48:25,572 --> 01:48:27,133
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm only speaking for myself.

1277
01:48:27,193 --> 01:48:30,635
[SPEAKER_09]: If I pick up the phone and I call the Mayor's office, I can get the Mayor on the phone whenever I have a question.

1278
01:48:30,836 --> 01:48:32,937
[SPEAKER_09]: I can get a department on the phone whenever I can have a question.

1279
01:48:32,977 --> 01:48:36,099
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that that recourse is available to us.

1280
01:48:36,819 --> 01:48:40,862
[SPEAKER_09]: I personally think it's nice that we have something in the calendar that says that we're gonna meet with the administration quarterly.

1281
01:48:41,148 --> 01:48:45,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing's precluding us from meeting with them more frequently than that or doing what we do as individual counselors.

1282
01:48:45,889 --> 01:48:50,791
[SPEAKER_09]: But in terms of having quarterly meetings as a body of the whole, I don't see any harm or foul in that, Mr. President.

1283
01:48:52,051 --> 01:48:52,511
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1284
01:48:52,571 --> 01:49:02,514
[SPEAKER_19]: So as I was stating, Mr. President, it's incumbent upon the chief executive officer of the community to be a good communicator, to be open and transparent.

1285
01:49:03,034 --> 01:49:06,915
[SPEAKER_19]: And it shouldn't be incumbent upon residents, members of the council,

1286
01:49:07,505 --> 01:49:23,816
[SPEAKER_19]: whoever it might be in the community to say, oh, I got to keep on calling the administration to find out what's going on here, or I got to keep on calling to, you know, we may not have to call the administration as many times if the administration was willing and open to present this information to us in the first place.

1287
01:49:24,276 --> 01:49:30,601
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's definitely a breakdown of communication already, and, you know, I hope it doesn't continue this way.

1288
01:49:30,901 --> 01:49:37,165
[SPEAKER_19]: I know it's a new administration, and I know there's a lot out there happening, but definitely the transparency

1289
01:49:37,922 --> 01:49:55,481
[SPEAKER_19]: Communication and just lack of response to this council is evident so far, and I hope it improves, Mr. President, not on behalf of me or on behalf of the mayor, but on behalf of the taxpayers who are paying the bills in this community and expect government to communicate with each other.

1290
01:49:56,422 --> 01:49:57,823
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, anyone can pick up the phone.

1291
01:49:57,863 --> 01:49:59,345
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight's correct.

1292
01:49:59,630 --> 01:50:02,052
[SPEAKER_19]: I could pick up the phone 12 times and call the mayor.

1293
01:50:02,392 --> 01:50:09,698
[SPEAKER_19]: But I don't think government should operate that way, nor do I think the mayor should receive 60 phone calls from this council a week either, Mr. President.

1294
01:50:09,978 --> 01:50:27,852
[SPEAKER_19]: And if communication was flowing the way it should flow, there wouldn't be a need to pick up the phone every minute and find out what's going on with appointments, what's going on with programs in the city, why aren't the crosswalks being painted, what's going on with the Field of Dreams behind the high school, what's going on with a number of issues and, you know,

1295
01:50:28,993 --> 01:50:31,174
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, we have the positions now established.

1296
01:50:31,694 --> 01:50:33,255
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a liaison to the council.

1297
01:50:34,116 --> 01:50:35,696
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see that in motion.

1298
01:50:36,637 --> 01:50:37,577
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see that work.

1299
01:50:38,218 --> 01:50:39,598
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, we have a business liaison.

1300
01:50:40,038 --> 01:50:40,999
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see that work.

1301
01:50:41,319 --> 01:50:47,822
[SPEAKER_19]: Has this business liaison been out to the different business districts in the community asking what the needs are?

1302
01:50:48,563 --> 01:50:48,903
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

1303
01:50:48,943 --> 01:50:51,364
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe that happens on month eight of the year.

1304
01:50:51,384 --> 01:50:53,325
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that position is currently being reviewed.

1305
01:50:53,847 --> 01:50:56,528
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, it currently may be being reviewed.

1306
01:50:56,568 --> 01:51:00,210
[SPEAKER_19]: But what I'm saying is if the positions are there, they should be working.

1307
01:51:00,730 --> 01:51:06,113
[SPEAKER_19]: And if something's not working, it's not a terrible thing to raise an issue or raise a red flag.

1308
01:51:06,513 --> 01:51:07,174
[SPEAKER_19]: It really isn't.

1309
01:51:07,794 --> 01:51:10,235
[SPEAKER_19]: So I thank you, Councilor Longo, for bringing this up.

1310
01:51:11,276 --> 01:51:11,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1311
01:51:11,836 --> 01:51:13,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Councilor Longo, please.

1312
01:51:13,657 --> 01:51:15,898
[SPEAKER_11]: Just thank you, President Caravaglio.

1313
01:51:16,198 --> 01:51:21,781
[SPEAKER_11]: Just on that point, the liaison, I feel at this point, has never come to a meeting.

1314
01:51:21,821 --> 01:51:23,362
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like it is a joke.

1315
01:51:24,055 --> 01:51:25,496
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have department heads.

1316
01:51:25,976 --> 01:51:28,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Some departments are open.

1317
01:51:28,177 --> 01:51:35,400
[SPEAKER_11]: And supposedly, they were told they can't meet with the city council without approval, just like they can't talk to the paper without approval.

1318
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:38,582
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there are people speaking out.

1319
01:51:38,782 --> 01:51:39,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Things are not going well.

1320
01:51:40,503 --> 01:51:45,925
[SPEAKER_11]: So we need to get a meeting going and find out what is going on.

1321
01:51:47,666 --> 01:51:48,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1322
01:51:49,226 --> 01:51:50,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record, please.

1323
01:51:50,807 --> 01:51:51,447
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1324
01:51:51,468 --> 01:51:52,548
[SPEAKER_13]: Jean Martington, Cumming Street.

1325
01:51:53,207 --> 01:51:58,970
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, there's an overall question about communication and the role of the mayor with the council.

1326
01:51:59,351 --> 01:52:20,323
[SPEAKER_13]: And then there's a subtopic that I'd like to discuss, but, um, the overall is it needs to improve because it kind of feels like the old is, is leaking into the new, the old administration habits are leaking into the new and maybe just having email alerts to all of you from the mayor's office when an important position has been filled.

1327
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:30,926
[SPEAKER_13]: whether it be the liaison, whether it be whatever, whether it be a firing, a hiring or whatever, just you don't have to say, I fired so and so today or whatever, just put, you know, so and so has left.

1328
01:52:31,646 --> 01:52:44,854
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, you know, just so that you guys know what's going on, because there are some people who feel very comfortable calling the mayor every time, you know, and there are people that don't feel that they should be calling the mayor every 15 minutes.

1329
01:52:45,374 --> 01:52:49,036
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, um, there are ways to improve that communication.

1330
01:52:49,096 --> 01:52:50,037
[SPEAKER_13]: And I, I want to,

1331
01:52:50,482 --> 01:52:52,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Encourage that because she has a lot on her plate.

1332
01:52:53,363 --> 01:53:16,374
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a big big job to take over for the last administration So I want to encourage communication and I want to be put a positive spin on that Someone said this week that when they hear me speak that I'm always respectful and I hope to constantly be Respectful when I'm up here because then people have a harder time, you know Kind of denying what you have to say.

1333
01:53:16,694 --> 01:53:18,855
[SPEAKER_13]: So the more respectful we are when we're up here

1334
01:53:19,518 --> 01:53:26,603
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, a regular person told me that this week, that we, whether she agrees with me or not, I'm always respectful.

1335
01:53:26,643 --> 01:53:28,204
[SPEAKER_13]: And so she has to consider what I have to say.

1336
01:53:28,744 --> 01:53:30,646
[SPEAKER_13]: So, um, and I hope to hold that.

1337
01:53:30,926 --> 01:53:31,907
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope to always hold that.

1338
01:53:32,587 --> 01:53:45,636
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, secondly, one of the things that you specifically mentioned, which I was at the school committee meeting last night and the superintendent was testy with, uh, miss D D Benedetto in an inappropriate way.

1339
01:53:45,676 --> 01:53:48,358
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause she was asking valid questions and he got testy.

1340
01:53:49,295 --> 01:53:51,637
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, he's from the old administration.

1341
01:53:51,677 --> 01:53:52,859
[SPEAKER_13]: He's been around forever.

1342
01:53:53,259 --> 01:53:56,502
[SPEAKER_13]: My sister graduated in 1975 and he was a history teacher.

1343
01:53:56,562 --> 01:53:59,025
[SPEAKER_13]: He was a teacher back then for her.

1344
01:53:59,365 --> 01:54:02,608
[SPEAKER_13]: So I mean, it's just, it's not that he's a bad guy.

1345
01:54:03,029 --> 01:54:08,734
[SPEAKER_13]: It's that he's been around forever and he's part of the old legacy of the past administration.

1346
01:54:09,035 --> 01:54:13,459
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, can you imagine he's been around since the new school was built, which is an old school.

1347
01:54:14,970 --> 01:54:15,951
[SPEAKER_13]: He's just been around too long.

1348
01:54:16,011 --> 01:54:20,853
[SPEAKER_13]: And fresh eyes on the school system is something that should be considered.

1349
01:54:21,334 --> 01:54:23,955
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not saying he should be fired or replaced or whatever.

1350
01:54:24,395 --> 01:54:24,935
[SPEAKER_13]: But that we should.

1351
01:54:25,135 --> 01:54:26,316
[SPEAKER_09]: One information, Councilor Knight.

1352
01:54:26,696 --> 01:54:28,077
[SPEAKER_09]: The gentleman's under contract.

1353
01:54:28,097 --> 01:54:31,258
[SPEAKER_09]: And when the contract expires, they'll either renegotiate a contract or not.

1354
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:32,279
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

1355
01:54:32,299 --> 01:54:34,900
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, to say the gentleman's got to go, I think that that's problematic.

1356
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:35,981
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't say he has to go.

1357
01:54:36,041 --> 01:54:36,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me, sir.

1358
01:54:36,821 --> 01:54:37,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I correct?

1359
01:54:37,281 --> 01:54:38,362
[SPEAKER_09]: He is under contract.

1360
01:54:39,142 --> 01:54:39,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1361
01:54:40,223 --> 01:54:41,483
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight, excuse me.

1362
01:54:41,503 --> 01:54:42,484
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't say he has to go.

1363
01:54:43,018 --> 01:54:55,241
[SPEAKER_13]: I said there is absolutely nothing wrong with looking at other members that could, other people that could come in to this city to re-look at it and give a fresh set of eyes to our school system.

1364
01:54:56,122 --> 01:54:58,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we do have a new population in Medford.

1365
01:54:58,022 --> 01:54:59,223
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have the old population.

1366
01:54:59,883 --> 01:55:04,324
[SPEAKER_13]: And he is part of, he has a lot of bad habits from the May and McGlynn years.

1367
01:55:04,944 --> 01:55:08,225
[SPEAKER_13]: Nobody that worked under May and McGlynn for that long doesn't have, but.

1368
01:55:11,906 --> 01:55:19,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Chairman, I'm just concerned that people are being spoken of in a way that's not appropriate for public discussion.

1369
01:55:19,909 --> 01:55:24,471
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not here present with us to offer defense on their character.

1370
01:55:24,832 --> 01:55:25,652
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a fair question.

1371
01:55:25,752 --> 01:55:26,452
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a fair statement.

1372
01:55:26,472 --> 01:55:27,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1373
01:55:27,653 --> 01:55:34,656
[SPEAKER_13]: Fair statement that I shouldn't be, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with having a brand new look.

1374
01:55:34,856 --> 01:55:36,697
[SPEAKER_05]: I think those issues are up to the school community to make.

1375
01:55:37,077 --> 01:55:37,797
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that now?

1376
01:55:37,917 --> 01:55:40,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are issues for our school community to make those decisions.

1377
01:55:40,691 --> 01:55:44,072
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but if she's getting phone calls all day long, this is the last line.

1378
01:55:44,112 --> 01:55:45,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we all get phone calls.

1379
01:55:45,392 --> 01:55:45,712
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry?

1380
01:55:45,972 --> 01:55:47,652
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we all get phone calls and emails.

1381
01:55:48,212 --> 01:55:48,472
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1382
01:55:48,792 --> 01:55:51,073
[SPEAKER_13]: My point to that is this is the last line of defense.

1383
01:55:51,113 --> 01:55:53,673
[SPEAKER_13]: This council meeting is the last line of defense.

1384
01:55:53,693 --> 01:55:58,434
[SPEAKER_13]: When people don't feel like they're getting their answers from the school committee or any other place, this is the place to come.

1385
01:55:58,854 --> 01:55:59,774
[SPEAKER_13]: So, and I'm not a parent.

1386
01:56:00,514 --> 01:56:00,634
[SPEAKER_13]: Huh?

1387
01:56:01,134 --> 01:56:02,595
[SPEAKER_05]: One information, councilor Longo.

1388
01:56:02,695 --> 01:56:09,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Rick, I appreciate that too, but I'm getting calls from other elected officials, teachers, parents,

1389
01:56:11,150 --> 01:56:13,092
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm getting calls from the school committee for help.

1390
01:56:15,374 --> 01:56:18,036
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's why Councilor Logan-Curran has asked for the meeting.

1391
01:56:18,056 --> 01:56:21,439
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully we will get to a vote on these things.

1392
01:56:21,499 --> 01:56:21,939
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

1393
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:23,841
[SPEAKER_13]: And thank you very much for listening to me.

1394
01:56:24,061 --> 01:56:24,381
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1395
01:56:26,663 --> 01:56:27,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address for the record, please.

1396
01:56:28,585 --> 01:56:30,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Nick Tomazook, 29 Garfield Ave.

1397
01:56:30,947 --> 01:56:36,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Curran right there about the parking on sidewalks.

1398
01:56:38,833 --> 01:56:44,116
[SPEAKER_03]: parking spots in front of these people's houses and they got to stick the car to block the sidewalk.

1399
01:56:46,157 --> 01:56:48,018
[SPEAKER_03]: I sat on my stoop the other night.

1400
01:56:48,858 --> 01:56:56,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I counted five commercial vehicles on my street, a detached commercial trailer.

1401
01:56:57,822 --> 01:57:00,603
[SPEAKER_03]: The sidewalk was blocked two houses down from my house.

1402
01:57:01,224 --> 01:57:03,905
[SPEAKER_03]: A cop drives down the street and just keeps right on going.

1403
01:57:06,157 --> 01:57:11,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Who do you have to call in order to get laws enforced in the city?

1404
01:57:11,519 --> 01:57:11,999
[SPEAKER_03]: You are correct.

1405
01:57:12,019 --> 01:57:14,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Commercial vehicles should be off the streets by midnight.

1406
01:57:14,540 --> 01:57:15,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1407
01:57:15,521 --> 01:57:15,961
[SPEAKER_05]: You are correct.

1408
01:57:15,981 --> 01:57:19,242
[SPEAKER_03]: This thing sits there for, this is the third summer he's back.

1409
01:57:19,462 --> 01:57:22,863
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing moves five times a year when he goes racing his motorcycles.

1410
01:57:24,164 --> 01:57:25,264
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only time it moves.

1411
01:57:26,265 --> 01:57:28,325
[SPEAKER_03]: My god, this car broke down in front of our house.

1412
01:57:29,066 --> 01:57:30,106
[SPEAKER_03]: It was there for two days.

1413
01:57:30,126 --> 01:57:34,528
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't only tag it, but they went down there with a tow truck to tow it.

1414
01:57:37,942 --> 01:57:43,745
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you try to cross at a light on the crosswalk, these idiots don't know where the stop line is.

1415
01:57:46,206 --> 01:57:50,808
[SPEAKER_03]: And how many times I almost got killed at this rotary over here because they don't know what a yield sign means.

1416
01:57:52,549 --> 01:57:53,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Put a cop there.

1417
01:57:55,250 --> 01:57:58,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn it, you know, stop punishing these people that are breaking the laws in this city.

1418
01:57:58,952 --> 01:58:03,554
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not, you know, some off the wall, you know, city.

1419
01:58:05,255 --> 01:58:07,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody has to take the bull by the horns.

1420
01:58:08,249 --> 01:58:11,870
[SPEAKER_03]: and get the people that are supposed to be doing these jobs to do their jobs.

1421
01:58:12,751 --> 01:58:14,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Like at the school, the Robert school.

1422
01:58:15,071 --> 01:58:17,112
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how much bullying is going on in that school?

1423
01:58:20,393 --> 01:58:21,594
[SPEAKER_03]: And nobody cares.

1424
01:58:23,414 --> 01:58:26,535
[SPEAKER_03]: They go on seminars for bullying and they don't know how to handle it.

1425
01:58:28,816 --> 01:58:30,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Or we'll have a meeting with the parents.

1426
01:58:31,137 --> 01:58:32,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Or we'll have a meeting between the two kids.

1427
01:58:33,598 --> 01:58:35,098
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell good is that gonna do?

1428
01:58:35,159 --> 01:58:35,539
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a bully.

1429
01:58:37,518 --> 01:58:39,079
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't belong in a regular class.

1430
01:58:39,099 --> 01:58:40,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe there's something wrong with him.

1431
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:43,041
[SPEAKER_03]: He needs some kind of attention, special attention.

1432
01:58:44,482 --> 01:58:47,484
[SPEAKER_03]: But the resolution is I will have a meet once a week.

1433
01:58:48,485 --> 01:58:53,528
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a resolution, but we have to start enforcing the laws in this city.

1434
01:58:54,248 --> 01:58:56,550
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to go backwards here.

1435
01:58:57,790 --> 01:59:00,172
[SPEAKER_03]: They're looking for more police officers and everything else.

1436
01:59:00,792 --> 01:59:02,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Start doing the job now.

1437
01:59:02,933 --> 01:59:05,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we'll add if need be.

1438
01:59:05,859 --> 01:59:07,460
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be part of the meeting with the mayor.

1439
01:59:07,480 --> 01:59:09,782
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have to start enforcing the laws.

1440
01:59:09,802 --> 01:59:11,323
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're all in agreement.

1441
01:59:11,363 --> 01:59:18,128
[SPEAKER_03]: With the stop lines and the yield signs and park blockings, sidewalks, and all this other baloney.

1442
01:59:18,308 --> 01:59:19,849
[SPEAKER_03]: We gotta start doing it.

1443
01:59:21,651 --> 01:59:21,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1444
01:59:21,931 --> 01:59:22,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1445
01:59:22,611 --> 01:59:23,892
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're all in agreement with you, sir.

1446
01:59:26,014 --> 01:59:26,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1447
01:59:26,774 --> 01:59:27,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address of the record, please.

1448
01:59:28,135 --> 01:59:28,956
[SPEAKER_00]: Angela Moore, 30 Vine Street.

1449
01:59:30,869 --> 01:59:37,031
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was the resident that asked at the school committee meeting regarding the superintendent's contract.

1450
01:59:37,591 --> 01:59:43,113
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I asked was because it became clear to me that it was coming up within the year.

1451
01:59:43,233 --> 01:59:44,833
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand he's still under contract.

1452
01:59:46,054 --> 01:59:48,394
[SPEAKER_00]: But to find a superintendent is a lengthy process.

1453
01:59:49,435 --> 01:59:59,498
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was simply asking the school committee to start a succession plan to figure out what was going to happen if Mr. Belson decided to retire or if his contract was not to be renewed

1454
01:59:59,948 --> 02:00:01,469
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of his contract.

1455
02:00:02,409 --> 02:00:05,010
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked them to do it by June of this year.

1456
02:00:05,490 --> 02:00:10,893
[SPEAKER_00]: And I came here tonight and found out that it's actually in his contract that they should be doing that.

1457
02:00:12,033 --> 02:00:15,274
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I asked them at the school committee meeting, it was crickets.

1458
02:00:15,514 --> 02:00:16,135
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nothing.

1459
02:00:16,295 --> 02:00:24,398
[SPEAKER_00]: There was absolutely no response whatsoever, except for Mr. Belson and the mayor's somewhat questionable response.

1460
02:00:25,539 --> 02:00:28,980
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question to you is, is there a set of checks and balances?

1461
02:00:30,002 --> 02:00:39,290
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I go before the school committee and I feel I'm either not being taken seriously or I'm just not getting any answers, do I have the right to come to you?

1462
02:00:39,770 --> 02:00:44,434
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've asked the school committee, I've asked the mayor, and nothing has been done.

1463
02:00:45,295 --> 02:00:46,436
[SPEAKER_00]: So where do I go from that?

1464
02:00:47,156 --> 02:00:50,939
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I have to start a petition to say, hey, this is what's going on and I'm not the only one?

1465
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:52,701
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not crazy.

1466
02:00:53,762 --> 02:00:56,324
[SPEAKER_00]: Or can I come here to you as another

1467
02:00:57,603 --> 02:01:01,104
[SPEAKER_00]: body of elected officials to say, somebody has to do something.

1468
02:01:02,024 --> 02:01:06,445
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I'm not getting the answers when I ask where I'm supposed to ask, then where do I go?

1469
02:01:09,446 --> 02:01:12,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Carriello.

1470
02:01:13,887 --> 02:01:18,208
[SPEAKER_11]: This was the school department's budget last June.

1471
02:01:19,129 --> 02:01:20,289
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what I reviewed.

1472
02:01:20,449 --> 02:01:22,209
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what we probably all reviewed.

1473
02:01:22,549 --> 02:01:23,130
[SPEAKER_11]: And we had to

1474
02:01:24,938 --> 02:01:26,239
[SPEAKER_11]: get more information on it.

1475
02:01:26,499 --> 02:01:27,480
[SPEAKER_11]: We had to discuss it.

1476
02:01:27,500 --> 02:01:29,702
[SPEAKER_11]: I have it all tabbed.

1477
02:01:31,023 --> 02:01:36,267
[SPEAKER_11]: This is additional information that we requested and four of us stuck together and we got the information from the school department.

1478
02:01:37,768 --> 02:01:41,711
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a city council job because we approve the entire budget.

1479
02:01:42,151 --> 02:01:44,473
[SPEAKER_11]: The school and the municipal side is put together.

1480
02:01:44,993 --> 02:01:51,078
[SPEAKER_11]: So anybody, and I'll say it loud and clear because I've been getting calls from a number of people and that's fine.

1481
02:01:51,825 --> 02:01:54,867
[SPEAKER_11]: within the school department, within, you know, a number of parents.

1482
02:01:55,467 --> 02:01:56,448
[SPEAKER_11]: I review this budget.

1483
02:01:56,588 --> 02:02:03,232
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe anybody should be able to come in front of the city council to discuss issues, concerns, or problems and try to get resolves.

1484
02:02:03,633 --> 02:02:05,614
[SPEAKER_11]: So yes, my answer is absolutely.

1485
02:02:05,694 --> 02:02:09,156
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody can come to the city council to discuss a school issue.

1486
02:02:09,216 --> 02:02:11,478
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe we all have discussed school issues.

1487
02:02:11,558 --> 02:02:15,420
[SPEAKER_11]: We've all discussed things that we're passionate about and that we're concerned about.

1488
02:02:16,101 --> 02:02:17,862
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is what I reviewed in June.

1489
02:02:18,162 --> 02:02:24,746
[SPEAKER_11]: and there's more at my house, but I bring it sometimes with me every week in case somebody has a problem with me talking about a school issue.

1490
02:02:26,147 --> 02:02:39,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody's welcome at the city council meeting and even the mayor put out a parliamentary procedure book and it states specifically everybody to be heard so that decisions can be made without confusion.

1491
02:02:39,855 --> 02:02:42,717
[SPEAKER_11]: So this was given to us in the city from the mayor.

1492
02:02:43,117 --> 02:02:45,859
[SPEAKER_11]: We can talk about any issue because I think my

1493
02:02:46,478 --> 02:02:52,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Good colleague from the past, Councilman Caluso, said that when he wants to talk about school committee issues, the buck stops here.

1494
02:02:53,361 --> 02:02:54,022
[SPEAKER_11]: We review it.

1495
02:02:54,442 --> 02:02:55,402
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to approve it.

1496
02:02:55,803 --> 02:02:57,784
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to decide and ask questions on it.

1497
02:02:57,884 --> 02:03:07,448
[SPEAKER_11]: So, again, anybody's welcome to come and discuss issues, especially when it's with regards to hundreds and hundreds of children that go to our public schools.

1498
02:03:08,829 --> 02:03:10,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Vice President.

1499
02:03:10,130 --> 02:03:11,150
[SPEAKER_05]: You are 100% right.

1500
02:03:11,810 --> 02:03:15,032
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the People's Forum, and they are free to voice any concern they have.

1501
02:03:15,523 --> 02:03:17,344
[SPEAKER_05]: to this body at any time.

1502
02:03:18,425 --> 02:03:18,966
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion.

1503
02:03:23,469 --> 02:03:41,402
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Vice President Longo Kern that the city council schedule a meeting with the mayor to discuss the public library, succession plan for superintendent, parking enforcement, parking and sidewalks, staffing change and other topics that are of concern to this council.

1504
02:03:41,963 --> 02:03:43,424
[SPEAKER_05]: A roll call vote has been requested.

1505
02:03:45,459 --> 02:03:50,241
[SPEAKER_05]: And as amended by Councilor Falco, the budget also.

1506
02:03:51,401 --> 02:03:52,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Budget format.

1507
02:03:55,923 --> 02:03:57,024
[SPEAKER_09]: One information, Councilor Neal.

1508
02:03:57,604 --> 02:04:01,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I think that we've already agreed to have a second meeting with the administration.

1509
02:04:01,105 --> 02:04:05,187
[SPEAKER_09]: So now, wouldn't it be us adding the items that we want to discuss at this meeting?

1510
02:04:05,847 --> 02:04:08,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I think Councilor Dela Ruzzo said he has the meeting plans.

1511
02:04:08,735 --> 02:04:11,936
[SPEAKER_05]: And, but I think these are topics that right.

1512
02:04:11,956 --> 02:04:14,917
[SPEAKER_09]: So the vote, the vote that we're taking isn't to schedule it to the meeting, right?

1513
02:04:14,957 --> 02:04:16,397
[SPEAKER_09]: The vote isn't to schedule a second meeting.

1514
02:04:16,457 --> 02:04:23,820
[SPEAKER_05]: It's to have the mayor be prepared at the second meeting to discuss the vice president has had some specific concerns that she wanted to make sure we're in there.

1515
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:27,381
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think they should be in there as along with councilor Falco council.

1516
02:04:27,441 --> 02:04:27,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1517
02:04:27,981 --> 02:04:33,603
[SPEAKER_09]: What I'm getting at Mr. President is that we're not going to schedule a meeting to bring these items up to the mayor to have her say, okay, let me look at them.

1518
02:04:33,703 --> 02:04:34,003
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to,

1519
02:04:34,842 --> 02:04:38,384
[SPEAKER_09]: schedule a meeting and have a meeting and send these items to her beforehand so she can be prepared to speak on them.

1520
02:04:38,544 --> 02:04:40,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1521
02:04:40,245 --> 02:04:40,685
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree.

1522
02:04:41,406 --> 02:04:41,786
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree.

1523
02:04:41,826 --> 02:04:52,252
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe we can take that language out that we set up a meeting because one is already being set up and just put that a meeting, you know, at our meeting in May, I'd like, I mean, obviously like we want the budget items in May.

1524
02:04:52,552 --> 02:04:57,755
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we could just say in May, we'd like to discuss these six items in addition to whatever else.

1525
02:04:58,655 --> 02:05:03,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we all may have separate concerns that we may want to voice at that time also.

1526
02:05:04,478 --> 02:05:06,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clark, roll call has been requested.

1527
02:05:06,539 --> 02:05:13,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1528
02:05:32,120 --> 02:05:40,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes, six in affirmative, one absent.

1529
02:05:40,544 --> 02:05:46,907
[SPEAKER_05]: 16457, offered by Councilor Mox, be it resolved that the most recent street sweeping notification to Memphis residents be discussed.

1530
02:05:47,368 --> 02:05:48,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Mox.

1531
02:05:50,389 --> 02:05:51,490
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1532
02:05:53,711 --> 02:05:55,132
[SPEAKER_19]: Here we go again, year after year.

1533
02:05:56,012 --> 02:06:01,535
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a street sweeping program, but we have improper notification to residents.

1534
02:06:02,351 --> 02:06:10,493
[SPEAKER_19]: And we have a lack of permanent signage, which, in my opinion, would solve a lot of issues regarding notification.

1535
02:06:11,473 --> 02:06:17,834
[SPEAKER_19]: I realize the city has put out electronic billboards in certain areas to notify residents.

1536
02:06:18,474 --> 02:06:22,775
[SPEAKER_19]: I know the city will tell residents to go look at a city website.

1537
02:06:23,535 --> 02:06:25,775
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know the city has done reverse 911.

1538
02:06:26,775 --> 02:06:29,496
[SPEAKER_19]: However, Mr. President, with that being said,

1539
02:06:30,227 --> 02:06:36,829
[SPEAKER_19]: We still have residents, and most recently, within the last week, that were tagged and towed at $176.

1540
02:06:36,969 --> 02:06:47,171
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you imagine coming home from a hard day's work and finding your car not in front of your house and finding that you have to go pick it up and pay $176?

1541
02:06:47,211 --> 02:06:50,352
[SPEAKER_19]: And this was a resident, Mr. President, on Hamlin Ave that

1542
02:06:56,150 --> 02:07:01,193
[SPEAKER_19]: has a landline, and never received the reverse 911 call.

1543
02:07:01,913 --> 02:07:10,599
[SPEAKER_19]: So they picked up the phone, and they called the administration up, and the administration asked the person, how long have you been in this city?

1544
02:07:11,159 --> 02:07:13,981
[SPEAKER_19]: And the person said, pretty much my whole life, a number of years.

1545
02:07:14,921 --> 02:07:24,067
[SPEAKER_19]: And the person on the phone from the administration said, well, you should know better that street sweeping's done in the spring and the fall,

1546
02:07:25,607 --> 02:07:27,407
[SPEAKER_19]: And you should know better.

1547
02:07:28,348 --> 02:07:31,588
[SPEAKER_19]: And the gentleman went on to say, well, I was never called.

1548
02:07:31,848 --> 02:07:33,868
[SPEAKER_19]: I never received the reverse 911 call.

1549
02:07:35,029 --> 02:07:39,730
[SPEAKER_19]: And the administration checked into it, called the police department.

1550
02:07:40,150 --> 02:07:46,071
[SPEAKER_19]: And indeed, this landline, which is a method number, was not part of the reverse 911.

1551
02:07:47,711 --> 02:07:50,391
[SPEAKER_19]: And the resident went on to say, well, what are you going to do for me now?

1552
02:07:51,472 --> 02:07:53,812
[SPEAKER_19]: And they were told more or less,

1553
02:07:54,653 --> 02:08:04,199
[SPEAKER_19]: that they could try to appeal the ticket, but the toe for the most part was a done deal, and that maybe better luck next time.

1554
02:08:05,380 --> 02:08:08,582
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, this is just one out of many, many stories.

1555
02:08:09,363 --> 02:08:17,448
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I was told by an officer that there were so many tags and toes in certain areas,

1556
02:08:18,699 --> 02:08:25,305
[SPEAKER_19]: that the administration sent out a message to the police department, stop tagging and towing.

1557
02:08:26,125 --> 02:08:43,440
[SPEAKER_19]: So here you have someone on Hamlin Street that received $176 ticket and someone three streets over that happened to be in that grace period when the administration gave their blessing to the police department because of the number of phone calls.

1558
02:08:43,846 --> 02:08:53,592
[SPEAKER_19]: and the number of irate residents calling up saying, I was unaware of this, that the administration asked that tagging and towing cease.

1559
02:08:56,779 --> 02:09:02,703
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know why this community can't come up with a full-fledged street sweeping program.

1560
02:09:03,303 --> 02:09:08,086
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm not asking to do what the city of Somerville does twice a week, which is a great program.

1561
02:09:08,366 --> 02:09:10,687
[SPEAKER_19]: They have signage there.

1562
02:09:10,727 --> 02:09:11,788
[SPEAKER_19]: They have permanent signage.

1563
02:09:12,408 --> 02:09:22,314
[SPEAKER_19]: And in a thickly settled area, actually, it's the thickly settled area in the United States per square footage and population.

1564
02:09:22,714 --> 02:09:24,955
[SPEAKER_19]: They're able to sweep their streets twice a week.

1565
02:09:26,553 --> 02:09:30,134
[SPEAKER_19]: And we do ours twice a year, and we can't even do the proper notification.

1566
02:09:30,654 --> 02:09:37,837
[SPEAKER_19]: So I've been asking for years now that the administration create a full-fledged street sweeping program.

1567
02:09:38,537 --> 02:09:50,221
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm not sure why we can't get over that hurdle, but to have residents base their notification on one or two electronic billboards that they may never pass in the city.

1568
02:09:50,768 --> 02:10:04,474
[SPEAKER_19]: or ask them to go on a city website that they may not have access to a computer, or tell them that you'll get a reverse 9-1-1 call when they're not on the reverse 9-1-1 system is a real concern, Mr. President.

1569
02:10:05,214 --> 02:10:19,340
[SPEAKER_19]: And in my opinion, I advise the resident, which I would tell any resident, that because the street sweeping is not clearly posted, that I don't believe that they could be given a ticket, let alone towed.

1570
02:10:20,137 --> 02:10:28,180
[SPEAKER_19]: And, uh, you know, that, that'll be, uh, you know, if residents want to get together and file a class action suit, uh, then so be it.

1571
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:32,021
[SPEAKER_19]: But I don't think you can tag or toe if it's not posted.

1572
02:10:32,741 --> 02:10:39,724
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't think a proper posting is saying it's on a website or saying that it's on a billboard in Meffitt square.

1573
02:10:40,164 --> 02:10:41,504
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think that's proper posting.

1574
02:10:42,185 --> 02:10:48,647
[SPEAKER_19]: And, uh, the city has a real concern and they've been able to get away with, uh, this, uh, facade of,

1575
02:10:49,358 --> 02:10:50,979
[SPEAKER_19]: a street-sweeping program.

1576
02:10:51,900 --> 02:10:57,343
[SPEAKER_19]: But, you know, I think before long, Mr. President, we have to take action.

1577
02:10:57,783 --> 02:10:59,624
[SPEAKER_19]: And maybe the Public Works Committee.

1578
02:11:00,144 --> 02:11:04,667
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't know if Councilor Knight's the chairman of that or — I might even be chairman of that.

1579
02:11:06,648 --> 02:11:09,169
[SPEAKER_19]: You know — We might have.

1580
02:11:09,550 --> 02:11:15,093
[SPEAKER_19]: But I — I think this may be the appropriate time, Mr. President,

1581
02:11:17,301 --> 02:11:28,455
[SPEAKER_19]: We send a message to the administration that in a city this size, that we need a legitimate program with legitimate notification that gives residents ample time.

1582
02:11:29,015 --> 02:11:30,357
[SPEAKER_19]: Residents that I've spoken with say

1583
02:11:30,777 --> 02:11:34,099
[SPEAKER_19]: If they get notification, they'll get their car off the street.

1584
02:11:34,559 --> 02:11:38,541
[SPEAKER_19]: I haven't heard one person say, you know what, I'm not moving my car for street sweeping.

1585
02:11:38,941 --> 02:11:40,902
[SPEAKER_19]: They just want proper notification.

1586
02:11:41,502 --> 02:11:43,003
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all residents are looking for.

1587
02:11:43,463 --> 02:12:00,492
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would ask that the Public Works Subcommittee convene and discuss the issue of a full-fledged street sweeping program that has proper notification and permanent signage throughout the community, Mr. President.

1588
02:12:00,737 --> 02:12:01,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1589
02:12:02,358 --> 02:12:03,099
[SPEAKER_08]: President Del Rosso.

1590
02:12:04,020 --> 02:12:04,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1591
02:12:05,201 --> 02:12:21,694
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was through the work of former Councilor Camuso some years ago that it was initiated that there'd be regular street sweeping on some of the main thoroughfares in the city on a weekly basis during the non-winter months.

1592
02:12:22,875 --> 02:12:24,597
[SPEAKER_08]: It was done as a trial period and

1593
02:12:25,387 --> 02:12:30,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it was ever declared as a permanent fixture.

1594
02:12:30,468 --> 02:12:33,828
[SPEAKER_08]: They do, but it was always considered to be a trial.

1595
02:12:33,968 --> 02:12:36,609
[SPEAKER_08]: It was always referred to as the pilot.

1596
02:12:36,649 --> 02:12:37,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, thank you.

1597
02:12:37,809 --> 02:12:39,089
[SPEAKER_08]: The pilot program.

1598
02:12:39,649 --> 02:12:54,092
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's very unfortunate as Councilor Marks has so clearly pointed out to us that, um, we're at this point now and, uh, and that's all we got to hang our hats on and twice a year in the neighborhoods.

1599
02:12:54,954 --> 02:13:22,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I, uh, would hope that, um, uh, that when the subcommittee on, uh, the highway department of public works meets that, uh, they come up with a, uh, plan for the city to make a, uh, maybe we should ask for baby steps and, uh, something that's achievable to have a, uh, more, uh, expanded regular sweeping of the streets.

1600
02:13:23,290 --> 02:13:24,551
[SPEAKER_08]: I know they come by every morning.

1601
02:13:24,571 --> 02:13:25,372
[SPEAKER_08]: They do the squares.

1602
02:13:25,452 --> 02:13:35,399
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if I'm not woken up by trash trucks or the barrel men emptying the public barrels on the corner, it's the street sweeper outside my house at three or four in the morning.

1603
02:13:35,960 --> 02:13:37,841
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know they're out there regularly.

1604
02:13:39,102 --> 02:13:40,163
[SPEAKER_08]: And they do a good job.

1605
02:13:40,223 --> 02:13:41,764
[SPEAKER_08]: And it certainly makes a difference.

1606
02:13:41,964 --> 02:13:47,468
[SPEAKER_08]: But we need to see that difference have some penetration within the neighborhood.

1607
02:13:47,708 --> 02:13:52,632
[SPEAKER_08]: So I hope that's considered in the subcommittee.

1608
02:13:52,990 --> 02:13:54,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Del Rosso.

1609
02:13:54,191 --> 02:13:56,271
[SPEAKER_05]: I am out there early in the morning, and I see the cars.

1610
02:13:56,772 --> 02:14:00,353
[SPEAKER_05]: I see them out there doing their job, and they do a good job.

1611
02:14:01,674 --> 02:14:02,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilman Knight.

1612
02:14:02,434 --> 02:14:03,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1613
02:14:03,615 --> 02:14:04,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you head of that subcommittee?

1614
02:14:04,835 --> 02:14:08,537
[SPEAKER_09]: I am, Councilman Mox, myself, and you, actually.

1615
02:14:08,677 --> 02:14:13,459
[SPEAKER_09]: The three of us make it up, and I'm sure if we put our heads together, we'll be able to come up with something.

1616
02:14:13,879 --> 02:14:18,081
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to say that with the presence of our interim director,

1617
02:14:18,575 --> 02:14:26,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Brian Kerins in the DPW, I think we're in a very unique and plausible position right now to make this a reality.

1618
02:14:26,120 --> 02:14:28,001
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe Brian's background comes from U.S.

1619
02:14:28,041 --> 02:14:32,704
[SPEAKER_09]: sweep or American sweeping, where he's actually worked in the industry.

1620
02:14:32,744 --> 02:14:36,007
[SPEAKER_09]: He's worked for an organization and a company that specializes in street sweeping.

1621
02:14:36,087 --> 02:14:42,071
[SPEAKER_09]: So it would seem to me that the gentleman does have the knowledge of the industry and knows the tricks of the trade.

1622
02:14:42,111 --> 02:14:43,291
[SPEAKER_09]: And if anybody can make it happen,

1623
02:14:44,678 --> 02:14:48,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Director Karens, I think he's been doing an excellent job since his appointment, Mr. President.

1624
02:14:48,399 --> 02:14:50,640
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a pleasure to work with him.

1625
02:14:50,660 --> 02:14:53,901
[SPEAKER_09]: With that being said, I hope they can make a determination on his permanency as well.

1626
02:14:54,121 --> 02:15:00,243
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion that this matter be sent to the Department of Public Works subcommittee for action.

1627
02:15:00,263 --> 02:15:01,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded.

1628
02:15:01,404 --> 02:15:02,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Councilor Langley-Grant.

1629
02:15:03,984 --> 02:15:05,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address of the record.

1630
02:15:05,805 --> 02:15:07,406
[SPEAKER_03]: I am Nick Thomas, 29 Garfield Ave.

1631
02:15:07,486 --> 02:15:09,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a short story about the street sweeper.

1632
02:15:10,067 --> 02:15:11,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I was walking my dogs.

1633
02:15:11,407 --> 02:15:14,408
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to name the street because there's only one fireman that lives on that street.

1634
02:15:15,103 --> 02:15:18,846
[SPEAKER_03]: But cop was there, and a tow truck was there.

1635
02:15:19,126 --> 02:15:20,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Tow truck picked up the car.

1636
02:15:20,667 --> 02:15:22,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Lady comes running out in a nightgown.

1637
02:15:22,368 --> 02:15:23,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

1638
02:15:25,330 --> 02:15:27,492

[SPEAKER_20]: I come from work all day, my car's towed.

1650
02:15:55,354 --> 02:15:58,315
[SPEAKER_20]: And the story he told you, it's pretty close, it was a lot better than that.

1651
02:15:59,095 --> 02:16:05,216
[SPEAKER_20]: What kills me is you people talk, I've been watching 15 years, what she says, we talk, we talk, we talk, nothing gets done here.

1652
02:16:05,636 --> 02:16:08,217
[SPEAKER_20]: You are in control, we're the taxpayers.

1653
02:16:08,957 --> 02:16:12,838
[SPEAKER_20]: We got three or four people, they're the pet of the mayor, I'll say it, I don't care.

1654
02:16:13,238 --> 02:16:14,078
[SPEAKER_20]: I just paid almost 200 bucks,

1655
02:16:15,643 --> 02:16:16,324
[SPEAKER_20]: Nothing's done.

[SPEAKER_20]: You're talking about things.

[SPEAKER_20]: You're talking to each other.

1659
02:16:19,246 --> 02:16:19,846
[SPEAKER_20]: Nothing's done.

02:16:23,889 --> 02:16:24,990
[SPEAKER_20]: I called the police department.

1663
02:16:25,450 --> 02:16:27,552
[SPEAKER_20]: I asked him, what was the phone number of the tow company?

1664
02:16:27,632 --> 02:16:28,513
[SPEAKER_20]: Two tow companies.

1665
02:16:29,133 --> 02:16:30,834
[SPEAKER_20]: When I went there, you couldn't even get in the yard.

1666
02:16:31,835 --> 02:16:32,175
[SPEAKER_20]: OK?

1667
02:16:32,696 --> 02:16:33,837
[SPEAKER_20]: You couldn't get in the yard.

1668
02:16:34,557 --> 02:16:35,538
[SPEAKER_20]: I called the police station.

1669
02:16:36,378 --> 02:16:37,379
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Daugherty answered.

1670
02:16:37,479 --> 02:16:38,140
[SPEAKER_20]: The guy could not.

1671
02:16:39,020 --> 02:16:40,100
[SPEAKER_20]: Apologize enough.

1672
02:16:40,461 --> 02:16:44,362
[SPEAKER_20]: He said this is a disgrace the way they advertise this city.

1673
02:16:44,943 --> 02:16:46,824
[SPEAKER_20]: Know what she tells me when I call the mayor's office?

1674
02:16:47,284 --> 02:16:48,484
[SPEAKER_20]: How long you lived in this city?

1675
02:16:48,904 --> 02:16:56,168
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I lived here 28 years and I pay $7,000 on the dump of the street they don't sweep that's all torn up.

1676
02:16:56,688 --> 02:16:56,168
$7,000.

1677
02:16:57,989 --> 02:16:59,469
[SPEAKER_20]: That's why I didn't want to come here, Mr. Marks.

1678
02:16:59,509 --> 02:17:00,270
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't want to get mad.

1679
02:17:00,310 --> 02:17:00,970
[SPEAKER_20]: I've never been here.

1680
02:17:01,622 --> 02:17:02,983
[SPEAKER_20]: I had never been here, but you know something?

1681
02:17:03,404 --> 02:17:04,965
[SPEAKER_20]: People had it, you guys don't get it.

1682
02:17:05,366 --> 02:17:08,509
[SPEAKER_20]: We got rubber snappers in here, up the mirror, they're the pet.

1683
02:17:08,829 --> 02:17:10,571
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not doing the job for the taxpayers.

1684
02:17:10,831 --> 02:17:11,411
[SPEAKER_20]: I had enough.

1685
02:17:12,272 --> 02:17:14,514
[SPEAKER_20]: And then I call her up, and she tells me I should know.

1686
02:17:15,315 --> 02:17:17,237
[SPEAKER_20]: I should know, I said, how many days are in the month?

1687
02:17:17,637 --> 02:17:19,079
[SPEAKER_20]: When's fall, oh, I should've known.

1688
02:17:19,539 --> 02:17:21,541
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, she says, well, there's a sign in Memphis Square.

1689
02:17:21,561 --> 02:17:25,925
[SPEAKER_20]: I told her I probably couldn't see it, because there was probably so many papers stuck on it, you can't read it, garbage.

1690
02:17:28,008 --> 02:17:28,788
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the truth.

1691
02:17:29,188 --> 02:17:30,869
[SPEAKER_20]: So she said to me, well, I'll get back to you.

1692
02:17:31,709 --> 02:17:33,149
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I called the police department.

1693
02:17:33,910 --> 02:17:41,652
[SPEAKER_20]: I said, listen, if my car, they tell me to move it off the street like he said, what do you think, I'm gonna leave it on the street, let him tow me home, 200 bucks, tow my car?

1694
02:17:42,532 --> 02:17:42,832
[SPEAKER_20]: You know?

1695
02:17:43,552 --> 02:17:44,833
[SPEAKER_20]: So she said, well, I'll get back to you.

1696
02:17:44,913 --> 02:17:48,334
[SPEAKER_20]: I called the police department, and they told me I was never in the system.

1697
02:17:48,354 --> 02:17:49,594
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, she swore up and down.

1698
02:17:50,114 --> 02:17:51,455
[SPEAKER_20]: So I said, how can I go about this?

1699
02:17:51,935 --> 02:17:54,756
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you could try to contest a ticket.

1700
02:17:55,016 --> 02:17:56,176
[SPEAKER_20]: You gotta write a letter to the,

1701
02:17:57,633 --> 02:17:58,574
[SPEAKER_20]: Traffic commissioned.

1702
02:17:59,155 --> 02:18:00,116
[SPEAKER_20]: Why do I gotta write a letter?

1703
02:18:00,417 --> 02:18:01,979
[SPEAKER_20]: Why can't that go to the mayor's office?

1704
02:18:01,999 --> 02:18:03,080
[SPEAKER_20]: You people take care of it.

1705
02:18:03,120 --> 02:18:03,681
[SPEAKER_20]: Take it there.

1706
02:18:03,721 --> 02:18:04,482
[SPEAKER_20]: She's the power.

1707
02:18:04,522 --> 02:18:05,523
[SPEAKER_20]: She runs this place.

1708
02:18:06,204 --> 02:18:07,025
[SPEAKER_20]: She's the power.

1709
02:18:07,606 --> 02:18:08,246
[SPEAKER_20]: She runs it.

1710
02:18:09,304 --> 02:18:11,566
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, when everybody needed a vote, she was there.

1711
02:18:12,486 --> 02:18:13,647
[SPEAKER_20]: Where's the change, she said.

1712
02:18:13,727 --> 02:18:14,568

[SPEAKER_20]: We got change, we got change.

1714
02:18:16,589 --> 02:18:18,751
[SPEAKER_20]: Like she said, Roy Grouchy should be fired.

1715
02:18:18,791 --> 02:18:20,732
[SPEAKER_20]: If I ever talk back to my boss, I'd be gone.

1716
02:18:20,892 --> 02:18:22,033
[SPEAKER_20]: He'd be gone, it's the truth.

1717
02:18:22,073 --> 02:18:23,214
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't say forget about it.

1718
02:18:23,454 --> 02:18:24,235
[SPEAKER_20]: He'd be gone.

1719
02:18:24,675 --> 02:18:26,016
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the real world out there.

[SPEAKER_19]: As we all know, the first $100,000, every resident exempt based on their assessed value, the first 100,000, and there's no need for taxpayers to file an exemption based on the 100,000.

1788
02:21:45,960 --> 02:21:52,124
[SPEAKER_19]: However, there is an exemption for moderate and low-income seniors and low-income homeowners.

1789
02:21:53,029 --> 02:21:59,472
[SPEAKER_19]: And to be considered for this exemption, taxpayers must file exemption forms with the assessor's office.

1790
02:22:00,032 --> 02:22:08,115
[SPEAKER_19]: And you can go on the city website and go into the department of the assessor's office and find the form itself.

1791
02:22:08,975 --> 02:22:18,079
[SPEAKER_19]: And that also has to be accompanied with the first two pages from your most recent tax return.

1792
02:22:18,859 --> 02:22:21,360
[SPEAKER_19]: And I just wanted to explain, Mr. President,

1793
02:22:21,828 --> 02:22:26,530
[SPEAKER_19]: for those residents who may be eligible for an exemption.

1794
02:22:26,850 --> 02:22:47,840
[SPEAKER_19]: It says if you believe you qualify for a low income or moderate to low income senior exemption and wish to avoid having the CPA surcharge appear on your 2017 first quarter bill, which comes out this July, so don't think 2017's a year off, that's this July, you must file for an exemption with the assessor's office no later than May 25th, 2016.

1795
02:22:51,157 --> 02:23:04,682
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, the city was gracious enough to have an informational meeting regarding this, scheduled for May 24th, the day before the last data file at the public library.

1796
02:23:05,402 --> 02:23:14,085
[SPEAKER_19]: So, not great timing, but needless to say, the city's having a meeting on that to discuss this.

1797
02:23:14,665 --> 02:23:20,927
[SPEAKER_19]: It says, those filing for exemptions after May 25th, 2016, will not have a final determination

1798
02:23:21,437 --> 02:23:25,440
[SPEAKER_19]: on their exemption until after the first quarter tax bills have been processed.

1799
02:23:25,940 --> 02:23:28,361
[SPEAKER_19]: And surcharges will appear on their first quarter bill.

1800
02:23:28,882 --> 02:23:31,884
[SPEAKER_19]: So you can still file up to April 3rd, 2017.

1801
02:23:32,384 --> 02:23:40,729
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you don't hit the May 25th deadline to get your application in, you have until April 3rd, 2017 to submit.

1802
02:23:41,370 --> 02:23:45,052
[SPEAKER_19]: However, you will get the first surcharge in your July 2017 bill.

1803
02:23:45,092 --> 02:23:46,453
[SPEAKER_19]: So there are an exemption,

1804
02:23:50,652 --> 02:23:53,733
[SPEAKER_19]: which I got from the assessor list.

1805
02:23:53,753 --> 02:23:57,153
[SPEAKER_19]: It says these are the two categories for income limits.

1806
02:23:58,993 --> 02:24:02,554
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, just let me state the requirements for the CPA exemption.

1807
02:24:02,574 --> 02:24:09,555
[SPEAKER_19]: To qualify for the exemption for 2017, residential property owners must meet age and residency requirement.

1808
02:24:10,075 --> 02:24:17,677
[SPEAKER_19]: So you gotta be a senior and you have to own your own property.

1809
02:24:17,697 --> 02:24:19,257
[SPEAKER_19]: And income requirements based on 2015 income.

1810
02:24:21,177 --> 02:24:23,018
[SPEAKER_19]: And there are two categories of income limits.

1811
02:24:23,638 --> 02:24:28,079
[SPEAKER_19]: Over 60 years of age and under 60 years of age.

1812
02:24:28,619 --> 02:24:30,820
[SPEAKER_19]: And then it goes on to tell you the household size.

1813
02:24:31,420 --> 02:24:38,382
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you have just say three people in your household, you're over 60, your income cannot be any higher than $88,290.

1814
02:24:38,422 --> 02:24:40,962
[SPEAKER_19]: Or if you're under age 60 and three people in your family, it's $70,632.

1815
02:24:50,345 --> 02:24:53,188
[SPEAKER_19]: And you can ask these questions to the assessor when you call up.

1816
02:24:53,208 --> 02:25:00,975
[SPEAKER_19]: But this is very important, Mr. President, for those people that are eligible for an exemption, they rightfully do that.

1817
02:25:01,556 --> 02:25:03,978
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's required under state statute also.

1818
02:25:04,579 --> 02:25:06,521
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would urge people, if they feel that

1819
02:25:06,981 --> 02:25:15,983
[SPEAKER_19]: that they're eligible or even borderline to reach out to the city assessor at O'Neill at City Hall and ask the questions, Mr. President.

1820
02:25:16,423 --> 02:25:17,983
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for all that, Councilor Marks.

1821
02:25:18,043 --> 02:25:18,764
[SPEAKER_19]: That's great work.

1822
02:25:19,084 --> 02:25:19,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Caviello.

1823
02:25:19,984 --> 02:25:20,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1824
02:25:20,684 --> 02:25:32,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I spoke with many seniors in regards to this, and one of the biggest problems the seniors are coming up with is that a lot of seniors have turned their property over to their children.

1825
02:25:34,732 --> 02:25:52,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though their children don't pay the property taxes, but because of the look back rule, they're not eligible for the exemption because they're in their kids' names and most of the children make over the amounts necessary for the exemption.

1826
02:25:52,480 --> 02:25:58,183
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, as I said, we see probably half a dozen calls from different seniors saying that.

1827
02:25:58,263 --> 02:26:01,624
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, that's been a problem for the seniors with this.

1828
02:26:05,030 --> 02:26:05,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor.

1829
02:26:06,050 --> 02:26:07,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

1830
02:26:07,791 --> 02:26:11,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and Councilor Mox, I think you're right on point with your presentation.

1831
02:26:13,553 --> 02:26:26,218
[SPEAKER_09]: There is one thing that I did want to make clear, and it's if you are hit with a surcharge on May 25th, and your application is pending before the assessor's office, you will receive a refund from amounts already paid.

1832
02:26:26,258 --> 02:26:29,259
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not like you missed the deadline to file, so you're out of luck with the money.

1833
02:26:38,452 --> 02:26:51,758
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, the second item was that, um, any residential property owner who currently receives an abatement or a statutory exemption is automatically entitled to a proportional reduction in the CPC, uh, the CPA surcharge.

1834
02:26:51,818 --> 02:26:58,681
[SPEAKER_09]: So if, uh, you know, you get a reduction for being a disabled veteran, then you'd be able to get a proportional reduction on your CPA surcharge as well.

1835
02:27:00,282 --> 02:27:00,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1836
02:27:00,662 --> 02:27:03,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor chair recognizes vice president current.

1837
02:27:03,663 --> 02:27:04,323
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize.

1838
02:27:04,724 --> 02:27:07,785
[SPEAKER_08]: I pressed one of the buttons that makes everything go blank.

1839
02:27:09,526 --> 02:27:21,711
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to reiterate the dates because—you were going so quickly—because I think it's very important that people who are interested in this—and we are getting the calls with regards to exemption.

1840
02:27:21,731 --> 02:27:30,935
[SPEAKER_11]: I was the one that—I was notified by a constituent who wanted to actually file an exemption form who didn't believe they had time to do so.

1841
02:27:31,035 --> 02:27:35,137
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can file up until May 25th.

1842
02:27:37,192 --> 02:27:40,594
[SPEAKER_11]: There will be an information night, but it's on May 24th.

1843
02:27:40,714 --> 02:27:44,876
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, like Councilmember said, not very helpful, but at least it's something.

1844
02:27:45,377 --> 02:27:52,260
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to make, you know, obviously we're announcing it today, but I want to make sure that, see if the paper will put that in, make sure people are aware of this meeting.

1845
02:27:52,300 --> 02:27:58,244
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something that a lot of people are interested in and need information so that they know how to do it, they know where to go.

1846
02:27:58,704 --> 02:28:00,805
[SPEAKER_11]: People, this has not hit the Council yet.

1847
02:28:01,195 --> 02:28:09,878
[SPEAKER_11]: People are not going to complain about this, besides the few that obviously have been outspoken at the council floor, until this hits us in July.

1848
02:28:11,318 --> 02:28:15,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Once January hits, we get some emails and phone calls, and we're going to get hit.

1849
02:28:15,740 --> 02:28:25,543
[SPEAKER_11]: So anybody that needs information on this surcharge on the July tax bill, please, if you follow the criteria,

1850
02:28:26,564 --> 02:28:31,265
[SPEAKER_11]: to file an exemption, please do so, and please go to this informational meeting so you're able to do so.

1851
02:28:31,525 --> 02:28:31,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1852
02:28:32,506 --> 02:28:33,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

1853
02:28:34,026 --> 02:28:35,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair recognizes Councilor Scott Kelly.

1854
02:28:35,986 --> 02:28:36,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1855
02:28:37,307 --> 02:28:40,827
[SPEAKER_06]: I know this is such an important issue and getting the word out.

1856
02:28:41,348 --> 02:28:51,610
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that, could this fall on the privy of reaching out to Mr. Evangelista and the PR at the school department, maybe to get the word out because I've reached out with a couple of

1857
02:28:53,246 --> 02:28:59,932
[SPEAKER_06]: concerns to get some information out to the public, and it was reported with great detail.

1858
02:28:59,992 --> 02:29:06,137
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we can maybe pass that along to her and the newspapers and Allison Goldner.

1859
02:29:23,313 --> 02:29:32,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion of Councilor Marks that this matter be discussed and as amended by Councilor Scott Peli and Vice President Longo Kern.

1860
02:29:33,140 --> 02:29:34,021
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

1861
02:29:34,041 --> 02:29:34,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1862
02:29:34,601 --> 02:29:35,342
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

1863
02:29:36,363 --> 02:29:38,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

1864
02:29:38,384 --> 02:29:45,770
[SPEAKER_08]: 16-460 offered by Councilor Carviello be it resolved that the Memphis City Council discuss why many of the meters installed by Republic Parking

1865
02:29:46,208 --> 02:29:48,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Do not accept coins but credit cards only.

1866
02:29:48,990 --> 02:29:49,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Counselor Caviello.

1867
02:29:50,351 --> 02:29:51,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1868
02:29:51,031 --> 02:29:57,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I was in Haines Square last week, and there's a couple of meters there.

1869
02:29:58,836 --> 02:30:03,939
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't have any change, so I mean, I had to change my pocket.

1870
02:30:05,520 --> 02:30:06,241
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't take change.

1871
02:30:07,021 --> 02:30:07,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1872
02:30:07,602 --> 02:30:08,042
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1873
02:30:09,963 --> 02:30:14,306
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought the purpose of the meters was for convenience to put the change in.

1874
02:30:14,679 --> 02:30:19,441
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you wanted to run into the store, throw your quarter and come back out, that would be the deal.

1875
02:30:19,461 --> 02:30:25,324
[SPEAKER_05]: But the sign was saying cards only, cards only.

1876
02:30:25,344 --> 02:30:33,789
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did receive a call from the mayor's office saying that those particular meters were broken and now fixed.

1877
02:30:34,869 --> 02:30:39,692
[SPEAKER_05]: But that happened to be the case in other ones that I had worked also.

1878
02:30:40,312 --> 02:30:43,233
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know the parking's been an issue with this company.

1879
02:30:45,056 --> 02:30:50,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I say, I'm still waiting for the reports on the parking that we asked for in January.

1880
02:30:51,479 --> 02:30:56,221
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Alex has them, but I don't think any of us have actually received them formally.

1881
02:30:56,541 --> 02:31:04,344
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've also asked for a meeting with the company to discuss their practices and policies.

1882
02:31:04,745 --> 02:31:12,308
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this council himself is up to 10 tickets now that I've paid, and I get a ticket Saturday during the cleanup.

1883
02:31:13,284 --> 02:31:19,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I put my money in, I paid for my time, and in three minutes after they put the money in, I had a ticket.

1884
02:31:20,226 --> 02:31:28,909
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if this council is being targeted, but I'm up to ten right now, and every time the ladies walk in there, they don't want to see my face.

1885
02:31:28,949 --> 02:31:34,811
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, Mr. President, if we can have a meeting with this company at some point, I'd appreciate it.

1886
02:31:35,992 --> 02:31:37,112
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to do that.

1887
02:31:37,853 --> 02:31:48,321
[SPEAKER_08]: The city solicitor has advised us that they're looking at the contract, and because of some issues around the recent buyout, that we'd be wise to hold off on that matter for a while.

1888
02:31:49,402 --> 02:31:50,983
[SPEAKER_08]: And I take him ahead his word.

1889
02:31:51,804 --> 02:31:56,648
[SPEAKER_08]: I am, however, upset, as you are, that we haven't gotten those reports.

1890
02:31:56,748 --> 02:31:58,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't we get something, but it wasn't complete?

1891
02:31:59,955 --> 02:32:00,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Alex got them.

1892
02:32:01,036 --> 02:32:01,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Alex got the reports.

1893
02:32:01,676 --> 02:32:02,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Did he forward them?

1894
02:32:02,917 --> 02:32:05,499
[SPEAKER_05]: And Alex did forward them to me, but I don't want the reports from Alex.

1895
02:32:05,579 --> 02:32:07,541
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't want them from him either.

1896
02:32:07,741 --> 02:32:08,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Who got something?

1897
02:32:09,602 --> 02:32:11,904
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Alex should be the liaison to the council.

1898
02:32:12,644 --> 02:32:17,928
[SPEAKER_08]: The Louise Miller sent us, the clerk corrected me, the Louise Miller sent us something in January.

1899
02:32:17,968 --> 02:32:19,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

1900
02:32:20,350 --> 02:32:21,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1901
02:32:21,571 --> 02:32:24,713
[SPEAKER_09]: And I apologize for interrupting my coughing fit there, Councilor Cabello.

1902
02:32:26,120 --> 02:32:39,843
[SPEAKER_09]: I know several weeks back we did request, by way of resolution, a meeting with the mayor to discuss all things parking, the successes of the program, the failures of the program, pros and cons of what we're doing and where we're going in the future, Mr. President.

1903
02:32:39,863 --> 02:32:42,904
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like an update from the administration on whether or not we're still going to have that meeting.

1904
02:32:43,604 --> 02:32:47,925
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's a problem having a meeting, regardless of who the entity is that's doing the third-party work.

1905
02:32:48,125 --> 02:32:54,387
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't think that will have any impact on any type of negotiations that the legal department's having with him, Mr. President.

1906
02:32:55,154 --> 02:33:01,196
[SPEAKER_09]: With that being said, I'd like to amend the paper to request an update from the administration on the meeting request that we had made previously.

1907
02:33:01,777 --> 02:33:04,798
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Caviello as amended by Councilor Knight.

1908
02:33:04,938 --> 02:33:05,678
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

1909
02:33:05,698 --> 02:33:06,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Opposed?

1910
02:33:07,359 --> 02:33:10,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

1911
02:33:10,960 --> 02:33:12,441
[SPEAKER_08]: 16-461 offered by Councilor Caviello.

1912
02:33:12,861 --> 02:33:19,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request the Department of Public Works increase the amount of cleanups in the West Medford Municipal Parking Lot.

1913
02:33:20,184 --> 02:33:23,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Syringes are being picked up.

1914
02:33:24,876 --> 02:33:27,758
[SPEAKER_08]: on a regular basis by surrounding businesses and neighbors.

1915
02:33:28,118 --> 02:33:29,239
[SPEAKER_08]: This is serious, councilor.

1916
02:33:29,879 --> 02:33:30,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1917
02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:40,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I put this on there because Friday I received a call from one of the business owners there who went around and Friday morning picked up 12 syringes.

1918
02:33:41,267 --> 02:33:42,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Says he picks them up on a regular basis.

1919
02:33:43,808 --> 02:33:52,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I did receive a call this afternoon from Steve Tenaglia and said the syringes really are the duty of the Board of Health to be picked up.

1920
02:33:52,114 --> 02:33:54,055
[SPEAKER_05]: But obviously if these syringes are being

1921
02:33:54,888 --> 02:34:00,773
[SPEAKER_05]: are all over the parking lot, there's something going on in the parking lot there that the police should be looking into.

1922
02:34:01,193 --> 02:34:10,880
[SPEAKER_05]: But the store owners told me every morning they go out there, it's liquor bottles and syringes all over that western parking lot.

1923
02:34:11,380 --> 02:34:19,707
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we could ask the chief to increase some enforcement there, and also have the Board of Health look into this matter also, Mr. President.

1924
02:34:20,287 --> 02:34:21,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, it's a very serious matter.

1925
02:34:22,357 --> 02:34:36,095
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Caviello, as amended by Councilor Caviello to alert not only the DPW but the police chief to increase patrols and also to inform the acting director of public health.

1926
02:34:36,115 --> 02:34:36,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

1927
02:34:40,159 --> 02:34:41,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1928
02:34:41,400 --> 02:34:43,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Constantin Caprio, for bringing this forward.

1929
02:34:43,722 --> 02:34:50,968
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to further amend the paper, Mr. President, requesting that we get the schedule for the bottom line and swimming maintenance at all the bottom lines.

1930
02:34:51,628 --> 02:35:04,899
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd also like to further amend the paper requesting that a hotline be developed for individuals that do find syringes in their neighborhood at the bottom line, so on and so forth, so that they can call in, whatever that may be, so that we can begin to

1931
02:35:05,590 --> 02:35:10,053
[SPEAKER_09]: track this data and collect this data so that we can see if there are cluster problems in certain areas of the city.

1932
02:35:10,913 --> 02:35:11,474
[SPEAKER_08]: That's correct.

1933
02:35:11,514 --> 02:35:16,457
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are also regulations on how those types of shops are handled.

1934
02:35:17,237 --> 02:35:23,561
[SPEAKER_08]: So as amended by Councilor Knight, on the motion for approval, all in, amended by Councilor Caviello.

1935
02:35:23,942 --> 02:35:26,203
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion approved by Councilor Caviello, I second it.

1936
02:35:26,583 --> 02:35:27,324
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

1937
02:35:27,864 --> 02:35:28,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1938
02:35:28,464 --> 02:35:29,205
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion carries.

1939
02:35:29,665 --> 02:35:30,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1940
02:35:31,846 --> 02:35:32,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Offered by Councilor Marks,

1941
02:35:35,162 --> 02:35:37,842
[SPEAKER_08]: I skipped over this by accident and I apologize, 16-458.

1942
02:35:37,862 --> 02:35:52,845
[SPEAKER_08]: We've resolved that the city administration provide residents with an update on when the street paving will be done on Ross, Hamlin, Sherman, and any other street in the area where the road was dug up to replace gas lines.

1943
02:35:54,145 --> 02:35:55,866
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm aware of that problem, councilor.

1944
02:35:57,726 --> 02:36:03,447
[SPEAKER_08]: And it went on the same way, I think two years ago or in my neighborhood,

1945
02:36:04,087 --> 02:36:08,290
[SPEAKER_08]: with the number of streets that were year-and-a-half long projects.

1946
02:36:08,311 --> 02:36:09,952
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a shame.

1947
02:36:11,553 --> 02:36:12,574
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1948
02:36:12,674 --> 02:36:32,690
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I received a call from several residents that were promised that the streets after the gas line replacement done on Ross, Hamlin, Sherman, and a few of the other surrounding streets, that it was supposed to be last year that this was going to be replaced.

1949
02:36:33,317 --> 02:36:43,119
[SPEAKER_19]: They're wondering now we're five months into this year, and there's no sign of any street replacement after the road was dug up.

1950
02:36:43,179 --> 02:36:56,081
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would just ask that we get a response back on behalf of the residents when that work will be done and that it be done at the least inconvenient time on behalf of the residents of that area.

1951
02:36:58,381 --> 02:36:58,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

1952
02:36:58,782 --> 02:37:01,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion approved by Councilor Marks.

1953
02:37:02,142 --> 02:37:02,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

1954
02:37:03,183 --> 02:37:04,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1955
02:37:04,583 --> 02:37:07,905
[SPEAKER_09]: I certainly appreciate Councilor Marks' resolution on this topic.

1956
02:37:09,445 --> 02:37:18,949
[SPEAKER_09]: I've gotten recent calls from some of the former presidents.

1957
02:37:19,109 --> 02:37:22,271
[SPEAKER_09]: These presidents were fortunate enough to have their street put back.

1958
02:37:22,771 --> 02:37:24,752
[SPEAKER_09]: However, their street was not put back in

1959
02:37:25,673 --> 02:37:31,617
[SPEAKER_09]: of the City of Medford standards, Mr. President, and I believe the culprits were at the National Grid or was recently at the WRA.

1960
02:37:32,237 --> 02:37:37,821
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to amend the paper to request that the City Engineer report back on the status of this report as it stands.

1961
02:37:37,841 --> 02:37:40,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to approve by Councilor Marks and as amended by Councilor Knight.

1962
02:37:41,343 --> 02:37:42,124
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

1963
02:37:42,344 --> 02:37:42,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1964
02:37:42,484 --> 02:37:43,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Opposed?

1965
02:37:43,765 --> 02:37:44,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

1966
02:37:45,464 --> 02:37:49,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion of Councilor Marks to take papers under suspension and in the hand of the clerk.

1967
02:37:49,827 --> 02:37:50,568
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

1968
02:37:51,188 --> 02:37:51,989
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

1969
02:37:52,630 --> 02:37:53,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

1970
02:37:54,211 --> 02:38:08,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Offered by Councilor Caviello, 16-M, Councilor Knight, 16-463, be it resolved that the Medford City Council commend and congratulate Karen Rose and Louise Miller for their dedicated service to the City of Medford.

1971
02:38:09,221 --> 02:38:15,546
[SPEAKER_08]: We wish them good luck in their future endeavors, as they will be surely missed here in City Hall.

1972
02:38:15,906 --> 02:38:16,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Caviello.

1973
02:38:16,967 --> 02:38:17,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1974
02:38:17,688 --> 02:38:23,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I just want to wish these two wonderful individuals the best on wherever they may.

1975
02:38:24,213 --> 02:38:26,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we know where Louise is going, but we don't know where Karen's going.

1976
02:38:27,576 --> 02:38:36,163
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Karen wore many hats for the city and did an outstanding job for the residents of the city and along with Louise Miller.

1977
02:38:37,322 --> 02:38:43,164
[SPEAKER_05]: These are two dedicated employees that are leaving our employee and going on to somewhere else.

1978
02:38:43,184 --> 02:38:48,106
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, I wish them the best and wherever they happen to go in their new jobs.

1979
02:38:48,646 --> 02:38:48,786
No?

1980
02:38:49,226 --> 02:38:49,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

1981
02:38:50,366 --> 02:38:51,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Counselor Knight?

1982
02:38:51,827 --> 02:38:54,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I think Counselor Caviello covered all the bases.

1983
02:38:54,528 --> 02:38:59,790
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to congratulate you on your decision to authorize the market.

1984
02:39:07,021 --> 02:39:08,627
[SPEAKER_09]: But so be it.

1985
02:39:08,687 --> 02:39:12,881
[SPEAKER_09]: And as far as the sproes and the water health, I've had a great time.

1986
02:39:25,954 --> 02:39:37,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1987
02:39:37,199 --> 02:39:40,141
[SPEAKER_19]: And I, too, want to thank Karen Rose.

1988
02:39:40,201 --> 02:39:42,562
[SPEAKER_19]: She's been with this community a number of years.

1989
02:39:43,122 --> 02:39:52,967
[SPEAKER_19]: And as Councilor Caviello stated, she was there when the mayor asked her back some years ago to take over the senior program across the street.

1990
02:39:53,856 --> 02:40:01,241
[SPEAKER_19]: And that department, I don't know if anyone realizes, but that department back some 20 years ago was a two-person department.

1991
02:40:01,901 --> 02:40:06,404
[SPEAKER_19]: And Karen grew it into a legitimate Board of Health with, I believe, 12 employees.

1992
02:40:07,264 --> 02:40:19,251
[SPEAKER_19]: And their networking and information that they provide not only to the Board of Health and residents of this community, but also assist, behind the scenes, the police department on a number of issues.

1993
02:40:19,972 --> 02:40:22,393
[SPEAKER_19]: And Karen has done yeoman's work.

1994
02:40:23,305 --> 02:40:26,106
[SPEAKER_19]: in creating a department that I think we all can be proud of.

1995
02:40:26,206 --> 02:40:27,766
[SPEAKER_19]: And she's going to be sorely missed.

1996
02:40:28,087 --> 02:40:29,407
[SPEAKER_19]: She's a wealth of information.

1997
02:40:30,047 --> 02:40:49,253
[SPEAKER_19]: And regarding Louise Miller, I mean, you know, what can you say about someone that's been here four years that, in my opinion, has gained the trust of this council, was someone that was open and spoke frankly about the financial issues in the community, and was willing to discuss items and get answers.

1998
02:40:49,553 --> 02:40:52,394
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, she is also someone that,

1999
02:40:53,512 --> 02:40:57,915
[SPEAKER_19]: is going to be sorely missed from procurement, to budget, to personnel.

2000
02:40:58,315 --> 02:41:02,818
[SPEAKER_19]: She, for a period of time, I think it was probably a six-month period, ran City Hall.

2001
02:41:03,778 --> 02:41:07,861
[SPEAKER_19]: A very capable woman, and she is sorely going to be missed.

2002
02:41:07,921 --> 02:41:17,246
[SPEAKER_19]: And I wish her well, Mr. President, in her new life with the MWRA, and I wish her much success.

2003
02:41:18,133 --> 02:41:18,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Swann.

2004
02:41:18,853 --> 02:41:21,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion for approval by Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

2005
02:41:22,355 --> 02:41:23,056
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

2006
02:41:23,356 --> 02:41:25,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

2007
02:41:25,117 --> 02:41:26,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

2008
02:41:26,758 --> 02:41:29,139
[SPEAKER_08]: 16-466 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

2009
02:41:29,179 --> 02:41:36,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council send its condolences to the family of Whitefield Jeffers, who passed away last week at the age of 95.

2010
02:41:37,885 --> 02:41:43,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Jeffers was a World War II veteran and very active in the West Medford Community Center for many years.

2011
02:41:44,028 --> 02:41:46,349
[SPEAKER_08]: His presence in our community will be missed.

2012
02:41:48,869 --> 02:41:49,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Mr. President, please.

2013
02:41:51,210 --> 02:42:01,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Jeffers was, again, a World War II veteran, Staff Sergeant, 372nd Infantry Regiment.

2014
02:42:02,019 --> 02:42:10,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Many don't know, but Mr. Jeffers was also the second African-American firefighter in the fire department, where he served for 36 years.

2015
02:42:11,507 --> 02:42:15,250
[SPEAKER_05]: He was also president of the men's level at the Shiloh Baptist Church.

2016
02:42:16,608 --> 02:42:20,932
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was a huge volunteer at the West River Community Center.

2017
02:42:21,512 --> 02:42:24,555
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, Mr. Jeffers was a pillar of his community.

2018
02:42:25,235 --> 02:42:30,399
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's going to be missed, another person that will be missed in the community, a gentleman.

2019
02:42:31,700 --> 02:42:32,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

2020
02:42:32,061 --> 02:42:34,102
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you would, please rise for a moment of silence.

2021
02:42:50,251 --> 02:42:53,132
[SPEAKER_08]: 16-462 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

2022
02:42:53,572 --> 02:43:03,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you resolve that the administration provide the city council with an update on this summer's recreational programs and thoughts on the direction of the city full-time recreational plan?

2023
02:43:04,414 --> 02:43:05,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2024
02:43:06,375 --> 02:43:07,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2025
02:43:08,155 --> 02:43:19,938
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been getting some phone calls and I know that this is my fellow colleagues, Councilor, Vice President Lungo, her forte.

2026
02:43:20,709 --> 02:43:24,550
[SPEAKER_06]: expertise, but I know she's been very busy with many different matters.

2027
02:43:24,610 --> 02:43:35,814
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know that people have called and asked about some questions and concerns about what our plan is for our summer programs as they're trying to plan this summer's activities and childcare and so on.

2028
02:43:36,314 --> 02:43:46,778
[SPEAKER_06]: So I did talk to, um, uh, chief of staff, uh, this morning, uh, happened to meet pass for meeting and, um, where's, um,

2029
02:43:47,582 --> 02:43:57,886
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a plan that will be coming out relatively shortly with approved booklet and what's happening with the summer recreation plan.

2030
02:43:58,666 --> 02:44:14,732
[SPEAKER_06]: The other piece is that I'd like to ask the administration for, if we can, the discussions or plan that was put together through the arts and recreations transition team and see where we're going with that.

2031
02:44:15,753 --> 02:44:16,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2032
02:44:17,535 --> 02:44:22,298
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the motion of approval by Councilor Scott Pelli, seconded by Vice President Longo-Curran.

[SPEAKER_08]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate the Medford Vocational Technical High School on being awarded the gold medal for their graphic arts program at the Massachusetts Skills USA competition.

2038
02:44:44,593 --> 02:44:44,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

2039
02:44:46,590 --> 02:44:47,450
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2040
02:44:47,630 --> 02:44:48,350
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll be really brief.

2041
02:44:48,390 --> 02:44:55,012
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to congratulate Heidi Riccio and all of her staff and the teachers and the students up at the vocational school.

2042
02:44:55,712 --> 02:45:02,653
[SPEAKER_17]: They've been working very hard over the past few years to really just raise the vocational school up to the next level.

2043
02:45:03,073 --> 02:45:03,993
[SPEAKER_17]: They're doing a great job.

2044
02:45:04,754 --> 02:45:07,094
[SPEAKER_17]: They've really bolstered the programming.

2045
02:45:07,434 --> 02:45:10,275
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think this is a good sign of many things to come.

2046
02:45:10,335 --> 02:45:11,975
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just want to say congratulations to them.

2047
02:45:13,003 --> 02:45:13,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2048
02:45:13,603 --> 02:45:13,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2049
02:45:14,484 --> 02:45:17,767
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion was approved by Councilor Falco, seconded by Vice President Leto Kern.

2050
02:45:18,147 --> 02:45:18,868
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

2051
02:45:19,368 --> 02:45:19,988
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

2052
02:45:20,008 --> 02:45:24,832
[SPEAKER_08]: 16-465 offered by Councilor Falco.

2053
02:45:25,252 --> 02:45:32,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Be resolved that the Memphis City Council thank the Memphis Community Coalition for organizing the Memphis Square cleanup this past weekend.

2054
02:45:32,658 --> 02:45:33,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Councilor.

2055
02:45:33,999 --> 02:45:34,900
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2056
02:45:35,080 --> 02:45:37,662
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I just wanted to, uh, thank the Memphis Community Coalition.

2057
02:45:37,702 --> 02:45:41,365
[SPEAKER_17]: We had a, uh, well, they had a, uh, organized a cleanup this weekend in Memphis Square.

2058
02:45:42,025 --> 02:45:45,247
[SPEAKER_17]: They had probably about a total of 60 people that attended.

2059
02:45:45,907 --> 02:45:48,309
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was there and helped out.

2060
02:45:48,629 --> 02:45:50,530
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Caviello was there for a while as well.

2061
02:45:51,130 --> 02:45:52,831
[SPEAKER_17]: And we cleaned up Bedford Square.

2062
02:45:52,851 --> 02:45:54,172
[SPEAKER_17]: We had to clean it up.

2063
02:45:54,232 --> 02:45:56,253
[SPEAKER_17]: The DPW was there as well.

2064
02:45:56,273 --> 02:45:56,754
[SPEAKER_17]: They helped out.

2065
02:45:57,414 --> 02:45:59,135
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was a successful event.

2066
02:45:59,235 --> 02:46:00,816
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just want to thank them for organizing it.

2067
02:46:01,156 --> 02:46:01,697
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

2068
02:46:01,977 --> 02:46:02,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2069
02:46:02,657 --> 02:46:04,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you to the community coalition.

2070
02:46:04,058 --> 02:46:04,798
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

2071
02:46:05,259 --> 02:46:05,919
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

2072
02:46:05,979 --> 02:46:06,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

2073
02:46:07,320 --> 02:46:10,742
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a motion for approval by Councilor Falwell, seconded by Councilor Marks.

2074
02:46:11,642 --> 02:46:14,844
[SPEAKER_08]: And the final paper before us tonight is offered by Councilor Marks.

2075
02:46:15,364 --> 02:46:23,869
[SPEAKER_08]: He resolved that the crosswalk at the corner of North street and Capon be painted and the pothole repaired in the interest of public safety.

2076
02:46:23,929 --> 02:46:24,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Marks.

2077
02:46:25,450 --> 02:46:26,471
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2078
02:46:26,571 --> 02:46:30,073
[SPEAKER_19]: It appears that we're going to do a one crosswalk at a time in this community.

2079
02:46:30,173 --> 02:46:36,397
[SPEAKER_19]: So, uh, when residents send me an email or give me a phone call, I told them I'll put it on the agenda.

2080
02:46:36,437 --> 02:46:38,298
[SPEAKER_19]: This happens to be probably the third or fourth.

2081
02:46:39,218 --> 02:46:39,979
[SPEAKER_19]: And, um,

2082
02:46:40,584 --> 02:46:47,887
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I had the opportunity to drive down Mass Avenue in Arlington the other day.

2083
02:46:48,867 --> 02:46:57,910
[SPEAKER_19]: And let me tell you, every intersection had pedestrian crossing neon signs at both ends of the street.

2084
02:46:58,891 --> 02:47:04,593
[SPEAKER_19]: They had the thermoplastic crosswalks very visible the whole length of the street.

2085
02:47:06,177 --> 02:47:06,517
[SPEAKER_19]: really.

2086
02:47:06,717 --> 02:47:16,501
[SPEAKER_19]: It just, you know, a beautiful presentation on what really should be done when we talk about safe streets and so forth and roads.

2087
02:47:17,241 --> 02:47:22,843
[SPEAKER_19]: And I just can't fathom why we can't get our crosswalks painted, Mr. President.

2088
02:47:22,883 --> 02:47:26,924
[SPEAKER_19]: But I am going to continue to offer them as residents reach out to me one at a time.

2089
02:47:27,685 --> 02:47:30,085
[SPEAKER_19]: And I give thank the DPW.

2090
02:47:30,105 --> 02:47:33,867
[SPEAKER_19]: They've been doing the requests that are on the council agenda.

2091
02:47:34,247 --> 02:47:34,527
[SPEAKER_19]: I just,

2092
02:47:34,935 --> 02:47:38,696
[SPEAKER_19]: We'd like to see them do the entire city, so we don't have to do them one at a time.

2093
02:47:38,756 --> 02:47:42,137
[SPEAKER_19]: But apparently, they have a lot on their plate.

2094
02:47:42,217 --> 02:47:49,660
[SPEAKER_19]: But Connor of North Street and Cape Street, Mr. President, I move approval of the crosswalk be painted.

2095
02:47:49,700 --> 02:47:49,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2096
02:47:50,380 --> 02:48:01,504
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, at the widest place on Mass Ave, up close to Arlington Heights, where it's really broad, you can walk across that street safely without having to be worried.

2097
02:48:02,222 --> 02:48:03,443
[SPEAKER_08]: because of the way they do it there.

2098
02:48:04,003 --> 02:48:07,464
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Marks, all those in favor?

2099
02:48:08,045 --> 02:48:08,765
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

2100
02:48:08,825 --> 02:48:09,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carried.

2101
02:48:10,686 --> 02:48:16,789
[SPEAKER_08]: The records of last week, April 12th.

2102
02:48:17,129 --> 02:48:17,329
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

2103
02:48:21,711 --> 02:48:25,473
[SPEAKER_08]: The tabled records of the April 12th were passed to Vice President Long and Kern.

2104
02:48:25,993 --> 02:48:28,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Vice President, how did you find those records?

2105
02:48:28,394 --> 02:48:30,415
[SPEAKER_08]: I reviewed the records and find them in order, move approval.

2106
02:48:30,930 --> 02:48:34,491
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion for approval by Vice President Angelo Kern, all those in favor?

2107
02:48:35,311 --> 02:48:36,051
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

2108
02:48:36,651 --> 02:48:37,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

2109
02:48:37,631 --> 02:48:38,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President?

2110
02:48:38,591 --> 02:48:39,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Mr. Counselor.

2111
02:48:39,632 --> 02:48:40,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Just if we could.

2112
02:48:40,572 --> 02:48:40,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Please.

2113
02:48:41,392 --> 02:48:43,092
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a follow up from a couple of weeks ago.

2114
02:48:43,112 --> 02:48:50,213
[SPEAKER_19]: I offered a resolution asking that Representative Donato give us an update on the home rule charter petition.

2115
02:48:50,493 --> 02:48:50,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2116
02:48:51,054 --> 02:48:52,694
[SPEAKER_19]: And we did receive something in the packet.

2117
02:48:52,734 --> 02:48:57,575
[SPEAKER_19]: If I could just, it's not that long from Representative Donato, who I appreciate dated April 28th.

2118
02:48:59,528 --> 02:49:08,553
[SPEAKER_19]: It says, dear Mr. Finn and honorable members of the city council, this is in response to the resolution of April 12th, 2016 that I received on April 27th, 2016.

2119
02:49:08,713 --> 02:49:21,359
[SPEAKER_19]: I am enclosing a copy of Bill 4277 that was referred to the Committee on Election Laws on April 19th, and on April 21st, the Senate concurred.

2120
02:49:21,859 --> 02:49:26,642
[SPEAKER_19]: I have requested the chairman of the Committee on Election Laws have a hearing on this bill as soon as possible.

2121
02:49:27,090 --> 02:49:31,712
[SPEAKER_19]: In the meantime, if I can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.

2122
02:49:32,172 --> 02:49:40,616
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would just ask that maybe we, as a council, send a letter to the chairman of the Committee on Election Laws.

2123
02:49:40,676 --> 02:49:42,376
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe that's a joint committee.

2124
02:49:42,396 --> 02:49:44,457
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if Councilman Knight remembers.

2125
02:49:47,739 --> 02:49:53,761
[SPEAKER_19]: So this must be the House committee, then, if the Senate concurred.

2126
02:49:56,367 --> 02:50:12,898
[SPEAKER_19]: a letter from the City Council asking the House Chairman of Election Laws to establish a public hearing on it, and also that, you know, they already know we're in support, but show that the Memphis City Council's in support, Mr. President.

2127
02:50:13,339 --> 02:50:19,703
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I think we need also, as well as our state delegation, to make sure this gets shepherded through the process.

2128
02:50:20,343 --> 02:50:25,887
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't think of a better advocate for this process than the Assistant Majority Leader.

2129
02:50:26,368 --> 02:50:27,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Paul J. Donato.

2130
02:50:28,109 --> 02:50:35,913
[SPEAKER_08]: But at your request, Mr. Clerk, if you would kindly send a letter requesting action on this on behalf of the City Council.

2131
02:50:35,953 --> 02:50:36,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

2132
02:50:36,994 --> 02:50:42,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, for the reasons stated multiple times before, it has to be recorded in opposition on this matter.

2133
02:50:43,817 --> 02:50:44,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2134
02:50:45,378 --> 02:50:46,319
[SPEAKER_09]: And I am in too.

2135
02:50:50,221 --> 02:50:52,462
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion for approval, all those in favor?

2136
02:50:58,400 --> 02:50:59,401
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in opposition?

2137
02:50:59,881 --> 02:50:59,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

2138
02:51:00,441 --> 02:51:00,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

2139
02:51:05,624 --> 02:51:06,745
[SPEAKER_19]: You want to call a roll call vote?

2140
02:51:06,785 --> 02:51:07,665
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that what you're looking for?

2141
02:51:07,985 --> 02:51:09,766
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the chair is in doubt.

2142
02:51:09,786 --> 02:51:14,269
[SPEAKER_08]: The roll call vote has been requested.

2143
02:51:14,369 --> 02:51:16,530
[SPEAKER_08]: And what do we, can you just?

2144
02:51:16,590 --> 02:51:27,336
[SPEAKER_08]: The councillor has asked that a letter be sent on behalf of the city council to both the chairman of the house election rules committee and election laws committee

2145
02:51:27,786 --> 02:51:40,056
[SPEAKER_08]: and also the Senate election laws committee to, um, uh, let the council, uh, to indicate the council's interest in this matter and task public hearings in both those committee.

2146
02:51:41,057 --> 02:51:41,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2147
02:51:43,739 --> 02:51:44,440
[SPEAKER_08]: On that motion.

2148
02:51:45,521 --> 02:51:46,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2149
02:51:47,422 --> 02:51:48,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Caviello.

2150
02:51:49,324 --> 02:51:50,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco.

2151
02:51:50,905 --> 02:51:51,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

2152
02:51:51,526 --> 02:51:51,686
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2153
02:51:52,326 --> 02:51:53,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice-president O'Connor.

2154
02:51:53,247 --> 02:51:53,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2155
02:51:54,108 --> 02:51:54,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Moxley.

2156
02:51:54,889 --> 02:51:55,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2157
02:51:55,509 --> 02:51:56,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scott Kelly.

2158
02:51:56,430 --> 02:51:56,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2159
02:51:57,414 --> 02:51:57,514
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2160
02:51:57,534 --> 02:52:01,097
[SPEAKER_08]: The vote of four in the affirmative, two in the negative, one absent.

2161
02:52:01,577 --> 02:52:02,458
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion passes.

2162
02:52:03,799 --> 02:52:04,820
[SPEAKER_11]: Before we adjourn.

2163
02:52:05,420 --> 02:52:05,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

2164
02:52:05,961 --> 02:52:06,281
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2165
02:52:06,741 --> 02:52:06,941
[SPEAKER_11]: Please.

2166
02:52:06,982 --> 02:52:09,844
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I wasn't able, I was trying to work this morning.

2167
02:52:10,004 --> 02:52:17,209
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, was there a meeting and if maybe we could get an update just so, or is there a committee?

2168
02:52:17,229 --> 02:52:19,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, we're going to do it next week if it's fine.

2169
02:52:19,291 --> 02:52:21,513
[SPEAKER_08]: There'll be a committee report forthcoming on that.

2170
02:52:21,593 --> 02:52:25,656
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll let that show the proper committee procedure, the records of the meeting of

2171
02:52:26,143 --> 02:52:29,884
[SPEAKER_08]: April 26, 2016 will pass to Councillor Knight.

2172
02:52:30,325 --> 02:52:32,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Councillor, how do you find those?

2173
02:52:32,085 --> 02:52:43,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, quickly on a side note, we had item 16-438 filed relative to Clematis Road and some construction debris that was left at the site after the road was closed.

2174
02:52:44,550 --> 02:52:49,211
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to thank the administration for taking the appropriate and proper steps to get them out there to get the equipment removed.

2175
02:52:49,271 --> 02:52:52,353
[SPEAKER_09]: They actually came back and resurfaced the street as well.

2176
02:52:52,413 --> 02:52:53,573
[SPEAKER_09]: So they did an excellent job.

2177
02:52:53,983 --> 02:53:02,489
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to thank the administration for their efforts, and I'd like to thank the contractor, Dallas Sandra Corporation, for getting out there in such a prompt and quick matter after we told them to get out there and do it.

2178
02:53:02,809 --> 02:53:05,471
[SPEAKER_09]: But with that being said, Mr. President, I've reviewed the minutes.

2179
02:53:05,491 --> 02:53:13,217
[SPEAKER_09]: I've also spoken with my colleagues that have had a number of items on the agenda that evening, and there didn't seem to be any items that were out of order, so I'd move for approval.

2180
02:53:13,757 --> 02:53:15,899
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion for approval of those records by Councilor Knight.

2181
02:53:15,959 --> 02:53:16,639
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

2182
02:53:17,099 --> 02:53:17,800
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

2183
02:53:18,279 --> 02:53:20,343
[SPEAKER_08]: on the motion of Councilor Falco that we adjourn.

2184
02:53:20,363 --> 02:53:21,185
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

2185
02:53:21,505 --> 02:53:22,207
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

2186
02:53:22,247 --> 02:53:23,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Meeting adjourned.

2187
02:53:23,770 --> 02:53:24,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, America.
