So, I went to

225
00:27:02,568 --> 00:27:05,329
to Little Mermaids, and guess what?

226
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:07,109
I went to a fun rollercoaster.

227
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:13,990
And I was almost gonna pass out, but it was still fun!

228

It was really, really fun.

229
00:27:18,631 --> 00:27:21,291
Okay, let's start.

230
00:27:22,872 --> 00:27:26,752
First, let's talk about the alphabet.

231
00:27:28,473 --> 00:27:30,073
Let's say the alphabet.

232
00:27:30,446 --> 00:27:32,407
Repeat after me.

233
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:39,433
A, I mean, a, music.

234
00:27:41,134 --> 00:27:51,361
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N,

235
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:05,528
I was just being silly sometimes.

236
00:28:05,968 --> 00:28:06,328
Okay.

237
00:28:06,408 --> 00:28:09,110
N-I-E-O-P-Q-R-S-T-U-V-W-X

238
00:28:34,226 --> 00:28:36,607
It was so fun, right?

239
00:28:37,988 --> 00:28:43,412
But let's see how many letters are there.

240
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:46,294
Count with me.

241
00:28:50,037 --> 00:28:57,602
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

242
00:28:59,153 --> 00:28:59,673
nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27.

243
00:29:01,174 --> 00:29:02,055
Oh, there's 27 letters.

244
00:29:02,675 --> 00:29:03,396
But now,

245
00:29:32,006 --> 00:29:36,288
Let's do the English this time.

246
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:36,288
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

247
00:30:01,353 --> 00:30:02,014
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, and 26.

248
00:30:02,574 --> 00:30:03,775
That's 26 letters.

249
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,137
How does that even do that?

250
00:30:06,157 --> 00:30:08,359
27 letters here, 26 letters here.

251
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:12,783
We could do more than that.

252
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:33,743
26 is less than 27.

253
00:30:33,863 --> 00:30:35,104
27 is more than 26.

254
00:30:35,144 --> 00:30:36,725
Okay, let's do the vowels.

255
00:30:37,285 --> 00:30:37,805
Vocales.

256
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:08,638
Okay, let's say the letters.

257
00:31:09,998 --> 00:31:14,159
But this time it's gonna be a little different.

258
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:25,081
A, E, I, O, U. Hmm.

259
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:27,722
Hmm.

260
00:31:29,622 --> 00:31:31,843
Let's see, let's see.

261
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:35,740
Where's the letters in this picture?

262
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,221
Is it right here?

263
00:31:38,602 --> 00:31:39,142
No.

264
00:31:39,162 --> 00:31:40,623
Is it right here?

265
00:31:40,863 --> 00:31:41,343
No.

266
00:31:41,684 --> 00:31:42,504
Is it right here?

267
00:31:43,765 --> 00:31:44,786
Yeah.

268
00:31:45,626 --> 00:31:46,066
How?

269
00:31:48,288 --> 00:31:49,409
This, this.

270
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:51,690
It is the letter A!

271
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:54,152
Ah!

272
00:31:56,213 --> 00:31:58,334
Let's spell it.

273
00:32:01,456 --> 00:32:01,777
But,

274
00:32:05,001 --> 00:32:07,502
See you next time.

275
00:32:08,242 --> 00:32:10,102
Okay, welcome to part two.

276
00:32:12,203 --> 00:32:20,665
Okay, but this time we're gonna do the vowels, but with words.

277
00:32:22,026 --> 00:32:23,386
Palabras.

278
00:32:25,287 --> 00:32:31,568
E. E and the vowels.

279
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:34,289
Okay, let's draw something.

280
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:38,834
Okay, let's draw a eyeball.

281
00:32:38,854 --> 00:32:41,599
I know what it is!

282
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:06,290
Okay.

283
00:33:12,915 --> 00:33:13,696
Arbol!

284
00:33:18,761 --> 00:33:19,721
Estrella.

285
00:33:38,168 --> 00:33:39,148
Isla.

286
00:33:39,469 --> 00:33:46,975
I know an island.

287
00:33:58,945 --> 00:33:59,686
Sand.

288
00:33:59,926 --> 00:34:02,348
This is the sand.

289
00:34:03,129 --> 00:34:04,730
And now the tree.

290
00:34:17,583 --> 00:34:21,346
Coconuts.

291
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:27,612
Coco, coco, coconuts, coconuts.

292
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:30,434
Now last one.

293
00:34:32,876 --> 00:34:35,939
We got three right.

294
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:36,720
Okay.

295
00:34:37,841 --> 00:34:38,902

00:34:42,865 --> 00:34:43,205
Bear.

298
00:34:49,563 --> 00:34:56,050
It's easy to draw a circle to your

299
00:35:59,753 --> 00:36:04,196
Grapes!

300
00:36:04,216 --> 00:36:13,424
They're healthy fruits.

301
00:36:22,242 --> 00:36:22,763
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

302
00:36:23,983 --> 00:36:24,103
OK.

303
00:37:01,564 --> 00:37:03,486
Arbol, tree.

You went to Disney World.

322
00:38:21,142 --> 00:38:23,063
So good.

323
00:38:24,744 --> 00:38:26,984
I went to Disney World before with my daddy.

324
00:38:28,935 --> 00:38:33,079
I saw the princesses, I didn't get the dress, but it was still fun.

I saw the little mermaid, I saw everything.

Even I went to a fun rollercoaster in Disney World.

327
00:38:41,866 --> 00:38:45,469
It was very, very fun, but I was almost gonna pass out.

328
00:38:46,009 --> 00:38:47,310
It was very, very fun.

329

Okay.

And guess what?

353
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:54,728
I went to a fun roller coaster.

354
00:40:56,917 --> 00:41:01,840

01:02:27,441 --> 01:02:32,523
Hey guys, welcome back to school.

550
01:02:35,024 --> 01:02:38,445
Welcome back to school.

551
01:02:40,746 --> 01:02:47,048
Today, we're going to learn about the alphabet in Spanish.

552
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:54,754
It's called El Alphabeto.

553
01:02:54,774 --> 01:03:02,319
El Alphabeto.

554
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:08,623
But first, like and subscribe.

555
01:03:09,764 --> 01:03:17,470
Look down below and look for the subscribe button.

556
01:03:19,166 --> 01:03:23,249
What do you do in your vacation, Maria?

557
01:03:25,331 --> 01:03:27,612
You went to Disney World.

558
01:03:28,613 --> 01:03:30,915
I went to Disney World, too.

559
01:03:31,796 --> 01:03:33,037
It was so fun.

560
01:03:33,637 --> 01:03:36,599
I didn't get the dress, but it was so much fun.

561
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:38,100
Like, really.

562
01:03:39,401 --> 01:03:40,642
Literally, so much fun.

563
01:03:40,662 --> 01:03:42,644
So, I went to

564
01:03:47,608 --> 01:03:50,370
to Little Mermaids, and guess what?

565
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:52,151
I went to a fun rollercoaster.

566
01:03:54,173 --> 01:03:59,017
And I was almost gonna pass out, but it was still fun!

567
01:04:00,498 --> 01:04:01,859
It was really, really fun.

568
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:06,342
Okay, let's start.

569
01:04:07,903 --> 01:04:11,786
First, let's talk about the alphabet.

570
01:04:13,528 --> 01:04:15,049
Let's say the alphabet.

571
01:04:15,485 --> 01:04:17,447
Repeat after me.

572
01:04:21,310 --> 01:04:24,472
A, I mean, ah, music.

573
01:04:26,153 --> 01:04:36,401
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N,

574
01:04:46,025 --> 01:04:50,568
N. I was just being silly sometimes.

575
01:04:51,008 --> 01:04:51,349
Okay.

576
01:04:51,629 --> 01:04:57,573
N, O, T, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X,

577
01:05:14,602 --> 01:05:21,648
It was so fun, right?

578
01:05:23,029 --> 01:05:28,454
But let's see how many letters are there.

579
01:05:30,155 --> 01:05:31,316
Count with me.

580
01:05:35,079 --> 01:05:43,646
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

581
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:44,713
nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27.

582
01:05:48,574 --> 01:05:51,175
Oh, there's 27 letters.

583
01:06:13,412 --> 01:06:21,314
But now, let's say, let's do the English this time.

584
01:06:21,334 --> 01:06:21,314
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

585
01:06:47,073 --> 01:06:49,275
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, and 26.

586
01:06:49,315 --> 01:06:51,176
That's 26 letters.

587
01:06:51,456 --> 01:06:54,078
How does that even do that?

588
01:06:54,098 --> 01:06:58,701
27 letters here, 26 letters here.

589
01:06:59,342 --> 01:07:04,125
We could do more than that.

590
01:07:17,982 --> 01:07:18,382
26 is less than 27.

591
01:07:18,422 --> 01:07:19,603
27 is more than 26.

592
01:07:19,643 --> 01:07:22,264
Okay, let's do the vowels.

593
01:07:22,325 --> 01:07:22,845
Vocales.

594
01:07:50,536 --> 01:07:53,677
Okay, let's say the letters.

595
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:59,198
But this time it's gonna be a little different.

596
01:08:01,799 --> 01:08:10,221
A, E, I, O, U. Hmm.

597
01:08:12,342 --> 01:08:12,802
Hmm.

598
01:08:14,662 --> 01:08:16,883
Let's see, let's see.

599
01:08:18,437 --> 01:08:20,738
Where's the letters in this picture?

600
01:08:20,758 --> 01:08:23,258
Is it right here?

601
01:08:23,638 --> 01:08:24,198
No.

602
01:08:24,678 --> 01:08:25,659
Is it right here?

603
01:08:25,899 --> 01:08:26,379
No.

604
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:27,519
Is it right here?

605
01:08:28,839 --> 01:08:29,799
Yeah.

606
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:31,100
How?

607
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,440
This, this.

608
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,701
It is the letter A!

609
01:08:38,941 --> 01:08:39,161
Ah!

610
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:43,382
Let's spell it.

611
01:08:46,483 --> 01:08:46,783
But,

612
01:08:50,057 --> 01:08:52,538
See you next time.

613
01:08:52,558 --> 01:08:55,139
Okay, welcome to part two.

614
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:05,703
Okay, but this time we're gonna do the vowels, but with words.

615
01:09:07,063 --> 01:09:08,404
Palabras.

616
01:09:10,325 --> 01:09:16,607
E. E and the vowels.

617
01:09:17,867 --> 01:09:19,348
Okay, let's draw something.

618
01:09:20,687 --> 01:09:23,913
Okay, let's draw a eyeball.

619
01:09:23,933 --> 01:09:26,678
I know what it is!

620
01:09:51,168 --> 01:09:58,012
okay a star

621
01:10:23,189 --> 01:10:25,010
Isla.

622
01:10:29,653 --> 01:10:31,994
I know an island.

623
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:44,720
Sand.

624
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:47,382
This is the sand.

625
01:10:48,162 --> 01:10:49,763
And now the tree.

626
01:11:04,024 --> 01:11:07,807
Coconuts.

627
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:12,631
Coco, coco, coconuts, coconuts.

628
01:11:14,473 --> 01:11:15,474
Now last one.

629
01:11:17,896 --> 01:11:20,978
We got three right.

630
01:11:21,158 --> 01:11:21,739
Okay.

631
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:23,921
Also.

632
01:11:27,083 --> 01:11:27,684
I know!

633
01:11:27,904 --> 01:11:28,244
Bear.

634
01:11:34,602 --> 01:11:35,463
It's easy.

635
01:11:35,523 --> 01:11:37,924
Draw a circle.

636
01:11:39,265 --> 01:11:41,167
Two ears.

637
01:12:48,642 --> 01:12:49,283
Ostril.

638
01:12:52,405 --> 01:12:56,948
Uvas.

639
01:12:57,869 --> 01:13:07,637
Grapes, they're healthy for you.

640
01:13:08,477 --> 01:13:11,479
One, two, three, four,

641
01:13:20,882 --> 01:13:23,024
in the rain.

642
01:13:23,665 --> 01:13:26,247
I'm for trees.

01:13:58,066 --> 01:13:58,866
Last one.

647
01:14:00,427 --> 01:14:03,048
Uvas, grapes.
