9
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:15,944
[SPEAKER_14]: just to let folks know that we are gonna be talking exclusively about the zoning recommendations of the recodification.

10
00:01:16,004 --> 00:01:18,945
[SPEAKER_14]: We have attorney Mark Bobrowski here with us.

11
00:01:18,985 --> 00:01:32,632
[SPEAKER_14]: He's been working with the Medford city council and we've had a few meetings now where we're discussing this and working our way through some finalizing written recommendations back to the city council to consider on the zoning.

12
00:01:33,473 --> 00:01:37,779
[SPEAKER_14]: And because this is a recodification we're not we're not doing everything with zoning.

13
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:48,715
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are some things that are more policy oriented changes to the map things like that, that are really going to wait for the Medford comprehensive plan.

14
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:53,518
[SPEAKER_14]: to finish up, and then there may be some some things to consider at that time.

15
00:01:53,899 --> 00:02:03,365
[SPEAKER_14]: Really what we're trying to do here is modernize the city zoning and bring it into into line with existing practice.

16
00:02:03,425 --> 00:02:06,607
[SPEAKER_14]: Make it more understandable and friendly for everyone involved.

[SPEAKER_14]: So let me take

[SPEAKER_14]: Still muted, but I do see you're present.

30
00:03:07,244 --> 00:03:09,745
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, hopefully Amanda will be able to take care of that.

31
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry about that, Deanna, you should be able to unmute now.

32
00:03:13,365 --> 00:03:13,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, here.

33
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:16,808
[SPEAKER_09]: For some reason, it was not letting me.

38
00:03:29,516 --> 00:03:31,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Amanda, do you know if he's gonna join us?

39
00:03:36,121 --> 00:03:39,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me just check the meeting attendance.

40
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:48,312
[SPEAKER_09]: It does look like he did not respond to the meeting invite, so perhaps not.

41
00:03:48,492 --> 00:03:50,233
[SPEAKER_09]: I can message him separately.

42
00:03:50,253 --> 00:03:52,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thanks.

43
00:03:52,394 --> 00:03:54,534
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, let's get this is Jackie.

44
00:03:54,554 --> 00:03:57,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Just so I recall, Claes wasn't available this evening.

45
00:03:58,056 --> 00:03:58,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Jackie.

46
00:03:59,356 --> 00:03:59,896
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Jackie.

47
00:04:02,257 --> 00:04:02,577
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

48
00:04:02,597 --> 00:04:08,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's take a roll call vote to reopen the public hearing continued from January 5th.

49
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion on the floor?

50
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,631
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Dan.

51
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:15,391
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll make the motion.

52
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:16,372
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.

53
00:04:16,412 --> 00:04:16,973
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a second?

54
00:04:16,993 --> 00:04:17,974
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Jackie.

55
00:04:17,994 --> 00:04:18,975
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll second the motion.

56
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:20,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.

57
00:04:20,997 --> 00:04:21,597
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll call.

58
00:04:21,898 --> 00:04:22,478
[SPEAKER_14]: Christy Dowd.

59
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:27,823
[SPEAKER_14]: To open the meeting public hearing.

60
00:04:27,983 --> 00:04:28,244
Yes.

61
00:04:29,885 --> 00:04:30,546
[SPEAKER_14]: David Blumberg.

62
00:04:32,908 --> 00:04:33,569
[SPEAKER_14]: Deanna Peabody.

63
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:34,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

64
00:04:35,811 --> 00:04:36,612
[SPEAKER_14]: Jackie Furtado.

65
00:04:37,573 --> 00:04:37,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

66
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:39,811
[SPEAKER_14]: and Amini as well.

67
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:45,114
[SPEAKER_14]: The meeting is reopened from last week.

68
00:04:45,954 --> 00:04:49,615
[SPEAKER_14]: And let's jump into the document.

69
00:04:50,656 --> 00:04:55,978
[SPEAKER_14]: So last week, Amanda, we had you were able to share your screen and we were able to move things.

70
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:02,120
[SPEAKER_14]: And let's do that.

71
00:05:02,781 --> 00:05:08,403
[SPEAKER_14]: And maybe we could drop the link into the chat room for folks who are on the Zoom.

72
00:05:09,407 --> 00:05:10,428
[SPEAKER_14]: so they can follow along.

73
00:05:24,535 --> 00:05:32,959
[SPEAKER_14]: And last time we had just been talking about the noise standards, we're in the performance standards section of the zoning.

74
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,242
[SPEAKER_14]: I should also just note for everyone, both board members and members of the public that

75
00:05:39,575 --> 00:05:48,518
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to end tonight at 8pm and we're going to do our best to hopefully have this be our final meeting on the zoning recommendations.

76
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:52,380
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'll try to move things along as best as possible.

77
00:06:02,143 --> 00:06:02,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

78
00:06:06,444 --> 00:06:14,129
[SPEAKER_14]: We also had, I guess before we entered the transportation piece, let's just talk about a couple of things.

79
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:15,690
[SPEAKER_14]: One is this hours of operation.

80
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:22,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Amanda, I know that the city was looking into this, making sure it's consistent with other ordinances.

81
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:27,597
[SPEAKER_14]: Was there any conclusions on that or changes that are needed?

82
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:29,308
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Andre.

83
00:06:29,328 --> 00:06:31,790
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Alicia, the planning director.

84
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:40,834
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing that we thought would be particularly, so we did not think we should move the other, the other section about wholesale store hours.

85
00:06:41,494 --> 00:06:47,517
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a suggestion that we move it into this section, which is the performance review.

86
00:06:47,937 --> 00:06:49,698
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did not think we should do that.

87
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:55,901
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another section in the ordinances that is completely outside of zoning chapter 38, section 34.

88
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:09,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so the other, so the, the recommendation for that piece is to put a reference in, um, that, you know, this is not in, uh,

89
00:07:13,848 --> 00:07:22,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I didn't come up with the right language, but this does not negate that other section, that the other section exists and it should be referenced.

90
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:28,739
[SPEAKER_01]: And that the one about wholesale store hours, we should, again, reference.

91
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:41,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Our concern was that somebody might search for operating hours and find just one section without the others and not be aware that there are other sections that talk about noise hours.

92
00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:47,315
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't seem completely appropriate to merge all into one.

93
00:07:48,477 --> 00:07:48,737
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

94
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:55,466
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think there was the question was that, you know, construction in particular generally starts at 7am and here we have it at 8am.

95
00:07:58,117 --> 00:08:10,274
[SPEAKER_01]: So my understanding is what that this along with a number of other things that came from attorney burrows key were placeholders that we should customize to be appropriate to the city of Medford's operating procedures.

96
00:08:13,438 --> 00:08:16,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if these hours should be 7 a.m.

97
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:22,505
[SPEAKER_01]: to 7 p.m., if they should, these replaceholders and the board should come up with what would be more appropriate.

98
00:08:22,966 --> 00:08:29,851
[SPEAKER_01]: In the comments, I have shared that wholesale store hours are, by right, 7 a.m.

99
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:36,617
[SPEAKER_01]: to 11 p.m., and that excessive noise is regulated in the city generally

100
00:08:37,305 --> 00:08:40,049
[SPEAKER_01]: after 6 p.m., but before 7 a.m.

101
00:08:40,369 --> 00:08:43,654
[SPEAKER_01]: So my recommendation would be the earlier hours should be 7 a.m.

102
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:44,155
[SPEAKER_01]: on here.

103
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:50,283
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe there should be some language about the board

104
00:08:55,768 --> 00:09:06,536
[SPEAKER_01]: the board could adjust as appropriate for each location because it might in our industrial locations be okay to have much wider hours.

105
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:11,640
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a single family home district, we might actually prefer shorter hours.

106
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:18,865
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Attorney Bobrowski, any thoughts on this?

107
00:09:19,085 --> 00:09:22,167
[SPEAKER_14]: Would it be easier if we just cited the

108
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:38,832
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, Medford, uh, you know, noise, general noise ordinance, and then said something about, uh, the SPGA or community development board being able to, uh, adjust if necessary for special circumstances.

109
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:48,180
[SPEAKER_04]: I think with regard to particular uses, it's okay or wise to list the use and the hours.

110
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise I think a general

111
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,921
[SPEAKER_04]: empowerment to impose hours of operation should just be stated.

112
00:09:57,322 --> 00:10:01,763
[SPEAKER_04]: And if there already are some in the general ordinances, then that should certainly be referenced.

113
00:10:05,044 --> 00:10:17,648
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're going to treat wholesale operations differently, and I can't remember what 7.2 said, but I think there was a call out there that the hours of operation for one or two specific uses shall be, you know, that's,

114
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:23,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I kept that where it is because it's a regulation that's special in nature that just applies to those businesses.

115
00:10:25,944 --> 00:10:30,927
[SPEAKER_04]: This is general performance standards you're looking at here that apply to all businesses.

116
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:39,133
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would just say, you know, the board may set hours of operation and we refer you to general ordinance chapter verse.

117
00:10:40,294 --> 00:10:41,555
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think that makes sense.

118
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:47,079
[SPEAKER_14]: Any board members have thoughts or comments about this?

119
00:10:52,779 --> 00:11:07,045
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, and I didn't reiterate at the beginning of this meeting but again for efficiency sake with the members of the public who want to weigh in about different issues, we're going to take it section by section, we'll hear from

120
00:11:07,987 --> 00:11:22,816
[SPEAKER_14]: know, the city attorney Bobrowski, members of the board will weigh in, and then we'll open it after each section for questions and comments that haven't been resolved yet.

121
00:11:23,797 --> 00:11:28,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Or even if they have been resolved, you're welcome to weigh in and express your concern.

122
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:40,825
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, I don't hear any members of the board chiming in, so let's continue.

123
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:59,774
[SPEAKER_14]: One other thing, I guess, before we move into the traffic piece, there was a question last week about video signage, and I think we have the Chamber of Commerce, Steve Pompeo is here representing them.

124
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:18,202
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we wanted to get some feedback from them about the video signage, and I believe the way it was left was that attorney Bobrovsky you're going to look at other examples and I don't know if you have any of that information right now or, or not.

125
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:23,664
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's been a busy week and that's not something that made it onto my front burner I apologize for that.

126
00:12:26,325 --> 00:12:27,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, let me invite Mr. Pompeo.

127
00:12:27,987 --> 00:12:32,812
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there anything further that you'd like to say on that issue right now?

128
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:46,566
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if, Amanda, you are able to... Sorry, I need to... I'm going to stop the share for a moment.

129
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, can you hear me now?

130
00:12:57,302 --> 00:12:58,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, thank you.

131
00:12:59,183 --> 00:13:00,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah, thank you.

132
00:13:00,344 --> 00:13:02,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Steven Pompeo, 18 Newton Road, Medford.

133
00:13:03,087 --> 00:13:04,027
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's fine.

134
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:13,275
[SPEAKER_02]: We can wait for the attorney to get that information to us at any point and put something together and weigh in then, if that's okay.

135
00:13:14,788 --> 00:13:26,592
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, if we do finalize the rest of our recommendations tonight, there'll still be time to maybe submit the wording that you recommend directly to the city council.

136
00:13:26,753 --> 00:13:28,333
[SPEAKER_14]: Would that be amenable?

137
00:13:29,313 --> 00:13:31,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was gonna ask if that's a problem.

138
00:13:31,454 --> 00:13:39,477
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys wrap up, is it okay if we address that with the city council or should we try to address it now?

139
00:13:39,497 --> 00:13:43,719
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's fine just to bring it to the city council directly.

140
00:13:46,845 --> 00:13:47,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's fine then.

141
00:13:47,805 --> 00:13:48,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we can.

142
00:13:48,866 --> 00:13:49,206
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

143
00:13:49,966 --> 00:14:01,411
[SPEAKER_14]: And I mean, it might be helpful if you, you know, kind of sense your feedback to Planning Development and Sustainability Office and see if they have tried to get on the same page with them.

144
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:07,794
[SPEAKER_14]: And then if you can get them on board at the city council level, they can, you know, endorse it, hopefully.

145
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:09,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that would be good.

146
00:14:10,035 --> 00:14:16,598
[SPEAKER_02]: And whatever Attorney Bobrowski can get us will definitely be helpful because all we put together before was,

147
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,100
[SPEAKER_02]: This was two years ago.

148
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:33,403
[SPEAKER_02]: We just put together a, um, more of a more, I guess you could have called it a moratorium because there was no language about video signs and wasn't ready to stop making major changes to the ordinance at that time.

149
00:14:33,423 --> 00:14:39,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we, what we had drafted was really more of a prohibition until, until this time.

150
00:14:39,684 --> 00:14:42,304
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't, we don't have specific full language.

151
00:14:42,344 --> 00:14:45,945
[SPEAKER_02]: So if he could, whatever he could get us, we could, that could help us compile something.

152
00:14:47,802 --> 00:14:51,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Chairman, I'll put together a minimum of three examples.

153
00:14:52,486 --> 00:14:59,372
[SPEAKER_04]: And given the fact that the Patriots are very likely to win easily up in Buffalo, I'll probably have it ready right after the game.

154
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:06,118
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Chair, may I ask Mr. Pompeo one question about this?

155
00:15:06,378 --> 00:15:13,259
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a section in the ordinance that says that moving signs are not allowed.

156
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:14,839
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that's the language.

157
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,160
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just sort of searching for the language on my computer.

158
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:32,323
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wasn't clear why that didn't cover video or if that is in fact what he is referring to as the moratorium that they thought was attempt, that they didn't intend for the moving signs language to stay there.

159
00:15:34,804 --> 00:15:35,785
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's a good question.

160
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:41,348
[SPEAKER_02]: And we may not even have been interpreting it correctly at the time, and maybe the city council wasn't either.

161
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:54,555
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed like when moving was put in there back in the day, that applied to mechanically moving signs as opposed to electronically moving videos on the signs.

162
00:15:55,336 --> 00:15:58,758
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not looking to make a prohibition of video signs.

163
00:15:59,518 --> 00:16:00,899
[SPEAKER_02]: That was just a temporary fix.

164
00:16:01,984 --> 00:16:07,049
[SPEAKER_02]: We just wanna make sure that they're in the proper zones, they're not in residential zones, that type of thing.

165
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:12,854
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the board here felt that that covered it, then that may be sufficient.

166
00:16:14,236 --> 00:16:21,342
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually I appreciate that because I was under the impression that the chamber was looking for an additional moratorium.

167
00:16:21,382 --> 00:16:25,146
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just asking for some level of regulation and appropriateness, not moratorium.

168
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,407
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really helpful to understand.

169
00:16:27,326 --> 00:16:36,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yeah, and we thought maybe it would be helpful to have video display as a modern definition, as opposed to just moving, to help it be clearer.

170
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,791
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you say, moving is not allowed.

171
00:16:37,991 --> 00:16:39,172
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not allowed at all.

172
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:44,995
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe video signs should be allowed in some places, some areas, and also maybe based on certain sizes.

173
00:16:45,475 --> 00:16:55,560
[SPEAKER_02]: So for instance, in a C1 district, like a neighborhood square, like West Medford, maybe you wouldn't allow large video signs on a store as its main sign.

174
00:16:56,368 --> 00:17:01,712
[SPEAKER_02]: but a restaurant might be able to have a small video sign in their window displaying their menu, for instance.

175
00:17:03,934 --> 00:17:04,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

176
00:17:06,616 --> 00:17:20,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, well, let's leave it at, we'll have Attorney Bobrowski will send along some examples, and then I think you can decide whether we need to have additional consideration from the council on it.

177
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:23,929
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks a lot.

178
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:25,690
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, yeah, thank you, Mr. Pompeo.

179
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:30,382
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's move into the traffic management standards.

180
00:17:33,204 --> 00:17:41,168
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have a couple of, I think there's some technical language improvements.

181
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,531
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you scroll down some more, Amanda?

182
00:17:49,533 --> 00:17:52,675
[SPEAKER_14]: There's some desire to, I think,

183
00:17:53,695 --> 00:18:07,642
[SPEAKER_14]: adjust the language everywhere possible to make sure that we're accommodating pedestrians, bicycles, and public transit, and not just thinking about cars when we talk about traffic and transportation.

184
00:18:08,982 --> 00:18:22,329
[SPEAKER_14]: And then in this transportation plan approval section, there is a significant number of modifications that have been suggested to

185
00:18:24,877 --> 00:18:25,438
[SPEAKER_14]: a few things.

186
00:18:25,698 --> 00:18:34,942
[SPEAKER_14]: One is include in the site plan for developments, the coordination of delivery vehicles, parcels, waste removal and ride services, just to be explicit about that.

187
00:18:35,262 --> 00:18:40,345
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's not just about, you know, driveways in and out of traffic.

188
00:18:41,885 --> 00:18:51,670
[SPEAKER_10]: One second, Amanda, there was a comment up there from Amy, I think that said, I don't know what traffic management, there was one, I think up a little more.

189
00:18:52,876 --> 00:18:54,177
[SPEAKER_10]: at the beginning of the section.

190
00:18:54,197 --> 00:18:59,761
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, traffic management.

191
00:18:59,961 --> 00:19:01,602
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called traffic control devices.

192
00:19:09,587 --> 00:19:10,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Deanna.

193
00:19:20,173 --> 00:19:30,467
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I don't know, Amanda, was the traffic office able to review this language around the transportation plans to see if that worked for them?

194
00:19:31,108 --> 00:19:42,154
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was able to talk to transportation planner, Amy Ingalls, a little bit about section five, or sorry, this number five here, transportation plan approval.

195
00:19:43,614 --> 00:19:52,139
[SPEAKER_09]: And she, in general, agreed with the content that was in there, but felt that there were opportunities to kind of tighten up the language a little bit.

196
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,723
[SPEAKER_09]: That there might be some redundancy.

197
00:19:58,284 --> 00:20:09,719
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, we were considering if, if the, the general idea behind this was the board was in favor of that potentially.

198
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:28,570
[SPEAKER_09]: the planning office and the engineering office, if this were voted through, could just administratively kind of tighten up the language without removing any of the substantive piece of it and, you know, be able to polish off that recommendation.

199
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:31,632
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I think that's fine for me.

200
00:20:33,695 --> 00:20:38,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there was also a note from Director Blake that just came in around five.

201
00:20:39,056 --> 00:20:42,597
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't had a chance yet to thoroughly review it.

202
00:20:42,717 --> 00:20:44,378
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Vic's gonna take a look at it.

203
00:20:46,939 --> 00:20:52,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Or I could read it to the board now or at some point.

204
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:54,761
[SPEAKER_14]: How long is it?

205
00:20:57,121 --> 00:21:03,003
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a couple paragraphs of text.

206
00:21:04,948 --> 00:21:07,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me see.

207
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:15,376
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, if you're OK with reading it, that would be fine, unless you or Victor want to highlight specific aspects of it.

208
00:21:16,016 --> 00:21:16,316
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

209
00:21:17,717 --> 00:21:19,338
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just read through if people don't mind.

210
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:23,481
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

211
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,804
[SPEAKER_09]: So he wanted to communicate some additional info.

212
00:21:27,044 --> 00:21:30,386
[SPEAKER_09]: The edits are good, but can likely be pared down even more.

213
00:21:30,907 --> 00:21:32,608
[SPEAKER_09]: For instance, a transportation

214
00:21:34,157 --> 00:21:39,000
[SPEAKER_09]: info submitted is not typically referred to as a transportation plan.

215
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:48,005
[SPEAKER_09]: The set of drawings required by building and engineering would typically include a traffic and parking plan sheet indicating parking, site circulation, etc.

216
00:21:48,726 --> 00:21:56,310
[SPEAKER_09]: The traffic study or traffic memo is other traffic info required but not necessarily referred to as part of the transportation plan.

217
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:03,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, a traffic management plan typically refers to the management of traffic during construction.

218
00:22:03,797 --> 00:22:11,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Traffic demand management typically refers to transportation policies or practices that can contribute to reducing vehicle trips.

219
00:22:12,425 --> 00:22:13,947
[SPEAKER_09]: My recommended thresholds.

220
00:22:15,188 --> 00:22:18,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and I think this covers slightly different topic.

221
00:22:20,699 --> 00:22:30,785
[SPEAKER_09]: My recommended thresholds would be any commercial space over X amount of square feet or any residential over Y number of units requires a traffic memo.

222
00:22:30,805 --> 00:22:32,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kidding.

223
00:22:33,087 --> 00:22:41,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Any commercial space over a certain amount of square feet or any residential over a certain number of units requires a traffic study.

224
00:22:41,931 --> 00:22:54,961
[SPEAKER_09]: both the traffic study and traffic memo should include or follow industry standard practices by ITE, such as transportation, oh, I just got another email from him, sorry.

225
00:23:04,209 --> 00:23:16,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Both the traffic study and traffic memo should include or follow industry standard practices by ITE, such as transportation impact analyses for site development recommended practice, or the new multimodal

226
00:23:17,203 --> 00:23:21,164
[SPEAKER_09]: transportation impact analysis for site development recommended practice.

227
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:31,868
[SPEAKER_09]: The specific scope and level of effort for either a traffic memo or traffic study is to be determined after consulting with the director of traffic and transportation.

228
00:23:32,528 --> 00:23:38,790
[SPEAKER_09]: In general, the memo or study should follow the practices mentioned above, with the traffic memo requiring less information.

229
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,731
[SPEAKER_09]: For instance, a traffic memo may not include

230
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:47,433
[SPEAKER_09]: traffic analysis, but should include trip generation estimates and existing traffic count data.

231
00:23:48,033 --> 00:23:57,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Examples are traffic memos that were required for some 10 plus or minus unit redevelopment versus, say, a 300 plus redevelopment.

232
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:00,880
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was everything.

233
00:24:03,862 --> 00:24:12,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, and I can post that in the meeting materials so that people, the board can refer to the written text, because I know I'm a visual person.

234
00:24:15,131 --> 00:24:16,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Andre, this is Jackie.

235
00:24:18,393 --> 00:24:21,155
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a comment on this entire section.

236
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:29,862
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things that I'm noticing is that, which would become a semantics to the board, right, is actual

237
00:24:30,382 --> 00:24:41,987
[SPEAKER_08]: there's differences in these plans and these traffic analysis and it's basically to evaluate whether the development is appropriate for a site and what type of transportation approvals may be necessary in order to maintain a satisfactory level of service, right?

238
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:51,211
[SPEAKER_08]: And then in addition, we're looking at appropriate mixes of transportation modes, including adding public transit, bicycles, pedestrian, so forth, so on, which is out of the scope of the board.

239
00:24:51,311 --> 00:24:59,295
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel as though it was already recommended that it should probably stick to the transportation department as cleaning up this language for us so that we can be

240
00:24:59,783 --> 00:25:02,904
[SPEAKER_08]: better prepared to look at it in site plan review.

241
00:25:03,864 --> 00:25:12,805
[SPEAKER_08]: I can appreciate all of these changes and things like that, but I just think it's out of the scope and the purview of the city board at this point.

242
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:23,427
[SPEAKER_14]: So your recommendation is to take this language out or to- No, no.

243
00:25:24,007 --> 00:25:26,828
[SPEAKER_08]: If we're gonna clean it, no, no, definitely keep it here, but because it's out of the

244
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:33,656
[SPEAKER_08]: somewhat out of our purview, but to be changing it, it should definitely be led by the traffic department is what I'm saying.

245
00:25:34,336 --> 00:25:37,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, changes as originally proposed at the beginning.

246
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:39,679
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

247
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,621
[SPEAKER_14]: That seems that seems to make sense to me.

248
00:25:43,641 --> 00:25:49,325
[SPEAKER_14]: Amanda, could you just scroll down a little bit more so we can see what's under a B.

249
00:25:58,207 --> 00:25:59,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Just go up a tiny bit more.

250
00:25:59,608 --> 00:25:59,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

251
00:26:07,951 --> 00:26:19,436
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think I mean, I think the general idea here is, you know, this is to require a site plan is to have a traffic study.

252
00:26:20,651 --> 00:26:43,981
[SPEAKER_14]: to encourage transportation demand management and make sure that projects do that, take that into account, just multimodal considerations that they propose mitigation and that major projects have kind of a higher level of responsibility for this.

253
00:26:44,661 --> 00:26:47,883
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think, and then I know there's some examples under D,

254
00:26:48,687 --> 00:26:49,787
[SPEAKER_14]: of like, you know, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

255
00:26:52,128 --> 00:26:56,810
[SPEAKER_14]: So do members have any, are we fine with this?

256
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:13,635
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm fine with what is here and then tasking the transportation planner with the planning office to, you know, to tighten the language up more, but not to make, you know, changes in the,

257
00:27:15,068 --> 00:27:17,308
[SPEAKER_14]: of the substance of what's here.

258
00:27:17,468 --> 00:27:20,789
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it was all pretty like standard and what you usually see.

259
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:33,411
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like those thresholds of when, you know, like where the number 25,000 square feet is what triggers needing to do a full traffic study, like where that came from.

260
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:42,233
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it's appropriate for Medford, I think, you know, yeah, the traffic department could probably decide what those thresholds are for requiring the full study.

261
00:27:42,947 --> 00:27:46,029
[SPEAKER_10]: versus the memo or what Todd was talking about.

262
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,312
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's exactly what I was referring to, Deanna.

263
00:27:49,352 --> 00:27:51,314
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just cleaning it up.

264
00:27:51,734 --> 00:28:00,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Leave the language as is, but as far as where are we getting these numbers from, if they can just expound on that and clean it up for us.

265
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,662
[SPEAKER_10]: 25,000 square feet is a pretty big development.

266
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:05,445
[SPEAKER_10]: There could be something much smaller that generates a lot of traffic.

267
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:12,110
[SPEAKER_10]: So I had suggested maybe putting in a number of trips in the peak hour as well.

268
00:28:12,747 --> 00:28:16,430
[SPEAKER_10]: so that we get those smaller developments that generate a lot of traffic.

269
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:20,754
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't know what thresholds they want to use.

270
00:28:21,594 --> 00:28:24,677
[SPEAKER_08]: How would we even determine VMTs though?

271
00:28:25,298 --> 00:28:29,021
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all based on that ITE trip generation.

272
00:28:29,621 --> 00:28:40,070
[SPEAKER_10]: So you could say if a development will make 50 trips in the peak hour, then they should do a traffic study.

273
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,360
[SPEAKER_10]: or something like that.

274
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:47,242
[SPEAKER_10]: But those numbers, I think it is best for probably for the transportation department to decide on.

275
00:28:47,783 --> 00:28:47,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

276
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,384
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's basically what I meant by audit of purview with the numbers.

277
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:57,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Because 25,000 square feet is a big development.

278
00:28:57,966 --> 00:29:01,968
[SPEAKER_10]: We've gotten plenty of traffic studies in the past with developments smaller than that.

279
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:03,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

280
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:05,569
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't.

281
00:29:05,589 --> 00:29:09,851
[SPEAKER_10]: People were, last week we were talking about requiring a traffic study for

282
00:29:10,568 --> 00:29:15,911
[SPEAKER_10]: like a 10 child daycare, like that definitely wouldn't be required with these numbers.

283
00:29:16,191 --> 00:29:21,795
[SPEAKER_10]: So it kind of isn't jiving with what we have talked about for other things.

284
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:22,095
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

285
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:23,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

286
00:29:23,536 --> 00:29:25,757
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, can you just scroll up a little bit, Amanda?

287
00:29:25,777 --> 00:29:30,199
[SPEAKER_14]: Because, right, I think there's some confusion about what is being asked for.

288
00:29:30,219 --> 00:29:33,441
[SPEAKER_14]: This is why maybe we, you know, the language can be clarified a little bit.

289
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:39,465
[SPEAKER_14]: So the traffic impact and assessment study is B. And

290
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:48,324
[SPEAKER_14]: It seems like every project that comes before the board, it almost seems like is required to do that.

291
00:29:48,725 --> 00:29:58,390
[SPEAKER_14]: And then it says for proposed development in excess of 25,000 gross square feet, it has to meet a higher standard and provide more information.

292
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:01,552
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how I'm reading how it's written here.

293
00:30:01,572 --> 00:30:09,337
[SPEAKER_10]: I read it as like you only have to do the, because the traffic impact and assessment is the IT,

294
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,521
[SPEAKER_10]: standard.

295
00:30:11,621 --> 00:30:16,364
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I read it as you didn't even have to do anything unless it was 25,000 square feet.

296
00:30:16,404 --> 00:30:16,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Got it.

297
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:20,868
[SPEAKER_08]: And based on what Amanda just, sorry.

298
00:30:21,849 --> 00:30:23,690
[SPEAKER_08]: No, go ahead.

299
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:29,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Based on the information, the memo that Amanda just read, it's not, the semantics are off for me.

300
00:30:29,655 --> 00:30:37,581
[SPEAKER_08]: To me, the difference between a traffic impact assessment and then a TDM, I'm, I'm just, it's just not clean for me.

301
00:30:37,621 --> 00:30:38,722
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not flowing for me.

302
00:30:38,822 --> 00:30:38,942
[SPEAKER_08]: So,

303
00:30:39,787 --> 00:30:44,010
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think that it needs to be clearer and flowing.

304
00:30:44,731 --> 00:31:05,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I think what the traffic engineer was suggesting is that, you know, projects, all projects are required right now, it seems to me, to create a traffic impact memo and then only some projects maybe do

305
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:06,849
[SPEAKER_14]: have a bigger study.

306
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:27,239
[SPEAKER_14]: So why don't we let them, I guess, yeah, let's let them figure out how to align it with what their practice is currently and, and then just, I think we can, we can leave that kind of TBD in terms of language.

307
00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:28,399
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.

308
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:31,481
[SPEAKER_10]: We usually do get a memo, like a smaller version.

309
00:31:31,521 --> 00:31:34,542
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if that's laid out anywhere specifically, or if that's

310
00:31:35,522 --> 00:31:41,546
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, if like Todd talks to the development developers beforehand, and that's why that's what we usually get.

311
00:31:41,686 --> 00:31:47,990
[SPEAKER_10]: But you're right, we usually do see a memo for most and not the full blown.

312
00:31:49,551 --> 00:31:49,771
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

313
00:31:50,671 --> 00:31:50,892
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

314
00:31:52,252 --> 00:31:55,154
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, yeah, I do think this language needs to be cleaned up a little bit.

315
00:31:55,254 --> 00:32:01,838
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's, but I think we've made clear what we're hoping for.

316
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

317
00:32:05,275 --> 00:32:06,838
[SPEAKER_14]: Other board members want to weigh in on this.

318
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:08,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Andre David.

319
00:32:09,121 --> 00:32:09,602
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, David.

320
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:14,791
[SPEAKER_03]: What's, what's your vision for tonight.

321
00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:21,441
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can articulate that a little bit more, I know you'd like to go through all the materials so that we have a discussion about everything.

322
00:32:22,121 --> 00:32:29,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder, will a revised sort of final version then have to come back to us for kind of an ultimate vote?

323
00:32:29,424 --> 00:32:35,126
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that were the case, maybe this is a section that could be looked at and approved at that time.

324
00:32:36,647 --> 00:32:42,929
[SPEAKER_14]: So in order to do that, I was talking to the city staff earlier today.

325
00:32:44,335 --> 00:33:11,192
[SPEAKER_14]: I think what we'd like to do is have all of our recommendations and directives finalized tonight, and then if you're willing, empower me to review any final language with the city staff that we direct them to improve to make sure that it aligns with what the board had

326
00:33:11,773 --> 00:33:17,856
[SPEAKER_14]: had weighed in on so that we don't have to have a separate meeting and come back and vote separately on it.

327
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:21,157
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's up to the will of the board.

328
00:33:21,177 --> 00:33:29,100
[SPEAKER_14]: If you wanna see the whole thing all together, we can do that, but we don't have another meeting set up at the moment.

329
00:33:30,301 --> 00:33:39,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, personally, I'd be comfortable with that, but I can't say that I know very much about the formalities of our approval and whether that's sufficient or not.

330
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:50,528
[SPEAKER_03]: as part of the process that we have along with the city council's decision making and approval process.

331
00:33:52,509 --> 00:33:53,709
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's okay with me, it's okay.

332
00:33:53,749 --> 00:33:57,250
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know, maybe Attorney Barabosky would know better if that's a problem.

333
00:34:01,051 --> 00:34:07,852
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to, the role of the board going forward would be both political and legal.

334
00:34:08,052 --> 00:34:10,593
[SPEAKER_04]: So legally the planning of the CDB

335
00:34:11,491 --> 00:34:16,132
[SPEAKER_04]: which serves as the planning board is responsible for making a recommendation to the city council.

336
00:34:17,793 --> 00:34:25,154
[SPEAKER_04]: That city council, that recommendation is due relatively soon after the public hearing that we're in tonight is closed finally.

337
00:34:25,995 --> 00:34:30,676
[SPEAKER_04]: The recommendation has within it the authority to make certain changes.

338
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:37,978
[SPEAKER_04]: After all the purpose of a public hearing is to hear from the public and to make recommended changes.

339
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:39,458
[SPEAKER_04]: The changes have to stay

340
00:34:40,063 --> 00:34:42,964
[SPEAKER_04]: within what was advertised for the planning board public hearing.

341
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:47,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's call it the four corners of the advertisement.

342
00:34:47,364 --> 00:34:52,385
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can't wholly invent something that wasn't even discussed and added to the recommendations.

343
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,045
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to be related to.

344
00:34:54,065 --> 00:34:58,806
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that goes to the city council for a formal vote.

345
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:04,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the city council was the drafter of the article as it came to you.

346
00:35:05,707 --> 00:35:08,988
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're entitled to do what they will do in their legislative role.

347
00:35:09,978 --> 00:35:11,179
[SPEAKER_04]: once it comes back to them.

348
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:19,204
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're free to recommend, your recommendations can include changes and the city council can include or reject those changes.

349
00:35:23,307 --> 00:35:33,675
[SPEAKER_14]: So David, it sounds like since, you know, these are recommendations and we do have a public record of the board's opinion about this issue.

350
00:35:33,975 --> 00:35:38,398
[SPEAKER_14]: And when we open to the public, the public will also be able to weigh in on it then.

351
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:45,331
[SPEAKER_14]: we can ensure that our, you know, the final language recommendation aligns with that.

352
00:35:45,392 --> 00:35:52,457
[SPEAKER_14]: And I feel like that is enough that we need to do to make sure that it's consistent.

353
00:35:54,939 --> 00:35:55,839
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds good to me.

354
00:35:56,259 --> 00:35:58,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank everyone for airing that out.

355
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I think it's worth talking about.

356
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:00,523
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

357
00:36:00,643 --> 00:36:00,923
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

358
00:36:05,192 --> 00:36:16,598
[SPEAKER_14]: Other board members who would like to weigh in on the traffic performance standards and I don't know if Amanda if you can keep scrolling down and make sure we're not anything else here.

359
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:21,600
[SPEAKER_14]: Transportation demand management plan.

360
00:36:23,457 --> 00:36:24,538
[SPEAKER_14]: Mitigation measures.

361
00:36:25,078 --> 00:36:31,003
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think there's some a little bit of consolidation needs to happen because there's like TDM is referred to in a couple of these different subsections.

362
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:36,747
[SPEAKER_14]: If we could put that together, that would integrate it would make sense, I think.

363
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:50,417
[SPEAKER_14]: These seven items are examples of what could be in a transportation demand management plan required of a developer.

364
00:36:51,965 --> 00:36:52,966
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really illustrative.

365
00:36:53,006 --> 00:36:54,667
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not requiring all of these.

366
00:36:54,827 --> 00:37:06,475
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just creating illustrations of, you know, depending on the project that the board could require and negotiate with the developer.

367
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:21,763
[SPEAKER_14]: And then this last piece here, well, reduction in parking, we talked a little bit about that last time.

368
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:29,429
[SPEAKER_14]: The Special Permit Granting Authority, SPGA, that's what that term means for those who are not familiar with it.

369
00:37:31,331 --> 00:37:38,256
[SPEAKER_14]: There's some discretion that the board has, but needs to be justified.

370
00:37:41,419 --> 00:37:46,201
[SPEAKER_14]: this subsection seven here, level of service maintenance or improvement.

371
00:37:47,001 --> 00:37:58,526
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some comments about level of service being an outdated, perhaps metric for us to be using here in Medford.

372
00:37:59,306 --> 00:38:09,530
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I think the thought here is to take this language out so that we can really focus on the, you know,

373
00:38:10,433 --> 00:38:20,458
[SPEAKER_14]: evaluate the intersection and traffic impacts independent of this metric and, you know, require mitigation as appropriate.

374
00:38:21,959 --> 00:38:28,603
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, focus on reducing trips, vehicles, mile travel, vehicle miles traveled.

375
00:38:30,003 --> 00:38:34,926
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and I think the city, the traffic engineer was also expressed concern about this.

376
00:38:47,238 --> 00:38:53,226
[SPEAKER_14]: have more specific language from the city transportation planner, and a couple of different places.

377
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:59,935
[SPEAKER_14]: We took out reference to the road widening really don't want to encourage road widening.

378
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,537
[SPEAKER_14]: So it was actually, Amanda, can you go back up there?

379
00:39:12,657 --> 00:39:19,602
[SPEAKER_14]: Was that cross out there, road and intersection widening, that was a suggestion from the transportation planner?

380
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:25,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I'm sorry, I forgot to annotate that.

381
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:36,073
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to say,

382
00:39:39,895 --> 00:39:44,376
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there might be cases where we do want to add like a left turn lane or a right turn lane or something.

383
00:39:45,176 --> 00:39:45,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

384
00:39:46,456 --> 00:39:50,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially into a development, but I don't know.

385
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:57,979
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess it is changing a little bit with level of service, but I feel like I probably compute level of service on a daily basis.

386
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:00,160
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's still used a lot.

387
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

388
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,541
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if it's completely irrelevant, but.

389
00:40:07,621 --> 00:40:19,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I think that at least, I don't know, Deanna, what you think about this, but I think that there's a lot of intersections that are already failing and then to require a developer to fix that.

390
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:30,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Not fix it completely, but try to bring it closely close to what it was before by with through mitigation.

391
00:40:32,785 --> 00:40:33,446
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a question.

392
00:40:33,466 --> 00:40:44,157
[SPEAKER_10]: What if it asks that they should bring it to an A, but if it's a E and they're going to F, try to bring it back to an E type of thing.

393
00:40:46,379 --> 00:40:49,222
[SPEAKER_14]: Christy, I... Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

394
00:40:49,723 --> 00:40:51,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I just had a question on the road widening.

395
00:40:51,745 --> 00:40:54,348
[SPEAKER_07]: What if a development is proposing

396
00:40:55,387 --> 00:41:08,650
[SPEAKER_07]: to widen the road for whatever needs to happen for their development, was the intent of this section to also say, like, if that was to be approved, then here are standards that we want to make sure are incorporated?

397
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,870
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a different perspective.

398
00:41:15,991 --> 00:41:17,091
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, who was speaking?

399
00:41:17,531 --> 00:41:20,972
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I was just saying there are times when a development would definitely want to.

400
00:41:23,027 --> 00:41:26,830
[SPEAKER_10]: wide in a road so that people can get in and out of their development.

401
00:41:27,711 --> 00:41:29,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Whether we should let them is, yeah.

402
00:41:30,413 --> 00:41:30,633
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

403
00:41:30,674 --> 00:41:41,803
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be, I think it's on a case-by-case basis, but I do think the language down there, if you can go down a little bit more, Amanda, to see.

404
00:41:43,144 --> 00:41:45,126
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, what's, can you go back up?

405
00:41:45,186 --> 00:41:45,606
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

406
00:41:46,126 --> 00:41:46,487
[SPEAKER_14]: A little bit.

407
00:41:46,547 --> 00:41:47,828
[SPEAKER_14]: Pedestrian and bicycle safety.

408
00:41:47,848 --> 00:41:48,589
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

409
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:51,111
[SPEAKER_14]: So

410
00:41:52,559 --> 00:42:02,283
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I do think we should at least keep in any road modifications into that C, subsection C. So all new traffic signals.

411
00:42:03,444 --> 00:42:04,204
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, maybe that's a good term.

412
00:42:04,224 --> 00:42:05,284
[SPEAKER_14]: Modification of roadways.

413
00:42:05,304 --> 00:42:06,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Modification, yeah.

414
00:42:08,686 --> 00:42:15,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, just take out the widening and just say road intersection travels and traffic signal modification.

415
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:21,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, could you repeat that one more time?

416
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:36,082
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, all new traffic signals or modification of existing traffic signals, comma, and modification of roadway modifications.

417
00:42:37,443 --> 00:42:40,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Or roadway geometry, yeah.

418
00:42:54,929 --> 00:42:56,070
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think that makes sense.

419
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, this is all under pedestrian and bicycle.

420
00:42:58,852 --> 00:42:59,452
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't realize.

421
00:42:59,513 --> 00:42:59,673
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

422
00:43:00,273 --> 00:43:00,914
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

423
00:43:03,015 --> 00:43:09,180
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably the same type of language is probably somewhere else than to not under bicycle and pedestrian.

424
00:43:25,941 --> 00:43:27,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

425
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:38,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Location of parking areas.

426
00:43:52,807 --> 00:43:53,547
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Jackie.

427
00:43:53,607 --> 00:43:59,250
[SPEAKER_08]: I have an unpopular question, and that goes back to the mitigation and what Christy had asked about the widening.

428
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:21,240
[SPEAKER_08]: As I understand it, one of the things about the intersection widening, actually, we're trying to, and as Deanna has already pointed out, if a developer was going to do mitigation or their development was going to add to the traffic congestion or add to the level of service and make it worse in an area, they would at least, if it was a D, they would bring it to a C or if it was an

429
00:44:21,871 --> 00:44:23,672
[SPEAKER_08]: or they would bring it back to a diesel for so on.

430
00:44:24,192 --> 00:44:30,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Widening is usually not considered a mitigation for traffic congestion.

431
00:44:30,155 --> 00:44:31,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that correct?

432
00:44:31,956 --> 00:44:34,758
[SPEAKER_08]: That adds to, it just creates more vehicles.

433
00:44:36,598 --> 00:44:44,562
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just wanted to make sure that we were on the same page with intersection widening in that particular instance, that that's probably why we took that out.

434
00:44:47,684 --> 00:44:49,625
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I see a lot of times where

435
00:44:50,531 --> 00:45:01,053
[SPEAKER_10]: we widen, we don't widen the road, but widen at the signal to add lanes, like turn lanes to take them out of like the through movements so that they can queue, the vehicles can queue up.

436
00:45:03,373 --> 00:45:06,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Not necessarily in Medford, but in other towns.

437
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:13,695
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's definitely, it is a mitigation and then also changing like the signal phasing and timing and that sort of thing.

438
00:45:13,975 --> 00:45:14,675
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of times.

439
00:45:15,175 --> 00:45:15,955
[SPEAKER_08]: I definitely get that.

440
00:45:15,995 --> 00:45:18,356
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, when I think of widening, of adding.

441
00:45:18,736 --> 00:45:18,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

442
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:24,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I mean, it's it's possible that it could be needed.

443
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:25,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

444
00:45:26,706 --> 00:45:35,394
[SPEAKER_14]: And just to be clear, there is up above in the transportation plan approval is further up there when letter D.

445
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:55,347
[SPEAKER_14]: says that the plan shall include proposed mitigation measures, if any, such as turn lanes, roadway widening or narrowing, signage, signalization, pedestrian enhancements, bicycle and transit facilities, bike sharing, car sharing, transit subsidies, or other measures deemed appropriate by the SPGA.

446
00:45:55,787 --> 00:45:58,148
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's pretty inclusive.

447
00:46:03,926 --> 00:46:10,710
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think the minor change we just captured works.

448
00:46:13,791 --> 00:46:26,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, in terms of the level of service, because I feel that we don't need this, the number seven level of service maintenance or improvement language, just because we have all of this other mitigation process and traffic studies and TDM.

449
00:46:27,899 --> 00:46:29,380
[SPEAKER_14]: But Deanna, do you disagree with that?

450
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:37,752
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you're right, it probably doesn't need to be in here, per se.

451
00:46:39,572 --> 00:46:48,194
[SPEAKER_10]: I think in any traffic study, and you know, they, they would compute the level of service for the future.

452
00:46:48,454 --> 00:46:50,295
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just like a standard thing that's done.

453
00:46:50,455 --> 00:46:54,876
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, I need to be in the ordinance.

454
00:46:54,996 --> 00:46:55,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

455
00:46:58,997 --> 00:46:59,197
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

456
00:47:01,365 --> 00:47:01,545
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

457
00:47:01,565 --> 00:47:02,985
[SPEAKER_14]: So Amanda, can we scroll down more?

458
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,346
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's keep going.

459
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:13,888
[SPEAKER_14]: This changed location of parking areas.

460
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:15,009
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

461
00:47:17,329 --> 00:47:24,651
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think this really gets into policy around changing dimensions, which is not something we have the capacity to do right now.

462
00:47:24,771 --> 00:47:26,432
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that would have to

463
00:47:27,784 --> 00:47:31,245
[SPEAKER_14]: wait for after the comprehensive plan.

464
00:47:45,607 --> 00:47:54,089
[SPEAKER_14]: And I had suggested here is just adding this other provision around vehicle charging stations because we

465
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:01,159
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think mention it anywhere in these performance standards, and we should.

466
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:09,741
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

467
00:48:09,801 --> 00:48:17,223
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, let's stop there after the transportation piece, and let's open it up if there's any members of the public who want to comment further on this.

468
00:48:20,484 --> 00:48:22,405
[SPEAKER_14]: Amanda, maybe we could stop sharing for a moment.

469
00:48:23,785 --> 00:48:24,005
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.

470
00:48:26,613 --> 00:48:27,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Navarro.

471
00:48:30,536 --> 00:48:33,239
[SPEAKER_00]: William Navarro, 108 Bedford Street, apartment 1B.

472
00:48:33,779 --> 00:48:38,543
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a really quick suggestion on the section about siting of parking.

473
00:48:40,244 --> 00:48:51,794
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea was just that perhaps the CDB should consider for large developments, or perhaps I should say for large parking lots, the possibility of future redevelopment potential of that parking lot.

474
00:48:52,334 --> 00:48:54,556
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I was really excited to hear that they were actually

475
00:48:55,241 --> 00:49:01,602
[SPEAKER_00]: convert parking area at that 200 Boston Avenue property into usable building.

476
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:12,404
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be good if we could plan future developments where that kind of thing is possible, whether or not in a structure as in that case, or surface parking lot, they build a building there.

477
00:49:14,045 --> 00:49:15,925
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you should look and see, is that gonna work?

478
00:49:16,105 --> 00:49:17,485
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, that's really good.

479
00:49:17,725 --> 00:49:20,306
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not, maybe you can make it so it would.

480
00:49:22,545 --> 00:49:40,129
[SPEAKER_14]: So if I'm understanding you, you're suggesting including a phrase that says the site, should it be the site plan takes into account possible future redevelopment of parking areas?

481
00:49:40,229 --> 00:49:41,429
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that what you're suggesting?

482
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:47,130
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, okay, thank you.

483
00:49:53,412 --> 00:49:58,939
[SPEAKER_14]: Other members of the public who have comments on the transportation section?

484
00:50:00,982 --> 00:50:04,887
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see any, so let's keep going, Amanda, if you wanna share your screen again.

485
00:50:05,657 --> 00:50:26,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, and a quick note, I believe Mr. Paul Moki is on the call, and so I wasn't sure if we wanted, I think he just has a certain window of time where he's available tonight, and if it made sense to have him comment on specific sections while he's here.

486
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:35,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, I think that does make sense, but do we have, were there specific sections you had in mind, Amanda?

487
00:50:36,308 --> 00:50:46,815
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that there was some discussion early on in these meetings, but I think kind of it comes up in different sections as as it applies around.

488
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:53,452
[SPEAKER_09]: whether the draft or how the draft addresses family and its definition.

489
00:50:55,113 --> 00:51:10,099
[SPEAKER_09]: And talking amongst staff, we had come up with a couple or some ideas, and also there were some proposed ideas by board members, and it might be helpful to kind of flesh those out with Paul here.

490
00:51:11,399 --> 00:51:12,440
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be great.

491
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:18,022
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's skip to that while we have building commissioner here.

492
00:51:24,143 --> 00:51:31,408
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is in reference to the definitions section of the document, which is at the end, I believe section 12, is that right?

493
00:51:31,668 --> 00:51:37,051
[SPEAKER_14]: And definition of family and dwelling units.

494
00:51:51,201 --> 00:51:53,242
[SPEAKER_06]: So Amanda, do you want me to tee this up or did you want to?

495
00:51:59,368 --> 00:52:00,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, a little housekeeping.

496
00:52:04,035 --> 00:52:04,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, Andre.

497
00:52:06,057 --> 00:52:07,598
[SPEAKER_09]: If you'd like me to happen, I can.

498
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:08,839
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

499
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:23,011
[SPEAKER_14]: So there had been at our initial meeting, a lot of conversation about the definition of family and how do we regulate numbers of people who live in buildings and or dwelling units.

500
00:52:23,392 --> 00:52:27,255
[SPEAKER_14]: And so there's been an effort to address this.

501
00:52:27,455 --> 00:52:29,417
[SPEAKER_14]: There were a lot of concerns raised about

502
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:35,565
[SPEAKER_14]: know, the city shouldn't be in the business of trying to regulate what a family is.

503
00:52:36,126 --> 00:52:48,000
[SPEAKER_14]: At the same time, there were some concerns expressed, I think about, you know, a lot of unrelated people being in units, particularly around the college.

504
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,762
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think what

505
00:52:50,762 --> 00:52:53,603
[SPEAKER_14]: The recommendation is here.

506
00:52:53,623 --> 00:53:07,168
[SPEAKER_14]: This latest one is, and thank you, you know, David Blumberg had suggested, I think replacing a lot of the language in terms of with like the dwelling unit.

507
00:53:09,784 --> 00:53:15,946
[SPEAKER_14]: and trying to take out some of the family language, but there are still references to family here.

508
00:53:16,086 --> 00:53:23,508
[SPEAKER_14]: So when you go to dwelling unit, it says dwelling unit means a room or group of rooms forming a habitable unit for one family, so on.

509
00:53:24,268 --> 00:53:35,772
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think we were thinking about changing family to household and inserting a new definition, a household definition, which is used by the US census.

510
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:46,414
[SPEAKER_14]: which, if you see in the comments there says a household is defined by the US Census Bureau is all the people who occupy a single housing unit regardless of their relationship to one another.

511
00:53:47,870 --> 00:54:10,026
[SPEAKER_14]: This still leaves open the question of, you know, enforcement if there's some issues and I think in speaking with some of the city planners we were thinking that enforcement really makes more sense not on the subject of family itself, but on in the actual substance, like whether it's noise parking.

512
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:18,083
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, health and safety issues, and that should really be the place where we have the enforcement.

513
00:54:18,103 --> 00:54:22,725
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think we wanted to get, run this by Paul Moki and get his feedback.

514
00:54:24,706 --> 00:54:26,567
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thanks everybody.

515
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:29,208
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess it's a good time for me to jump in, Andre.

516
00:54:29,228 --> 00:54:30,488
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you have anything to add?

517
00:54:30,508 --> 00:54:31,269
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, definitely.

518
00:54:31,709 --> 00:54:32,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

519
00:54:32,649 --> 00:54:33,670
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, thank you.

520
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:39,393
[SPEAKER_13]: We had a little discussion about this earlier in the week also with some of the community development

521
00:54:41,191 --> 00:54:42,132
[SPEAKER_13]: members of that office.

522
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:51,259
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think from an enforcement point of view, one of the things we went into, it's, you know, the overcrowding.

523
00:54:51,439 --> 00:54:57,924
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that there's, we had, for example, I'm looking at some of the definitions now and

524
00:54:58,903 --> 00:55:07,829
[SPEAKER_13]: We still have in the proposed definition, the lodging house definition, which is basically caps a number of unrelated people at four.

525
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:24,440
[SPEAKER_13]: And as you said earlier, when you switch over to the current proposal for the definition of family, that's also states a group of five or more persons not related by blood adoption or marriage should not be deemed to constitute a family.

526
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,663
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's always been a difficult enforcement issue for us.

527
00:55:28,861 --> 00:55:36,508
[SPEAKER_13]: For example, I think it's kind of tough sometimes to tell people that you can limit the number of family members you have in the house.

528
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:44,595
[SPEAKER_13]: And then by the same token, you get into people having cousins on, second cousins and so on.

529
00:55:44,635 --> 00:55:50,900
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think trying to find family can get kind of tricky from an enforcement point of view.

530
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:54,703
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think if you also look at,

531
00:55:55,938 --> 00:56:18,458
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, are you going to have 11, 12, 13 people living in one unit then that usually results into that kind of spilling over into the street in terms of how many cars people have and then they're parking in the street and the neighbors get overcrowded so I guess we're trying to focus on the real issue here because this can go off on a lot of tangents but I think

532
00:56:19,729 --> 00:56:33,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, I think, uh, and maybe, uh, uh, Mark Brodsky might be able to, uh, shed a little bit more light on this because on the one hand, uh, I think it's tough to tell people how many family members they can or cannot have living in a single household unit.

533
00:56:34,454 --> 00:56:48,159
[SPEAKER_13]: On the other hand, or where do you draw the line in terms of is it in-laws, cousins, second cousins, and so on, because when we go to enforce this and the complaint, the history we've had with the, uh, enforcing this in court action,

534
00:56:49,274 --> 00:56:52,936
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very difficult to say someone has an illegal lodging house.

535
00:56:53,817 --> 00:57:00,521
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think we really have much success on that in the past so maybe I can defer a little this to Mark.

536
00:57:01,041 --> 00:57:09,326
[SPEAKER_13]: Mark have you had any, any thoughts on that as far as limiting what we define as a family, how many people can be living in the household unit.

537
00:57:10,687 --> 00:57:11,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, Paul.

538
00:57:12,468 --> 00:57:14,969
[SPEAKER_04]: My answer is that I wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole.

539
00:57:17,798 --> 00:57:32,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the year or two after the Supreme Court of the United States decided Belter versus Boris, which restricted the number of unrelated people that could live in Belter to not more than two.

540
00:57:34,191 --> 00:57:37,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, a college town, SUNY Stony Brook being nearby.

541
00:57:37,473 --> 00:57:42,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Another case called Moore versus City of East Cleveland,

542
00:57:43,482 --> 00:57:49,624
[SPEAKER_04]: reviewed a local regulation which attempted to limit the definition of family by degree of kinship.

543
00:57:50,504 --> 00:57:58,847
[SPEAKER_04]: And the court said in no uncertain terms that it was a violation of associational rights, privacy rights, and there may be a few others in there.

544
00:57:59,447 --> 00:58:10,411
[SPEAKER_04]: So mindful of that case, which is vintage 1975 or so, I don't think many municipalities have the inclination to do that.

545
00:58:13,637 --> 00:58:15,579
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

546
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:18,541
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mike.

547
00:58:18,781 --> 00:58:19,582
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate that.

548
00:58:19,642 --> 00:58:30,490
[SPEAKER_13]: And just, again, you know, with the housing shortage, and I think it's, and I'm sure you're well aware of the Ernie Block case when they tried to limit the number of kitchens in the house into a single family.

549
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:35,774
[SPEAKER_13]: But so just basically, Andre, there's a couple of things.

550
00:58:35,834 --> 00:58:36,994
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's tough to,

551
00:58:38,148 --> 00:58:43,430
[SPEAKER_13]: find a family and tell them, tell a family, you kind of have certain family members living there.

552
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:53,253
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you look on the flip side of that, we get the complaints, there's eight, nine, 10 people living in this house and it's an overcrowding situation.

553
00:58:53,273 --> 00:58:55,434
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is a tough one.

554
00:58:55,454 --> 00:58:58,195
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not really sure what the correct answer is to that.

555
00:58:58,215 --> 00:59:02,897
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't mean to be too vague with that, but I think that's the reality of what we're looking at here.

556
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:03,693
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

557
00:59:04,154 --> 00:59:09,138
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what are the tools that you have for enforcement when you do see an overcrowding situation.

558
00:59:10,018 --> 00:59:20,407
[SPEAKER_13]: Well right now, the way zone is currently worded and I mentioned this a little earlier, we still do have a definition of lodging house so for example right now it says five or more.

559
00:59:21,377 --> 00:59:22,457
[SPEAKER_13]: unrelated people.

560
00:59:22,778 --> 00:59:29,920
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we would, if we did get a complaint, and a lot of them, as you said, Andrea, is around the Tufts area, which seems to be with students.

561
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:35,442
[SPEAKER_13]: So we would go out there and try and work with the post office, see who's getting mail delivered there.

562
00:59:36,042 --> 00:59:42,325
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we would work in cooperation with the police department, they would, you know, have check on license plates and so on.

563
00:59:43,137 --> 00:59:51,598
[SPEAKER_13]: But some of the cases we've had in court, again, it's difficult because we'll say, hey, we have X amount of people living here.

564
00:59:52,629 --> 00:59:56,051
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, whenever we get a copy of the lease, that's also helpful.

565
00:59:56,071 --> 01:00:02,555
[SPEAKER_13]: So we can pinpoint as much as we can that, hey, it's not a family, there are too many unrelated people.

566
01:00:03,656 --> 01:00:10,380
[SPEAKER_13]: If we have some good documentation, then we're successful in resolving some of those situations.

567
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:15,083
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the difficulties, as an example that we run into with that will be that

568
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:22,761
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you know that they're not on the lease, but when you came, my cousin was visiting from Colorado.

569
01:00:23,001 --> 01:00:25,862
[SPEAKER_13]: It was some, you know, it's a different situations like that.

570
01:00:25,882 --> 01:00:28,463
[SPEAKER_13]: People brought in different circumstances.

571
01:00:30,403 --> 01:00:30,623
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

572
01:00:34,605 --> 01:00:35,845
[SPEAKER_14]: Any thoughts from board members?

573
01:00:41,794 --> 01:00:57,685
[SPEAKER_14]: So as what's recommended here, Paul, does that seem okay to you as good a resolution as we might find in terms of replacing that family language with household and then putting the Census Bureau definition for household in there?

574
01:00:59,827 --> 01:01:04,050
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I do like that thought on that, Andre.

575
01:01:05,531 --> 01:01:06,172
[SPEAKER_13]: One thing that,

576
01:01:08,028 --> 01:01:10,429
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, maybe I could just get back to Vic with this.

577
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:17,313
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been trying to, the sanitation code may have some square footage limitations on this.

578
01:01:17,633 --> 01:01:31,341
[SPEAKER_13]: I did not have a chance in such a crazy week, did not have a chance to check with the Board of Health on that, but I'll put a little note here to get Vic some information from Mary Ann O'Connor, and maybe that may be some type of

579
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:43,992
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, sometimes some type of dimensional number that maybe will help us prevent some overcrowding situations, but at the same time, you know, allowing family members to live together.

580
01:01:45,113 --> 01:01:45,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

581
01:01:49,838 --> 01:01:55,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's a tough issue certainly not something that we're going to totally resolve tonight but I think

582
01:01:56,546 --> 01:02:02,751
[SPEAKER_14]: At least resolving this issue around definition of a family makes sense for our times.

583
01:02:03,251 --> 01:02:19,904
[SPEAKER_14]: And then thinking about how, you know, when there are problems, are there better ways of approaching enforcement, right, through some of the other tools that we have based on the actual impacts to surrounding neighbors.

584
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:24,972
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

585
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:26,913
[SPEAKER_13]: Just real quick, one more quick comment on that.

586
01:02:26,953 --> 01:02:38,099
[SPEAKER_13]: We've had several discussions over the years and I knew this topic was coming up with some of our neighboring communities around here with the code enforcement officials in those communities.

587
01:02:38,239 --> 01:02:41,181
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think basically what it comes down, we're all in the same boat.

588
01:02:41,221 --> 01:02:45,343
[SPEAKER_13]: We all seem to be hitting the same difficulties in enforcing those.

589
01:02:45,443 --> 01:02:50,266
[SPEAKER_13]: But again, we're sensitive to the need for housing and we want to, I don't think it's

590
01:02:50,922 --> 01:02:53,182
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know how we can limit family members.

591
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:59,183
[SPEAKER_13]: Not that we want to do that, but, you know, kind of we're all with the same struggles, basically.

592
01:02:59,203 --> 01:03:00,824
[SPEAKER_13]: We're all trying to find a solution here.

593
01:03:01,784 --> 01:03:03,204
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

594
01:03:04,064 --> 01:03:04,584
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, thank you.

595
01:03:06,165 --> 01:03:14,046
[SPEAKER_14]: And before you go, I'm not sure how much time you have, but were there other sections that you wanted to weigh in on?

596
01:03:14,066 --> 01:03:19,207
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm trying to think some of the other things

597
01:03:20,495 --> 01:03:33,025
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, Vic mentioned one of the things was multiple dwellings where we have mixed use, where we have residential and commercial uses.

598
01:03:34,286 --> 01:03:43,973
[SPEAKER_13]: And we were just kind of brainstorming the other day about that, where there would be allowed in certain districts by right, in some districts by special permit.

599
01:03:44,013 --> 01:03:46,015
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that's still a work in progress, but

600
01:03:47,355 --> 01:04:11,515
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the things we've had some difficulty with and I don't know how the board wants to address this when we've had multiple drawings allow a certain different districts, a multiple allow a drawing would be allowed by right, however, the current definition that would mean a mixed building for example, if you think of some of the Salem Street corridor, you may have commercial use in the first floor with residential up above that.

601
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:16,845
[SPEAKER_13]: and that would fall under the definition of multiple drawing and they're allowed by right.

602
01:04:17,045 --> 01:04:22,730
[SPEAKER_13]: However, the underlying commercial use in that zoning district may not be allowed.

603
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:37,562
[SPEAKER_13]: For example, it may allow retail sales where you would have a sub shop or maybe some type of coffee shop, may not allow professional buildings or offices, medical offices or attorney's offices or consumer service businesses

604
01:04:38,803 --> 01:04:42,225
[SPEAKER_13]: like hair salons, pet grooming, and things like that.

605
01:04:42,325 --> 01:04:59,113
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the one hand, you may be telling an applicant, okay, a multiple dwelling is allowed in that district, which by definition allows them to have commercial, but when you go into the use table and you check specific line items for retail sales, consumer service, there may be a no in that district.

606
01:04:59,173 --> 01:05:04,915
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's sometimes a little bit of a conflict there, and that's just one of the things we started to talk.

607
01:05:05,315 --> 01:05:08,437
[SPEAKER_13]: The board may want to take a look at going forward here.

608
01:05:10,433 --> 01:05:27,379
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so then basically, just to try to summarize that, your suggestion would be to, in areas where multiple dwelling units are allowed by right to also allow first floor commercial by right in those buildings?

609
01:05:28,479 --> 01:05:36,722
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, that's what we're saying, by the same token, if something is a special permit, just to be consistent with that.

610
01:05:37,776 --> 01:05:44,702
[SPEAKER_13]: And if I could just take one more minute, do I have time to address one other issue, Andrew?

611
01:05:44,722 --> 01:05:45,823
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, of course.

612
01:05:45,903 --> 01:05:47,424
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thanks.

613
01:05:47,584 --> 01:06:03,718
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the things that, very common thing, and it ends up in front of the zoning board a lot, is two and a half, say for example, a two-story house, a lot of people, when their families are expanding, they want to put a dorm on, and most of the time,

614
01:06:04,937 --> 01:06:14,279
[SPEAKER_13]: probably 90 somewhat percent of the time with that dorm, it consists of a couple of bedrooms and a bathroom, because again, the kids are getting older and the family's expanding and so on.

615
01:06:14,959 --> 01:06:26,742
[SPEAKER_13]: So on that current definition, and this is very consistent throughout a lot of communities, it's two and a half story, one or two family, it's two and a half story limitation on that.

616
01:06:27,642 --> 01:06:29,783
[SPEAKER_13]: So before the half story,

617
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:39,711
[SPEAKER_13]: was usually defined as 50% of the attic area cannot exceed 50% of the floor area below that.

618
01:06:40,512 --> 01:06:41,932
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's again, pretty standard.

619
01:06:42,013 --> 01:06:58,982
[SPEAKER_13]: So what we did is we amended the definition and just to include how the half story is measured in the building code, for example, it's ceiling height should be seven feet.

620
01:06:59,022 --> 01:06:59,742
[SPEAKER_13]: So we put a

621
01:07:00,472 --> 01:07:16,816
[SPEAKER_13]: definition, a proposal to amend the definition that we measure the ceiling from finished floor, measure the height of the attic area from finished floor to the ceiling and anything that's seven feet or over, that's what's included in a 50% calculation.

622
01:07:17,656 --> 01:07:26,918
[SPEAKER_13]: And in this case, I think it's gonna be, if that amendment to the definition is adopted, I think it will be helpful because a lot of these,

623
01:07:28,062 --> 01:07:32,687
[SPEAKER_13]: one or two families, they were Gable, some type of hip or Gabriel roof.

624
01:07:33,347 --> 01:07:46,701
[SPEAKER_13]: And by allowing that 50% to encompass the seven foot higher measurement, a lot of these sloping ceilings, which are currently counted in some of that square footage, will not be counted.

625
01:07:46,761 --> 01:07:48,343
[SPEAKER_13]: And it just allows these people

626
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:54,251
[SPEAKER_13]: to do this by right without kicking a lot of them to the Zoning Board of Appeals.

627
01:07:54,311 --> 01:07:57,132
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, it's usually a bathroom, a couple of bedrooms.

628
01:07:57,412 --> 01:08:07,034
[SPEAKER_13]: And the other criteria that keeps it in tune with the design of the neighborhoods is that it will not go above the existing ridgeline.

629
01:08:08,094 --> 01:08:19,797
[SPEAKER_13]: That gets into some structural concerns, which we don't need to talk about in this forum, but basically allows people a little more flexibility to put that house story on and keep the aesthetics in line with what the neighborhood looks like.

630
01:08:20,271 --> 01:08:23,773
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, save some of these applicants from having to go to the board of appeals.

631
01:08:25,914 --> 01:08:26,114
Great.

632
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:26,654
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

633
01:08:26,694 --> 01:08:26,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

634
01:08:27,455 --> 01:08:28,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate that.

635
01:08:28,775 --> 01:08:41,122
[SPEAKER_14]: And you had, I guess the one last question we haven't gotten to the section yet, the accessory dwelling units, but I wasn't sure if you had any comments about that section or if you thought the language was good as recommended.

636
01:08:42,491 --> 01:08:50,142
[SPEAKER_13]: I use a training Bobowski's answer and say I don't want to touch that with a 10 foot pole, I guess I don't have that luxury.

637
01:08:50,642 --> 01:08:55,148
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, one of the things that accessory drawing units, I think we covered it earlier in.

638
01:08:56,912 --> 01:08:57,452
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Andrea.

639
01:08:57,472 --> 01:08:58,752
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll make a quick comment on it.

640
01:09:00,133 --> 01:09:11,835
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of these accessory dwelling units that are detached structures, like a garage or some type of shed that's out in the backyard, when it does come to that, we're kicking in for a special permit.

641
01:09:11,975 --> 01:09:23,237
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it goes right to ZBA for a special permit, which is good because a lot of these garages are accessory structures that they may want to convert to accessory dwelling units.

642
01:09:23,337 --> 01:09:25,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Most of them in Medford are non-conforming.

643
01:09:26,362 --> 01:09:31,024
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, probably a lot of the way they would convert that is to add some type of drama.

644
01:09:31,725 --> 01:09:37,567
[SPEAKER_13]: The concern I had, we talked about I think this past summer, there's a lot of these are right on top of the lot lines.

645
01:09:39,886 --> 01:09:44,689
[SPEAKER_13]: If we did permit them by right, I think there'd be a lot of privacy concerns with the neighbors.

646
01:09:44,769 --> 01:10:02,118
[SPEAKER_13]: So making it a special permit, sending it to a public meeting type of form is good because that way some of them probably would be fine, but some of them that I think will really create some privacy issues with the neighborhood, at least go into a special permit.

647
01:10:02,178 --> 01:10:06,520
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone's got input and the board can vote however they wish to on that.

648
01:10:07,541 --> 01:10:07,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

649
01:10:08,707 --> 01:10:08,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

650
01:10:09,648 --> 01:10:09,948
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

651
01:10:09,968 --> 01:10:11,269
[SPEAKER_14]: I really appreciate your time tonight.

652
01:10:11,369 --> 01:10:11,829
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you guys.

653
01:10:11,889 --> 01:10:12,269
[SPEAKER_13]: You're welcome.

654
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:13,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Take care, Paul.

655
01:10:16,632 --> 01:10:20,875
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, yeah.

656
01:10:22,316 --> 01:10:24,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Why don't we just finish the family piece, Amanda?

657
01:10:24,738 --> 01:10:30,242
[SPEAKER_14]: Why don't we do that one since we just talked about it with the commissioner?

658
01:10:32,365 --> 01:10:38,667
[SPEAKER_14]: and open comments up to other board members and then the public on this issue.

659
01:10:41,908 --> 01:10:47,009
[SPEAKER_14]: Do board members feel that this is a good resolution the way we have it here?

660
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:59,833
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's taking out the definition of family, replacing references to family with household and having the definition of household follow the US Census Bureau definitions.

661
01:11:02,004 --> 01:11:15,649
[SPEAKER_14]: While this doesn't address some of the overcrowding concerns, I think the Attorney Bobrowski has made it clear that it doesn't seem possible to enforce, you know, overcrowding through definition of family anyways.

662
01:11:15,890 --> 01:11:18,491
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're not really losing a tool.

663
01:11:19,611 --> 01:11:26,974
[SPEAKER_14]: We may have to, you know, focus on some of the other effects of overcrowding through health, safety, noise, parking, et cetera.

664
01:11:32,305 --> 01:11:42,709
[SPEAKER_04]: To the extent it's helpful, Mr. Chairman, this was one of the main sticking points in the Lowell recodification with UMass Lowell.

665
01:11:43,149 --> 01:11:54,174
[SPEAKER_04]: And people were paving their front yards there to allow parking by multiple tenants of a unit.

666
01:11:54,874 --> 01:11:56,775
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the way they addressed it, basically.

667
01:11:56,915 --> 01:12:01,717
[SPEAKER_04]: They went after the parking and passed regulations to ban that practice rather than

668
01:12:03,467 --> 01:12:12,300
[SPEAKER_04]: They also limited the number of unrelated persons who could constitute a family, but they recognized that that wasn't going to stop large families from paving their front lawns.

669
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,382
[SPEAKER_14]: So Amanda, maybe we could make a note of that.

670
01:12:19,722 --> 01:12:33,030
[SPEAKER_14]: And we are keeping just so folks know that even if there are issues that we can't completely address at this point, there'll be a second bite at the apple through the comprehensive plan process and afterwards.

671
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:37,493
[SPEAKER_14]: So these issues are more policy issues that we may have to revisit then.

672
01:12:38,473 --> 01:12:40,234
[SPEAKER_14]: Deanna, you had unmuted.

673
01:12:40,274 --> 01:12:41,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you want to say something?

674
01:12:41,155 --> 01:12:44,937
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say that I think it's a good solution.

675
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:47,251
[SPEAKER_10]: the way we have it now.

676
01:12:52,234 --> 01:12:54,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Other comments before I open it to the public?

677
01:12:55,477 --> 01:12:56,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Andre, David?

678
01:12:57,038 --> 01:12:57,538
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, David.

679
01:12:58,919 --> 01:13:02,882
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the addition of the census definition.

680
01:13:03,663 --> 01:13:06,905
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't find a way to get rid of that family everywhere.

681
01:13:07,245 --> 01:13:09,627
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that that accomplishes that mission.

682
01:13:10,548 --> 01:13:12,990
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like the city's in a bind because you can't really

683
01:13:14,257 --> 01:13:18,940
[SPEAKER_03]: regulate the number of family members, but maybe there should be more focus on the lodgers then.

684
01:13:19,821 --> 01:13:25,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Or perhaps, as Mr. Moki was saying, something about square footage might be something to consider.

685
01:13:25,944 --> 01:13:34,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe there's a way to at least limit the number of lodgers that might be on top of family members in a housing unit or dwelling unit.

686
01:13:37,151 --> 01:13:42,515
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how to do that exactly, but I feel like the city's free to regulate someone who's paying

687
01:13:44,092 --> 01:13:45,272
[SPEAKER_03]: to be in the dwelling unit.

688
01:13:46,393 --> 01:13:57,636
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I just want to make sure that right now we have it drafted such that there would be two lodgers as of right within any dwelling unit.

689
01:13:57,656 --> 01:13:59,817
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to make sure like is that the right number.

690
01:14:01,578 --> 01:14:04,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Should they be limited if there's not enough room for them.

691
01:14:06,259 --> 01:14:08,420
[SPEAKER_03]: That sort of thing maybe that's for another day but

692
01:14:12,914 --> 01:14:15,075
[SPEAKER_03]: generally, I like where we're headed.

693
01:14:15,155 --> 01:14:20,697
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like we almost have to go in this direction or something similar to this.

694
01:14:24,839 --> 01:14:25,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, David.

695
01:14:29,781 --> 01:14:34,763
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's uh, are there any members of the public who wish to speak on this issue?

696
01:14:42,284 --> 01:14:47,728
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I don't see any, so let's, Amanda, go back to where we were in the document.

697
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:02,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

698
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:07,101
[SPEAKER_14]: aesthetic standards.

699
01:15:07,822 --> 01:15:11,986
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this is just some of that technical changes to the neighborhood character language.

700
01:15:13,006 --> 01:15:26,939
[SPEAKER_14]: There is this new language here around public art, encouraging public art, as well as local historical elements.

701
01:15:32,392 --> 01:15:55,152
[SPEAKER_14]: And then also some new language about balconies and this is David Bloomberg's language proposed incorporating balconies, encouraging that for maximize fresh air and apartments and and then also down below, maximizing open green space, as well as preserve or restore historic landscape to the extent possible.

702
01:16:00,121 --> 01:16:03,283
[SPEAKER_14]: Any comments or questions from board members or members of the public?

703
01:16:06,865 --> 01:16:14,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, continuing to BB, fiscal analysis standards.

704
01:16:14,891 --> 01:16:21,415
[SPEAKER_14]: This was a place where we, in conversation with the city staff,

705
01:16:23,082 --> 01:16:37,610
[SPEAKER_14]: There's been a suggestion made to simplify this language because it could be challenging and expensive requiring the hiring of a third party consultant to carry this out and I think we want to leave it a little bit more.

706
01:16:38,067 --> 01:16:39,128
[SPEAKER_14]: little less prescriptive.

707
01:16:39,708 --> 01:16:47,571
[SPEAKER_14]: So the current recommendation on the table is that the SPGA or Community Development Board may consider the financial impact of the proposed development.

708
01:16:48,092 --> 01:16:57,976
[SPEAKER_14]: The proposed development shall provide a summary of potential impacts on city services, infrastructure, tax base and employment.

709
01:17:01,518 --> 01:17:04,840
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think, you know, we still have as a board

710
01:17:06,231 --> 01:17:14,599
[SPEAKER_14]: the ability to require additional analyses if we deem that they are necessary to evaluating the project.

711
01:17:14,639 --> 01:17:30,834
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think this doesn't limit us in any way, but it sort of simplifies things and we don't have to require a fiscal analysis that requires an independent consultant, which would really could slow things down.

712
01:17:35,388 --> 01:17:39,129
[SPEAKER_14]: Any questions or comments from board members or members of the public on this?

713
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:41,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Andre, David?

714
01:17:42,451 --> 01:17:47,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, David.

715
01:17:48,654 --> 01:17:51,056
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a shall provide a summary.

716
01:17:51,496 --> 01:17:53,577
[SPEAKER_03]: So what does that summary look like?

717
01:17:53,617 --> 01:18:01,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think, at least in my own mind, and what I had proposed was we may require it.

718
01:18:02,001 --> 01:18:03,602
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we do, then you'll provide it.

719
01:18:04,582 --> 01:18:05,962
[SPEAKER_03]: but this as you will provide it.

720
01:18:09,523 --> 01:18:14,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me invite our director of economic development, Victor Schrader, to weigh in on this one.

721
01:18:17,566 --> 01:18:18,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, hi, everyone.

722
01:18:20,507 --> 01:18:22,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's a good question, David.

723
01:18:22,807 --> 01:18:29,309
[SPEAKER_11]: In my experience in former communities I've worked in have required this information for larger projects.

724
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:31,950
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a...

725
01:18:32,755 --> 01:18:38,124
[SPEAKER_11]: I think what we'll get with the provision is written is a summary.

726
01:18:40,168 --> 01:18:44,596
[SPEAKER_11]: And likely they'll ask the city to help them produce the summary.

727
01:18:46,295 --> 01:18:52,557
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the tax base and employment, they'll have that information in terms of infrastructure, city services.

728
01:18:53,257 --> 01:18:59,819
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll be asking us for information on the impacts and working together on that.

729
01:18:59,939 --> 01:19:09,962
[SPEAKER_11]: So on a project where there's an item of particular concern, maybe we ask for more information on that.

730
01:19:10,983 --> 01:19:12,283
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's going to be

731
01:19:12,797 --> 01:19:22,943
[SPEAKER_11]: pretty general and summary rather than providing a lot of detail.

732
01:19:24,103 --> 01:19:35,270
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe my suggestion to tweak this language and address David's issue is, could we say the proposed development shall consult with the Office of Planning Development Sustainability to provide a summary?

733
01:19:41,177 --> 01:19:44,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that sound are certainly open to that, if you think that's a solution.

734
01:19:48,584 --> 01:19:49,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think that helps.

735
01:19:50,666 --> 01:20:05,481
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that sounds like a pretty good idea because I think Victor has, you know, as an example of one of many I'm sure in that office who would be able to help the developer to say okay this is kind of the picture that the board probably needs to see.

736
01:20:06,729 --> 01:20:09,452
[SPEAKER_03]: given your project, here are some particular concerns.

737
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:12,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you go ahead and gather some information on that?

738
01:20:13,335 --> 01:20:16,018
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be really helpful.

739
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:22,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I see Victor's point is that, hey, it's a summary, give them a snapshot, probably won't be a lot of work.

740
01:20:22,825 --> 01:20:31,093
[SPEAKER_03]: So that combination of describing it as a summary and also pointing them to the office, I think is a good combo.

741
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:38,612
[SPEAKER_14]: Other comments or questions from board members or members of the public?

742
01:20:43,456 --> 01:20:46,438
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's keep scrolling down to CC.

743
01:20:54,664 --> 01:20:55,324
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

744
01:20:56,185 --> 01:21:03,591
[SPEAKER_14]: That's just, again, replacing kind of the language in line with the new definitions that we're using, the terminology.

745
01:21:03,611 --> 01:21:05,152
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go down to DD.

746
01:21:08,039 --> 01:21:10,740
[SPEAKER_14]: wireless telecommunications facilities.

747
01:21:12,841 --> 01:21:21,124
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, this is just a tweak to that neighborhood, taking out that neighborhood character language and replacing it with other language.

748
01:21:24,686 --> 01:21:25,146
[SPEAKER_14]: EE.

749
01:21:29,788 --> 01:21:35,810
[SPEAKER_14]: And then this is, again, creating, I think David had suggested some criteria so that if we are

750
01:21:38,586 --> 01:21:50,134
[SPEAKER_14]: if the special permit granting authority does, you know, allow some waivers, that there is a criteria for doing so.

751
01:21:53,536 --> 01:21:58,719
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody has comments on any of these smaller changes to just jump in, otherwise we'll keep going.

752
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:04,423
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go down, Amanda, to FF, which is accessory dwelling units.

753
01:22:05,425 --> 01:22:07,665
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a more significant change.

754
01:22:07,685 --> 01:22:16,987
[SPEAKER_14]: This whole section is new, and based on the language proposed by Attorney Bobrowski, there's some additional recommendations.

755
01:22:21,268 --> 01:22:21,928
[SPEAKER_14]: And the governor.

756
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:24,709
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, exactly.

757
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:30,310
[SPEAKER_14]: Attorney Bobrowski, do you wanna just tee up ADUs?

758
01:22:30,350 --> 01:22:32,470
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, just real quickly.

759
01:22:33,315 --> 01:23:03,008
[SPEAKER_04]: sure the governor's housing bill passed and effective in about a year ago now added some in an attempt to create smaller dwelling units that would alleviate some of the housing crisis weighed in on accessory dwelling units there's a specific definition for accessory dwelling units it's in number four under 8.2.3 that is it's not more than half the floor area of the principal dwelling and

760
01:23:03,648 --> 01:23:06,470
[SPEAKER_04]: nine and or 900 square feet, whichever is smaller.

761
01:23:08,652 --> 01:23:12,135
[SPEAKER_04]: That's consistent with what the governor's bill says.

762
01:23:12,195 --> 01:23:13,636
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why it was added.

763
01:23:14,657 --> 01:23:27,147
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go back to the 8.2.2 accessory dwelling units may be allowed by right in an existing principal dwelling or by special permit in a detached structure.

764
01:23:27,627 --> 01:23:30,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, that's consistent with the governor's bill

765
01:23:32,036 --> 01:23:43,740
[SPEAKER_04]: To the extent that these provisions are voted as is, I believe that it would only take a 50% of the city council to enact them instead of a two thirds vote.

766
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:58,404
[SPEAKER_04]: And the special permit, which is referenced here in 8.2.2 would also be a simple majority of the CDB instead of a super majority as with the normal special permit be.

767
01:23:59,179 --> 01:24:06,222
[SPEAKER_04]: And the rest of it is pretty much just performance standards as you look down the list of 8.2.3 under conditions.

768
01:24:08,762 --> 01:24:14,785
[SPEAKER_04]: So parking spaces, internal, external appearance of the building, so forth.

769
01:24:15,345 --> 01:24:26,729
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a provision at the end of number eight that it would expire after five years, but it can be renewed without a public hearing if the permits indicates that there's

770
01:24:28,348 --> 01:24:36,134
[SPEAKER_04]: owner occupancy of one of the two units, not necessarily the accessory dwelling unit, either of the two units would suffice.

771
01:24:38,876 --> 01:24:43,640
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is not a so-called in-law by-law where a family member has to be the tenant.

772
01:24:44,661 --> 01:24:54,068
[SPEAKER_04]: It's open-ended, it's not an affordable by-law in that the occupant of the accessory dwelling unit has to be under HUD income standards.

773
01:24:55,339 --> 01:25:04,622
[SPEAKER_04]: plain and simple, a dwelling unit in conjunction with a principal unit, one of which is occupied by the owner of the premises.

774
01:25:06,482 --> 01:25:07,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Great, thank you.

775
01:25:07,762 --> 01:25:13,164
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we have a few additional recommendations on top of the attorney's base language.

776
01:25:13,224 --> 01:25:17,085
[SPEAKER_14]: So Amanda, if you can scroll back up to the top, we can just review those real quick.

777
01:25:19,429 --> 01:25:32,931
[SPEAKER_14]: So one suggestion that I made was to switch the permit granting authority here from the ZBA to the Community Development Board.

778
01:25:34,555 --> 01:25:35,256
[SPEAKER_14]: a couple of reasons.

779
01:25:35,496 --> 01:25:47,705
[SPEAKER_14]: One is that if we're saying that ADUs are going to be allowed as of right in an existing dwelling, then it's really not something that needs to go to the ZBA.

780
01:25:47,725 --> 01:25:51,868
[SPEAKER_14]: It's something that, you know, in our purview and our experience around site

781
01:25:52,608 --> 01:25:57,670
[SPEAKER_14]: design review is, I think that seems more appropriate there.

782
01:25:58,410 --> 01:26:05,853
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, you know, special permit, I think the issues around these dwelling units are going to be more on the design side.

783
01:26:06,313 --> 01:26:11,375
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's seems like this board is the most appropriate board to deal with it.

784
01:26:11,495 --> 01:26:15,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Besides, I don't think we want to ZBA already has a lot on their plate.

785
01:26:15,657 --> 01:26:19,778
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think we're trying to relieve some of some of that burden.

786
01:26:21,079 --> 01:26:21,219
[SPEAKER_14]: But

787
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:23,581
[SPEAKER_14]: That's just my suggestion.

788
01:26:23,661 --> 01:26:30,246
[SPEAKER_14]: So let me just keep going down through the other revisions and then we can we can get questions and comments about them.

789
01:26:32,147 --> 01:26:35,029
[SPEAKER_14]: There's just reference again for the as of right ones.

790
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:42,194
[SPEAKER_14]: The building commissioner is really being the person who can do the administrative approval not needing to come to the board.

791
01:26:43,907 --> 01:26:52,471
[SPEAKER_14]: We're just making it added some language saying no accessory apartment shall be held in separate ownership from the principal structure dwelling unit just to be explicit about that.

792
01:26:56,853 --> 01:27:07,078
[SPEAKER_14]: Adding some exceptions language in terms of the size for detached accessory structures that have some preservation value and.

793
01:27:08,138 --> 01:27:10,119
[SPEAKER_14]: as determined by the historical commission.

794
01:27:10,179 --> 01:27:21,365
[SPEAKER_14]: So there are, you know, not a lot, but some carriage houses or barns that may be worth preserving and ADUs is really an opportunity for preserving those, those structures.

795
01:27:21,845 --> 01:27:27,048
[SPEAKER_14]: So as long as the historical commission, you know, the applicant would go to the historical commission first.

796
01:27:27,468 --> 01:27:41,995
[SPEAKER_14]: get kind of a determination from them whether this is it's a structure that has some preservation value, then they come to us and ask us for, you know, an exception, as they're getting their ad use that they can maybe have it a little bit bigger than would otherwise be allowed.

797
01:27:42,936 --> 01:27:44,117
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's that's for that.

798
01:27:45,497 --> 01:27:46,638
[SPEAKER_14]: Down to number five.

799
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:54,902
[SPEAKER_14]: A couple of other just clarifications to ensure that the exterior design fits in with the neighborhood.

800
01:27:56,142 --> 01:27:58,563
[SPEAKER_14]: No additional entrances facing the principal street.

801
01:27:59,563 --> 01:28:04,925
[SPEAKER_14]: An ADU entrance should be either through that one main door or off to the side or back.

802
01:28:06,685 --> 01:28:12,007
[SPEAKER_14]: And then another important change is this number six, which is new, that

803
01:28:13,937 --> 01:28:22,961
[SPEAKER_14]: requires that where the principle where there's a rental unit, which one of them would be the minimum occupancy shall be 30 days.

804
01:28:23,021 --> 01:28:35,546
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is something that other communities have used as well to ensure that these, you know, accessory dwelling units don't get created just to become Airbnb is that the idea is to create affordable rental units in Medford.

805
01:28:35,566 --> 01:28:35,606
[SPEAKER_14]: So

806
01:28:39,613 --> 01:28:49,661
[SPEAKER_14]: And then in number seven, in terms of the parking, it says that the parking doesn't have to be constructed, it can be accommodated on site.

807
01:28:50,621 --> 01:28:55,685
[SPEAKER_14]: And so if it is constructed, then it has to meet some design criteria.

808
01:28:58,203 --> 01:29:01,464
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that's it, basically.

809
01:29:02,004 --> 01:29:11,426
[SPEAKER_14]: We also wanted to make sure that the special permit doesn't have to come every five years before the board, that the building commissioner can just renew it administratively.

810
01:29:12,186 --> 01:29:16,627
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think those are some of the recommended changes to Attorney Bobrowski's language.

811
01:29:17,247 --> 01:29:20,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Any comments or questions from board members?

812
01:29:30,353 --> 01:29:34,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Hearing none, let's see if there's any comments or questions from members of the public.

813
01:29:34,096 --> 01:29:46,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I'll take that as this looks good.

814
01:29:46,647 --> 01:29:52,372
[SPEAKER_14]: Amanda, let's continue.

815
01:30:00,354 --> 01:30:05,356
[SPEAKER_14]: These ones here are also other prior suggestions around ADUs.

816
01:30:05,416 --> 01:30:10,479
[SPEAKER_14]: I think some of that's been incorporated and addressed in the language we just reviewed above.

817
01:30:10,599 --> 01:30:21,524
[SPEAKER_14]: So unless I'm mistaken, I think we can skip these and go down to JJ.

818
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:25,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Special permit criteria.

819
01:30:27,207 --> 01:30:29,889
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I think this is dealing with the neighborhood character.

820
01:30:29,909 --> 01:30:37,174
[SPEAKER_14]: And the one note that I had there is I don't know if this was the numbering on this one was correct.

821
01:30:38,334 --> 01:30:46,980
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought it looked like 9.1.11, not 9.1.9, but that's something maybe the attorney can just make sure is correct.

822
01:30:47,493 --> 01:30:48,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry about that.

823
01:30:48,834 --> 01:30:58,099
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I did double check this one and found that the number was consistent with what was in the draft, but we can check that administratively.

824
01:30:58,119 --> 01:31:05,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

825
01:31:05,384 --> 01:31:06,484
[SPEAKER_14]: Planned Development District.

826
01:31:06,504 --> 01:31:16,010
[SPEAKER_14]: This is new language suggested by Attorney Borowski to create a new tool for the zoning in the city, which is called Planned Development District.

827
01:31:16,542 --> 01:31:27,244
[SPEAKER_14]: And the idea is that a development, essentially you can create, oh, what's like a floating zoning district and maybe attorney progress.

828
01:31:27,304 --> 01:31:40,427
[SPEAKER_14]: You can explain this a little bit better than I am right now, but it gives more flexibility to the city to make changes to zoning in conjunction with key development projects.

829
01:31:42,687 --> 01:31:45,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Chairman, I consider it an invitation

830
01:31:45,517 --> 01:32:02,466
[SPEAKER_04]: So what you're signaling to the community at large and prospective developers is that if you've got a good idea, bring it to us at the community development board and the mayor's office, and let's talk about what it will be.

831
01:32:03,687 --> 01:32:09,250
[SPEAKER_04]: By definition, it doesn't fit into the zoning today, but that's not a problem in that you can write zoning for it.

832
01:32:10,302 --> 01:32:25,836
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to give you a really encouraging example, when Haverhill adopted the zoning that I wrote for them back, I believe it was in, I think it was in the fall of 2020, since then we've had two PDDs.

833
01:32:26,316 --> 01:32:34,584
[SPEAKER_04]: One is at the site of a former banquet facility in Bradford, and that by Princeton Properties is a proposal for 150 apartment units.

834
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:39,101
[SPEAKER_04]: and a small retail component.

835
01:32:39,221 --> 01:32:41,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise it wouldn't be allowed in that area.

836
01:32:41,522 --> 01:32:48,085
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wrote zoning for the parcel using Princeton properties, very concrete ideas.

837
01:32:48,445 --> 01:32:52,206
[SPEAKER_04]: It's literally, they gave us the music and I wrote the words.

838
01:32:52,527 --> 01:32:54,327
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the way it works.

839
01:32:54,808 --> 01:32:58,949
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the city council finds that to be favorable, then it will pass.

840
01:32:59,189 --> 01:33:02,051
[SPEAKER_04]: You can put it on special permit or you can do it by site plan review.

841
01:33:02,731 --> 01:33:04,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Haverhill chose to do that one by site plan review.

842
01:33:05,578 --> 01:33:07,680
[SPEAKER_04]: The new one is even more exciting.

843
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:12,104
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a redevelopment of the downtown by the Lupoli company.

844
01:33:12,164 --> 01:33:17,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Sal Lupoli is from Lawrence and he has a lot of connections in Haverhill as well.

845
01:33:17,808 --> 01:33:26,456
[SPEAKER_04]: He just recently built a new building on the river, 10 stories with a restaurant on top that we hope will open this year, COVID notwithstanding.

846
01:33:26,996 --> 01:33:30,339
[SPEAKER_04]: And this one will replace a parking garage and it will also

847
01:33:31,039 --> 01:33:33,940
[SPEAKER_04]: change about two or three blocks in the middle of downtown Haverhill.

848
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, it will be a planned development district.

849
01:33:37,842 --> 01:33:41,163
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of our options, but it certainly is the most flexible one.

850
01:33:41,683 --> 01:33:52,387
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's to do something which isn't currently envisioned at the request of the developer in partnership with the developer, and it is all by cooperation.

851
01:33:52,947 --> 01:33:57,129
[SPEAKER_04]: So if the city doesn't like the idea, there's one meeting and no more.

852
01:33:58,383 --> 01:34:05,225
[SPEAKER_04]: I suppose a developer is always free to submit their own zoning proposal, but I think it would be DOA if the powers that be rejected.

853
01:34:05,905 --> 01:34:20,568
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a pattern that has taken root in the city I think that I've worked in most predominantly would be Quincy and the two towns I've worked in would be Burlington and Lexington.

854
01:34:21,428 --> 01:34:23,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe Lexington has something like 24 PDDs today.

855
01:34:28,049 --> 01:34:55,710
[SPEAKER_14]: And Attorney Wroblewski, when let's say a developer or property owners, you know, comes forward with a proposal to change the zoning on, you know, in a particular area or for a particular parcel, is the development, is the zoning and the development approved at the same time or is the zoning approved first as a PDD and then there's still a project review component?

856
01:34:56,089 --> 01:35:05,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it's, I think it's the latter, although there's temptation when you've got a majority of the city council to immediately move for site plan approval at the CDB.

857
01:35:06,332 --> 01:35:12,294
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the best and most prudent way to do it is to then have step two which is the plan approval process.

858
01:35:13,414 --> 01:35:13,755
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

859
01:35:14,435 --> 01:35:19,196
[SPEAKER_14]: And Christy you have a you had a comment on this section, could you just explain a little bit more.

860
01:35:20,217 --> 01:35:21,237
[SPEAKER_14]: If you have concerns.

861
01:35:22,097 --> 01:35:23,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, I didn't have any concerns.

862
01:35:23,737 --> 01:35:38,620
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just trying to figure out, like, how does this tie to leveraging these opportunities to get back mitigation or not mitigation, but some real benefits to the city.

863
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:41,401
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not familiar with PDDs.

864
01:35:41,521 --> 01:35:48,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I just sort of was trying to relate it to plan development areas that I'm more familiar with.

865
01:35:49,308 --> 01:35:55,411
[SPEAKER_07]: in Boston, which is actually those are very more prescriptive and they have very specific process.

866
01:35:56,271 --> 01:36:15,520
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's, there's like elements of like, if you come in with a proposal, and you want to get, you know, something larger or something, or it's a specific use, you know, the city would like to get, you know, a park out of it, or, you know, some community space.

867
01:36:18,186 --> 01:36:19,026
[SPEAKER_07]: or something like that.

868
01:36:19,086 --> 01:36:23,128
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wasn't sure like where, how does that get resolved?

869
01:36:23,208 --> 01:36:34,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that just within the whole process of a potential developer coming in and saying, you know, here's my plan and then it's just a series of negotiations?

870
01:36:36,072 --> 01:36:36,852
[SPEAKER_04]: You're exactly right.

871
01:36:36,892 --> 01:36:38,673
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's, there's two answers.

872
01:36:38,733 --> 01:36:47,496
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, in the Lupoli company's now pending proposal, that is land owned by the city for the most part.

873
01:36:48,575 --> 01:36:50,817
[SPEAKER_04]: or pieces of it, certainly the parking garage.

874
01:36:51,337 --> 01:36:59,421
[SPEAKER_04]: So there will be a land disposition agreement that will describe what the Lupoli companies will do down to the nails, as I like to say.

875
01:36:59,481 --> 01:37:05,444
[SPEAKER_04]: That development agreement is an appendix to the purchase and sale agreement.

876
01:37:05,484 --> 01:37:06,184
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a rider.

877
01:37:07,345 --> 01:37:11,327
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's not land owned by the city, then the usual format is that the

878
01:37:12,189 --> 01:37:17,773
[SPEAKER_04]: initial meeting results in a discussion about potential mitigation, let's keep a list.

879
01:37:18,493 --> 01:37:19,774
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you have to do?

880
01:37:19,814 --> 01:37:24,177
[SPEAKER_04]: That's list A and column B in that list would be what would we like you to do?

881
01:37:24,277 --> 01:37:25,918
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a negotiation after that.

882
01:37:26,298 --> 01:37:32,202
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's no harm in having a second document that rides along with the zoning amendments and or the plan.

883
01:37:32,502 --> 01:37:41,928
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to do it with the zoning amendment because at the plan approval stage, whether you can ask for certain things in the site plan review or special permit process is dubious.

884
01:37:42,553 --> 01:37:43,113
[SPEAKER_04]: if appealed.

885
01:37:43,613 --> 01:37:53,917
[SPEAKER_04]: So rather than wait until you get to the tail end of the process, if there's to be mitigation, like the examples you gave, I like to do it as a document.

886
01:37:54,137 --> 01:37:57,098
[SPEAKER_04]: So the zoning amendment is accompanied by a development agreement.

887
01:37:57,378 --> 01:38:01,620
[SPEAKER_04]: The development agreement is usually signed by the mayor's office or the city council and or both.

888
01:38:02,380 --> 01:38:06,281
[SPEAKER_04]: And that document is a covenant that runs for the land in that case.

889
01:38:06,321 --> 01:38:08,722
[SPEAKER_04]: And the developer has to step up to the plate.

890
01:38:10,422 --> 01:38:13,242
[SPEAKER_14]: So, well, I think that's, this is interesting.

891
01:38:13,743 --> 01:38:23,744
[SPEAKER_14]: So attorney will rescue would it be possible for us to insert language requiring that the developer submit a statement of community benefits.

892
01:38:26,645 --> 01:38:39,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you're, you're, you're certainly looking at the fiscal impact as a result of section 6.4 language, and so I think they'd be giving you community benefits and because they want to sell the project.

893
01:38:39,936 --> 01:38:42,757
[SPEAKER_04]: but they'd also be alerting you to community costs.

894
01:38:42,857 --> 01:38:47,420
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that's where the nub of the discussion takes revolves around.

895
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:51,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can do it a number of different ways.

896
01:38:52,942 --> 01:39:08,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Many times when I'm working in a large town, for example, Plymouth Rubber, a parcel of land in Canton that went to Helena Handbasket, formerly a site Paul Revere used to make copper goods

897
01:39:10,852 --> 01:39:38,108
[SPEAKER_04]: When the developer came to the town, we signed a development agreement in which he agreed to put, I don't remember the number, $40,000 into escrow in the treasurer's office, so that the town, in advance of putting this on any kind of an agenda, and in order to have answers for the people who had questions, engaged a peer review for the traffic study, for the stormwater management, it's right on the Charles River, and, New Ponset River, sorry.

898
01:39:38,767 --> 01:39:42,129
[SPEAKER_04]: and there were other things involved.

899
01:39:42,609 --> 01:39:57,537
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if I'm an elected official of a city or town and a proposal is going forward either at the council level or at the town meeting level, and the first question is what about the traffic and I don't know the answer, then I'm not doing my job.

900
01:39:57,778 --> 01:40:06,823
[SPEAKER_04]: So the town negotiated to have people work for it at the developer's expense so that those questions could be answered in advance.

901
01:40:07,875 --> 01:40:14,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Those peer reviewers also identify possible mitigation measures, which feeds column A and column B in the development agreement.

902
01:40:16,938 --> 01:40:21,820
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm just looking at the language a little bit in terms of the ordinance submission.

903
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:29,863
[SPEAKER_14]: So it says the applicant shall submit a proposed amendment to the ordinance for the PD district rezoning and consultation with the community development board.

904
01:40:30,983 --> 01:40:34,424
[SPEAKER_14]: The proposed amendment shall contain the requirements set forth in section 9.2.5.

905
01:40:40,091 --> 01:40:41,452
[SPEAKER_14]: which is like a, you know, narrative.

906
01:40:41,552 --> 01:40:43,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so you've potential fiscal impact.

907
01:40:44,653 --> 01:40:54,457
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I guess I'm just, and then it says the community development board shall hold a public hearing.

908
01:40:54,497 --> 01:40:57,918
[SPEAKER_14]: We inserted the public hearing because neither needs to be a public hearing.

909
01:40:59,319 --> 01:41:03,020
[SPEAKER_14]: Prepare the text of the proposed amendment and locate the new district on the zoning.

910
01:41:03,967 --> 01:41:08,669
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the finalized amendment shall be presented to the city council for approval of the proposed PDD.

911
01:41:09,069 --> 01:41:11,170
[SPEAKER_14]: So I guess just getting to Christie's point.

912
01:41:11,771 --> 01:41:19,654
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not entirely sure like where, like who's doing that negotiating around the community benefits, you know, very good question.

913
01:41:20,195 --> 01:41:22,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I, it will depend on the city or town.

914
01:41:23,916 --> 01:41:27,578
[SPEAKER_04]: My preferred answer is that the chief executive officer.

915
01:41:28,793 --> 01:41:32,055
[SPEAKER_04]: would do that because somebody has to establish priorities.

916
01:41:32,135 --> 01:41:37,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise it'll be a food festival between the various departments competing for a limited pool of resources.

917
01:41:38,439 --> 01:41:51,007
[SPEAKER_04]: So typically somebody has to make a priority list and check it twice or else I've seen department heads in cities and boards in communities reach out their hands and say, me too, me too, me too.

918
01:41:51,527 --> 01:41:57,451
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, in one case where I negotiated a development agreement for the Wayland Town Center, a project about 10 or 12 years ago,

919
01:41:58,673 --> 01:42:00,674
[SPEAKER_04]: the developer ultimately said, enough is enough.

920
01:42:00,774 --> 01:42:05,855
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just gonna give you X million dollars at the issuance of the first building permit.

921
01:42:06,175 --> 01:42:08,876
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the way we were to the development agreement at the end of it.

922
01:42:09,176 --> 01:42:13,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there was no control in that infighting, if you will, on the municipal side.

923
01:42:14,657 --> 01:42:19,739
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the chief executive officer typically is the one who can capture that process best.

924
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:24,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Every town is different, every city is different.

925
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:27,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, just wondering whether there's

926
01:42:29,088 --> 01:42:33,490
[SPEAKER_14]: a way of, you know, to indicate how that should happen.

927
01:42:34,931 --> 01:42:36,311
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know that it's predictable.

928
01:42:36,331 --> 01:42:47,796
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I didn't, if you can predict who is most likely at the snapshot to take charge and who would be best suited to do so, God bless you, good luck.

929
01:42:48,677 --> 01:42:52,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't do it generically, let me put it that way, in every city or town.

930
01:42:52,778 --> 01:42:54,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I have worked in some towns

931
01:42:54,718 --> 01:42:58,262
[SPEAKER_04]: especially towns, where the manager was, it's my way or the highway.

932
01:42:58,322 --> 01:43:02,927
[SPEAKER_04]: And the conversation never went to level two unless there was an agreement right up front to that effect.

933
01:43:03,367 --> 01:43:08,433
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just in terms of organizing mitigation and resources.

934
01:43:09,714 --> 01:43:12,437
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I've worked in other places where there were 23 oars on the boat.

935
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:21,681
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have any brilliant ideas to, you know, improve the language.

936
01:43:22,301 --> 01:43:24,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Any board members have questions or comments or suggestions.

937
01:43:24,962 --> 01:43:33,703
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't hear any any members of the public want to weigh in on on this issue.

938
01:43:38,084 --> 01:43:38,964
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

939
01:43:39,004 --> 01:43:43,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Despite the lack of comment I want to tell you that from a land use lawyers perspective, this is

940
01:43:44,263 --> 01:43:50,006
[SPEAKER_04]: the best kind of work there is, because it's all, it's either all agreement, or we all go home.

941
01:43:52,787 --> 01:43:54,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

942
01:43:54,167 --> 01:43:55,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Just one more clarifying question.

943
01:43:55,748 --> 01:44:10,915
[SPEAKER_07]: So the section that talks about small plan developments has a square footage, but up above, it's sort of like an open, it's open in terms of the size of these PDDs.

944
01:44:12,053 --> 01:44:21,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Like how do you determine that if you're keeping it open in terms of what the size could be?

945
01:44:21,241 --> 01:44:23,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there's no minimum size it says above.

946
01:44:24,504 --> 01:44:26,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I reading these out of context?

947
01:44:27,326 --> 01:44:30,389
[SPEAKER_04]: I see the less than, I'm trying to watch the scroll here.

948
01:44:30,569 --> 01:44:34,432
[SPEAKER_04]: I see the 15,000 as being less than for a small plan.

949
01:44:34,492 --> 01:44:35,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the open?

950
01:44:35,833 --> 01:44:40,337
[SPEAKER_07]: But up above, if you could scroll up, whoever has it.

951
01:44:40,895 --> 01:44:48,962
[SPEAKER_07]: where it talks about the PD district does not have any minimum, okay, so that's a lot size, no minimum lot area.

952
01:44:48,982 --> 01:44:51,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

953
01:44:52,626 --> 01:44:55,388
[SPEAKER_07]: And then down here is just, what's that, scores footage?

954
01:44:57,811 --> 01:44:58,051
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

955
01:44:58,351 --> 01:45:04,336
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it says that in change that could result in, could you scroll a little bit more, Amanda?

956
01:45:04,777 --> 01:45:05,057
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.

957
01:45:05,818 --> 01:45:07,019
[SPEAKER_14]: Of buildings, okay.

958
01:45:09,532 --> 01:45:19,615
[SPEAKER_14]: So I guess you'd have to, somebody has got to do like a build out analysis to see whether it's less than 15,000 feet or not, I guess.

959
01:45:22,756 --> 01:45:27,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it just seems a little disjointed to me, but I'm probably not understanding because I'm not a land use attorney.

960
01:45:28,777 --> 01:45:34,879
[SPEAKER_07]: But usually like the square footage of a building ties to the lot area.

961
01:45:35,059 --> 01:45:38,500
[SPEAKER_07]: So then you figure out like your density and, you know,

962
01:45:39,289 --> 01:45:43,272
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's then a whole bunch of planning and decisions around that.

963
01:45:43,312 --> 01:45:51,339
[SPEAKER_07]: So it just seems a little confusing to me, but that doesn't mean I know what I'm talking about.

964
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:54,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if it's confusing, then it should be fixed.

965
01:45:54,362 --> 01:45:57,825
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's put that on the list of things to clarify.

966
01:46:10,664 --> 01:46:11,645
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, thanks everyone.

967
01:46:15,328 --> 01:46:24,115
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, in terms of clarification, I guess, you know, if that's something you want to think about further, Attorney Brabrowski, then maybe at the city council level.

968
01:46:26,457 --> 01:46:35,485
[SPEAKER_14]: But even though it may be a little, a little ambiguous, I guess I feel comfortable with

969
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:40,661
[SPEAKER_14]: with the language if necessary.

970
01:46:40,681 --> 01:46:56,104
[SPEAKER_14]: And it leaves the discretion in the hands of the city planning office to work with the developer if it happens to be a small one about whether they want to go the small PDD route or not.

971
01:46:58,865 --> 01:47:02,806
[SPEAKER_04]: There actually are some in Lexington that are under 15,000 square feet.

972
01:47:06,387 --> 01:47:07,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Not sure about Burlington.

973
01:47:08,285 --> 01:47:09,887
[SPEAKER_04]: I doubt it very much in Quincy.

974
01:47:14,170 --> 01:47:15,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Amanda, let's keep scrolling down.

975
01:47:25,019 --> 01:47:26,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry for the interruption there.

976
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:31,844
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just for, I forgot to record at the beginning, but we are streaming on Medford Community Media.

977
01:47:31,864 --> 01:47:33,345
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just for our records.

978
01:47:33,666 --> 01:47:34,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, everyone.

979
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:55,286
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so in terms of the plan development district, this is, again, the narrative that would accompany an application for a PDD that would have these seven elements to it.

980
01:47:58,327 --> 01:48:01,188
[SPEAKER_14]: Any questions or comments from the board members?

981
01:48:06,475 --> 01:48:07,616
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's keep going down then.

982
01:48:07,636 --> 01:48:12,199
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there's some questions, Christy, that maybe you had around linkage.

983
01:48:12,219 --> 01:48:19,044
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if you want to articulate these.

984
01:48:20,265 --> 01:48:20,905
[SPEAKER_06]: What did I say?

985
01:48:25,408 --> 01:48:26,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Where did I tag that to?

986
01:48:26,749 --> 01:48:30,212
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's these questions in purple here.

987
01:48:30,232 --> 01:48:31,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

988
01:48:35,395 --> 01:48:45,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, I was just trying to make some sense of like the whole financial analysis section, which is going to suggest that there's like some impact and then.

989
01:48:45,780 --> 01:48:48,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that impact?

990
01:48:50,243 --> 01:48:52,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Can that impact be dealt with by linkage?

991
01:48:54,565 --> 01:48:56,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is I didn't see any.

992
01:48:58,487 --> 01:49:03,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Where that it addressed, like, getting money for housing and jobs within the city, you know, if.

993
01:49:05,060 --> 01:49:06,661
[SPEAKER_07]: It's particularly like housing.

994
01:49:07,181 --> 01:49:11,264
[SPEAKER_07]: If big commercial developments, you know are approved.

995
01:49:13,225 --> 01:49:32,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a way to get linkage to go into, like an affordable housing fund or something so it's just, just a question I've seen linkage and other cities for housing and jobs and just wondering if that's something that would

996
01:49:32,495 --> 01:49:35,136
[SPEAKER_07]: be considered here in Medford or it's dealt with in a different way.

997
01:49:36,377 --> 01:49:38,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Andre this is Alicia.

998
01:49:38,338 --> 01:49:42,060
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want me to mind if I address.

999
01:49:43,161 --> 01:49:43,801
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, go ahead.

1000
01:49:43,861 --> 01:49:46,863
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a I have a response as well but why don't you take a crack at it.

1001
01:49:48,868 --> 01:49:49,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1002
01:49:49,568 --> 01:49:56,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Just sort of briefly, the way our link, our linkage the way it is set up through homeworld petition.

1003
01:49:57,550 --> 01:50:08,113
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not confident that we could just change it by making edits to zoning here we'd rather take a deeper dive lick with the with some legal assistance on that.

1004
01:50:08,873 --> 01:50:25,219
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, the way our, our linkage is set up it does go into funds, none of those funds support housing or jobs, their parks public safety infrastructure type funds, and the linkage was written 30 years ago, and it said that.

1005
01:50:25,879 --> 01:50:29,361
[SPEAKER_01]: it would be reviewed and updated every three years.

1006
01:50:29,741 --> 01:50:32,142
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has never been, the dollar amounts are the same.

1007
01:50:32,703 --> 01:50:43,969
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are actually looking at what would be the best mechanism to review and make proposals to update linkage as a separate effort outside of this recodification.

1008
01:50:43,989 --> 01:50:50,652
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted you guys to know that we've been actively discussing what's the best way to move forward on that.

1009
01:50:51,532 --> 01:50:52,913
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, I have a timer going off.

1010
01:50:56,715 --> 01:50:59,316
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, sorry, I think that's all I have to say on that.

1011
01:50:59,336 --> 01:51:00,276
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1012
01:51:00,356 --> 01:51:00,876
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Alicia.

1013
01:51:00,896 --> 01:51:09,378
[SPEAKER_14]: And what I was going to say, which I think dovetails with what you just said, is that there have been some questions that have come up about linkage.

1014
01:51:09,958 --> 01:51:14,359
[SPEAKER_14]: The way linkage works in Medford is pretty unique around the state.

1015
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:23,682
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's been at least one question that's come up about allowing the CD board approving or not

1016
01:51:25,095 --> 01:51:32,341
[SPEAKER_14]: some of the investments that are made by developers and giving them credit towards their linkage payment.

1017
01:51:33,201 --> 01:51:43,009
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that we as a board also just need to understand the linkage ordinance better and maybe talk through some of these questions strategically with the city.

1018
01:51:43,089 --> 01:51:48,773
[SPEAKER_14]: And it probably sounds like it's a good time to do so since as Alicia mentioned, they're gonna be looking at this.

1019
01:51:48,853 --> 01:51:52,716
[SPEAKER_14]: So what I was gonna suggest is that after the zoning is done sometime in the,

1020
01:51:54,482 --> 01:52:08,234
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, winter or spring, we put on our board meeting agenda, a presentation by city staff about the linkage, how linkage works in the city, so that we can just learn more about it.

1021
01:52:08,534 --> 01:52:15,200
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think explore some of these issues and maybe provide some helpful feedback to them as they're thinking about any changes.

1022
01:52:17,274 --> 01:52:20,735
[SPEAKER_01]: chair, I think that would be excellent once this is put to bed.

1023
01:52:21,215 --> 01:52:38,561
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, that would really help inform any study we do would be for us to first present how it currently exists, hear some feedback on it, and then have that inform a study that we would then do, because we can't change the numbers appropriately without a financial analysis.

1024
01:52:40,481 --> 01:52:42,942
[SPEAKER_04]: When you do that, please make sure I get an invitation.

1025
01:52:44,963 --> 01:52:45,503
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the only

1026
01:52:46,364 --> 01:52:52,227
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the only show in town in terms of linkage, other than Boston and I'd love to see how you do it.

1027
01:52:54,548 --> 01:52:55,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

1028
01:52:59,531 --> 01:52:59,911
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1029
01:52:59,931 --> 01:53:05,694
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we can continue down then to 11.5 community development board rules.

1030
01:53:14,296 --> 01:53:21,620
[SPEAKER_14]: So I made a couple of recommendations in terms of additional tweaks to the language.

1031
01:53:22,821 --> 01:53:29,865
[SPEAKER_14]: We have right here, like all boards, we have a limitation on terms.

1032
01:53:30,445 --> 01:53:36,749
[SPEAKER_14]: You can serve for two terms of three years.

1033
01:53:37,549 --> 01:53:42,592
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I'm suggesting here, just as my experience is, I became chair very suddenly.

1034
01:53:44,901 --> 01:53:49,683
[SPEAKER_14]: it's helpful to have some experience when you become the chair.

1035
01:53:50,203 --> 01:53:57,846
[SPEAKER_14]: And so maybe an exception could be made if someone could serve a third term as chair.

1036
01:53:58,206 --> 01:54:04,848
[SPEAKER_14]: And that way they'd already have maybe two terms under their belt, and then they'd have three years as a chair.

1037
01:54:06,368 --> 01:54:13,571
[SPEAKER_14]: Because otherwise, you're asking somebody who's in their first or second term to become chair, and I think it's more challenging.

1038
01:54:15,802 --> 01:54:17,143
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's a suggestion.

1039
01:54:17,743 --> 01:54:18,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep, go ahead, David.

1040
01:54:19,284 --> 01:54:20,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we have the flexibility.

1041
01:54:20,784 --> 01:54:32,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with you from everything you said and from the perspective of good governance, that would be, I think, the most prudent approach to make sure that we have a chair with experience.

1042
01:54:32,710 --> 01:54:39,073
[SPEAKER_03]: But the acts of 1974 specifically tell us that no member shall serve more than two consecutive terms.

1043
01:54:41,504 --> 01:54:42,545
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's why I'm not a lawyer.

1044
01:54:42,945 --> 01:54:47,948
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's usually a good thing.

1045
01:54:47,988 --> 01:54:48,368
[SPEAKER_14]: So no.

1046
01:54:49,208 --> 01:54:51,210
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1047
01:54:51,250 --> 01:54:51,730
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, David.

1048
01:54:51,750 --> 01:54:53,191
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate that clarification.

1049
01:54:58,494 --> 01:55:00,535
[SPEAKER_14]: Scrolling down to a little bit here.

1050
01:55:00,555 --> 01:55:02,056
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Jackie.

1051
01:55:02,096 --> 01:55:03,137
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can go back to that.

1052
01:55:03,497 --> 01:55:08,780
[SPEAKER_08]: So the, as you know, in my position, I'm appointed by the governor under DHCD.

1053
01:55:09,612 --> 01:55:15,999
[SPEAKER_08]: And my term does not expire on the fiscal year, so I don't know if you want to expound on that, or just leave it as is.

1054
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:17,480
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's.

1055
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:26,569
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just gonna say I think it's okay as is because it says members appointed by the mayor shall serve for a term of three years so you'd be excluded for that.

1056
01:55:26,970 --> 01:55:27,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1057
01:55:30,659 --> 01:55:34,062
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I see when you mean no, no member shall serve more than two consecutive terms.

1058
01:55:34,362 --> 01:55:40,948
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe we could just say members appointed by the mayor shall serve for a term of three years and not more than two consecutive terms.

1059
01:55:41,809 --> 01:55:42,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1060
01:55:42,690 --> 01:55:44,211
[SPEAKER_14]: That would take care of that, Jackie.

1061
01:55:44,691 --> 01:55:44,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1062
01:55:45,872 --> 01:55:46,633
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for bringing that up.

1063
01:55:53,165 --> 01:56:05,910
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving down under powers, there's, I added just a few things here, which just to more kind of more comprehensively reflect our job as the CD board.

1064
01:56:06,490 --> 01:56:11,372
[SPEAKER_14]: So I wanted to make sure we do a lot of, we review approval, not required plans.

1065
01:56:11,472 --> 01:56:14,153
[SPEAKER_14]: We hold public hearings and make recommendations to the city council.

1066
01:56:16,554 --> 01:56:20,075
[SPEAKER_14]: And we provide design review feedback as needed to developers.

1067
01:56:22,424 --> 01:56:26,465
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you know, the one thing that I've forgotten here, maybe we should add is on number three.

1068
01:56:27,185 --> 01:56:28,045
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh no, no, nevermind.

1069
01:56:28,446 --> 01:56:32,727
[SPEAKER_14]: To hear and decide subdivision applications as well as review approval not required plans.

1070
01:56:32,787 --> 01:56:34,267
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so that includes the subdivisions.

1071
01:56:38,808 --> 01:56:41,169
[SPEAKER_15]: I feel like the design review thing is good.

1072
01:56:41,469 --> 01:56:42,409
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm happy to see it.

1073
01:56:44,730 --> 01:56:46,090
[SPEAKER_15]: It feels a little vague to me.

1074
01:56:50,880 --> 01:57:12,445
[SPEAKER_14]: It is a little vague, I think, because we've only done it in terms of, you know, it's informal and it's, I think it's a practice that planning staff is encouraging, but it's not a formal role that we have, unless I guess we want to propose that, but that would be, I think, a more significant policy change.

1075
01:57:18,212 --> 01:57:43,260
[SPEAKER_15]: How about to provide design review feedback in parallel with other necessary review and strike the word as needed?

1076
01:57:48,158 --> 01:57:52,841
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there any, like Alicia or others, any thoughts about that suggestion?

1077
01:58:00,465 --> 01:58:00,906
[SPEAKER_14]: Or Victor?

1078
01:58:03,247 --> 01:58:12,372
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, basically I'm just saying as needed sort of makes it even less,

1079
01:58:19,252 --> 01:58:21,033
[SPEAKER_15]: inclusive to the process.

1080
01:58:26,716 --> 01:58:28,396
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is Victor.

1081
01:58:28,416 --> 01:58:38,321
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing to consider is which projects this applies to and whether it's all projects that would come before the city board.

1082
01:58:39,341 --> 01:58:41,182
[SPEAKER_11]: And Andrei's right.

1083
01:58:41,322 --> 01:58:46,205
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we've asked one group in the past year to come

1084
01:58:47,518 --> 01:58:54,363
[SPEAKER_11]: before you, I would like to make it a practice, especially on new construction projects.

1085
01:58:56,845 --> 01:59:12,057
[SPEAKER_11]: And so far, developers we're talking to are willing to do that, just the right timing and providing more definition around which projects this would apply to.

1086
01:59:14,672 --> 01:59:27,440
[SPEAKER_14]: about a language that says to provide design review feedback to developers in coordination with the Office of Planning to Development Sustainability in advance of permit filings.

1087
01:59:30,041 --> 01:59:34,104
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's great.

1088
01:59:34,184 --> 01:59:44,310
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess what I'm sort of advocating for is that as part of our holistic review of any project really,

1089
01:59:45,488 --> 02:00:11,239
[SPEAKER_15]: whether it involves a built structure or not, is that it's being reviewed not just for conformity to all the applicable codes and regulations, but that it's being considered from a design perspective and a good design and planning perspective.

1090
02:00:14,012 --> 02:00:23,000
[SPEAKER_15]: And I understand that's hard to like, you know, these are very mushy topics, but anyway, I've said enough.

1091
02:00:23,460 --> 02:00:33,449
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I was just going to say that the, you know, there are many communities that do have a design review board and that it is a formal process, but Medford doesn't have that.

1092
02:00:33,529 --> 02:00:37,653
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't think we can create it just through this recodification.

1093
02:00:37,673 --> 02:00:40,015
[SPEAKER_14]: Wouldn't that be nice?

1094
02:00:42,118 --> 02:00:44,919
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think this number five is a little bit more informal.

1095
02:00:44,959 --> 02:00:50,801
[SPEAKER_14]: It even goes a little beyond probably what our like actual role and responsibility is, but I think this language is okay.

1096
02:00:51,341 --> 02:01:01,745
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and I think if nothing else, it puts the proponents on notice that we will be thinking about it and asking questions from a design perspective.

1097
02:01:02,485 --> 02:01:10,208
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and I think it does, you know, it lays the groundwork for design review process if that's the direction the city wants to go in in the future.

1098
02:01:14,805 --> 02:01:20,107
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, the next provision is this around associate member.

1099
02:01:20,947 --> 02:01:36,592
[SPEAKER_14]: I just made a suggestion that instead of a term for the associate member, instead of a term of one year, making it a term, a three-year term consistent with the rest of the members so that we're not trying to find us a new associate members every year.

1100
02:01:36,632 --> 02:01:38,293
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that would be challenging.

1101
02:01:38,913 --> 02:01:41,554
[SPEAKER_14]: And this way, if somebody has to step off the board,

1102
02:01:43,320 --> 02:01:54,828
[SPEAKER_14]: have an associate member all the time, that's ready to can step right into that role, and then we can take our time recruiting an associate member, or the mayor can take her time recruiting an associate member.

1103
02:01:54,848 --> 02:02:01,373
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, thanks.

1104
02:02:02,454 --> 02:02:07,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Andre it's David looks, it would look like we would actually appoint the member but

1105
02:02:09,560 --> 02:02:21,465
[SPEAKER_03]: When we talked about this in connection with our draft rules, board rules, board regulations, I think we had an unsettled question about this associate member.

1106
02:02:21,505 --> 02:02:24,686
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wonder maybe Attorney Bobrowski can weigh in.

1107
02:02:25,526 --> 02:02:31,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that associate member, I think the question we were asking ourselves is, does that member appear every month?

1108
02:02:32,128 --> 02:02:35,950
[SPEAKER_03]: They sit through every meeting and they might only vote periodically or

1109
02:02:37,095 --> 02:02:39,475
[SPEAKER_03]: participate periodically, but do they always attend?

1110
02:02:39,976 --> 02:02:40,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they on call?

1111
02:02:41,476 --> 02:02:44,957
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the general practice among other municipalities?

1112
02:02:46,477 --> 02:02:53,878
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I can just jump in here quickly because I just went through a ZBA process in Brookline and there was definitely this kind of thing happening.

1113
02:02:56,339 --> 02:03:00,780
[SPEAKER_15]: I do remember, you know, he was there at almost all the meetings and

1114
02:03:02,198 --> 02:03:11,484
[SPEAKER_15]: It was made very clear at the beginning of each meeting that he was only there as a non-voting voice for that particular meeting.

1115
02:03:13,445 --> 02:03:24,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the statute is also, I'm looking at it right now, very prescriptive in terms of what they can and can't vote on.

1116
02:03:26,613 --> 02:03:28,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it just applies to special permits.

1117
02:03:32,088 --> 02:03:32,989
[SPEAKER_04]: But let me be sure.

1118
02:03:33,009 --> 02:03:43,102
[SPEAKER_14]: Whoops, Alicia, you have your hand raised.

1119
02:03:44,663 --> 02:03:45,545
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you want to jump in on this?

1120
02:03:46,790 --> 02:03:51,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so not on the voting piece, but on the appointment piece.

1121
02:03:52,114 --> 02:03:54,696
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just double checking our charter.

1122
02:03:54,716 --> 02:04:03,802
[SPEAKER_01]: The Medford City Charter says in section 52, which it's actually only about four pages long, I recommend people read it.

1123
02:04:04,842 --> 02:04:12,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Upon the adoption of plan A, all heads of departments and members of municipal boards, except the school committee,

1124
02:04:13,248 --> 02:04:31,742
[SPEAKER_01]: officials appointed by the governor and assessors, if elected by vote of the people, as their terms of office expire, shall be appointed by the mayor without confirmation by the city council, which I take to mean that if there was to be an associate member, they would have to be appointed by the mayor per our charter.

1125
02:04:31,762 --> 02:04:33,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Done.

1126
02:04:34,832 --> 02:04:37,873
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, no, yeah, I think that's right.

1127
02:04:37,913 --> 02:04:46,296
[SPEAKER_14]: I hadn't flagged this at the appointment says by the Community Development Board, but I just assumed that that was our existing language.

1128
02:04:46,376 --> 02:04:52,998
[SPEAKER_14]: I hadn't, I don't know if this was new language proposed by Attorney Borowski.

1129
02:04:54,073 --> 02:04:57,215
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe this entire section is new language.

1130
02:04:57,355 --> 02:04:59,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Attorney Brabowski, can you clarify that?

1131
02:04:59,937 --> 02:05:01,918
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably added it, yeah.

1132
02:05:02,098 --> 02:05:14,847
[SPEAKER_04]: It says in the statute, chapter 48, section nine, that a zoning ordinance may provide for associate members of a planning board when a planning board has been designated as a special permit granting authority.

1133
02:05:16,288 --> 02:05:22,652
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't say this, but it suggests that the only role for the associate member is to

1134
02:05:23,333 --> 02:05:26,576
[SPEAKER_04]: serve in this capacity when a special permit is before the board.

1135
02:05:26,996 --> 02:05:35,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, it goes on to say one associate member may be authorized when the board is five members and two may be authorized when it's more than five members.

1136
02:05:35,503 --> 02:05:42,909
[SPEAKER_04]: The city or town which establishes the position of associate members shall determine the procedure for the filling of such position.

1137
02:05:43,549 --> 02:05:49,674
[SPEAKER_04]: If provision for the filling of the position has been made, the chairman may designate an associate member to sit on the board

1138
02:05:50,193 --> 02:06:04,143
[SPEAKER_04]: for purposes of acting on a special permit application in the case of absence inability act or conflict of interest or on the part of any member of the planning board in event of vacancy on the board.

1139
02:06:04,223 --> 02:06:17,312
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a limitation here in that if you do choose to add an associate member, you fill it the way you want, but the member can only vote, the associate member can only vote on a special permit.

1140
02:06:17,712 --> 02:06:19,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, so that means site plan, for example,

1141
02:06:20,485 --> 02:06:26,630
[SPEAKER_04]: not mentioned in the statute so question can they vote on a site plan unanswered.

1142
02:06:29,541 --> 02:06:34,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Ernie, is this perhaps because you need a super majority to approve those?

1143
02:06:34,543 --> 02:06:44,827
[SPEAKER_01]: And if somebody has to step off the board for whatever reason, all those examples, it's much harder to have a super majority.

1144
02:06:44,927 --> 02:06:49,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it would be unfair to the applicant because somebody had to recuse themselves.

1145
02:06:50,629 --> 02:06:56,291
[SPEAKER_01]: The board would now have trouble forming a super majority and therefore this associate member would have the ability to step in.

1146
02:06:57,351 --> 02:06:59,072
[SPEAKER_04]: That's certainly a relevant

1147
02:06:59,910 --> 02:07:04,394
[SPEAKER_04]: consideration for example on a five member board if one person recuses him or herself.

1148
02:07:05,114 --> 02:07:07,056
[SPEAKER_04]: You need all four votes of the remainder.

1149
02:07:09,658 --> 02:07:15,263
[SPEAKER_04]: So to have an associate member, able to step in there gives you a full slate in terms of margin of error.

1150
02:07:18,085 --> 02:07:27,213
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think there's just as many occasions when there may be occasions when you can't vote because two members are recusing themselves or absent I mean,

1151
02:07:28,705 --> 02:07:33,106
[SPEAKER_04]: degree of citizen participation is different from town to town.

1152
02:07:34,067 --> 02:07:40,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I've certainly gone home a number of times pre COVID when there's three members, and I need four votes.

1153
02:07:45,370 --> 02:07:45,530
[SPEAKER_06]: So,

1154
02:07:48,010 --> 02:08:03,897
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that, in my opinion, if a person is an associate member in order for them to participate productively like on short notice to get called into a special permit vote or something else they need to be attending and listening and learning.

1155
02:08:05,458 --> 02:08:06,398
[SPEAKER_14]: to all the other meetings.

1156
02:08:06,959 --> 02:08:11,180
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's why I suggest that they be here.

1157
02:08:11,220 --> 02:08:23,285
[SPEAKER_14]: Now they can't vote, but I think it's up to us as a board to decide whether we want to allow them to participate and ask questions.

1158
02:08:23,705 --> 02:08:26,766
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think the answer should be yes, but

1159
02:08:29,380 --> 02:08:30,600
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't disagree with that.

1160
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:34,441
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another line though, and that would be to participate in deliberations.

1161
02:08:34,961 --> 02:08:42,323
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they can certainly participate prior to the close of the public hearing and then leave the deliberation to the voting members.

1162
02:08:47,824 --> 02:08:53,886
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know that I necessarily feel like that's an important distinction.

1163
02:08:53,966 --> 02:08:58,987
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, to me, I think the fact that we're involving them

1164
02:09:00,454 --> 02:09:06,535
[SPEAKER_15]: as a part of the board makes their voice important.

1165
02:09:06,775 --> 02:09:10,996
[SPEAKER_15]: And as such, I think they should be involved in everything except of course, the voting.

1166
02:09:11,556 --> 02:09:11,756
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1167
02:09:13,137 --> 02:09:15,237
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, this language doesn't have to actually speak to that.

1168
02:09:15,277 --> 02:09:25,139
[SPEAKER_14]: That's maybe that's more just our practice as a board, but to get it, I think where we do have to make a tweak here is around appointment by.

1169
02:09:25,239 --> 02:09:29,780
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think we should say the associate member shall be appointed by the mayor.

1170
02:09:34,585 --> 02:09:39,546
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't know if we want to change this since we are larger than a five member board, we could have two associate members.

1171
02:09:39,566 --> 02:09:43,948
[SPEAKER_14]: So we could say the community development board shall have not more than two associate members.

1172
02:09:47,329 --> 02:09:48,789
[SPEAKER_14]: Does anybody have an opinion about that?

1173
02:09:49,450 --> 02:09:50,710
[SPEAKER_14]: Just gives more flexibility.

1174
02:09:53,151 --> 02:09:53,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Andrea, this is Dave.

1175
02:09:53,831 --> 02:09:55,131
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be in favor of that as well.

1176
02:09:57,692 --> 02:10:00,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Having the possibility of two associate members.

1177
02:10:07,160 --> 02:10:07,640
[SPEAKER_15]: That's fine.

1178
02:10:07,900 --> 02:10:08,060
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1179
02:10:12,041 --> 02:10:18,743
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, we're short a member right now, are we?

1180
02:10:19,464 --> 02:10:21,905
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1181
02:10:22,145 --> 02:10:25,066
[SPEAKER_14]: More members means more questions and longer meetings.

1182
02:10:25,146 --> 02:10:27,086
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, we just have to balance that.

1183
02:10:28,407 --> 02:10:34,509
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I mean, I guess where I was going with is, you know, I don't think too many people

1184
02:10:35,589 --> 02:10:37,390
[SPEAKER_15]: doing this right now is the problem.

1185
02:10:42,713 --> 02:10:43,093
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1186
02:10:43,373 --> 02:10:44,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Amanda, can you scroll down?

1187
02:10:44,934 --> 02:10:45,894
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if there's any more.

1188
02:10:45,914 --> 02:10:45,954
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1189
02:10:47,475 --> 02:10:48,596
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1190
02:10:50,297 --> 02:10:56,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Any other comments or questions by board members or members of the public about the Community Development Board language?

1191
02:11:00,822 --> 02:11:01,002
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1192
02:11:01,062 --> 02:11:04,124
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't hear any, so let's keep scrolling, Amanda.

1193
02:11:08,805 --> 02:11:10,386
[SPEAKER_06]: special permit criteria.

1194
02:11:15,328 --> 02:11:28,113
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the change here David that you suggested I don't know if you want to say anything it just again taking out the neighborhood character language and incorporating a reference to the city's forthcoming comprehensive plan.

1195
02:11:30,254 --> 02:11:30,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

1196
02:11:31,515 --> 02:11:35,736
[SPEAKER_03]: And taking out the fiscal impact.

1197
02:11:38,712 --> 02:11:41,613
[SPEAKER_03]: feeling that that's not really at the same level of these other items.

1198
02:11:43,413 --> 02:11:45,093
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a discussion we've been having as well.

1199
02:11:49,174 --> 02:11:56,275
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'm fine with taking that out since we incorporated into the performance standards and there's an avenue for dealing with it there.

1200
02:11:58,836 --> 02:12:02,736
[SPEAKER_14]: But not having it as a threshold criteria.

1201
02:12:04,217 --> 02:12:05,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other board members with thoughts.

1202
02:12:10,255 --> 02:12:11,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, let's keep going then.

1203
02:12:12,556 --> 02:12:22,099
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and Amanda, you were just gonna check this, make sure this was consistent and correct, the number of days here.

1204
02:12:26,901 --> 02:12:29,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, haven't done that yet, but will do.

1205
02:12:30,542 --> 02:12:33,623
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I think there was just a question we had whether it should be 35 or 45 days.

1206
02:12:37,821 --> 02:12:41,147
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if attorney of a broski can help us out with this.

1207
02:12:42,429 --> 02:12:46,997
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking at the next section in advance of you calling it Could you repeat the question.

1208
02:12:47,999 --> 02:12:49,562
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so here on the referral.

1209
02:12:51,011 --> 02:13:04,597
[SPEAKER_14]: The city council and board of appeals shall forward any special permit application within 35 days but there was another, I think there's somewhere else in the zoning ordinance it says 45 yeah down below here 45 days.

1210
02:13:05,097 --> 02:13:12,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't think it meant 45 days is probably better, given the workload everybody has these days.

1211
02:13:13,322 --> 02:13:18,724
[SPEAKER_14]: But with 35 days, I think the question was if the 35 days is required by state statute.

1212
02:13:18,764 --> 02:13:21,926
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there's nothing in the state statute at all about site plan review.

1213
02:13:22,106 --> 02:13:27,828
[SPEAKER_04]: The only provision in the state statute about site plan review is added in the governor's recent housing bill.

1214
02:13:27,868 --> 02:13:31,950
[SPEAKER_04]: And it says that if somebody appeals a site plan review, you can ask for a bond.

1215
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:32,770
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1216
02:13:33,010 --> 02:13:37,392
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only mention of the words site plan review in the entire chapter 40A.

1217
02:13:38,646 --> 02:13:45,934
[SPEAKER_14]: But isn't this deal with special permit here, like a site plan review with a special permit.

1218
02:13:46,315 --> 02:13:47,877
[SPEAKER_04]: No, please don't know.

1219
02:13:48,157 --> 02:13:51,841
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there's no such thing as a site plan review with a special permit.

1220
02:13:52,882 --> 02:13:54,925
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was one of the major changes that we made.

1221
02:13:55,713 --> 02:14:00,115
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, but well it says, I don't know this 11.7 point four here.

1222
02:14:00,535 --> 02:14:02,016
[SPEAKER_14]: Amanda has on the screen.

1223
02:14:02,456 --> 02:14:12,061
[SPEAKER_14]: In the case of a major project which requires a special permit from the Board of Appeals or city council development board shall perform a site plan review and submit its recommendations within 45 minutes.

1224
02:14:12,381 --> 02:14:20,566
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's recommended only so it's and it's by majority vote, which means it's not a special permit.

1225
02:14:20,626 --> 02:14:25,188
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a special permit at the other special permit granting authority but when it's in front of the city

1226
02:14:25,733 --> 02:14:29,837
[SPEAKER_04]: CDB it's not a special permit it's a site plan recommendation.

1227
02:14:30,598 --> 02:14:30,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1228
02:14:35,844 --> 02:14:40,989
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's no we don't have to make that conform to the special permit timeline.

1229
02:14:41,410 --> 02:14:46,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Well if it's 45 days for one and 35 days for the other I would just make them consistent that's all.

1230
02:14:49,172 --> 02:14:53,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, Mr. Chair, can we, I just want to ask Amanda a question.

1231
02:14:54,038 --> 02:15:02,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't we need to, don't we typically give department heads 35 days to comment and therefore it would be hard

1232
02:15:03,196 --> 02:15:17,764
[SPEAKER_01]: to make a 35 or 45 day window for the meeting because there's comments come in or there's we receive it, we send it out for comment, get comments, send the comments to the boards so they have a few days to review it.

1233
02:15:18,165 --> 02:15:20,366
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes you just can't schedule it right away.

1234
02:15:20,446 --> 02:15:24,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you need a two week window to be able to schedule a meeting.

1235
02:15:25,600 --> 02:15:35,624
[SPEAKER_09]: So in my understanding, it varies a little bit depending on if the board is the special permit granting authority versus if some other entity is.

1236
02:15:35,805 --> 02:15:49,591
[SPEAKER_09]: So in the event when they're not the special permit granting authority, my understanding is actually there is that 35 day window for getting all recommendations to the SPGA.

1237
02:15:56,222 --> 02:16:01,183
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's 45 days for the Community Development Board to have the site plan review.

1238
02:16:01,203 --> 02:16:09,786
[SPEAKER_01]: While it sounds like a long time, I want to make sure it's reasonable that we're giving everybody enough time to do all the reviews.

1239
02:16:10,006 --> 02:16:13,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Because sometimes it may be like, well, you just looked at the plans, right, and wrote a letter.

1240
02:16:13,887 --> 02:16:20,909
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes a city engineer might go back and forth with an applicant a couple of times during that window.

1241
02:16:24,952 --> 02:16:29,954
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to make sure and is this section and these times this is new to our zoning.

1242
02:16:29,974 --> 02:16:39,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we had always followed everything that just state law, and not local ordinance.

1243
02:16:40,860 --> 02:16:46,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Well there's nothing in the state law about referral periods and consequences for failure to act.

1244
02:16:56,265 --> 02:17:02,868
[SPEAKER_14]: So I guess I'm not hearing that we have to change this.

1245
02:17:02,888 --> 02:17:06,990
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm fine with it as is.

1246
02:17:08,570 --> 02:17:22,156
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe we could just have the planning office double check to make sure that everything's aligned and they're not requesting a change.

1247
02:17:22,176 --> 02:17:25,518
[SPEAKER_14]: Does that sound all right?

1248
02:17:26,988 --> 02:17:28,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, we just keep it as is.

1249
02:17:28,088 --> 02:17:39,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that sound good to you, Amanda?

1250
02:17:42,473 --> 02:17:43,493
[SPEAKER_14]: You're muted, I think.

1251
02:17:43,873 --> 02:17:46,334
[SPEAKER_09]: So sorry, my dog is causing a scene.

1252
02:17:47,514 --> 02:17:48,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that sounds okay.

1253
02:17:50,155 --> 02:17:50,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thanks.

1254
02:17:56,240 --> 02:17:58,681
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's keep scrolling down.

1255
02:17:58,701 --> 02:18:03,804
[SPEAKER_14]: We talked about site plan review, I think that's fine.

1256
02:18:03,824 --> 02:18:09,747
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is a typo in the 11-7-11 language.

1257
02:18:12,608 --> 02:18:24,594
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look first at paragraph two above 11-7-5, I don't know if you have it, you don't have it.

1258
02:18:25,722 --> 02:18:27,424
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm looking at the full version.

1259
02:18:31,367 --> 02:18:53,265
[SPEAKER_04]: There were some changes that I made at the 11th hour because the land court decided a case that said, if you're going to have a direct appeal on a site plan decision by your CDB to court, which is what we're prescribing, then the matter should be accompanied by a public hearing.

1260
02:18:54,982 --> 02:18:56,663
[SPEAKER_04]: That was judge Foster at the land court.

1261
02:18:57,524 --> 02:18:58,024
[SPEAKER_04]: And I agree.

1262
02:18:58,925 --> 02:19:16,098
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you look at the full version, not the document we've been looking at in the generic section on site plan review and paragraph 11, seven, four, two, in the case of a major project, not requiring a special permit, meaning that CDB is in charge.

1263
02:19:16,979 --> 02:19:24,565
[SPEAKER_04]: It shall serve as the site plan review authority and shall conduct a public hearing in accordance with chapter 48, section 11 file it's written decision

1264
02:19:25,275 --> 02:19:30,119
[SPEAKER_04]: reached by majority vote within 90 days of the close of the public hearing.

1265
02:19:31,100 --> 02:19:52,617
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look at 11 seven 11 at the very end of the paragraph, the board shall file a written decision with the city clerk within 90 days of the close of no, it's not receipted the application.

1266
02:19:53,112 --> 02:19:56,333
[SPEAKER_04]: It's reclose within close of the public hearing.

1267
02:19:57,474 --> 02:20:04,237
[SPEAKER_04]: So that language needs to be consistent between the provision I just read and that language there.

1268
02:20:04,577 --> 02:20:10,639
[SPEAKER_04]: So the only thing you knew, scratch off of receipt of the application and put close of the public hearing.

1269
02:20:12,720 --> 02:20:14,841
[SPEAKER_06]: It's down in 11, seven, 11, Amanda.

1270
02:20:20,423 --> 02:20:22,604
[SPEAKER_06]: No, yeah, right.

1271
02:20:25,792 --> 02:20:30,116
[SPEAKER_06]: So that last after 90 days, it should say of the close of the public here.

1272
02:20:36,783 --> 02:20:39,265
[SPEAKER_06]: And I made similar changes in 11, eight.

1273
02:20:39,345 --> 02:20:40,526
[SPEAKER_14]: No, wait, no, no, no, no.

1274
02:20:40,546 --> 02:20:43,129
[SPEAKER_14]: Amanda, can you, you got to undo what you just did there.

1275
02:20:44,390 --> 02:20:45,751
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the sentence before that.

1276
02:20:45,771 --> 02:20:49,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm not looking at Amanda's handiwork here.

1277
02:20:55,202 --> 02:20:56,383
[SPEAKER_06]: close of the public hearing yet.

1278
02:21:04,530 --> 02:21:06,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, of the clothes Amanda.

1279
02:21:06,831 --> 02:21:09,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you've got it there so go back up to 90 days.

1280
02:21:11,035 --> 02:21:16,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Strike close of 90 days Yep, you got it.

1281
02:21:20,818 --> 02:21:21,058
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.

1282
02:21:21,198 --> 02:21:22,119
[SPEAKER_14]: I know it's a lot.

1283
02:21:22,379 --> 02:21:28,362
[SPEAKER_14]: You've got a lot to manage there Amanda as terms of scrolling the document and doing all the technical stuff so thank you.

1284
02:21:28,382 --> 02:21:42,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so that's the time standard for a special permit, but site plan review most importantly is not a special permit, it's regulation of the use not it's prohibition.

1285
02:21:43,550 --> 02:21:44,951
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a simple majority vote.

1286
02:21:45,937 --> 02:21:57,546
[SPEAKER_04]: And the bottom line, most people understand site plan review to mean that you can approve the site plan or approve it with conditions, but the powers of the board do not extend to saying no.

1287
02:22:02,469 --> 02:22:04,771
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the major change that I worked to this section.

1288
02:22:08,333 --> 02:22:10,575
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, any questions or comments by anyone?

1289
02:22:13,900 --> 02:22:15,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's continue down to the Dover amendment.

1290
02:22:21,843 --> 02:22:26,644
[SPEAKER_06]: So here, Attorney Bobrowski, you had a change.

1291
02:22:26,664 --> 02:22:29,865
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if you want to, I'm not sure where it is.

1292
02:22:30,245 --> 02:22:33,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me go back to my version because it's easier for me to see it.

1293
02:22:35,287 --> 02:22:36,007
[SPEAKER_04]: So here 1184,

1294
02:22:40,708 --> 02:22:48,595
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same, the board will conduct a hearing in accordance with 4811, file its written decision, reach by majority vote within 90 days after the close of the public hearing.

1295
02:22:49,635 --> 02:22:54,740
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can see that there are provisions for appeal, right?

1296
02:22:55,340 --> 02:23:07,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Which are added so that you don't wanna, if you don't have an appeal provision under your site plan regulations, the appeal is to the board of appeals when the building permit is issued or denied.

1297
02:23:07,670 --> 02:23:09,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about a bad idea.

1298
02:23:11,307 --> 02:23:18,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I don't like the board of appeals, just waiting for the building permit to be issued or denied is bad enough.

1299
02:23:18,809 --> 02:23:23,991
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a direct appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction, which means the superior court of the land court.

1300
02:23:26,532 --> 02:23:27,672
[SPEAKER_04]: But you gotta have public hearing.

1301
02:23:29,352 --> 02:23:30,513
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1302
02:23:30,753 --> 02:23:36,454
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think Amanda, there were a few questions that came in from the public on this section.

1303
02:23:36,494 --> 02:23:36,975
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that right?

1304
02:23:37,035 --> 02:23:38,055
[SPEAKER_14]: That we can want it to,

1305
02:23:39,241 --> 02:23:40,723
[SPEAKER_14]: opposed to Attorney Bobrowski?

1306
02:23:43,146 --> 02:23:47,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Vic, I feel like you had some questions lined up on this.

1307
02:23:50,179 --> 02:23:51,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1308
02:23:52,361 --> 02:23:59,168
[SPEAKER_11]: This section, we've obviously been working with Dover for a long time, but the section itself is new to the ordinance.

1309
02:23:59,208 --> 02:24:08,176
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Attorney Brabrowski, do you mind walking us through the process for an application?

1310
02:24:08,196 --> 02:24:10,578
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have a couple of clarifying questions.

1311
02:24:12,720 --> 02:24:20,386
[SPEAKER_11]: One being related to 811.8.2 when a site plan review is required.

1312
02:24:21,547 --> 02:24:37,518
[SPEAKER_11]: And reading this, I'm not sure if a project not seeking relief, so by right over use, would that project need to, would that project be subject to site plan review?

1313
02:24:37,938 --> 02:24:40,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1314
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:41,721
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it should be.

1315
02:24:42,964 --> 02:24:50,768
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so even if it's fully by right, it can receive a building permit, it should still go to site plan.

1316
02:24:51,308 --> 02:24:52,068
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it should be.

1317
02:24:53,129 --> 02:25:04,694
[SPEAKER_04]: And think of the size of some projects that are Dover related, a high school, those are still Dover related.

1318
02:25:06,635 --> 02:25:08,716
[SPEAKER_04]: So they should go through site plan review.

1319
02:25:09,236 --> 02:25:12,618
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Dover amendment provision here is designed

1320
02:25:13,710 --> 02:25:20,654
[SPEAKER_04]: to treat it a bit more leniently, at least procedurally under our law.

1321
02:25:21,735 --> 02:25:29,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Your Tufts College case, for example, says that educational institutions are not subject to site plan approval.

1322
02:25:29,700 --> 02:25:31,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's 30 years old at this point.

1323
02:25:32,402 --> 02:25:35,784
[SPEAKER_04]: The Bible Speaks case from Lenox says the same thing.

1324
02:25:35,844 --> 02:25:41,788
[SPEAKER_04]: My case, Petrucci versus Board of Appeals of Westwood says the same thing with regard to childcare facilities.

1325
02:25:42,786 --> 02:26:02,034
[SPEAKER_04]: The genesis here is that Judge Sands at the land court decided roughly 10 years ago that a Jewish cemetery, which is religiously exempt under Dover, could be made subject to site plan approval if the focus of the site plan approval was A, the scope was limited, number one, 11.8.31.

1326
02:26:02,754 --> 02:26:04,174
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, does it qualify?

1327
02:26:04,795 --> 02:26:07,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it something that's gonna be licensed as childcare?

1328
02:26:07,516 --> 02:26:09,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it truly an educational use?

1329
02:26:09,156 --> 02:26:10,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that mean it's a nonprofit?

1330
02:26:11,665 --> 02:26:25,593
[SPEAKER_04]: And then number two, the only thing that you're really doing this for is to impose those reasonable regulations concerning bulk height, if any, that are consistent with the Tufts balancing tests, which is basically, is it a legitimate government regulation?

1331
02:26:26,133 --> 02:26:29,155
[SPEAKER_04]: What will the impact be on the applicant?

1332
02:26:29,716 --> 02:26:37,040
[SPEAKER_04]: And will there be undue impact on the utility of the campus or the financial burden on the applicant?

1333
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:40,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are all written out by the SJC in the Tufts College case.

1334
02:26:41,574 --> 02:26:43,036
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that's the scope of the test.

1335
02:26:44,997 --> 02:26:45,898
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thank you.

1336
02:26:46,619 --> 02:26:52,124
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, if a project Dover use project does require relief.

1337
02:26:53,477 --> 02:26:57,998
[SPEAKER_11]: it will have to go to site plan review, through site plan review.

1338
02:26:58,658 --> 02:27:02,379
[SPEAKER_11]: Will it also then need to go to ZBA?

1339
02:27:03,340 --> 02:27:04,580
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.

1340
02:27:05,060 --> 02:27:07,401
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a one-stop process.

1341
02:27:08,061 --> 02:27:16,983
[SPEAKER_04]: The same day that the SJC reported the Tufts College case, they reported a case called Campbell versus City of Lynn, and they specifically addressed that question and said,

1342
02:27:17,703 --> 02:27:21,586
[SPEAKER_04]: If the building is non-conforming, you don't need to apply for a special permit under section six.

1343
02:27:22,126 --> 02:27:25,009
[SPEAKER_04]: If the building is deviant, you don't need to apply for a variance.

1344
02:27:25,629 --> 02:27:28,571
[SPEAKER_04]: The balancing test covers the whole matter.

1345
02:27:31,554 --> 02:27:36,678
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was representing Joe Petrucci down in Westwood, the board said I needed a special permit.

1346
02:27:36,698 --> 02:27:38,919
[SPEAKER_04]: I needed a variance and I needed site plan approval.

1347
02:27:39,020 --> 02:27:43,383
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, and I needed alteration of a non-conforming barn.

1348
02:27:44,245 --> 02:27:46,807
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, no, thank you, no, thank you, and no, thank you.

1349
02:27:46,887 --> 02:27:49,609
[SPEAKER_04]: And the case is a pretty simple one.

1350
02:27:49,669 --> 02:27:52,992
[SPEAKER_04]: The appeals court in that case ruled that we were correct, so.

1351
02:27:55,414 --> 02:28:00,617
[SPEAKER_11]: And then finally, we have denial language in here, but I think you've added some language to clarify that.

1352
02:28:00,657 --> 02:28:02,119
[SPEAKER_11]: So can you spend a minute on that?

1353
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:05,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is that if I could see it on the?

1354
02:28:08,238 --> 02:28:11,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so that's consistent with what I just said.

1355
02:28:11,861 --> 02:28:20,126
[SPEAKER_04]: You can approve, approve with conditions or deny, but the denial has to be predicated upon an application, applicant's failure to provide necessary information.

1356
02:28:20,726 --> 02:28:25,009
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right out of Prudential Insurance Company versus Board of Appeals of Westwood.

1357
02:28:25,269 --> 02:28:33,194
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a footnote in the back of the case at the appeals court that said you can impose reasonable conditions at the expense of the applicant.

1358
02:28:33,716 --> 02:28:35,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Deny it if the application is incomplete.

1359
02:28:36,138 --> 02:28:42,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the two existing powers for a CDB in this case.

1360
02:28:45,766 --> 02:28:46,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1361
02:28:46,786 --> 02:28:47,127
[SPEAKER_06]: You bet.

1362
02:28:53,792 --> 02:28:56,254
[SPEAKER_06]: If no other questions or comments, let's continue, Amanda.

1363
02:29:00,566 --> 02:29:02,587
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're back down to definitions.

1364
02:29:03,087 --> 02:29:09,790
[SPEAKER_14]: So we already talked about family, dwelling.

1365
02:29:13,692 --> 02:29:19,035
[SPEAKER_14]: David had made some suggestions, which I think make sense to try to neutralize the language.

1366
02:29:22,356 --> 02:29:23,016
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing new here.

1367
02:29:23,037 --> 02:29:24,717
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we've talked about this already.

1368
02:29:24,777 --> 02:29:25,998
[SPEAKER_14]: So why don't we continue.

1369
02:29:27,583 --> 02:29:33,766
[SPEAKER_14]: We do need to add that the Census Bureau household definition, which I think you've noted, but let's just make sure that's, there it is.

1370
02:29:33,866 --> 02:29:45,692
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thanks.

1371
02:29:46,113 --> 02:29:48,194
[SPEAKER_14]: David, you had made a comment about lodging house.

1372
02:29:48,254 --> 02:29:52,676
[SPEAKER_14]: Was there any change that you wanted to raise or?

1373
02:29:56,633 --> 02:30:03,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I think I was only trying to work the secondary degree of kinship business out of it.

1374
02:30:05,259 --> 02:30:10,382
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I think I struck that I think that could be the answer.

1375
02:30:10,802 --> 02:30:11,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, maybe.

1376
02:30:12,823 --> 02:30:26,092
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do recall also looking elsewhere in the ordinance to list the proper names of the other items that are dealt with more specifically.

1377
02:30:28,499 --> 02:30:34,882
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think when you see hotel or motel, I think I may have added that because motels address somewhere or rest home.

1378
02:30:35,622 --> 02:30:40,024
[SPEAKER_04]: In the provision before that convalescent nursing or rest home would be long-term care facility.

1379
02:30:41,525 --> 02:30:49,348
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was trying to be sensitive to where there are other definitions or how the things are defined elsewhere.

1380
02:30:50,188 --> 02:30:50,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1381
02:30:52,129 --> 02:30:55,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just go back to the, I'm going to look at the use table on my screen, so.

1382
02:30:58,810 --> 02:30:59,711
[SPEAKER_06]: just to be sure.

1383
02:31:07,376 --> 02:31:10,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, I'll catch up.

1384
02:31:11,278 --> 02:31:14,020
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have any other comments about this.

1385
02:31:14,040 --> 02:31:15,381
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if anyone else does.

1386
02:31:20,084 --> 02:31:23,766
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for reviewing all of this stuff very carefully, David, appreciate it.

1387
02:31:26,688 --> 02:31:28,249
[SPEAKER_14]: Amanda, why don't we continue down there?

1388
02:31:36,067 --> 02:31:43,233
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have a suggestion for a new definition for open storage that was suggested by a community member.

1389
02:31:45,615 --> 02:31:51,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to confirm the rest home convalescent language ought to be long term care facility.

1390
02:32:00,088 --> 02:32:00,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

1391
02:32:12,274 --> 02:32:17,077
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Amanda, you gotta finish crossing out the other ones, nursing or rest home there.

1392
02:32:20,840 --> 02:32:22,541
[SPEAKER_04]: And convalescent above that as well.

1393
02:32:23,262 --> 02:32:24,462
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, she did that one already.

1394
02:32:24,843 --> 02:32:25,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1395
02:32:25,283 --> 02:32:26,444
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on a different screen.

1396
02:32:28,765 --> 02:32:29,066
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1397
02:32:30,146 --> 02:32:30,727
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Amanda.

1398
02:32:31,067 --> 02:32:32,768
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go down.

1399
02:32:32,808 --> 02:32:37,411
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Attorney Wabrowski, so we have a suggested new definition for open storage.

1400
02:32:37,431 --> 02:32:38,372
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if you looked at that.

1401
02:32:38,852 --> 02:32:39,713
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm looking at it now.

1402
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:54,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, okay.

1403
02:32:56,542 --> 02:32:58,704
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure about the last sentence but.

1404
02:33:05,188 --> 02:33:08,550
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but I have no problem up until the last sentence.

1405
02:33:09,351 --> 02:33:09,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1406
02:33:10,368 --> 02:33:17,070
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, well maybe we should just, maybe we should cross out that last- It reminds me of our discussion on unregistered motor vehicles.

1407
02:33:17,570 --> 02:33:21,252
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think we dealt with that elsewhere, so maybe we cross that part out.

1408
02:33:21,492 --> 02:33:25,293
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, David or anybody else, do you have any thoughts about that?

1409
02:33:27,394 --> 02:33:29,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Andre, my brain was going the same place.

1410
02:33:29,855 --> 02:33:31,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought we had already addressed that elsewhere.

1411
02:33:32,236 --> 02:33:39,458
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, all right, so let's cross that out, Amanda, that last sentence in open storage, the term open storage.

1412
02:33:46,427 --> 02:34:05,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, is it the intent of the definition to limit what a viable commercial entity can store openly, meaning it's material that will be used as part of the business, or is it an attempt to stop solid waste?

1413
02:34:09,968 --> 02:34:10,468
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1414
02:34:11,009 --> 02:34:13,549
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that this was a suggestion from a community member.

1415
02:34:13,990 --> 02:34:20,772
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think you had also mentioned that the original definition needed some refining.

1416
02:34:21,452 --> 02:34:26,514
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think we'll, I mean, we would go with your recommendation on this.

1417
02:34:27,094 --> 02:34:30,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if it's going to be the former, I think you should put open commercial storage.

1418
02:34:32,096 --> 02:34:38,278
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's going to be the latter included, then I think it has to be broader where it says, or other materials.

1419
02:34:39,322 --> 02:34:52,772
[SPEAKER_04]: including and I think like, for example, I was mindful of a deer field regulation that says solid waste is anything that's not nailed down and you can't have it.

1420
02:34:53,653 --> 02:35:03,040
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a very effective tool if somebody has decided to make their property into a solid waste storage facility.

1421
02:35:06,356 --> 02:35:17,501
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's at all helpful, I have, so this came from a community member and they provided some of their logic for why they had the suggestion and I can read that out.

1422
02:35:18,442 --> 02:35:19,042
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, thank you.

1423
02:35:20,935 --> 02:35:40,398
[SPEAKER_09]: So open storage, uncovered storage in connection with a retail or wholesale establishment or storage yards in which are stored building or other materials, including without limiting the generality of the foregoing lumber, cement, electrical, heating, plumbing, refrigeration, roofing supplies and equipment.

1424
02:35:40,918 --> 02:35:49,600
[SPEAKER_09]: And as referred to in this chapter, also means a use which is completely enclosed except for necessary access and roof by an opaque wall

1425
02:35:50,295 --> 02:35:52,456
[SPEAKER_09]: or fence not less than eight feet in height.

1426
02:35:52,696 --> 02:35:59,580
[SPEAKER_09]: The term open storage shall include the standing and or parking of vehicles, trailers, and containers for more than 48 hours.

1427
02:36:00,200 --> 02:36:03,261
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they offered that recommended change in language.

1428
02:36:03,281 --> 02:36:09,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Not sure that clarified much for me.

1429
02:36:10,825 --> 02:36:15,787
[SPEAKER_09]: That's some, here, maybe I'll put this in the chat just so people can look at the language.

1430
02:36:21,058 --> 02:36:21,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Andre, David.

1431
02:36:22,139 --> 02:36:22,619
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, David.

1432
02:36:23,760 --> 02:36:28,803
[SPEAKER_03]: I just pulled up the red line draft and just searched for the term open storage.

1433
02:36:30,684 --> 02:36:35,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Assuming that that reflects the full and current draft.

1434
02:36:35,107 --> 02:36:36,068
[SPEAKER_03]: We're pretty close to it.

1435
02:36:37,249 --> 02:36:39,790
[SPEAKER_03]: It only appears in four places.

1436
02:36:39,970 --> 02:36:42,292
[SPEAKER_03]: One, maybe two where it's actually defined.

1437
02:36:43,272 --> 02:36:50,437
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, um, twice it appears in connection with screening and screening and buffer requirements.

1438
02:36:54,827 --> 02:37:01,869
[SPEAKER_03]: And that table may not be in my search.

1439
02:37:02,890 --> 02:37:03,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1440
02:37:04,850 --> 02:37:06,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me, let me, let me do that.

1441
02:37:06,271 --> 02:37:07,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang on one second.

1442
02:37:13,973 --> 02:37:17,674
[SPEAKER_12]: Mark it's under accessory uses use table.

1443
02:37:18,154 --> 02:37:18,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1444
02:37:18,955 --> 02:37:22,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's where I kind of raised my question.

1445
02:37:28,299 --> 02:37:29,720
[SPEAKER_04]: But I didn't know what it meant.

1446
02:37:29,960 --> 02:37:34,622
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this contribution is certainly a nice step forward.

1447
02:37:43,287 --> 02:37:44,567
[SPEAKER_04]: But I leave it to you.

1448
02:37:44,587 --> 02:37:50,690
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm fine with this.

1449
02:37:51,010 --> 02:37:51,931
[SPEAKER_14]: David, what do you think?

1450
02:38:00,085 --> 02:38:05,807
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, this to me seems like more of a lawyer issue, so I don't have a strong opinion about it.

1451
02:38:06,447 --> 02:38:22,492
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it's an accessory use, then we'd be empowering folks to store vehicles not in regular use, I think, if we make it part of... I think you'd have to look at the use table to see what I'm trying to do.

1452
02:38:22,512 --> 02:38:26,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm fumbling around here.

1453
02:38:30,071 --> 02:38:33,913
[SPEAKER_04]: News table, okay, open storage.

1454
02:38:42,018 --> 02:38:51,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I put no across the board with the exception of a special permit from the Board of Appeals in the BC district.

1455
02:38:53,904 --> 02:38:57,446
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's probably because it was allowed in the BC district in the old zone.

1456
02:38:57,666 --> 02:38:58,727
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me look at the old zone.

1457
02:39:10,820 --> 02:39:34,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's item 59 in your old use table and it's allowed

1458
02:39:40,838 --> 02:39:45,660
[SPEAKER_04]: by right in the district in question.

1459
02:39:47,041 --> 02:39:49,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it's allowed in two districts by right.

1460
02:39:51,323 --> 02:39:56,885
[SPEAKER_04]: If your old columns had headings on them, I could tell you what those districts are, but they don't.

1461
02:39:57,405 --> 02:39:59,946
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've got to look back till I get a heading here.

1462
02:40:05,309 --> 02:40:07,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe there's only one heading at the very beginning.

1463
02:40:12,968 --> 02:40:14,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that's the case.

1464
02:40:14,609 --> 02:40:15,829
[SPEAKER_04]: So one, two.

1465
02:40:18,571 --> 02:40:30,396
[SPEAKER_04]: So the districts in which open storage was allowed are I and C2.

1466
02:40:30,416 --> 02:40:30,676
[SPEAKER_04]: I and C2.

1467
02:40:51,062 --> 02:40:55,703
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's as it is in the use table draft that I'm looking at.

1468
02:40:58,183 --> 02:41:01,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's as it is in the old ordinance use table.

1469
02:41:02,564 --> 02:41:05,044
[SPEAKER_11]: And the new, in the current draft.

1470
02:41:05,545 --> 02:41:07,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah, so I just repeated it.

1471
02:41:08,945 --> 02:41:10,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I make a special permit?

1472
02:41:13,166 --> 02:41:14,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it say BA or does it say Y?

1473
02:41:15,686 --> 02:41:17,827
[SPEAKER_11]: It says Y, it's allowed in both C2 and I.

1474
02:41:20,749 --> 02:41:22,209
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's so that's what you have.

1475
02:41:22,449 --> 02:41:23,710
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's a good idea.

1476
02:41:24,770 --> 02:41:28,231
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't necessarily want to encourage you to repeat it.

1477
02:41:31,352 --> 02:41:34,132
[SPEAKER_14]: Your suggestion would be to make that a special permit.

1478
02:41:35,373 --> 02:41:35,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.

1479
02:41:36,453 --> 02:41:37,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, at a minimum.

1480
02:41:39,094 --> 02:41:47,916
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know enough about the districts in question to answer, whether they should.

1481
02:41:49,862 --> 02:42:02,506
[SPEAKER_14]: be appropriate whether they're appropriate so well I'm fine with that why don't we make that by special permit, is there.

1482
02:42:02,766 --> 02:42:15,549
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the board members have an opinion is that it's, it would be not addressing vehicles, it would just be the building materials, if you will.

1483
02:42:16,570 --> 02:42:16,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1484
02:42:17,710 --> 02:42:17,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1485
02:42:20,135 --> 02:42:26,681
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, I would be in favor of that then, because it does appear that the vehicles are addressed separately.

1486
02:42:28,483 --> 02:42:40,154
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I guess, unless, I mean, this is not a rabbit hole I wanted to go down or ever intended going down on this, but when we say open storage, are they also referring to like car dealerships?

1487
02:42:41,336 --> 02:42:43,558
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that what he's trying to get at with this sentence here?

1488
02:42:44,462 --> 02:42:47,624
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the more specific controls the general.

1489
02:42:47,764 --> 02:42:51,546
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a specific entry for car dealerships that would control.

1490
02:42:51,566 --> 02:42:52,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1491
02:42:54,248 --> 02:43:03,413
[SPEAKER_14]: Then I think let's just, let's just recommend that they'd be special permit in those two districts that they already are by right and leave it at that.

1492
02:43:03,433 --> 02:43:06,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1493
02:43:12,396 --> 02:43:16,677
[SPEAKER_14]: And then there was, I guess, another community member question about parking garage and the language here.

1494
02:43:17,057 --> 02:43:18,938
[SPEAKER_14]: No specific recommendation.

1495
02:43:18,958 --> 02:43:24,959
[SPEAKER_14]: I think in that case, I've left it up to you.

1496
02:43:26,359 --> 02:43:27,500
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1497
02:43:27,560 --> 02:43:33,541
[SPEAKER_14]: Attorney Mabrowski, do you have any, I mean, this is, is this your language or is this existing language?

1498
02:43:33,561 --> 02:43:37,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Parking garage or parking area residential?

1499
02:43:59,445 --> 02:44:01,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's in your existing ordinance.

1500
02:44:02,226 --> 02:44:02,526
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1501
02:44:03,466 --> 02:44:07,287
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have any change here.

1502
02:44:07,327 --> 02:44:08,648
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if anybody else does.

1503
02:44:08,668 --> 02:44:10,248
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm fine leaving it the way that it is.

1504
02:44:13,689 --> 02:44:15,669
[SPEAKER_14]: There's not a specific problem that we're solving.

1505
02:44:15,709 --> 02:44:18,310
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't wanna try to solve.

1506
02:44:22,631 --> 02:44:27,173
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we already talked with building commissioner Moki about the half story.

1507
02:44:27,333 --> 02:44:27,873
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think,

1508
02:44:30,045 --> 02:44:33,206
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't hear anybody raise a question or concern about that.

1509
02:44:33,666 --> 02:44:34,447
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we okay with that?

1510
02:44:39,069 --> 02:44:40,329
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let's continue then.

1511
02:44:40,349 --> 02:44:46,972
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have a concern about it per se.

1512
02:44:46,992 --> 02:44:55,875
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a worry in my mind that

1513
02:45:01,662 --> 02:45:24,207
[SPEAKER_15]: the way that it's written could possibly allow for a more aggressive form of roof sculpture in Medford.

1514
02:45:27,128 --> 02:45:47,064
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, but without like actually like digging in and just really thinking about how, what the impact of that is, I can't really, but it, but there, I, there's certainly a, it's triggered a concern in my mind that this somehow may allow, um,

1515
02:45:55,057 --> 02:46:17,430
[SPEAKER_15]: a type of construction that is much more conspicuous and less in fitting with the character of the neighborhood than we already have.

1516
02:46:18,251 --> 02:46:20,232
[SPEAKER_15]: And that does cause me a little bit of concern.

1517
02:46:22,509 --> 02:46:41,179
[SPEAKER_15]: I should say that I just went through this process myself on my own home, where it was a real challenge to make this work and make it meet the requirements.

1518
02:46:43,120 --> 02:46:50,244
[SPEAKER_15]: And I worry that this new stating of the law would be less restrictive and allow for things that

1519
02:46:52,534 --> 02:46:59,059
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we're less in keeping with the character of the neighborhoods.

1520
02:47:01,741 --> 02:47:05,223
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know that I have a solution though, but I just wanted to state that.

1521
02:47:11,548 --> 02:47:13,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody else have a thought about that?

1522
02:47:18,972 --> 02:47:29,055
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I see where you're coming from class I'm inclined to accept the building commissioners record and recommended language just because I don't think we can come up with something better right now.

1523
02:47:31,216 --> 02:47:39,939
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, potentially it's something we should flag or the planning staff can flag for the comp plan.

1524
02:47:41,722 --> 02:47:56,991
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I think one way to think about this would be to research what adjacent towns are doing.

1525
02:47:57,691 --> 02:48:10,459
[SPEAKER_15]: What does this kind of thing look like in Cambridge or Brookline or in places where residents are very sensitive to construction

1526
02:48:12,268 --> 02:48:16,011
[SPEAKER_15]: and historic character of neighborhoods.

1527
02:48:18,873 --> 02:48:24,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Chairman, as I, excuse me, but as I alerted you last time, I've got to jump to another Zoom meeting.

1528
02:48:24,817 --> 02:48:25,597
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to do that.

1529
02:48:25,617 --> 02:48:31,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to, I want to take a break for five minutes before I go roughly 65 miles South.

1530
02:48:33,674 --> 02:48:35,516
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, understood.

1531
02:48:35,676 --> 02:48:37,338
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much, Attorney Bobrowski.

1532
02:48:37,418 --> 02:48:38,919
[SPEAKER_14]: We appreciate all the time you put in.

1533
02:48:38,959 --> 02:48:40,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I'm so sorry to interrupt.

1534
02:48:41,041 --> 02:48:42,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a quick question.

1535
02:48:42,643 --> 02:48:56,316
[SPEAKER_09]: If we decide to collectively continue, which we might not do, it might be good just to have a couple of dates from you, Mark, if you're available for one more meeting.

1536
02:48:56,336 --> 02:48:57,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Throw out a date.

1537
02:48:58,217 --> 02:49:00,241
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let me pull it here.

1538
02:49:00,261 --> 02:49:03,347
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we had, there was the 26th of January.

1539
02:49:09,711 --> 02:49:13,454
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, let me just interrupt, because I do think we're going to finish this tonight.

1540
02:49:13,814 --> 02:49:14,715
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we should.

1541
02:49:15,335 --> 02:49:16,936
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I don't even want to go down that road.

1542
02:49:16,976 --> 02:49:18,798
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know Mark has to jump off.

1543
02:49:18,838 --> 02:49:19,799
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's not do this.

1544
02:49:19,959 --> 02:49:21,840
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do need the 26th, that is open.

1545
02:49:22,261 --> 02:49:24,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Assuming we start early, I can do it on that night.

1546
02:49:24,262 --> 02:49:25,783
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm rooting for you, Mr. Chairman.

1547
02:49:27,104 --> 02:49:29,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to all of you for your attention.

1548
02:49:30,507 --> 02:49:30,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mark.

1549
02:49:30,907 --> 02:49:31,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks a lot.

1550
02:49:31,468 --> 02:49:31,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye bye.

1551
02:49:31,868 --> 02:49:32,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye bye.

1552
02:49:36,319 --> 02:49:44,543
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and so board members, if we do have to go over a little bit, is everybody okay with maybe 10 more minutes, but let's, I think we're close to the end of wrapping up.

1553
02:49:47,144 --> 02:49:47,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1554
02:49:48,785 --> 02:50:02,151
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe this is something that the planning staff, uh, even if it gets before the, maybe before it even gets to the city council, if you guys want to do any more research on this, uh, to try to improve that language with building commissioner Moki and

1555
02:50:02,854 --> 02:50:06,737
[SPEAKER_14]: and indicate to the city council a better language, that's fine.

1556
02:50:06,817 --> 02:50:11,561
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think we'll adopt for right now the building commissioner's language.

1557
02:50:14,624 --> 02:50:22,530
[SPEAKER_14]: I do know that Alicia is thinking about addressing this issue more comprehensively down the road in a policy way.

1558
02:50:26,448 --> 02:50:33,373
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's continuing add the adult use marijuana establishments in the use table that makes sense because now it's a use.

1559
02:50:38,918 --> 02:50:50,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Victor, Director of Economic Development, can you just explain where things landed with the convenience retail and neighborhood retail based on the question that was raised last time?

1560
02:50:50,587 --> 02:50:53,609
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the square footage was very large.

1561
02:50:55,599 --> 02:50:56,601
[SPEAKER_14]: You looked into that some more.

1562
02:50:57,462 --> 02:51:05,775
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, happy to we talked about it as a staff, and we suggested some adjustments here in purple or red, I believe.

1563
02:51:06,416 --> 02:51:10,603
[SPEAKER_11]: So, based on your conversations and actually

1564
02:51:11,330 --> 02:51:18,556
[SPEAKER_11]: conversations with, I think, with the council before it got to you all.

1565
02:51:18,576 --> 02:51:29,004
[SPEAKER_11]: The thought was to continue to allow small neighborhood retail, the corner stores in residential areas.

1566
02:51:29,704 --> 02:51:34,268
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think we all agreed that the scale of those stores was a little out of whack.

1567
02:51:34,288 --> 02:51:38,171
[SPEAKER_11]: So we looked at a couple around town.

1568
02:51:40,476 --> 02:51:46,574
[SPEAKER_11]: And think that the neighborhood read the size of neighborhood retail should be up to 2500 square feet.

1569
02:51:49,003 --> 02:51:50,324
[SPEAKER_11]: That seems more reasonable.

1570
02:51:51,344 --> 02:52:08,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Then resize the convenience retail, which is in the middle between neighborhood and what we might think of as a midsize small box retailer, between 2,500, so just over 2,501 foot to 5,000 square feet.

1571
02:52:15,217 --> 02:52:23,442
[SPEAKER_11]: And then retail sales would take care of everything above that square footage, 5,000 and above.

1572
02:52:24,902 --> 02:52:32,807
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the one question, so if that kind of fits more with what people were thinking, certainly happy to talk through that.

1573
02:52:32,987 --> 02:52:38,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, where are we allowing these uses?

1574
02:52:38,970 --> 02:52:39,891
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have

1575
02:52:42,978 --> 02:52:52,422
[SPEAKER_11]: For neighborhood retail and convenience retail, they're by special permit city council in the apartment districts.

1576
02:52:54,363 --> 02:53:07,528
[SPEAKER_11]: But in SF2 for convenience retail, neighborhood retail is currently allowed in SF1, and special permit

1577
02:53:08,972 --> 02:53:17,619
[SPEAKER_11]: or site plan review and SF2, and then special permit city council in apartment one, two, three, and allowed in the commercial districts.

1578
02:53:19,500 --> 02:53:29,908
[SPEAKER_11]: So the remaining question would be, do we want to make the neighborhood retail by site plan review and the SF1?

1579
02:53:32,070 --> 02:53:35,012
[SPEAKER_11]: It's getting late, I'm sorry if that was long winded.

1580
02:53:35,537 --> 02:53:40,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think my suggestion on this, it makes, thank you for your, the recommendation.

1581
02:53:40,160 --> 02:53:44,903
[SPEAKER_14]: And I appreciate the fact that I think these sizes make a lot more sense in class.

1582
02:53:44,943 --> 02:53:54,769
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you had raised that so you can weigh in in a moment, but I do, I do think that just allowing it as a right in single family districts would be problematic.

1583
02:53:54,829 --> 02:53:59,172
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd recommend making that a special permit for SF1 and SF2.

1584
02:54:00,192 --> 02:54:17,305
[SPEAKER_14]: the neighborhood retail, because I think there should be some level of approval since we're talking about, you know, we don't just want to have single family homes that get converted their first floor into a convenience store and maybe making it easier in some of the other ones.

1585
02:54:17,905 --> 02:54:18,986
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know.

1586
02:54:20,667 --> 02:54:21,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Andre, just one.

1587
02:54:22,554 --> 02:54:38,886
[SPEAKER_11]: clarifying point, I think this goes without saying, but say if, for example, people's food mart would change hands and a new neighborhood retailer would locate in people's food mart, they would not need to go for site plan review.

1588
02:54:39,506 --> 02:54:42,208
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be allowed by right under zoning.

1589
02:54:47,492 --> 02:54:48,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a question to me?

1590
02:54:48,573 --> 02:54:50,374
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a statement.

1591
02:54:50,954 --> 02:54:51,595
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, okay.

1592
02:54:54,768 --> 02:55:00,652
[SPEAKER_14]: Right so existing uses would be essentially grandfathered if the property were to change hands.

1593
02:55:03,894 --> 02:55:04,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

1594
02:55:07,136 --> 02:55:07,857
[SPEAKER_14]: Class do you want to.

1595
02:55:08,497 --> 02:55:09,298
[SPEAKER_14]: You have thoughts about this.

1596
02:55:10,078 --> 02:55:24,408
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I think this is a much better set of numbers than we saw last time so thank you have a thought thought about the, the permit like for single family SF one and to make that special permit.

1597
02:55:29,197 --> 02:55:30,438
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that for the larger stores?

1598
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:40,927
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now it's the larger stores are not allowed in the single family one and they are allowed by special permit city council in SF2.

1599
02:55:41,407 --> 02:55:48,894
[SPEAKER_14]: The small stores are currently, the proposal is to make it not allowed to allowed by right, a why.

1600
02:55:50,328 --> 02:55:55,489
[SPEAKER_14]: in SF1 and then in SF2 site plan, allow them by site plan review.

1601
02:55:55,529 --> 02:56:05,452
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm suggesting that maybe we make it special permit because I think it could be pretty controversial if we just change it to make it allowed.

1602
02:56:05,472 --> 02:56:07,312
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's a big policy change.

1603
02:56:08,032 --> 02:56:09,073
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I think I agree.

1604
02:56:13,194 --> 02:56:17,755
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, especially now, like doing something like that before the special part, before the comp plan review.

1605
02:56:19,433 --> 02:56:25,717
[SPEAKER_14]: I think maybe we go gently on the use plan changes or the use table changes.

1606
02:56:26,458 --> 02:56:31,822
[SPEAKER_14]: And then later there'll be more time to change the map and adjust.

1607
02:56:34,644 --> 02:56:35,124
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1608
02:56:35,284 --> 02:56:40,208
[SPEAKER_15]: My main concern last time was the sizes of, but these are, they seem much better.

1609
02:56:40,228 --> 02:56:45,091
[SPEAKER_14]: David, you're unmuted.

1610
02:56:45,111 --> 02:56:46,232
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if you wanted to say anything.

1611
02:56:46,940 --> 02:56:59,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I agree with where you both of you landed on the SF one SF two I, I know you want to complete our mission tonight but I guess I'm having a hard time understanding why these aren't allowed.

1612
02:57:00,744 --> 02:57:06,886
[SPEAKER_03]: More generally in the apartment districts but as you said we can, we can discuss that another day.

1613
02:57:08,467 --> 02:57:10,927
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, no David I totally agree with you.

1614
02:57:10,947 --> 02:57:11,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1615
02:57:15,021 --> 02:57:15,441
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree.

1616
02:57:15,521 --> 02:57:35,972
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess I'm just thinking that we, I mean, we could make that recommendation now, if you feel confident in like figuring that out, which districts, but I just think that looking at the uses and the map and that should, you know, wait for the comp plan for the most part.

1617
02:57:36,792 --> 02:57:37,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're right.

1618
02:57:37,372 --> 02:57:40,374
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beyond the scope of what we said we were going to attempt to accomplish.

1619
02:57:40,414 --> 02:57:42,415
[SPEAKER_03]: So I agree, but I'm still puzzled.

1620
02:57:44,649 --> 02:57:46,229
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, no, I agree with what you say.

1621
02:57:46,249 --> 02:57:47,730
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that should be changed, made easier.

1622
02:57:50,311 --> 02:57:59,733
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I- It might help to know that there's no retail allowed in those apartment districts, like any kinds at this moment.

1623
02:57:59,793 --> 02:58:07,676
[SPEAKER_01]: So turning them into mixed uses, it's a bigger change, not that we don't think maybe it's the right way to go.

1624
02:58:07,696 --> 02:58:09,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Got it.

1625
02:58:09,516 --> 02:58:10,216
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Alicia.

1626
02:58:10,256 --> 02:58:10,797
[SPEAKER_14]: That's helpful.

1627
02:58:11,197 --> 02:58:12,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Klaas, you were gonna say something?

1628
02:58:13,177 --> 02:58:23,322
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I was just gonna say in those apartment use districts, encouraging mixed use is frankly important.

1629
02:58:24,103 --> 02:58:29,825
[SPEAKER_15]: But if it's something that needs to be pushed to later, I'm fine with that.

1630
02:58:29,886 --> 02:58:38,530
[SPEAKER_15]: But I would definitely agree that not allowing them is not right, is not smart.

1631
02:58:40,077 --> 02:58:48,710
[SPEAKER_14]: So at least this is an, it represents an incremental step forward, not allowed now, but right now, now we're, we'll be allowing them by special permit under this re-codification.

1632
02:58:48,790 --> 02:58:54,819
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe we can go further later, but for now, I think this is probably what we can do.

1633
02:58:57,178 --> 02:58:59,360
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to raise one thing.

1634
02:58:59,380 --> 02:59:04,083
[SPEAKER_01]: These smaller stores are really much smaller businesses.

1635
02:59:04,123 --> 02:59:05,484
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not big developments.

1636
02:59:06,044 --> 02:59:13,550
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm concerned that sending them to city council means they actually have to go to site plan review with this board and then the city council.

1637
02:59:14,050 --> 02:59:16,452
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's asking a lot of a really small business.

1638
02:59:17,112 --> 02:59:25,358
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wonder if, at least that's my assumption, if it would be better if they just were special permit through the planning board.

1639
02:59:28,208 --> 02:59:33,612
[SPEAKER_01]: So there wasn't any, at least the residential ones.

1640
02:59:35,353 --> 02:59:39,976
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, there wasn't, because what the consideration really is, is the feel for it.

1641
02:59:40,156 --> 02:59:42,138
[SPEAKER_01]: And this can become so political.

1642
02:59:42,838 --> 02:59:45,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that goes in front of city council can be so political.

1643
02:59:45,520 --> 02:59:53,066
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd hate for people who are trying to start up a small business to get approved or denied because of political reasons.

1644
02:59:54,587 --> 02:59:57,669
[SPEAKER_14]: So we could, what would the, instead of the CC, what would it be?

1645
03:00:00,462 --> 03:00:04,143
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just looking at the rest of our table as it exists.

1646
03:00:07,283 --> 03:00:09,504
[SPEAKER_01]: And my recommendation would be planning board.

1647
03:00:11,604 --> 03:00:13,364
[SPEAKER_01]: The only other option is board of appeals.

1648
03:00:15,425 --> 03:00:22,166
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm certainly fine with replacing the CCs and the residential districts with PVs for these two uses.

1649
03:00:25,126 --> 03:00:29,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember what initials we use.

1650
03:00:33,129 --> 03:00:35,270
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I think that's right the way Amanda has it there.

1651
03:00:38,492 --> 03:00:44,395
[SPEAKER_14]: So, but Amanda do you want to make it, I guess replace it for all of them.

1652
03:00:48,517 --> 03:00:54,660
[SPEAKER_01]: I will just remind you, it's a recommendation, if the city council says, actually we think they should come to us.

1653
03:00:55,321 --> 03:00:56,702
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they can do that.

1654
03:01:03,203 --> 03:01:03,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1655
03:01:06,346 --> 03:01:12,973
[SPEAKER_06]: And Alicia, do you have thoughts about then the slightly larger convenience retail?

1656
03:01:14,575 --> 03:01:16,357
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think that's also appropriate for that one?

1657
03:01:18,408 --> 03:01:20,129
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of do.

1658
03:01:20,329 --> 03:01:22,210
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just looking at the notes.

1659
03:01:22,511 --> 03:01:45,885
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use some examples to help us understand things that were between 2,500 and 5,000 square feet that exist, include Alexander's on Main Street, Oasis, and then actually Bob's and the People's Food Mart and Jim's Market were all under 2,500 square feet.

1660
03:01:51,163 --> 03:01:56,486
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the five, the 2500 to 5000 aren't tiny, but they're not developers.

1661
03:01:58,066 --> 03:01:58,226
Yeah.

1662
03:01:59,027 --> 03:02:06,410
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, why don't we change all these those CCS then just to PB and, and then we can, you know, city council can take it or leave it.

1663
03:02:07,423 --> 03:02:07,563
Right.

1664
03:02:08,084 --> 03:02:21,419
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say I actually agree with you that they should all go to planning board, because the idea is not to allow a tiny, like a Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks in every residential neighborhood, although Medford residents could probably be talked into that.

1665
03:02:22,380 --> 03:02:24,943
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there is an intention that these are

1666
03:02:26,224 --> 03:02:36,391
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits to the neighborhoods, you know, and that the planning board should have some say or somebody should have a say in not one on every corner, right?

1667
03:02:36,411 --> 03:02:38,833
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what's the appropriate density?

1668
03:02:39,453 --> 03:02:41,034
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so Alicia, let me introduce you here.

1669
03:02:41,154 --> 03:02:51,921
[SPEAKER_14]: So I know that we're losing a board member at eight o'clock and I know Jackie has to go and she is already a little over so I have to leave too.

1670
03:02:51,961 --> 03:02:52,782
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to pick up my kid.

1671
03:02:53,670 --> 03:02:56,972
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, are we, Amanda, can we just scroll down?

1672
03:02:57,092 --> 03:02:58,493
[SPEAKER_14]: You know that you can change those.

1673
03:03:00,754 --> 03:03:14,121
[SPEAKER_14]: I think these other questions, the ones that we're not going to deal with, I was reviewing those with the planning staff earlier, and I think that those are policy changes that are out of our scope right now.

1674
03:03:15,521 --> 03:03:22,725
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're not gonna deal with, I guess, the three-story issue either.

1675
03:03:23,712 --> 03:03:25,453
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think we're down at the bottom.

1676
03:03:25,513 --> 03:03:38,379
[SPEAKER_14]: And then this last change is just a technical change that recommended by the planning staff to bring it more in line with what those heights, the existing heights actually allow in terms of stories.

1677
03:03:39,780 --> 03:03:42,041
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm fine right now.

1678
03:03:42,081 --> 03:03:43,141
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we've finished.

1679
03:03:43,181 --> 03:03:49,685
[SPEAKER_14]: If we want to take a vote on sending these recommendations to the city council and then allow the

1680
03:03:51,194 --> 03:03:57,839
[SPEAKER_14]: allow empower me as chair just to review them with the planning staff once we have the final language.

1681
03:03:58,780 --> 03:04:01,962
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we'd then be ready for a vote, but what do you all think about that?

1682
03:04:01,982 --> 03:04:13,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Audrey, that sounds good to me.

1683
03:04:14,231 --> 03:04:15,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, sounds good to me as well.

1684
03:04:16,513 --> 03:04:16,913
[SPEAKER_15]: Me too.

1685
03:04:18,995 --> 03:04:19,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Me too.

1686
03:04:20,773 --> 03:04:24,155
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and I think we have, is there a motion on the floor?

1687
03:04:24,175 --> 03:04:27,496
[SPEAKER_09]: I am so sorry to interrupt.

1688
03:04:27,676 --> 03:04:28,677
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have a question.

1689
03:04:29,277 --> 03:04:37,501
[SPEAKER_09]: There were some comments that came in from the public that were more general and or touched on things that were dealt with in past meetings.

1690
03:04:38,802 --> 03:04:45,085
[SPEAKER_09]: I do kind of feel like they should be read into the record before any vote is made.

1691
03:04:45,998 --> 03:04:47,580
[SPEAKER_08]: How many comments do you have, Amanda?

1692
03:04:48,520 --> 03:04:50,783
[SPEAKER_09]: I have two.

1693
03:04:50,803 --> 03:04:53,685
[SPEAKER_14]: We could do them quickly.

1694
03:04:53,705 --> 03:04:57,529
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to lose two board members, and then I don't think we have a quorum.

1695
03:04:57,749 --> 03:04:58,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1696
03:04:58,250 --> 03:04:58,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1697
03:04:58,990 --> 03:04:59,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1698
03:04:59,951 --> 03:05:10,621
[SPEAKER_09]: One from William Navar, and just in summary, had some thoughts on William Navar, 108 Medford Street, number 1B, had some thoughts on parking minimum provisions.

1699
03:05:12,433 --> 03:05:18,816
[SPEAKER_09]: So the reduced parking requirement near high frequency transit should include locations where multiple bus lines converge or nearly converge.

1700
03:05:20,217 --> 03:05:29,961
[SPEAKER_09]: And then number two, in the event that the parking minimum is one space for some development, that project should be entirely excused from the parking minimum if either the following conditions apply.

1701
03:05:29,981 --> 03:05:37,885
[SPEAKER_09]: The property has no suitable curb cut and would need to be installed, or if the property has a curb cut, but the developer is willing to remove it.

1702
03:05:39,721 --> 03:05:54,289
[SPEAKER_09]: The second comment is from Sharon Wentworth, 694 Winthrop Street, and she had some concerns about daycares and permitting around daycares.

1703
03:05:54,629 --> 03:05:59,111
[SPEAKER_09]: She feels that they should be required for larger daycares.

1704
03:06:07,285 --> 03:06:11,849
[SPEAKER_09]: There's supposed to be enough parking for 10 cars in a residential area and driveways are supposed to be restricted.

1705
03:06:11,989 --> 03:06:13,510
[SPEAKER_09]: So how are we accommodating that?

1706
03:06:15,051 --> 03:06:17,773
[SPEAKER_09]: What if the state changes the definition of large daycares?

1707
03:06:18,433 --> 03:06:19,114
[SPEAKER_09]: What happens then?

1708
03:06:19,794 --> 03:06:28,981
[SPEAKER_09]: And the home across from my home was renovated for the entire home to accommodate the daycare, shouldn't the home be a percentage of the daycare and not a business in an S1 zone?

1709
03:06:30,822 --> 03:06:31,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the comments.

1710
03:06:35,918 --> 03:06:41,779
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel that we've, you know, we did discuss extensively both the parking and the daycare issue.

1711
03:06:41,799 --> 03:06:51,002
[SPEAKER_14]: So unless somebody feels that they wanna revisit it, I think we go with our recommendations.

1712
03:06:54,523 --> 03:06:56,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I'm seeing nodding heads.

1713
03:06:56,143 --> 03:07:03,325
[SPEAKER_14]: So is there a motion on the floor to send our, to finalize our recommendations with,

1714
03:07:07,485 --> 03:07:11,248
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess, endorsement from... Yeah, go ahead, David, you do it.

1715
03:07:11,348 --> 03:07:12,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Andre, let me give it a try.

1716
03:07:12,949 --> 03:07:36,105
[SPEAKER_03]: A motion to approve this set of recommendations, subject to a delegation of authority to you to work with city staff to finalize some of the final language that's needed, and to confirm that the final document submitted to the city council conforms with the board's

1717
03:07:39,128 --> 03:07:41,509
[SPEAKER_03]: discussions, deliberations, and decisions.

1718
03:07:44,350 --> 03:07:45,170
[SPEAKER_14]: Beautifully stated.

1719
03:07:46,371 --> 03:07:47,051
[SPEAKER_15]: I will second.

1720
03:07:48,171 --> 03:07:49,432
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Klaus.

1721
03:07:49,612 --> 03:07:50,312
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll call vote.

1722
03:07:50,672 --> 03:07:51,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Klaus Andreasen?

1723
03:07:52,973 --> 03:07:53,193
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1724
03:07:54,874 --> 03:07:55,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Deanna Peabody?

1725
03:07:56,494 --> 03:07:56,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1726
03:07:57,695 --> 03:07:58,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Christy Dowd?

1727
03:07:59,115 --> 03:07:59,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1728
03:08:00,436 --> 03:08:01,136
[SPEAKER_14]: David Blumberg?

1729
03:08:01,656 --> 03:08:01,856
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1730
03:08:02,756 --> 03:08:03,537
[SPEAKER_14]: Jackie Furtado?

1731
03:08:04,137 --> 03:08:04,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1732
03:08:05,183 --> 03:08:06,103
[SPEAKER_14]: and I'm a yes as well.

1733
03:08:06,584 --> 03:08:07,824
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just want to thank everybody.

1734
03:08:07,844 --> 03:08:11,165
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you guys got to go amazing work.

1735
03:08:11,325 --> 03:08:13,066
[SPEAKER_14]: This was a lot to dig into.

1736
03:08:13,706 --> 03:08:17,847
[SPEAKER_14]: So hopefully we won't have three hour meetings next time.

1737
03:08:17,868 --> 03:08:21,549
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1738
03:08:21,849 --> 03:08:25,790
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion to adjourn to close the public hearing?

1739
03:08:26,431 --> 03:08:28,571
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I guess we should have closed the public hearing originally.

1740
03:08:29,051 --> 03:08:32,813
[SPEAKER_14]: So I will, I think that was incorporated into David's

1741
03:08:34,137 --> 03:08:37,320
[SPEAKER_14]: David's motion implicitly.

1742
03:08:38,040 --> 03:08:40,022
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

1743
03:08:43,285 --> 03:08:44,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, motion to adjourn.

1744
03:08:44,766 --> 03:08:46,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Deanna, do you second?

1745
03:08:46,247 --> 03:08:46,968
[SPEAKER_14]: David, I'll second.

1746
03:08:47,628 --> 03:08:48,229
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, David.

1747
03:08:48,569 --> 03:08:49,290
[SPEAKER_14]: Cles Andreson?

1748
03:08:50,471 --> 03:08:50,591
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1749
03:08:50,611 --> 03:08:52,232
