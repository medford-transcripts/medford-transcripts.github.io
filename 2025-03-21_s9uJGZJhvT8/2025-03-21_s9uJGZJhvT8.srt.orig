00:00:52,277 --> 00:00:53,278
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to take subcommittee report.

26
00:00:59,022 --> 00:01:03,563
[SPEAKER_15]: up before the council relative to the community garden commission appointment of the city council, Mr. President.

27
00:01:03,843 --> 00:01:04,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, indeed.

28
00:01:04,643 --> 00:01:25,708
[SPEAKER_02]: So this evening at 645, the Medford City Council met in committee of the whole to consider the candidate for the council's appointment to the new, newly ordained garden commission that's going to deal with the new victory garden or community garden on Winthrop Street.

29
00:01:26,388 --> 00:01:26,988
[SPEAKER_02]: The council's

30
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:35,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Candidate is Frederick Lasky, and he met with a unanimous approval in our- I'm sorry.

31
00:01:40,657 --> 00:01:41,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry?

32
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:42,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Whenever you're done, I'm sorry.

33
00:01:42,838 --> 00:01:43,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

34
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:46,381
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Councilor Camuso, go ahead.

35
00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:47,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

36
00:01:49,207 --> 00:01:58,192
[SPEAKER_08]: As we are all aware, we just met, and I joined my council colleague, Councilor Robert Penta, over the past three weeks.

37
00:01:59,593 --> 00:02:07,117
[SPEAKER_08]: And we brought the name forward of Frederick Lasky as a member of the guiding commission to represent this honorable body.

38
00:02:07,758 --> 00:02:16,422
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm happy to say that it was a unanimous vote of the Medford City Council at the meeting, and I'd just like to make a motion to approve it.

39
00:02:17,892 --> 00:02:21,134
[SPEAKER_08]: on behalf of Councilor Penta, myself and the Medford City Council.

40
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:22,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Musso.

41
00:02:23,495 --> 00:02:28,998
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the motion of approved by Councilor Musso, did anybody need to speak on this?

42
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:31,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Penta?

43
00:02:32,741 --> 00:02:41,365
[SPEAKER_07]: I think when we look around our community and we decide to have people serve on particular boards and commissions, it becomes very important that the people are involved within our community.

44
00:02:41,405 --> 00:02:43,967
[SPEAKER_07]: And Fred Lasky most definitely is involved in our community.

45
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:54,888
[SPEAKER_07]: not only as a former school committee person, as a former Boy Scout leader, but also as years in government and also as years in working here within our community and participating in many, many functions.

46
00:02:55,688 --> 00:03:06,498
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's what a nice, decent piece of honor to not only represent the fact that I would like to co-sponsor with Councilor Camuso, the appointment of Mr. Lasky.

47
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:10,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think it's, it's another good turn for our city as we move forward in a positive way.

48
00:03:11,422 --> 00:03:11,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

49
00:03:13,802 --> 00:03:14,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, thank you.

50
00:03:14,462 --> 00:03:16,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Counselor, uh, Penta.

51
00:03:16,183 --> 00:03:22,467
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the motion for approval by counselors, uh, Camuso and Penta roll call, a roll call vote has been requested.

52
00:03:22,507 --> 00:03:24,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

53
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:42,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Camuso, Frederick Lasky, Councilor Caviello, Councilor Knight, Frederick Lasky, Vice President Long and Kern, Frederick Lasky, Councilor Moxby,

54
00:03:45,062 --> 00:03:48,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Frederick Lasky.

55
00:03:49,306 --> 00:03:59,495
[SPEAKER_02]: On the vote of seven for Frederick Lasky, the vote is unanimous and you are hereby appointed by the Memphis City Council to represent us.

56
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:04,899
[SPEAKER_02]: For a period of three years, the date concluding Council night was 11-9-18, so congratulations.

57
00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:15,975
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to revert back to the regular order of business, Mr. President.

58
00:04:16,276 --> 00:04:19,036
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion to revert back to regular order of business, all those in favor?

59
00:04:19,056 --> 00:04:22,937
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

60
00:04:22,957 --> 00:04:24,278
[SPEAKER_02]: 15-728 offered by Councilor Marks.

61
00:04:24,838 --> 00:04:32,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it resolved that the Metro City Council receive an update on the status of the two proposed raised crosswalks on Central Ave and Harvard Street.

62
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,701
[SPEAKER_02]: This was part of a raised crosswalk pilot program which included three raised crosswalks over

63
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,662
[SPEAKER_02]: which the Winthrop Street raised crosswalk was completed.

64
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:49,608
[SPEAKER_02]: A speed bump was placed on Central Ave several weeks back and area residents would like to know when the raised crosswalk will be installed.

65
00:04:49,968 --> 00:04:50,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks.

66
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:52,990
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

67
00:04:53,330 --> 00:05:01,336
[SPEAKER_12]: And about a year ago at the urging of this council, the mayor implemented a pilot program for raised crosswalks.

68
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:07,820
[SPEAKER_12]: And the first initiative was three raised crosswalks, one located on Central Ave,

69
00:05:08,465 --> 00:05:13,568
[SPEAKER_12]: Harvard Street and also Winthrop Street.

70
00:05:14,168 --> 00:05:19,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, we all know the Winthrop Street Race Crosswalk has been in place for probably over a year now.

71
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:24,354
[SPEAKER_12]: And is it two years?

72
00:05:24,414 --> 00:05:24,854
[SPEAKER_12]: Two years.

73
00:05:25,294 --> 00:05:25,874
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been a while.

74
00:05:27,215 --> 00:05:31,737
[SPEAKER_12]: And we are waiting for the Harvard Street Crosswalk.

75
00:05:31,818 --> 00:05:37,320
[SPEAKER_12]: With all the work that's being done to the bridge, we were told that that would take a little longer.

76
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:46,793
[SPEAKER_12]: sometime back, a speed bump, one of those plastic speed bumps appeared on Central Ave.

77
00:05:47,273 --> 00:05:48,733
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's been there for a number of months.

78
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:54,014
[SPEAKER_12]: I questioned it several months back and have received no response from the administration.

79
00:05:54,894 --> 00:05:59,175
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's my hope that this is not taking the place of a raised crosswalk.

80
00:05:59,575 --> 00:06:03,356
[SPEAKER_12]: We all know the difference between a raised crosswalk and a speed bump.

81
00:06:04,076 --> 00:06:07,897
[SPEAKER_12]: And from the residents that have been calling me up in that neighborhood,

82
00:06:08,628 --> 00:06:16,413
[SPEAKER_12]: They are concerned that that speed bump has been there for many months now, and they want to know when they're going to get their raised crosswalk.

83
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:31,043
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would ask that we receive a response back from the administration regarding what is the detailed plan on when this crosswalk will be initiated and how long it's going to take to implement this, Mr. President.

84
00:06:31,203 --> 00:06:33,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Mox.

85
00:06:33,604 --> 00:06:34,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Lundell-Kern.

86
00:06:34,906 --> 00:06:36,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

87
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:38,990
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to second the resolve.

88
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:45,535
[SPEAKER_01]: We voted, I believe, for the entire project, where the speed bump monies were included.

89
00:06:46,096 --> 00:06:48,258
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was over two years ago.

90
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:57,025
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, too, would like to know what's going on with the residents, especially in the Central Ave area, were on top of this project.

91
00:06:57,045 --> 00:06:58,206
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole park was redone.

92
00:06:58,567 --> 00:06:59,928
[SPEAKER_01]: There were curb cuts put in.

93
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:02,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Handicap accessibility was

94
00:07:03,153 --> 00:07:08,136
[SPEAKER_01]: upgraded in the area, and this raised crosswalk was supposed to be put in place.

95
00:07:08,697 --> 00:07:18,523
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the Winthrop Street raised crosswalk does slow traffic down, so these are very beneficial in our community, especially where we get so many complaints about the speeding.

96
00:07:19,344 --> 00:07:30,171
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, too, would like an answer on, you know, when this is going to be implemented, and really hope that the money we approved to go into these crosswalks hasn't been

97
00:07:31,092 --> 00:07:35,673
[SPEAKER_01]: either used up a different way or diverted in the wrong direction.

98
00:07:35,693 --> 00:07:36,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

99
00:07:41,274 --> 00:07:44,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

100
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:59,718
[SPEAKER_14]: While we're on the topic of Central Avenue, two years ago, some work was done there, replacing them of a water pipe, going into a private store, not done by the city, but done by a private contractor at the expense of the landlord.

101
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:04,216
[SPEAKER_14]: And that trench has now sunk.

102
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:14,362
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know I've made a couple of calls to the city to have the contractor, whoever did that, go back and dig that out and refill it.

103
00:08:14,382 --> 00:08:19,285
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that is now gone, that's a reverse speed bump now for the neighbors in that, over there.

104
00:08:19,885 --> 00:08:22,086
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we could put that in that motion, I'd appreciate it, Mr. President.

105
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:28,732
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a trench on Salem Street, on Central Street.

106
00:08:28,772 --> 00:08:30,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Central and Spring, right in the corner there.

107
00:08:30,272 --> 00:08:31,153
[SPEAKER_02]: In the corner of Spring.

108
00:08:32,654 --> 00:08:33,814
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not done by the city.

109
00:08:34,174 --> 00:08:35,795
[SPEAKER_02]: It was done by a private contractor.

110
00:08:35,855 --> 00:08:39,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Private contractors failed to fulfill their responsibilities on that.

111
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:42,959
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we can send that up to the engineer's office as an amendment.

112
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:46,140
[SPEAKER_02]: And a roll call has been requested on the motion of Councillor Marks.

113
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:50,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll as amended.

114
00:08:57,438 --> 00:08:58,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caviello?

115
00:08:58,358 --> 00:08:58,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

116
00:08:59,159 --> 00:08:59,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight?

117
00:08:59,859 --> 00:09:00,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

118
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:01,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice-President Malauulu-Kern?

119
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:01,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

120
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:02,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks?

121
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:03,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

122
00:09:04,161 --> 00:09:04,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Penta?

123
00:09:04,641 --> 00:09:04,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

124
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:06,402
[SPEAKER_04]: President Del Rosso?

125
00:09:06,822 --> 00:09:07,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

126
00:09:07,142 --> 00:09:13,044
[SPEAKER_02]: With a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes.

127
00:09:13,064 --> 00:09:18,206
[SPEAKER_02]: 15-729, offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the city's new water monitoring program be discussed.

128
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:19,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks?

129
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:27,110
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I'm happy to state that the city is finally rolling out a water monitoring

130
00:09:27,813 --> 00:09:28,353
[SPEAKER_12]: program.

131
00:09:28,373 --> 00:09:38,338
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, this council has been talking about, uh, leak detection, water monitor monitoring, and also I and I inflow and infiltration for many years now.

132
00:09:38,358 --> 00:09:53,565
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, we also, uh, we're, uh, the, uh, body that pushed for the second meter, allowing people to, uh, uh, not be charged for a sewer cost when they're using water outdoors.

133
00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:56,747
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um, this new program, which,

134
00:09:57,926 --> 00:09:59,826
[SPEAKER_12]: is going into effect, I guess, shortly.

135
00:10:01,347 --> 00:10:19,150
[SPEAKER_12]: It will be a way that residents can monitor their water usage and also track and receive alerts from the city and also on their own on any outages or leaks that are showing up on the system itself.

136
00:10:19,991 --> 00:10:27,192
[SPEAKER_12]: And the reason why I brought this up, Mr. President, is that I'm hoping that we can get Ron Baker to come before this podium

137
00:10:27,953 --> 00:10:33,919
[SPEAKER_12]: and give the residents a little tutorial on how this program works.

138
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:44,469
[SPEAKER_12]: It also mentions that residents will be required, in order to participate in this program, to set up an account with this Water Smart program.

139
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:53,437
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm not sure how involved the program is to set up, but I would also ask that Ron

140
00:10:54,485 --> 00:11:06,894
[SPEAKER_12]: who's in our water, Ron Baker, who's in our water department, be able to put together maybe some bullet points on how to walk people through setting up these particular accounts.

141
00:11:08,795 --> 00:11:22,745
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a great program in order to, if you do have an internal leak in your home, and most people think that they're going to see water dripping from a ceiling if they have an internal leak, and that's not always the case.

142
00:11:23,455 --> 00:11:24,955
[SPEAKER_12]: You can have a toilet bowl that's running.

143
00:11:24,995 --> 00:11:28,996
[SPEAKER_12]: You can have a number of issues and not be alerted to them.

144
00:11:29,877 --> 00:11:35,538
[SPEAKER_12]: But this report, this new program, will show you spikes in your water usage.

145
00:11:35,598 --> 00:11:47,381
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll actually show you different periods of time so you can compare summer months to summer months from year to year and be able to really get a handle on your water usage.

146
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,122
[SPEAKER_12]: We, when we went to the new metering program back

147
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:55,574
[SPEAKER_12]: It has to be 10, 12 years ago now, maybe even a little longer.

148
00:11:56,235 --> 00:12:05,683
[SPEAKER_12]: We were sold a bill of goods that the current system had the ability to monitor leaks throughout the community and send out alerts.

149
00:12:06,423 --> 00:12:16,072
[SPEAKER_12]: For whatever reason, we never purchased, according to the Water and Sewer Department, we never purchased the program that made this capable in our community.

150
00:12:16,812 --> 00:12:20,035
[SPEAKER_12]: And after reading an article in the transcript,

151
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:30,506
[SPEAKER_12]: I find it quite amazing that this program through a San Francisco-based company called Water Smart Software, the software itself is $12,628.

152
00:12:31,006 --> 00:12:39,152
[SPEAKER_12]: And this council has probably been talking about this particular program and the need for residents for 10 years now.

153
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:43,134
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, come to find out it's a $12,000 program.

154
00:12:44,235 --> 00:12:46,836
[SPEAKER_12]: It does accompany an additional $1.01 annual fee per account.

155
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:55,722
[SPEAKER_12]: So I assume that's per household that signs up to this, that will be the charge to the city.

156
00:12:56,263 --> 00:13:00,585
[SPEAKER_12]: But the benefits by far outweigh any cost that's associated with this.

157
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:15,874
[SPEAKER_12]: In particular, that water and sewer is fast becoming an issue of concern in this community and at some point may exceed your taxes, your property taxes at the rate we're going.

158
00:13:17,035 --> 00:13:19,536
[SPEAKER_12]: But I support this wholeheartedly.

159
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:37,233
[SPEAKER_12]: I would ask, Mr. President, that we invite him to a regular council meeting, Ron Baker, have him explain the program, let him detail the program, and how we can best send out a message to people in our community on how to sign up for it.

160
00:13:37,973 --> 00:13:41,213
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's not going to be — every resident is not going to just get this program.

161
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:47,655
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to have to sign up and give detailed information on the number of people in your home and rooms

162
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:52,497
[SPEAKER_12]: and so forth, there's a lot involved in, I guess, setting this up.

163
00:13:53,338 --> 00:14:07,223
[SPEAKER_12]: One other interesting fact, Mr. President, and something that I think is going to come up pretty shortly is that there's a deficit right now in the water side of the water and sewer.

164
00:14:07,943 --> 00:14:13,205
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're looking at $1.2 million deficit in the city's water account.

165
00:14:13,823 --> 00:14:27,725
[SPEAKER_12]: And right now, the Water and Sewer Commission, under the tutelage of Dominic Camara, are looking at many different options to try to account for this $1.2 million.

166
00:14:28,485 --> 00:14:43,288
[SPEAKER_12]: And I, as one member of the council, would urge the Water and Sewer Commission to do what's rightfully beneficial to the ratepayers of this community, and that is to take the

167
00:14:43,813 --> 00:14:49,354
[SPEAKER_12]: surplus money in the water and sewer enterprise account and offset this particular deficit.

168
00:14:50,075 --> 00:14:56,876
[SPEAKER_12]: That money can only be spent for infrastructure projects by state statute and also offsetting rates.

169
00:14:57,756 --> 00:15:12,560
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think this is an appropriate time to take the six-plus million dollars that's in that account, combined accounts, and offset the rate so the $1.2 million won't be borne by the water and sewer ratepayers, Mr. President.

170
00:15:13,694 --> 00:15:14,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

171
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,995
[SPEAKER_02]: The chair recognizes Vice President Longo-Kern.

172
00:15:17,315 --> 00:15:18,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

173
00:15:18,816 --> 00:15:22,737
[SPEAKER_01]: I too think it would be beneficial to get Ron Baker to come down.

174
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:36,221
[SPEAKER_01]: I also, with regards to the number of things that he's going to report to us with regard to this particular system, I'm also curious to find out what it entails for the city to man the system and monitor the system.

175
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:39,562
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we could just add that to have him

176
00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:43,226
[SPEAKER_01]: come speak to us about, I would be interested in that.

177
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:54,491
[SPEAKER_01]: The 12,000 is something that, I had brought this up on the council floor a couple months ago, and at that time, I estimated about 20,000 for the Aqua Hawk system, so 12,000's an even better figure.

178
00:15:55,231 --> 00:15:59,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wanted to ask, you know, how will we monitor this?

179
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Will we need another position in the water and sewer department?

180
00:16:01,954 --> 00:16:07,197
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how is that done, and how can we, I don't wanna just buy this system and it just be out there.

181
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,658
[SPEAKER_01]: We need somebody to monitor it and be able to call residents

182
00:16:10,451 --> 00:16:23,857
[SPEAKER_01]: may have leaks and do something positive with it so that our residents don't get stuck with astronomical bills due to leaks that they didn't know about, whether they were on vacation or, you know, just could not hear the toilet running.

183
00:16:24,197 --> 00:16:32,301
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to be able to use this to benefit our residents and not hear the awful stories that we hear with regards to $1,000 bills because of an unknown leak.

184
00:16:33,141 --> 00:16:33,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

185
00:16:33,842 --> 00:16:36,963
[SPEAKER_02]: So as amended by Vice President Lugo-Kern, Councillor Knight,

186
00:16:37,485 --> 00:16:39,867
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and thank you, Counselor Marks.

187
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:59,920
[SPEAKER_15]: We share some of the same concerns relative to the deficit in the water side, and I'd like to amend the paper a little bit further to ask the Water and Sewer Commission to report back on the actual financial picture relative to the water and sewer revenue forecasts, as well as whether or not we've met conservation goals established through the tiered rating system, Mr. President.

188
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:05,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a conversation with the commissioner of the, if I can just share,

189
00:17:06,927 --> 00:17:16,795
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I think they're waiting on a report or, uh, looking at some figures and it won't be long before they come and sit with us to report back on what's going on with that.

190
00:17:17,196 --> 00:17:17,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

191
00:17:17,516 --> 00:17:17,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

192
00:17:18,617 --> 00:17:21,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, chair recognizes counselor Penta this past March.

193
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:29,346
[SPEAKER_07]: I attended the, uh, water and soil commission when they first introduced this idea of having a monitoring system take place here within our community.

194
00:17:29,926 --> 00:17:32,168
[SPEAKER_07]: And inclusive of that, there was a company, um,

195
00:17:32,747 --> 00:17:38,328
[SPEAKER_07]: that was coming forward and made a presentation as it relates to addressing any and all leaks throughout the city.

196
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,869
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not being a voluntary participant.

197
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:45,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so the difference between that one and this one, um, is, is a little bit different.

198
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:48,730
[SPEAKER_07]: And as council max is alluded to, I think it would be great to have them come forward.

199
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:53,531
[SPEAKER_07]: So all the taxpayers and the rate payers would have a better understanding as to what's going on.

200
00:17:54,311 --> 00:17:58,712
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as having the program, that's going to have the capacity and the ability to, to detect leaks.

201
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:09,225
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things that was paramount in this whole program was that spike periods of time, either during the day or during the night, would be recorded here at City Hall.

202
00:18:09,345 --> 00:18:24,539
[SPEAKER_07]: And as a result of that, whoever would be monitoring or whatever office would be handling this, they would be able to get a printout, they would be able to identify the time, and that would in turn be able to notify the ratepayer homeowner who would be having this particular problem.

203
00:18:25,325 --> 00:18:28,586
[SPEAKER_07]: As Councilor Marks alluded to, there are astronomical bills that have been going out there.

204
00:18:28,606 --> 00:18:33,387
[SPEAKER_07]: I've sat there where people have had $1,000, $2,000 bills because of a little bit of a leak.

205
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:41,370
[SPEAKER_07]: We were told, I believe, when we bought the system at that point in time that the software to be included was about approximately $100,000.

206
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,071
[SPEAKER_07]: That was inclusive of having a person in the system.

207
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:49,912
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know how much that broke itself down to the employee and to the software, but if we had that,

208
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:55,274
[SPEAKER_07]: we probably wouldn't be in the position now of talking about people who have these outrageous bills.

209
00:18:55,354 --> 00:19:00,617
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't think it's just a $12,000 system, since it's going to be voluntary.

210
00:19:00,657 --> 00:19:05,740
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know how that's going to represent every single house in the community to ask people to be a participant.

211
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:15,886
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think what would be beneficial is to have them come down here, because they're going to tell you that the tier system that they're working off of right now hasn't worked apparently the way they thought it would work.

212
00:19:16,226 --> 00:19:18,868
[SPEAKER_07]: First, it was the first 800 would get a certain rate.

213
00:19:19,195 --> 00:19:20,836
[SPEAKER_07]: and then up to 1,200, then up to 1,200.

214
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:25,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's the first thousand, and then after the first thousand cubic feet, and it goes on and on.

215
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:32,905
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think what the council and the rate payers really need to understand is looking at the volume of how much water is used by those people.

216
00:19:33,445 --> 00:19:44,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Now when we talk about the conservation part of the program, you're also talking about what the EPA, through the federal government, is mandating as for the amount of per gallons per day, per individual, I think it's like 65.

217
00:19:45,714 --> 00:19:47,716
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we look at that and multiply that,

218
00:19:48,418 --> 00:19:54,499
[SPEAKER_07]: in each individual household, you'll have an idea of how much water should be used or is going to be used.

219
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,880
[SPEAKER_07]: That, in and of itself, will send out a tier amount.

220
00:19:59,300 --> 00:19:59,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, it's 800.

221
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,601
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what it's going to go to once the water commissioners sit down and talk about this.

222
00:20:06,102 --> 00:20:09,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, to a lot of people, this might sound like, wow, this is way over their head.

223
00:20:09,602 --> 00:20:12,963
[SPEAKER_07]: And it probably is, because if you think about it, when you're talking about cubic feet,

224
00:20:13,347 --> 00:20:16,249
[SPEAKER_07]: and the cost per cubic feet, it is a lot to think about.

225
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:24,533
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we're talking about almost $7 million, if not more, that we have in the water and sewer enterprise surplus account, that money definitely should be used.

226
00:20:24,553 --> 00:20:27,995
[SPEAKER_07]: There is nothing on the books that's demanding the exact use of that money.

227
00:20:28,055 --> 00:20:40,942
[SPEAKER_07]: And more importantly, if, in fact, that money has to be taken out to offset whatever the increased cost is this year until they can figure out what the exact cost is going to be on the cubic feet, whatever the dollar amount might be, is it 800, 900, 1,000 cubic feet?

228
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:43,410
[SPEAKER_07]: then so be it.

229
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:48,353
[SPEAKER_07]: The ratepayers need to have this understood, but they need to come up and speak up about it.

230
00:20:49,493 --> 00:20:54,275
[SPEAKER_07]: They should not have to pay one red cent in any increase in water and sewer bill, not one red cent.

231
00:20:54,755 --> 00:21:00,078
[SPEAKER_07]: This city is sitting on their money, approximately $7.5 million.

232
00:21:00,318 --> 00:21:01,298
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an awful lot of money.

233
00:21:01,819 --> 00:21:03,920
[SPEAKER_07]: They haven't spent that money in a long period of time.

234
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:08,802
[SPEAKER_07]: So don't let anybody confuse you or fool you or make you think that you have to pay for it.

235
00:21:09,822 --> 00:21:10,703
[SPEAKER_07]: City has that money.

236
00:21:10,743 --> 00:21:11,243
[SPEAKER_07]: It's your money.

237
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:19,063
[SPEAKER_07]: let them pay for it out of the water and sewer account, let them figure out what the money, what the cubic feet cost needs to be, and you move on from that period.

238
00:21:19,303 --> 00:21:21,024
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I thank you, Councilor Mox, for bringing that forward.

239
00:21:22,845 --> 00:21:23,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Pinto.

240
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:28,529
[SPEAKER_02]: So, on the motion of Councilor Mox, as amended by Councilor Long and Kern, all those in favor?

241
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:29,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

242
00:21:29,509 --> 00:21:30,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

243
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:34,953
[SPEAKER_02]: You wish to speak on this matter, please state your name and address for the record.

244
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:35,433
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome.

245
00:21:36,394 --> 00:21:37,935
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

246
00:21:38,075 --> 00:21:40,457
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Robert Cappucci, 71 Evans Street.

247
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:55,587
[SPEAKER_00]: On the matter of this monitoring system, I would hope that would also include all of the public buildings in this city because the rate payers are responsible for taking on that cost.

248
00:21:56,548 --> 00:22:04,054
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of what Councillor Penta just brought up, this body passed an amendment to a budget

249
00:22:04,488 --> 00:22:05,989
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep the water rates the same.

250
00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:25,559
[SPEAKER_00]: It was something to the tune of $618,000 that then got vetoed by Mayor McGlynn, but then the budget was still signed and that money still had to be accounted for, but then that all just disappeared when we went to this tiered system.

251
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,621
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would hope that this monitoring system

252
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:35,308
[SPEAKER_00]: is utilized by this building, high school, library, Chevalier.

253
00:22:35,828 --> 00:22:55,532
[SPEAKER_00]: What we need to know, we need transparency, because if there's a water leak at the Chevalier and the ratepayers are having to incur this cost with, you know, other costs that are going to be going up in the next few years with the passing of the Community Preservation Act, you're putting a lot on the taxpayers of this city.

254
00:22:55,752 --> 00:22:56,893
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

255
00:22:57,273 --> 00:22:58,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Capucci.

256
00:22:58,685 --> 00:23:02,348
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the motion of Councillor Marks, yes.

257
00:23:03,388 --> 00:23:07,951
[SPEAKER_12]: Just if I could, Mr. Capucci brings up a great point.

258
00:23:08,652 --> 00:23:18,579
[SPEAKER_12]: And the fact that there are many city buildings now that don't have meters, and we can't tell you what the water consumption is because it's not being measured.

259
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:24,383
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, we're asking residents to measure their water consumption, but the city's not doing it.

260
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:35,759
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's only appropriate that we ask these questions of Ron Baker and the administration why certain buildings in the city, certain own municipal buildings aren't needed.

261
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:44,023
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's only appropriate that we get these answers and, you know, with the cost of water and sewer in this community, you're right.

262
00:23:44,324 --> 00:23:53,148
[SPEAKER_12]: The fact that we all pay under our bill for the municipal buildings, I as one resident would like to know that

263
00:23:53,481 --> 00:23:59,027
[SPEAKER_12]: The city's also conserving on their side, and the city's also monitoring their usage.

264
00:23:59,487 --> 00:24:03,471
[SPEAKER_12]: And that goes with every park in the community that has water.

265
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:05,253
[SPEAKER_12]: That goes with the guiding clubs.

266
00:24:05,954 --> 00:24:13,682
[SPEAKER_12]: We just created a new ordinance with the guiding clubs, and the water they're using right now is not needed.

267
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:15,975
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's something that needs to be looked at.

268
00:24:16,475 --> 00:24:26,083
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have to have a precise accounting, whether it's the school buildings or any of the municipal buildings, on what we're using in this community in regards to water and sewer.

269
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:30,107
[SPEAKER_12]: We can no longer go by and say, well, you know, every rate payer is paying for it.

270
00:24:30,447 --> 00:24:30,987
[SPEAKER_12]: Who cares?

271
00:24:32,168 --> 00:24:37,133
[SPEAKER_12]: That can't be the mentality any longer as it existed for many years in this community, Mr. President.

272
00:24:37,153 --> 00:24:39,435
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's a great point that Mr. Capucci brings up.

273
00:24:40,415 --> 00:24:41,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor.

274
00:24:41,076 --> 00:24:42,217
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the motion of Councilor Martz,

275
00:24:42,664 --> 00:24:45,125
[SPEAKER_02]: As amended by vice-president London Kern, all those in favor?

276
00:24:45,145 --> 00:24:46,366
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

277
00:24:47,366 --> 00:24:47,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Carries.

278
00:24:48,527 --> 00:24:51,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso for suspension of the rules.

279
00:24:52,268 --> 00:24:53,029
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

280
00:24:54,329 --> 00:24:55,910
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

281
00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:00,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Camuso asked for suspension of the rules to take communications from the mayor out of order.

282
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:08,576
[SPEAKER_02]: 15-734, to the president and members of the Memphis City Council, from Michael J. McGlynn, mayor, re-loan order.

283
00:25:08,996 --> 00:25:11,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Additional DPW facility project funds

00:25:12,085 --> 00:25:19,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following loan order.

285
00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:38,519
[SPEAKER_02]: City of Medford, Massachusetts loan order, additional DPW facility projects funds be it ordered that the city appropriates $300,000 to pay additional costs of the DPW facility project, which project was previously approved by this council on October 9th, 2013.

00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:59,704
[SPEAKER_02]: And that to meet this appreciate appropriation, the city treasurer with the approval of the mayor is authorized to borrow a set amount under and pursuant to chapter 44, section seven, three and seven, three a of the general laws of or pursuant to any other enabling authority and to issue bonds.

287
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:26,420
[SPEAKER_02]: or notes of the city, therefore, and further ordered that the city treasurer is authorized to file an application with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Municipal Finance Oversight Board to qualify under chapters 44A of the general laws, any and all bonds or notes of the city authorized by this vote or pursuant to any prior vote of the city and in connection therewith to provide such information and execute such documents as municipal finance oversight

288
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:38,473
[SPEAKER_02]: oversight board of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts may require very sincerely yours, Michael J. McGlynn, mayor and representing the office of the mayor on this matter is Anne Baker.

289
00:26:39,253 --> 00:26:47,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the Anne Baker's position is the auditor of the city of Medford.

290
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:48,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

291
00:26:48,095 --> 00:26:49,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that reminder.

292
00:26:50,136 --> 00:26:55,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, counselor, do we want to allow Anne to speak for a moment to explain?

293
00:26:55,777 --> 00:26:56,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to speak.

294
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:57,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Pinto?

295
00:26:58,203 --> 00:27:01,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, this is the very first time that we've been getting this.

296
00:27:01,365 --> 00:27:03,386
[SPEAKER_07]: We got nothing in our packet of explanation.

297
00:27:04,126 --> 00:27:17,494
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to utilize a rule 20 of our council rules, which basically says that any financial paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when one such action is requested by any one councilor.

298
00:27:18,155 --> 00:27:22,277
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to move to the paper lay on the table and we have some explanation between now and next week.

299
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,319
[SPEAKER_07]: So on motion of the table by councilor.

300
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:25,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

301
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,210
[SPEAKER_07]: It's automatic.

302
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is undebatable.

303
00:27:29,171 --> 00:27:30,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, all those in favor.

304
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:32,052
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's automatic.

305
00:27:32,272 --> 00:27:33,292
[SPEAKER_07]: The rule says it's automatic.

306
00:27:33,412 --> 00:27:33,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone counts.

307
00:27:34,032 --> 00:27:36,053
[SPEAKER_07]: It's totally on the table.

308
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:36,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

309
00:27:41,555 --> 00:27:42,875
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's on the one item.

310
00:27:43,415 --> 00:27:43,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

311
00:27:43,915 --> 00:27:45,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, through the chair, just in case, um,

312
00:27:53,804 --> 00:28:02,068
[SPEAKER_01]: We utilize that rule for all—I know we have four of these papers on for us before all four are possibly tabled.

313
00:28:02,428 --> 00:28:05,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we get a detailed—because I have the same issue.

314
00:28:05,829 --> 00:28:11,992
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we really aren't given any information of where this $300,000 is going to.

315
00:28:12,032 --> 00:28:18,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have one for $200,000, we have one for $350,000, and we—I think that might be it, but— There's only three.

316
00:28:18,975 --> 00:28:19,635
[SPEAKER_13]: One was withdrawn.

317
00:28:19,796 --> 00:28:20,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Three, okay.

318
00:28:21,108 --> 00:28:24,350
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the three, and there's really no explanation for any of them.

319
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:29,992
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you could give us a detailed report on all three.

320
00:28:30,373 --> 00:28:39,097
[SPEAKER_02]: May I suggest that since Rule 20 has been invoked on the first motion that we not discuss that,

321
00:28:43,698 --> 00:28:45,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, because it's, uh, the rule has been evoked.

322
00:28:45,939 --> 00:28:57,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore we may not discuss it, but if you would on the matter of the carriage house and also on the, uh, just give us a brief synopsis before we introduce them for discussion.

323
00:28:57,604 --> 00:29:00,025
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I'm going to say the same thing for 15 seven 36 as it relates to rule, um, 20.

324
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:09,652
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the first time that this is... We haven't introduced that for discussion.

325
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:10,953
[SPEAKER_07]: You just mentioned the carriage house.

326
00:29:11,274 --> 00:29:12,214
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the next one in line.

327
00:29:12,815 --> 00:29:13,335
[SPEAKER_07]: She just said it.

328
00:29:16,318 --> 00:29:20,081
[SPEAKER_07]: You just got through talking about the first one, which is the city ads.

329
00:29:20,121 --> 00:29:21,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're talking about the carriage house.

330
00:29:21,923 --> 00:29:23,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you not mention the carriage house?

331
00:29:23,885 --> 00:29:24,786
[SPEAKER_13]: I said carriage house.

332
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:25,626
[SPEAKER_13]: You said discuss them.

333
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:26,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

334
00:29:28,389 --> 00:29:29,189
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam Vice President.

335
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,732
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just like to know more about the projects.

336
00:29:31,752 --> 00:29:32,733
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to know where this...

337
00:29:33,988 --> 00:29:38,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Three quarters of a million dollars is going to, there's no detailed explanation.

338
00:29:38,269 --> 00:29:46,572
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just asking that it be put in writing to us so that we can make an educated decision.

339
00:29:50,193 --> 00:29:50,874
[SPEAKER_07]: So 15, 735.

340
00:29:53,655 --> 00:30:01,017
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, through you, maybe you could communicate with the administration that anytime a loan audit comes before the council,

341
00:30:01,782 --> 00:30:09,284
[SPEAKER_12]: We should be apprised of what they're actually going to spend the money on ahead of time, rather than hearing it the night of.

342
00:30:10,265 --> 00:30:11,845
[SPEAKER_12]: It just doesn't make any sense at all.

343
00:30:14,306 --> 00:30:25,289
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the record, 17-735 to the members of the Medford City Council for a Michael J. McGlynn loan order, Carriage House, Brooks Estate Remodeling.

344
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear Mr. President.

345
00:30:28,862 --> 00:30:39,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I will move at this point in time that rule 20 section four be invoked since it's appearing on the council for the first time and it takes one council to automatically lay it on the table.

346
00:30:40,513 --> 00:30:42,215
[SPEAKER_02]: That motion is undebatable.

347
00:30:42,235 --> 00:30:43,536
[SPEAKER_02]: 715-735 is on the table.

348
00:30:43,556 --> 00:30:43,576
[SPEAKER_02]: 15-736.

349
00:30:48,787 --> 00:30:56,333
[SPEAKER_02]: To the President and members of the Medford City Council, from Michael J. McGlynn, Mayor, read loan order Winthrop Street- Mr. President.

350
00:30:56,734 --> 00:30:57,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Penta.

351
00:30:57,534 --> 00:31:03,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Likewise, taking rule order number 20, section 4, preparing for the first time this particular amount, this particular paper.

352
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,601
[SPEAKER_07]: I move that the paper lay on the table.

353
00:31:06,001 --> 00:31:08,403
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Penta, undebatable.

354
00:31:09,064 --> 00:31:09,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Ms.

355
00:31:09,584 --> 00:31:09,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Baker.

356
00:31:15,078 --> 00:31:18,800
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of a counselor night to refer it back to the regular order of business.

357
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:25,323
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor, all those opposed 15 to seven 30 offered by counselor night, be it resolved.

358
00:31:25,363 --> 00:31:33,488
[SPEAKER_02]: The superintendent of schools and budget director provide the council with the cost estimate relative to the hiring of security guards in our public schools.

359
00:31:33,988 --> 00:31:43,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it further resolved that the school department secure policies and protocols, uh, security policies and protocols be forwarded to the council counselor night.

360
00:31:43,923 --> 00:31:45,224
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

361
00:31:45,744 --> 00:31:57,429
[SPEAKER_15]: As a student in the Medford Public Schools, I was always very familiar with the security officers that we had at the high school, the security officers, the community resource officers that we had in our elementary and middle schools at the time, junior high schools.

362
00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:10,454
[SPEAKER_15]: To date myself, Mr. President, everybody is aware of the incident where someone breached security protocols at one of our local schools and was able to steal $800 or so from some teachers Friday before the election.

363
00:32:11,177 --> 00:32:18,862
[SPEAKER_15]: And with that being said, Mr. President, I think it's time that we take a long, hard look at restoring the actual school security guards to our public school buildings.

364
00:32:19,742 --> 00:32:22,884
[SPEAKER_15]: Technology is great, and I certainly embrace technology, Mr. President.

365
00:32:22,924 --> 00:32:26,266
[SPEAKER_15]: I certainly feel as though cameras are very important tools.

366
00:32:26,386 --> 00:32:33,290
[SPEAKER_15]: However, they don't replace the good, old-fashioned work of a police presence or a security presence in our public schools, Mr. President.

367
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:36,572
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd ask that my fellow colleagues on the Council support this resolution.

368
00:32:37,365 --> 00:32:45,050
[SPEAKER_15]: getting a cost estimate from the superintendent of schools, as well as our budget director, and also having a copy of the security protocols forwarded to our attention for review.

369
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:49,752
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, I feel as though, uh, as we prepare for the budget, this would be an important item for us to take a look at.

370
00:32:49,772 --> 00:32:53,034
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion for pulled by council night council care of yellow.

371
00:32:53,174 --> 00:32:53,895
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

372
00:32:54,535 --> 00:32:56,496
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, I thank council for bringing this forward.

373
00:32:57,037 --> 00:33:05,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, last week I probably got a dozen phone calls myself from different parents, uh, along with, uh, my own family was concerned about, uh, what happened.

374
00:33:06,002 --> 00:33:06,122
[SPEAKER_14]: Um,

375
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:13,884
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the things that the parents were mostly concerned about was the lack of a response from the school departments.

376
00:33:14,524 --> 00:33:20,187
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think they need to come up with some kind of statement over what's going on there over the last week or so.

377
00:33:20,527 --> 00:33:24,629
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'd also like to have a report on the cameras.

378
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,731
[SPEAKER_14]: In all the buildings, do we have cameras in every building?

379
00:33:28,751 --> 00:33:29,331
[SPEAKER_14]: Are they working?

380
00:33:30,852 --> 00:33:33,954
[SPEAKER_14]: I know we did appropriate some money for some cameras some time back.

381
00:33:34,594 --> 00:33:35,394
[SPEAKER_14]: Have they been installed?

382
00:33:35,434 --> 00:33:36,295
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the status of them?

383
00:33:38,014 --> 00:33:38,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.

384
00:33:38,374 --> 00:33:47,478
[SPEAKER_02]: So as amended by Councilor Caviello, that the school department further report back as to the status implementation and distribution of security cameras.

385
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:53,561
[SPEAKER_14]: And some type of a official statement over what happened other than what we heard on the news.

386
00:33:54,161 --> 00:33:56,462
[SPEAKER_14]: And an official statement from the superintendent's office.

387
00:33:57,203 --> 00:33:58,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor.

388
00:33:59,144 --> 00:33:59,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Pinto.

389
00:34:00,324 --> 00:34:04,626
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things that's very disturbing is the fact that somebody actually got into that building.

390
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:06,447
[SPEAKER_07]: How and why they got through locked doors, I don't know.

391
00:34:07,036 --> 00:34:07,636
[SPEAKER_07]: That's number one.

392
00:34:07,676 --> 00:34:16,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Number two, the six teachers that were involved that had their pocketbooks rifled during the course of the school day, you know, presents a very unsettling and uncomfortable situation.

393
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,462
[SPEAKER_07]: The unfortunate part about it, no police presence, no police were called.

394
00:34:21,922 --> 00:34:27,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Superintendent's office, again, speaking of — let's just put it this way.

395
00:34:28,604 --> 00:34:30,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Superintendent's office did not come forward.

396
00:34:31,545 --> 00:34:33,726
[SPEAKER_07]: The argument was it was just before an election.

397
00:34:33,766 --> 00:34:35,667
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't want people to think that their schools weren't safe.

398
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,981
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's a scary situation.

399
00:34:38,001 --> 00:34:39,222
[SPEAKER_07]: The incident actually took place.

400
00:34:39,522 --> 00:34:40,262
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't deny it.

401
00:34:40,342 --> 00:34:41,583
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't hide from it.

402
00:34:42,023 --> 00:34:49,848
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there was one candidate running for school committee, Chris Murphy, and that was one of the things he was pounding upon, the lack of school security and the need for school security.

403
00:34:49,948 --> 00:34:51,589
[SPEAKER_07]: And you couldn't have it more prevalent now.

404
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:57,693
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's unfortunate that it was covered up before the election, when, in fact, it took place the week prior to the election.

405
00:34:58,053 --> 00:35:02,436
[SPEAKER_07]: So, with that being said, it's an absolute concern not only for the teachers, but for the students, too.

406
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:10,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Could have been some nutcake could have gone into that building and done anything that they wanted to that could have harmed the teachers, the students, and the building in and of itself.

407
00:35:11,451 --> 00:35:12,252
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's wrong.

408
00:35:12,632 --> 00:35:20,897
[SPEAKER_07]: You just spent over $500,000 to hire five new administrators up at that school at $94,000 each this past year.

409
00:35:20,937 --> 00:35:21,757
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what they're doing.

410
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:26,320
[SPEAKER_07]: But it certainly isn't doing to protect the school kids' safety.

411
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:31,482
[SPEAKER_07]: It has nothing to do with hiring new school teachers or buying supplies or looking even into a security system.

412
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:32,563
[SPEAKER_07]: It's wrong.

413
00:35:33,868 --> 00:35:36,589
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, this school administration really needs to be looked at.

414
00:35:36,649 --> 00:35:42,512
[SPEAKER_07]: And the new school committee coming in, I hope they do a good hard look at how these schools and how their budget is being processed.

415
00:35:42,552 --> 00:35:47,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, you can't keep going on with this and hiding and covering up everything that's going on.

416
00:35:49,334 --> 00:35:50,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Patu.

417
00:35:50,795 --> 00:35:51,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Longo-Kern.

418
00:35:52,456 --> 00:35:54,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

419
00:35:54,516 --> 00:35:58,578
[SPEAKER_01]: I, too, got the phone calls and a few emails from parents, and I think they were

420
00:35:59,262 --> 00:36:03,503
[SPEAKER_01]: more concerned that they weren't notified about what went on than the actual incident.

421
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:11,124
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did speak to Diane Guarino, the principal at the school, and I communicated with Superintendent Belson afterwards.

422
00:36:11,784 --> 00:36:22,587
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the things, some of the changes they made are positive changes within the school, but it also raises concern, you know, with regards to being reactive rather than proactive.

423
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:23,727
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of my big

424
00:36:26,146 --> 00:36:44,540
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad Council and I put this on the agenda because a resolve that I was going to do next week, I'll just bring it up now, is to make sure that the changes they made at the McGlynn School after this incident took place, that those changes are implemented at every single one of our elementary and middle schools and high school.

425
00:36:45,181 --> 00:36:49,164
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't just make changes in the McGlynn School because it happened at the McGlynn.

426
00:36:49,184 --> 00:36:51,025
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to make sure we make these changes.

427
00:36:51,386 --> 00:36:54,328
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would request that the school committee look into

428
00:36:55,396 --> 00:37:02,279
[SPEAKER_01]: And that all principals look into these changes made by the McGlynn Middle School and implement them throughout the system.

429
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:08,582
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to make sure every child, every teacher, every staff member is safe within every single school, not just, you know, the McGlynn.

430
00:37:09,262 --> 00:37:16,225
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some of the changes, which I have an email where now all staff, subs, visitors must wear badges every day.

431
00:37:16,245 --> 00:37:19,567
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just make sure that is consistent throughout Medford.

432
00:37:20,787 --> 00:37:22,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Kindergarten doors will be locked all day.

433
00:37:22,828 --> 00:37:25,770
[SPEAKER_01]: K will return from recess through the main back door.

434
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:28,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Each teacher now has a key.

435
00:37:29,332 --> 00:37:33,654
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, the lunch monitors will be present at the entrance of the back door.

436
00:37:34,234 --> 00:37:39,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Security guards will unlock the door for the visitors if the security guard is on break or away from the desk.

437
00:37:39,517 --> 00:37:43,939
[SPEAKER_01]: The secretaries will buzz in visitors and they will sign in at the main office and be given a badge.

438
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:52,067
[SPEAKER_01]: And if a visitor enters the building and refuses to comply with the visitor protocol, an administrator will be called to assist.

439
00:37:52,627 --> 00:38:10,052
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just really ask that the school committee look at these changes they're making, make sure they're made throughout the system, and really see if additional changes need to be made, whether that's security guards at every school or further changes need to be made beyond these five steps.

440
00:38:10,392 --> 00:38:11,852
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to keep our children safe.

441
00:38:11,892 --> 00:38:13,653
[SPEAKER_01]: And if a woman can get through the back door,

442
00:38:14,227 --> 00:38:18,448
[SPEAKER_01]: through the lunch line, we have a problem that we need to make sure.

443
00:38:19,328 --> 00:38:19,928
[SPEAKER_01]: We're lucky.

444
00:38:20,028 --> 00:38:23,989
[SPEAKER_01]: It was unfortunate that money was stolen, but a child could be hurt.

445
00:38:24,149 --> 00:38:25,969
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to make sure that that doesn't happen.

446
00:38:27,969 --> 00:38:29,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

447
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,450
[SPEAKER_02]: So is that amendment?

448
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:38,811
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an amendment that the school committee look into making these changes throughout our entire school system.

449
00:38:39,831 --> 00:38:41,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.

450
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:42,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.

451
00:38:43,418 --> 00:38:44,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

452
00:38:44,478 --> 00:38:48,100
[SPEAKER_08]: And I certainly agree with all the sentiments of all of my colleagues this evening.

453
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,681
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, this is very disturbing.

454
00:38:51,622 --> 00:39:02,687
[SPEAKER_08]: As it was alluded to in prior comments, we're lucky that the only thing that happened was lassity of people's personal property and nothing more egregious.

455
00:39:03,287 --> 00:39:07,048
[SPEAKER_08]: And just, it's very disturbing.

456
00:39:07,689 --> 00:39:11,711
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the parents are very concerned about this, and they very well should be.

457
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:15,591
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that they have to have some sort of round table.

458
00:39:15,971 --> 00:39:21,372
[SPEAKER_08]: I know the chief of police and the police department is active in the schools, but you know what?

459
00:39:21,972 --> 00:39:25,333
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually, several years ago, there was the STARS program.

460
00:39:25,773 --> 00:39:27,353
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not so sure if it's still out there.

461
00:39:27,413 --> 00:39:35,475
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the school threat assessment response team, and it's made up of all the area police departments and NMLAC and some of the other SWAT teams in the area.

462
00:39:36,036 --> 00:39:39,536
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we could just get an update too.

463
00:39:39,616 --> 00:39:41,717
[SPEAKER_08]: It's unfortunate, but it's things,

464
00:39:42,925 --> 00:39:49,550
[SPEAKER_08]: of this magnitude, when it happens, you sort of start thinking about other things that could possibly happen.

465
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:57,635
[SPEAKER_08]: The people that lived in the Watertown-Cambridge line never thought that there'd be a car chase in their neighborhood.

466
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,421
[SPEAKER_08]: involving homemade grenades and bombs.

467
00:40:03,261 --> 00:40:09,383
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and we just have to make sure that every precaution is taken when it comes to the safety of our students.

468
00:40:09,923 --> 00:40:12,284
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to go on record in support of this.

469
00:40:12,804 --> 00:40:18,846
[SPEAKER_08]: And this isn't something that should wait the 10 days for the mayor to get and then send off to the superintendent of schools.

470
00:40:18,886 --> 00:40:21,287
[SPEAKER_08]: This is something that we should get right away.

471
00:40:21,747 --> 00:40:26,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, if we could ask the chief of police for an update, because the surveillance video

472
00:40:27,365 --> 00:40:32,168
[SPEAKER_08]: that they do have of the individual perpetrator, look like a pretty clear picture.

473
00:40:32,728 --> 00:40:43,695
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully, with the public's help, if it hasn't been already, but with the public's help, they can identify and hold this person responsible, or persons responsible for this egregious behavior.

474
00:40:44,355 --> 00:40:44,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.

475
00:40:44,895 --> 00:40:52,760
[SPEAKER_02]: So on that motion, as amended by main motion of Council Knight, as amended by Councilors Caviello, Longo, Kern, and Camuso,

476
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Pinto.

477
00:40:54,501 --> 00:40:55,081
[SPEAKER_07]: One quick thought.

478
00:40:55,281 --> 00:40:58,663
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if there's ever a time to bring both bodies together, this would be it.

479
00:40:58,943 --> 00:41:04,606
[SPEAKER_07]: I would suggest a joint meeting between the school committee and the city council take place just because it took place at a school.

480
00:41:04,666 --> 00:41:09,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's to say it can't take place in this building right here or any public works building anything.

481
00:41:10,248 --> 00:41:11,869
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a huge wake up call.

482
00:41:12,449 --> 00:41:14,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you realize the kid could have been kidnapped?

483
00:41:14,811 --> 00:41:15,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Could have been hurt.

484
00:41:16,972 --> 00:41:19,733
[SPEAKER_07]: We have no idea what the potential is, but it's obvious.

485
00:41:20,783 --> 00:41:23,425
[SPEAKER_07]: It's unfortunate in this day and age we have to act like this.

486
00:41:23,465 --> 00:41:31,169
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we have to act like this to protect what we have, and that's the kids and the teachers and the people who work around here, then we have a responsibility.

487
00:41:31,209 --> 00:41:34,871
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what they're paying taxes for, believing and hoping that their children are being safe.

488
00:41:35,992 --> 00:41:43,336
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to move, Mr. President, that a joint meeting take place between the school committee and the council as it relates to security in the school system.

489
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:46,258
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe we can address our own public buildings at the same time.

490
00:41:46,918 --> 00:41:48,419
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not going to go away.

491
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:57,027
[SPEAKER_02]: And as amended by Councilor Penta, for the joint meeting of Medford City Council and School Committee.

492
00:41:57,688 --> 00:41:58,308
[SPEAKER_02]: On this matter?

493
00:41:58,528 --> 00:41:59,088
[SPEAKER_02]: On this matter.

494
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:02,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

495
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:04,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Please state your name and address for the record.

496
00:42:04,952 --> 00:42:05,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, Council President.

497
00:42:06,012 --> 00:42:08,494
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave.

498
00:42:09,494 --> 00:42:19,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't it a few weeks ago that a maintenance man who had left a school down in the Plymouth area started going in and doing this exact same thing, going through teachers' pocketbooks?

499
00:42:20,834 --> 00:42:22,735
[SPEAKER_09]: so that it happened a few weeks ago.

500
00:42:22,935 --> 00:42:31,580
[SPEAKER_09]: What I find very disturbing is that all the schools, not just Medford, all the schools out on high alert that like, wow, this is a maintenance man that had access to the place.

501
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,362
[SPEAKER_09]: So that kind of person can kind of slip in, go under the radar.

502
00:42:35,943 --> 00:42:37,924
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see the school making an error there.

503
00:42:38,424 --> 00:42:47,349
[SPEAKER_09]: This is far more egregious, as Paul Camuso said, egregious, because now you have just a person that wasn't a maintenance person coming in there.

504
00:42:47,389 --> 00:42:48,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, my concern, obviously,

505
00:42:49,307 --> 00:42:51,248
[SPEAKER_09]: The mayor wants the public access station there.

506
00:42:51,668 --> 00:42:52,888
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to do public access.

507
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:57,210
[SPEAKER_09]: I bring in a bestselling author, Jennifer Weiner, bestselling author, Brad Meltzer.

508
00:42:58,371 --> 00:43:01,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they gonna wanna go there when I do my show typically in the evening?

509
00:43:03,173 --> 00:43:14,597
[SPEAKER_09]: It is, you know, schools now, it's like, we do need some kind of security measures in place for the public access station if it will be there at the high school.

510
00:43:14,617 --> 00:43:16,458
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would like that added somehow

511
00:43:17,471 --> 00:43:22,174
[SPEAKER_09]: because there are going to be people from the outside coming in, and we don't even know if they're members of the access station.

512
00:43:22,194 --> 00:43:28,438
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be anyone from anywhere saying, well, I'll just act like I'm a member of the access station, and waltz in and do something damaging.

513
00:43:28,538 --> 00:43:29,598
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't want to be at risk.

514
00:43:29,638 --> 00:43:30,339
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a senior now.

515
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:31,659
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to be at risk.

516
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:35,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

517
00:43:35,061 --> 00:43:40,985
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion of Councilor Knight is amended by Councilors Caravaglio, Longo Kern, Camuso, and Penta.

518
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:44,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion for approval by Councilor Knight.

519
00:43:44,787 --> 00:43:46,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call has been requested.

520
00:43:46,476 --> 00:43:47,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

521
00:43:48,738 --> 00:43:49,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Camuso?

522
00:43:49,858 --> 00:43:50,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

523
00:43:50,539 --> 00:43:51,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Carriello?

524
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:51,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

525
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:52,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight?

526
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:53,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

527
00:43:53,781 --> 00:43:54,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Longo Kern?

528
00:43:54,822 --> 00:43:54,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

529
00:43:55,462 --> 00:43:56,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks?

530
00:43:56,423 --> 00:43:56,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

531
00:43:56,963 --> 00:43:57,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Penta?

532
00:43:57,523 --> 00:43:57,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

533
00:43:58,704 --> 00:43:59,465
[SPEAKER_02]: President Del Russo?

534
00:43:59,605 --> 00:43:59,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

535
00:44:00,005 --> 00:44:05,189
[SPEAKER_02]: And the vote of seven in the affirmative, non-negative, the motion passes.

536
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:06,570
[SPEAKER_02]: 15-731 offered by Councilor Knight.

537
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:12,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Be resolved the cost associated with the biannual street sweeping program be forwarded to the council.

538
00:44:13,374 --> 00:44:16,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it further resolved a breakdown of what portion is

539
00:44:16,584 --> 00:44:22,588
[SPEAKER_02]: handled internally and what portion is handled by way of contracted service be included in the analysis?

540
00:44:22,668 --> 00:44:23,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Councillor Knight.

541
00:44:23,729 --> 00:44:25,069
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

542
00:44:25,089 --> 00:44:32,074
[SPEAKER_15]: The reason I bring this resolution forward is because I have concern as to whether or not we're getting the most bang for our buck in terms of our street sweeping.

543
00:44:33,014 --> 00:44:35,276
[SPEAKER_15]: And is that Mr. Geer right there?

544
00:44:36,216 --> 00:44:36,837
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll take the call.

545
00:44:37,958 --> 00:44:42,721
[SPEAKER_15]: No, Mr. President, I bring this resolution forward because I have concern as to whether or not we're getting the most bang for our buck.

546
00:44:43,401 --> 00:44:46,403
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like to see how much it is that we're actually spending on just the street sweeping

547
00:44:46,703 --> 00:44:48,604
[SPEAKER_15]: the subcontracting and what we've done internally.

548
00:44:49,064 --> 00:44:54,367
[SPEAKER_15]: And maybe we can expand from twice a year to three or four or five or six or God forbid twice a week.

549
00:44:58,289 --> 00:44:58,989
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

550
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:02,591
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, I'd like to, uh, amend council and its motion.

551
00:45:02,631 --> 00:45:06,693
[SPEAKER_14]: If he doesn't mind, um, onto why are we screaming the streets when the leaves aren't down?

552
00:45:07,613 --> 00:45:14,617
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, I would think that we're going to net, I mean, uh, we've already started doing the, the leaves are still on the trees.

553
00:45:15,393 --> 00:45:27,524
[SPEAKER_14]: I would think that these trucks are going to have to come by for one more time, but I've already started getting calls from people that, that they are, they're doing the streets and streets a day later, the streets look like they haven't even been done.

554
00:45:28,644 --> 00:45:30,306
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, is there a reason why we started this early?

555
00:45:31,627 --> 00:45:34,449
[SPEAKER_14]: So as amended by, uh, I like that.

556
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:40,715
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to ask that the city, uh, do a second sweeping, um, after the leads are fully done.

557
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:42,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.

558
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:49,512
[SPEAKER_02]: So as amended by Councilor Caviello as to why now, as opposed to when the leaves have come down completely.

559
00:45:49,812 --> 00:45:57,814
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's also important to note that street sweeping, I think we've all gotten the calls, but street sweeping has started and it's going to continue for the next several days and started on Monday.

560
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:04,016
[SPEAKER_15]: And also one of the biggest requests that I've seen from members of the DPW is not to put your leaves in the street.

561
00:46:04,616 --> 00:46:04,956
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.

562
00:46:06,917 --> 00:46:08,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.

563
00:46:09,238 --> 00:46:10,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

564
00:46:11,466 --> 00:46:18,209
[SPEAKER_08]: When you look at the way the street sweeping is done in this community, there is a more intelligent way that it could be done.

565
00:46:18,989 --> 00:46:28,553
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, people still think that this is five years ago when you can just put the big pile of leaves in front of your house and they used to just come down and pick it all up.

566
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:37,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, if we remember that the equipment repair over those years when we did that was significant.

567
00:46:39,298 --> 00:46:40,038
[SPEAKER_08]: With that being said,

568
00:46:40,578 --> 00:46:43,359
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we have a bigger problem that we have to start thinking about, too.

569
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:47,420
[SPEAKER_08]: As Councilor Caviello alluded to, the leaves are not even on the ground yet.

570
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,981
[SPEAKER_08]: What's going to happen is the streets are going to be swept.

571
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:54,141
[SPEAKER_08]: The leaves are going to fall down.

572
00:46:54,541 --> 00:46:56,542
[SPEAKER_08]: The catch basins are going to get clogged.

573
00:46:56,942 --> 00:46:58,522
[SPEAKER_08]: The streets are going to become a sheet of ice.

574
00:46:58,922 --> 00:47:01,623
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to have public safety issues.

575
00:47:02,443 --> 00:47:09,905
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully the DPW, and they advertised the new commissioner's position the other day,

576
00:47:10,464 --> 00:47:16,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully, we can get someone in there that can really tackle this, Mr. President, and tackle it quickly.

577
00:47:16,427 --> 00:47:19,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Because on the heels of street sweeping, it's snow plowing again.

578
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:31,695
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you look back to last year's treacherous year, we're only asking for problems if we get half of the amount of snow that we got last year.

579
00:47:32,335 --> 00:47:37,738
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the best pieces of equipment they own is that big snowblower that was purchased back in the 1970s or the 60s, I believe.

580
00:47:37,818 --> 00:47:38,658
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not even sure.

581
00:47:40,667 --> 00:47:49,231
[SPEAKER_08]: But they had to take that out, get it up and running with Timmy McCarthy and the rest of the mechanics in the garage, and get that out there to widen the streets.

582
00:47:49,411 --> 00:47:51,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Even the small side streets, you couldn't get a fire truck down.

583
00:47:52,272 --> 00:48:02,056
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm just thinking ahead here, where if we start getting the catch basins clogged and icing up, we're going to have some major problems on our hands.

584
00:48:02,116 --> 00:48:03,457
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is late.

585
00:48:03,617 --> 00:48:05,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Normally, the street sweeping is done even earlier than this.

586
00:48:06,478 --> 00:48:08,819
[SPEAKER_08]: But unfortunately, Mother Nature and the

587
00:48:09,948 --> 00:48:15,370
[SPEAKER_08]: The changing colors of the leaves happen later this year, which we do not have any control of.

588
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:22,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Last but not least, this city council pushed far in the past to get later leaf pickup, which we have.

589
00:48:23,093 --> 00:48:28,494
[SPEAKER_08]: But unfortunately, the last leaf pickup is going to be picked up before all the leaves are down.

590
00:48:29,235 --> 00:48:33,456
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's another whole thing that we're going to be dealing with moving forward.

591
00:48:33,496 --> 00:48:38,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe if we can look at waste management, see if they can send an additional pickup as well.

592
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:40,590
[SPEAKER_08]: after most of the leaves are down.

593
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:43,651
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for bringing this up, Councillor Knight.

594
00:48:45,592 --> 00:48:46,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Councillor Pinto.

595
00:48:46,552 --> 00:48:52,873
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things I think you really need to look at is the unfortunate part that this administration has not been able to address.

596
00:48:52,913 --> 00:48:55,134
[SPEAKER_07]: This is three years in a row we've been talking about this.

597
00:48:55,174 --> 00:49:04,476
[SPEAKER_07]: And as a matter of fact, this has become more and more of an issue ever since we got these green barrels on waste management because it's changed the whole type of pickup that's being taking place here in this community.

598
00:49:05,117 --> 00:49:06,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Had this administration had the foresight

599
00:49:07,526 --> 00:49:10,608
[SPEAKER_07]: to recognize that it isn't twice a year the streets need to be swept.

600
00:49:10,808 --> 00:49:15,071
[SPEAKER_07]: When you can go to our sister city of Somerville, they sweep every other week, odd, even, odd, even.

601
00:49:15,491 --> 00:49:17,713
[SPEAKER_07]: They let the people know it's in their telephone bill.

602
00:49:17,793 --> 00:49:20,395
[SPEAKER_07]: I strike that it's in their tax bill.

603
00:49:20,435 --> 00:49:22,856
[SPEAKER_07]: They let them know ahead of time what the game plan is.

604
00:49:22,896 --> 00:49:23,296
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

605
00:49:23,697 --> 00:49:31,762
[SPEAKER_07]: I would hope that the new administration comes in as understanding that these are serious problems that have an impact on the taxpayers here within our community.

606
00:49:32,282 --> 00:49:34,584
[SPEAKER_07]: It's obvious that the present administration doesn't want to address it.

607
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,961
[SPEAKER_07]: The council has addressed it, and they've been right spot on with this thing.

608
00:49:38,421 --> 00:49:42,743
[SPEAKER_07]: The unfortunate part about it is, whether it's a week earlier or a week late, that's not the issue.

609
00:49:42,803 --> 00:49:45,604
[SPEAKER_07]: The fact of the matter is, what are you having up to that point in time?

610
00:49:46,165 --> 00:49:54,948
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't turn around and say, well, we're going to give you an extra week of leaf pickup, but we're going to take away something else, because this is what we have with the contract.

611
00:49:55,789 --> 00:50:01,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Contrary to what all the councillors know, the president administration re-upped the contract for another 10 years, two years ago.

612
00:50:01,691 --> 00:50:03,252
[SPEAKER_07]: The council was never informed of it.

613
00:50:03,979 --> 00:50:13,783
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, as it relates to our rubbish pickup, you just got through building a new building for $14.5 million, and you still are only able to do the street sweeping twice a year.

614
00:50:13,843 --> 00:50:15,044
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes no sense at all.

615
00:50:16,204 --> 00:50:20,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Where is the program that should be out there that addresses matters such as this?

616
00:50:21,326 --> 00:50:22,087
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't exist.

617
00:50:22,167 --> 00:50:23,407
[SPEAKER_07]: You're still talking about it.

618
00:50:23,707 --> 00:50:27,829
[SPEAKER_07]: You're still talking about the potential for the danger, as Councilor Camuso just alluded to.

619
00:50:28,149 --> 00:50:30,850
[SPEAKER_07]: What if it rains, snows, or whatever it might be, the ice, the skidding?

620
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:32,531
[SPEAKER_07]: These are all potential things.

621
00:50:32,927 --> 00:50:35,247
[SPEAKER_07]: And these are the things that should be talked about and discussed.

622
00:50:35,828 --> 00:50:37,268
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what a good manager does.

623
00:50:37,308 --> 00:50:43,749
[SPEAKER_07]: He brings his department heads in, be it a woman or a man, and they discuss these things that are going to have a definite impact.

624
00:50:44,349 --> 00:50:51,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, it's obvious that no discussion has taken place, and we're right back to where we were three years ago coming forward.

625
00:50:52,071 --> 00:50:59,872
[SPEAKER_07]: And now, all you can hope for is you hope that it doesn't snow, and Mother Nature is going to just do its things, and the city is foolishly going out there right now.

626
00:51:00,667 --> 00:51:03,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the question should be, why do you have to go out there right now?

627
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:12,176
[SPEAKER_07]: If the city owns the Sweet Streeper and not knowing how much of that's an outside person, why don't we just wait until the leaves are down and then go out there?

628
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:16,639
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's too much of a thought process because I don't think it's going to exist in this building.

629
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:27,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I would hope that the new council and the new mayor has an understanding that these are issues, these are everyday, common sense, practical issues that should be addressed in a common sense manner.

630
00:51:31,163 --> 00:51:31,903
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Marks.

631
00:51:32,864 --> 00:51:33,864
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

632
00:51:33,904 --> 00:51:35,986
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Councilor Penta just hit the nail on the head.

633
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:39,728
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, we refer to this as a street, uh, sweeping program.

634
00:51:40,528 --> 00:51:42,349
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have a program in the city.

635
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:43,850
[SPEAKER_12]: We never had a program.

636
00:51:45,071 --> 00:51:56,297
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, residents will remember the days that, uh, they used to come around and put a paper, uh, on your tree or on your telephone pole saying there was going to be street sweeping that day or, uh, very shortly.

637
00:51:56,657 --> 00:51:58,638
[SPEAKER_12]: Then they used to go by the police with the blow horns.

638
00:51:59,043 --> 00:52:01,685
[SPEAKER_12]: and say, we're going to sweep your street today, this afternoon.

639
00:52:02,065 --> 00:52:07,649
[SPEAKER_12]: This program, I shouldn't even refer to it as a program, has changed 20 different times.

640
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:10,091
[SPEAKER_12]: We've never had an established program.

641
00:52:10,652 --> 00:52:13,434
[SPEAKER_12]: And what we're lacking right now is notification.

642
00:52:14,394 --> 00:52:19,958
[SPEAKER_12]: They're using the reverse 911 system, but that's inadequate, to be quite frank with you.

643
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:27,384
[SPEAKER_12]: The administration uses an electronic billboard in the square, thinking that that's the notification.

644
00:52:27,792 --> 00:52:31,195
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to drive through the square to find out when street sweeping starts.

645
00:52:32,156 --> 00:52:37,621
[SPEAKER_12]: Then you get a phone call saying, check the city website and that'll tell you when we're gonna be in your neighborhood.

646
00:52:38,181 --> 00:52:41,664
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's just archaic the way things are run.

647
00:52:42,265 --> 00:52:52,854
[SPEAKER_12]: And the voice mail I got the other day said, tagging and towing will take place if deemed necessary.

648
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,158
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, either you're going to tag and tow or you're not.

649
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:02,922
[SPEAKER_12]: If the car's in front of my house, who determines whether it's necessary that they're going to tag or tow?

650
00:53:03,702 --> 00:53:05,543
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, how do you run a program like that?

651
00:53:05,943 --> 00:53:09,826
[SPEAKER_12]: And for many years, the sweepers would go around the trucks.

652
00:53:10,466 --> 00:53:18,931
[SPEAKER_12]: So residents that wanted to have in front of their home swept, they pulled their car in the driveway, and the next schmuck parked in front of their house,

653
00:53:20,218 --> 00:53:23,221
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the truck would go around, and your house would never get swept.

654
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:25,082
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's only twice a year.

655
00:53:26,824 --> 00:53:29,566
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we receive, every year, a national award.

656
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:31,548
[SPEAKER_12]: We're Tree City USA.

657
00:53:33,369 --> 00:53:36,432
[SPEAKER_12]: But the city refuses to clean up the leaves.

658
00:53:37,553 --> 00:53:38,093
[SPEAKER_12]: Think about it.

659
00:53:38,814 --> 00:53:41,716
[SPEAKER_12]: We only sweep twice a year, but we're Tree City USA.

660
00:53:42,077 --> 00:53:42,977
[SPEAKER_12]: What a distinction.

661
00:53:43,438 --> 00:53:47,241
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it really is crazy how this program is run.

662
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:50,653
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's par for the course with this administration.

663
00:53:52,114 --> 00:54:03,022
[SPEAKER_12]: Honestly, nothing really has taken place over the last 28 years in regards to any type of semblance of a program, an organized program.

664
00:54:03,383 --> 00:54:13,150
[SPEAKER_12]: I think if residents knew that they had a posting on their street through signage, you know, they do it in Cambridge, Somerville, Malden, Arlington.

665
00:54:14,215 --> 00:54:15,296
[SPEAKER_12]: Proper signage.

666
00:54:15,816 --> 00:54:19,118
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm not talking about a piece of paper tacked on a tree.

667
00:54:19,758 --> 00:54:25,102
[SPEAKER_12]: You have a metal pole with signage stating your street's going to be swept the third Tuesday of every month.

668
00:54:25,302 --> 00:54:33,367
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can get creative and do odd and even side like they do in Cambridge to alleviate some of the congestion of taking all the cars off the road.

669
00:54:33,787 --> 00:54:35,568
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of things that could be done.

670
00:54:35,969 --> 00:54:37,950
[SPEAKER_12]: But in this city, nothing is ever explored.

671
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:42,953
[SPEAKER_12]: And we put together this makeshift program where they send these sweepers out in a rush.

672
00:54:44,749 --> 00:54:47,671
[SPEAKER_12]: And if they catch cars on your street, they'll just go by.

673
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:53,116
[SPEAKER_12]: And then if they tow, people get upset because there's a lack of notification, which I agree.

674
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,618
[SPEAKER_12]: Not everyone gets that reverse 911 call.

675
00:54:56,399 --> 00:55:01,063
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, it just doesn't make any sense in a city this size.

676
00:55:01,443 --> 00:55:11,612
[SPEAKER_12]: How do you operate a city this size with no coherent program that if residents are aware, they'll move their car, Mr. President?

677
00:55:12,262 --> 00:55:15,083
[SPEAKER_12]: If residents know, this is what I have to do as a resident.

678
00:55:15,363 --> 00:55:18,525
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to have my car off the street the third Tuesday of every month.

679
00:55:19,365 --> 00:55:20,706
[SPEAKER_12]: That's my responsibility.

680
00:55:20,986 --> 00:55:25,148
[SPEAKER_12]: It's posted on my street, it's on the city website, that's my responsibility.

681
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,309
[SPEAKER_12]: I get told, you know, shame on me.

682
00:55:28,029 --> 00:55:40,355
[SPEAKER_12]: But to have a program where it's willy nilly, there's an electronic billboard in the square, you get a reverse 911 call about street sweeping, but you don't get one when they're robbing schools in the area on 911.

683
00:55:42,045 --> 00:55:45,727
[SPEAKER_12]: It just doesn't make any sense, Mr. President.

684
00:55:46,027 --> 00:55:46,947
[SPEAKER_12]: It really doesn't.

685
00:55:47,588 --> 00:55:53,430
[SPEAKER_12]: And Councilor Langel-Kern brought up a couple of weeks ago the abuse of the 911, and I think we're seeing it right now.

686
00:55:53,850 --> 00:56:09,557
[SPEAKER_12]: We're seeing advertisements for road races and everything else going on under the sun, you know, dedications and everything else, but not the proper use of 911, which is for emergency purposes to notify people in neighborhoods about what's going on in your neighborhood.

687
00:56:09,823 --> 00:56:14,367
[SPEAKER_12]: concerns you may have for your children or your senior parents that are living in the city.

688
00:56:14,627 --> 00:56:16,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Concerns like that, Mr. President.

689
00:56:16,168 --> 00:56:34,082
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, you know, I'm, I'm hoping like council appended that the new administration will see fit to implement a true street sweeping program that notifies residents that gets ultimately the idea of a street sweeping program is to sweep the streets.

690
00:56:34,855 --> 00:56:41,317
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you have half your cars still left on your street, like Councilor Camuso said, those leaves are going to find their way into the catch basins.

691
00:56:41,597 --> 00:56:48,038
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to clog up the catch basins by which, Mr. President, that contract has been cut year after year.

692
00:56:48,458 --> 00:56:56,260
[SPEAKER_12]: The private company we hire to clean out the catch basins, the mayor has been slashing that little by little because he doesn't want to hire them.

693
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:04,442
[SPEAKER_12]: And what we're going to see as a result in this community, what we're seeing throughout all our neighborhoods is an increase in flooding because of that, Mr. President.

694
00:57:04,953 --> 00:57:10,976
[SPEAKER_12]: But that's leadership that's not working, Mr. President, and that's what we're stuck with right now.

695
00:57:16,378 --> 00:57:19,180
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Caviello.

696
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:20,040
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

697
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:21,441
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

698
00:57:21,461 --> 00:57:22,561
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion carries.

699
00:57:22,621 --> 00:57:26,143
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso, to take the paper out of order.

700
00:57:27,623 --> 00:57:28,424
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

701
00:57:28,944 --> 00:57:29,624
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

702
00:57:29,644 --> 00:57:29,664
[SPEAKER_02]: 15-737.

703
00:57:31,596 --> 00:57:53,566
[SPEAKER_02]: To the Honorable President, to members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford Mass, 02155, dear Mr. President and Councillors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body approve for payment prior years bills from the Building Department totaling $2,006.74 in accordance with Chapter 4, Paragraph 64, due to office oversight.

704
00:57:54,647 --> 00:57:59,289
[SPEAKER_02]: These bills from March and June of 2015 inadvertently went unpaid.

705
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:01,230
[SPEAKER_02]: The Building Commissioner is present

706
00:58:01,586 --> 00:58:03,587
[SPEAKER_02]: to answer any questions you have.

707
00:58:05,068 --> 00:58:10,690
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Camuso, Councilor, Madam Vice President.

708
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:15,873
[SPEAKER_01]: If we could have the Building Commissioner just come up and explain which bills these were, just so we can.

709
00:58:15,893 --> 00:58:24,216
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, Mr. President, Council Members.

710
00:58:25,037 --> 00:58:27,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Before you tonight, there were two unpaid bills.

711
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:36,142
[SPEAKER_11]: and the amount of $190, and that was for work done on the rooftop units for the Council Chambers air conditioning.

712
00:58:36,182 --> 00:58:38,203
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a couple of contacts that were worn.

713
00:58:38,663 --> 00:58:40,384
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just basically worn out over the years.

714
00:58:40,424 --> 00:58:44,485
[SPEAKER_11]: They had to be replaced and rewired, and that was done this past March.

715
00:58:44,905 --> 00:58:47,726
[SPEAKER_11]: And the other bill, the second bill in the amount of $1,800,

716
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:58,922
[SPEAKER_11]: It was done this past June, and that was a circulator pump upstairs in the boiler room here.

717
00:58:58,942 --> 00:59:00,922
[SPEAKER_11]: The circulator pump had to be replaced.

718
00:59:01,002 --> 00:59:09,285
[SPEAKER_11]: So those were the two bills that are in front of you tonight.

719
00:59:10,226 --> 00:59:14,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Did the mayor say where we were getting the $2,000, what account it was coming from?

720
00:59:14,427 --> 00:59:16,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Councillor Long.

721
00:59:18,553 --> 00:59:22,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Both these vendors, we currently have maintenance contracts with them.

722
00:59:22,895 --> 00:59:27,196
[SPEAKER_11]: One is for the plumbing and one is for the heating and city hall maintenance.

723
00:59:27,956 --> 00:59:32,458
[SPEAKER_11]: And the contracts we have with them are for the maintenance that they do every year.

724
00:59:33,138 --> 00:59:36,499
[SPEAKER_11]: However, these two bills are not covered under the regular maintenance.

725
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:41,281
[SPEAKER_11]: They're outside the scope of that, the repairs on some of the equipment that broke down.

726
00:59:41,761 --> 00:59:44,582
[SPEAKER_11]: So we will be paying this out of the city hall maintenance account.

727
00:59:47,682 --> 00:59:54,626
[SPEAKER_01]: take fiscal year 2016 money out of the maintenance account to pay for this 2000 from 2015?

728
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:56,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, correct.

729
00:59:56,508 --> 00:59:56,748
Okay.

730
00:59:58,269 --> 00:59:58,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

731
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:02,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilor Penta.

732
01:00:03,692 --> 01:00:06,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Mulkey, look up in the ceiling.

733
01:00:06,494 --> 01:00:06,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Sit there.

734
01:00:07,715 --> 01:00:07,995
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

735
01:00:08,455 --> 01:00:09,336
[SPEAKER_07]: It's two and a half years.

736
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:10,436
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on?

737
01:00:10,937 --> 01:00:14,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we just, I just had a meeting this past week with Louise Miller on that.

738
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:16,280
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a report.

739
01:00:17,025 --> 01:00:22,512
[SPEAKER_11]: done by Russo Bar that addresses this couple of issues in that Council.

740
01:00:22,532 --> 01:00:29,763
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the roof parapet, roof repairs, which is also going to entail the cornice work up there, a new roof and repairs to the cupola.

741
01:00:30,379 --> 01:00:33,280
[SPEAKER_11]: And part of that is the council ceiling repairs also.

742
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:41,003
[SPEAKER_11]: And right now we have a report from, um, Russo bar that details all the, um, the areas that need to be repaired.

743
01:00:41,063 --> 01:00:50,066
[SPEAKER_11]: And when I met with Louise Miller last week, we are in the process of, uh, taking the next step, which would be to get a proposal from them to do the bid documents to go out to bid.

744
01:00:53,007 --> 01:00:59,029
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought Mr. President, when Louise Miller was here a few weeks ago, she indicated that the bids are going out and they were, they were supposed to be doing now.

745
01:01:01,475 --> 01:01:04,217
[SPEAKER_07]: So all you have right now is the scope of work that needs to be done?

746
01:01:04,657 --> 01:01:05,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, that's correct.

747
01:01:05,857 --> 01:01:08,098
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a report on the scope of work that needs to be done.

748
01:01:08,158 --> 01:01:08,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

749
01:01:08,418 --> 01:01:09,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have an estimate of that?

750
01:01:09,319 --> 01:01:11,299
[SPEAKER_07]: What that scope is anticipated to be?

751
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:20,543
[SPEAKER_11]: The initial estimate we got was, uh, for $1.5 million for the roof, uh, the roof, parapet repairs in the council ceiling repairs.

752
01:01:23,244 --> 01:01:24,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Can, can that be fixed without the roof?

753
01:01:26,465 --> 01:01:27,786
[SPEAKER_11]: That can be fixed.

754
01:01:27,826 --> 01:01:46,499
[SPEAKER_11]: However, our concern with that is if we repair that now and we don't repair it, do a permanent fix on the leaks we have up there, which is tied in with all the damage that's been on to the Papert wall, that if we do repair it now, it's going to be subject to further damage from any leaks that are going to be occurring up there.

755
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:54,445
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're just saying that approximately 1.5, or whatever that number finally turns out to be, is going to be an expenditure going to be coming out

756
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:57,980
[SPEAKER_07]: this year, the 2016 budget, is that true, Ann?

757
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that where the money would have to come from?

758
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:01,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Or a bond or something?

759
01:02:03,684 --> 01:02:05,986
[SPEAKER_13]: There was no money appropriated in the 2016 budget.

760
01:02:06,126 --> 01:02:06,506
[SPEAKER_13]: Not yet.

761
01:02:06,966 --> 01:02:08,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever that dollar amount is in excess of.

762
01:02:08,968 --> 01:02:10,629
[SPEAKER_13]: More than likely, it would have to be a bond issue.

763
01:02:11,049 --> 01:02:12,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

764
01:02:12,610 --> 01:02:14,051
[SPEAKER_13]: More than likely, it would have to be a bond issue.

765
01:02:14,071 --> 01:02:15,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

766
01:02:15,132 --> 01:02:20,796
[SPEAKER_15]: Did we not appropriate some money in the community improvement initiative that we passed last April for the parapet as part of the?

767
01:02:20,816 --> 01:02:21,537
[SPEAKER_13]: The CPA thing?

768
01:02:21,957 --> 01:02:23,198
[SPEAKER_15]: The community improvement initiative?

769
01:02:24,138 --> 01:02:24,819
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know what you're saying.

770
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:26,300
[SPEAKER_15]: The community improvement initiative?

771
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:29,582
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know what that's about.

772
01:02:30,443 --> 01:02:40,571
[SPEAKER_15]: Yourself, Louise, came before the council for a bond of $1.4 million for various items, removable speed bumps, removable security cameras.

773
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:44,094
[SPEAKER_15]: Part of that, I believe, was the parapet included in that community improvement initiative.

774
01:02:44,114 --> 01:02:45,035
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, the free cash vote last December?

775
01:02:47,244 --> 01:02:49,164
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't remember if there was anything in there for that.

776
01:02:49,184 --> 01:02:50,765
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there was.

777
01:02:50,825 --> 01:02:53,265
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it wasn't free cash.

778
01:02:53,385 --> 01:02:57,927
[SPEAKER_07]: It was an improvement program, so to speak, with a multitude of issues, and that was one of them.

779
01:02:58,007 --> 01:02:59,387
[SPEAKER_13]: And there was money appropriated for it?

780
01:02:59,407 --> 01:02:59,687
[SPEAKER_07]: We did.

781
01:02:59,807 --> 01:03:01,788
[SPEAKER_15]: We had a resurfacing of seven parks.

782
01:03:01,908 --> 01:03:04,809
[SPEAKER_15]: It had the removable speed bumps.

783
01:03:04,909 --> 01:03:06,990
[SPEAKER_15]: It had the security cameras.

784
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:07,690
[SPEAKER_15]: It had $300,000.

785
01:03:07,810 --> 01:03:09,630
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought that was the free cash flow.

786
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:10,551
[SPEAKER_13]: It was $1.4 million, $1.3 million, $1.8 million.

787
01:03:11,867 --> 01:03:17,708
[SPEAKER_15]: had the carriage house, 300,000 for stumps and sidewalk repairs that were related to water.

788
01:03:17,748 --> 01:03:18,328
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

789
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:20,208
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't recall if there was anything in there for that.

790
01:03:20,468 --> 01:03:22,949
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd have to look at it and see if I don't remember anything.

791
01:03:23,069 --> 01:03:24,369
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it couldn't be for free cash.

792
01:03:24,429 --> 01:03:25,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause if that, we wouldn't even be discussing this.

793
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:32,170
[SPEAKER_07]: What we're talking about money that was allegedly put aside and that was that and the parapet was all part of it.

794
01:03:33,331 --> 01:03:35,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought $1.4 million for the community was a bond.

795
01:03:36,291 --> 01:03:37,271
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty sure it was a bond.

796
01:03:41,367 --> 01:03:41,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Move approval.

797
01:03:42,787 --> 01:03:52,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion of approval, uh, by Councilor Camuso seconded by Councilor, uh, Penter, uh, with this amount of money, uh, roll call is, uh, required.

798
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:53,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

799
01:03:54,351 --> 01:03:57,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Let the record reflect, uh, Paul, have I understood this correctly?

800
01:03:58,052 --> 01:03:58,192
[SPEAKER_07]: This,

801
01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:03,690
[SPEAKER_07]: $2,000 is going to come out of this 2016 maintenance account that you have here.

802
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:04,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's correct.

803
01:04:04,291 --> 01:04:05,291
[SPEAKER_11]: This year's account, yes.

804
01:04:05,451 --> 01:04:06,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Could the record please reflect that?

805
01:04:06,812 --> 01:04:07,592
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't say it.

806
01:04:07,913 --> 01:04:08,253
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

807
01:04:08,473 --> 01:04:09,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Could the record reflect?

808
01:04:09,273 --> 01:04:17,117
[SPEAKER_02]: The record reflects the money is coming out of the 2016 budget account for maintenance of city buildings.

809
01:04:20,959 --> 01:04:22,780
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's the building department, not city council.

810
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:23,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Building department.

811
01:04:23,721 --> 01:04:24,261
[SPEAKER_02]: The building department.

812
01:04:24,281 --> 01:04:25,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Building department maintenance account.

813
01:04:25,942 --> 01:04:26,802
[SPEAKER_07]: For maintenance.

814
01:04:26,842 --> 01:04:27,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Building department maintenance account.

815
01:04:28,023 --> 01:04:28,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

816
01:04:30,550 --> 01:04:31,030

870
01:07:09,929 --> 01:07:20,373
[SPEAKER_02]: 15-733 petition by Mr. Joseph Villione, 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, Massachusetts to address the council on a new rule to ensure free speech rights

871
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:21,700
[SPEAKER_09]: for petitioners.

872
01:07:22,501 --> 01:07:25,122
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank you, Council President, for being an honorable man.

873
01:07:25,142 --> 01:07:27,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Please state your name and address for the record.

874
01:07:28,043 --> 01:07:31,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Joseph Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

875
01:07:31,425 --> 01:07:38,909
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank you because this paper is about people being able to speak unimpeded without interruptions.

876
01:07:39,769 --> 01:07:47,673
[SPEAKER_09]: When Thomas Jefferson crafted the Declaration of Independence, he pointed to certain unalienable rights, which is like inalienable, unalienable, same thing.

877
01:07:48,488 --> 01:07:52,149
[SPEAKER_09]: unable to be taken away from or given away by the possessor.

878
01:07:52,809 --> 01:07:56,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Freedom of religion the most inalienable of all human rights.

879
01:07:56,850 --> 01:08:04,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Jefferson understood unalienable rights as fixed rights given to us by our creator rather than by government.

880
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:11,533
[SPEAKER_09]: The emphasis on our creator is crucial because it shows the rights are permanent just as the creator is permanent.

881
01:08:12,334 --> 01:08:14,254
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm speaking directly to the citizens of Medford.

882
01:08:14,888 --> 01:08:19,210
[SPEAKER_09]: The city council in 2015 and 2016 has to start listening.

883
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:34,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Citizens of Medford pay for this expensive city council, the cable TV which airs the council meetings, and we have a right, that inalienable right you've heard speak of in the Declaration of Independence.

884
01:08:35,297 --> 01:08:43,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Since the TV station represents free speech, and since the issuing authority could not control the TV station during the election, he shut it down.

885
01:08:43,885 --> 01:08:45,266
[SPEAKER_09]: The citizens are at a loss.

886
01:08:46,367 --> 01:08:51,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Many fear voicing their opinion, which renders the city of Medford a place akin to Havana.

887
01:08:51,673 --> 01:08:55,997
[SPEAKER_09]: To paraphrase the city solicitor, who likened the TV station to that place in Cuba.

888
01:08:56,758 --> 01:09:05,026
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, when I see my old friend Pat Fiorello, God rest his soul, will come up here, and the nice old guy had, he had a lot of passion.

889
01:09:06,953 --> 01:09:08,174
[SPEAKER_09]: He was sometimes interrupted.

890
01:09:08,234 --> 01:09:25,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Stirella puts a lot of energy at his age into writing papers and bringing presentations only to have point of information and, oh, let's get the city clerk to give us those papers to impede the public that's paying an expensive city council.

891
01:09:25,909 --> 01:09:35,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I'm just asking right now that the council be more attentive to the citizens, even if we come up here week after week after week.

892
01:09:36,077 --> 01:09:37,198
[SPEAKER_09]: That shows that we're concerned.

893
01:09:37,598 --> 01:09:45,544
[SPEAKER_09]: That shows that we're volunteering our civic duty, our civic-mindedness.

894
01:09:45,604 --> 01:09:47,085
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just trying to improve our community.

895
01:09:47,105 --> 01:09:47,825
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all we're doing.

896
01:09:48,546 --> 01:09:51,468
[SPEAKER_09]: So I really want to thank the Council President tonight for doing the right thing.

897
01:09:51,548 --> 01:09:52,628
[SPEAKER_09]: I really appreciate it.

898
01:09:52,648 --> 01:09:54,930
[SPEAKER_09]: And congratulations, Mr. De La Rosa, on your victory.

899
01:09:57,852 --> 01:09:58,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

900
01:09:59,613 --> 01:10:03,076
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to refer to the Committee on Roles, all those in favor?

901
01:10:03,956 --> 01:10:04,637
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

[SPEAKER_02]: on the motion of council night to take papers in the hand of the clerk.

[SPEAKER_02]: It was, uh, item number 15 dash, uh, five 73 that came to us and was sent back to the, uh, uh, zoning amendments, uh, board.

907
01:10:36,407 --> 01:10:55,238
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, uh, to the honorable, uh, president and members of the Medford city council from Lauren D Lorenzo director, October 28th, 2015 regarding the proposed zoning amendment to safe access to medical marijuana in the city of Medford recommendation to the city council from the community development board.

908
01:10:55,858 --> 01:11:01,742
[SPEAKER_02]: The following, uh, following a duly advertised public hearing conducted on October 5th and October 7th, 2015,

909
01:11:04,616 --> 01:11:06,977
[SPEAKER_02]: August 5th and October 7th, 2015.

910
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:11,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Councillor.

911
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:14,742
[SPEAKER_02]: So this came before us.

912
01:11:14,802 --> 01:11:21,125
[SPEAKER_02]: We sent it back to the Zoning Board for their perusal and public hearings.

913
01:11:21,605 --> 01:11:26,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Our approval of this will then allow it to go to a further public hearing, Mr. Clerk.

914
01:11:28,676 --> 01:11:37,701
[SPEAKER_02]: in advertisement, uh, with the following, uh, amendments to the original paper that were made, uh, by the zoning board.

915
01:11:38,502 --> 01:11:46,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and these were some of these were, um, uh, technical, uh, amendments as you can see in the document.

916
01:11:47,307 --> 01:11:57,453
[SPEAKER_02]: So our purpose tonight, uh, is to, uh, consider these, uh, additions that were made and then to, uh, send the

917
01:11:57,955 --> 01:12:01,018

[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

921

[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Knight.

922
01:12:15,150 --> 01:12:21,055
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it would also be very important that we invite a director of prevention and outreach now, newly hired, newly filled position.

923
01:12:22,272 --> 01:12:25,633
[SPEAKER_15]: It falls right in our wheelhouse in terms of our substance abuse outreach coordinator.

924
01:12:25,653 --> 01:12:27,733
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like to invite Penny as well.

925
01:12:28,014 --> 01:12:28,394

928
01:12:46,338 --> 01:12:47,058
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

929

944
01:13:51,377 --> 01:13:52,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks.

945
01:13:55,138 --> 01:13:55,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

946
01:13:55,958 --> 01:13:57,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I say United or Marks?

947
01:13:57,798 --> 01:13:58,199
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

948
01:13:58,259 --> 01:13:58,639
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all right.

949
01:13:58,659 --> 01:13:59,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks, I apologize.

950
01:13:59,579 --> 01:14:01,399
[SPEAKER_12]: I was saying, wow, he offered the same thing I did.

951
01:14:01,519 --> 01:14:05,060
[SPEAKER_12]: That's great.

952
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:12,042
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, that is the crosswalk that's the entrance to the stop and shop on Riverside Ave.

953
01:14:13,083 --> 01:14:19,146
[SPEAKER_12]: It is poorly painted if it's been painted at all, and it's heavily traversed.

954
01:14:20,026 --> 01:14:38,633
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was wondering maybe if the city clerk could check into it, but when we voted for the Panera drive-through, one of the contingencies on that was they were going to do the sidewalk over on their side of the street, which they're doing currently right now, and across the street,

955
01:14:39,218 --> 01:14:42,339
[SPEAKER_12]: They were going to do the sidewalk and improve the two crosswalks.

956
01:14:43,459 --> 01:14:46,760
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm not sure, I thought that was part of the report.

957
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:57,102
[SPEAKER_12]: If you could check into that, but needless to say, the crosswalk at 510, I think it's 510, right?

958
01:14:57,362 --> 01:14:57,562
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

959
01:14:57,842 --> 01:15:00,683
[SPEAKER_12]: 510 Riverside Ave needs to be painted immediately.

960
01:15:00,803 --> 01:15:08,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you mind amending that, that the council also be updated on the status of, I think one of the conditions we asked for,

961
01:15:08,902 --> 01:15:22,752
[SPEAKER_02]: was that a do not block the grid indication be painted on the street there as well so that gridlock not be created regarding the entrance and egress from the parking lots.

962
01:15:23,712 --> 01:15:30,337
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's absolutely as amended by Councillor Marks, because it would be good for us to get an update on that as well while we're on that subject.

963
01:15:30,637 --> 01:15:34,320
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the motion of Councillor Marks as amended by Councillor Marks, all those in favour?

964
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:36,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion carries.

965
01:15:36,701 --> 01:15:37,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Offered by Councillor Knight.

966
01:15:38,035 --> 01:15:48,502
[SPEAKER_02]: at this time, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council invite Councilor-Elect Falco and Councilor-Elect Scarpelli to attend the remaining council meetings as guests of the chair.

967
01:15:48,623 --> 01:15:49,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight.

968
01:15:49,783 --> 01:15:50,644
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Mr. President.

969
01:15:50,704 --> 01:15:59,390
[SPEAKER_15]: When I was newly elected last term, I was very fortunate to be invited up by then Councilor-President Mayarco to sit in on the meetings and it was a very beneficial exercise.

970
01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:07,696
[SPEAKER_15]: I was able to hit the ground running in January and I think it's only proper that we extend that same courtesy to our newly elected city councilors that are going to be taking office in January.

971
01:16:08,862 --> 01:16:09,182
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

972
01:16:09,202 --> 01:16:10,763
[SPEAKER_15]: I ask my colleagues to support the resolution.

973
01:16:11,263 --> 01:16:13,665
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

974
01:16:13,805 --> 01:16:13,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

975
01:16:14,025 --> 01:16:15,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion carries.

976
01:16:15,866 --> 01:16:24,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Offered by Councilors Marks and Vice President Longo-Kern, be it resolved that the city allow free parking during the month of December.

977
01:16:24,911 --> 01:16:25,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

978
01:16:26,251 --> 01:16:27,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam Vice President.

979
01:16:28,272 --> 01:16:29,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

980
01:16:31,434 --> 01:16:36,097
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody knows that this council has requested free 15-minute parking, free half-hour parking.

981
01:16:36,117 --> 01:16:38,678
[SPEAKER_01]: I think free parking with enforcement

982
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:42,001
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really hasn't come to fruition.

983
01:16:42,082 --> 01:16:56,089
[SPEAKER_01]: But a business owner reached out to the council recently and said, with the holiday season, the shopping season, people are busy getting their nails done, going to CVS, going to traverse our businesses, grab an ice cream.

984
01:16:57,209 --> 01:17:01,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not give the people of Medford the ability to park for free?

985
01:17:02,132 --> 01:17:07,755
[SPEAKER_01]: We can keep the enforcement aspect of it, somehow create a way that we can allow people to

986
01:17:08,462 --> 01:17:11,323
[SPEAKER_01]: patronize our businesses for free during the December month.

987
01:17:11,743 --> 01:17:12,864
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a great idea.

988
01:17:12,884 --> 01:17:20,766
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going as far as we want, which is the, you know, half hour, hour free parking to help, you know, the economy and business.

989
01:17:21,206 --> 01:17:22,527
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is somewhere.

990
01:17:22,547 --> 01:17:27,809
[SPEAKER_01]: It is good spirit for the holiday season, and I hope that's something the mayor will think about doing.

991
01:17:28,289 --> 01:17:30,650
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that it can be done, and it can be worked in.

992
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:37,792
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, whether the city has to sacrifice a little income with regards to 15 minutes per quarter, then so be it.

993
01:17:38,403 --> 01:17:43,125
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's a good resolve, and I hope my council colleagues can support that.

994
01:17:43,605 --> 01:17:47,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I got an email on that, too, from a merchant in West Medford.

995
01:17:48,707 --> 01:17:49,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Councillor Marks.

996
01:17:49,947 --> 01:17:50,887
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

997
01:17:51,628 --> 01:17:53,188
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's a great idea.

998
01:17:53,248 --> 01:18:07,873
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the business owners and also anyone that patronizes the businesses within our five business districts would find that as a welcome to come and do some shopping.

999
01:18:08,734 --> 01:18:13,876
[SPEAKER_12]: in particular to small businesses in our community, and I support this wholeheartedly.

1000
01:18:14,276 --> 01:18:14,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.

1001
01:18:14,676 --> 01:18:22,999
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of approval by Councilor, Vice President Longo-Kern, as amended by Councilor Marks, Councilor Pinto wishes to speak on this.

1002
01:18:23,639 --> 01:18:27,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Today I attended the Traffic Commission meeting, and this issue was brought up.

1003
01:18:27,941 --> 01:18:35,503
[SPEAKER_07]: As a result of bringing it up, there was a lady there from Park Medford, a lovely lady, and unfortunately she wasn't in the decision-making process.

1004
01:18:35,723 --> 01:18:36,584
[SPEAKER_07]: She would take it back.

1005
01:18:37,184 --> 01:18:37,704
[SPEAKER_07]: I did bring up

1006
01:18:38,217 --> 01:18:45,260
[SPEAKER_07]: The resolution that Councillor Marks introduced some months ago regarding the 15 minutes, which would came down to 15 minutes before and after.

1007
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,982
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, there was no answer to that other than we're working on it.

1008
01:18:49,162 --> 01:18:50,863
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know how long they're going to work on it.

1009
01:18:51,303 --> 01:19:04,029
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the more you start to take away from Park Medford, the more they're going to push back because they're either going to tell you the City of Medford won't take its share of the 32% as compared to what they're supposed to be getting.

1010
01:19:04,689 --> 01:19:07,270
[SPEAKER_07]: The other part of that, which is now going to be very interesting,

1011
01:19:07,951 --> 01:19:19,536
[SPEAKER_07]: During this last campaign for mayor, the newly elected mayor indicated that she was going to have a senior program that would allow seniors to park for nothing.

1012
01:19:20,276 --> 01:19:26,879
[SPEAKER_07]: And if seniors were to park for nothing here in the city of Medford, that's another financial issue that Park Medford is going to have to take into consideration.

1013
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:32,882
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was also the thought process of giving seniors $1,000 rebate on their real estate insurance.

1014
01:19:32,942 --> 01:19:35,003
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, these are huge.

1015
01:19:35,624 --> 01:19:38,725
[SPEAKER_07]: financial impact issues here for the city of Medford to deal with.

1016
01:19:39,106 --> 01:19:53,052
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would hope that the new incoming council and those of you that are returning have a better understanding of what's going on because you're making a serious financial impact, not only on Park Medford, but you're making it also on the city of Medford's financial stability.

1017
01:19:53,552 --> 01:19:56,393
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's something that needs to be addressed seriously.

1018
01:19:56,994 --> 01:20:04,157
[SPEAKER_07]: If the city of Medford, in fact, wants to go to free parking in December, I don't know how you're going to do it because I don't know who's going to pay the price for that.

1019
01:20:05,014 --> 01:20:11,759
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm quite sure that if I were Park Medford, I would tell you, I'm not going to give you anything because you're telling me, you know, you want to have free parking.

1020
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:13,521
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's their end of the bargain?

1021
01:20:13,561 --> 01:20:14,502
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not in the contract.

1022
01:20:14,942 --> 01:20:16,663
[SPEAKER_07]: So something's going to have to be mitigated for that.

1023
01:20:17,084 --> 01:20:24,830
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would hope this council goes back and reads the contract and looks at the areas in the contract that you are specifically obligated for and to.

1024
01:20:25,991 --> 01:20:26,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Same thing with them.

1025
01:20:27,172 --> 01:20:28,132
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see any month.

1026
01:20:28,473 --> 01:20:29,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds like a great idea.

1027
01:20:29,654 --> 01:20:34,017
[SPEAKER_07]: These are all nice for the purposes of having it,

1028
01:20:34,418 --> 01:20:37,279
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a financial impact for both parties.

1029
01:20:37,839 --> 01:20:41,280
[SPEAKER_07]: City, Annisville Park, Medford City, it's great for the patrons.

1030
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:42,261
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great for the business.

1031
01:20:43,041 --> 01:20:44,861
[SPEAKER_07]: And it'll actually serve a purpose, too.

1032
01:20:45,502 --> 01:20:49,783
[SPEAKER_07]: The purpose it'll serve is you really didn't need the kiosks, and you didn't need the meters.

1033
01:20:49,863 --> 01:20:56,565
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're going to allow these people to park for nothing, and you have a two-hour traffic enforcement time period, what a way to really see what's going on.

1034
01:20:57,206 --> 01:21:00,447
[SPEAKER_07]: But you won't see that happen, because it doesn't seem to be that.

1035
01:21:00,507 --> 01:21:01,347
[SPEAKER_07]: But I will tell you this.

1036
01:21:02,096 --> 01:21:06,700
[SPEAKER_07]: There is an impact that will be felt on both sides, and I don't know who's going to win on this one.

1037
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:09,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, I don't think the taxpayer's going to win on this.

1038
01:21:09,502 --> 01:21:12,124
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great idea, but somebody's going to have to pay for it.

1039
01:21:13,405 --> 01:21:15,127
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion for approval, all those in favor?

1040
01:21:15,627 --> 01:21:15,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

1041
01:21:15,807 --> 01:21:16,408
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

1042
01:21:16,468 --> 01:21:17,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion carries.

1043
01:21:19,410 --> 01:21:28,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, offered by Councilor Pinto, be it resolved that the matter of Medford Square bus stops and construction activity be discussed.

1044
01:21:28,958 --> 01:21:29,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Pinto.

1045
01:21:29,799 --> 01:21:31,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, some five weeks ago,

1046
01:21:31,708 --> 01:21:39,551
[SPEAKER_07]: I put a resolution on the council calendar as it relates to the bus stops in Medford Square, where they were going, and as a result of the Craddock Bridge construction.

1047
01:21:40,091 --> 01:21:41,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I haven't heard anything.

1048
01:21:41,872 --> 01:21:45,514
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought you were going to do something about it as the chairperson of the council.

1049
01:21:46,314 --> 01:21:49,835
[SPEAKER_07]: I have received no letter, no correspondence from anybody as it relates to that.

1050
01:21:50,536 --> 01:21:52,036
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't make any sense at all.

1051
01:21:52,376 --> 01:22:01,140
[SPEAKER_07]: We just went through an uncomfortable situation in South Medford two weeks ago as it relates to bus stops over there that seemed to be a problematic situation.

1052
01:22:01,547 --> 01:22:11,716
[SPEAKER_07]: possibly they need to be removed or resolved to allow businesses to operate and have the residents in a better position and a more of a comfortable position between the two.

1053
01:22:12,476 --> 01:22:21,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we have this past Saturday evening, unbeknownst to anyone, they decided to come in and drop the bridge in Medford Square without letting any of the business folks know what's going on.

1054
01:22:22,384 --> 01:22:26,888
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea of what's going on here in this city as it relates to this kratik bridge.

1055
01:22:26,928 --> 01:22:28,069
[SPEAKER_07]: We have not been apprised.

1056
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:28,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Last week,

1057
01:22:31,747 --> 01:22:32,969
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no notice to anybody.

1058
01:22:33,049 --> 01:22:35,931
[SPEAKER_07]: No notice to the police department, no notice to the Office of Community Development.

1059
01:22:36,372 --> 01:22:38,674
[SPEAKER_07]: If the mayor knew about it, well, good luck to him.

1060
01:22:39,254 --> 01:22:45,239
[SPEAKER_07]: The bottom line to this is you can't operate a city the way it's going.

1061
01:22:45,259 --> 01:22:47,962
[SPEAKER_07]: It just continuously gets worse and worse and worse.

1062
01:22:48,963 --> 01:22:53,927
[SPEAKER_07]: The biggest thing that's going to interrupt business development in Medford Square is taking place.

1063
01:22:54,688 --> 01:22:57,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Bus stops are not even being looked at or resolved.

1064
01:22:57,430 --> 01:23:04,813
[SPEAKER_07]: The MBTA, if you sent the letter out, Mr. Finn, I don't know, you said you did, if you sent the letter out and they haven't responded and there's been no follow-up, I don't know.

1065
01:23:05,633 --> 01:23:12,756
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know who to blame on this one here right now because all I can tell you is the city council's been on top of this, on top of this on behalf of the business merchants.

1066
01:23:13,176 --> 01:23:17,158
[SPEAKER_07]: The chamber hasn't been notified, the council hasn't been notified, OCD hasn't been notified.

1067
01:23:17,825 --> 01:23:24,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Last week we talked about the rats as a result of the construction over here on the businesses on Riverside Avenue.

1068
01:23:24,869 --> 01:23:26,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, no discussion on that, nothing.

1069
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:28,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's the mitigation to that?

1070
01:23:28,831 --> 01:23:38,776
[SPEAKER_07]: And that should have been a huge mitigation by the city of Medford with the contractor on those rats, because any time you disturb water and the foundation of the water is around it, you know you're going to be involved with that.

1071
01:23:39,076 --> 01:23:43,098
[SPEAKER_07]: And for them to turn around and say you can't get mitigation, that's BS in plain English.

1072
01:23:43,930 --> 01:23:50,254
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Mr. President, I'm asking you once again, immediately, through you, I don't know what the city clerk, I don't know what the letter, we never got a copy of it.

1073
01:23:50,614 --> 01:24:01,541
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why they're not responding to the city of Medford to come here to discuss the bus stops, because those bus stops in Medford Square need to be discussed and action needs to be taken immediately.

1074
01:24:02,101 --> 01:24:09,826
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe, as the records will indicate, we ask them also to come and take a look at South Medford, because they have a similar problem in a different way.

1075
01:24:10,166 --> 01:24:12,147
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can do kill two birds with one stone.

1076
01:24:12,668 --> 01:24:20,013
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm employing upon you, Mr. President, to call tomorrow morning and have them here within the next week, because this is making no sense at all.

1077
01:24:20,293 --> 01:24:28,258
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's unfair for a business person to lose money having their business be interrupted at 8, 9 o'clock at night.

1078
01:24:28,318 --> 01:24:30,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Main Street was shut off without notice.

1079
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:31,540
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that.

1080
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:34,142
[SPEAKER_07]: But to have this done and no notification,

1081
01:24:34,552 --> 01:24:45,340
[SPEAKER_07]: That just tells you that there is no professionalism in this bridge, there is absolutely no communication, and there's no public awareness as it relates to the public safety part of it, public health and public safety.

1082
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:48,382
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Mr. Finn, you said you sent the letter out.

1083
01:24:48,422 --> 01:24:49,443
[SPEAKER_07]: I never saw a copy of it.

1084
01:24:49,463 --> 01:24:50,844
[SPEAKER_07]: We're running five weeks now.

1085
01:24:51,144 --> 01:24:55,107
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what it takes to move these people, but I would appreciate it, Mr. President.

1086
01:24:55,147 --> 01:24:58,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Finn Well, get this resolved, and I'm going to call a committee of the whole for next week.

1087
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:03,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Before next week's meeting, we're going to have a committee of the whole with the people from Shepard's Brooks.

1088
01:25:04,742 --> 01:25:05,162
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

1089
01:25:05,422 --> 01:25:05,662
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1090
01:25:05,722 --> 01:25:05,862
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1091
01:25:05,882 --> 01:25:07,803
[SPEAKER_06]: You want, you want the tea, not Sheppard Brooks.

1092
01:25:07,863 --> 01:25:09,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll get the tea in.

1093
01:25:09,183 --> 01:25:09,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1094
01:25:09,763 --> 01:25:10,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clark.

1095
01:25:12,984 --> 01:25:21,606
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we do have one community on, on the unfinished business, the table, which does request the MBTA.

1096
01:25:21,646 --> 01:25:23,066
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the date that you sent the letter out?

1097
01:25:23,086 --> 01:25:24,306
[SPEAKER_07]: No, this is table.

1098
01:25:24,326 --> 01:25:25,267
[SPEAKER_07]: This is still in here.

1099
01:25:25,907 --> 01:25:26,047
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1100
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:31,868
[SPEAKER_07]: The Memphis city council voted almost four to five weeks ago to have the MBTA come to the city method for the purposes

1101
01:25:32,217 --> 01:25:33,137
[SPEAKER_07]: of coming to here.

1102
01:25:33,218 --> 01:25:34,178
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't table anything.

1103
01:25:34,498 --> 01:25:36,359
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe the council voted seven to nothing.

1104
01:25:36,419 --> 01:25:40,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I think believe went to the committee with the transportation committee.

1105
01:25:40,361 --> 01:25:40,701
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

1106
01:25:41,022 --> 01:25:41,682
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the letter.

1107
01:25:41,702 --> 01:25:46,364
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm asking you the copy of the letter that you sent out from the council asking them to come.

1108
01:25:46,824 --> 01:25:47,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's, let's get them in.

1109
01:25:48,745 --> 01:25:49,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get them in.

1110
01:25:49,366 --> 01:25:53,288
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is the table item that didn't, hasn't been ordered on you.

1111
01:25:53,308 --> 01:25:53,808
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not.

1112
01:25:53,908 --> 01:25:55,309
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1113
01:25:55,369 --> 01:26:01,412
[SPEAKER_15]: If I remember correctly, there was a lot of discussion about a lot of different bus stops, a lot of different issues that we needed to take care of with the mass DOT.

1114
01:26:02,052 --> 01:26:09,974
[SPEAKER_15]: And the vote that we took was to have a subcommittee on transportation meeting to actually identify what these issues are, and then we can present them to the members of the MassDOT.

1115
01:26:10,094 --> 01:26:12,655
[SPEAKER_15]: But until we get there, I don't think it's going to be a fruitful discussion.

1116
01:26:12,695 --> 01:26:15,356
[SPEAKER_15]: We can bring them in and say, move this bus stop and move that bus stop.

1117
01:26:15,436 --> 01:26:16,136
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, now what?

1118
01:26:16,456 --> 01:26:17,216
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what I mean?

1119
01:26:17,236 --> 01:26:19,777
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a laundry list of things that need to be taken care of, including

1120
01:26:20,467 --> 01:26:26,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Caviello's resolution from two weeks ago relative to the train tracks at West Medford and those ugly yellow things that are standing up in the middle.

1121
01:26:26,809 --> 01:26:30,050
[SPEAKER_15]: We had a lot of concerns about the bus stops in South Medford in front of Oasis.

1122
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:32,131
[SPEAKER_15]: We had concerns about the bus stops in Medford Square.

1123
01:26:32,451 --> 01:26:34,252
[SPEAKER_15]: We had concerns about the Craddock Bridge project.

1124
01:26:34,292 --> 01:26:37,293
[SPEAKER_15]: We've had concerns about the maintenance and upkeep at the West Medford commuter rail station.

1125
01:26:37,333 --> 01:26:41,514
[SPEAKER_15]: So there are a number of issues surrounding the MBTA and DOT that we're looking for action on.

1126
01:26:41,534 --> 01:26:44,875
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it would only make sense for us to put a list of something together, Mr. President.

1127
01:26:44,955 --> 01:26:45,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of correction.

1128
01:26:45,776 --> 01:26:46,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of correction.

1129
01:26:46,416 --> 01:26:49,357
[SPEAKER_07]: What Councilor Knight is alluding to is the resolution that was passed last week.

1130
01:26:49,738 --> 01:26:56,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking about the one that the council separately voted on five weeks ago and the letter was sent out relative to Medford Square and the bus stops.

1131
01:26:56,744 --> 01:27:00,868
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything else goes right to my point, Mr. President, but that's a separate issue.

1132
01:27:01,148 --> 01:27:02,869
[SPEAKER_15]: It's craziness that we're going to do.

1133
01:27:02,930 --> 01:27:05,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I have the floor?

1134
01:27:06,533 --> 01:27:07,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1135
01:27:07,333 --> 01:27:09,535
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a separate resolution five weeks ago.

1136
01:27:09,555 --> 01:27:12,578
[SPEAKER_07]: The council voted seven to nothing to have it go to the tee.

1137
01:27:12,901 --> 01:27:17,184
[SPEAKER_07]: For the lady to come here, the lady representative, to come here and discuss the bus stops in Medford Square, where it's going.

1138
01:27:17,484 --> 01:27:21,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything else that was talked about was brought up last week as an addendum.

1139
01:27:21,707 --> 01:27:26,531
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we notice it, the very last thing on it also included Medford Square, because we haven't had an answer.

1140
01:27:26,771 --> 01:27:29,053
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm asking, Mr. Clerk, what's the copy?

1141
01:27:29,073 --> 01:27:31,975
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a copy of the letter that was sent out from five weeks ago.

1142
01:27:32,035 --> 01:27:34,156
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get to the bottom of this, Mr. President.

1143
01:27:34,196 --> 01:27:35,097
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, I want to know.

1144
01:27:35,237 --> 01:27:38,720
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to have a copy of the letter, because if the letter hasn't been sent out, we've got a problem here.

1145
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:40,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Counselor.

1146
01:27:40,915 --> 01:27:46,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Next week I will have a committee of the whole called committee of the whole next Tuesday for Shepard Brooks.

1147
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:48,161
[SPEAKER_02]: We had asked for that.

1148
01:27:48,201 --> 01:27:49,341
[SPEAKER_02]: The council had asked for that.

1149
01:27:50,122 --> 01:27:51,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and let's get them in here.

1150
01:27:52,524 --> 01:28:00,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we're going to do when, uh, for next Tuesday, uh, to get the minute six o'clock to give us an update on what's going on there.

1151
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:02,892
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're also going to ask that, uh,

1152
01:28:04,532 --> 01:28:13,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Louise Miller come to speak to us as well, and maybe she can give us some preliminary information on that bond request.

1153
01:28:13,818 --> 01:28:19,462
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, would it make sense for us to maybe get an opinion from Mr. Moki as well as to what he feels is the status of the structure is down there?

1154
01:28:19,482 --> 01:28:20,422
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be very helpful.

1155
01:28:20,482 --> 01:28:23,244
[SPEAKER_07]: So we will also invite Mr. Moki.

1156
01:28:24,945 --> 01:28:25,866
[SPEAKER_07]: next week at six o'clock.

1157
01:28:26,046 --> 01:28:26,546
[SPEAKER_07]: What are we doing?

1158
01:28:26,826 --> 01:28:28,867
[SPEAKER_07]: You doing the committee of the whole also for the bus stops or not?

1159
01:28:29,087 --> 01:28:29,227
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1160
01:28:29,688 --> 01:28:31,048
[SPEAKER_02]: So when are we going to find out?

1161
01:28:31,569 --> 01:28:39,693
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk to councilor, uh, Mr. Clark, we're going to find out what the status is of that letter and we'll get them invited as well.

1162
01:28:39,873 --> 01:28:41,174
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll have that in the near term.

1163
01:28:41,434 --> 01:28:48,758
[SPEAKER_07]: If I remember correctly, two weeks ago when we had that, I asked you for an update and you turned to the clerk and you asked the clerk said you still haven't had a response back yet.

1164
01:28:49,852 --> 01:28:51,553
[SPEAKER_07]: That goes back to the first.

1165
01:28:52,073 --> 01:28:53,334
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get to the bottom of that.

1166
01:28:54,134 --> 01:28:54,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1167
01:28:54,914 --> 01:29:00,597
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the motion of Councillor Penta that we just read, all those in favour?

1168
01:29:03,258 --> 01:29:09,121
[SPEAKER_02]: There was the discussion of the traffic in Memphis Square and the bridge in construction.

1169
01:29:10,021 --> 01:29:12,842
[SPEAKER_01]: And the motion is to call the meeting?

1170
01:29:13,602 --> 01:29:13,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1171
01:29:14,383 --> 01:29:15,143
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favour?

1172
01:29:15,363 --> 01:29:15,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

1173
01:29:15,803 --> 01:29:16,424
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

1174
01:29:18,109 --> 01:29:25,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the property owners of the Fells Plaza across from Aldi remove the metal box container.

1175
01:29:26,055 --> 01:29:26,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks.

1176
01:29:28,277 --> 01:29:29,298
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1177
01:29:29,598 --> 01:29:36,784
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, that Fells Plaza is notorious for, uh, these giant metal box containers, uh, for drop-offs.

1178
01:29:37,544 --> 01:29:47,572
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, there's one now we were successful a while back moving a few, uh, near stop and shop, but, uh, there's one in front of the Aldi's that, uh, is a book.

1179
01:29:48,466 --> 01:29:49,427
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, depository.

1180
01:29:49,867 --> 01:29:55,291
[SPEAKER_12]: However, if you go out there at any given time, there's three computers, a mattress and a sofa sitting out there.

1181
01:29:55,952 --> 01:30:05,419
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and, uh, the neighbors across the street, although they're on the other side of the Felsway, uh, very upset the fact that they have to look at this trash out there.

1182
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:16,988
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and I would ask that we reach out to the property owner of that particular section of stores and ask that that, uh, box be removed immediately.

1183
01:30:17,398 --> 01:30:20,860
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, uh, on behalf of the area neighbors.

1184
01:30:23,061 --> 01:30:23,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.

[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of counselor marks, all those in favor, all those motion carries the records of the October 27th meeting were passed to councilor Penta.

1186
01:30:35,187 --> 01:30:36,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Counselor, how did you find those records?

1187
01:30:39,029 --> 01:30:40,710
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you have a recommendation for them?

01:30:40,730 --> 01:30:44,832
