1
00:00:00,355 --> 00:00:05,419
[SPEAKER_17]: So comprehensive plan by its very nature makes recommendations and informed zoning change.

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:12,866
[SPEAKER_17]: We are very aware that there are many things in the city that need or should be probably change in our zoning.

3
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:18,665
[SPEAKER_17]: At the same time, our zoning hasn't been changed comprehensively since 1965.

4
00:00:20,367 --> 00:00:27,697
[SPEAKER_17]: And in that time, state laws have changed, edits have been made to the zoning ordinance, things have changed, things have gotten a little messy.

5
00:00:28,198 --> 00:00:31,603
[SPEAKER_17]: So the city council decided to engage attorney Mark Bobrowski

6
00:00:32,023 --> 00:00:41,792
[SPEAKER_17]: to in layman's term, clean up recodify the zoning ordinance to bring it in line with the legal statute that we're operating under today.

7
00:00:42,773 --> 00:00:53,362
[SPEAKER_17]: This city council has been working very hard with Attorney Bobowski for over 18 months on this zoning, they have met many, many times in committee of the whole on this.

8
00:00:54,103 --> 00:00:57,225
[SPEAKER_17]: Last month they finished their work, and they voted it out of committee.

9
00:00:57,865 --> 00:01:03,409
[SPEAKER_17]: Legally, the next step is that they must send it to the Community Development Board for a public hearing.

10
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:05,550
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what this is here tonight.

11
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:06,750
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what brings us here.

12
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:17,797
[SPEAKER_17]: So as Andre said that the Attorney Bobrowski will be presenting the proposed ordinance, and he'll present what it is that the City Council changed in this.

13
00:01:18,397 --> 00:01:23,580
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, we do have the ordinance, um, that we're reviewing online available.

14
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,641
[SPEAKER_17]: Amanda, can you drop that in the chat?

15
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:35,186
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and if there's, I should have had you tell me if there's an easy way for those who are watching along on TV, um, to get.

16
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:44,030
[SPEAKER_17]: To where that is, if people would like the copy of the revised documents, um, there was a press release earlier this week.

17
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,312
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that's still linked from the city's main webpage.

18
00:01:48,894 --> 00:01:51,416
[SPEAKER_17]: if you can check that while I finish the statement.

19
00:01:53,097 --> 00:02:09,906
[SPEAKER_17]: So it is our preference this evening to keep comments and the focus of this on the changes that have been made and recommended by the city council, that that is the scope at which we are looking at, although the entire ordinance is part of the legal scope of this evening.

20
00:02:11,787 --> 00:02:22,273
[SPEAKER_17]: We do realize that there are a lot of things that are outside the scope of what is being discussed this evening that people want to see change that maybe should be changed.

21
00:02:23,094 --> 00:02:32,800
[SPEAKER_17]: And we do expect to do that in a comprehensive process at the end of the comprehensive plan and our expectation is starting around next summer.

22
00:02:34,101 --> 00:02:34,521
[SPEAKER_17]: However,

23
00:02:35,074 --> 00:02:48,058
[SPEAKER_17]: We do have a staff person on the call tonight whose job it is to collect any comments and thoughts that are not relevant to the changes of the city council, but should be fed back to our comprehensive plan consultants.

24
00:02:48,558 --> 00:02:50,219
[SPEAKER_17]: So we will be capturing those.

25
00:02:50,719 --> 00:03:00,222
[SPEAKER_17]: However, if comments are truly in that vein and not about the changes under consideration this evening, you can email comments

26
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:07,938
[SPEAKER_17]: to compplan, C-O-M-P-P-L-A-N, at medford-ma.gov.

27
00:03:08,558 --> 00:03:15,325
[SPEAKER_17]: Additionally, we will continue to be having public meetings about the comprehensive plan and looking at changes, looking for changes.

28
00:03:16,126 --> 00:03:23,234
[SPEAKER_17]: We haven't scheduled the next public meeting, but we are anticipating that to be in February or thereabouts.

29
00:03:25,014 --> 00:03:33,316
[SPEAKER_17]: So this work by the city council can really act as a positive bridge for the larger city process that is going to occur with the comprehensive plan.

30
00:03:33,896 --> 00:03:42,298
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we're very excited to have this in a clean, organized manner to start our work next summer.

31
00:03:42,898 --> 00:03:46,479
[SPEAKER_17]: And in the meantime, there are many, many changes to get through this evening.

32
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:50,801
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I am going to turn this over to Attorney Bobrowski.

33
00:03:50,822 --> 00:03:55,905
[SPEAKER_17]: Attorney Bobrowski, thank you very much for joining us this evening.

34
00:03:56,065 --> 00:03:57,666
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we're going to give you the floor.

35
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:04,670
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, Amanda, can you was there any place that people who are watching on TV can easily follow along?

36
00:04:05,588 --> 00:04:05,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

37
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:10,392
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you wanted to for you mean the draft documents.

38
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:18,037
[SPEAKER_11]: If you wanted to access those you could go on to the city website page for the Medford Community Development Board.

39
00:04:18,518 --> 00:04:32,268
[SPEAKER_11]: And then if you scroll down, there's a heading that should say current filings, and in there there are folders for you know filings that are current with the board and at the very bottom, there is one for zoning recodification documents.

40
00:04:33,331 --> 00:04:34,572
[SPEAKER_11]: and they should all be there.

41
00:04:35,132 --> 00:04:41,774
[SPEAKER_17]: On the city's main webpage, the second news item is public hearing on new proposed zoning ordinance.

42
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:56,440
[SPEAKER_17]: And on that news item is the links to the summary of the amendments, the table of contents for the proposed ordinance, the draft proposed ordinance, the use table and the dimensional table.

43
00:05:01,132 --> 00:05:04,154
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, Attorney Bobrowski, the floor is yours.

44
00:05:05,075 --> 00:05:05,455
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

45
00:05:05,655 --> 00:05:06,816
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening to everybody.

46
00:05:07,837 --> 00:05:12,600
[SPEAKER_18]: I've had a wonderful time working with the city council so far and members of staff.

47
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,943
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm glad to see that this is broadening out a bit now to get some community involvement as well.

48
00:05:19,624 --> 00:05:25,368
[SPEAKER_18]: I've worked in more than a hundred cities and towns in Massachusetts doing this kind of job.

49
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:29,331
[SPEAKER_18]: Probably my biggest city was Lowell.

50
00:05:30,055 --> 00:05:48,700
[SPEAKER_18]: which I did back in the 90s, but some of your neighbors, Chelsea, Revere, Salem, Fitchburg, New Bedford have all been, Haverhill most recently have been cities I've worked with, but I've also worked in many small towns, medium-sized towns.

51
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,781
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm always picking up new tricks wherever I go.

52
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:56,262
[SPEAKER_18]: So hopefully some of those will make light in your,

53
00:05:57,304 --> 00:06:01,787
[SPEAKER_18]: Ordinance as we go through the process, I'll try to explain why it's in there.

54
00:06:02,608 --> 00:06:18,078
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the easiest way for me to do this will be to share screen and to put the ordinance up and scroll through it as Alicia said, section by section, stopping, asking questions, four questions from the board.

55
00:06:18,318 --> 00:06:23,802
[SPEAKER_18]: And then if the board is willing from the audience generally, then moving on to the next section.

56
00:06:25,128 --> 00:06:28,110
[SPEAKER_18]: So if that makes sense, can I share screen?

57
00:06:31,552 --> 00:06:33,853
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, you should.

58
00:06:36,114 --> 00:06:39,577
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is draft number nine, which is the current draft.

59
00:06:41,137 --> 00:06:49,382
[SPEAKER_18]: And what I'll first do is just give you an overview of the draft and then indicate to you what has changed.

60
00:06:49,422 --> 00:06:52,144
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a very short section, section one is always

61
00:06:53,603 --> 00:06:55,725
[SPEAKER_18]: I call it the handshake of the ordinance here.

62
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:59,167
[SPEAKER_18]: So the outline here is purpose, authority.

63
00:07:00,668 --> 00:07:13,857
[SPEAKER_18]: This is obviously something that cites the Enabling Act, which is Chapter 40A, but it also cites the Home Rule Amendment, which is Section 89 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth.

64
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:16,859
[SPEAKER_18]: And then it goes into a bit of detail on scope.

65
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,662
[SPEAKER_18]: It's basically saying that nobody can build anything

66
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,975
[SPEAKER_18]: or use land unless it's in compliance with this document.

67
00:07:24,775 --> 00:07:31,717
[SPEAKER_18]: Its applicability is one which is in contrast to other things.

68
00:07:34,638 --> 00:07:35,739
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to comply with zoning.

69
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,679
[SPEAKER_18]: You also have to comply with general ordinances.

70
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:41,321
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to comply with wetlands regulations or the health regulations.

71
00:07:41,381 --> 00:07:48,463
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is just something which pursues a goal under chapter 40A and amendments

72
00:07:49,263 --> 00:07:58,129
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of these amendment regulations you had already from 5.1, 1.5.1, 1.5.2, you have these in your existing regulations.

73
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:11,939
[SPEAKER_18]: And lastly, severability, so that if any part of a section of the ordinance is declared unconstitutional, the rest of the ordinance would be salvaged by principles of severability.

74
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,083
[SPEAKER_18]: When I look at this in the context of your existing ordinance,

75
00:08:18,572 --> 00:08:19,652
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if you can see that.

76
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:20,993
[SPEAKER_18]: I probably have to drop it.

77
00:08:21,113 --> 00:08:22,153
[SPEAKER_18]: Authority is new.

78
00:08:23,673 --> 00:08:24,494
[SPEAKER_18]: Scope is new.

79
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:29,015
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's it.

80
00:08:29,335 --> 00:08:30,435
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are the new pieces.

81
00:08:30,715 --> 00:08:32,956
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is pretty boilerplate.

82
00:08:33,356 --> 00:08:36,417
[SPEAKER_18]: I generally use the same thing from place to place.

83
00:08:37,037 --> 00:08:39,918
[SPEAKER_18]: It outlines the basics of the zoning power.

84
00:08:40,858 --> 00:08:43,879
[SPEAKER_18]: And there's not a lot of law there.

85
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:47,780
[SPEAKER_18]: For the most part, it is introductory in nature.

86
00:08:50,368 --> 00:08:52,248
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll pause there and ask if there are any questions.

87
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:57,930
[SPEAKER_17]: And just before the board jumps in a housekeeping item, I apologize.

88
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:07,712
[SPEAKER_17]: If anybody would like closed captions, you can click on the CC button that says live transcript at the bottom of your screen to get closed captions.

89
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:12,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thank you.

90
00:09:13,413 --> 00:09:14,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, attorney Bogrowski.

91
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:17,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Any questions or comments from members of the board about section one?

92
00:09:26,244 --> 00:09:29,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Hearing none, any questions or comments from members of the public?

93
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:47,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Just if you could explain section 1.5.2 about when do you have to get an engineer involved for a petition versus when can you just submit a petition?

94
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:52,069
[SPEAKER_10]: And could you just, for the record, state your name and address, please?

95
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:55,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, David McKenna to Vine Street in Medford.

96
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,701
[SPEAKER_18]: These are existing rules.

97
00:09:59,921 --> 00:10:03,544
[SPEAKER_18]: So whatever the past practice has been, nothing has changed here.

98
00:10:03,564 --> 00:10:08,048
[SPEAKER_18]: This form of petition is exactly as it's worded in the current ordinance.

99
00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:15,293
[SPEAKER_18]: So if somebody on staff has a hands-on experience with this, perhaps you would be the right person to answer.

100
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:27,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody from the city wanna tackle that one?

101
00:10:29,177 --> 00:10:29,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, there is no change.

102
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:30,198
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize.

103
00:10:30,218 --> 00:10:32,619
[SPEAKER_17]: We were doing a housekeeping thing in the background.

104
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,940
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't realize.

105
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,381
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't hear the question.

106
00:10:35,421 --> 00:10:36,181
[SPEAKER_17]: I apologize.

107
00:10:36,782 --> 00:10:47,348
[SPEAKER_18]: The gentleman asks, in 1.5.2, when an engineer in the sixth or seventh line would need to get involved when a petition is submitted?

108
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:57,194
[SPEAKER_17]: So a registered engineer on behalf of the applicants

109
00:10:59,538 --> 00:11:09,743
[SPEAKER_17]: All of our filings to the building department need to be stamped by a registered engineer, at least if they go as far as site plan review into zoning.

110
00:11:11,183 --> 00:11:12,624
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the answer's in the sentence.

111
00:11:12,684 --> 00:11:15,586
[SPEAKER_18]: If the amendment to the zoning map is subject of the petition.

112
00:11:16,346 --> 00:11:18,367
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, this is about changing the zoning.

113
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:20,168
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, changing the map.

114
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,868
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, if you're gonna change the map.

115
00:11:22,229 --> 00:11:23,929
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you need a picture at that point.

116
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:24,970
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, my apologies.

117
00:11:27,868 --> 00:11:29,669
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would be the threshold.

118
00:11:31,311 --> 00:11:34,513
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, just to emphasize, there's no proposed change to this section.

119
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:35,754
[SPEAKER_10]: This is existing language.

120
00:11:36,414 --> 00:11:51,165
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, and we've only in fact made one map change in the recodification, and that was a new office two district, quite small, to offer some opportunities that, as Alicia said, have arisen with time.

121
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:54,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thank you.

122
00:11:55,097 --> 00:11:56,057
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the easy stuff.

123
00:11:56,077 --> 00:11:58,158
[SPEAKER_10]: So why don't we move on to section number two?

124
00:11:58,638 --> 00:12:04,000
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, it gets pretty much easy here too, because as I just said, we've only created one new district.

125
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,660
[SPEAKER_18]: It would be here where my cursor is, office two.

126
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:10,482
[SPEAKER_18]: And the purpose of it would be office R&D.

127
00:12:11,282 --> 00:12:20,684
[SPEAKER_18]: And you'll see the use table and the dimensional table have both been amended to provide for various uses and dimensions in that district.

128
00:12:21,305 --> 00:12:22,705
[SPEAKER_18]: So the map will change.

129
00:12:23,317 --> 00:12:28,841
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're assuming that this provision on the zoning map will have a new iteration.

130
00:12:30,923 --> 00:12:36,567
[SPEAKER_18]: There's also overlay districts and special districts that are established in section nine.

131
00:12:37,648 --> 00:12:40,310
[SPEAKER_18]: The plan development district is a new district.

132
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,851
[SPEAKER_18]: The MUZ is an existing district.

133
00:12:44,072 --> 00:12:49,516
[SPEAKER_18]: And I believe that the boundaries of districts is part of the existing ordinance.

134
00:12:50,297 --> 00:12:53,079
[SPEAKER_18]: And it basically just tells you how to interpret

135
00:12:53,597 --> 00:13:00,504
[SPEAKER_18]: certain features of the map, like where the line separating districts is in the center line of the street.

136
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,768
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's this language here under boundaries of districts.

137
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:09,912
[SPEAKER_18]: And then split lots, I'm just gonna check with my earlier coded draft.

138
00:13:11,734 --> 00:13:15,938
[SPEAKER_18]: Split lots is... I believe that's new.

139
00:13:17,099 --> 00:13:17,940
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe that's new.

140
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:21,787
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, split lots is new.

141
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:30,352
[SPEAKER_18]: So this just says how to interpret zoning when the lot is divided by a district boundary as established by the ordinance.

142
00:13:30,472 --> 00:13:32,274
[SPEAKER_18]: And then that's 2.5.2.

143
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:40,199
[SPEAKER_18]: And the second 2.5.1 is when it's partially in and partially outside the city.

144
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:49,625
[SPEAKER_18]: And these are very boilerplate standard provisions that you would add for split lots.

145
00:13:51,484 --> 00:13:56,387
[SPEAKER_10]: So this, again, this section has not very many changes.

146
00:13:56,668 --> 00:14:08,596
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think the plan development district, which was the new special district might be worth some conversation, but why don't we tackle that when we get to section nine, which is where- Yeah, that will come up in section nine.

147
00:14:08,656 --> 00:14:14,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, so board members, any questions or comments about section two?

148
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,241
[SPEAKER_19]: Andre, this is David.

149
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, please, David.

150
00:14:19,228 --> 00:14:24,192
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to, I think for the benefit of those who are listening and interested.

151
00:14:24,913 --> 00:14:29,777
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to try to clarify the proposal would add additional.

152
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:38,065
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm trying to get the right word districts, the office to for instance would be a new district.

153
00:14:39,073 --> 00:14:51,829
[SPEAKER_19]: but the process of identifying where on the map that new district lies or any process of changing the boundaries of the districts would be separate from what we're engaged in currently.

154
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,112
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to, I think that's correct.

155
00:14:54,773 --> 00:14:57,136
[SPEAKER_19]: And I wanted to clarify that for folks, if that is true.

156
00:14:58,253 --> 00:15:08,935
[SPEAKER_17]: So the City Council would submit a map change, but they have not reviewed and submitted a map change to the planning, to the Community Development Board yet.

157
00:15:11,975 --> 00:15:13,156
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so I just wanted to clarify.

158
00:15:13,616 --> 00:15:21,217
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the public would, I imagine one of the issues people would be most interested in is, hey, are the boundaries changing here?

159
00:15:21,257 --> 00:15:24,837
[SPEAKER_19]: And to clarify, that's not what's in front of us.

160
00:15:25,438 --> 00:15:26,038
[SPEAKER_18]: No, you're right.

161
00:15:26,118 --> 00:15:27,738
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the only change that we've

162
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,321
[SPEAKER_18]: made here in the recodification.

163
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:36,584
[SPEAKER_18]: It's perhaps useful at this point to jump in and say that recodification is usually three things.

164
00:15:36,684 --> 00:15:44,767
[SPEAKER_18]: Number one, bring the ordinance into compliance with existing changes in state law and in case law.

165
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:56,112
[SPEAKER_18]: Number two, fix internal inconsistencies where the old ordinance said turn left and another provision said turn right, figure out which way to go and eliminate one of them.

166
00:15:56,701 --> 00:16:02,302
[SPEAKER_18]: And the third is add provisions that address glaring omissions.

167
00:16:02,442 --> 00:16:06,363
[SPEAKER_18]: For example, definitions needed to be addressed significantly.

168
00:16:06,923 --> 00:16:14,225
[SPEAKER_18]: And there are other places where there's a hybridization of one of those three things or two of those three things.

169
00:16:16,065 --> 00:16:17,146
[SPEAKER_18]: Go ahead.

170
00:16:17,266 --> 00:16:22,747
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't say with regarding the map changes, the city council has

171
00:16:23,736 --> 00:16:42,085
[SPEAKER_17]: has had some preliminary discussions during the committee, the whole of where the 02 district would be applied, but they have not reviewed a map change in city council meeting yet and reviewed it to the planning board.

172
00:16:42,886 --> 00:16:52,851
[SPEAKER_17]: That is definitely something that is open for discussion, but there are no other map changes even being contemplated during this recodification.

173
00:16:59,198 --> 00:16:59,918
[SPEAKER_19]: Andre, this is David.

174
00:16:59,938 --> 00:17:02,699
[SPEAKER_19]: That was just my question for clarification.

175
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:08,101
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate in particular Mark's explanation of what recodification entails.

176
00:17:08,142 --> 00:17:11,483
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's helpful for people to hear as well.

177
00:17:11,503 --> 00:17:14,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for pointing that out.

178
00:17:14,864 --> 00:17:16,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Any questions or comments from members of the public?

179
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:24,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, if you do unmute yourself, please state your name and address for the record.

180
00:17:32,143 --> 00:17:36,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, hearing none, let's Mark move on to section three.

181
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:39,529
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so section three is use regulations.

182
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:55,941
[SPEAKER_18]: And the primary feature here of this is a revamped use schedule, table of use regulations that I think is a lot simpler to use than at least the one I tried to use obtained online.

183
00:17:57,122 --> 00:18:00,965
[SPEAKER_18]: But as with map changes, we've tried to minimize

184
00:18:01,657 --> 00:18:15,927
[SPEAKER_18]: changes to the table of uses to those necessary for the reasons you do a recodification changes in state law, new things that we hadn't and couldn't have imagined in 1965, et cetera.

185
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:27,935
[SPEAKER_18]: So I've changed the abbreviations that are used to something that would make sense to a lay person, board of appeals, CDB, CC for the city council,

186
00:18:28,737 --> 00:18:31,459
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I have the use table, I'll bring that up next.

187
00:18:33,021 --> 00:18:40,947
[SPEAKER_18]: Before we get to the use table itself, just walk you through some of the provisions for accessory uses, which is section 3.3.

188
00:18:41,027 --> 00:18:47,973
[SPEAKER_18]: These are already in your existing ordinance.

189
00:18:48,553 --> 00:18:52,156
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I added some provisions on accessory uses in all districts.

190
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,364
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be accessory scientific uses.

191
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,646
[SPEAKER_18]: That's mentioned in Chapter 48, Section 9.

192
00:18:58,066 --> 00:19:07,231
[SPEAKER_18]: It's pretty obscure, but a scientist is allowed to, by special permit, work on scientific development or related production in the home.

193
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:10,373
[SPEAKER_18]: And second, family daycare homes.

194
00:19:10,493 --> 00:19:21,839
[SPEAKER_18]: The default position in the statute is that a family daycare home, there are two types, small and large, can be allowed by default if you do not address them.

195
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:27,794
[SPEAKER_18]: Small family daycare home is up to six children, including resident participants.

196
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:32,898
[SPEAKER_18]: Large family daycare is up to 10 children, including resident participants.

197
00:19:32,978 --> 00:19:34,159
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are defined terms.

198
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,103
[SPEAKER_18]: The definitions of those terms are in Chapter 15B, Section 1A.

199
00:19:39,764 --> 00:19:44,548
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, this is an opportunity many people in most communities have taken advantage of.

200
00:19:45,388 --> 00:19:48,491
[SPEAKER_18]: Anytime you have a need to drop off child, go to work,

201
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:54,279
[SPEAKER_18]: Your choices basically are family daycare homes or family first family daycare homes.

202
00:19:54,780 --> 00:20:03,875
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the next step up from this would be a child care center, which is in many cases a national chain accessory uses in the industrial districts.

203
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:05,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me, Mark.

204
00:20:05,858 --> 00:20:06,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry for interrupting.

205
00:20:07,478 --> 00:20:19,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Just before you go on, could you just maybe explain to the members of the public what the term accessory uses is, because that's the whole section, and how it relates to the use, like the map and the use table?

206
00:20:20,023 --> 00:20:20,283
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

207
00:20:21,503 --> 00:20:26,245
[SPEAKER_18]: There is a section of the use table that addresses accessory uses, but let's back up one step.

208
00:20:26,505 --> 00:20:33,848
[SPEAKER_18]: An accessory use is a use which is customarily associated with and subordinate to

209
00:20:34,703 --> 00:20:35,524
[SPEAKER_18]: the principal use.

210
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,946
[SPEAKER_18]: So typically it would be something like a garage.

211
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,187
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be an accessory structure likely.

212
00:20:41,848 --> 00:20:43,569
[SPEAKER_18]: Family daycare is a very good example.

213
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:44,650
[SPEAKER_18]: It's done out of the home.

214
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,813
[SPEAKER_18]: It is always something licensed by the state in a home setting.

215
00:20:50,474 --> 00:20:53,336
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's not the principal use of the property.

216
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:55,157
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a secondary use, if you will.

217
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:59,460
[SPEAKER_18]: And it meets the definition of an accessory provision.

218
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,882
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a definition in the back in section 12 for accessory.

219
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:09,708
[SPEAKER_18]: Generally accessory uses have to be on the same lot as the principal use, and they have to be incidental and subordinate.

220
00:21:10,189 --> 00:21:12,791
[SPEAKER_18]: So in other words, they can't overwhelm the principal use.

221
00:21:13,451 --> 00:21:19,836
[SPEAKER_18]: A typical court case would be, you know, once they become the primary or dominant use, they're no longer accessible.

222
00:21:20,997 --> 00:21:31,586
[SPEAKER_18]: Many people have struck it rich doing internet manufacturing, delivery of product, the whole house becomes literally a cross between

223
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:34,548
[SPEAKER_18]: production plant and a distribution facility.

224
00:21:34,608 --> 00:21:36,869
[SPEAKER_18]: There's actually a case from Hadley that I'm thinking of.

225
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:42,512
[SPEAKER_18]: And when it just gets overwhelmed like that, the courts properly say, that's not accessory anymore.

226
00:21:42,532 --> 00:21:46,555
[SPEAKER_18]: Go find a building in the commercial district to do your work.

227
00:21:49,716 --> 00:21:52,958
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, a lot of accessory uses, including home occupations.

228
00:21:54,219 --> 00:21:58,401
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the last statistic I saw was that 65% of Americans work out of the home.

229
00:21:59,878 --> 00:22:01,039
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're coming up on that.

230
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:04,641
[SPEAKER_18]: Residential accessory uses include boarders.

231
00:22:06,402 --> 00:22:09,844
[SPEAKER_18]: And we had a long discussion about this.

232
00:22:10,484 --> 00:22:18,229
[SPEAKER_18]: Boarding is not more than two unrelated persons in a dwelling occupied by the owner.

233
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:24,893
[SPEAKER_18]: Prohibitive accessory uses would be unregistered motor vehicles, more than one.

234
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:33,021
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the following uses are prohibited, accessory uses are prohibited in the residential districts.

235
00:22:33,601 --> 00:22:43,269
[SPEAKER_18]: Auto repair or service, outdoor storage, display of materials or goods, and overnight parking of any commercial vehicle with a gross vehicle weight of more than 15,000 pounds.

236
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:53,937
[SPEAKER_18]: That's 15,000, GVW is about the size of a large van, the ubiquitous vans that you now see roaming the street.

237
00:22:56,907 --> 00:22:59,628
[SPEAKER_18]: And then there's a new rewrite of the home occupation provision.

238
00:22:59,688 --> 00:23:02,329
[SPEAKER_18]: It divides home occupations into two categories.

239
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:05,610
[SPEAKER_18]: One is as of right, and the other is by special permit.

240
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:20,075
[SPEAKER_18]: So the as of right home occupation is one which is not accompanied by any employees, and it doesn't include any customer or client trips to the location.

241
00:23:20,575 --> 00:23:23,796
[SPEAKER_18]: There can be employees, but they have to be resident employees.

242
00:23:24,597 --> 00:23:25,717
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the key distinction.

243
00:23:26,522 --> 00:23:36,888
[SPEAKER_18]: home occupation by special permit is also conducted within the dwelling, but it can have no more than two persons employed who do not reside on the premises.

244
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:51,295
[SPEAKER_18]: And the thinking here is that a special permit would be required because it's a little more traffic in a neighborhood and parking, and there would need to be a special permit proceeding in order to make sure that the neighbors are protected.

245
00:23:54,330 --> 00:24:02,575
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I'll stop there and then I can jump to the use table or we can reserve the use table till the end of the discussion entirely.

246
00:24:02,615 --> 00:24:06,077
[SPEAKER_18]: But I suppose it's six and one half dozen of another.

247
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:09,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thank you, Mark.

248
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,540
[SPEAKER_10]: You bet.

249
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:17,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Board members and Mark, just so you know, I think it's easier for me to call on people and facilitate a conversation when I stop your sharing.

250
00:24:17,825 --> 00:24:20,526
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe when you do your presentation, you can share again.

251
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:22,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, no problem at all.

252
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:23,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thank you.

253
00:24:25,287 --> 00:24:27,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Board members, any questions or comments?

254
00:24:27,828 --> 00:24:39,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, seeing none.

255
00:24:39,571 --> 00:24:42,212
[SPEAKER_10]: And Mark, I basically have a, oh, go ahead, David.

256
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:54,535
[SPEAKER_19]: To sort of redirect Mark a little bit, having watched many of the council meetings on this topic and senior presentations,

257
00:24:55,202 --> 00:25:01,303
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the things that stuck with me, Mark, is in particular with daycare situation where

258
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:13,285
[SPEAKER_19]: By law these things can can occur, really in any district if I obviously correct me if I'm wrong, but that because are but that's the default position in the statute.

259
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:17,827
[SPEAKER_19]: And because our ordinance didn't speak to some of these topics.

260
00:25:18,587 --> 00:25:29,353
[SPEAKER_19]: We were left without as much sort of controller we weren't putting parameters on the uses so if you could just touch on that because I think it was a very interesting point you made on many of the meetings.

261
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,381
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I always like to illustrate it by playing the curmudgeon.

262
00:25:33,642 --> 00:25:44,306
[SPEAKER_18]: So I can easily understand and live next door to without any problems a family daycare facility, which has up to six children, including resident participants.

263
00:25:44,386 --> 00:25:45,767
[SPEAKER_18]: I love children, I've got three.

264
00:25:47,368 --> 00:25:56,372
[SPEAKER_18]: 10 begins to make me think that perhaps I would want a little bit more mitigation proposed in order to make it a smoother transition for the neighborhood.

265
00:25:56,891 --> 00:26:02,734
[SPEAKER_18]: And so that's why my default position is small by right, large by special permit.

266
00:26:03,135 --> 00:26:05,716
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that's what special permits are for.

267
00:26:05,736 --> 00:26:14,981
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not a use so great that you want to just lend it a carte blanche, but it's not a use so bad that you want to prohibit it.

268
00:26:15,001 --> 00:26:16,042
[SPEAKER_18]: You want to hear more about it.

269
00:26:16,082 --> 00:26:17,263
[SPEAKER_18]: You want to be able to shape it.

270
00:26:17,603 --> 00:26:18,604
[SPEAKER_18]: You want to see if it fits.

271
00:26:18,924 --> 00:26:20,164
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what special permits do.

272
00:26:21,265 --> 00:26:22,806
[SPEAKER_18]: And just because you have a special permit

273
00:26:23,368 --> 00:26:31,914
[SPEAKER_18]: requirement and a hearing requirement doesn't mean the answer's no, it just means we'd like to think about it.

274
00:26:32,054 --> 00:26:43,482
[SPEAKER_18]: The oddity here though, make no mistake about it, is that childcare centers, which I represent a national chain of childcare centers, and their business model is 185 kids.

275
00:26:43,822 --> 00:26:49,085
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's by right, because it's Dover protected under chapter 48, section three.

276
00:26:49,225 --> 00:26:51,467
[SPEAKER_18]: Childcare centers, schools,

277
00:26:52,487 --> 00:27:02,153
[SPEAKER_18]: as I don't need to tell Medford with the Tufts College case being the lead case and religious institutions are the protected Dover amendment uses.

278
00:27:06,476 --> 00:27:07,836
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Deanna, I had a question.

279
00:27:07,936 --> 00:27:14,420
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the current ordinance, do we not have anything related to family childcare?

280
00:27:16,842 --> 00:27:21,024
[SPEAKER_18]: There might be an old, I'm not in my office, so I didn't bring the old ordinance with me,

281
00:27:22,413 --> 00:27:26,596
[SPEAKER_18]: There might be something that refers archaically to nursery school or something like that.

282
00:27:28,136 --> 00:27:28,937
[SPEAKER_18]: I see that a lot.

283
00:27:29,197 --> 00:27:36,762
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, this stuff wasn't invented until 19, I believe that the childcare center material came into the statute around 1989.

284
00:27:37,142 --> 00:27:45,547
[SPEAKER_18]: And the preamble to the legislation was due to the serious shortage of childcare in the Commonwealth, here's what we're going to do.

285
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,612
[SPEAKER_10]: questions or comments.

286
00:27:52,632 --> 00:27:52,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Board members.

287
00:27:52,972 --> 00:27:54,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions or comments.

288
00:27:58,155 --> 00:28:00,136
[SPEAKER_17]: There are not comments from the board members.

289
00:28:00,236 --> 00:28:02,377
[SPEAKER_17]: There is one thing that I feel like.

290
00:28:03,298 --> 00:28:04,438
[SPEAKER_17]: In doing our due diligence.

291
00:28:04,498 --> 00:28:05,479
[SPEAKER_17]: I should just raise.

292
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:13,623
[SPEAKER_17]: We should be aware of there's there was a lot of discussion at the City Council level about, uh, people living in

293
00:28:22,545 --> 00:28:26,486
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the section of borders in a dwelling and the renting of rooms.

294
00:28:26,946 --> 00:28:29,107
[SPEAKER_17]: We had three unrelated persons.

295
00:28:29,267 --> 00:28:31,508
[SPEAKER_17]: It was changed to two unrelated persons.

296
00:28:32,068 --> 00:28:43,712
[SPEAKER_17]: But it is an interplay with what's also allowed around the definition of a family, which occurs much later in the ordinances, and then plays in the lodging houses as well.

297
00:28:45,796 --> 00:28:51,398
[SPEAKER_17]: Attorney Bobrowski, do you think it would make sense, perhaps a better verse to sort of explain that?

298
00:28:51,458 --> 00:29:05,541
[SPEAKER_17]: It's this interplay between definition of a family, which obviously is at the end of our entire discussion, but is critical to this idea of borders and why the city council changed the number from three to two here.

299
00:29:06,982 --> 00:29:11,603
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so I'm just jumping ahead in my unshared

300
00:29:12,182 --> 00:29:29,974
[SPEAKER_18]: version here, family is one or more persons related by blood adoption or marriage living and cooking together as a single nonprofit housekeeping unit, provided that a group of five or more persons who are not related by blood adoption or marriage shall not be deemed to constitute a family.

301
00:29:30,675 --> 00:29:34,677
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a takeoff on a very famous U.S.

302
00:29:34,737 --> 00:29:38,660
[SPEAKER_18]: Supreme Court case called Belter versus Boris.

303
00:29:39,261 --> 00:29:40,121
[SPEAKER_18]: It actually occurred in the 1970s.

304
00:29:41,924 --> 00:29:57,658
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was a situation in which the town of Belter, think SUNY Stony Brook, it was the college nearby, passed a regulation that no more than two unrelated persons could live together and constitute a family.

305
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:07,287
[SPEAKER_18]: And there was no limit placed on my large Polish-American family, as long as we were related by blood, marriage, or adoption.

306
00:30:08,597 --> 00:30:13,800
[SPEAKER_18]: And so the landlord sued because he wanted more renters, and the renter sued because they wanted more people to share the rent.

307
00:30:14,321 --> 00:30:22,525
[SPEAKER_18]: Went all the way to the US Supreme Court, and in a very famous case written by Justice Douglas, he ruled that it was perfectly legal to do that.

308
00:30:22,865 --> 00:30:34,932
[SPEAKER_18]: So I've worked in many of our college towns, from Amherst to Bridgewater, which I'm doing right now, to Salem, to Fitchburg,

309
00:30:35,631 --> 00:30:45,917
[SPEAKER_18]: and all of them have had their own spin on how many unrelated people can live together, usually with an eye in a college town towards the number of students that can share a house.

310
00:30:46,317 --> 00:30:47,378
[SPEAKER_18]: Here the answer's four.

311
00:30:47,818 --> 00:30:49,699
[SPEAKER_18]: In Amherst, it's three, it's not four.

312
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:54,222
[SPEAKER_18]: And so that's just a political choice that was made.

313
00:30:55,043 --> 00:31:03,888
[SPEAKER_18]: If you have no definition, for example, the town of Tewksbury, if you were to look at their zoning bylaw, it just says any number of people living together as a single household.

314
00:31:04,424 --> 00:31:07,386
[SPEAKER_18]: So it could be unlimited people, unrelated to each other.

315
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:13,530
[SPEAKER_18]: And then when you start adding borders on top of that, you can see how it defeats the purpose of having a limit in the first place.

316
00:31:14,191 --> 00:31:21,095
[SPEAKER_18]: So if I can only have four unrelated persons living together and they can have two borders who are not on the lease, a border is not on the lease.

317
00:31:21,956 --> 00:31:25,458
[SPEAKER_18]: So four of them can be on the lease and two more can come in as borders.

318
00:31:25,498 --> 00:31:28,660
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's, we had this discussion about where does this begin and end?

319
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:32,563
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I believe Paul Mulkey, your building commissioner pointed out to us that five,

320
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:34,012
[SPEAKER_18]: would be a boarding house.

321
00:31:34,052 --> 00:31:35,573
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's how we eliminated that now.

322
00:31:39,935 --> 00:31:40,156
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

323
00:31:40,176 --> 00:31:54,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's definitely, definitely something that I personally would like to get into when we get to the family definition, because I think, you know, blood marriage and adoption are not the only ways that family units are constituted nowadays.

324
00:31:54,283 --> 00:31:59,145
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would be certainly interested in exploring broadening that.

325
00:31:59,852 --> 00:32:08,154
[SPEAKER_18]: The year after the Belter case, or two years after, there was another case decided by the US Supreme Court called Moore versus City of East Cleveland.

326
00:32:08,655 --> 00:32:15,537
[SPEAKER_18]: And in that case, they had actually ruled that a certain degree of kinship was a requirement of being family.

327
00:32:15,557 --> 00:32:27,340
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was obscure in terms of the degree of kinship, but the Supreme Court went the other direction and said, if they're related, you cannot bother that associational right

328
00:32:27,736 --> 00:32:28,977
[SPEAKER_18]: and that right of privacy.

329
00:32:29,037 --> 00:32:36,080
[SPEAKER_18]: So the boundary is some degree of, I think any degree of kinship is the way I read the East Cleveland case.

330
00:32:37,861 --> 00:32:44,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, Medford's a very LGBTQ friendly community and I'm part of that community.

331
00:32:44,524 --> 00:32:50,887
[SPEAKER_10]: And by that definition, my partner and I, long-term partner and I would not constitute a family.

332
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:53,968
[SPEAKER_10]: So personally, I'm very interested in that.

333
00:32:53,988 --> 00:32:55,709
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think on behalf of many others too.

334
00:32:56,393 --> 00:33:09,304
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, I actually understand it to say your partner and you could have two other people unrelated by blood living in your house and the four of you could declare yourself a family and that would be legal in the city of Medford.

335
00:33:10,064 --> 00:33:11,626
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that correct, Attorney Bobrowsky?

336
00:33:12,066 --> 00:33:15,649
[SPEAKER_18]: Up to four unrelated individuals constitute a family.

337
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:23,075
[SPEAKER_18]: So if it's a single family house, it can have four unrelated people living together, sharing

338
00:33:23,538 --> 00:33:28,361
[SPEAKER_18]: the common amenities of a single family dwelling, cooking facilities, that kind of thing.

339
00:33:29,121 --> 00:33:32,703
[SPEAKER_17]: If they had adopted children, that's not a problem.

340
00:33:32,723 --> 00:33:39,567
[SPEAKER_17]: You could have eight adopted children or foster children.

341
00:33:41,288 --> 00:33:43,810
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just going to say, I see some comments from members of the public.

342
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:45,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Roberta Cameron.

343
00:33:51,663 --> 00:34:06,872
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, so I'm a little bit confused as to what would happen in a situation where some of the members of the household are related by that definition and some additional members of the household are unrelated by that definition.

344
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:20,380
[SPEAKER_12]: How many, you know, if you have four related people and two unrelated people, are you, have you exceeded the limit of people who can live in a household together

345
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:22,980
[SPEAKER_12]: under that definition?

346
00:34:24,841 --> 00:34:25,722
[SPEAKER_18]: Good question.

347
00:34:27,503 --> 00:34:29,384
[SPEAKER_18]: So four people were related.

348
00:34:30,425 --> 00:34:33,587
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't see that as triggering anything in the definition of family.

349
00:34:33,647 --> 00:34:40,032
[SPEAKER_18]: You could have eight people or 12 people or 15 people who were related and it would still be a single family home.

350
00:34:41,293 --> 00:34:50,039
[SPEAKER_18]: Adding the two unrelated people, I think would simply be a matter of, I think it would require a degree of interpretation.

351
00:34:51,595 --> 00:34:53,256
[SPEAKER_18]: from the building commissioner's office.

352
00:34:54,598 --> 00:34:59,962
[SPEAKER_18]: The intent here clearly is not to have 15 family members and two unrelated people.

353
00:35:02,805 --> 00:35:10,311
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just speaking for the group who was in discussion about this, and I don't think I'm wrong in assessing it that way.

354
00:35:13,774 --> 00:35:18,318
[SPEAKER_10]: And Roberta, can you just for the record, could you just state again your name and address for the record?

355
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:23,091
[SPEAKER_12]: Roberta Cameron, 12 North Street.

356
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:34,036
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just have to register that I'm not satisfied with that response because it's a very real situation and it's a very non-answer to the real situation.

357
00:35:34,176 --> 00:35:41,980
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm not really sure where that leaves a household that has a mix of related and unrelated people.

358
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,322
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a good question, duly noted.

359
00:35:48,603 --> 00:35:50,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Jackie, and then we'll go to Barry, go ahead.

360
00:35:51,580 --> 00:36:01,267
[SPEAKER_15]: So, um, I am heavily familiar with the, the, um, the, the law case, the legal cases that surrounds around planning and housing and zoning and so forth.

361
00:36:01,573 --> 00:36:20,947
[SPEAKER_15]: haven't just received my AICP, but one of the things that I'm a little concerned with using Beltier versus Flores, and I would never argue this with a jurist doctor at this point, but I'm just a little confused as to why we're referring to a 1974 ruling as opposed to progressively looking at how families are defined going forward.

362
00:36:20,987 --> 00:36:24,229
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it just to protect Medford's ordinance?

363
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,312
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it just to have a proper ordinance in place?

364
00:36:28,073 --> 00:36:32,758
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this something that can be hashed out pretty much with the public so that it fits Medford?

365
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:40,426
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just trying to wrap my head around why we're going back to a 1974 court case ruin and how that played out.

366
00:36:41,687 --> 00:36:48,614
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, the answer to the second part of your question is yes, you can shape an answer here that fits Medford.

367
00:36:49,075 --> 00:36:51,217
[SPEAKER_18]: Like I said, Tewksbury, and I've

368
00:36:51,624 --> 00:37:00,972
[SPEAKER_18]: recodified them years ago, and they haven't changed this, says any number of people living together as a single housekeeping unit constitute a family for purposes of their bylaw.

369
00:37:01,713 --> 00:37:03,914
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's an answer that suits them.

370
00:37:03,934 --> 00:37:13,542
[SPEAKER_18]: I think maybe this is an issue in Medford historically because of your college student population, and maybe that's not the right answer anymore.

371
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:16,485
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is definitely something that can be reviewed.

372
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,820
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for that.

373
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:33,843
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to bring it up for the public to explain how very much important it is to have the public's voice in this and to help shape the audiences going forward, especially as it relates to Mefford and not so much ancient history.

374
00:37:35,304 --> 00:37:37,884
[SPEAKER_18]: Long Island ancient history.

375
00:37:37,924 --> 00:37:38,744
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much.

376
00:37:40,345 --> 00:37:42,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Barry, and again, name and address.

377
00:37:43,505 --> 00:37:45,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Barry Ingber, 9 Draper Street.

378
00:37:48,172 --> 00:38:04,139
[SPEAKER_05]: At one point attorney Bobrovsky made a statement about defeating the purpose of having limits on the number of people in a unit of housing or in a single family dwelling in the first place.

379
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:14,364
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess I don't actually understand the reason to have any limits other than health and safety reasons.

380
00:38:14,444 --> 00:38:17,105
[SPEAKER_05]: If they aren't health and safety reasons,

381
00:38:18,207 --> 00:38:26,729
[SPEAKER_05]: business does the city have in restricting living arrangements of private individuals?

382
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:46,754
[SPEAKER_18]: The only practical justification that I can offer you, having worked in all of the, most of the flag bearers of the state's higher educational system, is that there has always been, and it may not be important or necessary today,

383
00:38:47,299 --> 00:38:55,046
[SPEAKER_18]: But it still remains important in Bridgewater, Fitchburg, Salem, Lowell.

384
00:38:55,126 --> 00:38:58,128
[SPEAKER_18]: These are all flagships of the state institution.

385
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:01,811
[SPEAKER_18]: And this has always been part of the discussion there.

386
00:39:01,911 --> 00:39:09,558
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think the historical remnant is that students were difficult to police in some areas.

387
00:39:09,798 --> 00:39:14,462
[SPEAKER_18]: And this was a way of trying to get a municipal hand around the problem.

388
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:31,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I guess I would just want to state for the record that we as a polity do not have any business intervening in people's living arrangements in that way.

389
00:39:32,568 --> 00:39:38,210
[SPEAKER_05]: And that it is not only students who choose to live in larger groups.

390
00:39:40,851 --> 00:39:45,772
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's becoming an increasing issue with the elevated price of housing and the need for

391
00:39:46,615 --> 00:39:52,057
[SPEAKER_10]: for young families to kind of share expenses and childcare, et cetera.

392
00:39:52,597 --> 00:39:58,980
[SPEAKER_05]: And seniors as well, I would point out seniors as well could be making that choice.

393
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Generational arrangements as well.

394
00:40:01,141 --> 00:40:08,484
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm having a time warp experience because immediately after these Supreme Court cases were decided in the 70s, a friend of mine, Edith Netter,

395
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:17,923
[SPEAKER_18]: who I believe was teaching at MIT at the time, wrote an article about the impact of these court cases on alternative family models.

396
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:21,504
[SPEAKER_18]: And so you can probably still find it.

397
00:40:23,144 --> 00:40:24,725
[SPEAKER_18]: It was in a national publication.

398
00:40:26,385 --> 00:40:29,486
[SPEAKER_18]: And she critiqued it in much the same way you're doing now.

399
00:40:29,506 --> 00:40:33,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mark.

400
00:40:33,908 --> 00:40:34,628
[SPEAKER_10]: William Snyder.

401
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:37,749
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

402
00:40:38,627 --> 00:40:43,270
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to bring up our own situation and ask a question.

403
00:40:44,131 --> 00:40:50,535
[SPEAKER_20]: My wife and I have a single family house and we have a lodger in two of our rooms.

404
00:40:51,276 --> 00:40:54,518
[SPEAKER_20]: And so it looks like that is no longer gonna be allowed.

405
00:40:55,419 --> 00:41:03,845
[SPEAKER_20]: And my personal solution is gonna be that area of our house is gonna now be an ADU, I guess.

406
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:06,567
[SPEAKER_20]: But I wondered if that was the intent,

407
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:17,744
[SPEAKER_20]: I see in the use table that there used to be lodgers allowed in single family one, two, and general residential, but now it's only starting at apartment one.

408
00:41:19,165 --> 00:41:21,405
[SPEAKER_20]: And so I want to get a comment on that.

409
00:41:21,525 --> 00:41:23,106
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that the right interpretation?

410
00:41:23,646 --> 00:41:33,050
[SPEAKER_20]: And then just a little bit of a response to the other discussion, which is across the street earlier in the decade, in last decade,

411
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:43,721
[SPEAKER_20]: We had a single family house whose absentee owner was renting out to seven unrelated people with seven cars that were parking all over the lot.

412
00:41:44,082 --> 00:41:49,706
[SPEAKER_20]: And that was done mostly for financial reasons.

413
00:41:50,186 --> 00:41:55,150
[SPEAKER_20]: And it was an impact to the neighborhood because it impacted the character of the neighborhood.

414
00:41:57,211 --> 00:42:01,134
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't mind a family of seven, but having seven unrelated students, each with their own car,

415
00:42:02,115 --> 00:42:05,217
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, it was not allowed and it was stopped, um, by the.

416
00:42:05,817 --> 00:42:14,382
[SPEAKER_20]: Ordinance and this in the building department at the time, but I'm more interested in just hearing that there was a motivation to remove the lodger provision.

417
00:42:14,722 --> 00:42:18,484
[SPEAKER_20]: And I assume that part that's partly replaced by the ADU.

418
00:42:18,544 --> 00:42:18,985
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that right?

419
00:42:21,466 --> 00:42:22,446
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's fair.

420
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:26,969
[SPEAKER_18]: We we've had a lot of discussion about this.

421
00:42:27,049 --> 00:42:28,310
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm, I'm glancing at K.

422
00:42:29,292 --> 00:42:38,416
[SPEAKER_18]: six in the use table, which is renting of one or two rooms without separate cooking facilities to lodgers within a dwelling unit, to one or two total lodgers.

423
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:46,920
[SPEAKER_18]: So you're right, that has now moved to apartment one, apartment two, apartment three, and C1.

424
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,361
[SPEAKER_18]: Those would be the districts in which it's located.

425
00:42:51,362 --> 00:42:56,745
[SPEAKER_18]: And the ROS, SF1, 2, and GR are no's.

426
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,101
[SPEAKER_18]: So I guess that's a political question.

427
00:43:00,121 --> 00:43:11,368
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, obviously this is a public hearing, if that's something that... Yeah, it's more to the city council, I guess, but I just, I mean, I'm happy.

428
00:43:11,448 --> 00:43:24,216
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm very happy with the ordinance and I really thank you for making these revisions and the ADU is gonna work out well for me, but I just thought that was kind of a significant change to make all that no longer allowed.

429
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:30,475
[SPEAKER_11]: William Snyder, could you provide your address for the record?

430
00:43:30,595 --> 00:43:31,055
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, sorry.

431
00:43:31,115 --> 00:43:33,776
[SPEAKER_20]: William Snyder at 87 Warren Street, Medford.

432
00:43:34,416 --> 00:43:34,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

433
00:43:37,917 --> 00:43:38,577
[SPEAKER_10]: William Navar.

434
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:41,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi there.

435
00:43:42,138 --> 00:43:46,239
[SPEAKER_07]: William Navar, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

436
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a few things to say, but first I wanted to ask a question because I'm rather confused.

437
00:43:53,601 --> 00:43:55,662
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it's technically at the table, but

438
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:03,235
[SPEAKER_07]: There seems to be lodging as an accessory use, and then there's an idea of a lodging house.

439
00:44:04,196 --> 00:44:15,981
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't really understand how those intersect, because to me, if you have the usual occupancy of four, and then you have up to two lodgers, that equals six.

440
00:44:16,041 --> 00:44:18,142
[SPEAKER_07]: The lodging house is where there's five.

441
00:44:18,162 --> 00:44:21,923
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess I'm confused on why we have both, how those interact.

442
00:44:23,324 --> 00:44:24,344
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little confusing to me.

443
00:44:24,844 --> 00:44:26,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Accessories versus primary.

444
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,023
[SPEAKER_18]: A lodging house is a principal use in and of itself.

445
00:44:31,263 --> 00:44:34,886
[SPEAKER_18]: The business of the place is lodgers or boarders.

446
00:44:36,327 --> 00:44:37,408
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a boarding house.

447
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,791
[SPEAKER_18]: So there isn't any other family there supervising boarders.

448
00:44:43,974 --> 00:44:51,880
[SPEAKER_18]: It's got a lock and key on each room and people live there generally for a shorter period of time.

449
00:44:52,641 --> 00:44:55,323
[SPEAKER_18]: Boarders in a single family home are accessories.

450
00:44:55,872 --> 00:45:06,537
[SPEAKER_18]: The purpose of the single family home is that it's the family's home, but if you rented one or two rooms to a lodger, then they would be accessory borders.

451
00:45:06,657 --> 00:45:09,919
[SPEAKER_18]: And there's a provision that we looked at back in the text that covers that.

452
00:45:10,819 --> 00:45:24,286
[SPEAKER_18]: And all of this relates to the family because in the case of the accessory use, it's added on to the number of people that meet the definition of family, at least as it's in the draft ordinance now.

453
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:48,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so if five tough students who are trying to deal with our housing crisis, because of our lack of housing, rent an apartment together and sign on the lease as five individuals, they're not a family, but maybe they're a lodging house, is that right?

454
00:45:48,982 --> 00:45:50,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they're all lodging together?

455
00:45:51,161 --> 00:46:05,473
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I think if I were the students and I wanted to make a legal argument, I would say four of us are on the lease and we're entitled to do that because we are a four unrelated persons and we constitute a family as defined by the word family.

456
00:46:06,033 --> 00:46:07,834
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the fifth person is a border.

457
00:46:07,975 --> 00:46:08,815
[SPEAKER_18]: They're not on the lease.

458
00:46:09,416 --> 00:46:10,096
[SPEAKER_07]: And OK.

459
00:46:10,577 --> 00:46:10,777
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

460
00:46:11,557 --> 00:46:12,018
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

461
00:46:12,058 --> 00:46:19,544
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that I think that raises certain questions about if that's OK, because obviously I think that border is going to be

462
00:46:20,183 --> 00:46:25,125
[SPEAKER_07]: likely at a more precarious position legally if something goes wrong with tenants' rights or something.

463
00:46:26,966 --> 00:46:28,307
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a concern I have.

464
00:46:30,868 --> 00:46:38,472
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a little concerned about limiting people's options to be able to live in the housing we do have during our housing shortage.

465
00:46:39,032 --> 00:46:45,055
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's a political decision, but I hope the Community Development Board will think about that.

466
00:46:45,115 --> 00:46:48,237
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad to hear some of them are looking at this carefully.

467
00:46:49,154 --> 00:46:56,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if we don't have enough housing, limiting how intensely we use the housing we do have is not ideal.

468
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:06,769
[SPEAKER_07]: We need options for people who are, even less than ideal options for people who are on the margin of homelessness or having to quit school or quit their job and live someplace else.

469
00:47:07,609 --> 00:47:08,810
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's really important.

470
00:47:10,832 --> 00:47:16,917
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that a lot of the, I heard another commenter say that parking was the issue.

471
00:47:18,604 --> 00:47:38,545
[SPEAKER_07]: I really hope that the Community Development Board and our zoning process in general can eventually address that, because I think that we're doing too much to ensure that everybody can find a parking space, to the detriment of people's ability to find a place to live, that people are having to commute very long distances or give up city life altogether or something for that reason.

472
00:47:38,765 --> 00:47:41,808
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hope that we can address that at some point, the idea that our zoning

473
00:47:42,257 --> 00:47:46,719
[SPEAKER_07]: got to make it very easy to find a parking space, makes it very difficult to find a place to live, I think.

474
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:51,662
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hope that the Community Development Board and their zoning process looks into these issues.

475
00:47:53,803 --> 00:47:54,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, William.

476
00:47:55,504 --> 00:47:58,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Next up is Eileen has her hand raised.

477
00:47:59,987 --> 00:48:01,628
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Eileen Lerner.

478
00:48:01,728 --> 00:48:04,989
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 9 Adams Circle in Medford.

479
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:08,251
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to agree with Barry.

480
00:48:11,001 --> 00:48:19,968
[SPEAKER_00]: And William, I just, this is a huge and complex issue and it affects many people in different ways.

481
00:48:21,089 --> 00:48:28,754
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that the city has no right to inquire into people's living arrangements, I really do.

482
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:38,282
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand Mr. Schneider's distress over the situation he described with a lot of students living together.

483
00:48:39,274 --> 00:48:44,084
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we should be about policing behavior.

484
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:54,494
[SPEAKER_00]: If those students are living there quietly and respectfully and taking care of the property and even being part of the community, who cares?

485
00:48:54,974 --> 00:49:01,737
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they're behaving badly and disturbing everybody, then that's a problem that needs to be addressed.

486
00:49:01,877 --> 00:49:03,678
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the police need to be called.

487
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:06,819
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, maybe people need mediation services.

488
00:49:07,399 --> 00:49:13,062
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but I don't think that the way to address a behavior problem is to

489
00:49:13,722 --> 00:49:16,324
[SPEAKER_00]: get a blanket solution for everybody.

490
00:49:17,065 --> 00:49:27,393
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this piece of the proposed ordinance is discriminatory against people that don't have much money, against seniors.

491
00:49:29,394 --> 00:49:35,098
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, against the LGBT community.

492
00:49:35,279 --> 00:49:36,680
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it is 2000, almost 22.

493
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:36,880
[SPEAKER_00]: And

494
00:49:42,339 --> 00:49:43,560
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going back.

495
00:49:45,081 --> 00:49:46,882
[SPEAKER_00]: We can only go forward.

496
00:49:47,843 --> 00:49:50,544
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we need housing.

497
00:49:51,125 --> 00:49:55,087
[SPEAKER_00]: Women like me who never have been paid what we're worth.

498
00:49:55,888 --> 00:49:59,030
[SPEAKER_00]: So you end up with a little bit

499
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:12,114
[SPEAKER_00]: even less social security than a lot of other people, maybe because you worked in social services, you know, and now you have to pay a lot of money in property taxes.

500
00:50:12,734 --> 00:50:17,036
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're going to come along and tell you how many people you can live with.

501
00:50:17,276 --> 00:50:20,017
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it is just unbearable.

502
00:50:21,277 --> 00:50:23,918
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I just am very against it.

503
00:50:24,118 --> 00:50:30,600
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we ought to leave the concept of deciding whose family and who isn't.

504
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:34,721
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the one drop rule, you know, about being black, really.

505
00:50:35,542 --> 00:50:45,665
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think your family, even if you live together and you share expenses and you're concerned about each other, you're family for that period of time that you're living together.

506
00:50:46,165 --> 00:50:49,326
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I guess that's all I have to say.

507
00:50:51,036 --> 00:50:51,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Eileen.

508
00:50:51,818 --> 00:50:56,610
[SPEAKER_10]: And Paige Lieberman.

509
00:50:58,901 --> 00:51:00,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, how's everybody doing?

510
00:51:00,122 --> 00:51:01,723
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really good to hear everybody speaking.

511
00:51:01,743 --> 00:51:04,284
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of rare, you know, we have a zoning meeting.

512
00:51:04,324 --> 00:51:10,969
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people are speaking up on behalf of those, you know, some of the many marginalized people in our society.

513
00:51:11,409 --> 00:51:16,752
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm also speaking because I- Sorry for interrupting, but could you just say, name and address for the record?

514
00:51:16,772 --> 00:51:19,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Matthew Page Lieberman, I live in 15 Canal Street, apartment 15.

515
00:51:19,214 --> 00:51:20,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here in public housing.

516
00:51:21,055 --> 00:51:24,157
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is not a single family building and I cannot,

517
00:51:24,657 --> 00:51:25,618
[SPEAKER_03]: have anybody else.

518
00:51:25,678 --> 00:51:27,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot allow people to live in my unit.

519
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:35,446
[SPEAKER_03]: But as for those who can, I think there are a lot of questions that we haven't really gotten any clarity or answers upon this yet.

520
00:51:35,526 --> 00:51:36,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

521
00:51:36,807 --> 00:51:44,032
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see any impending problem about masses of people trying to live in houses and like avalanches of people falling out windows.

522
00:51:44,232 --> 00:51:44,833
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand.

523
00:51:45,554 --> 00:51:48,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there some kind of threat that we see on the horizon?

524
00:51:48,756 --> 00:51:51,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't heard any justification for why this limit

525
00:51:51,558 --> 00:51:52,439
[SPEAKER_03]: is being imposed.

526
00:51:52,779 --> 00:52:02,967
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, Mr. Bobrowsky, I thank you for all your service in helping us with this, but I still, I'm not getting some clarity when questions are asked, well, what if there are two people that are family and there are three other people?

527
00:52:03,348 --> 00:52:16,038
[SPEAKER_03]: If we say, well, I'm not sure that ought to be the decision of somebody down the line, that creates all kinds of situations where you have some kind of bureaucrat kind of arbitrarily trying to make these calls and who should be able to live with whom.

528
00:52:17,038 --> 00:52:22,203
[SPEAKER_03]: And this question of, well, quite possibly it was because of the students once upon a time.

529
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:23,325
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about right now.

530
00:52:23,565 --> 00:52:31,673
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the justification for limiting people's ability to have the kinds of living arrangements with other people that they would like to have?

531
00:52:31,733 --> 00:52:37,018
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when we're going to start restricting anybody, we should be incredibly clear why we're doing that.

532
00:52:37,378 --> 00:52:39,020
[SPEAKER_03]: And I haven't been able to hear that yet.

533
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,862
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the justification for creating this

534
00:52:41,242 --> 00:52:43,904
[SPEAKER_03]: three new zones, no, this may not be able to exist.

535
00:52:44,344 --> 00:52:46,746
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm very, very glad that we're able to speak on this.

536
00:52:47,166 --> 00:52:49,408
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope that this can, we're not going to pass.

537
00:52:49,448 --> 00:52:50,969
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to allow this one through.

538
00:52:51,549 --> 00:53:01,135
[SPEAKER_03]: And even if there's something on that, perhaps somewhere down the line, we can even address this and make sure that really stupid attempts like this do not get through any other zoning propositions.

539
00:53:01,195 --> 00:53:01,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

540
00:53:02,977 --> 00:53:03,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Matthew.

541
00:53:04,258 --> 00:53:06,099
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll go to David McKenna next.

542
00:53:10,374 --> 00:53:27,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, I'll be brief I just for the my comment to the council members who are present and the board members is I think that there should be lodgers allowed in single family housing I have a lodger and if this is codified, you know, that will be illegal.

543
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:36,122
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's part of the solution to you know a lot of seniors in the town are complaining about their property taxes.

544
00:53:36,871 --> 00:53:39,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, they have a giant house with one person living in it.

545
00:53:40,214 --> 00:53:42,435
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you want to pay your property taxes, get a lodger.

546
00:53:42,856 --> 00:53:46,078
[SPEAKER_09]: But if the city makes that illegal, now we've created a whole nother problem.

547
00:53:46,198 --> 00:53:51,763
[SPEAKER_09]: So I really think we need lodgers in the single family, multifamily, you know, section.

548
00:53:52,343 --> 00:53:54,285
[SPEAKER_09]: So please put that back in.

549
00:53:55,225 --> 00:54:01,090
[SPEAKER_09]: And I agree with everything that was said about the family members, you know, let it be five or six or seven.

550
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:04,513
[SPEAKER_09]: If that creates a parking problem, then let's regulate the parking.

551
00:54:05,373 --> 00:54:10,620
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, let's charge more for parking passes, let's limit the number of parking passes per residence.

552
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:16,708
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm fine with that, but to, you know, I think William put it beautifully.

553
00:54:17,829 --> 00:54:23,316
[SPEAKER_09]: If we prioritize giving people a place to park such that it makes it hard to find a place to live,

554
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,681
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, where our priorities are all out of balance.

555
00:54:26,822 --> 00:54:28,082
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be my comment.

556
00:54:28,202 --> 00:54:34,907
[SPEAKER_09]: I really appreciate the lawyer for helping us to understand all of this so that we can direct our grievances in the appropriate direction.

557
00:54:35,747 --> 00:54:36,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

558
00:54:36,768 --> 00:54:37,348
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, David.

559
00:54:37,388 --> 00:54:39,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you say your address for the record?

560
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:44,092
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a two vine street in Medford, David McKenna.

561
00:54:45,133 --> 00:54:45,453
Thank you.

562
00:54:46,594 --> 00:54:49,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Next up, Alex lesson hop again, name and address for the record.

563
00:54:52,258 --> 00:54:55,220
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, Alex, 30 Wright Avenue in Medford.

564
00:54:55,240 --> 00:55:01,964
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to address something that hasn't come up yet, which is the addition of the restriction on family daycare homes.

565
00:55:03,645 --> 00:55:14,851
[SPEAKER_16]: I struggle to see why it's necessary to add a restriction there for meeting a special permit for a family daycare that wanted to have 11 or 12 children.

566
00:55:15,272 --> 00:55:17,333
[SPEAKER_16]: As someone who recently had to find childcare,

567
00:55:18,235 --> 00:55:23,997
[SPEAKER_16]: for my two-year-old, it's extremely, extremely challenging to find childcare anywhere in this region.

568
00:55:24,657 --> 00:55:39,103
[SPEAKER_16]: It's so competitive that you have to get on wait lists years in advance, and it suggests to me that the supply is just extremely, extremely low, and we shouldn't be putting up more roadblocks to this sort of thing.

569
00:55:39,123 --> 00:55:44,745
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, daycare workers and family daycare providers are not people who are

570
00:55:45,445 --> 00:55:53,607
[SPEAKER_16]: generally, you know, very wealthy who can sit through months and months of special permitting processes and take a lot of time out of their days.

571
00:55:53,667 --> 00:55:54,987
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not a highly paid profession.

572
00:55:55,007 --> 00:56:04,029
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just am concerned with putting up additional roadblocks to something, especially if we, if we've been having issues and problems with it, that's one thing.

573
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:11,031
[SPEAKER_16]: But if it's just sort of an imagined concern, then I would urge us not to regulate it unless there's a real problem.

574
00:56:11,191 --> 00:56:14,492
[SPEAKER_16]: So that would be something I just addressed there for the record.

575
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:15,460
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

576
00:56:16,421 --> 00:56:17,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Alex.

577
00:56:18,983 --> 00:56:24,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Mark, I don't know if you want to respond to that at all in terms of the context of the discussion so far.

578
00:56:24,488 --> 00:56:28,991
[SPEAKER_18]: It's totally a political choice.

579
00:56:30,633 --> 00:56:32,714
[SPEAKER_18]: There's three acceptable positions.

580
00:56:32,794 --> 00:56:39,900
[SPEAKER_18]: You can let the statute work by default, in which case both large and small are allowed by right.

581
00:56:40,861 --> 00:56:44,304
[SPEAKER_18]: Or you can choose to bifurcate the process

582
00:56:44,794 --> 00:56:52,438
[SPEAKER_18]: as I suggested is my default position, small by right, large by special permit, or you can put them both on special permit.

583
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:55,139
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's any one of those answers is correct.

584
00:56:55,719 --> 00:56:58,040
[SPEAKER_18]: And the only difference between them is political.

585
00:56:59,421 --> 00:57:01,102
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I just ask a follow-up question, actually?

586
00:57:01,882 --> 00:57:04,924
[SPEAKER_16]: Large and small, is that discretionary?

587
00:57:05,124 --> 00:57:08,485
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, can we define large and small, or is that defined?

588
00:57:08,565 --> 00:57:09,466
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it's a state.

589
00:57:09,786 --> 00:57:11,347
[SPEAKER_18]: If you look at General Laws Chapter 15b,

590
00:57:12,635 --> 00:57:19,399
[SPEAKER_18]: Section 1A, it defines family daycare, what is it called?

591
00:57:19,439 --> 00:57:22,560
[SPEAKER_18]: Family childcare and large is also defined.

592
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:30,404
[SPEAKER_18]: And those are the definitions in the statute, up to six, including resident participants and up to 10, including resident participants.

593
00:57:31,445 --> 00:57:31,925
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you.

594
00:57:33,026 --> 00:57:34,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

595
00:57:34,466 --> 00:57:35,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Behrs.

596
00:57:37,603 --> 00:57:37,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

597
00:57:38,023 --> 00:57:43,265
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, of course, the minute I joined the meeting and started watching, I said I wasn't going to say anything, but here I am.

598
00:57:44,945 --> 00:57:57,968
[SPEAKER_08]: And no, what I'm about to say, basically, we had a long and in-depth conversation around the issue of lodging houses, lodgers, and the family slash relatedness piece of things.

599
00:58:00,189 --> 00:58:03,470
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm just prefacing by saying that it was a long and in-depth conversation.

600
00:58:04,777 --> 00:58:17,907
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought where we landed was that we wouldn't make conditions for the accessory use more restrictive, but we did want to make sure that we weren't having lodging houses in those districts.

601
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:22,191
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I'm just putting that out there that I agree with a lot of the comments that have been made.

602
00:58:23,271 --> 00:58:25,813
[SPEAKER_08]: And I put this in the chat as well.

603
00:58:26,354 --> 00:58:30,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Look forward to the recommendations of the Community Development Board, but I definitely agree with everyone here that

604
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:38,576
[SPEAKER_08]: I did not think we were making things more restrictive than the existing ordinance, and I don't think it would be smart of us to do that.

605
00:58:41,046 --> 00:58:43,107
[SPEAKER_08]: at this point through this recodification.

606
00:58:43,747 --> 00:58:49,929
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also agree with the idea that we shouldn't be defining family, that our definition of family should be as open as possible.

607
00:58:50,209 --> 00:58:51,449
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to put that out there.

608
00:58:51,669 --> 00:58:54,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you all for your work and for reviewing this document.

609
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:57,911
[SPEAKER_08]: It's complicated and we put a lot of time into it.

610
00:58:57,971 --> 00:59:03,653
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think there are some things that still need to be ironed out, but I look forward to what you all have to say about that.

611
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:04,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

612
00:59:05,705 --> 00:59:06,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, councilor.

613
00:59:06,506 --> 00:59:08,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I liked the way that you put it in your chat.

614
00:59:08,147 --> 00:59:11,169
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to read it because I thought it was very elegantly said.

615
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:18,776
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with comments about not restricting the number of people in a dwelling unit based on relatedness and moving to a system based on health and safety instead.

616
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:27,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Next person with the hand raised, Katie.

617
00:59:32,508 --> 00:59:34,889
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, name and address for the record.

618
00:59:34,969 --> 00:59:37,951
[SPEAKER_14]: Katie Cornog, 44 Powerhouse Road Extension.

619
00:59:40,132 --> 00:59:48,417
[SPEAKER_14]: I am concerned about daycare use and about large numbers of unrelated people living in single-family home districts.

620
00:59:49,787 --> 00:59:54,331
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think either is beneficial to the community or to the neighborhood.

621
00:59:55,953 --> 00:59:59,156
[SPEAKER_14]: Frankly, I would like to see the restriction on daycare to be free.

622
01:00:00,076 --> 01:00:04,580
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't want to have borders or unrelated people living in my neighborhood.

623
01:00:05,121 --> 01:00:13,608
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm just voicing, I guess what is a minority opinion here, but I just want to say there is another side to the issue, which is,

624
01:00:14,489 --> 01:00:21,634
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, in our neighborhood, it's all single family, but there's one house that has a bunch of unrelated students living in it.

625
01:00:22,154 --> 01:00:25,936
[SPEAKER_14]: And they have many, many cars that take up a lot of parking.

626
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:30,219
[SPEAKER_14]: They are not involved in the neighborhood at all.

627
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,080
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't even know who they are.

628
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,062
[SPEAKER_14]: They never introduce themselves.

629
01:00:34,102 --> 01:00:35,082
[SPEAKER_14]: They never say hello.

630
01:00:35,543 --> 01:00:38,104
[SPEAKER_14]: They're very unrelated to the neighborhood.

631
01:00:38,124 --> 01:00:38,184
[SPEAKER_14]: And

632
01:00:40,013 --> 01:00:46,038
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, you know, as far as daycare goes, I don't want a whole bunch of cars coming in and dropping off kids every day.

633
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:49,681
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I want the neighborhood to be for the neighbors.

634
01:00:49,861 --> 01:00:58,208
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to see these unrelated people living or coming in on a daily basis to a single family neighborhood.

635
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:01,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Katie.

636
01:01:03,532 --> 01:01:06,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Next person, Barry, going back to you.

637
01:01:09,195 --> 01:01:10,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Barry Ingber, 9 Draper Street.

638
01:01:11,317 --> 01:01:13,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have to do that every time you speak?

639
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:15,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

640
01:01:16,141 --> 01:01:18,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

641
01:01:19,784 --> 01:01:22,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for giving me another chance to talk.

642
01:01:23,887 --> 01:01:34,096
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to state that I don't think that the negative attitudes towards people living in groups goes back to students.

643
01:01:34,976 --> 01:01:38,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it goes back further than that to immigrants.

644
01:01:39,768 --> 01:01:54,139
[SPEAKER_05]: and that immigrants have used living together, and still do, as a way of gaining access to housing when they're first getting started in a community, especially in cities.

645
01:01:55,260 --> 01:02:00,084
[SPEAKER_05]: And in light of this, and in light of our histories of

646
01:02:02,654 --> 01:02:17,680
[SPEAKER_05]: of racial covenants and redlining that we need to be really careful when we use the concept of neighborhood character and what it is that we're actually saying.

647
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:22,901
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I think that we do most of this stuff subconsciously.

648
01:02:22,921 --> 01:02:29,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not accusing anybody of being evil or being deliberately prejudiced.

649
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:38,882
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do think that we should be interrogating ourselves when we make statements like that.

650
01:02:40,183 --> 01:02:42,844
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it that we actually mean?

651
01:02:44,325 --> 01:02:50,968
[SPEAKER_05]: And what is the end result of those cultural practices?

652
01:02:51,709 --> 01:02:57,452
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I'll stop there and I'll keep my mouth shut for the rest of the meeting.

653
01:02:57,892 --> 01:02:59,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for letting me speak.

654
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:01,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Barry.

655
01:03:02,548 --> 01:03:02,948
[SPEAKER_10]: William.

656
01:03:02,968 --> 01:03:09,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi there, William Navar, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

657
01:03:09,312 --> 01:03:18,257
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm mostly commenting on this now because it seems appropriate, and I don't know when it'll come up again and if I'll be on the call when that happens, because this meeting is going to be long, I suspect.

658
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:26,702
[SPEAKER_07]: But Barry mentioned the term neighborhood character, and I feel very similar to the way he does about it.

659
01:03:27,773 --> 01:03:51,934
[SPEAKER_07]: and I wanted to just point out as a follow-up that it appears several places in our zoning code that phrase neighborhood character and so I think we should ask ourselves what it means and if we like that meaning and so on if it represents our values and I hope just as the Community Development Board continues through this process if they can hopefully know that Barry and now myself have

660
01:03:52,474 --> 01:03:57,176
[SPEAKER_07]: pointed this out, it could cause your ears to perk up and revisit that question.

661
01:03:57,636 --> 01:03:57,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

662
01:03:59,517 --> 01:04:00,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, William.

663
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:15,424
[SPEAKER_10]: So seeing no other hands raised, I think we can, and just so everybody knows, I think that, you know, we'll probably need some time to

664
01:04:17,757 --> 01:04:29,241
[SPEAKER_10]: kind of reflect on the feedback that we're getting to have some time to put it into actual recommendations for the city council.

665
01:04:29,301 --> 01:04:40,645
[SPEAKER_10]: So, where I'm coming at this now is that let's try to get through as many of the sections as possible here, as much of community's feedback, and then come back on December 9th

666
01:04:41,361 --> 01:04:50,153
[SPEAKER_10]: to with some, you know, concrete ideas about how to, you know, what changes we actually want to recommend.

667
01:04:50,173 --> 01:04:50,213
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

668
01:04:52,383 --> 01:04:56,127
[SPEAKER_10]: So Mark, why don't we move on to the next section?

669
01:04:56,147 --> 01:04:57,628
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a quick question.

670
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:06,336
[SPEAKER_11]: So I had some written comments that were submitted to our office ahead of this, and two of them were more general.

671
01:05:07,037 --> 01:05:14,104
[SPEAKER_11]: And one kind of had very specific, detailed recommendations that went by section.

672
01:05:14,384 --> 01:05:16,786
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I was considering offering to read those

673
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:20,493
[SPEAKER_11]: recommendations as we address the sections.

674
01:05:21,594 --> 01:05:23,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that sound all right with folks?

675
01:05:23,176 --> 01:05:27,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Because several of the comments reflect on section three.

676
01:05:28,402 --> 01:05:29,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that'd be great, Amanda.

677
01:05:29,724 --> 01:05:33,668
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to just do the general ones and the ones on section three right now, that'd be great.

678
01:05:34,489 --> 01:05:34,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

679
01:05:36,712 --> 01:05:37,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Too many tabs open.

680
01:05:39,867 --> 01:05:46,392
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so the first more general comment is from Nino Susi, 8 Grandview Avenue, Medford.

681
01:05:48,033 --> 01:05:54,378
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to comment on the lots split by zoning districts change and how it may affect a historic district.

682
01:05:54,538 --> 01:06:01,644
[SPEAKER_11]: There is only one instance that I know of, but there could be more, especially considering that a new historic district is being planned for Forest Street.

683
01:06:02,304 --> 01:06:24,729
[SPEAKER_11]: If a portion of a split law is in a local historic district, I do have concerns as to how this proposed new rule could potentially impact historic districts in the future by allowing commercial influence in the form of structures or parking lots and would ask that perhaps specific verbiage could be included in the new ordinance to better protect our historic assets.

684
01:06:26,089 --> 01:06:31,990
[SPEAKER_10]: And then- Well, can we just, Attorney Bobrowski, do you have a response to that at all?

685
01:06:32,922 --> 01:06:37,084
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I think that's in keeping with my understanding as well.

686
01:06:41,787 --> 01:06:53,993
[SPEAKER_11]: A set of, so some of the more specific recommendations for section three come from William Snyder, who I have his address, where is it?

687
01:06:54,493 --> 01:06:56,815
[SPEAKER_10]: William's actually here, he was one of the speakers.

688
01:06:56,915 --> 01:06:58,095
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the speakers from earlier.

689
01:06:58,115 --> 01:07:00,356
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm on line two, it's 87 Warren Street.

690
01:07:00,897 --> 01:07:01,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, William.

691
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:07,298
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so first recommendation was for section 3.3.6.

692
01:07:08,879 --> 01:07:21,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, under two resident districts be, um, outdoor storage and display of materials or goods change to be outdoor storage or display of materials or goods.

693
01:07:22,506 --> 01:07:26,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Otherwise one could store materials but not display them and be compliant.

694
01:07:27,509 --> 01:07:29,350
[SPEAKER_11]: And then 3.4 home occupations

695
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:34,502
[SPEAKER_11]: The use home occupation is not defined.

696
01:07:34,823 --> 01:07:44,605
[SPEAKER_11]: I realize this is referring to working at home or to businesses operated out of a residential property, but occupation also means occupancy or merely inhabiting a home.

697
01:07:45,185 --> 01:07:47,045
[SPEAKER_11]: So I thought that could be made clearer.

698
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:51,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Recommend put a brief definition of home occupation in definitions.

699
01:07:54,687 --> 01:07:54,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

700
01:07:54,967 --> 01:07:55,767
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good William.

701
01:07:55,827 --> 01:07:57,207
[SPEAKER_10]: I had thought about that as well.

702
01:07:57,247 --> 01:07:58,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for pointing that out.

703
01:07:59,448 --> 01:07:59,748
[SPEAKER_11]: You're welcome.

704
01:08:02,137 --> 01:08:06,138
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I have one last general recommendation.

705
01:08:06,198 --> 01:08:25,362
[SPEAKER_11]: This is actually from a board member, Christy Dowd, who was unable to attend tonight, but she states here, I'm not able to attend Thursday's CD meeting, but I would like to express my support of this proposal first as a Medford resident and then as a member of the CD board.

706
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:31,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Bernie Bobrovsky, over to you.

707
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:32,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Section four.

708
01:08:32,551 --> 01:08:42,114
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so with your permission, I would actually think that just to get it done and put it in the rear view mirror, we might put the use table up.

709
01:08:44,135 --> 01:08:46,936
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, I picked the wrong file here.

710
01:08:47,997 --> 01:08:49,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy to do that.

711
01:08:51,398 --> 01:08:53,178
[SPEAKER_18]: So what am I looking for here?

712
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:55,539
[SPEAKER_18]: Conventional table, use table.

713
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:59,681
[SPEAKER_18]: And the use table is, I think,

714
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:05,583
[SPEAKER_18]: vast improvement, at least format-wise, over the old use table.

715
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:18,011
[SPEAKER_18]: I've tried to regroup things into logical clusters here and to walk through this, keeping residential uses together.

716
01:09:18,811 --> 01:09:29,338
[SPEAKER_18]: You'll see that missing from the old residential uses are references to assisted living facilities, the senior housing facility, a new item

717
01:09:29,988 --> 01:09:32,971
[SPEAKER_18]: includes assisted living, but it also includes independent living.

718
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:37,314
[SPEAKER_18]: And it would also include congregate care.

719
01:09:38,916 --> 01:09:45,821
[SPEAKER_18]: Some things like multiple dwelling class A, class B, there was a distinction in the old use table based on height.

720
01:09:46,302 --> 01:09:51,146
[SPEAKER_18]: So the definition now has the height and it makes the use table easier to read.

721
01:09:51,166 --> 01:09:53,908
[SPEAKER_18]: Pushing forward here,

722
01:10:00,596 --> 01:10:28,305
[SPEAKER_18]: community uses are generally the ones that most people would think of as exempt so Museum community center Are just local flavors three four and five are the so-called Dover amendment uses These are called Dover amendment because back in the late 1940s the town of Dover banned churches from all residential districts and

723
01:10:31,745 --> 01:10:35,629
[SPEAKER_18]: The Supreme Judicial Court, I'm sorry, the legislature stepped in and said, you can't do that.

724
01:10:35,929 --> 01:10:39,633
[SPEAKER_18]: And they passed the earliest version of the so-called Dover Amendment.

725
01:10:39,993 --> 01:10:44,758
[SPEAKER_18]: It was broadened later to include number four, educational purposes.

726
01:10:45,318 --> 01:10:49,142
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was broadened again in 1989, as I said, to include childcare centers.

727
01:10:49,242 --> 01:10:51,845
[SPEAKER_18]: These three uses enjoy the same protection.

728
01:10:51,905 --> 01:10:54,167
[SPEAKER_18]: They cannot be prohibited or put on special permit.

729
01:10:55,598 --> 01:11:00,221
[SPEAKER_18]: reasonable regulations can be applied to them with regard to certain dimensional requirements.

730
01:11:00,301 --> 01:11:04,083
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the degree to which they can be regulated.

731
01:11:04,143 --> 01:11:08,265
[SPEAKER_18]: These are municipal uses and you're free to treat municipal uses as you see fit.

732
01:11:08,986 --> 01:11:14,089
[SPEAKER_18]: If you want to give municipal uses an exemption or a partial exemption, that's within your power to do so.

733
01:11:15,189 --> 01:11:19,312
[SPEAKER_18]: Municipal uses do not get an exemption unless you specifically grant it.

734
01:11:19,512 --> 01:11:22,533
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's why six, seven and eight are there.

735
01:11:23,794 --> 01:11:24,835
[SPEAKER_18]: Essential services is,

736
01:11:25,892 --> 01:11:30,855
[SPEAKER_18]: more or less the public service corporation exemption set forth in chapter 48, section three.

737
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:34,977
[SPEAKER_18]: These things are usually regulated by DPU or DTI.

738
01:11:36,478 --> 01:11:39,360
[SPEAKER_18]: The rule of thumb here is that you can put them on special permit.

739
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:45,783
[SPEAKER_18]: If you push too hard, they have the power to go to DTU and ask for an exemption from local zoning.

740
01:11:46,343 --> 01:11:54,248
[SPEAKER_18]: And the DTU really doesn't have to wait for you to push too hard, but they like to observe

741
01:11:55,768 --> 01:11:57,189
[SPEAKER_18]: and respect local customs.

742
01:11:57,389 --> 01:12:00,191
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's a board of appeals thing across the board.

743
01:12:00,591 --> 01:12:03,912
[SPEAKER_18]: Understand that if you push too hard, they can go to the state agency.

744
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:11,296
[SPEAKER_18]: And then hospital nonprofit and other institution are from your existing regulations today.

745
01:12:11,716 --> 01:12:23,182
[SPEAKER_10]: And Mark, before you move on, could you just explain for the members of the public who are not used to looking at a zoning table, what these letters mean and the columns up at the top?

746
01:12:23,693 --> 01:12:28,995
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, well, these are your districts at the top, and those are the abbreviations for the districts that are established in town.

747
01:12:29,476 --> 01:12:33,277
[SPEAKER_18]: The only exceptions are the last two columns.

748
01:12:33,577 --> 01:12:34,878
[SPEAKER_18]: PC is parking code.

749
01:12:35,278 --> 01:12:38,520
[SPEAKER_18]: There's an explanation for that in the section on parking.

750
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,500
[SPEAKER_18]: And LC is loading code.

751
01:12:41,101 --> 01:12:53,066
[SPEAKER_18]: And so with one glance, you can see that a museum is allowed in the APT1 district by right, and that it has a parking code of E and a loading code of A. So that's

752
01:12:53,480 --> 01:13:01,784
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're somebody trying to start a business in town, you could easily glance the deeper we go into this, the more business oriented it becomes.

753
01:13:01,824 --> 01:13:03,225
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me use that as an example.

754
01:13:05,066 --> 01:13:11,409
[SPEAKER_10]: I just also want to point out, people probably understand the Y and N mean yes and no, but the CC stands for city council.

755
01:13:11,909 --> 01:13:14,711
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

756
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:19,793
[SPEAKER_18]: BA stands for board of appeals and CDB stands for community development board.

757
01:13:21,324 --> 01:13:26,548
[SPEAKER_18]: That abbreviation indicates that they are the special permit granting authority for that use.

758
01:13:27,048 --> 01:13:30,831
[SPEAKER_18]: Special permit granting authorities are not equivalent to forum shopping.

759
01:13:30,951 --> 01:13:36,456
[SPEAKER_18]: Only the designated special permit granting authority, and those would be the three, have jurisdiction.

760
01:13:36,496 --> 01:13:37,937
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's not up for grabs.

761
01:13:38,057 --> 01:13:48,445
[SPEAKER_18]: The bylaws telling you that if you want a special permit for the keeping and raising of livestock in the industrial district, you have to go to the city council right there.

762
01:13:50,487 --> 01:13:54,508
[SPEAKER_18]: And you could not go to the planning board, for example.

763
01:13:54,548 --> 01:14:00,730
[SPEAKER_18]: Commercial uses, we start to see this operate a little bit more in terms of business, entrepreneurial spirit.

764
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:07,772
[SPEAKER_18]: So again, if I'm looking to come to town and start a trade professional or other school operated for profit, that's number four.

765
01:14:08,152 --> 01:14:15,814
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not the same as a nonprofit public or higher education school.

766
01:14:17,234 --> 01:14:17,914
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, what's that?

767
01:14:20,686 --> 01:14:27,188
[SPEAKER_18]: you would know immediately that the districts that you can do it on, do it in would be the C1, C2 districts.

768
01:14:27,828 --> 01:14:33,010
[SPEAKER_18]: You can do it in three districts by special permit from the city council and the fourth district, the MUZ as of right.

769
01:14:33,990 --> 01:14:38,792
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's the way that the letters are interpreted or are intended to be read.

770
01:14:40,072 --> 01:14:43,053
[SPEAKER_18]: Adult use is a broad category, but this is nothing new.

771
01:14:43,933 --> 01:14:49,175
[SPEAKER_18]: And there's different kinds of uses that could be conducted under the adult use banner.

772
01:14:49,895 --> 01:14:51,456
[SPEAKER_18]: brewery or tap room is new.

773
01:14:51,996 --> 01:14:59,619
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember adding that as the ordinance amended, was amended by the council.

774
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:03,261
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's some office uses that are grouped together.

775
01:15:03,281 --> 01:15:06,022
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sorry, Mark, for interrupting again.

776
01:15:06,102 --> 01:15:15,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Just again, one question that the community folks might have is where does the, you know, it's been a lot of talk about cannabis businesses.

777
01:15:15,066 --> 01:15:16,347
[SPEAKER_10]: How does that fit into the zoning?

778
01:15:16,367 --> 01:15:17,988
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm trying to remember.

779
01:15:26,636 --> 01:15:28,417
[SPEAKER_18]: When I bump into it, I'll call it out.

780
01:15:29,217 --> 01:15:31,217
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want to go too far ahead looking for things.

781
01:15:32,077 --> 01:15:39,859
[SPEAKER_18]: So retail and service uses, we did devise two additional, your old ordinance just said retail grant, go for it.

782
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:45,761
[SPEAKER_18]: But there was a big difference between 180,000 square foot Walmart and a neighborhood convenience store.

783
01:15:46,381 --> 01:15:48,362
[SPEAKER_18]: So we've divided this into three categories.

784
01:15:48,402 --> 01:15:49,522
[SPEAKER_18]: These are defined terms.

785
01:15:49,662 --> 01:15:51,042
[SPEAKER_18]: Retail sales are allowed.

786
01:15:51,382 --> 01:15:53,643
[SPEAKER_18]: Convenience retail is mid-range.

787
01:15:54,150 --> 01:16:02,655
[SPEAKER_18]: and neighborhood retail would be smaller scale because it would be targeting an area the size of a neighborhood.

788
01:16:03,676 --> 01:16:13,741
[SPEAKER_18]: Consumer service establishment obviously is something that is more focused on service uses rather than retail uses.

789
01:16:14,022 --> 01:16:21,246
[SPEAKER_18]: Paranormal service and sales was in your existing ordinance and trying to get...

790
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:26,443
[SPEAKER_10]: And the city's director of economic development, Victor Schrader has his hand raised.

791
01:16:26,463 --> 01:16:27,884
[SPEAKER_10]: So let me let him jump in.

792
01:16:27,904 --> 01:16:28,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

793
01:16:30,846 --> 01:16:31,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, chair.

794
01:16:32,327 --> 01:16:48,039
[SPEAKER_04]: On the marijuana uses, there's a section in the ordinance related to marijuana uses and the zoning for each license category is included in that section, but it's not reflected in the use table.

795
01:16:49,882 --> 01:16:58,770
[SPEAKER_18]: So those would be in section seven or eight, I can't recall, but there's a section on medical and a section on recreational, if I remember correctly.

796
01:17:00,772 --> 01:17:08,179
[SPEAKER_10]: And does that, Director Schrader, does that need to go into the use table at some point or how is that being handled?

797
01:17:09,182 --> 01:17:11,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, I don't know technically if it does.

798
01:17:12,164 --> 01:17:28,912
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty clear in that that section of the ordinance that retail marijuana establishments are limited to industrial and C2 districts, all other marijuana establishments types are, are open in terms of

799
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:31,573
[SPEAKER_04]: application.

800
01:17:31,593 --> 01:17:38,706
[SPEAKER_04]: They are governed by the host community agreement through the city, state licensing, and ZBA process.

801
01:17:39,247 --> 01:17:42,053
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're kind of unique in how they're regulated.

802
01:17:49,212 --> 01:18:05,058
[SPEAKER_17]: Would it be awkward because they're not as of right, and they're not something you would apply to the building commissioner and then apply to the ZBA for if they were rejected, so they would need their own code?

803
01:18:05,078 --> 01:18:17,302
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be worth considering doing that though, because I think it would make it helpful to have all uses reflected in the table.

804
01:18:20,042 --> 01:18:20,722
[SPEAKER_18]: Duly noted.

805
01:18:24,545 --> 01:18:35,391
[SPEAKER_18]: We've grouped motor vehicle related uses together and miscellaneous commercial uses.

806
01:18:35,451 --> 01:18:39,433
[SPEAKER_18]: Most of these are as they were within the existing ordinance.

807
01:18:39,493 --> 01:18:45,016
[SPEAKER_18]: We did up parking area or garage accessory to a principal use, which is within 500 feet.

808
01:18:45,056 --> 01:18:49,139
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe that the old one was 300 feet, but people are more accustomed now to 500 feet.

809
01:18:51,746 --> 01:19:03,229
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to point out that solar energy systems are a current evolution in thinking at the land court, at least, and at least one case now at the appeals court.

810
01:19:03,529 --> 01:19:20,113
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the judges of the land court, the chief judge, Piper, ruled a couple of years ago that solar energy, which has a differently worded section of provisions protecting it in section three, completely different words by the legislature than we're used to,

811
01:19:21,842 --> 01:19:33,188
[SPEAKER_18]: functionally the same as a church, a school, or a childcare facility, and that effectively they cannot be banned by a municipality, but they can be made subject to reasonable regulations.

812
01:19:34,069 --> 01:19:37,671
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't know where that's going, calling your attention to it for that reason.

813
01:19:39,211 --> 01:19:49,717
[SPEAKER_18]: The cases that are typically involved in the early growth of this doctrine are smaller towns where they've banned large-scale ground-mounted

814
01:19:50,627 --> 01:19:56,370
[SPEAKER_18]: facilities in residence districts, and the providers are fighting that.

815
01:19:57,151 --> 01:20:06,996
[SPEAKER_18]: And because of the land court's point of view, they seem to be winning that argument, but the fight isn't over, so.

816
01:20:07,296 --> 01:20:12,279
[SPEAKER_18]: These are the heavier uses, freight, industrial, research and laboratory.

817
01:20:12,299 --> 01:20:19,663
[SPEAKER_18]: I think new here would be number,

818
01:20:21,390 --> 01:20:23,332
[SPEAKER_18]: 11, the mini and self-storage warehouse.

819
01:20:25,753 --> 01:20:29,035
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe research and testing laboratory was in your existing.

820
01:20:29,415 --> 01:20:33,918
[SPEAKER_18]: Victor, do you recall if we added that to the use table or just to the O2 district?

821
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:39,682
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not new to the use table, Mark.

822
01:20:39,702 --> 01:20:40,782
[SPEAKER_04]: That was existing.

823
01:20:41,443 --> 01:20:42,363
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

824
01:20:42,864 --> 01:20:45,986
[SPEAKER_18]: And you can see the new column here for the O2 district.

825
01:20:46,026 --> 01:20:48,327
[SPEAKER_18]: So when you ask what's that all about, well,

826
01:20:48,785 --> 01:20:56,771
[SPEAKER_18]: It's about the sum total of the entries in all of these different line items and whether you can do them or not in the O2 district.

827
01:20:57,371 --> 01:21:07,679
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you're interested in what uses would be available in O2, just peruse this column forth from the end and you'll see scrolling up and down what you can do in the O2 district.

828
01:21:12,263 --> 01:21:15,385
[SPEAKER_18]: So these are the accessory uses that are available

829
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:19,031
[SPEAKER_18]: summarized here in the table as well as in the text.

830
01:21:21,052 --> 01:21:34,459
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'd say that the chief changes that I made were to especially focus on the community uses and to make sure that there was statutory consistency in your reference to them.

831
01:21:34,479 --> 01:21:39,322
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it's one thing to say church or school, but that's not what the statute says.

832
01:21:39,402 --> 01:21:45,925
[SPEAKER_18]: The statute says primary use of land for religious purposes and education has its own wording as well.

833
01:21:46,781 --> 01:21:52,544
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we also broke out a few things that just needed to be refined a little bit.

834
01:21:52,584 --> 01:21:57,346
[SPEAKER_18]: So retail isn't one size fits all, it's three sizes are more appropriate.

835
01:21:58,867 --> 01:22:00,427
[SPEAKER_18]: And those are the changes as well.

836
01:22:09,572 --> 01:22:11,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thank you, Attorney Bobrowski.

837
01:22:13,288 --> 01:22:19,949
[SPEAKER_10]: So at that point, let's just take some, let's see if there's comments or questions from the board members, followed by members of the public.

838
01:22:21,309 --> 01:22:34,572
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we will take, I think, a five minute break to give everyone a chance to regroup, especially Attorney Bobrowski, maybe get a drink of water if he wants that.

839
01:22:34,972 --> 01:22:38,673
[SPEAKER_18]: I turn off my camera, go to the refrigerator if I need to, don't worry about me.

840
01:22:39,093 --> 01:22:39,293
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

841
01:22:41,722 --> 01:22:51,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Board members, any comments or questions about the use table?

842
01:22:51,630 --> 01:23:05,021
[SPEAKER_19]: I think this is one of the more, has been one of the areas that has been in need of the most help in zoning, having attempted to use the existing table.

843
01:23:06,262 --> 01:23:07,263
[SPEAKER_19]: It's very impractical.

844
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:13,013
[SPEAKER_19]: Mark has touched on this because the definitions are off, you don't really understand what categories are intended.

845
01:23:13,513 --> 01:23:14,994
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just so far out of date.

846
01:23:15,995 --> 01:23:31,003
[SPEAKER_19]: And certainly there are judgment calls about what uses might want to be allowed in what district, but I think it's a very meaningful improvement to at least get this up to date in terms of the categories.

847
01:23:31,323 --> 01:23:34,084
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just wanted to share that.

848
01:23:40,772 --> 01:23:41,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Other board members?

849
01:23:45,476 --> 01:23:57,066
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we already did talk a lot about the border issue and the single family district, so I won't kind of harp on that again, but something that we'll maybe look at more closely.

850
01:23:59,208 --> 01:24:01,369
[SPEAKER_10]: I go into members of the public, William Snyder.

851
01:24:01,389 --> 01:24:07,515
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I just have a, I think it's just an oversight, but the,

852
01:24:08,632 --> 01:24:14,918
[SPEAKER_20]: The draft references the off-street parking and loading requirements in the use table, but I didn't see them in the current draft of the use table.

853
01:24:15,478 --> 01:24:17,921
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that needs to be added, that's all.

854
01:24:25,567 --> 01:24:29,992
[SPEAKER_18]: What's posted as the current draft of the use table?

855
01:24:30,892 --> 01:24:31,233
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe...

856
01:24:32,665 --> 01:24:41,288
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll take a look, because I thought that the column that I think you're referring to is the one that's called, there's PC for parking and LC for loading.

857
01:24:42,888 --> 01:24:51,371
[SPEAKER_17]: That's accurate on my computer, but let me open what the, I'm clicking through the, yeah, that's what's there.

858
01:24:51,411 --> 01:24:55,833
[SPEAKER_17]: The October 1, 2021 version is what is on the website.

859
01:24:56,413 --> 01:24:57,894
[SPEAKER_17]: So the column LC.

860
01:24:58,534 --> 01:24:59,174
[SPEAKER_20]: I see it now.

861
01:24:59,374 --> 01:25:01,035
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it's a different way of showing it.

862
01:25:01,195 --> 01:25:01,955
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, thank you.

863
01:25:10,857 --> 01:25:21,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so seeing no comments at this time, let's just take a quick five minute break and let everybody kind of stretch or get a drink of water.

864
01:25:23,761 --> 01:25:28,002
[SPEAKER_10]: And it is, let's see, 7.36 right now.

865
01:25:28,122 --> 01:25:29,722
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll come back at 7.41.

866
01:25:33,983 --> 01:25:34,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

867
01:25:34,383 --> 01:25:34,703
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

868
01:25:56,757 --> 01:25:57,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thank you everybody.

869
01:25:57,698 --> 01:26:02,701
[SPEAKER_10]: It's 7.41, so we will get back to business.

870
01:26:03,691 --> 01:26:09,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Attorney Bobrowski, I did have one question actually while I stretched was the solar systems.

871
01:26:09,695 --> 01:26:12,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Took me a little while to digest that a bit.

872
01:26:12,756 --> 01:26:21,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you suggesting that those all have to be as of right or that they could be by special permit?

873
01:26:22,282 --> 01:26:31,567
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, Judge Piper ruled that despite the different wording that the legislature applied to solar energy systems back in the 1980s,

874
01:26:33,484 --> 01:26:37,907
[SPEAKER_18]: The intent was that they'd be treated like church or school or childcare facilities.

875
01:26:39,167 --> 01:26:43,330
[SPEAKER_18]: And you cannot put a church, a school or a childcare facility on special permit.

876
01:26:45,411 --> 01:26:46,832
[SPEAKER_18]: That's very decided.

877
01:26:47,292 --> 01:26:51,915
[SPEAKER_18]: And the lead case is of course, Tufts College versus City of Medgar.

878
01:26:52,315 --> 01:26:55,897
[SPEAKER_18]: So you can't require them to get a variance.

879
01:26:55,917 --> 01:26:58,899
[SPEAKER_18]: You can't require them to be treated as non-conforming uses and structures.

880
01:26:58,939 --> 01:27:02,541
[SPEAKER_18]: There was a companion case to Tufts College called Campbell versus City of Lynn.

881
01:27:02,978 --> 01:27:04,099
[SPEAKER_18]: They're back to back in the book.

882
01:27:04,579 --> 01:27:07,341
[SPEAKER_18]: And those were decided, those issues were decided in that case.

883
01:27:07,401 --> 01:27:14,525
[SPEAKER_18]: So if Judge Piper's right, then that's gonna be where solar ends up going.

884
01:27:14,885 --> 01:27:22,410
[SPEAKER_18]: Right now, the statute says, solar cannot be unreasonably regulated or prohibited except to promote health, safety, or welfare.

885
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:23,471
[SPEAKER_18]: Totally different wording.

886
01:27:24,331 --> 01:27:29,114
[SPEAKER_18]: And this has happened way too often in the legislature's treatment of the issues in zoning.

887
01:27:29,794 --> 01:27:30,695
[SPEAKER_18]: Use the same language.

888
01:27:32,476 --> 01:27:36,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Could that be subject to site plan review if that does happen?

889
01:27:37,938 --> 01:27:41,980
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, more and more Dover amendment uses are subject to site plan review.

890
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:46,782
[SPEAKER_18]: In fact, we've added a site plan review provision in the back of the ordinance for those uses.

891
01:27:47,702 --> 01:28:00,767
[SPEAKER_18]: Otherwise it's the poor building inspector who has to take this on when it comes in and he's on an Island and it's better to do it by a board in virtually all controversial cases.

892
01:28:01,168 --> 01:28:02,028
[SPEAKER_18]: So I have,

893
01:28:02,762 --> 01:28:22,474
[SPEAKER_18]: The land court decided about 10 years ago in a case by Judge Sands involving a Jewish cemetery in Wayland, that as long as you didn't use site plan review to say no, and you treated these protected uses with the degree of involvement that the statute foresees, then there's nothing wrong with doing it by site plan review.

894
01:28:23,534 --> 01:28:24,795
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you.

895
01:28:26,396 --> 01:28:31,079
[SPEAKER_17]: Andre, before you move on to this, I want a housekeeping item.

896
01:28:32,931 --> 01:28:52,347
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe, and I don't know if this is a ruling, that all comments, because this is a legal public hearing, that the board, in order to be considered by the board, must either be submitted in writing while the hearing is open, so people can submit them, there's no way we're going to close this hearing tonight, to the

897
01:28:53,828 --> 01:28:57,851
[SPEAKER_17]: staff here and we'll forward them to the board or they must be made out loud.

898
01:28:58,291 --> 01:29:15,703
[SPEAKER_17]: I've noticed that there are some comments in the chat and I appreciate that people don't want to make this go longer than necessary but I'm not clear that we can accept like legally comments if they're not either out loud or in writing to the the staff.

899
01:29:18,785 --> 01:29:23,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay well maybe I could

900
01:29:24,730 --> 01:29:25,871
[SPEAKER_10]: say some of those comments.

901
01:29:25,931 --> 01:29:28,812
[SPEAKER_17]: They could be read out loud and that would be fine.

902
01:29:29,092 --> 01:29:31,293
[SPEAKER_17]: We have certainly done that in other meetings as well.

903
01:29:32,193 --> 01:29:43,679
[SPEAKER_17]: I just, I felt like I didn't want people to feel, I don't know, I wanted this all to be transparent and this is being watched on television and played out on television and available in the recording.

904
01:29:44,119 --> 01:29:50,742
[SPEAKER_17]: The chat will not be available as part of the recording, so that's why everything needs to be out loud.

905
01:29:56,332 --> 01:30:09,596
[SPEAKER_10]: So if anybody has made a comment in the chat that you would like to be in part of the, in the official record, just raise your hand and I'll call on you and you'll be able to read your comment.

906
01:30:12,236 --> 01:30:16,297
[SPEAKER_10]: But in the meantime, okay, let's do that, Roberta.

907
01:30:20,798 --> 01:30:22,679
[SPEAKER_12]: My apologies, I meant to,

908
01:30:24,592 --> 01:30:28,734
[SPEAKER_12]: use the chat as a shortcut not to make it take longer so I'll just read it quickly and thank you.

909
01:30:29,035 --> 01:30:32,176
[SPEAKER_12]: This is relating to the housing discussion that we had earlier.

910
01:30:32,196 --> 01:30:38,039
[SPEAKER_12]: And my comment was that the entry level of housing is actually a room, rather than an apartment

911
01:30:38,785 --> 01:30:55,953
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to ensure that a young adult who's not necessarily a college student, but who works in the local service industry is able to obtain housing in Medford, which is likely to take the form of a room rather than an apartment or an accessory dwelling unit due to the cost of housing right now.

912
01:30:56,574 --> 01:31:06,999
[SPEAKER_12]: And I also agree that the option, particularly for seniors to be able to share their house safely, either with lodgers or as accessory dwelling units,

913
01:31:07,719 --> 01:31:15,225
[SPEAKER_12]: which offer more privacy and security than a lodging arrangement is an important housing stability and affordability need.

914
01:31:15,686 --> 01:31:17,807
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to make that comment.

915
01:31:17,848 --> 01:31:18,228
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

916
01:31:19,489 --> 01:31:20,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Roberta.

917
01:31:24,993 --> 01:31:25,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody else?

918
01:31:30,037 --> 01:31:36,743
[SPEAKER_10]: I do note that William Navar pointed out a typo on page eight, just saying that the C2 heading is duplicated.

919
01:31:38,573 --> 01:31:39,533
[SPEAKER_10]: That has been noted.

920
01:31:39,553 --> 01:31:44,574
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll read my comment briefly.

921
01:31:44,634 --> 01:31:46,594
[SPEAKER_09]: David McKenna to Vine Street.

922
01:31:48,135 --> 01:31:55,536
[SPEAKER_09]: I noticed that MUZ zoning, mixed use zoning, does not allow boarding houses or lodgers.

923
01:31:56,616 --> 01:32:08,058
[SPEAKER_09]: I think if any zoning should allow it, that would be a good place for boarding houses or lodgers to be permitted in the MUZ mixed use.

924
01:32:08,948 --> 01:32:11,049
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking about station landing, things like that.

925
01:32:13,391 --> 01:32:13,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, David.

926
01:32:15,752 --> 01:32:19,855
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Betty had made a comment about businesses.

927
01:32:19,935 --> 01:32:21,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you like to say that, Betty?

928
01:32:21,516 --> 01:32:29,420
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if she's on yet, so I'll just I'll read it.

929
01:32:30,281 --> 01:32:35,164
[SPEAKER_10]: So Betty had said that we lost a lot of small business storefronts with the loss of the Meadow Glen Mall.

930
01:32:35,608 --> 01:32:47,294
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope city council takes that into consideration as they decide on retail zoning and perhaps giving a leg up to developments with small storefronts that present a lower barrier to entry for local and small business owners.

931
01:32:50,835 --> 01:32:51,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

932
01:32:53,396 --> 01:32:55,617
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, section four, I believe we're on.

933
01:33:04,504 --> 01:33:08,565
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so section four is dimensional regulations.

934
01:33:09,326 --> 01:33:10,526
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm gonna scroll back here.

935
01:33:12,287 --> 01:33:16,268
[SPEAKER_18]: And most, if the vast majority of this is not changed.

936
01:33:16,608 --> 01:33:19,369
[SPEAKER_18]: So the first is the table of dimensional requirements.

937
01:33:19,429 --> 01:33:24,571
[SPEAKER_18]: The only changes to the table would be the addition of the O2 line.

938
01:33:25,751 --> 01:33:31,233
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't, I'm trying to remember whether Paul suggested any others, but they were tweaks.

939
01:33:32,134 --> 01:33:33,254
[SPEAKER_18]: Nothing major was done.

940
01:33:35,775 --> 01:33:54,287
[SPEAKER_18]: All of this is existing regulations, supplementary dimensional requirements, courts, minimum distance between structures, special cases, general application of yard requirements, front yard, side yard, rear yard, all existing language.

941
01:33:54,507 --> 01:33:56,508
[SPEAKER_18]: In fact, that's gotta be changed right there.

942
01:33:56,548 --> 01:33:59,590
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me make a note to myself.

943
01:34:02,531 --> 01:34:09,777
[SPEAKER_18]: So that reference in 4253 is old.

944
01:34:11,738 --> 01:34:13,320
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll find the new cross reference there.

945
01:34:14,761 --> 01:34:17,743
[SPEAKER_18]: Application of height requirements, same deal.

946
01:34:18,744 --> 01:34:21,246
[SPEAKER_18]: Minimum open space requirements, nothing's changed.

947
01:34:22,547 --> 01:34:24,588
[SPEAKER_18]: Certain cases, nothing's changed.

948
01:34:25,729 --> 01:34:30,373
[SPEAKER_18]: Accessory structures, there were some tweaks here, largely driven by the building commissioner.

949
01:34:31,047 --> 01:34:35,631
[SPEAKER_18]: who had experience in the field and wanted to reflect that in his tweaks.

950
01:34:39,253 --> 01:34:40,875
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's it for section four.

951
01:34:42,396 --> 01:34:44,157
[SPEAKER_18]: I can show the dimensional table.

952
01:34:48,901 --> 01:34:49,181
[SPEAKER_18]: Oops.

953
01:34:53,284 --> 01:34:56,467
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is the new dimensional table, again, dated October 1st.

954
01:34:58,837 --> 01:35:02,180
[SPEAKER_18]: a little bit easier to use than the old one, but it's the same table.

955
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:10,147
[SPEAKER_18]: And here, in fact, you would see the O2 additions.

956
01:35:12,369 --> 01:35:14,791
[SPEAKER_18]: There's G at the bottom of the page there.

957
01:35:17,113 --> 01:35:18,554
[SPEAKER_18]: There's your O2 language.

958
01:35:20,876 --> 01:35:23,639
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I think- Oh, sorry.

959
01:35:23,719 --> 01:35:25,160
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me go back, kill the old one.

960
01:35:31,392 --> 01:35:35,975
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you might have to stop sharing and then share the right window.

961
01:35:49,544 --> 01:35:58,350
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the interesting things about being out of the country and doing this is what works and what doesn't work in Zoom.

962
01:36:01,230 --> 01:36:05,332
[SPEAKER_18]: I had a meeting last night with the board that they couldn't see me and I couldn't screen share.

963
01:36:05,372 --> 01:36:06,873
[SPEAKER_18]: So that was the end of that, we continued.

964
01:36:07,753 --> 01:36:10,295
[SPEAKER_18]: But we tested this out, Amanda and I, early today.

965
01:36:11,875 --> 01:36:14,116
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's O2 across the board.

966
01:36:15,657 --> 01:36:18,258
[SPEAKER_18]: These were Victor's recommendations and we put them in.

967
01:36:19,279 --> 01:36:22,340
[SPEAKER_18]: I would focus on that as the changes to the dimensional table.

968
01:36:23,541 --> 01:36:25,382
[SPEAKER_18]: That's about it for the dimensional stuff.

969
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:41,545
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe, could I invite Victor, the director of economic development to just talk a little bit about the O2 district and why this is being proposed.

970
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:46,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you, Andre.

971
01:36:46,082 --> 01:36:48,706
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you, Mark.

972
01:36:48,947 --> 01:36:53,735
[SPEAKER_04]: This was really, it was a pretty robust discussion with City Council.

973
01:36:53,915 --> 01:36:57,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say we proposed it in concert because

974
01:37:00,366 --> 01:37:09,833
[SPEAKER_04]: The thesis here was we have districts in the community, commercial districts, such as the office, existing office, mixed-use, industrial.

975
01:37:11,554 --> 01:37:27,965
[SPEAKER_04]: But really, none of those districts accommodate what we would consider a modern infill mixed-use commercial office building that could house lab, life science, or other commercial office uses.

976
01:37:29,527 --> 01:37:44,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're built out here, we need to kind of rethink, in our opinion, what the commercial district would look like for those types of buildings.

977
01:37:45,444 --> 01:37:46,705
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what we've tried to do.

978
01:37:47,526 --> 01:37:48,027
[SPEAKER_04]: What you'll see

979
01:37:50,309 --> 01:38:07,682
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a larger lot coverage, slightly larger lot coverage, some flexibility and setbacks, and kind of a middle range of density between the office district and the industrial district.

980
01:38:08,467 --> 01:38:15,613
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, as was stated earlier in the meeting, we haven't changed the map to include this anywhere in the community.

981
01:38:16,394 --> 01:38:34,949
[SPEAKER_04]: But the areas that we're thinking about and would like to talk to the council and the community about are legacy industrial areas, where what we have now are buildings that are either nonconforming or industrial buildings that

982
01:38:37,808 --> 01:38:53,225
[SPEAKER_04]: are very low density with lots of parking and not a lot of permeability in terms of the land lot coverage, not public facing.

983
01:38:54,207 --> 01:38:58,049
[SPEAKER_04]: and not contributing a lot to the job base or tax revenue.

984
01:38:58,349 --> 01:39:07,172
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, in our opinion, those are underutilized areas of the community that could be contributing and we think there's market demand for it.

985
01:39:10,397 --> 01:39:11,939
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of high level.

986
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:20,707
[SPEAKER_04]: We can dig into the dimensional set here, if you'd like, and talk about those specifically as the board has questions.

987
01:39:22,028 --> 01:39:33,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so the public knows, we did submit a letter to the CD board, giving them an overview of the thinking here for your consideration, a little background.

988
01:39:34,699 --> 01:39:35,500
[SPEAKER_04]: for specific uses.

989
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:39,982
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really difficult to right size new zoning districts like this for specific

990
01:40:02,208 --> 01:40:17,602
[SPEAKER_04]: In a situation where, you know, someone needs a developer needs a couple feet here there and they they need to go for variance and variances are given very sparingly and by very specific need to meet specific hurdles in terms of hardship so.

991
01:40:19,224 --> 01:40:24,608
[SPEAKER_04]: That's our recommendation, and we do that in other districts in the community.

992
01:40:24,648 --> 01:40:44,203
[SPEAKER_04]: The mixed-use district has dimensional relief by special permit, but it's not broadly used throughout the community, kind of more of a modern approach to development of this type in an urban area than we've seen in zoning to date.

993
01:40:45,964 --> 01:40:52,827
[SPEAKER_04]: The thought is that at this time, this could be a bridge to allow us to try it out in a couple areas of the community.

994
01:40:52,887 --> 01:41:06,253
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as the comprehensive plan input comes online, we can rethink that, adjust, and start to think about other places that this makes sense throughout Medford.

995
01:41:06,273 --> 01:41:06,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

996
01:41:06,473 --> 01:41:06,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

997
01:41:11,796 --> 01:41:27,906
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I would add one comment to that, and that is because putting in a district like this at this time is sort of directly contradictory to what I had said earlier about wanting the comprehensive plan work to come first.

998
01:41:28,588 --> 01:41:40,151
[SPEAKER_17]: However, our office has been approached and we've heard from many developers trying to do life sciences in Medford right now that is not allowed, but through our zoning.

999
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:50,214
[SPEAKER_17]: And this would, the sooner that we have a tool to allow them to do life sciences, the better, because this is a very hot,

1000
01:41:53,225 --> 01:42:11,929
[SPEAKER_17]: field right now and people would like to develop here and we would like those jobs here in Medford and waiting actually six months is a really long time in the development cycle for these types of buildings right now because of the state of the world at this time.

1001
01:42:12,269 --> 01:42:22,892
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's why this feels a little contradictory to my earlier comment that the office was trying to wait for the comprehensive plan first and is putting forward this now.

1002
01:42:25,176 --> 01:42:27,620
[SPEAKER_10]: district is really only commercial.

1003
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:30,004
[SPEAKER_10]: It does not include residential.

1004
01:42:33,590 --> 01:42:34,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, Victor, you were going to say something.

1005
01:42:37,248 --> 01:42:42,533
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just to kind of cap that thought by Alicia.

1006
01:42:43,034 --> 01:42:45,896
[SPEAKER_04]: We also are looking forward to folks' input on this.

1007
01:42:46,297 --> 01:42:53,063
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we wanted to have this be a starting point and get certainly CD boards' input and the community's input.

1008
01:42:53,604 --> 01:42:53,884
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

1009
01:42:53,904 --> 01:42:59,729
[SPEAKER_10]: So these are basically just to kind of

1010
01:43:01,606 --> 01:43:12,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Recap, it's commercial only districts, right, in the office too, a new proposal that can go up to six stories.

1011
01:43:13,792 --> 01:43:29,400
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not proposed anywhere in the map right now, but it is seen to be the scale that's needed to do some of the spillover, life sciences,

1012
01:43:31,269 --> 01:43:34,330
[SPEAKER_10]: development that we're seeing in neighboring communities.

1013
01:43:35,431 --> 01:43:38,432
[SPEAKER_10]: If I can, if I summarized all of that correctly.

1014
01:43:40,853 --> 01:43:42,733
[SPEAKER_17]: Any- That is correct.

1015
01:43:45,174 --> 01:43:49,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Any questions or comments from the board or members of the public about the O2 district in particular?

1016
01:43:49,756 --> 01:43:55,838
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1017
01:43:57,239 --> 01:43:58,079
[SPEAKER_10]: Attorney Borowski.

1018
01:43:58,099 --> 01:44:00,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Section five.

1019
01:44:01,448 --> 01:44:02,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, section five.

1020
01:44:02,949 --> 01:44:03,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.

1021
01:44:11,935 --> 01:44:29,446
[SPEAKER_18]: So now we're getting into some substantial changes here and fitting that it would be done in what is widely known as the black hole of the zoning act, nonconforming uses and structures.

1022
01:44:30,292 --> 01:44:57,584
[SPEAKER_18]: So the easiest way to explain this is that when the legislature rewrote the zoning statute, the last time was 1976, try to get your head around that, they pointed out in work that led up to the legislation that non-conforming uses and structures could actually be terminated, wiped out, but somebody would have to pay for that.

1023
01:44:58,765 --> 01:44:59,365
[SPEAKER_18]: You could also,

1024
01:45:00,225 --> 01:45:28,251
[SPEAKER_18]: uh approach them with the option that they could never change that they were tolerated as they were on the day they became non-conforming and Non-conforming uses and structures become non-conforming as the result of a zoning amendment They were lawful when created or they were created before zoning And now the zoning has either changed or been adopted and these buildings or uses no longer comply That's the only way according to the appeals court that a non-conforming use of structure can be created

1025
01:45:28,807 --> 01:45:37,669
[SPEAKER_18]: So if that happened and you had a widget family in a residential district, you could make it stay just as it was on the day it became nonconforming.

1026
01:45:38,390 --> 01:45:42,731
[SPEAKER_18]: And the third option would be that you could let them change, expand, alter.

1027
01:45:43,751 --> 01:45:52,974
[SPEAKER_18]: And if they were to do that, what kinds of changes, expansions and alterations would be countenanced and would it be by special permit or would it be by right?

1028
01:45:53,574 --> 01:45:56,655
[SPEAKER_18]: So those are the ingredients that go into this section.

1029
01:45:56,715 --> 01:45:57,275
[SPEAKER_18]: You can see,

1030
01:45:57,983 --> 01:46:02,187
[SPEAKER_18]: that the threshold for a nonconformity is defined in section 5.1.1.

1031
01:46:03,047 --> 01:46:06,790
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right in the statute, which is chapter 48, section six.

1032
01:46:07,491 --> 01:46:14,217
[SPEAKER_18]: Commencement of construction or operation is a provision right out of the statute.

1033
01:46:14,297 --> 01:46:20,202
[SPEAKER_18]: In fact, it's one of two provisions in the statute that says zoning ordinance and bylaws shall contain this provision.

1034
01:46:20,582 --> 01:46:22,464
[SPEAKER_18]: So not one word has changed there.

1035
01:46:23,064 --> 01:46:26,427
[SPEAKER_18]: So then we come down to the action items here, nonconforming uses.

1036
01:46:27,225 --> 01:46:34,327
[SPEAKER_18]: What kind of uses that are today non-conforming can be considered for changes?

1037
01:46:35,308 --> 01:46:37,728
[SPEAKER_18]: One, change or substantial extension of the use.

1038
01:46:37,768 --> 01:46:39,349
[SPEAKER_18]: That comes right out of the statute.

1039
01:46:40,309 --> 01:46:46,271
[SPEAKER_18]: And two, change from one non-conforming use to another non-conforming use, which is not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood.

1040
01:46:46,711 --> 01:46:51,093
[SPEAKER_18]: When a special permit is granted under the subsection, no use variance shall be required.

1041
01:46:51,173 --> 01:46:54,574
[SPEAKER_18]: I put that in there because I wanted to be abundantly clear that

1042
01:46:56,883 --> 01:47:02,546
[SPEAKER_18]: 5.2.1.2 is, for all practical purposes, the grant of a variance without the hardship test.

1043
01:47:02,886 --> 01:47:23,836
[SPEAKER_18]: So what it says is that if you've got something terrible today, it's a non-conforming use and it's terrible, but somebody wants to do something different there and it's better, even if it's slightly better, why not at least allow them to apply for a special permit to change the old terrible use to a slightly better but non-conforming use?

1044
01:47:24,116 --> 01:47:24,496
[SPEAKER_18]: In other words,

1045
01:47:25,132 --> 01:47:26,473
[SPEAKER_18]: New use isn't allowed either.

1046
01:47:27,113 --> 01:47:32,777
[SPEAKER_18]: The test case for this was a gravel pit in Winchendon years ago.

1047
01:47:33,337 --> 01:47:38,040
[SPEAKER_18]: And the new use that they wanted to start was a demolition landfill.

1048
01:47:38,921 --> 01:47:40,281
[SPEAKER_18]: Neither are a pretty picture.

1049
01:47:40,782 --> 01:47:45,705
[SPEAKER_18]: But the demolition landfill, at least in the minds of the ZBA, was better than a hole in the ground.

1050
01:47:46,225 --> 01:47:48,046
[SPEAKER_18]: And so they granted the special permit.

1051
01:47:48,106 --> 01:47:50,728
[SPEAKER_18]: The neighbors won, however, in their appeal,

1052
01:47:51,093 --> 01:47:54,957
[SPEAKER_18]: because the bylaw did not list that as a permissible change.

1053
01:47:55,217 --> 01:48:07,368
[SPEAKER_18]: So my lesson reading the case is why not at least offer somebody the opportunity to change one non-conforming use to another non-conforming use, which is not substantially more detrimental.

1054
01:48:07,568 --> 01:48:09,610
[SPEAKER_18]: I wrote the zoning in Norwood years ago.

1055
01:48:09,630 --> 01:48:16,016
[SPEAKER_18]: A client later approached me, he owns a building very close to the hospital, which dominates the center of town.

1056
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:19,821
[SPEAKER_18]: And the old building contained six apartments and six storage units.

1057
01:48:19,881 --> 01:48:21,801
[SPEAKER_18]: The storage units were nonconforming uses.

1058
01:48:22,681 --> 01:48:27,122
[SPEAKER_18]: And he was also a nonconforming structure because his back of the building was too close to the lot line.

1059
01:48:27,422 --> 01:48:28,002
[SPEAKER_18]: What did he want?

1060
01:48:28,062 --> 01:48:31,803
[SPEAKER_18]: He wanted to put 12 modern flats for sale, not allow.

1061
01:48:33,023 --> 01:48:34,224
[SPEAKER_18]: We went to the board of appeals.

1062
01:48:34,284 --> 01:48:37,164
[SPEAKER_18]: We said, what you have there today is an 1890 building.

1063
01:48:37,204 --> 01:48:38,465
[SPEAKER_18]: It will never be rewired.

1064
01:48:38,745 --> 01:48:42,806
[SPEAKER_18]: He'll never get a variance to change it because of soil condition, shape, topography.

1065
01:48:43,286 --> 01:48:44,946
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are the prerequisites of the statute.

1066
01:48:45,620 --> 01:48:49,322
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just an undersized lot, not eligible for a variance.

1067
01:48:49,703 --> 01:48:58,508
[SPEAKER_18]: Why not use this provision, which I had embedded in the Norwood zoning without knowing I'd be back, and why not let him change it to what he wants to do?

1068
01:48:58,828 --> 01:48:59,048
[SPEAKER_18]: Done.

1069
01:48:59,368 --> 01:49:05,832
[SPEAKER_18]: It took four special permits, but it didn't take a variance, and there's a building there going up today, I hope.

1070
01:49:06,813 --> 01:49:09,234
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's non-conforming uses.

1071
01:49:09,354 --> 01:49:11,916
[SPEAKER_18]: Non-conforming structures, same show.

1072
01:49:12,296 --> 01:49:15,038
[SPEAKER_18]: You basically have to list the changes that are permissible,

1073
01:49:15,623 --> 01:49:17,405
[SPEAKER_18]: Here, luckily, they're both in the statute.

1074
01:49:17,645 --> 01:49:20,067
[SPEAKER_18]: One, reconstruction, extension, or structural change.

1075
01:49:20,447 --> 01:49:27,793
[SPEAKER_18]: And two, alteration to provide for a substantially different purpose or for the same purpose in a substantially different manner or to a substantially greater extent.

1076
01:49:28,233 --> 01:49:31,636
[SPEAKER_18]: The first is garden variety changed to a non-conforming structure.

1077
01:49:31,956 --> 01:49:32,737
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what happens.

1078
01:49:32,917 --> 01:49:35,379
[SPEAKER_18]: Unless it's repair, it's one of those three things.

1079
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:38,582
[SPEAKER_18]: And the second is rarely discussed in the case law.

1080
01:49:38,602 --> 01:49:39,523
[SPEAKER_18]: There's only two cases.

1081
01:49:39,663 --> 01:49:40,483
[SPEAKER_18]: One's from Cambridge.

1082
01:49:40,904 --> 01:49:42,305
[SPEAKER_18]: It was the change from a garage

1083
01:49:43,363 --> 01:49:48,785
[SPEAKER_18]: to a, it was a change from a garage to a bedroom, I think, Nichols versus Board of Appeals.

1084
01:49:49,485 --> 01:49:54,087
[SPEAKER_18]: And then there's another case, a smaller case as well, but that's it, two cases in history.

1085
01:49:55,247 --> 01:49:59,529
[SPEAKER_18]: So again, the principle here is that you want to allow these things to change.

1086
01:50:00,009 --> 01:50:03,711
[SPEAKER_18]: You want to list the changes that are eligible and you want to put it on special permit.

1087
01:50:05,871 --> 01:50:12,814
[SPEAKER_18]: Variance required is the codification of the holding of the Supreme Judicial Court in Rockwood versus Snow-Incorp.

1088
01:50:13,417 --> 01:50:23,283
[SPEAKER_18]: And the court basically said, if you've got a nonconforming structure and you want to change it so as to increase an existing nonconformity or create a new one, it's a variance, not a special permit.

1089
01:50:23,463 --> 01:50:24,163
[SPEAKER_18]: And that makes sense.

1090
01:50:25,744 --> 01:50:37,091
[SPEAKER_18]: And you can see that the odd case in which the horizontal or vertical extension of an exterior wall at or along the same line will also require the issuance of a variance.

1091
01:50:37,951 --> 01:50:39,492
[SPEAKER_18]: So now we come to the place where

1092
01:50:41,294 --> 01:50:49,018
[SPEAKER_18]: 75% of the people who are watching meet the ordinance and that's non-conforming single and two-family residential structures.

1093
01:50:49,499 --> 01:50:52,620
[SPEAKER_18]: These structures are called out for different treatment by the statute.

1094
01:50:53,241 --> 01:51:03,486
[SPEAKER_18]: They're supposed to be given favorable treatment as opposed to the treatment that would be given an office building or a widget factory or a plain old non-conforming gas station.

1095
01:51:03,906 --> 01:51:07,968
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's supposed to be easier to change a non-conforming single or two-family residential

1096
01:51:08,545 --> 01:51:14,549
[SPEAKER_18]: Here, the question is whether or not the change increases the non-conforming nature of the structure.

1097
01:51:14,629 --> 01:51:16,190
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are mysterious words, aren't they?

1098
01:51:16,590 --> 01:51:18,111
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are right out of the statute.

1099
01:51:18,711 --> 01:51:23,594
[SPEAKER_18]: So years ago, there were a couple of cases that went all the way to the Supreme Judicial Court.

1100
01:51:23,634 --> 01:51:27,636
[SPEAKER_18]: I won't bore you at 906 with the details.

1101
01:51:28,157 --> 01:51:33,380
[SPEAKER_18]: Suffice to say that the judges ruled eventually that if

1102
01:51:34,801 --> 01:51:39,324
[SPEAKER_18]: That if a non-conforming single and two-family structure wants to change, you have to hold a hearing.

1103
01:51:39,844 --> 01:51:42,846
[SPEAKER_18]: And the hearing is two-part special permit hearing.

1104
01:51:42,966 --> 01:51:48,310
[SPEAKER_18]: First, determine whether the proposed alteration increases the non-conforming nature of the structure.

1105
01:51:49,111 --> 01:51:55,755
[SPEAKER_18]: If it does not, the court said, the applicant is entitled to the issuance of a special permit.

1106
01:51:57,237 --> 01:51:58,658
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not what special permits are.

1107
01:51:58,758 --> 01:52:00,639
[SPEAKER_18]: There is no entitlement to a special permit.

1108
01:52:00,659 --> 01:52:02,100
[SPEAKER_18]: You're entitled to a building permit.

1109
01:52:02,410 --> 01:52:04,311
[SPEAKER_18]: but you're not entitled to a special permit.

1110
01:52:05,072 --> 01:52:19,621
[SPEAKER_18]: So I knew the justices and I called to their attention the approach of Sudbury, which carved out certain things that we could just agree would never increase the non-conforming nature of the structure.

1111
01:52:20,042 --> 01:52:21,423
[SPEAKER_18]: And those are one, two, and three.

1112
01:52:22,063 --> 01:52:31,029
[SPEAKER_18]: If the area of the building, if the lot area is too small, but the alteration to the structure complies front, side, rear,

1113
01:52:31,688 --> 01:52:34,890
[SPEAKER_18]: building coverage, building height, that's a building permit.

1114
01:52:35,690 --> 01:52:43,895
[SPEAKER_18]: If the frontage is deficient, but the proposed alteration complies, front, rear side, building coverage, height, building permit.

1115
01:52:44,556 --> 01:52:58,904
[SPEAKER_18]: If the structure's in one side yard and the alteration will comply nonetheless with all current setback yard building coverage and not result in any increase in building height in the area of encroachment, that's a building.

1116
01:52:59,409 --> 01:53:04,971
[SPEAKER_18]: So this simplifies the approach that the Board of Appeals has to take with regard to non-conforming structures.

1117
01:53:05,151 --> 01:53:10,794
[SPEAKER_18]: One fourth question to ask, these are not and, and, and, and, this is or, or, and or.

1118
01:53:11,954 --> 01:53:27,060
[SPEAKER_18]: But the other point to consider is that if the proposed alterations to the non-conforming single or two family home will result in an increase of more than 100% in the gross floor area, that's a doubling of the size, it's a second floor on a ranch,

1119
01:53:27,882 --> 01:53:31,023
[SPEAKER_18]: then we ought to hold a public hearing and give people a chance to comment.

1120
01:53:31,804 --> 01:53:35,765
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is, you know, it's very complicated to explain it to you the first time.

1121
01:53:36,346 --> 01:53:39,027
[SPEAKER_18]: This is in at least 80 towns and cities that I've done.

1122
01:53:39,367 --> 01:53:41,448
[SPEAKER_18]: And my phone is not ringing off the hook.

1123
01:53:41,588 --> 01:53:43,149
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's a very simple system.

1124
01:53:45,110 --> 01:53:55,314
[SPEAKER_18]: Two justices on opposite sides of the Supreme Judicial Court both agreed with me that this eliminated the conundrum of the entitlement to a special permit.

1125
01:53:56,434 --> 01:54:21,490
[SPEAKER_18]: And the ones that don't meet one two or three Go on to apply for a special permit even if you increase the non-conforming nature of the structure if it doesn't cause substantial detriment you're still Eligible to take the shot at getting a special permit Those are That that's for what we would call out here in Concord teardowns or not not teardowns extensions alterations

1126
01:54:22,403 --> 01:54:48,892
[SPEAKER_18]: More to be said about this in section 5.7 abandonment or non-use is the next one The statute says a non-conforming use of structure, which is not used for two years uh is uh Gone, it's it's lost its protected status forever So when I did downtown holyoke back in the 1990s There wasn't much left there that wasn't abandoned or not not used for two years today.

1127
01:54:48,932 --> 01:54:51,353
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a thriving live work art community

1128
01:54:52,094 --> 01:55:00,559
[SPEAKER_18]: So we added a provision that by special permit, the Board of Appeals may reestablish a nonconforming use of structure that is otherwise abandoned or not used.

1129
01:55:00,839 --> 01:55:06,923
[SPEAKER_18]: So you can reinvent these and make use of them rather than watching them just turn into dust.

1130
01:55:07,763 --> 01:55:13,627
[SPEAKER_18]: And then 5.7, reconstruction after catastrophe or voluntary demolition.

1131
01:55:13,867 --> 01:55:17,549
[SPEAKER_18]: Any nonconforming structure may be reconstructed after a catastrophe.

1132
01:55:18,069 --> 01:55:19,190
[SPEAKER_18]: That's in the regular law.

1133
01:55:19,695 --> 01:55:22,255
[SPEAKER_18]: But after voluntary demolition, that's a teardown.

1134
01:55:22,856 --> 01:55:29,237
[SPEAKER_18]: And the provisions that they would follow is the reconstruction has to take place within two years after the demo.

1135
01:55:30,137 --> 01:55:37,498
[SPEAKER_18]: If it's going to be built in the same footprint at the same volume, I'm sorry, the same gross floor area, then it's as of right.

1136
01:55:37,878 --> 01:55:44,919
[SPEAKER_18]: If the footprint is changing or it's getting bigger, or the GFA is getting bigger, it's a special permit from the Board of Appeals.

1137
01:55:45,279 --> 01:55:48,100
[SPEAKER_18]: And most of the people that want to demo something and rebuild it

1138
01:55:48,470 --> 01:55:49,410
[SPEAKER_18]: are going to pick three.

1139
01:55:49,711 --> 01:55:57,254
[SPEAKER_18]: So two is in there only for the rare case where they're building back exactly the same.

1140
01:55:57,274 --> 01:56:02,176
[SPEAKER_18]: 5.8, 5.9, 5.10 are basic standards for substandard lots.

1141
01:56:04,878 --> 01:56:12,021
[SPEAKER_18]: This has to do with people swapping side yards in order to avoid variances for additions to homes.

1142
01:56:12,781 --> 01:56:14,042
[SPEAKER_18]: And eminent domain is a rare

1143
01:56:15,078 --> 01:56:23,566
[SPEAKER_18]: situation in which a lot can be made nonconforming by eminent domain, nonetheless, we'll be treating them as nonconforming structures.

1144
01:56:24,547 --> 01:56:25,548
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's a rewrite.

1145
01:56:26,149 --> 01:56:29,612
[SPEAKER_18]: If I were to show you the section of, I can do that.

1146
01:56:29,632 --> 01:56:37,159
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, this is basically a deletion of your entire existing ordinance on point.

1147
01:56:40,540 --> 01:56:41,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mark.

1148
01:56:42,022 --> 01:56:48,911
[SPEAKER_10]: It's definitely, I think, much more straightforward than what was there before, and I appreciate that.

1149
01:56:48,931 --> 01:56:55,561
[SPEAKER_10]: I do have one question about 5.5 and the language around that.

1150
01:56:59,207 --> 01:57:07,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, does not increase the non-conforming nature of said structure by more than 100% of gross floor area.

1151
01:57:07,957 --> 01:57:14,925
[SPEAKER_10]: And you gave an example, which makes a lot of sense, which is adding a second floor on top of a single story ranch house.

1152
01:57:15,005 --> 01:57:17,828
[SPEAKER_10]: But the way that's written, it just seems really broad.

1153
01:57:17,848 --> 01:57:18,789
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, could that also...

1154
01:57:19,943 --> 01:57:23,684
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems like it could also refer to additions on homes.

1155
01:57:24,224 --> 01:57:24,645
[SPEAKER_18]: It could.

1156
01:57:24,665 --> 01:57:40,390
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, the reason I put it in is because the second SJC case, which is Bjorklund versus Norwell ZBA, they met current setback yard building coverage and building height requirements with the proposed changes to the single family structure.

1157
01:57:41,110 --> 01:57:43,251
[SPEAKER_18]: But it was quintupling in size.

1158
01:57:44,151 --> 01:57:46,752
[SPEAKER_18]: And I said, whoa, at some point there's got to be a hearing.

1159
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:49,285
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just arbitrarily picked 100%.

1160
01:57:51,046 --> 01:57:52,046
[SPEAKER_18]: Doesn't need to be there.

1161
01:57:53,447 --> 01:58:03,493
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought, it was my feeling that if somebody wanted to double the size of a non-conforming single or two family home, the neighbors probably should get a voice.

1162
01:58:07,735 --> 01:58:14,138
[SPEAKER_18]: Winchester actually picked 50% and it filtered too fine.

1163
01:58:14,419 --> 01:58:16,860
[SPEAKER_18]: So everything was still coming in for a special permit.

1164
01:58:20,031 --> 01:58:33,769
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe, would it be helpful, Attorney Bobrowsky, we get a lot of cases at our ZBA right now where a single or two family house, usually a single,

1165
01:58:35,461 --> 01:58:36,362
[SPEAKER_17]: wants to increase.

1166
01:58:36,382 --> 01:58:40,966
[SPEAKER_17]: So most people aren't aware that our zoning allows a single family house to be two and a half stories.

1167
01:58:41,486 --> 01:58:51,914
[SPEAKER_17]: And a half story is actually defined as the third story being 50% or less of the square footage of the lower, the second floor.

1168
01:58:51,934 --> 01:58:57,319
[SPEAKER_17]: And there are some calculations for dormers and stuff.

1169
01:58:57,819 --> 01:59:00,360
[SPEAKER_17]: And we had a lot of people coming who want to increase.

1170
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:05,323
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't want to make a full third story, but they want to increase the size.

1171
01:59:05,363 --> 01:59:06,384
[SPEAKER_17]: They want to put in dormers.

1172
01:59:06,404 --> 01:59:07,644
[SPEAKER_17]: They want to blow that out a little.

1173
01:59:08,204 --> 01:59:22,452
[SPEAKER_17]: So if I'm correct in understanding, if that single family house is already nonconforming, then they would be allowed to do that additional area up there as of right, obviously with a building permit.

1174
01:59:24,057 --> 01:59:33,646
[SPEAKER_17]: But if the existing single family house was conforming to zoning, they would not be allowed to increase the third floor as of right.

1175
01:59:34,266 --> 01:59:34,927
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that correct?

1176
01:59:36,028 --> 01:59:37,349
[SPEAKER_18]: It sounds like it might be, yeah.

1177
01:59:38,090 --> 01:59:45,776
[SPEAKER_17]: And I raised that specifically because it is common that a CBA hearing has two or three of these.

1178
01:59:46,517 --> 01:59:50,881
[SPEAKER_18]: You'd be changing something non-conforming to something also non-conforming.

1179
01:59:51,245 --> 01:59:55,126
[SPEAKER_18]: But in your other example, you'd be changing from conforming to nonconforming.

1180
01:59:55,566 --> 01:59:59,308
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's generally where the courts have drawn the line between special permanent variance.

1181
02:00:00,388 --> 02:00:12,772
[SPEAKER_17]: I will say that this case of a third, a partial third floor becoming a larger partial third floor is a very common request in Medford and is usually seen by the ZBA as

1182
02:00:14,615 --> 02:00:17,376
[SPEAKER_17]: very reasonable request.

1183
02:00:17,917 --> 02:00:22,839
[SPEAKER_17]: So it would be nice if they didn't all have to come in front of, but that is certainly not doubling.

1184
02:00:22,879 --> 02:00:26,961
[SPEAKER_17]: That is most cases that mild increases.

1185
02:00:27,641 --> 02:00:39,826
[SPEAKER_18]: I have to say that my prejudice here is to allow anybody to make an application for anything that they think does not cause substantial detriment without putting arbitrary caps on it.

1186
02:00:39,886 --> 02:00:42,267
[SPEAKER_18]: Like no increase can be more than 30% or, you know,

1187
02:00:43,837 --> 02:00:46,798
[SPEAKER_18]: I see that a lot of times when I'm rewriting stuff.

1188
02:00:46,838 --> 02:00:55,879
[SPEAKER_18]: And if somebody has a good idea that doesn't fit in the box that's prescribed by a zoning ordinance, why not at least offer them the opportunity to present it?

1189
02:00:55,919 --> 02:00:57,720
[SPEAKER_18]: If you don't think it's a good idea, just say no.

1190
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:10,742
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think people need to understand that when a board decides a special permit, it's not like the board, it's very unlikely that the board will lose.

1191
02:01:11,974 --> 02:01:20,882
[SPEAKER_18]: The courts are instructed to give deference to the special permit decision of a board of appeals, of a CDB, of a city council.

1192
02:01:21,883 --> 02:01:25,405
[SPEAKER_18]: The standard is whether or not the decision was fairly debatable.

1193
02:01:25,466 --> 02:01:26,066
[SPEAKER_18]: Think about that.

1194
02:01:26,747 --> 02:01:28,948
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, we all remember the OJ trial.

1195
02:01:28,988 --> 02:01:30,209
[SPEAKER_18]: That wasn't fairly debatable.

1196
02:01:30,250 --> 02:01:31,851
[SPEAKER_18]: That was beyond a reasonable doubt.

1197
02:01:32,752 --> 02:01:34,453
[SPEAKER_18]: This fairly debatable is 51 to 49.

1198
02:01:36,935 --> 02:01:37,856
[SPEAKER_18]: And judges are told,

1199
02:01:38,458 --> 02:01:42,041
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't disturb a special permit decision or we'll reverse you on appeal.

1200
02:01:42,462 --> 02:01:44,163
[SPEAKER_18]: You're not the fact finder locally.

1201
02:01:44,544 --> 02:01:46,045
[SPEAKER_18]: Let the locals do their work.

1202
02:01:47,947 --> 02:01:59,958
[SPEAKER_10]: So Mark, the solution to what Alicia was talking about could be to just make three floors conforming.

1203
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:02,961
[SPEAKER_18]: Or maybe

1204
02:02:04,490 --> 02:02:13,858
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, maybe for a new building, the third floor might require a special permit to exceed the otherwise applicable coverage or GFA requirement.

1205
02:02:18,402 --> 02:02:25,208
[SPEAKER_10]: But for existing structures, I mean, is there, do you have any thoughts about that?

1206
02:02:27,570 --> 02:02:32,034
[SPEAKER_18]: I watched, I actually had a case on the South Coast where

1207
02:02:32,794 --> 02:02:34,234
[SPEAKER_18]: Everything was calculated.

1208
02:02:35,515 --> 02:02:42,816
[SPEAKER_18]: You needed a degree in statistics in order to figure out what you could use, what you couldn't use.

1209
02:02:43,116 --> 02:02:47,057
[SPEAKER_18]: If you didn't have an accurate picture of the old building, how did you even begin the process?

1210
02:02:47,797 --> 02:02:49,757
[SPEAKER_18]: People were actually testifying.

1211
02:02:49,797 --> 02:02:55,178
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been in that basement and it's not six feet tall in the left corner, that kind of thing.

1212
02:02:55,578 --> 02:02:58,839
[SPEAKER_18]: My prejudice is to just say, look, let them come forward with the idea.

1213
02:02:59,295 --> 02:02:59,855
[SPEAKER_18]: look at it.

1214
02:02:59,996 --> 02:03:02,157
[SPEAKER_18]: If it's a good idea, give them a special permit.

1215
02:03:02,217 --> 02:03:04,359
[SPEAKER_18]: If it's not a good idea, send them back.

1216
02:03:05,640 --> 02:03:05,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1217
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:08,162
[SPEAKER_10]: But in these cases, they'd have to go for a variance, right?

1218
02:03:08,182 --> 02:03:10,603
[SPEAKER_10]: That Alicia was talking about.

1219
02:03:10,723 --> 02:03:16,227
[SPEAKER_18]: The only thing that the case law suggests requires a variance, and I'm not sure about the case.

1220
02:03:17,408 --> 02:03:21,271
[SPEAKER_18]: There was a case from Brookline two years ago called Bell-Alta, SJC.

1221
02:03:21,852 --> 02:03:22,232
[SPEAKER_18]: They said,

1222
02:03:23,176 --> 02:03:33,342
[SPEAKER_18]: over the opposition of the neighbors, that if the house is simply increasing an existing nonconformity, it always just requires a special permit.

1223
02:03:33,962 --> 02:03:47,230
[SPEAKER_18]: And there's an old appeals court case from Chatham, older, that says if the increase to the single family home is a new nonconformity, that needs a variance.

1224
02:03:49,093 --> 02:03:59,201
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't know that in a footnote in the Valalta case, the court said, we realized that Dedrick versus Chatham is different, but we weren't asked that question today.

1225
02:03:59,721 --> 02:04:00,822
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're not gonna answer it.

1226
02:04:01,182 --> 02:04:04,585
[SPEAKER_18]: So it leads me to think that maybe that's a temporary place we're at.

1227
02:04:06,186 --> 02:04:12,571
[SPEAKER_18]: Remember, it's supposed to be easier for a single family home on principle in this law.

1228
02:04:12,591 --> 02:04:16,254
[SPEAKER_18]: It's embedded in this section six that a single family home

1229
02:04:16,796 --> 02:04:20,640
[SPEAKER_18]: two-family home should have an easier job of altering than a widget factory.

1230
02:04:21,080 --> 02:04:21,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1231
02:04:21,380 --> 02:04:33,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and it's all, it's just a little strange given like the Alicia's examples that it, it's more difficult for a conforming single-family home than a non-conforming single-family home to make that kind of change.

1232
02:04:33,612 --> 02:04:33,872
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1233
02:04:34,833 --> 02:04:38,536
[SPEAKER_18]: That's because the conforming home doesn't have an existing non-conformity.

1234
02:04:39,017 --> 02:04:41,479
[SPEAKER_18]: And so you don't fall into the trap of those two cases.

1235
02:04:43,283 --> 02:04:44,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, interesting.

1236
02:04:44,544 --> 02:04:50,686
[SPEAKER_18]: You're always creating a new nonconformity, which is always understood to create, to need a variance.

1237
02:04:51,406 --> 02:04:51,626
Right.

1238
02:04:52,947 --> 02:04:55,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Board members, any questions or comments before we go to the public?

1239
02:04:59,510 --> 02:04:59,830
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1240
02:05:00,710 --> 02:05:01,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Hands raised.

1241
02:05:01,631 --> 02:05:03,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Craig, name and address, please.

1242
02:05:05,072 --> 02:05:08,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Craig Nicholson, 68B Flag Road.

1243
02:05:09,914 --> 02:05:10,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Having trouble hearing you.

1244
02:05:10,915 --> 02:05:11,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Could you?

1245
02:05:12,662 --> 02:05:15,023
[SPEAKER_10]: speak louder or closer to the mic?

1246
02:05:16,023 --> 02:05:16,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Sir, can you hear me now?

1247
02:05:18,444 --> 02:05:18,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Still faint.

1248
02:05:18,944 --> 02:05:21,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, hold on.

1249
02:05:24,966 --> 02:05:25,427
[SPEAKER_10]: How about now?

1250
02:05:26,247 --> 02:05:26,687
[SPEAKER_10]: That's better.

1251
02:05:27,587 --> 02:05:27,887
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

1252
02:05:27,907 --> 02:05:33,469
[SPEAKER_05]: 68-feet flag road.

1253
02:05:33,489 --> 02:05:35,570
[SPEAKER_10]: We just lost you again, just went like right down.

1254
02:05:39,612 --> 02:05:40,632
[SPEAKER_20]: Really not hearing me?

1255
02:05:42,878 --> 02:05:43,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Not great.

1256
02:05:44,899 --> 02:05:46,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'll hold on.

1257
02:05:49,703 --> 02:05:56,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you try to connect via phone or if you wanna type into the chat, I'll read it out for you.

1258
02:05:56,787 --> 02:05:59,689
[SPEAKER_10]: And in the meantime, we'll go to a couple other comments.

1259
02:06:01,110 --> 02:06:01,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

1260
02:06:02,011 --> 02:06:04,373
[SPEAKER_10]: David, name and address.

1261
02:06:06,674 --> 02:06:08,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, David McKenna to Vine Street.

1262
02:06:09,456 --> 02:06:10,117
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the,

1263
02:06:11,212 --> 02:06:15,734
[SPEAKER_09]: tone of Mark's comments about letting people to try new ideas.

1264
02:06:15,754 --> 02:06:23,236
[SPEAKER_09]: I think one challenge with special permits and variances is it just increases the cost and uncertainty.

1265
02:06:23,256 --> 02:06:33,160
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, certainly a lawyer who specializes in zoning likes that we have to request these special permits and have hearings and

1266
02:06:34,160 --> 02:06:45,744
[SPEAKER_09]: But it really, it increased the cost and in a city that, you know, in the past has had issues with people with political connections getting special favors, it increases the risk of that as well.

1267
02:06:47,845 --> 02:06:52,667
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I live in East Medford where there are a lot of three story buildings in

1268
02:06:53,790 --> 02:06:54,950
[SPEAKER_09]: residential neighborhoods.

1269
02:06:55,670 --> 02:06:57,031
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a great neighborhood.

1270
02:06:57,051 --> 02:06:58,471
[SPEAKER_09]: I love where I live.

1271
02:06:59,011 --> 02:07:00,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Just give people a third floor.

1272
02:07:01,951 --> 02:07:07,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there are these bump outs that are effectively a third floor, but there's a little bit of angle to the roof.

1273
02:07:07,532 --> 02:07:09,093
[SPEAKER_09]: There's maybe a five degree angle.

1274
02:07:09,133 --> 02:07:13,754
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's maybe it doesn't count as a third floor, but there's so many of them.

1275
02:07:14,174 --> 02:07:15,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Just give people a third floor.

1276
02:07:16,914 --> 02:07:20,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't make them hire a lawyer and get a special permit or whatever it is.

1277
02:07:21,215 --> 02:07:22,075
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be my comment.

1278
02:07:24,452 --> 02:07:24,772
[SPEAKER_10]: David.

1279
02:07:26,393 --> 02:07:26,713
[SPEAKER_10]: William.

1280
02:07:28,954 --> 02:07:29,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi there.

1281
02:07:30,374 --> 02:07:33,976
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm William Navar, 108 Bedford Street, apartment 1B.

1282
02:07:34,636 --> 02:07:48,101
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to sort of express the hope that eventually we can reduce the role of non-conforming in our zoning, the need for it, as in we should have lots of things that conform and very few things that don't.

1283
02:07:48,801 --> 02:07:50,942
[SPEAKER_07]: by updating our zoning to be what we want to see.

1284
02:07:51,422 --> 02:07:56,464
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a lot of times the zoning has painted ourselves into a corner.

1285
02:07:57,064 --> 02:08:02,046
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember attending one of the committee of the hall meetings and the attorney said,

1286
02:08:02,973 --> 02:08:08,475
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we don't want to get rid of these, you know, neighborhood shops because they're a nice amenity.

1287
02:08:08,996 --> 02:08:12,157
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, if they're a nice amenity, they shouldn't be prohibited by the zoning.

1288
02:08:12,757 --> 02:08:18,440
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's the easiest and most logical way to solve the problem.

1289
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,061
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's ultimately what we should do.

1290
02:08:21,121 --> 02:08:32,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Because as the example that Alicia had brought up, it becomes almost like a privilege to own one of these special non-conforming buildings.

1291
02:08:32,688 --> 02:08:33,929
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just seems really silly.

1292
02:08:33,969 --> 02:08:37,793
[SPEAKER_07]: It's almost like if you were to write out, like, what is the value of this property?

1293
02:08:38,634 --> 02:08:45,901
[SPEAKER_07]: The sessor looks at landed buildings, but it's almost like there's a third thing, this like access to a loophole due to nonconformity.

1294
02:08:45,962 --> 02:08:49,365
[SPEAKER_07]: It's almost like a thing of value that you also own bundled with that property.

1295
02:08:49,745 --> 02:08:52,208
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's totally ridiculous, I think.

1296
02:08:52,550 --> 02:08:58,497
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully we can fix that over time as we update our zoning to reflect what Bedford looks like and what it should look like.

1297
02:08:58,777 --> 02:09:09,729
[SPEAKER_07]: And hopefully when we see non-conforming buildings, those are the really ugly ones in the city that we really don't want to see, as opposed to like this beautiful thing everybody wants to buy because we can't build them anymore.

1298
02:09:12,352 --> 02:09:12,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, William.

1299
02:09:14,964 --> 02:09:20,287
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm gonna read Craig Nicholson's comment that he typed into the chat.

1300
02:09:20,687 --> 02:09:23,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Craig Nicholson, 68B Flag Road, Southboro.

1301
02:09:24,329 --> 02:09:25,810
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm an affordable housing developer.

1302
02:09:26,310 --> 02:09:31,953
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't understand the admittedly arbitrary threshold of an increase of 100% of existing floor area.

1303
02:09:32,593 --> 02:09:43,259
[SPEAKER_10]: If the addition still falls within the dimensional requirements of the district, there shouldn't be an issue with its increase from an existing structure versus the construction of a new building that would be by right.

1304
02:09:45,481 --> 02:09:56,069
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, that's more or less consistent with the debate between the two camps in the Supreme Judicial Court when this was all being decided in the 90s.

1305
02:09:56,689 --> 02:10:09,218
[SPEAKER_18]: One camp said, analyze how the structure is non-conforming, and if that specific thing is not changing, then there's no increase in the non-conforming nature of the structure.

1306
02:10:09,999 --> 02:10:13,061
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's a very precise, objective way of looking at it.

1307
02:10:13,241 --> 02:10:14,082
[SPEAKER_18]: That got three votes.

1308
02:10:15,457 --> 02:10:19,300
[SPEAKER_18]: Justice Graney led a camp that said, no, squint at it.

1309
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:25,424
[SPEAKER_18]: And if it's going to look bigger, then it increases the non-conforming nature of the structure.

1310
02:10:25,484 --> 02:10:28,547
[SPEAKER_18]: So his test was very subjective and that got three votes.

1311
02:10:29,167 --> 02:10:30,568
[SPEAKER_18]: This was in an Edgartown case.

1312
02:10:31,649 --> 02:10:40,435
[SPEAKER_18]: Because the Edgartown board had said that they needed a special permit because it increased the non-conforming nature of the structure, that result stood and we were left with no answer.

1313
02:10:40,956 --> 02:10:43,658
[SPEAKER_18]: Then came Bjorklund and Bjorklund

1314
02:10:44,134 --> 02:10:46,735
[SPEAKER_18]: The camps were divided five to two.

1315
02:10:47,875 --> 02:10:51,896
[SPEAKER_18]: Justice Cordy only got one vote this time, and Justice Graney got the other four.

1316
02:10:52,356 --> 02:10:54,636
[SPEAKER_18]: And so the squint test won.

1317
02:10:55,096 --> 02:10:59,877
[SPEAKER_18]: And the squint test is very subjective.

1318
02:11:00,017 --> 02:11:12,680
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it really requires everybody to apply for a special permit, because they want to first squint at it and then decide if it's going to increase the nonconforming nature of the structure, whether to allow it.

1319
02:11:12,700 --> 02:11:13,600
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's a two-part test.

1320
02:11:14,112 --> 02:11:14,793
[SPEAKER_18]: Does it increase?

1321
02:11:15,133 --> 02:11:16,494
[SPEAKER_18]: Should we give it a special permit?

1322
02:11:16,914 --> 02:11:21,378
[SPEAKER_18]: My carve-outs just basically say, if it fits these categories, fine.

1323
02:11:22,078 --> 02:11:30,145
[SPEAKER_18]: The 100% on top of that, it's just my way of expressing my discomfort with the quintupling of the house in the Bjorklund case.

1324
02:11:30,185 --> 02:11:31,966
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no magic number there.

1325
02:11:32,667 --> 02:11:38,772
[SPEAKER_18]: I can tell you that other towns have done this without the number altogether, and I'm not hearing complaints.

1326
02:11:39,453 --> 02:11:41,174
[SPEAKER_18]: I know when it's been a small number,

1327
02:11:41,770 --> 02:11:48,516
[SPEAKER_18]: like 25 or 50%, I think 50% was Winchester's number and they rejected that eventually and amended their bylaw.

1328
02:11:48,916 --> 02:11:50,037
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think they moved it up to 100.

1329
02:11:50,838 --> 02:11:52,460
[SPEAKER_18]: In my hometown here, Concord, it's 100.

1330
02:11:55,142 --> 02:12:06,232
[SPEAKER_18]: Generally because I'm leading the zoning, that tends to win the race, but there's no, any number you want is either, either any number or no number would also work.

1331
02:12:11,689 --> 02:12:15,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions or comments by board members or members of the public before we move on?

1332
02:12:15,330 --> 02:12:21,693
[SPEAKER_11]: I do have some written comments that I could share on this section.

1333
02:12:22,813 --> 02:12:29,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, let me, I just saw a hand raised by William Snyder, so let's do him and then go back to you, Amanda.

1334
02:12:29,856 --> 02:12:32,957
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, I actually think the written comments are from William Snyder, so.

1335
02:12:33,357 --> 02:12:36,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was just gonna ask Amanda to, because of Mark's,

1336
02:12:38,104 --> 02:12:49,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Treatise on a subject to just skip to just the one on 5.5 which has caused some confusion But that's the only one I think is relevant now in mind if you could read that Because I'm on a mobile that would be great.

1337
02:12:49,517 --> 02:12:50,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you sure

1338
02:12:52,569 --> 02:13:11,195
[SPEAKER_11]: So this comment is from William Snyder 87 Warren Street, and it refers to section 5.5 determination by the building commissioners such that proposed reconstruction extension alteration or change does not increase the non conforming nature of said structure by more than 100% gross floor area.

1339
02:13:12,075 --> 02:13:19,217
[SPEAKER_11]: It is confusing because there is no dimensional constraint now on gross floor area so that could not be a measure of additional non conformity.

1340
02:13:20,117 --> 02:13:29,360
[SPEAKER_11]: under general law, chapter 48, section six, any increase in nonconforming nature would still require a section six finding by the ZBA as well.

1341
02:13:30,060 --> 02:13:36,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Many kinds of objectionable intensifications of nonconformity might not affect floor area.

1342
02:13:37,082 --> 02:13:38,742
[SPEAKER_11]: So then are they allowed by right?

1343
02:13:39,163 --> 02:13:47,285
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, can I now replace my nonconforming house with a nonconforming five story building with the same floor area by only a building commissioner

1344
02:13:48,466 --> 02:13:50,027
[SPEAKER_11]: the floor area is less than double.

1345
02:13:51,128 --> 02:13:52,589
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think that is the intent.

1346
02:13:53,210 --> 02:14:09,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Recommend replace the clause with determination by the building commissioner that such proposed reconstruction, extension, alteration or change does not increase the nonconforming nature of said structure and adds not more than 100% to its gross floor area.

1347
02:14:10,504 --> 02:14:10,784
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all.

1348
02:14:16,205 --> 02:14:20,666
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't have an immediate objection or no objection to the language.

1349
02:14:20,706 --> 02:14:22,486
[SPEAKER_18]: It sounds consistent with my intent.

1350
02:14:23,367 --> 02:14:30,968
[SPEAKER_18]: And if somebody could send me those exact words, Amanda, I'm pointing at you, then I'll look at them and thank you for the suggestion.

1351
02:14:34,769 --> 02:14:35,949
[SPEAKER_11]: You should have them.

1352
02:14:36,269 --> 02:14:38,590
[SPEAKER_11]: I sent them over in an email.

1353
02:14:39,110 --> 02:14:40,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me know if you can access them.

1354
02:14:41,232 --> 02:14:44,754
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, it's really valuable to have a second set of eyes on this.

1355
02:14:44,835 --> 02:14:47,456
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I mentioned at the start that this is the black hole.

1356
02:14:47,697 --> 02:14:50,959
[SPEAKER_18]: And recently there was a land court case interpreting my work.

1357
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:54,982
[SPEAKER_18]: And I made changes to the, this is my model.

1358
02:14:55,182 --> 02:15:00,866
[SPEAKER_18]: Obviously it gets tweaked all the time, but I made changes to the basic document based on reading that land court case.

1359
02:15:00,906 --> 02:15:02,227
[SPEAKER_18]: And the land court was right.

1360
02:15:02,267 --> 02:15:03,247
[SPEAKER_18]: I was being confusing.

1361
02:15:03,327 --> 02:15:04,108
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you.

1362
02:15:09,777 --> 02:15:12,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Other questions or comments before moving on to section six?

1363
02:15:16,719 --> 02:15:17,859
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's move on.

1364
02:15:17,879 --> 02:15:22,781
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, that's not it.

1365
02:15:24,201 --> 02:15:31,843
[SPEAKER_18]: Section six deals with general regulations.

1366
02:15:35,039 --> 02:15:39,743
[SPEAKER_18]: So these are the old favorites of parking, loading signs, et cetera.

1367
02:15:41,164 --> 02:15:43,666
[SPEAKER_18]: Didn't change much of the parking.

1368
02:15:45,567 --> 02:15:47,169
[SPEAKER_18]: There's some new ideas in here.

1369
02:15:47,669 --> 02:15:51,192
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's the code that we were talking about when we were looking at the use table.

1370
02:15:51,292 --> 02:15:57,677
[SPEAKER_18]: So this would tell you what the required parking is for the particular use at the end of the line.

1371
02:15:59,258 --> 02:16:04,162
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that we changed, we added a provision on shared parking.

1372
02:16:05,533 --> 02:16:06,314
[SPEAKER_18]: Here it comes.

1373
02:16:07,414 --> 02:16:12,898
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, this is off-premises parking, and we also added a new provision on shared parking.

1374
02:16:13,058 --> 02:16:19,362
[SPEAKER_18]: Off-premises, I believe went from 300 feet to 500 feet measured within street right-of-ways.

1375
02:16:22,584 --> 02:16:26,366
[SPEAKER_18]: Parking size and compact spaces are described.

1376
02:16:26,386 --> 02:16:27,907
[SPEAKER_18]: These are in your existing ordinance.

1377
02:16:28,828 --> 02:16:30,669
[SPEAKER_18]: This is all in your existing ordinance.

1378
02:16:33,342 --> 02:16:56,479
[SPEAKER_18]: These are all in your existing ordinance for general parking and loading requirements There's some off-street loading requirements here as well In your and they aren't the same as they are in the existing ordinance This shared parking provision is new And

1379
02:17:01,515 --> 02:17:04,196
[SPEAKER_18]: I think shared parking is an interesting concept.

1380
02:17:06,758 --> 02:17:08,598
[SPEAKER_18]: I worked with the Dedham Planning Board.

1381
02:17:08,859 --> 02:17:21,284
[SPEAKER_18]: I was their council when legacy place was permitted and I got a real education in this from Walker parking consultants who are nationally eminent.

1382
02:17:22,305 --> 02:17:29,308
[SPEAKER_18]: And the whole methodology of figuring out how to use the same parking lot for multiple uses based on

1383
02:17:29,746 --> 02:17:33,187
[SPEAKER_18]: type of business, time of business, very interesting.

1384
02:17:33,347 --> 02:17:35,748
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is a concept that can reduce asphalt.

1385
02:17:38,288 --> 02:17:44,250
[SPEAKER_18]: And the most important thing I believe in this addition would be 6-1-10 on special permit.

1386
02:17:44,770 --> 02:17:50,192
[SPEAKER_18]: So the parking schedule is quite rigid.

1387
02:17:50,492 --> 02:17:57,474
[SPEAKER_18]: It says if you have, I'm just picking a use, a medical office building, you need one parking space

1388
02:17:57,950 --> 02:18:03,876
[SPEAKER_18]: per, I can't remember the number, it might be 250 feet of gross floor area.

1389
02:18:05,217 --> 02:18:08,921
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's prescriptive and sometimes it's overly prescriptive.

1390
02:18:09,081 --> 02:18:20,413
[SPEAKER_18]: So this would allow somebody who is proposing a use to propose less parking than the table otherwise would suggest.

1391
02:18:21,868 --> 02:18:23,268
[SPEAKER_18]: You could do that by a variance.

1392
02:18:23,869 --> 02:18:26,409
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm required by the tables to build 100 parking spaces.

1393
02:18:26,469 --> 02:18:27,730
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want to build 100 spaces.

1394
02:18:27,770 --> 02:18:30,030
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I can get by on 60.

1395
02:18:30,450 --> 02:18:31,791
[SPEAKER_18]: Can I have a variance to build 60?

1396
02:18:32,411 --> 02:18:33,551
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, the answer is no.

1397
02:18:34,392 --> 02:18:38,753
[SPEAKER_18]: To get a variance, you need soil conditions, shape, or topographical constraints.

1398
02:18:39,453 --> 02:18:43,394
[SPEAKER_18]: You just want a smaller parking lot because your use doesn't need all those parking spaces.

1399
02:18:44,414 --> 02:18:46,855
[SPEAKER_18]: So why not let that go by special permit?

1400
02:18:47,738 --> 02:18:53,061
[SPEAKER_18]: instead of by variance because a special permit is a contest between benefit and detriment.

1401
02:18:53,642 --> 02:18:59,545
[SPEAKER_18]: And it doesn't have the hardship and the special criteria at the beginning of the test.

1402
02:19:00,185 --> 02:19:01,226
[SPEAKER_18]: So this loosens it up.

1403
02:19:01,506 --> 02:19:12,313
[SPEAKER_18]: It makes for possible trades between the city and a business or a business and a business in terms of shared parking and cross easements for parking.

1404
02:19:13,633 --> 02:19:16,215
[SPEAKER_18]: All of that becomes much more practical.

1405
02:19:17,873 --> 02:19:20,634
[SPEAKER_18]: And you'll see the same provision when we get to signs.

1406
02:19:20,834 --> 02:19:22,555
[SPEAKER_18]: I need a bigger sign or more signs.

1407
02:19:22,695 --> 02:19:33,598
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I've been to too many meetings where that is a variance application and somebody is making up facts about how the soil conditions and the shape of the topography need a bigger sign.

1408
02:19:34,779 --> 02:19:36,059
[SPEAKER_18]: Just ask for a special permit.

1409
02:19:36,099 --> 02:19:37,399
[SPEAKER_18]: If it's too big, we'll tell you.

1410
02:19:37,559 --> 02:19:38,940
[SPEAKER_18]: If it's too many, we'll tell you.

1411
02:19:40,360 --> 02:19:42,321
[SPEAKER_18]: And so that's the approach that I would recommend there.

1412
02:19:46,622 --> 02:19:57,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Mark, let's actually stop with the parking and the signs for a moment, because section six has a lot of stuff that the CD board deals with and is interested in.

1413
02:19:57,367 --> 02:20:00,688
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe let's just tackle those two first.

1414
02:20:00,868 --> 02:20:10,032
[SPEAKER_10]: I do want to be clear with the public and our board members that most of this language is not touched.

1415
02:20:10,092 --> 02:20:11,432
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the existing language.

1416
02:20:14,540 --> 02:20:16,583
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, especially science.

1417
02:20:17,344 --> 02:20:24,072
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, the only thing I changed there I think was to add the special permit requirement and to correct the political site for the right.

1418
02:20:24,913 --> 02:20:25,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1419
02:20:25,734 --> 02:20:27,517
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I think some of the.

1420
02:20:32,238 --> 02:20:48,521
[SPEAKER_10]: And some of the rationale for that is that the city is going through the comprehensive planning process, and that there's a desire to kind of look at these issues a little bit more, you know, comprehensively as a result of that.

1421
02:20:49,582 --> 02:20:56,923
[SPEAKER_10]: That doesn't necessarily mean we can't, you know, share recommendations with the city council right now.

1422
02:20:56,943 --> 02:20:59,324
[SPEAKER_10]: And in fact, I do want to put one forward.

1423
02:21:01,598 --> 02:21:09,503
[SPEAKER_10]: but I wanted to just make that clear for why there's not like, you know, the minimum parking hasn't been proposed.

1424
02:21:11,744 --> 02:21:15,147
[SPEAKER_10]: It hasn't been reduced or, you know, proposed to be reduced, so.

1425
02:21:16,097 --> 02:21:20,401
[SPEAKER_10]: That being said, I do want to say I love this the shared parking language I think that's great.

1426
02:21:20,822 --> 02:21:38,259
[SPEAKER_10]: And for anybody who's not familiar, you know, maybe watching this in the public that shared parking simply means let's say you have a bank next to a residential building, the bank only needs their parking from nine to five, the residential building needs some extra parking, you know, overnight.

1427
02:21:39,364 --> 02:21:48,332
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, they work out an arrangement, they write up like an agreement, it's reviewed by the city and approved or not, and then that helps with their parking.

1428
02:21:48,352 --> 02:21:53,557
[SPEAKER_10]: So we don't have, you know, empty parking lots when we need parking, things like that.

1429
02:21:56,820 --> 02:21:57,080
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

1430
02:21:58,621 --> 02:22:00,843
[SPEAKER_18]: And I've seen the special permit work quite well.

1431
02:22:00,863 --> 02:22:05,207
[SPEAKER_18]: When I did New Bedford, the city was given a proposal by Compass Bank, they wanted to put

1432
02:22:06,188 --> 02:22:08,108
[SPEAKER_18]: an office or a headquarters downtown.

1433
02:22:08,168 --> 02:22:16,130
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it required something on the order of, it was hundreds of parking spaces and it's in the middle of New Bedford.

1434
02:22:16,350 --> 02:22:25,732
[SPEAKER_18]: So we drafted something for this occasion and they built the headquarters there because they managed to reduce the parking to make it all work.

1435
02:22:27,032 --> 02:22:28,732
[SPEAKER_18]: And I've seen it used in smaller scales.

1436
02:22:28,812 --> 02:22:32,693
[SPEAKER_18]: I recall using it in Holbrook, right across the town line from Randolph

1437
02:22:33,576 --> 02:22:35,858
[SPEAKER_18]: four bay auto repair facility.

1438
02:22:36,378 --> 02:22:37,999
[SPEAKER_18]: Why do you need 40 spaces for that?

1439
02:22:38,039 --> 02:22:39,080
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what the table said.

1440
02:22:39,140 --> 02:22:42,002
[SPEAKER_18]: They came in, they got a special permit, they cut the parking in half.

1441
02:22:45,605 --> 02:22:45,965
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1442
02:22:45,985 --> 02:22:49,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Board members, anybody want to speak up?

1443
02:22:49,287 --> 02:22:49,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, Jackie.

1444
02:22:50,667 --> 02:22:52,468
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted just to clarify something.

1445
02:22:52,508 --> 02:22:56,830
[SPEAKER_15]: So you said this language is as is.

1446
02:22:57,050 --> 02:23:04,373
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is something that us as a city board body currently have the ability to do within site plan reviews?

1447
02:23:04,913 --> 02:23:06,934
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I didn't think so for parking minimums.

1448
02:23:07,274 --> 02:23:11,215
[SPEAKER_15]: Andre, I missed the whole thing where you were trying to clarify that.

1449
02:23:11,335 --> 02:23:16,818
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm just trying to put it all together because this is something that has sort of plagued us.

1450
02:23:17,910 --> 02:23:22,454
[SPEAKER_15]: During site plan review recently and I'm, I'm liking what I see in the language but I just didn't.

1451
02:23:23,715 --> 02:23:25,096
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't realize that it was as is.

1452
02:23:25,117 --> 02:23:28,039
[SPEAKER_15]: Not all of it.

1453
02:23:28,159 --> 02:23:32,103
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think the science, there's this.

1454
02:23:33,996 --> 02:23:35,857
[SPEAKER_10]: A couple of important changes, right?

1455
02:23:35,877 --> 02:23:40,278
[SPEAKER_10]: So the signs one, we're not really touching or, you know, the city council hasn't touched yet.

1456
02:23:40,318 --> 02:23:55,182
[SPEAKER_10]: They may do that later, except for what attorney Bobrowski pointed out, which was this language around, you know, allowing the ZBA or the CD board to, you know,

1457
02:23:56,794 --> 02:24:14,865
[SPEAKER_10]: approve larger signs or additional signs provided that no substantial detriment shall result to the neighborhood or the city, but that would make it, you know, a more discretionary for the community development board or the special permit granting authority, which in many cases is the city council.

1458
02:24:16,159 --> 02:24:16,880
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's great.

1459
02:24:17,100 --> 02:24:26,266
[SPEAKER_10]: It just creates more flexibility because we don't know, you know, we always run into projects that need some special consideration.

1460
02:24:26,606 --> 02:24:38,754
[SPEAKER_10]: And so this gives, you know, the flexibility to the board and to the special permit granting agency, whoever that is, whether it's the ZBA or the city council to make that adjustment.

1461
02:24:38,994 --> 02:24:40,355
[SPEAKER_10]: And same thing on the parking.

1462
02:24:40,915 --> 02:24:59,522
[SPEAKER_10]: basically says the Special Permit Granting Authority or the Community Development Board may, by special permit or in site plan review, as the case may be, reduce or waive the requirements of this section if specific site or public safety considerations warrant such a reduction or waiver, and no substantial detriment shall result.

1463
02:24:59,582 --> 02:25:05,504
[SPEAKER_10]: So that is something that I think is a terrific change that would help us in our work.

1464
02:25:06,124 --> 02:25:08,205
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, thank you.

1465
02:25:10,733 --> 02:25:28,262
[SPEAKER_17]: And if I may, Andre, to be clear, just because this is something that's very relevant to the City Board, and I've seen this coming up recently with the parking and the special permit, the idea is that if the project needs a special permit from the Zoning Board,

1466
02:25:28,766 --> 02:25:31,467
[SPEAKER_17]: then they would be the one who would grant this special permit.

1467
02:25:31,507 --> 02:25:35,168
[SPEAKER_17]: If it needs variances, if it's going to zoning board, they would grant it.

1468
02:25:35,548 --> 02:25:37,368
[SPEAKER_17]: If it's going to city council, they would grant it.

1469
02:25:37,908 --> 02:25:48,671
[SPEAKER_17]: If it is not going to any of them for any reason, but they would want this waiver, then they would end up with the community development board, or if this body was already the permit granting authority.

1470
02:25:48,691 --> 02:25:57,854
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to be clear that the city board couldn't step in and grant it, and then the project goes to ZBA for other permits.

1471
02:25:58,655 --> 02:26:13,258
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, generally, like our site plan review, a special permit with site plan review has been, you know, we send our recommendations to the ZBA, which actually grants the permit.

1472
02:26:13,918 --> 02:26:18,939
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, this would make it easier for them to do that.

1473
02:26:19,039 --> 02:26:23,760
[SPEAKER_10]: And it would give us, I think, more justification and recommending, you know, less parking.

1474
02:26:26,280 --> 02:26:26,380
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

1475
02:26:27,471 --> 02:26:28,332
[SPEAKER_18]: That was the intent.

1476
02:26:28,352 --> 02:26:34,995
[SPEAKER_18]: You got that exactly right, Alicia.

1477
02:26:35,035 --> 02:26:35,736
[SPEAKER_10]: David McKenna.

1478
02:26:38,918 --> 02:26:40,619
[SPEAKER_09]: David McKenna to Vine Street.

1479
02:26:42,119 --> 02:26:49,464
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that not a lot was changed here and you all would like to include substantive changes at a later date with the comprehensive plan.

1480
02:26:50,144 --> 02:26:51,545
[SPEAKER_09]: I did notice that the two new

1481
02:26:54,008 --> 02:27:11,762
[SPEAKER_09]: retail zoning uses of neighborhood retail and convenience retail, which really describes the development along where I live Salem Street, these old, you know, non conforming walkable neighborhood small businesses that we want to support so not everything is a big box store.

1482
02:27:12,848 --> 02:27:18,469
[SPEAKER_09]: They have these new required parking amounts that would make all of them illegal still.

1483
02:27:18,509 --> 02:27:27,150
[SPEAKER_09]: They're still nonconforming because they don't provide any parking, even though these walkable great institutions that we all use that have stayed in business for over 100 years.

1484
02:27:28,331 --> 02:27:39,693
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I would just encourage that with the creation of these new neighborhood retail and convenience retail to support small businesses that you eliminate the parking requirement.

1485
02:27:40,253 --> 02:27:41,613
[SPEAKER_09]: If they want to provide parking,

1486
02:27:42,632 --> 02:27:54,020
[SPEAKER_09]: They have every incentive to do so, they're allowed to do so, but requiring small businesses to provide parking really limits new development, it hurts our economic development.

1487
02:27:54,780 --> 02:28:00,544
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, and I guess we'll talk about larger changes to parking at a future date.

1488
02:28:04,086 --> 02:28:04,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1489
02:28:06,208 --> 02:28:06,928
[SPEAKER_10]: William Navar.

1490
02:28:09,050 --> 02:28:11,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi there, William Navar, 108 Bedford Street, apartment 1B.

1491
02:28:13,331 --> 02:28:16,113
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wondering, because I didn't find it in the old zoning.

1492
02:28:16,153 --> 02:28:19,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's a little hard to navigate the old zoning.

1493
02:28:19,436 --> 02:28:30,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this parking maximum idea that's in here, is that new as part of the recodification or was that already there and I missed it?

1494
02:28:31,384 --> 02:28:35,628
[SPEAKER_07]: It says you're not supposed to put more than double the required parking in a residential zone.

1495
02:28:36,688 --> 02:28:38,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that is new language.

1496
02:28:38,410 --> 02:28:40,932
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one of the few changes that's in there.

1497
02:28:42,106 --> 02:28:44,287
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I think that's an interesting change.

1498
02:28:44,387 --> 02:28:49,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I appreciate that.

1499
02:28:50,069 --> 02:29:07,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully we can revisit this issue of parking more generally in the future, because I think that at some point there needs to be a philosophical debate on if it's the job of the city to make it easy to find the parking spaces given how hard it is to find a place to live and so on.

1500
02:29:08,717 --> 02:29:08,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

1501
02:29:11,985 --> 02:29:12,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1502
02:29:16,486 --> 02:29:34,891
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, although the city council, you know, has not, you know, addressed this issue, I think, you know, we have at the city board level, we have run into the excessive parking requirements on the projects that we've been reviewing.

1503
02:29:35,131 --> 02:29:40,613
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, you know, I think it would not necessarily

1504
02:29:43,555 --> 02:29:48,401
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, we could send a recommendation, I think, back to the city council and they could take it or leave it.

1505
02:29:48,822 --> 02:29:59,555
[SPEAKER_10]: And one thing that I would point out is that I think that the residential parking requirement is very much a one size fits all.

1506
02:30:00,055 --> 02:30:02,557
[SPEAKER_10]: that doesn't work for Medford's projects.

1507
02:30:02,717 --> 02:30:16,228
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's basically the same parking requirement for a single family home as it is for apartments, whether you're talking about multi-family or single family.

1508
02:30:16,669 --> 02:30:26,817
[SPEAKER_10]: So one idea that I'd like to put on the table would be to create a separate parking requirement for

1509
02:30:27,870 --> 02:30:40,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, for basically leave single family homes as they are, but then create a separate parking requirement that instead of being two vehicles per unit, that would be more like 1.25.

1510
02:30:41,934 --> 02:30:50,877
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm wondering whether what the board would think about sending a recommendation like that along.

1511
02:30:51,217 --> 02:30:52,437
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, City Council could

1512
02:30:53,435 --> 02:30:58,898
[SPEAKER_10]: could take it or leave it, and there will continue to be more conversation, I think, after the comprehensive plan.

1513
02:30:58,938 --> 02:31:10,023
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think in the spirit of limiting the number of special permits and variances that are needed, that this could be a helpful change over the next year.

1514
02:31:11,363 --> 02:31:18,827
[SPEAKER_18]: Very consistent with the whole 40B experience with the actual parking needs of multifamily developments.

1515
02:31:22,650 --> 02:31:24,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Do board members have opinions about that?

1516
02:31:27,252 --> 02:31:32,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead, David, then we'll go to class.

1517
02:31:33,415 --> 02:31:33,715
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1518
02:31:35,716 --> 02:31:37,617
[SPEAKER_19]: It would seem like that would be a step in the right direction.

1519
02:31:37,797 --> 02:31:47,982
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess I have to look at this with clear eyes and think through what you're specifically proposing, but certainly concur with all your observations that

1520
02:31:49,395 --> 02:32:09,187
[SPEAKER_19]: Many of these developments are being required to put in more parking than I think we really want to see so your comments are consistent with what our experience as a board over the last couple of years so in principle supportive of anything in that direction, including your proposal here.

1521
02:32:14,711 --> 02:32:28,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks I basically was about to say the same thing as David I think, you know, I think I've been pretty vocal about the fact that I, I think we're building way too much parking in this city so I would definitely encourage.

1522
02:32:30,160 --> 02:32:40,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking at that I do wonder though, if there are precedents for.

1523
02:32:42,635 --> 02:33:09,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Whether it's, you know, by unit type or by project type or something like that, where parking isn't dictated by the amount of dwelling units, or whether it could be whether it could be done some other way that that's more, you know, more tailored to the to the project itself and the community it's in rather than.

1524
02:33:10,866 --> 02:33:29,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a straight number associated with a dwelling unit like for instance, you know, projects that are to do you know something that's near the orange line or something like that, you know, should have a lot less parking required.

1525
02:33:29,882 --> 02:33:36,628
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's a great topic to, to get more into, as we go forward.

1526
02:33:39,592 --> 02:33:40,092
[SPEAKER_10]: that Jackie.

1527
02:33:41,113 --> 02:33:57,779
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just wanted to echo everything that David and Custard saying, especially I wanted to bring up anywhere where there's T O D or any, um, if it's a walkable area and there's access to multiple modes of, um, other transportation, then obviously you abolish some of these, um, the park requirements.

1528
02:33:58,219 --> 02:33:58,459
[SPEAKER_15]: I am.

1529
02:33:59,200 --> 02:34:06,002
[SPEAKER_15]: So I prefer I am so against these parking minimums, especially where the parking actually has to.

1530
02:34:06,322 --> 02:34:07,183
[SPEAKER_15]: It starts to build

1531
02:34:08,023 --> 02:34:08,964
[SPEAKER_15]: our city, right?

1532
02:34:09,104 --> 02:34:15,787
[SPEAKER_15]: And with it being so car-centric, so anything that we can do to reduce that is always favorable for the community, if you ask.

1533
02:34:15,827 --> 02:34:23,171
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm one of the people that believes that there's a seriously high cost of free parking, as David Shoup has put forth, so.

1534
02:34:23,191 --> 02:34:26,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Jackie.

1535
02:34:26,653 --> 02:34:26,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Deanna.

1536
02:34:28,254 --> 02:34:29,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I generally agree with you.

1537
02:34:29,835 --> 02:34:31,776
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had a question.

1538
02:34:32,056 --> 02:34:35,538
[SPEAKER_01]: So am I reading it correctly that

1539
02:34:36,323 --> 02:34:55,497
[SPEAKER_01]: Like right now, if they don't meet the parking requirement, they need a variance, a developer, but in this, if this new, even if we don't reduce the amount of parking, you know, from two to 1.5, now they could get a special permit through us for the reduced parking.

1540
02:34:56,057 --> 02:34:57,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that, do I get it?

1541
02:34:57,318 --> 02:34:58,439
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I understand it correctly?

1542
02:34:59,059 --> 02:35:02,602
[SPEAKER_18]: The thinking, well, they could get a special, they could get a special permit.

1543
02:35:03,062 --> 02:35:06,004
[SPEAKER_18]: The us is dependent on what the development board.

1544
02:35:06,741 --> 02:35:15,903
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, if the use requires a special permit from the city council, they would ask the city council for the parking reduction special permit too.

1545
02:35:16,343 --> 02:35:18,263
[SPEAKER_18]: One stop shopping, we're trying to make it easier.

1546
02:35:18,923 --> 02:35:27,625
[SPEAKER_18]: If the use is available as of right, and it's subject to site plan review with the CDB, then the CDB would become a special permit granting authority for the parking reduction.

1547
02:35:28,585 --> 02:35:35,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so the process is still being made easier for getting a reduction in parking.

1548
02:35:36,178 --> 02:35:43,483
[SPEAKER_18]: Two ways, one, it's the same board that you need the special permit from, and two, it is a special permit for the parking reduction instead of a variance.

1549
02:35:45,485 --> 02:35:46,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1550
02:35:46,065 --> 02:35:51,689
[SPEAKER_10]: But just to be clear, the city board doesn't handle a lot of special permits.

1551
02:35:53,250 --> 02:35:53,490
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1552
02:35:53,550 --> 02:35:56,432
[SPEAKER_10]: It would stay with like the ZBA or the city council.

1553
02:35:56,712 --> 02:36:04,678
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, but when you look at the use table for the Ys under the CDB's jurisdiction, those would be the cases in which you would be an SPGA

1554
02:36:05,065 --> 02:36:06,246
[SPEAKER_18]: for a parking reduction.

1555
02:36:09,609 --> 02:36:11,510
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, thank you.

1556
02:36:17,796 --> 02:36:31,267
[SPEAKER_10]: So Mark, just to, if the board does decide when we put to compile our recommendations to send along something in this area, would it make sense to do it along the lines of

1557
02:36:33,705 --> 02:36:55,792
[SPEAKER_10]: splitting the A category of parking into like A1, which would stay the same for single family homes, and then maybe make like an A2 that would require 1.25 parking spaces per unit for all or some of the other residential?

1558
02:36:57,872 --> 02:37:00,073
[SPEAKER_18]: Nothing's written in stone in the code

1559
02:37:00,466 --> 02:37:01,607
[SPEAKER_18]: parking code box.

1560
02:37:01,667 --> 02:37:05,931
[SPEAKER_18]: We can just add appropriate letters.

1561
02:37:06,271 --> 02:37:08,493
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't need to use half letters or numbers.

1562
02:37:09,955 --> 02:37:11,456
[SPEAKER_18]: It's easy enough to change at this point.

1563
02:37:21,903 --> 02:37:25,866
[SPEAKER_07]: and I'm very pleased, is going down this route and this conversation.

1564
02:37:26,126 --> 02:37:33,972
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to ask about a slightly different route you might also consider going, and I don't even know if it's legal, so we actually do need Attorney Bobrowski, I think.

1565
02:37:34,933 --> 02:37:44,280
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wondering if, especially since if we're talking about 1.25, and one of the board members mentioned that the issue is the high cost of free parking,

1566
02:37:46,141 --> 02:37:50,665
[SPEAKER_07]: obviously if you have 1.25 parking per unit you gotta decide which unit gets the parking.

1567
02:37:51,645 --> 02:38:07,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Does our current zoning code allow either by special permit or in any configuration to allow the landlord to charge for the parking permits so that people who use a lot of parking in the development pay more rent than the people who use very little parking pay less rent?

1568
02:38:09,279 --> 02:38:13,442
[SPEAKER_07]: And is it possible to allow that either by right by special permit or

1569
02:38:14,423 --> 02:38:15,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Any configuration?

1570
02:38:15,564 --> 02:38:16,345
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1571
02:38:16,405 --> 02:38:21,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, I'd like to explore the idea of charging for parking in these developments.

1572
02:38:23,310 --> 02:38:29,234
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the landlord could do that, but the problem with zoning is that the landlords change.

1573
02:38:29,434 --> 02:38:42,224
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, you'd be able to privatize that kind of an arrangement, but I don't know that you'd be able to make it a public policy document because all landlords are not alike.

1574
02:38:43,287 --> 02:38:50,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, but under the existing zoning, the landlords would be allowed to charge the tenants for the required parking?

1575
02:38:51,557 --> 02:38:51,838
Sure.

1576
02:38:52,699 --> 02:38:53,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, that's good.

1577
02:38:54,241 --> 02:38:54,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1578
02:38:54,581 --> 02:38:55,242
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it.

1579
02:38:55,542 --> 02:38:55,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

1580
02:38:59,247 --> 02:39:00,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Other questions or comments?

1581
02:39:03,474 --> 02:39:05,516
[SPEAKER_10]: So I did say we would stop at nine o'clock.

1582
02:39:05,836 --> 02:39:07,397
[SPEAKER_10]: It's six minutes to nine.

1583
02:39:07,437 --> 02:39:09,218
[SPEAKER_10]: So I want to take- Sorry, Andre.

1584
02:39:10,319 --> 02:39:18,265
[SPEAKER_11]: I have just a couple of written comments submitted from William Snyder, 87 Warren Street, having to do with this part of section six.

1585
02:39:21,608 --> 02:39:31,776
[SPEAKER_11]: So he mentions for 6.1.2 and 6.1.3, I did not see off street parking and loading requirements in the use table.

1586
02:39:33,042 --> 02:39:42,830
[SPEAKER_11]: And then for 6.2.15 exempt signs for number two, where it says official traffic and directional signs, all illumination permitted.

1587
02:39:43,711 --> 02:40:00,505
[SPEAKER_11]: The comment is the previous city solicitor Mark Grumley argued disingenuously during my litigation that this language exempts unofficial directional signs such that they may be on private property and visible to the public and have any size and any illumination.

1588
02:40:01,105 --> 02:40:03,606
[SPEAKER_11]: There is no definition for a directional sign.

1589
02:40:03,886 --> 02:40:09,007
[SPEAKER_11]: It could read no dogs and be a permanent six foot tall neon sign with floodlights.

1590
02:40:09,627 --> 02:40:11,887
[SPEAKER_11]: This is likely not the city council's intent.

1591
02:40:12,467 --> 02:40:21,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Recommend change the language to number two official traffic signs and official directional signs, all illumination permitted for such signs.

1592
02:40:22,910 --> 02:40:23,630
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's everything.

1593
02:40:24,450 --> 02:40:27,531
[SPEAKER_18]: And of course, Amanda, you'll be sending me an email.

1594
02:40:28,751 --> 02:40:29,151
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1595
02:40:31,170 --> 02:40:31,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1596
02:40:31,470 --> 02:40:36,214
[SPEAKER_10]: So what I was gonna say is that we only have five minutes before nine o'clock.

1597
02:40:36,234 --> 02:40:42,318
[SPEAKER_10]: So I wanted to take the temperature of the board, whether you wanted to finish section six.

1598
02:40:42,798 --> 02:40:45,440
[SPEAKER_18]: You'll never finish it.

1599
02:40:47,041 --> 02:40:50,644
[SPEAKER_18]: The performance standard section 6.4 is entirely new.

1600
02:40:50,964 --> 02:40:53,986
[SPEAKER_18]: You might get through landscaping, but you'll never finish 6.4.

1601
02:40:54,446 --> 02:40:59,710
[SPEAKER_18]: And in fact, it's one of the things that I called out every time to the city council and the staff

1602
02:41:00,142 --> 02:41:03,324
[SPEAKER_18]: This is brand new and it's a lot and you really need to pick it apart.

1603
02:41:03,984 --> 02:41:08,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's why it is something of a lot of interest to us and the CD board.

1604
02:41:08,286 --> 02:41:11,608
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's great the direction it's going in.

1605
02:41:13,248 --> 02:41:19,772
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also the housing stuff coming up in future sections that will also take a lot of discussion.

1606
02:41:19,812 --> 02:41:20,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I guess.

1607
02:41:27,188 --> 02:41:41,634
