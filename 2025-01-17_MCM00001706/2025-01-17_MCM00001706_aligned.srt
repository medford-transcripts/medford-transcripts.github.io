1
00:00:01,482 --> 00:00:08,183
This is the city of mid fed license commission meeting, uh, for January 15th, 2025.

2
00:00:08,504 --> 00:00:12,284
And it is 1 0 5 PM.

3
00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:17,345
Can everybody hear me?

4
00:00:17,365 --> 00:00:22,807
I can hear you.

5
00:00:22,827 --> 00:00:23,067
Okay.

6
00:00:43,048 --> 00:00:45,830
Okay, we have an agenda to follow here.

7
00:00:51,474 --> 00:00:57,538
First, we're going to go a little out of order with the agenda because we have a lot of minutes to approve.

8
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,583
I'd like to review and approve those after the meeting as well as

9
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:13,045
I'd like to take the representative from Mary Queen of Peace Parishes for the one-day application.

10
00:01:13,065 --> 00:01:15,287
That's you, okay.

11
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:18,570
Elena.

12
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,551
Hello, thank you so much.

13
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:22,252
You're welcome.

14
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:23,674
How are you today, Elena?

15
00:01:24,214 --> 00:01:25,415
I'm doing wonderful.

16
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:27,236
Excited for the new year.

17
00:01:28,237 --> 00:01:28,437
Good.

18
00:01:29,198 --> 00:01:29,698
Very good.

19
00:01:29,858 --> 00:01:30,379
We all are.

20
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:33,962
Hopefully it'll be just as good, if not better, as the last one.

21
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:35,626
I think so.

22
00:01:35,646 --> 00:01:36,947
I have good feelings about it.

23
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:38,148
Good.

24
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:40,451
Okay.

25
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:44,014
You're here to apply for a one day license.

26
00:01:44,054 --> 00:01:46,697
Would you be able to tell us a little about that, please?

27
00:01:47,402 --> 00:01:47,882
Absolutely.

28
00:01:47,962 --> 00:01:51,065
So this is the same event that we ran last year.

29
00:01:51,085 --> 00:02:00,032
It's, it was, I shouldn't say to my surprise, but to my surprise, very successful speed dating event.

30
00:02:01,353 --> 00:02:12,301
Basically it's rather simple event where people just come together and then they, everyone's in like a circle and then they rotate and they see if they like each other.

31
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:16,184
And then after the speed dating, they get a little,

32
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:24,268
There's like, it's kind of like an open time to just like mix and mingle with a little music and some drinks.

33
00:02:25,328 --> 00:02:27,229
And that's really it.

34
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:28,229
It's pretty simple.

35
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,810
And it's on a Saturday.

36
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,371
It's in the afternoon.

37
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:34,971
So it's not really late, late at night.

38
00:02:35,852 --> 00:02:37,472
And it's been great for us.

39
00:02:37,512 --> 00:02:38,573
So we're doing it again.

40
00:02:38,593 --> 00:02:38,673
Good.

41
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,914
So it worked out pretty good last year for you.

42
00:02:42,394 --> 00:02:44,495
Yeah, we still have some couples dating.

43
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,421
That's terrific.

44
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:47,662
We're pretty thrilled about it.

45
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:50,966
Yeah.

46
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:55,551
It's Father Shen's dream is to like have everyone marry each other from the church.

47
00:02:56,872 --> 00:02:58,434
So it's great.

48
00:02:59,335 --> 00:02:59,655
Awesome.

49
00:03:01,117 --> 00:03:01,397
Okay.

50
00:03:01,797 --> 00:03:05,902
I'm just trying to pull that up here.

51
00:03:06,613 --> 00:03:11,776
And then you'll see on the second page, Emily is one of our members who plans this event.

52
00:03:12,556 --> 00:03:15,037
I just support her with like anything like this.

53
00:03:15,597 --> 00:03:18,079
So the bar will just be placed in front of the kitchen.

54
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:20,780
There's like a commercial kitchen type thing in there.

55
00:03:22,621 --> 00:03:28,244
And so she'll just have one little table where she puts like some beers out or stuff like that.

56
00:03:28,304 --> 00:03:30,925
All right, very good.

57
00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:34,767
And Tammy, we have insurance on file with them.

58
00:03:37,573 --> 00:03:40,496
We are waiting for that COI for that day.

59
00:03:40,516 --> 00:03:41,577
I'm almost positive.

60
00:03:42,978 --> 00:03:44,320
Okay.

61
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:53,128
Father hooked them again this morning, the insurance company that we use, but we should have it by the end of the week.

62
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:54,730
So I'm on top of them about it.

63
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,232
Hopefully we get it right away.

64
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:59,771
We have a finance person left.

65
00:04:00,432 --> 00:04:02,174
So we don't have a finance person right now.

66
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:06,480
So Father Hines is like dueling as also the financial coordinator.

67
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,644
So things were a little slower than usual.

68
00:04:09,664 --> 00:04:10,865
Got you.

69
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:12,167
OK.

70
00:04:14,532 --> 00:04:17,795
I mean, I looked it over, it looks okay to me.

71
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:26,241
There were no issues last year, so my fellow commissioners, if you have any comments or would like to speak about it.

72
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:27,262
No, I agree.

73
00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:29,864
I mean, it's the same event.

74
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:35,308
I really enjoyed the diagram they put right into the second page.

75
00:04:35,368 --> 00:04:37,050
Yeah, I think that was the first.

76
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,410
She's so cute.

77
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:40,001
Yeah.

78
00:04:40,982 --> 00:04:43,084
So that gives us a good idea.

79
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:46,126
And we've seen them on pizza boxes.

80
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:47,727
We've seen them on paper bags.

81
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,889
So that works for me.

82
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:50,709
I couldn't find it.

83
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,391
I was looking everywhere for it.

84
00:04:52,431 --> 00:04:56,033
And then I realized she put it in the document.

85
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:57,034
Funny.

86
00:04:58,515 --> 00:04:59,116
But it's pretty good.

87
00:04:59,596 --> 00:05:00,096
Looks accurate.

88
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:05,032
Mr. Chairman, if you don't mind, I'd like to make a motion to move this off the table.

89
00:05:05,052 --> 00:05:11,497
Yeah, just if you want to include it with receiving the insurance.

90
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:12,839
Sure, sure.

91
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:25,048
Okay, so I motion to accept the one-day license for the event called Speed Dating to be held on February 1st of this year from 3.30 to 10 p.m.

92
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:29,552
conditioned upon receiving the liability insurance binder.

93
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,601
I'll second that.

94
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:33,981
Okay.

95
00:05:34,081 --> 00:05:34,822
All those in favor?

96
00:05:35,282 --> 00:05:35,422
Aye.

97
00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:35,863
Aye.

98
00:05:36,643 --> 00:05:37,384
All those opposed?

99
00:05:38,344 --> 00:05:39,965
Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it.

100
00:05:40,245 --> 00:05:41,967
Your one day license is granted.

101
00:05:43,588 --> 00:05:44,768
Congratulations, Elena.

102
00:05:44,808 --> 00:05:47,790
I hope it's as successful as last year.

103
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:48,971
Me too.

104
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:50,572
Thank you guys so much.

105
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:51,633
Really appreciate it.

106
00:05:52,173 --> 00:05:52,593
Good luck.

107
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:53,094
Take care.

108
00:05:57,538 --> 00:06:00,059
Really, is that wrong?

109
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,940
No, no, that's fine.

110
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,362
I'm good.

111
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:07,363
Okay, next item on the agenda.

112
00:06:16,368 --> 00:06:21,031
Let's see, representative from Arts Collaborative Medford, do we have someone here?

113
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,011
That's me.

114
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:23,392
All right, ready?

115
00:06:23,692 --> 00:06:23,972
Hi.

116
00:06:24,232 --> 00:06:25,233
Say, Regina?

117
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:26,426
That's me.

118
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:32,159
Okay, Regina looks like we have three applications for one day licenses.

119
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:32,840
Yes.

120
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,065
If you'd like to just tell us a little bit about them.

121
00:06:35,914 --> 00:06:36,454
Sure thing.

122
00:06:37,095 --> 00:06:40,336
So we have been doing workshops and different performances in the space.

123
00:06:40,436 --> 00:06:45,018
So the first one is so that we can hold a crafting and cinema night.

124
00:06:45,258 --> 00:06:54,563
So people come in, they'll buy a craft from us, or they'll craft on what they want to, and we might just be able to serve some wine that evening, and we'll watch a fun movie.

125
00:06:54,603 --> 00:06:58,565
That's on February 6th, which is a weekday evening.

126
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,966
Do you want me to go on to the next one, or do you want to talk on one by one?

127
00:07:02,186 --> 00:07:05,388
No, we can do them all together if you like.

128
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,321
So then the next one is a blues jam.

129
00:07:09,882 --> 00:07:11,482
It's something that we're starting up here.

130
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,784
It was something that closed down when the porch closed down.

131
00:07:13,964 --> 00:07:16,845
And so the person who was running it at the porch is now running it here.

132
00:07:16,885 --> 00:07:17,646
It's actually Hendrik.

133
00:07:17,766 --> 00:07:19,567
I have him in the background.

134
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:23,769
And so we just want to, again, be able to have a simple cash bar at that event.

135
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:28,991
And that's very similar to the third one, which is live concerts that Hendrik does.

136
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:31,693
There's a featured performer and it'll just be a simple cash bar.

137
00:07:33,438 --> 00:07:36,479
Okay, and the buyer is going to be in the same place at all three events?

138
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,220
Same place at all three events.

139
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,961
We always do it on one side of our gallery.

140
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:45,583
Okay, and do you have insurance on file with us?

141
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,124
Yes, Daria should have it.

142
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:49,245
Okay.

143
00:07:49,705 --> 00:07:49,925
Yes.

144
00:07:51,326 --> 00:07:51,586
All right.

145
00:07:52,686 --> 00:07:54,927
Daria, you have their insurance on file?

146
00:07:57,148 --> 00:07:57,928
Okay, great.

147
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:00,810
Yeah, I looked over.

148
00:08:02,463 --> 00:08:11,968
The, the 3 applications, my fellow commissioners, if anything that you had noticed or seen on it that you may have question, I noticed that.

149
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:14,930
You applied for all alcohol, which is fine.

150
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,351
You're a nonprofit.

151
00:08:17,491 --> 00:08:19,453
That's not an issue and.

152
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:27,006
Other than the insurance, you know, I'm sure we have it on file where Darius says we did.

153
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,387
It's fine with me.

154
00:08:29,228 --> 00:08:29,928
You guys?

155
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,691
Will it be all alcohol?

156
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:33,972
Or just beer and wine?

157
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:36,895
Honestly, it's probably going to be wine and beer.

158
00:08:38,056 --> 00:08:39,738
I haven't touched other alcohol.

159
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:42,501
Okay.

160
00:08:42,761 --> 00:08:43,662
Darius is curious.

161
00:08:44,363 --> 00:08:44,443
Yeah.

162
00:08:46,115 --> 00:08:50,298
Yeah, and I appreciate the professional design on the 3rd page.

163
00:08:50,338 --> 00:08:51,219
That's very good.

164
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:53,280
You can see how the door is swinging.

165
00:08:53,981 --> 00:08:56,763
What direction then you appreciate that you do.

166
00:08:57,223 --> 00:08:58,064
Thanks.

167
00:08:58,164 --> 00:09:02,748
It's the architectural drawing of our building.

168
00:09:03,368 --> 00:09:04,769
I think you're muted.

169
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,433
So, I don't have the questions.

170
00:09:09,473 --> 00:09:09,953
Yeah, that's fine.

171
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,661
The three of them.

172
00:09:19,803 --> 00:09:22,644
We can lump them all together if you want to do them all at once.

173
00:09:22,684 --> 00:09:24,445
That's fine.

174
00:09:24,985 --> 00:09:43,115
I motion to approve the three one-day license requests to be held on February 6th, February 9th, and February 20th for ACM, the Arts Collaborative in Medford, for their fundraising event.

175
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,642
You want to second that, Ben?

176
00:09:49,344 --> 00:09:50,305
Yeah, I'll second it.

177
00:09:51,486 --> 00:09:51,906
All righty.

178
00:09:53,488 --> 00:09:54,269
We have a second.

179
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:55,630
All those in favor?

180
00:09:56,131 --> 00:09:56,331
Aye.

181
00:09:58,053 --> 00:09:59,174
All those opposed?

182
00:10:01,857 --> 00:10:04,840
Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it.

183
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:05,901
You're all set.

184
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:07,487
Thank you so much.

185
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:08,608
Can I ask one question?

186
00:10:08,648 --> 00:10:14,631
I don't want to take up too much time, but Hendrick actually has his own nonprofit, but it just lives here.

187
00:10:15,112 --> 00:10:24,077
So going forward, is it easier that all of the applications come through me because it's where it's happening, or should some of them, the ones that he's holding, come from him now?

188
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:34,586
Well, it may be advantageous for you to, if you can do it either way is fine, but you're only allowed 30 per year.

189
00:10:34,606 --> 00:10:35,487
Okay.

190
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:49,877
So maybe if you start, you know, splitting them up and things like that, just so you don't go over the 30, you know, it's at your facility, but if he's running the event, you know, either way, it should be fine, you know, as long as there's insurance for it.

191
00:10:50,698 --> 00:10:55,021
If he's going to put it under his name, he'll have to have the insurance and stuff like that as well.

192
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,151
Okay.

193
00:10:56,492 --> 00:10:56,793
Okay.

194
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:57,796
That's, that was my question.

195
00:10:57,836 --> 00:10:58,759
Thank you guys so much.

196
00:10:59,682 --> 00:11:00,043
All right.

197
00:11:00,384 --> 00:11:00,765
Good luck.

198
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,129
Have a great rest of your day.

199
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:03,233
You too.

200
00:12:28,545 --> 00:12:29,646
Should be a little louder now.

201
00:12:33,108 --> 00:12:35,109
Okay, let's see what's next on the agenda.

202
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:38,672
And I took care of that.

203
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:49,339
Okay, we have a representative from El Tacuba presenting for an entertainment license for your establishment on 35 Salem Street in Medford.

204
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:53,081
Alvaro, how are you?

205
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,084
You can take your red thing off mute, Alvaro.

206
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:02,830
There we go.

207
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,651
How are you?

208
00:13:04,671 --> 00:13:04,931
Hi everyone.

209
00:13:06,031 --> 00:13:06,711
Hi, how are you?

210
00:13:07,251 --> 00:13:07,411
Good.

211
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:07,671
Thanks.

212
00:13:09,252 --> 00:13:10,032
Uh, it's good.

213
00:13:10,052 --> 00:13:13,272
Let me get this turned up even more.

214
00:13:13,332 --> 00:13:13,553
Yeah.

215
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:14,373
Okay.

216
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,253
Um, tell us what you're doing Elvaro.

217
00:13:17,373 --> 00:13:20,554
You got an application for a, uh, entertainment license.

218
00:13:22,395 --> 00:13:23,175
What are your plans?

219
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:28,616
Well, it's just for the, um, for the music that we play at the restaurant.

220
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,915
the TVs that they already in place.

221
00:13:32,655 --> 00:13:41,162
And just in case if we ever gonna have maybe a mariachi one night, who knows?

222
00:13:41,182 --> 00:13:44,284
I don't know.

223
00:13:44,304 --> 00:13:44,524
Okay.

224
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:49,988
So it's just a basic entertainment license mostly for the TVs.

225
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:53,871
And it also covers if you want to do a mariachi or...

226
00:13:55,707 --> 00:13:57,709
Sing along or whatever you want to do.

227
00:13:58,149 --> 00:13:59,150
We're going to do it.

228
00:13:59,190 --> 00:13:59,431
Yeah.

229
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:00,852
OK.

230
00:14:01,192 --> 00:14:02,974
Barbara, how many TVs?

231
00:14:03,214 --> 00:14:05,296
It just says TVs at the bottom.

232
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:06,858
There's two TVs in the back.

233
00:14:07,698 --> 00:14:08,039
OK.

234
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:09,680
OK.

235
00:14:10,441 --> 00:14:12,703
And yeah, you can have up to 10 devices.

236
00:14:12,783 --> 00:14:17,408
So you can have a stereo system or whatever as well.

237
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:25,133
It looks like everything's in order as far as all the inspections that had to be signed off.

238
00:14:27,254 --> 00:14:28,595
I don't have an issue with this.

239
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:30,537
Everything looks good to me.

240
00:14:31,077 --> 00:14:36,100
My fellow commissioners, I'm sure you've had a chance to look over the application.

241
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,662
If you'd like to comment.

242
00:14:39,483 --> 00:14:44,526
No, no, I thank them for waiting to get everybody to sign off on this.

243
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:50,794
It's easier to approve it rather than having to make a condition.

244
00:14:50,815 --> 00:14:53,856
We've got to go chase after another inspection.

245
00:14:54,036 --> 00:14:55,397
So I'm good with this.

246
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:57,237
OK.

247
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:58,318
Ben?

248
00:14:58,578 --> 00:14:59,118
Yeah, me too.

249
00:14:59,158 --> 00:15:02,640
It looks like it's been getting it signed off since October.

250
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,581
And yeah, you did all the work.

251
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:08,242
And it sounds fine.

252
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,263
And you're below the threshold anyway.

253
00:15:10,303 --> 00:15:11,684
So no issues at all.

254
00:15:12,264 --> 00:15:13,485
OK, great.

255
00:15:14,165 --> 00:15:16,266
OK, if one of you gentlemen would like to make the motion.

256
00:15:17,987 --> 00:15:20,108
Yeah, I can do it.

257
00:15:20,448 --> 00:15:47,299
Okay, so I'm going to make a motion to approve the application for entertainment license for El Tecuba, Hosina and Tequila Bar, manager on record Alvaro Sandoval, based on the approvals of all of our city departments that were seen in this application.

258
00:15:48,578 --> 00:15:48,878
Very good.

259
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:50,559
Thank you.

260
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:51,640
Alan, would you second it?

261
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,161
Yeah, I'll second that motion.

262
00:15:54,001 --> 00:15:54,301
All right.

263
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:55,242
All those in favor?

264
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:55,822
Aye.

265
00:15:57,063 --> 00:15:57,844
All those opposed?

266
00:15:58,984 --> 00:15:59,865
Hearing and seeing none.

267
00:15:59,885 --> 00:16:00,745
Ayes have it.

268
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:02,226
Motion's been passed.

269
00:16:02,306 --> 00:16:04,067
Alvaro, good luck with your entertainment.

270
00:16:04,788 --> 00:16:05,608
Thank you.

271
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:07,489
That's all.

272
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:09,410
There you go.

273
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:09,851
Okay.

274
00:16:10,431 --> 00:16:10,971
Thank you all.

275
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:12,172
Take care.

276
00:16:16,228 --> 00:16:21,631
Okay, next on the agenda, we have, uh, do we have a representative from ocean state job lot?

277
00:16:22,812 --> 00:16:24,973
No, next month.

278
00:16:25,153 --> 00:16:25,393
Okay.

279
00:16:25,413 --> 00:16:27,234
This has been going on a few months, right?

280
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:27,535
Yeah.

281
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:28,255
Okay.

282
00:16:29,436 --> 00:16:33,218
Um, so do we just table this next till next month?

283
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:34,218
Okay.

284
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:36,560
We don't need to make a motion for that.

285
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:36,840
Do we?

286
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,280
No.

287
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:37,900
Okay.

288
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,322
That was a change in managing, right?

289
00:16:41,723 --> 00:16:41,983
Yeah.

290
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:42,343
Yeah.

291
00:16:42,683 --> 00:16:42,863
Yeah.

292
00:16:42,943 --> 00:16:43,123
No.

293
00:16:43,684 --> 00:16:44,064
Next month.

294
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,080
Okay.

295
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:50,283
And we did Queen Mary already.

296
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,545
All right, and it looks like Main Street Liquors is up next.

297
00:16:55,886 --> 00:16:58,388
Okay, do we have representatives from Main Street Liquors?

298
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:01,750
Okay.

299
00:17:02,511 --> 00:17:09,516
What we're going to do at this point is start the hearing for Main Street Liquors and

300
00:17:13,894 --> 00:17:16,476
Let me back up just a little bit.

301
00:17:19,478 --> 00:17:20,919
Yeah.

302
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:29,484
The public hearing for the Sydney and Medford Liquor License Commission for January 15th, 2025 will come to order.

303
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,212
Time is at 1.23.

304
00:17:45,100 --> 00:18:00,372
Today, January 15th, 2025 at 123 PM, the Medford Liquor License Commission will hold a hearing pursuant to Mass General Law 13823 to discuss the alcoholic beverages license 00021-PK-0680395 Main Street, Medford.

305
00:18:07,392 --> 00:18:13,636
Before I review the procedural matters, I'd like to introduce the members of the Medford License Commission.

306
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,257
My name is Robert Dallifano.

307
00:18:16,118 --> 00:18:18,599
I'm the Chair of the City of Medford License Commission.

308
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:27,425
I'm joined by my fellow commissioners, Alan Moderana, along with Ben O'Sullivan Pierce and License Commission Secretary Daria Tiara.

309
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:34,510
Also present, our Medford Police Officer is Medford Police Officer Smith.

310
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:39,732
who is a sworn agent of the Medford Liquor License Commission.

311
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:46,597
The procedural matters for this hearing are as follows.

312
00:18:48,658 --> 00:18:56,364
The chair will read the January 8th, 2025 hand-delivered notice to appear before this commission for the record.

313
00:18:57,925 --> 00:19:00,587
Next, I will ask who is present.

314
00:19:01,735 --> 00:19:18,342
on behalf of the Medford Police Department, and who is present on behalf of the licensee, and whether there are any other individuals with firsthand knowledge of the alleged to testify, and I will then swear in all parties.

315
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:35,430
The first of the four allegations in the police report will be read into the record by Medford Police, who may also present any evidence pertaining to the alleged violation at that time.

316
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:50,397
Following the Medford Police, the licensee or their representative will have the opportunity to make a brief statement, followed by any other individuals with firsthand knowledge of the alleged to testify.

317
00:19:52,101 --> 00:19:56,224
The commissioners and chair will then have the opportunity to ask questions.

318
00:19:58,505 --> 00:20:06,671
We'll then move on to the second, third, and fourth alleged violations following the same format as the first alleged violations.

319
00:20:08,232 --> 00:20:15,797
All testimony will be limited only to those individuals with firsthand personal knowledge of the alleged incident.

320
00:20:17,464 --> 00:20:27,691
The four separate incidents are all for the sale of alcoholic beverages to persons under 21 years of age, a violation of Mass General Law 138, section 34.

321
00:20:30,574 --> 00:20:33,496
Are there any questions regarding the procedural matters?

322
00:20:33,516 --> 00:20:37,839
Okay.

323
00:20:49,168 --> 00:20:56,571
I'm going to read the January 8th, 2025 hand-delivered notice to appear before this commission for the record.

324
00:20:59,973 --> 00:21:02,654
This is to Main Street Liquors, attention.

325
00:21:03,374 --> 00:21:07,616
Nirmala Devi, manager on record, 395 Main Street, Medford.

330
00:21:49,745 --> 00:22:03,257
The hearing will concern the report submitted to the commission by the Medford Police Department, copies of which are enclosed regarding alleged sales of alcohol to minors.

331
00:22:04,598 --> 00:22:09,803
You may attend this hearing and be presented by counsel at your own expense if you wish.

332
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:23,067
These allegations, if proven, may constitute a violation of Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 138.34, furnishing an alcoholic beverage to a person under 21 years of age.

333
00:22:24,268 --> 00:22:35,018
These allegations, if proven, would constitute grounds for disciplinary action, including a written warning, suspension, or revocation of your license.

334
00:22:36,352 --> 00:22:39,174
If you have any questions, please contact this office.

335
00:22:39,414 --> 00:22:42,776
Sincerely, Robert Dallapano, Liquor License Commission Chairman.

336
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:48,040
This is a document that you folks received.

337
00:22:49,581 --> 00:22:51,522
I just wanted to read it into the record.

338
00:22:58,026 --> 00:23:02,409
Officer Smith, are you presenting on behalf of the Medford Police Department?

339
00:23:03,729 --> 00:23:08,973
Okay, and who is going to be speaking on behalf of?

340
00:23:14,877 --> 00:23:17,439
On behalf of 395 Main Street.

341
00:23:20,341 --> 00:23:22,062
Are all four going to be speaking?

342
00:23:23,323 --> 00:23:26,485
Yes, okay.

343
00:23:29,227 --> 00:23:31,429
Is there anyone else that's going to be speaking?

344
00:23:33,008 --> 00:23:36,410
Do you have a lawyer or clerks or anybody else?

345
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,351
No, okay.

346
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:42,253
Alrighty, all parties please raise your right hand.

347
00:23:45,595 --> 00:23:48,617
You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

348
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:51,719
Very good, thank you.

349
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,482
Officer Smith, would you be able to read the first allegation?

350
00:24:01,365 --> 00:24:02,825
Sure, that's fine.

351
00:24:03,486 --> 00:24:05,647
You could just speak up so everybody could hear.

352
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:14,773
Want me to turn my thing so I can?

353
00:24:14,793 --> 00:24:15,053
Yeah.

354
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:26,180
Let's see if I can get you in a picture here.

355
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,221
Oh, he's already in there.

356
00:24:27,641 --> 00:24:28,302
Oh, he is?

357
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:28,542
Yeah.

358
00:24:28,742 --> 00:24:28,922
Okay.

359
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,191
Yeah, I think it's, oh, okay.

360
00:24:33,211 --> 00:24:33,532
How's that?

361
00:24:33,552 --> 00:24:33,852
Okay.

362
00:25:01,285 --> 00:25:02,126
Go ahead, we'll try it.

363
00:25:03,426 --> 00:25:05,108
For the record, my name is Patrick Smith.

364
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:10,711
I'm a police officer in the city of Memphis, also a liquor agent for the City of Memphis Liquor Licensing Commission.

365
00:25:12,692 --> 00:25:22,839
I wrote a report inside the report that was a juvenile to protect the identity of the juvenile, that juvenile's name, and identifying information will not be provided.

366
00:25:23,219 --> 00:25:28,563
It's on file at my police department, but for legal purposes, I can't release that information because it involves a juvenile.

367
00:25:30,925 --> 00:25:46,655
Let's see, on December 8th, oh, December 9th, 2024, I spoke with Officer Robin Pascantelli of the Medford Police Department in regards to Medford High School students purchasing liquor from Main Street Liquor Mart located at 395 Main Street in Medford.

368
00:25:47,196 --> 00:25:52,019
Should be noted that Officer Pascantelli is a school resource officer assigned to Medford High School.

369
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:58,763
Officer Pascantelli had direct contact with students that informed him Main Street Liquor Mart sold liquor to persons under the age of 21.

370
00:26:00,441 --> 00:26:11,735
I spoke to Lieutenant Lockowitz regarding this matter, spoke to Captain Cabino, and Captain Cabino authorized Port Town to conduct a separate investigation.

371
00:26:12,335 --> 00:26:17,362
Due to scheduling conflicts and implementing weather, my investigation was delayed several weeks.

372
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:26,780
On Friday, January 3rd, 2025, I traveled to Main Street, Lickomah to observe how business was being conducted.

373
00:26:27,081 --> 00:26:28,762
I wore a full Memphis police uniform.

374
00:26:28,842 --> 00:26:30,644
It's the same uniform that I'm wearing in today.

375
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:40,532
I operated an unmarked Memphis police vehicle, and I parked directly next to the MMA studio that is adjacent to Main Street, Lickomah.

376
00:26:42,814 --> 00:26:45,296
I began my observations approximately at 7.45 p.m.

377
00:26:47,728 --> 00:26:49,609
and we'll go into the first allegation.

378
00:26:51,389 --> 00:26:58,672
At approximately 8.10 p.m., an observer would appear to be a young individual entering Main Street Liquor Mart.

379
00:26:59,372 --> 00:27:06,034
Based on the individual's physical characteristics, I believe the individual to be approximately 18 years of age.

380
00:27:06,975 --> 00:27:16,878
Several minutes after entering Main Street Liquor Mart, the individual exited the business carrying an 18-pack of Bud Light Lime and an 8-pack of Neutral Vodka Seltzer.

381
00:27:17,854 --> 00:27:21,296
The individual proceeded to walk south on Main Street towards William Street.

382
00:27:21,316 --> 00:27:26,259
At that time, I drove the unmarked vehicle onto William Street, and I exited the vehicle.

383
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:32,642
I approached this individual and asked them how old they were, and they responded that they were 17 years old.

384
00:27:33,603 --> 00:27:38,946
I recognize this individual from a previous liquor investigation, and know this individual to be 17 years old.

385
00:27:41,764 --> 00:27:50,269
I asked the 17-year-old how he was able to purchase the alcohol, and he informed me that he utilized a fake New Hampshire driver's license.

386
00:27:51,829 --> 00:27:57,192
Upon seeing the New Hampshire driver's license, I determined that it was, in fact, fraudulent.

387
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,174
It was abnormally thick, and the overall quality was poor.

388
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:08,178
This is the same exact fake ID that the person used during that previous investigation.

389
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:23,200
I explained to him, or I explained to the juvenile that I would be seizing the fake ID, and that I would be seizing the alcohol, and that I would be following up with his parents.

390
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:30,981
This is the second time in two months that I've observed this juvenile purchasing the liquor through his fraudulent driver's license.

391
00:28:31,821 --> 00:28:41,623
A criminal complaint was sought against the juvenile in Cambridge Juvenile Court for minorization of alcohol and procuring alcoholic beverages by false representation.

392
00:28:43,467 --> 00:28:51,931
The criminal charge of procuring alcohol beverages by false representation is for the juvenile using a fraudulent prevention driver's license to purchase the alcohol.

393
00:28:52,652 --> 00:29:00,556
If the commission would like to see the ID that the person used, it's the same one that they used back in the day.

394
00:29:01,356 --> 00:29:02,637
So a little follow-up for him.

395
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:08,839
Since then, in the last two weeks, I've gone to everyone else's house twice.

396
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,340
I've met with their parents twice.

397
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,582
I've met with him and explained the ramifications.

398
00:29:14,182 --> 00:29:15,463
We had a good conversation.

399
00:29:15,483 --> 00:29:22,206
I said that the last time in November, but this time there is pending criminal charges in court for this.

400
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:29,772
I told them that the next time it'll be another level.

401
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:34,916
Like I said in the previous meetings, this was the second step for us.

402
00:29:35,516 --> 00:29:41,782
And then Officer Gascantilli was the school resource officer that was made responsible for this specific problem.

403
00:29:42,983 --> 00:29:45,945
So that's the extent of the first application.

404
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:47,766
Okay, great.

405
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:49,228
Thank you.

406
00:29:49,328 --> 00:29:52,190
Do you want me to step back?

407
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,011
Yes, we'll give the

408
00:29:56,735 --> 00:30:01,598
For the folks from Trinidad, I appreciate the opportunity to speak at this time.

409
00:30:06,101 --> 00:30:07,462
Good afternoon.

410
00:30:08,002 --> 00:30:10,824
My name is Satish Kumar.

411
00:30:12,325 --> 00:30:20,130
I was working on the data and the guy came to me and they showed me their IDs, usually like a chip.

412
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,151
I'm not using that chip all the time.

413
00:30:23,212 --> 00:30:23,932
We send them back.

414
00:30:23,952 --> 00:30:26,033
So on that day, unfortunately, I don't have the scanner.

415
00:30:26,053 --> 00:30:28,614
So after that, we actually bought the scanner on the same day.

416
00:30:28,654 --> 00:30:29,235
Now we have it.

417
00:30:29,275 --> 00:30:30,175
Everybody's ID, everything.

418
00:30:30,976 --> 00:30:31,296
Scan it.

419
00:30:50,727 --> 00:30:54,911
But they were standing there, they don't know, so we already spoke to the office, they said like if they

420
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:07,370
try to say some things, you can give it back, just don't keep it, don't create a scene or something.

421
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:13,011
So on that day, the guy, the officer mentioned, he's like 17 or something.

422
00:31:13,391 --> 00:31:24,495
I have a lot of guys that came in the same time, he make me panic, like, oh, I have a way, this and that, this is totally my mistake, I apologize for that, I apologize to the officer too.

423
00:31:24,595 --> 00:31:28,956
When he came, he was like, there was a way to the police,

424
00:31:29,636 --> 00:31:33,539
And they were like showing the IDs to me, they're holding the hands.

425
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:40,165
Same thing at other offices, like you have to hold the ID, you have to check, you have to go through it.

426
00:31:40,405 --> 00:31:45,109
Now when we, the testing scene had happened on that day with me.

427
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:52,315
So those people came in and after that now, like the same thing.

428
00:31:52,675 --> 00:31:56,098
It's not like even the scanner we have it, so we don't know.

429
00:31:56,598 --> 00:32:03,983
You don't do, like, on the scanner, the scanners are like, on the scanner, there's a message right there.

430
00:32:04,184 --> 00:32:06,425
There's another screen, basically.

431
00:32:07,006 --> 00:32:09,828
So when the message is there, you have to face-to-face.

432
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:12,610
You have to see how their eyes are reacting, how they're reacting.

433
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,711
So that's what we do.

434
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:22,237
The incident that happened on that day was like, he, the guy, confused me so much.

435
00:32:22,297 --> 00:32:24,399
I don't know who spoke, but the guy explained a lot.

436
00:32:25,363 --> 00:32:31,788
gentleman was there I tell him like I did a big mistake on that day because like he was panning.

437
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:39,013
I really apologize for that.

438
00:32:39,093 --> 00:32:42,355
It's not personal because I have someone's image so I feel sorry.

439
00:32:47,728 --> 00:32:49,348
Have you ever seen him before?

440
00:32:49,388 --> 00:32:52,949
No, this is the first time I've seen him.

441
00:32:52,969 --> 00:32:55,450
This is the first time this individual ever came?

442
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,750
Yeah, he does trust me.

443
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:57,250
Thank you.

444
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:02,331
And so it's the first time or something in New Hampshire?

445
00:33:02,371 --> 00:33:02,691
License?

446
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:06,132
Yeah, I usually refuse most of them.

447
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:09,253
It's like, I tell them actually I can take them.

448
00:33:10,996 --> 00:33:13,317
And then the new scanner arrived on the 5th and is that installed?

449
00:33:13,337 --> 00:33:14,538
Yeah, it's already published.

450
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:15,919
Here's just one quick second.

451
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:41,044
Yeah, but that's the way he's speaking.

452
00:33:41,224 --> 00:33:42,205
Okay.

453
00:33:43,305 --> 00:33:44,166
Okay.

454
00:33:44,946 --> 00:33:46,046
It'll be all right.

455
00:33:46,106 --> 00:33:46,767
Yeah, it is.

456
00:33:46,947 --> 00:33:47,447
Yeah.

457
00:33:47,907 --> 00:33:48,247
Thank you.

458
00:33:48,407 --> 00:33:49,208
Yeah.

459
00:33:49,268 --> 00:33:49,848
Sorry.

460
00:33:49,888 --> 00:33:51,629
A little technical difficulties here.

461
00:33:58,772 --> 00:34:04,995
Do we have any questions for Mr. Lam on the first alleged

462
00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:07,370
violation.

463
00:34:08,431 --> 00:34:10,313
Just so just so I'm hearing it correctly.

464
00:34:10,373 --> 00:34:14,438
So somebody had one lottery at the same time.

465
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:15,940
Now it's the distracting.

466
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,402
That was the distraction you're talking about.

467
00:34:19,512 --> 00:34:41,228
yeah actually he was he came in before so he gave me the login ticket and the same i have like three four people in the line same time okay so i checked their id just like they pulled out their wallet they just like show me like this i checked the a's everything then and they they was like wearing the booties on the inside

468
00:34:41,768 --> 00:34:47,653
even usually somebody come in, I usually tell them like, please, please take your hoodies off.

469
00:34:47,893 --> 00:34:48,994
This is your inside out.

470
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:49,595
It's okay.

471
00:34:50,275 --> 00:34:58,722
But on that day, he was he gave me the lottery and then he said like, okay, he's like, he would like those things.

472
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,206
Because he bring like a bunch of tickets with him.

473
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:03,627
Okay, but

474
00:35:14,835 --> 00:35:15,195
Okay.

475
00:35:17,275 --> 00:35:17,935
Yeah.

476
00:35:18,155 --> 00:35:19,155
No.

477
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:20,936
Okay.

478
00:35:21,356 --> 00:35:23,876
All righty.

479
00:35:24,796 --> 00:35:29,837
Officer Smith, would you care to read the second alleged violation, please?

480
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,739
So the first violation is the 810.

481
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,919
This is at 8.40 p.m.

482
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,901
Once again, I'm wearing my full uniform.

483
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:52,604
I'm sitting in an unmarked car, again, in front of the next part of the studio, the next floor.

484
00:35:53,905 --> 00:36:00,069
I observe a young male enter Main Street Liquor Mart based on the male's physical characteristics.

485
00:36:00,689 --> 00:36:03,231
I believe him to be approximately 18 years of age.

486
00:36:03,971 --> 00:36:09,375
Several minutes after entering, he exited the business carrying a 12-pack of Poor's Light,

487
00:36:09,995 --> 00:36:16,118
And in that eight pack of sun and pressure iced tea vodka, he then proceeded to walk towards Wareham Street.

488
00:36:16,498 --> 00:36:21,941
I then drove on to Wareham Street, exited my unmarked vehicle, approached him, and I asked him how old he was.

489
00:36:22,701 --> 00:36:25,663
He stated that he was 19 years of age.

490
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:33,647
I asked him how he was able to purchase the alcohol, and he stated he had a fake Massachusetts driver's license, which allowed him to buy the alcohol.

491
00:36:34,307 --> 00:36:35,448
He handed me the fake

492
00:36:36,468 --> 00:36:40,372
the fake ID, I told him the ID will be seized, the alcohol will be seized.

493
00:36:41,213 --> 00:36:46,738
And that body was positively identified as Joseph Mangone.

494
00:36:46,758 --> 00:36:48,840
He is 19 years of age.

495
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:57,688
And due to this being the first offense with me and the liquor agents, he was let off.

496
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,651
I thought we had a positive interaction.

497
00:37:01,884 --> 00:37:06,186
We apologize for the incident.

498
00:37:06,946 --> 00:37:08,607
The commission would like to see his fake ID.

499
00:37:08,647 --> 00:37:11,308
Yeah, it's just an alias.

500
00:37:18,031 --> 00:37:19,111
Thank you.

501
00:37:19,131 --> 00:37:20,772
And let me input.

502
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,238
specifically goes on that idea of wall frames.

503
00:37:34,638 --> 00:37:35,578
Yeah, non-existent.

504
00:37:35,618 --> 00:37:36,499
Yeah, it is non-existent.

505
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:37,019
That's right.

506
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:38,859
It's certainly not the worst I've ever seen.

507
00:37:38,939 --> 00:37:39,899
It's bad.

508
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:40,699
It is bad.

509
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:43,400
But it's certainly not the worst I've seen.

510
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:43,600
Yeah.

511
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:46,281
Yeah, you see, with the real ones, it should be able to fit.

512
00:37:58,978 --> 00:38:02,200
Yeah, the hologram is like, it's dense.

513
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:10,963
Yeah, I kind of agree, not the worst, I mean, but, you look at it, it's bad.

514
00:38:11,203 --> 00:38:14,664
It's bad when you look at it, you have a little one right beside it.

515
00:38:14,724 --> 00:38:15,424
Yeah, that's it.

516
00:38:15,464 --> 00:38:17,045
And then you can't hold these on a regular basis.

517
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:18,786
Yeah, it's just bad.

518
00:38:18,806 --> 00:38:20,966
Right, regular mists.

519
00:38:21,527 --> 00:38:24,928
So as alcohol was seized, it's a lot too thick, I think it was seized.

520
00:38:26,127 --> 00:38:27,448
we had a good possible decision.

521
00:38:27,988 --> 00:38:31,550
Hopefully, we won't have them again.

522
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:31,950
Right.

523
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:32,651
Second violation.

524
00:38:34,092 --> 00:38:35,172
Thank you.

525
00:38:36,173 --> 00:38:41,156
Is there anybody from 395 Main Street that would care to comment on the second violation?

526
00:38:43,473 --> 00:38:48,996
Hi, my name is Chetan Ratan, and I'm replying as Mr. Lekharnam.

527
00:38:49,697 --> 00:38:52,719
What I want to show you is the fighting.

528
00:38:52,879 --> 00:38:56,841
It looks like a real, so we are a little bit confused for that.

529
00:38:57,221 --> 00:39:02,164
Most of the time, me and my brother were there, but on that day, my brother was only there.

530
00:39:02,224 --> 00:39:04,686
So we were a little confused for that.

531
00:39:05,226 --> 00:39:09,408
Raj shows the video like that way, not giving his hand.

532
00:39:09,489 --> 00:39:11,750
So we never saw this kind of fighting.

533
00:39:13,102 --> 00:39:17,406
So we are in this business for almost 14 years.

534
00:39:18,187 --> 00:39:20,169
And we apologize for that mistake.

535
00:39:20,269 --> 00:39:25,453
And now we've got a scanner, so we're going to take my commitment that I'll be single-minded.

536
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:29,377
OK, can I ask you a question?

537
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:31,319
Did you receive the scanner?

538
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:31,919
Yes.

539
00:39:32,299 --> 00:39:33,460
And you have been using it?

540
00:39:33,701 --> 00:39:33,921
Yes.

541
00:39:34,862 --> 00:39:37,024
And has it been pretty accurate?

542
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,305
Are you getting good results?

543
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:52,904
We check like a different way, not like, just to be not stuck on the scanner only, but we also check this personally, like the picture, the match face, eyes, so the site will make sure that they're real.

544
00:39:54,384 --> 00:39:57,985
Okay, and I'd like to ask you another question.

545
00:39:58,005 --> 00:40:00,346
Have the employees been TIP certified?

546
00:40:00,906 --> 00:40:01,146
Yes.

547
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:02,066
They have?

548
00:40:02,186 --> 00:40:02,406
Yes.

549
00:40:03,007 --> 00:40:08,348
Okay, so you know that accepting any type of out-of-state

550
00:40:09,165 --> 00:40:11,586
ID and driver's license is not accepted.

551
00:40:11,626 --> 00:40:12,327
North record.

552
00:40:14,568 --> 00:40:18,050
Because I believe the first one was an out-of-statement.

553
00:40:19,371 --> 00:40:21,952
Okay, I just wanted to ask you that.

554
00:40:22,352 --> 00:40:27,015
Question, did you say he's never seen a license like that?

555
00:40:27,295 --> 00:40:28,776
Is that what you were saying?

556
00:40:28,956 --> 00:40:31,397
Like a message or something?

557
00:40:31,437 --> 00:40:31,657
Yeah.

558
00:40:31,697 --> 00:40:32,678
It looked like a savior.

559
00:40:32,738 --> 00:40:33,919
I never saw this guy in it.

560
00:40:39,918 --> 00:40:49,643
And also show me, let's see, you can see that particular things in the license, the color, and the paper, and the logo inside.

561
00:40:49,683 --> 00:40:52,664
So now we are very careful for that.

562
00:40:52,985 --> 00:40:53,205
Yeah.

563
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:56,686
And you know, when you look at that particular license, it just looks like a problem.

564
00:40:57,367 --> 00:40:58,267
Yes, it's a problem.

565
00:40:58,547 --> 00:41:07,072
Should, you know, they, whoever looked at it, should have, Red Flag should have not seen hundreds and hundreds of the railroads.

566
00:41:07,712 --> 00:41:07,972
Yeah.

567
00:41:09,093 --> 00:41:09,353
Okay.

568
00:41:17,991 --> 00:41:24,175
Gary, you might have to let me back in.

569
00:41:27,557 --> 00:41:36,142
Well, I think what we're all thinking is, it seems unlikely we'd never have seen an ID like that, being a fake Massachusetts ID.

570
00:41:39,326 --> 00:41:47,168
Yes, sir, but like, I do not recognize this kind of body, like, look like, because my brother is holding his hand, because he go like that.

571
00:41:47,788 --> 00:41:52,489
Hopefully, maybe holding hand, then we can see that, but like, you know what I'm saying?

572
00:41:52,529 --> 00:41:54,890
Like, no idea.

573
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,371
Do you wear a tip or not, Nick?

574
00:41:56,591 --> 00:42:00,552
No, from that time, no.

575
00:42:02,452 --> 00:42:05,573
And you're, you know, being TIP certified helps you identify

576
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,303
Yes, in the proper way to check IDs.

577
00:42:14,447 --> 00:42:18,210
And when you talk, what did you say?

578
00:42:19,812 --> 00:42:26,938
I was preoccupied, I didn't notice, I was distracted, I was, what was, why?

579
00:42:27,398 --> 00:42:31,382
As they say, slip by the rule, you might have had a curve.

580
00:42:32,493 --> 00:42:44,197
It's like my brother-in-law is a strategist, so like the lottery guy and the guy, so that's why he doesn't see the idea from the background that I'm more technically late.

581
00:42:44,217 --> 00:42:44,518
Okay.

582
00:42:44,538 --> 00:42:45,938
But we apologize for that.

583
00:42:45,958 --> 00:42:47,339
Yeah, yeah, we understand.

584
00:42:54,509 --> 00:42:56,811
I don't have any other questions, Mr. Chairman.

585
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:58,793
OK.

586
00:42:59,634 --> 00:43:00,034
Very good.

587
00:43:00,074 --> 00:43:00,654
Thank you, sir.

588
00:43:00,715 --> 00:43:01,035
Thank you, sir.

589
00:43:01,395 --> 00:43:09,782
Officer Smith, would you like to read the third alleged violation?

590
00:43:09,802 --> 00:43:13,806
With the commission's permission, I'd like to kind of combine three and four.

591
00:43:14,086 --> 00:43:15,707
The two bodies went in together.

592
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:19,090
I think that's important in the stories that I received from Baltimore.

593
00:43:19,551 --> 00:43:19,731
Yeah.

594
00:43:21,362 --> 00:43:24,486
So that second violation was at 8.40 p.m.

595
00:43:24,867 --> 00:43:34,000
This is now... At that time, I observed two young males in a mainstream lick-a-mat, based on both males' physical characteristics.

596
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:37,044
I believe the males to be approximately 18 years of age.

597
00:43:38,268 --> 00:43:41,051
Several minutes after entering, we had Stanley come out.

598
00:43:41,131 --> 00:43:44,254
One of the males exited the business carrying a 24-pack of blight.

599
00:43:44,834 --> 00:43:46,856
He proceeded to walk towards Wareham Street.

600
00:43:46,876 --> 00:43:49,219
He went, he exited the store by himself.

601
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:52,081
The other person was still up at the counter.

602
00:43:52,382 --> 00:43:57,246
What I didn't want to happen is somebody get in a car, drive away, or, you know, then just split up.

603
00:43:57,486 --> 00:44:00,930
I knew that person was young, so I wanted to make contact with that body first.

604
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:06,152
So I drove on to Wareham Street, I exited the vehicle, approached the man, asked him how old he was.

605
00:44:06,773 --> 00:44:07,993
He told me that he was 20.

606
00:44:08,634 --> 00:44:14,497
He produced a real driver's license that identified him as Nicholas Pascarella.

607
00:44:14,817 --> 00:44:16,018
He is 20 years old.

608
00:44:16,818 --> 00:44:27,083
I asked him, initially I asked him how he was able to purchase the alcohol, and he told me that he used a fake Massachusetts driver's license, which I have right here.

609
00:44:27,103 --> 00:44:28,324
Let me show the connection.

610
00:44:32,605 --> 00:44:36,272
He explained to me that he used that to make the purchase.

611
00:44:43,294 --> 00:44:46,516
So I told him that the alcohol and the fake ID were seized.

612
00:44:46,556 --> 00:44:47,977
This was our first interaction.

613
00:44:48,057 --> 00:44:50,078
So he was let go with a warning.

614
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:52,840
I stood with him in the car.

615
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,901
He anticipated his friend to return.

616
00:44:54,921 --> 00:44:59,464
His friend did not return because he saw me talking to his buddy.

617
00:45:00,585 --> 00:45:01,926
And he crossed the street.

618
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:03,647
So then I looked for him.

619
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:04,947
I went around the corner, saw him.

620
00:45:05,027 --> 00:45:07,389
I motioned that maybe we had a conversation.

621
00:45:09,558 --> 00:45:12,660
He was able to purchase a 12-pack of Pacifica beer.

622
00:45:13,521 --> 00:45:21,366
He admitted to making the purchase, and then he actually hid it in the entryway of 399 Main Street, which is rampant towards Queensland.

623
00:45:21,526 --> 00:45:23,407
He retrieved the alcohol, came back over.

624
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:25,388
I asked him how he was able to make the purchase.

625
00:45:26,049 --> 00:45:27,270
He said that he was never ID'd.

626
00:45:28,188 --> 00:45:33,216
And so I explained to him that there's obviously video cameras inside of Evercool, and so I'm going to be going back in.

627
00:45:33,236 --> 00:45:34,117
I want honesty.

628
00:45:34,758 --> 00:45:36,280
And he goes, oh, no, absolutely not.

629
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,045
I was never an ID to make the purchase.

630
00:45:39,345 --> 00:45:43,331
It was at that time, Mr. Pastorelli, he was the first person to find it, and then I said it was flawed.

631
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:46,070
He goes, oh, I was never caught either.

632
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:48,331
I said, you just gave me a fake ID.

633
00:45:48,351 --> 00:45:51,111
He goes, oh, I have a fake ID, but I didn't use it to make the purchase.

634
00:45:51,952 --> 00:45:53,212
I said, okay.

635
00:45:53,392 --> 00:45:57,353
I go, guys, this video, it's going to be on video whether you used IDs or not.

636
00:45:57,433 --> 00:45:59,173
I'd like to be honest with you.

637
00:45:59,233 --> 00:46:04,014
And both of them were at a no time where they asked for ID and provided ID to make the purchase.

638
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:09,356
So the second problem, one with the Pacific Opia, his name was Liam Creamer.

639
00:46:09,696 --> 00:46:10,976
He is 19 years old.

640
00:46:10,996 --> 00:46:14,177
I was able to possibly ID him with this real ID.

641
00:46:15,386 --> 00:46:20,807
And it was Mr. Kramer's first interaction with the local liquorades and he had no history with them.

642
00:46:21,228 --> 00:46:23,328
So he once again was let off the morning.

643
00:46:23,708 --> 00:46:28,629
They were all seized that Mr. Pasquarello's fake ID was taken.

644
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:31,350
So at that time, I concluded.

645
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:35,051
I said, I've been out there for about an hour and 15 minutes.

646
00:46:35,531 --> 00:46:38,552
I have four people under 21, I'm done going to the store.

647
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:44,895
I'm going to the summary of that, but I just want to be specific on the third or fourth violations.

648
00:46:45,475 --> 00:46:49,238
I was able to review the video of the purchase.

649
00:46:49,258 --> 00:46:51,480
At no time did they produce an IP.

650
00:46:52,221 --> 00:46:59,967
They go up to the counter, they put the beer on the counter, it gets scanned, they take a debit card or a credit card out of their wallet,

651
00:47:00,815 --> 00:47:04,696
They put it in the transact, I don't know which card.

652
00:47:05,056 --> 00:47:08,417
They're able to make the purchase of the credit card, debit card, take the alcohol, they walk out.

653
00:47:08,897 --> 00:47:12,138
No time to make, they produce it.

654
00:47:12,398 --> 00:47:20,581
So Mr. Brown and Mr. President, while we watched the I.D., he explained to me that he observed the same thing that I observed.

655
00:47:20,601 --> 00:47:23,222
I showed it to Mr. Kumar as well.

656
00:47:23,462 --> 00:47:26,343
Mr. Kumar was upset by this.

657
00:47:28,031 --> 00:47:32,055
He explained that he always checks IDs, and this is where the lottery comes in.

658
00:47:32,656 --> 00:47:35,679
So there was a gentleman that was there before, he had a bunch of lottery slips.

659
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:44,208
He did the lottery, he was going through the slips, and then these two kids, they're not kids, but the 21 and 19-year-old were right after him.

660
00:47:45,409 --> 00:47:50,772
So that was the distraction aspect.

661
00:47:50,792 --> 00:47:57,996
He said he was distracted by the person on the lottery slips and he must have forgotten to ask for the purchase.

662
00:47:58,657 --> 00:48:00,818
So that's basically the extent of three and four.

663
00:48:01,958 --> 00:48:03,139
I wanted to combine them as they are.

664
00:48:08,562 --> 00:48:21,878
Before I went to the summary, all that alcohol that was seized, I believe six cases of alcohol, that was brought back to the Bethel Police Station, that was thrown in the trash, and the fake IDs are gonna be destroyed.

665
00:48:22,338 --> 00:48:25,042
That's the conclusion of this area and the criminal area.

666
00:48:26,101 --> 00:48:28,563
I'll go into the summary after.

667
00:48:31,605 --> 00:48:36,589
The lottery thing was actually, when you looked on camera, it was for the two kids at the end.

668
00:48:36,609 --> 00:48:37,270
Two kids at the end.

669
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:38,551
Who didn't produce the IDs.

670
00:48:38,871 --> 00:48:39,151
Correct.

671
00:48:39,211 --> 00:48:42,794
I did not watch the videos for the first two interactions.

672
00:48:42,954 --> 00:48:44,035
Both of them were flat.

673
00:48:44,235 --> 00:48:47,698
They told me we used our fake IDs to make the purchases.

674
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:52,742
I didn't watch the video on that because they were adamant that they used their fake IDs.

675
00:48:53,162 --> 00:48:56,905
I watched it for three and four because it's a question whether the IDs were used or not.

676
00:48:57,486 --> 00:49:00,408
The 20-year-old that I interviewed said, absolutely not.

677
00:49:00,428 --> 00:49:01,349
I was never ID'd.

678
00:49:01,829 --> 00:49:02,630
I went inside.

679
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:04,792
Mr. Kumar said, I have to see everybody.

680
00:49:05,352 --> 00:49:06,513
And we had to speak to him.

681
00:49:06,774 --> 00:49:08,635
So I wanted to see the video for three and four.

682
00:49:09,056 --> 00:49:13,860
And in fact, while viewing it, three and four would never produce an ID.

683
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,641
They walked out and made their purchase.

684
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:16,142
They walked out.

685
00:49:16,743 --> 00:49:16,983
Yeah.

686
00:49:17,383 --> 00:49:17,644
Okay.

687
00:49:18,244 --> 00:49:18,524
All right.

688
00:49:18,624 --> 00:49:20,105
As far as moving to window watch.

689
00:49:20,326 --> 00:49:20,606
Okay.

690
00:49:20,646 --> 00:49:20,946
Yeah.

691
00:49:21,206 --> 00:49:27,871
So if I'm looking at the time to afford fractions from 10 past 8 p.m.

692
00:49:28,051 --> 00:49:28,831
to 9 p.m.

693
00:49:28,871 --> 00:49:29,592
is that sound right?

694
00:49:30,653 --> 00:49:32,354
That's correct.

695
00:49:32,374 --> 00:49:37,617
And I have 810, 840, and then, uh, three and four together.

696
00:49:37,637 --> 00:49:38,858
They're at nine o'clock.

697
00:49:38,998 --> 00:49:40,379
So four, four or 50 minutes.

698
00:49:43,706 --> 00:49:44,226
Okay, great.

699
00:49:44,306 --> 00:49:44,626
Yeah.

700
00:49:45,207 --> 00:49:46,247
Thank you, Officer Smith.

701
00:49:46,287 --> 00:49:47,068
Thank you.

702
00:49:47,308 --> 00:49:48,288
Yeah.

703
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:50,429
Is there a 50-minute distraction?

704
00:49:50,929 --> 00:49:51,650
Yeah.

705
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:52,330
Okay.

706
00:49:53,711 --> 00:50:06,256
Is there someone from 395 Main Street that would like to comment on what Officer Smith has just read on alleged violations three and four?

707
00:50:06,396 --> 00:50:06,777
Yes, sir.

708
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:20,582
I'm just like the officer said, like, we must check the videos for those kids came in.

709
00:50:20,983 --> 00:50:21,243
Yeah.

710
00:50:21,283 --> 00:50:24,086
So as the fake IDs.

711
00:50:24,267 --> 00:50:24,407
Yeah.

712
00:50:25,253 --> 00:50:29,937
That's what I mentioned before, he was like showing his ID, like in the hand stuff.

713
00:50:30,257 --> 00:50:31,958
The first and second one?

714
00:50:32,979 --> 00:50:33,540
The second.

715
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:34,981
The second one.

716
00:50:35,301 --> 00:50:35,481
Yeah.

717
00:50:35,501 --> 00:50:35,762
Okay.

718
00:50:36,042 --> 00:50:39,185
And usually, not usually, I'm sorry.

719
00:50:40,185 --> 00:50:44,549
When officer was with Lieutenant, they went upstairs to check the cameras.

720
00:50:44,649 --> 00:50:44,889
Yes.

721
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:46,151
After that, I have one

722
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:47,779
came in.

723
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:49,460
He had the same mass ID.

724
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,040
We already discussed about it before.

725
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,560
We checked this and that.

726
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,581
He just gave me the ID and I was checking it.

727
00:50:54,601 --> 00:50:55,241
This is a fake.

728
00:50:55,661 --> 00:51:00,642
And I was holding the OSS fake ID and he just snatched it and just ran off.

729
00:51:00,662 --> 00:51:09,344
So I went back to the office and I tell him like it happened again with me, like someone tried to like buy a phone or the same thing.

730
00:51:10,003 --> 00:51:12,304
Yeah, but you didn't settle on any alcohol?

731
00:51:12,504 --> 00:51:18,585
No, after that I just like, as soon as I just, I want to keep the eye on him, even if they were upstairs.

732
00:51:18,805 --> 00:51:19,045
Yeah.

733
00:51:19,065 --> 00:51:21,305
So when I try to show them, he's just like snatching.

734
00:51:21,946 --> 00:51:25,186
Okay, very good.

735
00:51:25,426 --> 00:51:25,806
Thank you.

736
00:51:28,467 --> 00:51:31,788
Is there anyone else that would like to speak?

737
00:51:34,728 --> 00:51:36,569
On anything, on all of four?

738
00:51:38,577 --> 00:51:39,978
alleged violations.

739
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:42,739
Okay, Officer Smith.

740
00:51:42,759 --> 00:51:44,379
I'm sorry.

741
00:51:44,459 --> 00:51:51,302
I could you please state your name and address for the record?

742
00:51:51,622 --> 00:51:54,003
Yeah, my name is Priscilla.

743
00:51:54,103 --> 00:51:54,344
Okay.

744
00:51:54,384 --> 00:51:58,285
Yeah, I'm just like I say, I'm apologizing whatever happened.

745
00:51:58,665 --> 00:52:02,627
I'm like, I have a 17 year old too, so it shouldn't be happening like that.

746
00:52:03,551 --> 00:52:05,672
We have been working with them for 13 years.

747
00:52:05,692 --> 00:52:06,533
It never happened.

748
00:52:06,753 --> 00:52:11,555
We have said we are not selling anything.

749
00:52:11,575 --> 00:52:12,195
I don't know how.

750
00:52:12,716 --> 00:52:14,977
It was a bad luck or whatever.

751
00:52:15,797 --> 00:52:17,798
It's not once, it's three times a day.

752
00:52:17,858 --> 00:52:19,759
I don't know what to say.

753
00:52:19,779 --> 00:52:25,382
We just take precautions.

754
00:52:25,402 --> 00:52:28,323
We bought a safety scanner.

755
00:52:28,704 --> 00:52:31,365
We're still getting those people, but refusing

756
00:52:32,017 --> 00:52:39,899
and rechecking the license, not even like the scanner, it shows like you have to check his eyes, whatever it says, it will fall in the data.

757
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:45,481
It was unflashable.

758
00:52:46,241 --> 00:52:47,121
It is concerning.

759
00:52:47,181 --> 00:52:49,842
I mean, just in 50 minutes, it's four fractions.

760
00:52:49,922 --> 00:52:52,663
I mean, and that's one point in time.

761
00:52:53,896 --> 00:53:02,002
So, you know, you're right, was it just an off day, it went off, or do the kids, these young kids know, let's go here?

762
00:53:02,963 --> 00:53:05,024
They don't even ask for a license.

763
00:53:05,645 --> 00:53:08,066
So, as I said, it is concerning.

764
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:20,215
No, I understand, like, even though, like, two months ago, we got a certificate, I don't know what time, we were just, like, overconfident, you know, getting those tickets or whatever, they started becoming, certainly, I don't know what happened.

765
00:53:22,501 --> 00:53:25,602
yeah, they're targeting your store to come to.

766
00:53:25,662 --> 00:53:40,367
I mean, think about it, you know, I mean, let's just say, yeah, but it's not, I mean, just to speak like, like what everybody else is thinking, here's, I mean, store resource officer says, people, kids are dying.

767
00:53:41,287 --> 00:53:44,028
Officer, you know, he goes out on one random night.

768
00:53:44,908 --> 00:53:46,989
In 15 minutes, he gets three kids.

769
00:53:48,029 --> 00:53:51,090
And then 15 minutes later, another kid, you know, comes in to buy.

770
00:53:51,988 --> 00:53:54,129
I mean, so what do you think it looks like?

771
00:53:54,950 --> 00:54:15,341
You know, you bought the scanner, you're doing the right thing now, but obviously it looks bad and it looks like you guys would just, you'd rather get money, get paid for this and not do it right, not, you know, check ID, not actually be responsible.

772
00:54:15,501 --> 00:54:16,522
So that's what it looks like.

773
00:54:16,562 --> 00:54:20,044
I'm speaking for myself, but that's what it looks like, I'm sure.

774
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:25,055
Anybody watching this feels, most people feel the same way.

775
00:54:28,158 --> 00:54:32,541
I don't know if there's something to say.

776
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:33,842
We understand your story.

777
00:54:34,423 --> 00:54:42,950
You know, that's a little too late right now, only because I agree with my fellow commissioner.

778
00:54:43,624 --> 00:54:54,109
You know, you're in this business to make a living and to make money, but you can't do it at the expense of possibly someone else's life.

779
00:54:54,889 --> 00:55:05,895
These kids could take that alcohol, drive a vehicle, kill not only themselves, but kill innocent parties, innocent families, my family, your family.

780
00:55:06,755 --> 00:55:09,536
You know, then it's too late and it isn't worth the money.

781
00:55:10,637 --> 00:55:12,538
And this commission really

782
00:55:13,155 --> 00:55:15,436
really frowns on this.

783
00:55:15,796 --> 00:55:17,577
I mean, this is serious.

784
00:55:18,617 --> 00:55:22,139
And that's why we're having this hearing.

785
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:25,981
We want to get you outside of it.

786
00:55:26,001 --> 00:55:33,324
You are showing that you did purchase the scanner, which is going to take care of a little bit of this problem.

787
00:55:35,025 --> 00:55:41,187
Obviously, we'll take all of this information under advisement.

788
00:55:42,967 --> 00:55:48,631
after the officer reads the summary, and we'll go from there.

789
00:55:51,813 --> 00:55:53,414
No, I agree.

790
00:55:53,434 --> 00:56:01,580
I mean, just once you start saying no, and you start carding, the word gets out, and that's it.

791
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:06,663
We move on to somewhere else, and we'll take action somewhere else.

792
00:56:08,144 --> 00:56:10,185
But yeah, the chairman's right.

793
00:56:10,225 --> 00:56:12,227
I mean, have these kids,

794
00:56:13,395 --> 00:56:23,800
got away, got into trouble or hurt somebody, killed somebody, they'll come for your corporation and your business.

795
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,081
So not that you don't already know.

796
00:56:28,122 --> 00:56:28,703
Thank you.

797
00:56:28,763 --> 00:56:32,204
Thank you, Nancy, for saying we will take it under advisement.

798
00:56:33,385 --> 00:56:33,725
Thank you.

799
00:56:36,266 --> 00:56:39,368
Is there anyone else that would like to speak?

800
00:56:40,462 --> 00:56:57,195
on behalf of the school at the lake and we will give you an opportunity to speak as well after the officer reads the summary of the report and officer smith would you like to read the summary

801
00:57:00,532 --> 00:57:18,366
Just to go back to what Mr. Kumar said, while we were watching the video on the third and fourth violations, myself and Mr. Bradley, Mr. Kumar didn't come upstairs and explain to me that another person under 21 came in with a fake ID to make a purchase and that sale was denied while I was upstairs watching the video.

802
00:57:18,386 --> 00:57:19,447
So, sorry.

803
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:29,519
So after we have these violations, it's been, like you said, four violations or four people under 21 in 50 minutes.

804
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:32,143
I said, I have to do something about this.

805
00:57:32,203 --> 00:57:33,224
I'm going into the store.

806
00:57:33,585 --> 00:57:35,147
We've got to address this immediately.

807
00:57:39,763 --> 00:57:42,806
Yeah, I mean, basically, you can summarize it, too, if you like.

808
00:57:42,846 --> 00:57:43,087
Sure.

809
00:57:43,227 --> 00:57:44,789
I'll give you the summary of it.

810
00:57:44,949 --> 00:57:45,509
That's for you.

811
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:49,314
So after I'm brain-forgone, I head to the store.

812
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:50,775
Mr. Kumar is present.

813
00:57:50,896 --> 00:57:52,497
He's right by the counter.

814
00:57:53,058 --> 00:57:57,583
I identified myself and gave him a full summary of what I had just watched.

815
00:58:00,259 --> 00:58:04,021
Mr. Kumar was very apologetic to my findings.

816
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:11,104
He explained to me that he always asked for an ID, and that he wasn't aware.

817
00:58:11,164 --> 00:58:17,388
I showed him the fake IDs, and he apologized.

818
00:58:17,408 --> 00:58:19,909
I asked him who the manager was, I mean, who the owner was.

819
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:24,111
He told me the owner of the business was Mr. Paul Ratner.

820
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:36,871
So I'm out there having a conversation with Mr. Kumar, and a second employee comes over to me from the back row, and that probably identifies himself as Mr. Paul Ratton.

821
00:58:37,851 --> 00:58:40,272
And so I asked him if he was the owner, and he told me no.

822
00:58:41,292 --> 00:58:49,454
So after some back and forth, I found out that Mr. Kumar and Mr. Ratton are brother and wife, and that their wives are actually the owners of the business.

823
00:58:50,174 --> 00:58:55,175
So I explained to them that I needed to speak to the owner and reschedule the meeting.

824
00:58:56,146 --> 00:58:58,547
I also gave a full summary to Mr. Rad.

825
00:58:58,727 --> 00:59:00,468
I explained everything that I observed.

826
00:59:00,548 --> 00:59:01,669
I showed them my IDs.

827
00:59:02,229 --> 00:59:07,832
We pulled out our own mass IDs and looked at them and everybody agreed that they were all fake.

828
00:59:08,513 --> 00:59:14,376
So Mr. Pasquarello, Mr. Rad, even though Mr. Pasquarello never used his ID, Mr. Mangone's ID was a fake.

829
00:59:16,097 --> 00:59:17,578
That time Mr. Rad brought me upstairs.

830
00:59:17,618 --> 00:59:21,060
We looked at the video, sort of bring it forward.

831
00:59:23,879 --> 00:59:25,940
certified on the property.

832
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,682
So I scheduled a meeting for the next day, and I returned on the 4th.

833
00:59:33,162 --> 00:59:34,102
I met with Ms.

834
00:59:34,122 --> 00:59:37,703
Debbie, and sorry, I forget your name.

835
00:59:37,743 --> 00:59:42,105
I apologize, I have it here.

836
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:42,265
Ms.

837
00:59:42,305 --> 00:59:43,805
Latta, Mr. Rat, Mr. Pumak.

838
00:59:44,406 --> 00:59:45,606
We all met the following day.

839
00:59:45,626 --> 00:59:51,368
I explained the full investigation, what transpired the night prior.

840
00:59:52,154 --> 00:59:57,176
I learned that as long as they have children that are just under 20 mile, they were very upset by the findings.

841
00:59:58,797 --> 01:00:05,100
I learned that there was no scanner or no way to verify the IDs on property at the time, and that they had ordered a scanner.

842
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:07,424
and that it was due to arrive the following day.

843
01:00:07,444 --> 01:00:10,846
I thought our overall conversation was positive.

844
01:00:11,746 --> 01:00:16,829
They were upset by my findings, and they expressed great concern, and they wanted to do better.

845
01:00:17,369 --> 01:00:18,449
And I thought that was a great step.

846
01:00:18,529 --> 01:00:23,672
I didn't recommend buying a scanner, but they went out and did that before I even arrived the following day.

847
01:00:23,692 --> 01:00:25,833
I thought that was positive.

848
01:00:27,234 --> 01:00:31,516
When I brought the notice to appear, I actually saw the scanner in action.

849
01:00:31,536 --> 01:00:33,657
It was somebody who was younger in age that came in.

850
01:00:34,311 --> 01:00:43,396
I observed, I was another employee, I observed him, I asked for ID, he looked at the ID, put it in the scanner, came back, and a sale was made.

851
01:00:43,416 --> 01:00:46,638
So I was very happy to see that the scanner was in place and working.

852
01:00:46,678 --> 01:00:50,120
I believe I went on the 8th to serve that notice.

853
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:56,703
So by the 8th, up and operational, and I observed it, it was working at that time.

854
01:01:00,103 --> 01:01:06,069
Essentially, the summary, I didn't pass on my report to Officer Pascotillo, who's the school resource officer.

855
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:09,993
He has been an asset for almost for this commission.

856
01:01:10,453 --> 01:01:12,215
He told us about the previous one.

857
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:16,239
This is direct knowledge coming from high school students at Bethel High School.

858
01:01:16,279 --> 01:01:17,440
He's becoming aware of it.

859
01:01:18,381 --> 01:01:23,626
He's now telling me, and then I show up on a random night and observe business being conducted.

860
01:01:26,698 --> 01:01:29,961
That night in particular, these are obvious to me.

861
01:01:30,241 --> 01:01:34,364
I deal with these people on the 21 all the time, so I know what a person on the 21 looks like.

862
01:01:34,965 --> 01:01:36,306
That night, I didn't approach anybody else.

863
01:01:37,307 --> 01:01:39,468
They were obvious to me that they were on the 21.

864
01:01:39,508 --> 01:01:42,751
Same with the last investigation.

865
01:01:42,931 --> 01:01:44,812
These are obvious to me.

866
01:01:44,832 --> 01:01:45,533
They look young.

867
01:01:45,733 --> 01:01:46,474
They're not private.

868
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:47,995
They're wearing sweatpants, sweatshirts.

869
01:01:48,035 --> 01:01:50,076
They've got their lanyards hanging out of their pockets.

870
01:01:50,597 --> 01:01:53,119
These do not look like, they don't have beards.

871
01:01:53,199 --> 01:01:53,839
They're not older.

872
01:01:55,271 --> 01:02:00,893
They look like kids, and I refer to them as kids even though they're 18, 19, 20, 16, 17.

873
01:02:03,874 --> 01:02:05,814
That's essentially my summary.

874
01:02:06,655 --> 01:02:06,955
Thank you.

875
01:02:07,195 --> 01:02:09,515
Well, great job with this, Officer Smith.

876
01:02:09,575 --> 01:02:12,396
I appreciate the work and the authenticity of this.

877
01:02:13,137 --> 01:02:13,437
Thank you.

878
01:02:13,797 --> 01:02:16,538
Great.

879
01:02:16,878 --> 01:02:18,438
Anybody from 395 Mansfield, are you here?

880
01:02:18,518 --> 01:02:19,118
I'm still here.

881
01:02:25,086 --> 01:02:27,467
What happened to the store, that's so bad.

882
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:30,408
And we apologize for that.

883
01:02:30,808 --> 01:02:33,449
And we are in this business for 14 years.

884
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:40,111
And the city sends so many times to check us and for the inspection, to sell the underage.

885
01:02:40,511 --> 01:02:41,452
And we never fail.

886
01:02:41,472 --> 01:02:42,412
You check your records.

887
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:46,053
And we have a kid, 21, like 20 years old.

888
01:02:46,213 --> 01:02:48,414
We know how bad it is to sell the underage people.

889
01:02:49,405 --> 01:02:53,808
And I know that every day, three teens die from drinking and driving.

890
01:02:54,289 --> 01:02:55,170
I know these things.

891
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:58,252
So how is it possible we sell these things?

892
01:02:58,372 --> 01:02:59,133
What purpose?

893
01:02:59,793 --> 01:03:01,034
We formalized all that.

894
01:03:01,074 --> 01:03:07,939
This is a mistake, but we will be next time very careful to check every single point of the ID.

895
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:16,227
Most of the time, me and my brother were there, so we know that auto check the ID, so it will never happen again.

896
01:03:16,767 --> 01:03:24,249
We apologize for that, so please give us a break this time, and we will now give you a copy for regarding the address.

897
01:03:25,849 --> 01:03:28,690
And we will now accept the auto state IDs.

898
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:32,851
Right.

899
01:03:33,091 --> 01:03:35,291
Were you TIP certified?

900
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:35,651
Yes.

901
01:03:35,671 --> 01:03:37,052
That's something you should know.

902
01:03:37,152 --> 01:03:37,392
Yes.

903
01:03:39,505 --> 01:03:43,528
You know, it's, it's, there's no excuse for it.

904
01:03:44,308 --> 01:03:57,076
And, you know, it's kind of right now when this seemed to be a little bit out of control, especially where it was going around in high school, that that was the place to buy.

905
01:03:59,017 --> 01:04:03,300
You know, it's, it's, it's telling us that this has been going on for a little while.

906
01:04:04,681 --> 01:04:08,363
And you're saying that this,

907
01:04:08,898 --> 01:04:10,840
you'll assure us this will never happen again.

908
01:04:12,061 --> 01:04:13,582
I'm giving you warning today.

909
01:04:13,943 --> 01:04:25,914
If it does happen again, and you come before this commission, you've got a chance of us revoking your license permanently.

910
01:04:27,776 --> 01:04:29,037
So keep that in mind.

911
01:04:29,057 --> 01:04:30,859
That's the most severe penalty.

912
01:04:35,654 --> 01:04:46,598
And so that's just something to keep in mind, and something for all your employees to keep in mind, because as you know, liquor license in the city is worth a lot of money for a liquor store.

913
01:04:47,398 --> 01:04:57,561
And if your license gets revoked, that's not only going to cost you your business, it's going to cost you, and you've got to sell that license to your mom and yourself.

914
01:04:58,501 --> 01:05:02,923
So this is very, very important, and it's such a strong

915
01:05:04,891 --> 01:05:09,894
that we're giving you because it's such an important thing.

916
01:05:09,934 --> 01:05:16,778
You know, I served on the fire department for 30-some odd years, and I've seen what Alcoa does.

917
01:05:18,059 --> 01:05:21,081
It's impressive, as well as Officer Smith.

918
01:05:21,841 --> 01:05:22,922
And it's not a pretty sight.

919
01:05:24,143 --> 01:05:30,947
And, you know, you just... This is why we just try to keep the handle on this.

920
01:05:31,487 --> 01:05:32,648
We find it very serious.

921
01:05:33,598 --> 01:05:39,685
And I felt as though I had to give you a full warning just for it.

922
01:05:39,945 --> 01:05:43,489
So there won't be a next time.

923
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:44,831
I understand, sir.

924
01:05:44,871 --> 01:05:49,516
You seem very remorseful, which we take into consideration as well.

925
01:05:49,756 --> 01:05:50,137
Thank you, sir.

926
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:56,461
We're going to discuss this.

927
01:05:56,741 --> 01:05:57,161
Oh, yeah.

928
01:05:57,301 --> 01:05:58,062
Oh, yeah.

929
01:05:58,202 --> 01:05:58,462
Yeah.

930
01:05:58,502 --> 01:06:04,306
We're going to discuss this before any kind of a wanting disorder, anything.

931
01:06:05,247 --> 01:06:06,368
We're going to talk about this.

932
01:06:07,188 --> 01:06:12,092
Because there's some stuff in here that I'm wrestling with.

933
01:06:12,552 --> 01:06:14,153
So, OK.

934
01:06:14,694 --> 01:06:15,714
Yeah.

935
01:06:15,814 --> 01:06:22,799
Yeah, I think just so it's more clear, what I'm saying is that it could be your business.

936
01:06:25,622 --> 01:06:28,204
But that doesn't mean that there's no consequence for this time.

937
01:06:28,805 --> 01:06:32,768
So just saying no, that doesn't mean that there's not any consequence.

938
01:06:32,868 --> 01:06:39,413
That's something we need to deliberate about for that, just so there's no, like it's not unclear.

939
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:39,794
Yeah.

940
01:06:40,034 --> 01:06:48,621
Ken, do you want to kind of explain what happens from this point forward?

941
01:06:49,982 --> 01:06:51,863
Yeah.

942
01:06:51,983 --> 01:06:54,906
Everybody that's here today that was one

943
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,021
Is everybody all set?

944
01:06:57,201 --> 01:07:03,504
Anybody else wanna speak?

945
01:07:03,624 --> 01:07:19,212
Okay, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to recommend that this commission takes this matter under advisement and you'll be notified with that decision.

946
01:07:20,433 --> 01:07:24,255
What we do with this point is the three commission is only

947
01:07:25,323 --> 01:07:26,604
meet privately.

948
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:31,447
We discuss all of our notes that we took here today.

949
01:07:31,908 --> 01:07:33,329
We have the police report.

950
01:07:33,729 --> 01:07:35,010
We have your testimony.

951
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:39,733
And we take it all into consideration.

952
01:07:40,353 --> 01:07:48,138
And we will decide what, if any, penalties were to be.

953
01:07:51,323 --> 01:07:56,987
What I'd like to do is have you folks back at our next monthly meeting.

954
01:07:57,007 --> 01:08:18,422
You'll know before then on what our outcome was in this and we plan to just discuss it with you and make sure that you understand everything that we put in into the decision on what the

955
01:08:19,794 --> 01:08:22,296
what, if any, the punishment is going to be.

956
01:08:24,918 --> 01:08:30,002
So I make a motion for this commission to take this matter for advisement.

957
01:08:30,883 --> 01:08:33,445
If one of you folks would like to second it.

958
01:08:35,607 --> 01:08:36,087
Yeah.

959
01:08:36,488 --> 01:08:38,029
All right.

960
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:39,370
Motion's been made.

961
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:41,792
The matter is going to be taken under advisement.

962
01:08:41,932 --> 01:08:42,853
All those in favor?

963
01:08:43,173 --> 01:08:43,534
Aye.

964
01:08:44,254 --> 01:08:45,155
All those opposed?

965
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:48,818
Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it.

966
01:08:49,997 --> 01:08:51,097
We'll let you folks know.

967
01:08:51,497 --> 01:08:51,838
Thank you.

968
01:08:51,918 --> 01:08:52,418
Thank you.

969
01:08:52,438 --> 01:08:53,618
Thank you for coming together.

970
01:08:58,499 --> 01:09:05,061
Okay, we can get back to the regular business of the monthly meeting at this point.

971
01:09:05,801 --> 01:09:08,402
Officer Smith, you're all set to go if you want.

972
01:09:08,422 --> 01:09:10,102
I mean, you're all welcome to hang out.

973
01:09:10,482 --> 01:09:11,123
Thank you.

974
01:09:11,143 --> 01:09:12,343
Thanks.

975
01:09:12,583 --> 01:09:13,243
Thank you, everyone.

976
01:09:13,523 --> 01:09:13,783
Thanks.

977
01:09:13,843 --> 01:09:14,103
Is that Ms.

978
01:09:14,123 --> 01:09:14,383
Dingman?

979
01:09:31,296 --> 01:09:33,859
We're looking at the next item on the end.

980
01:09:33,979 --> 01:09:34,379
Yeah.

981
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:35,981
And then we get around.

982
01:09:36,842 --> 01:09:38,083
All right.

983
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:41,007
I put this thing to stop talking.

984
01:09:41,587 --> 01:09:42,428
I put a lot of new.

985
01:10:14,862 --> 01:10:15,122
Okay.

986
01:10:15,142 --> 01:10:16,803
Let's see if that works.

987
01:10:18,364 --> 01:10:18,644
That works.

988
01:10:18,684 --> 01:10:20,425
I'm looking back for mine, but that's just.

989
01:10:20,885 --> 01:10:21,485
Okay, cool.

990
01:10:22,406 --> 01:10:22,686
Yeah.

991
01:10:22,706 --> 01:10:24,047
I couldn't, I couldn't shut it off.

992
01:10:24,367 --> 01:10:25,207
Yeah.

993
01:10:25,267 --> 01:10:27,869
I even muted it.

994
01:10:27,909 --> 01:10:29,309
Finally, I just closed the lid.

995
01:10:29,329 --> 01:10:30,390
Yeah, no, it made sense.

996
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:31,650
But anyways.

997
01:10:31,731 --> 01:10:32,111
Okay.

998
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:36,453
So we have minutes from July 12th to November 26th.

999
01:10:36,473 --> 01:10:37,734
Is that what I'm saying?

1000
01:10:38,014 --> 01:10:38,374
Yes.

1001
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:40,975
Or am I messing something up?

1002
01:10:41,916 --> 01:10:42,176
Okay.

1003
01:10:43,124 --> 01:10:45,466
Yeah, you got seven months, I think, right?

1004
01:10:45,786 --> 01:10:46,087
Seven.

1005
01:10:46,267 --> 01:10:46,587
Okay.

1006
01:10:46,787 --> 01:10:47,548
I was, uh, eight.

1007
01:10:47,908 --> 01:10:53,353
I was trying to stitch together all the, uh, Terry, you were killing it.

1008
01:10:53,393 --> 01:10:58,137
I mean, you would just like multiple times in the same model.

1009
01:10:58,197 --> 01:10:58,457
Yeah.

1010
01:10:58,497 --> 01:10:58,557
Yes.

1011
01:10:58,577 --> 01:11:01,639
Two meetings in November.

1012
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:07,324
So I can click file out of this for October.

1013
01:11:14,572 --> 01:11:24,621
Okay, let me just clean this up a little bit so I can get to them.

1014
01:11:26,623 --> 01:11:29,386
Last minute, put them over here.

1015
01:11:43,958 --> 01:11:49,101
Yeah, that's what 1218 is.

1016
01:11:49,161 --> 01:11:53,683
Yeah, 717, 821, 10-1, 10-16, 10-23, 10-20, and 11-26.

Yeah.

1018
01:11:55,484 --> 01:11:55,764
OK.

1019
01:11:57,045 --> 01:11:58,786
Have you guys had a chance to read them all?

1020
01:12:00,126 --> 01:12:00,306
Yes.

1021
01:12:00,346 --> 01:12:02,127
We took a blast from the past.

1022
01:12:02,387 --> 01:12:02,648
I know.

1023
01:12:02,828 --> 01:12:03,108
Yeah.

1024
01:12:03,468 --> 01:12:04,669

1025
01:12:05,169 --> 01:12:06,770
I spent some time last night.

1026
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:11,432
Daria, you picked up a couple of corrections that

1027
01:12:15,050 --> 01:12:18,033
I don't know where my Zoom screen went, but here it is.

1028
01:12:18,193 --> 01:12:18,534
I got it.

1029
01:12:19,935 --> 01:12:22,658
You picked up a couple of corrections, which were great.

1030
01:12:23,479 --> 01:12:27,223
You fixed those, and I mean, it all looked good to me.

1031
01:12:30,139 --> 01:12:37,504
You were really killing it this past week, trying to get these all done, as well as your annual reports and everything else.

1032
01:12:37,584 --> 01:12:41,647
So I commend you for all the work you've done.

1033
01:12:41,787 --> 01:12:42,267

Correct.

01:14:49,935 --> 01:14:57,296
So I motion to approve the minutes from October 23, 2024 to December 18th, 2024.

1068
01:14:57,716 --> 01:14:58,296
Okay.

1069
01:14:58,456 --> 01:15:01,357
All those in favor.

1070
01:15:02,217 --> 01:15:02,777
Oh, I'm sorry.

1071
01:15:02,797 --> 01:15:03,677
Somebody's got a second.

1072
01:15:04,197 --> 01:15:04,777
I'll second it.

1073
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:05,538
And second.

1074
01:15:05,678 --> 01:15:06,478
All those in favor.

1075
01:15:06,558 --> 01:15:06,698
Aye.

1076
01:15:07,358 --> 01:15:07,438
Aye.

1077
01:15:09,193 --> 01:15:11,894
uh, all those posts here and it's being none.

1078
01:15:11,914 --> 01:15:12,994
Yeah, I have it.

1079
01:15:13,855 --> 01:15:14,715
Motion carries.

1080
01:15:15,575 --> 01:15:17,016
Uh, quick, quick, actually.

1081
01:15:17,036 --> 01:15:17,676
Sorry.

1082
01:15:18,076 --> 01:15:18,356
Sorry.

1083
01:15:18,416 --> 01:15:22,157
Quick edit is that I was present at those last two.

1084
01:15:23,498 --> 01:15:23,798
Okay.

1085
01:15:23,898 --> 01:15:26,178
But my name is not on the present list there.

1086
01:15:26,198 --> 01:15:28,539
The 23rd and the 20th.

1087
01:15:32,730 --> 01:15:33,971
You mean October 23rd?

1088
01:15:34,031 --> 01:15:38,793
Yeah, sorry, October 23rd, and then November 20th, the last two.

1089
01:15:41,674 --> 01:15:42,635
It just doesn't happen.

1090
01:15:42,675 --> 01:15:44,876
I think it might've been a carryover from the one before.

1091
01:15:44,936 --> 01:15:49,658
I'm pretty sure.

1092
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:51,499
Let's see.

1093
01:15:52,419 --> 01:15:53,140
Yeah, you're right, Ben.

1094
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:54,520
Yeah.

1095
01:15:55,421 --> 01:15:57,542
I looked at the minutes, but I didn't look at the people.

1096
01:16:01,185 --> 01:16:01,645
That's fine.

1097
01:16:01,665 --> 01:16:03,366
Is that at least let me know.

1098
01:16:03,546 --> 01:16:03,906
Okay.

1099
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:04,446
That's good.

1100
01:16:04,486 --> 01:16:06,266
One of them is my birthday and I was away.

1101
01:16:06,286 --> 01:16:07,186
I remembered that one.

1102
01:16:07,267 --> 01:16:09,027
Oh, you go somewhere else.

1103
01:16:09,187 --> 01:16:10,747
All right.

1104
01:16:11,147 --> 01:16:12,568
Yeah, that's good.

1105
01:16:13,048 --> 01:16:15,568
Um, I'll take it up.

1106
01:16:15,769 --> 01:16:17,369
I see people jumping on.

1107
01:16:17,609 --> 01:16:17,949
Yeah.

1108
01:16:18,269 --> 01:16:21,390
But yeah, that's a great.

1109
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:22,930
We forgive you.

1110
01:16:22,970 --> 01:16:23,870
But November 26 in there.

1111
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:26,491
So I think, uh,

1112
01:16:31,150 --> 01:16:34,011
You've seconded that motion and that's good.

1113
01:16:34,392 --> 01:16:34,752
Yeah.

1114
01:16:35,092 --> 01:16:37,673
Well, I did and we're just going to make that edit.

1115
01:16:37,793 --> 01:16:38,033
Yeah.

1116
01:16:38,153 --> 01:16:38,413
Okay.

1117
01:16:38,433 --> 01:16:39,114
Correct.

1118
01:16:39,134 --> 01:16:40,274
And then we're good to go.

1119
01:16:40,374 --> 01:16:40,554
Yeah.

1120
01:16:40,714 --> 01:16:40,975
Good.

1121
01:16:41,775 --> 01:16:44,256
So we don't have to make an informal motion, right?

1122
01:16:44,276 --> 01:16:45,136
I don't think so.

1123
01:16:45,196 --> 01:16:45,757
No.

1124
01:16:45,997 --> 01:16:47,257
Just a correction.

1125
01:16:47,457 --> 01:16:48,778
I made it and I just mentioned it.

1126
01:16:48,838 --> 01:16:49,618
So cool.

1127
01:16:50,219 --> 01:16:50,679
That works.

1128
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:51,299
Yeah.

1129
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:53,160
Alrighty.

1130
01:16:54,861 --> 01:16:55,781
What else do we have?

1131
01:16:55,881 --> 01:16:56,722
We have the,

1132
01:16:59,349 --> 01:17:04,332
Commission discuss and approve the annual we all start with the past minutes area.

1133
01:17:05,033 --> 01:17:05,893
That's all of them, right?

1134
01:17:06,934 --> 01:17:07,294
Okay.

1135
01:17:08,215 --> 01:17:12,218
Now, the commission will discuss and approve the annual report for the calendar year.

1136
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:14,279
24 that is sent to the.

1137
01:17:16,937 --> 01:17:18,618
We received that, I believe, today.

1138
01:17:18,638 --> 01:17:20,240
Yes.

1139
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:21,901
Yeah, this looks good.

1140
01:17:22,742 --> 01:17:32,211
As you said, it's for the fiscal year, July 1st through July 1st, and we didn't have any violations in that period.

1141
01:17:32,271 --> 01:17:32,592
Right.

1142
01:17:33,072 --> 01:17:34,914
So we're going to have some in the next one.

1143
01:17:36,335 --> 01:17:38,917
which next year we can deal with.

1144
01:17:38,937 --> 01:17:39,617
That's fine.

1145
01:17:40,377 --> 01:17:42,819
And yeah, I mean everything looks fine.

1146
01:17:43,119 --> 01:17:43,439
Yeah.

1147
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:48,622
The licenses, are you in the process of printing them?

1148
01:17:48,702 --> 01:17:52,004
Are you waiting for them to come back from the ABCC?

1149
01:17:54,065 --> 01:17:55,426
What do you mean, like the physical license?

1150
01:17:55,686 --> 01:17:55,927
Yeah.

1151
01:17:56,467 --> 01:17:58,128
Some of them have been picked up.

1152
01:17:58,603 --> 01:17:59,844
Okay, so you've already got it.

1153
01:18:00,184 --> 01:18:00,645
Yeah.

1154
01:18:00,665 --> 01:18:00,945
Okay.

1155
01:18:01,925 --> 01:18:02,726
And.

1156
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:05,188
Okay, so that takes care of that.

1157
01:18:05,608 --> 01:18:09,251
Um, yeah, I, I don't have an issue with the, this report.

1158
01:18:11,887 --> 01:18:18,569
if one of you guys want to make, if that's good with you guys, you want to make a motion to accept it and approve it?

1159
01:18:18,769 --> 01:18:36,774
Yeah, yeah, no, I'll make a motion to approve the 2024 annual report that details the events that occurred in that fiscal year, because you're, Jerry, you're right, the last couple of refractions now are in the new fiscal year.

1160
01:18:37,594 --> 01:18:44,077
So notwithstanding the two infractions.

1161
01:18:45,237 --> 01:18:45,958
I'll second.

1162
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:46,678
I'll second.

1163
01:18:49,239 --> 01:18:50,800
One second before we second.

1164
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:54,401
What was the compliance checks?

1165
01:18:54,461 --> 01:18:56,162
That was in June, wasn't it?

1166
01:18:57,454 --> 01:19:00,657
So the meeting was in July in July.

1167
01:19:00,797 --> 01:19:01,117
Okay.

1168
01:19:01,377 --> 01:19:01,617
Okay.

1169
01:19:01,678 --> 01:19:02,038
I'm sorry.

1170
01:19:02,058 --> 01:19:02,498
I thought.

1171
01:19:02,538 --> 01:19:02,638
Okay.

1172
01:19:02,678 --> 01:19:03,079
So Ben, yeah.

1173
01:19:03,099 --> 01:19:03,259
Okay.

1174
01:19:03,279 --> 01:19:04,220
Uh, so Ben, but okay.

1175
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,040
I, uh, you said, I second this.

1176
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:05,180
Okay.

1177
01:19:05,341 --> 01:19:07,242
Um, all those in favor.

Aye.

1249
01:19:24,216 --> 01:19:24,276
Aye.

1250
01:19:24,296 --> 01:19:24,437
Aye.

1251
01:19:24,457 --> 01:19:24,617
Aye.

1252
01:19:24,637 --> 01:19:24,697
Aye.

1253
01:19:24,717 --> 01:19:24,837
Aye.

1254
01:19:24,857 --> 01:19:24,937
Aye.

1255
01:19:24,957 --> 01:19:25,057
Aye.

1256
01:19:25,077 --> 01:19:25,217
Aye.

1257
01:19:25,237 --> 01:19:25,417
Aye.

1258
01:19:25,437 --> 01:19:25,497
Aye.

1259
01:19:25,517 --> 01:19:25,618
Aye.

1260
01:19:25,638 --> 01:19:25,778
Aye.

1261
01:19:25,798 --> 01:19:25,878
Aye

1262
01:19:29,079 --> 01:19:31,601
And see if we missed anything on the agenda.

1263
01:19:31,921 --> 01:19:33,282
We've approved all the minutes.

1264
01:19:35,723 --> 01:19:36,584
I think we got it all.

1265
01:19:36,624 --> 01:19:39,205
I made a couple of notes.

1266
01:19:41,306 --> 01:19:42,307
The establishment.

1267
01:19:43,287 --> 01:19:44,968
I just want, I want to thank you.

1268
01:19:45,008 --> 01:19:47,190
You did a nice job on that.

1269
01:19:47,230 --> 01:19:49,331
I mean, you were superstar trying to get that through.

1270
01:19:49,391 --> 01:19:55,154
I think that was record time that anything went through the ABCC.

1271
01:19:55,434 --> 01:19:55,875
I mean, you.

1272
01:19:59,192 --> 01:20:03,033
You stayed on top of it, it was like within eight or nine days.

1273
01:20:03,693 --> 01:20:05,273
Can you clarify that?

1274
01:20:05,293 --> 01:20:07,534
It had to run out from the porch, is that what it was?

1275
01:20:07,714 --> 01:20:12,415
Yes, because the porch never surrendered the license.

1276
01:20:12,495 --> 01:20:15,636
If they don't surrender it- Right, for it to expire.

1277
01:20:15,916 --> 01:20:16,536
Yeah.

1278
01:20:16,556 --> 01:20:20,797
We got to wait to December 31st, but with the commission already approved it,

1279
01:20:21,977 --> 01:20:29,578
And the ABCC initially approved it with the inspection, with the exception of the license hadn't been surrendered.

1280
01:20:30,559 --> 01:20:34,399
Daria pushed this through the ABCC on a priority.

1281
01:20:34,979 --> 01:20:43,141
And, you know, as soon as it happened, they got it, they approved it, and he's got his license now, which is great.

1282
01:20:43,501 --> 01:20:45,761
Yeah, she did a great job with it.

1283
01:20:47,141 --> 01:20:49,542
He can open it now, right?

1284
01:20:50,042 --> 01:20:50,902
Yeah, he's good to go.

1285
01:20:53,352 --> 01:20:56,578
Yeah, yeah, so he's all good to go, which is awesome.

1286
01:20:57,700 --> 01:21:02,148
I saw something too about gab hours that you shot me a couple of emails.

1287
01:21:02,248 --> 01:21:03,450
Did they call?

1288
01:21:03,470 --> 01:21:04,893
Were they concerned?

1289
01:21:08,252 --> 01:21:10,153
Cause I think they kind of might've dropped the ball.

1290
01:21:10,253 --> 01:21:12,475
I was away the month that he came in.

1291
01:21:12,495 --> 01:21:14,656
I think that was in October.

1292
01:21:15,617 --> 01:21:19,699
And, uh, I don't know what went on, but what's that?

1293
01:21:20,339 --> 01:21:27,684
They wanted it to be 24, seven license never had the house because they didn't open during the whole season.

1294
01:21:27,764 --> 01:21:30,826
They opened like later.

1295
01:21:31,206 --> 01:21:31,386
Yeah.

1296
01:21:34,895 --> 01:21:37,536
We had the license, but no hours on it.

1297
01:21:38,137 --> 01:21:40,138
So I think that's what made me look.

1298
01:21:40,158 --> 01:21:46,081
I was looking at my spreadsheet, and for some reason, saw I'm missing, there was a whole issue with that.

1299
01:21:46,481 --> 01:21:47,562
So I had to fix it.

1300
01:21:47,702 --> 01:21:51,024
But then I was like, I don't know if Gab actually ever told us their hours.

1301
01:21:51,404 --> 01:21:52,785
So that's what made me think.

1302
01:21:52,985 --> 01:21:54,165
So I checked with the city clerk.

1303
01:21:54,206 --> 01:21:58,048
I'm like, did they ever apply for a coming week until 1 AM?

1304
01:21:58,448 --> 01:21:59,668
So he said, no.

1305
01:21:59,909 --> 01:22:02,430
But I'm like, I couldn't remember exactly.

1306
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:04,191
Because for some reason, I feel like they did.

1307
01:22:04,578 --> 01:22:06,560
But if you tell me no, then that means no.

1308
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:10,943
But that's when I started to think about the whole square footage and all that stuff.

1309
01:22:10,983 --> 01:22:11,124
Yeah.

1310
01:22:11,164 --> 01:22:12,705
Because there was a lot on it.

1311
01:22:12,725 --> 01:22:12,965
Yeah.

1312
01:22:13,145 --> 01:22:15,307
Technically, that's not.

1313
01:22:15,607 --> 01:22:25,536
But I want to, before I go to the next columnist, I want to make sure that all the information is correct.

1314
01:22:26,852 --> 01:22:30,275
Okay, does does their license say they're open to one?

1315
01:22:30,616 --> 01:22:40,745
Because they, when they open, just in October, when they have the license, but you just never have the hours.

1316
01:22:41,006 --> 01:22:45,770
Yeah, but what does the common Vic say?

1317
01:22:46,311 --> 01:22:47,612
Then they can't be open to one.

1318
01:22:47,732 --> 01:22:49,994
I think they,

1319
01:22:54,565 --> 01:22:59,988
But didn't they come and they wanted to open at 8 a.m.

1320
01:23:00,028 --> 01:23:01,428
or something and we went to 11?

1321
01:23:01,568 --> 01:23:03,610
We started with 11.

1322
01:23:04,430 --> 01:23:07,151
That was assumed that their closing time was already established.

1323
01:23:07,171 --> 01:23:08,172
I say that's the problem.

1324
01:23:08,192 --> 01:23:10,273
The ACC application doesn't last for hours.

1325
01:23:21,379 --> 01:23:30,406
So because of the whole issue for 1AM that we figured out last year because of the coming big, I never paid attention to it until we started this issue.

1326
01:23:30,426 --> 01:23:32,568
So that occurred in my head and I was like, wait.

1327
01:23:33,208 --> 01:23:37,792
But whenever they don't have coming big, it started that they really shouldn't be turning to 1AM.

1328
01:23:37,832 --> 01:23:42,456
But they might not even know that because this all happened after they got their license.

1329
01:23:42,596 --> 01:23:45,018
They wouldn't have even talked about it.

1330
01:23:45,238 --> 01:23:46,919
You know what I mean?

1331
01:23:47,179 --> 01:23:48,440
They played catch up.

1332
01:23:52,135 --> 01:23:59,803
Well, if they want to legitimately be open until one, do they need City Council approval, or do they just need our approval?

1333
01:23:59,923 --> 01:24:01,564
Yeah, they need to go to Council.

1334
01:24:02,530 --> 01:24:05,253
Yes, COVID is only until 11 p.m.

1335
01:24:05,493 --> 01:24:06,014
Right, right.

1336
01:24:06,234 --> 01:24:13,321
So unless, like Snappy Patty's did last month, we approved them for 1 a.m.

1337
01:24:13,822 --> 01:24:14,482
for some reason.

1338
01:24:14,522 --> 01:24:17,305
They only wanted it on Thursday, Friday, Saturday or something.

1339
01:24:17,325 --> 01:24:19,067
I mean, you got to do it to it.

1340
01:24:19,447 --> 01:24:20,148
Just 1 a.m.

1341
01:24:20,869 --> 01:24:21,269
You can go 2 a.m.

1342
01:24:23,015 --> 01:24:23,355
2 a.m.

1343
01:24:23,415 --> 01:24:24,676
is our limit.

1344
01:24:25,356 --> 01:24:27,677
If the city will allow it, that's 2 a.m.

1345
01:24:27,737 --> 01:24:28,037
is it?

1346
01:24:28,297 --> 01:24:28,478
Yeah.

1347
01:24:28,878 --> 01:24:37,582
So, I mean, you know, if they want to do 1 a.m., they feel as though that's enough, then, you know what, just apply for it.

1348
01:24:37,662 --> 01:24:48,767
But I think what we should do is have Mr. Brian Zatha, we ought to notify him to see what his CarmenVic hours are.

1349
01:24:49,847 --> 01:24:50,948
And if they're not till 1 a.m.,

1350
01:24:53,115 --> 01:24:55,357
Yeah, which I think will be easier to track.

1351
01:24:55,657 --> 01:24:57,079
He's pretty reasonable.

1352
01:24:57,159 --> 01:24:59,501
I'm not going to tell him to shut down.

1353
01:24:59,541 --> 01:25:01,683
Let's get him on track.

1354
01:25:01,823 --> 01:25:04,625
They have to be open for food the whole time?

1355
01:25:04,645 --> 01:25:05,766
They didn't get an exception?

1356
01:25:18,842 --> 01:25:29,108
The only way is an exception is a general, I think it's called the general section 12 license, which Chevalier has, and they do not have to serve food.

1357
01:25:36,252 --> 01:25:37,713
I don't think Brian has a general.

1358
01:25:37,733 --> 01:25:39,474
I can't.

1359
01:25:47,739 --> 01:25:50,079
I think that's what he's labeled as.

1360
01:25:51,225 --> 01:25:54,707
off on-premise restaurant, right?

1361
01:25:55,487 --> 01:25:59,889
Which is the same as a regular section 12 in the city.

1362
01:26:00,289 --> 01:26:09,514
You know, I mean, if he was under the impression that those were his hours and they're not on a common VIC, I think we should discuss it with him.

1363
01:26:10,734 --> 01:26:16,837
And like you say, Alan, we're not gonna tell him to start closing at 11 o'clock, but let's give him a time.

1364
01:26:17,597 --> 01:26:18,238
Let's give him 90 days.

1365
01:26:20,072 --> 01:26:34,282
To make sure that the proper paperwork is filled out at the city clerk's office, because the city clerk told me personally that 1, when we were looking for Bocelli's and stuff for to be open to 1 am for New Year's.

1366
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:36,561
He says, they got to come here.

1367
01:26:37,081 --> 01:26:38,963
Then they got to have a ties in the paper.

1368
01:26:39,203 --> 01:26:40,644
That takes so many weeks.

1369
01:26:40,864 --> 01:26:42,625
Then they got to go before the city council.

1370
01:26:42,665 --> 01:26:44,326
And it says it's just for one night.

1371
01:26:44,887 --> 01:26:47,008
He says, it's the same for changing the hours.

1372
01:26:47,048 --> 01:26:47,689
That's what it is.

1373
01:26:48,049 --> 01:26:48,949
So he says, okay.

1374
01:26:49,690 --> 01:26:53,312
So if they got to do all of that, let's put a time limit.

1375
01:26:53,433 --> 01:27:03,279
You got 90 days and by such and such, if it's not done and approved by the city council, you can only stay open until 11 o'clock.

1376
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:03,620
Yeah.

1377
01:27:05,035 --> 01:27:05,775
I think it's fair.

1378
01:27:06,976 --> 01:27:14,779
It's technically, I don't think, I don't know if we can even do this because it's out of our jurisdiction.

1379
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:17,240
Our jurisdiction is 2 a.m.

1380
01:27:18,561 --> 01:27:24,924
with the city clerk's approval and the city council's approval.

1381
01:27:25,244 --> 01:27:27,945
So, I mean, they've been doing it.

1382
01:27:29,085 --> 01:27:32,107
Let's just, and there's been no trouble.

1383
01:27:33,048 --> 01:27:38,550
So let's just continue what we've done with this process in the works.

1384
01:27:39,751 --> 01:27:42,932
We'll give them 90 days and see if they can pull it off.

1385
01:27:42,992 --> 01:27:44,232
If that sounds fair to you guys.

1386
01:27:44,272 --> 01:27:44,533
Sure.

1387
01:27:44,613 --> 01:27:46,333
What if they can't get it done in 90 days?

1388
01:27:46,353 --> 01:27:48,294
Cause that sounds like a process that could take longer.

1389
01:27:48,354 --> 01:27:55,577
And also the city, they need to have availability to meet with them, right?

1390
01:27:55,617 --> 01:27:56,917
The city councilor.

1391
01:27:57,418 --> 01:27:58,138
They just have to,

1392
01:28:00,568 --> 01:28:01,008
Yeah.

1393
01:28:01,608 --> 01:28:01,929
Yeah.

1394
01:28:02,009 --> 01:28:02,409
Okay.

1395
01:28:02,649 --> 01:28:14,614
If he talks on it, like if I talk to him and I tell him, like, right, do this as soon as possible, like start it this week, they will, they will help him as much as they can and it should be done within a month.

1396
01:28:14,634 --> 01:28:14,734
Okay.

1397
01:28:14,754 --> 01:28:14,914
Okay.

1398
01:28:14,974 --> 01:28:16,315
And council meets every month?

1399
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:17,175
Maybe.

1400
01:28:17,275 --> 01:28:18,256
Or every other month?

1401
01:28:18,596 --> 01:28:19,616
Twice a month, I believe.

1402
01:28:19,716 --> 01:28:20,297
Twice a month.

1403
01:28:20,377 --> 01:28:20,617
Okay.

1404
01:28:20,657 --> 01:28:20,937
Yeah.

1405
01:28:21,197 --> 01:28:22,678
Well, then that's more than enough.

1406
01:28:22,718 --> 01:28:25,239
And the 90 day, yeah, in three months should be, should work.

1407
01:28:25,419 --> 01:28:25,739
Right.

1408
01:28:25,879 --> 01:28:27,820
But they, they have to do the, um,

1409
01:28:30,622 --> 01:28:34,848
Advertising and I'm not sure if they have to mail the residents.

1410
01:28:34,968 --> 01:28:36,390
I have to look into it, but.

1411
01:28:39,357 --> 01:28:43,018
Yeah, yeah, there's really no direct about us.

1412
01:28:43,038 --> 01:28:44,398
I think it's the same thing.

1413
01:28:44,458 --> 01:28:45,539
I was like, we're.

1414
01:28:46,519 --> 01:28:48,179
We're opening a business, right?

1415
01:28:48,499 --> 01:28:52,140
But that's stuff for the city clerk and the council.

1416
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:53,661
It's nothing to do with us.

1417
01:28:53,981 --> 01:28:58,262
No, the only thing we do is just get right.

1418
01:28:58,362 --> 01:29:02,423
Once we see that comment, Vic, which brings me to the next.

1419
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:18,075
thing I just wanted to run it by you guys maybe we could do like a quarterly newsletter out to the licensees something like now it'll be a winter newsletter happy new year blah blah blah

1420
01:29:20,043 --> 01:29:27,911
We're going to be having a few different, I don't know, we'll put it in certain words, but we're going to have changes this year.

1421
01:29:27,931 --> 01:29:34,657
This year's license renewal must include a copy of your common vigilance license.

1422
01:29:36,002 --> 01:29:43,323
And the reason being is, in order to have a valid liquor license, they have to have a common vigilance license.

1423
01:29:44,123 --> 01:29:50,485
And whatever hours are stated on that common vigilance license, those will be the hours on their liquor license.

1424
01:29:51,425 --> 01:29:54,125
Now there's none of this that we're running into now.

1425
01:29:56,066 --> 01:30:04,127
You know, and tell them maybe, I don't know, we can bring it up at the next,

1426
01:30:06,225 --> 01:30:17,863
uh, annual ABCC training thing that, okay, if you're going to change your hours to want to be open later for New Year's, Christmas Eve, whatever, um,

1427
01:30:19,835 --> 01:30:20,075
Yeah.

1428
01:30:21,016 --> 01:30:24,418
You may want to do this ahead of time, you know?

1429
01:30:24,598 --> 01:30:36,366
So, Bob, it's like an informational newsletter that we send out to all our license holders in the city that gives them basically, throughout the year, all kinds of information and heads up.

1430
01:30:37,226 --> 01:30:44,291
And, you know, so people can't come in here and essentially plead ignorance to not knowing something that we have out there.

1431
01:30:45,171 --> 01:30:47,493
Um, I would say I'm, I'm in favor of that.

1432
01:30:47,573 --> 01:30:49,054
I think it's a good communication.

1433
01:30:49,074 --> 01:30:51,975
I think it's a good gesture to everybody that we're trying to be team players.

1434
01:30:52,096 --> 01:30:53,176
So, um.

1435
01:30:53,196 --> 01:30:56,778
I don't know who would do it if you would take that role on.

1436
01:30:57,059 --> 01:31:03,843
I mean, I could draft something for Daria to look at because you've got the master list to just send out to all the licensees.

1437
01:31:05,884 --> 01:31:20,782
And the thing is, too, is they've never really done fire inspections or the annual inspections with the building department, which is required by law.

1438
01:31:21,342 --> 01:31:22,323
And it's kind of like,

1439
01:31:22,944 --> 01:31:27,411
You know, this past year, we've done them past year, two years, and it's great.

1440
01:31:27,772 --> 01:31:28,793
So now they're used to it.

1441
01:31:29,154 --> 01:31:36,986
Now they know that it's their responsibility to get it inspected and have that certificate before we renew their liquor license.

1442
01:31:37,977 --> 01:31:43,479
The only thing that it's going to change now is we're going to add a common VIC onto that.

1443
01:31:43,719 --> 01:31:52,663
It's their responsibility to show us a valid common VIC with their hours, because common VIC doesn't renew until the end of the year.

1444
01:31:53,343 --> 01:31:56,564
I think they start renewing after we already got our renewals.

1445
01:31:57,284 --> 01:32:00,325
They start December 1st versus November 1st.

1446
01:32:00,906 --> 01:32:01,646
So if they show us 2025s,

1447
01:32:05,773 --> 01:32:06,173
It's fine.

1448
01:32:06,253 --> 01:32:07,014
We don't have to see 2026.

1449
01:32:07,054 --> 01:32:11,117
Does Boston do this or does anybody else?

1450
01:32:11,137 --> 01:32:11,918
Yeah.

1451
01:32:12,518 --> 01:32:19,224
I think it's a more professional way of running this and it'll require a little more from licensees and it'll set a better standard for them.

1452
01:32:19,284 --> 01:32:21,646
And that's what I believe we were after.

1453
01:32:21,666 --> 01:32:29,912
That's why I wanted to be part of the commission is because I think that, yeah, there's some low standards that some of these, they have in their minds of how we operate.

1454
01:32:31,893 --> 01:32:40,436
And I think it obviously just brings everybody up to speed, what we expect, and actually what the law is.

1455
01:32:41,337 --> 01:32:42,017
Well, yeah.

1456
01:32:42,157 --> 01:32:49,180
And the thing is, too, so far we've had two of those compliance meetings, and at both of them, I learned a boatload of stuff.

1457
01:32:50,136 --> 01:32:53,299
And I'm saying, you know, okay, here we go again and another one annually.

1458
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:59,283
But I learned more things that the second one that I either forgot or wasn't aware of.

1459
01:33:00,104 --> 01:33:03,266
And talking to Ralph, they switch it up every year.

1460
01:33:03,306 --> 01:33:04,287
They add new stuff.

1461
01:33:04,827 --> 01:33:06,649
So, and it keeps people shocked.

1462
01:33:07,029 --> 01:33:09,971
You know, the people that are in the licenses saying, oh, geez, I forgot.

1463
01:33:09,991 --> 01:33:12,253
Yeah, I shouldn't be doing this or I shouldn't be doing that.

1464
01:33:12,293 --> 01:33:15,776
And I think it's just benefits everybody.

1465
01:33:17,457 --> 01:33:18,217
We have a license.

1466
01:33:18,237 --> 01:33:20,399
He's saying, oh, I only saw a few beers a year.

1467
01:33:20,579 --> 01:33:22,220
What do I need to come do it?

1468
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:25,341
Well, then don't have a license.

1469
01:33:25,441 --> 01:33:26,482
We only had one.

1470
01:33:26,762 --> 01:33:29,423
We only had one license that said something this year.

1471
01:33:29,443 --> 01:33:30,024
Yeah.

1472
01:33:30,144 --> 01:33:32,265
And that was that tamper on Boston.

1473
01:33:32,605 --> 01:33:32,745
Yeah.

1474
01:33:32,845 --> 01:33:36,747
And, you know, they said, oh, we're thinking even given up by licenses or that.

1475
01:33:36,787 --> 01:33:37,787
But they came anyways.

1476
01:33:38,108 --> 01:33:38,368
Yeah.

1477
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:43,971
I mean, you know, it's not a big deal to take a couple hours out of your day once a year.

1478
01:33:44,811 --> 01:33:54,215
And just to stay on top of it, because it's your business and it can close down like the folks we had here back in November, you know?

1479
01:33:54,375 --> 01:34:02,819
You know, or, you know, the porch, obviously they close, but they just don't surrender their license and it makes it harder for the next person, you know, any communication.

1480
01:34:02,839 --> 01:34:04,760
Maybe they didn't want to have communication, but...

1481
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:08,344
hey, you could have just surrendered your license, you're going to use it.

1482
01:34:08,584 --> 01:34:09,686
Yeah, exactly.

1483
01:34:10,227 --> 01:34:14,812
And the other thing, too, is we get one other thing we got to take care of is that

1484
01:34:17,849 --> 01:34:20,591
early license that they were looking for at 10 a.m.

1485
01:34:21,172 --> 01:34:23,714
Well, they were looking for 8 a.m., but that's not going to happen.

1486
01:34:23,834 --> 01:34:24,074
10 a.m.

1487
01:34:24,094 --> 01:34:25,395
is the earliest you can do it.

1488
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:28,898
And being open until 2 a.m.

1489
01:34:28,998 --> 01:34:32,922
on New Year's Eve, I don't know, Christmas Eve.

1490
01:34:32,982 --> 01:34:37,906
It was a couple of three days if Memorial Day runs into a weekend or something.

1491
01:34:37,986 --> 01:34:41,169
But it's Chapter 138, Section 33A and 33B.

1492
01:34:46,553 --> 01:34:52,157
And what that does is that it has to be, from what I understand, approved by the council.

1493
01:34:52,658 --> 01:34:53,879
Who has asked this?

1494
01:34:54,699 --> 01:34:55,060
What's that?

1495
01:34:55,220 --> 01:34:57,382
Who asked for that gap?

1496
01:34:57,722 --> 01:34:59,483
Whoever wants to be like.

1497
01:35:01,879 --> 01:35:14,009
Well, Gab wanted the early hours, so say a restaurant come up to us and they wanted to do a brunch and serve Bloody Mary's at 10 o'clock in the morning on a Sunday morning, that would allow them to do it.

1498
01:35:14,549 --> 01:35:16,431
Well, haven't we approached by one of the clubs?

1499
01:35:16,911 --> 01:35:29,641
Yes, the Firefighters Club wanted to do, they were having a celebration when the Patriots were playing in England or something, out of the country, and the game was starting here at 9 a.m.

1500
01:35:32,583 --> 01:35:40,048
That's when we initially looked into the 33 A and B. The 33 B is for the early opening on Sundays.

1501
01:35:41,249 --> 01:35:44,110
But the city has to adopt that.

1502
01:35:46,752 --> 01:35:53,516
You spoke with KP Laudaria and they said he couldn't find it in the city ordinance that they ever adopted it.

1503
01:35:53,556 --> 01:35:56,078
So we should work on getting that adopted.

1504
01:35:56,118 --> 01:35:58,400
I don't know whether we have to present to the council.

1505
01:36:00,833 --> 01:36:02,014
something to adopt.

1506
01:36:02,034 --> 01:36:05,716
I'll ask Ralph about it, see what he, how we have it.

1507
01:36:05,776 --> 01:36:06,357
Yeah, sure.

1508
01:36:06,697 --> 01:36:07,898
I mean, we may as well have it.

1509
01:36:08,098 --> 01:36:09,259
It's available to us.

1510
01:36:09,659 --> 01:36:10,900
It's not hurting anybody.

1511
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:20,606
You know, God forbid somebody wants to start doing brunch or whatever and the customer gets an issue there or whatever.

1512
01:36:21,187 --> 01:36:23,829
It's just, you know, we're doing it the right way.

1513
01:36:25,810 --> 01:36:26,350
And that's,

1514
01:36:27,352 --> 01:36:32,295
Basically, I think all I had for notes was just those couple of three things.

1515
01:36:34,116 --> 01:36:36,517
I think the compliance meetings are good.

1516
01:36:36,777 --> 01:36:38,298
I think we should do another one this year.

1517
01:36:38,958 --> 01:36:40,759
It should be held on an annual basis.

1518
01:36:41,239 --> 01:36:45,842
We all learned something from it.

1519
01:36:45,862 --> 01:36:48,123
It keeps the ABCC happy as well.

1520
01:36:49,404 --> 01:36:56,488
So when we need advice or information from them, they're more than willing to help us out like they did with the establishment.

1521
01:36:57,589 --> 01:37:06,011
They were able to help that licensee out because his lawyer kind of dropped the ball, if you know what I mean.

1522
01:37:06,591 --> 01:37:11,833
But, you know, it's, it all works and it's the right thing to do.

1523
01:37:13,013 --> 01:37:17,054
So, but anyways, anybody else got any new business?

1524
01:37:17,374 --> 01:37:17,454
No.

1525
01:37:17,514 --> 01:37:23,896
We're talking about extending the compliance meeting.

1526
01:37:27,461 --> 01:37:40,854
Yeah, so she was saying that she was asking me if all of the licenses have to demonstrate proof of all of these ID check and training certification tests when they renew their license.

1527
01:37:41,615 --> 01:37:45,579
And she said, I just got back from a meeting with the high school administration.

1528
01:37:45,599 --> 01:37:49,062
They hear that lots of students are getting made by deans online.

1529
01:37:50,033 --> 01:37:58,399
I would encourage our offices licensees to look into a scanning system.

1530
01:37:59,140 --> 01:38:06,245
They can invest in one and they can obfuscate it over 80 IDs in the first six weeks.

1531
01:38:08,346 --> 01:38:08,567
Right.

1532
01:38:09,867 --> 01:38:11,389
Maybe we can include that in the newsletter.

1533
01:38:16,291 --> 01:38:21,838
Well, do we, we don't require it right now, right?

1534
01:38:21,898 --> 01:38:22,159
Right.

1535
01:38:22,599 --> 01:38:28,307
We don't require it, but we have been strongly urging them if there's been a contraction.

1536
01:38:28,928 --> 01:38:29,088
Right.

1537
01:38:32,053 --> 01:38:36,176
You actually want that make sure that we did for one day licenses.

1538
01:38:36,937 --> 01:38:44,142
So like the bartender or service, basically you guys, do you have to, or is this person certified?

1539
01:38:44,162 --> 01:38:44,462
Right.

1540
01:38:44,842 --> 01:38:46,464
Is that something we require?

1541
01:38:48,265 --> 01:38:53,969
We don't require it because sometimes it doesn't always fall for it.

1542
01:38:54,069 --> 01:38:54,810
If you know what I mean?

1543
01:38:54,890 --> 01:38:55,110
Yeah.

1544
01:38:56,595 --> 01:38:57,316
Very small event.

1545
01:38:57,517 --> 01:39:08,614
Well, from what I got from Ralph speaking with him before, like when we were discussing what some of the penalties should be in requiring.

1546
01:39:09,723 --> 01:39:15,047
the Medford Wine and Spirits to have their folks CHIP certified.

1547
01:39:16,028 --> 01:39:26,735
He says you can do that, but from this point forward, anybody that comes to you with violations, you're going to have to require them to do the same thing.

1548
01:39:26,756 --> 01:39:27,156
Okay.

1549
01:39:27,793 --> 01:39:28,353
Which is fair.

1550
01:39:28,494 --> 01:39:30,835
Yeah, I mean, the people that are doing the right thing.

1551
01:39:30,855 --> 01:39:34,618
And it's, you know, the employees aren't tip certified.

1552
01:39:34,658 --> 01:39:35,579
That's their business.

1553
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:38,021
I don't think it's required.

1554
01:39:38,041 --> 01:39:41,003
Or I tend this to be tips.

1555
01:39:41,043 --> 01:39:41,484
I don't know.

1556
01:39:41,564 --> 01:39:44,726
I don't know if that's actual requirement or not, but.

1557
01:39:46,298 --> 01:39:47,739
It, to me, it doesn't seem like it.

1558
01:39:47,779 --> 01:39:50,081
I don't think I've seen it anywhere in 138.

1559
01:39:51,022 --> 01:40:08,416
So, you know, when we have people come in front of us that, you know, for a hearing like we just did, obviously 395 Main Street's gonna have to get that stipulation put on them if we find any infractions.

1560
01:40:09,577 --> 01:40:14,160
And, you know, that's kind of the way to go with it, I guess.

1561
01:40:15,553 --> 01:40:19,481
in Katherine opposite for free.

1562
01:40:20,544 --> 01:40:23,049
She's not her Sophie Greenbaum.

1563
01:40:26,356 --> 01:40:34,620
she gets funding and it's, and when she posted it and we posted it to all the licensees, the only one that showed up was me.

1564
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:47,465
And it was like... For example, that's just a liquor store bottom scanner because they're having a problem and they confiscated all the IDs in the first six weeks, which is totally believable.

1565
01:40:50,027 --> 01:41:03,156
But what if somebody needs to hire employees because it's the holidays and not every single person is TIP certified because it's impractical that they could get all TIP certified within that time and then they have a violation?

1566
01:41:05,538 --> 01:41:08,900
Are we asking that before you sell anybody anything?

1567
01:41:12,722 --> 01:41:14,423
There's got to be exceptions to the rule.

1568
01:41:14,443 --> 01:41:19,647
And like what you just said, during the holidays, employees, temporary employees or whatever.

1569
01:41:21,915 --> 01:41:25,878
If they're going to be that busy during the holidays, they're not going to put a newbie alone in the store.

1570
01:41:26,318 --> 01:41:32,082
There's going to be somebody else in there that's hopefully TIP certified, that knows what they're doing.

1571
01:41:32,863 --> 01:41:39,728
But if the person's going to be hired, I don't know, a month before, two months before, then yeah, get them TIP certified.

1572
01:41:39,788 --> 01:41:40,648
It's not a big deal.

1573
01:41:40,989 --> 01:41:45,212
Sean, how would you address wagons, for example, the cashiers?

1574
01:41:46,287 --> 01:41:52,094
Well, they haven't violated yet, done anything that we're going to require that.

1575
01:41:52,354 --> 01:41:54,077
So it would be part of.

1576
01:41:55,513 --> 01:41:57,073
just when there's a violation.

1577
01:41:57,154 --> 01:41:57,854
Okay.

1578
01:41:58,014 --> 01:42:00,414
Just, just if somebody, yeah, I think that's fine.

1579
01:42:00,455 --> 01:42:02,215
I just don't want to go back in time.

1580
01:42:02,435 --> 01:42:03,976
Well, I don't know.

1581
01:42:04,036 --> 01:42:10,958
I would say, Oh yeah, you have to have every single person because running a business, I know you just can't have such a big turnover.

1582
01:42:11,278 --> 01:42:11,558
Yeah.

1583
01:42:11,578 --> 01:42:22,101
But you're talking about this and infraction or something, but I think that getting, sorry, but the getting the scanner are investing in a scanner that could be part of a newsletter out to

1584
01:42:22,481 --> 01:42:23,582
all our package stores.

1585
01:42:23,722 --> 01:42:25,403
Hey, that's the whole thing.

1586
01:42:25,423 --> 01:42:27,264
You didn't hear it from us.

1587
01:42:27,424 --> 01:42:29,486
You heard, get a scanner.

1588
01:42:29,626 --> 01:42:31,747
There's lots of fake IDs out there.

1589
01:42:31,907 --> 01:42:33,388
I mean, they're rampant on the internet.

1590
01:42:33,528 --> 01:42:34,149
I believe that.

1591
01:42:34,369 --> 01:42:35,650
Are they expensive?

1592
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:39,032
Is that why they don't have them because they're a lot?

1593
01:42:39,212 --> 01:42:47,177
And I think the ones that, not 395, but Medford Wine and Spirits was a big money one that they pay a monthly.

1594
01:42:49,169 --> 01:42:51,270
I think it was, I don't know the amount, the cost.

1595
01:42:51,310 --> 01:42:53,452
They gave us the number, the model and everything.

1596
01:42:53,492 --> 01:42:59,296
I never looked it up, but supposedly they have to pay a monthly fee as well.

1597
01:43:00,177 --> 01:43:06,021
And the old one that they had was a less expensive one, and you could only put the license in one.

1598
01:43:06,081 --> 01:43:13,887
And if you got okayed or didn't get okayed, then you couldn't put it in again the same day for some reason.

1599
01:43:13,987 --> 01:43:16,289
I don't know what he was talking about.

1600
01:43:18,085 --> 01:43:19,545
Yeah, it was crazy.

1601
01:43:19,645 --> 01:43:22,526
But when he upgraded to the new one, you could do it as much as you want.

1602
01:43:22,806 --> 01:43:25,647
Well, if you don't want to get one, you can sell it to Wegmans.

1603
01:43:25,667 --> 01:43:29,308
They'll pay you 500 grand.

1604
01:43:29,508 --> 01:43:30,949
It's just cost of doing business.

1605
01:43:30,969 --> 01:43:32,929
I don't really feel any kind of way about it.

1606
01:43:32,969 --> 01:43:40,011
I think that the fees are so minuscule anyway that if you can't afford to run the business right, then don't run the business.

1607
01:43:40,271 --> 01:43:41,751
I think you hit the nail on the head.

1608
01:43:42,252 --> 01:43:44,692
Make it incorporated as part of the newsletter.

1609
01:43:47,753 --> 01:43:51,674
stating that this commission is requiring you to purchase one.

1610
01:43:52,294 --> 01:43:57,655
It's suggested, strongly suggested, something like that.

1611
01:43:57,835 --> 01:44:00,856
Yeah, it's just, we'll figure out the wording on that.

1612
01:44:00,876 --> 01:44:02,336
But then you're right.

1613
01:44:02,376 --> 01:44:05,557
I mean, I look at the annual license for package stores, $1,500.

1614
01:44:05,677 --> 01:44:08,358
I bet you that scanner's a lot more than that.

1615
01:44:09,038 --> 01:44:11,018
It is the cost of doing business.

1616
01:44:11,699 --> 01:44:12,799
We'll work on those next.

1617
01:44:12,979 --> 01:44:14,939
Yeah.

1618
01:44:15,339 --> 01:44:16,400
Give us something to work on.

1619
01:44:18,441 --> 01:44:22,204
Okay, so should we make a motion to adjourn?

1620
01:44:22,244 --> 01:44:23,766
Sure, I motion to adjourn.

1621
01:44:24,306 --> 01:44:24,646
What's that?

1622
01:44:24,726 --> 01:44:26,648
I take that.

1623
01:44:26,688 --> 01:44:32,553
Catherine wanted to see if we could discuss it at the next meeting.

1624
01:44:33,094 --> 01:44:34,775
For the scanner type thing?

1625
01:44:36,417 --> 01:44:37,138
CHIP certified?

1626
01:44:42,397 --> 01:44:47,598
No, we can discuss it, but I don't think we should mandate it, or is that what we have to discuss?

1627
01:44:47,618 --> 01:44:52,139
Because I don't even know if we can mandate it.

1628
01:44:52,279 --> 01:44:54,099
Yeah, I'm not for mandating it, no.

1629
01:44:54,359 --> 01:44:58,860
Yeah, I don't feel the same way.

1630
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:04,041
I mean, people that are doing the right thing, why put them through that?

1631
01:45:05,521 --> 01:45:11,762
If they start doing the wrong thing and there's violations, then, okay, now you mandate it, it doesn't count.

1632
01:45:12,988 --> 01:45:13,808
from this point forward.

1633
01:45:13,888 --> 01:45:15,489
I just think the team, yeah.

1634
01:45:16,170 --> 01:45:28,236
Maybe it's just, because I'm looking at what everyone took after, and you just talked about how, just to discuss in general, the tips and also to implement a better process for the violation.

1635
01:45:28,256 --> 01:45:32,218
Because I remember being touched based on that.

1636
01:45:32,438 --> 01:45:35,239
On the violence police reports?

1637
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:37,020
Yeah.

1638
01:45:37,060 --> 01:45:42,643
This violation, like, superb level of, so everybody's on the same page, what?

1639
01:45:43,018 --> 01:45:48,381
Okay, it's going to be well, to be there or whatever the case.

1640
01:45:49,402 --> 01:45:56,666
Yeah, well, like the suggestion from Ralph was anytime from this point forward, we get a report from the police department.

1641
01:45:57,587 --> 01:46:00,308
That licensee is to be notified to appear.

1642
01:46:00,829 --> 01:46:03,991
At the next commission meeting, along with the police.

1643
01:46:05,371 --> 01:46:07,233
And the police can read the report.

1644
01:46:08,125 --> 01:46:18,613
We'll already have a copy of the report and at that point we can look at it and say, yeah, there was no chapter 138 violations here as far as I'm concerned.

1645
01:46:18,673 --> 01:46:22,456
And then you'll speak and you'll speak and okay, everybody's cool with it.

1646
01:46:22,556 --> 01:46:28,860
And the police will say, yeah, it's a criminal matter or it's not a criminal matter or we felt as though there was no violations and then it's done.

1647
01:46:29,948 --> 01:46:37,954
but we have to, whenever we're notified by the police, we have to follow through with it and have them come just like it's going to be a hammering.

1648
01:46:38,655 --> 01:46:39,095
Makes sense.

1649
01:46:40,696 --> 01:46:41,817
Covers everybody's butt.

1650
01:46:42,137 --> 01:46:43,598
Yeah.

1651
01:46:44,859 --> 01:46:45,140
Okay.

1652
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:46,080
I think that was it.

1653
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:48,622
So did you want to, what do we do?

1654
01:46:48,682 --> 01:46:51,645
Put Catherine on the agenda and she can come in and we can discuss it.

1655
01:46:53,546 --> 01:46:54,467
Yeah, that's fine.

1656
01:46:54,907 --> 01:46:55,067
Yeah.

1657
01:46:55,648 --> 01:46:56,668
We don't have a problem with that.

1658
01:46:58,130 --> 01:46:58,350
Okay.

1659
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:00,303
All right, so I go back to motion to adjourn.

1660
01:47:00,323 --> 01:47:00,925
I'll second the motion.

1661
01:47:00,945 --> 01:47:01,306
All those in favor?

1662
01:47:01,326 --> 01:47:01,407
Aye.

1663
01:47:01,427 --> 01:47:01,507
Aye.

1664
01:47:01,527 --> 01:47:01,587
Aye.

1665
01:47:01,607 --> 01:47:01,667
Aye.

1666
