    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=107.402">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=107.962">So</a>  this is the same event that we ran last year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=111.085">It's,</a>  it was, I shouldn't say to my surprise, but to my surprise, very successful speed dating event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=121.353">Basically</a>  it's rather simple event where people just come together and then they, everyone's in like a circle and then they rotate and they see if they like each other. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=132.321">And</a>  then after the speed dating, they get a little, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=137.045">There's</a>  like, it's kind of like an open time to just like mix and mingle with a little music and some drinks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=145.328">And</a>  that's really it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=147.289">It's</a>  pretty simple. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=150.31">And</a>  it's on a Saturday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=151.91">It's</a>  in the afternoon. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=153.451">So</a>  it's not really late, late at night. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=155.852">And</a>  it's been great for us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=157.512">So</a>  we're doing it again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=158.593">Good.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=159.893">So</a>  it worked out pretty good last year for you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=162.394">Yeah,</a>  we still have some couples dating.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=165.76">That's</a>  terrific.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=166.621">We're</a>  pretty thrilled about it.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=168.483">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=171.566">It's</a>  Father Shen's dream is to like have everyone marry each other from the church. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=176.872">So</a>  it's great.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=179.335">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=181.117">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=181.797">I'm</a>  just trying to pull that up here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=186.613">And</a>  then you'll see on the second page, Emily is one of our members who plans this event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=192.556">I</a>  just support her with like anything like this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=195.597">So</a>  the bar will just be placed in front of the kitchen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=198.119">There's</a>  like a commercial kitchen type thing in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=202.621">And</a>  so she'll just have one little table where she puts like some beers out or stuff like that.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=208.304">All</a>  right, very good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=211.165">And</a>  Tammy, we have insurance on file with them.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=217.573">We</a>  are waiting for that COI for that day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=220.516">I'm</a>  almost positive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=222.978">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=224.44">Father</a>  hooked them again this morning, the insurance company that we use, but we should have it by the end of the week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=233.249">So</a>  I'm on top of them about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=234.83">Hopefully</a>  we get it right away. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=237.488">We</a>  have a finance person left. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=240.432">So</a>  we don't have a finance person right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=242.234">So</a>  Father Hines is like dueling as also the financial coordinator. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=247.08">So</a>  things were a little slower than usual.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=249.664">Got</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=252.067">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=254.532">I</a>  mean, I looked it over, it looks okay to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=258.675">There</a>  were no issues last year, so my fellow commissioners, if you have any comments or would like to speak about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=266.261">No,</a>  I agree.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=267.362">I</a>  mean, it's the same event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=271.625">I</a>  really enjoyed the diagram they put right into the second page. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=275.368">Yeah,</a>  I think that was the first.</p>

    <p>[Alvaro Sandoval]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=277.07">She's</a>  so cute.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=279.761">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=280.982">So</a>  that gives us a good idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=283.584">And</a>  we've seen them on pizza boxes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=286.186">We've</a>  seen them on paper bags. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=288.288">So</a>  that works for me.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=289.949">I</a>  couldn't find it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=290.81">I</a>  was looking everywhere for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=292.431">And</a>  then I realized she put it in the document. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=296.754">Funny.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=298.515">But</a>  it's pretty good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=299.596">Looks</a>  accurate.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=300.969">Mr.</a>  Chairman, if you don't mind, I'd like to make a motion to move this off the table.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=305.052">Yeah,</a>  just if you want to include it with receiving the insurance.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=311.878">Sure,</a>  sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=313.359">Okay,</a>  so I motion to accept the one-day license for the event called Speed Dating to be held on February 1st of this year from 3.30 to 10 p.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=325.088">conditioned</a>  upon receiving the liability insurance binder.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00103_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=395.914">Sure</a>  thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=397.095">So</a>  we have been doing workshops and different performances in the space. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=400.436">So</a>  the first one is so that we can hold a crafting and cinema night. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=405.258">So</a>  people come in, they'll buy a craft from us, or they'll craft on what they want to, and we might just be able to serve some wine that evening, and we'll watch a fun movie. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=414.603">That's</a>  on February 6th, which is a weekday evening. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=418.785">Do</a>  you want me to go on to the next one, or do you want to talk on one by one?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=422.186">No,</a>  we can do them all together if you like.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00103_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=426.84">So</a>  then the next one is a blues jam. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=429.882">It's</a>  something that we're starting up here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=431.502">It</a>  was something that closed down when the porch closed down. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=433.964">And</a>  so the person who was running it at the porch is now running it here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=436.885">It's</a>  actually Hendrik. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=437.766">I</a>  have him in the background. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=440.307">And</a>  so we just want to, again, be able to have a simple cash bar at that event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=443.909">And</a>  that's very similar to the third one, which is live concerts that Hendrik does. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=449.092">There's</a>  a featured performer and it'll just be a simple cash bar.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=453.438">Okay,</a>  and the buyer is going to be in the same place at all three events?</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00103_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=456.94">Same</a>  place at all three events. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=458.26">We</a>  always do it on one side of our gallery.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=461.201">Okay,</a>  and do you have insurance on file with us?</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00103_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=466.424">Yes,</a>  Daria should have it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=468.725">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00103_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=469.705">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=471.326">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=472.686">Daria,</a>  you have their insurance on file? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=477.148">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=478.849">Yeah,</a>  I looked over. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=482.463">The,</a>  the 3 applications, my fellow commissioners, if anything that you had noticed or seen on it that you may have question, I noticed that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=493.029">You</a>  applied for all alcohol, which is fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=495.45">You're</a>  a nonprofit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=497.491">That's</a>  not an issue and. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=501.4">Other</a>  than the insurance, you know, I'm sure we have it on file where Darius says we did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=507.206">It's</a>  fine with me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=509.228">You</a>  guys?</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=511.51">Will</a>  it be all alcohol? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=513.312">Or</a>  just beer and wine?</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00103_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=514.012">Honestly,</a>  it's probably going to be wine and beer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=518.056">I</a>  haven't touched other alcohol.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=522.22">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=522.761">Darius</a>  is curious. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=524.363">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=526.115">Yeah,</a>  and I appreciate the professional design on the 3rd page. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=530.338">That's</a>  very good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=531.859">You</a>  can see how the door is swinging. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=533.981">What</a>  direction then you appreciate that you do.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00103_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=537.223">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=538.164">It's</a>  the architectural drawing of our building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=543.368">I</a>  think you're muted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=546.47">So,</a>  I don't have the questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=549.473">Yeah,</a>  that's fine.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=555.9">The</a>  three of them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=559.803">We</a>  can lump them all together if you want to do them all at once.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=562.684">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=564.985">I</a>  motion to approve the three one-day license requests to be held on February 6th, February 9th, and February 20th for ACM, the Arts Collaborative in Medford, for their fundraising event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=585.6">You</a>  want to second that, Ben?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=589.344">Yeah,</a>  I'll second it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=591.486">All</a>  righty. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=593.488">We</a>  have a second. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=594.93">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=596.131">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=598.053">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=601.857">Hearing</a>  and seeing none, the ayes have it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=605.3">You're</a>  all set.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00103_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=606.707">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=607.507">Can</a>  I ask one question? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=608.648">I</a>  don't want to take up too much time, but Hendrick actually has his own nonprofit, but it just lives here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=615.112">So</a>  going forward, is it easier that all of the applications come through me because it's where it's happening, or should some of them, the ones that he's holding, come from him now?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=625.56">Well,</a>  it may be advantageous for you to, if you can do it either way is fine, but you're only allowed 30 per year.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=634.606">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=635.647">So</a>  maybe if you start, you know, splitting them up and things like that, just so you don't go over the 30, you know, it's at your facility, but if he's running the event, you know, either way, it should be fine, you know, as long as there's insurance for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=650.698">If</a>  he's going to put it under his name, he'll have to have the insurance and stuff like that as well.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00103_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=655.83">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=656.492">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=656.833">That's,</a>  that was my question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=657.836">Thank</a>  you guys so much.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=659.682">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=660.384">Good</a>  luck.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00103_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=661.327">Have</a>  a great rest of your day.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=662.872">You</a>  too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=748.545">Should</a>  be a little louder now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=753.108">Okay,</a>  let's see what's next on the agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=757.111">And</a>  I took care of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=760.493">Okay,</a>  we have a representative from El Tacuba presenting for an entertainment license for your establishment on 35 Salem Street in Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=772.181">Alvaro,</a>  how are you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=774.982">You</a>  can take your red thing off mute, Alvaro.</p>

    <p>[Alvaro Sandoval]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=782.43">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=783.99">How</a>  are you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=784.671">Hi</a>  everyone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=786.031">Hi,</a>  how are you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=787.251">Good.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=787.451">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=789.252">Uh,</a>  it's good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=790.052">Let</a>  me get this turned up even more. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=793.332">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=793.933">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=795.333">Um,</a>  tell us what you're doing Elvaro. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=797.373">You</a>  got an application for a, uh, entertainment license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=802.395">What</a>  are your plans?</p>

    <p>[Alvaro Sandoval]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=804.555">Well,</a>  it's just for the, um, for the music that we play at the restaurant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=809.833">the</a>  TVs that they already in place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=812.655">And</a>  just in case if we ever gonna have maybe a mariachi one night, who knows? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=821.182">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=824.304">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=825.605">So</a>  it's just a basic entertainment license mostly for the TVs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=830.309">And</a>  it also covers if you want to do a mariachi or...</p>

    <p>[Alvaro Sandoval]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=835.707">Sing</a>  along or whatever you want to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=838.149">We're</a>  going to do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=839.19">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=840.071">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=841.192">Barbara,</a>  how many TVs? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=843.214">It</a>  just says TVs at the bottom.</p>

    <p>[Alvaro Sandoval]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=845.677">There's</a>  two TVs in the back.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=847.698">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=849.36">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=850.441">And</a>  yeah, you can have up to 10 devices. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=852.783">So</a>  you can have a stereo system or whatever as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=860.33">It</a>  looks like everything's in order as far as all the inspections that had to be signed off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=867.254">I</a>  don't have an issue with this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=869.236">Everything</a>  looks good to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=871.077">My</a>  fellow commissioners, I'm sure you've had a chance to look over the application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=876.12">If</a>  you'd like to comment.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=879.483">No,</a>  no, I thank them for waiting to get everybody to sign off on this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=887.513">It's</a>  easier to approve it rather than having to make a condition. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=890.815">We've</a>  got to go chase after another inspection. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=894.036">So</a>  I'm good with this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=897.097">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=898.098">Ben?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=898.578">Yeah,</a>  me too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=899.158">It</a>  looks like it's been getting it signed off since October. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=902.86">And</a>  yeah, you did all the work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=905.221">And</a>  it sounds fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=908.282">And</a>  you're below the threshold anyway. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=910.303">So</a>  no issues at all.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=912.264">OK,</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=914.165">OK,</a>  if one of you gentlemen would like to make the motion.</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1503.426">For</a>  the record, my name is Patrick Smith. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1505.128">I'm</a>  a police officer in the city of Medford, also a liquor agent for the City of Medford Liquor Licensing Commission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1512.692">I</a>  wrote a report inside the report that was a juvenile to protect the identity of the juvenile, that juvenile's name, and identifying information will not be provided. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1523.219">It's</a>  on file at my police department, but for legal purposes, I can't release that information because it involves a juvenile. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1530.925">Let's</a>  see, on December 8th, oh, December 9th, 2024, I spoke with Officer Robin Pascantelli of the Medford Police Department in regards to Medford High School students purchasing liquor from Main Street Liquor Mart located at 395 Main Street in Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1547.196">Should</a>  be noted that Officer Pascantelli is a school resource officer assigned to Medford High School. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1552.779">Officer</a>  Pascantelli had direct contact with students that informed him Main Street Liquor Mart sold liquor to persons under the age of 21. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1560.441">I</a>  spoke to Lieutenant Lockowitz regarding this matter, spoke to Captain Cabino, and Captain Cabino authorized Port Town to conduct a separate investigation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1572.335">Due</a>  to scheduling conflicts and implementing weather, my investigation was delayed several weeks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1579.334">On</a>  Friday, January 3rd, 2025, I traveled to Main Street, Lickomah to observe how business was being conducted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1587.081">I</a>  wore a full Medford police uniform. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1588.842">It's</a>  the same uniform that I'm wearing in today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1591.624">I</a>  operated an unmarked Medford police vehicle, and I parked directly next to the MMA studio that is adjacent to Main Street, Lickomah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1602.814">I</a>  began my observations approximately at 7.45 p.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1607.728">and</a>  we'll go into the first allegation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1611.389">At</a>  approximately 8.10 p.m., an observer would appear to be a young individual entering Main Street Liquor Mart. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1619.372">Based</a>  on the individual's physical characteristics, I believe the individual to be approximately 18 years of age. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1626.975">Several</a>  minutes after entering Main Street Liquor Mart, the individual exited the business carrying an 18-pack of Bud Light Lime and an 8-pack of Neutral Vodka Seltzer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1637.854">The</a>  individual proceeded to walk south on Main Street towards William Street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1641.316">At</a>  that time, I drove the unmarked vehicle onto William Street, and I exited the vehicle. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1646.999">I</a>  approached this individual and asked them how old they were, and they responded that they were 17 years old. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1653.603">I</a>  recognize this individual from a previous liquor investigation, and know this individual to be 17 years old. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1661.764">I</a>  asked the 17-year-old how he was able to purchase the alcohol, and he informed me that he utilized a fake New Hampshire driver's license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1671.829">Upon</a>  seeing the New Hampshire driver's license, I determined that it was, in fact, fraudulent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1678.093">It</a>  was abnormally thick, and the overall quality was poor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1683.615">This</a>  is the same exact fake ID that the person used during that previous investigation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1693.038">I</a>  explained to him, or I explained to the juvenile that I would be seizing the fake ID, and that I would be seizing the alcohol, and that I would be following up with his parents. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1704.78">This</a>  is the second time in two months that I've observed this juvenile purchasing the liquor through his fraudulent driver's license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1711.821">A</a>  criminal complaint was sought against the juvenile in Cambridge Juvenile Court for minorization of alcohol and procuring alcoholic beverages by false representation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1723.467">The</a>  criminal charge of procuring alcohol beverages by false representation is for the juvenile using a fraudulent prevention driver's license to purchase the alcohol. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1732.652">If</a>  the commission would like to see the ID that the person used, it's the same one that they used back in the day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1741.356">So</a>  a little follow-up for him. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1744.877">Since</a>  then, in the last two weeks, I've gone to everyone else's house twice.</p>

    <p>[Alvaro Sandoval]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1749.14">I've</a>  met with their parents twice.</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1750.42">I've</a>  met with him and explained the ramifications. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1754.182">We</a>  had a good conversation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1755.483">I</a>  said that the last time in November, but this time there is pending criminal charges in court for this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1766.429">I</a>  told them that the next time it'll be another level. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1769.792">Like</a>  I said in the previous meetings, this was the second step for us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1775.516">And</a>  then Officer Gascantilli was the school resource officer that was made responsible for this specific problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1782.983">So</a>  that's the extent of the first application.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1787.166">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1788.467">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1789.328">Do</a>  you want me to step back? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1792.23">Yes,</a>  we'll give the <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1796.735">For</a>  the folks from Trinidad, I appreciate the opportunity to speak at this time.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1972.969">This</a>  is the first time this individual ever came? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1975.47">Yeah,</a>  he does trust me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1976.77">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=1977.33">And</a>  so it's the first time or something in New Hampshire?</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2138.219">So</a>  the first violation is the 810. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2143.058">This</a>  is at 8.40 p.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2145.46">Once</a>  again, I'm wearing my full uniform. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2148.001">I'm</a>  sitting in an unmarked car, again, in front of the next part of the studio, the next floor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2153.905">I</a>  observe a young male enter Main Street Liquor Mart based on the male's physical characteristics. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2160.689">I</a>  believe him to be approximately 18 years of age. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2163.971">Several</a>  minutes after entering, he exited the business carrying a 12-pack of Poor's Light, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2169.995">And</a>  in that eight pack of sun and pressure iced tea vodka, he then proceeded to walk towards Wareham Street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2176.498">I</a>  then drove on to Wareham Street, exited my unmarked vehicle, approached him, and I asked him how old he was. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2182.701">He</a>  stated that he was 19 years of age. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2186.143">I</a>  asked him how he was able to purchase the alcohol, and he stated he had a fake Massachusetts driver's license, which allowed him to buy the alcohol. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2194.307">He</a>  handed me the fake <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2196.468">the</a>  fake ID, I told him the ID will be seized, the alcohol will be seized. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2201.213">And</a>  that body was positively identified as Joseph Mangone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2206.758">He</a>  is 19 years of age. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2208.86">And</a>  due to this being the first offense with me and the liquor agents, he was let off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2219.31">I</a>  thought we had a positive interaction. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2221.884">We</a>  apologize for the incident. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2226.946">The</a>  commission would like to see his fake ID. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2228.647">Yeah,</a>  it's just an alias.</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2256.519">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2257.099">It's</a>  certainly not the worst I've ever seen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2258.939">It's</a>  bad. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2260.039">It</a>  is bad. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2260.759">But</a>  it's certainly not the worst I've seen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2263.42">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2263.62">Yeah,</a>  you see, with the real ones, it should be able to fit.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2278.978">Yeah,</a>  the hologram is like, it's dense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2283.08">Yeah,</a>  I kind of agree, not the worst, I mean, but, you look at it, it's bad.</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2291.203">It's</a>  bad when you look at it, you have a little one right beside it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2294.724">Yeah,</a>  that's it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2295.464">And</a>  then you can't hold these on a regular basis. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2297.125">Yeah,</a>  it's just bad.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2298.806">Right,</a>  regular mists.</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2301.527">So</a>  as alcohol was seized, it's a lot too thick, I think it was seized. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2306.127">we</a>  had a good possible decision. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2307.988">Hopefully,</a>  we won't have them again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2311.73">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2311.99">Second</a>  violation.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2314.092">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2316.173">Is</a>  there anybody from 395 Main Street that would care to comment on the second violation?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2323.473">Hi,</a>  my name is Chetan Ratan, and I'm replying as Mr. Lekharnam. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2329.697">What</a>  I want to show you is the fighting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2332.879">It</a>  looks like a real, so we are a little bit confused for that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2337.221">Most</a>  of the time, me and my brother were there, but on that day, my brother was only there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2342.224">So</a>  we were a little confused for that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2345.226">Raj</a>  shows the video like that way, not giving his hand. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2349.489">So</a>  we never saw this kind of fighting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2353.102">So</a>  we are in this business for almost 14 years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2358.187">And</a>  we apologize for that mistake. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2360.269">And</a>  now we've got a scanner, so we're going to take my commitment that I'll be single-minded.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2367.875">OK,</a>  can I ask you a question? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2370.037">Did</a>  you receive the scanner? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2371.679">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2372.299">And</a>  you have been using it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2373.701">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2374.862">And</a>  has it been pretty accurate?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2377.124">Are</a>  you getting good results? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2378.9">We</a>  check like a different way, not like, just to be not stuck on the scanner only, but we also check this personally, like the picture, the match face, eyes, so the site will make sure that they're real.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2394.384">Okay,</a>  and I'd like to ask you another question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2398.005">Have</a>  the employees been TIP certified?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2400.906">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2401.666">They</a>  have? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2402.186">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2403.007">Okay,</a>  so you know that accepting any type of out-of-state <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2409.165">ID</a>  and driver's license is not accepted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2411.626">North</a>  record. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2414.568">Because</a>  I believe the first one was an out-of-statement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2419.371">Okay,</a>  I just wanted to ask you that.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2422.352">Question,</a>  did you say he's never seen a license like that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2427.295">Is</a>  that what you were saying? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2428.956">Like</a>  a message or something? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2431.437">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2431.697">It</a>  looked like a savior. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2432.738">I</a>  never saw this guy in it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2439.918">And</a>  also show me, let's see, you can see that particular things in the license, the color, and the paper, and the logo inside. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2449.683">So</a>  now we are very careful for that.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2452.985">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2453.285">And</a>  you know, when you look at that particular license, it just looks like a problem.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2457.367">Yes,</a>  it's a problem.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2458.547">Should,</a>  you know, they, whoever looked at it, should have, Red Flag should have not seen hundreds and hundreds of the railroads. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2467.712">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2469.093">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2477.991">Gary,</a>  you might have to let me back in.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2487.557">Well,</a>  I think what we're all thinking is, it seems unlikely we'd never have seen an ID like that, being a fake Massachusetts ID.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2499.326">Yes,</a>  sir, but like, I do not recognize this kind of body, like, look like, because my brother is holding his hand, because he go like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2507.788">Hopefully,</a>  maybe holding hand, then we can see that, but like, you know what I'm saying? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2512.529">Like,</a>  no idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2514.91">Do</a>  you wear a tip or not, Nick? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2516.591">No,</a>  from that time, no.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2522.452">And</a>  you're, you know, being TIP certified helps you identify <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2526.16">Yes,</a>  in the proper way to check IDs.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2534.447">And</a>  when you talk, what did you say? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2539.812">I</a>  was preoccupied, I didn't notice, I was distracted, I was, what was, why? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2547.398">As</a>  they say, slip by the rule, you might have had a curve.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2552.493">It's</a>  like my brother-in-law is a strategist, so like the lottery guy and the guy, so that's why he doesn't see the idea from the background that I'm more technically late. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2564.217">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2564.538">But</a>  we apologize for that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2565.958">Yeah,</a>  yeah, we understand.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2574.509">I</a>  don't have any other questions, Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2577.492">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2579.634">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2580.074">Thank</a>  you, sir. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2580.715">Thank</a>  you, sir. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2581.395">Officer</a>  Smith, would you like to read the third alleged violation?</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2589.802">With</a>  the commission's permission, I'd like to kind of combine three and four. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2594.086">The</a>  two bodies went in together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2595.727">I</a>  think that's important in the stories that I received from Baltimore.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2599.551">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2601.362">So</a>  that second violation was at 8.40 p.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2604.867">This</a>  is now... At that time, I observed two young males in a mainstream lick-a-mat, based on both males' physical characteristics. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2614.26">I</a>  believe the males to be approximately 18 years of age. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2618.268">Several</a>  minutes after entering, we had Stanley come out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2621.131">One</a>  of the males exited the business carrying a 24-pack of blight. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2624.834">He</a>  proceeded to walk towards Wareham Street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2626.876">He</a>  went, he exited the store by himself. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2629.699">The</a>  other person was still up at the counter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2632.382">What</a>  I didn't want to happen is somebody get in a car, drive away, or, you know, then just split up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2637.486">I</a>  knew that person was young, so I wanted to make contact with that body first. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2641.47">So</a>  I drove on to Wareham Street, I exited the vehicle, approached the man, asked him how old he was. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2646.773">He</a>  told me that he was 20. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2648.634">He</a>  produced a real driver's license that identified him as Nicholas Pascarella. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2654.817">He</a>  is 20 years old. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2656.818">I</a>  asked him, initially I asked him how he was able to purchase the alcohol, and he told me that he used a fake Massachusetts driver's license, which I have right here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2667.103">Let</a>  me show the connection.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2672.605">He</a>  explained to me that he used that to make the purchase.</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2683.294">So</a>  I told him that the alcohol and the fake ID were seized. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2686.556">This</a>  was our first interaction. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2688.057">So</a>  he was let go with a warning. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2691.599">I</a>  stood with him in the car. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2692.86">He</a>  anticipated his friend to return. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2694.921">His</a>  friend did not return because he saw me talking to his buddy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2700.585">And</a>  he crossed the street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2702.266">So</a>  then I looked for him. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2703.667">I</a>  went around the corner, saw him. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2705.027">I</a>  motioned that maybe we had a conversation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2709.558">He</a>  was able to purchase a 12-pack of Pacifica beer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2713.521">He</a>  admitted to making the purchase, and then he actually hid it in the entryway of 399 Main Street, which is rampant towards Queensland. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2721.526">He</a>  retrieved the alcohol, came back over. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2723.467">I</a>  asked him how he was able to make the purchase. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2726.049">He</a>  said that he was never ID'd. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2728.188">And</a>  so I explained to him that there's obviously video cameras inside of Evercool, and so I'm going to be going back in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2733.236">I</a>  want honesty. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2734.758">And</a>  he goes, oh, no, absolutely not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2736.3">I</a>  was never an ID to make the purchase. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2739.345">It</a>  was at that time, Mr. Pastorelli, he was the first person to find it, and then I said it was flawed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2744.79">He</a>  goes, oh, I was never caught either. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2746.79">I</a>  said, you just gave me a fake ID. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2748.351">He</a>  goes, oh, I have a fake ID, but I didn't use it to make the purchase. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2751.952">I</a>  said, okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2753.392">I</a>  go, guys, this video, it's going to be on video whether you used IDs or not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2757.433">I'd</a>  like to be honest with you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2759.233">And</a>  both of them were at a no time where they asked for ID and provided ID to make the purchase. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2764.595">So</a>  the second problem, one with the Pacific Opia, his name was Liam Creamer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2769.696">He</a>  is 19 years old. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2770.996">I</a>  was able to possibly ID him with this real ID. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2775.386">And</a>  it was Mr. Kramer's first interaction with the local liquorades and he had no history with them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2781.228">So</a>  he once again was let off the morning. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2783.708">They</a>  were all seized that Mr. Pasquarello's fake ID was taken. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2789.55">So</a>  at that time, I concluded. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2791.67">I</a>  said, I've been out there for about an hour and 15 minutes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2795.531">I</a>  have four people under 21, I'm done going to the store. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2799.17">I'm</a>  going to the summary of that, but I just want to be specific on the third or fourth violations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2805.475">I</a>  was able to review the video of the purchase. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2809.258">At</a>  no time did they produce an IP. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2812.221">They</a>  go up to the counter, they put the beer on the counter, it gets scanned, they take a debit card or a credit card out of their wallet, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2820.815">They</a>  put it in the transact, I don't know which card. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2825.056">They're</a>  able to make the purchase of the credit card, debit card, take the alcohol, they walk out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2828.897">No</a>  time to make, they produce it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2832.398">So</a>  Mr. Brown and Mr. President, while we watched the I.D., he explained to me that he observed the same thing that I observed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2840.601">I</a>  showed it to Mr. Kumar as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2843.462">Mr.</a>  Kumar was upset by this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2848.031">He</a>  explained that he always checks IDs, and this is where the lottery comes in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2852.656">So</a>  there was a gentleman that was there before, he had a bunch of lottery slips. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2856.42">He</a>  did the lottery, he was going through the slips, and then these two kids, they're not kids, but the 21 and 19-year-old were right after him. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2865.409">So</a>  that was the distraction aspect. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2870.792">He</a>  said he was distracted by the person on the lottery slips and he must have forgotten to ask for the purchase. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2878.657">So</a>  that's basically the extent of three and four. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2881.958">I</a>  wanted to combine them as they are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2888.562">Before</a>  I went to the summary, all that alcohol that was seized, I believe six cases of alcohol, that was brought back to the Bethel Police Station, that was thrown in the trash, and the fake IDs are gonna be destroyed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2902.338">That's</a>  the conclusion of this area and the criminal area. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2906.101">I'll</a>  go into the summary after.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2911.605">The</a>  lottery thing was actually, when you looked on camera, it was for the two kids at the end.</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2916.609">Two</a>  kids at the end. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2917.35">Who</a>  didn't produce the IDs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2918.871">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2919.211">I</a>  did not watch the videos for the first two interactions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2922.954">Both</a>  of them were flat. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2924.235">They</a>  told me we used our fake IDs to make the purchases. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2928.718">I</a>  didn't watch the video on that because they were adamant that they used their fake IDs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2933.162">I</a>  watched it for three and four because it's a question whether the IDs were used or not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2937.486">The</a>  20-year-old that I interviewed said, absolutely not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2940.428">I</a>  was never ID'd. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2941.829">I</a>  went inside. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2942.65">Mr.</a>  Kumar said, I have to see everybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2945.352">And</a>  we had to speak to him. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2946.774">So</a>  I wanted to see the video for three and four. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2949.056">And</a>  in fact, while viewing it, three and four would never produce an ID. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2954.2">They</a>  walked out and made their purchase. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2955.661">They</a>  walked out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2956.743">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2957.383">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2958.244">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2958.624">As</a>  far as moving to window watch.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2960.326">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2960.646">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2961.206">So</a>  if I'm looking at the time to afford fractions from 10 past 8 p.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2968.051">to</a>  9 p.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2968.871">is</a>  that sound right?</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2970.653">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2972.374">And</a>  I have 810, 840, and then, uh, three and four together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2977.637">They're</a>  at nine o'clock. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2978.998">So</a>  four, four or 50 minutes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2983.706">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2984.306">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2985.207">Thank</a>  you, Officer Smith. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2986.287">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2987.308">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2988.528">Is</a>  there a 50-minute distraction? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2990.929">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2991.99">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=2993.711">Is</a>  there someone from 395 Main Street that would like to comment on what Officer Smith has just read on alleged violations three and four?</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3006.396">Yes,</a>  sir.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3011.07">I'm</a>  just like the officer said, like, we must check the videos for those kids came in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3020.983">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3021.283">So</a>  as the fake IDs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3024.267">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3025.253">That's</a>  what I mentioned before, he was like showing his ID, like in the hand stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3030.257">The</a>  first and second one? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3032.979">The</a>  second.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3034.08">The</a>  second one.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3035.301">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3035.501">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3036.042">And</a>  usually, not usually, I'm sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3040.185">When</a>  officer was with Lieutenant, they went upstairs to check the cameras. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3044.649">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3045.05">After</a>  that, I have one <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3047.359">came</a>  in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3048.179">He</a>  had the same mass ID. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3049.64">We</a>  already discussed about it before. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3051.52">We</a>  checked this and that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3052.82">He</a>  just gave me the ID and I was checking it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3054.601">This</a>  is a fake. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3055.661">And</a>  I was holding the OSS fake ID and he just snatched it and just ran off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3060.662">So</a>  I went back to the office and I tell him like it happened again with me, like someone tried to like buy a phone or the same thing.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3070.003">Yeah,</a>  but you didn't settle on any alcohol?</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3072.504">No,</a>  after that I just like, as soon as I just, I want to keep the eye on him, even if they were upstairs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3078.805">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3079.065">So</a>  when I try to show them, he's just like snatching.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3081.946">Okay,</a>  very good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3085.426">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3088.467">Is</a>  there anyone else that would like to speak? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3094.728">On</a>  anything, on all of four? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3098.577">alleged</a>  violations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3101.398">Okay,</a>  Officer Smith. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3102.759">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3104.459">I</a>  could you please state your name and address for the record?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3111.622">Yeah,</a>  my name is Priscilla. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3114.103">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3114.384">Yeah,</a>  I'm just like I say, I'm apologizing whatever happened. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3118.665">I'm</a>  like, I have a 17 year old too, so it shouldn't be happening like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3123.551">We</a>  have been working with them for 13 years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3125.692">It</a>  never happened. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3126.753">We</a>  have said we are not selling anything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3131.575">I</a>  don't know how. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3132.716">It</a>  was a bad luck or whatever. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3135.797">It's</a>  not once, it's three times a day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3137.858">I</a>  don't know what to say. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3139.779">We</a>  just take precautions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3145.402">We</a>  bought a safety scanner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3148.704">We're</a>  still getting those people, but refusing <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3152.017">and</a>  rechecking the license, not even like the scanner, it shows like you have to check his eyes, whatever it says, it will fall in the data. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3162.52">It</a>  was unflashable.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3166.241">It</a>  is concerning. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3167.181">I</a>  mean, just in 50 minutes, it's four fractions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3169.922">I</a>  mean, and that's one point in time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3173.896">So,</a>  you know, you're right, was it just an off day, it went off, or do the kids, these young kids know, let's go here? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3182.963">They</a>  don't even ask for a license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3185.645">So,</a>  as I said, it is concerning.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3188.727">No,</a>  I understand, like, even though, like, two months ago, we got a certificate, I don't know what time, we were just, like, overconfident, you know, getting those tickets or whatever, they started becoming, certainly, I don't know what happened.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3202.501">yeah,</a>  they're targeting your store to come to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3205.662">I</a>  mean, think about it, you know, I mean, let's just say, yeah, but it's not, I mean, just to speak like, like what everybody else is thinking, here's, I mean, store resource officer says, people, kids are dying. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3221.287">Officer,</a>  you know, he goes out on one random night. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3224.908">In</a>  15 minutes, he gets three kids. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3228.029">And</a>  then 15 minutes later, another kid, you know, comes in to buy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3231.988">I</a>  mean, so what do you think it looks like? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3234.95">You</a>  know, you bought the scanner, you're doing the right thing now, but obviously it looks bad and it looks like you guys would just, you'd rather get money, get paid for this and not do it right, not, you know, check ID, not actually be responsible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3255.501">So</a>  that's what it looks like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3256.562">I'm</a>  speaking for myself, but that's what it looks like, I'm sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3261.292">Anybody</a>  watching this feels, most people feel the same way.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3268.158">I</a>  don't know if there's something to say.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3272.561">We</a>  understand your story. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3274.423">You</a>  know, that's a little too late right now, only because I agree with my fellow commissioner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3283.624">You</a>  know, you're in this business to make a living and to make money, but you can't do it at the expense of possibly someone else's life. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3294.889">These</a>  kids could take that alcohol, drive a vehicle, kill not only themselves, but kill innocent parties, innocent families, my family, your family. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3306.755">You</a>  know, then it's too late and it isn't worth the money. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3310.637">And</a>  this commission really <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3313.155">really</a>  frowns on this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3315.796">I</a>  mean, this is serious. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3318.617">And</a>  that's why we're having this hearing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3322.519">We</a>  want to get you outside of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3326.001">You</a>  are showing that you did purchase the scanner, which is going to take care of a little bit of this problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3335.025">Obviously,</a>  we'll take all of this information under advisement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3342.967">after</a>  the officer reads the summary, and we'll go from there.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3351.813">No,</a>  I agree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3353.434">I</a>  mean, just once you start saying no, and you start carding, the word gets out, and that's it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3362.14">We</a>  move on to somewhere else, and we'll take action somewhere else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3368.144">But</a>  yeah, the chairman's right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3370.225">I</a>  mean, have these kids, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3373.395">got</a>  away, got into trouble or hurt somebody, killed somebody, they'll come for your corporation and your business. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3383.84">So</a>  not that you don't already know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3388.122">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3388.763">Thank</a>  you, Nancy, for saying we will take it under advisement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3393.385">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3396.266">Is</a>  there anyone else that would like to speak? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3400.462">on</a>  behalf of the school at the lake and we will give you an opportunity to speak as well after the officer reads the summary of the report and officer smith would you like to read the summary</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3420.532">Just</a>  to go back to what Mr. Kumar said, while we were watching the video on the third and fourth violations, myself and Mr. Bradley, Mr. Kumar didn't come upstairs and explain to me that another person under 21 came in with a fake ID to make a purchase and that sale was denied while I was upstairs watching the video. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3438.386">So,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3442.87">So</a>  after we have these violations, it's been, like you said, four violations or four people under 21 in 50 minutes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3449.9">I</a>  said, I have to do something about this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3452.203">I'm</a>  going into the store. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3453.585">We've</a>  got to address this immediately. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3459.763">Yeah,</a>  I mean, basically, you can summarize it, too, if you like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3462.846">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3463.227">I'll</a>  give you the summary of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3464.949">That's</a>  for you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3465.71">So</a>  after I'm brain-forgone, I head to the store. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3469.674">Mr.</a>  Kumar is present. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3470.896">He's</a>  right by the counter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3473.058">I</a>  identified myself and gave him a full summary of what I had just watched. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3480.259">Mr.</a>  Kumar was very apologetic to my findings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3485.181">He</a>  explained to me that he always asked for an ID, and that he wasn't aware. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3491.164">I</a>  showed him the fake IDs, and he apologized. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3497.408">I</a>  asked him who the manager was, I mean, who the owner was. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3501.83">He</a>  told me the owner of the business was Mr. Paul Ratner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3506.469">So</a>  I'm out there having a conversation with Mr. Kumar, and a second employee comes over to me from the back row, and that probably identifies himself as Mr. Paul Ratton. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3517.851">And</a>  so I asked him if he was the owner, and he told me no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3521.292">So</a>  after some back and forth, I found out that Mr. Kumar and Mr. Ratton are brother and wife, and that their wives are actually the owners of the business. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3530.174">So</a>  I explained to them that I needed to speak to the owner and reschedule the meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3536.146">I</a>  also gave a full summary to Mr. Rad. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3538.727">I</a>  explained everything that I observed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3540.548">I</a>  showed them my IDs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3542.229">We</a>  pulled out our own mass IDs and looked at them and everybody agreed that they were all fake. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3548.513">So</a>  Mr. Pasquarello, Mr. Rad, even though Mr. Pasquarello never used his ID, Mr. Mangone's ID was a fake. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3556.097">That</a>  time Mr. Rad brought me upstairs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3557.618">We</a>  looked at the video, sort of bring it forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3563.879">certified</a>  on the property. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3567.92">So</a>  I scheduled a meeting for the next day, and I returned on the 4th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3573.162">I</a>  met with Ms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3574.122">Debbie,</a>  and sorry, I forget your name. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3577.743">I</a>  apologize, I have it here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3582.125">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3582.305">Latta,</a>  Mr. Rat, Mr. Pumak. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3584.406">We</a>  all met the following day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3585.626">I</a>  explained the full investigation, what transpired the night prior. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3592.154">I</a>  learned that as long as they have children that are just under 20 mile, they were very upset by the findings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3598.797">I</a>  learned that there was no scanner or no way to verify the IDs on property at the time, and that they had ordered a scanner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3605.583">and</a>  that it was due to arrive the following day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3607.444">I</a>  thought our overall conversation was positive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3611.746">They</a>  were upset by my findings, and they expressed great concern, and they wanted to do better. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3617.369">And</a>  I thought that was a great step. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3618.529">I</a>  didn't recommend buying a scanner, but they went out and did that before I even arrived the following day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3623.692">I</a>  thought that was positive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3627.234">When</a>  I brought the notice to appear, I actually saw the scanner in action. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3631.536">It</a>  was somebody who was younger in age that came in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3634.311">I</a>  observed, I was another employee, I observed him, I asked for ID, he looked at the ID, put it in the scanner, came back, and a sale was made. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3643.416">So</a>  I was very happy to see that the scanner was in place and working. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3646.678">I</a>  believe I went on the 8th to serve that notice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3650.94">So</a>  by the 8th, up and operational, and I observed it, it was working at that time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3660.103">Essentially,</a>  the summary, I didn't pass on my report to Officer Pascotillo, who's the school resource officer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3667.03">He</a>  has been an asset for almost for this commission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3670.453">He</a>  told us about the previous one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3672.535">This</a>  is direct knowledge coming from high school students at Bethel High School. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3676.279">He's</a>  becoming aware of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3678.381">He's</a>  now telling me, and then I show up on a random night and observe business being conducted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3686.698">That</a>  night in particular, these are obvious to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3690.241">I</a>  deal with these people on the 21 all the time, so I know what a person on the 21 looks like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3694.965">That</a>  night, I didn't approach anybody else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3697.307">They</a>  were obvious to me that they were on the 21. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3699.508">Same</a>  with the last investigation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3702.931">These</a>  are obvious to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3704.832">They</a>  look young. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3705.733">They're</a>  not private. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3706.494">They're</a>  wearing sweatpants, sweatshirts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3708.035">They've</a>  got their lanyards hanging out of their pockets. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3710.597">These</a>  do not look like, they don't have beards. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3713.199">They're</a>  not older. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3715.271">They</a>  look like kids, and I refer to them as kids even though they're 18, 19, 20, 16, 17. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3723.874">That's</a>  essentially my summary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3726.655">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3727.195">Well,</a>  great job with this, Officer Smith.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3729.575">I</a>  appreciate the work and the authenticity of this.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3733.137">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3733.797">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3736.878">Anybody</a>  from 395 Mansfield, are you here?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3745.086">What</a>  happened to the store, that's so bad. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3747.827">And</a>  we apologize for that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3750.808">And</a>  we are in this business for 14 years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3754.209">And</a>  the city sends so many times to check us and for the inspection, to sell the underage. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3760.511">And</a>  we never fail. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3761.472">You</a>  check your records. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3763.092">And</a>  we have a kid, 21, like 20 years old. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3766.213">We</a>  know how bad it is to sell the underage people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3769.405">And</a>  I know that every day, three teens die from drinking and driving. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3774.289">I</a>  know these things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3775.55">So</a>  how is it possible we sell these things? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3778.372">What</a>  purpose? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3779.793">We</a>  formalized all that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3781.074">This</a>  is a mistake, but we will be next time very careful to check every single point of the ID. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3789.285">Most</a>  of the time, me and my brother were there, so we know that auto check the ID, so it will never happen again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3796.767">We</a>  apologize for that, so please give us a break this time, and we will now give you a copy for regarding the address. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3805.849">And</a>  we will now accept the auto state IDs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3810.69">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3813.091">Were</a>  you TIP certified? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3815.511">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3815.671">That's</a>  something you should know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3817.152">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3819.505">You</a>  know, it's, it's, there's no excuse for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3824.308">And,</a>  you know, it's kind of right now when this seemed to be a little bit out of control, especially where it was going around in high school, that that was the place to buy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3839.017">You</a>  know, it's, it's, it's telling us that this has been going on for a little while. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3844.681">And</a>  you're saying that this, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3848.898">you'll</a>  assure us this will never happen again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3852.061">I'm</a>  giving you warning today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3853.943">If</a>  it does happen again, and you come before this commission, you've got a chance of us revoking your license permanently. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3867.776">So</a>  keep that in mind. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3869.057">That's</a>  the most severe penalty. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3875.654">And</a>  so that's just something to keep in mind, and something for all your employees to keep in mind, because as you know, liquor license in the city is worth a lot of money for a liquor store. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3887.398">And</a>  if your license gets revoked, that's not only going to cost you your business, it's going to cost you, and you've got to sell that license to your mom and yourself. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3898.501">So</a>  this is very, very important, and it's such a strong <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3904.891">that</a>  we're giving you because it's such an important thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3909.934">You</a>  know, I served on the fire department for 30-some odd years, and I've seen what Alcoa does. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3918.059">It's</a>  impressive, as well as Officer Smith. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3921.841">And</a>  it's not a pretty sight. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3924.143">And,</a>  you know, you just... This is why we just try to keep the handle on this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3931.487">We</a>  find it very serious. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3933.598">And</a>  I felt as though I had to give you a full warning just for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3939.945">So</a>  there won't be a next time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3943.83">I</a>  understand, sir. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3944.871">You</a>  seem very remorseful, which we take into consideration as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3949.756">Thank</a>  you, sir.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3955.58">We're</a>  going to discuss this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3956.741">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3957.301">Oh,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3958.202">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3958.502">We're</a>  going to discuss this before any kind of a wanting disorder, anything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3965.247">We're</a>  going to talk about this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3967.188">Because</a>  there's some stuff in here that I'm wrestling with. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3972.552">So,</a>  OK. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3974.694">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3975.814">Yeah,</a>  I think just so it's more clear, what I'm saying is that it could be your business. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3985.622">But</a>  that doesn't mean that there's no consequence for this time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3988.805">So</a>  just saying no, that doesn't mean that there's not any consequence. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3992.868">That's</a>  something we need to deliberate about for that, just so there's no, like it's not unclear.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=3999.453">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4000.034">Ken,</a>  do you want to kind of explain what happens from this point forward?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4009.982">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4011.983">Everybody</a>  that's here today that was one <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4015.84">Is</a>  everybody all set? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4017.201">Anybody</a>  else wanna speak? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4023.624">Okay,</a>  so what I'm going to do is I'm going to recommend that this commission takes this matter under advisement and you'll be notified with that decision. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4040.433">What</a>  we do with this point is the three commission is only <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4045.323">meet</a>  privately. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4047.585">We</a>  discuss all of our notes that we took here today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4051.908">We</a>  have the police report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4053.729">We</a>  have your testimony. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4056.21">And</a>  we take it all into consideration. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4060.353">And</a>  we will decide what, if any, penalties were to be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4071.323">What</a>  I'd like to do is have you folks back at our next monthly meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4077.007">You'll</a>  know before then on what our outcome was in this and we plan to just discuss it with you and make sure that you understand everything that we put in into the decision on what the <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4099.794">what,</a>  if any, the punishment is going to be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4104.918">So</a>  I make a motion for this commission to take this matter for advisement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4110.883">If</a>  one of you folks would like to second it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4115.607">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4887.764">They</a>  opened like later. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4891.206">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4894.895">We</a>  had the license, but no hours on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4898.137">So</a>  I think that's what made me look. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4900.158">I</a>  was looking at my spreadsheet, and for some reason, saw I'm missing, there was a whole issue with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4906.481">So</a>  I had to fix it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4907.702">But</a>  then I was like, I don't know if Gab actually ever told us their hours. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4911.404">So</a>  that's what made me think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4912.985">So</a>  I checked with the city clerk. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4914.206">I'm</a>  like, did they ever apply for a coming week until 1 AM? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4918.448">So</a>  he said, no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4919.909">But</a>  I'm like, I couldn't remember exactly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4922.45">Because</a>  for some reason, I feel like they did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4924.578">But</a>  if you tell me no, then that means no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4926.6">But</a>  that's when I started to think about the whole square footage and all that stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4930.983">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4931.164">Because</a>  there was a lot on it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4932.725">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4933.145">Technically,</a>  that's not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4935.607">But</a>  I want to, before I go to the next columnist, I want to make sure that all the information is correct.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4946.852">Okay,</a>  does does their license say they're open to one?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4950.616">Because</a>  they, when they open, just in October, when they have the license, but you just never have the hours.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4961.006">Yeah,</a>  but what does the common Vic say? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4966.311">Then</a>  they can't be open to one.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4967.732">I</a>  think they,</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4974.565">But</a>  didn't they come and they wanted to open at 8 a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4980.028">or</a>  something and we went to 11?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4981.568">We</a>  started with 11. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4984.43">That</a>  was assumed that their closing time was already established.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4987.171">I</a>  say that's the problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=4988.192">The</a>  ACC application doesn't last for hours. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5001.379">So</a>  because of the whole issue for 1AM that we figured out last year because of the coming big, I never paid attention to it until we started this issue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5010.426">So</a>  that occurred in my head and I was like, wait. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5013.208">But</a>  whenever they don't have coming big, it started that they really shouldn't be turning to 1AM. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5017.832">But</a>  they might not even know that because this all happened after they got their license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5022.596">They</a>  wouldn't have even talked about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5025.238">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5027.179">They</a>  played catch up.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5032.135">Well,</a>  if they want to legitimately be open until one, do they need City Council approval, or do they just need our approval? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5039.923">Yeah,</a>  they need to go to Council.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5042.53">Yes,</a>  COVID is only until 11 p.m.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5045.493">Right,</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5046.234">So</a>  unless, like Snappy Patty's did last month, we approved them for 1 a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5053.822">for</a>  some reason. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5054.522">They</a>  only wanted it on Thursday, Friday, Saturday or something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5057.325">I</a>  mean, you got to do it to it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5059.447">Just</a>  1 a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5060.869">You</a>  can go 2 a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5063.015">2</a>  a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5063.415">is</a>  our limit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5065.356">If</a>  the city will allow it, that's 2 a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5067.737">is</a>  it?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5068.297">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5068.878">So,</a>  I mean, you know, if they want to do 1 a.m., they feel as though that's enough, then, you know what, just apply for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5077.662">But</a>  I think what we should do is have Mr. Brian Zatha, we ought to notify him to see what his CarmenVic hours are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5089.847">And</a>  if they're not till 1 a.m.,</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5093.115">Yeah,</a>  which I think will be easier to track. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5095.657">He's</a>  pretty reasonable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5097.159">I'm</a>  not going to tell him to shut down. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5099.541">Let's</a>  get him on track.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5101.823">They</a>  have to be open for food the whole time? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5104.645">They</a>  didn't get an exception?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5118.842">The</a>  only way is an exception is a general, I think it's called the general section 12 license, which Chevalier has, and they do not have to serve food. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5136.252">I</a>  don't think Brian has a general.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5137.733">I</a>  can't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5147.739">I</a>  think that's what he's labeled as.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5151.225">off</a>  on-premise restaurant, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5155.487">Which</a>  is the same as a regular section 12 in the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5160.289">You</a>  know, I mean, if he was under the impression that those were his hours and they're not on a common VIC, I think we should discuss it with him. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5170.734">And</a>  like you say, Alan, we're not gonna tell him to start closing at 11 o'clock, but let's give him a time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5177.597">Let's</a>  give him 90 days. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5180.072">To</a>  make sure that the proper paperwork is filled out at the city clerk's office, because the city clerk told me personally that 1, when we were looking for Bocelli's and stuff for to be open to 1 am for New Year's. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5195.38">He</a>  says, they got to come here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5197.081">Then</a>  they got to have a ties in the paper. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5199.203">That</a>  takes so many weeks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5200.864">Then</a>  they got to go before the city council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5202.665">And</a>  it says it's just for one night. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5204.887">He</a>  says, it's the same for changing the hours. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5207.048">That's</a>  what it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5208.049">So</a>  he says, okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5209.69">So</a>  if they got to do all of that, let's put a time limit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5213.433">You</a>  got 90 days and by such and such, if it's not done and approved by the city council, you can only stay open until 11 o'clock. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5223.48">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5225.035">I</a>  think it's fair. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5226.976">It's</a>  technically, I don't think, I don't know if we can even do this because it's out of our jurisdiction. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5235.64">Our</a>  jurisdiction is 2 a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5238.561">with</a>  the city clerk's approval and the city council's approval. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5245.244">So,</a>  I mean, they've been doing it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5249.085">Let's</a>  just, and there's been no trouble. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5253.048">So</a>  let's just continue what we've done with this process in the works. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5259.751">We'll</a>  give them 90 days and see if they can pull it off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5262.992">If</a>  that sounds fair to you guys. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5264.272">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5264.613">What</a>  if they can't get it done in 90 days? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5266.353">Cause</a>  that sounds like a process that could take longer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5268.354">And</a>  also the city, they need to have availability to meet with them, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5275.617">The</a>  city councilor.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5277.418">They</a>  just have to,</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5280.568">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5281.608">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5282.009">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5282.649">If</a>  he talks on it, like if I talk to him and I tell him, like, right, do this as soon as possible, like start it this week, they will, they will help him as much as they can and it should be done within a month.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5294.634">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5294.754">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5294.974">And</a>  council meets every month?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5296.875">Maybe.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5297.275">Or</a>  every other month?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5298.596">Twice</a>  a month, I believe.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5299.716">Twice</a>  a month. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5300.377">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5300.657">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5301.197">Well,</a>  then that's more than enough.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5302.718">And</a>  the 90 day, yeah, in three months should be, should work.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5305.419">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5305.879">But</a>  they, they have to do the, um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5310.622">Advertising</a>  and I'm not sure if they have to mail the residents. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5314.968">I</a>  have to look into it, but.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5319.357">Yeah,</a>  yeah, there's really no direct about us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5323.038">I</a>  think it's the same thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5324.458">I</a>  was like, we're. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5326.519">We're</a>  opening a business, right?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5328.499">But</a>  that's stuff for the city clerk and the council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5332.2">It's</a>  nothing to do with us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5333.981">No,</a>  the only thing we do is just get right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5338.362">Once</a>  we see that comment, Vic, which brings me to the next. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5343.5">thing</a>  I just wanted to run it by you guys maybe we could do like a quarterly newsletter out to the licensees something like now it'll be a winter newsletter happy new year blah blah blah <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5360.043">We're</a>  going to be having a few different, I don't know, we'll put it in certain words, but we're going to have changes this year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5367.931">This</a>  year's license renewal must include a copy of your common vigilance license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5376.002">And</a>  the reason being is, in order to have a valid liquor license, they have to have a common vigilance license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5384.123">And</a>  whatever hours are stated on that common vigilance license, those will be the hours on their liquor license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5391.425">Now</a>  there's none of this that we're running into now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5396.066">You</a>  know, and tell them maybe, I don't know, we can bring it up at the next, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5406.225">uh,</a>  annual ABCC training thing that, okay, if you're going to change your hours to want to be open later for New Year's, Christmas Eve, whatever, um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5419.835">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5421.016">You</a>  may want to do this ahead of time, you know?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5424.598">So,</a>  Bob, it's like an informational newsletter that we send out to all our license holders in the city that gives them basically, throughout the year, all kinds of information and heads up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5437.226">And,</a>  you know, so people can't come in here and essentially plead ignorance to not knowing something that we have out there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5445.171">Um,</a>  I would say I'm, I'm in favor of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5447.573">I</a>  think it's a good communication. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5449.074">I</a>  think it's a good gesture to everybody that we're trying to be team players. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5452.096">So,</a>  um. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5453.196">I</a>  don't know who would do it if you would take that role on.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5457.059">I</a>  mean, I could draft something for Daria to look at because you've got the master list to just send out to all the licensees. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5465.884">And</a>  the thing is, too, is they've never really done fire inspections or the annual inspections with the building department, which is required by law. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5481.342">And</a>  it's kind of like, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5482.944">You</a>  know, this past year, we've done them past year, two years, and it's great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5487.772">So</a>  now they're used to it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5489.154">Now</a>  they know that it's their responsibility to get it inspected and have that certificate before we renew their liquor license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5497.977">The</a>  only thing that it's going to change now is we're going to add a common VIC onto that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5503.719">It's</a>  their responsibility to show us a valid common VIC with their hours, because common VIC doesn't renew until the end of the year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5513.343">I</a>  think they start renewing after we already got our renewals. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5517.284">They</a>  start December 1st versus November 1st. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5520.906">So</a>  if they show us 2025s, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5525.773">It's</a>  fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5526.253">We</a>  don't have to see 2026.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5527.054">Does</a>  Boston do this or does anybody else? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5531.137">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5532.518">I</a>  think it's a more professional way of running this and it'll require a little more from licensees and it'll set a better standard for them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5539.284">And</a>  that's what I believe we were after. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5541.666">That's</a>  why I wanted to be part of the commission is because I think that, yeah, there's some low standards that some of these, they have in their minds of how we operate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5551.893">And</a>  I think it obviously just brings everybody up to speed, what we expect, and actually what the law is.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5561.337">Well,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5562.157">And</a>  the thing is, too, so far we've had two of those compliance meetings, and at both of them, I learned a boatload of stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5570.136">And</a>  I'm saying, you know, okay, here we go again and another one annually. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5573.359">But</a>  I learned more things that the second one that I either forgot or wasn't aware of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5580.104">And</a>  talking to Ralph, they switch it up every year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5583.306">They</a>  add new stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5584.827">So,</a>  and it keeps people shocked. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5587.029">You</a>  know, the people that are in the licenses saying, oh, geez, I forgot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5589.991">Yeah,</a>  I shouldn't be doing this or I shouldn't be doing that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5592.293">And</a>  I think it's just benefits everybody.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5597.457">We</a>  have a license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5598.237">He's</a>  saying, oh, I only saw a few beers a year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5600.579">What</a>  do I need to come do it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5603.02">Well,</a>  then don't have a license.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5605.441">We</a>  only had one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5606.762">We</a>  only had one license that said something this year.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5609.443">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5610.144">And</a>  that was that tamper on Boston. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5612.605">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5612.845">And,</a>  you know, they said, oh, we're thinking even given up by licenses or that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5616.787">But</a>  they came anyways.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5618.108">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5618.688">I</a>  mean, you know, it's not a big deal to take a couple hours out of your day once a year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5624.811">And</a>  just to stay on top of it, because it's your business and it can close down like the folks we had here back in November, you know?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5634.375">You</a>  know, or, you know, the porch, obviously they close, but they just don't surrender their license and it makes it harder for the next person, you know, any communication. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5642.839">Maybe</a>  they didn't want to have communication, but... <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5645.34">hey,</a>  you could have just surrendered your license, you're going to use it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5648.584">Yeah,</a>  exactly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5650.227">And</a>  the other thing, too, is we get one other thing we got to take care of is that <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5657.849">early</a>  license that they were looking for at 10 a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5661.172">Well,</a>  they were looking for 8 a.m., but that's not going to happen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5663.834">10</a>  a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5664.094">is</a>  the earliest you can do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5665.536">And</a>  being open until 2 a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5668.998">on</a>  New Year's Eve, I don't know, Christmas Eve. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5672.982">It</a>  was a couple of three days if Memorial Day runs into a weekend or something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5677.986">But</a>  it's Chapter 138, Section 33A and 33B. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5686.553">And</a>  what that does is that it has to be, from what I understand, approved by the council.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5692.658">Who</a>  has asked this?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5694.699">What's</a>  that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5695.22">Who</a>  asked for that gap? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5697.722">Whoever</a>  wants to be like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5701.879">Well,</a>  Gab wanted the early hours, so say a restaurant come up to us and they wanted to do a brunch and serve Bloody Mary's at 10 o'clock in the morning on a Sunday morning, that would allow them to do it.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5714.549">Well,</a>  haven't we approached by one of the clubs?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5716.911">Yes,</a>  the Firefighters Club wanted to do, they were having a celebration when the Patriots were playing in England or something, out of the country, and the game was starting here at 9 a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5732.583">That's</a>  when we initially looked into the 33 A and B. The 33 B is for the early opening on Sundays. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5741.249">But</a>  the city has to adopt that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5746.752">You</a>  spoke with KP Laudaria and they said he couldn't find it in the city ordinance that they ever adopted it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5753.556">So</a>  we should work on getting that adopted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5756.118">I</a>  don't know whether we have to present to the council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5760.833">something</a>  to adopt. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5762.034">I'll</a>  ask Ralph about it, see what he, how we have it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5765.776">Yeah,</a>  sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5766.697">I</a>  mean, we may as well have it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5768.098">It's</a>  available to us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5769.659">It's</a>  not hurting anybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5771.98">You</a>  know, God forbid somebody wants to start doing brunch or whatever and the customer gets an issue there or whatever. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5781.187">It's</a>  just, you know, we're doing it the right way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5785.81">And</a>  that's, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5787.352">Basically,</a>  I think all I had for notes was just those couple of three things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5794.116">I</a>  think the compliance meetings are good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5796.777">I</a>  think we should do another one this year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5798.958">It</a>  should be held on an annual basis. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5801.239">We</a>  all learned something from it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5805.862">It</a>  keeps the ABCC happy as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5809.404">So</a>  when we need advice or information from them, they're more than willing to help us out like they did with the establishment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5817.589">They</a>  were able to help that licensee out because his lawyer kind of dropped the ball, if you know what I mean. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5826.591">But,</a>  you know, it's, it all works and it's the right thing to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5833.013">So,</a>  but anyways, anybody else got any new business? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5837.374">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5837.514">We're</a>  talking about extending the compliance meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5847.461">Yeah,</a>  so she was saying that she was asking me if all of the licenses have to demonstrate proof of all of these ID check and training certification tests when they renew their license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5861.615">And</a>  she said, I just got back from a meeting with the high school administration. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5865.599">They</a>  hear that lots of students are getting made by deans online. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5870.033">I</a>  would encourage our offices licensees to look into a scanning system. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5879.14">They</a>  can invest in one and they can obfuscate it over 80 IDs in the first six weeks.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5888.346">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5889.867">Maybe</a>  we can include that in the newsletter.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5896.291">Well,</a>  do we, we don't require it right now, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5901.898">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5902.599">We</a>  don't require it, but we have been strongly urging them if there's been a contraction. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5908.928">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5912.053">You</a>  actually want that make sure that we did for one day licenses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5916.937">So</a>  like the bartender or service, basically you guys, do you have to, or is this person certified?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5924.162">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5924.842">Is</a>  that something we require?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5928.265">We</a>  don't require it because sometimes it doesn't always fall for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5934.069">If</a>  you know what I mean?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5934.89">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5936.595">Very</a>  small event.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5937.517">Well,</a>  from what I got from Ralph speaking with him before, like when we were discussing what some of the penalties should be in requiring. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5949.723">the</a>  Medford Wine and Spirits to have their folks CHIP certified. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5956.028">He</a>  says you can do that, but from this point forward, anybody that comes to you with violations, you're going to have to require them to do the same thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5966.756">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5967.793">Which</a>  is fair. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5968.494">Yeah,</a>  I mean, the people that are doing the right thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5970.855">And</a>  it's, you know, the employees aren't tip certified. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5974.658">That's</a>  their business. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5976.6">I</a>  don't think it's required. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5978.041">Or</a>  I tend this to be tips. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5981.043">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5981.564">I</a>  don't know if that's actual requirement or not, but. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5986.298">It,</a>  to me, it doesn't seem like it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5987.779">I</a>  don't think I've seen it anywhere in 138. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=5991.022">So,</a>  you know, when we have people come in front of us that, you know, for a hearing like we just did, obviously 395 Main Street's gonna have to get that stipulation put on them if we find any infractions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6009.577">And,</a>  you know, that's kind of the way to go with it, I guess. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6015.553">in</a>  Katherine opposite for free. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6020.544">She's</a>  not her Sophie Greenbaum. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6026.356">she</a>  gets funding and it's, and when she posted it and we posted it to all the licensees, the only one that showed up was me.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6034.64">And</a>  it was like... For example, that's just a liquor store bottom scanner because they're having a problem and they confiscated all the IDs in the first six weeks, which is totally believable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6050.027">But</a>  what if somebody needs to hire employees because it's the holidays and not every single person is TIP certified because it's impractical that they could get all TIP certified within that time and then they have a violation? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6065.538">Are</a>  we asking that before you sell anybody anything?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6072.722">There's</a>  got to be exceptions to the rule. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6074.443">And</a>  like what you just said, during the holidays, employees, temporary employees or whatever. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6081.915">If</a>  they're going to be that busy during the holidays, they're not going to put a newbie alone in the store. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6086.318">There's</a>  going to be somebody else in there that's hopefully TIP certified, that knows what they're doing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6092.863">But</a>  if the person's going to be hired, I don't know, a month before, two months before, then yeah, get them TIP certified. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6099.788">It's</a>  not a big deal.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6100.989">Sean,</a>  how would you address wagons, for example, the cashiers?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6106.287">Well,</a>  they haven't violated yet, done anything that we're going to require that.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6112.354">So</a>  it would be part of.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6115.513">just</a>  when there's a violation.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6117.154">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6118.014">Just,</a>  just if somebody, yeah, I think that's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6120.455">I</a>  just don't want to go back in time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6122.435">Well,</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6124.036">I</a>  would say, Oh yeah, you have to have every single person because running a business, I know you just can't have such a big turnover. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6131.278">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6131.578">But</a>  you're talking about this and infraction or something, but I think that getting, sorry, but the getting the scanner are investing in a scanner that could be part of a newsletter out to <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6142.481">all</a>  our package stores. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6143.722">Hey,</a>  that's the whole thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6145.423">You</a>  didn't hear it from us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6147.424">You</a>  heard, get a scanner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6149.626">There's</a>  lots of fake IDs out there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6151.907">I</a>  mean, they're rampant on the internet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6153.528">I</a>  believe that.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6154.369">Are</a>  they expensive?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6156.55">Is</a>  that why they don't have them because they're a lot? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6159.212">And</a>  I think the ones that, not 395, but Medford Wine and Spirits was a big money one that they pay a monthly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6169.169">I</a>  think it was, I don't know the amount, the cost. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6171.31">They</a>  gave us the number, the model and everything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6173.492">I</a>  never looked it up, but supposedly they have to pay a monthly fee as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6180.177">And</a>  the old one that they had was a less expensive one, and you could only put the license in one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6186.081">And</a>  if you got okayed or didn't get okayed, then you couldn't put it in again the same day for some reason. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6193.987">I</a>  don't know what he was talking about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6198.085">Yeah,</a>  it was crazy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6199.645">But</a>  when he upgraded to the new one, you could do it as much as you want.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6202.806">Well,</a>  if you don't want to get one, you can sell it to Wegmans. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6205.667">They'll</a>  pay you 500 grand. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6209.508">It's</a>  just cost of doing business. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6210.969">I</a>  don't really feel any kind of way about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6212.969">I</a>  think that the fees are so minuscule anyway that if you can't afford to run the business right, then don't run the business.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6220.271">I</a>  think you hit the nail on the head. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6222.252">Make</a>  it incorporated as part of the newsletter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6227.753">stating</a>  that this commission is requiring you to purchase one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6232.294">It's</a>  suggested, strongly suggested, something like that.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6237.835">Yeah,</a>  it's just, we'll figure out the wording on that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6240.876">But</a>  then you're right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6242.376">I</a>  mean, I look at the annual license for package stores, $1,500. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6245.677">I</a>  bet you that scanner's a lot more than that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6249.038">It</a>  is the cost of doing business.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6251.699">We'll</a>  work on those next.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6252.979">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6255.339">Give</a>  us something to work on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6258.441">Okay,</a>  so should we make a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6262.244">Sure,</a>  I motion to adjourn. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6264.306">What's</a>  that?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6264.726">I</a>  take that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6266.688">Catherine</a>  wanted to see if we could discuss it at the next meeting.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6273.094">For</a>  the scanner type thing? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6276.417">CHIP</a>  certified? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6282.397">No,</a>  we can discuss it, but I don't think we should mandate it, or is that what we have to discuss? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6287.618">Because</a>  I don't even know if we can mandate it.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6292.279">Yeah,</a>  I'm not for mandating it, no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6294.359">Yeah,</a>  I don't feel the same way.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6299.66">I</a>  mean, people that are doing the right thing, why put them through that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6305.521">If</a>  they start doing the wrong thing and there's violations, then, okay, now you mandate it, it doesn't count. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6312.988">from</a>  this point forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6313.888">I</a>  just think the team, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6316.17">Maybe</a>  it's just, because I'm looking at what everyone took after, and you just talked about how, just to discuss in general, the tips and also to implement a better process for the violation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6328.256">Because</a>  I remember being touched based on that.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6332.438">On</a>  the violence police reports?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6336.42">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6337.06">This</a>  violation, like, superb level of, so everybody's on the same page, what? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6343.018">Okay,</a>  it's going to be well, to be there or whatever the case.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6349.402">Yeah,</a>  well, like the suggestion from Ralph was anytime from this point forward, we get a report from the police department. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6357.587">That</a>  licensee is to be notified to appear. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6360.829">At</a>  the next commission meeting, along with the police. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6365.371">And</a>  the police can read the report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6368.125">We'll</a>  already have a copy of the report and at that point we can look at it and say, yeah, there was no chapter 138 violations here as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6378.673">And</a>  then you'll speak and you'll speak and okay, everybody's cool with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6382.556">And</a>  the police will say, yeah, it's a criminal matter or it's not a criminal matter or we felt as though there was no violations and then it's done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-01-15-25&start=6389.948">but</a>  we have to, whenever we're notified by the police, we have to follow through with it and have them come just like it's going to be a hammering.</p>
