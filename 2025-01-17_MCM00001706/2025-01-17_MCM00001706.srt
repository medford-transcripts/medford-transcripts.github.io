1
00:00:01,482 --> 00:00:08,183
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the city of mid fed license commission meeting, uh, for January 15th, 2025.

2
00:00:08,504 --> 00:00:12,284
[SPEAKER_12]: And it is 1 0 5 PM.

3
00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:17,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Can everybody hear me?

4
00:00:17,365 --> 00:00:22,807
[SPEAKER_08]: I can hear you.

5
00:00:22,827 --> 00:00:23,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

6
00:00:43,048 --> 00:00:45,830
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, we have an agenda to follow here.

7
00:00:51,474 --> 00:00:57,538
[SPEAKER_12]: First, we're going to go a little out of order with the agenda because we have a lot of minutes to approve.

8
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,583
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to review and approve those after the meeting as well as

9
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:13,045
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to take the representative from Mary Queen of Peace Parishes for the one-day application.

10
00:01:13,065 --> 00:01:15,287
[SPEAKER_12]: That's you, okay.

11
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:18,570
[SPEAKER_12]: Elena.

12
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, thank you so much.

13
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:22,252
[SPEAKER_12]: You're welcome.

14
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:23,674
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you today, Elena?

15
00:01:24,214 --> 00:01:25,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing wonderful.

16
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:27,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Excited for the new year.

17
00:01:28,237 --> 00:01:28,437
[SPEAKER_12]: Good.

18
00:01:29,198 --> 00:01:29,698
[SPEAKER_12]: Very good.

19
00:01:29,858 --> 00:01:30,379
[SPEAKER_12]: We all are.

20
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:33,962
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully it'll be just as good, if not better, as the last one.

21
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:35,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

22
00:01:35,646 --> 00:01:36,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I have good feelings about it.

23
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:38,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Good.

24
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:40,451
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

25
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:44,014
[SPEAKER_12]: You're here to apply for a one day license.

26
00:01:44,054 --> 00:01:46,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Would you be able to tell us a little about that, please?

27
00:01:47,402 --> 00:01:47,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

28
00:01:47,962 --> 00:01:51,065
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the same event that we ran last year.

29
00:01:51,085 --> 00:02:00,032
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it was, I shouldn't say to my surprise, but to my surprise, very successful speed dating event.

30
00:02:01,353 --> 00:02:12,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically it's rather simple event where people just come together and then they, everyone's in like a circle and then they rotate and they see if they like each other.

31
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:16,184
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after the speed dating, they get a little,

32
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:24,268
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like, it's kind of like an open time to just like mix and mingle with a little music and some drinks.

33
00:02:25,328 --> 00:02:27,229
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really it.

34
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:28,229
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty simple.

35
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,810
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's on a Saturday.

36
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,371
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in the afternoon.

37
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:34,971
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not really late, late at night.

38
00:02:35,852 --> 00:02:37,472
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been great for us.

39
00:02:37,512 --> 00:02:38,573
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're doing it again.

40
00:02:38,593 --> 00:02:38,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

41
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,914
[SPEAKER_12]: So it worked out pretty good last year for you.

42
00:02:42,394 --> 00:02:44,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we still have some couples dating.

43
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,421
[SPEAKER_12]: That's terrific.

44
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:47,662
[SPEAKER_04]: We're pretty thrilled about it.

45
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:50,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

46
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:55,551
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Father Shen's dream is to like have everyone marry each other from the church.

47
00:02:56,872 --> 00:02:58,434
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's great.

48
00:02:59,335 --> 00:02:59,655
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.

49
00:03:01,117 --> 00:03:01,397
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

50
00:03:01,797 --> 00:03:05,902
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just trying to pull that up here.

51
00:03:06,613 --> 00:03:11,776
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you'll see on the second page, Emily is one of our members who plans this event.

52
00:03:12,556 --> 00:03:15,037
[SPEAKER_04]: I just support her with like anything like this.

53
00:03:15,597 --> 00:03:18,079
[SPEAKER_04]: So the bar will just be placed in front of the kitchen.

54
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:20,780
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like a commercial kitchen type thing in there.

55
00:03:22,621 --> 00:03:28,244
[SPEAKER_04]: And so she'll just have one little table where she puts like some beers out or stuff like that.

56
00:03:28,304 --> 00:03:30,925
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, very good.

57
00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:34,767
[SPEAKER_12]: And Tammy, we have insurance on file with them.

58
00:03:37,573 --> 00:03:40,496
[SPEAKER_04]: We are waiting for that COI for that day.

59
00:03:40,516 --> 00:03:41,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm almost positive.

60
00:03:42,978 --> 00:03:44,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

61
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:53,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Father hooked them again this morning, the insurance company that we use, but we should have it by the end of the week.

62
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:54,730
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm on top of them about it.

63
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully we get it right away.

64
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:59,771
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a finance person left.

65
00:04:00,432 --> 00:04:02,174
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't have a finance person right now.

66
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:06,480
[SPEAKER_04]: So Father Hines is like dueling as also the financial coordinator.

67
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,644
[SPEAKER_04]: So things were a little slower than usual.

68
00:04:09,664 --> 00:04:10,865
[SPEAKER_12]: Got you.

69
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:12,167
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

70
00:04:14,532 --> 00:04:17,795
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I looked it over, it looks okay to me.

71
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:26,241
[SPEAKER_12]: There were no issues last year, so my fellow commissioners, if you have any comments or would like to speak about it.

72
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:27,262
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I agree.

73
00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:29,864
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's the same event.

74
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:35,308
[SPEAKER_11]: I really enjoyed the diagram they put right into the second page.

75
00:04:35,368 --> 00:04:37,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think that was the first.

76
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,410
[SPEAKER_00]: She's so cute.

77
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:40,001
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

78
00:04:40,982 --> 00:04:43,084
[SPEAKER_11]: So that gives us a good idea.

79
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:46,126
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've seen them on pizza boxes.

80
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:47,727
[SPEAKER_11]: We've seen them on paper bags.

81
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,889
[SPEAKER_11]: So that works for me.

82
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:50,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't find it.

83
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,391
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking everywhere for it.

84
00:04:52,431 --> 00:04:56,033
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I realized she put it in the document.

85
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:57,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Funny.

86
00:04:58,515 --> 00:04:59,116
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's pretty good.

87
00:04:59,596 --> 00:05:00,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks accurate.

88
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:05,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Chairman, if you don't mind, I'd like to make a motion to move this off the table.

89
00:05:05,052 --> 00:05:11,497
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, just if you want to include it with receiving the insurance.

90
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:12,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, sure.

91
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:25,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so I motion to accept the one-day license for the event called Speed Dating to be held on February 1st of this year from 3.30 to 10 p.m.

92
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:29,552
[SPEAKER_11]: conditioned upon receiving the liability insurance binder.

93
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,601
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll second that.

94
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:33,981
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

95
00:05:34,081 --> 00:05:34,822
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favor?

96
00:05:35,282 --> 00:05:35,422
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

97
00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:35,863
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

98
00:05:36,643 --> 00:05:37,384
[SPEAKER_12]: All those opposed?

99
00:05:38,344 --> 00:05:39,965
[SPEAKER_12]: Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it.

100
00:05:40,245 --> 00:05:41,967
[SPEAKER_12]: Your one day license is granted.

101
00:05:43,588 --> 00:05:44,768
[SPEAKER_12]: Congratulations, Elena.

102
00:05:44,808 --> 00:05:47,790
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope it's as successful as last year.

103
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:48,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Me too.

104
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:50,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much.

105
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:51,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Really appreciate it.

106
00:05:52,173 --> 00:05:52,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck.

107
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:53,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

108
00:05:57,538 --> 00:06:00,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, is that wrong?

109
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,940
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, that's fine.

110
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,362
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm good.

111
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:07,363
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, next item on the agenda.

112
00:06:16,368 --> 00:06:21,031
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see, representative from Arts Collaborative Medford, do we have someone here?

113
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,011
[SPEAKER_02]: That's me.

114
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:23,392
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, ready?

115
00:06:23,692 --> 00:06:23,972
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi.

116
00:06:24,232 --> 00:06:25,233
[SPEAKER_12]: Say, Regina?

117
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:26,426
[SPEAKER_03]: That's me.

118
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:32,159
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, Regina looks like we have three applications for one day licenses.

119
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:32,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

120
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,065
[SPEAKER_12]: If you'd like to just tell us a little bit about them.

121
00:06:35,914 --> 00:06:36,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure thing.

122
00:06:37,095 --> 00:06:40,336
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have been doing workshops and different performances in the space.

123
00:06:40,436 --> 00:06:45,018
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first one is so that we can hold a crafting and cinema night.

124
00:06:45,258 --> 00:06:54,563
[SPEAKER_03]: So people come in, they'll buy a craft from us, or they'll craft on what they want to, and we might just be able to serve some wine that evening, and we'll watch a fun movie.

125
00:06:54,603 --> 00:06:58,565
[SPEAKER_03]: That's on February 6th, which is a weekday evening.

126
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want me to go on to the next one, or do you want to talk on one by one?

127
00:07:02,186 --> 00:07:05,388
[SPEAKER_12]: No, we can do them all together if you like.

128
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,321
[SPEAKER_03]: So then the next one is a blues jam.

129
00:07:09,882 --> 00:07:11,482
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that we're starting up here.

130
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,784
[SPEAKER_03]: It was something that closed down when the porch closed down.

131
00:07:13,964 --> 00:07:16,845
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the person who was running it at the porch is now running it here.

132
00:07:16,885 --> 00:07:17,646
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually Hendrik.

133
00:07:17,766 --> 00:07:19,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I have him in the background.

134
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:23,769
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we just want to, again, be able to have a simple cash bar at that event.

135
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:28,991
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's very similar to the third one, which is live concerts that Hendrik does.

136
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:31,693
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a featured performer and it'll just be a simple cash bar.

137
00:07:33,438 --> 00:07:36,479
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, and the buyer is going to be in the same place at all three events?

138
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Same place at all three events.

139
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,961
[SPEAKER_03]: We always do it on one side of our gallery.

140
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:45,583
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, and do you have insurance on file with us?

141
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Daria should have it.

142
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:49,245
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

143
00:07:49,705 --> 00:07:49,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

144
00:07:51,326 --> 00:07:51,586
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

145
00:07:52,686 --> 00:07:54,927
[SPEAKER_12]: Daria, you have their insurance on file?

146
00:07:57,148 --> 00:07:57,928
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, great.

147
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:00,810
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I looked over.

148
00:08:02,463 --> 00:08:11,968
[SPEAKER_12]: The, the 3 applications, my fellow commissioners, if anything that you had noticed or seen on it that you may have question, I noticed that.

149
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:14,930
[SPEAKER_12]: You applied for all alcohol, which is fine.

150
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,351
[SPEAKER_12]: You're a nonprofit.

151
00:08:17,491 --> 00:08:19,453
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not an issue and.

152
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:27,006
[SPEAKER_12]: Other than the insurance, you know, I'm sure we have it on file where Darius says we did.

153
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,387
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fine with me.

154
00:08:29,228 --> 00:08:29,928
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys?

155
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Will it be all alcohol?

156
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:33,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Or just beer and wine?

157
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:36,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, it's probably going to be wine and beer.

158
00:08:38,056 --> 00:08:39,738
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't touched other alcohol.

159
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:42,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

160
00:08:42,761 --> 00:08:43,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Darius is curious.

161
00:08:44,363 --> 00:08:44,443
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

162
00:08:46,115 --> 00:08:50,298
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and I appreciate the professional design on the 3rd page.

163
00:08:50,338 --> 00:08:51,219
[SPEAKER_11]: That's very good.

164
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:53,280
[SPEAKER_11]: You can see how the door is swinging.

165
00:08:53,981 --> 00:08:56,763
[SPEAKER_11]: What direction then you appreciate that you do.

166
00:08:57,223 --> 00:08:58,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

167
00:08:58,164 --> 00:09:02,748
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the architectural drawing of our building.

168
00:09:03,368 --> 00:09:04,769
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you're muted.

169
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,433
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I don't have the questions.

170
00:09:09,473 --> 00:09:09,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's fine.

171
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,661
[SPEAKER_12]: The three of them.

172
00:09:19,803 --> 00:09:22,644
[SPEAKER_12]: We can lump them all together if you want to do them all at once.

173
00:09:22,684 --> 00:09:24,445
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine.

174
00:09:24,985 --> 00:09:43,115
[SPEAKER_11]: I motion to approve the three one-day license requests to be held on February 6th, February 9th, and February 20th for ACM, the Arts Collaborative in Medford, for their fundraising event.

175
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,642
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to second that, Ben?

176
00:09:49,344 --> 00:09:50,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'll second it.

177
00:09:51,486 --> 00:09:51,906
[SPEAKER_12]: All righty.

178
00:09:53,488 --> 00:09:54,269
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a second.

179
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:55,630
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favor?

180
00:09:56,131 --> 00:09:56,331
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

181
00:09:58,053 --> 00:09:59,174
[SPEAKER_12]: All those opposed?

182
00:10:01,857 --> 00:10:04,840
[SPEAKER_12]: Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it.

183
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:05,901
[SPEAKER_12]: You're all set.

184
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:07,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

185
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:08,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I ask one question?

186
00:10:08,648 --> 00:10:14,631
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to take up too much time, but Hendrick actually has his own nonprofit, but it just lives here.

187
00:10:15,112 --> 00:10:24,077
[SPEAKER_03]: So going forward, is it easier that all of the applications come through me because it's where it's happening, or should some of them, the ones that he's holding, come from him now?

188
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:34,586
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it may be advantageous for you to, if you can do it either way is fine, but you're only allowed 30 per year.

189
00:10:34,606 --> 00:10:35,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

190
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:49,877
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe if you start, you know, splitting them up and things like that, just so you don't go over the 30, you know, it's at your facility, but if he's running the event, you know, either way, it should be fine, you know, as long as there's insurance for it.

191
00:10:50,698 --> 00:10:55,021
[SPEAKER_12]: If he's going to put it under his name, he'll have to have the insurance and stuff like that as well.

192
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

193
00:10:56,492 --> 00:10:56,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

194
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:57,796
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that was my question.

195
00:10:57,836 --> 00:10:58,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys so much.

196
00:10:59,682 --> 00:11:00,043
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

197
00:11:00,384 --> 00:11:00,765
[SPEAKER_12]: Good luck.

198
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a great rest of your day.

199
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:03,233
[SPEAKER_12]: You too.

200
00:12:28,545 --> 00:12:29,646
[SPEAKER_12]: Should be a little louder now.

201
00:12:33,108 --> 00:12:35,109
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, let's see what's next on the agenda.

202
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:38,672
[SPEAKER_12]: And I took care of that.

203
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:49,339
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, we have a representative from El Tacuba presenting for an entertainment license for your establishment on 35 Salem Street in Medford.

204
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:53,081
[SPEAKER_12]: Alvaro, how are you?

205
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,084
[SPEAKER_12]: You can take your red thing off mute, Alvaro.

206
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:02,830
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.

207
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,651
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?

208
00:13:04,671 --> 00:13:04,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi everyone.

209
00:13:06,031 --> 00:13:06,711
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, how are you?

210
00:13:07,251 --> 00:13:07,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.

211
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:07,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

212
00:13:09,252 --> 00:13:10,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, it's good.

213
00:13:10,052 --> 00:13:13,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me get this turned up even more.

214
00:13:13,332 --> 00:13:13,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

215
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:14,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

216
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,253
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, tell us what you're doing Elvaro.

217
00:13:17,373 --> 00:13:20,554
[SPEAKER_12]: You got an application for a, uh, entertainment license.

218
00:13:22,395 --> 00:13:23,175
[SPEAKER_12]: What are your plans?

219
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:28,616
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's just for the, um, for the music that we play at the restaurant.

220
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,915
[SPEAKER_00]: the TVs that they already in place.

221
00:13:32,655 --> 00:13:41,162
[SPEAKER_00]: And just in case if we ever gonna have maybe a mariachi one night, who knows?

222
00:13:41,182 --> 00:13:44,284
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

223
00:13:44,304 --> 00:13:44,524
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

224
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:49,988
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's just a basic entertainment license mostly for the TVs.

225
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:53,871
[SPEAKER_12]: And it also covers if you want to do a mariachi or...

226
00:13:55,707 --> 00:13:57,709
[SPEAKER_00]: Sing along or whatever you want to do.

227
00:13:58,149 --> 00:13:59,150
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do it.

228
00:13:59,190 --> 00:13:59,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

229
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:00,852
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

230
00:14:01,192 --> 00:14:02,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Barbara, how many TVs?

231
00:14:03,214 --> 00:14:05,296
[SPEAKER_11]: It just says TVs at the bottom.

232
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:06,858
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two TVs in the back.

233
00:14:07,698 --> 00:14:08,039
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

234
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:09,680
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

235
00:14:10,441 --> 00:14:12,703
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, you can have up to 10 devices.

236
00:14:12,783 --> 00:14:17,408
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can have a stereo system or whatever as well.

237
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:25,133
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like everything's in order as far as all the inspections that had to be signed off.

238
00:14:27,254 --> 00:14:28,595
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have an issue with this.

239
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:30,537
[SPEAKER_12]: Everything looks good to me.

240
00:14:31,077 --> 00:14:36,100
[SPEAKER_12]: My fellow commissioners, I'm sure you've had a chance to look over the application.

241
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,662
[SPEAKER_12]: If you'd like to comment.

242
00:14:39,483 --> 00:14:44,526
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, I thank them for waiting to get everybody to sign off on this.

243
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:50,794
[SPEAKER_11]: It's easier to approve it rather than having to make a condition.

244
00:14:50,815 --> 00:14:53,856
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got to go chase after another inspection.

245
00:14:54,036 --> 00:14:55,397
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm good with this.

246
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:57,237
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

247
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:58,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Ben?

248
00:14:58,578 --> 00:14:59,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, me too.

249
00:14:59,158 --> 00:15:02,640
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like it's been getting it signed off since October.

250
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,581
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, you did all the work.

251
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:08,242
[SPEAKER_08]: And it sounds fine.

252
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,263
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're below the threshold anyway.

253
00:15:10,303 --> 00:15:11,684
[SPEAKER_08]: So no issues at all.

254
00:15:12,264 --> 00:15:13,485
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, great.

255
00:15:14,165 --> 00:15:16,266
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, if one of you gentlemen would like to make the motion.

256
00:15:17,987 --> 00:15:20,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I can do it.

257
00:15:20,448 --> 00:15:47,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I'm going to make a motion to approve the application for entertainment license for El Tecuba, Hosina and Tequila Bar, manager on record Alvaro Sandoval, based on the approvals of all of our city departments that were seen in this application.

258
00:15:48,578 --> 00:15:48,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

259
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:50,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

260
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:51,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Alan, would you second it?

261
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'll second that motion.

262
00:15:54,001 --> 00:15:54,301

[SPEAKER_12]: Alvaro, good luck with your entertainment.

270
00:16:04,788 --> 00:16:05,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

271
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:07,489
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all.

272
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:09,410
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

273
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:09,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, next on the agenda, we have, uh, do we have a representative from ocean state job lot?

00:16:25,153 --> 00:16:25,393
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

279
00:16:25,413 --> 00:16:27,234
[SPEAKER_12]: This has been going on a few months, right?

280
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:27,535
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

281
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:28,255
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

282
00:16:29,436 --> 00:16:33,218
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so do we just table this next till next month?

283
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:34,218
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

284
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:36,560
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't need to make a motion for that.

285
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:36,840
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we?

286
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,280
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

287
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:37,900
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

288
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,322
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a change in managing, right?

289
00:16:41,723 --> 00:16:41,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

290
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:42,343

[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, do we have representatives from Main Street Liquors?

00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:01,750
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

299
00:17:02,511 --> 00:17:09,516
[SPEAKER_12]: What we're going to do at this point is start the hearing for Main Street Liquors and

300
00:17:13,894 --> 00:17:16,476
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me back up just a little bit.

[SPEAKER_12]: The chair will read the January 8th, 2025 hand-delivered notice to appear before this commission for the record.

313
00:18:57,925 --> 00:19:00,587
[SPEAKER_12]: Next, I will ask who is present.

314
00:19:01,735 --> 00:19:18,342
[SPEAKER_12]: on behalf of the Medford Police Department, and who is present on behalf of the licensee, and whether there are any other individuals with firsthand knowledge of the alleged to testify, and I will then swear in all parties.

315
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:35,430
[SPEAKER_12]: The first of the four allegations in the police report will be read into the record by Medford Police, who may also present any evidence pertaining to the alleged violation at that time.

316
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:50,397
[SPEAKER_12]: Following the Medford Police, the licensee or their representative will have the opportunity to make a brief statement, followed by any other individuals with firsthand knowledge of the alleged to testify.

317
00:19:52,101 --> 00:19:56,224
[SPEAKER_12]: The commissioners and chair will then have the opportunity to ask questions.

318
00:19:58,505 --> 00:20:06,671
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll then move on to the second, third, and fourth alleged violations following the same format as the first alleged violations.

319
00:20:08,232 --> 00:20:15,797
[SPEAKER_12]: All testimony will be limited only to those individuals with firsthand personal knowledge of the alleged incident.

320
00:20:17,464 --> 00:20:27,691
[SPEAKER_12]: The four separate incidents are all for the sale of alcoholic beverages to persons under 21 years of age, a violation of Mass General Law 138, section 34.

321
00:20:30,574 --> 00:20:33,496
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there any questions regarding the procedural matters?

322
00:20:33,516 --> 00:20:37,839
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

323
00:20:49,168 --> 00:20:56,571
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to read the January 8th, 2025 hand-delivered notice to appear before this commission for the record.

00:22:49,581 --> 00:22:51,522

00:22:58,026 --> 00:23:02,409
[SPEAKER_12]: Officer Smith, are you presenting on behalf of the Medford Police Department?

00:23:14,877 --> 00:23:17,439
[SPEAKER_12]: On behalf of 395 Main Street.

00:23:20,341 --> 00:23:22,062
[SPEAKER_12]: Are all four going to be speaking?

342
00:23:23,323 --> 00:23:26,485
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, okay.

343
00:23:29,227 --> 00:23:31,429
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there anyone else that's going to be speaking?

344
00:23:33,008 --> 00:23:36,410
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you have a lawyer or clerks or anybody else?

345
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,351
[SPEAKER_12]: No, okay.

00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:42,253

00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,482
[SPEAKER_12]: Officer Smith, would you be able to read the first allegation?

350
00:24:01,365 --> 00:24:02,825
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, that's fine.

351
00:24:03,486 --> 00:24:05,647
[SPEAKER_12]: You could just speak up so everybody could hear.

352
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:14,773
[SPEAKER_12]: Want me to turn my thing so I can?

353
00:24:14,793 --> 00:24:15,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

354
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:26,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see if I can get you in a picture here.

355
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,221
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, he's already in there.

356
00:24:27,641 --> 00:24:28,302
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, he is?

357
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:28,542
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

358
00:24:28,742 --> 00:24:28,922
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

359
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think it's, oh, okay.

360
00:24:33,211 --> 00:24:33,532
[SPEAKER_11]: How's that?

361
00:24:33,552 --> 00:24:33,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

362
00:25:01,285 --> 00:25:02,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, we'll try it.

363
00:25:03,426 --> 00:25:05,108
[SPEAKER_06]: For the record, my name is Patrick Smith.

364
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:10,711
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a police officer in the city of Medford, also a liquor agent for the City of Medford Liquor Licensing Commission.

365
00:25:12,692 --> 00:25:22,839
[SPEAKER_06]: I wrote a report inside the report that was a juvenile to protect the identity of the juvenile, that juvenile's name, and identifying information will not be provided.

366
00:25:23,219 --> 00:25:28,563
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on file at my police department, but for legal purposes, I can't release that information because it involves a juvenile.

367
00:25:30,925 --> 00:25:46,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, on December 8th, oh, December 9th, 2024, I spoke with Officer Robin Pascantelli of the Medford Police Department in regards to Medford High School students purchasing liquor from Main Street Liquor Mart located at 395 Main Street in Medford.

368
00:25:47,196 --> 00:25:52,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Should be noted that Officer Pascantelli is a school resource officer assigned to Medford High School.

369
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:58,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Officer Pascantelli had direct contact with students that informed him Main Street Liquor Mart sold liquor to persons under the age of 21.

370
00:26:00,441 --> 00:26:11,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I spoke to Lieutenant Lockowitz regarding this matter, spoke to Captain Cabino, and Captain Cabino authorized Port Town to conduct a separate investigation.

371
00:26:12,335 --> 00:26:17,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Due to scheduling conflicts and implementing weather, my investigation was delayed several weeks.

372
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:26,780
[SPEAKER_06]: On Friday, January 3rd, 2025, I traveled to Main Street, Lickomah to observe how business was being conducted.

373
00:26:27,081 --> 00:26:28,762
[SPEAKER_06]: I wore a full Medford police uniform.

374
00:26:28,842 --> 00:26:30,644
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same uniform that I'm wearing in today.

375
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:40,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I operated an unmarked Medford police vehicle, and I parked directly next to the MMA studio that is adjacent to Main Street, Lickomah.

376
00:26:42,814 --> 00:26:45,296
[SPEAKER_06]: I began my observations approximately at 7.45 p.m.

377
00:26:47,728 --> 00:26:49,609
[SPEAKER_06]: and we'll go into the first allegation.

378
00:26:51,389 --> 00:26:58,672
[SPEAKER_06]: At approximately 8.10 p.m., an observer would appear to be a young individual entering Main Street Liquor Mart.

379
00:26:59,372 --> 00:27:06,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Based on the individual's physical characteristics, I believe the individual to be approximately 18 years of age.

380
00:27:06,975 --> 00:27:16,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Several minutes after entering Main Street Liquor Mart, the individual exited the business carrying an 18-pack of Bud Light Lime and an 8-pack of Neutral Vodka Seltzer.

381
00:27:17,854 --> 00:27:21,296
[SPEAKER_06]: The individual proceeded to walk south on Main Street towards William Street.

382
00:27:21,316 --> 00:27:26,259
[SPEAKER_06]: At that time, I drove the unmarked vehicle onto William Street, and I exited the vehicle.

383
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:32,642
[SPEAKER_06]: I approached this individual and asked them how old they were, and they responded that they were 17 years old.

384
00:27:33,603 --> 00:27:38,946
[SPEAKER_06]: I recognize this individual from a previous liquor investigation, and know this individual to be 17 years old.

385
00:27:41,764 --> 00:27:50,269
[SPEAKER_06]: I asked the 17-year-old how he was able to purchase the alcohol, and he informed me that he utilized a fake New Hampshire driver's license.

386
00:27:51,829 --> 00:27:57,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Upon seeing the New Hampshire driver's license, I determined that it was, in fact, fraudulent.

387
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,174
[SPEAKER_06]: It was abnormally thick, and the overall quality was poor.

388
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:08,178
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the same exact fake ID that the person used during that previous investigation.

389
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:23,200
[SPEAKER_06]: I explained to him, or I explained to the juvenile that I would be seizing the fake ID, and that I would be seizing the alcohol, and that I would be following up with his parents.

390
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:30,981
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the second time in two months that I've observed this juvenile purchasing the liquor through his fraudulent driver's license.

391
00:28:31,821 --> 00:28:41,623
[SPEAKER_06]: A criminal complaint was sought against the juvenile in Cambridge Juvenile Court for minorization of alcohol and procuring alcoholic beverages by false representation.

392
00:28:43,467 --> 00:28:51,931
[SPEAKER_06]: The criminal charge of procuring alcohol beverages by false representation is for the juvenile using a fraudulent prevention driver's license to purchase the alcohol.

393
00:28:52,652 --> 00:29:00,556
[SPEAKER_06]: If the commission would like to see the ID that the person used, it's the same one that they used back in the day.

394
00:29:01,356 --> 00:29:02,637
[SPEAKER_06]: So a little follow-up for him.

395
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:08,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Since then, in the last two weeks, I've gone to everyone else's house twice.

396
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,340
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met with their parents twice.

397
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,582
[SPEAKER_06]: I've met with him and explained the ramifications.

398
00:29:14,182 --> 00:29:15,463
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a good conversation.

399
00:29:15,483 --> 00:29:22,206
[SPEAKER_06]: I said that the last time in November, but this time there is pending criminal charges in court for this.

400
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:29,772
[SPEAKER_06]: I told them that the next time it'll be another level.

401
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:34,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said in the previous meetings, this was the second step for us.

402
00:29:35,516 --> 00:29:41,782
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Officer Gascantilli was the school resource officer that was made responsible for this specific problem.

403
00:29:42,983 --> 00:29:45,945
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the extent of the first application.

404
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:47,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, great.

405
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:49,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

406
00:29:49,328 --> 00:29:52,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want me to step back?

407
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we'll give the

408
00:29:56,735 --> 00:30:01,598
[SPEAKER_09]: For the folks from Trinidad, I appreciate the opportunity to speak at this time.

409
00:30:06,101 --> 00:30:07,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Good afternoon.

410
00:30:08,002 --> 00:30:10,824
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Satish Kumar.

411
00:30:12,325 --> 00:30:20,130
[SPEAKER_11]: I was working on the data and the guy came to me and they showed me their IDs, usually like a chip.

412
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,151
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not using that chip all the time.

413
00:30:23,212 --> 00:30:23,932
[SPEAKER_11]: We send them back.

414
00:30:23,952 --> 00:30:26,033
[SPEAKER_11]: So on that day, unfortunately, I don't have the scanner.

415
00:30:26,053 --> 00:30:28,614
[SPEAKER_11]: So after that, we actually bought the scanner on the same day.

416
00:30:28,654 --> 00:30:29,235
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we have it.

417
00:30:29,275 --> 00:30:30,175
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody's ID, everything.

418
00:30:30,976 --> 00:30:31,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Scan it.

419
00:30:50,727 --> 00:30:54,911
[SPEAKER_11]: But they were standing there, they don't know, so we already spoke to the office, they said like if they

420
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:07,370
[SPEAKER_11]: try to say some things, you can give it back, just don't keep it, don't create a scene or something.

421
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:13,011
[SPEAKER_11]: So on that day, the guy, the officer mentioned, he's like 17 or something.

422
00:31:13,391 --> 00:31:24,495
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a lot of guys that came in the same time, he make me panic, like, oh, I have a way, this and that, this is totally my mistake, I apologize for that, I apologize to the officer too.

423
00:31:24,595 --> 00:31:28,956
[SPEAKER_11]: When he came, he was like, there was a way to the police,

424
00:31:29,636 --> 00:31:33,539
[SPEAKER_11]: And they were like showing the IDs to me, they're holding the hands.

425
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:40,165
[SPEAKER_11]: Same thing at other offices, like you have to hold the ID, you have to check, you have to go through it.

426
00:31:40,405 --> 00:31:45,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Now when we, the testing scene had happened on that day with me.

427
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:52,315
[SPEAKER_11]: So those people came in and after that now, like the same thing.

428
00:31:52,675 --> 00:31:56,098
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not like even the scanner we have it, so we don't know.

429
00:31:56,598 --> 00:32:03,983
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't do, like, on the scanner, the scanners are like, on the scanner, there's a message right there.

430
00:32:04,184 --> 00:32:06,425
[SPEAKER_11]: There's another screen, basically.

431
00:32:07,006 --> 00:32:09,828
[SPEAKER_11]: So when the message is there, you have to face-to-face.

432
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:12,610
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to see how their eyes are reacting, how they're reacting.

433
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,711
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's what we do.

434
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:22,237
[SPEAKER_11]: The incident that happened on that day was like, he, the guy, confused me so much.

435
00:32:22,297 --> 00:32:24,399
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know who spoke, but the guy explained a lot.

436
00:32:25,363 --> 00:32:31,788
[SPEAKER_11]: gentleman was there I tell him like I did a big mistake on that day because like he was panning.

437
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:39,013
[SPEAKER_11]: I really apologize for that.

438
00:32:39,093 --> 00:32:42,355
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not personal because I have someone's image so I feel sorry.

439
00:32:47,728 --> 00:32:49,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you ever seen him before?

440
00:32:49,388 --> 00:32:52,949
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this is the first time I've seen him.

441
00:32:52,969 --> 00:32:55,450
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the first time this individual ever came?

442
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, he does trust me.

443
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:57,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

444
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:02,331
[SPEAKER_11]: And so it's the first time or something in New Hampshire?

445
00:33:02,371 --> 00:33:02,691
[SPEAKER_02]: License?

446
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:06,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I usually refuse most of them.

447
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:09,253
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, I tell them actually I can take them.

448
00:33:10,996 --> 00:33:13,317
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the new scanner arrived on the 5th and is that installed?

449
00:33:13,337 --> 00:33:14,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's already published.

450
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:15,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's just one quick second.

451
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:41,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but that's the way he's speaking.

452
00:33:41,224 --> 00:33:42,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

453
00:33:43,305 --> 00:33:44,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

454
00:33:44,946 --> 00:33:46,046
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be all right.

455
00:33:46,106 --> 00:33:46,767
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it is.

456
00:33:46,947 --> 00:33:47,447
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

457
00:33:47,907 --> 00:33:48,247
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

458
00:33:48,407 --> 00:33:49,208
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

459
00:33:49,268 --> 00:33:49,848
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

460
00:33:49,888 --> 00:33:51,629
[SPEAKER_12]: A little technical difficulties here.

461
00:33:58,772 --> 00:34:04,995
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have any questions for Mr. Lam on the first alleged

462
00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:07,370
[SPEAKER_11]: violation.

463
00:34:08,431 --> 00:34:10,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Just so just so I'm hearing it correctly.

464
00:34:10,373 --> 00:34:14,438
[SPEAKER_08]: So somebody had one lottery at the same time.

465
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:15,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's the distracting.

466
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,402
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the distraction you're talking about.

467
00:34:19,512 --> 00:34:41,228
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah actually he was he came in before so he gave me the login ticket and the same i have like three four people in the line same time okay so i checked their id just like they pulled out their wallet they just like show me like this i checked the a's everything then and they they was like wearing the booties on the inside

468
00:34:41,768 --> 00:34:47,653
[SPEAKER_11]: even usually somebody come in, I usually tell them like, please, please take your hoodies off.

469
00:34:47,893 --> 00:34:48,994
[SPEAKER_11]: This is your inside out.

470
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:49,595
[SPEAKER_11]: It's okay.

471
00:34:50,275 --> 00:34:58,722
[SPEAKER_11]: But on that day, he was he gave me the lottery and then he said like, okay, he's like, he would like those things.

472
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Because he bring like a bunch of tickets with him.

473
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:03,627
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, but

474
00:35:14,835 --> 00:35:15,195
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

475
00:35:17,275 --> 00:35:17,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

476
00:35:18,155 --> 00:35:19,155
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

477
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:20,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

478
00:35:21,356 --> 00:35:23,876
[SPEAKER_12]: All righty.

479
00:35:24,796 --> 00:35:29,837
[SPEAKER_12]: Officer Smith, would you care to read the second alleged violation, please?

480
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,739
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first violation is the 810.

481
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,919
[SPEAKER_06]: This is at 8.40 p.m.

482
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, I'm wearing my full uniform.

483
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:52,604
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sitting in an unmarked car, again, in front of the next part of the studio, the next floor.

484
00:35:53,905 --> 00:36:00,069
[SPEAKER_06]: I observe a young male enter Main Street Liquor Mart based on the male's physical characteristics.

485
00:36:00,689 --> 00:36:03,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe him to be approximately 18 years of age.

486
00:36:03,971 --> 00:36:09,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Several minutes after entering, he exited the business carrying a 12-pack of Poor's Light,

487
00:36:09,995 --> 00:36:16,118
[SPEAKER_06]: And in that eight pack of sun and pressure iced tea vodka, he then proceeded to walk towards Wareham Street.

488
00:36:16,498 --> 00:36:21,941
[SPEAKER_06]: I then drove on to Wareham Street, exited my unmarked vehicle, approached him, and I asked him how old he was.

489
00:36:22,701 --> 00:36:25,663
[SPEAKER_06]: He stated that he was 19 years of age.

490
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:33,647
[SPEAKER_06]: I asked him how he was able to purchase the alcohol, and he stated he had a fake Massachusetts driver's license, which allowed him to buy the alcohol.

491
00:36:34,307 --> 00:36:35,448
[SPEAKER_06]: He handed me the fake

492
00:36:36,468 --> 00:36:40,372
[SPEAKER_06]: the fake ID, I told him the ID will be seized, the alcohol will be seized.

493
00:36:41,213 --> 00:36:46,738
[SPEAKER_06]: And that body was positively identified as Joseph Mangone.

494
00:36:46,758 --> 00:36:48,840
[SPEAKER_06]: He is 19 years of age.

495
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:57,688
[SPEAKER_06]: And due to this being the first offense with me and the liquor agents, he was let off.

496
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,651
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought we had a positive interaction.

497
00:37:01,884 --> 00:37:06,186
[SPEAKER_06]: We apologize for the incident.

498
00:37:06,946 --> 00:37:08,607
[SPEAKER_06]: The commission would like to see his fake ID.

499
00:37:08,647 --> 00:37:11,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's just an alias.

500
00:37:18,031 --> 00:37:19,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

501
00:37:19,131 --> 00:37:20,772
[SPEAKER_02]: And let me input.

502
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,238
[SPEAKER_06]: specifically goes on that idea of wall frames.

503
00:37:34,638 --> 00:37:35,578
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, non-existent.

504
00:37:35,618 --> 00:37:36,499
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it is non-existent.

505
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:37,019
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

506
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:38,859
[SPEAKER_06]: It's certainly not the worst I've ever seen.

507
00:37:38,939 --> 00:37:39,899
[SPEAKER_06]: It's bad.

508
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:40,699
[SPEAKER_06]: It is bad.

509
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:43,400
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's certainly not the worst I've seen.

510
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:43,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

511
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:46,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you see, with the real ones, it should be able to fit.

512
00:37:58,978 --> 00:38:02,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the hologram is like, it's dense.

513
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:10,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I kind of agree, not the worst, I mean, but, you look at it, it's bad.

514
00:38:11,203 --> 00:38:14,664
[SPEAKER_06]: It's bad when you look at it, you have a little one right beside it.

515
00:38:14,724 --> 00:38:15,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's it.

516
00:38:15,464 --> 00:38:17,045
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can't hold these on a regular basis.

517
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:18,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's just bad.

518
00:38:18,806 --> 00:38:20,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, regular mists.

519
00:38:21,527 --> 00:38:24,928
[SPEAKER_06]: So as alcohol was seized, it's a lot too thick, I think it was seized.

520
00:38:26,127 --> 00:38:27,448
[SPEAKER_06]: we had a good possible decision.

521
00:38:27,988 --> 00:38:31,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully, we won't have them again.

522
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:31,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

523
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:32,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Second violation.

524
00:38:34,092 --> 00:38:35,172
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

525
00:38:36,173 --> 00:38:41,156
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there anybody from 395 Main Street that would care to comment on the second violation?

526
00:38:43,473 --> 00:38:48,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, my name is Chetan Ratan, and I'm replying as Mr. Lekharnam.

527
00:38:49,697 --> 00:38:52,719
[SPEAKER_05]: What I want to show you is the fighting.

528
00:38:52,879 --> 00:38:56,841
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like a real, so we are a little bit confused for that.

529
00:38:57,221 --> 00:39:02,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the time, me and my brother were there, but on that day, my brother was only there.

530
00:39:02,224 --> 00:39:04,686
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were a little confused for that.

531
00:39:05,226 --> 00:39:09,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Raj shows the video like that way, not giving his hand.

532
00:39:09,489 --> 00:39:11,750
[SPEAKER_05]: So we never saw this kind of fighting.

533
00:39:13,102 --> 00:39:17,406
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are in this business for almost 14 years.

534
00:39:18,187 --> 00:39:20,169
[SPEAKER_05]: And we apologize for that mistake.

535
00:39:20,269 --> 00:39:25,453
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we've got a scanner, so we're going to take my commitment that I'll be single-minded.

536
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:29,377
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, can I ask you a question?

537
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:31,319
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you receive the scanner?

538
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:31,919
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

539
00:39:32,299 --> 00:39:33,460
[SPEAKER_12]: And you have been using it?

540
00:39:33,701 --> 00:39:33,921
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

541
00:39:34,862 --> 00:39:37,024
[SPEAKER_12]: And has it been pretty accurate?

542
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you getting good results?

543
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:52,904
[SPEAKER_05]: We check like a different way, not like, just to be not stuck on the scanner only, but we also check this personally, like the picture, the match face, eyes, so the site will make sure that they're real.

544
00:39:54,384 --> 00:39:57,985
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, and I'd like to ask you another question.

545
00:39:58,005 --> 00:40:00,346
[SPEAKER_12]: Have the employees been TIP certified?

546
00:40:00,906 --> 00:40:01,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

547
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:02,066
[SPEAKER_12]: They have?

548
00:40:02,186 --> 00:40:02,406
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

549
00:40:03,007 --> 00:40:08,348
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so you know that accepting any type of out-of-state

550
00:40:09,165 --> 00:40:11,586
[SPEAKER_12]: ID and driver's license is not accepted.

551
00:40:11,626 --> 00:40:12,327
[SPEAKER_12]: North record.

552
00:40:14,568 --> 00:40:18,050
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I believe the first one was an out-of-statement.

553
00:40:19,371 --> 00:40:21,952
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I just wanted to ask you that.

554
00:40:22,352 --> 00:40:27,015
[SPEAKER_11]: Question, did you say he's never seen a license like that?

555
00:40:27,295 --> 00:40:28,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what you were saying?

556
00:40:28,956 --> 00:40:31,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a message or something?

557
00:40:31,437 --> 00:40:31,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

558
00:40:31,697 --> 00:40:32,678
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked like a savior.

559
00:40:32,738 --> 00:40:33,919
[SPEAKER_05]: I never saw this guy in it.

560
00:40:39,918 --> 00:40:49,643
[SPEAKER_05]: And also show me, let's see, you can see that particular things in the license, the color, and the paper, and the logo inside.

561
00:40:49,683 --> 00:40:52,664
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we are very careful for that.

562
00:40:52,985 --> 00:40:53,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

563
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:56,686
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know, when you look at that particular license, it just looks like a problem.

564
00:40:57,367 --> 00:40:58,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's a problem.

565
00:40:58,547 --> 00:41:07,072
[SPEAKER_11]: Should, you know, they, whoever looked at it, should have, Red Flag should have not seen hundreds and hundreds of the railroads.

566
00:41:07,712 --> 00:41:07,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

567
00:41:09,093 --> 00:41:09,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

568
00:41:17,991 --> 00:41:24,175
[SPEAKER_12]: Gary, you might have to let me back in.

569
00:41:27,557 --> 00:41:36,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think what we're all thinking is, it seems unlikely we'd never have seen an ID like that, being a fake Massachusetts ID.

570
00:41:39,326 --> 00:41:47,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sir, but like, I do not recognize this kind of body, like, look like, because my brother is holding his hand, because he go like that.

571
00:41:47,788 --> 00:41:52,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully, maybe holding hand, then we can see that, but like, you know what I'm saying?

572
00:41:52,529 --> 00:41:54,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, no idea.

573
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you wear a tip or not, Nick?

574
00:41:56,591 --> 00:42:00,552
[SPEAKER_05]: No, from that time, no.

575
00:42:02,452 --> 00:42:05,573
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're, you know, being TIP certified helps you identify

576
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, in the proper way to check IDs.

577
00:42:14,447 --> 00:42:18,210
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you talk, what did you say?

578
00:42:19,812 --> 00:42:26,938
[SPEAKER_11]: I was preoccupied, I didn't notice, I was distracted, I was, what was, why?

579
00:42:27,398 --> 00:42:31,382
[SPEAKER_11]: As they say, slip by the rule, you might have had a curve.

580
00:42:32,493 --> 00:42:44,197
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like my brother-in-law is a strategist, so like the lottery guy and the guy, so that's why he doesn't see the idea from the background that I'm more technically late.

581
00:42:44,217 --> 00:42:44,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

582
00:42:44,538 --> 00:42:45,938
[SPEAKER_05]: But we apologize for that.

583
00:42:45,958 --> 00:42:47,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, we understand.

584
00:42:54,509 --> 00:42:56,811
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have any other questions, Mr. Chairman.

585
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:58,793
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

586
00:42:59,634 --> 00:43:00,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

587
00:43:00,074 --> 00:43:00,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, sir.

588
00:43:00,715 --> 00:43:01,035
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, sir.

589
00:43:01,395 --> 00:43:09,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Officer Smith, would you like to read the third alleged violation?

590
00:43:09,802 --> 00:43:13,806
[SPEAKER_06]: With the commission's permission, I'd like to kind of combine three and four.

591
00:43:14,086 --> 00:43:15,707
[SPEAKER_06]: The two bodies went in together.

592
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:19,090
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's important in the stories that I received from Baltimore.

593
00:43:19,551 --> 00:43:19,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

594
00:43:21,362 --> 00:43:24,486
[SPEAKER_06]: So that second violation was at 8.40 p.m.

595
00:43:24,867 --> 00:43:34,000
[SPEAKER_06]: This is now... At that time, I observed two young males in a mainstream lick-a-mat, based on both males' physical characteristics.

596
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:37,044
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe the males to be approximately 18 years of age.

597
00:43:38,268 --> 00:43:41,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Several minutes after entering, we had Stanley come out.

598
00:43:41,131 --> 00:43:44,254
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the males exited the business carrying a 24-pack of blight.

599
00:43:44,834 --> 00:43:46,856
[SPEAKER_06]: He proceeded to walk towards Wareham Street.

600
00:43:46,876 --> 00:43:49,219
[SPEAKER_06]: He went, he exited the store by himself.

601
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:52,081
[SPEAKER_06]: The other person was still up at the counter.

602
00:43:52,382 --> 00:43:57,246
[SPEAKER_06]: What I didn't want to happen is somebody get in a car, drive away, or, you know, then just split up.

603
00:43:57,486 --> 00:44:00,930
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew that person was young, so I wanted to make contact with that body first.

604
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:06,152
[SPEAKER_06]: So I drove on to Wareham Street, I exited the vehicle, approached the man, asked him how old he was.

605
00:44:06,773 --> 00:44:07,993
[SPEAKER_06]: He told me that he was 20.

606
00:44:08,634 --> 00:44:14,497
[SPEAKER_06]: He produced a real driver's license that identified him as Nicholas Pascarella.

607
00:44:14,817 --> 00:44:16,018
[SPEAKER_06]: He is 20 years old.

608
00:44:16,818 --> 00:44:27,083
[SPEAKER_06]: I asked him, initially I asked him how he was able to purchase the alcohol, and he told me that he used a fake Massachusetts driver's license, which I have right here.

609
00:44:27,103 --> 00:44:28,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me show the connection.

610
00:44:32,605 --> 00:44:36,272
[SPEAKER_08]: He explained to me that he used that to make the purchase.

611
00:44:43,294 --> 00:44:46,516
[SPEAKER_06]: So I told him that the alcohol and the fake ID were seized.

612
00:44:46,556 --> 00:44:47,977
[SPEAKER_06]: This was our first interaction.

613
00:44:48,057 --> 00:44:50,078
[SPEAKER_06]: So he was let go with a warning.

614
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:52,840
[SPEAKER_06]: I stood with him in the car.

615
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,901
[SPEAKER_06]: He anticipated his friend to return.

616
00:44:54,921 --> 00:44:59,464
[SPEAKER_06]: His friend did not return because he saw me talking to his buddy.

617
00:45:00,585 --> 00:45:01,926
[SPEAKER_06]: And he crossed the street.

618
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:03,647
[SPEAKER_06]: So then I looked for him.

619
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:04,947
[SPEAKER_06]: I went around the corner, saw him.

620
00:45:05,027 --> 00:45:07,389
[SPEAKER_06]: I motioned that maybe we had a conversation.

621
00:45:09,558 --> 00:45:12,660
[SPEAKER_06]: He was able to purchase a 12-pack of Pacifica beer.

622
00:45:13,521 --> 00:45:21,366
[SPEAKER_06]: He admitted to making the purchase, and then he actually hid it in the entryway of 399 Main Street, which is rampant towards Queensland.

623
00:45:21,526 --> 00:45:23,407
[SPEAKER_06]: He retrieved the alcohol, came back over.

624
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:25,388
[SPEAKER_06]: I asked him how he was able to make the purchase.

625
00:45:26,049 --> 00:45:27,270
[SPEAKER_06]: He said that he was never ID'd.

626
00:45:28,188 --> 00:45:33,216
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I explained to him that there's obviously video cameras inside of Evercool, and so I'm going to be going back in.

627
00:45:33,236 --> 00:45:34,117
[SPEAKER_06]: I want honesty.

628
00:45:34,758 --> 00:45:36,280
[SPEAKER_06]: And he goes, oh, no, absolutely not.

629
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,045
[SPEAKER_06]: I was never an ID to make the purchase.

630
00:45:39,345 --> 00:45:43,331
[SPEAKER_06]: It was at that time, Mr. Pastorelli, he was the first person to find it, and then I said it was flawed.

631
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:46,070
[SPEAKER_06]: He goes, oh, I was never caught either.

632
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:48,331
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, you just gave me a fake ID.

633
00:45:48,351 --> 00:45:51,111
[SPEAKER_06]: He goes, oh, I have a fake ID, but I didn't use it to make the purchase.

634
00:45:51,952 --> 00:45:53,212
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, okay.

635
00:45:53,392 --> 00:45:57,353
[SPEAKER_06]: I go, guys, this video, it's going to be on video whether you used IDs or not.

636
00:45:57,433 --> 00:45:59,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to be honest with you.

637
00:45:59,233 --> 00:46:04,014
[SPEAKER_06]: And both of them were at a no time where they asked for ID and provided ID to make the purchase.

638
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:09,356
[SPEAKER_06]: So the second problem, one with the Pacific Opia, his name was Liam Creamer.

639
00:46:09,696 --> 00:46:10,976
[SPEAKER_06]: He is 19 years old.

640
00:46:10,996 --> 00:46:14,177
[SPEAKER_06]: I was able to possibly ID him with this real ID.

641
00:46:15,386 --> 00:46:20,807
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was Mr. Kramer's first interaction with the local liquorades and he had no history with them.

642
00:46:21,228 --> 00:46:23,328
[SPEAKER_06]: So he once again was let off the morning.

643
00:46:23,708 --> 00:46:28,629
[SPEAKER_06]: They were all seized that Mr. Pasquarello's fake ID was taken.

644
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:31,350
[SPEAKER_06]: So at that time, I concluded.

645
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:35,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, I've been out there for about an hour and 15 minutes.

646
00:46:35,531 --> 00:46:38,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I have four people under 21, I'm done going to the store.

647
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:44,895
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to the summary of that, but I just want to be specific on the third or fourth violations.

648
00:46:45,475 --> 00:46:49,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I was able to review the video of the purchase.

649
00:46:49,258 --> 00:46:51,480
[SPEAKER_06]: At no time did they produce an IP.

650
00:46:52,221 --> 00:46:59,967
[SPEAKER_06]: They go up to the counter, they put the beer on the counter, it gets scanned, they take a debit card or a credit card out of their wallet,

651
00:47:00,815 --> 00:47:04,696
[SPEAKER_06]: They put it in the transact, I don't know which card.

652
00:47:05,056 --> 00:47:08,417
[SPEAKER_06]: They're able to make the purchase of the credit card, debit card, take the alcohol, they walk out.

653
00:47:08,897 --> 00:47:12,138
[SPEAKER_06]: No time to make, they produce it.

654
00:47:12,398 --> 00:47:20,581
[SPEAKER_06]: So Mr. Brown and Mr. President, while we watched the I.D., he explained to me that he observed the same thing that I observed.

655
00:47:20,601 --> 00:47:23,222
[SPEAKER_06]: I showed it to Mr. Kumar as well.

656
00:47:23,462 --> 00:47:26,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Kumar was upset by this.

657
00:47:28,031 --> 00:47:32,055
[SPEAKER_06]: He explained that he always checks IDs, and this is where the lottery comes in.

658
00:47:32,656 --> 00:47:35,679
[SPEAKER_06]: So there was a gentleman that was there before, he had a bunch of lottery slips.

659
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:44,208
[SPEAKER_06]: He did the lottery, he was going through the slips, and then these two kids, they're not kids, but the 21 and 19-year-old were right after him.

660
00:47:45,409 --> 00:47:50,772
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was the distraction aspect.

661
00:47:50,792 --> 00:47:57,996
[SPEAKER_06]: He said he was distracted by the person on the lottery slips and he must have forgotten to ask for the purchase.

662
00:47:58,657 --> 00:48:00,818
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's basically the extent of three and four.

663
00:48:01,958 --> 00:48:03,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to combine them as they are.

664
00:48:08,562 --> 00:48:21,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Before I went to the summary, all that alcohol that was seized, I believe six cases of alcohol, that was brought back to the Bethel Police Station, that was thrown in the trash, and the fake IDs are gonna be destroyed.

665
00:48:22,338 --> 00:48:25,042
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the conclusion of this area and the criminal area.

666
00:48:26,101 --> 00:48:28,563
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go into the summary after.

667
00:48:31,605 --> 00:48:36,589
[SPEAKER_08]: The lottery thing was actually, when you looked on camera, it was for the two kids at the end.

668
00:48:36,609 --> 00:48:37,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Two kids at the end.

669
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:38,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Who didn't produce the IDs.

670
00:48:38,871 --> 00:48:39,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

671
00:48:39,211 --> 00:48:42,794
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not watch the videos for the first two interactions.

672
00:48:42,954 --> 00:48:44,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Both of them were flat.

673
00:48:44,235 --> 00:48:47,698
[SPEAKER_06]: They told me we used our fake IDs to make the purchases.

674
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:52,742
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't watch the video on that because they were adamant that they used their fake IDs.

675
00:48:53,162 --> 00:48:56,905
[SPEAKER_06]: I watched it for three and four because it's a question whether the IDs were used or not.

676
00:48:57,486 --> 00:49:00,408
[SPEAKER_06]: The 20-year-old that I interviewed said, absolutely not.

677
00:49:00,428 --> 00:49:01,349
[SPEAKER_06]: I was never ID'd.

678
00:49:01,829 --> 00:49:02,630
[SPEAKER_06]: I went inside.

679
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:04,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Kumar said, I have to see everybody.

680
00:49:05,352 --> 00:49:06,513
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had to speak to him.

681
00:49:06,774 --> 00:49:08,635
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wanted to see the video for three and four.

682
00:49:09,056 --> 00:49:13,860
[SPEAKER_06]: And in fact, while viewing it, three and four would never produce an ID.

683
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,641
[SPEAKER_06]: They walked out and made their purchase.

684
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:16,142
[SPEAKER_06]: They walked out.

685
00:49:16,743 --> 00:49:16,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

686
00:49:17,383 --> 00:49:17,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

687
00:49:18,244 --> 00:49:18,524
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

688
00:49:18,624 --> 00:49:20,105
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as moving to window watch.

689
00:49:20,326 --> 00:49:20,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

690
00:49:20,646 --> 00:49:20,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

691
00:49:21,206 --> 00:49:27,871
[SPEAKER_11]: So if I'm looking at the time to afford fractions from 10 past 8 p.m.

692
00:49:28,051 --> 00:49:28,831
[SPEAKER_11]: to 9 p.m.

693
00:49:28,871 --> 00:49:29,592
[SPEAKER_11]: is that sound right?

694
00:49:30,653 --> 00:49:32,354
[SPEAKER_06]: That's correct.

695
00:49:32,374 --> 00:49:37,617
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have 810, 840, and then, uh, three and four together.

696
00:49:37,637 --> 00:49:38,858
[SPEAKER_06]: They're at nine o'clock.

697
00:49:38,998 --> 00:49:40,379
[SPEAKER_06]: So four, four or 50 minutes.

698
00:49:43,706 --> 00:49:44,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

699
00:49:44,306 --> 00:49:44,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

700
00:49:45,207 --> 00:49:46,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Officer Smith.

701
00:49:46,287 --> 00:49:47,068
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

702
00:49:47,308 --> 00:49:48,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

703
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:50,429
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a 50-minute distraction?

704
00:49:50,929 --> 00:49:51,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

705
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:52,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

706
00:49:53,711 --> 00:50:06,256
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there someone from 395 Main Street that would like to comment on what Officer Smith has just read on alleged violations three and four?

707
00:50:06,396 --> 00:50:06,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, sir.

708
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:20,582
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just like the officer said, like, we must check the videos for those kids came in.

709
00:50:20,983 --> 00:50:21,243
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

710
00:50:21,283 --> 00:50:24,086
[SPEAKER_11]: So as the fake IDs.

711
00:50:24,267 --> 00:50:24,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

712
00:50:25,253 --> 00:50:29,937
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I mentioned before, he was like showing his ID, like in the hand stuff.

713
00:50:30,257 --> 00:50:31,958
[SPEAKER_11]: The first and second one?

714
00:50:32,979 --> 00:50:33,540
[SPEAKER_11]: The second.

715
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:34,981
[SPEAKER_12]: The second one.

716
00:50:35,301 --> 00:50:35,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

717
00:50:35,501 --> 00:50:35,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

718
00:50:36,042 --> 00:50:39,185
[SPEAKER_11]: And usually, not usually, I'm sorry.

719
00:50:40,185 --> 00:50:44,549
[SPEAKER_11]: When officer was with Lieutenant, they went upstairs to check the cameras.

720
00:50:44,649 --> 00:50:44,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

721
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:46,151
[SPEAKER_11]: After that, I have one

722
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:47,779
[SPEAKER_11]: came in.

723
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:49,460
[SPEAKER_11]: He had the same mass ID.

724
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,040
[SPEAKER_11]: We already discussed about it before.

725
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,560
[SPEAKER_11]: We checked this and that.

726
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,581
[SPEAKER_11]: He just gave me the ID and I was checking it.

727
00:50:54,601 --> 00:50:55,241
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a fake.

728
00:50:55,661 --> 00:51:00,642
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was holding the OSS fake ID and he just snatched it and just ran off.

729
00:51:00,662 --> 00:51:09,344
[SPEAKER_11]: So I went back to the office and I tell him like it happened again with me, like someone tried to like buy a phone or the same thing.

730
00:51:10,003 --> 00:51:12,304
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but you didn't settle on any alcohol?

731
00:51:12,504 --> 00:51:18,585
[SPEAKER_11]: No, after that I just like, as soon as I just, I want to keep the eye on him, even if they were upstairs.

732
00:51:18,805 --> 00:51:19,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

733
00:51:19,065 --> 00:51:21,305
[SPEAKER_11]: So when I try to show them, he's just like snatching.

734
00:51:21,946 --> 00:51:25,186
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, very good.

735
00:51:25,426 --> 00:51:25,806
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

736
00:51:28,467 --> 00:51:31,788
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there anyone else that would like to speak?

737
00:51:34,728 --> 00:51:36,569
[SPEAKER_12]: On anything, on all of four?

738
00:51:38,577 --> 00:51:39,978
[SPEAKER_12]: alleged violations.

739
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:42,739
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, Officer Smith.

740
00:51:42,759 --> 00:51:44,379
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

741
00:51:44,459 --> 00:51:51,302
[SPEAKER_12]: I could you please state your name and address for the record?

742
00:51:51,622 --> 00:51:54,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my name is Priscilla.

743
00:51:54,103 --> 00:51:54,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

744
00:51:54,384 --> 00:51:58,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm just like I say, I'm apologizing whatever happened.

745
00:51:58,665 --> 00:52:02,627
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I have a 17 year old too, so it shouldn't be happening like that.

746
00:52:03,551 --> 00:52:05,672
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been working with them for 13 years.

747
00:52:05,692 --> 00:52:06,533
[SPEAKER_01]: It never happened.

748
00:52:06,753 --> 00:52:11,555
[SPEAKER_01]: We have said we are not selling anything.

749
00:52:11,575 --> 00:52:12,195
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how.

750
00:52:12,716 --> 00:52:14,977
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a bad luck or whatever.

751
00:52:15,797 --> 00:52:17,798
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not once, it's three times a day.

752
00:52:17,858 --> 00:52:19,759
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what to say.

753
00:52:19,779 --> 00:52:25,382
[SPEAKER_01]: We just take precautions.

754
00:52:25,402 --> 00:52:28,323
[SPEAKER_01]: We bought a safety scanner.

755
00:52:28,704 --> 00:52:31,365
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still getting those people, but refusing

756
00:52:32,017 --> 00:52:39,899
[SPEAKER_01]: and rechecking the license, not even like the scanner, it shows like you have to check his eyes, whatever it says, it will fall in the data.

757
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:45,481
[SPEAKER_01]: It was unflashable.

758
00:52:46,241 --> 00:52:47,121
[SPEAKER_11]: It is concerning.

759
00:52:47,181 --> 00:52:49,842
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, just in 50 minutes, it's four fractions.

760
00:52:49,922 --> 00:52:52,663
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, and that's one point in time.

761
00:52:53,896 --> 00:53:02,002
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, you're right, was it just an off day, it went off, or do the kids, these young kids know, let's go here?

762
00:53:02,963 --> 00:53:05,024
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't even ask for a license.

763
00:53:05,645 --> 00:53:08,066
[SPEAKER_11]: So, as I said, it is concerning.

764
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:20,215
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I understand, like, even though, like, two months ago, we got a certificate, I don't know what time, we were just, like, overconfident, you know, getting those tickets or whatever, they started becoming, certainly, I don't know what happened.

765
00:53:22,501 --> 00:53:25,602
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah, they're targeting your store to come to.

766
00:53:25,662 --> 00:53:40,367
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, think about it, you know, I mean, let's just say, yeah, but it's not, I mean, just to speak like, like what everybody else is thinking, here's, I mean, store resource officer says, people, kids are dying.

767
00:53:41,287 --> 00:53:44,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Officer, you know, he goes out on one random night.

768
00:53:44,908 --> 00:53:46,989
[SPEAKER_08]: In 15 minutes, he gets three kids.

769
00:53:48,029 --> 00:53:51,090
[SPEAKER_08]: And then 15 minutes later, another kid, you know, comes in to buy.

770
00:53:51,988 --> 00:53:54,129
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, so what do you think it looks like?

771
00:53:54,950 --> 00:54:15,341
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you bought the scanner, you're doing the right thing now, but obviously it looks bad and it looks like you guys would just, you'd rather get money, get paid for this and not do it right, not, you know, check ID, not actually be responsible.

772
00:54:15,501 --> 00:54:16,522
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what it looks like.

773
00:54:16,562 --> 00:54:20,044
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm speaking for myself, but that's what it looks like, I'm sure.

774
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:25,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody watching this feels, most people feel the same way.

775
00:54:28,158 --> 00:54:32,541
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if there's something to say.

776
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:33,842
[SPEAKER_12]: We understand your story.

777
00:54:34,423 --> 00:54:42,950
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, that's a little too late right now, only because I agree with my fellow commissioner.

778
00:54:43,624 --> 00:54:54,109
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, you're in this business to make a living and to make money, but you can't do it at the expense of possibly someone else's life.

779
00:54:54,889 --> 00:55:05,895
[SPEAKER_12]: These kids could take that alcohol, drive a vehicle, kill not only themselves, but kill innocent parties, innocent families, my family, your family.

780
00:55:06,755 --> 00:55:09,536
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, then it's too late and it isn't worth the money.

781
00:55:10,637 --> 00:55:12,538
[SPEAKER_12]: And this commission really

782
00:55:13,155 --> 00:55:15,436
[SPEAKER_12]: really frowns on this.

783
00:55:15,796 --> 00:55:17,577
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, this is serious.

784
00:55:18,617 --> 00:55:22,139
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's why we're having this hearing.

785
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:25,981
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to get you outside of it.

786
00:55:26,001 --> 00:55:33,324
[SPEAKER_12]: You are showing that you did purchase the scanner, which is going to take care of a little bit of this problem.

787
00:55:35,025 --> 00:55:41,187
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, we'll take all of this information under advisement.

788
00:55:42,967 --> 00:55:48,631
[SPEAKER_12]: after the officer reads the summary, and we'll go from there.

789
00:55:51,813 --> 00:55:53,414
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I agree.

790
00:55:53,434 --> 00:56:01,580
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, just once you start saying no, and you start carding, the word gets out, and that's it.

791
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:06,663
[SPEAKER_11]: We move on to somewhere else, and we'll take action somewhere else.

792
00:56:08,144 --> 00:56:10,185
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, the chairman's right.

793
00:56:10,225 --> 00:56:12,227
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, have these kids,

794
00:56:13,395 --> 00:56:23,800
[SPEAKER_11]: got away, got into trouble or hurt somebody, killed somebody, they'll come for your corporation and your business.

795
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,081
[SPEAKER_11]: So not that you don't already know.

796
00:56:28,122 --> 00:56:28,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

797
00:56:28,763 --> 00:56:32,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Nancy, for saying we will take it under advisement.

798
00:56:33,385 --> 00:56:33,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

799
00:56:36,266 --> 00:56:39,368
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there anyone else that would like to speak?

800
00:56:40,462 --> 00:56:57,195
[SPEAKER_12]: on behalf of the school at the lake and we will give you an opportunity to speak as well after the officer reads the summary of the report and officer smith would you like to read the summary

801
00:57:00,532 --> 00:57:18,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to go back to what Mr. Kumar said, while we were watching the video on the third and fourth violations, myself and Mr. Bradley, Mr. Kumar didn't come upstairs and explain to me that another person under 21 came in with a fake ID to make a purchase and that sale was denied while I was upstairs watching the video.

802
00:57:18,386 --> 00:57:19,447
[SPEAKER_06]: So, sorry.

803
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:29,519
[SPEAKER_06]: So after we have these violations, it's been, like you said, four violations or four people under 21 in 50 minutes.

804
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:32,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, I have to do something about this.

805
00:57:32,203 --> 00:57:33,224
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going into the store.

806
00:57:33,585 --> 00:57:35,147
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to address this immediately.

807
00:57:39,763 --> 00:57:42,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, basically, you can summarize it, too, if you like.

808
00:57:42,846 --> 00:57:43,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

809
00:57:43,227 --> 00:57:44,789
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give you the summary of it.

810
00:57:44,949 --> 00:57:45,509
[SPEAKER_06]: That's for you.

811
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:49,314
[SPEAKER_06]: So after I'm brain-forgone, I head to the store.

812
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:50,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Kumar is present.

813
00:57:50,896 --> 00:57:52,497
[SPEAKER_06]: He's right by the counter.

814
00:57:53,058 --> 00:57:57,583
[SPEAKER_06]: I identified myself and gave him a full summary of what I had just watched.

815
00:58:00,259 --> 00:58:04,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Kumar was very apologetic to my findings.

816
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:11,104
[SPEAKER_06]: He explained to me that he always asked for an ID, and that he wasn't aware.

817
00:58:11,164 --> 00:58:17,388
[SPEAKER_06]: I showed him the fake IDs, and he apologized.

818
00:58:17,408 --> 00:58:19,909
[SPEAKER_06]: I asked him who the manager was, I mean, who the owner was.

819
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:24,111
[SPEAKER_06]: He told me the owner of the business was Mr. Paul Ratner.

820
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:36,871
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm out there having a conversation with Mr. Kumar, and a second employee comes over to me from the back row, and that probably identifies himself as Mr. Paul Ratton.

821
00:58:37,851 --> 00:58:40,272
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I asked him if he was the owner, and he told me no.

822
00:58:41,292 --> 00:58:49,454
[SPEAKER_06]: So after some back and forth, I found out that Mr. Kumar and Mr. Ratton are brother and wife, and that their wives are actually the owners of the business.

823
00:58:50,174 --> 00:58:55,175
[SPEAKER_06]: So I explained to them that I needed to speak to the owner and reschedule the meeting.

824
00:58:56,146 --> 00:58:58,547
[SPEAKER_06]: I also gave a full summary to Mr. Rad.

825
00:58:58,727 --> 00:59:00,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I explained everything that I observed.

826
00:59:00,548 --> 00:59:01,669
[SPEAKER_06]: I showed them my IDs.

827
00:59:02,229 --> 00:59:07,832
[SPEAKER_06]: We pulled out our own mass IDs and looked at them and everybody agreed that they were all fake.

828
00:59:08,513 --> 00:59:14,376
[SPEAKER_06]: So Mr. Pasquarello, Mr. Rad, even though Mr. Pasquarello never used his ID, Mr. Mangone's ID was a fake.

829
00:59:16,097 --> 00:59:17,578
[SPEAKER_06]: That time Mr. Rad brought me upstairs.

830
00:59:17,618 --> 00:59:21,060
[SPEAKER_06]: We looked at the video, sort of bring it forward.

831
00:59:23,879 --> 00:59:25,940
[SPEAKER_06]: certified on the property.

832
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,682
[SPEAKER_06]: So I scheduled a meeting for the next day, and I returned on the 4th.

833
00:59:33,162 --> 00:59:34,102
[SPEAKER_06]: I met with Ms.

834
00:59:34,122 --> 00:59:37,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Debbie, and sorry, I forget your name.

835
00:59:37,743 --> 00:59:42,105
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize, I have it here.

836
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:42,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

837
00:59:42,305 --> 00:59:43,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Latta, Mr. Rat, Mr. Pumak.

838
00:59:44,406 --> 00:59:45,606
[SPEAKER_06]: We all met the following day.

839
00:59:45,626 --> 00:59:51,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I explained the full investigation, what transpired the night prior.

840
00:59:52,154 --> 00:59:57,176
[SPEAKER_06]: I learned that as long as they have children that are just under 20 mile, they were very upset by the findings.

841
00:59:58,797 --> 01:00:05,100
[SPEAKER_06]: I learned that there was no scanner or no way to verify the IDs on property at the time, and that they had ordered a scanner.

842
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:07,424
[SPEAKER_06]: and that it was due to arrive the following day.

843
01:00:07,444 --> 01:00:10,846
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought our overall conversation was positive.

844
01:00:11,746 --> 01:00:16,829
[SPEAKER_06]: They were upset by my findings, and they expressed great concern, and they wanted to do better.

845
01:00:17,369 --> 01:00:18,449
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought that was a great step.

846
01:00:18,529 --> 01:00:23,672
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't recommend buying a scanner, but they went out and did that before I even arrived the following day.

847
01:00:23,692 --> 01:00:25,833
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that was positive.

848
01:00:27,234 --> 01:00:31,516
[SPEAKER_06]: When I brought the notice to appear, I actually saw the scanner in action.

849
01:00:31,536 --> 01:00:33,657
[SPEAKER_06]: It was somebody who was younger in age that came in.

850
01:00:34,311 --> 01:00:43,396
[SPEAKER_06]: I observed, I was another employee, I observed him, I asked for ID, he looked at the ID, put it in the scanner, came back, and a sale was made.

851
01:00:43,416 --> 01:00:46,638
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was very happy to see that the scanner was in place and working.

852
01:00:46,678 --> 01:00:50,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe I went on the 8th to serve that notice.

853
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:56,703
[SPEAKER_06]: So by the 8th, up and operational, and I observed it, it was working at that time.

854
01:01:00,103 --> 01:01:06,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Essentially, the summary, I didn't pass on my report to Officer Pascotillo, who's the school resource officer.

855
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:09,993
[SPEAKER_06]: He has been an asset for almost for this commission.

856
01:01:10,453 --> 01:01:12,215
[SPEAKER_06]: He told us about the previous one.

857
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:16,239
[SPEAKER_06]: This is direct knowledge coming from high school students at Bethel High School.

858
01:01:16,279 --> 01:01:17,440
[SPEAKER_06]: He's becoming aware of it.

859
01:01:18,381 --> 01:01:23,626
[SPEAKER_06]: He's now telling me, and then I show up on a random night and observe business being conducted.

860
01:01:26,698 --> 01:01:29,961
[SPEAKER_06]: That night in particular, these are obvious to me.

861
01:01:30,241 --> 01:01:34,364
[SPEAKER_06]: I deal with these people on the 21 all the time, so I know what a person on the 21 looks like.

862
01:01:34,965 --> 01:01:36,306
[SPEAKER_06]: That night, I didn't approach anybody else.

863
01:01:37,307 --> 01:01:39,468
[SPEAKER_06]: They were obvious to me that they were on the 21.

864
01:01:39,508 --> 01:01:42,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Same with the last investigation.

865
01:01:42,931 --> 01:01:44,812
[SPEAKER_06]: These are obvious to me.

866
01:01:44,832 --> 01:01:45,533
[SPEAKER_06]: They look young.

867
01:01:45,733 --> 01:01:46,474
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not private.

868
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:47,995
[SPEAKER_06]: They're wearing sweatpants, sweatshirts.

869
01:01:48,035 --> 01:01:50,076
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got their lanyards hanging out of their pockets.

870
01:01:50,597 --> 01:01:53,119
[SPEAKER_06]: These do not look like, they don't have beards.

871
01:01:53,199 --> 01:01:53,839
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not older.

872
01:01:55,271 --> 01:02:00,893
[SPEAKER_06]: They look like kids, and I refer to them as kids even though they're 18, 19, 20, 16, 17.

873
01:02:03,874 --> 01:02:05,814
[SPEAKER_06]: That's essentially my summary.

874
01:02:06,655 --> 01:02:06,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

875
01:02:07,195 --> 01:02:09,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, great job with this, Officer Smith.

876
01:02:09,575 --> 01:02:12,396
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate the work and the authenticity of this.

877
01:02:13,137 --> 01:02:13,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

878
01:02:13,797 --> 01:02:16,538
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

879
01:02:16,878 --> 01:02:18,438
[SPEAKER_12]: Anybody from 395 Mansfield, are you here?

880
01:02:18,518 --> 01:02:19,118
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm still here.

881
01:02:25,086 --> 01:02:27,467
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened to the store, that's so bad.

882
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:30,408
[SPEAKER_05]: And we apologize for that.

883
01:02:30,808 --> 01:02:33,449
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are in this business for 14 years.

884
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:40,111
[SPEAKER_05]: And the city sends so many times to check us and for the inspection, to sell the underage.

885
01:02:40,511 --> 01:02:41,452
[SPEAKER_05]: And we never fail.

886
01:02:41,472 --> 01:02:42,412
[SPEAKER_05]: You check your records.

887
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:46,053
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have a kid, 21, like 20 years old.

888
01:02:46,213 --> 01:02:48,414
[SPEAKER_05]: We know how bad it is to sell the underage people.

889
01:02:49,405 --> 01:02:53,808
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that every day, three teens die from drinking and driving.

890
01:02:54,289 --> 01:02:55,170
[SPEAKER_05]: I know these things.

891
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:58,252
[SPEAKER_05]: So how is it possible we sell these things?

892
01:02:58,372 --> 01:02:59,133
[SPEAKER_05]: What purpose?

893
01:02:59,793 --> 01:03:01,034
[SPEAKER_05]: We formalized all that.

894
01:03:01,074 --> 01:03:07,939
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a mistake, but we will be next time very careful to check every single point of the ID.

895
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:16,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the time, me and my brother were there, so we know that auto check the ID, so it will never happen again.

896
01:03:16,767 --> 01:03:24,249
[SPEAKER_05]: We apologize for that, so please give us a break this time, and we will now give you a copy for regarding the address.

897
01:03:25,849 --> 01:03:28,690
[SPEAKER_05]: And we will now accept the auto state IDs.

898
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:32,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

899
01:03:33,091 --> 01:03:35,291
[SPEAKER_12]: Were you TIP certified?

900
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:35,651
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

901
01:03:35,671 --> 01:03:37,052
[SPEAKER_12]: That's something you should know.

902
01:03:37,152 --> 01:03:37,392
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

903
01:03:39,505 --> 01:03:43,528
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's, it's, there's no excuse for it.

904
01:03:44,308 --> 01:03:57,076
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, it's kind of right now when this seemed to be a little bit out of control, especially where it was going around in high school, that that was the place to buy.

905
01:03:59,017 --> 01:04:03,300
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's, it's, it's telling us that this has been going on for a little while.

906
01:04:04,681 --> 01:04:08,363
[SPEAKER_12]: And you're saying that this,

907
01:04:08,898 --> 01:04:10,840
[SPEAKER_12]: you'll assure us this will never happen again.

908
01:04:12,061 --> 01:04:13,582
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm giving you warning today.

909
01:04:13,943 --> 01:04:25,914
[SPEAKER_12]: If it does happen again, and you come before this commission, you've got a chance of us revoking your license permanently.

910
01:04:27,776 --> 01:04:29,037
[SPEAKER_12]: So keep that in mind.

911
01:04:29,057 --> 01:04:30,859
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the most severe penalty.

912
01:04:35,654 --> 01:04:46,598
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that's just something to keep in mind, and something for all your employees to keep in mind, because as you know, liquor license in the city is worth a lot of money for a liquor store.

913
01:04:47,398 --> 01:04:57,561
[SPEAKER_12]: And if your license gets revoked, that's not only going to cost you your business, it's going to cost you, and you've got to sell that license to your mom and yourself.

914
01:04:58,501 --> 01:05:02,923
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is very, very important, and it's such a strong

915
01:05:04,891 --> 01:05:09,894
[SPEAKER_12]: that we're giving you because it's such an important thing.

916
01:05:09,934 --> 01:05:16,778
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I served on the fire department for 30-some odd years, and I've seen what Alcoa does.

917
01:05:18,059 --> 01:05:21,081
[SPEAKER_12]: It's impressive, as well as Officer Smith.

918
01:05:21,841 --> 01:05:22,922
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's not a pretty sight.

919
01:05:24,143 --> 01:05:30,947
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, you just... This is why we just try to keep the handle on this.

920
01:05:31,487 --> 01:05:32,648
[SPEAKER_12]: We find it very serious.

921
01:05:33,598 --> 01:05:39,685
[SPEAKER_12]: And I felt as though I had to give you a full warning just for it.

922
01:05:39,945 --> 01:05:43,489
[SPEAKER_12]: So there won't be a next time.

923
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:44,831
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand, sir.

924
01:05:44,871 --> 01:05:49,516
[SPEAKER_12]: You seem very remorseful, which we take into consideration as well.

925
01:05:49,756 --> 01:05:50,137
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, sir.

926
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:56,461
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to discuss this.

927
01:05:56,741 --> 01:05:57,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

928
01:05:57,301 --> 01:05:58,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

929
01:05:58,202 --> 01:05:58,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

930
01:05:58,502 --> 01:06:04,306
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to discuss this before any kind of a wanting disorder, anything.

931
01:06:05,247 --> 01:06:06,368
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to talk about this.

932
01:06:07,188 --> 01:06:12,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Because there's some stuff in here that I'm wrestling with.

933
01:06:12,552 --> 01:06:14,153
[SPEAKER_11]: So, OK.

934
01:06:14,694 --> 01:06:15,714
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

935
01:06:15,814 --> 01:06:22,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think just so it's more clear, what I'm saying is that it could be your business.

936
01:06:25,622 --> 01:06:28,204
[SPEAKER_08]: But that doesn't mean that there's no consequence for this time.

937
01:06:28,805 --> 01:06:32,768
[SPEAKER_08]: So just saying no, that doesn't mean that there's not any consequence.

938
01:06:32,868 --> 01:06:39,413
[SPEAKER_08]: That's something we need to deliberate about for that, just so there's no, like it's not unclear.

939
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:39,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

940
01:06:40,034 --> 01:06:48,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Ken, do you want to kind of explain what happens from this point forward?

941
01:06:49,982 --> 01:06:51,863
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

942
01:06:51,983 --> 01:06:54,906
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody that's here today that was one

943
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,021
[SPEAKER_12]: Is everybody all set?

944
01:06:57,201 --> 01:07:03,504
[SPEAKER_12]: Anybody else wanna speak?

945
01:07:03,624 --> 01:07:19,212
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to recommend that this commission takes this matter under advisement and you'll be notified with that decision.

946
01:07:20,433 --> 01:07:24,255
[SPEAKER_12]: What we do with this point is the three commission is only

947
01:07:25,323 --> 01:07:26,604
[SPEAKER_12]: meet privately.

948
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:31,447
[SPEAKER_12]: We discuss all of our notes that we took here today.

949
01:07:31,908 --> 01:07:33,329
[SPEAKER_12]: We have the police report.

950
01:07:33,729 --> 01:07:35,010
[SPEAKER_12]: We have your testimony.

951
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:39,733
[SPEAKER_12]: And we take it all into consideration.

952
01:07:40,353 --> 01:07:48,138
[SPEAKER_12]: And we will decide what, if any, penalties were to be.

953
01:07:51,323 --> 01:07:56,987
[SPEAKER_12]: What I'd like to do is have you folks back at our next monthly meeting.

954
01:07:57,007 --> 01:08:18,422
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll know before then on what our outcome was in this and we plan to just discuss it with you and make sure that you understand everything that we put in into the decision on what the

955
01:08:19,794 --> 01:08:22,296
[SPEAKER_12]: what, if any, the punishment is going to be.

956
01:08:24,918 --> 01:08:30,002
[SPEAKER_12]: So I make a motion for this commission to take this matter for advisement.

957
01:08:30,883 --> 01:08:33,445
[SPEAKER_12]: If one of you folks would like to second it.

958
01:08:35,607 --> 01:08:36,087
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

959
01:08:36,488 --> 01:08:38,029
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

960
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:39,370
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion's been made.

961
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:41,792
[SPEAKER_12]: The matter is going to be taken under advisement.

962
01:08:41,932 --> 01:08:42,853
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favor?

963
01:08:43,173 --> 01:08:43,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

964
01:08:44,254 --> 01:08:45,155
[SPEAKER_12]: All those opposed?

965
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:48,818
[SPEAKER_12]: Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it.

966
01:08:49,997 --> 01:08:51,097
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll let you folks know.

967
01:08:51,497 --> 01:08:51,838
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

968
01:08:51,918 --> 01:08:52,418
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

969
01:08:52,438 --> 01:08:53,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for coming together.

970
01:08:58,499 --> 01:09:05,061
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, we can get back to the regular business of the monthly meeting at this point.

971
01:09:05,801 --> 01:09:08,402
[SPEAKER_12]: Officer Smith, you're all set to go if you want.

972
01:09:08,422 --> 01:09:10,102
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you're all welcome to hang out.

973
01:09:10,482 --> 01:09:11,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

974
01:09:11,143 --> 01:09:12,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

975
01:09:12,583 --> 01:09:13,243
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, everyone.

976
01:09:13,523 --> 01:09:13,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

977
01:09:13,843 --> 01:09:14,103
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that Ms.

978
01:09:14,123 --> 01:09:14,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Dingman?

979
01:09:31,296 --> 01:09:33,859
[SPEAKER_11]: We're looking at the next item on the end.

980
01:09:33,979 --> 01:09:34,379
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

981
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:35,981
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we get around.

982
01:09:36,842 --> 01:09:38,083
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

983
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:41,007
[SPEAKER_11]: I put this thing to stop talking.

984
01:09:41,587 --> 01:09:42,428
[SPEAKER_12]: I put a lot of new.

985
01:10:14,862 --> 01:10:15,122
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

986
01:10:15,142 --> 01:10:16,803
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see if that works.

987
01:10:18,364 --> 01:10:18,644
[SPEAKER_10]: That works.

988
01:10:18,684 --> 01:10:20,425
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm looking back for mine, but that's just.

989
01:10:20,885 --> 01:10:21,485
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, cool.

990
01:10:22,406 --> 01:10:22,686
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

991
01:10:22,706 --> 01:10:24,047
[SPEAKER_12]: I couldn't, I couldn't shut it off.

992
01:10:24,367 --> 01:10:25,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

993
01:10:25,267 --> 01:10:27,869
[SPEAKER_12]: I even muted it.

994
01:10:27,909 --> 01:10:29,309
[SPEAKER_12]: Finally, I just closed the lid.

995
01:10:29,329 --> 01:10:30,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, no, it made sense.

996
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:31,650
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyways.

997
01:10:31,731 --> 01:10:32,111
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

998
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:36,453
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have minutes from July 12th to November 26th.

999
01:10:36,473 --> 01:10:37,734
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that what I'm saying?

1000
01:10:38,014 --> 01:10:38,374
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1001
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:40,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Or am I messing something up?

1002
01:10:41,916 --> 01:10:42,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1003
01:10:43,124 --> 01:10:45,466
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you got seven months, I think, right?

1004
01:10:45,786 --> 01:10:46,087
[SPEAKER_12]: Seven.

1005
01:10:46,267 --> 01:10:46,587
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1006
01:10:46,787 --> 01:10:47,548
[SPEAKER_12]: I was, uh, eight.

1007
01:10:47,908 --> 01:10:53,353
[SPEAKER_12]: I was trying to stitch together all the, uh, Terry, you were killing it.

1008
01:10:53,393 --> 01:10:58,137
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you would just like multiple times in the same model.

1009
01:10:58,197 --> 01:10:58,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1010
01:10:58,497 --> 01:10:58,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1011
01:10:58,577 --> 01:11:01,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Two meetings in November.

1012
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:07,324
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can click file out of this for October.

1013
01:11:14,572 --> 01:11:24,621
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, let me just clean this up a little bit so I can get to them.

1014
01:11:26,623 --> 01:11:29,386
[SPEAKER_12]: Last minute, put them over here.

1015
01:11:43,958 --> 01:11:49,101
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's what 1218 is.

1016
01:11:49,161 --> 01:11:53,683
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, 717, 821, 10-1, 10-16, 10-23, 10-20, and 11-26.

1017
01:11:53,963 --> 01:11:54,423
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1018
01:11:55,484 --> 01:11:55,764
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

1019
01:11:57,045 --> 01:11:58,786
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you guys had a chance to read them all?

1020
01:12:00,126 --> 01:12:00,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1021
01:12:00,346 --> 01:12:02,127
[SPEAKER_11]: We took a blast from the past.

1022
01:12:02,387 --> 01:12:02,648
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

1023
01:12:02,828 --> 01:12:03,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1024
01:12:03,468 --> 01:12:04,669
[SPEAKER_12]: I did, too.

1025
01:12:05,169 --> 01:12:06,770
[SPEAKER_12]: I spent some time last night.

1026
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:11,432
[SPEAKER_12]: Daria, you picked up a couple of corrections that

1027
01:12:15,050 --> 01:12:18,033
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know where my Zoom screen went, but here it is.

1028
01:12:18,193 --> 01:12:18,534
[SPEAKER_12]: I got it.

1029
01:12:19,935 --> 01:12:22,658
[SPEAKER_12]: You picked up a couple of corrections, which were great.

1030
01:12:23,479 --> 01:12:27,223
[SPEAKER_12]: You fixed those, and I mean, it all looked good to me.

1031
01:12:30,139 --> 01:12:37,504
[SPEAKER_12]: You were really killing it this past week, trying to get these all done, as well as your annual reports and everything else.

1032
01:12:37,584 --> 01:12:41,647
[SPEAKER_12]: So I commend you for all the work you've done.

1033
01:12:41,787 --> 01:12:42,267
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a lot.

1034
01:12:42,327 --> 01:12:43,368
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of readapting.

1035
01:12:43,728 --> 01:12:43,948
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1036
01:12:44,268 --> 01:12:46,150
[SPEAKER_12]: And then did the holidays at the same time.

1037
01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:46,490
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1038
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:52,322
[SPEAKER_12]: marathon session, but, um, I'm Fay.

[SPEAKER_12]: But November 26 in there.

[SPEAKER_08]: You've seconded that motion and that's good.

1113
01:16:34,392 --> 01:16:34,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1114
01:16:35,092 --> 01:16:37,673

[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

1118
01:16:39,134 --> 01:16:40,274
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we're good to go.

1119
01:16:40,374 --> 01:16:40,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1120
01:16:40,714 --> 01:16:40,975
[SPEAKER_12]: Good.

1121
01:16:41,775 --> 01:16:44,256
[SPEAKER_12]: So we don't have to make an informal motion, right?

1122
01:16:44,276 --> 01:16:45,136
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think so.

1123
01:16:45,196 --> 01:16:45,757
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1124
01:16:45,997 --> 01:16:47,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a correction.

[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

1260
01:19:25,638 --> 01:19:25,778
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

1261
01:19:25,798 --> 01:19:25,878
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye

1262
01:19:29,079 --> 01:19:31,601
[SPEAKER_12]: And see if we missed anything on the agenda.

1263
01:19:31,921 --> 01:19:33,282
[SPEAKER_12]: We've approved all the minutes.

1264
01:19:35,723 --> 01:19:36,584
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we got it all.

1265
01:19:36,624 --> 01:19:39,205
[SPEAKER_12]: I made a couple of notes.

1266
01:19:41,306 --> 01:19:42,307
[SPEAKER_12]: The establishment.

1267
01:19:43,287 --> 01:19:44,968
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want, I want to thank you.

1268
01:19:45,008 --> 01:19:47,190
[SPEAKER_12]: You did a nice job on that.

1269
01:19:47,230 --> 01:19:49,331
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you were superstar trying to get that through.

1270
01:19:49,391 --> 01:19:55,154
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that was record time that anything went through the ABCC.

1271
01:19:55,434 --> 01:19:55,875
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you.

1272
01:19:59,192 --> 01:20:03,033
[SPEAKER_12]: You stayed on top of it, it was like within eight or nine days.

1273
01:20:03,693 --> 01:20:05,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you clarify that?

1274
01:20:05,293 --> 01:20:07,534
[SPEAKER_08]: It had to run out from the porch, is that what it was?

1275
01:20:07,714 --> 01:20:12,415
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, because the porch never surrendered the license.

1276
01:20:12,495 --> 01:20:15,636
[SPEAKER_11]: If they don't surrender it- Right, for it to expire.

1277
01:20:15,916 --> 01:20:16,536
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1278
01:20:16,556 --> 01:20:20,797
[SPEAKER_12]: We got to wait to December 31st, but with the commission already approved it,

1279
01:20:21,977 --> 01:20:29,578
[SPEAKER_12]: And the ABCC initially approved it with the inspection, with the exception of the license hadn't been surrendered.

1280
01:20:30,559 --> 01:20:34,399
[SPEAKER_12]: Daria pushed this through the ABCC on a priority.

1281
01:20:34,979 --> 01:20:43,141
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, as soon as it happened, they got it, they approved it, and he's got his license now, which is great.

1282
01:20:43,501 --> 01:20:45,761
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, she did a great job with it.

1283
01:20:47,141 --> 01:20:49,542
[SPEAKER_12]: He can open it now, right?

1284
01:20:50,042 --> 01:20:50,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, he's good to go.

1285
01:20:53,352 --> 01:20:56,578
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, yeah, so he's all good to go, which is awesome.

1286
01:20:57,700 --> 01:21:02,148
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw something too about gab hours that you shot me a couple of emails.

1287
01:21:02,248 --> 01:21:03,450
[SPEAKER_12]: Did they call?

1288
01:21:03,470 --> 01:21:04,893
[SPEAKER_12]: Were they concerned?

1289
01:21:08,252 --> 01:21:10,153
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause I think they kind of might've dropped the ball.

1290
01:21:10,253 --> 01:21:12,475
[SPEAKER_12]: I was away the month that he came in.

1291
01:21:12,495 --> 01:21:14,656
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that was in October.

1292
01:21:15,617 --> 01:21:19,699
[SPEAKER_12]: And, uh, I don't know what went on, but what's that?

1293
01:21:20,339 --> 01:21:27,684
[SPEAKER_08]: They wanted it to be 24, seven license never had the house because they didn't open during the whole season.

1294
01:21:27,764 --> 01:21:30,826
[SPEAKER_07]: They opened like later.

1295
01:21:31,206 --> 01:21:31,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1296
01:21:34,895 --> 01:21:37,536
[SPEAKER_07]: We had the license, but no hours on it.

1297
01:21:38,137 --> 01:21:40,138
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's what made me look.

1298
01:21:40,158 --> 01:21:46,081
[SPEAKER_07]: I was looking at my spreadsheet, and for some reason, saw I'm missing, there was a whole issue with that.

1299
01:21:46,481 --> 01:21:47,562
[SPEAKER_07]: So I had to fix it.

1300
01:21:47,702 --> 01:21:51,024
[SPEAKER_07]: But then I was like, I don't know if Gab actually ever told us their hours.

1301
01:21:51,404 --> 01:21:52,785
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what made me think.

1302
01:21:52,985 --> 01:21:54,165
[SPEAKER_07]: So I checked with the city clerk.

1303
01:21:54,206 --> 01:21:58,048
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, did they ever apply for a coming week until 1 AM?

1304
01:21:58,448 --> 01:21:59,668
[SPEAKER_07]: So he said, no.

1305
01:21:59,909 --> 01:22:02,430
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm like, I couldn't remember exactly.

1306
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:04,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Because for some reason, I feel like they did.

1307
01:22:04,578 --> 01:22:06,560
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you tell me no, then that means no.

1308
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:10,943
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's when I started to think about the whole square footage and all that stuff.

1309
01:22:10,983 --> 01:22:11,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1310
01:22:11,164 --> 01:22:12,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there was a lot on it.

1311
01:22:12,725 --> 01:22:12,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1312
01:22:13,145 --> 01:22:15,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Technically, that's not.

1313
01:22:15,607 --> 01:22:25,536
[SPEAKER_07]: But I want to, before I go to the next columnist, I want to make sure that all the information is correct.

1314
01:22:26,852 --> 01:22:30,275
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, does does their license say they're open to one?

1315
01:22:30,616 --> 01:22:40,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they, when they open, just in October, when they have the license, but you just never have the hours.

1316
01:22:41,006 --> 01:22:45,770
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but what does the common Vic say?

1317
01:22:46,311 --> 01:22:47,612
[SPEAKER_12]: Then they can't be open to one.

1318
01:22:47,732 --> 01:22:49,994
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they,

1319
01:22:54,565 --> 01:22:59,988
[SPEAKER_11]: But didn't they come and they wanted to open at 8 a.m.

1320
01:23:00,028 --> 01:23:01,428
[SPEAKER_11]: or something and we went to 11?

1321
01:23:01,568 --> 01:23:03,610
[SPEAKER_08]: We started with 11.

1322
01:23:04,430 --> 01:23:07,151
[SPEAKER_08]: That was assumed that their closing time was already established.

1323
01:23:07,171 --> 01:23:08,172
[SPEAKER_07]: I say that's the problem.

1324
01:23:08,192 --> 01:23:10,273
[SPEAKER_07]: The ACC application doesn't last for hours.

1325
01:23:21,379 --> 01:23:30,406
[SPEAKER_07]: So because of the whole issue for 1AM that we figured out last year because of the coming big, I never paid attention to it until we started this issue.

1326
01:23:30,426 --> 01:23:32,568
[SPEAKER_07]: So that occurred in my head and I was like, wait.

1327
01:23:33,208 --> 01:23:37,792
[SPEAKER_07]: But whenever they don't have coming big, it started that they really shouldn't be turning to 1AM.

1328
01:23:37,832 --> 01:23:42,456
[SPEAKER_07]: But they might not even know that because this all happened after they got their license.

1329
01:23:42,596 --> 01:23:45,018
[SPEAKER_07]: They wouldn't have even talked about it.

1330
01:23:45,238 --> 01:23:46,919
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

1331
01:23:47,179 --> 01:23:48,440
[SPEAKER_07]: They played catch up.

1332
01:23:52,135 --> 01:23:59,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if they want to legitimately be open until one, do they need City Council approval, or do they just need our approval?

1333
01:23:59,923 --> 01:24:01,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they need to go to Council.

1334
01:24:02,530 --> 01:24:05,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, COVID is only until 11 p.m.

1335
01:24:05,493 --> 01:24:06,014
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, right.

1336
01:24:06,234 --> 01:24:13,321
[SPEAKER_12]: So unless, like Snappy Patty's did last month, we approved them for 1 a.m.

1337
01:24:13,822 --> 01:24:14,482
[SPEAKER_12]: for some reason.

1338
01:24:14,522 --> 01:24:17,305
[SPEAKER_12]: They only wanted it on Thursday, Friday, Saturday or something.

1339
01:24:17,325 --> 01:24:19,067
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you got to do it to it.

1340
01:24:19,447 --> 01:24:20,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Just 1 a.m.

1341
01:24:20,869 --> 01:24:21,269
[SPEAKER_12]: You can go 2 a.m.

1342
01:24:23,015 --> 01:24:23,355
[SPEAKER_12]: 2 a.m.

1343
01:24:23,415 --> 01:24:24,676
[SPEAKER_12]: is our limit.

1344
01:24:25,356 --> 01:24:27,677
[SPEAKER_12]: If the city will allow it, that's 2 a.m.

1345
01:24:27,737 --> 01:24:28,037
[SPEAKER_12]: is it?

1346
01:24:28,297 --> 01:24:28,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1347
01:24:28,878 --> 01:24:37,582
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, you know, if they want to do 1 a.m., they feel as though that's enough, then, you know what, just apply for it.

1348
01:24:37,662 --> 01:24:48,767
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think what we should do is have Mr. Brian Zatha, we ought to notify him to see what his CarmenVic hours are.

1349
01:24:49,847 --> 01:24:50,948
[SPEAKER_12]: And if they're not till 1 a.m.,

1350
01:24:53,115 --> 01:24:55,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, which I think will be easier to track.

1351
01:24:55,657 --> 01:24:57,079
[SPEAKER_07]: He's pretty reasonable.

1352
01:24:57,159 --> 01:24:59,501
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to tell him to shut down.

1353
01:24:59,541 --> 01:25:01,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get him on track.

1354
01:25:01,823 --> 01:25:04,625
[SPEAKER_11]: They have to be open for food the whole time?

1355
01:25:04,645 --> 01:25:05,766
[SPEAKER_11]: They didn't get an exception?

1356
01:25:18,842 --> 01:25:29,108
[SPEAKER_12]: The only way is an exception is a general, I think it's called the general section 12 license, which Chevalier has, and they do not have to serve food.

1357
01:25:36,252 --> 01:25:37,713
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think Brian has a general.

1358
01:25:37,733 --> 01:25:39,474
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't.

1359
01:25:47,739 --> 01:25:50,079
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's what he's labeled as.

1360
01:25:51,225 --> 01:25:54,707
[SPEAKER_12]: off on-premise restaurant, right?

1361
01:25:55,487 --> 01:25:59,889
[SPEAKER_12]: Which is the same as a regular section 12 in the city.

1362
01:26:00,289 --> 01:26:09,514
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I mean, if he was under the impression that those were his hours and they're not on a common VIC, I think we should discuss it with him.

1363
01:26:10,734 --> 01:26:16,837
[SPEAKER_12]: And like you say, Alan, we're not gonna tell him to start closing at 11 o'clock, but let's give him a time.

1364
01:26:17,597 --> 01:26:18,238
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's give him 90 days.

1365
01:26:20,072 --> 01:26:34,282
[SPEAKER_12]: To make sure that the proper paperwork is filled out at the city clerk's office, because the city clerk told me personally that 1, when we were looking for Bocelli's and stuff for to be open to 1 am for New Year's.

1366
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:36,561
[SPEAKER_12]: He says, they got to come here.

1367
01:26:37,081 --> 01:26:38,963
[SPEAKER_12]: Then they got to have a ties in the paper.

1368
01:26:39,203 --> 01:26:40,644
[SPEAKER_12]: That takes so many weeks.

1369
01:26:40,864 --> 01:26:42,625
[SPEAKER_12]: Then they got to go before the city council.

1370
01:26:42,665 --> 01:26:44,326
[SPEAKER_12]: And it says it's just for one night.

1371
01:26:44,887 --> 01:26:47,008
[SPEAKER_12]: He says, it's the same for changing the hours.

1372
01:26:47,048 --> 01:26:47,689
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what it is.

1373
01:26:48,049 --> 01:26:48,949
[SPEAKER_12]: So he says, okay.

1374
01:26:49,690 --> 01:26:53,312
[SPEAKER_12]: So if they got to do all of that, let's put a time limit.

1375
01:26:53,433 --> 01:27:03,279
[SPEAKER_12]: You got 90 days and by such and such, if it's not done and approved by the city council, you can only stay open until 11 o'clock.

1376
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:03,620
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1377
01:27:05,035 --> 01:27:05,775
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's fair.

1378
01:27:06,976 --> 01:27:14,779
[SPEAKER_12]: It's technically, I don't think, I don't know if we can even do this because it's out of our jurisdiction.

1379
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:17,240
[SPEAKER_12]: Our jurisdiction is 2 a.m.

1380
01:27:18,561 --> 01:27:24,924
[SPEAKER_12]: with the city clerk's approval and the city council's approval.

1381
01:27:25,244 --> 01:27:27,945
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, they've been doing it.

1382
01:27:29,085 --> 01:27:32,107
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's just, and there's been no trouble.

1383
01:27:33,048 --> 01:27:38,550
[SPEAKER_12]: So let's just continue what we've done with this process in the works.

1384
01:27:39,751 --> 01:27:42,932
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll give them 90 days and see if they can pull it off.

1385
01:27:42,992 --> 01:27:44,232
[SPEAKER_12]: If that sounds fair to you guys.

1386
01:27:44,272 --> 01:27:44,533
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

1387
01:27:44,613 --> 01:27:46,333
[SPEAKER_08]: What if they can't get it done in 90 days?

1388
01:27:46,353 --> 01:27:48,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause that sounds like a process that could take longer.

1389
01:27:48,354 --> 01:27:55,577
[SPEAKER_08]: And also the city, they need to have availability to meet with them, right?

1390
01:27:55,617 --> 01:27:56,917
[SPEAKER_08]: The city councilor.

1391
01:27:57,418 --> 01:27:58,138
[SPEAKER_12]: They just have to,

1392
01:28:00,568 --> 01:28:01,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1393
01:28:01,608 --> 01:28:01,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1394
01:28:02,009 --> 01:28:02,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1395
01:28:02,649 --> 01:28:14,614
[SPEAKER_07]: If he talks on it, like if I talk to him and I tell him, like, right, do this as soon as possible, like start it this week, they will, they will help him as much as they can and it should be done within a month.

1396
01:28:14,634 --> 01:28:14,734
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1397
01:28:14,754 --> 01:28:14,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1398
01:28:14,974 --> 01:28:16,315
[SPEAKER_11]: And council meets every month?

1399
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:17,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

1400
01:28:17,275 --> 01:28:18,256
[SPEAKER_11]: Or every other month?

1401
01:28:18,596 --> 01:28:19,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Twice a month, I believe.

1402
01:28:19,716 --> 01:28:20,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Twice a month.

1403
01:28:20,377 --> 01:28:20,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1404
01:28:20,657 --> 01:28:20,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1405
01:28:21,197 --> 01:28:22,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then that's more than enough.

1406
01:28:22,718 --> 01:28:25,239
[SPEAKER_11]: And the 90 day, yeah, in three months should be, should work.

1407
01:28:25,419 --> 01:28:25,739
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

1408
01:28:25,879 --> 01:28:27,820
[SPEAKER_12]: But they, they have to do the, um,

1409
01:28:30,622 --> 01:28:34,848
[SPEAKER_12]: Advertising and I'm not sure if they have to mail the residents.

1410
01:28:34,968 --> 01:28:36,390
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to look into it, but.

1411
01:28:39,357 --> 01:28:43,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, there's really no direct about us.

1412
01:28:43,038 --> 01:28:44,398
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's the same thing.

1413
01:28:44,458 --> 01:28:45,539
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, we're.

1414
01:28:46,519 --> 01:28:48,179
[SPEAKER_07]: We're opening a business, right?

1415
01:28:48,499 --> 01:28:52,140
[SPEAKER_12]: But that's stuff for the city clerk and the council.

1416
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:53,661
[SPEAKER_12]: It's nothing to do with us.

1417
01:28:53,981 --> 01:28:58,262
[SPEAKER_12]: No, the only thing we do is just get right.

1418
01:28:58,362 --> 01:29:02,423
[SPEAKER_12]: Once we see that comment, Vic, which brings me to the next.

1419
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:18,075
[SPEAKER_12]: thing I just wanted to run it by you guys maybe we could do like a quarterly newsletter out to the licensees something like now it'll be a winter newsletter happy new year blah blah blah

1420
01:29:20,043 --> 01:29:27,911
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to be having a few different, I don't know, we'll put it in certain words, but we're going to have changes this year.

1421
01:29:27,931 --> 01:29:34,657
[SPEAKER_12]: This year's license renewal must include a copy of your common vigilance license.

1422
01:29:36,002 --> 01:29:43,323
[SPEAKER_12]: And the reason being is, in order to have a valid liquor license, they have to have a common vigilance license.

1423
01:29:44,123 --> 01:29:50,485
[SPEAKER_12]: And whatever hours are stated on that common vigilance license, those will be the hours on their liquor license.

1424
01:29:51,425 --> 01:29:54,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Now there's none of this that we're running into now.

1425
01:29:56,066 --> 01:30:04,127
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, and tell them maybe, I don't know, we can bring it up at the next,

1426
01:30:06,225 --> 01:30:17,863
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, annual ABCC training thing that, okay, if you're going to change your hours to want to be open later for New Year's, Christmas Eve, whatever, um,

1427
01:30:19,835 --> 01:30:20,075
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1428
01:30:21,016 --> 01:30:24,418
[SPEAKER_12]: You may want to do this ahead of time, you know?

1429
01:30:24,598 --> 01:30:36,366
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Bob, it's like an informational newsletter that we send out to all our license holders in the city that gives them basically, throughout the year, all kinds of information and heads up.

1430
01:30:37,226 --> 01:30:44,291
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, so people can't come in here and essentially plead ignorance to not knowing something that we have out there.

1431
01:30:45,171 --> 01:30:47,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I would say I'm, I'm in favor of that.

1432
01:30:47,573 --> 01:30:49,054
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a good communication.

1433
01:30:49,074 --> 01:30:51,975
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a good gesture to everybody that we're trying to be team players.

1434
01:30:52,096 --> 01:30:53,176
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um.

1435
01:30:53,196 --> 01:30:56,778
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know who would do it if you would take that role on.

1436
01:30:57,059 --> 01:31:03,843
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I could draft something for Daria to look at because you've got the master list to just send out to all the licensees.

1437
01:31:05,884 --> 01:31:20,782
[SPEAKER_12]: And the thing is, too, is they've never really done fire inspections or the annual inspections with the building department, which is required by law.

1438
01:31:21,342 --> 01:31:22,323
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's kind of like,

1439
01:31:22,944 --> 01:31:27,411
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, this past year, we've done them past year, two years, and it's great.

1440
01:31:27,772 --> 01:31:28,793
[SPEAKER_12]: So now they're used to it.

1441
01:31:29,154 --> 01:31:36,986
[SPEAKER_12]: Now they know that it's their responsibility to get it inspected and have that certificate before we renew their liquor license.

1442
01:31:37,977 --> 01:31:43,479
[SPEAKER_12]: The only thing that it's going to change now is we're going to add a common VIC onto that.

1443
01:31:43,719 --> 01:31:52,663
[SPEAKER_12]: It's their responsibility to show us a valid common VIC with their hours, because common VIC doesn't renew until the end of the year.

1444
01:31:53,343 --> 01:31:56,564
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they start renewing after we already got our renewals.

1445
01:31:57,284 --> 01:32:00,325
[SPEAKER_12]: They start December 1st versus November 1st.

1446
01:32:00,906 --> 01:32:01,646
[SPEAKER_12]: So if they show us 2025s,

1447
01:32:05,773 --> 01:32:06,173
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fine.

1448
01:32:06,253 --> 01:32:07,014
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have to see 2026.

1449
01:32:07,054 --> 01:32:11,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Does Boston do this or does anybody else?

1450
01:32:11,137 --> 01:32:11,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1451
01:32:12,518 --> 01:32:19,224
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a more professional way of running this and it'll require a little more from licensees and it'll set a better standard for them.

1452
01:32:19,284 --> 01:32:21,646
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what I believe we were after.

1453
01:32:21,666 --> 01:32:29,912
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I wanted to be part of the commission is because I think that, yeah, there's some low standards that some of these, they have in their minds of how we operate.

1454
01:32:31,893 --> 01:32:40,436
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it obviously just brings everybody up to speed, what we expect, and actually what the law is.

1455
01:32:41,337 --> 01:32:42,017
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, yeah.

1456
01:32:42,157 --> 01:32:49,180
[SPEAKER_12]: And the thing is, too, so far we've had two of those compliance meetings, and at both of them, I learned a boatload of stuff.

1457
01:32:50,136 --> 01:32:53,299
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm saying, you know, okay, here we go again and another one annually.

1458
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:59,283
[SPEAKER_12]: But I learned more things that the second one that I either forgot or wasn't aware of.

1459
01:33:00,104 --> 01:33:03,266
[SPEAKER_12]: And talking to Ralph, they switch it up every year.

1460
01:33:03,306 --> 01:33:04,287
[SPEAKER_12]: They add new stuff.

1461
01:33:04,827 --> 01:33:06,649
[SPEAKER_12]: So, and it keeps people shocked.

1462
01:33:07,029 --> 01:33:09,971
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, the people that are in the licenses saying, oh, geez, I forgot.

1463
01:33:09,991 --> 01:33:12,253
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I shouldn't be doing this or I shouldn't be doing that.

1464
01:33:12,293 --> 01:33:15,776
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's just benefits everybody.

1465
01:33:17,457 --> 01:33:18,217
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a license.

1466
01:33:18,237 --> 01:33:20,399
[SPEAKER_08]: He's saying, oh, I only saw a few beers a year.

1467
01:33:20,579 --> 01:33:22,220
[SPEAKER_08]: What do I need to come do it?

1468
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:25,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, then don't have a license.

1469
01:33:25,441 --> 01:33:26,482
[SPEAKER_12]: We only had one.

1470
01:33:26,762 --> 01:33:29,423
[SPEAKER_12]: We only had one license that said something this year.

1471
01:33:29,443 --> 01:33:30,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1472
01:33:30,144 --> 01:33:32,265
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was that tamper on Boston.

1473
01:33:32,605 --> 01:33:32,745
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1474
01:33:32,845 --> 01:33:36,747
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, they said, oh, we're thinking even given up by licenses or that.

1475
01:33:36,787 --> 01:33:37,787
[SPEAKER_12]: But they came anyways.

1476
01:33:38,108 --> 01:33:38,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1477
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:43,971
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you know, it's not a big deal to take a couple hours out of your day once a year.

1478
01:33:44,811 --> 01:33:54,215
[SPEAKER_12]: And just to stay on top of it, because it's your business and it can close down like the folks we had here back in November, you know?

1479
01:33:54,375 --> 01:34:02,819
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, or, you know, the porch, obviously they close, but they just don't surrender their license and it makes it harder for the next person, you know, any communication.

1480
01:34:02,839 --> 01:34:04,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they didn't want to have communication, but...

1481
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:08,344
[SPEAKER_08]: hey, you could have just surrendered your license, you're going to use it.

1482
01:34:08,584 --> 01:34:09,686
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, exactly.

1483
01:34:10,227 --> 01:34:14,812
[SPEAKER_12]: And the other thing, too, is we get one other thing we got to take care of is that

1484
01:34:17,849 --> 01:34:20,591
[SPEAKER_12]: early license that they were looking for at 10 a.m.

1485
01:34:21,172 --> 01:34:23,714
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they were looking for 8 a.m., but that's not going to happen.

1486
01:34:23,834 --> 01:34:24,074
[SPEAKER_12]: 10 a.m.

1487
01:34:24,094 --> 01:34:25,395
[SPEAKER_12]: is the earliest you can do it.

1488
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:28,898
[SPEAKER_12]: And being open until 2 a.m.

1489
01:34:28,998 --> 01:34:32,922
[SPEAKER_12]: on New Year's Eve, I don't know, Christmas Eve.

1490
01:34:32,982 --> 01:34:37,906
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a couple of three days if Memorial Day runs into a weekend or something.

1491
01:34:37,986 --> 01:34:41,169
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's Chapter 138, Section 33A and 33B.

1492
01:34:46,553 --> 01:34:52,157
[SPEAKER_12]: And what that does is that it has to be, from what I understand, approved by the council.

1493
01:34:52,658 --> 01:34:53,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Who has asked this?

1494
01:34:54,699 --> 01:34:55,060
[SPEAKER_12]: What's that?

1495
01:34:55,220 --> 01:34:57,382
[SPEAKER_12]: Who asked for that gap?

1496
01:34:57,722 --> 01:34:59,483
[SPEAKER_12]: Whoever wants to be like.

1497
01:35:01,879 --> 01:35:14,009
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, Gab wanted the early hours, so say a restaurant come up to us and they wanted to do a brunch and serve Bloody Mary's at 10 o'clock in the morning on a Sunday morning, that would allow them to do it.

1498
01:35:14,549 --> 01:35:16,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, haven't we approached by one of the clubs?

1499
01:35:16,911 --> 01:35:29,641
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, the Firefighters Club wanted to do, they were having a celebration when the Patriots were playing in England or something, out of the country, and the game was starting here at 9 a.m.

1500
01:35:32,583 --> 01:35:40,048
[SPEAKER_12]: That's when we initially looked into the 33 A and B. The 33 B is for the early opening on Sundays.

1501
01:35:41,249 --> 01:35:44,110
[SPEAKER_12]: But the city has to adopt that.

1502
01:35:46,752 --> 01:35:53,516
[SPEAKER_12]: You spoke with KP Laudaria and they said he couldn't find it in the city ordinance that they ever adopted it.

1503
01:35:53,556 --> 01:35:56,078
[SPEAKER_12]: So we should work on getting that adopted.

1504
01:35:56,118 --> 01:35:58,400
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know whether we have to present to the council.

1505
01:36:00,833 --> 01:36:02,014
[SPEAKER_12]: something to adopt.

1506
01:36:02,034 --> 01:36:05,716
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll ask Ralph about it, see what he, how we have it.

1507
01:36:05,776 --> 01:36:06,357
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, sure.

1508
01:36:06,697 --> 01:36:07,898
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we may as well have it.

1509
01:36:08,098 --> 01:36:09,259
[SPEAKER_12]: It's available to us.

1510
01:36:09,659 --> 01:36:10,900
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not hurting anybody.

1511
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:20,606
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, God forbid somebody wants to start doing brunch or whatever and the customer gets an issue there or whatever.

1512
01:36:21,187 --> 01:36:23,829
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just, you know, we're doing it the right way.

1513
01:36:25,810 --> 01:36:26,350
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's,

1514
01:36:27,352 --> 01:36:32,295
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, I think all I had for notes was just those couple of three things.

1515
01:36:34,116 --> 01:36:36,517
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the compliance meetings are good.

1516
01:36:36,777 --> 01:36:38,298
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we should do another one this year.

1517
01:36:38,958 --> 01:36:40,759
[SPEAKER_12]: It should be held on an annual basis.

1518
01:36:41,239 --> 01:36:45,842
[SPEAKER_12]: We all learned something from it.

1519
01:36:45,862 --> 01:36:48,123
[SPEAKER_12]: It keeps the ABCC happy as well.

1520
01:36:49,404 --> 01:36:56,488
[SPEAKER_12]: So when we need advice or information from them, they're more than willing to help us out like they did with the establishment.

1521
01:36:57,589 --> 01:37:06,011
[SPEAKER_12]: They were able to help that licensee out because his lawyer kind of dropped the ball, if you know what I mean.

1522
01:37:06,591 --> 01:37:11,833
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, it's, it all works and it's the right thing to do.

1523
01:37:13,013 --> 01:37:17,054
[SPEAKER_12]: So, but anyways, anybody else got any new business?

1524
01:37:17,374 --> 01:37:17,454
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1525
01:37:17,514 --> 01:37:23,896
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking about extending the compliance meeting.

1526
01:37:27,461 --> 01:37:40,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so she was saying that she was asking me if all of the licenses have to demonstrate proof of all of these ID check and training certification tests when they renew their license.

1527
01:37:41,615 --> 01:37:45,579
[SPEAKER_07]: And she said, I just got back from a meeting with the high school administration.

1528
01:37:45,599 --> 01:37:49,062
[SPEAKER_07]: They hear that lots of students are getting made by deans online.

1529
01:37:50,033 --> 01:37:58,399
[SPEAKER_07]: I would encourage our offices licensees to look into a scanning system.

1530
01:37:59,140 --> 01:38:06,245
[SPEAKER_07]: They can invest in one and they can obfuscate it over 80 IDs in the first six weeks.

1531
01:38:08,346 --> 01:38:08,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1532
01:38:09,867 --> 01:38:11,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we can include that in the newsletter.

1533
01:38:16,291 --> 01:38:21,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, do we, we don't require it right now, right?

1534
01:38:21,898 --> 01:38:22,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1535
01:38:22,599 --> 01:38:28,307
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't require it, but we have been strongly urging them if there's been a contraction.

1536
01:38:28,928 --> 01:38:29,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1537
01:38:32,053 --> 01:38:36,176
[SPEAKER_07]: You actually want that make sure that we did for one day licenses.

1538
01:38:36,937 --> 01:38:44,142
[SPEAKER_07]: So like the bartender or service, basically you guys, do you have to, or is this person certified?

1539
01:38:44,162 --> 01:38:44,462
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

1540
01:38:44,842 --> 01:38:46,464
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that something we require?

1541
01:38:48,265 --> 01:38:53,969
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't require it because sometimes it doesn't always fall for it.

1542
01:38:54,069 --> 01:38:54,810
[SPEAKER_08]: If you know what I mean?

1543
01:38:54,890 --> 01:38:55,110
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1544
01:38:56,595 --> 01:38:57,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Very small event.

1545
01:38:57,517 --> 01:39:08,614
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, from what I got from Ralph speaking with him before, like when we were discussing what some of the penalties should be in requiring.

1546
01:39:09,723 --> 01:39:15,047
[SPEAKER_12]: the Medford Wine and Spirits to have their folks CHIP certified.

1547
01:39:16,028 --> 01:39:26,735
[SPEAKER_12]: He says you can do that, but from this point forward, anybody that comes to you with violations, you're going to have to require them to do the same thing.

1548
01:39:26,756 --> 01:39:27,156
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1549
01:39:27,793 --> 01:39:28,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Which is fair.

1550
01:39:28,494 --> 01:39:30,835
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I mean, the people that are doing the right thing.

1551
01:39:30,855 --> 01:39:34,618
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's, you know, the employees aren't tip certified.

1552
01:39:34,658 --> 01:39:35,579
[SPEAKER_12]: That's their business.

1553
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:38,021
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it's required.

1554
01:39:38,041 --> 01:39:41,003
[SPEAKER_12]: Or I tend this to be tips.

1555
01:39:41,043 --> 01:39:41,484
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1556
01:39:41,564 --> 01:39:44,726
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if that's actual requirement or not, but.

1557
01:39:46,298 --> 01:39:47,739
[SPEAKER_12]: It, to me, it doesn't seem like it.

1558
01:39:47,779 --> 01:39:50,081
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think I've seen it anywhere in 138.

1559
01:39:51,022 --> 01:40:08,416
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, when we have people come in front of us that, you know, for a hearing like we just did, obviously 395 Main Street's gonna have to get that stipulation put on them if we find any infractions.

1560
01:40:09,577 --> 01:40:14,160
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, that's kind of the way to go with it, I guess.

1561
01:40:15,553 --> 01:40:19,481
[SPEAKER_12]: in Katherine opposite for free.

1562
01:40:20,544 --> 01:40:23,049
[SPEAKER_12]: She's not her Sophie Greenbaum.

1563
01:40:26,356 --> 01:40:34,620
[SPEAKER_12]: she gets funding and it's, and when she posted it and we posted it to all the licensees, the only one that showed up was me.

1564
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:47,465
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was like... For example, that's just a liquor store bottom scanner because they're having a problem and they confiscated all the IDs in the first six weeks, which is totally believable.

1565
01:40:50,027 --> 01:41:03,156
[SPEAKER_08]: But what if somebody needs to hire employees because it's the holidays and not every single person is TIP certified because it's impractical that they could get all TIP certified within that time and then they have a violation?

1566
01:41:05,538 --> 01:41:08,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we asking that before you sell anybody anything?

1567
01:41:12,722 --> 01:41:14,423
[SPEAKER_12]: There's got to be exceptions to the rule.

1568
01:41:14,443 --> 01:41:19,647
[SPEAKER_12]: And like what you just said, during the holidays, employees, temporary employees or whatever.

1569
01:41:21,915 --> 01:41:25,878
[SPEAKER_12]: If they're going to be that busy during the holidays, they're not going to put a newbie alone in the store.

1570
01:41:26,318 --> 01:41:32,082
[SPEAKER_12]: There's going to be somebody else in there that's hopefully TIP certified, that knows what they're doing.

1571
01:41:32,863 --> 01:41:39,728
[SPEAKER_12]: But if the person's going to be hired, I don't know, a month before, two months before, then yeah, get them TIP certified.

1572
01:41:39,788 --> 01:41:40,648
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not a big deal.

1573
01:41:40,989 --> 01:41:45,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Sean, how would you address wagons, for example, the cashiers?

1574
01:41:46,287 --> 01:41:52,094
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they haven't violated yet, done anything that we're going to require that.

1575
01:41:52,354 --> 01:41:54,077
[SPEAKER_11]: So it would be part of.

1576
01:41:55,513 --> 01:41:57,073
[SPEAKER_12]: just when there's a violation.

1577
01:41:57,154 --> 01:41:57,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1578
01:41:58,014 --> 01:42:00,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Just, just if somebody, yeah, I think that's fine.

1579
01:42:00,455 --> 01:42:02,215
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't want to go back in time.

1580
01:42:02,435 --> 01:42:03,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know.

1581
01:42:04,036 --> 01:42:10,958
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say, Oh yeah, you have to have every single person because running a business, I know you just can't have such a big turnover.

1582
01:42:11,278 --> 01:42:11,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1583
01:42:11,578 --> 01:42:22,101
[SPEAKER_08]: But you're talking about this and infraction or something, but I think that getting, sorry, but the getting the scanner are investing in a scanner that could be part of a newsletter out to

1584
01:42:22,481 --> 01:42:23,582
[SPEAKER_08]: all our package stores.

1585
01:42:23,722 --> 01:42:25,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, that's the whole thing.

1586
01:42:25,423 --> 01:42:27,264
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't hear it from us.

1587
01:42:27,424 --> 01:42:29,486
[SPEAKER_08]: You heard, get a scanner.

1588
01:42:29,626 --> 01:42:31,747
[SPEAKER_08]: There's lots of fake IDs out there.

1589
01:42:31,907 --> 01:42:33,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they're rampant on the internet.

1590
01:42:33,528 --> 01:42:34,149
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that.

1591
01:42:34,369 --> 01:42:35,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they expensive?

1592
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:39,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that why they don't have them because they're a lot?

1593
01:42:39,212 --> 01:42:47,177
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think the ones that, not 395, but Medford Wine and Spirits was a big money one that they pay a monthly.

1594
01:42:49,169 --> 01:42:51,270
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it was, I don't know the amount, the cost.

1595
01:42:51,310 --> 01:42:53,452
[SPEAKER_12]: They gave us the number, the model and everything.

1596
01:42:53,492 --> 01:42:59,296
[SPEAKER_12]: I never looked it up, but supposedly they have to pay a monthly fee as well.

1597
01:43:00,177 --> 01:43:06,021
[SPEAKER_12]: And the old one that they had was a less expensive one, and you could only put the license in one.

1598
01:43:06,081 --> 01:43:13,887
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you got okayed or didn't get okayed, then you couldn't put it in again the same day for some reason.

1599
01:43:13,987 --> 01:43:16,289
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know what he was talking about.

1600
01:43:18,085 --> 01:43:19,545
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it was crazy.

1601
01:43:19,645 --> 01:43:22,526
[SPEAKER_12]: But when he upgraded to the new one, you could do it as much as you want.

1602
01:43:22,806 --> 01:43:25,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if you don't want to get one, you can sell it to Wegmans.

1603
01:43:25,667 --> 01:43:29,308
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll pay you 500 grand.

1604
01:43:29,508 --> 01:43:30,949
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just cost of doing business.

1605
01:43:30,969 --> 01:43:32,929
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really feel any kind of way about it.

1606
01:43:32,969 --> 01:43:40,011
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that the fees are so minuscule anyway that if you can't afford to run the business right, then don't run the business.

1607
01:43:40,271 --> 01:43:41,751
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you hit the nail on the head.

1608
01:43:42,252 --> 01:43:44,692
[SPEAKER_12]: Make it incorporated as part of the newsletter.

1609
01:43:47,753 --> 01:43:51,674
[SPEAKER_12]: stating that this commission is requiring you to purchase one.

1610
01:43:52,294 --> 01:43:57,655
[SPEAKER_12]: It's suggested, strongly suggested, something like that.

1611
01:43:57,835 --> 01:44:00,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's just, we'll figure out the wording on that.

1612
01:44:00,876 --> 01:44:02,336
[SPEAKER_11]: But then you're right.

1613
01:44:02,376 --> 01:44:05,557
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I look at the annual license for package stores, $1,500.

1614
01:44:05,677 --> 01:44:08,358
[SPEAKER_11]: I bet you that scanner's a lot more than that.

1615
01:44:09,038 --> 01:44:11,018
[SPEAKER_11]: It is the cost of doing business.

1616
01:44:11,699 --> 01:44:12,799
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll work on those next.

1617
01:44:12,979 --> 01:44:14,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1618
01:44:15,339 --> 01:44:16,400
[SPEAKER_12]: Give us something to work on.

1619
01:44:18,441 --> 01:44:22,204
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so should we make a motion to adjourn?

1620
01:44:22,244 --> 01:44:23,766
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, I motion to adjourn.

1621
01:44:24,306 --> 01:44:24,646
[SPEAKER_12]: What's that?

1622
01:44:24,726 --> 01:44:26,648
[SPEAKER_07]: I take that.

1623
01:44:26,688 --> 01:44:32,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Catherine wanted to see if we could discuss it at the next meeting.

1624
01:44:33,094 --> 01:44:34,775
[SPEAKER_12]: For the scanner type thing?

1625
01:44:36,417 --> 01:44:37,138
[SPEAKER_12]: CHIP certified?

1626
01:44:42,397 --> 01:44:47,598
[SPEAKER_12]: No, we can discuss it, but I don't think we should mandate it, or is that what we have to discuss?

1627
01:44:47,618 --> 01:44:52,139
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I don't even know if we can mandate it.

1628
01:44:52,279 --> 01:44:54,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm not for mandating it, no.

1629
01:44:54,359 --> 01:44:58,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I don't feel the same way.

1630
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:04,041
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, people that are doing the right thing, why put them through that?

1631
01:45:05,521 --> 01:45:11,762
[SPEAKER_12]: If they start doing the wrong thing and there's violations, then, okay, now you mandate it, it doesn't count.

1632
01:45:12,988 --> 01:45:13,808
[SPEAKER_12]: from this point forward.

1633
01:45:13,888 --> 01:45:15,489
[SPEAKER_12]: I just think the team, yeah.

1634
01:45:16,170 --> 01:45:28,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's just, because I'm looking at what everyone took after, and you just talked about how, just to discuss in general, the tips and also to implement a better process for the violation.

1635
01:45:28,256 --> 01:45:32,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I remember being touched based on that.

1636
01:45:32,438 --> 01:45:35,239
[SPEAKER_12]: On the violence police reports?

1637
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:37,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1638
01:45:37,060 --> 01:45:42,643
[SPEAKER_07]: This violation, like, superb level of, so everybody's on the same page, what?

1639
01:45:43,018 --> 01:45:48,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, it's going to be well, to be there or whatever the case.

1640
01:45:49,402 --> 01:45:56,666
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, well, like the suggestion from Ralph was anytime from this point forward, we get a report from the police department.

1641
01:45:57,587 --> 01:46:00,308
[SPEAKER_12]: That licensee is to be notified to appear.

1642
01:46:00,829 --> 01:46:03,991
[SPEAKER_12]: At the next commission meeting, along with the police.

1643
01:46:05,371 --> 01:46:07,233
[SPEAKER_12]: And the police can read the report.

1644
01:46:08,125 --> 01:46:18,613
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll already have a copy of the report and at that point we can look at it and say, yeah, there was no chapter 138 violations here as far as I'm concerned.

1645
01:46:18,673 --> 01:46:22,456
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you'll speak and you'll speak and okay, everybody's cool with it.

1646
01:46:22,556 --> 01:46:28,860
[SPEAKER_12]: And the police will say, yeah, it's a criminal matter or it's not a criminal matter or we felt as though there was no violations and then it's done.

1647
01:46:29,948 --> 01:46:37,954
[SPEAKER_12]: but we have to, whenever we're notified by the police, we have to follow through with it and have them come just like it's going to be a hammering.

1648
01:46:38,655 --> 01:46:39,095
[SPEAKER_11]: Makes sense.

1649
01:46:40,696 --> 01:46:41,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Covers everybody's butt.

1650
01:46:42,137 --> 01:46:43,598
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1651
01:46:44,859 --> 01:46:45,140
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1652
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:46,080
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that was it.

1653
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:48,622
[SPEAKER_12]: So did you want to, what do we do?

1654
01:46:48,682 --> 01:46:51,645
[SPEAKER_12]: Put Catherine on the agenda and she can come in and we can discuss it.

1655
01:46:53,546 --> 01:46:54,467
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's fine.

1656
01:46:54,907 --> 01:46:55,067

1657
01:46:55,648 --> 01:46:56,668
