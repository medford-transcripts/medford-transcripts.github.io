    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=11.268s">The</a>  regular meeting of the Medford School Committee will now come to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=14.251s">The</a>  secretary will call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=29.583s">Present,</a>  seven present, none absent.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=31.184s">All</a>  please rise and salute our flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=32.746s">Welcome,</a>  Justin.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=38.232s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=54.643s">We're</a>  very proud to have with us tonight members of the Met Republic Schools Fine Arts Department, the holiday music presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=61.787s">Take</a>  it away, maestro.</p>

    <p>[Trotter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=69.478s">It's</a>  unfortunate that we always play this tune at this event, because it was written right across the square at Simpson's Tavern many years ago, about the sleigh racing and the bashing right downstairs during grade one, five, and four.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=85.302s">So</a>  here's our arrangement of Jingle Bells.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=285.137s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=285.377s">Van</a>  der Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=287.839s">So</a>  Mr. Zigny, before you and the students go, first I want to tell you how much I was looking forward to hearing you tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=294.485s">So</a>  it's made our night. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=295.406s">Thank</a>  you so very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=297.087s">I</a>  will also tell you it made our night when we went to the orchestra concert at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=302.672s">I</a>  don't think you could get another student on that stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=305.574s">It</a>  was unbelievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=307.275s">As</a>  well, myself and some of my colleagues, including the mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=310.458s">And</a>  Kathy Kreatz, we were able to go to the middle school concert as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=313.921s">And</a>  it's just, I felt so proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=316.462s">And</a>  so proud of our students here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=318.143s">You</a>  represent us so well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=319.745s">And</a>  it's so magnificent that we have this interest in our music program. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=323.927s">And</a>  it's just wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=325.148s">So</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=326.049s">Now,</a>  Mr. Zigny, though, I actually happen to have something I have to give you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=329.451s">So</a>  if you wouldn't mind coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=331.973s">This</a>  is kind of funny, but I just happen to be given a donation of drumsticks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=336.656s">and</a>  from someone who was formally connected and did a student internship at Medford High, and he remembers us so fondly, so here's some drumsticks for you.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=357.875s">Thank</a>  you so much, Mr. Zigney and all members. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=360.337s">You're</a>  fabulous. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=361.277s">We</a>  love listening to you and we're very, very proud of the rich musical tradition we have in our great city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=366.661s">So</a>  thank you and happy holidays.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=369.283s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=373.94s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=374.14s">Cugno,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=375.822s">I</a>  just wanted to say thank you to all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=377.503s">I</a>  know that you're only representing the larger group of all the students that are participating in the orchestra, but not only to the orchestra, but to everyone itself, the marching band, the orchestra, the drama club. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=389.532s">You</a>  guys represent us, and you've done a terrific and wonderful job. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=394.716s">The</a>  other thing I also want to ask Mr. Zigny, and I know I've mentioned it on record here, is that we did get a donation from Mr. John Costas for the lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=404.35s">And</a>  if we could recognize him, well, if you guys could recognize him come the new year, that would be really nice because we do have a lot of people in the city as Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=414.093s">Van</a>  der Kloot, you know, sometimes when someone else might not need something, it is very valuable to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=422.316s">So</a>  I just want to say thank you to all of you.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=433.03s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=434.611s">I'd</a>  also like to make a quick announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=436.192s">There's</a>  a Black Ford Explorer 7MP588 with your lights on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=440.955s">Lights</a>  on? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=441.395s">I</a>  hope you hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=444.137s">It's</a>  all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=444.937s">All</a>  set?</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=447.819s">At</a>  this time, I would like to invite Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=449.92s">Ann</a>  Marie Cuno, vice chairperson of the Medford School Committee, to step forward and conduct the rest of this evening's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=455.284s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=468.585s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=469.746s">Put</a>  them all on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=495.977s">We're</a>  all on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=498.557s">Is</a>  everyone's mic on? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=500.158s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=500.638s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=500.938s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=501.318s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=503.258s">So</a>  the first thing on our agenda is the approval of the minutes of December 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=507.499s">Move</a>  to approve by Mr. Skerry, seconded by? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=509.559s">I</a>  just have a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=511.36s">Oh.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=512.0s">Yes,</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=512.52s">If</a>  that's OK.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=522.061s">I</a>  just wanted to know, in regards to the field trip policy, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=525.709s">if</a>  the teachers and all the other administrators are aware of the school policies, what they need to follow before they make their field trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=538.654s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=538.854s">Nelson,</a>  could you help answer that question? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=542.575s">I</a>  just had a couple of questions from a teacher, and I just wasn't sure if everybody's aware to follow these policies.</p>

    <p>[Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=552.572s">Number</a>  four, the next day I sent it to the administrators informing them that it was officially approved and they were to get it out to the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=563.621s">We</a>  worked on the forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=564.922s">You</a>  have the preliminary forms in front of you this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=568.665s">I</a>  did email <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=571.097s">our</a>  webmaster to put the form, the policy rather, and the forms on the webpage so that it's available to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=578.221s">But</a>  my assumption is that the principals did inform their staff about the policy shortly after it was sent to them.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=585.265s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=587.066s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=588.026s">And</a>  I just had one more. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=592.249s">I</a>  just wanted to know from Superintendent Belson if there was an update on the ongoing investigation with the <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=600.18s">concussion</a>  that was on the soccer field on October 11th, 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=604.362s">Did</a>  you hear anything from the superintendent in Beverly? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=607.423s">Is</a>  there an update?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=608.804s">So</a>  I emailed the superintendent in Beverly with the details that I felt were pertinent to the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=615.067s">I've</a>  given you a quick update the other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=617.848s">I'm</a>  waiting to hear back from him. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=619.829s">I</a>  did speak with him and I feel like something will be forthcoming from Beverly very shortly.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=626.052s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=629.311s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=629.491s">Kreatz,</a>  you all set?</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=773.168s">Okay,</a>  report of the committee, which is next. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=775.79s">Report</a>  of the committees, committee of the whole meeting, minutes for December 11th, 2017.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=783.315s">So</a>  if you would, Mrs. Cugno, I think that tonight it would be appropriate to just quickly say that we met at 6.30 on December 11th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=794.462s">All</a>  of us were present, as well as Michael Ruggiero, school committee elect, Paul Rousseau, school committee elect, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=801.197s">The</a>  superintendent, deputy superintendent, director of curriculum, Bernard Riccadeli, and community members, Jen Graham, Michelle Ciccolo, and Franco Leary. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=811.287s">The</a>  purpose of the meeting was to establish a process for the selection of the next superintendent, to identify the criteria for selection, to review application forms for candidates, and to initiate a process for selection. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=825.005s">The</a>  superintendent spoke about different items, going over what our challenges would be, what its job description should be, giving us some information about the MASS, that's Massachusetts Superintendent Organization, salary information, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=842.152s">The</a>  outcome of this meeting was that the mayor appointed a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=847.694s">She</a>  appointed me as chair, Mrs. Mustone, Mrs. Kreatz, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=854.897s">It</a>  doesn't say here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=856.258s">Jenny?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=856.858s">Jen.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=857.678s">What's</a>  your name? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=858.058s">Jenny</a>  Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=858.879s">And?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=860.179s">Michael.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=860.879s">And</a>  Paul Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=861.66s">And</a>  Paul Rousseau, sorry about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=863.781s">And</a>  we are going to meet this Thursday, December 21st at 715 up at the high school to carry forward our charge of coming up with a questionnaire and also a information document that could be given out to prospective candidates.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=885.319s">Okay,</a>  just a clarification, if I may, 715 AM or PM?</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=888.743s">PM.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=890.485s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=891.206s">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=891.827s">We</a>  had talked about AM, so it's a good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=893.929s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=896.612s">Madam</a>  Chair? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=898.093s">Also,</a>  during this meeting, we turned out some job applications and job descriptions that I asked the members of the committee to <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=906.312s">look</a>  at and review to see if they had any suggested changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=909.554s">We</a>  did receive some from Kathy.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=911.375s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=912.176s">And</a>  I likewise have some changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=914.538s">We</a>  can circulate them around so that everyone can take a look at them and see if they concur. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=919.021s">And</a>  then we can send our suggestions to the superintendent to make the amendments.</p>

    <p>[Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=923.183s">Madam</a>  Secretary, accept the report and place on file.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=925.765s">Madam</a>  Secretary.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=926.606s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=928.547s">Just</a>  on that topic, I was wondering if the mayor could at some point possibly give us <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=936.744s">a</a>  list of criteria for school committee members to be on the committee and how she's going to make that decision?</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=942.288s">We</a>  will all be on the committee for the internal candidate portion of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=945.97s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=946.33s">So</a>  it will be an open session, and it will be all seven of us.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=949.652s">And</a>  then moving forward from that, only two members will be allowed to be on?</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=952.994s">And</a>  then we have, I handed out a draft application for those that are interested in applying to be on the search committee if we need to go that far. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=961.92s">OK,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=962.621s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=963.623s">And</a>  I had a question also. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=966.504s">So</a>  I wanted to know, because I think some of the public community was asking me, why are there only two school committee members allowed for the external search? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=976.425s">And</a>  I couldn't quite remember the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=979.006s">And</a>  I wanted to know if there was any opportunity for there to be an alternate where two committee members could serve for five meetings, and then another two committee members could serve for another five meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=992.237s">so</a>  that everybody would have an exposure if we get to that level.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=996.361s">If</a>  I may on that one?</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=997.502s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=998.342s">When</a>  we sat down with Glenn Kuchar from the MASC, the executive director, there are a lot of legal policies that we need to abide by. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1008.551s">And</a>  so that was one of the reasons that we can't have more than a certain amount of school committee members on that particular committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1015.958s">If</a>  we do, then we also have to discuss as a school committee <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1019.541s">if</a>  you want to waive the rights of executive session, and that means that everything would have to be open meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1026.544s">And</a>  that's something that you, as a committee, have to sit down and discuss on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1032.167s">So</a>  that would be one. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1033.708s">And</a>  the other reason, I also believe that it had come up in discussion if we wanted to alternate people, but it got to the point where it would be very <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1042.777s">we're</a>  kind of like playing very fine line with that law. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1047.419s">And</a>  a lot of the things, again, when people are asking us questions like this, it's not because Medford wants to deal with it like this, and I'm not saying it to cover ourselves, but it's actually rules and regulations and federal government that we need to abide by laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1063.067s">So</a>  that was the reason we can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1066.635s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1067.175s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1069.516s">So</a>  Mr. Skerry had a motion to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1071.797s">Who</a>  was seconded? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1073.298s">Seconded.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1074.238s">Seconded</a>  by Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1076.519s">All</a>  in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1077.439s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1077.68s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1077.86s">OK,</a>  so the committee and the whole meetings are approved and placed on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1084.422s">Community</a>  participation, Maureen Roney. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1089.184s">Roney,</a>  I apologize.</p>

    <p>[8uC6Vq145lQ_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1092.417s">So</a>  I am here tonight because of my ongoing concerns about the math program test scores at the Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1098.66s">But</a>  Mr. Superintendent, I understand that you have an update.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1102.681s">I</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1102.981s">Would</a>  you like me to do that instead of speaking to yourself right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1108.564s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1109.744s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1109.944s">So</a>  this evening, I passed out an update based on our discussions about what might be possible in order to provide additional assistance to students at the Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1122.433s">In</a>  your packets, you have a much more comprehensive discussion about additional measures that we're doing, but apropos to some suggestions made from the outside, including Mrs. Ronay, I put this memo together to give you a clarification, an update of what additional things we're going to do, and if you'll permission, I'll read it publicly so everyone can hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1146.645s">Do</a>  you have a copy? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1149.93s">As</a>  part of our plan to assist students at the Columbus with their mathematics preparation for MCAS 2.0, please note the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1158.012s">Students</a>  in grades three, four, and five who require extra assistance to master the mathematics curriculum will be eligible to receive additional tutoring from paid Medford Public Schools teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1170.396s">Students</a>  will receive between one and two hours per week based upon their need. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1176.077s">It</a>  depends on what the student's need is, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1178.584s">you</a>  know, what kinds of recommendations their individual teachers make. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1182.186s">We</a>  expect to hire six teachers for two hours each as tutors a week, who will be paid by the Medford Public Schools from our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1190.069s">This</a>  program is planned for 16 weeks starting in January, and the projected cost is an additional $6,200. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1197.113s">We</a>  project that the cost of an extra afternoon bus at the Columbus will be paid approximately $150 a day for a total of $4,800. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1207.339s">We're</a>  working with our current provider, Easton Bus, to arrange a schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1211.501s">We</a>  may have to find another provider since Easton's schedule is very tight and additional busing may not be possible through them, although we had discussions with them this afternoon and we think it is possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1222.047s">But</a>  since there are three buses leaving the Columbus each day with different routes, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1226.796s">We</a>  will have to devise a route that serves the majority of students in the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1230.719s">And</a>  there may be a need to create a consolidated route. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1233.581s">Obviously,</a>  buses go in different directions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1236.784s">In</a>  order for us to create a consolidated route, there may have to be some different types of stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1241.468s">The</a>  overall cost of transportation, we believe, will be about $4,800. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1248.85s">Since</a>  there are, well, the overall cost then is projected between tutorial and busing to be about $11,200 for the 16 weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1257.692s">There</a>  are multiple logistical issues to be worked out and there may need to be some modifications. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1262.893s">We'll</a>  make those adjustments based upon multiple factors. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1266.054s">We'll</a>  keep the school committee informed as we progress with implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1269.455s">Things</a>  like which teachers volunteer to teach, which days are most appropriate, which days the buses can go and what routes and so on and so forth.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1279.117s">There's</a>  a number of things to be worked out in the interim, but this is the basic plan and hopefully that addresses your issue Thank you, thank you for handling this so quickly mr. Belson in such a proactive way that's what we hope to be and <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1300.437s">as</a>  a committee find out that there is an issue and be very proactive about handling it so that way it doesn't continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1307.203s">So</a>  thank you for handling it so quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1309.885s">I</a>  just have a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1311.046s">Based</a>  on this math, $150 a day for a bus for a total of $4,800 divided by 16 weeks, that's two days a week for a bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1321.974s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1323.135s">That's</a>  the way we're planning it right now.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1324.837s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1325.924s">Also,</a>  so since we have a bus at that school and leaving, can the kids in the extracurricular programs take the bus as well home? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1335.189s">So</a>  that way, more kids that can have access to after school activities, since we're already paying $150 per bus, given that if there's enough room, can we look at opening that up, please?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1348.867s">That's</a>  a variable we should look at, but I don't want to make any commitments till I see exactly how many students are riding the bus for this particular program, because I just don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1358.13s">It</a>  could be concentrated in a full bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1360.391s">It</a>  could be that we have a lot of room. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1362.652s">So</a>  let us get into the weeds, and we'll see exactly what's possible.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1367.017s">And</a>  what is the criteria for the students that would be picked for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1370.199s">Is</a>  it their grades? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1371.42s">Is</a>  it their MCAT scores? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1373.582s">Is</a>  it a combination of both? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1376.264s">What</a>  is the criteria for a student to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1378.185s">Would</a>  it be parent request?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1379.946s">We'll</a>  sit with the teachers and the principal to look at which students clearly need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1383.449s">If</a>  a student's doing exceptionally well, then chances are they don't want the help. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1387.451s">If</a>  a student really needs it, we hope that they will want to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1391.154s">I</a>  can't make anybody participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1393.496s">There's</a>  some people that maybe don't want to participate who could use the help.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1396.942s">Or</a>  there might be a parent that wants their child to participate, even though it may look like they're doing well in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1402.983s">But</a>  what they see at home, the struggle at homework, is not always the same as it is in the classroom, as I remember it as a parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1412.565s">So</a>  I would like the parents to have some say and input, or at least be able to request it for their child as well.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1419.966s">I</a>  think we've got to begin with, let's target the students that we're looking at, and then we can <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1424.627s">open</a>  it up a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1425.708s">But</a>  let's see exactly what kind of response we've got. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1428.43s">And</a>  I've also got to make sure I've got six teachers that want to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1432.572s">And</a>  I feel they can actually do that particular work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1436.255s">So</a>  there's a few things that variables, like I say, the logistics have to be worked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1441.298s">And</a>  until we actually talk to people specifically at the school and work out some of the details as to how many students would be on which days, there may be some students who want to come one day, some will want to come two days. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1453.527s">Got</a>  to work it out.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1454.362s">So</a>  at this time, I'd like to motion to approve this program and get that going. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1458.544s">And</a>  I would like a follow-up report the first meeting back in January, since time is of the essence, because MCAS are coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1468.188s">They</a>  don't slow down for anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1469.688s">So</a>  we want to make sure we get the word out to parents as quickly as we can that this program is going to be taking place, and that they can have some input as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1478.793s">Thank</a>  you so much again, and there's a motion on the floor to have this approved and to have an update.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1484.996s">If</a>  I can just suggest that, what do you call it, that the update, I can give you a briefer update through email or through some process, but it may take an extra little time to work out some of the logistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1495.281s">Because</a>  remember, next week is going to be a fairly, well this week rather, is going to be a fairly chopped up week with different things going on, and the logistics of getting commitments from people to do things may take a little bit of time in January.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1508.644s">And</a>  even if you only have partial update, just either by email or at our next meeting, we want to be kept abreast of this issue.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1516.567s">We'll</a>  keep you posted.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1517.847s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1518.247s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1518.387s">Van</a>  de Kloop?</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1520.248s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1521.248s">A</a>  couple of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1522.389s">I</a>  just wanted to mention that in our folders, we also received all the other things, all the other plans, adding 15 minutes of math instruction daily. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1535.78s">Chromebook</a>  practice so that we had a further report which covered additional in-school items that would be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1549.063s">It</a>  also, though I just wanted to clarify, and Mr. Superintendent, I know we're being redundant here, but I understand that you're now committed to having a after school tutoring for the math students paid for by the district, because I'm just clarifying that, because earlier there was a rumor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1570.231s">And</a>  so I want to put that to rest. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1572.253s">And</a>  committed to working out transportation, after school transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1577.339s">It</a>  sounds like so far, financially, you've committed to at least two days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1582.464s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1582.925s">That's</a>  our plan.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1583.786s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1584.266s">I</a>  know that your request would have preferred three. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1586.969s">I</a>  think two is probably a reasonable place to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1589.852s">So,</a>  okay, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1591.213s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1592.053s">And</a>  I would like to thank you very much from the get-go. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1595.734s">You've</a>  been very, very concerned about this issue, Maureen, and I thank you for coming forth and addressing us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1603.336s">And</a>  see, I told you it'd be easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1605.717s">The</a>  other thing, too, is, though, I think that when I went and first met Maureen at the math night, one of the things that just stood out so <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1616.244s">much</a>  that night was when I had a great discussion with some of the teachers, and they were telling me about all the different things our math program could do, but then admitted that not every student had access to that at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1627.95s">So</a>  by providing this after school time, this gives them an opportunity to utilize those, our math program to the full. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1635.894s">So</a>  thank you very much, Mr. Superintendent, and thank you, Maureen.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1639.876s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1642.169s">Through</a>  you to the superintendent, thank you for putting this report together, Mr. Paulson. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1645.671s">It's</a>  very comprehensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1647.912s">I</a>  as one member have been very vocal when it comes to MCAS tutoring, and I'm glad to see that we're reaching out to <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1654.29s">the</a>  middle schools and help them with their math and other problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1657.832s">I</a>  would ask that you report back to your committee in late April, early May on the trials and tribulations of putting this program in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1666.997s">See</a>  where we can do better, see what works, and possibly incorporate it into the other schools that need this.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1673.441s">Can</a>  we discuss it?</p>

    <p>[Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1674.201s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1675.755s">Okay,</a>  and if I may, just for clarification, because I know Mr. Scottie just mentioned middle school, but is it elementary school that we're discussing?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1681.944s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1682.324s">Okay,</a>  I just wanted to make sure of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1686.19s">I</a>  just want to piggyback a little bit on what Mr. Benedetto said. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1690.233s">I</a>  think it's a great idea if we could utilize the buses when we have students that are staying after school, but with that being said, I just want to make sure that the students that are there for this particular purpose and service are being addressed first in a way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1704.665s">I</a>  don't want to kick anybody off a bus, but if this is a program that we're going to be investing in, I want to make sure that everyone gets the best possible opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1713.362s">to</a>  utilize it the best we possibly can. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1715.784s">So</a>  with that being said, let's see, are we gonna roll call on, not a roll call, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1723.371s">It</a>  was Mr. Benedetto that had put the motion in and Mr. Skerry had second. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1727.936s">So</a>  all in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1729.117s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1730.718s">Any</a>  opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1733.02s">Seven</a>  in the affirmative, none in the negative.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1735.128s">Madam</a>  Chair, since we're expending money, I think we should do a roll call.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1738.751s">Roll</a>  call. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1739.711s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1740.172s">So</a>  on the motion, Mrs. Cugno? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1741.973s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1742.554s">Mrs.</a>  DiBenedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1743.534s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1744.235s">Mrs.</a>  Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1744.955s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1745.296s">Mrs.</a>  Mustone? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1746.136s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1746.517s">Mr.</a>  Scurry? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1747.157s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1747.617s">Mrs.</a>  Van der Kloot? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1748.338s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1748.658s">Mayor</a>  Burke?</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1749.199s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1750.56s">OK,</a>  seven in the affirmative and none in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1753.562s">We</a>  will be passing that and starting up the program as soon as we can and placed in file. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1760.127s">So</a>  recommendations to accept the gift to the Robotics Club, Mr. Superintendent?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1764.683s">I'm</a>  going to call upon Carolyn Joy, who's here, our Director of Mathematics, to come up and talk about the very generous gift, once again, from Dr. Martinez, I'm sure.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1965.254s">So</a>  I just want to make it clear to everyone that the work that the students are doing through the department <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1971.698s">It's</a>  not only incredible, but I've been told that at least one of the robots they're creating is going to apply as an internal candidate for my job.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1994.193s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1996.215s">Roll</a>  call, please.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2012.708s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2013.168s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2013.569s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2014.77s">Report</a>  on Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2020.501s">This</a>  is something that's been in the works for a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2023.204s">Mr.</a>  Trotta has continued to be involved as the director along with Michael Skorka as the coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2029.79s">And</a>  you have some materials in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2031.351s">I'm</a>  going to let Mr. Trotta tell you about what's here and have some of the students and Mr. Skorka tell you a little bit more because I think this is a terrific project and it's got tremendous implications for the development of our young people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2044.043s">not</a>  only as academics, but as full-blown citizens in our community and in the world, where I think that's a bigger need these days.</p>

    <p>[Trotter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2053.191s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2053.771s">Richard</a>  Trott, Director of the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, better known as the CCSR. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2060.897s">Before</a>  I begin the report, though, I wanted to say that I've had the pleasure of working with Mr. Cuno and Mrs. Carey for many years, and both of you have been so supportive of all the programs in the schools, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2072.517s">You</a>  truly have been a real positive influence on what I've been involved with. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2079.778s">And</a>  so I wish you well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2081.759s">I</a>  hope I still see you after you leave the seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2085.16s">And</a>  so thank you for working to help the kids in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2089.661s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2092.601s">So</a>  the CCR has a mission. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2094.141s">The</a>  basic mission is to create global citizens who will combat things like racism, bigotry, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2102.105s">gender</a>  bias, and help promote positive experiences to other students in their own lives to help them become successful in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2112.53s">So</a>  the students who work in the CCSR, and we have some here tonight, they do positive things in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2120.674s">But</a>  it helps the community, but it also helps them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2122.915s">And</a>  the whole point of the program is to make the world a better place, and you do it one student at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2128.953s">We</a>  are very active at the high school and we are spreading the program down to elementary and middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2136.797s">Last</a>  year we were very low on funding so we basically just did the high school as the only major area for the projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2144.34s">This</a>  year we have a grant from the Cummings Foundation, a $100,000 grant that we obtained, that's allowing us to expand the program and do more things in the school district to help the students and the faculty. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2159.52s">So</a>  a couple of major things are going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2161.581s">One</a>  is we've awarded 10 mini grants to faculty members to do projects at their schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2167.964s">We</a>  hope a full report later on in the year when they've actually accomplished their work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2171.786s">But</a>  right now I can tell you that we have a project that did Thanksgiving meals for needy people with a French class, so using French cuisine. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2183.392s">We</a>  have, we're organizing a race, a road race to raise money for a charity with some of the students at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2191.654s">We're</a>  beautifying the Medford High School grounds by planting fruit trees around the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2197.216s">So</a>  that's an environmental project. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2200.077s">We're</a>  adding composting to the cafeterias at the high school to teach the students to be environmentally friendly and to maximize the resources that people use and not waste things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2213.407s">We're</a>  also helping at the Brooks students, helping renovate a play area for other students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2220.469s">So</a>  one of the teachers down there is working with us on that and with the school people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2224.991s">So</a>  those are some of those mini-grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2227.031s">Mini-grants,</a>  they have to apply for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2229.092s">They</a>  have to show the project and what the outcome is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2232.353s">And</a>  you get them by, not competitive, but you have to prove that you're doing something valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2238.895s">We</a>  also have five total. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2241.407s">school</a>  leader advisors, similar to Mr. Skorka. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2244.189s">They're</a>  just getting going now, and they're gonna be organizing multiple events at their schools, and provide leadership for the school, but also the students become leaders at that school, and set the role models for other students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2255.474s">And</a>  one of the things that students typically do, they look at other students as role models, and if they see them doing positive things, we're hoping that that will spread, and more students will do positive things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2273.457s">So</a>  right now at the high school, we have a very active group. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2277.321s">I'm</a>  not going to go into that too much deeply, but it's coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2280.304s">There</a>  were 33 projects going on right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2283.127s">And</a>  so I'll let Mr. Skorka and his students talk about those. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2287.01s">So</a>  some of the things planning for this year with the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2288.832s">Now,</a>  we didn't have this funding before, so now we've got some new innovations going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2293.317s">We've</a>  added professional development for teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2295.119s">We're</a>  going to be offering workshops. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2297.16s">We're</a>  going to work on SEL, social-emotional learning in the classroom, and also ways of technologies that we can use to improve teaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2308.726s">For</a>  instance, one of the things that we feel strongly about is project-based learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2312.928s">Project-based</a>  learning emphasizes student activity in the learning process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2317.09s">It</a>  emphasizes students being engaged and actually doing something they have an interest in. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2323.018s">We</a>  believe by doing this, they will certainly gain a positive result and there'll be more of an impact on the learning when they're actively involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2331.901s">So</a>  that's one of the things that we're gonna do professional development on to help other teachers do that sort of thing, whether it's in our area of focus or on their own area of focus. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2342.604s">But</a>  clearly, project-based learning is a philosophical initiative that we believe in. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2349.621s">We</a>  also want to provide parents with information. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2352.962s">We're</a>  gonna have some activities at night, speakers and symposium type things that will help parents gain more information about how do you deal with anxiety with students, how do you deal with students who exhibit certain behaviors that might lead to problems with their self esteem and their resiliency to fight negative activities like drug use and that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2377.255s">We're</a>  also looking at new strategies in thinking and learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2380.678s">The</a>  mirror neuron is a relatively new concept that students, people, identify with other people by mirror neuron in the brain. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2391.366s">We</a>  feel that some students in the early ages who lack empathy, maybe by going through this kind of a process of identifying with other people who have problems will help them become more empathetic. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2402.815s">So</a>  that's kind of a goal at the elementary and middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2409.416s">So</a>  we're also gonna use the money that we have for resources on the web. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2413.778s">We're</a>  gonna provide web resources for teachers and parents about this social-emotional area and about identifying positive activities for parents to use and teachers to use in the classroom and at home to make them students more, more positive contributors to society. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2436.498s">And</a>  the last initiative is we want to share our mission. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2439.459s">We</a>  believe that this kind of a program should exist in more public schools, more areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2446.662s">We</a>  spend a ton of time doing academics, MCAS and all that, but it seems to be a need now to do more work in developing character and positive attributes in students that will lead them to be successful and not to be subject to things like addiction and prejudice. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2467.95s">I</a>  want to, before, as I finish, I want to thank the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2472.771s">Actually,</a>  we, so this mission came and vision came from a conversation we had a few times back when we got the money from Bloomberg. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2480.614s">So</a>  superintendent is part of the brainstorm behind this thing and he's always supported us and his support has been very critical to our success. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2489.792s">And</a>  also the school committee, obviously all of you have supported us and I look forward to getting to do more with you guys and be back again. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2498.515s">You</a>  thought you got rid of me? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2499.456s">Oh,</a>  you haven't. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2501.997s">Okay,</a>  so are there any questions before I pass it on to Michael's book?</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2505.578s">Before</a>  I pass it on to anybody else, I just want, I have a couple of questions and that is, how long is this grant for?</p>

    <p>[Trotter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2513.101s">It's</a>  three years.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2514.482s">And</a>  this is our second? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2516.305s">first</a>  and then just because it's been such a great program and already there's been so much going on at the end of the three years have they already discussed like what the process is going to be if you're going to be able to reapply for it or is it so we are going to be able to reapply or is it like one of those you can't reapply for it for a certain amount of time oh okay</p>

    <p>[Trotter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2541.9s">I</a>  thought I'd look into that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2543.281s">But</a>  we're also not stopping with the Cummings Foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2546.042s">We're</a>  looking for other resources.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2547.702s">You're</a>  looking for what?</p>

    <p>[Trotter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2548.403s">Other</a>  resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2549.303s">We're</a>  looking for other venues and foundations to contribute.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2554.645s">And</a>  I don't know if this is more of a question for you or for Mr. Skorka, but <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2560.217s">I</a>  know already you have so much on here, but just to throw it out, I know a lot of the time when I've gone to the senior centers, they ask us about our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2573.966s">And</a>  some of the seniors, unfortunately, have not had the opportunity to be with our seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2580.091s">with</a>  our high school students, I meant to say, with our high school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2583.394s">So</a>  you hear, you know, certain stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2585.135s">And</a>  I've heard this year, you know, well, if you're on the school committee, then why don't you try to teach those young folks some manners or some respect? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2594.804s">And</a>  when I hear things like that, I get very upset because they're touching my kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2600.589s">And</a>  I know the type of kids that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2603.191s">So</a>  if you have the opportunity, because I tell them all the time that our kids do have respect and they do have manners, and you'd be very surprised at what our kids do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2612.9s">If</a>  we have the opportunity and if you could throw that in your schedule somehow, somewhere, I would really like to see that collaboration going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2621.068s">I</a>  think it would be amazing for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2623.71s">just</a>  as much as it's amazing for us and our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2626.191s">I</a>  know bringing my own kids with me to certain events that I didn't think maybe, you know, the senior center would be happy to have kids when they were younger, or vice versa. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2635.334s">It</a>  was amazing when I left there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2637.314s">Because</a>  they loved that interaction, and my kids actually love the interaction of hearing all these different stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2643.636s">And</a>  it's nice, they're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2645.517s">They're</a>  in our center of our square. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2647.177s">They're</a>  in the center of the heart of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2649.138s">It</a>  would be nice for them to know what type of students we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2653.92s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2655.101s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2656.522s">I</a>  just wanted some more logistics about the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2660.186s">Now,</a>  I know that Mr. Skorkis, you've retired from the school district, and you're still involved in this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2669.915s">Is</a>  it your intent to stay with it for the next three years?</p>

    <p>[Trotter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2673.518s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2674.559s">And</a>  then does it <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2678.212s">Does</a>  this project and this grant free up any teaching time for Mr. Skorka so he can focus on this or is this after school? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2686.45s">How</a>  does that whole thing work?</p>

    <p>[Trotter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2689.463s">He</a>  has a mini, where he has some students, which is two times a cycle, a mini course. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2695.587s">But</a>  most of his work is on his own time after school, during free periods. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2700.05s">So</a>  if he could get freed up a class, that would be marvelous.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2703.893s">Now,</a>  does he get paid for his time in addition to his salary for this project? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2708.496s">Is</a>  that part of the grant funding?</p>

    <p>[Trotter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2710.077s">What's</a>  that?</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2710.798s">Is</a>  there a stipend for him? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2711.958s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2712.399s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2713.7s">And</a>  yourself as part of this project? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2717.022s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2717.756s">OK,</a>  I just want to make sure that we're not burning out some of our finest and best within the district by having them wear too many hats. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2728.06s">And</a>  I didn't know if it was something that the school district was partially funding by helping him with that, or if that's a dream in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2738.104s">Maybe</a>  the superintendent can enlighten me a little bit more of the logistics of all of this.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2743.066s">So</a>  obviously, all these programs, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2748.03s">We</a>  seek outside funding to support them long-term. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2751.713s">Originally,</a>  the funding came from Bloomberg Philanthropies. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2756.416s">Cummings</a>  is the next round. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2757.958s">It's</a>  a three-year grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2760.039s">We'll</a>  be looking to get more money into this activity and expand it and develop it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2766.104s">I</a>  might tell you, I think I mentioned it once before, that Mr. Cummings, William Cummings, is going to be a special speaker at graduation this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2775.03s">And</a>  we'll be having other <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2777.672s">outreaches</a>  to different people at different times because obviously philanthropy is an important piece of what we do in order to keep some of these programs going and to develop them into model programs that can then receive even greater sources of funding long term. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2794.337s">So</a>  that's the game plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2795.418s">And</a>  obviously the great work, I think, you know, they'll tell you that they're finalists already in some outside programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2802.567s">We're</a>  already getting some great recognition. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2805.408s">I</a>  won't spoil this at this particular thing, but I was told on Saturday night that another one of our programs is going to go national. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2813.611s">So</a>  I'm excited about that, but you can't find out about it tonight because I can't tell you why. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2818.993s">But</a>  these are the kinds of things we want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2820.994s">And</a>  as we do these things, we attract sources of funding that are extraordinary and support our efforts to keep <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2830.096s">meaningful</a>  projects moving in addition to our regular academic and educational program.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2836.202s">So</a>  my point was, based on the social, emotional needs of so many students that I see, both at the district I work at and our district, and this book of wonderful things that have been done, I just didn't know if <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2853.965s">We</a>  had plans on expanding this program so that way it's like more full-time position for someone from the Method Public Schools to manage because this is a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2864.074s">This</a>  is a lot of wonderful things and I would just hate for it to go away, to go away.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2867.777s">We</a>  just need to develop it over time, you know what I mean, and develop other dimensions to it and create it in a certain way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2874.062s">One</a>  of the things that's happening, again something I'll tell you about, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2877.524s">at</a>  a subsequent meeting, is the Commonwealth Department of Elementary and Secondary Education is launching what they call it Celebrating Massachusetts Leading the Nation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2889.347s">And</a>  we had a meeting with representatives from the department the other day and the purpose of it was to identify projects in our school system and some other school systems that would demonstrate how Massachusetts leads the nation beyond testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2904.851s">Because</a>  obviously testing is something that <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2907.498s">we</a>  brag about as a nation, I mean, as a school system, not a school system, as a state, as a commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2915.4s">But</a>  there are many other dimensions to education that Massachusetts leads the nation in. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2921.762s">And</a>  this is a good example of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2923.783s">And</a>  there's some other really terrific examples, our family networks, other things like that, that are really unique and model programs that other people should be trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2933.823s">because</a>  they fill the gaps that many communities don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2937.024s">So</a>  this is one of them, and this will also bring in resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2941.326s">This</a>  is how you do it.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2942.366s">So</a>  just as we increase the number of school adjustment Councilors and Councilors and, you know, different behavior lists throughout buildings, this is a positive way to bring that forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2953.731s">And</a>  I think that as a committee, we should really look at positive ways to influence and to enable our children to become leaders. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2961.274s">But</a>  in order to have that, we need to have people <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2964.063s">like</a>  Mr. Trotter and like Mr. Skorka to lead the way and have these programs and to really invest in this in our district. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2974.846s">That's</a>  my point. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2976.687s">I</a>  just want to make sure that we don't burn out people by trying to do everything, and we just want things to be done well.</p>

    <p>[Trotter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2984.849s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2986.01s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2990.364s">Well,</a>  okay, so thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2991.79s">I'd</a>  like to pass the baton to Mr. Skorka and the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2996.005s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Skorka]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3002.387s">Hi,</a>  good evening, Michael Skorka. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3004.269s">I'm</a>  the advisor at the High School for the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3008.554s">I'll</a>  keep this brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3010.035s">As</a>  Rich was telling you, right now at the high school, we have, you have the booklet in front of you, we have just over 35 projects happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3020.746s">Many</a>  of them are at the high school, but a majority of them are happening <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3024.77s">citywide.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3025.951s">And</a>  I'm looking at the mayor here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3027.712s">You've</a>  met with a lot of our students already. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3029.413s">I</a>  want to thank you so much for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3031.414s">I</a>  think you've met with three or four groups already and you're meeting with another one next week, they tell me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3036.316s">We</a>  appreciate the collaboration. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3037.757s">I'm</a>  thankful for all of your support. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3039.998s">Superintendent</a>  Belson, very thankful for your support as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3043.62s">This</a>  is, like I said, a collaborative effort and we couldn't do it without the support of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3047.482s">So</a>  thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3049.823s">In</a>  addition to the 35 projects or so, we have 84 members <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3054.742s">at</a>  the high school right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3056.623s">It</a>  has grown exponentially since the first year we started to include students in the first year that at the high school with student involvement was only 18. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3064.707s">So</a>  we went from 18 students to 84. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3067.689s">And</a>  it's growing every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3069.15s">I</a>  have students coming up to me asking to be part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3071.711s">and</a>  the club is inclusive of anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3074.193s">So</a>  anybody who would like to join, that is interested in doing a project to help other people, interested in being a positive contributor to society, we're looking for them and we never say no. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3086.081s">The</a>  point really is I'm really the guide on the side for a lot of these projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3090.104s">The</a>  students approach me with something that they're passionate about, something that they've been thinking about changing or an idea that they had to maybe make the community a better place. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3099.31s">And</a>  so I sit with them, I've sat with all 84 of them so far, and we come up with a strategy to make that plan happen, to set that plan in motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3108.637s">Maybe</a>  it's meeting with some of you, maybe it's talking to somebody in the building, or maybe it's just really starting from the ground up and seeing where the project can go. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3116.263s">All</a>  of these projects will happen throughout the course of the school year this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3120.268s">Many</a>  of them, the majority of them, will be finished in May where we have a fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3124.634s">As</a>  Rich mentioned, we have started the CCSR at four schools now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3129.14s">We're</a>  at the Roberts, we're at the Columbus, the Brooks, and I'm forgetting one. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3135.347s">And</a>  all of those schools will be putting on a fair at the end of the year as well to showcase the projects that they have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3143.549s">The</a>  fair usually takes place in May, and so we like to send out a notification when that happens to invite you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3150.55s">And</a>  I think some of you came last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3152.73s">I</a>  remember, Mr. Skerry, you were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3155.211s">I</a>  really want to thank you for coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3156.851s">I</a>  think you saw how passionate the students were and what great work they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3162.693s">Besides</a>  that, I just want to let you know tonight we're going to have really short presentations about some of the projects that are happening now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3168.978s">Some</a>  of these projects have already won acclaimed national news. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3175.623s">Some</a>  have been on Channel 5, which you'll hear from Stella in just a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3179.746s">And</a>  without further ado, before I announce Stella to give the first presentation from the students, does anybody have any questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3187.412s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3188.153s">Mr.</a>  Skerry.</p>

    <p>[Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3189.394s">So</a>  we're here to Mr. Skorka. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3191.558s">I'm</a>  really glad to see that your Orchards into the Feltz will hopefully come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3197.904s">As</a>  a kid growing up in Medford, where the high school is now, that was once the city infirmary where indigent citizens in their later years ended up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3207.392s">And</a>  before they built the high school, there were pear trees, cherry trees, peach trees, four or five different kinds of apple trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3215.479s">And</a>  it would be really great if we could bring this back to that location.</p>

    <p>[Skorka]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3219.247s">We</a>  started cleanup just two weeks ago, just to start getting the area cleaned up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3224.909s">We're</a>  working with Miss Breda Smith at the high school, and so our goal by the end of the school year is to have that orchard ready to go.</p>

    <p>[Skorka]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3243.054s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3244.635s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3246.578s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3247.619s">So</a>  I see one of the projects is called benches for dagger and I don't know if you are we have realized this but our. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3253.881s">My,</a>  this is scary. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3256.623s">He</a>  builds beautiful benches and tables. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3266.429s">So,</a>  you know, you may want to invite him up when there's building involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3271.513s">And</a>  I know he recently retired from his job as state auditor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3275.455s">So</a>  he does have the time to come and volunteer and help.</p>

    <p>[Skorka]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3279.778s">The</a>  students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3281.68s">Well,</a>  I never say no to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3283.241s">Anyone</a>  will tell you that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3284.282s">So</a>  you're hired.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3287.804s">Not</a>  that I volunteered them, but you know me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3291.007s">I'll</a>  throw anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3293.289s">But</a>  also, yes, I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3296.351s">So</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3297.132s">I</a>  was going to say throw you under the bus, but this week I don't want to say that.</p>

    <p>[Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3300.554s">I've</a>  been there before. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3301.515s">It's</a>  nothing new.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3302.977s">Also,</a>  what I'd like to say is I would like to see some more PR about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3308.502s">And</a>  I know that the transcript is always at our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3312.246s">And</a>  I'm wondering if we could highlight one of these groups on a weekly thing with the transcript and see where they are now in the planning stages. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3321.034s">And</a>  then every once in a while, pop a different group every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3324.877s">Or</a>  some way, since they're here and you're here, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3329.728s">I'm</a>  hoping that we can push for that to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3332.23s">Thank</a>  you for the moment.</p>

    <p>[Skorka]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3333.551s">Well,</a>  I'd like for all of you to join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3336.092s">We</a>  have a Facebook page that every, it's funny, we just, it's funny to say that we just finished publishing this book. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3342.977s">And</a>  so from this point forward on our Facebook page and our Instagram page, and you can feel free to follow us on both. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3349.682s">We</a>  are posting each project one at once every three days so that the public is aware of the projects that are happening right now.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3357.595s">So</a>  that is great, but a lot of our citizens, especially linking the seniors, as Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3363.961s">Cugno</a>  suggested earlier, we need it in print.</p>

    <p>[Skorka]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3367.745s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3368.306s">And</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3368.586s">Cugno,</a>  if I could mention, one of our projects that's happening right now is called Tech Time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3373.951s">And</a>  there are three students that go to the senior center, and they teach the senior citizens <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3380.133s">how</a>  to use technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3381.674s">So</a>  for example, how to set up a Facebook, what is Instagram, how to send an email, how to upload a photo, and how to take a selfie was a big one for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3393.505s">And</a>  so they started in September of last year, and so the senior citizens have to sign up for an activity they want to do that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3401.552s">And</a>  so only two signed up on the first day. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3403.713s">And</a>  those two went back and told everyone else how awesome the session was. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3407.874s">And</a>  so they went from two, and the next month they had 20 there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3412.155s">And</a>  so they go once a month, and they're still doing it right now.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3415.256s">I</a>  did hear about that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3416.396s">Actually,</a>  I had a lady who approached me on that, and she was extremely thrilled. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3421.398s">I'm</a>  not going to say we, you guys were doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3425.422s">And</a>  they were very happy because they actually had the interaction with the young kids and they got to learn something. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3432.37s">I</a>  guess what I was looking to is that not everyone goes to those classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3436.254s">So</a>  I know that they get together on a Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3439.798s">at</a>  lunchtime, especially around the holiday times, and around the year they have certain lunches that they do, and I know it's hard, because our kids are in school, but if there's ever that opportunity to go there, just introduce themselves, tell them what you're there for, and maybe solicit more people for the programs that you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3458.945s">Something</a>  like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3460.165s">That</a>  was what I was looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3461.526s">But</a>  I did hear about that, and it's a fabulous program.</p>

    <p>[Skorka]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3465.207s">Thank</a>  you so much, it's a really great idea.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3468.1s">That's</a>  it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3468.7s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3469.34s">Are</a>  we going to introduce the students?</p>

    <p>[Skorka]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3471.701s">Yes,</a>  I would like to call up Stella Eliopoulos. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3474.122s">She's</a>  going to talk about her project from the CCSR. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3476.462s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[rpuG18WtRwY_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3479.123s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3480.043s">My</a>  name is Stella. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3481.704s">Some</a>  of you know me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3482.964s">I'm</a>  a senior. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3484.285s">I've</a>  been a part of CCSR since I've been a senior. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3490.372s">One</a>  of my regrets of high school is not knowing about it earlier, not joining it earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3494.795s">I</a>  wasn't fortunate enough to have Mr. Skorka as a teacher, so I didn't hear about it until spring of last year from one of his students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3506.064s">Immediately,</a>  though, I went and I talked to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3508.165s">I</a>  was like, I'm interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3509.166s">I</a>  want to join. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3510.607s">And</a>  so he kind of got me in for this fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3515.732s">And</a>  it's been a really great way for students that wanna be active and don't necessarily have the means to be active and do these projects that they wanna do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3527.86s">This</a>  is a way for them to kind of, it's a vessel for them to initiate those projects and make a change that they've been hoping to see or that they wanna move forward with. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3539.267s">And</a>  for me, the project that I did, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3542.842s">It</a>  was actually out of state. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3544.803s">It</a>  was in Houston, Texas. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3547.843s">I</a>  don't know how much you all know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3551.064s">So</a>  over the summer I was at this program in New York through the New York Times and I met this girl from Houston. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3559.887s">We</a>  stayed connected when we got back and right around the time the hurricane hit was when her school started and Hurricane Harvey. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3567.794s">And</a>  so she said a little bit here and there about how it was affecting her and of course we heard it on the media, saw pictures and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3578.504s">It</a>  was different for me this time hearing this personal first-hand account from someone that I knew how she was experiencing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3588.17s">A</a>  lot of school was canceled for her. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3590.091s">A</a>  lot of her friends' houses got damaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3593.212s">And</a>  so I kind of felt that tug of compassion that I hadn't before with something like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3599.416s">And</a>  I wanted to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3601.097s">And</a>  now that I was part of CCSR, I had been searching for an idea for my project at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3607.261s">I</a>  thought that connecting the two would be able to <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3613.162s">do</a>  what I wanted to do with this help for Houston. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3616.044s">And</a>  so I, with the help of Mrs. Skorka and Mr. Trotta and CZSR, I planned a donation drive back in September, I think late September. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3627.753s">And</a>  school-wide, so I had students, I encouraged students to bring in donations like toiletries, non-perishable items, clothes, different things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3638.06s">And</a>  at first I was a little worried about students not really being active about the fundraising, because I know that that's been kind of a problem in the past, whether fundraisers aren't very widely known around the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3651.385s">But</a>  I was very pleasantly surprised at the amount of goods that we got. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3654.226s">And</a>  it was actually so many goods that we didn't have the funds to ship them all down, because it was too expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3663.61s">So</a>  here I got kind of stuck for a little while and I was trying to figure out how to get them down there and we reached out to different organizations to see if we could get any help and the Red Cross, you know once the Red Cross was like, we can't really help you out in shipping them down there, I was like, oh, I got kind of worried. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3682.489s">I</a>  thought we were pretty stuck and that we'd have to end up <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3685.982s">Donating</a>  the goods locally, but I didn't want to I mean I know that while they were if they have were to have gone somewhere locally they would have been appreciated, but I Was intent on seeing my project through I wanted to get them to Houston so my dad and I ended up renting out a U-Haul and We packed up the 10-foot U-Haul and it was so full that we couldn't we could barely close the door And we drove it all the way down to Houston ourselves it took a <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3712.963s">two</a>  days, and on the third day when we got there, we unloaded the goods at a church that we were able to get in contact with, with a person that my dad knew in Houston. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3726.27s">And</a>  it was very successful, and now we're sort of still in the fundraising process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3732.733s">And</a>  none of it would have been possible without CCSR backing me up, and without their help, and Mr. Trott and Mr. Skorka helping me out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3739.932s">And</a>  your father. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3740.893s">And</a>  my, yes, and my dad. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3743.316s">Very</a>  certainly.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3743.917s">How</a>  many did you steal? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3747.645s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3748.525s">That's</a>  fabulous. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3749.266s">That's</a>  absolutely fabulous. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3750.566s">And</a>  hearing stories, and everyone can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3753.467s">You</a>  don't have to, you know, you made yourself special by doing that, and you also represented the students in your school doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3761.229s">Talk</a>  about a great way of opening up your heart and, you know, and opening up your mind that, for the sake of, you know, for anybody, it could have been us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3769.872s">It</a>  could be us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3770.472s">So</a>  if you treat someone like that, it's always going to be successful for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3774.643s">And</a>  lucky enough, you have parents, you have your father who decided that he was going to take this quality drive with his daughter for three days, and then another three days. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3784.848s">So</a>  that's just wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3785.909s">So</a>  anybody else on our committee would like to say anything?</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3788.53s">Kathy?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3789.171s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3789.431s">I</a>  just want to say thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3790.952s">And</a>  I saw the story shared on Facebook, and I couldn't believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3794.213s">And</a>  now you're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3795.934s">It's</a>  so wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3797.855s">Thank</a>  you so much for doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3800.076s">It's</a>  incredible.</p>

    <p>[rpuG18WtRwY_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3801.157s">I</a>  really wasn't expecting it to become as big as it was, but it's all pretty exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3806.62s">It</a>  was my pleasure. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3807.381s">I</a>  had a lot of fun doing it and a lot of fun helping.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3810.463s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3811.263s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3812.164s">Of</a>  course.</p>

    <p>[Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3812.444s">Madam</a>  Secretary? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3813.344s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3813.925s">I</a>  want to move information through you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3816.246s">Where</a>  can residents, if they so wish, send contributions to?</p>

    <p>[rpuG18WtRwY_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3820.989s">So</a>  I have a little blog. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3823.791s">that</a>  I made kind of talking about the trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3826.534s">And</a>  we decided not to go with an online donation system. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3829.758s">So</a>  if people wanted to donate, they should do so through checks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3835.023s">And</a>  one of the posts that I made on the blog is about how to donate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3839.468s">And</a>  so you write out the check. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3843.544s">you</a>  indicate that it's going to Medford CCSR for the Houston relief, and then you send it to the high school with the attention to Mr. Trotta. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3851.809s">So</a>  we can assure that it gets there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3854.231s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3855.832s">Thank</a>  you, Stella.</p>

    <p>[rpuG18WtRwY_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3875.401s">Hi,</a>  I'm Louise Barboza.</p>

    <p>[nMlCJNUIswQ_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3876.961s">And</a>  I'm Rubia Fernandez.</p>

    <p>[rpuG18WtRwY_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3878.962s">Between</a>  both of us, we work together on two different projects.</p>

    <p>[nMlCJNUIswQ_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3882.943s">Yes,</a>  the ELL program alongside Jenna Agnew, and Medford's Diversity Day alongside our another partner, Sarah Pondockley.</p>

    <p>[rpuG18WtRwY_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3892.244s">With</a>  Medford's Diversity Day, we work with the mayor's office and as well with <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3900.53s">the</a>  Human Rights Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3902.891s">What</a>  we plan to do with Medford's Diversity Day is to really showcase the diversity of Medford because we feel like it is not shown as often and not just with race, we want to show the inclusion as well with disabilities and sexualities as well.</p>

    <p>[nMlCJNUIswQ_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3921.148s">And</a>  with our ELL Give Back program, it has been recognized recently, nationally, by the KIND grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3928.631s">So</a>  we were, out of nearly 200 contesters, we were the top 10, and we're currently finalists for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3935.933s">And</a>  with it, we work together to bridge the gap between new students coming from different countries and the difficulties that they may have doing <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3946.237s">regular</a>  tasks and just getting used to the art culture and the new environment.</p>

    <p>[rpuG18WtRwY_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3953.682s">Yeah,</a>  so with both of our projects, it really goes with the mission statement of what CCSR is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3960.247s">So</a>  CCSR is really to make global citizens and do it one student at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3966.231s">And</a>  both of our projects are really near and dear to us because <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3972.463s">We</a>  obviously come from backgrounds, we were both in the ELL program, and I mean, we obviously want diversity to be shown throughout Medford and have everyone access to learn more about cultures.</p>

    <p>[Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3992.698s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3993.239s">Nice</a>  job. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3993.739s">When</a>  you say that you actually, when students come to the school, do you actually approach them and try to introduce them to other students?</p>

    <p>[nMlCJNUIswQ_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4002.686s">Yes,</a>  so what it was is that we created a website and it acts as an online database with videos. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4009.751s">And</a>  these videos are made in different languages by students themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4014.335s">We</a>  try and focus on getting students that have been in the OLB program because it's a way to get back to a program that helped them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4021.44s">And</a>  the videos focus on tasks that we know from experience are very different in other countries, such as opening a locker, getting a bus pass, how to get your money order, or submitting any community service form. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4035.031s">And</a>  currently, we're working on expanding that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4037.553s">So</a>  we're editing a lot more videos and including more languages throughout the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4043.158s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4043.518s">That's</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4045.38s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4046.71s">And</a>  are you going to pass the baton over to anybody else?</p>

    <p>[nMlCJNUIswQ_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4049.939s">Yes,</a>  and up next is Kim Long.</p>

    <p>[rpuG18WtRwY_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4059.385s">Hi,</a>  I'm Kim Malone, and I'm a senior at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4062.726s">I've</a>  been part of CCSR for two years and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4065.507s">I</a>  originally started helping out some friends of mine who were already part of CCSR doing a mural that they were doing for the club itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4073.21s">And</a>  from the little snippets I heard about the club, I was very interested because it obviously showed a lot of potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4079.752s">And</a>  also, the people that were already part of it were already making moves. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4084.734s">making</a>  progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4086.215s">Two</a>  friends of mine also created a newspaper, so I was like, I want to do something for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4091.558s">So</a>  I joined my senior year, and we had to create a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4095.56s">And</a>  what was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4096.481s">For</a>  me and my friends, it was a major, like, there are a lot of issues we're passionate about, but one particular one was essentially that, what is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4107.407s">Medford</a>  itself doesn't really have a lot of black role models in regards to, what is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4112.427s">like</a>  teaching staff in schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4114.008s">And</a>  we wanted to create a way to bring black role models to the young students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4120.35s">And</a>  we specifically focused on females. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4124.091s">So</a>  our project was Black Female Empowerment Workshops. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4128.713s">And</a>  our last, well, our first one, our first workshop was last week on Wednesday the 13th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4135.355s">And</a>  essentially, we brought in speakers, pharmacists, and two biomedical engineers who would <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4141.793s">discuss</a>  their lives, the struggles they faced getting to where they are, and also to give advice to the students that were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4148.717s">And</a>  we had a very nice turnout of 20, 30 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4151.938s">And</a>  so far, we've gotten much positive feedback from both the students and faculty that attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4158.462s">And</a>  it would never have been possible without CCSR, because they pushed, the club itself pushes and encourages people, like the students involved, to find <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4169.482s">issues</a>  that they're passionate about and be able to engage it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4172.324s">And</a>  I know definitely that this workshop would not exist if I wasn't, if this club didn't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4178.248s">And</a>  we have four more workshops planned for the rest of the school year on half days in January, February, March, and May.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4186.653s">The</a>  workshops that you had, were they videotaped?</p>

    <p>[rpuG18WtRwY_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4189.094s">Yes,</a>  by Mr. Eliopoulos over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4192.637s">Of</a>  course.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4195.318s">But</a>  are they playing? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4196.839s">Are</a>  they playing on our studio stations? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4200.404s">Because</a>  that might be something that I think would be very beneficial for all of you, but also to have people see what you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4206.586s">You</a>  know, the creative workshops, something like your workshop is definitely something that could be videotaped. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4213.028s">Even</a>  what the girls have been doing, I think, is something that would be beneficial if you can't do the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4217.509s">But</a>  even a piece of it, just to really show off what you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4222.551s">you</a>  know, going to Texas and seeing the faces and what your abilities have done to other people and just to show their faces and their gratitude and how they react. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4233.099s">You</a>  know, and the same thing with the girls, you know, having students come in from different countries and knowing that there's this type of, you know, a lending hand, per se, that you're not going to be lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4244.908s">We're</a>  going to be there to help you out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4246.189s">I</a>  think it's very beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4247.691s">So</a>  if we could play that on our station, that would be great.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4251.464s">Yeah,</a>  so I think tonight we've seen, you know, heard about three different projects, which are very different, and I thank you so much for coming forward and telling us about your project, and girls also, about your projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4265.395s">When</a>  you look at the project portfolio that the school committee members received, the scope of the projects is really just amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4271.96s">And</a>  it makes me, again, feel so very proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4275.167s">Because</a>  here we have kids coming up with projects, all sorts of different projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4278.948s">What</a>  a wonderful idea to have role models come in and speak to our students and for you to be interested in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4285.75s">And</a>  then, you know, I read another one, one of our students, and I suspect we'll hear from her gladly so, is concerned about the styrofoam that we use for trays. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4295.093s">And</a>  I could go through each one because there are so many positive, wonderful projects that kids came up with. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4302.195s">And</a>  not just came up with, but then went forward and said, we're going to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4305.878s">We're</a>  going to make a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4306.939s">And</a>  I think that you've already made a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4309.241s">And</a>  I'm so proud that you're making a difference in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4311.742s">So</a>  thank you very, very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4312.963s">And</a>  I'm just grateful that the CCSR has flourished and taken off, especially. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4319.769s">And</a>  I know that the leadership has been extraordinarily positive and helpful in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4324.492s">And</a>  so I thank them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4325.853s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4326.193s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4328.095s">Just</a>  for clarification, Mr. Spocker, you had said that <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4331.901s">You're</a>  working with the Columbus, the Brooks, what were the other schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4335.103s">Roberts.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4336.523s">McGlynn.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4337.023s">And</a>  McGlynn.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4337.984s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4338.064s">So</a>  everybody's included. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4339.644s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4341.825s">Is</a>  there anyone else? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4343.386s">Madam</a>  Chair, if I could just make a quick comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4346.567s">I've</a>  gotten to meet several of the groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4350.549s">And</a>  the passion that you've all shown when you're talking about what you've selected to bring to the rest of the school year has been amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4359.032s">And</a>  also the cross. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4361.128s">grades.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4361.949s">So</a>  it's not just all seniors working together. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4364.331s">I've</a>  seen seniors and freshmen and just a whole mix that's really been refreshing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4369.195s">So</a>  I want to thank you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4370.676s">I</a>  know your advisors are fabulous. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4373.018s">Mr.</a>  Skorka, Mr. Torati, you're great people and you're really invested in our students and it shows because you're so polished and so mature. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4381.785s">So</a>  I'm just really, really proud of all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4383.846s">So</a>  thank you for sharing your stories with us.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4386.913s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4387.514s">And</a>  thank you, Justin.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4388.815s">Yeah,</a>  I would also like to add that CCSR is an organization that truly makes Medford unique among other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4401.979s">We</a>  know that Medford students like to give back. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4405.561s">They</a>  want to give back. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4406.882s">And</a>  that Medford is in good hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4409.064s">It's</a>  one of the organizations that's central to so much in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4412.986s">And</a>  we see it in about everything that we do regarding schools and even outside of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4419.37s">I</a>  mean, I remember there was one meeting I was at. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4424.073s">there</a>  was just a whole list of initiatives starting in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4427.835s">And</a>  almost everyone has attended back in the CCSR. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4430.816s">And</a>  I would just love to thank Mr. Trotta, Mr. Skorka, all the students, all the student leaders for doing so much for our community.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4447.082s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4447.702s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4449.558s">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4450.058s">Do</a>  we have a motion to approve? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4451.459s">I</a>  think we're all set, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4452.299s">So</a>  can I entertain a motion to accept this? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4454.92s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4455.56s">Motion</a>  by Mr. Benedetto, second by Mr. Skerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4459.101s">All</a>  in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4459.721s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4460.602s">Any</a>  opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4461.482s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4463.983s">7</a>  in the affirmative. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4465.063s">The</a>  report of the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility has been placed on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4469.665s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4470.285s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4471.065s">And</a>  I just want to throw something out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4473.506s">I</a>  know that everybody said thank you to a lot of people, but this is when we talk about networking. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4479.692s">And</a>  it was the superintendent, because it was with his networking and going out there and talking to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4485.535s">And</a>  when he hears about an idea that he knows that it's going to benefit us, whether we agree or disagree at times, the superintendent does bring back so much to our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4496.42s">And</a>  this, this particular program is something that the superintendent definitely worked on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4501.944s">And</a>  it was with his networking and finding the people that did it and showing them there's a reason to come to Medford and there's a reason of why they should accept us for their grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4514.893s">So</a>  I just wanted to recognize him for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4517.515s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4518.895s">And</a>  now for the report statement of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4522.276s">Report</a>  on statement of interest application to NSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4525.717s">Mr.</a>  Christopher Antonio.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4527.638s">So</a>  we heard from the Massachusetts School Building Authority and the statement of interest that we put in place last year, last April, is not going forward in this round. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4541.061s">Now,</a>  I had a good long chat with <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4545.021s">executives</a>  in the MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4547.964s">And</a>  without going through the whole report, a year ago, 26 projects were approved based on available funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4554.932s">This</a>  year, only 15 could be approved based on available funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4559.052s">But</a>  we were strongly encouraged to go forward, to resubmit, to push the button, get it back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4565.196s">And</a>  I have a feeling that a year from now, we'll be in the hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4571.321s">Obviously,</a>  there's work to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4573.783s">We</a>  update a few more things that are in the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4575.884s">But</a>  I think it's going to go forward, and I think it's just a year delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4580.067s">Just</a>  one of those things happens, and sometimes <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4584.64s">The</a>  money coming from the pool is greater or smaller. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4588.644s">It</a>  just happened to be one of those years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4591.048s">So</a>  from 26 to 15 projects, it is what it is.</p>

    <p>[Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4594.631s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4594.831s">Mostow?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4595.792s">It</a>  says 83 people have school systems of five and 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4600.255s">Do</a>  we know who are the 15 of that?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4602.337s">It</a>  hasn't been released yet, but when it's released, we'll know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4606.64s">I</a>  was told by the senior staff and their key people that the fact they came out and visited us on a full blown visit with architects and engineers, that we were very close.</p>

    <p>[Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4618.4s">And</a>  then they have a few dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4620.842s">One</a>  date for the accelerated repair is February 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4624.125s">Are</a>  you going for that one?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4625.246s">We're</a>  going for the core program. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4627.127s">The</a>  core program is April. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4629.369s">The</a>  accelerated repair, we already got money from boilers for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4632.952s">It's</a>  really a much smaller and more targeted program. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4635.814s">This</a>  is much more expansive. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4638.373s">has</a>  longer term value to us.</p>

    <p>[Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4640.034s">And</a>  is there anything you have to do for this application by April that's different than what you're supposed to do?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4644.117s">We've</a>  got to come back to you for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4645.658s">We're</a>  just going to look over the application to see if there's any changes we want to make, if there's anything we want to emphasize or modify a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4653.644s">And</a>  then we go back to the council and ask them to certify as well.</p>

    <p>[Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4657.787s">So</a>  is it that the other people are more in need than you think the 15 got it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4661.65s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4662.411s">I</a>  think that they obviously prioritize by need, but they also prioritize by money. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4668.448s">So</a>  if you have a project like ours, which could be a very expensive project, they had to be able to fit it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4675.779s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4675.88s">All</a>  right, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4676.901s">Okay?</a> </p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4677.182s">Okay,</a>  and. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4681.595s">I</a>  just want to actually, can I ask the mayor a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4685.377s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4685.677s">And</a>  that is, so you're going to go back to this in April for re-approval or is it going to be static? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4693.762s">No,</a>  it's going to go back into the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4695.583s">A</a>  new application. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4696.403s">So</a>  a new application means we have to pay the fee again for... No, there's no fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4700.165s">No</a>  fee, just the approval only, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4701.946s">Okay,</a>  so I just want to make sure that that's... <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4704.027s">the</a>  way that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4704.728s">But</a>  in the meantime, I know that as a committee, we've spoken about certain things that we want it done, and we were kind of hoping it was going to be incorporated into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4714.575s">With</a>  this not being accepted now, and we don't know when it will be accepted if we go for it in April. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4722.33s">What</a>  happens to the projects that we were thinking of doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4725.595s">Are</a>  they just going to get postponed until we find out if we're going to get approved? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4728.839s">Or</a>  are we going to look at it as a committee and start really looking at it and say, we really need to do certain things?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4735.041s">There</a>  are projects we'll go forward with, and there are projects that we should try to match up with MSBA because they're very expensive projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4743.183s">But</a>  there's plenty of projects we could go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4744.904s">We'll</a>  be going to the Council on Technology in January and a couple of other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4749.405s">So</a>  we're going to keep moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4751.006s">It's</a>  just a question of trying to get somebody else's money to purchase our own resources.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4757.379s">So</a>  with the motion from Mr. Skerry, do I have a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4760.442s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4761.423s">Second</a>  by Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4763.344s">All</a>  in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4764.265s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4765.126s">Any</a>  opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4767.808s">Six</a>  affirmative, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4770.791s">The</a>  motion to place the report on file is passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4774.814s">Report</a>  on security cameras.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4776.936s">Okay,</a>  so this is a report you've asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4780.98s">The</a>  committee has a much more detailed report. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4784.043s">I</a>  don't <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4785.237s">as</a>  a rule, issue anything on security that could lead to someone perhaps interfering with our operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4794.703s">So</a>  the cover report speaks for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4796.604s">The</a>  committee, if you want to ask me specific questions at some point, please do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4801.287s">But</a>  for the general public, let's just simply say that we've spent approximately $200,000 on security camera upgrades and replacements at our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4810.543s">security</a>  cameras, especially external ones, are very fragile devices. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4814.627s">Over</a>  the years they have been susceptible to adverse weather conditions, unpredictable power outages. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4819.772s">The</a>  newer models are a little bit more resilient. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4822.777s">but</a>  are not invincible, and they're not invulnerable. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4825.678s">Placement</a>  of external cameras on metal poles outside of the buildings tend to make them susceptible to lightning strikes, so we want to minimize that as much as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4836.063s">There</a>  are a few cameras we have no choice but to put them on metal poles because of the angle, but we try to minimize that and reduce that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4843.907s">We've</a>  contracted with American Alarm to upgrade and replace various cameras district-wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4848.853s">There's</a>  154 cameras across the district in our nine schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4853.638s">And</a>  believe at this time that we have sufficient coverage to <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4857.995s">ensure</a>  security. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4859.476s">Obviously</a>  there's some cameras watching different things that aren't as essential as the main cameras that are watching entrances, exits, and main pathways in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4868.043s">And</a>  you know, some of those are still a little bit more work to do, but you can see from the backup report that most of it's being done and will be done very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4877.01s">The</a>  maintenance of full security coverage will require that we annually budget significant funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4882.434s">It's</a>  not something that we can just look at every once every five years or four years <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4887.381s">It</a>  may be prudent to set aside funding and a special account to ensure that it'll be used each year for upgrades and replacements, as well as other security equipment that's related to that, like the Raptor equipment and things like that, because those things wear out after a period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4903.906s">If</a>  it's not used in any given year, we can roll it over and use it in the year that we absolutely need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4910.408s">Security</a>  cameras, I need to emphasize, are only one element of our overall school security and safety response system. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4916.45s">We</a>  continue to interact with public safety agencies and to practice special situation drills at all of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4925.093s">You</a>  have specifics, I would ask that the committee wants to talk to me about it and do it personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4930.874s">I'd</a>  rather not be talking about anything specific about security that might lead someone to gain the system help.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4940.27s">Mr.</a>  Skerry.</p>

    <p>[Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4941.07s">Just</a>  a general question through to Roy. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4944.032s">Roy,</a>  since the new schools have been built, has anyone done an audit of the cameras and the way they record the daily happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4953.176s">I</a>  know in some instances, the cameras are there, but you don't get a full view of what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4961.712s">I</a>  think that has to be addressed.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4963.094s">Cameras</a>  are two types. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4963.834s">Cameras</a>  that move and pan an area. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4966.097s">Cameras</a>  that are fixed on an area. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4968.059s">The</a>  cameras that move are very expensive, but they're also more susceptible to needing more repair and upgrades. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4976.548s">We</a>  have upgraded our cameras many times since they were first installed, since 2001 and 2003. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4983.758s">The</a>  system's changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4984.739s">They</a>  no longer run DVRs. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4986.14s">They're</a>  now more digital. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4987.781s">Other</a>  things are different than when they originally were installed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4992.144s">Cabling</a>  has to be different. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4993.445s">They</a>  have to be locked into 911 right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4996.147s">So</a>  all these things require upgrades. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4998.369s">And</a>  they'll continue to require upgrades as we go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5000.751s">So</a>  we've got good coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5003.913s">Some</a>  cameras cover the same area, but they cover it from a little different angle. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5010.878s">As</a>  we talk and we set up our meeting, perhaps we can go into an executive session allowable for security purposes, I'll give you more detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5019.307s">But</a>  I think at this particular point, we're in good shape and I think we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5024.653s">I</a>  appreciate the fact that the mayor has authorized us to spend. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5028.657s">for</a>  the security cameras because this is a big expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5031.738s">I</a>  also want to thank Christine because Christine did an awful lot of work putting it together with Alan Arena in my office to ensure that we did all the work that needed to be done.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5042.119s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5043.1s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5045.08s">Through</a>  you to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5046.94s">So</a>  thank you so much for addressing concerns on the security cameras and making sure that all upgrades will be done by mid-January in every single <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5057.883s">I</a>  appreciate that as a committee member. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5062.724s">I</a>  just want to talk a little bit about locking of the doors, especially at our high school building. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5068.106s">I</a>  know we made some changes and rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5070.206s">Could</a>  you just go over what that is or provide us with an update on that?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5074.368s">Let</a>  me provide you with an update rather than try to talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5076.948s">It's</a>  a big discussion about doors because even though we lock doors, we have buzzer systems and the like, somebody from the inside could let somebody in. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5087.65s">make</a>  sure that people know that that's not allowed.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5090.611s">And</a>  could you look at how the weekends are handled at different buildings and like with people using our facilities and how they're locked after. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5098.835s">So</a>  I'm requesting, I'm actually requesting motion, I'm making a motion, sorry, brain freeze, um, to have that report presented to us by mid January. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5110.141s">Um,</a> </p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5111.292s">I'd</a>  like to set up, if I could, a special meeting for this purpose, because I don't want to talk about security in public.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5116.556s">I</a>  think that's great.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5117.557s">I</a>  just think if we start talking about security, if we start opening up what is and what isn't, it's not going to work.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5123.261s">I</a>  think that's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5124.482s">So</a>  I'll make that motion that we have a meeting, a committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5129.406s">Committee</a>  of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5130.367s">Committee</a>  of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5131.248s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5132.603s">on</a>  security and doors locked and to school for different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5137.226s">I</a>  think it's so imperative in this day and age. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5139.907s">And</a>  thank you for all the work that you've done to make sure that we're moving forward in this direction.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5145.719s">OK,</a>  so could I entertain the motion of having a meeting of the whole set up for middle of January?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5151.848s">When</a>  do we make it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5153.31s">As</a>  soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5154.091s">It</a>  could be the beginning of February. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5156.154s">We</a>  want to get the work done, and we want to get a lot of other things in place so we can be complete in our discussion.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5162.503s">Okay,</a>  so motion is to have a committee of the whole meeting for our security cameras to discuss our security cameras as soon as possible made by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Skerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5174.949s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5175.669s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5176.95s">Any</a>  opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5178.771s">Motion</a>  passes and we will have a meeting.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5181.492s">Motion</a>  to receive and place this report on file.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5183.573s">Yes,</a>  I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5187.684s">Recommendation</a>  to approve school lunch charge.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5190.285s">I</a>  mean sorry charge policy I'm going to call upon our director of finance and administration to talk to you about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5196.487s">It's</a>  a requirement of the federal government.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5200.448s">Just</a>  for clarification, change policy or charge policy?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5203.309s">Charge.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5204.289s">Charging</a>  of a meal through the school lunch account. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5209.671s">Breakfast</a>  or lunch, I should elaborate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5212.391s">So</a>  yes, we are <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5214.854s">going</a>  to be under our review from DESE, the Department of Education, in February of 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5221.418s">This</a>  is a reoccurring audit event that happens every three years now, and we will be up for review. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5230.582s">As</a>  we started to prepare our initial documentation, we realized that we do not have <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5237.771s">an</a>  up-to-date charge policy which every district is required to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5242.615s">So</a>  we wanted to bring forward a draft copy for review and approval in regards to when students are going through the line and do not have <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5257.543s">money</a>  for lunch or breakfast that day and or have not qualified or submitted a pre-reduced application. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5264.988s">So</a>  they would be of a paying status and or a reduced status that still requires money to come through the line for purchase. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5273.914s">Again,</a>  we have online capabilities so that parents and families can load the funds automatically on a routine basis, get reminders when the accounts are low, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5286.918s">So</a>  we have to ensure that we have our compliance and that the requirements are directed for implementing and enforcing throughout the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5298.045s">So</a>  the purpose of this is mostly informative to encourage and have the families understand that the meal programs are necessary to maintain a positive balance within each of their students' accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5314.808s">Charges</a>  throughout the district that range from five cents to fifty five dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5319.512s">So</a>  in order to be able to Pursue them in a in an accurate way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5323.995s">We</a>  need to have our own charge policy identified So the school lunch program again is required to be self-sufficient <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5332.495s">It</a>  cannot go in the deficit and it cannot pay for its own overcharges. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5337.18s">We</a>  need to have something in place documented. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5341.024s">So</a>  as a whole, as a district, we have a relatively low negative balance in relation to our size and enrollment for the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5349.292s">Which</a>  is very encouraging. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5351.495s">So</a>  we don't have a significant issue at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5355.28s">So</a>  we have a district wide negative balance of about $2500. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5358.804s">And</a>  that's as I mentioned, ranging from 5 cents to $55. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5364.991s">So</a>  again, some of these families will put <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5368.298s">funds</a>  on, but we need to have a mechanism to be able to remind them to be able to put prompts and have additional resources to reach out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5377.724s">So</a>  the recommendation that we are providing and the draft language incorporates the mandatory requirements that we need for this type of a charge policy that follow USDA guidelines as well as school nutrition guidelines here in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5395.352s">So</a>  our recommendation at the end of the draft policy is to limit the number of chargeable meals. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5403.679s">We've</a>  identified three meals for the middle and high school students and five meals for the elementary students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5412.186s">Now</a>  again, this does not mean that children are going through the line and cannot get a type of meal. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5417.517s">they</a>  would get an alternate meal, such as a cheese sandwich and other items. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5422.705s">What</a>  it does is it requires that we put prompts in place to notify families, again, via email response through the online Nutri-Kids system. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5433.02s">and</a>  or notes home and or reaching out through the guidance departments if there could be some situations at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5440.606s">So</a>  again, reminder to families that at any point during the school year, they can apply for free and reduced lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5448.031s">If</a>  they are getting services from other entities through the Commonwealth, they would be eligible for free lunch and or reduced capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5456.237s">So</a>  encouraging that level of participation if it's not <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5460.793s">directly</a>  free and reduced application that they are gaining services in other departments that we would then be able to reach those students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5469.736s">So</a>  the document in front of you is in draft form, and we would like to be able to have something in place when we have our review coming up in February.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5482.08s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5482.26s">Vander</a>  Kloof? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5483.221s">So</a>  just a clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5486.602s">On</a>  the front page, you say we'll cap the charges at three meals. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5491.105s">for</a>  middle and high school students and five for elementary. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5495.308s">But</a>  then if I understand it, they can still take a regular meal.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5499.711s">It's</a>  an alternative meal. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5501.212s">So</a>  if the meal of the day was chicken nuggets and something else, they would be an alternate meal option that would not be the same type of meal. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5514.102s">So</a>  such as a cheese sandwich and or another alternate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5519.374s">So</a>  we don't like to have the students come through and be in a situation where they've had a meal and now they have to return it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5527.703s">So</a>  this is where a charge policy comes into place. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5530.886s">We</a>  are able to prompt them, remind them up front, OK, you've charged two meals. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5535.37s">You've</a>  charged one meal. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5537.533s">You</a>  need to remind your parents or guardians that you need money in your lunch account.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5542.948s">I'm</a>  just trying to figure out, first of all, in terms of the alternate lunch, are cheese sandwiches an option for all the time for everybody?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5552.113s">They</a>  do have an option for an alternate during the line, yes.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5555.515s">Okay,</a>  because one of the things that we worked hard is not to signal students out.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5560.538s">No,</a>  and it's not, again, it's not a factor of free or reduced capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5566.782s">This</a>  is a reminder that their account needs either attention in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5573.377s">pre-funding</a>  and or a notification to families to fill out an application that we can get them in that capacity.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5582.163s">So</a>  three days in a row is pretty short time, is what I'm concerned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5589.348s">And</a>  I'm just thinking about for a family who's got a sort of short-term crisis, I mean... In regard to</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5598.794s">the</a>  high school and middle school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5600.455s">So</a>  we did look at other districts and some of these, their suggested language. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5605.139s">And</a>  there are many that do not allow any charges at the high school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5610.483s">So</a>  we tried to be a little bit more flexible and indicate, you know, and again, this isn't, this is sporadic. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5617.849s">It's</a>  if three days in a row, that's, that's usually, you know, students can be forgetful. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5622.633s">Parents,</a>  you know, might not have been able to, to get online. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5626.455s">Again,</a>  it's a mechanism to flag either the guidance department and or to reach out to the parents in a more formalized manner to be able to say, you know, we need to provide some assistance and unless it's just a habitual problem with a particular student.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5645.851s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5646.291s">Well,</a>  you know, obviously my concern is for the student who might have not yet signed up for <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5652.657s">reduced</a>  price lunch or something, but all of a sudden there's a crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5657.519s">And</a>  I just wouldn't want them to be in any way signaled out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5661.501s">This</a>  is consistent, you say, with other school districts? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5664.823s">And</a>  we have to have- We have to have a charge policy, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5667.604s">Well,</a>  I'll be curious, yeah, what other people think about it.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5672.346s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5673.507s">I</a>  have similar concerns to my colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5678.745s">This</a>  day and age, some families really struggle. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5681.306s">And</a>  paying for school breakfast or lunch is not easy for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5686.748s">Not</a>  all who don't qualify for free and reduced have the funds available either. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5695.132s">They</a>  just might make a little too much money, but not enough for the whole month. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5699.354s">And</a>  I just feel like children know that children didn't get the same lunch as them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5708.6s">If</a>  they're given the cheese sandwich, it is a signal. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5711.541s">I</a>  know we're providing food, and I appreciate that we do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5717.523s">It's</a>  just a concern for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5719.824s">I'd</a>  like to see the number increase at the bare minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5723.345s">I</a>  would like to see no number there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5726.106s">And</a>  just remind us of the parent, because I hate holding children accountable for things that are out of their control. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5733.669s">Sometimes</a>  it's not the child, it's the parent's situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5737.625s">that</a>  causes the lack of payment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5740.366s">And</a>  having a school lunch person say to you when you're in the line and your friend's next to you, I'm sorry, you've already charged two over. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5749.448s">And</a>  someone hears it, it's an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5753.55s">It's</a>  just an issue for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5755.13s">So</a>  I'm not really on board with it as it's written. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5759.111s">And</a>  again, I wanted to go back to the report I requested on December 4. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5765.778s">with</a>  how many free and reduced lunch applications we received by building, by school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5774.106s">Are</a>  we getting the word out to everybody initially in September? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5779.351s">I</a>  know it's a great undertaking, so I was just still hoping to get that report before we make changes to what we're already doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5788.303s">So</a>  I don't I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5790.104s">I'm</a>  still on the fence.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5791.385s">Just</a>  a point of clarification that that's a separate item. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5794.607s">This</a>  is mandatory for our review. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5796.968s">So</a>  without this document, that would be a write up issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5800.671s">So</a>  this is why we're bringing it forward for draft form and discussion in order to if that's the committee's direction to extend or provide <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5813.803s">greater</a>  threshold. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5814.763s">That's</a>  the prerogative of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5816.924s">Just</a>  be aware that that could mean additional funds that would have to be addressed and or moved from a different source because the school food service budget could not allocate that.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5828.068s">When</a>  does this draft have to be accepted by?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5831.349s">We</a>  are under review in February.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5836.35s">And</a>  so, as you just clarified, this is something that we have to do because we're being, it's by government?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5843.653s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5844.494s">But</a>  the amount isn't?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5845.994s">No,</a>  again, it's a recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5847.435s">This</a>  is a draft document for your review and discussion.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5850.656s">So,</a>  excuse me, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5852.737s">Mustone?</a> </p>

    <p>[Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5854.683s">The</a>  first page, the last paragraph under policy is students without meal money on a consistent basis will have outreach provided by the administration to investigate the situation more closely and take further action as needed to assist in providing an application for services. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5872.307s">So</a>  how, like I'm just thinking the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5875.489s">So</a>  a lunch woman, I'm sorry, I don't think there are any men, I'm not being sexist, sees that there's negative balance of 9.75 for the high school student. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5887.618s">That</a>  woman, that dining service will then call someone for help?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5892.282s">No,</a>  so none of this would transpire in the course of the lunch or breakfast line. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5898.006s">This</a>  would be outside of that, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5900.42s">in</a>  the reporting capacity, we would be able to run a negative balance report and identify based on any thresholds that we've established to then reach out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5910.895s">So</a>  right now, with nothing in place formally, there's not a mechanism for us to <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5917.661s">to</a>  reach out to those families.</p>

    <p>[Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5919.202s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5919.482s">But</a>  when you're saying outreach, are you saying, I'm going to send them, because I've gotten it, low balance from Nevin at the Roberts, or are you saying someone will actually call and say, is something going on?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5928.309s">We</a>  would call and reach out to the family in that capacity because that would be, they would likely not have an account that they have, they're receiving the negative balance accounts, and or if they have, we would say, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5942.506s">you've</a>  been notified we need to address this or if there's a different type of hardship, let us direct you in the right area for services to be provided elsewhere.</p>

    <p>[Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5953.353s">And</a>  will it be your office that will be doing the calling?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5955.755s">No,</a>  this is food service that they have access to the reports and they run them on a daily basis for their number of meals served, all of that activity that they could run on a daily basis.</p>

    <p>[BrSC8V8no0E_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5969.51s">May</a>  I? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5969.75s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5970.911s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5971.091s">Van</a>  der Kloot and then may I go?</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5973.032s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5973.373s">So</a>  I think that having some threshold where the account is followed up on, that's not a problem for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5983.619s">I</a>  definitely think that all of a sudden the kid goes through the line and they get a different meal is a problem for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5992.005s">I</a>  would rather them still be able to take their regular meal. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5996.188s">You</a>  know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6001.94s">I</a>  mean, because it still shows up, and there's still, the follow-up would still be necessary, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6008.487s">Yes,</a>  they would be in a negative capacity going through the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6012.091s">I</a>  mean, it says here, I mean, because there's a punishment instated in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6016.215s">The</a>  child will be allowed to take a meal. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6018.138s">And</a>  that meal will be continued to be charged to the account at the standard lunch rate based on their meal benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6023.986s">So</a>  if the meal is three and a quarter, even though they're getting a cheese sandwich rather than chicken nuggets, they're being charged the same three and a quarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6031.597s">To</a>  me, there is a punishment there, and I'm not comfortable with that.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6035.32s">So</a>  it is going in in the school nutrition guidelines to where there's nothing being occurring that is outside of that context. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6045.183s">So</a>  again, if it's the purview of the committee, there would be no item that was altered in that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6053.805s">That</a>  is what is provided as the USDA alternative and or to encourage participation and or <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6062.472s">looking</a>  for additional services and resources in order to possibly get free or reduced capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6070.518s">So</a>  that's the intent of, and that's the school nutrition program itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6075.661s">That's</a>  not a Medford item that we're arbitrarily doing.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6080.264s">So</a>  I understand that it's important for us to have some thresholds so that parents are contacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6086.408s">And</a>  I understand that the alternative lunch is <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6090.616s">meets</a>  the same criteria, but I'm not comfortable with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6093.499s">So</a>  I'm comfortable with saying, OK, flag the account. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6100.265s">We</a>  need to talk to the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6102.267s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6103.268s">That</a>  makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6104.188s">But</a>  I'm not comfortable with changing the lunch for the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6109.974s">That</a>  just doesn't sit well with me.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6112.843s">So</a>  I think it's important that you understand one fundamental point about all this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6118.366s">The</a>  federal government gives us money to subsidize lunches for free and reduced. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6123.929s">If</a>  people are getting lunches who are not <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6127.75s">eligible</a>  because they haven't done the work or haven't, you know, filled out their work or actually been declared eligible, the federal government looks at that as us taking their money to subsidize people who otherwise should be paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6142.061s">That's</a>  where the federal law comes into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6145.304s">They're</a>  concerned, and by the way, there are communities in the commonwealth that have run up balances of 50, 60, $70,000, in fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6153.736s">Was</a>  it Wellesley?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6154.616s">Framingham</a>  was one.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6155.397s">Framingham,</a>  Wellesley, places like that really got slammed because people were taking lunches on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6161.98s">So</a>  we have to have something, but it has to be reasonable so it can be defended with the feds when they come in and do the audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6171.364s">But</a>  the reason behind it is when they give us a free lunch and they pay for it, they're saying that we want to pay the kid that's eligible. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6179.368s">We</a>  don't want to pay for somebody who's just never paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6182.582s">That's</a>  the way they look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6183.983s">So</a>  we've got to find some way to get something on the books. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6186.925s">If</a>  not tonight, we certainly have to do it early in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6190.948s">And</a>  if you want us to come back with something a little less, let's say, severe as far as we're looking at it, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6197.854s">But</a>  we've got to do something that's got to be on the books.</p>

    <p>[Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6200.396s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6202.577s">Baker.</a> </p>
