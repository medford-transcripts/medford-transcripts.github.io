1
00:00:00,519 --> 00:00:03,720
to remember what has happened and consider what could happen.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,181
Juneteenth is more than a date on the calendar.

3
00:00:07,661 --> 00:00:12,522
It's a profound reminder of a promise delayed and a call to continue the work of justice.

4
00:00:13,362 --> 00:00:23,465
On June 19, 1865, enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas, were finally informed of their freedom, more than two years after the Emancipation Proclamation.

5
00:00:24,365 --> 00:00:35,328
That moment was not simply a matter of legal change, it was the culmination of generations of resistance, of voices raised, of people refusing to accept injustice as permanence.

6
00:00:36,529 --> 00:00:41,850
Today, here in Medford, we honor that spirit not just with a celebration, but with action.

7
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:50,993
The same moral courage that brought freedom to enslaved people in the 19th century is needed now in our schools, our neighborhoods, and our local government.

8
00:00:51,933 --> 00:00:57,578
Especially now, we need that courage to stand firm in the face of tyranny, fascism, and injustice.

9
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:06,806
Especially now, we need to protect all of our citizens, no matter what their immigration status, racial, cultural, religious, or economic background.

10
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:08,508
Especially now.

11
00:01:08,648 --> 00:01:08,888
Thank you.

12
00:01:08,908 --> 00:01:14,012
Yes.

13
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:18,837
Especially now, we need to be the kind of community that cared for all of her residents.

14
00:01:20,017 --> 00:01:27,822
Our city, like all communities, is still on a journey toward equity, and the power to shape that journey lies with us, the people.

15
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:43,072
Dorothy Height, one of my inspirations, a towering figure in the civil rights movement, once said, we must always be a strong presence, an unrelenting force working for equality and justice until freedom gates are fully opened.

16
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:59,801
That message speaks directly with us today, because Juneteenth is not only about what happened in 1865, it's about what happens at every school community meeting, every city council vote, every decision made about housing, health, or education in our cities, and we're a part of that.

17
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:04,245
The voice of the people still rings loudly, and it must.

18
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:11,028
In our city, we have the power to ensure our local government reflects the needs and values of our whole community.

19
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:27,657
So let Juneteenth not only be a day of remembrance, but a renewed commitment to be that strong presence, an unrelenting force, pushing forward until those freedom gates are not just open, but wide enough for everyone to walk through with dignity.

20
00:02:28,932 --> 00:02:31,234
Let us celebrate but also recommit.

21
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:33,817
Let us remember and also act.

22
00:02:34,617 --> 00:02:36,479
That is the true spirit of Juneteenth.

23
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:37,260
Thank you.
