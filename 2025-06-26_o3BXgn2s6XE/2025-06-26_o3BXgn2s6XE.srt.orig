00:00:00,171 --> 00:00:01,334
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get started.

2
00:00:01,374 --> 00:00:04,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening and welcome to tonight's meeting of the micro community development board.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,722
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll call the meeting to order.

4
00:00:05,843 --> 00:00:08,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's begin with some regulatory procedure matters.

5

[SPEAKER_08]: Danielle, can you introduce anyone on staff that's on the call?

28
00:01:38,597 --> 00:01:38,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

29
00:01:39,257 --> 00:01:50,307
[SPEAKER_06]: I have myself, senior planner, Alicia Hunt, the director of our office, and Clem Doucette, a graduate student intern.

30
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:54,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

31
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

32
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:06,344
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a continued public hearing to consider and vote on our recommendations to city council regarding the zoning overlay to comply with the MBTA community zoning law.

33
00:02:06,905 --> 00:02:10,229
[SPEAKER_08]: At the last meeting, the board members were supportive of the proposed overlay.

34
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:19,659
[SPEAKER_08]: However, there was discussion regarding the appropriate parking minimums and maximums, such as reducing parking minimums to 0.5 spaces per unit or requiring no parking minimums at all.

35
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:24,415
[SPEAKER_08]: We asked staff to model the unit capacity yields for the 0.5 spaces.

36
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:28,418
[SPEAKER_08]: So the city has reported back.

37
00:02:28,438 --> 00:02:34,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Danielle, if you want to highlight that, and if the board wants to start deliberations from there.

38
00:02:37,465 --> 00:02:42,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so we met with our consultant, Emily Innis, who

39
00:02:45,427 --> 00:02:47,329
[SPEAKER_06]: double checked our work and modeled this for us.

40
00:02:48,730 --> 00:03:05,282
[SPEAKER_06]: So the unit capacity in the original draft that was submitted to you was 4.8 spaces per unit at five stories and that unit capacity was

41
00:03:09,718 --> 00:03:14,984
[SPEAKER_06]: 6,472, if you recall the number that we need to hit is 6,433.

42
00:03:16,065 --> 00:03:28,518
[SPEAKER_06]: And with the reduced parking at 0.5 spaces per unit and dropping down a story down to four stories, the unit capacity goes up to 6,595.

43
00:03:32,656 --> 00:03:51,310
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason for dropping the story, as we discussed, was in hopes that this would prompt developers to utilize some of the incentive credits to forward some of our other goals.

44
00:03:56,223 --> 00:04:02,124
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the other items that we had discussed was what we wanted to put in for a maximum parking.

45
00:04:03,005 --> 00:04:08,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Currently it's one and a half that's in the draft before you, and there was discussion about dropping that down to 1.2.

46
00:04:08,506 --> 00:04:12,827
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if there were other numbers that were thrown out.

47
00:04:13,747 --> 00:04:19,869
[SPEAKER_06]: That can't be modeled, but it would keep the parking down.

48
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,370
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think those were the,

49
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:30,545
[SPEAKER_06]: the points that you all need to discuss and vote on tonight.

50
00:04:31,106 --> 00:04:32,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I missing anything?

51
00:04:32,186 --> 00:04:39,211
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll leave in my notes, which admittedly I don't have in front of me, but I did write.

52
00:04:40,312 --> 00:04:51,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I think those were the two things, was the parking minimums with the and how much that might

53
00:04:56,547 --> 00:05:10,536
[SPEAKER_05]: modify the number of units and then the parking maximums, which you didn't say last time, as well as tonight that we can't directly model, but I appreciate nonetheless.

54
00:05:18,981 --> 00:05:26,146
[SPEAKER_00]: I had also requested a realistic outlook of where the locations, the units could go.

55
00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:34,959
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I remember discussing like the MBTA zone, there's not going to be any real development there.

56
00:05:35,739 --> 00:05:38,682
[SPEAKER_00]: Station landing, there's not going to be any real development there.

57
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:48,149
[SPEAKER_00]: But where do you see the possibility of actually having these units being set up in a realistic output?

58
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:57,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Through the chair, I believe we have a map that was created showing the parcels that

59
00:05:58,996 --> 00:06:02,759
[SPEAKER_06]: would most likely have development on them.

60
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:08,104
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe that we put that on the website.

61
00:06:08,144 --> 00:06:17,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Clem, do you know that was, it was probably in the PowerPoint, because we had a meeting with city council, committee of the whole last Wednesday, I believe.

62
00:06:17,772 --> 00:06:22,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm pulling it up now, but the plan map is linked on the website.

63
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:30,978
[SPEAKER_10]: While Clem pulls that up, Clem can you share screen and show that map?

64
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:35,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I walked everybody through which were the parcels that we thought could be developed.

65
00:06:36,325 --> 00:06:37,006
[SPEAKER_10]: To be clear,

66
00:06:38,151 --> 00:06:58,750
[SPEAKER_10]: The goal is to create zoning that if all of these parcels were wiped clean of their buildings this is the number of units the 6,500 change could be built if all of these were then knocked down and clean and then and then residential was built there.

67
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:04,315
[SPEAKER_10]: There is actually no expectation that in any of these communities if you zone like this

68
00:07:04,855 --> 00:07:14,079
[SPEAKER_10]: that that's what would get built, um, but it allows the parcels that are developable, um, so that they could develop as of right.

69
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:21,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and so Clem had- those are the parcels, the Xs are the spaces that can't be developed.

70
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:26,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, this is not the presentation from, uh, Emily.

71
00:07:26,664 --> 00:07:27,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Were you planning to show that?

72
00:07:28,405 --> 00:07:32,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can show that one too, but this just shows the legally excluded land.

73
00:07:32,826 --> 00:07:33,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

74
00:07:38,686 --> 00:07:41,707
[SPEAKER_08]: I have the, is it the Downtown Trout Work Zoning Study?

75
00:07:41,907 --> 00:07:44,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that the slides that Daniel shared?

76
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,531
[SPEAKER_10]: So Clem has it up on the screen now.

77
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,792
[SPEAKER_10]: These are the slides that were presented to the city council last week.

78
00:08:01,094 --> 00:08:01,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep going.

79
00:08:01,954 --> 00:08:05,336
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the one that we're thinking about, that's the one that we're thinking about, this one.

80
00:08:06,772 --> 00:08:16,607
[SPEAKER_10]: So this shows which parcels we actually think some development would happen on and where it's reasonable to consider that this would occur.

81
00:08:18,185 --> 00:08:30,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Most of the other parcels are either fully built out with high-rise buildings, and in some cases, more stories than we would allow under this.

82
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:37,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Some are not that built out, but they're new enough that we don't think they would actually develop on.

83
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:44,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I doubt the top right corner would be developed as well.

84
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,895
[SPEAKER_00]: The one next to the station on the right of the station, the small parcel, I think that's developable.

85
00:08:52,756 --> 00:08:56,479
[SPEAKER_00]: The tattoo parlor thing, that's developable.

86
00:08:58,481 --> 00:09:02,205
[SPEAKER_00]: The Meadow Glen Mall or whatever mall it was, that's a maybe.

87
00:09:02,906 --> 00:09:08,451
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do not think there's even 500 units within this parcels.

88
00:09:09,187 --> 00:09:10,328
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's quite fine.

89
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:11,728
[SPEAKER_10]: That's totally allowable.

90
00:09:11,808 --> 00:09:22,634
[SPEAKER_10]: What we think of with the one on the top right is that there is so much surface parking up there that with this new zoning, they could choose to put residential buildings on the surface parking.

91
00:09:22,654 --> 00:09:36,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I think just a point of clarification, the intention of the zoning is not everything is going to get built.

92
00:09:36,262 --> 00:09:38,543
[SPEAKER_05]: It is that the possibility is there and that the

93
00:09:39,565 --> 00:09:47,949
[SPEAKER_05]: the regulatory kind of environment is cleared for if someone wanted to develop multifamily residential.

94
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:51,831
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not saying that, well, we need to build this many units.

95
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:55,612
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that the legal possibility needs to be there.

96
00:09:56,933 --> 00:09:57,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

97
00:09:57,733 --> 00:10:02,915
[SPEAKER_06]: It's dropping the regulatory rope that would preclude that development by right.

98
00:10:03,476 --> 00:10:06,997
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't have to produce any units

99
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,704
[SPEAKER_06]: The law does not care what is on that parcel now.

100
00:10:16,486 --> 00:10:17,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Emily, do you have a question?

101
00:10:19,848 --> 00:10:20,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

102
00:10:20,508 --> 00:10:26,191
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a similar question to what Peter just asked in terms of the intent of this discussion.

103
00:10:27,652 --> 00:10:36,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to confirm that we're not confirming developability, we're just talking about the zoning in particular.

104
00:10:37,777 --> 00:10:39,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Then an additional comment,

105
00:10:40,445 --> 00:10:49,989
[SPEAKER_07]: I live in the building in between the top right circle and Wellington, right along the river.

106
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:55,172
[SPEAKER_07]: That building, from my understanding, was the redevelopment of a surface parking lot.

107
00:10:56,192 --> 00:11:01,154
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really excited to see that this could potentially be done.

108
00:11:03,155 --> 00:11:08,157
[SPEAKER_07]: That being said, there are a lot of parking spots in my building that are used.

109
00:11:10,866 --> 00:11:24,776
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, just whatever we can do to kind of incentivize developers to build more units that respect kind of the transit oriented nature of this community, I think is great.

110
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,378
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm excited about this.

111
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I

112
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:41,324
[SPEAKER_08]: I echo Emily, 1 of the things that I stand firm with, and I understand that the city has, you know, you take away park and even with transit oriented development, then you'll still see a spillover.

113
00:11:41,424 --> 00:11:48,811
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, it's like the whole idea of it being compliant and dealing with the transit oriented is that we're trying to prioritize people.

114
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:50,191
[SPEAKER_08]: over cars.

115
00:11:50,331 --> 00:12:04,017
[SPEAKER_08]: So I am all for the more housing units that we can get on a property, whether they're built or not, but removing that barrier and offering that incentive for a developer to take up if they so choose.

116
00:12:04,637 --> 00:12:05,857
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's where my stance is.

117
00:12:05,998 --> 00:12:12,080
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know if there's any other questions that's leading up to us and what we need to do for recommendations.

118
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:17,302
[SPEAKER_08]: And as far as maximum parking, I would say we definitely want to

119
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:26,689
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm all for bringing it down under the 1.5 maximum if needed, but I don't know how the board feels about that.

120
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:29,791
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just picking up on what we were talking about at the previous meeting.

121
00:12:29,811 --> 00:12:42,718
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if anyone had any comments on the maximum parking or if there's any other comments on the parking overall.

122
00:12:45,027 --> 00:12:49,329
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I mean, I think I'd also be in favor of reducing the maximum parking.

123
00:12:49,389 --> 00:13:10,561
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a more, uh, that's a less kind of risky play than the parking minimums at this point, because I think Alicia, I don't remember if it was Alicia or somebody else that brought it up at the last meeting that, um,

124
00:13:11,956 --> 00:13:17,001
[SPEAKER_05]: But even given the transit-orientedness of this community, there are going to be people that have cars.

125
00:13:17,401 --> 00:13:30,553
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can't, like, I mean, Medford is trying, but it's not like a Cambridge or a Boston where you're going to be able to get everything you need without a car, necessarily, unless you're really trying.

126
00:13:31,474 --> 00:13:34,397
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we want to undercut.

127
00:13:35,224 --> 00:13:39,329
[SPEAKER_05]: the developability by having the parking minimums too low.

128
00:13:39,369 --> 00:13:50,842
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the parking maximum, bringing that down under the 1.5 is a good way to disincentivize parking without setting potential developers up for problems later on.

129
00:13:52,940 --> 00:14:05,670
[SPEAKER_08]: And also still definitely keeping in mind equity for people that actually really need to utilize those spaces, whether it's a disability or they're caring for someone or whatever the reason is, we're still allowing it there.

130
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:14,757
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not going into zero, but so we're making notice that, yeah, parking is needed, but again, minimal parking.

131
00:14:24,877 --> 00:14:32,219
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so, Danielle, I know that you wanted us to sort of give some feedback on developer incentives.

132
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:41,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Did anyone have any further discussion on how you thought the incentives played out in the amendment?

133
00:14:44,822 --> 00:14:49,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Or any additional thoughts from what was captured at the last meeting?

134
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:14,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Or if you wanted to add anything to Daniel's suggested or not suggested, but they're captured development incentive bonuses, or are you fine with how they are as is.

135
00:15:24,945 --> 00:15:27,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Is the board ready to vote on a recommendation for the.

136
00:15:30,572 --> 00:15:38,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it, it's the approval of the amendment for the zoning overlay to send to City Council or to recommend to City Council?

137
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:41,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Chair?

138
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:41,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

139
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:53,467
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to, for the record, let you know that we had sent mail out to a number of developers who had expressed interest in building in this area.

140
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,849
[SPEAKER_10]: And we, with Clem's assistance,

141
00:15:57,808 --> 00:16:02,912
[SPEAKER_10]: to either property owners or property managers for all of the parcels that are in the zone.

142
00:16:03,413 --> 00:16:05,074
[SPEAKER_10]: We sent them this draft zoning.

143
00:16:05,454 --> 00:16:08,737
[SPEAKER_10]: We told them about this meeting, about the City Council's meeting next week.

144
00:16:08,777 --> 00:16:09,978
[SPEAKER_10]: We asked for feedback.

145
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:16,163
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a couple of them respond saying thank you for the opportunity.

146
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:18,405
[SPEAKER_10]: They're looking forward to reading the zoning.

147
00:16:19,485 --> 00:16:22,986
[SPEAKER_10]: and nobody has actually sent me any feedback this evening.

148
00:16:23,387 --> 00:16:25,067
[SPEAKER_10]: You may want to open it to the public.

149
00:16:25,147 --> 00:16:28,008
[SPEAKER_10]: I see that there are a couple members of the public here.

150
00:16:28,528 --> 00:16:44,594
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if there's any chance they represent the developers or whatever, but I just wanted you to know that I had actually done some extra outreach on this to see if we would get any feedback from developers, property owners, or potential developers.

151
00:16:45,328 --> 00:16:46,748
[SPEAKER_08]: No, thank you, Director Hunt.

152
00:16:46,808 --> 00:16:47,749
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my oversight.

153
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:50,810
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually, this is a continuation of a public hearing.

154
00:16:50,830 --> 00:17:01,833
[SPEAKER_08]: So I absolutely do, before we go on with the vote, I want to open up to the public, whether there's members representing the public or not, just to give them the opportunity.

155
00:17:02,973 --> 00:17:05,894
[SPEAKER_08]: So at this point, I will open up the public comment period.

156
00:17:06,354 --> 00:17:11,216
[SPEAKER_08]: So those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments.

157
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:15,299
[SPEAKER_08]: You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov.

158
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Individuals may have up to three minutes to provide comments.

159
00:17:18,661 --> 00:17:23,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

160
00:17:23,524 --> 00:17:30,568
[SPEAKER_08]: A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record.

161
00:17:30,648 --> 00:17:37,672
[SPEAKER_08]: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and C-staff.

162
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:42,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Danielle, can you please manage the public comment queue?

163
00:17:42,257 --> 00:17:55,548
[SPEAKER_08]: And once that's done, if you, Alicia or Danielle, if you have anything that you want to read, emails or letters, or even if you want to, I know that we had one at the previous meeting, if you want to read that out again, I'm not sure if it's necessary.

164
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam chair, I don't believe that I have received any additional written comments.

165
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:15,144
[SPEAKER_06]: I also do not see any hands raised meeting tonight.

166
00:18:15,204 --> 00:18:18,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I can check the inbox.

167
00:18:23,907 --> 00:18:25,487
[SPEAKER_06]: See if there's anything in here that's come in.

168
00:18:25,507 --> 00:18:27,228
[SPEAKER_03]: So I last checked.

169
00:18:38,093 --> 00:18:40,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, Outlook is not responding, and I have a spinning wheel of death.

170
00:18:42,116 --> 00:18:47,859
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, Clem or Alicia, are you able to check the- I'm looking at it, and I don't see anything.

171
00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:49,761
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just sort of scrolling down.

172
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:54,444
[SPEAKER_10]: But if I scroll down to the 28th, I don't see anything relevant.

173
00:18:54,544 --> 00:18:56,065
[SPEAKER_10]: I assume you've checked it since then.

174
00:18:56,765 --> 00:18:58,886
[SPEAKER_10]: All the emails in the box are red.

175
00:18:58,906 --> 00:19:00,608
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't see anything relevant to this.

176
00:19:05,351 --> 00:19:05,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

177
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:29,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, so Madam Chair, for the record, we actively solicited developer property owner feedback and got acknowledgement that our messages were received, but have not received any actual feedback.

178
00:19:29,464 --> 00:19:37,471
[SPEAKER_10]: There was one question confirming that this was an overlay and not a complete rezoning such that the underlying zoning would stay in place, which is in fact correct.

179
00:19:38,993 --> 00:19:40,054
[SPEAKER_10]: But we answered that.

180
00:19:41,206 --> 00:19:44,229
[SPEAKER_06]: and developers, it's just for the public edification.

181
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:51,514
[SPEAKER_06]: A PDD overlay is still an option if a property owner wanted to use that tool.

182
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:59,201
[SPEAKER_06]: There are various options on the menu, and this 3A overlay is one of them.

183
00:19:59,221 --> 00:20:06,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, with that said,

184
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:15,933
[SPEAKER_08]: close the public comment period and come back to the board and sort of try to piece this all together and decide which scenario we are going to recommend to city council.

185
00:20:17,374 --> 00:20:29,296
[SPEAKER_08]: If we're going to all recommend to city council, are we going to do 0.5 and drop a story, which is four stories or keep 0.85 stories for minimum parking?

186
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:33,717
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will have to decide on one of those scenarios.

187
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:36,057
[SPEAKER_08]: What was presented was the original

188
00:20:37,865 --> 00:20:44,270
[SPEAKER_08]: 0.5 with four stories, or are we going to 0.8?

189
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Originally, it was 0.8 with five stories.

190
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:49,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we going to go to 0.5 and drop a story, four stories?

191
00:20:52,857 --> 00:20:56,460
[SPEAKER_08]: No, go ahead.

192
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,383
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you go right ahead, Ari.

193
00:21:00,883 --> 00:21:04,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to offer

194
00:21:04,613 --> 00:21:06,695
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of to decide between those two.

195
00:21:06,735 --> 00:21:14,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want like a straw poll before official voting to decide if one of them should be brought as an official motion?

196
00:21:15,721 --> 00:21:18,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do we want to just present one of those as a motion?

197
00:21:21,966 --> 00:21:28,430
[SPEAKER_08]: So because the zoning amendment has been presented for us, this is where we can actually change it.

198
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:32,013
[SPEAKER_08]: So we would be voting collectively at the end for whatever we decide.

199
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:36,589
[SPEAKER_08]: care for whatever we rectify here.

200
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:37,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that correct, Danielle?

201
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:40,890
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have to do a motion for which we're choosing.

202
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:45,851
[SPEAKER_08]: We just have to actually do a motion for whatever the recommendation is.

203
00:21:47,111 --> 00:21:47,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

204
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:57,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Your motion could be the draft as amended to reduce the minimum parking to

205
00:21:59,086 --> 00:22:04,550
[SPEAKER_06]: x and maximum to y. And then the same with the stories.

206
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,832
[SPEAKER_06]: I think those were the only changes.

207
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Or we can recommend to keep it active.

208
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:25,763
[SPEAKER_10]: And Madam Chair, I think sort of for the record in the end, you might want to have a motion that says that the board

209
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:46,113
[SPEAKER_10]: recommends that the city council adopt the zoning as presented with the changes, you know, discussed here and just so that for the record, you have, you know, actually voted on that you're recommending because based on your conversations, I assume that you are recommending that the city council adopt this.

210
00:22:46,553 --> 00:22:51,576
[SPEAKER_10]: So we should actually for the record, because then we'll draft a note to the council on that.

211
00:22:52,716 --> 00:22:53,317
[SPEAKER_06]: And if there's any

212
00:22:54,857 --> 00:23:01,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Discussion or anything that you'd like me to include in the memo that gets submitted to city council.

213
00:23:02,225 --> 00:23:04,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm just sorry.

214
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:13,737
[SPEAKER_10]: He private private message to me a. There was a typo in the zoning that 1 of the rows in the.

215
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:15,919
[SPEAKER_10]: Use table was blank.

216
00:23:17,255 --> 00:23:21,138
[SPEAKER_10]: and we're supposed to have either a Y or an SP, but not be blank.

217
00:23:21,218 --> 00:23:24,560
[SPEAKER_10]: None of them were ever intended to be blank, which is why I'm calling it a typo.

218
00:23:25,081 --> 00:23:35,128
[SPEAKER_10]: But it would be cleaner if this board actually made a recommendation that one of its recommendations was to change the blank to either Y or SP.

219
00:23:35,768 --> 00:23:36,629
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd have to pull it up.

220
00:23:36,709 --> 00:23:41,132
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the non-commercial greenhouse tool shed accessory structure.

221
00:23:41,152 --> 00:23:42,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Number seven.

222
00:23:45,197 --> 00:23:55,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Remind me the multifamily use, was that in the version that went to city council the first time?

223
00:23:55,379 --> 00:23:59,620
[SPEAKER_10]: I would really like to pull up, I apologize.

224
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,000
[SPEAKER_10]: So I apologize for being late.

225
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,821
[SPEAKER_10]: I came directly from a city council meeting.

226
00:24:06,601 --> 00:24:10,382
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love, I don't actually have the zoning we're discussing up in front of me.

227
00:24:10,562 --> 00:24:11,642
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanna pull it up.

228
00:24:12,423 --> 00:24:13,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Clem.

229
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:21,633
[SPEAKER_10]: So the rows about multifamily, did that get corrected before we, can you scroll up to the top of this actually?

230
00:24:21,653 --> 00:24:24,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, there, yes.

231
00:24:25,176 --> 00:24:32,442
[SPEAKER_10]: So it is just multifamily is listed as a Y and then we'll have the definition of multifamily is in there.

232
00:24:32,983 --> 00:24:40,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Rather than in the rest of our zoning, we have multifamily class A and multifamily class B and the classes,

233
00:24:42,295 --> 00:24:46,057
[SPEAKER_10]: is what distinguishes whether it's up to three stories or up to six stories.

234
00:24:46,577 --> 00:24:54,400
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we actually just want generic multifamily allowed with no association with height in the category type.

235
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,681
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the height is controlled in the rest of the zoning.

236
00:24:58,281 --> 00:25:05,664
[SPEAKER_10]: It is our hope that this is something that we'll change in the zoning update that occurs next spring.

237
00:25:12,565 --> 00:25:17,868
[SPEAKER_08]: The actual recommendation of city council is not just to approve, but also to adopt.

238
00:25:17,968 --> 00:25:19,208
[SPEAKER_08]: That's two different motions?

239
00:25:20,469 --> 00:25:20,749
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

240
00:25:20,969 --> 00:25:22,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Adopting and approving are the same thing.

241
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:23,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

242
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:23,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

243
00:25:23,751 --> 00:25:26,332
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the motion I would be looking for from the board.

244
00:25:26,872 --> 00:25:27,112
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

245
00:25:27,933 --> 00:25:32,335
[SPEAKER_10]: With the amendments that you all put forward.

246
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:42,147
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that the intention was that the line seven was to have a Y like the rest of them, and it was a blank.

247
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:47,011
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I think it would be cleaner if you all could recommend that they also do that.

248
00:25:49,254 --> 00:25:52,917
[SPEAKER_10]: I see member Hedeman has, Emily has her hand up.

249
00:25:56,881 --> 00:25:59,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Through the chair, it's more of an administrative question.

250
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:06,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I was unfortunately not in attendance at the last meeting where I believe the, the public hearing started.

251
00:26:06,814 --> 00:26:13,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, am I eligible to vote in any motions that are associated with this topic?

252
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:15,821
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking back to previous.

253
00:26:16,081 --> 00:26:16,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

254
00:26:16,782 --> 00:26:25,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because you didn't, um, unless you watched the, um, the recording and then

255
00:26:25,555 --> 00:26:28,097
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you did, you could sign something attesting that you did.

256
00:26:28,117 --> 00:26:30,419
[SPEAKER_06]: If you didn't get a chance to do that then.

257
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:33,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'll just, I'll abstain.

258
00:26:35,022 --> 00:26:35,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for confirming.

259
00:26:36,964 --> 00:26:37,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

260
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:53,317
[SPEAKER_08]: So to clarify, Robin's rules are she would have had to have watched it previous to tonight's meeting and had signed off saying that she watched it and then she can continue tonight and vote.

261
00:26:54,685 --> 00:26:54,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

262
00:26:55,586 --> 00:26:57,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Technically, it's not Roberts rules.

263
00:26:57,607 --> 00:27:02,009
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually stayed open meeting law and that there's called the Mullen rule.

264
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:05,891
[SPEAKER_10]: And sorry, that's what I meant.

265
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:16,097
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, this board adopted the Mullen rule years ago, which means somebody can watch the video or listen to the recording, and then come up to speed.

266
00:27:16,337 --> 00:27:22,881
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they give us a literally a sign thing saying I watched this that we put in the file, and then they can vote.

267
00:27:27,321 --> 00:27:32,224
[SPEAKER_06]: But if we have a quorum, then it's not necessary.

268
00:27:32,244 --> 00:27:35,025
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't prevent a member from participating in the discussion.

269
00:27:35,065 --> 00:27:36,506
[SPEAKER_06]: They just can't vote.

270
00:27:36,566 --> 00:27:45,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if it was something that was going to be, this isn't going to pass, or we don't even have the numbers to make the vote, then we definitely would be like, let's break quorum.

271
00:27:45,951 --> 00:27:49,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I had to do something for that over the summer.

272
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:50,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's what I was thinking of, Peter.

273
00:27:50,394 --> 00:27:56,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think it was the two of us missed a meeting, and we needed to watch it so that we could vote on it because we didn't have a quorum.

274
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

275
00:28:01,553 --> 00:28:01,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

276
00:28:14,743 --> 00:28:15,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

277
00:28:15,104 --> 00:28:26,292
[SPEAKER_08]: So at this point, we would need a motion to recommend to City Council that they approve the Wellington Station Multifamily Overlay District

278
00:28:27,878 --> 00:28:32,180
[SPEAKER_08]: As amended, for the parking spaces, are we doing 0.8 or 0.5?

279
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:38,963
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that would be more of a discussion for the board to see.

280
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:39,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter, what was your

281
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:58,642
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it's not really a roll call, but if I, if I, I guess, call out, then you can tell me what your voice is for.

282
00:28:58,662 --> 00:29:04,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Park and minimums and maximum.

283
00:29:11,526 --> 00:29:12,027
[SPEAKER_08]: So Peter.

284
00:29:12,047 --> 00:29:15,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

285
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you voting to amend it?

286
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:28,682
[SPEAKER_08]: We discussed at the last meet, and it was originally 0.5.

287
00:29:28,802 --> 00:29:33,363
[SPEAKER_08]: It was originally 0.8 with five stories, and are we amending it?

288
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:38,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we keeping that for minimums, or are we going to 0.5, four stories?

289
00:29:43,786 --> 00:29:48,827
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be inclined to keep the 0.8 if only because I want to keep the five stories.

290
00:29:50,407 --> 00:29:51,408
[SPEAKER_05]: You want the five stories?

291
00:29:52,108 --> 00:29:56,751
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not in love with the 0.8, but I would value the more housing.

292
00:29:57,711 --> 00:29:58,112
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

293
00:29:58,472 --> 00:30:00,913
[SPEAKER_06]: It can go up to nine with the incentives, remember.

294
00:30:04,795 --> 00:30:05,076
OK.

295
00:30:08,157 --> 00:30:09,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Sally Akiki?

296
00:30:09,158 --> 00:30:12,220
[SPEAKER_09]: 0.8 with five stories.

297
00:30:15,965 --> 00:30:20,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, Sally, also for your maximum, are you at 1.5 or 1.2?

298
00:30:20,706 --> 00:30:20,146
1.5.

299
00:30:24,147 --> 00:30:27,108
[SPEAKER_08]: And Peter?

300
00:30:27,128 --> 00:30:27,108
1.2.

301
00:30:28,188 --> 00:30:28,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Sherrod?

302
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:37,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I vote no on the entire thing?

303
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:42,012
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not going to vote to recommend that at all?

304
00:30:42,532 --> 00:30:44,573
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not want this to be

305
00:30:45,821 --> 00:30:47,521
[SPEAKER_00]: move to the council.

306
00:30:48,782 --> 00:30:49,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

307
00:30:55,143 --> 00:30:56,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Pam Marianski?

308
00:30:56,744 --> 00:31:04,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm fine with the 0.8 and five stories and then the max 1.5.

309
00:31:08,106 --> 00:31:10,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and then myself for the record.

310
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:11,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I?

311
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Me.

312
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:21,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sorry, Ari.

313
00:31:21,185 --> 00:31:22,926
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like the.

314
00:31:22,946 --> 00:31:23,026
[SPEAKER_02]: What.

315
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:30,866
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller minimum with four stories.

316
00:31:30,966 --> 00:31:33,328
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it will ever actually be built with four stories.

317
00:31:33,389 --> 00:31:35,691
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to go up with the incentives.

318
00:31:36,191 --> 00:31:46,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I similarly want lots of housing, but I think that the lower minimum is good and the 1.2 maximum.

319
00:31:49,162 --> 00:31:51,965
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting a sense that we don't actually have an agreement.

320
00:31:55,724 --> 00:31:58,208
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Chair, I think there's some confusion here.

321
00:31:58,528 --> 00:32:03,315
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, I would like to understand why Sherrod doesn't want to recommend this at all.

322
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:05,057
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to understand that.

323
00:32:05,377 --> 00:32:12,027
[SPEAKER_10]: But on the other hand, what I heard Peter say was that he wanted more density at this location.

324
00:32:12,467 --> 00:32:31,952
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to just post this into the chat because we said this out loud, but if you do 0.5 spaces minimum and a max of four stories with them not taking us any incentives and they actually did 0.5 spaces, the maximum build-out capacity of the zone is 6,595 units.

325
00:32:35,508 --> 00:32:44,292
[SPEAKER_10]: If they did 0.8 spaces with a max of five stories, the maximum number of units in the build-out is actually lower, is 6,472.

326
00:32:46,565 --> 00:33:08,077
[SPEAKER_10]: However, I will talk about that, and I wonder if this might be where Member Peters was going, is that based on conversations I've had with developers, I find it unlikely that any developers would build a less than a one-to-one ratio anywhere in the city of Medford, even if they were allowed to go down this low.

327
00:33:09,718 --> 00:33:15,861
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what we've heard in other locations and from actually a developer who was looking at one of these sites.

328
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what I'd be.

329
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:28,448
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, I think, the conversation from last time I was remembering having is that we can set this.

330
00:33:28,568 --> 00:33:31,670
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, I'd love to set it at the 0.5 for four stories.

331
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,751
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to allow more density.

332
00:33:33,791 --> 00:33:44,177
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think realistically, things being as they are, developers aren't going to come into Medford and develop at a parking ratio under one anyway.

333
00:33:44,197 --> 00:33:47,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, we're not.

334
00:33:48,308 --> 00:33:48,950
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not Cambridge.

335
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,333
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not the denser parts of Boston.

336
00:33:50,354 --> 00:33:51,095
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just not.

337
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:56,710
[SPEAKER_05]: I think residential developers would not see that as marketable.

338
00:33:59,587 --> 00:34:04,009
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's where we got into the development incentives and how that played into the parking.

339
00:34:04,189 --> 00:34:12,692
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm almost positive, but Sharad can share more of his side of that's where he was a little apprehensive about with the density and so forth.

340
00:34:12,892 --> 00:34:18,955
[SPEAKER_00]: But Sharad, you know, like, I was not convinced about the actual reality of where

341
00:34:20,209 --> 00:34:23,290
[SPEAKER_00]: parcels were going to be developed.

342
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:30,711
[SPEAKER_00]: I take this as a big opportunity for Medford for developers to actually come in and get more housing done.

343
00:34:31,131 --> 00:34:37,252
[SPEAKER_00]: But with this location that was chosen, I do not think it's enough.

344
00:34:37,572 --> 00:34:45,254
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there is three parcels in total that has a real potential to be developed and that would account for 500 units.

345
00:34:46,653 --> 00:34:47,553
[SPEAKER_00]: at the max.

346
00:34:47,733 --> 00:34:53,555
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're losing out on an opportunity to actually add more housing.

347
00:34:54,095 --> 00:34:57,116
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this could be done by expanding the area more further.

348
00:34:57,676 --> 00:35:05,698
[SPEAKER_00]: I pointed out last time that maybe we can reduce the land area from 10,000 to 8,000 maybe.

349
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:14,940
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think in the real estate point of view, the parkings and all those things does matter, but I see only like three parcels that are actually going to be developed here.

350
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:15,640
[SPEAKER_00]: So

351
00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:21,917
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for me, everything else doesn't matter because nothing's really going to happen here.

352
00:35:22,718 --> 00:35:23,519
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my point of view.

353
00:35:26,105 --> 00:35:39,934
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe the city responded, please correct me if I'm wrong, but this is the area outside of that is already planned for, the city has planning goals for like commercial and lab space, not residential.

354
00:35:40,014 --> 00:35:47,558
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's pretty much why moving to another part of the city is not really feasible with compliance for one or with the city's planning goals.

355
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:54,623
[SPEAKER_08]: And so as highlighted by Danielle with the previous meeting.

356
00:35:55,337 --> 00:35:56,017
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

357
00:35:56,897 --> 00:36:10,120
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of that, even the space over here, this could be expanded up to the full 0.5 miles from the center, and that would include a lot more properties there.

358
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:14,081
[SPEAKER_00]: I think West Medford, again, it's still a viable option for me.

359
00:36:14,161 --> 00:36:23,603
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a historic district, but I think there's a viable option in West Medford over this Wellington area when I look at it in detail.

360
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:45,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Does the passing of this, or does us, our recommending, um, making a recommendation to city council, does that exclude further overlay zones for some of the areas that Sharon's talking about in West Medford?

361
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:55,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this like a either or situation or is this, let's talk about this piece today and maybe we can talk about those other pieces another day?

362
00:36:58,552 --> 00:37:13,121
[SPEAKER_10]: So Madam Chair, I think that I was one of the updates I was going to provide to you all at the end of the meeting is that we are with the city council in the process of hiring a zoning consultant and lawyer to look at completely rezoning the entire city.

363
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,883
[SPEAKER_10]: So you may remember the RFQ we put out for a zoning consultant.

364
00:37:16,983 --> 00:37:18,484
[SPEAKER_10]: We got responses back.

365
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:22,867
[SPEAKER_10]: I reviewed those responses with the city council.

366
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:44,919
[SPEAKER_10]: this evening that's why I was a few minutes late tonight and they have a strong recommendation that we move forward with opening the price proposal to hire one of the consultants on there I guess that was a public meeting on TV so I might as well say it was the team of Emily Innes and Jonathan Silverstein and that

367
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,745
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just going to move forward with the technical pieces of that.

368
00:37:50,465 --> 00:37:58,775
[SPEAKER_10]: But the intention is actually to look at complete rezoning of the entire city, re-looking at all of our pieces.

369
00:37:59,356 --> 00:38:02,019
[SPEAKER_10]: We also have a grant from

370
00:38:05,262 --> 00:38:14,589
[SPEAKER_10]: actually it's a state earmark to do an economic development study of West Medford to look at what we should be doing there.

371
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:19,793
[SPEAKER_10]: And our lack of economic development staff has prevented us from moving forward on that.

372
00:38:20,574 --> 00:38:24,356
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's one of the in-depth studies we'd like to get going.

373
00:38:24,737 --> 00:38:31,962
[SPEAKER_10]: I also am hoping that we will be offering an economic development planner position next week.

374
00:38:32,682 --> 00:38:35,824
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to answer the question that I asked.

375
00:38:35,984 --> 00:38:36,604
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like.

376
00:38:38,225 --> 00:38:40,966
[SPEAKER_07]: We can recommend this overlay district.

377
00:38:42,027 --> 00:38:49,451
[SPEAKER_07]: And it doesn't mean that we're not going to recommend development opportunities or incentives for development in other areas.

378
00:38:50,451 --> 00:38:51,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

379
00:38:51,752 --> 00:38:52,472
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just right.

380
00:38:52,792 --> 00:38:53,793
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a choice.

381
00:38:54,253 --> 00:38:59,456
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the way to meet the state's requirements in the timeline the state has given us.

382
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,992
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, under the year is the deadline.

383
00:39:03,292 --> 00:39:08,676
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we don't make the deadline, then we will be ineligible for millions and millions of dollars of grants.

384
00:39:09,957 --> 00:39:17,222
[SPEAKER_06]: And this 3A is applicable to 177 cities and towns as a one size fits all.

385
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:27,709
[SPEAKER_07]: If we apply that- I'm just trying to think through the thoughtful points that fellow board member Sherrod raised.

386
00:39:29,554 --> 00:39:33,598
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, just also to get some clarification myself, because, you know, it's a great point.

387
00:39:33,618 --> 00:39:44,288
[SPEAKER_07]: There are other areas of Medford that, you know, have a lot of potential, and we want to make sure that, you know, we're treating all areas of Medford reasonably.

388
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:48,633
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, you know, I think the attention paid to this area is

389
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:50,138
[SPEAKER_07]: is reasonable.

390
00:39:51,219 --> 00:39:58,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Also having a very intimate knowledge of this area, I realized, you know, we have some like land boundaries around us.

391
00:39:58,421 --> 00:40:05,423
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Malden to the north, we have the Malden River on one side, we have the Mystic River on the south.

392
00:40:06,023 --> 00:40:11,705
[SPEAKER_07]: So in terms of expanding the radius of this overlay district, you know, those are three boundaries.

393
00:40:11,725 --> 00:40:18,967
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on the northwest corner, there's a lot of like single family residential and

394
00:40:19,805 --> 00:40:30,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, we have the, I forget what the traffic circle is called, but every morning, yeah, it treats me to a wonderful experience.

395
00:40:31,072 --> 00:40:40,318
[SPEAKER_07]: So we might have some boundaries that like, that, you know, might be challenging to expand the area beyond what is proposed today.

396
00:40:40,338 --> 00:40:47,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are just some initial thoughts, but, um, thanks for, for raising those really thoughtful points.

397
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter, you have a question?

398
00:40:54,353 --> 00:41:10,206
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I was just going to bring up the kind of, I mean, I think whatever question I had only answered, but I was also going to bring up the issue of the state compliance and that we.

399
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:17,235
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to get this done for just this very explicit legal purpose.

400
00:41:18,036 --> 00:41:24,061
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can talk about better zoning West Medford after that.

401
00:41:24,121 --> 00:41:39,034
[SPEAKER_05]: But this area as just an area around a rapid transit station has to get done sooner rather than later so that we can be in good standing with the state, which is obviously very important.

402
00:41:51,283 --> 00:42:03,310
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, I want to make sure that we're all, I guess, even for myself, I inadvertently assumed that the 0.55 stories was given us more.

403
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:07,833
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure how we got that backwards.

404
00:42:10,733 --> 00:42:24,465
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess, realistically, the one with five stories, the 0.8 with five stories, if you really, if you think from the perspective, it reminds me, Peter, I believe you're a transportation planner, right?

405
00:42:25,185 --> 00:42:26,907
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're muted.

406
00:42:29,793 --> 00:42:31,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Traffic engineer, but close enough.

407
00:42:31,214 --> 00:42:33,835
[SPEAKER_10]: Traffic engineer, thank you.

408
00:42:34,235 --> 00:42:41,419
[SPEAKER_10]: There's real reason to believe that developers would never go lower than 0.8, and we actually think one is more.

409
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:54,607
[SPEAKER_10]: When you say, well, if they actually build with one-to-one ratio of parking, then the option that allows five stories is actually going to yield more units than the option that allows four stories.

410
00:42:55,767 --> 00:42:59,971
[SPEAKER_10]: But really, we've heard from developers who'd rather do eight, seven or eight.

411
00:43:00,091 --> 00:43:05,996
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we think that they will take the incentives that we're putting for the easy extra stories.

412
00:43:10,179 --> 00:43:12,101
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just dropped some math in the chat.

413
00:43:12,121 --> 00:43:14,583
[SPEAKER_06]: You can read it out loud.

414
00:43:14,603 --> 00:43:23,911
[SPEAKER_06]: So the example of a 400 unit project, if you have 0.8 spaces, that means it'd be 320 parking spaces minimum that would be required to be built.

415
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:27,998
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's 0.5, that drops down to 200 minimum spaces.

416
00:43:28,959 --> 00:43:38,285
[SPEAKER_06]: If we have a maximum of 1.5 spaces, that means the developer would only be allowed to build 600 spaces for a 400-unit project.

417
00:43:38,305 --> 00:43:44,190
[SPEAKER_06]: If we drop that to 1.2, 480 spaces would be allowed to be built.

418
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:50,694
[SPEAKER_06]: So just tweaking that by a fraction does change it quite a bit.

419
00:43:52,855 --> 00:43:56,818
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just pulled 400 out of thin air looking at the unit yields for some of the parcels.

420
00:43:57,699 --> 00:43:58,600
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of in the middle.

421
00:44:02,844 --> 00:44:08,649
[SPEAKER_06]: And just to reiterate, the minimum parking doesn't compel them to only provide the 0.8.

422
00:44:09,149 --> 00:44:11,431
[SPEAKER_06]: If they want to provide one, they can.

423
00:44:11,631 --> 00:44:13,313
[SPEAKER_06]: They can provide up to the maximum.

424
00:44:14,053 --> 00:44:17,897
[SPEAKER_06]: So whether we think they'll do 0.8 or not, it's kind of like,

425
00:44:19,355 --> 00:44:20,936
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess not that important.

426
00:44:21,656 --> 00:44:36,443
[SPEAKER_06]: But if the developer is insisting that their product demands 1.2 spaces, then they'll build that if it's allowed, regardless of what the minimum is.

427
00:44:40,705 --> 00:44:43,486
[SPEAKER_08]: And then remind me of the affordable units.

428
00:44:43,526 --> 00:44:45,567
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's affordable units, it has to be set at 0.5, correct?

429
00:44:49,541 --> 00:44:50,241
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the minimum.

430
00:44:50,881 --> 00:44:51,802
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the minimum.

431
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:52,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

432
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:53,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Not the maximum.

433
00:44:56,503 --> 00:44:56,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

434
00:44:57,003 --> 00:45:00,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Question through the chair about the unit capacity.

435
00:45:01,704 --> 00:45:14,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that, so the number of units that we're talking about, is that a function of like the square footage of units, the square footage of parking spaces and the floor area ratio of these parcels?

436
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:23,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you talking about how does the model contemplate?

437
00:45:23,232 --> 00:45:25,853
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, it has a bunch of assumptions.

438
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:27,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

439
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:32,717
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we enter in the zoning parameters.

440
00:45:33,377 --> 00:45:34,838
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it spits it out.

441
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:36,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's not exact.

442
00:45:36,219 --> 00:45:39,060
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they just use averages.

443
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:40,761
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.

444
00:45:40,781 --> 00:45:44,763
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably in the really long explainer.

445
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:44,823
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

446
00:45:46,913 --> 00:45:53,635
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's what they will judge compliance based on that model for everyone.

447
00:45:54,795 --> 00:45:55,175
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

448
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:56,356
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, great.

449
00:45:57,176 --> 00:45:57,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

450
00:45:58,836 --> 00:46:12,060
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, that's just to go back to what Alicia was saying about we can talk about 0.8s or 0.5s.

451
00:46:16,325 --> 00:46:24,527
[SPEAKER_05]: a developer's going to come in and build the amount of parking that they think will make the building marketable.

452
00:46:25,168 --> 00:46:29,769
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where I think the maximum will have a bigger impact.

453
00:46:30,869 --> 00:46:32,270
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just my thought.

454
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:43,433
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of my logic behind going with the 0.8 for the minimum, but going down to the 1.2 for the maximum, that we can

455
00:46:45,107 --> 00:46:55,856
[SPEAKER_05]: We can say the 0.8 minimum, and it's not terribly likely that developers will come in and do a 0.8 space per unit parking minimum.

456
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:59,519
[SPEAKER_05]: But with the maximum, that is something we are definitively saying.

457
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,522
[SPEAKER_05]: They cannot go over 1.2 spaces per unit.

458
00:47:05,765 --> 00:47:06,966
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that's just my two cents.

459
00:47:15,574 --> 00:47:21,219
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm assuming that that's pretty much where the rest of the board was coming from too, 0.8, because it's not written.

460
00:47:21,379 --> 00:47:22,921
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a barrier removed.

461
00:47:22,941 --> 00:47:29,606
[SPEAKER_08]: They can do what they can, but then it's more so the maximum that we were really looking to change.

462
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:34,210
[SPEAKER_08]: But we wanted to bring it down to 0.8 to give them the option, even if it's not something that they pick up on.

463
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:35,951
[SPEAKER_08]: So 0.8 for minimum, and then perhaps 1.2 for maximum.

464
00:47:35,971 --> 00:47:37,232
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that's where I landed.

465
00:47:48,178 --> 00:47:55,940
[SPEAKER_08]: And it looks like Ari landed there, as did Peter.

466
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:05,483
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's three of us, but we have Sally with 1.5 maximum, and Pam with 1.5 maximum.

467
00:48:08,603 --> 00:48:14,305
[SPEAKER_08]: And Sherrod, Emily abstaining, and Sherrod, a no.

468
00:48:17,711 --> 00:48:18,771
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be fine with the 1.2.

469
00:48:18,851 --> 00:48:21,932
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting kind of swayed toward that.

470
00:48:21,952 --> 00:48:23,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

471
00:48:26,373 --> 00:48:27,233
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so now we have.

472
00:48:27,253 --> 00:48:47,058
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so I guess, so let me just let me try this.

473
00:48:48,967 --> 00:49:13,288
[SPEAKER_08]: So are we prepared to vote on a recommendation with the motion to recommend to city council that they approve the Wellington station multifamily overlay district as amended to 0.8, which is five stories for minimum parking and 1.2 for maximum parking and making sure to add the Y

474
00:49:14,712 --> 00:49:19,495
[SPEAKER_08]: for non-commercial greenhouse, tool shed, or similar assessment structure?

475
00:49:21,056 --> 00:49:22,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I get that right, Alicia?

476
00:49:22,597 --> 00:49:35,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam Chair, I think that 0.8 was what was brought to you, so I think the only part that would be amended would be the maximum.

477
00:49:35,464 --> 00:49:36,125
[SPEAKER_08]: It was originally 0.8.

478
00:49:36,405 --> 00:49:42,448
[SPEAKER_06]: 0.8 in five stories, and then we bandied around whether 0.5, four stories instead.

479
00:49:46,130 --> 00:50:03,915
[SPEAKER_06]: But it looks like the consensus is landing on changing the max to 1.2 and then correcting that typo, the Y. Can I make a quick pitch for putting in a minimum that will not be used?

480
00:50:07,196 --> 00:50:12,258
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that they're probably going to build much higher than the minimum.

481
00:50:12,298 --> 00:50:13,198
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

482
00:50:14,765 --> 00:50:24,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that 0.5 is lower than many of the minimums for these large things, and I'm a fan of a symbolic gesture if this minimum is going to be symbolic anyway.

483
00:50:25,936 --> 00:50:29,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm totally okay with being overridden, but I did want to make that pitch.

484
00:50:29,299 --> 00:50:37,868
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that price is right approach.

485
00:50:48,135 --> 00:51:11,050
[SPEAKER_08]: So for myself, I'm not a transportation planner, but dealing in economic development and some of the things that I know that goes into the traffic engineering and everything that comes with developers and their incentives, I'm willing to keep it at 1.8 to keep it attractive, even though, I mean, I don't know how the board feels about going to 0.5 at this point.

486
00:51:16,245 --> 00:51:21,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that Ari said they're fine with being overridden.

487
00:51:21,709 --> 00:51:39,260
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, as someone who does work on the traffic side for developers sometimes, the lower parking minimum and the relative car dependency is going to make it a hard square to circle for developers in some ways.

488
00:51:40,101 --> 00:51:41,882
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to make it less marketable.

489
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:48,981
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do appreciate the symbolic gesture.

490
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:57,044
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know what will make the developers, I have seen what will make the developers bite a little harder.

491
00:51:59,384 --> 00:52:03,565
[SPEAKER_08]: And we don't want the city to lose an economic development planner before they get them.

492
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:13,288
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess am I?

493
00:52:14,052 --> 00:52:15,853
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to reiterate here.

494
00:52:18,876 --> 00:52:20,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Emily's hand is up again.

495
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,118
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

496
00:52:22,178 --> 00:52:25,180
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep going back and forth between wanting to ask questions and share my thoughts.

497
00:52:26,561 --> 00:52:40,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter, following up on what you just said, are you saying that, is your hypothesis, if the parking space minimum is too low,

498
00:52:42,061 --> 00:52:44,443
[SPEAKER_07]: then developers will not develop?

499
00:52:44,683 --> 00:52:47,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the basic hypothesis?

500
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:52,468
[SPEAKER_05]: You're muted.

501
00:52:53,909 --> 00:52:55,410
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a blanket statement.

502
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:57,631
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a blanket statement.

503
00:52:57,651 --> 00:53:03,315
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to be perceived as being pro more parking, because I'm definitely not.

504
00:53:03,896 --> 00:53:05,537
[SPEAKER_05]: But just having it.

505
00:53:06,729 --> 00:53:32,867
[SPEAKER_05]: just having been part of some of these processes, it sometimes just makes a more, if developers see what they can perceive as a more difficult kind of loophole to close with something like parking, I mean, it's like, you'd see developers be,

506
00:53:34,033 --> 00:53:39,434
[SPEAKER_05]: fine to do 0.5 or even lower in some denser areas.

507
00:53:40,014 --> 00:53:50,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is something Alicia brought up last time that in a lot of Medford, you would struggle to get a developer who would be comfortable with that.

508
00:53:50,476 --> 00:54:01,778
[SPEAKER_05]: And just if they see that, it raises flags that there might be a argument or a process that maybe there wouldn't be at all, but it would make it harder for some.

509
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:03,338
[SPEAKER_05]: It would make it less attractive.

510
00:54:04,839 --> 00:54:10,921
[SPEAKER_07]: even though the 0.5 is a minimum, so they could build one.

511
00:54:10,941 --> 00:54:14,482
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not saying that they have to build 0.5.

512
00:54:14,522 --> 00:54:16,823
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

513
00:54:16,843 --> 00:54:21,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because I think that's the disconnect.

514
00:54:21,084 --> 00:54:21,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I guess I get that.

515
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:39,448
[SPEAKER_05]: You're making me think we should go down to 0.5.

516
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:41,769
[SPEAKER_07]: The minimum is the minimum.

517
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:48,273
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to be at that minimum.

518
00:54:49,053 --> 00:55:01,180
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to be between these two datums that were created, whatever the maximum is and whatever the minimum is.

519
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:11,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Peter, is it because they would be pressured to abide by the minimum depending on the neighborhood?

520
00:55:14,038 --> 00:55:14,238
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

521
00:55:14,998 --> 00:55:20,480
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I appreciate everyone's arguments because it's kind of making me clarify my thinking.

522
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:32,463
[SPEAKER_05]: I think where I've seen people run into problems with these kind of things before is when you do have a development come in in an area with low minimums,

523
00:55:33,456 --> 00:55:42,379
[SPEAKER_05]: that does try to do the minimum, and then you get a lot of community pushback of where people are going to park.

524
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:44,600
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great point.

525
00:55:47,441 --> 00:55:50,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for everyone for their arguments, because it made me actually figure out.

526
00:55:51,122 --> 00:55:55,944
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew I had this line of reasoning in my head somewhere, and I was trying to figure out where it was.

527
00:55:55,984 --> 00:55:57,104
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's that.

528
00:55:57,724 --> 00:56:01,986
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have someone come in and try to do the minimum, you're going to get a lot of pushback.

529
00:56:05,002 --> 00:56:13,167
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have one space for every two units and you have somebody come in and try to actually do that, it's going to be harder to get that through.

530
00:56:13,187 --> 00:56:18,551
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's what would lead me towards the 0.8.

531
00:56:19,531 --> 00:56:25,955
[SPEAKER_05]: In case someone actually came in and tried to do 0.5, it would have a hard time not running into a lot of problems.

532
00:56:31,332 --> 00:56:33,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I ask a question through the chair to Peter?

533
00:56:34,033 --> 00:56:34,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

534
00:56:35,994 --> 00:56:38,935
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you mean they'd have a hard time getting it through?

535
00:56:38,955 --> 00:56:40,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this would be by right.

536
00:56:40,996 --> 00:56:41,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, that's true.

537
00:56:41,956 --> 00:56:42,616
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking of.

538
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:49,859
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not your board approving it or the city council having to approve.

539
00:56:50,959 --> 00:56:57,062
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, you can look at site design, but I don't think that

540
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:03,519
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, Alicia, I'm curious about this.

541
00:57:04,039 --> 00:57:19,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Within site plan review, which is you have to approve it, could the board compel them to add more spaces or to build to the maximum?

542
00:57:21,809 --> 00:57:23,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a fair point.

543
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:24,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't thought of it by right.

544
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:25,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

545
00:57:25,071 --> 00:57:27,312
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't compel them to do anything.

546
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:34,496
[SPEAKER_10]: in site plan review, you can ask, you can suggest, you can kind of negotiate things.

547
00:57:39,179 --> 00:57:49,046
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a very, there is a line actually, like, at one point, we had a project where they didn't want to do the groundwater testing that the engineer was requiring.

548
00:57:49,767 --> 00:57:50,968
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was different.

549
00:57:52,555 --> 00:58:00,377
[SPEAKER_10]: But you can't compel them to change their design for a non-life safety meet our other requirements, right?

550
00:58:06,018 --> 00:58:06,238
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

551
00:58:06,418 --> 00:58:08,258
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's helpful.

552
00:58:08,839 --> 00:58:09,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

553
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:13,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I was not considering it as a by right case.

554
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:15,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I was forgetting that because.

555
00:58:17,948 --> 00:58:21,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Because my previous experience has not been with things by right.

556
00:58:21,829 --> 00:58:23,029
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, oh, we're going to go to this.

557
00:58:23,049 --> 00:58:24,469
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're going to say, you don't have enough parking.

558
00:58:24,889 --> 00:58:29,850
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it's by right, you can't reject it out of hand for that.

559
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:32,711
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a bit of a traditional thing.

560
00:58:33,651 --> 00:58:45,433
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's one of the big reasons that the legislature passed this law, was to take out that discretion of things are allowed.

561
00:58:47,087 --> 00:58:51,872
[SPEAKER_06]: In name only, but are they really if everything's a special permit and they can say no to everything then.

562
00:58:53,153 --> 00:58:53,874
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a problem.

563
00:58:54,314 --> 00:58:58,338
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why the by right, but allowing site plan review.

564
00:59:00,761 --> 00:59:01,742
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as you approve it.

565
00:59:01,762 --> 00:59:08,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so.

566
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:15,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we, Jackie, are we going to make a motion?

567
00:59:15,405 --> 00:59:17,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the next step here?

568
00:59:17,747 --> 00:59:18,988
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's what I'm just trying.

569
00:59:19,008 --> 00:59:34,441
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm trying to stay out as much as the conversation as possible, because as you know, just what would be in my previous agency, well, now that we're separated, the whole idea of it being an MBTA rule is to eliminate parking minimum.

570
00:59:34,481 --> 00:59:37,124
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm trying not to be too heavy handed on my,

571
00:59:39,771 --> 00:59:43,073
[SPEAKER_08]: my share and why I think it should be.

572
00:59:43,093 --> 00:59:50,897
[SPEAKER_08]: I prefer for the boards to deliberate and for us to get to an agreement of what the minimum parking is.

573
00:59:50,917 --> 00:59:58,241
[SPEAKER_05]: This is great because I've gone back and forth three or four times at this point.

574
00:59:58,321 --> 00:59:59,382
[SPEAKER_05]: It lasts like 10 minutes.

575
01:00:00,303 --> 01:00:01,564
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, which is great.

576
01:00:01,624 --> 01:00:05,945
[SPEAKER_08]: And I like I said, I just I allow you to go I it this is great for other members.

577
01:00:06,045 --> 01:00:11,407
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's even you know, great for the members of the audience, the public and even myself just to hear it.

578
01:00:11,447 --> 01:00:16,029
[SPEAKER_08]: But I already know that I am sort of biased in where I sit, unfortunately.

579
01:00:16,109 --> 01:00:28,373
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I think I'd given that and given the given the by right nature and given that

580
01:00:29,968 --> 01:00:46,383
[SPEAKER_05]: given the minimum that nobody is probably going to build to anyway, I'd be fine at this point with going down to the 0.5 of four stories if that is something that the rest of the board would be interested in.

581
01:00:46,403 --> 01:00:51,047
[SPEAKER_05]: But kind of similar to Ari, if the 0.8 is going to

582
01:00:56,937 --> 01:01:05,104
[SPEAKER_05]: past, I'm willing to be overridden, but I think that's actually three people in favor, but I'm not counting.

583
01:01:08,947 --> 01:01:12,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'd be fine with the 0.5 and the four stories.

584
01:01:14,191 --> 01:01:19,376
[SPEAKER_05]: My bigger thing is the 1.2 max.

585
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:21,497
[SPEAKER_05]: If I was going to pick a hill to die on, it would be that one.

586
01:01:23,985 --> 01:01:28,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm looking more at the maximums than I am at the minimums, but it looks like.

587
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:33,813
[SPEAKER_08]: So we would be amending to so we were at this point.

588
01:01:33,853 --> 01:01:40,278
[SPEAKER_08]: We were asking for a vote to recommend just to get a little bit more of the boys temperature again.

589
01:01:40,418 --> 01:01:41,939
[SPEAKER_08]: So Peter, you're now saying 0.5.

590
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:51,486
[SPEAKER_08]: And to be clear, can the city clarify what the actual.

591
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:56,562
[SPEAKER_08]: parking minimums around other transit areas in Medford?

592
01:01:59,944 --> 01:02:12,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Within a half mile of high transit is what we're defining, which also can include buses if they have the headway that's tight enough, is 0.8 for market rate units.

593
01:02:15,207 --> 01:02:23,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, citywide, it's 1.5 minimum for market rate unit, if it's not within transit.

594
01:02:24,051 --> 01:02:27,233
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's 0.5 for affordable units anywhere in the city.

595
01:02:28,694 --> 01:02:30,154
[SPEAKER_06]: 0.5 for anywhere, okay.

596
01:02:30,715 --> 01:02:33,056
[SPEAKER_06]: So 0.8 would be the minimum here.

597
01:02:35,817 --> 01:02:37,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, per the ordinance.

598
01:02:38,698 --> 01:02:43,861
[SPEAKER_06]: But the difference is the maximum, we don't currently have parking maximums for residential.

599
01:02:45,697 --> 01:02:48,099
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is one difference.

600
01:02:54,022 --> 01:03:02,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I can go with either the 0.8 or 0.5 for minimums, but I'm definitely, my vote is for the 1.2 for maximum.

601
01:03:02,688 --> 01:03:11,734
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess we just have to come back to agreement because as of right now, we only have Ari and Peter that are saying 0.5 for minimums.

602
01:03:11,774 --> 01:03:12,894
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have to get that clear.

603
01:03:14,178 --> 01:03:17,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we do the straw poll kind of by individual again?

604
01:03:17,579 --> 01:03:26,960
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if Sharad is now perhaps considering voting for some of these given additional context of why this is the situation.

605
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:34,982
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't speak for him, but I think it is worth getting another temperature read given the number of discussions that have happened.

606
01:03:35,542 --> 01:03:37,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes, Nate.

607
01:03:38,422 --> 01:03:43,063
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, just to answer for myself, I'm still in a no, so you can just count me out of this discussion.

608
01:03:45,048 --> 01:03:51,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, based on what he's already shared with us, I deduce that.

609
01:03:52,010 --> 01:03:58,891
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Ari for minimum?

610
01:03:59,431 --> 01:04:01,712
[SPEAKER_02]: 0.5 minimum, 1.2 maximum.

611
01:04:02,152 --> 01:04:06,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give them the chance to have lower minimum parking by right.

612
01:04:10,794 --> 01:04:11,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Sally Akiki?

613
01:04:13,146 --> 01:04:30,132
[SPEAKER_09]: I personally don't think Metford is at the stage where the public transportation is elaborate enough for the people to just drop the car and use the public transportation, even though we would like at some point to be at that point.

614
01:04:30,192 --> 01:04:31,153
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm at 0.8 and 1.5.

615
01:04:31,193 --> 01:04:31,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

616
01:04:31,393 --> 01:04:31,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Peter?

617
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:59,202
[SPEAKER_05]: I would sit at the 0.5 and 1.2, although as you have said, I'm not as concerned about the minimum as I am about the 1.2 maximum.

618
01:04:59,222 --> 01:05:03,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Sam?

619
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm just feeling really confused.

620
01:05:07,933 --> 01:05:13,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like I'm amenable to the minimum and the maximum.

621
01:05:13,261 --> 01:05:15,203
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want it to be passed.

622
01:05:15,564 --> 01:05:17,827
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am amenable to either.

623
01:05:25,176 --> 01:05:29,319
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I'm the same for me for the minimums, either 0.8 to 0.5.

624
01:05:29,819 --> 01:05:41,707
[SPEAKER_08]: And I definitely hear that, especially myself taking MBTA from where I sit, we're not at a point where Medford can just start dropping parking spaces.

625
01:05:41,747 --> 01:05:47,330
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, even though I think I'm less than, I'm a little bit over half a mile, but

626
01:05:48,982 --> 01:05:51,463
[SPEAKER_08]: even I can get to Wellington station easily.

627
01:05:51,923 --> 01:06:05,327
[SPEAKER_08]: So the fact that this is like right there in the Wellington station area, that's not one of my biggest concerns, and I will stand by my 1.2 for maximum, but I can be swayed for 0.8, 0.5 for minimum.

628
01:06:07,047 --> 01:06:15,710
[SPEAKER_08]: So looking at that overall, if I was to change to 0.5 to keep it, it would be Peter, myself and Ari,

629
01:06:18,635 --> 01:06:23,476
[SPEAKER_08]: have the same numbers as does PAM, so that's four.

630
01:06:24,296 --> 01:06:29,177
[SPEAKER_08]: That's voting for 0.5 minimum, 1.2 maximum to get it passed.

631
01:06:35,818 --> 01:06:39,759
[SPEAKER_08]: So in that case, we would be amending because it came in at 0.8.

632
01:06:40,979 --> 01:06:46,740
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're looking for a motion to recommend to city council that they approve the Wellington Station Multifamily Overlay District

633
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:48,998
[SPEAKER_08]: with the amendments for 0.5.

634
01:06:49,678 --> 01:06:58,684
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 0.5 minimum parking and 1.2 maximum.

635
01:07:00,145 --> 01:07:03,708
[SPEAKER_08]: And then add the Y to the use table.

636
01:07:09,852 --> 01:07:10,292
[SPEAKER_05]: So moved.

637
01:07:14,054 --> 01:07:14,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a second?

638
01:07:17,573 --> 01:07:17,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

639
01:07:20,355 --> 01:07:23,237
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll do a roll call with.

640
01:07:25,158 --> 01:07:26,219
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have Peter Cowles.

641
01:07:27,339 --> 01:07:27,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

642
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Ari Fishman.

643
01:07:30,541 --> 01:07:30,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

644
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:32,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Pam Marionski.

645
01:07:33,423 --> 01:07:33,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

646
01:07:34,624 --> 01:07:35,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Sally Akiki.

647
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:37,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

648
01:07:38,444 --> 01:07:43,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm a yes, and we have one no, which is Sharad.

649
01:07:43,870 --> 01:07:44,891
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't get your no.

650
01:07:44,931 --> 01:07:48,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we've heard your no, Sharad, but I should have called you.

651
01:07:49,155 --> 01:07:49,475
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a no.

652
01:07:49,495 --> 01:07:49,635
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

653
01:07:50,216 --> 01:07:52,298
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

654
01:07:52,358 --> 01:07:55,862
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have five yeses for the recommendation to city council.

655
01:08:06,743 --> 01:08:10,486
[SPEAKER_06]: And can you just repeat the motion back it was.

656
01:08:13,429 --> 01:08:27,100
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have a motion to recommend to city council that they approved the Wellington station multifamily overlay district with the amendments to from 0.8 spaces from 0.5 spaces per dwelling to 0.8.

657
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:27,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's 0.8.

658
01:08:37,591 --> 01:08:39,573
[SPEAKER_08]: From 0.8 to 0.5, Jackie.

659
01:08:39,813 --> 01:08:40,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

660
01:08:41,395 --> 01:08:43,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you go from 0.5 to 0.8?

661
01:08:43,517 --> 01:08:44,278
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not keeping it.

662
01:08:44,338 --> 01:08:44,898
[SPEAKER_08]: We're changing it.

663
01:08:44,918 --> 01:08:45,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

664
01:08:45,559 --> 01:08:46,039
[SPEAKER_05]: So the 0.5.

665
01:08:48,262 --> 01:08:50,944
[SPEAKER_08]: We're amending it from 0.8 to 0.5.

666
01:08:51,125 --> 01:08:51,285
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

667
01:08:52,146 --> 01:08:55,048
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got 0.8 on the brain.

668
01:08:55,649 --> 01:08:56,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

669
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:59,873
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we're also amending the maximum from 1.5 to 1.2.

670
01:09:03,207 --> 01:09:05,752
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we're adding a yes to the use table where it needs to be.

671
01:09:06,252 --> 01:09:08,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I have to spell that out?

672
01:09:08,657 --> 01:09:11,181
[SPEAKER_08]: That's based on my table.

673
01:09:11,361 --> 01:09:17,251
[SPEAKER_08]: It's number 7 for non-commercial greenhouse to shed or similar accessory structure.

674
01:09:35,745 --> 01:09:38,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that a sufficient motion or recommendation?

675
01:09:38,566 --> 01:09:39,427
[SPEAKER_06]: And you guys took your vote.

676
01:09:40,647 --> 01:09:45,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we have five yeses and one abstention.

677
01:09:49,131 --> 01:09:52,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, because I got to turn around something for city council tomorrow.

678
01:09:53,453 --> 01:09:54,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Tomorrow, okay.

679
01:09:56,855 --> 01:10:02,177
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have the next item on the agenda is approval of minutes, but we have none.

680
01:10:04,312 --> 01:10:09,420
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll go to the next item, which is miscellaneous and other updates.

681
01:10:13,127 --> 01:10:18,315
[SPEAKER_10]: So Madam Chair, we have a housing planner that will start January 2nd.

682
01:10:19,912 --> 01:10:20,853
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's very exciting.

683
01:10:21,873 --> 01:10:30,500
[SPEAKER_10]: And our office has been interviewing for economic development planner and we will be interviewing economic development director candidate this week.

684
01:10:31,521 --> 01:10:32,902
[SPEAKER_10]: We are very hopeful.

685
01:10:33,962 --> 01:10:39,527
[SPEAKER_10]: We've actually, we've recommended one of the planners for the like a second round formality interview.

686
01:10:39,587 --> 01:10:43,249
[SPEAKER_10]: We were hoping that she will accept that she'll be given an offer next week.

687
01:10:43,269 --> 01:10:47,833
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to give you an update on those.

688
01:10:49,255 --> 01:10:56,038
[SPEAKER_10]: And as I was saying, we got two proposals back on the RFP for a zoning consultant.

689
01:10:56,838 --> 01:10:59,159
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was for a request for proposals.

690
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:07,303
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's based on grading, scoring, preferences, and then we can price negotiate.

691
01:11:09,604 --> 01:11:11,365
[SPEAKER_10]: So we expect that to go forward.

692
01:11:12,297 --> 01:11:21,304
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's been a really long time since we shared the zoning RFP that was put out, because it was originally put out in June.

693
01:11:22,485 --> 01:11:24,446
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we had to re-put it out in October.

694
01:11:24,466 --> 01:11:27,608
[SPEAKER_10]: It was actually, I think, originally put out in May to the first week of July.

695
01:11:28,169 --> 01:11:31,271
[SPEAKER_10]: And we called consultants and said, why didn't you submit?

696
01:11:31,331 --> 01:11:33,753
[SPEAKER_10]: And they all said the timing was horrible for us.

697
01:11:33,833 --> 01:11:39,337
[SPEAKER_10]: The end of the fiscal year was just not a good time to prepare a proposal.

698
01:11:40,703 --> 01:11:43,645
[SPEAKER_10]: So we got two proposals back when we did it this time.

699
01:11:44,806 --> 01:11:46,707
[SPEAKER_10]: We really like the consultants.

700
01:11:47,988 --> 01:11:58,495
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe that we'll be moving forward and being able to negotiate something and have somebody hired by the beginning of the new year to do a zoning project for the city.

701
01:11:58,515 --> 01:12:02,458
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to share the RFQ with you because it talks about doing

702
01:12:03,974 --> 01:12:14,231
[SPEAKER_10]: a first phase that is more cleanup of smaller things that are easy to bite off and chew and just get done, fixes, etc.

703
01:12:15,252 --> 01:12:16,915
[SPEAKER_10]: And then to really

704
01:12:17,692 --> 01:12:31,484
[SPEAKER_10]: dig into what the comprehensive plan recommended and start to align our zoning more with what we want, and in some cases, what we see in the city, and in some cases, what we'd like to see in the city.

705
01:12:32,125 --> 01:12:40,673
[SPEAKER_10]: And we are anticipating that to be an 18-month project that this board will hear more about and be involved.

706
01:12:40,753 --> 01:12:42,775
[SPEAKER_10]: And at the level that you all want to be involved,

707
01:12:44,035 --> 01:12:44,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Let us know.

708
01:12:44,716 --> 01:12:46,977
[SPEAKER_10]: There would, of course, be report backs to you all.

709
01:12:48,798 --> 01:12:54,642
[SPEAKER_10]: We're still on the fence whether we have like a steering committee for this or we just work with the consultants.

710
01:12:55,182 --> 01:13:08,930
[SPEAKER_10]: If there was one or two members of this board that wanted to be very actively involved in the project, we could put together a steering committee with like two city counselors and two members of the city board and staff.

711
01:13:09,490 --> 01:13:13,733
[SPEAKER_10]: to do it, or we could just manage consultants and move forward.

712
01:13:14,373 --> 01:13:23,859
[SPEAKER_10]: So if people want to mull that over and think about that, and we can discuss it further, because we wouldn't even start until January.

713
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:28,152
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sort of letting you all know, but it's coming.

714
01:13:28,612 --> 01:13:39,859
[SPEAKER_10]: And if there's zoning change that you really want to see in the city of Medford, this is this time to start thinking about that and putting together a list because, you know, those are the things that will attack first.

715
01:13:40,019 --> 01:13:40,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Danielle has a list.

716
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:41,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

717
01:13:42,461 --> 01:13:43,862
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd be happy to see the list.

718
01:13:43,942 --> 01:13:45,903
[SPEAKER_10]: I mentioned this to the ZBA chair.

719
01:13:46,484 --> 01:13:47,765
[SPEAKER_10]: What is the low hanging fruit?

720
01:13:47,865 --> 01:13:51,047
[SPEAKER_10]: What are the zoning requests that he's tired of seeing come in front of him?

721
01:13:51,487 --> 01:13:55,590
[SPEAKER_10]: And he has to figure out because it doesn't make sense that people have to bring in front of him.

722
01:13:55,610 --> 01:13:59,233
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, so we'd love to hear from you as well.

723
01:14:00,014 --> 01:14:00,234
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

724
01:14:01,295 --> 01:14:02,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the steering committee idea.

725
01:14:07,678 --> 01:14:12,904
[SPEAKER_05]: As a potential member of the steering committee, I like the steering committee idea.

726
01:14:13,084 --> 01:14:15,647
[SPEAKER_05]: As a consultant, it sounds like a nightmare.

727
01:14:15,867 --> 01:14:17,329
[SPEAKER_05]: But we can figure that out.

728
01:14:17,349 --> 01:14:25,859
[SPEAKER_06]: I imagine these would probably be daytime meetings, right?

729
01:14:27,488 --> 01:14:35,441
[SPEAKER_10]: It would kind of we can add more evening meetings to our staff load because we're just so overloaded with nighttime meetings.

730
01:14:35,902 --> 01:14:37,785
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how we could possibly schedule them.

731
01:14:38,686 --> 01:14:40,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but, uh.

732
01:14:42,288 --> 01:14:50,417
[SPEAKER_10]: My only very straight, it has to be under quorum for any of the, either the CD board or the city council, right?

733
01:14:50,758 --> 01:14:55,603
[SPEAKER_10]: We cannot turn them into like public meetings, publicly noticed public posting.

734
01:14:56,083 --> 01:14:58,887
[SPEAKER_10]: So it has to be fewer than quorum of either body.

735
01:15:01,469 --> 01:15:03,371
[SPEAKER_10]: It would just, it would bog down the project.

736
01:15:04,318 --> 01:15:12,303
[SPEAKER_10]: interminably, if we if every steering committee meeting had to be a publicly posted meeting, rather than just a group of people working on a on the project.

737
01:15:16,045 --> 01:15:19,687
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're looking to get like members of the community as well for the steering committee?

738
01:15:20,207 --> 01:15:30,273
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we're going to do outreach, we're going to connect with people, we're going to do interviews, this is sort of like the directing the consultants, the managing the project piece of it.

739
01:15:30,814 --> 01:15:31,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

740
01:15:31,852 --> 01:15:36,653
[SPEAKER_10]: So the city council wants to be very, very involved in, like, which area are we going to look at first?

741
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:38,234
[SPEAKER_10]: What are the hot topics?

742
01:15:38,694 --> 01:15:40,274
[SPEAKER_10]: How are we going to reach out to people?

743
01:15:40,454 --> 01:15:41,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we going to do flyers?

744
01:15:41,595 --> 01:15:42,835
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we going to do robocalls?

745
01:15:42,875 --> 01:15:44,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, what's the newsletter going to say, right?

746
01:15:44,856 --> 01:15:46,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, this is the meat of it.

747
01:15:47,156 --> 01:15:49,397
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of it, consultants can make recommendations.

748
01:15:49,457 --> 01:15:54,098
[SPEAKER_10]: But then, like, what do we actually want to have happen in Medford?

749
01:15:57,979 --> 01:16:00,740
[SPEAKER_10]: And we kind of want to do everything all at once.

750
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:04,291
[SPEAKER_10]: But you can't, right?

751
01:16:04,591 --> 01:16:08,533
[SPEAKER_10]: You kind of have to be like, OK, this week, let's talk about boundaries.

752
01:16:08,673 --> 01:16:10,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Next week, let's talk about setbacks.

753
01:16:11,394 --> 01:16:12,555
[SPEAKER_10]: And we need to get them out.

754
01:16:12,575 --> 01:16:14,355
[SPEAKER_10]: What are we putting in front of the public?

755
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:25,801
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it would be best if I send you all the RFP and the proposals that we received so that you could see this was the scope.

756
01:16:26,681 --> 01:16:27,682
[SPEAKER_10]: These are the proposals.

757
01:16:28,942 --> 01:16:30,583
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be easier than me trying to explain it.

758
01:16:34,124 --> 01:16:49,407
[SPEAKER_08]: So the role in zoning with the comprehensive plan, I'm trying to see how will this, because zoning is the land use like laws that inform the comprehensive plan that we just did with the steering committee, which I love being on.

759
01:16:49,747 --> 01:16:52,108
[SPEAKER_08]: So how will that change the comprehensive plan going forward?

760
01:16:52,128 --> 01:16:53,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Will it, it's going to have a huge.

761
01:16:54,908 --> 01:16:56,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the other way around.

762
01:16:58,525 --> 01:16:58,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

763
01:16:58,965 --> 01:17:03,767
[SPEAKER_10]: The comprehensive plan informs what the zoning should be.

764
01:17:03,887 --> 01:17:07,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

765
01:17:07,828 --> 01:17:12,290
[SPEAKER_08]: So you need the zoning changes to actually implement the comprehensive plan as visioned?

766
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:14,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

767
01:17:14,511 --> 01:17:16,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now we're working with a mismatch.

768
01:17:20,593 --> 01:17:24,094
[SPEAKER_10]: And in fact, I was just sort of thumbing through this.

769
01:17:27,522 --> 01:17:39,229
[SPEAKER_10]: So the consultant that the council this evening said that they would like to see us move forward with is actually was the project manager to on the writing of our comprehensive plan.

770
01:17:39,609 --> 01:17:41,810
[SPEAKER_10]: And she was one of the authors of the comprehensive plan.

771
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:44,191
[SPEAKER_10]: She's actually done a lot of outreach.

772
01:17:44,211 --> 01:17:50,955
[SPEAKER_10]: She's met with this committee, she's met with the council, she's met with the public, but we would continue to do more of that.

773
01:17:53,717 --> 01:18:02,824
[SPEAKER_10]: But there are certainly some minor changes that are clearly dictated by what was in the comprehensive plan that don't need aggressive public outrage.

774
01:18:02,884 --> 01:18:04,585
[SPEAKER_10]: They already had public input.

775
01:18:05,205 --> 01:18:10,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we just actually need to change the rules to match the recommendations.

776
01:18:13,654 --> 01:18:32,460
[SPEAKER_10]: So for example, this has a project that some of the plan here is a project kickoff to have monthly meetings with city council, meetings with the city or monthly meetings with the staff, meetings with the city council throughout updates to the CD board, a couple of public workshops.

777
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:42,988
[SPEAKER_10]: potentially meeting with the steering committee, stakeholder interviews, and then they would start to refine the regulations.

778
01:18:43,469 --> 01:18:59,162
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of the things that, you know, the fact that in Medford, all the zoning, like if you have a commercial building, the setback is the same no matter where in the city you are, based on the type of building you have, or like a residential.

779
01:18:59,822 --> 01:19:06,027
[SPEAKER_10]: whereas or it's based on the height and length of the building and not the zone that it is in, right?

780
01:19:06,287 --> 01:19:14,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Typical zoning, you have this zone has 15 foot setbacks and that zone has zero lot line setbacks, right?

781
01:19:15,053 --> 01:19:20,777
[SPEAKER_10]: And this zone has maybe 30 foot front yards, but that's not how it is in Medford.

782
01:19:21,458 --> 01:19:27,122
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're a single family house anywhere in the city of Medford in any zone, you have a 15 foot front yard setback.

783
01:19:31,069 --> 01:19:39,113
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you're a residential building, your setback is height times length divided by 15, divided by something.

784
01:19:40,934 --> 01:19:43,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I don't know all of the zoning off the top of my head.

785
01:19:44,095 --> 01:19:57,762
[SPEAKER_06]: And then like the open space and the usable open space is a function of how many units there are, not if the open space is meaningful or it's really, it doesn't make for

786
01:20:01,312 --> 01:20:02,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

787
01:20:03,894 --> 01:20:08,216
[SPEAKER_06]: You just get a jumbled mess, and it's not cohesive.

788
01:20:09,997 --> 01:20:12,119
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have cohesive street fronts.

789
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:16,421
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't realize we had so many regulatory changes.

790
01:20:16,481 --> 01:20:22,905
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I was so romanticized by the idea of having a collaborative vision of the community that I didn't realize.

791
01:20:22,945 --> 01:20:24,886
[SPEAKER_08]: And now we have to work backwards to make it happen.

792
01:20:25,787 --> 01:20:30,710
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I knew we had to, because obviously, being part of it, there were some things that just doesn't exist.

793
01:20:32,223 --> 01:20:37,266
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't realize now we got to actually change the rules to match the plan.

794
01:20:38,006 --> 01:20:48,692
[SPEAKER_10]: I have an example of zoning change that I've been using a lot that is sort of intuitively obvious to almost everybody.

795
01:20:49,872 --> 01:20:54,776
[SPEAKER_10]: So Salem Street is the road that runs from Medford Square to Haines Square, right?

796
01:20:54,816 --> 01:21:01,421
[SPEAKER_10]: From Medford Square through that rotary, from City Hall through the rotary, out to what I like to call Baby Target.

797
01:21:01,881 --> 01:21:02,762
[SPEAKER_10]: That's Salem Street.

798
01:21:04,143 --> 01:21:09,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Haines Square allows commercial development and Medford Square does.

799
01:21:10,075 --> 01:21:21,184
[SPEAKER_10]: But most of that length of that street actually commercial and industrial, but commercial is not allowed as of right or even by special permit along the length of it.

800
01:21:21,264 --> 01:21:22,685
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an apartment zone.

801
01:21:23,845 --> 01:21:34,794
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you say to yourself, but Alicia, it's almost all first floor commercial with some residential and then a couple of other residential buildings sprinkled through.

802
01:21:34,814 --> 01:21:36,715
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll say, exactly.

803
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:45,061
[SPEAKER_10]: That is a case where do we actually really need to go out and talk to people about, should this be commercial first floor with apartments above?

804
01:21:45,942 --> 01:21:46,463
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no.

805
01:21:46,583 --> 01:21:47,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody gets it.

806
01:21:47,423 --> 01:21:48,224
[SPEAKER_10]: They like it.

807
01:21:48,344 --> 01:21:49,545
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a good corridor.

808
01:21:49,765 --> 01:21:50,506
[SPEAKER_10]: It works.

809
01:21:51,106 --> 01:21:59,172
[SPEAKER_10]: The only question in my mind is how high should it be two or three stories of apartments allowed over that first floor commercial?

810
01:21:59,553 --> 01:22:04,316
[SPEAKER_10]: And should first floor commercial actually be required as opposed to just optional?

811
01:22:04,356 --> 01:22:06,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are the things we need to work through.

812
01:22:06,718 --> 01:22:17,921
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's actually a really excellent example of where Medford has built what Medford would like and it works, but actually it's completely not in compliance with our zoning.

813
01:22:22,222 --> 01:22:30,464
[SPEAKER_10]: There are other places like West Medford where we actually need some more study to better understand what zoning would make sense.

814
01:22:33,677 --> 01:22:41,081
[SPEAKER_10]: There are a couple of questions that have been floated around, like, should we allow two-family houses throughout the entire city?

815
01:22:41,621 --> 01:22:55,329
[SPEAKER_10]: They're actually not allowed in any of the single-family districts, which is a good, at least off the top of my head without looking at a map, one-third of the city is single-family zone, right?

816
01:22:55,389 --> 01:22:57,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, let's talk about that.

817
01:23:02,958 --> 01:23:04,801
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's what's in store for 2024.

818
01:23:04,861 --> 01:23:05,602
[SPEAKER_10]: How's that?

819
01:23:05,902 --> 01:23:11,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

820
01:23:12,753 --> 01:23:13,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Alicia.

821
01:23:15,631 --> 01:23:17,772
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is one of the longest shortest meetings ever.

822
01:23:17,892 --> 01:23:21,154
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to ask for a motion to adjourn.

823
01:23:21,595 --> 01:23:23,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I make one mild suggestion?

824
01:23:23,996 --> 01:23:24,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

825
01:23:24,596 --> 01:23:25,777
[SPEAKER_10]: This could be done offline.

826
01:23:26,217 --> 01:23:29,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Think about whether this group would like to get together in person like for drinks or something.

827
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:34,683
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of our boards and commissions at this time of year will do something like that.

828
01:23:34,783 --> 01:23:39,586
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just a nice way to like actually put people together with with boxes on the screen.

829
01:23:40,426 --> 01:23:41,887
[SPEAKER_10]: But you don't have to decide that right now.

830
01:23:41,927 --> 01:23:42,988
[SPEAKER_10]: That was totally out of the blue.

831
01:23:43,008 --> 01:23:43,468
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

832
01:23:45,868 --> 01:23:50,431
[SPEAKER_08]: And as long as we don't talk about anything on the agenda that's coming up or has passed, we're good, right?

833
01:23:52,493 --> 01:23:58,758
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know who would initiate that, like, just send you an email and say, hey, this will be awesome.

834
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:08,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think that if people are interested, we can try and help coordinate.

835
01:24:08,525 --> 01:24:09,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't we take that offline?

836
01:24:10,367 --> 01:24:12,969
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the meantime, I'll make a motion to adjourn.

837
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:14,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded.

838
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:18,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, wait a minute, let's back up for the record.

839
01:24:18,572 --> 01:24:20,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Robert's Rules, motion to adjourn.

840
01:24:21,114 --> 01:24:24,957
[SPEAKER_08]: It has to be through the chair, Vice Chair Emily Henneman.

841
01:24:27,178 --> 01:24:28,800
