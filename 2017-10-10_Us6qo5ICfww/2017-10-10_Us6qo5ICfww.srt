17, 696,

82
00:07:48,869 --> 00:08:10,380

83
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,102
[SPEAKER_17]: The balance of free cash before this vote is $7 million.

84
00:08:15,384 --> 00:08:23,832
[SPEAKER_17]: $823,993.

85
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:23,832
[SPEAKER_17]: The revised free cash as of 6-30-17 has not been certified by the state at the time.

86
00:08:24,573 --> 00:08:31,419
[SPEAKER_17]: City Commissioner John Bavuso is here to present and answer any of the Council's questions regarding this matter.

87
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:33,922
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Bavuso.

88
00:08:37,145 --> 00:08:38,666
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

89
00:08:39,226 --> 00:08:40,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

90
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:43,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Ravuto, for coming to explain this.

91
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:48,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe just a little more detail about what type of cameras, how many we're purchasing, what they're going to do.

92
00:08:48,132 --> 00:08:49,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little more detail.

93
00:08:49,653 --> 00:08:50,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

94
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:57,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Three high quality commercial grade infrared night vision cameras that are what they call quick deploy.

95
00:08:58,257 --> 00:09:00,838
[SPEAKER_07]: It means that we can set them up and move them very simply.

96
00:09:01,298 --> 00:09:02,278
[SPEAKER_07]: They're self-contained.

97
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:03,239
[SPEAKER_07]: They come with a router.

98
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:05,480
[SPEAKER_07]: They transmit to our cellular data network.

99
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,342
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll be monitored at the police station, and hopefully we'll get a receiver at City Hall in the near future.

100
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:15,564
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you could, what's the reasoning for getting the cameras?

101
00:09:15,965 --> 00:09:17,747
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we going to be doing with them?

102
00:09:18,388 --> 00:09:19,410
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to monitor.

103
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,595
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a lot of dumping sites throughout the city that happens.

104
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:23,937
[SPEAKER_07]: We have some favorite sites that go in.

105
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,821
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had a few problems downtown recently with

106
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:30,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, small thievery, petty stuff.

107
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:35,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Some elderly people have been slightly harassed by the people hanging out in the square.

108
00:09:35,714 --> 00:09:37,315
[SPEAKER_07]: So we hope that they have the cameras.

109
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:44,038
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be able to let us see anybody caught in the act of bothering somebody or stealing anything, any criminal activity.

110
00:09:44,658 --> 00:09:48,860
[SPEAKER_03]: So there'll be portable and we'll be able, you'll be able to move them around and that's correct.

111
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

112
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:50,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

113
00:09:52,721 --> 00:09:53,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knife.

114
00:09:54,182 --> 00:09:56,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much, Mr. Babuso.

115
00:09:56,103 --> 00:09:57,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for that presentation.

116
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:05,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Ultimately, Mr. President, this council has requested the purchase of portable security cameras for the purpose of code enforcement on numerous occasions in the past.

117
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we have an opportunity to appropriate the funding to make that a reality and move approval.

118
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:10,599
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

119
00:10:11,099 --> 00:10:12,039
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Marks.

120
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,220
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

121
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:23,583
[SPEAKER_16]: As Councilman Knight just mentioned, this has been a request of this council for the past several years, and I would hope that, I know these are portable,

122
00:10:24,193 --> 00:10:32,680
[SPEAKER_16]: But I would hope that one of the first stops will be Commercial Street and the dumping that has taken place on Commercial Street over the years.

123
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,702
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would hope that would be one of the first stops.

124
00:10:36,222 --> 00:10:38,004
[SPEAKER_07]: It is absolutely high on the list.

125
00:10:38,624 --> 00:10:39,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it is.

126
00:10:39,645 --> 00:10:52,295
[SPEAKER_16]: That area is notorious for all sorts of garbage refrigerators, you name it, sofas, everything shows up on that street because it's poorly lit at night and there's not much traffic there at all.

127
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,681
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a constant problem.

128
00:10:56,001 --> 00:10:59,422
[SPEAKER_16]: I support this wholeheartedly, Mr. President.

129
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:00,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

130
00:11:00,882 --> 00:11:03,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I follow my colleagues in this endeavor.

131
00:11:03,483 --> 00:11:11,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that what we'll get back in fines and penalties would be tenfold, and I think it would be automatically.

132
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:18,348
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate your work in making this come to fruition, and I support this wholeheartedly.

133
00:11:18,408 --> 00:11:18,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

134
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:19,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor.

135
00:11:19,978 --> 00:11:21,279
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe this is just a start.

136
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:25,541
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that what we're going to get from these three cameras is going to show us how valuable they are.

137
00:11:25,761 --> 00:11:26,261
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

138
00:11:26,502 --> 00:11:26,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

139
00:11:27,502 --> 00:11:28,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco.

140
00:11:28,362 --> 00:11:29,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

141
00:11:29,763 --> 00:11:32,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Bavuzzo, thank you very much for your report as well.

142
00:11:32,745 --> 00:11:36,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I, this is something I support a hundred percent.

143
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:40,308
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, we've needed this for a long time and I know this council has talked about this repeatedly.

144
00:11:40,828 --> 00:11:41,949
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I just have a quick question.

145
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:45,831
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as the cameras go, I mean, how many, we're starting off with three.

146
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,912
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, ideally do you think we could use more?

147
00:11:49,002 --> 00:11:52,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Ideally could and then these are high-quality camera.

148
00:11:52,264 --> 00:12:02,090
[SPEAKER_07]: They are about $3,000 a little more than $3,000 each So we'd like to get the cameras and use make sure they're working up to our expectations Begin collecting some money back for them.

149
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:11,976
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, great And as far as um, you know, it's fine just thinking as far as the future goes and from a budgeting perspective Do you know what the life expectancy is for one of these cameras, especially if they're outside?

150
00:12:12,036 --> 00:12:15,358
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I'm just you know, is this something they have to purchase on a pretty regular basis?

151
00:12:15,378 --> 00:12:15,398
[SPEAKER_11]: I

152
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,661
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what the life expectancy is.

153
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:22,903
[SPEAKER_07]: A company that we're contracted to does all the maintenance and warranty work on them.

154
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:28,426
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, it's a high quality commercial grade camera that used throughout the city of Boston, the city of Somerville.

155
00:12:28,986 --> 00:12:30,247
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have looked at that.

156
00:12:30,407 --> 00:12:34,709
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what the life period is, but they're made for exposure to the elements.

157
00:12:34,969 --> 00:12:35,169
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

158
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:35,669
[SPEAKER_11]: It's okay.

159
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:37,530
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, uh, this is, I think a great initiative.

160
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,631
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad to see that we're moving forward with it and move approval.

161
00:12:40,872 --> 00:12:41,192
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

162
00:12:42,332 --> 00:12:43,253
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Dello Russo.

163
00:12:43,553 --> 00:12:43,873
[SPEAKER_18]: Second.

164
00:12:48,454 --> 00:12:49,254
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

165
00:12:50,775 --> 00:12:52,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one quick question.

166
00:12:52,115 --> 00:12:56,256
[SPEAKER_03]: You said there's going to be a router and the video will come up at the police station?

167
00:12:56,516 --> 00:12:56,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

168
00:12:57,037 --> 00:13:05,559
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you find out there was dumping, then your office building department would go to the police station to review the footage?

169
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:06,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

170
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:06,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

171
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,520
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how it's going to work.

172
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,441
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to have somebody sitting there and reviewing hours long data.

173
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:13,742
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going to be if something happened, then we'll know.

174
00:13:15,364 --> 00:13:18,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly, it'll be recorded so we can back up the time frame and see who was there.

175
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Figured, but I just want to be clear.

176
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:21,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

177
00:13:23,247 --> 00:13:28,289
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

178
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,029
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

179
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:30,750
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

180
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,111
[SPEAKER_17]: Excuse me, roll call vote is requested, is required.

181
00:13:34,131 --> 00:13:36,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Dello Russo?

182
00:13:37,012 --> 00:13:37,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

183
00:13:37,672 --> 00:13:38,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Falco?

184
00:13:38,413 --> 00:13:38,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

185
00:13:39,213 --> 00:13:39,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight?

186
00:13:39,813 --> 00:13:40,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

187
00:13:40,473 --> 00:13:41,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lungo-Koehnan?

188
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:41,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

189
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:42,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Marks?

190
00:13:42,894 --> 00:13:43,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

191
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:44,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scott Deli?

192
00:13:44,175 --> 00:13:44,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

193
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:49,180
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

194
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,581
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

195
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:51,121
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

196
00:13:51,361 --> 00:13:54,123
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

197
00:13:54,143 --> 00:13:57,084
[SPEAKER_17]: 17 699 dear President Caraviello and members of the city council.

198
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:07,710
[SPEAKER_17]: I respectfully request that the council endorse an approval of food trucks for the Brooks PTO fundraiser that will be held at the Brooks Elementary School on October 22, 2017.

199
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,631
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for your consideration.

200
00:14:09,651 --> 00:14:10,671
[SPEAKER_17]: Stephanie and Bergman.

201
00:14:15,853 --> 00:14:16,773
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Dello Russo?

202
00:14:16,993 --> 00:14:17,614
[SPEAKER_17]: Move approval.

203
00:14:18,374 --> 00:14:21,495
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

204
00:14:21,555 --> 00:14:22,155
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

205
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,755
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

206
00:14:23,815 --> 00:14:29,937
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to revert back to regular business by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Falco.

207
00:14:29,957 --> 00:14:30,617
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

208
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:38,539
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

209
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:44,121
[SPEAKER_17]: 17-684 offered by Councilor Knight being resolved that the Medford City Council request that the administration

210
00:14:44,692 --> 00:14:53,395
[SPEAKER_17]: expand upon its Adopt-a-Site program to include the grass islands extending from South Border Road to Lawrence Road.

211
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:54,595
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

212
00:14:55,235 --> 00:14:56,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

213
00:14:57,176 --> 00:15:01,958
[SPEAKER_08]: As we've seen throughout the community, the Adopt-a-Site program has been very successful in certain locations.

214
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:05,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Along Lawrence Road and Governor's Avenue, Mr. President, if you take a look,

215
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:10,739
[SPEAKER_08]: you will see that some of the islands are adopted and some aren't.

216
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:16,702
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have one island that looks great, another island that doesn't look so great, one island that looks great, another island that doesn't look so great.

217
00:15:16,742 --> 00:15:19,023
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a little bit of inconsistency there, Mr. President.

218
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:28,208
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a very successful framework in place, and I'm asking the administration to see if they can seek volunteers to go there and adopt that site, Mr. President, so that we can beautify the neighborhood a little bit more.

219
00:15:28,508 --> 00:15:33,250
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some inconsistencies along that stretch of roadway, and I think that this will do a lot for curb appeal.

220
00:15:34,495 --> 00:15:37,736
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

221
00:15:37,756 --> 00:15:38,377
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

222
00:15:39,257 --> 00:15:41,998
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

223
00:15:42,018 --> 00:15:43,639
[SPEAKER_17]: 17-685 offered by Vice President Mox.

224
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:50,722
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it resolved that the city administration provide the council with an update on the water leak detection program.

225
00:15:50,762 --> 00:15:51,783
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Mox.

226
00:15:54,004 --> 00:15:54,984
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

227
00:15:55,004 --> 00:15:59,606
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, this is probably the third time I've offered this as a council resolution.

228
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:27,998
[SPEAKER_16]: that we receive an update on the proposal that was submitted by this administration back I think it was roughly a year ago myself and I know there were a couple other members of the City Council attended a meeting up here that talked about purchasing a device on behalf of the community that would be able to gauge where leaks are coming from.

229
00:16:28,868 --> 00:16:39,977
[SPEAKER_16]: and to have a systematic approach to replacing the water pipes where they're leaking in order to save the beleaguered ratepayers some money, Mr. President.

230
00:16:40,418 --> 00:16:50,306
[SPEAKER_16]: So I ask, my first request is to ask where we stand on the leak detection program that was proposed to this council some time back.

231
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:53,669
[SPEAKER_16]: It's also, Mr. President, to once again ask

232
00:16:56,422 --> 00:17:03,046
[SPEAKER_16]: that we take a full look at our infrastructure when it comes to water and sewer.

233
00:17:04,387 --> 00:17:11,251
[SPEAKER_16]: Just for the edification of the viewing audience, the water for 2017 this year was assessed at $6,432,219.

234
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,073
[SPEAKER_16]: That is no increase over 2016.

235
00:17:23,745 --> 00:17:26,067
[SPEAKER_16]: On the suicide for 2017, the assessment was $11,878,789.

236
00:17:26,107 --> 00:17:28,209
[SPEAKER_16]: That was an increase of $525,541, which is a 4.6% increase over 2016 on the suicide.

237
00:17:28,229 --> 00:17:31,271
[SPEAKER_16]: And the combined assessment that the rate payers in this community, every taxpayer is paying for,

238
00:17:52,401 --> 00:17:54,042
[SPEAKER_16]: is a water and sewer assessment is $18,311,008.

239
00:17:54,082 --> 00:18:00,668
[SPEAKER_16]: And of which we also add in the expense of the water and sewer division, which is $5,635,854 bringing the total budget for water and sewer for 2017 to $23,946,862.

240
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:32,667
[SPEAKER_16]: The reason why I bring this up tonight, Mr. President, as we all know, the MWRA back, I believe it was about a year ago, stated that Medford had approximately 20% for unaccounted for water in the community.

241
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:42,333
[SPEAKER_16]: And as part of unaccounted for water, that consists of leaks that are taking place, and that's why I'm calling for an update on the leak detection program.

242
00:18:43,047 --> 00:18:53,331
[SPEAKER_16]: It also takes into consideration other usage in the community that's not needed right now, which are many of our hydrants throughout the community.

243
00:18:53,851 --> 00:19:04,615
[SPEAKER_16]: And it also takes into consideration and accounted for water, the municipal and school side, Mr. President, which used to be part of their budget respectively.

244
00:19:05,095 --> 00:19:09,397
[SPEAKER_16]: So the schools would pay for a water and sewer bill depending on the water they used.

245
00:19:10,137 --> 00:19:11,758
[SPEAKER_16]: And the last figure I received,

246
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:24,057
[SPEAKER_16]: uh, and this is from 2017, I believe the school side, uh, based on a tier two system, uh, their water and sewer bill was $190,457.

247
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:32,502
[SPEAKER_16]: Now we all know that that used to be part of the school department budget and back some years ago,

248
00:19:33,312 --> 00:19:44,223
[SPEAKER_16]: They took it out of the budget and stopped considering it an operating expense and just passed it off to the ratepayers on the water and sewer side as unaccounted for.

249
00:19:44,943 --> 00:19:47,686
[SPEAKER_16]: But indeed, Mr. President, it's not unaccounted for.

250
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,087
[SPEAKER_16]: It is needed.

251
00:19:49,528 --> 00:19:51,830
[SPEAKER_16]: We know where the water's coming from.

252
00:19:52,551 --> 00:19:54,773
[SPEAKER_16]: And in my opinion, it sends out an awful message.

253
00:19:55,344 --> 00:20:13,516
[SPEAKER_16]: when we're talking about conservation and ways to better utilize our resources, when you have a school department or a municipality that really doesn't pay for the water and sewer because they pass the burden on to the rate payer, I think sends an awful message, Mr. President.

254
00:20:14,096 --> 00:20:18,899
[SPEAKER_16]: And it should be accounted for under the accounting principles within a budget.

255
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,242
[SPEAKER_16]: So according to the MWRA, 20% of our water that we take in, 20% of that

256
00:20:25,647 --> 00:20:26,548
[SPEAKER_16]: $6,432,219 is unaccounted for water.

257
00:20:26,568 --> 00:20:32,274
[SPEAKER_16]: That's roughly $1,200,000 in unaccounted for water, of which about $393,000, almost $400,000 is from the municipal and the school side.

258
00:20:45,546 --> 00:21:00,900
[SPEAKER_16]: in 800,000 of leaks that are happening under our roads, Mr. President, and things that we really need to have a leak detection program in order to cut that cost down and pass that savings onto the ratepayers.

259
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:11,990
[SPEAKER_16]: And so tonight, Mr. President, I ask that we, first of all, get an update on the leak detection program, where it stands right now.

260
00:21:12,745 --> 00:21:24,432
[SPEAKER_16]: I once again ask, and I've asked a half a dozen times, that water and sewer need to be included, Mr. President, in the operating budget of both the municipal and the school sides.

261
00:21:25,513 --> 00:21:28,094
[SPEAKER_16]: That should happen without any say.

262
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:31,777
[SPEAKER_16]: That should be an automatic, Mr. President.

263
00:21:32,217 --> 00:21:37,180
[SPEAKER_16]: If we're going to ask ratepayers to, depending on what tier they fall in,

264
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:42,765
[SPEAKER_16]: If they use less water, they can save on their bill and also conserve.

265
00:21:43,746 --> 00:21:47,888
[SPEAKER_16]: We should also be demanding the same from the municipality and from the school side.

266
00:21:48,528 --> 00:21:49,509
[SPEAKER_16]: That should be a given.

267
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:58,995
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would ask that it be included back into the operating expense for the water for the schools and for City Hall.

268
00:22:00,395 --> 00:22:01,816
[SPEAKER_16]: As part of that $400,000 I alluded to, the schools was $190,000.

269
00:22:05,812 --> 00:22:08,793
[SPEAKER_16]: The municipal buildings, about 43,000.

270
00:22:11,493 --> 00:22:13,313
[SPEAKER_16]: Irrigation, which is probably 95%.

271
00:22:13,773 --> 00:22:15,914
[SPEAKER_16]: Our parks is 152,000.

272
00:22:16,254 --> 00:22:24,335
[SPEAKER_16]: And then in our different fire stations throughout the community, a little over 6,000, Mr. President.

273
00:22:24,355 --> 00:22:28,416
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you add that up, it comes to about 393,000, almost 400,000 in water and sewer consumption that we know where it's coming from.

274
00:22:35,204 --> 00:22:38,826
[SPEAKER_16]: It's needed, and it should be part of an operating expense, Mr. President.

275
00:22:39,186 --> 00:22:52,232
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'd put that in the form of a motion that we get a response back on those questions immediately on behalf of the ratepayers of this community, Mr. President, that are paying thousands of dollars in water sewer a year.

276
00:22:52,853 --> 00:22:57,455
[SPEAKER_16]: And if there's a way we can save money through I&I inflow

277
00:23:20,163 --> 00:23:22,424
[SPEAKER_16]: in an account just for that purpose.

278
00:23:22,845 --> 00:23:27,888
[SPEAKER_16]: The water and sewer enterprise account was created for that purpose, to offset rates.

279
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:35,694
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the state legislature that created it, not myself, not this council, to offset rates and to do infrastructure improvements.

280
00:23:36,855 --> 00:23:47,863
[SPEAKER_16]: What better improvement, Mr. President, to tighten up a system that rate payers are paying millions of dollars a year for unaccounted for water and for INI, inflow and infiltration.

281
00:23:49,212 --> 00:23:50,653
[SPEAKER_16]: What better use of that money?

282
00:23:51,113 --> 00:23:53,975
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know anyone that would stand up against that, Mr. President.

283
00:23:54,295 --> 00:23:57,537
[SPEAKER_16]: Instead, that money is sitting in an account, just sitting there.

284
00:23:58,357 --> 00:24:06,182
[SPEAKER_16]: And every day that goes by is an injustice to every resident in this community that's paying a water and sewer bill, as far as I'm concerned, Mr. President.

285
00:24:06,602 --> 00:24:06,962
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

286
00:24:07,182 --> 00:24:08,223
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

287
00:24:08,923 --> 00:24:14,586
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Vice President Marks, seconded by Councilor Lockern.

288
00:24:14,626 --> 00:24:15,227
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

289
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:15,447
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

290
00:24:16,187 --> 00:24:16,948
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

291
00:24:18,474 --> 00:24:35,005
[SPEAKER_17]: 17-686 offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, be it resolved that once the free cash from last year is certified, that a portion of it be used to hire an outside company to help the Medford City Council update the City of Medford zoning laws.

292
00:24:35,845 --> 00:24:36,806
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

293
00:24:37,866 --> 00:24:39,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

294
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:46,512
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is something that we had asked for to be funded one way or another several months back.

295
00:24:47,225 --> 00:24:52,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe there was one maybe subcommittee meeting on it, but I think it's something that needs to be done.

296
00:24:52,308 --> 00:24:56,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I then asked a question of, can we work on our zoning one section at a time?

297
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:13,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we're the ones that, which update the ordinances, but we were told in a written decision that that would be spot zoning, but we are going to be approached with a number of projects coming down the line, which almost seems similar to that.

298
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,441
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's something that,

299
00:25:16,127 --> 00:25:23,132
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to have a commitment by the administration to hire an outside company to help guide us through this process.

300
00:25:23,192 --> 00:25:38,362
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're all capable of going street by street and deciding which zoning changes we should make, but to handle this, which is gonna take, from what I understand, multiple years to do.

301
00:25:38,382 --> 00:25:42,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the city of Somerville, it took a couple years to get through the process.

302
00:25:43,226 --> 00:25:45,407
[SPEAKER_03]: We need some guidance and we need some commitment

303
00:25:45,713 --> 00:25:48,675
[SPEAKER_03]: by the administration so we can move forward and get this done.

304
00:25:49,336 --> 00:25:57,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully it will be something that, you know, can be worked on once the funding is there at the beginning of the year by whoever may sit behind this rail.

305
00:25:57,842 --> 00:26:04,267
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a project that we've all spoken in favor of doing, and it's something that needs to be done.

306
00:26:04,807 --> 00:26:07,329
[SPEAKER_03]: So I ask that a portion be set aside.

307
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,252
[SPEAKER_03]: She wants us to research different companies and the costs.

308
00:26:11,832 --> 00:26:13,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure we are capable of doing that.

309
00:26:14,384 --> 00:26:22,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need a commitment first that yes, we are, the administration's willing to put money aside so that we're able to do this.

310
00:26:24,152 --> 00:26:25,633
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli.

311
00:26:25,693 --> 00:26:26,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

312
00:26:26,613 --> 00:26:30,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I thank my colleague for bringing this issue forward.

313
00:26:30,176 --> 00:26:42,566
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that this has been one of the biggest questions as we go street to street and talking to residents and asking questions about our zoning laws and our ordinances.

314
00:26:43,843 --> 00:26:52,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that months back, when we first brought this issue up, one of the biggest concerns was the amount of money that a consultant would cost.

315
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,911
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we need that consultant.

316
00:26:54,971 --> 00:26:56,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's time that we do that.

317
00:26:56,773 --> 00:27:10,623
[SPEAKER_04]: But as neighboring communities have done, something that I've mentioned here in the past, they've used the Metropolitan Planning Council, that kind of set an agenda that they could follow to look at our

318
00:27:11,285 --> 00:27:13,466
[SPEAKER_04]: our changing of zoning laws.

319
00:27:13,546 --> 00:27:36,738
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to call for a meeting with maybe possibly bring in the Metropolitan Planning Council, a subcommittee meeting or a community of the whole meeting to bring that organization into just to ask them for some guidance in what they've done with other communities that had similar issues that we have here in Medford that some of our zoning and most of our zoning haven't been looked at in over 30 years.

320
00:27:38,545 --> 00:27:50,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I second my colleague's resolve, and I'd like to make an amendment to that, if she doesn't mind, that we call for a meeting with maybe a committee of the whole meeting relatively soon.

321
00:27:50,510 --> 00:28:00,313
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's been a very difficult time for scheduling, but maybe set something up with a consultant from the Metropolitan Planning Council and ask them for some guidance.

322
00:28:01,094 --> 00:28:04,655
[SPEAKER_04]: We're already a member of the council, and

323
00:28:05,687 --> 00:28:06,887
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's free to us.

324
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:10,948
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that that might be an avenue that we could research and move forward with.

325
00:28:10,988 --> 00:28:14,209
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, I thank, thank council for bringing that forward.

326
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:15,289
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Knight.

327
00:28:15,969 --> 00:28:17,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

328
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:21,810
[SPEAKER_08]: This certainly has been a topic that's been brought up before and in previous times when the issue was brought up.

329
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:27,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I, I had a question and the question was, what are we trying to accomplish?

330
00:28:27,491 --> 00:28:30,731
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to re we want to review our zoning laws, but what is it that we want to try to accomplish?

331
00:28:31,172 --> 00:28:33,052
[SPEAKER_08]: And that started a conversation, Mr. President.

332
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:33,592
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um,

333
00:28:34,014 --> 00:28:39,538
[SPEAKER_08]: The subcommittee on zoning and ordinances has met a number of times, more than once, to discuss this very issue, Mr. President.

334
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:51,487
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the things that we've been doing is trying to develop goals and develop criteria for further debate and discussion as to what we feel is going to be important to put Medford in a position to be successful as we grow up.

335
00:28:52,581 --> 00:29:00,586
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the items that we've been discussing was the ability to ensure that we continue to generate between 1.25 and 1.5% new growth annually.

336
00:29:01,547 --> 00:29:11,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Another item that we've been looking upon, Mr. President, is the ability to expand upon commercially zoned parcels to ensure an equitable residential tax rate, an equitable shift of the residential tax burden to the commercial side.

337
00:29:12,734 --> 00:29:18,778
[SPEAKER_08]: We've also discussed the possibilities that we have to meet and exceed the state established thresholds for affordable housing.

338
00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:39,024
[SPEAKER_08]: protecting the neighborhood's integrity and the historical assets in our community, as well as a few things that we're looking into with the technical assistance from the Metropolitan Area Planning Council with the draft plan to revitalize Method Square and soon to be work on the revitalization of Mystic Avenue, Mr. President.

339
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:45,008
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are a couple of items that are in the works here, and there's been a conversation that's been ongoing on this current topic.

340
00:29:45,068 --> 00:29:47,090
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it was the desire of the subcommittee

341
00:29:47,451 --> 00:29:52,476
[SPEAKER_08]: to establish these criteria, to go through the whole entire process, and then to report the paper out to the council.

342
00:29:53,137 --> 00:29:59,022
[SPEAKER_08]: And once we have that paper ready to further debate and deliberate, we can send it to the administration and say, these are the goals we want to accomplish.

343
00:29:59,563 --> 00:30:00,664
[SPEAKER_08]: What's it going to cost to get it done?

344
00:30:01,605 --> 00:30:03,306
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's where we are in the process, Mr. President.

345
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:05,148
[SPEAKER_08]: I thank the council for putting the measure forward.

346
00:30:05,188 --> 00:30:06,049
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a good idea.

347
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:10,093
[SPEAKER_08]: We've done a lot of work on it, and we're going to continue to work on it, and we're going to continue to make this happen.

348
00:30:11,615 --> 00:30:11,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

349
00:30:12,392 --> 00:30:13,072
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco.

350
00:30:13,292 --> 00:30:14,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

351
00:30:14,133 --> 00:30:16,234
[SPEAKER_11]: And I thank council Longo for bringing this forward.

352
00:30:16,274 --> 00:30:22,457
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an important issue that impacts the quality of life of all residents throughout our city.

353
00:30:22,817 --> 00:30:28,980
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, zoning is one of the biggest responsibilities we have here on the council and zoning hasn't been looked at.

354
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,861
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's close to 50 years and it needs to be looked at.

355
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:46,348
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, and I, and I, I did offer a paper on this earlier in the term, uh, with regard to, uh, having someone, uh, come in from the outside and take a look at, and you know, that paper did get moved to subcommittee where we have been looking at it and meeting on it.

356
00:30:47,028 --> 00:30:53,192
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, you know, uh, but I do think it's important to continue the conversation to make sure that we keep it in the forefront.

357
00:30:53,252 --> 00:30:56,614
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, you know, I, I do support the resolution.

358
00:30:56,634 --> 00:31:00,656
[SPEAKER_11]: I, I, I'm not sure as far as the next step, if we already have a resolution in subcommittee,

359
00:31:01,043 --> 00:31:02,164
[SPEAKER_11]: what the next step would be.

360
00:31:02,264 --> 00:31:03,685
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I do support the resolution.

361
00:31:03,725 --> 00:31:06,026
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's, it needs to be looked at without a doubt.

362
00:31:06,787 --> 00:31:10,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but, uh, so I do, I do support, uh, both resolutions fully.

363
00:31:10,609 --> 00:31:11,830
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

364
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:12,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice president Mox.

365
00:31:13,731 --> 00:31:14,751
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

366
00:31:15,072 --> 00:31:19,935
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, you know, I, I first, let me say, I appreciate the role of the zoning subcommittee.

367
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:22,656
[SPEAKER_16]: They've done yeoman's work on this particular issue.

368
00:31:23,077 --> 00:31:30,221
[SPEAKER_16]: And as councilor Falco just alluded to, uh, this is something that really has been ignored for a lot of years in this community.

369
00:31:30,983 --> 00:31:43,869
[SPEAKER_16]: And in my opinion, it's going to merit to bring in a consultant that handles zoning on a day-to-day and can advise us on what our steps are as a community.

370
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:53,754
[SPEAKER_16]: The only thing I'd state, and I realize this is something that's in subcommittee, is I think this issue is much larger than just a paper before a subcommittee.

371
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:59,297
[SPEAKER_16]: I think this issue, Mr. President, impacts every walk of life in this community.

372
00:32:00,132 --> 00:32:03,494
[SPEAKER_16]: And as we all know, zoning is the lifeline of a community.

373
00:32:04,215 --> 00:32:17,743
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it's important while we saw in Cambridge the growth and expansion in Cambridge, we're witnessing it now in Somerville, which, you know, they probably don't have another piece of land to build on.

374
00:32:18,283 --> 00:32:19,904
[SPEAKER_16]: We're experiencing it now in the city.

375
00:32:20,284 --> 00:32:21,465
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going through it right now.

376
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:25,892
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think we have to react quicker than what we're doing.

377
00:32:26,372 --> 00:32:33,076
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's no reflection on any one particular individual or any particular body in this community, but I think we really have to react.

378
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:39,699
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it's prudent to bring in a consultant that will sit down with this council and tell us where we begin.

379
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:44,742
[SPEAKER_16]: It's great to get feedback, and that feedback can continue while this process happens.

380
00:32:45,384 --> 00:32:51,947
[SPEAKER_16]: But to sit back and wait for recommendations at this point, you know, the horse is already out of the barn.

381
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:54,288
[SPEAKER_16]: We're experiencing the growth right now.

382
00:32:54,689 --> 00:32:56,530
[SPEAKER_16]: We're attending the ZBA meetings.

383
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:10,697
[SPEAKER_16]: We're hearing residents stand up and say, I don't want that particular development in my neighborhood based on the lack of parking, based on there's no setback, based on height, based on a number of things, Mr. President, that is concerning.

384
00:33:11,821 --> 00:33:18,604
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, when you look at other communities, they're incorporated right within their zoning ordinances, car share.

385
00:33:18,944 --> 00:33:22,386
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe Cambridge and Somerville have a car share program.

386
00:33:22,706 --> 00:33:33,531
[SPEAKER_16]: So when projects come in in thickly settled areas in Cambridge, Somerville, and many other communities, it's part of their zoning that requires car share, which we refer to.

387
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:35,753
[SPEAKER_16]: as the zip cars, Mr. President.

388
00:33:36,794 --> 00:33:52,278
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, there's also solar share that's brought up, and many new initiatives now, when it comes to residential and commercial building and so forth, also calls for a solar share, as well as a car share.

389
00:33:52,698 --> 00:34:01,860
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's a lot of initiatives that we could include within our zoning ordinances to help alleviate some of the concern that we're hearing, at least I'm hearing,

390
00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:09,323
[SPEAKER_16]: from residents when I go to these meetings about the fact that these projects don't fit the very fabric of their neighborhood.

391
00:34:09,763 --> 00:34:11,103
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's incumbent upon us.

392
00:34:11,644 --> 00:34:13,745
[SPEAKER_16]: We have, I'd say, two major jobs.

393
00:34:14,345 --> 00:34:20,068
[SPEAKER_16]: One set in the city budget, or approved in the city budget, and the second one is zoning, in my opinion.

394
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:22,809
[SPEAKER_16]: They go hand in hand.

395
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:29,933
[SPEAKER_16]: And we'd be remiss if we sat back any longer while this city's gonna go through a building boom

396
00:34:30,423 --> 00:34:36,306
[SPEAKER_16]: and is experiencing right now single families turning into three, four, five units.

397
00:34:36,766 --> 00:34:38,026
[SPEAKER_16]: It's happening throughout the community.

398
00:34:38,807 --> 00:34:45,069
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, a lot that was built with a single family home, as we saw in the Lawrence estates, turns into two giant homes.

399
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:51,132
[SPEAKER_16]: These are the concerns that I hear from residents and we have to have a way as a council to say, you know what,

400
00:34:51,846 --> 00:34:52,846
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not Cambridge.

401
00:34:52,906 --> 00:34:53,666
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not Somerville.

402
00:34:54,006 --> 00:34:58,427
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to make sure whatever happens in our community is something that we can all agree upon.

403
00:34:58,787 --> 00:35:04,668
[SPEAKER_16]: And whatever new growth happens, whatever direction we go in, that it's going to be sensible for this community.

404
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:17,470
[SPEAKER_16]: And that people are going to rest assured that when they moved to this community, they moved here for a reason, because of our open space, because of our schools, because of our parks, because of all the natural resources of this community.

405
00:35:17,911 --> 00:35:20,471
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't want to lose that very fabric that I think

406
00:35:21,187 --> 00:35:22,668
[SPEAKER_16]: people move to this community for.

407
00:35:23,108 --> 00:35:25,669
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, I support this whole heartily.

408
00:35:26,009 --> 00:35:36,054
[SPEAKER_16]: I know it's been offered a number of times by other members of the council to bring someone on board, whether it's MPAC or whether it's any other organization or a private consultant.

409
00:35:37,015 --> 00:35:48,580
[SPEAKER_16]: Really, it doesn't matter to me as long as we bring in an expert that can guide us along this very arduous process of really looking through hundreds and hundreds of pages of local zoning that

410
00:35:48,933 --> 00:35:49,974
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

411
00:36:05,471 --> 00:36:14,755
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that we're talking about zoning and I hope that we move past talking, but when we look for someone to bring in, we need to make sure that that group is independent and non-biased.

412
00:36:14,795 --> 00:36:19,897
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to make sure that the zoning reforms that we make are Medford-centric and benefit Medford.

413
00:36:20,377 --> 00:36:25,639
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone talked about all the development that's happening in the city, but what I heard was residential, residential, residential.

414
00:36:26,459 --> 00:36:44,987
[SPEAKER_00]: What's different between our development and Somerville and Cambridge's development is that they are very conscious of maintaining a balance of commercial and residential and making sure that they're able to support the infrastructure, the increased needs, the quality of life items that residents require and should have.

415
00:36:45,567 --> 00:36:47,188
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's really important.

416
00:36:47,388 --> 00:36:50,189
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to think about that as we move forward.

417
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:55,512
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't spoke to one single resident that said, I really hope they sell the house next door to me and put up an apartment building.

418
00:36:56,214 --> 00:37:02,278
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have people living in homes right now that are in apartment zones that that very thing could happen.

419
00:37:02,418 --> 00:37:09,604
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've ever seen a resident who's heard that there's going to be a 12-unit building shading their home, it's very traumatizing.

420
00:37:09,904 --> 00:37:12,926
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nothing that we can do because of the way that the zoning is written.

421
00:37:13,506 --> 00:37:16,929
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, what's happening as we're waiting, this is already happening.

422
00:37:18,044 --> 00:37:24,391
[SPEAKER_00]: People, developers are coming, they're proposing what they want to do, they're going to the ZBA, they're getting multiple, multiple variances.

423
00:37:24,872 --> 00:37:31,600
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that when you have variances in commercial areas where you add residential, that it can cause problems adding commercial in later.

424
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:37,106
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a Dog for Days group that couldn't come in because they were abutting an apartment building.

425
00:37:37,847 --> 00:37:44,591
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a meeting about the Wegmans and there were resident concerns about loading dock hours because the residents were there.

426
00:37:45,112 --> 00:37:48,454
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very cautious about what happens with Mystic Ave.

427
00:37:48,674 --> 00:37:50,415
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the first proposal that came out

428
00:37:50,892 --> 00:37:59,576
[SPEAKER_00]: was 500 units of apartments on Mystic Avenue, dead center of nine parcels, which will impact our ability to develop commercially.

429
00:38:00,137 --> 00:38:08,901
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to stop being the city where developers believe that they can come in and make their own zoning because we haven't updated the zoning.

430
00:38:08,981 --> 00:38:12,923
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just gonna change it and do what they want, and we're gonna be left running behind.

431
00:38:13,644 --> 00:38:13,944
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

432
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,583
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening, David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

433
00:38:21,564 --> 00:38:32,618
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as the zoning goes, the only thing I would caution is that we actually have an understanding as to which direction we'd like to take the city as opposed to the zoning advisors coming in and telling us which direction to go.

434
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:46,468
[SPEAKER_15]: The reason why I say that is because as any situation, if it's driven by tax and tax base, then you're going to see a lot of conversation about high rises and higher up condominiums.

435
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:52,373
[SPEAKER_15]: When we're really trying to see what we can do about addressing the downtown areas and trying to keep the characters of those areas.

436
00:38:53,077 --> 00:38:58,940
[SPEAKER_15]: And there are certain areas of the city I'm sure that can actually be developed like Mystic Ave, mixed use, whatever it is that we want to do.

437
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:16,749
[SPEAKER_15]: But we have to have an understanding as a city in itself before this advisor comes in and we really should be able to tell them which direction we'd like the city to go and how do we get there as opposed to them telling us we think this is the way the city should go and this is how it's going to increase your tax base and this is what it's going to do to the city.

438
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:34,042
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's the one big thing that I would caution everyone to, you know, come together, figure out which direction the city should take and which direction it should go with all the five downtowns, with all the areas that we feel we can develop, whether it should be strictly a high rise or it should be mixed use.

439
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:43,590
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, I believe that, you know, we've got to address the middle class and what we can do about affordability and housing in the respect to that, not just low income as far as well.

440
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:43,790
[SPEAKER_15]: So,

441
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:50,552
[SPEAKER_15]: Those issues are something that we need to go to the table with and making sure that we understand this is the direction we want Medford to go.

442
00:39:50,572 --> 00:39:51,553
[SPEAKER_15]: How do we get there?

443
00:39:51,853 --> 00:39:52,193
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

444
00:39:52,613 --> 00:39:52,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

445
00:39:54,894 --> 00:39:55,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

446
00:39:55,314 --> 00:39:56,314
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record please.

447
00:39:56,374 --> 00:39:59,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Joyce Paul, 8 Mason Street.

448
00:40:00,096 --> 00:40:06,638
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at the last city council meeting and I went to the CPA meeting Wednesday.

449
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:12,455
[SPEAKER_02]: And Michael Marks, Councilor Marks, had brought up three things that I thought were very basic.

450
00:40:12,555 --> 00:40:24,286
[SPEAKER_02]: And he talked about the basics, the roads, the sidewalks, and getting a crossing, not guard, but a crossing thing that doesn't disappear in six months.

451
00:40:25,487 --> 00:40:27,629
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a very big basic.

452
00:40:28,329 --> 00:40:31,132
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I went to the CPA meeting, I asked them,

453
00:40:31,421 --> 00:40:33,363
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they say, well, we can't do this and that.

454
00:40:33,483 --> 00:40:36,685
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, I understand that you can't do this and you can't do that.

455
00:40:37,286 --> 00:40:49,516
[SPEAKER_02]: But if there's any way you could do any of the basic things that we need, it makes more sense than coming up with something that maybe we don't really need, or at least we don't need before the basics.

456
00:40:50,036 --> 00:40:52,398
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether they will do it or not, I don't know.

457
00:40:53,038 --> 00:40:54,780
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did bring it up.

458
00:40:55,661 --> 00:41:00,805
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as the housing, and I'm very, very concerned about the housing.

459
00:41:01,785 --> 00:41:07,526
[SPEAKER_02]: A few years ago, I tried to help someone get senior housing, and it was impossible.

460
00:41:07,646 --> 00:41:22,670
[SPEAKER_02]: And I talked to the person who was the head of senior housing, and they had gotten about a four-unit housing for grandparents who had custody of their children because the children were sick.

461
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:28,091
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a woman, and she had multiple sclerosis, and she gave custody to her

462
00:41:29,582 --> 00:41:30,583
[SPEAKER_02]: her mother and father.

463
00:41:31,343 --> 00:41:40,987
[SPEAKER_02]: And I read there was an article in the Globe about the fact that because of the opioid crisis, there are so many more grandparents having custody of their children.

464
00:41:41,588 --> 00:41:44,109
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought we have to do something for housing.

465
00:41:44,689 --> 00:41:55,074
[SPEAKER_02]: We could do that and it would be a small development and it would be something that we, you know, that we would need and it wouldn't bring in all the problems that, um,

466
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:58,222
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that that would be.

467
00:41:58,842 --> 00:42:14,211
[SPEAKER_02]: So I brought some of the, unfortunately I can't go Saturday, but I hope you will go Saturday or at least get out there your opinion that we need the basics and we need limited housing, but maybe housing for seniors.

468
00:42:14,591 --> 00:42:16,612
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to leave some of these over there.

469
00:42:17,073 --> 00:42:20,855
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't go Saturday, maybe you could fill one of these out and,

470
00:42:21,837 --> 00:42:22,617
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, drop it off.

471
00:42:22,697 --> 00:42:23,197
[SPEAKER_02]: All sorts.

472
00:42:23,477 --> 00:42:24,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

473
00:42:25,118 --> 00:42:26,518
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are really good.

474
00:42:26,638 --> 00:42:29,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how you can stand listening to all of us all the time.

475
00:42:30,139 --> 00:42:30,419
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

476
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,860
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address of the record, please.

477
00:42:37,081 --> 00:42:37,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

478
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:40,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Castagnetti, Cushman street, Method, Massachusetts.

479
00:42:40,882 --> 00:42:40,982
Um,

480
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:49,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Speak back to the Mystic Ave zoning, I'd like to add some input.

481
00:42:49,673 --> 00:42:52,175
[SPEAKER_01]: I lived on Mystic Ave in 1955.

482
00:42:52,255 --> 00:42:58,779
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the old highways of Boston before they built Route 93 in 1960, I believe.

483
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:11,747
[SPEAKER_01]: And about 1965, I come up with an idea, although I didn't have much in numbers of age or power.

484
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:29,909
[SPEAKER_01]: The city, in my opinion, should have taken all of Mr. Gav on the east side by Eminent Domain at that time when we had the muscle and it was more affordable, even with a dirty 21E at the junkyard, presumably.

485
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:37,174
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'd have the developers go up whatever, 25, 35 stories high.

486
00:43:37,194 --> 00:43:38,055
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you worked here,

487
00:43:43,543 --> 00:43:47,544
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be at work now, Marshall Sloan took the idea 10 years ago with his billboard.

488
00:43:49,405 --> 00:44:02,330
[SPEAKER_01]: However, that never happened, and Mr. Gabb is underutilized, and it would be a goldmine if it was in New York City, or even for five miles north of Boston, which it is.

489
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:07,992
[SPEAKER_01]: However, first of all, this new growth, real estate tax,

490
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,403
[SPEAKER_01]: To grow is wonderful because without growth, we start to go backwards.

491
00:44:17,243 --> 00:44:29,209
[SPEAKER_01]: However, when the new growth, when you don't use the new real estate taxes to offset prop two and a half increases, it doesn't help us who have been carrying the weight and paying real estate taxes for all these decades.

492
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:39,755
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually hurts us infinitely because we need more police, more fire, school, buildings, pensions, infrastructure.

493
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:46,930
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, in the following year, they add 2.5 percent to a larger inflated number.

494
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:54,353
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would have put a ring road on Mr. Gaff, keep him off Main Street, unless they wanted to go to Deepa Squally in those days.

495
00:44:57,054 --> 00:45:03,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, good luck with this new zoning, because it should have been done a long, long time ago.

496
00:45:04,638 --> 00:45:07,459
[SPEAKER_01]: But I must reiterate, the new growth does not help us.

497
00:45:08,059 --> 00:45:09,880
[SPEAKER_01]: It hurts us infinitely.

498
00:45:10,294 --> 00:45:11,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for listening.

499
00:45:11,034 --> 00:45:12,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

500
00:45:12,115 --> 00:45:12,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Longo, you're in.

501
00:45:13,376 --> 00:45:13,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

502
00:45:14,356 --> 00:45:25,281
[SPEAKER_03]: President Caraviello, I want to thank the speakers, and I know there are a few of many that are interested in this topic in the city with all the development that has gone on and will continue to go on.

503
00:45:26,042 --> 00:45:36,667
[SPEAKER_03]: I think part of why I asked for a development committee and task forces is so that we can get more community input, but I think Mr. McKillop had a good point, and I

504
00:45:37,351 --> 00:45:54,460
[SPEAKER_03]: That is that the seven of us need to sit down, and I agree with maybe that's a place to start, but we need to do it sooner rather than later with regards to meeting with the Metropolitan Planning Council, and then maybe they can guide us on which company that needs to be hired and the pricing that it will cost.

505
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:58,923
[SPEAKER_03]: But it needs to be the seven of us, and it needs to happen much sooner than it has.

506
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:07,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank the subcommittee for doing the work they've done so far, but I think now it's the seven of us and the committee of the whole that need to take

507
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:25,849
[SPEAKER_03]: the ball by the horns and get this process started, because time cannot tick away on such an important issue, and it is the seven of us that hear from residents on a daily basis, whether they're for development, against development, for a certain amount of units versus more commercial.

508
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:32,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we know what we want, and I think we can tell, no problem tell the Metropolitan Planning Council

509
00:46:33,535 --> 00:46:35,977
[SPEAKER_03]: where we want to go and how we want to get it done.

510
00:46:36,057 --> 00:46:39,700
[SPEAKER_03]: We just need some guidance and we need to start the process sooner than later.

511
00:46:40,501 --> 00:46:40,881
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

512
00:46:40,901 --> 00:46:45,825
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll move the motion by Councilor Lococourin, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

513
00:46:45,885 --> 00:46:46,506
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

514
00:46:46,866 --> 00:46:47,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

515
00:46:47,667 --> 00:46:50,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus the amendment.

516
00:46:50,409 --> 00:46:51,950
[SPEAKER_17]: As amended by Councilor Scarpelli.

517
00:46:53,832 --> 00:46:56,534
[SPEAKER_17]: With the master, yes.

518
00:46:56,714 --> 00:46:58,135
[SPEAKER_17]: As amended by Councilor Scarpelli.

519
00:46:58,155 --> 00:46:59,997
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

520
00:47:00,377 --> 00:47:00,477
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

521
00:47:00,677 --> 00:47:01,438
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

522
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:24,255
[SPEAKER_17]: 17-687 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the DPW report back to the Council when the replacement of asphalt concrete panels will be performed, and be it further resolved an inventory of asphalt street panels be forwarded to the Council, including the address where it's located and the date the concrete was initially removed.

523
00:47:24,835 --> 00:47:25,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

524
00:47:25,936 --> 00:47:27,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

525
00:47:27,737 --> 00:47:30,479
[SPEAKER_08]: There are a number of areas throughout the community that have had

526
00:47:31,115 --> 00:47:36,440
[SPEAKER_08]: asphalt patchwork performed on cracking sidewalks, concrete sidewalks that have been removed.

527
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:56,338
[SPEAKER_08]: And the theory behind it would be that we put a temporary patch down of asphalt sidewalk, and then when we have enough locations in the community that are in a certain area or region, we call the concrete truck up, and we get the concrete truck out there, and we break down these asphalt sidewalk patches, and we put concrete patches down, Mr. President.

528
00:47:57,061 --> 00:48:07,950
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that enough time has passed now, but we do have enough locations across the city of Medford that could require one, two, maybe ten concrete trucks to get out there and start pouring concrete sidewalks, Mr. President.

529
00:48:09,351 --> 00:48:13,374
[SPEAKER_08]: We look at the Regency and the Rio Condominium buildings right on Winthrop Street.

530
00:48:14,374 --> 00:48:20,900
[SPEAKER_08]: For two and a half years, they sat there and they had a gigantic drainage project performed right beside their house.

531
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Their sidewalk was taken down.

532
00:48:23,293 --> 00:48:24,753
[SPEAKER_08]: replaced with an asphalt sidewalk.

533
00:48:25,294 --> 00:48:26,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Two years have gone by.

534
00:48:26,174 --> 00:48:28,115
[SPEAKER_08]: The concrete sidewalk has not been replaced.

535
00:48:29,075 --> 00:48:40,038
[SPEAKER_08]: You go up to Ashcroft Road, Mr. President, and you'll see in front of 129 a tree being removed, the stump being ground down, the sidewalk being replaced with asphalt.

536
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:41,799
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, with asphalt and concrete.

537
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:42,739
[SPEAKER_08]: It still hasn't happened.

538
00:48:42,759 --> 00:48:43,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Two years have gone by.

539
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,280
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's time, Mr. President, that we

540
00:48:45,878 --> 00:48:49,741
[SPEAKER_08]: make a focus on this really basic city service and this real quality of life issue.

541
00:48:49,781 --> 00:48:50,922
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a curb appeal issue.

542
00:48:51,622 --> 00:48:58,888
[SPEAKER_08]: When you look out the window of your vehicle, when you're driving down the street, we like to see concrete sidewalks, not a patchwork of concrete and asphalt, Mr. President.

543
00:48:58,908 --> 00:49:03,011
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm asking the DPW to report back to the council the following information.

544
00:49:03,411 --> 00:49:06,694
[SPEAKER_08]: That is, when the replacement of the asphalt to concrete panels will be performed.

545
00:49:07,382 --> 00:49:11,645
[SPEAKER_08]: and an inventory of those street panels, as well as when the concrete was initially removed.

546
00:49:11,906 --> 00:49:14,447
[SPEAKER_08]: So that we have a better idea as to how long this has been going on.

547
00:49:14,988 --> 00:49:25,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and we can get a better understanding, Mr. President, um, as to how many street panels, how many panels it takes, um, before we call a concrete truck up.

548
00:49:25,336 --> 00:49:28,558
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, with that being said, I move for approval of resolution.

549
00:49:28,578 --> 00:49:29,639
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Dello Russo.

550
00:49:29,859 --> 00:49:30,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

551
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,581
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad this issue was brought up.

552
00:49:32,661 --> 00:49:33,802
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been contacted, uh,

553
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:37,162
[SPEAKER_09]: and stopped by a number of residents regarding this very issue.

554
00:49:37,603 --> 00:49:43,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, we only have a couple of weeks before concrete pouring has to stop.

555
00:49:43,888 --> 00:49:45,469
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's pour, pour, pour.

556
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:47,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

557
00:49:48,932 --> 00:49:50,133
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record, please.

558
00:49:52,414 --> 00:49:53,856
[SPEAKER_14]: Ray Scaffo, 9th Sunset Ave.

559
00:49:54,136 --> 00:49:56,418
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to thank Councilman Knight for bringing this forward.

560
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:02,222
[SPEAKER_14]: This morning I had shown a picture to the Council President about 39th Sunset Ave.

561
00:50:03,697 --> 00:50:07,578
[SPEAKER_14]: Approximately about 50 feet of frontage and the whole sidewalk's been taken up.

562
00:50:08,298 --> 00:50:09,499
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going on four months now.

563
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:15,600
[SPEAKER_14]: They totally framed it in and they haven't come back to pour the cement.

564
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,842
[SPEAKER_14]: There's also a couple of panels on the other side of the street that haven't been done as well.

565
00:50:22,302 --> 00:50:26,243
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a walk through to Tufts University up towards College Ave.

566
00:50:26,263 --> 00:50:27,824
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of people use that route.

567
00:50:28,704 --> 00:50:32,565
[SPEAKER_14]: The problem is they could walk up the street, but they have about 10 yards of gravel.

568
00:50:33,207 --> 00:50:36,690
[SPEAKER_14]: at the end of the street that butt up against the sidewalk as well.

569
00:50:40,252 --> 00:50:49,199
[SPEAKER_14]: The people in the area, well, they're concerned because now we're getting, like Councilor Dello Russo said, we only got a couple of weeks left before we can start pouring cement.

570
00:50:49,772 --> 00:50:53,153
[SPEAKER_14]: So they're concerned about people gonna get hurt walking through.

571
00:50:53,593 --> 00:50:58,795
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now, it's a danger because a lot of leaves now are inside that pit.

572
00:50:59,595 --> 00:51:04,477
[SPEAKER_14]: The pipes are sticking up where shutoffs for water, gas, or whatever on that sidewalk.

573
00:51:04,517 --> 00:51:05,778
[SPEAKER_14]: So people can't see.

574
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:10,219
[SPEAKER_14]: And if they start to walk in through the pit, somebody's gonna trip and fall.

575
00:51:10,879 --> 00:51:15,121
[SPEAKER_14]: The homeowner at 39 is called numerous times to City Hall

576
00:51:15,801 --> 00:51:21,324
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think there was a contractor involved and has totally either disappeared or whatever.

577
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:30,529
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would strongly recommend that the council send a letter to whomever to get this taken care of.

578
00:51:30,549 --> 00:51:33,390
[SPEAKER_17]: I did read that to the attention to Mr. Kearns this morning.

579
00:51:33,751 --> 00:51:36,752
[SPEAKER_17]: Hopefully he'll have an answer for me by tomorrow morning.

580
00:51:36,792 --> 00:51:37,953
[SPEAKER_14]: And I appreciate it because the

581
00:51:40,886 --> 00:51:45,569
[SPEAKER_14]: people, homeowners on the street are getting up in arms and they're ready to come up here full tilt.

582
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:49,432
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you can get back to me as soon as possible, I'll stop.

583
00:51:49,632 --> 00:51:50,453
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll stop the rush.

584
00:51:51,874 --> 00:51:52,595
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

585
00:51:52,915 --> 00:51:53,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

586
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:56,678
[SPEAKER_11]: I thank council for bringing this forward.

587
00:51:56,698 --> 00:52:03,783
[SPEAKER_11]: This is an important public safety issue, especially if you don't have sidewalks, you're forcing people into the street and you're forcing kids into the street.

588
00:52:03,843 --> 00:52:05,124
[SPEAKER_11]: And sometimes that becomes an issue.

589
00:52:05,644 --> 00:52:10,628
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, over the last two weeks, this has come up as an issue where we've had sidewalks that need to be replaced.

590
00:52:11,306 --> 00:52:17,391
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've asked for lists the last few weeks and a list should take literally a few minutes to produce.

591
00:52:17,431 --> 00:52:18,372
[SPEAKER_11]: You just have to print it out.

592
00:52:18,392 --> 00:52:30,141
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you could please, if we could just amend it to get an updated list with regard to the sidewalks that need to be replaced and how many have been replaced so far and how many stumps have been removed.

593
00:52:30,161 --> 00:52:32,263
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, this is stuff that we have requested.

594
00:52:33,324 --> 00:52:37,727
[SPEAKER_11]: I know the last three meetings now we've requested this and we still have no information.

595
00:52:37,767 --> 00:52:38,448
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we could please,

596
00:52:39,409 --> 00:52:40,890
[SPEAKER_11]: just add that amendment to the resolution.

597
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:41,871
[SPEAKER_17]: I greatly appreciate it.

598
00:52:41,991 --> 00:52:42,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

599
00:52:42,932 --> 00:52:47,515
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was this council who was asked several times for the city to put on a cement crew.

600
00:52:48,076 --> 00:52:54,101
[SPEAKER_17]: That should be working nine months a year because we certainly have enough sidewalks to keep a cement crew busy all the time.

601
00:52:55,622 --> 00:53:00,666
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Lococo.

602
00:53:00,926 --> 00:53:01,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

603
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:08,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to be clear, Councilor Falco, what are you looking for for a timeframe on those lists from when we appropriated that large portion of money?

604
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:13,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

605
00:53:14,285 --> 00:53:15,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to make sure we're clear.

606
00:53:15,366 --> 00:53:17,006
[SPEAKER_03]: So we get what we exactly what we want.

607
00:53:18,587 --> 00:53:18,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

608
00:53:19,087 --> 00:53:24,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, we appropriated money, I believe in the spring for this and quite a, uh, quite a bit of money.

609
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:36,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, so if we could find just basically find out, I'd like to see what progress they've made from the list that we were given in the spring, what progress they've made to date, uh, because there were quite a few sidewalks.

610
00:53:37,198 --> 00:53:47,885
[SPEAKER_11]: and stumps that needed to be removed and sidewalk panels that needed to be replaced and asphalt sidewalks that, some parts of the city actually have asphalt sidewalks, so those needed to be replaced as well.

611
00:53:48,506 --> 00:53:54,190
[SPEAKER_11]: And it'd be good to see what kind of progress they've made, how much money they've spent so far, how much is remaining.

612
00:53:55,050 --> 00:54:03,016
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, like it was, like we said earlier, I mean, the season is, you know, dwindling away to poor concrete.

613
00:54:03,596 --> 00:54:05,958
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd really like to see you get an update as to what has,

614
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:08,449
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, with the progress has been so far.

615
00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:10,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

616
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:13,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I certainly have no problem with the paper being amended.

617
00:54:13,571 --> 00:54:17,112
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I'd ask you to be placed forward in the form of a B paper.

618
00:54:18,253 --> 00:54:21,054
[SPEAKER_08]: I want a complete inventory of all the asphalt street panels in the city.

619
00:54:21,915 --> 00:54:29,918
[SPEAKER_08]: My concern isn't whether or not the funds that we appropriated earlier in the year, I believe it was $300,000 to take down some stumps and replace some

620
00:54:30,365 --> 00:54:34,247
[SPEAKER_08]: sidewalks that were damaged during water service work, if I'm not mistaken.

621
00:54:34,547 --> 00:54:34,848
[SPEAKER_08]: We're done.

622
00:54:35,008 --> 00:54:37,049
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to keep them separate, Mr. President.

623
00:54:37,089 --> 00:54:40,591
[SPEAKER_08]: I certainly support Councilor Falco's amendments to the paper.

624
00:54:41,191 --> 00:54:45,654
[SPEAKER_08]: I just would like to see them in a B paper so that the administration doesn't confuse the two issues and only give us one report.

625
00:54:46,534 --> 00:54:47,435
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Mox.

626
00:54:49,136 --> 00:54:50,097
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

627
00:54:51,297 --> 00:54:57,101
[SPEAKER_16]: This council has called for an audit of our streets and our sidewalks for the past several years.

628
00:54:57,941 --> 00:54:59,402
[SPEAKER_16]: To date, we have received

629
00:55:00,153 --> 00:55:03,955
[SPEAKER_16]: uh, no correspondence from the city administration regarding either.

630
00:55:04,616 --> 00:55:16,603
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, you know, we talk about this and we've been talking about it for years, this sidewalk list, like it's some secretive list that's in a vault somewhere that no one can view, but it's out there.

631
00:55:17,123 --> 00:55:19,364
[SPEAKER_16]: Residents aren't sure if they're on the sidewalk list.

632
00:55:19,384 --> 00:55:20,365
[SPEAKER_16]: They've been told they are.

633
00:55:21,456 --> 00:55:30,845
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, why can't we have a list that's on the city website that's updated, that shows you what's being worked on, the progress?

634
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:39,954
[SPEAKER_16]: Why does it have to be this secretive list that we have to beg for to get a copy to see if things are actually working in this community?

635
00:55:41,095 --> 00:55:43,437
[SPEAKER_16]: There's no transparency at all.

636
00:55:44,058 --> 00:55:45,339
[SPEAKER_16]: And this has been the way

637
00:55:46,356 --> 00:55:57,762
[SPEAKER_16]: And actually, in the past, Mr. President, I've actually voted against requests because I've asked, you know, DPW directors, can you show us what you want to spend this money on?

638
00:55:58,162 --> 00:55:59,303
[SPEAKER_16]: How many sidewalks?

639
00:55:59,623 --> 00:56:00,464
[SPEAKER_16]: How many stumps?

640
00:56:00,984 --> 00:56:02,585
[SPEAKER_16]: And we couldn't get any answers.

641
00:56:03,405 --> 00:56:12,290
[SPEAKER_16]: And today, we're still continuing with the same format where, you know, you'll have a resident that calls you up and says, I've been told by City Hall I'm on the list.

642
00:56:13,511 --> 00:56:15,792
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'll tell them, well, there's multiple lists.

643
00:56:16,182 --> 00:56:20,264
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what list you're on, but, uh, you may or may not be on a list.

644
00:56:20,844 --> 00:56:23,066
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, it's just too confusing for residents.

645
00:56:23,366 --> 00:56:24,826
[SPEAKER_16]: It's confusing for this council.

646
00:56:25,227 --> 00:56:31,510
[SPEAKER_16]: I would ask if you want to do a C paper or D paper that, uh, this be put on the city website.

647
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:35,452
[SPEAKER_16]: So a resident can go on Mr. President and look and say, yes,

648
00:56:36,496 --> 00:56:38,177
[SPEAKER_16]: 32 High Street is on the list.

649
00:56:38,538 --> 00:56:46,183
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, it was called in on February 2nd, they plan on getting it to October 3rd, and this is the status, it was closed out.

650
00:56:47,023 --> 00:56:54,428
[SPEAKER_16]: It seems to me a simple request to track, and by leaving it open-ended, no one knows in this community what's going on.

651
00:56:55,629 --> 00:57:02,894
[SPEAKER_16]: No one knows if this sidewalk's gonna get done, they don't really know if they're on the list or not, and until we do a complete audit,

652
00:57:04,082 --> 00:57:09,953
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a couple of things on the resolution for this afternoon, and I know Councilor Falco does also.

653
00:57:11,155 --> 00:57:15,223
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I was on Bowen F to see one particular sidewalk.

654
00:57:16,397 --> 00:57:23,743
[SPEAKER_16]: And honestly, an hour later, I viewed 25 different sidewalks, because residents kept on coming out and said, hey, look at this sidewalk.

655
00:57:23,943 --> 00:57:25,284
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, look, I'm supposed to be on the list.

656
00:57:25,564 --> 00:57:27,266
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, look, they dug this up five months ago.

657
00:57:27,306 --> 00:57:28,066
[SPEAKER_16]: They never came back.

658
00:57:28,366 --> 00:57:29,928
[SPEAKER_16]: All they put was orange cones out here.

659
00:57:30,368 --> 00:57:36,172
[SPEAKER_16]: And literally, that's a microcosm, that one street, on what's happening in this community.

660
00:57:37,593 --> 00:57:39,555
[SPEAKER_16]: It's on every street, Mr. President.

661
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:50,209
[SPEAKER_16]: And until we do a complete audit and come up with one list that's publicized on, uh, the city website or on local cable or wherever you want to put it, we're never going to get a handle on this issue.

662
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,071
[SPEAKER_16]: We're never going to get a handle.

663
00:57:52,091 --> 00:57:52,691
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President.

664
00:57:52,992 --> 00:57:53,352
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

665
00:57:53,632 --> 00:57:55,334
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you want to make that an emotion of a C paper?

666
00:57:55,814 --> 00:58:02,340
[SPEAKER_16]: If he, if he wants to make it a C paper or part of this paper for the purpose of clarity, we'll make that a C paper.

667
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:02,640
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

668
00:58:08,801 --> 00:58:10,042
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record, please.

669
00:58:10,202 --> 00:58:11,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Ray Scaffo, 9 Sunset Ave.

670
00:58:13,345 --> 00:58:14,606
[SPEAKER_14]: There's so many out there.

671
00:58:14,626 --> 00:58:21,491
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I drive the city every day because my business is in the city and between the stumps and the sidewalks and the streets and everything.

672
00:58:21,691 --> 00:58:25,875
[SPEAKER_14]: The problem is, is that we only have five DPW highway department workers.

673
00:58:26,355 --> 00:58:27,776
[SPEAKER_14]: Can't expect them to do everything.

674
00:58:28,217 --> 00:58:29,458
[SPEAKER_14]: You've got contractors out there.

675
00:58:29,498 --> 00:58:32,260
[SPEAKER_14]: They come, they go, they disappear, whatever the situation may be.

676
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:45,726
[SPEAKER_14]: It's time to start to think about hiring some more DPW workers so we can have multiple crews out there doing different things, which will be stumps, sidewalks, potholes, whatever needs to be done.

677
00:58:45,746 --> 00:58:50,728
[SPEAKER_14]: If you have multiple crews doing different things, this will start to move forward and we'll start to get a lot of this cleaned up.

678
00:58:51,368 --> 00:58:51,608
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

679
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:51,908
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

680
00:58:54,669 --> 00:58:55,750
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record, please.

681
00:58:57,223 --> 00:58:58,984
[SPEAKER_15]: David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

682
00:58:59,685 --> 00:59:03,087
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't get a chance to say it before, but it's nice to see your houses all done over.

683
00:59:03,107 --> 00:59:03,387
[SPEAKER_15]: Very nice.

684
00:59:03,447 --> 00:59:04,088
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very good.

685
00:59:04,108 --> 00:59:04,908
[SPEAKER_15]: Glad to be home.

686
00:59:05,348 --> 00:59:06,389
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure you are.

687
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:09,311
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the city's house.

688
00:59:11,132 --> 00:59:25,002
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as the sidewalks, I too have experienced several areas where people are just truly completely frustrated and fed up with the whole process of why they can't get anything completed in this city.

689
00:59:25,802 --> 00:59:32,510
[SPEAKER_15]: My fear right now is the ADA compliance on some of these sidewalks is horrific.

690
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:33,331
[SPEAKER_15]: It's dangerous.

691
00:59:33,551 --> 00:59:39,478
[SPEAKER_15]: I've seen wheelchairs literally go out on the street because they cannot pass on the sidewalks, on some of the sidewalks that we have.

692
00:59:40,959 --> 00:59:44,160
[SPEAKER_15]: and the elderly and the darkness at night.

693
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:50,541
[SPEAKER_15]: When a sidewalk is raised six to eight inches above where it normally should be and someone is walking down the street and it's dark, you can't see.

694
00:59:50,981 --> 00:59:59,483
[SPEAKER_15]: So first things first, there is a company out there and I can find the name of the company that will actually come in in an emergency situation and shave down the sidewalk.

695
00:59:59,523 --> 01:00:06,124
[SPEAKER_15]: So at the very least, until these things are fixed, we can shave the issues that we have so they'll be less likely to trip over them.

696
01:00:06,545 --> 01:00:08,265
[SPEAKER_15]: So let's take some sort of action

697
01:00:09,065 --> 01:00:19,335
[SPEAKER_15]: even if it's just something that's temporary and letting the people know that show us where the worst situation is and we can solve that for you by at least shaving the sidewalks down so no one can trip.

698
01:00:19,675 --> 01:00:20,776
[SPEAKER_15]: So let's start there.

699
01:00:21,197 --> 01:00:31,847
[SPEAKER_15]: Then secondly, this complete streets project kind of really should change the name because in my eyes it's not very complete if we can't add the issues that we currently have in the city

700
01:00:32,247 --> 01:00:39,372
[SPEAKER_15]: to the situation of the corners of every square and some of the sidewalks and some of the ADA.

701
01:00:39,692 --> 01:00:44,536
[SPEAKER_15]: If we're making the entrances onto the sidewalks ADA compliant, we should make the sidewalks ADA compliant.

702
01:00:44,896 --> 01:00:46,337
[SPEAKER_15]: Enough is enough, we've got to fix this.

703
01:00:46,857 --> 01:00:47,238
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

704
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:50,280
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

705
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:53,702
[SPEAKER_13]: George Sacco, 21 Ridgeway Road, Bedford.

706
01:00:54,863 --> 01:00:59,726
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to pick up what Councilor Box was talking about.

707
01:01:01,895 --> 01:01:08,960
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now, we do a budget on a yearly basis on street repairs, sidewalk repairs, X amount of money is allocated.

708
01:01:11,081 --> 01:01:11,862
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a little story.

709
01:01:11,922 --> 01:01:16,705
[SPEAKER_13]: I was in my backyard with my grandchildren and my daughter-in-law and my son.

710
01:01:17,646 --> 01:01:21,449
[SPEAKER_13]: And my daughter-in-law happened to be on her little iPhone.

711
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:29,054
[SPEAKER_13]: And she said, hey, Brian, I just got a text from the city of Salem, Salem, New Hampshire.

712
01:01:30,644 --> 01:01:32,805
[SPEAKER_13]: And my son said, well, what's it about?

713
01:01:33,905 --> 01:01:38,386
[SPEAKER_13]: Gee whiz, they're gonna do our street, complete street in 2020.

714
01:01:38,426 --> 01:01:45,288
[SPEAKER_13]: And here I am thinking, Medford, 58,000 people.

715
01:01:47,749 --> 01:01:49,009
[SPEAKER_13]: We do it on a yearly basis.

716
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:53,731
[SPEAKER_13]: Salem, New Hampshire, they do it on a three-year basis.

717
01:01:54,731 --> 01:01:58,192
[SPEAKER_13]: So what they do is they go out, they prorate, they go out three years.

718
01:01:59,813 --> 01:02:05,235
[SPEAKER_13]: We know, the engineering department, they know three years out what street has to be done.

719
01:02:05,795 --> 01:02:08,156
[SPEAKER_13]: They know three years out what sidewalks have to be done.

720
01:02:09,157 --> 01:02:17,200
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, going out three years, you look down the road and you say, okay, we'll take my street, my old street, Sherwood Road.

721
01:02:18,361 --> 01:02:20,301
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to do Sherwood Road in 2020.

722
01:02:22,062 --> 01:02:24,223
[SPEAKER_13]: Utilities know they're going to do it in 2020.

723
01:02:24,743 --> 01:02:27,164
[SPEAKER_13]: The water department knows they're going to do it in 2020.

724
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:29,045
[SPEAKER_13]: They plan.

725
01:02:29,665 --> 01:02:29,885
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

726
01:02:29,905 --> 01:02:31,005
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got to put water pipes in.

727
01:02:31,025 --> 01:02:32,026
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to put hydrants in.

728
01:02:32,826 --> 01:02:34,286
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's all planned ahead.

729
01:02:35,167 --> 01:02:40,288
[SPEAKER_13]: Estimated costs can be planned ahead, even though it's not budgeted, but it can be all planned ahead.

730
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:43,029
[SPEAKER_13]: So maybe we ought to look at a three year plan.

731
01:02:44,409 --> 01:02:45,349
[SPEAKER_13]: Go out three years.

732
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:49,390
[SPEAKER_13]: We do a yearly budget 2017.

733
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:51,191
[SPEAKER_13]: We move it out to 2021.

734
01:02:52,731 --> 01:02:53,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Just keep moving it that way.

735
01:02:54,092 --> 01:02:56,752
[SPEAKER_13]: And this way here, the residents know you publish it.

736
01:02:57,393 --> 01:02:58,453
[SPEAKER_13]: You publish it on the internet.

737
01:02:59,261 --> 01:03:05,466
[SPEAKER_13]: publish it in the local newspaper, so the people know three years from now that they have a shot at having their street done.

738
01:03:06,267 --> 01:03:07,308
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's just a suggestion.

739
01:03:07,968 --> 01:03:08,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Appreciate your time.

740
01:03:08,949 --> 01:03:09,290
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

741
01:03:10,571 --> 01:03:26,384
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Knight on the seat paper offered by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight.

742
01:03:26,624 --> 01:03:27,285
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

743
01:03:32,555 --> 01:03:53,715
[SPEAKER_17]: motion passes on the beat paper offered by council Falco seconded by councillor night all the favor

744
01:03:57,443 --> 01:04:01,346
[SPEAKER_17]: And on the original paper offered by Councilor Knights, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

745
01:04:01,366 --> 01:04:02,047
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favour?

746
01:04:02,907 --> 01:04:06,530
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

747
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:09,152
[SPEAKER_17]: 17-688, offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

748
01:04:09,473 --> 01:04:20,742
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it resolved that the administration give a written update with regards to the Riverside Plaza project, including a detailed breakdown of how the monies have been spent thus far and what remains to be funded.

749
01:04:21,142 --> 01:04:22,063
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

750
01:04:22,587 --> 01:04:23,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

751
01:04:23,908 --> 01:04:35,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is pretty self-explanatory, looking for a breakdown from Office of Community Development on what monies have been expended thus far and how much more we have to go.

752
01:04:35,298 --> 01:04:50,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there was somewhat of an update that we had to read about in the transcript, but if the council could be given a detailed breakdown, that would be much appreciated because it sparked follow-up calls from residents to us of why is this project potentially going over?

753
01:04:51,246 --> 01:04:52,608
[SPEAKER_03]: and we really weren't notified.

754
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:54,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to learn about it in the paper.

755
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:55,150
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

756
01:04:55,370 --> 01:04:55,971

01:05:00,736 --> 01:05:01,296

760
01:05:02,017 --> 01:05:05,080

[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

765
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:23,071
[SPEAKER_16]: This sidewalk requires attention by the city and I would ask that it be reviewed and replaced in the interest of public safety.

766
01:05:23,551 --> 01:05:26,392
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by councilor mark seconded by councilor night.

767
01:05:26,432 --> 01:05:32,393
[SPEAKER_17]: All the favor motion passes 17 six nine zero offered by councilor night.

768
01:05:32,736 --> 01:05:39,481
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request that the sidewalk panel on the corner of Governors Avenue and Sherwood Avenue be repaired.

769
01:05:39,601 --> 01:05:40,382
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

770
01:05:41,022 --> 01:05:41,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, yes.

771
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:44,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Very similar to the situation that Councilor Marks just spoke of.

772
01:05:44,765 --> 01:05:50,469
[SPEAKER_08]: This sidewalk panel on the corner of Sherwood Road and Governors Avenue was broken down and it was replaced with gravel.

773
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:51,770
[SPEAKER_08]: And the gravel remains.

774
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:53,292
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no smooth surface there.

775
01:05:53,732 --> 01:05:55,433
[SPEAKER_08]: As leaps fall, it becomes a trip hazard.

776
01:05:55,733 --> 01:05:57,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Move for approval, Mr. President.

777
01:05:57,214 --> 01:06:00,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully the DPW can get to this before long.

778

01:06:27,992 --> 01:06:29,033

[SPEAKER_11]: We just want to congratulate Duncan McLean, uh, for, uh, this significant achievement.

792
01:06:58,399 --> 01:06:58,439
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh,

793
01:06:59,731 --> 01:07:04,914
[SPEAKER_11]: you'll be officially becoming Eagle Scout.

794
01:07:05,134 --> 01:07:10,418
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really remarkable to go through the whole process and to earn that rank.

795
01:07:10,998 --> 01:07:12,619
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe the statistic, there's only 4% of

796
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:23,017
[SPEAKER_11]: young men that actually get to that point where they go all the way through the program and become an Eagle Scout.

797
01:07:23,237 --> 01:07:25,418
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really a remarkable achievement.

798
01:07:26,059 --> 01:07:27,020
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a great kid.

799
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,260
[SPEAKER_11]: He's in college now.

800
01:07:29,741 --> 01:07:35,706
[SPEAKER_11]: The surface project was to basically, I believe it was improving the landscaping down at the Otis Street Church.

801
01:07:35,986 --> 01:07:40,909
[SPEAKER_11]: It actually did a lot of structural work to prevent the foundation from flooding as well.

802
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:43,060
[SPEAKER_11]: He did a great job.

803
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:46,381
[SPEAKER_11]: I went down there and visited him during the project.

804
01:07:47,041 --> 01:07:50,642
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, unfortunately that day was pouring out, it was raining.

805
01:07:50,662 --> 01:08:00,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, but really he and his, uh, uh, fellow, uh, troop worked through it and really did a great job of really, uh, upgrading the, uh, the grounds.

806
01:08:00,444 --> 01:08:03,025
[SPEAKER_11]: And they did a nice job with the foundation work as well.

807
01:08:03,545 --> 01:08:07,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, so I just wanted to, uh, congratulate him on the, uh, this achievement.

808
01:08:07,386 --> 01:08:07,866
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course,

809
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:12,162
[SPEAKER_11]: If we could have him come down to receive a council of common kind of nation, that'd be great.

810
01:08:12,442 --> 01:08:12,702
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

811
01:08:12,862 --> 01:08:13,722
[SPEAKER_17]: Outstanding young man.

812
01:08:13,782 --> 01:08:14,623
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice president marks.

813
01:08:15,543 --> 01:08:16,544
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

814
01:08:16,724 --> 01:08:28,969
[SPEAKER_16]: As councilor Falco just alluded to, um, you know, I don't know what it is in the water in the city of method here, but, uh, we are turning out, uh, Eagle scouts, uh, a real great rate in this community.

815
01:08:29,629 --> 01:08:35,252
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, the Otis street church needs to be commended, uh, because a lot of the Eagle scouts are coming from that particular,

816
01:08:36,025 --> 01:08:48,630
[SPEAKER_16]: uh, PAC and, um, uh, Duncan, uh, has done yeoman's work as John just alluded to, uh, about doing some landscaping and foundation work around the church itself as a community project.

817
01:08:49,230 --> 01:08:58,974
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, last Saturday, Mr. President, I had the opportunity to go around with another young gentleman, uh, John fee, uh, in this community who was going for his Eagle Scout badge.

818
01:08:59,632 --> 01:09:13,315
[SPEAKER_16]: And his community project was to have made up hydrant markers, 100 hydrant markers that he personally installed with his other Cub Scouts.

819
01:09:14,315 --> 01:09:19,956
[SPEAKER_16]: And he went around and he went to the vocational school and had them made up.

820
01:09:20,296 --> 01:09:25,237
[SPEAKER_16]: They painted them, they installed them, and it's a real good community service project.

821
01:09:25,837 --> 01:09:28,758
[SPEAKER_16]: And in this day and age, with all that's going on,

822
01:09:29,252 --> 01:09:41,597
[SPEAKER_16]: It's nice to hear the positive stories that are happening, in particular with young people in our community that are getting involved and seeing the importance of community building and helping the community.

823
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:49,840
[SPEAKER_16]: So I want to congratulate Duncan and I hope John Fee with his project moves forward and we'll be seeing him shortly too, Mr. President.

824
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:51,021
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

825
01:09:51,561 --> 01:09:54,102
[SPEAKER_17]: And if we can get them, if we can get them up here soon.

826
01:09:54,482 --> 01:09:58,665
[SPEAKER_17]: to get a citation and congratulations to the council, we greatly appreciate it.

827
01:09:58,685 --> 01:10:01,767
[SPEAKER_17]: On motion by Councilor Marks and Councilor Falco, all those in favor?

828
01:10:02,748 --> 01:10:03,528
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

829
01:10:03,548 --> 01:10:13,815
[SPEAKER_17]: 17-693, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council wish Rose DeLuca a happy and healthy 90th birthday.

830
01:10:14,435 --> 01:10:15,176
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

831
01:10:16,937 --> 01:10:18,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

832
01:10:18,938 --> 01:10:19,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Rose, happy birthday.

833
01:10:20,612 --> 01:10:23,833
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like my Council colleagues to join me in wishing Mr. Luker a happy birthday.

834
01:10:24,133 --> 01:10:27,534
[SPEAKER_08]: 90's a milestone, Mr. President, and I wish her another 90 happy and healthy years.

835
01:10:28,074 --> 01:10:28,534
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

836
01:10:29,374 --> 01:10:34,236
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Lococoon, all those in favor?

837
01:10:35,196 --> 01:10:38,457
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

838
01:10:38,477 --> 01:10:49,700
[SPEAKER_17]: 17-697, offered by Councilor Falco, whereas the City of Medford has recently removed many of the outdated fire call boxes located throughout the city, be it resolved that the City of Medford Electrical Department remove

839
01:10:50,084 --> 01:10:57,406
[SPEAKER_17]: the remaining base of the firebox that still remains in front of 201 Main Street in the interest of public safety.

840
01:10:57,506 --> 01:10:58,466
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Falco.

841
01:10:58,586 --> 01:10:59,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

842
01:10:59,487 --> 01:11:01,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, it's 201 Salem Street.

843
01:11:01,727 --> 01:11:04,888
[SPEAKER_11]: It's right in front of Brookline Bank on Salem Street.

844
01:11:05,588 --> 01:11:15,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, I've got a number of calls on this and uh, sometimes if I get off the bus, uh, when it coming out of town on Salem Street, I, you know, actually the bus drops you off.

845
01:11:15,331 --> 01:11:16,231
[SPEAKER_11]: It's right there on the ground.

846
01:11:16,291 --> 01:11:19,472
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, it's actually where the old fire call box used to be.

847
01:11:19,987 --> 01:11:24,130
[SPEAKER_11]: They took the call boxes out, but there's like a small pipe that's sticking up.

848
01:11:24,551 --> 01:11:31,337
[SPEAKER_11]: And there was some wires that were in the pipe that had been cut, but it's definitely a trip hazard to anybody that's walking through there.

849
01:11:31,377 --> 01:11:37,121
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is a highly traversed area with people catching the bus and just walking to and from school.

850
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:38,643
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's right in our crosswalk.

851
01:11:38,683 --> 01:11:43,607
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we could have the electrical department or the DPW department, whoever's that's Mr. Randazzo.

852
01:11:44,153 --> 01:11:44,533
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

853
01:11:44,553 --> 01:11:49,817
[SPEAKER_11]: If we could have him come down or maybe with the assistance of the DPW department, uh, just have him come down and remove that.

854
01:11:50,377 --> 01:11:53,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, it's, it's definitely a safety hazard and it needs to be taken care of right away.

855
01:11:54,099 --> 01:11:54,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

856
01:11:54,379 --> 01:11:54,700
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

857
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:58,582
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

858
01:11:58,622 --> 01:11:59,242
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor.

859
01:11:59,863 --> 01:12:03,785
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

860
01:12:04,045 --> 01:12:07,708
[SPEAKER_17]: 17 6 9 8 offered by Councilors Falco and Scarpelli.

861
01:12:07,768 --> 01:12:11,430
[SPEAKER_17]: Whereas there were a number of blinded intersections located on the Fulton street,

862
01:12:11,998 --> 01:12:18,620
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it resolved that the City of Medford install mirrors at the following intersections in the interest of public safety.

863
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:23,661
[SPEAKER_17]: Fulton Street and Ridgeway Road, Fulton Street and Wausen Street.

864
01:12:24,122 --> 01:12:26,962
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight, excuse me, Councilor Falco.

865
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:30,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

866
01:12:30,163 --> 01:12:35,125
[SPEAKER_11]: I've received a lot of phone calls on this as well, and I know my colleague has as well.

867
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:37,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Up in the Heights, there are a couple of intersections

868
01:12:39,437 --> 01:12:53,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, and this has actually came up at the police community meeting as well, where if you're going from Fulton street or actually if you're coming from, uh, Watson, uh, coming from Highland Ave and you want to take the left or right onto Fulton street, it's a blind intersection.

869
01:12:53,931 --> 01:12:57,195
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you really, you kind of have to guess if there's any cars coming.

870
01:12:57,655 --> 01:12:58,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Same thing with Ridgeway road.

871
01:12:59,497 --> 01:13:02,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you know, so I think a mirror on the, um,

872
01:13:03,018 --> 01:13:10,902
[SPEAKER_11]: telephone pole that actually would help indicate whether or not the cars are coming from the other direction would be beneficial, um, you know, from a safety perspective.

873
01:13:11,462 --> 01:13:26,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, so if we could, uh, if we could actually have, uh, actually probably if we can move this paper to the traffic commission for approval and if we could actually have those, um, mirrors installed, that would be a, I think a great in the interest of public safety.

874
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:26,570
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

875
01:13:26,710 --> 01:13:27,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

876
01:13:27,291 --> 01:13:27,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Nice.

877
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:32,389
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli's paper as well?

878
01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:33,490
[SPEAKER_17]: He's a sponsor.

879
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:35,191
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli?

880
01:13:36,111 --> 01:13:36,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Shame, Rick.

881
01:13:37,071 --> 01:13:37,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

882
01:13:39,112 --> 01:13:40,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, thank you.

883
01:13:40,993 --> 01:13:44,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco and I both were, I think we're all in attendance at the St.

884
01:13:44,575 --> 01:13:46,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Francis traffic meeting.

885
01:13:46,656 --> 01:13:55,600
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that we talked about where the mayor is, and I believe Chief Sackler said that those wouldn't be an issue.

886
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:55,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And,

887
01:13:56,792 --> 01:13:58,814
[SPEAKER_04]: it would be very helpful for those neighbors.

888
01:13:58,854 --> 01:14:06,260
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that, um, with the residents that, that asked and we brought it forward and it seemed like it was pretty positive.

889
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:12,485
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we can get that update and get those, get those installed as soon as possible, it would be greatly appreciated.

890
01:14:12,505 --> 01:14:13,006
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

891
01:14:13,306 --> 01:14:13,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

892
01:14:13,686 --> 01:14:14,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scott.

893
01:14:14,447 --> 01:14:15,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

894
01:14:15,348 --> 01:14:17,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, Mr. President, thank you very much.

895
01:14:17,129 --> 01:14:18,691
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you to the sponsors of this resolution.

896
01:14:18,891 --> 01:14:20,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I'd like to amend with a B paper as well.

897
01:14:20,752 --> 01:14:23,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, uh, if you're traveling northbound on main street,

898
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:30,522
[SPEAKER_08]: You go underneath the highway, past South Street, underneath the highway, and you go to take a left-hand turn onto Route 16.

899
01:14:31,482 --> 01:14:43,507
[SPEAKER_08]: With the renovations that they've made to the Karatek Bridge and the relocation from the construction on the left side of the street to the right side of the street, right now it's very difficult when you're taking a left-hand turn onto Route 16 to see one whole lane of traffic.

900
01:14:44,247 --> 01:14:50,929
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm asking the engineering department if they'd be willing to take an inspection of the site and make recommendations to improve safety at the location, Mr. President.

901
01:14:54,140 --> 01:15:08,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Back to the main paper, Mr. President, I just wanted to chime in on what Councilor Scarpelli said, was that a number of locations were mentioned by citizens for up there.

902
01:15:08,208 --> 01:15:20,615
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just want to urge the Chief, who, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, was amenable to these types of improvements, to move on them quickly and to expand the scope.

903
01:15:20,655 --> 01:15:23,177
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there were three or four spots that had been mentioned.

904
01:15:23,573 --> 01:15:27,105
[SPEAKER_09]: if I'm not mistaken, where these would be most helpful.

905
01:15:29,287 --> 01:15:40,196
[SPEAKER_09]: It was serious enough for a significant neighbourhood meeting and the people in there were very patient with us.

906
01:15:40,937 --> 01:15:45,781
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a hot summer night and a lot of headway was made.

907
01:15:46,021 --> 01:15:58,631
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people who offered really solid stuff and really solid assessments of what's going on there.

908
01:15:59,256 --> 01:16:12,899
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just hope that we're able to implement some of these recommendations, have them hashed out in the traffic commission and moved on just to give these people some relief.

909
01:16:14,039 --> 01:16:17,000
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a major regional issue there.

910
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,120
[SPEAKER_09]: They're seeing it acutely.

911
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,501
[SPEAKER_09]: They shouldn't have to live under this type of disturbance.

912
01:16:22,881 --> 01:16:27,422
[SPEAKER_09]: So the slightest thing we can do to help them, I would recommend.

913
01:16:29,177 --> 01:16:29,577
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

914
01:16:31,018 --> 01:16:32,119
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor vice president box.

915
01:16:32,679 --> 01:16:37,722
[SPEAKER_16]: And just if we can add a resident only, I know that was brought up several times at the meeting too.

916
01:16:38,463 --> 01:16:44,466
[SPEAKER_16]: And some of the roads up there, our residents are looking at resident only because of, uh, the severe cut through traffic.

917
01:16:46,168 --> 01:16:46,588
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

918
01:16:47,608 --> 01:16:48,789
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record, please.

919
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:52,311
[SPEAKER_13]: George cycle 21 Ridgeway road.

920
01:16:52,331 --> 01:16:58,095
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, I've been on Ridgeway road for 16 years and I have to thank council Scarpelli,

921
01:16:58,857 --> 01:17:01,018
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Falco for bringing this up tonight.

922
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:05,061
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to let my neighbors know that maybe we're going to get a mirror there.

923
01:17:05,881 --> 01:17:09,363
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, it's so dangerous.

924
01:17:10,104 --> 01:17:15,427
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, I mean, I, I know there's other blind spots in Medford, but Ridgeway road is so dangerous.

925
01:17:16,187 --> 01:17:24,452
[SPEAKER_13]: It's almost like suicide when you come up Ridgeway road, you don't even want to try to take a left hand turn at Ridgeway road because number one,

926
01:17:25,795 --> 01:17:28,817
[SPEAKER_13]: Traffic is unbelievable, but number two, the speed.

927
01:17:30,859 --> 01:17:38,144
[SPEAKER_13]: They come down, even though the stop sign is at the Fulton Spring Road intersection, they come down that street, 40, 45 miles an hour.

928
01:17:38,604 --> 01:17:40,626
[SPEAKER_13]: It's amazing no one's been killed, okay?

929
01:17:41,286 --> 01:17:46,950
[SPEAKER_13]: But you're right about the other areas having mirrors.

930
01:17:48,791 --> 01:17:53,535
[SPEAKER_13]: Ridgeway Road, Council Box, residents only.

931
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:57,659
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have a no right turn on that street.

932
01:17:57,679 --> 01:18:00,020
[SPEAKER_13]: There's two of them, no right turn.

933
01:18:01,141 --> 01:18:11,206
[SPEAKER_13]: And what I've been finding out is that a lot of the traffic that's coming out of the heights is North Medford residents.

934
01:18:12,727 --> 01:18:17,429
[SPEAKER_13]: What we're seeing is we're seeing a tremendous amount of traffic coming in from Malden, Melrose.

935
01:18:18,249 --> 01:18:20,510
[SPEAKER_13]: They've already been coming off 93, go by the Stonehenge Zoo,

936
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:27,481
[SPEAKER_13]: and they come down, Elm Street's backed up, they come right around the rotary and come down Fulton Street.

937
01:18:27,501 --> 01:18:30,222
[SPEAKER_13]: So what you're seeing is a tremendous amount of traffic.

938
01:18:31,543 --> 01:18:37,547
[SPEAKER_13]: The only street off of Fulton Street to get off to 93, other than the Fellsway, is Ridgeway Road.

939
01:18:38,968 --> 01:18:41,089
[SPEAKER_13]: I've counted 80, 90 cars in an hour.

940
01:18:42,169 --> 01:18:45,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Some mornings, having a cup of coffee, just watching them coming down.

941
01:18:47,072 --> 01:18:49,654
[SPEAKER_13]: Police enforcement just doesn't exist up there.

942
01:18:50,586 --> 01:18:59,012
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so I think in the long run, if we can at least get a mirror there, the people on Ridgeway Road, at least we can see that traffic coming down.

943
01:18:59,072 --> 01:19:04,455
[SPEAKER_13]: And most importantly, these people coming down Fulton Street, they're gonna be able to see Ridgeway Road.

944
01:19:04,715 --> 01:19:10,259
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's critical because they come around, when they come off Fulton Street, they swing on the other side of Ridgeway Road.

945
01:19:10,759 --> 01:19:13,261
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've seen cars hit head on since I've been there.

946
01:19:13,841 --> 01:19:14,962
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank God no one's been killed.

947
01:19:15,743 --> 01:19:17,264
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's another issue.

948
01:19:17,884 --> 01:19:19,145
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

949
01:19:19,901 --> 01:19:20,301
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

950
01:19:20,341 --> 01:19:23,243
[SPEAKER_13]: I was at that meeting and, uh, it was very constructive.

951
01:19:23,303 --> 01:19:27,006
[SPEAKER_13]: So, uh, hopefully we'll see a mirror on the pole again.

952
01:19:27,066 --> 01:19:27,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.

953
01:19:27,226 --> 01:19:27,546
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

954
01:19:27,566 --> 01:19:28,406
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate the time.

955
01:19:30,848 --> 01:19:32,029
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record, please.

956
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:40,654
[SPEAKER_14]: Ray scaffold, nine sensitive as council Knight stated, um, taking a left onto main street onto the 16.

957
01:19:42,088 --> 01:19:43,789
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very dangerous.

958
01:19:43,829 --> 01:19:48,792
[SPEAKER_14]: Especially if there are no police officers there once the site gets closed down for the evening.

959
01:19:49,332 --> 01:19:52,474
[SPEAKER_14]: They should put up barriers so they can't take a left‑hand turn.

960
01:19:52,494 --> 01:19:56,537
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody is going to get hurt if that is opened up.

961
01:19:57,822 --> 01:20:01,985
[SPEAKER_14]: traffic coming the other way, it's very difficult to see the person taking a left hand turn there.

962
01:20:02,445 --> 01:20:07,629
[SPEAKER_14]: So let them go through the center and come around and, and take a right to get onto route 16.

963
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:13,494
[SPEAKER_14]: So whatever you guys can do to, um, to make that happen, uh, I would appreciate it.

964
01:20:13,514 --> 01:20:14,274
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

965
01:20:14,655 --> 01:20:15,355
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli.

966
01:20:15,896 --> 01:20:16,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, one last thing.

967
01:20:16,556 --> 01:20:25,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that, um, thank you Mr. President, but, uh, Councilor Falco's, uh, hard work and, uh, the new traffic, uh, engineer that will be coming in, I think that,

968
01:20:26,523 --> 01:20:34,710
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one of the, so the residents know that one of the first priorities that they talked about is the Fulton Heights and what's happening there.

969
01:20:35,150 --> 01:20:37,032
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a major cut through for 93.

970
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:39,874
[SPEAKER_04]: So it hasn't been forgotten.

971
01:20:40,054 --> 01:20:48,201
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that that's one of the things that residents have been stopping me and Councilor Falco about that we live in the neighborhood that it's, where have we gone since that meeting?

972
01:20:48,261 --> 01:20:53,425
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's still a hot topic and we won't let it die across the community.

973
01:20:53,485 --> 01:20:54,026
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

974
01:20:55,587 --> 01:21:01,248
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilors Falco and Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

975
01:21:01,328 --> 01:21:02,028
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

976
01:21:02,188 --> 01:21:02,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

977
01:21:02,848 --> 01:21:03,909
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

978
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:06,089
[SPEAKER_17]: With the beat paper.

979
01:21:06,109 --> 01:21:08,269
[SPEAKER_17]: With the beat paper.

980
01:21:08,289 --> 01:21:12,950
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion by Councilor Scarpelli to take hands, papers in the hands of the clerk.

981
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:15,031
[SPEAKER_17]: We have two under suspension.

982
01:21:15,151 --> 01:21:16,791
[SPEAKER_17]: And under suspension.

983
01:21:16,831 --> 01:21:17,571
[SPEAKER_17]: And under suspension.

984
01:21:20,392 --> 01:21:21,812
[SPEAKER_17]: Seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

985
01:21:21,892 --> 01:21:22,452
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

986
01:21:25,222 --> 01:21:32,508
[SPEAKER_17]: 17, 700 offered by Councilor Knight be it resolved that the tree stump in front of 34th Toro Avenue be removed.

987
01:21:33,669 --> 01:21:34,390
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

988
01:21:36,492 --> 01:21:38,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, Mr. President, a basic service request.

989
01:21:38,494 --> 01:21:46,601
[SPEAKER_08]: I was out knocking on doors yesterday and I came up to 34 Toro Ave in front of this residence was a very large tree stump, probably

990
01:21:47,065 --> 01:21:48,886
[SPEAKER_08]: three to four feet in diameter.

991
01:21:50,206 --> 01:21:57,148
[SPEAKER_08]: The tree has been gone for an extended period of time and the residents expressed some frustration that the tree has not been removed yet.

992
01:21:57,728 --> 01:22:00,569
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, I told them that I'd do my best to get it removed.

993
01:22:00,609 --> 01:22:05,030
[SPEAKER_08]: I placed the matter on the agenda and I hope that our administration will take the appropriate steps to do such.

994
01:22:06,410 --> 01:22:10,512
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

995
01:22:10,552 --> 01:22:11,072
[SPEAKER_17]: All in favor?

996
01:22:11,432 --> 01:22:11,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

997
01:22:11,792 --> 01:22:13,552
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

998
01:22:13,572 --> 01:22:15,273
[SPEAKER_17]: 17-701 offered by Councilor Lococo.

999
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:31,665
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Metro resident Henry Millering for receiving the MPAH 2017 Patriot Award in recognition of his leadership and contribution to the Haitian community in Massachusetts.

1000
01:22:32,045 --> 01:22:33,785
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1001
01:22:34,226 --> 01:22:35,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

1002
01:22:37,387 --> 01:22:41,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I was able to read an article and find out that Henry Millering was

1003
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:46,021
[SPEAKER_03]: is receiving this Patriot Award, and I think it's such an honor.

1004
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:55,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Henry is a friend to many of us, and he does a tremendous amount of work in the disability community, but also in the Haitian community, and he's being recognized for it.

1005
01:22:55,144 --> 01:22:57,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm obviously very proud.

1006
01:22:57,525 --> 01:23:07,088
[SPEAKER_03]: He's being, they're going to have a ceremony for him at the end of the month, and I think it's something that I wanted to bring up, just to let him know we appreciate all his hard work and effort for what he does for

1007
01:23:08,478 --> 01:23:09,479
[SPEAKER_03]: a tremendous amount of people.

1008
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:12,322
[SPEAKER_17]: If you'd like to invite him up here for a citation by the council?

1009
01:23:12,362 --> 01:23:12,662
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, please.

1010
01:23:12,682 --> 01:23:13,503
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be appreciated.

1011
01:23:15,004 --> 01:23:15,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1012
01:23:16,105 --> 01:23:16,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1013
01:23:16,986 --> 01:23:21,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I thank my colleague Brianna Longo-Curran for bringing this forward.

1014
01:23:21,871 --> 01:23:34,282
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that I had a problem about three months ago with a resident, a Haitian resident, a young teenager that was having some issues with a passport.

1015
01:23:34,885 --> 01:23:39,307
[SPEAKER_04]: to get to his grandmother's funeral in Haiti.

1016
01:23:39,947 --> 01:23:42,408
[SPEAKER_04]: And all I had to do was make one phone call to Henry.

1017
01:23:43,148 --> 01:23:52,352
[SPEAKER_04]: And the consulate called this young man back and made sure he could be back home with his family to rest his grandmother at peace.

1018
01:23:52,432 --> 01:23:55,253
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are just little things that Henry does.

1019
01:23:55,273 --> 01:24:00,175
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, too, he's a great man and a recognition well-deserved.

1020
01:24:00,455 --> 01:24:00,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1021
01:24:01,936 --> 01:24:02,676
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Marx.

1022
01:24:03,597 --> 01:24:04,398
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1023
01:24:04,438 --> 01:24:08,742
[SPEAKER_16]: I too just would like to thank Councilor Lungo for bringing this recognition.

1024
01:24:09,102 --> 01:24:19,791
[SPEAKER_16]: Henry's been a long established member of this community and as Councilor Scarpelli so eloquently said, will be the first to step forward in order to help someone that's in need.

1025
01:24:20,491 --> 01:24:26,076
[SPEAKER_16]: And I too want to thank him for all his efforts on behalf of all Method residents in this community.

1026
01:24:27,097 --> 01:24:28,218
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1027
01:24:29,135 --> 01:24:29,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

1028
01:24:30,516 --> 01:24:31,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1029
01:24:31,917 --> 01:24:33,719
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think my colleagues have hit the nail on the head.

1030
01:24:33,999 --> 01:24:39,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, Mr. Miller's work in the community is not just limited to that at the MPHA.

1031
01:24:39,163 --> 01:24:42,406
[SPEAKER_08]: He's also been a strong advocate for the disabled in our community.

1032
01:24:42,886 --> 01:24:45,028
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's also been a strong advocate for his neighbors.

1033
01:24:45,088 --> 01:24:48,571
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's been a strong member of the democratic body chairing our wood six city committee.

1034
01:24:48,971 --> 01:24:52,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so with that being said, thank you Henry for your service and your work and congratulations.

1035
01:24:53,655 --> 01:24:54,396
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco.

1036
01:24:54,636 --> 01:24:55,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1037
01:24:55,357 --> 01:24:57,979
[SPEAKER_11]: I also just wanted to take a second to congratulate Henry.

1038
01:24:58,019 --> 01:24:59,801
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a big part of our community.

1039
01:24:59,921 --> 01:25:00,942
[SPEAKER_11]: He's always there when you need him.

1040
01:25:01,242 --> 01:25:05,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, he's, uh, uh, helping organize that word six, uh, candidates night.

1041
01:25:05,145 --> 01:25:06,026
[SPEAKER_11]: So he's always active.

1042
01:25:06,066 --> 01:25:07,027
[SPEAKER_11]: He's always there when you need him.

1043
01:25:07,067 --> 01:25:07,668
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a great guy.

1044
01:25:07,688 --> 01:25:09,129
[SPEAKER_11]: And so congratulations to Henry.

1045
01:25:10,050 --> 01:25:15,195
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, it's not a week old that goes by that I don't talk to Henry and he's a good man and good leader of this community.

1046
01:25:15,695 --> 01:25:19,879
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're glad I'd say I'd like to have him come down for a citation the next few weeks.

1047
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:23,762
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilman O'Connor, seconded by?

1048
01:25:24,143 --> 01:25:24,443
[SPEAKER_17]: Second.

1049
01:25:25,584 --> 01:25:28,486
[SPEAKER_17]: By Councilor Dello Russo and Councilor Scarpelli.

1050
01:25:28,526 --> 01:25:29,087
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1051
01:25:29,967 --> 01:25:30,988
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1052
01:25:32,610 --> 01:25:41,477
[SPEAKER_17]: Offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the Medford City Council requests that the tree warden examine the tree in front of St.

1053
01:25:41,537 --> 01:25:45,200
[SPEAKER_17]: Francis Parish Center in the interest of public safety.

1054
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:46,999
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Falco.

1055
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:48,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1056
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:54,784
[SPEAKER_11]: I had the, I actually received a call from a resident the other day and uh, I actually took a walk down there to check it out myself.

1057
01:25:54,844 --> 01:25:57,665
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a tree, a rather large tree in front of us, St.

1058
01:25:57,705 --> 01:25:58,806
[SPEAKER_11]: Francis parish center.

1059
01:25:59,326 --> 01:26:05,429
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not sure if there was a car accident there recently, but it looks like it is just hollowed out completely.

1060
01:26:05,909 --> 01:26:10,092
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a really large tree and I'm really concerned that this thing is about to tip.

1061
01:26:10,132 --> 01:26:10,532
[SPEAKER_11]: But, um,

1062
01:26:11,030 --> 01:26:25,300
[SPEAKER_11]: If we could send out our tree warden to take a look to see what exactly route should be taken as far as if the tree is, you know, if it's still viable, I guess.

1063
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:31,003
[SPEAKER_11]: The tree looks like it's about to go and I really have a major concern that it's going to fall into the road.

1064
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:34,500
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like it's hollow.

1065
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:41,726
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm assuming if we could have a tree warden go out there as soon as possible to take a look into this, I'd greatly appreciate it.

1066
01:26:41,926 --> 01:26:42,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1067
01:26:42,407 --> 01:26:42,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1068
01:26:43,287 --> 01:26:44,168
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Dello Russo.

1069
01:26:44,568 --> 01:26:51,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I feel that I should inform the body that that tree no longer exists.

1070
01:26:51,254 --> 01:26:51,795
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gone.

1071
01:26:52,495 --> 01:26:56,058
[SPEAKER_09]: When I made the bend around to be on time for a 10 o'clock funeral mass at St.

1072
01:26:56,098 --> 01:27:01,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Francis this morning, the tree was being taken down right before our eyes.

1073
01:27:02,721 --> 01:27:06,222
[SPEAKER_09]: shredded into a million pieces and thrown into a truck and driven away.

1074
01:27:08,963 --> 01:27:12,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1075
01:27:12,764 --> 01:27:15,004
[SPEAKER_11]: When I left early this morning, it was still there.

1076
01:27:15,104 --> 01:27:17,065
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm glad they took care of it right away.

1077
01:27:17,225 --> 01:27:18,105
[SPEAKER_11]: They knew this was coming.

1078
01:27:18,425 --> 01:27:18,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1079
01:27:19,245 --> 01:27:22,646
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm glad to hear what was done, Mr. President.

1080
01:27:22,686 --> 01:27:24,006
[SPEAKER_16]: I received the same call.

1081
01:27:27,095 --> 01:27:29,817
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm glad to hear that the tree was definitely a public safety concern.

1082
01:27:29,837 --> 01:27:31,157
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm glad to hear it's been removed.

1083
01:27:31,177 --> 01:27:34,700
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1084
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:35,820
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favour?

1085
01:27:36,761 --> 01:27:37,461
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1086
01:27:37,521 --> 01:27:38,802
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, I apologize.

1087
01:27:38,822 --> 01:27:39,542
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, sir.

1088
01:27:39,582 --> 01:27:40,883
[SPEAKER_12]: Name and address of the record, please.

1089
01:27:40,903 --> 01:27:42,204
[SPEAKER_12]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave.

1090
01:27:42,884 --> 01:27:46,426
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Tree City, one of the Tree City Americas, there's a lot of them.

1091
01:27:46,907 --> 01:27:51,289
[SPEAKER_12]: But City Hall has bragging rights again this year in Tree City.

1092
01:27:51,309 --> 01:27:55,732
[SPEAKER_12]: And what I'm concerned about is people know that last year I saved a tree that wasn't supposed to be taken down.

1093
01:27:56,897 --> 01:27:57,918
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Falco.

1094
01:27:57,938 --> 01:28:00,399
[SPEAKER_12]: If that one was hollowed out, we don't want to have problems.

1095
01:28:00,459 --> 01:28:04,941
[SPEAKER_12]: When I first moved here, the tree in front of my house was rotting and the wires came down.

1096
01:28:05,001 --> 01:28:05,302
[SPEAKER_12]: That was 2003, 2004.

1097
01:28:05,882 --> 01:28:12,846
[SPEAKER_12]: So there was a tree hearing and I went to it and on Paris Street, there's a beautiful tree.

1098
01:28:12,886 --> 01:28:13,906
[SPEAKER_12]: Now this tree is healthy.

1099
01:28:14,446 --> 01:28:15,647
[SPEAKER_12]: The street is a mess.

1100
01:28:16,387 --> 01:28:18,789
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's a petition to take the tree down.

1101
01:28:19,309 --> 01:28:24,632
[SPEAKER_12]: My concern with it is the street itself is a mess and is a big hazard, a bigger hazard than any tree.

1102
01:28:25,197 --> 01:28:28,699
[SPEAKER_12]: You can pave around the trees, you can put a handicapped access.

1103
01:28:28,739 --> 01:28:32,460
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of information, Councilor Scarpelli.

1104
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:42,225
[SPEAKER_04]: At the podium, Paris Street, I talked to the city engineer today, it's ready for some work and repaving, so pretty excited about that.

1105
01:28:43,118 --> 01:28:45,660
[SPEAKER_12]: That's great to hear, Councilor Scarpelli.

1106
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:49,243
[SPEAKER_12]: That is great to hear because the streets around there have been hazardous.

1107
01:28:49,843 --> 01:28:53,586
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would like to see, if we're Tree City USA, I just want to see the good, healthy trees.

1108
01:28:54,126 --> 01:29:01,912
[SPEAKER_12]: If the roots are coming up, we need to pave around them, build a nice way to keep the tree preserved because it's the tallest tree on Parris Street.

1109
01:29:02,413 --> 01:29:04,855
[SPEAKER_12]: But it is great to see that Medford cares about trees.

1110
01:29:04,915 --> 01:29:06,496
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to see that we protect the good ones.

1111
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:07,156
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1112
01:29:08,237 --> 01:29:11,139
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1113
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:11,720
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1114
01:29:12,855 --> 01:29:13,615
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1115
01:29:14,316 --> 01:29:21,980
[SPEAKER_17]: Offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the street be repaired at 496 Winthrop Street in the interest of public safety.

1116
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:23,841
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Mox.

1117
01:29:24,741 --> 01:29:25,782
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1118
01:29:25,862 --> 01:29:40,069
[SPEAKER_16]: I know Councilor Knight brought up this issue last week, but I received an email from a resident that lives at 496 Winthrop Street that stated that the street in front of his home is in deplorable condition.

1119
01:29:40,594 --> 01:29:43,657
[SPEAKER_16]: You also referred to the corner of Wildwood and Woodford.

1120
01:29:44,157 --> 01:29:56,289
[SPEAKER_16]: I know Councilor Knight brought that up last week, and I would ask that because of the utility excavation that's going on there, that that area be looked at immediately, Mr. President, in the interest of public safety.

1121
01:29:57,050 --> 01:30:00,052
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Mogg, seconded by Councilor Falco, all in favor.

1122
01:30:00,653 --> 01:30:01,394
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1123
01:30:01,454 --> 01:30:05,778
[SPEAKER_17]: Offered by Vice President Mogg, be it resolved that the missing cement sidewalk from

1124
01:30:08,749 --> 01:30:10,230
[SPEAKER_17]: 63 Bowen Avenue be replaced.

1125
01:30:10,831 --> 01:30:11,691
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Mox.

1126
01:30:12,812 --> 01:30:13,833
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1127
01:30:14,454 --> 01:30:16,696
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the sidewalk I referred to earlier.

1128
01:30:17,296 --> 01:30:24,682
[SPEAKER_16]: They removed a tree and just left the vacant hole there for some time now.

1129
01:30:25,403 --> 01:30:29,866
[SPEAKER_16]: And this definitely needs to be re-cemented in the interest of public safety.

1130
01:30:30,927 --> 01:30:32,409
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a very hazardous trip and fall.

1131
01:30:34,130 --> 01:30:35,831
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Marks.

1132
01:30:35,851 --> 01:30:36,152
[SPEAKER_17]: Second.

1133
01:30:37,489 --> 01:30:38,530
[SPEAKER_17]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

1134
01:30:38,550 --> 01:30:39,050
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1135
01:30:39,070 --> 01:30:39,170
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

1136
01:30:39,890 --> 01:30:40,851
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1137
01:30:41,691 --> 01:30:42,792
[SPEAKER_17]: Offered by Councilor Marks.

1138
01:30:43,492 --> 01:30:48,174
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it resolved that the stump at 6466 Bowen Avenue be removed.

1139
01:30:48,514 --> 01:30:54,157
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it further resolved that the sidewalk at 8789 Bowen Avenue be replaced in the interest of public safety.

1140
01:30:54,217 --> 01:30:55,138
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Marks.

1141
01:30:55,398 --> 01:30:56,278
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1142
01:30:56,318 --> 01:30:56,998
[SPEAKER_16]: The sidewalk at 8789

1143
01:30:58,807 --> 01:31:01,728
[SPEAKER_16]: was dug up, according to the resident, about four months ago.

1144
01:31:02,468 --> 01:31:08,831
[SPEAKER_16]: And now there's just some orange cones sitting out there with a giant hole waiting for someone to fall into it.

1145
01:31:09,691 --> 01:31:11,992
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would ask that DPW go out there immediately.

1146
01:31:12,892 --> 01:31:27,557
[SPEAKER_16]: And the tree stump, just for my expertise as an arborist, which I'm not, looks like it's been there for about 25 years based on the outer coating of the stump itself.

1147
01:31:28,094 --> 01:31:34,416
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would ask that that stump, Mr. President, be ground down immediately in the interest of public safety.

1148
01:31:34,956 --> 01:31:44,300
[SPEAKER_16]: I also, Mr. President, I need to say, in an agenda that had some 18 items, over a third of the items are for tree stump and sidewalks.

1149
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:48,081
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, there's much more, and those are important issues.

1150
01:31:48,634 --> 01:31:52,477
[SPEAKER_16]: but those are the day to day issues that should be attended to by the city.

1151
01:31:52,777 --> 01:32:17,395
[SPEAKER_16]: There's much more important issues regarding zoning, public safety, airplane noise, uh, things that we should be attending to and discussing and really not bogging down, uh, our agenda with issues that should be, you know, it should be an automatic, uh, you know, so I would hope that the process, uh, regarding the sidewalks and streets, uh, especially with,

1152
01:32:18,380 --> 01:32:22,804
[SPEAKER_16]: the 3-1-1 system where residents can actually reach directly out.

1153
01:32:23,264 --> 01:32:26,146
[SPEAKER_16]: The whole reason why we did 3-1-1, does the council remember?

1154
01:32:27,007 --> 01:32:31,450
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a way that the residents can interact with the city and then get a response.

1155
01:32:32,651 --> 01:32:39,777
[SPEAKER_16]: So that tells me one of two things, Mr. President, that the 3-1-1 system is not working and that needs to be revisited.

1156
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:44,624
[SPEAKER_16]: or that, as was mentioned earlier, that we don't have the manpower.

1157
01:32:44,644 --> 01:32:47,266
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it was Mr. McKillop that mentioned that.

1158
01:32:47,666 --> 01:33:02,219
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't have the manpower to handle the need that we have in a city that's, you know, seven square miles with 56,000 people in it, Mr. President, and something needs to be done.

1159
01:33:03,043 --> 01:33:04,083
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1160
01:33:04,123 --> 01:33:08,445
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Vice President Marx, seconded by Councilor Falco, all in favor.

1161
01:33:09,106 --> 01:33:10,866
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, Mr. McKellar, I apologize.

1162
01:33:11,167 --> 01:33:12,127
[SPEAKER_15]: No worries, no worries.

1163
01:33:13,207 --> 01:33:20,851
[SPEAKER_15]: My question on the 311 call, where does it go into and who's monitoring it and what kind of a graph comes out of that?

1164
01:33:21,351 --> 01:33:25,393
[SPEAKER_15]: Where is that list of all of those items and the age of those items?

1165
01:33:25,433 --> 01:33:30,355
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I believe that if you actually take the list, if it's done, if it's there, if it's somewhere,

1166
01:33:31,455 --> 01:33:42,801
[SPEAKER_15]: And you go by the age of the issues and you start to break them down I believe it should be very palatable to get these things done in in a seasonal Seasonable manner and putting it into the budget.

1167
01:33:43,181 --> 01:33:47,903
[SPEAKER_15]: So so if if the first season of the first quarter

1168
01:33:48,393 --> 01:33:53,914
[SPEAKER_15]: You get 10 of those sidewalks that are 15, 20 years old that are issues, you get them out of the way.

1169
01:33:54,234 --> 01:33:57,135
[SPEAKER_15]: Then you work on the next 5 to 10 year old ones, you get those out of the way.

1170
01:33:57,175 --> 01:34:01,616
[SPEAKER_15]: Then you work on the next 1, 2, 3, 4 year old ones, and you get those out of the way.

1171
01:34:03,056 --> 01:34:08,237
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no rhyme or reason as to the way we do this as far as I can see.

1172
01:34:08,677 --> 01:34:09,638
[SPEAKER_15]: So where are the 311s going?

1173
01:34:11,338 --> 01:34:12,419
[SPEAKER_15]: What list is it on?

1174
01:34:13,019 --> 01:34:15,701
[SPEAKER_15]: What is the chronological age of each of these items?

1175
01:34:15,841 --> 01:34:17,322
[SPEAKER_15]: And how do we, how do we attack this?

1176
01:34:17,362 --> 01:34:18,483
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's really what we need to do.

1177
01:34:18,943 --> 01:34:24,087
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it's just, again, common sense, looking at the problems, breaking them down so it's more palatable.

1178
01:34:24,407 --> 01:34:26,528
[SPEAKER_15]: You can fit them into the budget so it's easy to do.

1179
01:34:26,908 --> 01:34:31,772
[SPEAKER_15]: And you let the people know it's coming and we're doing it and we're working on it.

1180
01:34:31,952 --> 01:34:32,252
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1181
01:34:32,892 --> 01:34:33,313
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1182
01:34:36,075 --> 01:34:38,936
[SPEAKER_17]: Offered by Vice President Moxby, resolved at the sidewalk at 63

1183
01:34:40,061 --> 01:34:42,823
[SPEAKER_17]: Tentistry be replaced in the interest of public safety.

1184
01:34:43,163 --> 01:34:44,204
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice president mocks.

1185
01:34:44,844 --> 01:34:49,967
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, Mr. President, uh, the concrete was broken up and removed, uh, sometime back.

1186
01:34:50,688 --> 01:34:54,050
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh, there is just a hole there waiting for new cement.

1187
01:34:54,610 --> 01:35:02,275
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, it's been over several months and, uh, in the interest of public safety, uh, that should be, uh, uh, replaced immediately.

1188
01:35:02,295 --> 01:35:02,835
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President.

1189
01:35:03,715 --> 01:35:04,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco.

1190
01:35:04,656 --> 01:35:05,457
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1191
01:35:05,477 --> 01:35:07,818
[SPEAKER_11]: I have received this, uh, call about this as well.

1192
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:11,001
[SPEAKER_11]: and went down to take a look at the situation.

1193
01:35:12,142 --> 01:35:16,464
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the Councilor said, it's just a hole in the ground and there's no curb in there.

1194
01:35:17,005 --> 01:35:23,008
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess a few years ago they tried to plant the tree there, but the tree literally just fell out because there's no curbing to hold the soil in.

1195
01:35:23,548 --> 01:35:25,269
[SPEAKER_11]: So really the curb needs to be replaced.

1196
01:35:25,289 --> 01:35:28,030
[SPEAKER_11]: There really needs to be a strategy, I think, for Bowen Street in general.

1197
01:35:29,211 --> 01:35:32,893
[SPEAKER_11]: Like Councilor Marks mentioned, I took a drive there as well, the sidewalks are really

1198
01:35:33,524 --> 01:35:34,205
[SPEAKER_11]: bad shade.

1199
01:35:34,285 --> 01:35:36,006
[SPEAKER_17]: There's some flooding issues on Bowling Avenue also.

1200
01:35:36,026 --> 01:35:36,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1201
01:35:36,266 --> 01:35:45,554
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, a lot of the sidewalks look like they might just need a skim coat, but I mean, just because a few, they just kind of, the top's gone, but there's other, there's other sidewalks that are just completely gone.

1202
01:35:45,894 --> 01:35:46,775
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1203
01:35:46,815 --> 01:35:50,998
[SPEAKER_17]: The upper part of Bowling Avenue has some pretty serious flooding issues when it rains.

1204
01:35:51,018 --> 01:35:53,760
[SPEAKER_17]: So I know they're in the midst of addressing those also.

1205
01:35:54,741 --> 01:35:58,444
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1206
01:35:59,305 --> 01:35:59,965
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor.

1207
01:36:00,986 --> 01:36:01,987
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1208
01:36:02,982 --> 01:36:04,002
[SPEAKER_17]: The table of records.

1209
01:36:05,923 --> 01:36:07,063
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President, I'm sorry.

1210
01:36:08,203 --> 01:36:08,704
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

1211
01:36:09,224 --> 01:36:14,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I just want to take a brief opportunity to thank the DPW for the restriping work that they've done on Woburn Street.

1212
01:36:14,725 --> 01:36:21,247
[SPEAKER_08]: We put a resolution forward last week asking that the four-way intersections on Woburn Street be repainted, and in short time, they were done.

1213
01:36:21,287 --> 01:36:26,008
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd like to thank Joe Palladino from the sign department and the members of the highway department for their work.

1214
01:36:27,289 --> 01:36:27,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1215
01:36:29,389 --> 01:36:30,049
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1216
01:36:30,069 --> 01:36:32,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to talk on that?

1217
01:36:33,673 --> 01:36:35,754
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, thank you.

1218
01:36:35,774 --> 01:36:36,874
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm president Caraviello.

1219
01:36:36,954 --> 01:36:42,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Just before we adjourn, I know that there is no school committee meeting on October 30th.

1220
01:36:42,515 --> 01:36:48,317
[SPEAKER_03]: So I see if we maybe take a vote to move our October 31st meeting to October 30th.

1221
01:36:48,377 --> 01:36:51,537
[SPEAKER_17]: If you'd like to make that into a motion.

1222
01:36:52,678 --> 01:36:53,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, please.

1223
01:36:53,598 --> 01:36:53,698
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1224
01:36:54,448 --> 01:37:03,335
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, that we change the October 31st meeting to October 30th.

1225
01:37:06,878 --> 01:37:07,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Dela Rosa.

1226
01:37:08,219 --> 01:37:10,061
[SPEAKER_09]: I would be opposed to that, Mr. President.

1227
01:37:10,101 --> 01:37:10,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1228
01:37:10,681 --> 01:37:17,307
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wouldn't hold it against any councilor who wanted to spend one evening with their children to do it.

1229
01:37:17,327 --> 01:37:21,250
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think the people have reasonable expectation that we meet on Tuesday nights.

1230
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:24,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, it's been a constant practice.

1231
01:37:25,223 --> 01:37:33,048
[SPEAKER_09]: It's part of our rules and I'll see this, uh, uh, uh, as a compelling reason to change the date of meeting.

1232
01:37:34,069 --> 01:37:34,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1233
01:37:37,031 --> 01:37:37,792
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice president marks.

1234
01:37:38,793 --> 01:37:48,500
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, I was just wondering maybe if the Councilor or the council would be amendable to possibly meeting at six or six 30, um, uh, that night rather than seven o'clock.

1235
01:37:50,523 --> 01:37:51,964
[SPEAKER_16]: It's still, it's still a Tuesday.

1236
01:37:52,144 --> 01:37:54,245
[SPEAKER_16]: It's, you know, need an hour earlier.

1237
01:37:54,265 --> 01:37:57,927
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't, I think that makes it worse.

1238
01:37:59,247 --> 01:37:59,927
[SPEAKER_16]: That makes it worse.

1239
01:37:59,948 --> 01:38:00,788
[SPEAKER_16]: It makes it worse.

1240
01:38:01,128 --> 01:38:01,348
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1241
01:38:01,508 --> 01:38:01,748
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1242
01:38:02,709 --> 01:38:02,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1243
01:38:06,791 --> 01:38:07,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

1244
01:38:07,611 --> 01:38:12,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I was just going to say that I have no problem coming on Tuesday night.

1245
01:38:12,573 --> 01:38:18,656
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's one of the sacrifices that we make if we have the privilege and opportunity to serve as Councilors that sometimes we have to spend time away from our family.

1246
01:38:19,217 --> 01:38:20,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but with that being said,

1247
01:38:20,654 --> 01:38:24,036
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that I can still get some trick or treating in between five and seven.

1248
01:38:24,056 --> 01:38:26,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, my kids are young, but I'm moving it to an earlier time.

1249
01:38:26,817 --> 01:38:27,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Wouldn't work out so well for me.

1250
01:38:28,658 --> 01:38:28,958
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1251
01:38:29,078 --> 01:38:42,985
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by council, I'm going to go current that we move the October 31st meeting to October 30th, seconded by seconded by councilor Scarpelli.

1252
01:38:45,106 --> 01:38:49,528
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor, the chair seems to be in doubt.

1253
01:38:50,644 --> 01:38:52,152
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Clerk, could you please call the roll?

1254
01:38:58,836 --> 01:38:59,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Dello Russo.

1255
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:04,778
[SPEAKER_05]: You forecast my vote, Mr. President, and I want to declare that this is- Mr. Dello Russo, again.

1256
01:39:04,938 --> 01:39:15,361
[SPEAKER_09]: That if the Councilor were to be absent, again, I state that there is in no way, shape, or form that I would consider her to be shirking on her responsibilities.

1257
01:39:15,741 --> 01:39:22,103
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I think it's laudatory that a parent would want to be with their child on such an auspicious occasion.

1258
01:39:22,663 --> 01:39:23,063
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1259
01:39:24,563 --> 01:39:25,644

1262
01:39:29,660 --> 01:39:41,028
[SPEAKER_02]: If I may, no, I actually may have a problem with everyone, at least, that's why.

01:39:41,068 --> 01:39:41,168
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
