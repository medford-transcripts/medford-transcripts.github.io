    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=519.226s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=521.269s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Ravuto, for coming to explain this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=523.59s">Maybe</a>  just a little more detail about what type of cameras, how many we're purchasing, what they're going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=528.132s">Just</a>  a little more detail.</p>

    <p>[cCMLP2REW0g_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=529.653s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=530.533s">Three</a>  high quality commercial grade infrared night vision cameras that are what they call quick deploy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=538.257s">It</a>  means that we can set them up and move them very simply. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=541.298s">They're</a>  self-contained. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=542.298s">They</a>  come with a router. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=543.419s">They</a>  transmit to our cellular data network. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=545.96s">They'll</a>  be monitored at the police station, and hopefully we'll get a receiver at City Hall in the near future.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=551.718s">And</a>  if you could, what's the reasoning for getting the cameras? <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=555.965s">What</a>  are we going to be doing with them?</p>

    <p>[cCMLP2REW0g_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=558.388s">We're</a>  going to monitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=559.43s">We</a>  have a lot of dumping sites throughout the city that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=562.635s">We</a>  have some favorite sites that go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=564.397s">We've</a>  had a few problems downtown recently with <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=568.351s">Uh,</a>  small thievery, petty stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=570.292s">Some</a>  elderly people have been slightly harassed by the people hanging out in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=575.714s">So</a>  we hope that they have the cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=577.355s">We'll</a>  be able to let us see anybody caught in the act of bothering somebody or stealing anything, any criminal activity.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=584.658s">So</a>  there'll be portable and we'll be able, you'll be able to move them around and that's correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=589.86s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=590.24s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=592.721s">Councilor</a>  Knife. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=594.182s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much, Mr. Babuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=596.103s">Thank</a>  you for that presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=597.875s">Ultimately,</a>  Mr. President, this council has requested the purchase of portable security cameras for the purpose of code enforcement on numerous occasions in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=606.078s">Here</a>  we have an opportunity to appropriate the funding to make that a reality and move approval.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=610.239s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=611.099s">Vice</a>  President Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=614.26s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=615.36s">As</a>  Councilman Knight just mentioned, this has been a request of this council for the past several years, and I would hope that, I know these are portable, <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=624.193s">But</a>  I would hope that one of the first stops will be Commercial Street and the dumping that has taken place on Commercial Street over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=633.5s">And</a>  I would hope that would be one of the first stops.</p>

    <p>[cCMLP2REW0g_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=636.222s">It</a>  is absolutely high on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=638.624s">Yes,</a>  it is.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=639.645s">That</a>  area is notorious for all sorts of garbage refrigerators, you name it, sofas, everything shows up on that street because it's poorly lit at night and there's not much traffic there at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=653.54s">It's</a>  a constant problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=656.001s">I</a>  support this wholeheartedly, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=660.082s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=660.882s">Again,</a>  I follow my colleagues in this endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=663.483s">I</a>  think that what we'll get back in fines and penalties would be tenfold, and I think it would be automatically. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=671.366s">So</a>  I appreciate your work in making this come to fruition, and I support this wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=678.408s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[cCMLP2REW0g_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=679.138s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=679.978s">I</a>  believe this is just a start. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=681.299s">I</a>  think that what we're going to get from these three cameras is going to show us how valuable they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=685.761s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=686.502s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=687.502s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=688.362s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=689.763s">Mr.</a>  Bavuzzo, thank you very much for your report as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=692.745s">Um,</a>  I, this is something I support a hundred percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=696.346s">Uh,</a>  we've needed this for a long time and I know this council has talked about this repeatedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=700.828s">Um,</a>  I just have a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=702.569s">As</a>  far as the cameras go, I mean, how many, we're starting off with three. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=705.871s">I</a>  mean, ideally do you think we could use more?</p>

    <p>[cCMLP2REW0g_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=709.002s">Ideally</a>  could and then these are high-quality camera. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=712.264s">They</a>  are about $3,000 a little more than $3,000 each So we'd like to get the cameras and use make sure they're working up to our expectations Begin collecting some money back for them.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=722.43s">Okay,</a>  great And as far as um, you know, it's fine just thinking as far as the future goes and from a budgeting perspective Do you know what the life expectancy is for one of these cameras, especially if they're outside? <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=732.036s">I</a>  mean, I'm just you know, is this something they have to purchase on a pretty regular basis? <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=735.378s">I</a> </p>

    <p>[cCMLP2REW0g_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=736.3s">I</a>  don't know what the life expectancy is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=738.761s">A</a>  company that we're contracted to does all the maintenance and warranty work on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=743.423s">So</a>  again, it's a high quality commercial grade camera that used throughout the city of Boston, the city of Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=748.986s">So</a>  we have looked at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=750.407s">I</a>  don't know what the life period is, but they're made for exposure to the elements.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=954.004s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=955.004s">Uh,</a>  this is probably the third time I've offered this as a council resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=960.2s">that</a>  we receive an update on the proposal that was submitted by this administration back I think it was roughly a year ago myself and I know there were a couple other members of the City Council attended a meeting up here that talked about purchasing a device on behalf of the community that would be able to gauge where leaks are coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=988.868s">and</a>  to have a systematic approach to replacing the water pipes where they're leaking in order to save the beleaguered ratepayers some money, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1000.418s">So</a>  I ask, my first request is to ask where we stand on the leak detection program that was proposed to this council some time back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1011.767s">It's</a>  also, Mr. President, to once again ask <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1016.422s">that</a>  we take a full look at our infrastructure when it comes to water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1024.387s">Just</a>  for the edification of the viewing audience, the water for 2017 this year was assessed at $6,432,219. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1031.331s">That</a>  is no increase over 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1043.745s">On</a>  the suicide for 2017, the assessment was $11,878,789. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1046.107s">That</a>  was an increase of $525,541, which is a 4.6% increase over 2016 on the suicide. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1048.229s">And</a>  the combined assessment that the rate payers in this community, every taxpayer is paying for, <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1072.401s">is</a>  a water and sewer assessment is $18,311,008. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1074.082s">And</a>  of which we also add in the expense of the water and sewer division, which is $5,635,854 bringing the total budget for water and sewer for 2017 to $23,946,862. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1099.519s">The</a>  reason why I bring this up tonight, Mr. President, as we all know, the MWRA back, I believe it was about a year ago, stated that Medford had approximately 20% for unaccounted for water in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1113.488s">And</a>  as part of unaccounted for water, that consists of leaks that are taking place, and that's why I'm calling for an update on the leak detection program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1123.047s">It</a>  also takes into consideration other usage in the community that's not needed right now, which are many of our hydrants throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1133.851s">And</a>  it also takes into consideration and accounted for water, the municipal and school side, Mr. President, which used to be part of their budget respectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1145.095s">So</a>  the schools would pay for a water and sewer bill depending on the water they used. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1150.137s">And</a>  the last figure I received, <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1152.43s">uh,</a>  and this is from 2017, I believe the school side, uh, based on a tier two system, uh, their water and sewer bill was $190,457. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1164.597s">Now</a>  we all know that that used to be part of the school department budget and back some years ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1173.312s">They</a>  took it out of the budget and stopped considering it an operating expense and just passed it off to the ratepayers on the water and sewer side as unaccounted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1184.943s">But</a>  indeed, Mr. President, it's not unaccounted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1188.387s">It</a>  is needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1189.528s">We</a>  know where the water's coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1192.551s">And</a>  in my opinion, it sends out an awful message. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1195.344s">when</a>  we're talking about conservation and ways to better utilize our resources, when you have a school department or a municipality that really doesn't pay for the water and sewer because they pass the burden on to the rate payer, I think sends an awful message, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1214.096s">And</a>  it should be accounted for under the accounting principles within a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1219.599s">So</a>  according to the MWRA, 20% of our water that we take in, 20% of that <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1225.647s">$6,432,219</a>  is unaccounted for water. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1226.568s">That's</a>  roughly $1,200,000 in unaccounted for water, of which about $393,000, almost $400,000 is from the municipal and the school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1245.546s">in</a>  800,000 of leaks that are happening under our roads, Mr. President, and things that we really need to have a leak detection program in order to cut that cost down and pass that savings onto the ratepayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1261.801s">And</a>  so tonight, Mr. President, I ask that we, first of all, get an update on the leak detection program, where it stands right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1272.745s">I</a>  once again ask, and I've asked a half a dozen times, that water and sewer need to be included, Mr. President, in the operating budget of both the municipal and the school sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1285.513s">That</a>  should happen without any say. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1288.154s">That</a>  should be an automatic, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1292.217s">If</a>  we're going to ask ratepayers to, depending on what tier they fall in, <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1297.542s">If</a>  they use less water, they can save on their bill and also conserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1303.746s">We</a>  should also be demanding the same from the municipality and from the school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1308.528s">That</a>  should be a given. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1310.67s">So</a>  I would ask that it be included back into the operating expense for the water for the schools and for City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1320.395s">As</a>  part of that $400,000 I alluded to, the schools was $190,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1325.812s">The</a>  municipal buildings, about 43,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1331.493s">Irrigation,</a>  which is probably 95%. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1333.773s">Our</a>  parks is 152,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1336.254s">And</a>  then in our different fire stations throughout the community, a little over 6,000, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1344.355s">So</a>  if you add that up, it comes to about 393,000, almost 400,000 in water and sewer consumption that we know where it's coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1355.204s">It's</a>  needed, and it should be part of an operating expense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1359.186s">So</a>  I'd put that in the form of a motion that we get a response back on those questions immediately on behalf of the ratepayers of this community, Mr. President, that are paying thousands of dollars in water sewer a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1372.853s">And</a>  if there's a way we can save money through I&I inflow <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1400.163s">in</a>  an account just for that purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1402.845s">The</a>  water and sewer enterprise account was created for that purpose, to offset rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1408.509s">This</a>  is the state legislature that created it, not myself, not this council, to offset rates and to do infrastructure improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1416.855s">What</a>  better improvement, Mr. President, to tighten up a system that rate payers are paying millions of dollars a year for unaccounted for water and for INI, inflow and infiltration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1429.212s">What</a>  better use of that money? <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1431.113s">I</a>  don't know anyone that would stand up against that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1434.295s">Instead,</a>  that money is sitting in an account, just sitting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1438.357s">And</a>  every day that goes by is an injustice to every resident in this community that's paying a water and sewer bill, as far as I'm concerned, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1446.602s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1477.866s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1479.567s">I</a>  think this is something that we had asked for to be funded one way or another several months back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1487.225s">I</a>  believe there was one maybe subcommittee meeting on it, but I think it's something that needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1492.308s">I</a>  then asked a question of, can we work on our zoning one section at a time? <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1496.91s">I</a>  know we're the ones that, which update the ordinances, but we were told in a written decision that that would be spot zoning, but we are going to be approached with a number of projects coming down the line, which almost seems similar to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1514.42s">And</a>  I think it's something that, <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1516.127s">We</a>  need to have a commitment by the administration to hire an outside company to help guide us through this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1523.192s">I</a>  think we're all capable of going street by street and deciding which zoning changes we should make, but to handle this, which is gonna take, from what I understand, multiple years to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1538.382s">I</a>  know the city of Somerville, it took a couple years to get through the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1543.226s">We</a>  need some guidance and we need some commitment <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1545.713s">by</a>  the administration so we can move forward and get this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1549.336s">Hopefully</a>  it will be something that, you know, can be worked on once the funding is there at the beginning of the year by whoever may sit behind this rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1557.842s">But</a>  it's a project that we've all spoken in favor of doing, and it's something that needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1564.807s">So</a>  I ask that a portion be set aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1568.21s">She</a>  wants us to research different companies and the costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1571.832s">I'm</a>  sure we are capable of doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1574.384s">I</a>  think we need a commitment first that yes, we are, the administration's willing to put money aside so that we're able to do this.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1584.152s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1585.693s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1586.613s">I</a>  thank my colleague for bringing this issue forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1590.176s">I</a>  know that this has been one of the biggest questions as we go street to street and talking to residents and asking questions about our zoning laws and our ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1603.843s">I</a>  think that months back, when we first brought this issue up, one of the biggest concerns was the amount of money that a consultant would cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1612.85s">And</a>  I think we need that consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1614.971s">I</a>  think it's time that we do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1616.773s">But</a>  as neighboring communities have done, something that I've mentioned here in the past, they've used the Metropolitan Planning Council, that kind of set an agenda that they could follow to look at our <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1631.285s">our</a>  changing of zoning laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1633.546s">So</a>  I'd like to call for a meeting with maybe possibly bring in the Metropolitan Planning Council, a subcommittee meeting or a community of the whole meeting to bring that organization into just to ask them for some guidance in what they've done with other communities that had similar issues that we have here in Medford that some of our zoning and most of our zoning haven't been looked at in over 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1658.545s">I</a>  second my colleague's resolve, and I'd like to make an amendment to that, if she doesn't mind, that we call for a meeting with maybe a committee of the whole meeting relatively soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1670.51s">I</a>  know it's been a very difficult time for scheduling, but maybe set something up with a consultant from the Metropolitan Planning Council and ask them for some guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1681.094s">We're</a>  already a member of the council, and <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1685.687s">It's,</a>  it's free to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1687.187s">So</a>  I think that that might be an avenue that we could research and move forward with. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1690.988s">So</a>  again, I thank, thank council for bringing that forward.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1694.709s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1695.969s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1697.429s">This</a>  certainly has been a topic that's been brought up before and in previous times when the issue was brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1702.53s">Um,</a>  I, I had a question and the question was, what are we trying to accomplish? <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1707.491s">We're</a>  going to re we want to review our zoning laws, but what is it that we want to try to accomplish? <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1711.172s">And</a>  that started a conversation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1713.212s">And,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1714.014s">The</a>  subcommittee on zoning and ordinances has met a number of times, more than once, to discuss this very issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1720.259s">And</a>  one of the things that we've been doing is trying to develop goals and develop criteria for further debate and discussion as to what we feel is going to be important to put Medford in a position to be successful as we grow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1732.581s">One</a>  of the items that we've been discussing was the ability to ensure that we continue to generate between 1.25 and 1.5% new growth annually. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1741.547s">Another</a>  item that we've been looking upon, Mr. President, is the ability to expand upon commercially zoned parcels to ensure an equitable residential tax rate, an equitable shift of the residential tax burden to the commercial side. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1752.734s">We've</a>  also discussed the possibilities that we have to meet and exceed the state established thresholds for affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1760.429s">protecting</a>  the neighborhood's integrity and the historical assets in our community, as well as a few things that we're looking into with the technical assistance from the Metropolitan Area Planning Council with the draft plan to revitalize Method Square and soon to be work on the revitalization of Mystic Avenue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1779.044s">So</a>  there are a couple of items that are in the works here, and there's been a conversation that's been ongoing on this current topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1785.068s">And</a>  I think it was the desire of the subcommittee <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1787.451s">to</a>  establish these criteria, to go through the whole entire process, and then to report the paper out to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1793.137s">And</a>  once we have that paper ready to further debate and deliberate, we can send it to the administration and say, these are the goals we want to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1799.563s">What's</a>  it going to cost to get it done? <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1801.605s">So</a>  that's where we are in the process, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1803.367s">I</a>  thank the council for putting the measure forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1805.188s">I</a>  think it's a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1806.79s">We've</a>  done a lot of work on it, and we're going to continue to work on it, and we're going to continue to make this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1811.615s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1812.392s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1813.292s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1814.133s">And</a>  I thank council Longo for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1816.274s">It's</a>  an important issue that impacts the quality of life of all residents throughout our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1822.817s">You</a>  know, zoning is one of the biggest responsibilities we have here on the council and zoning hasn't been looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1829.02s">And</a>  I think it's close to 50 years and it needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1832.68s">And,</a>  uh, and I, and I, I did offer a paper on this earlier in the term, uh, with regard to, uh, having someone, uh, come in from the outside and take a look at, and you know, that paper did get moved to subcommittee where we have been looking at it and meeting on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1847.028s">And,</a>  um, you know, uh, but I do think it's important to continue the conversation to make sure that we keep it in the forefront. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1853.252s">So,</a>  um, you know, I, I do support the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1856.634s">I,</a>  I, I'm not sure as far as the next step, if we already have a resolution in subcommittee, <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1861.043s">what</a>  the next step would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1862.264s">I</a>  mean, I do support the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1863.725s">I</a>  think it's, it needs to be looked at without a doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1866.787s">Um,</a>  but, uh, so I do, I do support, uh, both resolutions fully. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1870.609s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1871.85s">Vice</a>  president Mox.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1873.731s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1875.072s">Um,</a>  you know, I, I first, let me say, I appreciate the role of the zoning subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1880.395s">They've</a>  done yeoman's work on this particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1883.077s">And</a>  as councilor Falco just alluded to, uh, this is something that really has been ignored for a lot of years in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1890.983s">And</a>  in my opinion, it's going to merit to bring in a consultant that handles zoning on a day-to-day and can advise us on what our steps are as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1904.67s">The</a>  only thing I'd state, and I realize this is something that's in subcommittee, is I think this issue is much larger than just a paper before a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1914.375s">I</a>  think this issue, Mr. President, impacts every walk of life in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1920.132s">And</a>  as we all know, zoning is the lifeline of a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1924.215s">And</a>  I think it's important while we saw in Cambridge the growth and expansion in Cambridge, we're witnessing it now in Somerville, which, you know, they probably don't have another piece of land to build on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1938.283s">We're</a>  experiencing it now in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1940.284s">We're</a>  going through it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1942.33s">And</a>  I think we have to react quicker than what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1946.372s">And</a>  it's no reflection on any one particular individual or any particular body in this community, but I think we really have to react. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1953.576s">And</a>  I think it's prudent to bring in a consultant that will sit down with this council and tell us where we begin. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1960.019s">It's</a>  great to get feedback, and that feedback can continue while this process happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1965.384s">But</a>  to sit back and wait for recommendations at this point, you know, the horse is already out of the barn. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1972.347s">We're</a>  experiencing the growth right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1974.689s">We're</a>  attending the ZBA meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1976.85s">We're</a>  hearing residents stand up and say, I don't want that particular development in my neighborhood based on the lack of parking, based on there's no setback, based on height, based on a number of things, Mr. President, that is concerning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1991.821s">You</a>  know, when you look at other communities, they're incorporated right within their zoning ordinances, car share. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=1998.944s">I</a>  believe Cambridge and Somerville have a car share program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2002.706s">So</a>  when projects come in in thickly settled areas in Cambridge, Somerville, and many other communities, it's part of their zoning that requires car share, which we refer to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2014.013s">as</a>  the zip cars, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2016.794s">You</a>  know, there's also solar share that's brought up, and many new initiatives now, when it comes to residential and commercial building and so forth, also calls for a solar share, as well as a car share. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2032.698s">And</a>  there's a lot of initiatives that we could include within our zoning ordinances to help alleviate some of the concern that we're hearing, at least I'm hearing, <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2042.179s">from</a>  residents when I go to these meetings about the fact that these projects don't fit the very fabric of their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2049.763s">And</a>  it's incumbent upon us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2051.644s">We</a>  have, I'd say, two major jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2054.345s">One</a>  set in the city budget, or approved in the city budget, and the second one is zoning, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2061.849s">They</a>  go hand in hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2063.47s">And</a>  we'd be remiss if we sat back any longer while this city's gonna go through a building boom <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2070.423s">and</a>  is experiencing right now single families turning into three, four, five units. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2076.766s">It's</a>  happening throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2078.807s">You</a>  know, a lot that was built with a single family home, as we saw in the Lawrence estates, turns into two giant homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2085.89s">These</a>  are the concerns that I hear from residents and we have to have a way as a council to say, you know what, <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2091.846s">We're</a>  not Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2092.906s">We're</a>  not Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2094.006s">We</a>  want to make sure whatever happens in our community is something that we can all agree upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2098.787s">And</a>  whatever new growth happens, whatever direction we go in, that it's going to be sensible for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2105.208s">And</a>  that people are going to rest assured that when they moved to this community, they moved here for a reason, because of our open space, because of our schools, because of our parks, because of all the natural resources of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2117.911s">And</a>  I don't want to lose that very fabric that I think <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2121.187s">people</a>  move to this community for. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2123.108s">So</a>  again, I support this whole heartily. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2126.009s">I</a>  know it's been offered a number of times by other members of the council to bring someone on board, whether it's MPAC or whether it's any other organization or a private consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2137.015s">Really,</a>  it doesn't matter to me as long as we bring in an expert that can guide us along this very arduous process of really looking through hundreds and hundreds of pages of local zoning that <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2148.933s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2165.471s">I'm</a>  glad that we're talking about zoning and I hope that we move past talking, but when we look for someone to bring in, we need to make sure that that group is independent and non-biased. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2174.795s">We</a>  need to make sure that the zoning reforms that we make are Medford-centric and benefit Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2180.377s">Everyone</a>  talked about all the development that's happening in the city, but what I heard was residential, residential, residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2186.459s">What's</a>  different between our development and Somerville and Cambridge's development is that they are very conscious of maintaining a balance of commercial and residential and making sure that they're able to support the infrastructure, the increased needs, the quality of life items that residents require and should have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2205.567s">So</a>  I think that's really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2207.388s">We</a>  need to think about that as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2210.249s">I</a>  haven't spoke to one single resident that said, I really hope they sell the house next door to me and put up an apartment building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2216.214s">But</a>  we have people living in homes right now that are in apartment zones that that very thing could happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2222.418s">And</a>  if you've ever seen a resident who's heard that there's going to be a 12-unit building shading their home, it's very traumatizing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2229.904s">And</a>  there's nothing that we can do because of the way that the zoning is written. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2233.506s">Right</a>  now, what's happening as we're waiting, this is already happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2238.044s">People,</a>  developers are coming, they're proposing what they want to do, they're going to the ZBA, they're getting multiple, multiple variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2244.872s">And</a>  we see that when you have variances in commercial areas where you add residential, that it can cause problems adding commercial in later. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2251.72s">We</a>  had a Dog for Days group that couldn't come in because they were abutting an apartment building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2257.847s">We</a>  had a meeting about the Wegmans and there were resident concerns about loading dock hours because the residents were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2265.112s">So</a>  I'm very cautious about what happens with Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2268.674s">Of</a>  course, the first proposal that came out <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2270.892s">was</a>  500 units of apartments on Mystic Avenue, dead center of nine parcels, which will impact our ability to develop commercially. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2280.137s">And</a>  we need to stop being the city where developers believe that they can come in and make their own zoning because we haven't updated the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2288.981s">So</a>  they're just gonna change it and do what they want, and we're gonna be left running behind.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2298.46s">Good</a>  evening, David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2301.564s">As</a>  far as the zoning goes, the only thing I would caution is that we actually have an understanding as to which direction we'd like to take the city as opposed to the zoning advisors coming in and telling us which direction to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2313.178s">The</a>  reason why I say that is because as any situation, if it's driven by tax and tax base, then you're going to see a lot of conversation about high rises and higher up condominiums. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2326.849s">When</a>  we're really trying to see what we can do about addressing the downtown areas and trying to keep the characters of those areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2333.077s">And</a>  there are certain areas of the city I'm sure that can actually be developed like Mystic Ave, mixed use, whatever it is that we want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2339.28s">But</a>  we have to have an understanding as a city in itself before this advisor comes in and we really should be able to tell them which direction we'd like the city to go and how do we get there as opposed to them telling us we think this is the way the city should go and this is how it's going to increase your tax base and this is what it's going to do to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2357.389s">So</a>  that's the one big thing that I would caution everyone to, you know, come together, figure out which direction the city should take and which direction it should go with all the five downtowns, with all the areas that we feel we can develop, whether it should be strictly a high rise or it should be mixed use. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2374.663s">Uh,</a>  I believe that, you know, we've got to address the middle class and what we can do about affordability and housing in the respect to that, not just low income as far as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2383.69s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2384.21s">Those</a>  issues are something that we need to go to the table with and making sure that we understand this is the direction we want Medford to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2390.572s">How</a>  do we get there? <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2391.853s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2392.613s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2394.894s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2395.314s">Name</a>  and address of the record please.</p>

    <p>[Joyce Paul]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2396.374s">Hi,</a>  Joyce Paul, 8 Mason Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2400.096s">I</a>  was at the last city council meeting and I went to the CPA meeting Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2407.35s">And</a>  Michael Marks, Councilor Marks, had brought up three things that I thought were very basic. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2412.555s">And</a>  he talked about the basics, the roads, the sidewalks, and getting a crossing, not guard, but a crossing thing that doesn't disappear in six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2425.487s">And</a>  that's a very big basic. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2428.329s">So</a>  when I went to the CPA meeting, I asked them, <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2431.421s">You</a>  know, they say, well, we can't do this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2433.483s">And</a>  I said, I understand that you can't do this and you can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2437.286s">But</a>  if there's any way you could do any of the basic things that we need, it makes more sense than coming up with something that maybe we don't really need, or at least we don't need before the basics. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2450.036s">So</a>  whether they will do it or not, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2453.038s">But</a>  I did bring it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2455.661s">And</a>  as far as the housing, and I'm very, very concerned about the housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2461.785s">A</a>  few years ago, I tried to help someone get senior housing, and it was impossible. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2467.646s">And</a>  I talked to the person who was the head of senior housing, and they had gotten about a four-unit housing for grandparents who had custody of their children because the children were sick. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2483.13s">There</a>  was a woman, and she had multiple sclerosis, and she gave custody to her <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2489.582s">her</a>  mother and father. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2491.343s">And</a>  I read there was an article in the Globe about the fact that because of the opioid crisis, there are so many more grandparents having custody of their children. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2501.588s">And</a>  I thought we have to do something for housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2504.689s">We</a>  could do that and it would be a small development and it would be something that we, you know, that we would need and it wouldn't bring in all the problems that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2516.781s">you</a>  know, that that would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2518.842s">So</a>  I brought some of the, unfortunately I can't go Saturday, but I hope you will go Saturday or at least get out there your opinion that we need the basics and we need limited housing, but maybe housing for seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2534.591s">So</a>  I'm going to leave some of these over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2537.073s">And</a>  if you don't go Saturday, maybe you could fill one of these out and, <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2541.837s">you</a>  know, drop it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2542.697s">All</a>  sorts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2543.477s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2545.118s">You</a>  guys are really good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2546.638s">I</a>  don't know how you can stand listening to all of us all the time.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2557.081s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2557.421s">Castagnetti,</a>  Cushman street, Method, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2564.57s">Speak</a>  back to the Mystic Ave zoning, I'd like to add some input. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2569.673s">I</a>  lived on Mystic Ave in 1955. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2572.255s">That</a>  was the old highways of Boston before they built Route 93 in 1960, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2580.42s">And</a>  about 1965, I come up with an idea, although I didn't have much in numbers of age or power. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2594.717s">The</a>  city, in my opinion, should have taken all of Mr. Gav on the east side by Eminent Domain at that time when we had the muscle and it was more affordable, even with a dirty 21E at the junkyard, presumably. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2611.75s">And</a>  then I'd have the developers go up whatever, 25, 35 stories high. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2617.194s">And</a>  if you worked here, <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2623.543s">You'd</a>  be at work now, Marshall Sloan took the idea 10 years ago with his billboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2629.405s">However,</a>  that never happened, and Mr. Gabb is underutilized, and it would be a goldmine if it was in New York City, or even for five miles north of Boston, which it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2643.89s">However,</a>  first of all, this new growth, real estate tax, <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2651.44s">To</a>  grow is wonderful because without growth, we start to go backwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2657.243s">However,</a>  when the new growth, when you don't use the new real estate taxes to offset prop two and a half increases, it doesn't help us who have been carrying the weight and paying real estate taxes for all these decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2670.41s">It</a>  actually hurts us infinitely because we need more police, more fire, school, buildings, pensions, infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2680.887s">And</a>  then, in the following year, they add 2.5 percent to a larger inflated number. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2687.89s">And</a>  I would have put a ring road on Mr. Gaff, keep him off Main Street, unless they wanted to go to Deepa Squally in those days. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2697.054s">Now,</a>  good luck with this new zoning, because it should have been done a long, long time ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2704.638s">But</a>  I must reiterate, the new growth does not help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2708.059s">It</a>  hurts us infinitely. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2710.294s">Thank</a>  you for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2711.034s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2712.115s">Councilor</a>  Longo, you're in.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2844.835s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2845.936s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2847.737s">There</a>  are a number of areas throughout the community that have had <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2851.115s">asphalt</a>  patchwork performed on cracking sidewalks, concrete sidewalks that have been removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2856.62s">And</a>  the theory behind it would be that we put a temporary patch down of asphalt sidewalk, and then when we have enough locations in the community that are in a certain area or region, we call the concrete truck up, and we get the concrete truck out there, and we break down these asphalt sidewalk patches, and we put concrete patches down, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2877.061s">And</a>  I think that enough time has passed now, but we do have enough locations across the city of Medford that could require one, two, maybe ten concrete trucks to get out there and start pouring concrete sidewalks, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2889.351s">We</a>  look at the Regency and the Rio Condominium buildings right on Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2894.374s">For</a>  two and a half years, they sat there and they had a gigantic drainage project performed right beside their house. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2901.54s">Their</a>  sidewalk was taken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2903.293s">replaced</a>  with an asphalt sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2905.294s">Two</a>  years have gone by. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2906.174s">The</a>  concrete sidewalk has not been replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2909.075s">You</a>  go up to Ashcroft Road, Mr. President, and you'll see in front of 129 a tree being removed, the stump being ground down, the sidewalk being replaced with asphalt. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2920.458s">I</a>  mean, with asphalt and concrete. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2921.819s">It</a>  still hasn't happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2922.759s">Two</a>  years have gone by. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2924.0s">So</a>  I think it's time, Mr. President, that we <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2925.878s">make</a>  a focus on this really basic city service and this real quality of life issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2929.781s">It's</a>  a curb appeal issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2931.622s">When</a>  you look out the window of your vehicle, when you're driving down the street, we like to see concrete sidewalks, not a patchwork of concrete and asphalt, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2938.908s">So</a>  I'm asking the DPW to report back to the council the following information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2943.411s">That</a>  is, when the replacement of the asphalt to concrete panels will be performed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2947.382s">and</a>  an inventory of those street panels, as well as when the concrete was initially removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2951.906s">So</a>  that we have a better idea as to how long this has been going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2954.988s">Um,</a>  and we can get a better understanding, Mr. President, um, as to how many street panels, how many panels it takes, um, before we call a concrete truck up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2965.336s">So,</a>  um, with that being said, I move for approval of resolution.</p>

    <p>[Ray Scarfo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2988.932s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2992.414s">Ray</a>  Scaffo, 9th Sunset Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2994.136s">I</a>  want to thank Councilman Knight for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=2998.199s">This</a>  morning I had shown a picture to the Council President about 39th Sunset Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3003.697s">Approximately</a>  about 50 feet of frontage and the whole sidewalk's been taken up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3008.298s">It's</a>  going on four months now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3010.119s">They</a>  totally framed it in and they haven't come back to pour the cement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3016.0s">There's</a>  also a couple of panels on the other side of the street that haven't been done as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3022.302s">It's</a>  a walk through to Tufts University up towards College Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3026.263s">A</a>  lot of people use that route. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3028.704s">The</a>  problem is they could walk up the street, but they have about 10 yards of gravel. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3033.207s">at</a>  the end of the street that butt up against the sidewalk as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3040.252s">The</a>  people in the area, well, they're concerned because now we're getting, like Councilor Dello Russo said, we only got a couple of weeks left before we can start pouring cement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3049.772s">So</a>  they're concerned about people gonna get hurt walking through. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3053.593s">Right</a>  now, it's a danger because a lot of leaves now are inside that pit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3059.595s">The</a>  pipes are sticking up where shutoffs for water, gas, or whatever on that sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3064.517s">So</a>  people can't see. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3065.958s">And</a>  if they start to walk in through the pit, somebody's gonna trip and fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3070.879s">The</a>  homeowner at 39 is called numerous times to City Hall <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3075.801s">And</a>  I think there was a contractor involved and has totally either disappeared or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3082.345s">So</a>  I would strongly recommend that the council send a letter to whomever to get this taken care of.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3090.549s">I</a>  did read that to the attention to Mr. Kearns this morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3093.751s">Hopefully</a>  he'll have an answer for me by tomorrow morning.</p>

    <p>[Ray Scarfo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3096.792s">And</a>  I appreciate it because the <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3100.886s">people,</a>  homeowners on the street are getting up in arms and they're ready to come up here full tilt. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3105.63s">So</a>  if you can get back to me as soon as possible, I'll stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3109.632s">I'll</a>  stop the rush. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3111.874s">Councilor</a>  Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3112.915s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3113.735s">I</a>  thank council for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3116.698s">This</a>  is an important public safety issue, especially if you don't have sidewalks, you're forcing people into the street and you're forcing kids into the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3123.843s">And</a>  sometimes that becomes an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3125.644s">Uh,</a>  over the last two weeks, this has come up as an issue where we've had sidewalks that need to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3131.306s">And</a>  we've asked for lists the last few weeks and a list should take literally a few minutes to produce. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3137.431s">You</a>  just have to print it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3138.392s">So</a>  if you could please, if we could just amend it to get an updated list with regard to the sidewalks that need to be replaced and how many have been replaced so far and how many stumps have been removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3150.161s">I</a>  mean, this is stuff that we have requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3153.324s">I</a>  know the last three meetings now we've requested this and we still have no information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3157.767s">So</a>  if we could please, <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3159.409s">just</a>  add that amendment to the resolution.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3160.91s">I</a>  greatly appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3161.991s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3162.932s">And</a>  it was this council who was asked several times for the city to put on a cement crew. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3168.076s">That</a>  should be working nine months a year because we certainly have enough sidewalks to keep a cement crew busy all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3175.622s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Lococo.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3180.926s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3181.666s">Just</a>  to be clear, Councilor Falco, what are you looking for for a timeframe on those lists from when we appropriated that large portion of money? <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3189.503s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3194.285s">I</a>  just want to make sure we're clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3195.366s">So</a>  we get what we exactly what we want.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3198.587s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3199.087s">Uh,</a>  we appropriated money, I believe in the spring for this and quite a, uh, quite a bit of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3204.87s">Uh,</a>  so if we could find just basically find out, I'd like to see what progress they've made from the list that we were given in the spring, what progress they've made to date, uh, because there were quite a few sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3217.198s">and</a>  stumps that needed to be removed and sidewalk panels that needed to be replaced and asphalt sidewalks that, some parts of the city actually have asphalt sidewalks, so those needed to be replaced as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3228.506s">And</a>  it'd be good to see what kind of progress they've made, how much money they've spent so far, how much is remaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3235.05s">You</a>  know, like it was, like we said earlier, I mean, the season is, you know, dwindling away to poor concrete. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3243.596s">So</a>  I'd really like to see you get an update as to what has, <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3246.868s">You</a>  know, with the progress has been so far.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3249.789s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3250.99s">Mr.</a>  President, I certainly have no problem with the paper being amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3253.571s">However,</a>  I'd ask you to be placed forward in the form of a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3258.253s">I</a>  want a complete inventory of all the asphalt street panels in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3261.915s">My</a>  concern isn't whether or not the funds that we appropriated earlier in the year, I believe it was $300,000 to take down some stumps and replace some <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3270.365s">sidewalks</a>  that were damaged during water service work, if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3274.547s">We're</a>  done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3275.008s">So</a>  I just want to keep them separate, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3277.089s">I</a>  certainly support Councilor Falco's amendments to the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3281.191s">I</a>  just would like to see them in a B paper so that the administration doesn't confuse the two issues and only give us one report.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3286.534s">Vice</a>  President Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3289.136s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3291.297s">This</a>  council has called for an audit of our streets and our sidewalks for the past several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3297.941s">To</a>  date, we have received <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3300.153s">uh,</a>  no correspondence from the city administration regarding either. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3304.616s">Um,</a>  you know, we talk about this and we've been talking about it for years, this sidewalk list, like it's some secretive list that's in a vault somewhere that no one can view, but it's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3317.123s">Residents</a>  aren't sure if they're on the sidewalk list. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3319.384s">They've</a>  been told they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3321.456s">Mr.</a>  President, why can't we have a list that's on the city website that's updated, that shows you what's being worked on, the progress? <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3331.286s">Why</a>  does it have to be this secretive list that we have to beg for to get a copy to see if things are actually working in this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3341.095s">There's</a>  no transparency at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3344.058s">And</a>  this has been the way <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3346.356s">And</a>  actually, in the past, Mr. President, I've actually voted against requests because I've asked, you know, DPW directors, can you show us what you want to spend this money on? <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3358.162s">How</a>  many sidewalks? <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3359.623s">How</a>  many stumps? <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3360.984s">And</a>  we couldn't get any answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3363.405s">And</a>  today, we're still continuing with the same format where, you know, you'll have a resident that calls you up and says, I've been told by City Hall I'm on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3373.511s">And</a>  I'll tell them, well, there's multiple lists. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3376.182s">I</a>  don't know what list you're on, but, uh, you may or may not be on a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3380.844s">Uh,</a>  it's just too confusing for residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3383.366s">It's</a>  confusing for this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3385.227s">I</a>  would ask if you want to do a C paper or D paper that, uh, this be put on the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3391.93s">So</a>  a resident can go on Mr. President and look and say, yes, <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3396.496s">32</a>  High Street is on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3398.538s">Yes,</a>  it was called in on February 2nd, they plan on getting it to October 3rd, and this is the status, it was closed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3407.023s">It</a>  seems to me a simple request to track, and by leaving it open-ended, no one knows in this community what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3415.629s">No</a>  one knows if this sidewalk's gonna get done, they don't really know if they're on the list or not, and until we do a complete audit, <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3424.082s">I</a>  have a couple of things on the resolution for this afternoon, and I know Councilor Falco does also. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3431.155s">Mr.</a>  President, I was on Bowen F to see one particular sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3436.397s">And</a>  honestly, an hour later, I viewed 25 different sidewalks, because residents kept on coming out and said, hey, look at this sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3443.943s">Hey,</a>  look, I'm supposed to be on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3445.564s">Hey,</a>  look, they dug this up five months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3447.306s">They</a>  never came back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3448.366s">All</a>  they put was orange cones out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3450.368s">And</a>  literally, that's a microcosm, that one street, on what's happening in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3457.593s">It's</a>  on every street, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3460.02s">And</a>  until we do a complete audit and come up with one list that's publicized on, uh, the city website or on local cable or wherever you want to put it, we're never going to get a handle on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3471.01s">We're</a>  never going to get a handle. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3472.091s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3472.992s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3473.632s">Do</a>  you want to make that an emotion of a C paper?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3475.814s">If</a>  he, if he wants to make it a C paper or part of this paper for the purpose of clarity, we'll make that a C paper.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3537.223s">David</a>  McKillop, 94 Rockland Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3539.685s">I</a>  didn't get a chance to say it before, but it's nice to see your houses all done over. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3543.107s">Very</a>  nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3543.447s">It's</a>  very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3544.108s">Glad</a>  to be home. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3545.348s">I'm</a>  sure you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3548.29s">It's</a>  the city's house. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3551.132s">As</a>  far as the sidewalks, I too have experienced several areas where people are just truly completely frustrated and fed up with the whole process of why they can't get anything completed in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3565.802s">My</a>  fear right now is the ADA compliance on some of these sidewalks is horrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3572.75s">It's</a>  dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3573.551s">I've</a>  seen wheelchairs literally go out on the street because they cannot pass on the sidewalks, on some of the sidewalks that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3580.959s">and</a>  the elderly and the darkness at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3584.4s">When</a>  a sidewalk is raised six to eight inches above where it normally should be and someone is walking down the street and it's dark, you can't see. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3590.981s">So</a>  first things first, there is a company out there and I can find the name of the company that will actually come in in an emergency situation and shave down the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3599.523s">So</a>  at the very least, until these things are fixed, we can shave the issues that we have so they'll be less likely to trip over them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3606.545s">So</a>  let's take some sort of action <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3609.065s">even</a>  if it's just something that's temporary and letting the people know that show us where the worst situation is and we can solve that for you by at least shaving the sidewalks down so no one can trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3619.675s">So</a>  let's start there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3621.197s">Then</a>  secondly, this complete streets project kind of really should change the name because in my eyes it's not very complete if we can't add the issues that we currently have in the city <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3632.247s">to</a>  the situation of the corners of every square and some of the sidewalks and some of the ADA. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3639.692s">If</a>  we're making the entrances onto the sidewalks ADA compliant, we should make the sidewalks ADA compliant. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=3644.896s">Enough</a>  is enough, we've got to fix this.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=4494.14s">Back</a>  to the main paper, Mr. President, I just wanted to chime in on what Councilor Scarpelli said, was that a number of locations were mentioned by citizens for up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=4508.208s">And</a>  I just want to urge the Chief, who, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, was amenable to these types of improvements, to move on them quickly and to expand the scope. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=4520.655s">I</a>  think there were three or four spots that had been mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=4523.573s">if</a>  I'm not mistaken, where these would be most helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=4529.287s">It</a>  was serious enough for a significant neighbourhood meeting and the people in there were very patient with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=4540.937s">It</a>  was a hot summer night and a lot of headway was made. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=4546.021s">A</a>  lot of people who offered really solid stuff and really solid assessments of what's going on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=4559.256s">And</a>  I just hope that we're able to implement some of these recommendations, have them hashed out in the traffic commission and moved on just to give these people some relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=4574.039s">It's</a>  a major regional issue there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=4577.24s">They're</a>  seeing it acutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=4580.12s">They</a>  shouldn't have to live under this type of disturbance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=4582.881s">So</a>  the slightest thing we can do to help them, I would recommend.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5455.398s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5456.318s">The</a>  sidewalk at 8789 <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5458.807s">was</a>  dug up, according to the resident, about four months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5462.468s">And</a>  now there's just some orange cones sitting out there with a giant hole waiting for someone to fall into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5469.691s">So</a>  I would ask that DPW go out there immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5472.892s">And</a>  the tree stump, just for my expertise as an arborist, which I'm not, looks like it's been there for about 25 years based on the outer coating of the stump itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5488.094s">So</a>  I would ask that that stump, Mr. President, be ground down immediately in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5494.956s">I</a>  also, Mr. President, I need to say, in an agenda that had some 18 items, over a third of the items are for tree stump and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5505.38s">I</a>  mean, there's much more, and those are important issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5508.634s">but</a>  those are the day to day issues that should be attended to by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5512.777s">There's</a>  much more important issues regarding zoning, public safety, airplane noise, uh, things that we should be attending to and discussing and really not bogging down, uh, our agenda with issues that should be, you know, it should be an automatic, uh, you know, so I would hope that the process, uh, regarding the sidewalks and streets, uh, especially with, <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5538.38s">the</a>  3-1-1 system where residents can actually reach directly out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5543.264s">The</a>  whole reason why we did 3-1-1, does the council remember? <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5547.007s">It</a>  was a way that the residents can interact with the city and then get a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5552.651s">So</a>  that tells me one of two things, Mr. President, that the 3-1-1 system is not working and that needs to be revisited. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5560.48s">or</a>  that, as was mentioned earlier, that we don't have the manpower. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5564.644s">I</a>  think it was Mr. McKillop that mentioned that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5567.666s">We</a>  don't have the manpower to handle the need that we have in a city that's, you know, seven square miles with 56,000 people in it, Mr. President, and something needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5583.043s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5584.123s">On</a>  the motion by Vice President Marx, seconded by Councilor Falco, all in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5589.106s">I'm</a>  sorry, Mr. McKellar, I apologize.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5591.167s">No</a>  worries, no worries. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5593.207s">My</a>  question on the 311 call, where does it go into and who's monitoring it and what kind of a graph comes out of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5601.351s">Where</a>  is that list of all of those items and the age of those items? <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5605.433s">Because</a>  I believe that if you actually take the list, if it's done, if it's there, if it's somewhere, <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5611.455s">And</a>  you go by the age of the issues and you start to break them down I believe it should be very palatable to get these things done in in a seasonal Seasonable manner and putting it into the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5623.181s">So</a>  so if if the first season of the first quarter <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5628.393s">You</a>  get 10 of those sidewalks that are 15, 20 years old that are issues, you get them out of the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5634.234s">Then</a>  you work on the next 5 to 10 year old ones, you get those out of the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5637.175s">Then</a>  you work on the next 1, 2, 3, 4 year old ones, and you get those out of the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5643.056s">There's</a>  no rhyme or reason as to the way we do this as far as I can see. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5648.677s">So</a>  where are the 311s going? <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5651.338s">What</a>  list is it on? <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5653.019s">What</a>  is the chronological age of each of these items? <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5655.841s">And</a>  how do we, how do we attack this? <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5657.362s">And</a>  that's really what we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5658.943s">You</a>  know, it's just, again, common sense, looking at the problems, breaking them down so it's more palatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5664.407s">You</a>  can fit them into the budget so it's easy to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5666.908s">And</a>  you let the people know it's coming and we're doing it and we're working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5671.952s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5672.892s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5676.075s">Offered</a>  by Vice President Moxby, resolved at the sidewalk at 63 <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5680.061s">Tentistry</a>  be replaced in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5683.163s">Vice</a>  president mocks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5684.844s">Again,</a>  Mr. President, uh, the concrete was broken up and removed, uh, sometime back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5690.688s">And,</a>  uh, there is just a hole there waiting for new cement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5694.61s">Uh,</a>  it's been over several months and, uh, in the interest of public safety, uh, that should be, uh, uh, replaced immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5702.295s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5703.715s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5704.656s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5705.477s">I</a>  have received this, uh, call about this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5708.5s">and</a>  went down to take a look at the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5712.142s">Like</a>  the Councilor said, it's just a hole in the ground and there's no curb in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5717.005s">I</a>  guess a few years ago they tried to plant the tree there, but the tree literally just fell out because there's no curbing to hold the soil in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5723.548s">So</a>  really the curb needs to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5725.289s">There</a>  really needs to be a strategy, I think, for Bowen Street in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5729.211s">Like</a>  Councilor Marks mentioned, I took a drive there as well, the sidewalks are really <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5733.524s">bad</a>  shade.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5734.285s">There's</a>  some flooding issues on Bowling Avenue also.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5736.026s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5736.266s">I</a>  mean, a lot of the sidewalks look like they might just need a skim coat, but I mean, just because a few, they just kind of, the top's gone, but there's other, there's other sidewalks that are just completely gone.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5745.894s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5746.815s">The</a>  upper part of Bowling Avenue has some pretty serious flooding issues when it rains. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5751.018s">So</a>  I know they're in the midst of addressing those also. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5754.741s">On</a>  the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5759.305s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5760.986s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5762.982s">The</a>  table of records. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5765.923s">Vice</a>  President, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5768.203s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5769.224s">Mr.</a>  President, I just want to take a brief opportunity to thank the DPW for the restriping work that they've done on Woburn Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5774.725s">We</a>  put a resolution forward last week asking that the four-way intersections on Woburn Street be repainted, and in short time, they were done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5781.287s">So</a>  I'd like to thank Joe Palladino from the sign department and the members of the highway department for their work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5787.289s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5808.377s">If</a>  you'd like to make that into a motion.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5857.031s">Vice</a>  president marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5858.793s">Uh,</a>  I was just wondering maybe if the Councilor or the council would be amendable to possibly meeting at six or six 30, um, uh, that night rather than seven o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5870.523s">It's</a>  still, it's still a Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5872.144s">It's,</a>  you know, need an hour earlier.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5874.265s">I</a>  don't, I think that makes it worse.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5879.247s">That</a>  makes it worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5879.948s">It</a>  makes it worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5881.128s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Us6qo5ICfww&t=5881.508s">Yeah.</a> </p>
