[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, if you could please mark Councilor Knight as being present.

19
01:01:32,735 --> 01:01:34,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Motions, orders, or resolutions.

20
01:01:35,401 --> 01:02:02,240
[SPEAKER_03]: 17-519, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the City Administration report to the Council the following, a listing of all collective bargaining agreements entered into by the School Department and the City of Bedford with employee organizations, including the effective dates of each agreement and the current status of any ongoing successor agreement negotiations.

21
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:03,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight,

22
01:02:04,392 --> 01:02:05,673
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

23
01:02:05,833 --> 01:02:25,545
[SPEAKER_16]: As we've started our budget hearings and we've discussed a lot about personal and ordinary expenses in the City of Medford's budget, one of the things that we continuously discuss is the fact that the majority of the funds that are being appropriated in the FY18 budget are for negotiated salary increases and contractual obligations.

24
01:02:26,381 --> 01:02:41,270
[SPEAKER_16]: As such, Mr. President, I'm requesting that the administration provide us with some documentation relative to the status thereof related to collective bargaining agreements between employee organizations in the city and the school department so that we have a better understanding as to where they are and what direction these negotiations are going in.

25
01:02:41,954 --> 01:02:42,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

26
01:02:42,954 --> 01:02:47,616
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

27
01:02:47,696 --> 01:02:48,416
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

28
01:02:49,217 --> 01:02:51,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

29
01:02:51,638 --> 01:02:53,918
[SPEAKER_03]: 17-521 offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

30
01:02:54,319 --> 01:03:08,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council set up a Committee of the Whole meeting to discuss the implementation of an ordinance to help fix all level three natural gas leaks and hold the gas companies accountable for better surveying, reporting, planning,

31
01:03:09,564 --> 01:03:11,445
[SPEAKER_03]: in remediation of such leaks.

32
01:03:11,886 --> 01:03:12,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

33
01:03:13,347 --> 01:03:15,708
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

34
01:03:15,988 --> 01:03:22,012
[SPEAKER_13]: This is an issue that the city of Boston took up not too long ago.

35
01:03:23,934 --> 01:03:36,702
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think after reading about it, after discussing it with our environmental, somebody from our environmental committee, I think it's something that we definitely could benefit from having it in Medford.

36
01:03:37,242 --> 01:03:38,023
[SPEAKER_13]: I know we have

37
01:03:38,353 --> 01:03:50,662
[SPEAKER_13]: with the engineer's office, potentially getting a new traffic engineer that may help with our issue that we have with the utility companies ripping up our roads and replacing them the way they should.

38
01:03:50,682 --> 01:03:55,865
[SPEAKER_13]: This is also maybe a third issue that potentially could be worked on.

39
01:03:56,966 --> 01:04:05,352
[SPEAKER_13]: This ordinance, which I have the city of Boston's ordinance, which I've reviewed and read, it would entail

40
01:04:06,061 --> 01:04:20,764
[SPEAKER_13]: Any time the city of Method opens up a street for any reason or any construction project, any time the street is opened, our utility companies, National Grid, Eversource, would be invited or asked to come and review that portion of the road.

41
01:04:21,364 --> 01:04:30,066
[SPEAKER_13]: And there would be a hope that they would survey and figure out where there are any potential leaks.

42
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:37,972
[SPEAKER_13]: Boston estimates they have thousands of gas leaks in their community, and this is a way to reduce that number.

43
01:04:38,452 --> 01:04:48,640
[SPEAKER_13]: We're a city that's obviously smaller than Boston, but we do have several, many, many gas leaks that I think need to be looked into, and we need to make that a priority.

44
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:50,761
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not good for the environment.

45
01:04:50,821 --> 01:04:54,044
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not good for public health.

46
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:59,888
[SPEAKER_13]: And obviously, so many more reasons why we should be getting on top of these gas leaks.

47
01:05:00,916 --> 01:05:01,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

48
01:05:01,736 --> 01:05:07,639
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Longo-Kearns, seconded by Councilor Falco.

49
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:08,279
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

50
01:05:08,839 --> 01:05:10,500
[SPEAKER_13]: If I could before the roll is called.

51
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:11,640
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Longo-Kearns.

52
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:21,784
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I just ask that we, I'm going to send around, I'll email all the councilors the city of Boston's ordinance so that we could maybe take the summer to review.

53
01:05:21,844 --> 01:05:25,926
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I would just ask that a committee of the whole meeting be set up in September.

54
01:05:25,966 --> 01:05:28,467
[SPEAKER_13]: And hopefully once we review it, we can implement this.

55
01:05:30,117 --> 01:05:32,198
[SPEAKER_13]: There's so many other facets to the ordinance.

56
01:05:32,258 --> 01:05:52,524
[SPEAKER_13]: It's about nine pages long, but not only fixing the leaks, but within the ordinance, we can also mandate that anything National Grid or Eversource or any gas company provides to DPU, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, that they provide to the city of Method.

57
01:05:52,564 --> 01:05:58,806
[SPEAKER_13]: So our engineer's office, our environment office can use that and help, obviously, do what we need to do

58
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:02,561
[SPEAKER_13]: alleviate the many, many leaks that we have in the community.

59
01:06:02,641 --> 01:06:14,303
[SPEAKER_13]: So it goes into depth and I won't go into it tonight, but I definitely would appreciate if my colleagues would read it so we can go through it and in the early fall and try to get this implemented as soon as we can.

60
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:14,963
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

61
01:06:14,983 --> 01:06:17,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Mox.

62
01:06:18,604 --> 01:06:19,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

63
01:06:19,504 --> 01:06:21,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank my council colleague for bringing this up.

64
01:06:22,669 --> 01:06:38,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I brought up an issue, uh, probably about a month and a half ago regarding, uh, the meeting that took place on March 20th in this city, uh, where national grid had a community public meeting at the McGlynn middle school and, um, come to find out, Mr. President.

65
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:47,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently, according to the figures we received from National Grid, we have no grade 1 or grade 2 leaks in the community.

66
01:06:49,295 --> 01:06:51,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Grade 1 is eminent threat of explosion.

67
01:06:51,535 --> 01:06:54,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Grade 2 threatens health or property.

68
01:06:55,636 --> 01:07:00,417
[SPEAKER_02]: And grade 3, we have over 260 leaks in this community.

69
01:07:00,957 --> 01:07:06,779
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though it's no threat to health and property, Mr. President, there still are leaks in the community.

70
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:12,721
[SPEAKER_02]: And these particular leaks over time naturally become larger leaks.

71
01:07:13,561 --> 01:07:28,905
[SPEAKER_02]: And from what I found out from National Grid is that they currently don't prioritize grade 3 leaks, which we have over 260, because they receive no reimbursement on grade 3 leaks.

72
01:07:29,426 --> 01:07:33,467
[SPEAKER_02]: So they prioritize grade 1 and grade 2 leaks and nothing on grade 3.

73
01:07:34,423 --> 01:07:41,148
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can make it part of the report also, Mr. President, and I think it was part of the report several months back.

74
01:07:41,188 --> 01:07:42,529
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we got a response or not.

75
01:07:42,569 --> 01:07:44,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't recall seeing a response.

76
01:07:46,451 --> 01:08:03,683
[SPEAKER_02]: What we can do with the grade three leaks, should we be petitioning National Grid, even though they don't prioritize them, that they come into the community and start working on these low-level grade three leaks, which to me is alarming when you have close to 300 leaks that they're aware of in the community.

77
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:05,948
[SPEAKER_02]: And those leaks could be decades old.

78
01:08:07,009 --> 01:08:09,851
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I'm concerned about that equally.

79
01:08:09,871 --> 01:08:12,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank my colleague for putting this on tonight.

80
01:08:12,993 --> 01:08:13,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

81
01:08:14,034 --> 01:08:14,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Council Member O'Karn.

82
01:08:15,175 --> 01:08:17,236
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, and I thank Councilor Marks for his comments.

83
01:08:17,297 --> 01:08:26,163
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we probably would see a level of times two or three of that 260 number, and that's very concerning, and I agree.

84
01:08:26,203 --> 01:08:33,248
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think this ordinance, if we implement it, it would give it some teeth, because if a gas company refuses to survey an open site,

85
01:08:33,618 --> 01:08:40,281
[SPEAKER_13]: or doesn't repair a leak found at the site, the city will then have the right to deny permits for other street digging they apply for.

86
01:08:40,381 --> 01:08:52,648
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it goes in conjunction with the committee of the whole meeting we had a week or two ago with the engineer's office, where how can we have oversight and how can we put more teeth into it when they're not doing the right thing?

87
01:08:52,768 --> 01:09:00,872
[SPEAKER_13]: And this would be another avenue to make sure not only are they repairing our street properly when they dig it up, but also come to every single

88
01:09:01,814 --> 01:09:06,117
[SPEAKER_13]: project that we're doing and make sure these level three leaks are fixed and fixed accordingly.

89
01:09:06,557 --> 01:09:24,329
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's a tool that the engineer's office would hopefully, especially getting a new position, maybe including this job title in that position, I think we can make a huge dent in these level three leaks that maybe they're not affecting life, but they're killing trees.

90
01:09:24,509 --> 01:09:27,511
[SPEAKER_13]: Gas leaks kill trees, it kills vegetation, and that's all

91
01:09:28,024 --> 01:09:30,886
[SPEAKER_13]: outlined in the Boston City of Boston's ordinance.

92
01:09:30,926 --> 01:09:34,349
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's something that we need to, we've got a lot done this council.

93
01:09:34,389 --> 01:09:39,813
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think this is one extra thing that we can include since we're on the utility companies.

94
01:09:39,873 --> 01:09:57,727
[SPEAKER_13]: This is one extra thing that we can use to not only for the council to have some teeth because we're allowing for certain permits, but the DPW and the engineer's office, it definitely will allow them to, you know, if they, if we can get on top of it, we can make a huge dent in a level three leaks as Boston's doing.

95
01:09:58,237 --> 01:10:07,862
[SPEAKER_13]: The issue with Boston and other cities and towns implementing this is that National Grid and Eversource are going to focus more on the communities that have these ordinances in place.

96
01:10:07,942 --> 01:10:16,526
[SPEAKER_13]: So come time when we're one of the only ones that don't have it, we'll be down on the totem pole of when they're going to fix the leaks we do have.

97
01:10:16,606 --> 01:10:25,831
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that this is instrumental in staying on top of it and staying in the 2017 plus time frame of what needs to be done

98
01:10:26,823 --> 01:10:30,966
[SPEAKER_13]: to cure the problem, so hopefully we can get this done in the fall and move forward.

99
01:10:31,567 --> 01:10:32,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

100
01:10:33,008 --> 01:10:34,809
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Lingo-Kearns.

[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

119
01:11:01,118 --> 01:11:04,320
[SPEAKER_03]: 17-522, offered by Councilor Lengel-Kern.

120
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:23,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the office of the city solicitor report back to the Medford City Council with regards to how many claims have been received in 2016 and 17 as it relates to damage to persons and or property due to potholes, sunken manholes, grates, and the like.

121
01:11:23,651 --> 01:11:24,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lengel-Kern.

122
01:11:25,112 --> 01:11:27,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

123
01:11:27,773 --> 01:11:28,454
[SPEAKER_13]: If I could just

124
01:11:33,696 --> 01:11:34,296
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm asking for 2016, 2017.

125
01:11:34,977 --> 01:11:40,080
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to see the difference in claims from our law department.

126
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:49,885
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that we did meet with Solicitor Rumley yesterday, and he did give us some insight, numbers off the top of his head, with regards to how many claims have been put in.

127
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:53,187
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that was great that he was on top of it.

128
01:11:53,247 --> 01:12:02,172
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe it was about 30 claims from pothole and street defects and nine personal injury claims from potholes, two of which were

129
01:12:02,802 --> 01:12:08,963
[SPEAKER_13]: in addition to were personal injuries from people that were on bicycles that obviously went through a pothole and got injured.

130
01:12:09,343 --> 01:12:18,065
[SPEAKER_13]: So I wanted to know that considering how hard our DPW is working with regards to how many potholes we do have out there.

131
01:12:18,105 --> 01:12:20,706
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if we had a bad winter, but they're everywhere.

132
01:12:20,786 --> 01:12:23,087
[SPEAKER_13]: They're getting filled, but there are a number more.

133
01:12:23,487 --> 01:12:26,587
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know we discussed with the DPW contracting out.

134
01:12:26,687 --> 01:12:29,388
[SPEAKER_13]: So I wanted to really see within this budget

135
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:41,695
[SPEAKER_13]: how it evens out claims versus filling versus getting a contractor so that we can make an educated decision come next week or the week after when we have to make recommendations and approve or disprove the budget.

136
01:12:42,195 --> 01:12:44,216
[SPEAKER_13]: So I move approval, ask for a roll call vote.

137
01:12:44,436 --> 01:12:44,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

138
01:12:44,917 --> 01:12:48,198
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, seconded by Councilor Scapelli.

139
01:12:48,638 --> 01:12:51,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, roll call has been requested.

140
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:56,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Dello Russo?

141
01:12:56,402 --> 01:12:56,602
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

142
01:12:56,642 --> 01:12:59,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco?

143
01:12:59,204 --> 01:12:59,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

144
01:13:02,589 --> 01:13:02,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

145
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:05,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

146
01:13:05,971 --> 01:13:06,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

147
01:13:07,973 --> 01:13:08,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

148
01:13:10,014 --> 01:13:11,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Six in the affirmative.

149
01:13:11,074 --> 01:13:13,276
[SPEAKER_03]: One in the negative motion passes.

150
01:13:18,178 --> 01:13:21,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion by Councilor Falco is to take a paper out of order.

151
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:24,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

152
01:13:24,382 --> 01:13:24,402
[SPEAKER_03]: 17-525.

153
01:13:28,963 --> 01:13:33,946
[SPEAKER_03]: 17, 525.

154
01:13:29,004 --> 01:13:33,946
[SPEAKER_03]: 17, 525, offered by Councilor Falco.

155
01:13:34,487 --> 01:13:41,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas, continuous speeding and careless driving poses a significant problem for the residents of Fern Road.

156
01:13:41,671 --> 01:13:53,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the Medford DPW place a temporary speed bump on the lower end of Fern Road and that the Medford Police Department increase patrols in the area in the interest of public safety.

157
01:13:53,717 --> 01:13:54,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco.

158
01:13:54,818 --> 01:13:55,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

159
01:13:57,557 --> 01:14:03,240
[SPEAKER_10]: had the opportunity last week to attend the monthly community police meeting down at the Medford Police Station.

160
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:07,362
[SPEAKER_10]: And once again, they had a nice crowd, probably about 25, 30 people.

161
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:12,525
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was about 10 people from Fern Road that attended.

162
01:14:12,805 --> 01:14:18,589
[SPEAKER_10]: And they had major issues on that road with regard to traffic and speeding.

163
01:14:19,229 --> 01:14:25,572
[SPEAKER_10]: And at the end of Fern Road is the intersection of Fulton Spring Road and Vista Ave and the other side of Fern Road.

164
01:14:25,613 --> 01:14:26,433
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a four-way stop.

165
01:14:27,066 --> 01:14:29,448
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's also a location for a bus stop.

166
01:14:30,128 --> 01:14:39,976
[SPEAKER_10]: And the traffic in that area in the morning and in the evening is really, really bad with people flying through the stop sign and then progressing down towards the Felsway.

167
01:14:40,516 --> 01:14:42,498
[SPEAKER_10]: And the speeding is really out of control.

168
01:14:42,838 --> 01:14:45,760
[SPEAKER_10]: And the residents that were there that night expressed that.

169
01:14:46,341 --> 01:14:50,324
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I just wanted to ask for increased patrols on that street.

170
01:14:50,974 --> 01:14:55,376
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we could add a temporary speed bump to that street as well.

171
01:14:55,797 --> 01:14:56,657
[SPEAKER_10]: It came up that night.

172
01:14:57,317 --> 01:15:01,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Chief Sacco said he had no problems with it.

173
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:02,500
[SPEAKER_10]: He was in favor of it.

174
01:15:03,801 --> 01:15:08,803
[SPEAKER_10]: And since I wrote this resolution, I've also talked to Brian Kearns as well.

175
01:15:08,943 --> 01:15:12,385
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe Sergeant Hartnett was going up to look at the situation today.

176
01:15:12,405 --> 01:15:15,066
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's a little bit of an update.

177
01:15:15,126 --> 01:15:18,648
[SPEAKER_10]: But there are actually a couple of residents here that would like to speak on this issue.

178
01:15:24,696 --> 01:15:25,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

179
01:15:25,476 --> 01:15:26,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address for the record, please.

180
01:15:28,077 --> 01:15:29,318
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Janice Ronzio.

181
01:15:29,398 --> 01:15:30,878
[SPEAKER_09]: I live at 66 Fern Road.

182
01:15:30,898 --> 01:15:35,300
[SPEAKER_12]: And my name is Judy Seifert, and I live at 60 Fern Road.

183
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:36,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.

184
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:37,380
[SPEAKER_12]: We're neighbors.

185
01:15:39,181 --> 01:15:41,682
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, thank you for allowing us to speak.

186
01:15:42,702 --> 01:15:46,283
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'd love to thank Councilor Falco for all his help.

187
01:15:46,904 --> 01:15:49,044
[SPEAKER_09]: He's been right there with us trying to assist us.

188
01:15:49,104 --> 01:15:50,945
[SPEAKER_09]: This has been an ongoing problem for years.

189
01:15:51,985 --> 01:15:53,566
[SPEAKER_09]: My children are now in their 30s.

190
01:15:54,858 --> 01:16:00,760
[SPEAKER_09]: And when they were little, toddlers, I had signs put up on the street, you know, slow signs.

191
01:16:01,581 --> 01:16:02,781
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was 37 years ago.

192
01:16:02,821 --> 01:16:06,542
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is something that's not happened overnight, but it's been going on for a long time.

193
01:16:07,463 --> 01:16:10,884
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's at the point now where it's just really out of control.

194
01:16:10,924 --> 01:16:13,285
[SPEAKER_09]: They're blowing through the four-way stop sign.

195
01:16:13,385 --> 01:16:15,726
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a bus stop, as Councilor Falco said.

196
01:16:17,507 --> 01:16:22,708
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if I had kids going to get on the bus, I wouldn't want them being up there by themselves.

197
01:16:22,949 --> 01:16:24,009
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how bad it is up there.

198
01:16:25,703 --> 01:16:41,806
[SPEAKER_09]: And coming down Fern Road, what they're doing is the traffic, and to avoid Fulton Street in the morning, because of the light that backs up all the way up Fulton, they're coming down Fern Road and then coming out onto the Felsway, and they're trying to get out on the Felsway, and that's backed up.

199
01:16:42,926 --> 01:16:52,708
[SPEAKER_09]: So we had gone to a couple of police meetings and expressed to the chief that we would like something done.

200
01:16:53,999 --> 01:17:01,667
[SPEAKER_09]: And Thursday, the day after the police meeting, there was a police officer up at the corner and he was pulling cars over for blowing the stop sign.

201
01:17:02,327 --> 01:17:07,493
[SPEAKER_09]: And they also stopped somebody near mine and Judy's house that was speeding down the street.

202
01:17:08,534 --> 01:17:13,719
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're very appreciative that we're able to get something done at this point.

203
01:17:14,499 --> 01:17:16,922
[SPEAKER_09]: And we also are hoping that

204
01:17:17,386 --> 01:17:20,007
[SPEAKER_09]: the police could make some more presence.

205
01:17:20,067 --> 01:17:21,888
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we know that they can't be there all the time.

206
01:17:21,928 --> 01:17:24,329
[SPEAKER_09]: We understand that, you know, there's problems everywhere.

207
01:17:24,369 --> 01:17:24,869
[SPEAKER_09]: We get that.

208
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:36,574
[SPEAKER_09]: But if we could just for the next couple of weeks until school gets out at least, um, have a police presence in the morning, um, when it's busy, people going to work, going to school.

209
01:17:36,754 --> 01:17:42,377
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, you know, later afternoon, like suppertime when people are coming home from work, um, to just

210
01:17:43,021 --> 01:17:55,765
[SPEAKER_09]: maybe be there a couple of times a week for the next few weeks just to show their presence so that people in the neighborhood or whoever's traveling will understand that something is being done to resolve this.

211
01:17:55,805 --> 01:17:58,165
[SPEAKER_09]: So we do appreciate all the help that we're getting.

212
01:17:58,585 --> 01:18:00,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Falco, thank you very much.

213
01:18:01,166 --> 01:18:04,807
[SPEAKER_09]: And my neighbors, we have a great neighborhood.

214
01:18:05,187 --> 01:18:09,388
[SPEAKER_09]: And a couple of years ago, we actually had a problem with a car coming up the street.

215
01:18:09,888 --> 01:18:11,649
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a young kid texting.

216
01:18:12,426 --> 01:18:14,648
[SPEAKER_09]: flying up the street and going up the hill.

217
01:18:14,668 --> 01:18:15,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Fern Road's a pretty steep hill.

218
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:18,031
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was going at a pretty good speed.

219
01:18:18,131 --> 01:18:20,492
[SPEAKER_09]: And he knocked a tree over on the sidewalk.

220
01:18:20,552 --> 01:18:23,034
[SPEAKER_09]: So luckily, there was nobody there on the sidewalk at the time.

221
01:18:23,074 --> 01:18:27,618
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is just an idea of what goes on daily on that street.

222
01:18:28,098 --> 01:18:31,982
[SPEAKER_09]: People think Fern Road is like a fantasy world, that nothing happens up there.

223
01:18:32,022 --> 01:18:34,003
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's really pretty bad.

224
01:18:34,403 --> 01:18:40,088
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to do what we can do to help alleviate the problem, too, if we have to put

225
01:18:40,407 --> 01:18:44,590
[SPEAKER_09]: the signs up, you know, the signs that say drive as if your children lived here.

226
01:18:45,671 --> 01:18:50,634
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we're willing to buy those and put them on our lawns, whatever we have to do to help.

227
01:18:50,774 --> 01:18:52,695
[SPEAKER_09]: But we do appreciate all the help that we're getting here.

228
01:18:52,715 --> 01:18:53,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

229
01:18:53,696 --> 01:18:54,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

230
01:18:54,176 --> 01:19:04,423
[SPEAKER_12]: We're also aware that when that new traffic engineer is hired, we'd certainly like that person to take a look because this is like, for now, this would really make a big difference.

231
01:19:04,503 --> 01:19:10,267
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think there's probably ways that we could solve this problem more permanently.

232
01:19:11,139 --> 01:19:13,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I don't know if the speed bumps are temporary or not.

233
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:30,508
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they are so It's a temporary speed bump that they pull up in the winter because of the plows they can't keep it down year-round but It's definitely I think Something that would help in this situation.

234
01:19:31,008 --> 01:19:36,971
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean we would I took a walk I live right around the corner and I took a walk down the street and met with the residents on Saturday and

235
01:19:37,492 --> 01:19:39,934
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's interesting, there's a pothole in the street.

236
01:19:40,334 --> 01:19:44,397
[SPEAKER_10]: And some of them are like, don't fill the pothole because it slows down the traffic.

237
01:19:44,818 --> 01:19:46,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see if it gets any bigger.

238
01:19:46,979 --> 01:19:49,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Put a couple of cones around just to slow some people down.

239
01:19:49,801 --> 01:19:51,203
[SPEAKER_10]: And that really shouldn't be the solution.

240
01:19:51,243 --> 01:19:54,125
[SPEAKER_10]: We should make sure that we fill the pothole and slow down traffic.

241
01:19:54,585 --> 01:20:04,713
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're hoping that putting in that temporary speed bump would help slow down the traffic, help drivers realize that, you know what, this is a busy neighborhood.

242
01:20:04,733 --> 01:20:06,294
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of people, a lot of cars.

243
01:20:06,698 --> 01:20:08,158
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a school bus stop close by.

244
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:09,379
[SPEAKER_10]: People have to drive safely.

245
01:20:09,939 --> 01:20:15,501
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I basically would ask a move for approval at this point.

246
01:20:15,901 --> 01:20:16,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

247
01:20:16,421 --> 01:20:17,541
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you for your support.

248
01:20:17,701 --> 01:20:18,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

249
01:20:18,121 --> 01:20:18,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

250
01:20:18,962 --> 01:20:19,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

251
01:20:19,382 --> 01:20:19,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

252
01:20:20,842 --> 01:20:21,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

253
01:20:21,943 --> 01:20:25,164
[SPEAKER_11]: I thank fellow Councilor John Falco for bringing that up.

254
01:20:25,984 --> 01:20:34,906
[SPEAKER_11]: If I can amend that, if we can maybe add the digital speed monitor, maybe to slow people down.

255
01:20:35,507 --> 01:20:36,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, I know that

256
01:20:37,188 --> 01:20:51,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, we've worked both Councilor Falco and Councilor Kern have been working with Sergeant Hartnett on the traffic issues as that's a major cut through, especially with the future work that's being done up there.

257
01:20:51,398 --> 01:21:00,484
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that might be something we need to rekindle for another subcommittee meeting with the hospital site and then bring Officer Hartnett.

258
01:21:00,504 --> 01:21:06,928
[SPEAKER_11]: I know they did a report, a traffic study that counted the cars that went through that area and it was pretty

259
01:21:07,659 --> 01:21:09,200
[SPEAKER_11]: It was pretty astronomical.

260
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:21,691
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think if we could put that, the, the machine there, if we can ask the chief to put that up there so people can see the speed limit and maybe that could deter some of the speeding.

261
01:21:21,751 --> 01:21:23,672
[SPEAKER_11]: But thank you again for this resolution.

262
01:21:24,593 --> 01:21:25,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

263
01:21:26,255 --> 01:21:27,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Marks.

264
01:21:28,056 --> 01:21:29,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

265
01:21:29,337 --> 01:21:32,340
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to thank Councilor Falco also.

266
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:36,083
[SPEAKER_02]: This seems to be a recurring theme in the community.

267
01:21:36,710 --> 01:21:42,615
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're hearing about pedestrian safety, cars speeding throughout our neighborhood and on our neighborhood streets.

268
01:21:43,795 --> 01:21:54,304
[SPEAKER_02]: I could just tell you firsthand, Mr. President, that when we implemented the pilot program for raised crosswalks, I personally like raised crosswalks better than a speed bump.

269
01:21:55,364 --> 01:22:02,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Speed bumps are very temporary in nature, and I don't think they accomplish the same goal as a raised crosswalk.

270
01:22:03,557 --> 01:22:11,281
[SPEAKER_02]: When we did the pilot program, Mr. President, back some four years ago, Mayor McGlynn at the time said we were going to do three raised crosswalks.

271
01:22:11,921 --> 01:22:13,382
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was back some four years ago.

272
01:22:13,442 --> 01:22:15,443
[SPEAKER_02]: We've only implemented one on Winthrop Street.

273
01:22:15,923 --> 01:22:26,769
[SPEAKER_02]: But I could tell you firsthand that a raised crosswalk in that particular neighborhood and in many other neighborhoods would work wonders on traffic calming, slowing down traffic,

274
01:22:27,109 --> 01:22:28,070
[SPEAKER_02]: in particular areas.

275
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:37,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that coupled with widening sidewalks, putting up blinking lights, increasing signage in the community, that definitely has an impact also.

276
01:22:37,918 --> 01:22:41,662
[SPEAKER_02]: But we, you know, we can't sit back and talk about complete streets.

277
01:22:42,222 --> 01:22:44,044
[SPEAKER_02]: We've heard complete streets over and over again.

278
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:45,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I read articles in the paper.

279
01:22:45,965 --> 01:22:57,641
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great, we're making some initiatives on some of the major roads and with $500,000 we're hitting up several neighborhoods and providing some traffic calming initiatives.

280
01:22:58,221 --> 01:23:01,105
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also have to, we can't ignore the neighborhoods.

281
01:23:01,906 --> 01:23:03,707
[SPEAKER_02]: because I've been on the council a number of years.

282
01:23:04,028 --> 01:23:11,173
[SPEAKER_02]: The concerns I hear over and over again, a lot of them are on main roads, but much, much more, Mr. President, are in the neighborhoods.

283
01:23:11,974 --> 01:23:13,735
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I'm hearing over and over again.

284
01:23:14,216 --> 01:23:15,837
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is not rocket science.

285
01:23:16,557 --> 01:23:19,420
[SPEAKER_02]: There's ways of calming traffic down.

286
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,261
[SPEAKER_02]: There's very simple ways, there's very cost effective ways of doing it.

287
01:23:24,681 --> 01:23:31,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's merely just, I know the city of Cambridge does it, they paint what looks like a 3D mural in the street.

288
01:23:32,422 --> 01:23:39,804
[SPEAKER_02]: So when a car approaches, it looks like there's something impeding them from going forward because of this 3D image that's in the road.

289
01:23:40,284 --> 01:23:45,905
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a very unique way of having at least people that are driving to be alert when they come up to an area.

290
01:23:46,545 --> 01:23:48,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not expensive to do, Mr. President.

291
01:23:49,527 --> 01:23:57,052
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, in my opinion, we fall short of the mark in this community when it comes to pedestrian safety.

292
01:23:57,692 --> 01:24:01,515
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my opinion, Mr. President, you know,

293
01:24:02,233 --> 01:24:03,373
[SPEAKER_02]: There's money out there.

294
01:24:03,413 --> 01:24:08,975
[SPEAKER_02]: We have over $8 million in free cash to move some of these initiatives forward in the neighborhoods.

295
01:24:09,755 --> 01:24:23,678
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll benefit not only the community in general, Mr. President, it'll send a message out to the people driving on our streets, many of which are just cutting through, Mr. President, that we're not going to tolerate this any longer.

296
01:24:24,238 --> 01:24:28,339
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sends a message out, Mr. President, when you take back your roads.

297
01:24:28,899 --> 01:24:37,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Several months back, this council voted to reduce the speed limit from 30 miles an hour to 25 miles an hour on all non-posted roads.

298
01:24:39,341 --> 01:24:47,463
[SPEAKER_02]: We have yet to see, that was several months back, one sign be erected that says the new speed limit of 25 miles an hour on our streets.

299
01:24:48,399 --> 01:24:56,381
[SPEAKER_02]: So, again, we've done a pork job in communicating what was a vote of this council and eventually passed by the Traffic Commission.

300
01:24:56,901 --> 01:25:04,744
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, Mr. President, something that would send a message to people that are coming through our community that you have to reduce speed when you come onto Medford streets.

301
01:25:05,444 --> 01:25:10,085
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate Councilor Falco for bringing this up tonight, Mr. President.

302
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:26,508
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I hope more is done with this new traffic engineer that's going to be approved in the budget to really address neighborhood concerns of improvement of public safety and pedestrian safety in our community.

303
01:25:27,268 --> 01:25:28,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

304
01:25:28,789 --> 01:25:29,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

305
01:25:29,909 --> 01:25:30,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

306
01:25:31,370 --> 01:25:32,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

307
01:25:32,851 --> 01:25:37,713
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank Councilor Falco for bringing this forward and I wanted to second the resolve and just

308
01:25:38,246 --> 01:25:39,186
[SPEAKER_13]: highlight a few points.

309
01:25:39,247 --> 01:25:42,708
[SPEAKER_13]: I was at the Traffic Commission meeting with you, President Caraviello, today.

310
01:25:42,728 --> 01:25:46,430
[SPEAKER_13]: There was speeding on Forest Street was on the agenda.

311
01:25:46,510 --> 01:25:48,651
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I was, I wasn't aware of that.

312
01:25:48,691 --> 01:25:51,512
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I was there for the South Street speeding issue.

313
01:25:51,612 --> 01:25:55,534
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is happening all over our community and we just have to keep on top of it.

314
01:25:55,634 --> 01:26:05,759
[SPEAKER_13]: And street by street, we need to, and hopefully the traffic engineer will do that, street by street, problem area by problem area, we need to figure out ways to slow down the traffic.

315
01:26:06,711 --> 01:26:13,134
[SPEAKER_13]: widening sidewalks is going on up near the Brooks School, simple signage that can be put up.

316
01:26:14,514 --> 01:26:18,696
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to do this throughout our community, and this obviously is a problem spot.

317
01:26:18,736 --> 01:26:22,137
[SPEAKER_13]: So I definitely am happy that we're going to try to move forward on this.

318
01:26:22,217 --> 01:26:28,260
[SPEAKER_13]: And what is a positive note is that Sergeant Hartnett and the Traffic Division are working hard.

319
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:33,842
[SPEAKER_13]: I was driving down South Street yesterday, and I see Sergeant Hartnett out with a little machine.

320
01:26:34,931 --> 01:26:36,712
[SPEAKER_13]: And I pulled over and I said, what are you doing?

321
01:26:36,732 --> 01:26:43,414
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess we have new laser guns that 10 officers have been trained in recently.

322
01:26:43,774 --> 01:26:44,935
[SPEAKER_13]: I think he said last week.

323
01:26:45,435 --> 01:26:46,936
[SPEAKER_13]: So I thought that was very positive.

324
01:26:47,036 --> 01:26:51,317
[SPEAKER_13]: And he said the radar guns that they purchased are coming in within the next several weeks.

325
01:26:52,898 --> 01:27:01,481
[SPEAKER_13]: Also 200 signs, we were in the traffic meeting today requesting that the 25 miles an hour signs be posted.

326
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:02,724
[SPEAKER_13]: and changed out.

327
01:27:02,844 --> 01:27:04,245
[SPEAKER_13]: From what I understand, they ordered 200.

328
01:27:04,325 --> 01:27:11,150
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to do, hopefully, our main thoroughfares first and any points entering the city.

329
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:12,951
[SPEAKER_13]: But hopefully more are ordered.

330
01:27:12,971 --> 01:27:15,393
[SPEAKER_13]: We can switch out those signs sooner than later.

331
01:27:15,413 --> 01:27:22,639
[SPEAKER_13]: And Councilor Scarpelli brought it up, too, that the monitor sign, those signs, we've ordered two.

332
01:27:22,699 --> 01:27:24,540
[SPEAKER_13]: And those are coming in very soon.

333
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:30,325
[SPEAKER_13]: And those need to be, I said it before, we need a list of everywhere that people are complaining about and put it there.

334
01:27:31,309 --> 01:27:35,931
[SPEAKER_13]: It needs to be, those two need to be utilized all the time so that we can slow down the traffic.

335
01:27:36,472 --> 01:27:38,392
[SPEAKER_13]: So I move, I second the resolve.

336
01:27:38,432 --> 01:27:46,096
[SPEAKER_13]: Just wanted to note some positive points because we have been involved in approving them and the spending of the money to approve them.

337
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:55,200
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm glad we have a staff in the traffic division that we are now seeing out and utilizing these tools to hopefully make it, the streets safer.

338
01:27:56,221 --> 01:27:56,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

339
01:27:57,133 --> 01:27:58,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Marks.

340
01:27:58,514 --> 01:28:03,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Just if I could amend the paper, if Councilor Falco doesn't mind, just popped in my head.

341
01:28:03,637 --> 01:28:05,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Doonan Street is a four-way stop.

342
01:28:06,599 --> 01:28:16,026
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting complaints from neighbors that no one is actually adhering to the four-way stop at all on Doonan, and people just going by without coming to a stop at all.

343
01:28:16,106 --> 01:28:22,470
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we could have Sergeant Hartnett in the Traffic Division go out and take a look at that particular area, Mr. President, that would be helpful.

344
01:28:23,991 --> 01:28:24,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

345
01:28:24,592 --> 01:28:25,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.

346
01:28:25,472 --> 01:28:26,273
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a four-way stop.

347
01:28:27,165 --> 01:28:32,848
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, as amended by Councilor Marks.

348
01:28:33,509 --> 01:28:34,329
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

349
01:28:34,349 --> 01:28:36,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry?

350
01:28:37,291 --> 01:28:37,431
[SPEAKER_03]: In?

351
01:28:38,131 --> 01:28:39,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Amended by Councilor Scapelli.

352
01:28:40,833 --> 01:28:41,553
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

353
01:28:42,914 --> 01:28:46,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

354
01:28:46,216 --> 01:28:47,937
[SPEAKER_03]: 17-523, offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

355
01:28:49,077 --> 01:28:55,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council send a written communication to Massport requesting that they- Are we still under suspension?

356
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we still under suspension?

357
01:28:56,661 --> 01:28:57,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we just went out of order.

358
01:28:57,601 --> 01:28:59,062
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all we wrote.

359
01:28:59,082 --> 01:28:59,922
[SPEAKER_03]: We just went out of order.

360
01:29:00,963 --> 01:29:01,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

361
01:29:02,504 --> 01:29:07,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I add something to the suspension while we're talking while we're under a suspension and vice president marks.

362
01:29:07,986 --> 01:29:09,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. This is an important item.

363
01:29:09,347 --> 01:29:10,787
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only reason why I wanted to bring it up.

364
01:29:11,428 --> 01:29:24,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, several weeks back, uh, through this council, we requested that the city solicitor talk to Paul Moki, the building commissioner, and also Ed Finn regarding a proposed wireless communication ordinance that was proposed back in 2011.

365
01:29:26,395 --> 01:29:28,057
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, before this method city council.

366
01:29:28,738 --> 01:29:30,539
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, we got a response in our packet.

367
01:29:30,559 --> 01:29:35,144
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everyone has a copy tonight of, uh, the ordinance that was drafted back in 2011.

368
01:29:35,864 --> 01:29:47,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, this ordinance also includes, uh, language that was inserted by a national grid at the time, uh, to amend our ordinance, Mr. President, to allow

369
01:29:48,092 --> 01:29:50,295
[SPEAKER_02]: wireless communication on the polls.

370
01:29:50,816 --> 01:29:57,466
[SPEAKER_02]: But this ordinance, Mr. President, is directly related to what many people may have saw on the local news just recently.

371
01:29:58,227 --> 01:30:02,934
[SPEAKER_02]: The MBTA right now is trying to generate some additional revenue.

372
01:30:03,514 --> 01:30:13,579
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're providing a service to their commuter rail customers that they'll be able to have internet access on the train for a nominal fee, I guess.

373
01:30:14,260 --> 01:30:19,723
[SPEAKER_02]: And in order to provide that service, they need to erect cell phone towers throughout

374
01:30:20,856 --> 01:30:25,077
[SPEAKER_02]: many communities that the commuter rail goes through.

375
01:30:25,737 --> 01:30:32,259
[SPEAKER_02]: And I happened to catch it on Channel 5, and this council voted on it actually a couple months even prior to it coming up.

376
01:30:32,739 --> 01:30:38,760
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of the communities where the commuter rail goes through, they're going to be erecting cell phone towers.

377
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:42,301
[SPEAKER_02]: In the city of Method, there's already two requests.

378
01:30:43,264 --> 01:30:50,288
[SPEAKER_02]: for cell phone towers, one on Tyler Ave and one on Charnwood Road, which are directly within neighborhoods, Mr. President.

379
01:30:51,028 --> 01:31:03,835
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ordinance that was offered back in 2011 would prohibit cell phone towers from being erected in any area except for industrial and commercial zones.

380
01:31:04,776 --> 01:31:09,098
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now, all you need is a building permit and an electrical permit.

381
01:31:09,554 --> 01:31:13,218
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can erect a 74-foot cell tower in your backyard.

382
01:31:13,859 --> 01:31:14,860
[SPEAKER_02]: It's as easy as that.

383
01:31:15,993 --> 01:31:32,357
[SPEAKER_02]: So the ordinance, Mr. President, which I think we have to meet pretty immediately on, I'd ask that it go to the subcommittee on zoning and ordinance, or unless the council sees fit to have a committee of the whole on it, I would venture to say this language is ready to go.

384
01:31:33,697 --> 01:31:37,158
[SPEAKER_02]: This language, in my opinion, has been vetted out thoroughly.

385
01:31:37,178 --> 01:31:40,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it does deserve to be vetted out more by this council.

386
01:31:40,619 --> 01:32:03,388
[SPEAKER_02]: But at this point, Mr. President, I would ask, through a vote of this council, that this particular correspondence dated June 8th from the city solicitor regarding wireless communication and facility ordinance be sent to either the Zoning and Ordinance Subcommittee or Committee of the Whole, Mr. President, for further discussion and quick action, because this is a very important issue.

387
01:32:04,669 --> 01:32:06,609
[SPEAKER_02]: I would take your recommendation, Mr. President.

388
01:32:08,424 --> 01:32:10,546
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do the best we see if we can get it done before the summer session.

389
01:32:10,566 --> 01:32:11,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we take a vote on that, Mr. President?

390
01:32:12,007 --> 01:32:14,228
[SPEAKER_02]: This be sent because it's a paper that... Yes, we can.

391
01:32:15,489 --> 01:32:19,132
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion by Councilor... Roll call vote, Mr. President.

392
01:32:19,492 --> 01:32:19,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

393
01:32:20,853 --> 01:32:23,875
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, the committee has decided that they want to go to the committee of the whole.

394
01:32:23,895 --> 01:32:24,335
[SPEAKER_16]: That's fine.

395
01:32:24,355 --> 01:32:33,842
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to inform the delegation that we had some preliminary discussions this evening and early last week about setting up a summer schedule for zoning and ordinance to address some of the papers that are in committee.

396
01:32:34,426 --> 01:32:37,427
[SPEAKER_16]: However, if the council feels as though we should go to a committee of the whole first, that's fine with me.

397
01:32:37,507 --> 01:32:41,068
[SPEAKER_03]: With time is of the essence on this, maybe we say we'll get this done quicker.

398
01:32:41,388 --> 01:32:42,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever the body wants to do.

399
01:32:42,728 --> 01:32:43,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

400
01:32:44,249 --> 01:32:52,211
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Naix, roll call vote has been requested.

401
01:32:59,253 --> 01:33:00,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Dello Russo.

402
01:33:02,881 --> 01:33:03,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco?

403
01:33:03,702 --> 01:33:04,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

404
01:33:04,482 --> 01:33:04,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

405
01:33:05,103 --> 01:33:05,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

406
01:33:06,103 --> 01:33:06,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn?

407
01:33:06,824 --> 01:33:06,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

408
01:33:07,605 --> 01:33:08,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice-President Marks?

409
01:33:08,645 --> 01:33:09,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

410
01:33:09,526 --> 01:33:10,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

411
01:33:10,307 --> 01:33:10,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

412
01:33:10,547 --> 01:33:11,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice-President Caraviello?

413
01:33:12,288 --> 01:33:12,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

414
01:33:13,309 --> 01:33:15,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

415
01:33:16,611 --> 01:33:18,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to revert back to regular order.

416
01:33:18,513 --> 01:33:23,516
[SPEAKER_03]: 17-523 offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

417
01:33:23,917 --> 01:33:27,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council send a written communication to Massport

418
01:33:28,464 --> 01:33:36,551
[SPEAKER_03]: requesting that they provide the city of Method with a noise monitor to be placed above the Andrews School as well as the Medford Heights.

419
01:33:36,671 --> 01:33:50,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it further resolved that the letter be sent from the city, Medford City Council to all of our state delegation requesting that they contact Massport and request that additional noise monitors within the community.

420
01:33:51,043 --> 01:33:52,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

421
01:33:54,967 --> 01:33:55,267
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

422
01:33:55,868 --> 01:34:03,550
[SPEAKER_13]: President Caraviello, I would just first like to amend this and also request that there be a noise monitor in South Medford.

423
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:07,151
[SPEAKER_13]: Over the last several weeks, South Medford has picked up in flights.

424
01:34:07,231 --> 01:34:16,853
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually went down there last night and again, every minute, especially over the Columbus Park area and the entire South Medford, I guess, is getting hit pretty bad.

425
01:34:17,313 --> 01:34:21,714
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully we will see a decrease to a level in a couple of weeks when the two

426
01:34:22,389 --> 01:34:27,671
[SPEAKER_13]: runways that are under maintenance are back up and running, but we still have the problem with the 33L.

427
01:34:28,351 --> 01:34:38,035
[SPEAKER_13]: I know the mayor's office has sent a request to Massport that we be provided another noise monitoring device above the Andrews School.

428
01:34:38,496 --> 01:34:51,601
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think the council, if we could get a vote tonight and send a letter from the entire council to Massport and to our state delegation requesting that they do whatever they can to obviously

429
01:34:52,031 --> 01:34:58,256
[SPEAKER_13]: alleviate the noise, but more importantly, what will go with that is the noise monitoring systems.

430
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:03,940
[SPEAKER_13]: One over the Andrews, one over the Heights, and one over South Medford should cover the problem areas.

431
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:07,603
[SPEAKER_13]: I know Wellington's getting hit good, but the Andrews should cover that.

432
01:35:07,623 --> 01:35:14,188
[SPEAKER_13]: I think any noise monitoring devices that we can get in Medford are going to be beneficial because they're going to track the levels.

433
01:35:14,328 --> 01:35:21,734
[SPEAKER_13]: And once the levels are what obviously residents are reporting, sometimes they're flying the way they should, but other times

434
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:27,041
[SPEAKER_13]: If it comes over directly above your home, you feel like the plane is landing on your house.

435
01:35:27,121 --> 01:35:31,063
[SPEAKER_13]: So we need to figure out how often that is happening, because it shouldn't be.

436
01:35:31,463 --> 01:35:38,646
[SPEAKER_13]: And that will hopefully help us in getting some relief with regards to what can be done.

437
01:35:38,666 --> 01:35:41,407
[SPEAKER_13]: I know MIT is on their second portion of the study.

438
01:35:42,047 --> 01:35:48,229
[SPEAKER_13]: And we need to figure out what can be done to help Medford, whether that be flying higher, taking different routes.

439
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:51,871
[SPEAKER_13]: Something needs to be done to help Medford, even after the

440
01:35:52,648 --> 01:35:55,410
[SPEAKER_13]: the end of June date we're getting.

441
01:35:56,010 --> 01:36:15,962
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would just like to back the mayor up on the Andrew School Monitor, request two additional ones, and make sure that the city council, as amended, sends a letter requesting this to Massport and also to our entire state delegation to push and help Medford with this problem that so many are stricken by.

442
01:36:15,982 --> 01:36:16,942
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

443
01:36:17,403 --> 01:36:17,903
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Neistat.

444
01:36:18,499 --> 01:36:19,740
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

445
01:36:19,981 --> 01:36:27,088
[SPEAKER_16]: I certainly think that noise monitors will help us in our plight against Massport and the airplane noise that we have in our community.

446
01:36:27,889 --> 01:36:34,735
[SPEAKER_16]: I do have a question, maybe we can put this in as a B paper, as to how the location of the Andrews School was selected.

447
01:36:35,736 --> 01:36:37,638
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that we've had a number of discussions about

448
01:36:38,703 --> 01:36:42,666
[SPEAKER_16]: locations of noise monitors, where we want to put them, so on and so forth.

449
01:36:42,706 --> 01:37:00,320
[SPEAKER_16]: If we're going to be requesting that a delegation expend funds and we're going to be requesting the placement of additional noise monitors, I guess my question is, do we want to take a longer how to look at it and study whether or not we can get more bank for our buck with the placement of three towers in different locations that may cover the entire city?

450
01:37:00,340 --> 01:37:02,662
[SPEAKER_16]: Because it's my understanding we have one tower in the community now.

451
01:37:03,122 --> 01:37:06,865
[SPEAKER_16]: If we had four towers in the community, we'd be able to cover the whole city of Method.

452
01:37:07,366 --> 01:37:10,368
[SPEAKER_16]: How was this location selected, I guess, would be my first question, Mr. President.

453
01:37:11,569 --> 01:37:11,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

454
01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:13,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information.

455
01:37:13,210 --> 01:37:13,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

456
01:37:14,491 --> 01:37:15,212
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information.

457
01:37:15,492 --> 01:37:18,454
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

458
01:37:18,894 --> 01:37:20,596
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's a great question.

459
01:37:20,676 --> 01:37:27,080
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think the reason why the mayor chose the Andrews Middle School is because, and I attended with a number of my colleagues.

460
01:37:27,141 --> 01:37:35,086
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't remember exactly who was there, but Luke Presner from CAC board and Peter Hook.

461
01:37:35,467 --> 01:37:35,647
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

462
01:37:37,027 --> 01:37:41,569
[SPEAKER_13]: They gave us a great outline of what's going on and what's taking place.

463
01:37:42,089 --> 01:37:52,332
[SPEAKER_13]: And the new GPS system that they've been using since, oh, for a few years now, it tracks all planes out of 33L that are going in this location.

464
01:37:52,352 --> 01:37:55,233
[SPEAKER_13]: They come over the Andrews and then they disperse.

465
01:37:55,753 --> 01:38:04,155
[SPEAKER_13]: So the Andrews was picked because every single plane that flies out of Logan that is coming through Medford is going over the Andrews school and then

466
01:38:06,727 --> 01:38:07,808
[SPEAKER_13]: going in different directions.

467
01:38:07,848 --> 01:38:33,940
[SPEAKER_13]: So some are going over South Medford, some are going over the Heights, but I think that obviously is the number one place that it needs to go, which is why obviously the mayor's requesting that, but where the complaints are coming from the Heights and South Medford just as much, maybe not as, I mean, I'm getting complaints from everywhere, but South Medford, North Medford and the Heights are the three locations where I'm seeing all the complaints.

468
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,681
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think if we can request,

469
01:38:36,525 --> 01:38:37,486
[SPEAKER_13]: as many as possible.

470
01:38:37,546 --> 01:38:43,811
[SPEAKER_13]: Obviously, three, I think, would cover where the complaints are coming from and where I've seen the problem.

471
01:38:43,851 --> 01:38:44,832
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that would be helpful.

472
01:38:45,693 --> 01:38:46,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

473
01:38:46,453 --> 01:38:46,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Layton.

474
01:38:47,494 --> 01:39:02,566
[SPEAKER_16]: So the reason that the Andrews Middle School would be the selected location is because, based upon the information that a Massport CLC representative has told us, is that 100% of the aircrafts that fly out of Logan on that runway will go over that beacon?

475
01:39:03,087 --> 01:39:03,227
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

476
01:39:04,318 --> 01:39:10,823
[SPEAKER_03]: So if 100% of the- Well, from their studies, they're saying that they go to the Andrews and then they split.

477
01:39:11,443 --> 01:39:13,585
[SPEAKER_16]: So 100% of the planes are going to fly over there.

478
01:39:14,625 --> 01:39:15,866
[SPEAKER_16]: A decent amount of them, yes.

479
01:39:18,968 --> 01:39:19,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

480
01:39:19,949 --> 01:39:20,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

481
01:39:20,850 --> 01:39:23,952
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to thank Councilor Longo-Kerr for bringing this resolution forward.

482
01:39:24,612 --> 01:39:28,235
[SPEAKER_10]: This is an issue that I get calls about all the time.

483
01:39:28,255 --> 01:39:32,278
[SPEAKER_10]: And like you said, it doesn't matter really what part of the city you live in.

484
01:39:32,932 --> 01:39:33,953
[SPEAKER_10]: It impacts everyone.

485
01:39:34,133 --> 01:39:35,374
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's unfortunate.

486
01:39:35,894 --> 01:39:40,297
[SPEAKER_10]: I was at that meeting about a month ago that they had right here at City Hall, and the place was packed.

487
01:39:41,017 --> 01:39:43,258
[SPEAKER_10]: And it really does impact the quality of life.

488
01:39:43,298 --> 01:39:46,000
[SPEAKER_10]: We should be doing everything we can to combat this.

489
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:55,886
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I've actually been communicating to people in the community to call the Massport line and to log complaints online.

490
01:39:56,447 --> 01:39:57,247
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're right.

491
01:39:57,347 --> 01:40:02,050
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of the things that they did mention that night was all of the planes, basically, when they take off, they come

492
01:40:02,401 --> 01:40:04,942
[SPEAKER_10]: basically right down Riverside Ave, right over the Andrews.

493
01:40:05,002 --> 01:40:08,184
[SPEAKER_10]: So it does sound like probably a good place to have the beacon.

494
01:40:08,864 --> 01:40:26,654
[SPEAKER_10]: But the thing to really keep in mind here is that that night at the meeting, what they mentioned is this problem is really only going to get worse because of the reconfiguration of, I think it was Terminal E, and there's going to be over the next, I think, five years, there's going to be more carriers leaving it at off-peak times.

495
01:40:27,014 --> 01:40:30,676
[SPEAKER_10]: So this problem, I know people say, well, once they repair that runway,

496
01:40:31,547 --> 01:40:32,968
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's going to get better.

497
01:40:33,488 --> 01:40:38,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it will get better for the short term, but for the long term, this is a problem that's going to impact us for a very long time.

498
01:40:39,249 --> 01:40:42,010
[SPEAKER_10]: So we really need to make sure that we stay on top of this.

499
01:40:42,030 --> 01:40:43,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for bringing this forward.

500
01:40:43,610 --> 01:40:52,673
[SPEAKER_10]: And people really need to continue to make sure that they call the Massport noise line and to log their complaints online as well.

501
01:40:53,353 --> 01:40:54,313
[SPEAKER_10]: It does have an impact.

502
01:40:54,513 --> 01:40:59,315
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see in Milton, the city of Milton, that it had an impact.

503
01:41:00,660 --> 01:41:03,121
[SPEAKER_10]: thousands and thousands of more complaints than we do.

504
01:41:03,521 --> 01:41:10,964
[SPEAKER_10]: So people really need to get out, voice their opinion, and let Massport know that this is a problem, and it does impact the quality of life.

505
01:41:10,984 --> 01:41:14,346
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd just like to thank you for bringing this forward, and I second the motion.

506
01:41:14,866 --> 01:41:15,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

507
01:41:15,606 --> 01:41:15,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

508
01:41:15,866 --> 01:41:16,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Dello Russo.

509
01:41:17,027 --> 01:41:17,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Call 617-561-3333.

510
01:41:17,307 --> 01:41:18,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Dello Russo.

511
01:41:18,968 --> 01:41:19,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Mox.

512
01:41:20,488 --> 01:41:21,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

513
01:41:30,267 --> 01:41:36,350
[SPEAKER_02]: This council, I think it was back a couple of months ago, took a vote to ask that another monitor be added to the city.

514
01:41:36,710 --> 01:41:39,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we gave a location, but at the time we asked.

515
01:41:40,111 --> 01:41:47,214
[SPEAKER_02]: The key to this issue, Mr. President, you know, we could talk all we want until we get our congressional delegation to stand up.

516
01:41:47,254 --> 01:41:49,875
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just mentioned by Councilor Falco and Milton.

517
01:41:50,635 --> 01:41:52,036
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Milton didn't do it on their own.

518
01:41:52,546 --> 01:41:57,595
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Congressman Lynch that stood up in the federal government, Mr. President.

519
01:41:57,855 --> 01:42:04,948
[SPEAKER_02]: He got the FFA to have a meeting, FAA to have a meeting, Mr. President, and they acted upon Congressman Lynch.

520
01:42:05,672 --> 01:42:09,734
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hate to say it, Mr. President, but that hasn't happened in this community yet.

521
01:42:10,074 --> 01:42:19,339
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't seen that level, Mr. President, of congressional delegation intervening on behalf of the city.

522
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:22,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing, and I don't want to rehash old news,

523
01:42:24,031 --> 01:42:29,898
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great, we have two great representatives on that community advisory committee now to Logan Airport.

524
01:42:30,439 --> 01:42:39,209
[SPEAKER_02]: And during those meetings, these local cities and towns all have a representative that sits so they can be at the table and they can add input.

525
01:42:39,629 --> 01:42:43,012
[SPEAKER_02]: when Logan Airport and the FAA are making decisions.

526
01:42:43,813 --> 01:42:53,621
[SPEAKER_02]: And for over five years, Mr. President, and this council brought it up over and over again, for over five years, Medford's representative on that committee was a no-show.

527
01:42:54,362 --> 01:42:55,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford was not representative.

528
01:42:55,783 --> 01:42:57,845
[SPEAKER_02]: I went and I pulled all the minute meetings

529
01:42:58,665 --> 01:43:03,749
[SPEAKER_02]: And it showed you where people and what communities were attending those meetings.

530
01:43:04,129 --> 01:43:10,294
[SPEAKER_02]: And Medford was a no-show for years, Mr. President, while a lot of this discussion and dialogue was happening.

531
01:43:10,934 --> 01:43:13,216
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great now that the mayor's on board.

532
01:43:13,556 --> 01:43:17,139
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great we have two excellent community advisory members.

533
01:43:17,539 --> 01:43:21,823
[SPEAKER_02]: But for years, we were not at the table, and this city was not representative.

534
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:24,361
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a problem, Mr. President.

535
01:43:24,661 --> 01:43:30,405
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope we're able to get around that now with our congressional delegation.

536
01:43:30,886 --> 01:43:44,034
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know with the renewed interest now in the Community Advisory Board and those particular two gentlemen who are very knowledgeable on air traffic and other issues, I believe we will be represented now.

537
01:43:44,114 --> 01:43:48,937
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think part of the problem was we were a no-show, Mr. President.

538
01:43:49,358 --> 01:43:49,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

539
01:43:52,506 --> 01:43:54,468
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

540
01:43:54,488 --> 01:43:57,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

541
01:43:57,290 --> 01:43:58,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address of the record, please.

542
01:43:58,911 --> 01:44:00,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

543
01:44:00,152 --> 01:44:01,553
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 281 Park Street.

544
01:44:02,033 --> 01:44:07,057
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very close to the Roberts Elementary School, which is also a heavy flyover area.

545
01:44:07,117 --> 01:44:08,338
[SPEAKER_01]: We get a lot of loud traffic.

546
01:44:08,939 --> 01:44:13,262
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to echo Councilor Falco that we definitely need to keep up the complaints.

547
01:44:13,702 --> 01:44:15,103
[SPEAKER_01]: They do factor those in.

548
01:44:15,223 --> 01:44:21,128
[SPEAKER_01]: And because we were absent for so long, other towns mitigation is our increased suffering.

549
01:44:21,628 --> 01:44:26,192
[SPEAKER_01]: The runway is actually not slated to be completely finished until November.

550
01:44:26,252 --> 01:44:28,954
[SPEAKER_01]: They expect it to open partially.

551
01:44:29,014 --> 01:44:34,778
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I read on their website as well as when I spoke to someone on the phone there.

552
01:44:35,379 --> 01:44:39,282
[SPEAKER_01]: So this noise isn't going to go away when the runway opens anyway.

553
01:44:39,702 --> 01:44:43,065
[SPEAKER_01]: The altitude is not going to increase when the runway opens.

554
01:44:43,085 --> 01:44:44,866
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm clocking planes between

555
01:44:45,501 --> 01:44:51,217
[SPEAKER_01]: a thousand and fifteen hundred feet coming over my house as late as three in the morning

556
01:44:52,078 --> 01:44:52,818
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very loud.

557
01:44:52,898 --> 01:44:53,779
[SPEAKER_01]: My house is shaking.

558
01:44:53,819 --> 01:44:56,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't put anything on the edge of a shelf or you're going to find it on the floor.

559
01:44:57,940 --> 01:44:59,901
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a very serious issue for us.

560
01:45:00,501 --> 01:45:05,702
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that we know exactly where the loudest parts are and the noise monitors are placed there.

561
01:45:06,082 --> 01:45:11,424
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if they do give mitigation to the city, they'll do it on a very narrow corridor.

562
01:45:11,464 --> 01:45:14,405
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll do it on very specific streets and addresses.

563
01:45:14,825 --> 01:45:20,827
[SPEAKER_01]: So if a neighborhood that is greatly impacted doesn't have a noise monitor, they may lose out on mitigation.

564
01:45:21,266 --> 01:45:23,151
[SPEAKER_01]: if there's not a monitor close enough to them.

565
01:45:23,612 --> 01:45:25,817
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a really important factor for us.

566
01:45:25,877 --> 01:45:28,885
[SPEAKER_01]: I did price out triple pane windows, which will reduce the noise.

567
01:45:29,321 --> 01:45:49,630
[SPEAKER_01]: and they will run $8,000 to $16,000 and that's just to add third pane to your existing windows because I did have all of my windows double pane replaced three years ago and I'm told that that is not enough by Massport to reduce the sound and that we would also have to get special soundproofing caulking so it could run up to $40,000 to make your house

568
01:45:52,032 --> 01:45:53,333
[SPEAKER_01]: 75% quieter.

569
01:45:53,914 --> 01:45:57,157
[SPEAKER_01]: And running noise machines all night.

570
01:45:57,477 --> 01:46:04,445
[SPEAKER_01]: My daughter's neurologist, my nine-year-old daughter, has said it's not good for your brain to not have time to rest at night.

571
01:46:04,525 --> 01:46:07,408
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a serious issue that I hope will be

572
01:46:08,427 --> 01:46:11,389
[SPEAKER_01]: greatly considered and we can get some action.

573
01:46:11,449 --> 01:46:21,457
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just meet Pat Jalen on Salem street a couple of weeks ago and we stood and watched the planes flying across Salem street for about 10 minutes and it was insane.

574
01:46:22,358 --> 01:46:22,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

575
01:46:23,238 --> 01:46:23,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

576
01:46:24,479 --> 01:46:29,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Mr. Clerk, if I can amend the paper that we also contact Congresswoman clock.

577
01:46:30,164 --> 01:46:33,166
[SPEAKER_03]: She was at the first meeting with the FAA.

578
01:46:33,907 --> 01:46:35,728
[SPEAKER_03]: If we could have her office be in contact also.

579
01:46:40,026 --> 01:46:41,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address of the record, please.

580
01:46:42,248 --> 01:46:46,331
[SPEAKER_14]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushion Street, 02155.

581
01:46:47,372 --> 01:46:51,075
[SPEAKER_14]: Really hate to repeat myself from past meetings on this issue.

582
01:46:52,456 --> 01:47:04,145
[SPEAKER_14]: However, the time to have spoke up and be at the table would have been pre, before 2007 when they built this runway, 330, whatever it's called.

583
01:47:05,950 --> 01:47:09,691
[SPEAKER_14]: But even then, we didn't have the power of Tip O'Neill.

584
01:47:10,831 --> 01:47:17,913
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure if we're going to be able to tell Massport and the FDA, whatever it's called, what to do.

585
01:47:18,894 --> 01:47:32,277
[SPEAKER_14]: However, since we are so blessed to have the Atlantic Ocean next to Boston, I would hope at least after a certain time, let's say 8, 9, 10 PM,

586
01:47:34,668 --> 01:47:37,869
[SPEAKER_14]: Seems like 11 o'clock news, they start coming hot and heavy.

587
01:47:39,609 --> 01:47:42,370
[SPEAKER_14]: 1130, as the lady behind me said, three in the morning.

588
01:47:43,330 --> 01:47:44,830
[SPEAKER_14]: I wouldn't know because I'm dead asleep.

589
01:47:47,351 --> 01:47:55,793
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe they could be businesslike and it would work out that after 9 p.m.

590
01:47:55,913 --> 01:48:01,914
[SPEAKER_14]: or 10, 11 at the latest, hopefully the children will stay asleep

591
01:48:02,935 --> 01:48:04,716
[SPEAKER_14]: take off over the Atlantic Ocean.

592
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:06,598
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I have to say.

593
01:48:11,802 --> 01:48:12,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

594
01:48:12,262 --> 01:48:13,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please.

595
01:48:13,683 --> 01:48:16,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Jean Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street, Medford.

596
01:48:17,026 --> 01:48:19,407
[SPEAKER_08]: I've inquired a few times in a few different places.

597
01:48:21,869 --> 01:48:22,550
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can't hear me.

598
01:48:22,570 --> 01:48:22,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

599
01:48:23,170 --> 01:48:26,433
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've inquired in a few different places, and I've looked online.

600
01:48:27,073 --> 01:48:30,736
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is perplexing to me that any other business

601
01:48:31,454 --> 01:48:34,955
[SPEAKER_08]: has to comply with our zoning ordinance for noise.

602
01:48:34,975 --> 01:48:38,136
[SPEAKER_08]: 11 o'clock to 7 o'clock, you can't make a peep.

603
01:48:38,517 --> 01:48:41,338
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't run a construction site before 7 AM.

604
01:48:42,078 --> 01:48:42,938
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't do anything.

605
01:48:42,978 --> 01:48:49,541
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't even play my radio outside after 11 without being visited if a neighbor decides that that's not acceptable.

606
01:48:50,241 --> 01:48:57,203
[SPEAKER_08]: So why then are we being exposed to this type of noise overnight?

607
01:48:57,684 --> 01:49:01,105
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really detrimental to our health, and I wonder if

608
01:49:01,892 --> 01:49:20,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps you couldn't bring to bear your resources to investigate if perhaps we can do something to curtail the noise, because it really is the worst at night when people are trying to sleep, especially that Cafe 331 that comes over at 2.30 in the morning.

609
01:49:20,565 --> 01:49:21,806
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an Airbus 380.

610
01:49:22,206 --> 01:49:26,489
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the largest plane there is, and it's coming over in the dead of the night on a regular basis.

611
01:49:26,609 --> 01:49:27,490
[SPEAKER_08]: It's terrible.

612
01:49:27,970 --> 01:49:30,852
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe you can investigate our noise.

613
01:49:31,460 --> 01:49:34,882
[SPEAKER_08]: noise ordinance, and if there's some way it can protect us in some manner.

614
01:49:35,863 --> 01:49:36,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

615
01:49:37,464 --> 01:49:46,029
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe the implementation of GPS trackers is part of the federal government's edict to Massport to transition from a beacon system to a GPS system.

616
01:49:46,389 --> 01:49:55,374
[SPEAKER_16]: And as part of that, it's a directive of the federal government, which would preclude the city of Method from going up the chain and suing the state government or the federal government due to federal preemption.

617
01:49:56,635 --> 01:49:57,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

618
01:49:59,756 --> 01:50:00,457
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion.

619
01:50:01,325 --> 01:50:11,431
[SPEAKER_03]: By Councilor Lungo-Koehn, as amended by Councilor Knight, and as amended by President Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Falco.

620
01:50:12,112 --> 01:50:14,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call vote has been requested.

621
01:50:18,816 --> 01:50:19,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Dello Russo?

622
01:50:20,237 --> 01:50:20,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

623
01:50:21,337 --> 01:50:22,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco?

624
01:50:22,218 --> 01:50:22,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

625
01:50:22,938 --> 01:50:23,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

626
01:50:23,499 --> 01:50:23,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

627
01:50:24,299 --> 01:50:24,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn?

628
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:25,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

629
01:50:25,980 --> 01:50:26,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Marks?

630
01:50:26,861 --> 01:50:27,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

631
01:50:27,601 --> 01:50:28,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Stappelli?

632
01:50:28,402 --> 01:50:28,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

633
01:50:30,176 --> 01:50:32,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

634
01:50:32,957 --> 01:50:35,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

635
01:50:35,039 --> 01:50:39,902
[SPEAKER_03]: 17-524, offered by Vice President Marks and Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

636
01:50:40,362 --> 01:50:55,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the administration provide the council with a plan for next year and a plan moving forward for the use of the former Hegner Center site located at Maple Park, which was recently acquired back by the city of Method.

637
01:50:55,812 --> 01:50:57,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President, Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

638
01:50:59,383 --> 01:51:01,145
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll yield to my senior member.

639
01:51:01,866 --> 01:51:05,651
[SPEAKER_13]: Not only have you been on top of this issue, but, well, senior in age.

640
01:51:06,592 --> 01:51:08,194
[SPEAKER_02]: No, late to service.

641
01:51:08,214 --> 01:51:08,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Late to service.

642
01:51:11,018 --> 01:51:11,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Box.

643
01:51:15,123 --> 01:51:16,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

644
01:51:17,810 --> 01:51:30,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I offered a resolution, I think it was back three months ago, asking the city administration if we could just get an update on the property formerly known as the Hegner Center on Maple Park Ave.

645
01:51:31,178 --> 01:51:43,105
[SPEAKER_02]: As we all know, that particular property was deeded over to the Hegner Center back some many years ago with the express purpose of using it for persons with disability.

646
01:51:43,745 --> 01:51:46,367
[SPEAKER_02]: And once that building was no longer being used for that,

647
01:51:47,027 --> 01:51:54,231
[SPEAKER_02]: express purpose, it should revert back to the city, according to the documents that were signed.

648
01:51:56,112 --> 01:51:58,614
[SPEAKER_02]: The Hegner Center was taken over by Bridgewell.

649
01:51:59,334 --> 01:52:09,160
[SPEAKER_02]: They provide very similar services, and Bridgewell back, I think it was a year, year and a half ago, decided that they were gonna sell the building.

650
01:52:09,958 --> 01:52:21,302
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a building they never owned, never paid a dollar for, and I believe it was up on the market for some $560,000 or right around that, Mr. President.

651
01:52:21,942 --> 01:52:28,584
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was this council that took a vote asking the city solicitor to step in on behalf of the city.

652
01:52:29,324 --> 01:52:38,867
[SPEAKER_02]: And after his due diligence, indeed, that building was vacant for some time, Mr. President, and it wasn't being used for

653
01:52:39,774 --> 01:52:44,397
[SPEAKER_02]: its intended purpose of aiding and helping people with disabilities.

654
01:52:45,098 --> 01:52:50,161
[SPEAKER_02]: And the city solicitor was able to negotiate the building back to the city of Method.

655
01:52:50,501 --> 01:52:56,886
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we have a building, Mr. President, in my opinion, could be repurposed for a number of uses.

656
01:52:57,486 --> 01:52:59,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I think at the time this council voted,

657
01:52:59,654 --> 01:53:08,320
[SPEAKER_02]: to potentially put the Medford Arts Center in there or maybe the Medford Arts Council and create an art center in that particular area.

658
01:53:08,861 --> 01:53:17,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Residents across the street and the condos are very concerned because they see activity going on in the building and they're not quite sure what's happening.

659
01:53:18,147 --> 01:53:24,832
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think both myself and Councilor Lungo-Koehn, and she'll speak for herself, but put this on tonight, Mr. President,

660
01:53:25,259 --> 01:53:28,163
[SPEAKER_02]: so we can get a direction on where we're gonna go with the building.

661
01:53:28,583 --> 01:53:35,272
[SPEAKER_02]: The longer it sits vacant, we all know what happens to vacant buildings in this community, it's gonna get into disrepair.

662
01:53:36,019 --> 01:53:42,461
[SPEAKER_02]: And not to say that building doesn't need work anyways, but we have purposes that we could use for that building.

663
01:53:43,081 --> 01:53:46,562
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would ask that we sit down with the city administration.

664
01:53:46,922 --> 01:53:48,522
[SPEAKER_02]: We asked for a response, Mr. President.

665
01:53:48,883 --> 01:53:50,083
[SPEAKER_02]: We really didn't get a response.

666
01:53:50,443 --> 01:54:01,666
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's time we sit down with the city administration and the committee of the whole and directly ask what is the intent and what is the city going to use that building now that it's back in the city hands, Mr. President.

667
01:54:02,574 --> 01:54:03,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

668
01:54:03,454 --> 01:54:06,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I do know that the Medford Police do use that for training.

669
01:54:07,675 --> 01:54:08,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

670
01:54:09,055 --> 01:54:10,415
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

671
01:54:10,975 --> 01:54:31,959
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks gave a good overview, and I agree with what he said, and I think this sparked, people have been asking what is going on, and then there was some activity from the Medford Police, and Councilor Marks and I, I think helps get the questions answered with regards to dog training, and we talked to Chief Sacco, who said that the city did give permission to do that,

672
01:54:32,469 --> 01:54:33,950
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's all well and good.

673
01:54:34,070 --> 01:54:36,090
[SPEAKER_13]: But what is the plan?

674
01:54:36,130 --> 01:54:50,536
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would actually like to know something, whether there's been discussions about it, the potential uses for it, the potential for putting money into the building for certain purposes, such as an arts facility.

675
01:54:51,297 --> 01:54:54,858
[SPEAKER_13]: Just would like some sort of answer before we vote on this year's budget.

676
01:54:55,078 --> 01:54:56,779
[SPEAKER_13]: We haven't seen anywhere in the budget.

677
01:54:57,299 --> 01:55:00,700
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would like to know if, obviously, it's not going to be in fiscal year 2018 budget.

678
01:55:02,699 --> 01:55:04,100
[SPEAKER_13]: What is our plan down the line?

679
01:55:04,761 --> 01:55:11,305
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't in the capital plan, the draft capital plan that we got five, six, seven months ago.

680
01:55:11,325 --> 01:55:12,546
[SPEAKER_13]: That has been altered.

681
01:55:12,586 --> 01:55:14,247
[SPEAKER_13]: We haven't got a new capital plan.

682
01:55:14,407 --> 01:55:15,728
[SPEAKER_13]: Would it be in the new capital plan?

683
01:55:15,828 --> 01:55:16,409
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure.

684
01:55:16,429 --> 01:55:17,569
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't in the first one.

685
01:55:17,670 --> 01:55:19,791
[SPEAKER_13]: So what are we going to do with the building?

686
01:55:19,831 --> 01:55:20,892
[SPEAKER_13]: And Councilmax is right.

687
01:55:20,912 --> 01:55:26,196
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it just going to deteriorate year after year, and we're going to get nothing out of it and put nothing into it?

688
01:55:26,636 --> 01:55:27,757
[SPEAKER_13]: Or are we going to maintain it?

689
01:55:28,417 --> 01:55:29,038
[SPEAKER_13]: What is our plan?

690
01:55:30,816 --> 01:55:32,377
[SPEAKER_13]: matter what, I think we just need the answer.

691
01:55:32,397 --> 01:55:35,359
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's important because it's a good-sized building.

692
01:55:35,399 --> 01:55:36,300
[SPEAKER_13]: It's in a neighborhood.

693
01:55:37,241 --> 01:55:38,641
[SPEAKER_13]: These neighbors pay taxes.

694
01:55:39,022 --> 01:55:42,144
[SPEAKER_13]: They want to know what's going on, what's going to happen.

695
01:55:42,224 --> 01:55:47,848
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we could get some sort of answer before we vote on the budget, I think that would be beneficial.

696
01:55:47,908 --> 01:55:49,789
[SPEAKER_13]: And it would get a lot of questions answered.

697
01:55:49,809 --> 01:55:54,492
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'll be able to tell the residents and the neighborhood what the potential plan is.

698
01:55:54,612 --> 01:55:57,174
[SPEAKER_13]: Or A, B, and C may happen.

699
01:55:57,194 --> 01:55:59,135
[SPEAKER_13]: I think everybody has a right to know.

700
01:55:59,707 --> 01:56:05,632
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, it could be very expensive to maintain the building for the long run if we're not going to create a use for it.

701
01:56:05,872 --> 01:56:07,113
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so I think that's important.

702
01:56:07,573 --> 01:56:07,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

703
01:56:08,574 --> 01:56:09,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

704
01:56:09,535 --> 01:56:10,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

705
01:56:10,355 --> 01:56:12,637
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to thank my council colleagues for bringing this forward.

706
01:56:12,657 --> 01:56:14,178
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is a very important issue.

707
01:56:14,198 --> 01:56:21,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and you're right, it's a very important piece of property and there are a number of, um, groups that could use this as a home in the future.

708
01:56:21,024 --> 01:56:23,025
[SPEAKER_10]: The arts, recreation, you name it.

709
01:56:23,666 --> 01:56:25,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, it's, it's a, it's,

710
01:56:25,675 --> 01:56:27,336
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a prime opportunity.

711
01:56:27,697 --> 01:56:29,918
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I'm glad it's back in the city's hands.

712
01:56:31,119 --> 01:56:40,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Back when the Council of Marks brought this forward a few months ago, I amended the resolution because I thought that we should honestly have a committee of the whole meeting to actually walk through the site.

713
01:56:41,707 --> 01:56:45,469
[SPEAKER_10]: The property has not been in the control of the city for many years.

714
01:56:46,190 --> 01:56:50,593
[SPEAKER_10]: And we should really see firsthand, I think, the condition of the building and what we're getting back.

715
01:56:51,414 --> 01:56:54,556
[SPEAKER_10]: But if that's not going to happen, I'd like to amend the paper, if you don't mind.

716
01:56:54,957 --> 01:57:10,188
[SPEAKER_10]: that we get a report back from the building department that gives us basically a report back to us about the overall condition of the building, you know, with regard to, you know, heating or windows, roofing, I mean, anything like that.

717
01:57:10,208 --> 01:57:12,550
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, this is something that we need to consider.

718
01:57:13,231 --> 01:57:14,231
[SPEAKER_10]: We should know about this.

719
01:57:14,291 --> 01:57:16,813
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, these are very important matters.

720
01:57:16,873 --> 01:57:19,275
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, anytime you have a building like this, that's,

721
01:57:21,650 --> 01:57:23,371
[SPEAKER_10]: That's part of your city.

722
01:57:23,431 --> 01:57:34,115
[SPEAKER_10]: And you really need to know and keep an eye on the maintenance, the preventive maintenance, what kind of money has been spent or is going to be spent, what kind of money it's going to take to bring this back online.

723
01:57:34,535 --> 01:57:39,637
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I assume it's probably ready to go, because it was functioning not too long ago.

724
01:57:39,677 --> 01:57:46,560
[SPEAKER_10]: But I really think we should, as a council and as a city, know what we're getting back from Bridgewell.

725
01:57:46,680 --> 01:57:49,601
[SPEAKER_10]: So if I could amend the paper to include that, I'd greatly appreciate it.

726
01:57:50,001 --> 01:57:51,282
[SPEAKER_10]: And I second that resolution.

727
01:57:53,100 --> 01:57:53,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli.

728
01:57:54,381 --> 01:57:54,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

729
01:57:55,121 --> 01:57:55,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, again, thank you.

730
01:57:56,661 --> 01:57:58,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, my fellow councilors bringing this forward.

731
01:57:58,342 --> 01:58:05,505
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that just to shed some light, this is one of the, uh, first meetings we had with, uh, the recreation focus group.

732
01:58:05,525 --> 01:58:08,106
[SPEAKER_11]: We talked about, um, facilities.

733
01:58:08,786 --> 01:58:19,891
[SPEAKER_11]: And one thing we did talk about and have met with the mayor's office is that, uh, a dual function, whether it's recreation, whether it's the art council or, um, or S or such other,

734
01:58:20,655 --> 01:58:30,080
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, facility, but I know that they've had, um, the building inspectors in there and for the sole purpose to see what we can do for housing.

735
01:58:30,741 --> 01:58:35,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, such very important, uh, um, initiatives.

736
01:58:35,143 --> 01:58:37,284
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that they've, they've been doing that.

737
01:58:37,324 --> 01:58:47,429
[SPEAKER_11]: So I too, if we can call for that committee of the whole meeting and, and get an update because I, you know, the, uh, the activity that was there could have been, uh, the,

738
01:58:49,537 --> 01:58:52,539
[SPEAKER_11]: the builders that were looking in to see what needed to be done there.

739
01:58:53,039 --> 01:58:54,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously we know the police have been there.

740
01:58:54,821 --> 01:59:02,966
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, I know that the mayor's office has been actively, uh, searching and working with that site to see what's best for the city of Method.

741
01:59:03,006 --> 01:59:05,248
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm pretty excited about the possibility.

742
01:59:05,288 --> 01:59:06,769
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for your input.

743
01:59:07,209 --> 01:59:07,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

744
01:59:07,609 --> 01:59:08,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

745
01:59:09,030 --> 01:59:10,071
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Neistat.

746
01:59:10,111 --> 01:59:11,552
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

747
01:59:12,012 --> 01:59:16,015
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, may I be so bold as to suggest that we tabled this matter for one week

748
01:59:17,164 --> 01:59:21,126
[SPEAKER_16]: For the simple reason that tomorrow night we're having our budget hearings with the building commissioner.

749
01:59:21,866 --> 01:59:25,808
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe this building falls under the jurisdiction of the building commissioner right now as it's a city-owned parcel.

750
01:59:25,888 --> 01:59:26,328
[SPEAKER_16]: It's vacant.

751
01:59:26,728 --> 01:59:28,209
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're having our meeting with them tomorrow night.

752
01:59:28,709 --> 01:59:38,113
[SPEAKER_16]: We might be able to get some of these questions answered tomorrow night during our budget debates or our budget discussions without having to send a paper to the administration and having to wait for it to go through the proper protocols.

753
01:59:38,133 --> 01:59:38,773
[SPEAKER_16]: We take the paper.

754
01:59:38,813 --> 01:59:39,613
[SPEAKER_16]: We send it to the mayor.

755
01:59:39,633 --> 01:59:40,494
[SPEAKER_16]: The mayor takes the paper.

756
01:59:40,514 --> 01:59:42,054
[SPEAKER_16]: She refers it to the appropriate department.

757
01:59:42,074 --> 01:59:43,495
[SPEAKER_16]: The appropriate department gets the paper.

758
01:59:44,025 --> 01:59:47,168
[SPEAKER_16]: notifies the mayor that they're in receipt, puts a report together, sends it to the city clerk.

759
01:59:47,328 --> 01:59:49,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Could we turn off the radio in the back?

760
01:59:52,573 --> 01:59:56,917
[SPEAKER_16]: The city clerk, the city clerk then takes that paper and puts it back in our packet as a response.

761
01:59:56,937 --> 02:00:02,382
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it might be a little bit more efficient, Mr. President, if we, um, considered tabling the matter for one week, brought the matter up.

762
02:00:02,442 --> 02:00:03,243
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you making a motion?

763
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:05,701
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I mean, I think that this isn't my resolution.

764
02:00:05,741 --> 02:00:07,601
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a resolution that's been brought forward by two Councilors.

765
02:00:07,661 --> 02:00:10,422
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been seconded, thirded, and fourthed at this point in time, Mr. President.

766
02:00:10,462 --> 02:00:14,583
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think that this is an alternative course of action that we can take where we may get an answer a little bit quicker.

767
02:00:15,364 --> 02:00:20,285
[SPEAKER_16]: So if it's the body's wishes and the delegation's wishes to go through the process and wait for a response back, that's great.

768
02:00:20,905 --> 02:00:25,687
[SPEAKER_16]: If we want to table it and maybe have a meeting tomorrow with the building commissioner and ask him about it, or do both for that matter.

769
02:00:25,707 --> 02:00:27,528
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, we can raise the issue tomorrow with the budget hearings.

770
02:00:27,568 --> 02:00:28,028
[SPEAKER_16]: That's fine.

771
02:00:28,768 --> 02:00:31,509
[SPEAKER_16]: I just think that for us to send the paper forward and then ask for a response

772
02:00:32,682 --> 02:00:40,806
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, have the approval of the budget be contingent upon a report back on the Agnes Center, it might be more expedient for us to sit down with the building commissioner and discuss this issue.

773
02:00:40,826 --> 02:00:45,788
[SPEAKER_16]: They're going to be before us tomorrow night anyway, provided we provide him with the notice that this is a topic of conversation.

774
02:00:45,828 --> 02:00:50,110
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think he'll have any problem discussing it tomorrow when answering some of the questions and concerns that we have.

775
02:00:50,650 --> 02:00:57,773
[SPEAKER_16]: If we need to delve further into the situation, then we can put a paper forward addressing the specific questions that we want answered that have ever been unanswered.

776
02:00:59,005 --> 02:01:02,327
[SPEAKER_16]: But again, I certainly would defer to the wisdom of the body.

777
02:01:02,347 --> 02:01:05,009
[SPEAKER_16]: I just think that this might be a more expedient way to get it done.

778
02:01:07,750 --> 02:01:08,291
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to table it?

779
02:01:08,411 --> 02:01:11,393
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't want to table it.

780
02:01:11,413 --> 02:01:16,876
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we talked about it tonight, and some of the questions were at least beautiful.

781
02:01:16,896 --> 02:01:17,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

782
02:01:18,217 --> 02:01:18,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Dello Russo.

783
02:01:20,138 --> 02:01:26,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I think it's unwise and unnecessary to make the response on this paper

784
02:01:26,917 --> 02:01:29,698
[SPEAKER_04]: a contingent factor in the approval of the budget.

785
02:01:33,079 --> 02:01:33,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Council Member O'Karn.

786
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:35,480
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just going to move forward.

787
02:01:35,720 --> 02:01:36,921
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not making a contingent.

788
02:01:37,461 --> 02:01:39,542
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven people have to vote on the budget separately.

789
02:01:39,722 --> 02:01:41,903
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just saying I would like to have an answer myself.

790
02:01:42,083 --> 02:01:43,103
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm speaking for myself.

791
02:01:43,183 --> 02:01:44,063
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd move approval.

792
02:01:44,404 --> 02:01:45,604
[SPEAKER_13]: Roll call vote.

793
02:01:46,364 --> 02:01:50,026
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

794
02:01:50,306 --> 02:01:53,387
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor

795
02:01:54,946 --> 02:02:00,888
[SPEAKER_03]: by Vice President Mox and Councilor Lungo-Koehn as amended by Councilor Falco and Councilor Knight.

796
02:02:02,008 --> 02:02:03,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call vote has been requested.

797
02:02:03,769 --> 02:02:13,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco?

798
02:02:13,472 --> 02:02:13,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

799
02:02:14,113 --> 02:02:14,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

800
02:02:14,673 --> 02:02:14,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

801
02:02:15,578 --> 02:02:16,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor McPherson?

802
02:02:16,198 --> 02:02:16,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

803
02:02:16,478 --> 02:02:17,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Monk?

804
02:02:17,618 --> 02:02:17,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

805
02:02:17,778 --> 02:02:19,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scott Valley?

806
02:02:19,319 --> 02:02:19,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

807
02:02:19,619 --> 02:02:20,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Caraviello?

808
02:02:20,999 --> 02:02:21,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

809
02:02:22,199 --> 02:02:22,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Assemblyman DiFermina?

810
02:02:22,799 --> 02:02:23,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me say yes to my resolution.

811
02:02:23,899 --> 02:02:24,720
[SPEAKER_03]: None of the negative.

812
02:02:25,060 --> 02:02:25,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

813
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:27,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to take hands.

814
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:30,981
[SPEAKER_03]: And the paper in the hands of the clerk by Councilor Knight.

815
02:02:31,581 --> 02:02:33,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded by Councilor Dela Russa.

816
02:02:33,141 --> 02:02:34,601
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

817
02:02:34,741 --> 02:02:35,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

818
02:02:36,141 --> 02:02:38,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

819
02:02:38,162 --> 02:02:40,022
[SPEAKER_03]: 17-527, offered by Councilor Knight.

820
02:02:40,082 --> 02:02:45,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the administration report back to the council the status of the lighting upgrades

821
02:02:45,874 --> 02:02:49,535
[SPEAKER_03]: at Medford Square, including a schedule of implementation.

822
02:02:49,955 --> 02:02:50,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

823
02:02:51,836 --> 02:02:55,998
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, on Saturday morning, we had our budget discussions and Chief Sacker was before us.

824
02:02:56,078 --> 02:03:04,540
[SPEAKER_16]: And we had a long and very fulfilling discussion about Medford Square and some ways to make Medford Square a little bit safer.

825
02:03:05,101 --> 02:03:08,842
[SPEAKER_16]: And one of the easiest ways that was noted was to improve the lighting in Medford Square.

826
02:03:09,461 --> 02:03:16,667
[SPEAKER_16]: This council has been very proactive in looking at the lighting and the fixtures, so on and so forth, that's going to be utilized down Medford Square.

827
02:03:16,987 --> 02:03:20,970
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's my understanding that we're almost at the point of implementation.

828
02:03:21,050 --> 02:03:34,420
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'd like to ask the city administration to provide us with the status of the upgrades, as well as a schedule for the implementation, so that we can share that information with the community, so that individuals that contact us with concerns about transient individuals in the square and safety concerns that they have.

829
02:03:35,015 --> 02:03:39,777
[SPEAKER_16]: can be addressed appropriately with some accurate information that shows that there is going to be some improvements in the area.

830
02:03:40,437 --> 02:03:40,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

831
02:03:40,877 --> 02:03:42,758
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by?

832
02:03:42,778 --> 02:03:42,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

833
02:03:44,218 --> 02:03:45,319
[SPEAKER_03]: By Councilor Scarpelli.

834
02:03:45,339 --> 02:03:45,919
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

835
02:03:45,939 --> 02:03:45,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

836
02:03:46,819 --> 02:03:47,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

837
02:03:47,839 --> 02:03:51,081
[SPEAKER_03]: 17-528 offered by Councilor Knight.

838
02:03:52,001 --> 02:04:03,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the City Administration provide a cost analysis and feasibility study regarding the information of video monitoring in our public parks and buildings.

839
02:04:03,165 --> 02:04:03,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

840
02:04:04,558 --> 02:04:10,922
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, yes, we've all seen a trend in government, see something, say something.

841
02:04:10,962 --> 02:04:12,663
[SPEAKER_16]: If you see something wrong, you say something.

842
02:04:12,843 --> 02:04:17,085
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think one way for us to see more is to have more rise across the community.

843
02:04:17,405 --> 02:04:21,548
[SPEAKER_16]: We've had a number of questions and concerns and issues that arise relative to our public parks.

844
02:04:21,588 --> 02:04:33,174
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a number of issues and concerns that arise relative to our publicly owned buildings, concerns about vandalism, concerns about injuries, concerns about crimes that may have been committed, concerns about the general maintenance and upkeep and what's going on in the neighborhood.

845
02:04:34,694 --> 02:04:47,417
[SPEAKER_16]: a very low-cost proposal for us to implement stronger security measures throughout the community and allow us to have more eyes on the ground, Mr. President, to allow us to go back and take a look and see what happened to this.

846
02:04:47,557 --> 02:04:48,197
[SPEAKER_16]: Why did it happen?

847
02:04:48,237 --> 02:04:48,857
[SPEAKER_16]: How did it happen?

848
02:04:48,937 --> 02:04:51,818
[SPEAKER_16]: Why is there a lot of dumping going on in this certain section of the community?

849
02:04:52,178 --> 02:04:55,758
[SPEAKER_16]: Why is this place structure continuously getting vandalized?

850
02:04:55,798 --> 02:04:58,819
[SPEAKER_16]: Why is this port-a-party in a public park continuously getting burnt down?

851
02:04:59,466 --> 02:05:05,211
[SPEAKER_16]: I think this will be a helpful tool in us identifying some of the concerns that we have in the community related to quality of life and public safety, Mr. President.

852
02:05:05,231 --> 02:05:08,774
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to move forward for approval and ask my council colleagues to support the paper.

853
02:05:09,374 --> 02:05:09,735
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

854
02:05:10,015 --> 02:05:10,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

855
02:05:11,136 --> 02:05:11,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

856
02:05:11,877 --> 02:05:13,698
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

857
02:05:13,718 --> 02:05:18,642
[SPEAKER_10]: This issue actually came up during a police community meeting a couple of months ago.

858
02:05:19,383 --> 02:05:26,108
[SPEAKER_10]: And talking to the members of the police department, you know, they talk a lot about how surrounding communities have

859
02:05:27,455 --> 02:05:35,521
[SPEAKER_10]: cameras in a lot of different intersections and whatnot, and how it's actually been key in solving crimes and whatnot.

860
02:05:35,701 --> 02:05:42,166
[SPEAKER_10]: And our city really does not have a lot of cameras, or I don't think any cameras, really, at any of our public places.

861
02:05:42,246 --> 02:05:44,648
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is a resolution that I definitely support.

862
02:05:45,369 --> 02:05:54,896
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd also like to see if the council wouldn't mind if we could amend it to actually look at the feasibility of putting them at some intersections upon consultation with the police, of course.

863
02:05:56,037 --> 02:05:56,998
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you wouldn't mind.

864
02:05:59,558 --> 02:06:00,439
[SPEAKER_10]: amending the resolution.

865
02:06:01,319 --> 02:06:01,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Greatly appreciate it.

866
02:06:02,019 --> 02:06:03,479
[SPEAKER_10]: And I second the motion.

867
02:06:05,100 --> 02:06:05,720
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

868
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:11,101
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I certainly have no problem with the individual, um, councilor amending the motion.

869
02:06:11,541 --> 02:06:18,442
[SPEAKER_16]: Ultimately, if we think about it, um, the Boston Marathon bombers were identified through, uh, traffic cameras that were in the community.

870
02:06:18,523 --> 02:06:20,723
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um, this is a measure that's only going to make us safer.

871
02:06:21,063 --> 02:06:25,244
[SPEAKER_16]: Week in and week out, we hear discussion about, um, roadways that are unsafe, speeding cars,

872
02:06:26,100 --> 02:06:29,182
[SPEAKER_16]: cars blowing through the four-way intersection at the bottom of Doonan Street, for example.

873
02:06:29,262 --> 02:06:38,468
[SPEAKER_16]: So maybe we have some problem intersections and some problem locations, and this would be a great idea, Mr. President, for us to combat some of those issues with the limited amount of manpower that we have.

874
02:06:38,508 --> 02:06:42,650
[SPEAKER_16]: We can embrace some technology and hopefully see some benefits in investing in technology.

875
02:06:42,850 --> 02:06:43,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

876
02:06:43,851 --> 02:06:47,773
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Falco.

877
02:06:48,173 --> 02:06:48,954
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

878
02:06:51,695 --> 02:06:52,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Mox.

879
02:06:54,111 --> 02:07:09,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so I understand, because the councilor just said something that, it's one thing to have a camera in place that may capture an incident that took place, but Councilor Light just mentioned about maybe cars that are going through intersections.

880
02:07:11,545 --> 02:07:17,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the intent to use this camera to catch people speeding or going through stop signs?

881
02:07:17,069 --> 02:07:19,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

882
02:07:21,684 --> 02:07:22,504
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

883
02:07:22,544 --> 02:07:23,545
[SPEAKER_16]: That would not be the intent.

884
02:07:23,565 --> 02:07:35,409
[SPEAKER_16]: In my understanding, based upon the discussions that I've had with the chief of police, is that certain sections of the general laws would need to be adopted before we can utilize traffic cameras to even consider issuing speeding and tickets or parking, moving violations.

885
02:07:35,649 --> 02:07:36,750
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's not my intent at all.

886
02:07:37,070 --> 02:07:49,675
[SPEAKER_16]: It's more or less a see something, say something opportunity for us to monitor the streets, and if something happens, have the ability to go back and review what those eyes have seen to maybe see if we can identify trends or identify certain

887
02:07:50,802 --> 02:08:01,747
[SPEAKER_16]: criteria that might contribute to public safety concerns, whether it be traffic backing up in the morning at Winthrop Street, so cars taking a left-hand turn go around the rotary once and then try to cut into the left-hand lane.

888
02:08:02,107 --> 02:08:09,330
[SPEAKER_16]: If we see a patent of involvement or a patent of activity at a certain location, maybe we can put a sign up there, a patent of activity where the police have to be called.

889
02:08:09,370 --> 02:08:19,175
[SPEAKER_16]: We can put the cameras up on those intersections and then take a look at what's going on there and then go back and monitor it and see if maybe we can control it through signage, through other traffic control devices, through education.

890
02:08:22,247 --> 02:08:22,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

891
02:08:23,027 --> 02:08:32,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, if I could, I don't have a problem with the way you just explained it, but you can also accomplish that by doing traffic studies, which we've done in the community.

892
02:08:33,630 --> 02:08:36,550
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if it's a helpful tool, I don't see a problem with it.

893
02:08:38,371 --> 02:08:43,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if we have the manpower to monitor these particular cameras, how it would be done.

894
02:08:43,872 --> 02:08:51,194
[SPEAKER_02]: We seem to not be able to do the very basic things in the community, and I'm not sure how we're going to monitor cameras

895
02:08:51,667 --> 02:08:54,029
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the community to make improvements.

896
02:08:54,069 --> 02:08:56,531
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess it's worth exploring.

897
02:08:57,352 --> 02:08:57,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

898
02:08:59,254 --> 02:09:00,215
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Neistat.

899
02:09:00,235 --> 02:09:04,959
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, as filed, my concern was more about public buildings and hot pox.

900
02:09:04,999 --> 02:09:07,741
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the paper was amended to address some certain intersections and streets.

901
02:09:07,922 --> 02:09:08,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

902
02:09:09,636 --> 02:09:10,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

903
02:09:10,716 --> 02:09:11,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

904
02:09:11,817 --> 02:09:37,426
[SPEAKER_10]: And the reason why I amended it was because it did come up at a police community meeting and the police officers that I talked to that were in the room and the detectives, they had mentioned that all the surrounding communities had these cameras in the very useful, uh, in, you know, especially if a crime has happened, you know, they can always consult the cameras or if there's a car chase or something like that, or if something happens in Somerville, uh, you know, and they come through Medford, you know, this, you know, they can actually see things on tape.

905
02:09:37,967 --> 02:09:38,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, a lot of times, you know,

906
02:09:40,203 --> 02:09:42,386
[SPEAKER_10]: When it comes to Medford, you can't see anything because there's no cameras.

907
02:09:42,506 --> 02:09:45,430
[SPEAKER_10]: But they have them in all surrounding areas, surrounding cities and towns.

908
02:09:45,470 --> 02:09:46,931
[SPEAKER_10]: And they've been extremely helpful.

909
02:09:46,971 --> 02:09:50,696
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that things have happened in Medford where, you know, they've

910
02:09:51,277 --> 02:09:56,680
[SPEAKER_10]: The people that have broken the law have gone down to cities and towns, and they've consulted these cameras.

911
02:09:56,720 --> 02:09:59,821
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's really helped out a lot from what I was told that night.

912
02:10:00,462 --> 02:10:06,004
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're all accessible right through the phone if they need to look at a camera right away.

913
02:10:06,104 --> 02:10:10,907
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's a good way to possibly help to solve crimes.

914
02:10:11,887 --> 02:10:15,529
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't think it's a way to go out to see if someone's speeding or something like that.

915
02:10:15,589 --> 02:10:16,450
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not the purpose.

916
02:10:16,990 --> 02:10:20,992
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be to actually just to try to, after crime has been committed, to actually

917
02:10:21,383 --> 02:10:23,664
[SPEAKER_10]: go back and look at a tape and say, OK, wait a second.

918
02:10:23,904 --> 02:10:27,746
[SPEAKER_10]: They actually came running down Mr. Gabel, whatever it may be.

919
02:10:28,166 --> 02:10:29,727
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think it's a good tool to have.

920
02:10:30,328 --> 02:10:32,389
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's a really inexpensive option.

921
02:10:32,409 --> 02:10:35,610
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, cameras are pretty inexpensive these days.

922
02:10:35,850 --> 02:10:43,094
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I don't think it's something that could be very beneficial to the police department in solving crimes.

923
02:10:44,602 --> 02:10:45,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

924
02:10:45,782 --> 02:10:46,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

925
02:10:47,202 --> 02:10:58,084
[SPEAKER_13]: I know Somerville and Chelsea use this same thing as a tool that if something does happen, a crime, they're able to, let's go to the nearest intersection and see which car, where did this go?

926
02:10:58,124 --> 02:11:00,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we get a license plate?

927
02:11:00,085 --> 02:11:02,965
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we even see in the vehicle and see how many people were in the vehicle?

928
02:11:03,505 --> 02:11:10,327
[SPEAKER_13]: We had an incident in Wellington Circle, oh gosh, last summer maybe, where a car hit a pedestrian.

929
02:11:10,347 --> 02:11:12,727
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe the pedestrian died.

930
02:11:13,263 --> 02:11:25,806
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, we had no cameras at Wellington circle, but thankfully I believe my, um, the other person that rents out of the building I'm in the painted bird tattoo had cameras, was able to catch a video of the car.

931
02:11:26,186 --> 02:11:33,508
[SPEAKER_13]: That video from the business was put on TV and you know, I don't know if the suspect was, was caught, but that's something we in Medford don't have.

932
02:11:33,828 --> 02:11:39,349
[SPEAKER_13]: You also have a lot of, he said, she said car accidents where the victims, you know, you, you don't know who the actual victim is.

933
02:11:39,629 --> 02:11:42,730
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, but those cameras can help find the true victim.

934
02:11:43,829 --> 02:11:44,730
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, very easily.

935
02:11:44,770 --> 02:11:52,317
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's a great tool that our police department could use to go back and say, Oh, let's see what happened on main and, and self last night at nine 30.

936
02:11:52,717 --> 02:11:57,422
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I think it would definitely be beneficial, especially, especially if the cost is, is right.

937
02:11:57,622 --> 02:11:59,484
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I think it's something we could use in Medford.

938
02:11:59,865 --> 02:12:03,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you on the motion by vice president mocks.

939
02:12:04,737 --> 02:12:05,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

940
02:12:06,318 --> 02:12:10,419
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want people to think I'm opposed to cameras and doing all that good stuff.

941
02:12:11,079 --> 02:12:16,881
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think there could be a potential abuse if we don't know what they're being utilized for.

942
02:12:18,061 --> 02:12:30,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Secondly, Mr. President, I think it's been maybe three years that we've asked, this council has requested the administration for a camera on Commercial Street in particular because of the dumping

943
02:12:30,660 --> 02:12:34,443
[SPEAKER_02]: that goes on there, TVs, refrigerators, over and over again.

944
02:12:35,204 --> 02:12:39,547
[SPEAKER_02]: One camera we asked for on Commercial Street, and to date, it hasn't happened.

945
02:12:40,307 --> 02:12:44,010
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm in favor of cameras on every corner, on every street.

946
02:12:44,411 --> 02:12:45,792
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not gonna happen, Mr. President.

947
02:12:46,272 --> 02:12:51,456
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't get one on Commercial Street for dumping, which is another use, maybe, for the cameras.

948
02:12:52,537 --> 02:12:57,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Catch people that are dumping stoves and refrigerators on a city street, Mr. President.

949
02:12:59,682 --> 02:13:00,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

950
02:13:01,533 --> 02:13:02,033
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

951
02:13:02,394 --> 02:13:06,016
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I certainly understand Councilor Marksley's position.

952
02:13:06,236 --> 02:13:14,602
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that this was more about a question of whether or not Big Brother was watching and they were going to use this as a tool to start finding violators for certain traffic violations.

953
02:13:14,642 --> 02:13:15,643
[SPEAKER_16]: That wasn't the intent at all.

954
02:13:15,683 --> 02:13:20,066
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a data collection tool, not a punitive measure, punitive tool.

955
02:13:21,427 --> 02:13:21,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

956
02:13:22,608 --> 02:13:28,172
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

957
02:13:28,692 --> 02:13:29,433
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

958
02:13:30,663 --> 02:13:31,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

959
02:13:33,365 --> 02:13:34,866
[SPEAKER_03]: We have more papers on the hands.

960
02:13:35,686 --> 02:13:37,127
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to get rid of those two more.

961
02:13:38,388 --> 02:13:57,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the missing left side of the stop sign at the ends of Medwood Street, where it meets Hicks Ave, be replaced in the interest of public safety, and be it further resolved that the three construction barrels used for crossing children at the Columbus School be replaced with signs

962
02:13:58,629 --> 02:13:59,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Mox.

963
02:14:00,150 --> 02:14:00,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

964
02:14:00,991 --> 02:14:04,173
[SPEAKER_02]: That stop sign, for some reason, I don't know what happened, but half of it's missing.

965
02:14:04,894 --> 02:14:06,775
[SPEAKER_02]: So it says op, whatever that means.

966
02:14:08,536 --> 02:14:20,085
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing, Mr. President, Columbus Street, there's three barrels that the crossing guard has to pull in and out every day so kids can cross across the street, Mr. President.

967
02:14:20,852 --> 02:14:39,219
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a makeshift way, in my opinion, to provide public safety for our students, and I ask that a permanent sign be erected, Mr. President, showing where kids cross, that a full-fledged crosswalk be painted and kept up with, Mr. President.

968
02:14:40,499 --> 02:14:40,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

969
02:14:41,720 --> 02:14:43,981
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Locke, seconded by

970
02:14:45,031 --> 02:14:46,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

971
02:14:47,113 --> 02:14:48,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

972
02:14:48,074 --> 02:15:01,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the Veterans Memorial sign located across the Middle Oaks Bakery on Main Street at the corner of Bowen Main be put back where it once stood.

973
02:15:01,429 --> 02:15:02,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Mox.

974
02:15:02,950 --> 02:15:03,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

975
02:15:03,991 --> 02:15:07,255
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a Memorial sign that is across Middle Oaks Bakery.

976
02:15:07,815 --> 02:15:09,216
[SPEAKER_02]: at the corner of Main and Bow.

977
02:15:09,756 --> 02:15:10,696
[SPEAKER_02]: It is no longer there.

978
02:15:10,716 --> 02:15:11,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what happened.

979
02:15:12,416 --> 02:15:18,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe when a sidewalk or a street was replaced, the sidewalk, the sign is missing.

980
02:15:19,338 --> 02:15:34,883
[SPEAKER_02]: At tonight's budget meeting, we had Ernest Lindsay, the Director of Veterans Affairs, and I posed the question to him, and he was also gonna look at it, but I'd ask that we send also a communication to the mayor by this council to have it researched, Mr. President.

981
02:15:36,887 --> 02:15:40,049
[SPEAKER_03]: The motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight.

982
02:15:40,109 --> 02:15:40,690
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

983
02:15:40,710 --> 02:15:40,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

984
02:15:41,911 --> 02:15:42,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

985
02:15:44,412 --> 02:15:46,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion for suspension by Councilor Knight.

986
02:15:46,994 --> 02:15:50,236
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lay on the table.

987
02:15:51,037 --> 02:15:58,502
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the committee reports 17-516, Committee of the Whole, May 31, 2017.

988
02:16:00,243 --> 02:16:05,766
[SPEAKER_03]: The purpose of the meeting was to view and discuss government legislative management.

989
02:16:05,827 --> 02:16:06,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

990
02:16:07,319 --> 02:16:08,840
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I defer to Councilor Falco.

991
02:16:08,860 --> 02:16:15,586
[SPEAKER_16]: This is an issue that he's been working on since his start of the term this year, and I think he should be provided the opportunity to present.

992
02:16:16,167 --> 02:16:16,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

993
02:16:16,927 --> 02:16:17,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

994
02:16:17,788 --> 02:16:18,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

995
02:16:18,929 --> 02:16:29,437
[SPEAKER_10]: The purpose of the meeting was to view and discuss government legislative management software, which includes the agenda, minutes, and video streaming the meeting.

996
02:16:30,598 --> 02:16:31,739
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a good meeting.

997
02:16:31,980 --> 02:16:33,521
[SPEAKER_10]: We actually asked a lot of questions.

998
02:16:33,541 --> 02:16:36,123
[SPEAKER_10]: We got a nice presentation from Acela,

999
02:16:37,153 --> 02:16:45,560
[SPEAKER_10]: They have experience with, we have surrounding communities that also use this type of product.

1000
02:16:45,580 --> 02:16:49,162
[SPEAKER_10]: They use it in Somerville, Melrose, I believe maybe Cambridge as well.

1001
02:16:49,683 --> 02:17:00,791
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically a product that will bring a lot of transparency to the process and the way we view agendas and minutes here at City Hall.

1002
02:17:01,212 --> 02:17:04,354
[SPEAKER_10]: The public would have all the information at their fingertips.

1003
02:17:05,089 --> 02:17:07,772
[SPEAKER_10]: with regard to researching information if they wanted to.

1004
02:17:07,792 --> 02:17:09,594
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a very powerful tool.

1005
02:17:09,614 --> 02:17:11,776
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's great with regard to transparency.

1006
02:17:12,576 --> 02:17:21,025
[SPEAKER_10]: All the reports that we get back here, they will be able to access on their phones or laptops or iPads or whatever it may be.

1007
02:17:21,625 --> 02:17:24,348
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think it's a great tool with regard to transparency.

1008
02:17:24,988 --> 02:17:27,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Video streaming is a powerful tool as well.

1009
02:17:27,731 --> 02:17:28,792
[SPEAKER_10]: It would allow us to actually

1010
02:17:30,385 --> 02:17:34,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Filmer meetings, the city council office, if we choose.

1011
02:17:34,666 --> 02:17:39,528
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's also great because we have a lot of boards and commissions in our community.

1012
02:17:39,688 --> 02:17:42,969
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think a lot of people really don't know what the boards and commissions do.

1013
02:17:43,569 --> 02:17:53,393
[SPEAKER_10]: But with the agenda minutes meeting software, it would allow all of the boards and commission minutes, agenda minutes and software, all be online.

1014
02:17:53,453 --> 02:17:57,354
[SPEAKER_10]: So really, it benefits the community in many ways with regard to transparency.

1015
02:17:57,981 --> 02:18:01,562
[SPEAKER_10]: they'd actually be able to view and see the meetings whenever they want.

1016
02:18:01,643 --> 02:18:02,683
[SPEAKER_10]: So everything would be online.

1017
02:18:02,723 --> 02:18:05,424
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a great meeting, went really well, great questions.

1018
02:18:06,545 --> 02:18:08,585
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's basically a brief synopsis.

1019
02:18:08,605 --> 02:18:09,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Council President.

1020
02:18:09,386 --> 02:18:11,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to accept the paper.

1021
02:18:12,627 --> 02:18:15,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded by Vice President Marks.

1022
02:18:17,209 --> 02:18:20,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank Councilor Falco for bringing up the subject.

1023
02:18:20,910 --> 02:18:23,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this has been a bone of contention in this community for a number of years.

1024
02:18:24,492 --> 02:18:27,053
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that there are many board and commission meetings,

1025
02:18:27,486 --> 02:18:28,607
[SPEAKER_02]: that are taking place on.

1026
02:18:29,085 --> 02:18:31,867
[SPEAKER_02]: hours that are very difficult for residents to attend.

1027
02:18:32,287 --> 02:18:51,060
[SPEAKER_02]: There are meetings happening during the day that most working people are unable to attend and to have a video stream or a place where you could click on a PDF file and get a copy of the minutes and also a recording of what took place is extremely helpful and something that I've supported for a number of years.

1028
02:18:51,801 --> 02:18:57,545
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to make this successful, we need to get a buy-in from the administration because as we heard,

1029
02:18:57,987 --> 02:19:00,434
[SPEAKER_02]: that it would be great to have the council meetings recorded.

1030
02:19:00,735 --> 02:19:02,039
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll record it on Tuesday nights.

1031
02:19:02,435 --> 02:19:05,357
[SPEAKER_02]: They replay us on Thursday and Friday on local access.

1032
02:19:05,858 --> 02:19:14,944
[SPEAKER_02]: But in order for this to be successful, Mr. President, it has to be a buy-in from the administration that all the boards and commissions fall into this also.

1033
02:19:15,345 --> 02:19:17,746
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know when the Zoning Board of Appeals has a meeting.

1034
02:19:18,047 --> 02:19:19,788
[SPEAKER_02]: We know when the assessors meet.

1035
02:19:20,068 --> 02:19:22,390
[SPEAKER_02]: We know when the Liquor Commission meets.

1036
02:19:22,750 --> 02:19:26,293
[SPEAKER_02]: We know when the park board is discussing maybe a park in your area.

1037
02:19:27,434 --> 02:19:31,797
[SPEAKER_02]: That is vital, Mr. President, to have, as Councilor Falco alluded to,

1038
02:19:32,253 --> 02:19:33,614
[SPEAKER_02]: transparency in this community.

1039
02:19:33,674 --> 02:19:40,237
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we asked that in the format of a question, and I don't know if we got a response, Mr. Clerk.

1040
02:19:40,657 --> 02:19:47,361
[SPEAKER_02]: We asked that the mayor be fully supportive of the agenda and minutes concept with all boards and commissions and school committees.

1041
02:19:49,522 --> 02:19:51,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we haven't sent this out.

1042
02:19:51,563 --> 02:19:52,904
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Mr. President,

1043
02:19:55,543 --> 02:20:01,506
[SPEAKER_02]: That's important that we receive full support from the administration in order to move this forward.

1044
02:20:01,826 --> 02:20:02,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1045
02:20:03,287 --> 02:20:05,248
[SPEAKER_02]: But Councilor Dello Russo.

1046
02:20:05,689 --> 02:20:10,451
[SPEAKER_05]: As a sign of her support, I believe the mayor allocated funds for this in the legislative budget.

1047
02:20:10,972 --> 02:20:12,312
[SPEAKER_03]: That's correct Councilor Dello Russo.

1048
02:20:13,133 --> 02:20:14,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lococo.

1049
02:20:14,253 --> 02:20:15,434
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to back that up.

1050
02:20:15,754 --> 02:20:16,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Even though it's in the budget,

1051
02:20:18,504 --> 02:20:21,947
[SPEAKER_13]: We do want every single board and commission to be televised.

1052
02:20:21,967 --> 02:20:23,168
[SPEAKER_13]: We want the minutes online.

1053
02:20:23,209 --> 02:20:25,491
[SPEAKER_13]: We want complete and full transparency.

1054
02:20:25,791 --> 02:20:29,815
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to make sure that the mayor is going to ask each and every board and commission to do this.

1055
02:20:30,876 --> 02:20:40,925
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe it's obvious that we want our committee, the whole meetings and subcommittee meetings taped as well as city council meetings here taped and video streamed.

1056
02:20:41,346 --> 02:20:43,788
[SPEAKER_13]: But we also were requesting additional, um,

1057
02:20:45,421 --> 02:20:48,882
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it should be number three on this committee report.

1058
02:20:49,203 --> 02:20:52,924
[SPEAKER_13]: We did request additional, I forget what the device was.

1059
02:20:53,664 --> 02:21:01,168
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a certain device that is a few hundred dollars that you'll need in each room you want to video.

1060
02:21:01,248 --> 02:21:10,912
[SPEAKER_13]: So we were requesting not only it be one in this room, but we have one in at least 207 and 201, and maybe even one upstairs so that we can make this possible.

1061
02:21:11,312 --> 02:21:13,733
[SPEAKER_13]: But no matter how many we purchase, we need the mayor

1062
02:21:14,475 --> 02:21:27,401
[SPEAKER_13]: the administration to request and almost mandate that every single meeting is televised and takes part in this program, because that's where you're going to see money being worth it.

1063
02:21:27,581 --> 02:21:38,366
[SPEAKER_13]: Our meetings are televised anyway, but to get every single commission and board meeting televised and open to the public and as transparent as possible is the purpose of doing this.

1064
02:21:39,818 --> 02:21:43,180
[SPEAKER_13]: not only city council meetings, but every single board and commission meeting.

1065
02:21:43,240 --> 02:21:44,721
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's extremely important.

1066
02:21:45,101 --> 02:21:45,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1067
02:21:46,402 --> 02:21:52,206
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by amended, sorry, can amend that and to request additional funding.

1068
02:21:53,587 --> 02:21:56,308
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the $20,000 included the monitors, correct?

1069
02:21:56,429 --> 02:21:57,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco.

1070
02:21:58,010 --> 02:21:59,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was $12,000 without the monitor and 20 with.

1071
02:21:59,410 --> 02:21:59,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1072
02:21:59,590 --> 02:21:59,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1073
02:22:09,431 --> 02:22:10,932
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

1074
02:22:11,072 --> 02:22:15,193
[SPEAKER_16]: Presently in the legislative section of the FY18 budget, we have funding to implement this.

1075
02:22:15,693 --> 02:22:17,734
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a question here that we're reporting out of the committee.

1076
02:22:17,754 --> 02:22:19,995
[SPEAKER_16]: Can monies be appropriated out of the cable access funds?

1077
02:22:20,875 --> 02:22:27,798
[SPEAKER_16]: If the answer is yes, then maybe we can use the money that gets appropriated out of the cable access funds to implement additional monitors.

1078
02:22:28,678 --> 02:22:31,559
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1079
02:22:31,900 --> 02:22:33,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to accept the committee.

1080
02:22:33,560 --> 02:22:33,820
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll stop.

1081
02:22:33,860 --> 02:22:36,741
[SPEAKER_10]: And the additional monitors, I believe, were pretty inexpensive.

1082
02:22:36,801 --> 02:22:37,942
[SPEAKER_10]: It was not big money.

1083
02:22:39,113 --> 02:22:39,853
[SPEAKER_10]: couple hundred bucks.

1084
02:22:40,433 --> 02:22:42,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address for the record.

1085
02:22:42,114 --> 02:22:43,014
[SPEAKER_08]: G news 0 35 Paris street.

1086
02:22:43,414 --> 02:22:44,514
[SPEAKER_08]: I attended this meeting.

1087
02:22:44,994 --> 02:22:59,037
[SPEAKER_08]: It was my recollection that it was $12,000 for the posting of agendas and minutes, 8,000 additional dollars for a total of 20 to engage the streaming module.

1088
02:22:59,437 --> 02:23:06,999
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it was room by room between eight and $12,000 for the cameras and equipment to be outfitted.

1089
02:23:07,622 --> 02:23:09,323
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a separate fee to outfit.

1090
02:23:09,443 --> 02:23:11,685
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what my notes had said from that night.

1091
02:23:12,645 --> 02:23:13,846
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like about $800.

1092
02:23:14,747 --> 02:23:14,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1093
02:23:15,507 --> 02:23:23,933
[SPEAKER_08]: For that transmitter, for the transmitter, but the additional cameras and everything, I thought they said to outfit a room was going to be 12 grand.

1094
02:23:24,113 --> 02:23:26,254
[SPEAKER_08]: So you may just want to, I know you have questions going to them.

1095
02:23:26,655 --> 02:23:29,256
[SPEAKER_08]: You may just want to clarify that because I recall differently.

1096
02:23:33,579 --> 02:23:37,582
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to cover everything except for the extra transmitters, which were actually going to be,

1097
02:23:38,291 --> 02:23:40,772
[SPEAKER_10]: a little bit more money, but it was not that much money.

1098
02:23:40,812 --> 02:23:48,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I remember saying, well, this is actually, in the grand scheme of things, it was pretty inexpensive, I think, with regard to transparency and whatnot.

1099
02:23:48,095 --> 02:23:48,195
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

1100
02:23:51,737 --> 02:23:52,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1101
02:23:52,757 --> 02:23:53,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Dello Russo.

1102
02:23:53,698 --> 02:23:56,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to accept the committee report, Mr. President.

1103
02:23:57,900 --> 02:23:59,240
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address for the record, please.

1104
02:24:00,461 --> 02:24:01,701
[SPEAKER_14]: Castagnetti, Cushing Street.

1105
02:24:02,882 --> 02:24:07,724
[SPEAKER_14]: My recollection at that meeting, I asked the vendor, more importantly,

1106
02:24:08,925 --> 02:24:11,405
[SPEAKER_14]: what would it cost in the future per year?

1107
02:24:12,446 --> 02:24:25,468
[SPEAKER_14]: And I believe one of the Councilors stated that would be in the contract, but at least he was up front enough, hopefully factual and truthful to say the increase can only be a maximum of, I believe it was 3%.

1108
02:24:25,548 --> 02:24:27,448
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1109
02:24:28,308 --> 02:24:31,849
[SPEAKER_14]: So increase.

1110
02:24:32,029 --> 02:24:35,810
[SPEAKER_14]: So hopefully 3% would be like $600 on top of 20,000 in the following year.

1111
02:24:38,089 --> 02:24:39,029
[SPEAKER_14]: if they max it out.

1112
02:24:39,769 --> 02:24:43,830
[SPEAKER_14]: So hopefully it won't be a surprise bill of $100,000 for the following year.

1113
02:24:43,850 --> 02:24:55,892
[SPEAKER_14]: 3% is supposed to be the max, and I would, if you people get into the contract, I would, and sign it, I would hope they will stick to that 3% in the contract.

1114
02:24:56,812 --> 02:24:58,252
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's no surprises in the future.

1115
02:24:58,272 --> 02:24:58,652
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1116
02:24:58,993 --> 02:24:59,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1117
02:24:59,913 --> 02:25:04,914
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo to accept the paper.

1118
02:25:04,994 --> 02:25:05,634
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

1119
02:25:06,434 --> 02:25:07,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

1120
02:25:08,536 --> 02:25:09,436
[SPEAKER_03]: 17, five through nine.

1121
02:25:09,456 --> 02:25:18,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Committee meeting report, purpose of the meeting was to review and discuss the contents of the paper of 16.04.

1122
02:25:20,064 --> 02:25:21,806
[SPEAKER_03]: And the following recommendations were made.

1123
02:25:23,027 --> 02:25:25,809
[SPEAKER_03]: One, that the city solicitor provide an opinion on the following.

1124
02:25:26,469 --> 02:25:35,356
[SPEAKER_03]: A, does the city have the ability to issue more return on the issuance of permits authorizing public utility companies to excavate city streets and sidewalks?

1125
02:25:35,456 --> 02:25:37,298
[SPEAKER_03]: B, does the city have the ability

1126
02:25:37,810 --> 02:25:43,233
[SPEAKER_03]: to limit the number of permits issued to a public utility companies during an annual construction season.

1127
02:25:43,313 --> 02:25:51,577
[SPEAKER_03]: C, that the city review existing laws and ordinances and recommend to the city council any changes to strengthen the city's position.

1128
02:25:51,597 --> 02:25:57,961
[SPEAKER_03]: D, can the city request upfront funding for paving services from public utility companies.

1129
02:25:58,841 --> 02:26:05,545
[SPEAKER_03]: D, E, that the city implement a final inspection criteria and establish a stronger

1130
02:26:06,246 --> 02:26:07,867
[SPEAKER_03]: construction standards.

1131
02:26:08,328 --> 02:26:09,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

1132
02:26:11,490 --> 02:26:12,851
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1133
02:26:13,092 --> 02:26:27,883
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been a common and recurring theme behind this rail for the past term that our public utilities that are performing construction work in the city of Method aren't doing so in a fashion that would be beneficial to the residents of Medford and their quality of life during the construction.

1134
02:26:28,924 --> 02:26:34,629
[SPEAKER_16]: That the final product that they're leaving us with is shoddy at best and not up to city of Method standards, Mr. President.

1135
02:26:35,833 --> 02:26:38,015
[SPEAKER_16]: Paper 16-404 was filed in April of 2016.

1136
02:26:38,095 --> 02:26:45,399
[SPEAKER_16]: The engineering division did not submit a response to the council, so a committee of the whole was held.

1137
02:26:45,859 --> 02:26:48,040
[SPEAKER_16]: At this committee of the whole, we had a very informant.

1138
02:26:48,060 --> 02:26:50,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Dello Russo, all those in favor?

1139
02:26:51,002 --> 02:26:51,182
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1140
02:26:52,583 --> 02:26:53,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

1141
02:26:55,384 --> 02:27:00,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to revert back to regular business, petitions, presentation, and similar matters.

1142
02:27:01,007 --> 02:27:01,027
[SPEAKER_03]: 17-526.

1143
02:27:04,616 --> 02:27:18,603
[SPEAKER_03]: petitioned by Robert M. Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., who discussed the mayor's new water connectivity tax to be effective July 2017 in the mayor's proposed hotel next to City Hall.

1144
02:27:19,104 --> 02:27:20,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address for the record, please.

1145
02:27:21,125 --> 02:27:25,907
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Robert M. Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this August party.

1146
02:27:26,808 --> 02:27:30,250
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I'm up here is twofold, as the resolution indicates.

1147
02:27:31,348 --> 02:27:45,693
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little befuddled when I got a copy of my water bill, and then I got a copy of the letter signed by the Board of Water and Soil Commissioners as it relates to what they call a baseline fee, which is, in essence, is a new tax on the rate payers here within this community.

1148
02:27:46,493 --> 02:27:49,294
[SPEAKER_00]: In their letter where they make an assessment of $24,000 is $24,483 is necessary.

1149
02:27:49,314 --> 02:27:52,215
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if this is a misprint on the spelling here.

1150
02:28:00,103 --> 02:28:00,844
[SPEAKER_00]: Pardon me?

1151
02:28:00,864 --> 02:28:01,204
[SPEAKER_03]: 24 million.

1152
02:28:01,705 --> 02:28:02,465
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 24 million.

1153
02:28:02,646 --> 02:28:05,168
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's the amount, I believe, of the total amount.

1154
02:28:05,468 --> 02:28:13,136
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe, if I understood it correctly from the chairman of the board, he alleged that it was approximately a $300,000 deficit on the sewer account.

1155
02:28:13,516 --> 02:28:21,725
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this August, Marty, some weeks ago, voted to incorporate your enterprise fund, which includes the water and sewer account, as one.

1156
02:28:22,325 --> 02:28:31,774
[SPEAKER_00]: And by having the water and sewer count as one, that allows you, by right and by law, to make adjustments as it relates to profits and losses on either side.

1157
02:28:32,335 --> 02:28:41,023
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the present time, the new water bills that are going to be going out are going to be having an alleged 3% reduction in your water rate.

1158
02:28:41,764 --> 02:28:45,785
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're going to be charged what they call now a new connectivity fee.

1159
02:28:46,325 --> 02:29:00,768
[SPEAKER_00]: And this connectivity fee is addressing the fact that if you have whatever your line is that you have in your house, as it relates to your water and sewer hookup, from your house to the street, for which every taxpayer who owns the line.

1160
02:29:02,808 --> 02:29:05,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Councilor Dello Russo.

1161
02:29:06,489 --> 02:29:08,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I was under the impression that

1162
02:29:09,472 --> 02:29:16,177
[SPEAKER_05]: It was not the mayor nor the council that set water rates and fees, but it was that of the Water and Sewer Commission.

1163
02:29:17,538 --> 02:29:19,920
[SPEAKER_03]: That is my understanding, Councilor Dello Russo.

1164
02:29:20,529 --> 02:29:21,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Continue, please.

1165
02:29:21,890 --> 02:29:33,402
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact of the matter is that the Water and Sewer Commission signed it, and the mayor of this community has allowed it, and likewise, this Medford City Council has done nothing to rebut it, for which you have a unique opportunity right now.

1166
02:29:33,763 --> 02:29:40,409
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact also presents itself with the issue that with this new combined water and sewer allowance,

1167
02:29:41,519 --> 02:30:03,525
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you be reducing your water rate by 3% and now coming in and want to put a brand new tax on each and every other month, bimonthly, six times a year, ad infinitum, on Medford taxpayers, knowing that you have a surplus in excess of $8 million and you have a deficit in the sewer account

1168
02:30:03,965 --> 02:30:06,206
[SPEAKER_00]: for this 2018 year of $300,000.

1169
02:30:06,266 --> 02:30:09,767
[SPEAKER_00]: That does not make any sense.

1170
02:30:10,307 --> 02:30:21,370
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why it makes no sense is you will continuously keep going with a profit that you have, and your water and sewer count, and you have nothing presented before you as of the meeting that we had a month ago and as of tonight.

1171
02:30:21,690 --> 02:30:26,232
[SPEAKER_00]: Any major road construction, any major sidewalk construction, any street construction.

1172
02:30:28,112 --> 02:30:30,453
[SPEAKER_16]: We had a meeting on this a month ago, same similar subject matter.

1173
02:30:30,473 --> 02:30:32,634
[SPEAKER_16]: We had a committee of the whole on this as well, correct?

1174
02:30:33,502 --> 02:30:38,603
[SPEAKER_16]: OK, I thought there was something in the rules about bringing something up that was already discussed within the last 90 days, Mr. President.

1175
02:30:38,663 --> 02:30:39,963
[SPEAKER_16]: It was similar, same subject matter.

1176
02:30:40,883 --> 02:30:46,064
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, the connectivity tax that's going to be charged to the ratepayers.

1177
02:30:46,084 --> 02:30:48,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1178
02:30:48,885 --> 02:30:51,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Councilor Dello Russo.

1179
02:30:51,245 --> 02:31:00,607
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no recollection of the council proposing or issuing a tax on the people of Medford on this matter.

1180
02:31:03,003 --> 02:31:11,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that we've discussed in the past 30 days a fee that has been initiated by the Water and Sewer Commission.

1181
02:31:12,086 --> 02:31:12,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1182
02:31:12,846 --> 02:31:15,147
[SPEAKER_00]: The Water and Sewer Commission comes under the auspices of the Mayor.

1183
02:31:15,167 --> 02:31:24,149
[SPEAKER_00]: They are appointed by the Mayor, and their recommendations go to the Mayor, and their recommendations, I'm quite sure, could not be holding to the taxpayers of this community at an outrageous rate.

1184
02:31:24,509 --> 02:31:28,491
[SPEAKER_00]: So a new tax and fee is being implemented on the taxpayers of this community.

1185
02:31:28,531 --> 02:31:29,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1186
02:31:30,730 --> 02:31:41,215
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I do believe that the Water and Sewer Commission is an autonomous body that's appointed by the administration to implement and effectuate public policy related to the water and sewer, but in no way do they make recommendations to the mayor.

1187
02:31:41,235 --> 02:31:42,216
[SPEAKER_16]: They actually implement policy.

1188
02:31:43,076 --> 02:31:43,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1189
02:31:43,396 --> 02:31:43,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President.

1190
02:31:44,937 --> 02:31:46,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Vice President Marks.

1191
02:31:46,998 --> 02:31:50,100
[SPEAKER_02]: With all due respect, the gentleman's up there giving his opinion.

1192
02:31:51,160 --> 02:31:52,701
[SPEAKER_02]: That's under public participation.

1193
02:31:53,496 --> 02:31:55,217
[SPEAKER_02]: He requested through the proper channels.

1194
02:31:55,917 --> 02:32:00,600
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're going to go point-counterpoint on everything he says, Mr. President, I believe that's very unfair.

1195
02:32:01,681 --> 02:32:05,003
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would ask that the gentleman be given his time allotted to him, Mr. President.

1196
02:32:05,283 --> 02:32:06,724
[SPEAKER_02]: He followed the process to speak.

1197
02:32:07,204 --> 02:32:08,865
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't agree with it, you don't agree with it.

1198
02:32:08,885 --> 02:32:13,228
[SPEAKER_02]: But to do point-counterpoint is not beneficial, Mr. President, at this point.

1199
02:32:14,068 --> 02:32:15,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Vice Presidents.

1200
02:32:17,030 --> 02:32:18,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President, sorry, Councilor Knight.

1201
02:32:19,051 --> 02:32:23,194
[SPEAKER_16]: I just feel as though sometimes accurate representation of the facts is important when we're here in the public forum.

1202
02:32:23,715 --> 02:32:24,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Inouye.

1203
02:32:25,295 --> 02:32:26,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Longo-Kurin.

1204
02:32:26,936 --> 02:32:27,376
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree.

1205
02:32:27,456 --> 02:32:32,536
[SPEAKER_13]: If you don't agree with the person at the podium, but maybe save our comments till after.

1206
02:32:32,576 --> 02:32:34,397
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel like it's almost verging on harassment.

1207
02:32:35,497 --> 02:32:36,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Longo-Kurin.

1208
02:32:37,097 --> 02:32:37,697
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.

1209
02:32:37,737 --> 02:32:38,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Please continue.

1210
02:32:39,838 --> 02:32:53,140
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you apologized on behalf of the council, because most recently, everybody got in their water and sewer bills

1211
02:32:54,068 --> 02:33:01,538
[SPEAKER_00]: a letter that indicated that they were going to be getting a new processing baseline rate, which I will call a tax.

1212
02:33:02,058 --> 02:33:07,105
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a new tax implemented on the citizens of this community on their water and sewer bill.

1213
02:33:07,445 --> 02:33:09,268
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a connectivity fee.

1214
02:33:10,017 --> 02:33:14,819
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to be paying for that each and every other month, six times a year.

1215
02:33:15,439 --> 02:33:19,981
[SPEAKER_00]: Every taxpayer that owns their home owns from their house to the middle of the street.

1216
02:33:20,381 --> 02:33:21,482
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their pipe.

1217
02:33:21,822 --> 02:33:24,523
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they're responsible for, and that's what they pay for.

1218
02:33:25,043 --> 02:33:28,585
[SPEAKER_00]: They make that connection already into the city's water and sewer line.

1219
02:33:28,925 --> 02:33:34,807
[SPEAKER_00]: The city is already charging you for water and sewer coming into your house through your pipe, through the connection.

1220
02:33:35,548 --> 02:33:38,669
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the argument that's being used by the Water and Sewer Commission is

1221
02:33:39,329 --> 02:33:55,113
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to put this money aside, which is approximately $1 million a year, according to the type and size of your pipe coming into your house, connected to the street, to offset any future costs that might put the city in a negative position.

1222
02:33:56,053 --> 02:34:01,454
[SPEAKER_00]: My argument before this honorable body, I hope most of you can accept that word,

1223
02:34:02,984 --> 02:34:11,474
[SPEAKER_00]: Honorable, is the fact that the water and sewer account that we have right now is an $8.5 million surplus.

1224
02:34:12,155 --> 02:34:17,782
[SPEAKER_00]: You've merged, within the past two months, the water and sewer accounts of the Enterprise as to be one.

1225
02:34:18,823 --> 02:34:35,611
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are alleging, as the Water and Sewer Commission is alleging, there was a $300,000 deficit in the sewer account, but at the same time you're proposing a 3% reduction in the water rate for next year, the irony to that does not make any sense.

1226
02:34:35,631 --> 02:34:35,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?

1227
02:34:36,352 --> 02:34:38,193
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you have an $8 million surplus.

1228
02:34:38,633 --> 02:34:40,454
[SPEAKER_00]: You have them both now merged together.

1229
02:34:40,674 --> 02:34:46,317
[SPEAKER_00]: And the law allows you to take a surplus from one to offset the negative of another or vice versa.

1230
02:34:47,077 --> 02:34:53,641
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that this Water and Soil Commission has failed to do, it's under a 360 CMR 1100.

1231
02:34:54,762 --> 02:34:57,644
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a continuation of contract water supplies.

1232
02:34:58,465 --> 02:34:59,185
[SPEAKER_00]: And this came out in 1994.

1233
02:34:59,285 --> 02:35:01,587
[SPEAKER_00]: And it states the following.

1234
02:35:01,947 --> 02:35:16,477
[SPEAKER_00]: You incorporate a uniform rate or an alternative structure which provides incentives for water conservation and or is designed to ensure the affordability of water service to low and or fixed income people.

1235
02:35:17,117 --> 02:35:18,979
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have that at the present time.

1236
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:24,243
[SPEAKER_00]: That's never been brought up before the Water and Soil Commission to give that particular rate out.

1237
02:35:24,704 --> 02:35:25,384
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have it.

1238
02:35:26,485 --> 02:35:35,293
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're even going to get into the idea of the thought process of wanting to get into this, how do you justify the rates that are being proposed by the city?

1239
02:35:35,914 --> 02:35:38,997
[SPEAKER_00]: The rates being proposed by the city range anywhere from

1240
02:35:41,055 --> 02:35:46,902
[SPEAKER_00]: A residential house up to 3 quarters of an inch would be $51.66 a year.

1241
02:35:47,142 --> 02:35:48,163
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you may say it's only $51.

1242
02:35:49,125 --> 02:35:50,847
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know something?

1243
02:35:51,387 --> 02:35:54,971
[SPEAKER_00]: $51 to some people is a lot of money, especially if you want a fixed income.

1244
02:35:55,272 --> 02:35:58,576
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a one-inch line coming into your house, it's $141 a year.

1245
02:36:00,658 --> 02:36:05,560
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that and add it on to the CPA tax, for which you're not even going to get reimbursed by the state on.

1246
02:36:06,241 --> 02:36:08,061
[SPEAKER_00]: That is another $50, $60 a year.

1247
02:36:08,281 --> 02:36:11,123
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're almost up to over $150, $200 a year.

1248
02:36:12,023 --> 02:36:14,404
[SPEAKER_00]: Your taxes each and every year continuously keep going up.

1249
02:36:15,064 --> 02:36:24,809
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely unfair for the city to even entertain or engage itself in a connectivity fee tax every other month when you're sitting on that kind of a profit.

1250
02:36:25,749 --> 02:36:36,852
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you want to be realistic and look at this thing and say, OK, maybe we should do like some other cities and towns, the community of Melrose, your sister next door, they have a one-time fee.

1251
02:36:37,352 --> 02:36:40,193
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's at the discretion of the director of public works.

1252
02:36:40,553 --> 02:36:42,233
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a one-time fee of $50.

1253
02:36:43,073 --> 02:36:46,414
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're building a new house and it's a first-time connection, so be it.

1254
02:36:46,734 --> 02:36:53,816
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're rebuilding your house and you have to make a reconnection, that reconnection is either $50 and or at the discretion

1255
02:36:54,753 --> 02:36:58,603
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Director of Public Works, because if you're the same owner, it could be abated.

1256
02:36:58,623 --> 02:37:02,151
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't make any sense.

1257
02:37:03,246 --> 02:37:11,789
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make any sense because you, as the Medford City Council, are supposed to be looking out for the best financial interests of this community.

1258
02:37:12,070 --> 02:37:30,137
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way you can seem to do it right now, at least through the majority of you, if you so choose, is you just hold this budget in abeyance until the mayor comes forward and indicates how can you keep going out and making these charges against Medford taxpayers and ratepayers.

1259
02:37:30,757 --> 02:37:33,519
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's flip over to the second part, to the hotel.

1260
02:37:34,340 --> 02:37:47,231
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a hotel proposal that you haven't even sat down, hasn't even been discussed, and there the mayor of this community in the State of the City address in February says this is going to be up and running by the fall of 2019.

1261
02:37:49,977 --> 02:37:55,399
[SPEAKER_00]: You haven't had a discussion either with the contractor who's only been around since 2013.

1262
02:37:56,160 --> 02:37:58,781
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even know what the taxes is going to be.

1263
02:37:59,221 --> 02:38:07,024
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best part about this hotel, you need city and state land to be taken to accommodate the parking that's necessary for this proposed hotel.

1264
02:38:07,624 --> 02:38:09,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's your time to discuss it during the budget.

1265
02:38:10,886 --> 02:38:13,427
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't discuss it, why give the vote out?

1266
02:38:14,487 --> 02:38:15,668
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make any sense.

1267
02:38:16,741 --> 02:38:27,623
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unfortunate under this form of government that this mayor who said she was going to be transparent and would have someone here each and every week to listen and to discuss these issues, there's nobody here.

1268
02:38:27,723 --> 02:38:31,424
[SPEAKER_00]: You're lucky if that person's been here twice in the two years that it's been here.

1269
02:38:32,144 --> 02:38:42,526
[SPEAKER_00]: And what doesn't make sense is how can you go back and keep telling Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer that this is only a small little dollar amount, especially when you're dealing with a surplus.

1270
02:38:43,086 --> 02:38:45,907
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got $9 million in your free cash or thereabouts.

1271
02:38:46,892 --> 02:38:52,838
[SPEAKER_00]: But nobody around here has discussed your $29 million in an unfunded liability.

1272
02:38:53,258 --> 02:38:54,339
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to address that?

1273
02:38:54,900 --> 02:39:04,289
[SPEAKER_00]: And is this new connectivity charge going to be able to be used to offset salaries and wages of employees in that department, pension system funds?

1274
02:39:04,970 --> 02:39:06,631
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the questions you need to ask.

1275
02:39:07,232 --> 02:39:11,156
[SPEAKER_00]: And the low and moderate income, fixed income people don't even have a break on this.

1276
02:39:12,242 --> 02:39:28,530
[SPEAKER_00]: So while you think you're making the taxpayer feel good because you're lowering his water rate by 3%, you're charging him in excess of the 3% by having a bimonthly, six times a year, new tax being placed upon him.

1277
02:39:29,271 --> 02:39:32,593
[SPEAKER_00]: And the line that should really get you in every single ratepayer is this.

1278
02:39:33,513 --> 02:39:40,619
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the base rate is not a tax, nor is it an additional charge in which residents pay for water and sewer services.

1279
02:39:41,059 --> 02:39:42,300
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you tell me what it is.

1280
02:39:43,101 --> 02:39:44,642
[SPEAKER_00]: You tell me, Mr. President, what it is.

1281
02:39:45,223 --> 02:39:59,515
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not a tax, okay, if it's not a fee, and if it's not for water and sewer services, well, why am I paying a connectivity fee to let that water go through that pipe that comes into the pipe that I own, that comes into my house, that you charge me water and sewer taxes on?

1282
02:40:01,263 --> 02:40:09,050
[SPEAKER_00]: I respectfully ask this Medford City Council to ask this mayor, you hold up this question and remove this connectivity fee.

1283
02:40:09,290 --> 02:40:14,975
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an unfair tax, it's unnecessary, and it does not do good for the city of Method.

1284
02:40:16,156 --> 02:40:17,717
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more than happy to answer any questions.

1285
02:40:18,238 --> 02:40:18,558
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1286
02:40:22,101 --> 02:40:22,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1287
02:40:23,562 --> 02:40:24,283
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll ask you a question.

1288
02:40:25,203 --> 02:40:26,905
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

1289
02:40:27,686 --> 02:40:30,570
[SPEAKER_13]: You had said the council should rebut the tax.

1290
02:40:30,631 --> 02:40:39,483
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, I guess we went public, I think it was under Council Max's resolution, with regards to some of us not being happy about this fee.

1291
02:40:41,479 --> 02:40:42,260
[SPEAKER_13]: How can we rebut it?

1292
02:40:42,320 --> 02:40:45,302
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it was voted on by the Water and Sewer.

1293
02:40:45,443 --> 02:40:53,710
[SPEAKER_00]: How you would rebut it is you would tell the mayor that we're not voting for your budget until you tell the Water and Sewer commissioners to roll back that fee.

1294
02:40:54,290 --> 02:41:06,441
[SPEAKER_00]: You justify $8.5 million sitting there and justify telling the taxpayers you're going to generate another million dollars plus a year with this connectivity fee, and you don't even have a program set aside.

1295
02:41:07,262 --> 02:41:08,103
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at every street.

1296
02:41:08,383 --> 02:41:10,365
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at all the streets that are waiting to be done.

1297
02:41:10,585 --> 02:41:12,307
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the potholes that can't get done.

1298
02:41:12,527 --> 02:41:17,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at Evans Street that's been promised for almost two years they were going to get done when the water main broke.

1299
02:41:18,032 --> 02:41:19,894
[SPEAKER_00]: We could just go on and on and on with this.

1300
02:41:20,434 --> 02:41:28,822
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't keep charging the taxpayers of this community for something, especially when you're sitting on millions of dollars in a surplus in this particular account.

1301
02:41:30,362 --> 02:41:31,903
[SPEAKER_13]: I voiced my concern at the meeting.

1302
02:41:32,323 --> 02:41:46,827
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm very concerned about how this plays out in the years to come, but the way it was explained to us this year is that the rate was being reduced, this fee was being implemented, and we were raising enough just to cover what we owe MWRA.

1303
02:41:46,887 --> 02:41:51,669
[SPEAKER_13]: There was going to be no excess revenue taken in from

1304
02:41:52,233 --> 02:41:54,355
[SPEAKER_13]: the rates and the fee?

1305
02:41:54,735 --> 02:41:59,620
[SPEAKER_00]: We're reducing the water rate, Madam Chairperson, we're reducing the water rate by 3%.

1306
02:42:00,520 --> 02:42:13,272
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a $24 million cost, whatever it is, I think that's what you said, Mr. President, for the cost of coming in this year, and inclusive of that cost is water and sewer charges, because it's coming in, and we all know that your sewer charge is at 121% of your water.

1307
02:42:14,975 --> 02:42:32,401
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the city already knows that they're going to be operating at a $300,000 loss, why wouldn't you just take the money from your $8.5 million profit rather than go out and tell the people we're going to charge you for a connectivity fee and have the audacity to put in a letter that's got nothing to do with water and sewer services?

1308
02:42:33,321 --> 02:42:34,522
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think, people are stupid?

1309
02:42:35,785 --> 02:42:36,585
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not stupid.

1310
02:42:37,245 --> 02:42:40,266
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I love this city, and I'll do anything to make it right.

1311
02:42:40,627 --> 02:42:43,968
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I see stuff like this, this really gets to me, all right?

1312
02:42:44,248 --> 02:42:46,508
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should get to every one of you members of the City Council.

1313
02:42:47,209 --> 02:42:54,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not right, it's not fair, and you can't even take care of people on fixed incomes, you know, allowing you to do this.

1314
02:42:54,631 --> 02:42:55,851
[SPEAKER_00]: You haven't even discussed that.

1315
02:42:55,891 --> 02:42:57,512
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the Water and Soil Commissioner on that?

1316
02:43:01,035 --> 02:43:02,995
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't mean TL, Mr. President, but you know something?

1317
02:43:03,516 --> 02:43:10,037
[SPEAKER_00]: When you sit here all night and you watch what's going on here and you're being played to wait till the end of the night, I get upset.

1318
02:43:10,337 --> 02:43:10,657
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1319
02:43:11,298 --> 02:43:12,438
[SPEAKER_00]: But every dog has its day.

1320
02:43:12,478 --> 02:43:12,938
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that.

1321
02:43:13,658 --> 02:43:16,239
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an election coming up and I hope people remember that.

1322
02:43:16,579 --> 02:43:16,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1323
02:43:16,939 --> 02:43:21,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

1324
02:43:21,360 --> 02:43:22,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address of the record, please.

1325
02:43:22,500 --> 02:43:24,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Lisa DeFabritas, Winford Way.

1326
02:43:24,521 --> 02:43:24,821
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1327
02:43:25,143 --> 02:43:27,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Lisa DeFabritis and Winford Way.

1328
02:43:27,506 --> 02:43:32,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I'd like to echo the gentleman's comments.

1329
02:43:32,371 --> 02:43:36,635
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually attended last week's meeting with the Water and Sewer Commission here.

1330
02:43:37,406 --> 02:43:41,248
[SPEAKER_07]: I was one of the, I think one of the only citizens at the meeting.

1331
02:43:41,268 --> 02:43:49,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I got the same letter and I called the city to inquire, to get more explanation because it was very unclear what that was all about.

1332
02:43:50,212 --> 02:43:53,834
[SPEAKER_07]: And they told me there was, um, a meeting that evening, which I did attend.

1333
02:43:53,974 --> 02:44:04,439
[SPEAKER_07]: I went on your website there, your meetings for this evening, the council meetings, everything is posted, but you're at the water and sewer commission meetings and I'm not posted.

1334
02:44:04,939 --> 02:44:13,331
[SPEAKER_07]: From my understanding from the city is that the Water and Sewer Commission is their own independent body.

1335
02:44:13,891 --> 02:44:17,576
[SPEAKER_07]: They pretty much, no one answers, they don't really answer to anybody.

1336
02:44:18,858 --> 02:44:19,819
[SPEAKER_07]: They are not elected.

1337
02:44:20,876 --> 02:44:23,238
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no transparency.

1338
02:44:23,538 --> 02:44:31,063
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no communication to the public to be able to go to these meetings and voice your opinion and ask questions.

1339
02:44:31,724 --> 02:44:38,168
[SPEAKER_07]: I happen to have had gone to this meeting, inquired about this specific agenda item.

1340
02:44:38,849 --> 02:44:47,835
[SPEAKER_07]: And the information that I was told by the chair of the Water School, and there's actually the gentleman from the state, the Department of Water and Sewer from Massachusetts,

1341
02:44:48,519 --> 02:44:53,101
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not, I was told at the meeting, it was not a connectivity fee.

1342
02:44:53,221 --> 02:44:59,423
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fee to read the meter and to send out the bill.

1343
02:45:00,343 --> 02:45:04,105
[SPEAKER_07]: This is exactly how Dominic explained it.

1344
02:45:06,185 --> 02:45:12,448
[SPEAKER_07]: So $8.61 per meter, and it's so that the bill can be generated, the meter's read.

1345
02:45:13,328 --> 02:45:15,909
[SPEAKER_07]: And as the gentleman prior to myself,

1346
02:45:16,397 --> 02:45:21,763
[SPEAKER_07]: noted that they will also be lowering the rates of the water.

1347
02:45:22,484 --> 02:45:29,332
[SPEAKER_07]: I expressed my concerns for various reasons, and I have a document that I provide to all the members of the commission.

1348
02:45:29,773 --> 02:45:32,276
[SPEAKER_07]: One, the meter is per meter.

1349
02:45:34,398 --> 02:45:51,387
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you have, it's not, first of all, it was not fairly, in my opinion, not fairly implemented in the sense that there are homes that have a meter for their home for your water and sewer in your house, and then you have a meter for your landscaping.

1350
02:45:52,428 --> 02:45:55,890
[SPEAKER_07]: If this fee was going to be implemented, it should be two times.

1351
02:45:56,050 --> 02:45:57,751
[SPEAKER_07]: They say no, because it's just one.

1352
02:45:58,331 --> 02:46:00,933
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you have a three-family home,

1353
02:46:01,940 --> 02:46:03,721
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one meter coming into a home.

1354
02:46:04,041 --> 02:46:06,443
[SPEAKER_07]: You're only charged that $8.61 for the meter.

1355
02:46:06,463 --> 02:46:07,343
[SPEAKER_07]: We're a single-family home.

1356
02:46:10,518 --> 02:46:11,979
[SPEAKER_07]: is charged the same amount.

1357
02:46:13,040 --> 02:46:15,242
[SPEAKER_07]: I question why they're raising the money.

1358
02:46:15,282 --> 02:46:22,047
[SPEAKER_07]: They said it's to ensure a minimum, I believe it's $1 to $2 million a year of guaranteed revenue.

1359
02:46:22,787 --> 02:46:30,553
[SPEAKER_07]: And that revenue was supposedly to help pay for infrastructure in the city, for their sewers that needs to be repaired in the years.

1360
02:46:31,134 --> 02:46:35,937
[SPEAKER_07]: And I get all that, the reason for raising, that you need to generate revenue.

1361
02:46:36,838 --> 02:46:51,167
[SPEAKER_07]: But to charge to lower rates, and then at the cost of adding more, the cost to other people unfairly, it just wasn't clear.

1362
02:46:51,807 --> 02:46:56,450
[SPEAKER_07]: And I questioned the decision, how they came up with this plan.

1363
02:46:56,951 --> 02:46:59,652
[SPEAKER_07]: And the bottom line was, the answer I got was unclear.

1364
02:46:59,692 --> 02:47:01,553
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically, this is what we thought, and that's it.

1365
02:47:01,653 --> 02:47:04,996
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was absolutely no discussion, input from anybody.

1366
02:47:06,050 --> 02:47:09,533
[SPEAKER_07]: in absolute denial to reconsider the plan.

1367
02:47:09,754 --> 02:47:22,446
[SPEAKER_07]: And I requested that it be reviewed and that people have the opportunity to propose a more fairer way if they need to generate revenue.

1368
02:47:22,466 --> 02:47:27,851
[SPEAKER_07]: But if the purpose is to generate revenue, why are you lowering the water rates?

1369
02:47:31,225 --> 02:47:35,428
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you justify—so you're lowering—someone's going to benefit, and someone's going to pay.

1370
02:47:35,468 --> 02:47:37,229
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just shifting the cost.

1371
02:47:37,309 --> 02:47:38,690
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all this was all about.

1372
02:47:38,730 --> 02:47:50,599
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't want to get into it here right now, but in a different forum, if you had to sit there and ask the Board of Supervisors to provide an explanation, all it's going to do is shift funds.

1373
02:47:50,919 --> 02:47:55,662
[SPEAKER_07]: The revenue you're getting from certain people will benefit, and others will pay.

1374
02:47:56,829 --> 02:48:01,210
[SPEAKER_07]: will be paying more for the, you know, it's you're offsetting costs unfairly.

1375
02:48:01,951 --> 02:48:05,352
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know what the, why that is and where they came up with it.

1376
02:48:05,492 --> 02:48:13,454
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, and I feel that is the city council should be questioning this in the purpose of the water and sewer commission in the city.

1377
02:48:14,934 --> 02:48:16,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Their, their meeting should be transparent.

1378
02:48:17,162 --> 02:48:18,303
[SPEAKER_07]: They should be held accountable.

1379
02:48:18,423 --> 02:48:19,745
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be open to the public.

1380
02:48:20,285 --> 02:48:25,871
[SPEAKER_07]: They should not be able to make decisions on their own without being responding to, I think, at least this committee here.

1381
02:48:26,151 --> 02:48:28,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Their meetings are publicized and open to the public.

1382
02:48:28,934 --> 02:48:30,996
[SPEAKER_07]: It was not on the website.

1383
02:48:31,096 --> 02:48:31,857
[SPEAKER_07]: It was not.

1384
02:48:32,298 --> 02:48:33,899
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I said, I was the only one there.

1385
02:48:34,900 --> 02:48:39,125
[SPEAKER_03]: But they usually are posted and they are open to the public.

1386
02:48:39,932 --> 02:48:42,414
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it was open to the public, but it was not posted.

1387
02:48:42,494 --> 02:48:44,135
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it was posted, but it should be posted.

1388
02:48:44,195 --> 02:48:46,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it did call and it was not posted.

1389
02:48:46,537 --> 02:48:49,779
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, anyway, so that was, that's just my comment.

1390
02:48:49,839 --> 02:48:54,283
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, I, again, I don't know how that commission is elected or who appoints them.

1391
02:48:54,303 --> 02:48:55,303
[SPEAKER_03]: They're appointed by the mayor.

1392
02:48:55,684 --> 02:48:56,304
[SPEAKER_07]: By the mayor.

1393
02:48:56,344 --> 02:48:56,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1394
02:48:58,506 --> 02:48:58,806
[SPEAKER_07]: So,

1395
02:49:00,632 --> 02:49:04,034
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there should be, you know, in any public office, sometimes you need it.

1396
02:49:04,054 --> 02:49:12,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, there should be a tenor, uh, you know, a limited years that people stay in a position or at least shifted around and move the people up.

1397
02:49:12,299 --> 02:49:23,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, because I think sometimes what happens with people in positions for too many years, uh, they think they can, you know, make decisions on their own without feeling consultant, uh, public opinion and getting the input of others.

1398
02:49:23,705 --> 02:49:24,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1399
02:49:24,205 --> 02:49:24,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1400
02:49:27,607 --> 02:49:28,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address of the record, please.

1401
02:49:29,448 --> 02:49:30,409
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1402
02:49:30,993 --> 02:49:31,353
[SPEAKER_15]: Excuse me.

1403
02:49:31,413 --> 02:49:33,575
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm Rob Caputi of 71 Evans street.

1404
02:49:33,795 --> 02:49:38,740
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank Mr. Penta for bringing, bringing this up.

1405
02:49:40,221 --> 02:49:45,605
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to say, I mean, I, this is a very important issue to me.

1406
02:49:46,426 --> 02:49:48,828
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, what, what's actually going to happen.

1407
02:49:50,026 --> 02:49:55,409
[SPEAKER_15]: with this tax and all the other taxes is the businesses and residents, they're not going to pay it.

1408
02:49:55,429 --> 02:50:01,051
[SPEAKER_15]: They're going to pass these costs along to people that rent, to people that buy goods and services.

1409
02:50:01,732 --> 02:50:08,475
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I've been sitting in these subcommittee meetings that this honorable body has been having on the budget and, you know,

1410
02:50:10,186 --> 02:50:20,814
[SPEAKER_15]: To see an issue like this come, and then to hear different department heads, like the chief of police talking about he asked for five new police officers, and that was denied.

1411
02:50:21,194 --> 02:50:31,783
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's explained off that they're going to be hiring civil dispatchers, and that will bring in more police.

1412
02:50:31,903 --> 02:50:35,565
[SPEAKER_15]: But in actuality, that's not really going to bring in more police.

1413
02:50:35,846 --> 02:50:38,448
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's just very confusing.

1414
02:50:38,988 --> 02:50:48,231
[SPEAKER_15]: and frustrating to the citizens who are seeing things like My Street, Evans Street, and all the infrastructure repairs that are needed across the city.

1415
02:50:48,791 --> 02:51:04,997
[SPEAKER_15]: To see other ways of bringing money into the city, rather than direct tax or new connectivity fees, to look at the budget that's being proposed here, to see only $97,000, I think the figure is, for the Chevalier Theater.

1416
02:51:05,404 --> 02:51:19,213
[SPEAKER_15]: that could be bringing in so much more money, an increase to the investment, to that treasure of a theater, where we could actually bring in enough money

1417
02:51:21,055 --> 02:51:40,453
[SPEAKER_15]: by bringing in bigger names with more investment to that almost 2,000 seat theater to see the increase in sales and whatnot to our downtown business district that's being crippled by the Craddock Bridge repair, and then use that money to actually really reduce water rates and property rates.

1418
02:51:41,414 --> 02:51:45,019
[SPEAKER_15]: and so many other things.

1419
02:51:45,039 --> 02:51:50,045
[SPEAKER_15]: $1,200,000 taken in by the Community Preservation Act.

1420
02:51:50,665 --> 02:51:57,674
[SPEAKER_15]: To see that when we know we have surpluses in other areas, I mean, to me that's money taken out of the economy.

1421
02:51:58,615 --> 02:51:59,456
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going away from

1422
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:09,308
[SPEAKER_15]: from people being able to pay a better rent in Medford or a better mortgage or better prices for goods and services.

1423
02:52:10,108 --> 02:52:11,570
[SPEAKER_15]: I think Mr. Penter is right.

1424
02:52:12,130 --> 02:52:20,597
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this body should stand up on this and sit down with the mayor in these subcommittee meetings that I've been going to.

1425
02:52:21,938 --> 02:52:28,023
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes department heads coming without full facts on each decimal point.

1426
02:52:29,133 --> 02:52:31,134
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes department heads might even be in there.

1427
02:52:31,554 --> 02:52:36,657
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes the Hormel commission department wasn't there on, on Saturday morning, I believe it was.

1428
02:52:38,778 --> 02:52:43,940
[SPEAKER_15]: And then wondering why, why is there a Hormel commission in a, in a park commission?

1429
02:52:44,120 --> 02:52:47,642
[SPEAKER_15]: Why, why isn't that one, one, one commission?

1430
02:52:49,303 --> 02:52:51,244
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I am wondering about that.

1431
02:52:52,421 --> 02:52:59,505
[SPEAKER_16]: With the land transfer, when the city accepted ownership of Hormel Stadium, the establishment of the Hormel Commission was statutory and is required by state law.

1432
02:53:02,147 --> 02:53:04,348
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I guess that explains that.

1433
02:53:04,668 --> 02:53:21,398
[SPEAKER_15]: But why can't, through maybe Hormel petition, we combine the two, like we've done in other things, like Councilor Marks brought up on Saturday morning at the subcommittee meeting, different ways that this body has brought other

1434
02:53:22,560 --> 02:53:26,862
[SPEAKER_15]: like the Traffic Commission, I think it was, and the Off-Street Parking Commission into one.

1435
02:53:27,563 --> 02:53:30,524
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I'm hoping to see more of when I go to these subcommittee meetings.

1436
02:53:30,885 --> 02:53:36,948
[SPEAKER_15]: Streamlining government, making it smaller, more responsible, more effective, more transparent and accountable.

1437
02:53:37,566 --> 02:53:45,452
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, to see all these dollar amounts too, that are coming in for 450,000 that was budgeted for 2017.

1438
02:53:46,393 --> 02:53:46,954
[SPEAKER_15]: They only spent 420.

1439
02:53:47,334 --> 02:53:49,436
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, what happens to that other 30,000?

1440
02:53:49,636 --> 02:53:56,341
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, it just gets rolled over into the general fund and not being applied to next year's spending.

1441
02:53:59,244 --> 02:54:02,246
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, Mr. President is, uh, continue.

1442
02:54:03,214 --> 02:54:04,994
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a point of information to be made?

1443
02:54:05,114 --> 02:54:06,135
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, thank you.

1444
02:54:06,735 --> 02:54:08,055
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1445
02:54:09,195 --> 02:54:14,916
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to say that, you know, I mean, you guys are very smart and intelligent people.

1446
02:54:15,376 --> 02:54:17,356
[SPEAKER_15]: You see what's going on.

1447
02:54:18,097 --> 02:54:28,598
[SPEAKER_15]: $167 million being proposed to spend this year, but not in areas where we could actually bring in more money and provide better rates on all sorts of taxes to the citizens.

1448
02:54:28,738 --> 02:54:32,639
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a shame and it's disconcerting, and I hope

1449
02:54:33,174 --> 02:54:36,457
[SPEAKER_15]: that the public is watching during this election year.

1450
02:54:36,577 --> 02:54:37,718
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1451
02:54:38,498 --> 02:54:38,879
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1452
02:54:41,721 --> 02:54:42,902
[SPEAKER_14]: May I have an address to the record, please?

1453
02:54:43,983 --> 02:54:46,425
[SPEAKER_14]: Andrew Cushion Street and Abbott Street.

1454
02:54:47,165 --> 02:54:59,355
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the same location today, June 13th, 2017, that the big city neglected infested tree had fallen down an hour and a half ago all around my house.

1455
02:55:02,338 --> 02:55:02,538
[SPEAKER_14]: Again,

1456
02:55:03,459 --> 02:55:04,619
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate to repeat myself.

1457
02:55:05,380 --> 02:55:06,060
[SPEAKER_14]: I've said it before.

1458
02:55:06,080 --> 02:55:06,960
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not that smart.

1459
02:55:07,360 --> 02:55:08,421
[SPEAKER_14]: I went to BU once.

1460
02:55:08,481 --> 02:55:09,161
[SPEAKER_14]: It was closed.

1461
02:55:09,681 --> 02:55:10,801
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going back either.

1462
02:55:11,181 --> 02:55:12,322
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just not going to go back.

1463
02:55:12,342 --> 02:55:13,642
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to go there.

1464
02:55:14,863 --> 02:55:24,986
[SPEAKER_14]: However, on this connectivity fee, I like to call it, we're already connected to the grid of H2O and the storage going out.

1465
02:55:27,326 --> 02:55:31,788
[SPEAKER_14]: So I kind of understand how you'd want to charge for that.

1466
02:55:32,816 --> 02:55:36,977
[SPEAKER_14]: unless you're doing a new Marauder development, and you're putting new pipes in.

1467
02:55:37,017 --> 02:55:38,497
[SPEAKER_14]: That makes sense to me.

1468
02:55:38,517 --> 02:55:42,838
[SPEAKER_14]: You might even charge $1,000, whatever it costs, depending on what the contractor's going to make.

1469
02:55:43,558 --> 02:55:51,920
[SPEAKER_14]: And as far as the shake, whatever they call that, that fee that they try to charge contractors at times if they want to develop.

1470
02:55:53,580 --> 02:55:56,041
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm thinking out loud, so to speak.

1471
02:55:56,641 --> 02:56:02,202
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm wondering if the connectivity fee is a way to generate a base

1472
02:56:04,853 --> 02:56:15,996
[SPEAKER_14]: such as when Representative Congressman Markey, I believe, an example, next door in Malden, I believe, lived in Malden, he said, when he was a congressman.

1473
02:56:16,737 --> 02:56:22,599
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not sure if that water meter was running when he supposedly lived there.

1474
02:56:24,299 --> 02:56:33,182
[SPEAKER_14]: And so now Senator Markey, I guess, would still get a connectivity fee.

1475
02:56:34,167 --> 02:56:35,027
[SPEAKER_14]: a base rate.

1476
02:56:36,728 --> 02:56:41,171
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't use any gas or my electric on the second floor because I have an empty apartment.

1477
02:56:43,011 --> 02:56:46,293
[SPEAKER_14]: So the bill should be zero, you would think, but it is not zero.

1478
02:56:47,134 --> 02:56:56,218
[SPEAKER_14]: There is some sort of basic charge on the electric and, as Pinto would say, the other conglomerate for the gas.

1479
02:56:58,639 --> 02:57:03,822
[SPEAKER_14]: With $8.5 million of overcharged money out of our ratepayers' money

1480
02:57:04,366 --> 02:57:07,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Water bills, you know, it's like 1,200 bucks a year.

1481
02:57:08,568 --> 02:57:09,948
[SPEAKER_14]: On an average, I'm guesstimating.

1482
02:57:12,450 --> 02:57:15,211
[SPEAKER_14]: Why do you want to shake down the lower middle class especially?

1483
02:57:15,611 --> 02:57:17,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Give us a break, please.

1484
02:57:18,332 --> 02:57:18,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1485
02:57:18,712 --> 02:57:21,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address of the record, please.

1486
02:57:21,994 --> 02:57:23,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Jean Nuzzo, 35 Parrish Street.

1487
02:57:24,835 --> 02:57:30,297
[SPEAKER_08]: So having listened tonight, I was unable to attend the last meeting where this topic was discussed.

1488
02:57:30,317 --> 02:57:33,799
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm happy to hear it again and become more familiar with it.

1489
02:57:35,665 --> 02:57:49,194
[SPEAKER_08]: As I sit here and I ponder this, I think about the fact that there are many people who live in the city of Method that work two jobs to be able to afford the homes they have, and they're strapped, and things are tight for them.

1490
02:57:49,874 --> 02:57:59,461
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think of our elderly community, which is a high number of people in the city of Method, more than some other cities, and how they might be on fixed incomes.

1491
02:58:00,290 --> 02:58:05,111
[SPEAKER_08]: and others who maybe use water less as a method to help save money.

1492
02:58:05,991 --> 02:58:17,153
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's decisions like these, $60 for water connectivity, $100 some odd for CPA, it's really death by paper cut for these people.

1493
02:58:17,713 --> 02:58:22,374
[SPEAKER_08]: It's incremental and repetitive and it cuts deeply over time.

1494
02:58:23,154 --> 02:58:29,015
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's decisions and choices like this that create a tipping point that force these people out of our city.

1495
02:58:29,952 --> 02:58:37,254
[SPEAKER_08]: and make them move someplace else, a city that has historically been made up of people who are hardworking individuals.

1496
02:58:37,894 --> 02:58:42,255
[SPEAKER_08]: And it troubles me greatly that I continue to see this gentrification going on.

1497
02:58:42,796 --> 02:58:51,718
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really would urge you to consider maybe some type of tiered approach, especially for those folks who maybe are just making ends meet.

1498
02:58:52,558 --> 02:58:58,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Because some of us can handle it, but there are others in our community that cannot.

1499
02:58:59,172 --> 02:59:10,082
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I just would like to raise that point because it makes them vulnerable, it makes them vulnerable to the loss of their property, and it makes them vulnerable to opportunistic developers.

1500
02:59:10,402 --> 02:59:10,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1501
02:59:11,023 --> 02:59:11,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1502
02:59:13,125 --> 02:59:14,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

1503
02:59:14,906 --> 02:59:16,167
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1504
02:59:17,406 --> 02:59:21,129
[SPEAKER_16]: My experiences with the members of the Water and Sewer Commission have been nothing but positive.

1505
02:59:21,209 --> 02:59:31,877
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that they're a great group of individuals, and if given the opportunity to explain themselves and explain the connectivity, if you will do so in a fashion that will make people a little bit more understanding of their implementation and their reasoning behind it.

1506
02:59:32,557 --> 02:59:41,363
[SPEAKER_16]: With that being said, Mr. President, on the community calendar this evening, it's posted that the next Water and Sewer Commission meeting is on 6-28 at 5 p.m.

1507
02:59:41,383 --> 02:59:42,184
[SPEAKER_16]: in the council chambers.

1508
02:59:42,894 --> 02:59:51,277
[SPEAKER_16]: So those individuals that do have questions that concerns about the connectivity feel the baseline charges as it's called can appear and before the Commission And take those issues up that evening.

1509
02:59:51,317 --> 03:00:10,483
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be in this room and it's my understanding it may be televised, but I'm not sure Thank you for that information councillor night Motion to receive and place on file seconded by councillor night all in favor motion passes

1510
03:00:11,986 --> 03:00:14,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Records of the meeting of June 6th.

1511
03:00:16,129 --> 03:00:16,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Marks.

1512
03:00:18,431 --> 03:00:24,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Before you read the records, this past Thursday, we had a groundbreaking in the city of Method.

1513
03:00:25,697 --> 03:00:30,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Myself, Council President Caraviello, and Councilor Lungo-Koehn were present.

1514
03:00:31,562 --> 03:00:37,407
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a groundbreaking, Mr. President, for the first ever dog park in this community.

1515
03:00:38,508 --> 03:00:41,490
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to personally thank Mr. President

1516
03:00:42,168 --> 03:00:43,669
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, the pause for method group.

1517
03:00:44,489 --> 03:00:49,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, here was a group of five or six citizens that had a common cause.

1518
03:00:50,131 --> 03:01:00,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, one night, two and a half years ago, they got together, um, and decided that, um, it would be nice to have a full fledged dog park in the community.

1519
03:01:00,955 --> 03:01:06,277
[SPEAKER_02]: One in which dogs can exercise, socialize, and they felt there was a need, Mr. President,

1520
03:01:06,837 --> 03:01:09,678
[SPEAKER_02]: They never once approached the city administration.

1521
03:01:10,319 --> 03:01:11,359
[SPEAKER_02]: They went out on their own.

1522
03:01:11,860 --> 03:01:18,103
[SPEAKER_02]: They found $250,000 in grant money from the Stanton Foundation.

1523
03:01:18,763 --> 03:01:33,791
[SPEAKER_02]: They went out on their own, Mr. President, and found a consultant that does dog park design and design parks in Somerville and Arlington and met with this particular consultant and started the ball rolling, Mr. President.

1524
03:01:34,572 --> 03:01:48,119
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, this past Thursday after two and a half years of, uh, fundraising, dog washes, uh, the method day where they had raffle prizes and, uh, come and bring your dog to a picnic and so forth.

1525
03:01:48,760 --> 03:01:51,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm proud to say, Mr. President, as part of,

1526
03:01:51,548 --> 03:02:00,850
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, pause for method that, uh, we will have a full fledged, uh, park in our community, one with a small dog and large dogs.

1527
03:02:01,610 --> 03:02:09,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it will have a full irrigation system, lighting, uh, exercise and obstacle course for the, uh, animals.

1528
03:02:10,292 --> 03:02:18,293
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, again, this is truly, uh, uh, you know, uh, when people say, oh, you can't fight city hall, you can't get things done.

1529
03:02:18,646 --> 03:02:24,388
[SPEAKER_02]: This was truly a groundswell of just residents getting together and moving a very important issue.

1530
03:02:25,049 --> 03:02:33,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe last year, Mr. Clerk, correct me if I'm wrong, we licensed about 350 dogs, about 400 dogs in the city.

1531
03:02:34,072 --> 03:02:44,337
[SPEAKER_02]: We estimate through doing some of our own homework that there's over 7,000 dogs that reside in this community.

1532
03:02:45,157 --> 03:02:47,198
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a need for the park, Mr. President,

1533
03:02:47,879 --> 03:03:03,666
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to thank the committee members, Jim Silva, Patty Flynn, Gary DiStefano, Diane Gittner, and John Sidon, who, like I said, spent countless hours, still spending countless hours, in putting this together.

1534
03:03:04,006 --> 03:03:14,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank the McGlynn administration, who actually heard about it and got interested and saw that this group was a working group and wanted to accomplish something.

1535
03:03:15,010 --> 03:03:21,912
[SPEAKER_02]: and came on board, and then Mayor Burke followed through on her end, Mr. President, along with Delicia Hunt.

1536
03:03:21,952 --> 03:03:29,995
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to thank this group of citizens, and I'm proud that we will have our first park.

1537
03:03:30,035 --> 03:03:36,717
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be located in between the Andrews and the McGlynn School along Riverbend Park.

1538
03:03:37,397 --> 03:03:41,899
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I said, it's going to be a state-of-the-art park and something I think we can all be proud of.

1539
03:03:42,639 --> 03:03:47,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, and you should be commended for being up front of this a couple of years ago.

1540
03:03:47,721 --> 03:03:50,521
[SPEAKER_03]: And we thank you for your hard work also, Mr. Vice President.

1541
03:03:51,342 --> 03:03:52,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1542
03:03:52,342 --> 03:03:53,502
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

1543
03:03:53,542 --> 03:03:54,843
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to say the same thing.

1544
03:03:54,903 --> 03:03:56,403
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks took the lead on this.

1545
03:03:57,063 --> 03:03:59,784
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel like it was a couple of years ago.

1546
03:03:59,804 --> 03:04:02,865
[SPEAKER_13]: I've got the support of the council and support of the two mayors.

1547
03:04:03,585 --> 03:04:09,627
[SPEAKER_13]: And I too want to just thank, also thank the committee that has worked tirelessly to raise the funds and make it

1548
03:04:10,100 --> 03:04:17,183
[SPEAKER_13]: a reality, so I look forward to, and many residents look, especially those with dogs, look forward to this opening, and great job.
