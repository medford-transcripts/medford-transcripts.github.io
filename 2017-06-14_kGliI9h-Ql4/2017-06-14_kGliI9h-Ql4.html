    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3724.392s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3725.833s">As</a>  we've started our budget hearings and we've discussed a lot about personal and ordinary expenses in the City of Medford's budget, one of the things that we continuously discuss is the fact that the majority of the funds that are being appropriated in the FY18 budget are for negotiated salary increases and contractual obligations. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3746.381s">As</a>  such, Mr. President, I'm requesting that the administration provide us with some documentation relative to the status thereof related to collective bargaining agreements between employee organizations in the city and the school department so that we have a better understanding as to where they are and what direction these negotiations are going in.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3761.954s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3762.954s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3767.696s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3769.217s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3771.638s">17-521</a>  offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3774.319s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council set up a Committee of the Whole meeting to discuss the implementation of an ordinance to help fix all level three natural gas leaks and hold the gas companies accountable for better surveying, reporting, planning, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3789.564s">in</a>  remediation of such leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3791.886s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3793.347s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3795.988s">This</a>  is an issue that the city of Boston took up not too long ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3803.934s">And</a>  I think after reading about it, after discussing it with our environmental, somebody from our environmental committee, I think it's something that we definitely could benefit from having it in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3817.242s">I</a>  know we have <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3818.353s">with</a>  the engineer's office, potentially getting a new traffic engineer that may help with our issue that we have with the utility companies ripping up our roads and replacing them the way they should. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3830.682s">This</a>  is also maybe a third issue that potentially could be worked on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3836.966s">This</a>  ordinance, which I have the city of Boston's ordinance, which I've reviewed and read, it would entail <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3846.061s">Any</a>  time the city of Medford opens up a street for any reason or any construction project, any time the street is opened, our utility companies, National Grid, Eversource, would be invited or asked to come and review that portion of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3861.364s">And</a>  there would be a hope that they would survey and figure out where there are any potential leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3871.567s">Boston</a>  estimates they have thousands of gas leaks in their community, and this is a way to reduce that number. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3878.452s">We're</a>  a city that's obviously smaller than Boston, but we do have several, many, many gas leaks that I think need to be looked into, and we need to make that a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3889.3s">It's</a>  not good for the environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3890.821s">It's</a>  not good for public health. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3894.824s">And</a>  obviously, so many more reasons why we should be getting on top of these gas leaks.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3900.916s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3901.736s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Longo-Kearns, seconded by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3907.679s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3908.839s">If</a>  I could before the roll is called. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3910.52s">Councilor</a>  Longo-Kearns. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3911.74s">Yeah,</a>  I just ask that we, I'm going to send around, I'll email all the councilors the city of Boston's ordinance so that we could maybe take the summer to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3921.844s">And</a>  then I would just ask that a committee of the whole meeting be set up in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3925.966s">And</a>  hopefully once we review it, we can implement this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3930.117s">There's</a>  so many other facets to the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3932.258s">It's</a>  about nine pages long, but not only fixing the leaks, but within the ordinance, we can also mandate that anything National Grid or Eversource or any gas company provides to DPU, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, that they provide to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3952.564s">So</a>  our engineer's office, our environment office can use that and help, obviously, do what we need to do <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3959.54s">alleviate</a>  the many, many leaks that we have in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3962.641s">So</a>  it goes into depth and I won't go into it tonight, but I definitely would appreciate if my colleagues would read it so we can go through it and in the early fall and try to get this implemented as soon as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3974.603s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3974.983s">Vice</a>  President Mox.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3978.604s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3979.504s">I</a>  want to thank my council colleague for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3982.669s">Um,</a>  I brought up an issue, uh, probably about a month and a half ago regarding, uh, the meeting that took place on March 20th in this city, uh, where national grid had a community public meeting at the McGlynn middle school and, um, come to find out, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=3999.912s">Currently,</a>  according to the figures we received from National Grid, we have no grade 1 or grade 2 leaks in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4009.295s">Grade</a>  1 is eminent threat of explosion. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4011.535s">Grade</a>  2 threatens health or property. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4015.636s">And</a>  grade 3, we have over 260 leaks in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4020.957s">And</a>  even though it's no threat to health and property, Mr. President, there still are leaks in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4027.519s">And</a>  these particular leaks over time naturally become larger leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4033.561s">And</a>  from what I found out from National Grid is that they currently don't prioritize grade 3 leaks, which we have over 260, because they receive no reimbursement on grade 3 leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4049.426s">So</a>  they prioritize grade 1 and grade 2 leaks and nothing on grade 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4054.423s">If</a>  we can make it part of the report also, Mr. President, and I think it was part of the report several months back. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4061.188s">I</a>  don't know if we got a response or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4062.569s">I</a>  don't recall seeing a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4066.451s">What</a>  we can do with the grade three leaks, should we be petitioning National Grid, even though they don't prioritize them, that they come into the community and start working on these low-level grade three leaks, which to me is alarming when you have close to 300 leaks that they're aware of in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4084.247s">And</a>  those leaks could be decades old. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4087.009s">And,</a>  you know, I'm concerned about that equally. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4089.871s">I</a>  want to thank my colleague for putting this on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4092.993s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4094.034s">Council</a>  Member O'Karn.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4095.175s">Thank</a>  you, and I thank Councilor Marks for his comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4097.297s">I</a>  think we probably would see a level of times two or three of that 260 number, and that's very concerning, and I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4106.203s">And</a>  I think this ordinance, if we implement it, it would give it some teeth, because if a gas company refuses to survey an open site, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4113.618s">or</a>  doesn't repair a leak found at the site, the city will then have the right to deny permits for other street digging they apply for. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4120.381s">And</a>  I think it goes in conjunction with the committee of the whole meeting we had a week or two ago with the engineer's office, where how can we have oversight and how can we put more teeth into it when they're not doing the right thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4132.768s">And</a>  this would be another avenue to make sure not only are they repairing our street properly when they dig it up, but also come to every single <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4141.814s">project</a>  that we're doing and make sure these level three leaks are fixed and fixed accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4146.557s">And</a>  I think it's a tool that the engineer's office would hopefully, especially getting a new position, maybe including this job title in that position, I think we can make a huge dent in these level three leaks that maybe they're not affecting life, but they're killing trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4164.509s">Gas</a>  leaks kill trees, it kills vegetation, and that's all <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4168.024s">outlined</a>  in the Boston City of Boston's ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4170.926s">And</a>  I think it's something that we need to, we've got a lot done this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4174.389s">And</a>  I think this is one extra thing that we can include since we're on the utility companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4179.873s">This</a>  is one extra thing that we can use to not only for the council to have some teeth because we're allowing for certain permits, but the DPW and the engineer's office, it definitely will allow them to, you know, if they, if we can get on top of it, we can make a huge dent in a level three leaks as Boston's doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4198.237s">The</a>  issue with Boston and other cities and towns implementing this is that National Grid and Eversource are going to focus more on the communities that have these ordinances in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4207.942s">So</a>  come time when we're one of the only ones that don't have it, we'll be down on the totem pole of when they're going to fix the leaks we do have. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4216.606s">So</a>  I think that this is instrumental in staying on top of it and staying in the 2017 plus time frame of what needs to be done <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4226.823s">to</a>  cure the problem, so hopefully we can get this done in the fall and move forward.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4231.567s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4233.008s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Lingo-Kearns.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4285.112s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4287.773s">If</a>  I could just <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4293.696s">I'm</a>  asking for 2016, 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4294.977s">I</a>  just want to see the difference in claims from our law department. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4300.16s">I</a>  know that we did meet with Solicitor Rumley yesterday, and he did give us some insight, numbers off the top of his head, with regards to how many claims have been put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4309.905s">And</a>  I think that was great that he was on top of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4313.247s">I</a>  believe it was about 30 claims from pothole and street defects and nine personal injury claims from potholes, two of which were <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4322.802s">in</a>  addition to were personal injuries from people that were on bicycles that obviously went through a pothole and got injured. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4329.343s">So</a>  I wanted to know that considering how hard our DPW is working with regards to how many potholes we do have out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4338.105s">I</a>  don't know if we had a bad winter, but they're everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4340.786s">They're</a>  getting filled, but there are a number more. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4343.487s">And</a>  I know we discussed with the DPW contracting out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4346.687s">So</a>  I wanted to really see within this budget <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4349.929s">how</a>  it evens out claims versus filling versus getting a contractor so that we can make an educated decision come next week or the week after when we have to make recommendations and approve or disprove the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4362.195s">So</a>  I move approval, ask for a roll call vote.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4364.436s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4364.917s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, seconded by Councilor Scapelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4368.638s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, roll call has been requested.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4434.818s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4437.557s">had</a>  the opportunity last week to attend the monthly community police meeting down at the Medford Police Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4443.52s">And</a>  once again, they had a nice crowd, probably about 25, 30 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4447.943s">And</a>  there was about 10 people from Fern Road that attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4452.805s">And</a>  they had major issues on that road with regard to traffic and speeding. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4459.229s">And</a>  at the end of Fern Road is the intersection of Fulton Spring Road and Vista Ave and the other side of Fern Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4465.613s">It's</a>  a four-way stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4467.066s">And</a>  it's also a location for a bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4470.128s">And</a>  the traffic in that area in the morning and in the evening is really, really bad with people flying through the stop sign and then progressing down towards the Felsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4480.516s">And</a>  the speeding is really out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4482.838s">And</a>  the residents that were there that night expressed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4486.341s">And</a>  so I just wanted to ask for increased patrols on that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4490.974s">And</a>  if we could add a temporary speed bump to that street as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4495.797s">It</a>  came up that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4497.317s">Chief</a>  Sacco said he had no problems with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4501.68s">He</a>  was in favor of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4503.801s">And</a>  since I wrote this resolution, I've also talked to Brian Kearns as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4508.943s">And</a>  I believe Sergeant Hartnett was going up to look at the situation today. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4512.405s">So</a>  that's a little bit of an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4515.126s">But</a>  there are actually a couple of residents here that would like to speak on this issue.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4524.696s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4525.476s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Ronzio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4528.077s">My</a>  name is Janice Ronzio. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4529.398s">I</a>  live at 66 Fern Road.</p>

    <p>[Seifert]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4530.898s">And</a>  my name is Judy Seifert, and I live at 60 Fern Road.</p>

    <p>[Ronzio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4536.3s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[Seifert]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4536.84s">We're</a>  neighbors.</p>

    <p>[Ronzio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4539.181s">First</a>  of all, thank you for allowing us to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4542.702s">And</a>  we'd love to thank Councilor Falco for all his help. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4546.904s">He's</a>  been right there with us trying to assist us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4549.104s">This</a>  has been an ongoing problem for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4551.985s">My</a>  children are now in their 30s. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4554.858s">And</a>  when they were little, toddlers, I had signs put up on the street, you know, slow signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4561.581s">So</a>  that was 37 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4562.821s">So</a>  this is something that's not happened overnight, but it's been going on for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4567.463s">And</a>  it's at the point now where it's just really out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4570.924s">They're</a>  blowing through the four-way stop sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4573.385s">There's</a>  a bus stop, as Councilor Falco said. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4577.507s">I</a>  mean, if I had kids going to get on the bus, I wouldn't want them being up there by themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4582.949s">That's</a>  how bad it is up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4585.703s">And</a>  coming down Fern Road, what they're doing is the traffic, and to avoid Fulton Street in the morning, because of the light that backs up all the way up Fulton, they're coming down Fern Road and then coming out onto the Felsway, and they're trying to get out on the Felsway, and that's backed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4602.926s">So</a>  we had gone to a couple of police meetings and expressed to the chief that we would like something done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4613.999s">And</a>  Thursday, the day after the police meeting, there was a police officer up at the corner and he was pulling cars over for blowing the stop sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4622.327s">And</a>  they also stopped somebody near mine and Judy's house that was speeding down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4628.534s">So</a>  we're very appreciative that we're able to get something done at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4634.499s">And</a>  we also are hoping that <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4637.386s">the</a>  police could make some more presence. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4640.067s">I</a>  mean, we know that they can't be there all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4641.928s">We</a>  understand that, you know, there's problems everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4644.369s">We</a>  get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4645.65s">But</a>  if we could just for the next couple of weeks until school gets out at least, um, have a police presence in the morning, um, when it's busy, people going to work, going to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4656.754s">And</a>  then, you know, later afternoon, like suppertime when people are coming home from work, um, to just <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4663.021s">maybe</a>  be there a couple of times a week for the next few weeks just to show their presence so that people in the neighborhood or whoever's traveling will understand that something is being done to resolve this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4675.805s">So</a>  we do appreciate all the help that we're getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4678.585s">Councilor</a>  Falco, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4681.166s">And</a>  my neighbors, we have a great neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4685.187s">And</a>  a couple of years ago, we actually had a problem with a car coming up the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4689.888s">There</a>  was a young kid texting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4692.426s">flying</a>  up the street and going up the hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4694.668s">Fern</a>  Road's a pretty steep hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4696.609s">And</a>  he was going at a pretty good speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4698.131s">And</a>  he knocked a tree over on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4700.552s">So</a>  luckily, there was nobody there on the sidewalk at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4703.074s">But</a>  this is just an idea of what goes on daily on that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4708.098s">People</a>  think Fern Road is like a fantasy world, that nothing happens up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4712.022s">But</a>  it's really pretty bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4714.403s">And</a>  we're going to do what we can do to help alleviate the problem, too, if we have to put <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4720.407s">the</a>  signs up, you know, the signs that say drive as if your children lived here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4725.671s">You</a>  know, we're willing to buy those and put them on our lawns, whatever we have to do to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4730.774s">But</a>  we do appreciate all the help that we're getting here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4732.715s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4733.696s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Seifert]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4734.176s">We're</a>  also aware that when that new traffic engineer is hired, we'd certainly like that person to take a look because this is like, for now, this would really make a big difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4744.503s">But</a>  I think there's probably ways that we could solve this problem more permanently. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4751.139s">Because</a>  I don't know if the speed bumps are temporary or not.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4753.76s">I</a>  think they are so It's a temporary speed bump that they pull up in the winter because of the plows they can't keep it down year-round but It's definitely I think Something that would help in this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4771.008s">I</a>  mean we would I took a walk I live right around the corner and I took a walk down the street and met with the residents on Saturday and <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4777.492s">And</a>  it's interesting, there's a pothole in the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4780.334s">And</a>  some of them are like, don't fill the pothole because it slows down the traffic.</p>

    <p>[Ronzio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4784.818s">Let's</a>  see if it gets any bigger. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4786.979s">Put</a>  a couple of cones around just to slow some people down.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4789.801s">And</a>  that really shouldn't be the solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4791.243s">We</a>  should make sure that we fill the pothole and slow down traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4794.585s">So</a>  we're hoping that putting in that temporary speed bump would help slow down the traffic, help drivers realize that, you know what, this is a busy neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4804.733s">There's</a>  a lot of people, a lot of cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4806.698s">This</a>  is a school bus stop close by. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4808.178s">People</a>  have to drive safely. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4809.939s">And</a>  so I basically would ask a move for approval at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4815.901s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4816.421s">And</a>  thank you for your support. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4817.701s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4818.121s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4818.962s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4819.382s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4820.842s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4821.943s">I</a>  thank fellow Councilor John Falco for bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4825.984s">If</a>  I can amend that, if we can maybe add the digital speed monitor, maybe to slow people down. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4835.507s">Also,</a>  I know that <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4837.188s">Again,</a>  we've worked both Councilor Falco and Councilor Kern have been working with Sergeant Hartnett on the traffic issues as that's a major cut through, especially with the future work that's being done up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4851.398s">I</a>  think that might be something we need to rekindle for another subcommittee meeting with the hospital site and then bring Officer Hartnett. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4860.504s">I</a>  know they did a report, a traffic study that counted the cars that went through that area and it was pretty <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4867.659s">It</a>  was pretty astronomical. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4869.26s">So</a>  I think if we could put that, the, the machine there, if we can ask the chief to put that up there so people can see the speed limit and maybe that could deter some of the speeding. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4881.751s">But</a>  thank you again for this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4884.593s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4886.255s">Vice</a>  President Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4888.056s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4889.337s">And</a>  I want to thank Councilor Falco also. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4892.96s">This</a>  seems to be a recurring theme in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4896.71s">that</a>  we're hearing about pedestrian safety, cars speeding throughout our neighborhood and on our neighborhood streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4903.795s">I</a>  could just tell you firsthand, Mr. President, that when we implemented the pilot program for raised crosswalks, I personally like raised crosswalks better than a speed bump. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4915.364s">Speed</a>  bumps are very temporary in nature, and I don't think they accomplish the same goal as a raised crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4923.557s">When</a>  we did the pilot program, Mr. President, back some four years ago, Mayor McGlynn at the time said we were going to do three raised crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4931.921s">And</a>  that was back some four years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4933.442s">We've</a>  only implemented one on Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4935.923s">But</a>  I could tell you firsthand that a raised crosswalk in that particular neighborhood and in many other neighborhoods would work wonders on traffic calming, slowing down traffic, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4947.109s">in</a>  particular areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4948.55s">Now</a>  that coupled with widening sidewalks, putting up blinking lights, increasing signage in the community, that definitely has an impact also. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4957.918s">But</a>  we, you know, we can't sit back and talk about complete streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4962.222s">We've</a>  heard complete streets over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4964.084s">I</a>  read articles in the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4965.965s">That's</a>  great, we're making some initiatives on some of the major roads and with $500,000 we're hitting up several neighborhoods and providing some traffic calming initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4978.221s">But</a>  we also have to, we can't ignore the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4981.906s">because</a>  I've been on the council a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4984.028s">The</a>  concerns I hear over and over again, a lot of them are on main roads, but much, much more, Mr. President, are in the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4991.974s">And</a>  that's what I'm hearing over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4994.216s">And</a>  this is not rocket science. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4996.557s">There's</a>  ways of calming traffic down. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5000.0s">There's</a>  very simple ways, there's very cost effective ways of doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5004.681s">Sometimes</a>  it's merely just, I know the city of Cambridge does it, they paint what looks like a 3D mural in the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5012.422s">So</a>  when a car approaches, it looks like there's something impeding them from going forward because of this 3D image that's in the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5020.284s">And</a>  it's a very unique way of having at least people that are driving to be alert when they come up to an area. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5026.545s">And</a>  it's not expensive to do, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5029.527s">And,</a>  you know, in my opinion, we fall short of the mark in this community when it comes to pedestrian safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5037.692s">And</a>  in my opinion, Mr. President, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5042.233s">There's</a>  money out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5043.413s">We</a>  have over $8 million in free cash to move some of these initiatives forward in the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5049.755s">And</a>  it'll benefit not only the community in general, Mr. President, it'll send a message out to the people driving on our streets, many of which are just cutting through, Mr. President, that we're not going to tolerate this any longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5064.238s">And</a>  it sends a message out, Mr. President, when you take back your roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5068.899s">Several</a>  months back, this council voted to reduce the speed limit from 30 miles an hour to 25 miles an hour on all non-posted roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5079.341s">We</a>  have yet to see, that was several months back, one sign be erected that says the new speed limit of 25 miles an hour on our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5088.399s">So,</a>  again, we've done a pork job in communicating what was a vote of this council and eventually passed by the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5096.901s">And</a>  also, Mr. President, something that would send a message to people that are coming through our community that you have to reduce speed when you come onto Medford streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5105.444s">So</a>  I appreciate Councilor Falco for bringing this up tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5111.14s">You</a>  know, I hope more is done with this new traffic engineer that's going to be approved in the budget to really address neighborhood concerns of improvement of public safety and pedestrian safety in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5127.268s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5128.789s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5131.37s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5132.851s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Falco for bringing this forward and I wanted to second the resolve and just <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5138.246s">highlight</a>  a few points. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5139.247s">I</a>  was at the Traffic Commission meeting with you, President Caraviello, today. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5142.728s">There</a>  was speeding on Forest Street was on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5146.51s">And</a>  then I was, I wasn't aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5148.691s">And</a>  then I was there for the South Street speeding issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5151.612s">So</a>  this is happening all over our community and we just have to keep on top of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5155.634s">And</a>  street by street, we need to, and hopefully the traffic engineer will do that, street by street, problem area by problem area, we need to figure out ways to slow down the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5166.711s">widening</a>  sidewalks is going on up near the Brooks School, simple signage that can be put up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5174.514s">We</a>  need to do this throughout our community, and this obviously is a problem spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5178.736s">So</a>  I definitely am happy that we're going to try to move forward on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5182.217s">And</a>  what is a positive note is that Sergeant Hartnett and the Traffic Division are working hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5188.36s">I</a>  was driving down South Street yesterday, and I see Sergeant Hartnett out with a little machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5194.931s">And</a>  I pulled over and I said, what are you doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5196.732s">I</a>  guess we have new laser guns that 10 officers have been trained in recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5203.774s">I</a>  think he said last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5205.435s">So</a>  I thought that was very positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5207.036s">And</a>  he said the radar guns that they purchased are coming in within the next several weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5212.898s">Also</a>  200 signs, we were in the traffic meeting today requesting that the 25 miles an hour signs be posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5221.983s">and</a>  changed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5222.844s">From</a>  what I understand, they ordered 200. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5224.325s">They're</a>  going to do, hopefully, our main thoroughfares first and any points entering the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5231.31s">But</a>  hopefully more are ordered. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5232.971s">We</a>  can switch out those signs sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5235.413s">And</a>  Councilor Scarpelli brought it up, too, that the monitor sign, those signs, we've ordered two. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5242.699s">And</a>  those are coming in very soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5244.64s">And</a>  those need to be, I said it before, we need a list of everywhere that people are complaining about and put it there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5251.309s">It</a>  needs to be, those two need to be utilized all the time so that we can slow down the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5256.472s">So</a>  I move, I second the resolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5258.432s">Just</a>  wanted to note some positive points because we have been involved in approving them and the spending of the money to approve them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5266.176s">And</a>  I'm glad we have a staff in the traffic division that we are now seeing out and utilizing these tools to hopefully make it, the streets safer.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5276.221s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5277.133s">Vice</a>  President Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5278.514s">Just</a>  if I could amend the paper, if Councilor Falco doesn't mind, just popped in my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5283.637s">Doonan</a>  Street is a four-way stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5286.599s">I'm</a>  getting complaints from neighbors that no one is actually adhering to the four-way stop at all on Doonan, and people just going by without coming to a stop at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5296.106s">So</a>  if we could have Sergeant Hartnett in the Traffic Division go out and take a look at that particular area, Mr. President, that would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5303.991s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5304.592s">Yes,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5305.472s">It's</a>  a four-way stop.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5307.165s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, as amended by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5313.509s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5314.349s">I'm</a>  sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5317.291s">In?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5318.131s">Amended</a>  by Councilor Scapelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5320.833s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5322.914s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5326.216s">17-523,</a>  offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5329.077s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council send a written communication to Massport requesting that they- Are we still under suspension?</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5335.04s">Are</a>  we still under suspension?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5336.661s">Uh,</a>  we just went out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5337.601s">That's</a>  all we wrote. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5339.082s">We</a>  just went out of order.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5340.963s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5342.504s">Can</a>  I add something to the suspension while we're talking while we're under a suspension and vice president marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5347.986s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. This is an important item. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5349.347s">That's</a>  the only reason why I wanted to bring it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5351.428s">Um,</a>  several weeks back, uh, through this council, we requested that the city solicitor talk to Paul Moki, the building commissioner, and also Ed Finn regarding a proposed wireless communication ordinance that was proposed back in 2011. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5366.395s">uh,</a>  before this method city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5368.738s">And,</a>  uh, we got a response in our packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5370.559s">I</a>  think everyone has a copy tonight of, uh, the ordinance that was drafted back in 2011. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5375.864s">Uh,</a>  this ordinance also includes, uh, language that was inserted by a national grid at the time, uh, to amend our ordinance, Mr. President, to allow <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5388.092s">wireless</a>  communication on the polls. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5390.816s">But</a>  this ordinance, Mr. President, is directly related to what many people may have saw on the local news just recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5398.227s">The</a>  MBTA right now is trying to generate some additional revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5403.514s">And</a>  they're providing a service to their commuter rail customers that they'll be able to have internet access on the train for a nominal fee, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5414.26s">And</a>  in order to provide that service, they need to erect cell phone towers throughout <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5420.856s">many</a>  communities that the commuter rail goes through. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5425.737s">And</a>  I happened to catch it on Channel 5, and this council voted on it actually a couple months even prior to it coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5432.739s">But</a>  most of the communities where the commuter rail goes through, they're going to be erecting cell phone towers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5439.1s">In</a>  the city of Medford, there's already two requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5443.264s">for</a>  cell phone towers, one on Tyler Ave and one on Charnwood Road, which are directly within neighborhoods, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5451.028s">And</a>  the ordinance that was offered back in 2011 would prohibit cell phone towers from being erected in any area except for industrial and commercial zones. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5464.776s">And</a>  right now, all you need is a building permit and an electrical permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5469.554s">and</a>  you can erect a 74-foot cell tower in your backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5473.859s">It's</a>  as easy as that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5475.993s">So</a>  the ordinance, Mr. President, which I think we have to meet pretty immediately on, I'd ask that it go to the subcommittee on zoning and ordinance, or unless the council sees fit to have a committee of the whole on it, I would venture to say this language is ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5493.697s">This</a>  language, in my opinion, has been vetted out thoroughly. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5497.178s">I</a>  think it does deserve to be vetted out more by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5500.619s">But</a>  at this point, Mr. President, I would ask, through a vote of this council, that this particular correspondence dated June 8th from the city solicitor regarding wireless communication and facility ordinance be sent to either the Zoning and Ordinance Subcommittee or Committee of the Whole, Mr. President, for further discussion and quick action, because this is a very important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5524.669s">I</a>  would take your recommendation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5528.424s">We'll</a>  do the best we see if we can get it done before the summer session. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5530.566s">Can</a>  we take a vote on that, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5532.007s">This</a>  be sent because it's a paper that... Yes, we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5535.489s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor... Roll call vote, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5539.492s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5540.853s">Mr.</a>  President, the committee has decided that they want to go to the committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5543.895s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5544.355s">I</a>  just wanted to inform the delegation that we had some preliminary discussions this evening and early last week about setting up a summer schedule for zoning and ordinance to address some of the papers that are in committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5554.426s">However,</a>  if the council feels as though we should go to a committee of the whole first, that's fine with me.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5557.507s">With</a>  time is of the essence on this, maybe we say we'll get this done quicker. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5561.388s">Whatever</a>  the body wants to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5562.728s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5564.249s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Naix, roll call vote has been requested.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5634.967s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5635.868s">President</a>  Caraviello, I would just first like to amend this and also request that there be a noise monitor in South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5643.75s">Over</a>  the last several weeks, South Medford has picked up in flights. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5647.231s">I</a>  actually went down there last night and again, every minute, especially over the Columbus Park area and the entire South Medford, I guess, is getting hit pretty bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5657.313s">Hopefully</a>  we will see a decrease to a level in a couple of weeks when the two <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5662.389s">runways</a>  that are under maintenance are back up and running, but we still have the problem with the 33L. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5668.351s">I</a>  know the mayor's office has sent a request to Massport that we be provided another noise monitoring device above the Andrews School. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5678.496s">So</a>  I think the council, if we could get a vote tonight and send a letter from the entire council to Massport and to our state delegation requesting that they do whatever they can to obviously <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5692.031s">alleviate</a>  the noise, but more importantly, what will go with that is the noise monitoring systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5698.816s">One</a>  over the Andrews, one over the Heights, and one over South Medford should cover the problem areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5704.28s">I</a>  know Wellington's getting hit good, but the Andrews should cover that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5707.623s">I</a>  think any noise monitoring devices that we can get in Medford are going to be beneficial because they're going to track the levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5714.328s">And</a>  once the levels are what obviously residents are reporting, sometimes they're flying the way they should, but other times <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5722.159s">If</a>  it comes over directly above your home, you feel like the plane is landing on your house. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5727.121s">So</a>  we need to figure out how often that is happening, because it shouldn't be. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5731.463s">And</a>  that will hopefully help us in getting some relief with regards to what can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5738.666s">I</a>  know MIT is on their second portion of the study. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5742.047s">And</a>  we need to figure out what can be done to help Medford, whether that be flying higher, taking different routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5748.55s">Something</a>  needs to be done to help Medford, even after the <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5752.648s">the</a>  end of June date we're getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5756.01s">So</a>  I would just like to back the mayor up on the Andrew School Monitor, request two additional ones, and make sure that the city council, as amended, sends a letter requesting this to Massport and also to our entire state delegation to push and help Medford with this problem that so many are stricken by.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5775.982s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5777.403s">Councilor</a>  Neistat. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5778.499s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5779.981s">I</a>  certainly think that noise monitors will help us in our plight against Massport and the airplane noise that we have in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5787.889s">I</a>  do have a question, maybe we can put this in as a B paper, as to how the location of the Andrews School was selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5795.736s">I</a>  know that we've had a number of discussions about <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5798.703s">locations</a>  of noise monitors, where we want to put them, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5802.706s">If</a>  we're going to be requesting that a delegation expend funds and we're going to be requesting the placement of additional noise monitors, I guess my question is, do we want to take a longer how to look at it and study whether or not we can get more bank for our buck with the placement of three towers in different locations that may cover the entire city? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5820.34s">Because</a>  it's my understanding we have one tower in the community now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5823.122s">If</a>  we had four towers in the community, we'd be able to cover the whole city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5827.366s">How</a>  was this location selected, I guess, would be my first question, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5831.569s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5832.47s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5833.21s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5834.491s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5835.492s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5838.894s">And</a>  it's a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5840.676s">And</a>  I think the reason why the mayor chose the Andrews Middle School is because, and I attended with a number of my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5847.141s">I</a>  can't remember exactly who was there, but Luke Presner from CAC board and Peter Hook. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5855.467s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5857.027s">They</a>  gave us a great outline of what's going on and what's taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5862.089s">And</a>  the new GPS system that they've been using since, oh, for a few years now, it tracks all planes out of 33L that are going in this location. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5872.352s">They</a>  come over the Andrews and then they disperse. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5875.753s">So</a>  the Andrews was picked because every single plane that flies out of Logan that is coming through Medford is going over the Andrews school and then <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5886.727s">going</a>  in different directions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5887.848s">So</a>  some are going over South Medford, some are going over the Heights, but I think that obviously is the number one place that it needs to go, which is why obviously the mayor's requesting that, but where the complaints are coming from the Heights and South Medford just as much, maybe not as, I mean, I'm getting complaints from everywhere, but South Medford, North Medford and the Heights are the three locations where I'm seeing all the complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5914.0s">And</a>  I think if we can request, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5916.525s">as</a>  many as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5917.546s">Obviously,</a>  three, I think, would cover where the complaints are coming from and where I've seen the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5923.851s">I</a>  think that would be helpful.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5925.693s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5926.453s">Councilor</a>  Layton.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5927.494s">So</a>  the reason that the Andrews Middle School would be the selected location is because, based upon the information that a Massport CLC representative has told us, is that 100% of the aircrafts that fly out of Logan on that runway will go over that beacon? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5943.087s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5944.318s">So</a>  if 100% of the- Well, from their studies, they're saying that they go to the Andrews and then they split.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5951.443s">So</a>  100% of the planes are going to fly over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5954.625s">A</a>  decent amount of them, yes.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5958.968s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5959.949s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5960.85s">I'd</a>  like to thank Councilor Longo-Kerr for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5964.612s">This</a>  is an issue that I get calls about all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5968.255s">And</a>  like you said, it doesn't matter really what part of the city you live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5972.932s">It</a>  impacts everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5974.133s">And</a>  it's unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5975.894s">I</a>  was at that meeting about a month ago that they had right here at City Hall, and the place was packed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5981.017s">And</a>  it really does impact the quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5983.298s">We</a>  should be doing everything we can to combat this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5986.5s">I</a>  know I've actually been communicating to people in the community to call the Massport line and to log complaints online. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5996.447s">And</a>  you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=5997.347s">And</a>  one of the things that they did mention that night was all of the planes, basically, when they take off, they come <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6002.401s">basically</a>  right down Riverside Ave, right over the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6005.002s">So</a>  it does sound like probably a good place to have the beacon. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6008.864s">But</a>  the thing to really keep in mind here is that that night at the meeting, what they mentioned is this problem is really only going to get worse because of the reconfiguration of, I think it was Terminal E, and there's going to be over the next, I think, five years, there's going to be more carriers leaving it at off-peak times. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6027.014s">So</a>  this problem, I know people say, well, once they repair that runway, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6031.547s">You</a>  know, it's going to get better. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6033.488s">Maybe</a>  it will get better for the short term, but for the long term, this is a problem that's going to impact us for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6039.249s">So</a>  we really need to make sure that we stay on top of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6042.03s">Thank</a>  you for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6043.61s">And</a>  people really need to continue to make sure that they call the Massport noise line and to log their complaints online as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6053.353s">It</a>  does have an impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6054.513s">You</a>  can see in Milton, the city of Milton, that it had an impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6060.66s">thousands</a>  and thousands of more complaints than we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6063.521s">So</a>  people really need to get out, voice their opinion, and let Massport know that this is a problem, and it does impact the quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6070.984s">So</a>  I'd just like to thank you for bringing this forward, and I second the motion.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6090.267s">This</a>  council, I think it was back a couple of months ago, took a vote to ask that another monitor be added to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6096.71s">I</a>  don't think we gave a location, but at the time we asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6100.111s">The</a>  key to this issue, Mr. President, you know, we could talk all we want until we get our congressional delegation to stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6107.254s">It</a>  was just mentioned by Councilor Falco and Milton. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6110.635s">You</a>  know, Milton didn't do it on their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6112.546s">It</a>  was Congressman Lynch that stood up in the federal government, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6117.855s">He</a>  got the FFA to have a meeting, FAA to have a meeting, Mr. President, and they acted upon Congressman Lynch. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6125.672s">And</a>  I hate to say it, Mr. President, but that hasn't happened in this community yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6130.074s">We</a>  haven't seen that level, Mr. President, of congressional delegation intervening on behalf of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6140.12s">Another</a>  thing, and I don't want to rehash old news, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6144.031s">It's</a>  great, we have two great representatives on that community advisory committee now to Logan Airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6150.439s">And</a>  during those meetings, these local cities and towns all have a representative that sits so they can be at the table and they can add input. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6159.629s">when</a>  Logan Airport and the FAA are making decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6163.813s">And</a>  for over five years, Mr. President, and this council brought it up over and over again, for over five years, Medford's representative on that committee was a no-show. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6174.362s">Medford</a>  was not representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6175.783s">I</a>  went and I pulled all the minute meetings <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6178.665s">And</a>  it showed you where people and what communities were attending those meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6184.129s">And</a>  Medford was a no-show for years, Mr. President, while a lot of this discussion and dialogue was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6190.934s">It's</a>  great now that the mayor's on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6193.556s">It's</a>  great we have two excellent community advisory members. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6197.539s">But</a>  for years, we were not at the table, and this city was not representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6202.56s">And</a>  that was a problem, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6204.661s">I</a>  hope we're able to get around that now with our congressional delegation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6210.886s">And</a>  I know with the renewed interest now in the Community Advisory Board and those particular two gentlemen who are very knowledgeable on air traffic and other issues, I believe we will be represented now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6224.114s">But</a>  I think part of the problem was we were a no-show, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6229.358s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6577.464s">I</a>  believe the implementation of GPS trackers is part of the federal government's edict to Massport to transition from a beacon system to a GPS system. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6586.389s">And</a>  as part of that, it's a directive of the federal government, which would preclude the city of Medford from going up the chain and suing the state government or the federal government due to federal preemption.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6842.574s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6843.454s">I</a>  do know that the Medford Police do use that for training. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6847.675s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6849.055s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6850.975s">Councilor</a>  Marks gave a good overview, and I agree with what he said, and I think this sparked, people have been asking what is going on, and then there was some activity from the Medford Police, and Councilor Marks and I, I think helps get the questions answered with regards to dog training, and we talked to Chief Sacco, who said that the city did give permission to do that, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6872.469s">And</a>  that's all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6874.07s">But</a>  what is the plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6876.13s">And</a>  I would actually like to know something, whether there's been discussions about it, the potential uses for it, the potential for putting money into the building for certain purposes, such as an arts facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6891.297s">Just</a>  would like some sort of answer before we vote on this year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6895.078s">We</a>  haven't seen anywhere in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6897.299s">And</a>  I would like to know if, obviously, it's not going to be in fiscal year 2018 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6902.699s">What</a>  is our plan down the line? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6904.761s">It</a>  wasn't in the capital plan, the draft capital plan that we got five, six, seven months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6911.325s">That</a>  has been altered. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6912.586s">We</a>  haven't got a new capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6914.407s">Would</a>  it be in the new capital plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6915.828s">I'm</a>  not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6916.429s">It</a>  wasn't in the first one. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6917.67s">So</a>  what are we going to do with the building? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6919.831s">And</a>  Councilmax is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6920.912s">Is</a>  it just going to deteriorate year after year, and we're going to get nothing out of it and put nothing into it? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6926.636s">Or</a>  are we going to maintain it? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6928.417s">What</a>  is our plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6930.816s">matter</a>  what, I think we just need the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6932.397s">And</a>  I think that's important because it's a good-sized building. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6935.399s">It's</a>  in a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6937.241s">These</a>  neighbors pay taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6939.022s">They</a>  want to know what's going on, what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6942.224s">And</a>  if we could get some sort of answer before we vote on the budget, I think that would be beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6947.908s">And</a>  it would get a lot of questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6949.809s">And</a>  we'll be able to tell the residents and the neighborhood what the potential plan is. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6954.612s">Or</a>  A, B, and C may happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6957.194s">I</a>  think everybody has a right to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6959.707s">Uh,</a>  it could be very expensive to maintain the building for the long run if we're not going to create a use for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6965.872s">Um,</a>  so I think that's important.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6967.573s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6968.574s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6969.535s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6970.355s">I'd</a>  like to thank my council colleagues for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6972.657s">I</a>  think this is a very important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6974.198s">Um,</a>  and you're right, it's a very important piece of property and there are a number of, um, groups that could use this as a home in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6981.024s">The</a>  arts, recreation, you name it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6983.666s">Um,</a>  it's, it's a, it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6985.675s">It's</a>  a prime opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6987.697s">And</a>  so I'm glad it's back in the city's hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6991.119s">Back</a>  when the Council of Marks brought this forward a few months ago, I amended the resolution because I thought that we should honestly have a committee of the whole meeting to actually walk through the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7001.707s">The</a>  property has not been in the control of the city for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7006.19s">And</a>  we should really see firsthand, I think, the condition of the building and what we're getting back. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7011.414s">But</a>  if that's not going to happen, I'd like to amend the paper, if you don't mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7014.957s">that</a>  we get a report back from the building department that gives us basically a report back to us about the overall condition of the building, you know, with regard to, you know, heating or windows, roofing, I mean, anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7030.208s">I</a>  mean, this is something that we need to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7033.231s">We</a>  should know about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7034.291s">I</a>  mean, these are very important matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7036.873s">I</a>  mean, anytime you have a building like this, that's, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7041.65s">That's</a>  part of your city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7043.431s">And</a>  you really need to know and keep an eye on the maintenance, the preventive maintenance, what kind of money has been spent or is going to be spent, what kind of money it's going to take to bring this back online. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7054.535s">I</a>  mean, I assume it's probably ready to go, because it was functioning not too long ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7059.677s">But</a>  I really think we should, as a council and as a city, know what we're getting back from Bridgewell. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7066.68s">So</a>  if I could amend the paper to include that, I'd greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7070.001s">And</a>  I second that resolution.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7073.1s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7074.381s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7075.121s">Um,</a>  again, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7076.661s">Uh,</a>  my fellow councilors bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7078.342s">I</a>  know that just to shed some light, this is one of the, uh, first meetings we had with, uh, the recreation focus group. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7085.525s">We</a>  talked about, um, facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7088.786s">And</a>  one thing we did talk about and have met with the mayor's office is that, uh, a dual function, whether it's recreation, whether it's the art council or, um, or S or such other, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7100.655s">Uh,</a>  facility, but I know that they've had, um, the building inspectors in there and for the sole purpose to see what we can do for housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7110.741s">Um,</a>  such very important, uh, um, initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7115.143s">So</a>  I think that they've, they've been doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7117.324s">So</a>  I too, if we can call for that committee of the whole meeting and, and get an update because I, you know, the, uh, the activity that was there could have been, uh, the, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7129.537s">the</a>  builders that were looking in to see what needed to be done there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7133.039s">Obviously</a>  we know the police have been there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7134.821s">So,</a>  um, I know that the mayor's office has been actively, uh, searching and working with that site to see what's best for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7143.006s">So</a>  I'm pretty excited about the possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7145.288s">So</a>  thank you for your input. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7147.209s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7192.573s">The</a>  city clerk, the city clerk then takes that paper and puts it back in our packet as a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7196.937s">I</a>  think it might be a little bit more efficient, Mr. President, if we, um, considered tabling the matter for one week, brought the matter up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7202.442s">Are</a>  you making a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7203.8s">Well,</a>  I mean, I think that this isn't my resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7205.741s">It's</a>  a resolution that's been brought forward by two Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7207.661s">It's</a>  been seconded, thirded, and fourthed at this point in time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7210.462s">But</a>  I think that this is an alternative course of action that we can take where we may get an answer a little bit quicker. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7215.364s">So</a>  if it's the body's wishes and the delegation's wishes to go through the process and wait for a response back, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7220.905s">If</a>  we want to table it and maybe have a meeting tomorrow with the building commissioner and ask him about it, or do both for that matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7225.707s">I</a>  mean, we can raise the issue tomorrow with the budget hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7227.568s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7228.768s">I</a>  just think that for us to send the paper forward and then ask for a response <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7232.682s">you</a>  know, have the approval of the budget be contingent upon a report back on the Agnes Center, it might be more expedient for us to sit down with the building commissioner and discuss this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7240.826s">They're</a>  going to be before us tomorrow night anyway, provided we provide him with the notice that this is a topic of conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7245.828s">I</a>  don't think he'll have any problem discussing it tomorrow when answering some of the questions and concerns that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7250.65s">If</a>  we need to delve further into the situation, then we can put a paper forward addressing the specific questions that we want answered that have ever been unanswered. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7259.005s">But</a>  again, I certainly would defer to the wisdom of the body. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7262.347s">I</a>  just think that this might be a more expedient way to get it done.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7641.684s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7642.544s">That</a>  would not be the intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7643.565s">In</a>  my understanding, based upon the discussions that I've had with the chief of police, is that certain sections of the general laws would need to be adopted before we can utilize traffic cameras to even consider issuing speeding and tickets or parking, moving violations. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7655.649s">But</a>  that's not my intent at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7657.07s">It's</a>  more or less a see something, say something opportunity for us to monitor the streets, and if something happens, have the ability to go back and review what those eyes have seen to maybe see if we can identify trends or identify certain <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7670.802s">criteria</a>  that might contribute to public safety concerns, whether it be traffic backing up in the morning at Winthrop Street, so cars taking a left-hand turn go around the rotary once and then try to cut into the left-hand lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7682.107s">If</a>  we see a patent of involvement or a patent of activity at a certain location, maybe we can put a sign up there, a patent of activity where the police have to be called. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7689.37s">We</a>  can put the cameras up on those intersections and then take a look at what's going on there and then go back and monitor it and see if maybe we can control it through signage, through other traffic control devices, through education.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7702.247s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7703.027s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could, I don't have a problem with the way you just explained it, but you can also accomplish that by doing traffic studies, which we've done in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7713.63s">You</a>  know, if it's a helpful tool, I don't see a problem with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7718.371s">I'm</a>  not sure if we have the manpower to monitor these particular cameras, how it would be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7723.872s">We</a>  seem to not be able to do the very basic things in the community, and I'm not sure how we're going to monitor cameras <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7731.667s">throughout</a>  the community to make improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7734.069s">But</a>  I guess it's worth exploring. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7737.352s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7845.782s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7847.202s">I</a>  know Somerville and Chelsea use this same thing as a tool that if something does happen, a crime, they're able to, let's go to the nearest intersection and see which car, where did this go? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7858.124s">Can</a>  we get a license plate? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7860.085s">Can</a>  we even see in the vehicle and see how many people were in the vehicle? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7863.505s">We</a>  had an incident in Wellington Circle, oh gosh, last summer maybe, where a car hit a pedestrian. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7870.347s">I</a>  believe the pedestrian died. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7873.263s">Um,</a>  we had no cameras at Wellington circle, but thankfully I believe my, um, the other person that rents out of the building I'm in the painted bird tattoo had cameras, was able to catch a video of the car. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7886.186s">That</a>  video from the business was put on TV and you know, I don't know if the suspect was, was caught, but that's something we in Medford don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7893.828s">You</a>  also have a lot of, he said, she said car accidents where the victims, you know, you, you don't know who the actual victim is. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7899.629s">Um,</a>  but those cameras can help find the true victim. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7903.829s">Um,</a>  very easily. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7904.77s">So</a>  it's a great tool that our police department could use to go back and say, Oh, let's see what happened on main and, and self last night at nine 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7912.717s">Um,</a>  I think it would definitely be beneficial, especially, especially if the cost is, is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7917.622s">Um,</a>  I think it's something we could use in Medford.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7919.865s">Thank</a>  you on the motion by vice president mocks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7924.737s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7926.318s">And</a>  I don't want people to think I'm opposed to cameras and doing all that good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7931.079s">I</a>  just think there could be a potential abuse if we don't know what they're being utilized for. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7938.061s">Secondly,</a>  Mr. President, I think it's been maybe three years that we've asked, this council has requested the administration for a camera on Commercial Street in particular because of the dumping <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7950.66s">that</a>  goes on there, TVs, refrigerators, over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7955.204s">One</a>  camera we asked for on Commercial Street, and to date, it hasn't happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7960.307s">So</a>  I'm in favor of cameras on every corner, on every street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7964.411s">It's</a>  not gonna happen, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7966.272s">We</a>  can't get one on Commercial Street for dumping, which is another use, maybe, for the cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7972.537s">Catch</a>  people that are dumping stoves and refrigerators on a city street, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7979.682s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7981.533s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7982.394s">Mr.</a>  President, I certainly understand Councilor Marksley's position. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7986.236s">I</a>  think that this was more about a question of whether or not Big Brother was watching and they were going to use this as a tool to start finding violators for certain traffic violations. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7994.642s">That</a>  wasn't the intent at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7995.683s">It</a>  was a data collection tool, not a punitive measure, punitive tool.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8001.427s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8002.608s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8008.692s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8010.663s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8013.365s">We</a>  have more papers on the hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8015.686s">We</a>  want to get rid of those two more. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8018.388s">Offered</a>  by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the missing left side of the stop sign at the ends of Medwood Street, where it meets Hicks Ave, be replaced in the interest of public safety, and be it further resolved that the three construction barrels used for crossing children at the Columbus School be replaced with signs <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8038.629s">Vice</a>  President Mox.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8297.209s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Falco for bringing up the subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8300.91s">I</a>  know this has been a bone of contention in this community for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8304.492s">The</a>  fact that there are many board and commission meetings, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8307.486s">that</a>  are taking place on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8309.085s">hours</a>  that are very difficult for residents to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8312.287s">There</a>  are meetings happening during the day that most working people are unable to attend and to have a video stream or a place where you could click on a PDF file and get a copy of the minutes and also a recording of what took place is extremely helpful and something that I've supported for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8331.801s">In</a>  order to make this successful, we need to get a buy-in from the administration because as we heard, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8337.987s">that</a>  it would be great to have the council meetings recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8340.735s">We'll</a>  record it on Tuesday nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8342.435s">They</a>  replay us on Thursday and Friday on local access. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8345.858s">But</a>  in order for this to be successful, Mr. President, it has to be a buy-in from the administration that all the boards and commissions fall into this also. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8355.345s">So</a>  we know when the Zoning Board of Appeals has a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8358.047s">We</a>  know when the assessors meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8360.068s">We</a>  know when the Liquor Commission meets. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8362.75s">We</a>  know when the park board is discussing maybe a park in your area. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8367.434s">That</a>  is vital, Mr. President, to have, as Councilor Falco alluded to, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8372.253s">transparency</a>  in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8373.674s">So,</a>  we asked that in the format of a question, and I don't know if we got a response, Mr. Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8380.657s">We</a>  asked that the mayor be fully supportive of the agenda and minutes concept with all boards and commissions and school committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8389.522s">Okay,</a>  so we haven't sent this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8391.563s">So,</a>  Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8395.543s">That's</a>  important that we receive full support from the administration in order to move this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8401.826s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8403.287s">But</a>  Councilor Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8405.689s">As</a>  a sign of her support, I believe the mayor allocated funds for this in the legislative budget.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8410.972s">That's</a>  correct Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8413.133s">Councilor</a>  Lococo.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8414.253s">I</a>  just want to back that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8415.754s">Even</a>  though it's in the budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8418.504s">We</a>  do want every single board and commission to be televised. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8421.967s">We</a>  want the minutes online. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8423.209s">We</a>  want complete and full transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8425.791s">We</a>  want to make sure that the mayor is going to ask each and every board and commission to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8430.876s">I</a>  believe it's obvious that we want our committee, the whole meetings and subcommittee meetings taped as well as city council meetings here taped and video streamed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8441.346s">But</a>  we also were requesting additional, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8445.421s">I</a>  think it should be number three on this committee report. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8449.203s">We</a>  did request additional, I forget what the device was. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8453.664s">There's</a>  a certain device that is a few hundred dollars that you'll need in each room you want to video. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8461.248s">So</a>  we were requesting not only it be one in this room, but we have one in at least 207 and 201, and maybe even one upstairs so that we can make this possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8471.312s">But</a>  no matter how many we purchase, we need the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8474.475s">the</a>  administration to request and almost mandate that every single meeting is televised and takes part in this program, because that's where you're going to see money being worth it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8487.581s">Our</a>  meetings are televised anyway, but to get every single commission and board meeting televised and open to the public and as transparent as possible is the purpose of doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8499.818s">not</a>  only city council meetings, but every single board and commission meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8503.24s">I</a>  think that's extremely important.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8513.587s">I</a>  think the $20,000 included the monitors, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8516.429s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8518.01s">I</a>  think it was $12,000 without the monitor and 20 with. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8519.41s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8519.59s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8592.645s">It</a>  was like about $800. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8594.747s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8595.507s">For</a>  that transmitter, for the transmitter, but the additional cameras and everything, I thought they said to outfit a room was going to be 12 grand. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8604.113s">So</a>  you may just want to, I know you have questions going to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8606.655s">You</a>  may just want to clarify that because I recall differently.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8613.579s">It's</a>  going to cover everything except for the extra transmitters, which were actually going to be, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8618.291s">a</a>  little bit more money, but it was not that much money. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8620.812s">Because</a>  I remember saying, well, this is actually, in the grand scheme of things, it was pretty inexpensive, I think, with regard to transparency and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8628.095s">OK.</a> </p>

Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this August body. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8846.808s">The</a>  reason why I'm up here is twofold, as the resolution indicates. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8851.348s">I</a>  was a little befuddled when I got a copy of my water bill, and then I got a copy of the letter signed by the Board of Water and Soil Commissioners as it relates to what they call a baseline fee, which is, in essence, is a new tax on the rate payers here within this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8866.493s">In</a>  their letter where they make an assessment of $24,000 is $24,483 is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8869.314s">I</a>  don't know if this is a misprint on the spelling here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8880.103s">Pardon</a>  me?</p>

    <p>[Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8946.489s">Mr.</a>  President, I was under the impression that <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8949.472s">It</a>  was not the mayor nor the council that set water rates and fees, but it was that of the Water and Sewer Commission.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8957.538s">That</a>  is my understanding, Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8960.529s">Continue,</a>  please.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8961.89s">The</a>  fact of the matter is that the Water and Sewer Commission signed it, and the mayor of this community has allowed it, and likewise, this Medford City Council has done nothing to rebut it, for which you have a unique opportunity right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8973.763s">The</a>  fact also presents itself with the issue that with this new combined water and sewer allowance, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8981.519s">Why</a>  would you be reducing your water rate by 3% and now coming in and want to put a brand new tax on each and every other month, bimonthly, six times a year, ad infinitum, on Medford taxpayers, knowing that you have a surplus in excess of $8 million and you have a deficit in the sewer account <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9003.965s">for</a>  this 2018 year of $300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9006.266s">That</a>  does not make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9010.307s">And</a>  the reason why it makes no sense is you will continuously keep going with a profit that you have, and your water and sewer count, and you have nothing presented before you as of the meeting that we had a month ago and as of tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9021.69s">Any</a>  major road construction, any major sidewalk construction, any street construction.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9028.112s">We</a>  had a meeting on this a month ago, same similar subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9030.473s">We</a>  had a committee of the whole on this as well, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9033.502s">OK,</a>  I thought there was something in the rules about bringing something up that was already discussed within the last 90 days, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9038.663s">It</a>  was similar, same subject matter.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9040.883s">The</a>  fact of the matter is, Mr. President, the connectivity tax that's going to be charged to the ratepayers.</p>

    <p>[Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9051.245s">I</a>  have no recollection of the council proposing or issuing a tax on the people of Medford on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9063.003s">Remember</a>  that we've discussed in the past 30 days a fee that has been initiated by the Water and Sewer Commission.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9072.086s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9134.068s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice Presidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9137.03s">Vice</a>  President, sorry, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9139.051s">I</a>  just feel as though sometimes accurate representation of the facts is important when we're here in the public forum.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9143.715s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Inouye. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9145.295s">Councilor</a>  Longo-Kurin.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9146.936s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9147.456s">If</a>  you don't agree with the person at the podium, but maybe save our comments till after. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9152.576s">I</a>  feel like it's almost verging on harassment.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9155.497s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Longo-Kurin. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9157.097s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9157.737s">Please</a>  continue.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9159.838s">I'm</a>  glad you apologized on behalf of the council, because most recently, everybody got in their water and sewer bills <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9174.068s">a</a>  letter that indicated that they were going to be getting a new processing baseline rate, which I will call a tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9182.058s">It's</a>  a new tax implemented on the citizens of this community on their water and sewer bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9187.445s">It's</a>  called a connectivity fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9190.017s">And</a>  you're going to be paying for that each and every other month, six times a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9195.439s">Every</a>  taxpayer that owns their home owns from their house to the middle of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9200.381s">That's</a>  their pipe. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9201.822s">That's</a>  what they're responsible for, and that's what they pay for. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9205.043s">They</a>  make that connection already into the city's water and sewer line. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9208.925s">The</a>  city is already charging you for water and sewer coming into your house through your pipe, through the connection. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9215.548s">Now,</a>  the argument that's being used by the Water and Sewer Commission is <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9219.329s">We</a>  need to put this money aside, which is approximately $1 million a year, according to the type and size of your pipe coming into your house, connected to the street, to offset any future costs that might put the city in a negative position. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9236.053s">My</a>  argument before this honorable body, I hope most of you can accept that word, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9242.984s">Honorable,</a>  is the fact that the water and sewer account that we have right now is an $8.5 million surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9252.155s">You've</a>  merged, within the past two months, the water and sewer accounts of the Enterprise as to be one. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9258.823s">If</a>  you are alleging, as the Water and Sewer Commission is alleging, there was a $300,000 deficit in the sewer account, but at the same time you're proposing a 3% reduction in the water rate for next year, the irony to that does not make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9275.631s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9276.352s">Because</a>  you have an $8 million surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9278.633s">You</a>  have them both now merged together. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9280.674s">And</a>  the law allows you to take a surplus from one to offset the negative of another or vice versa. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9287.077s">The</a>  other thing that this Water and Soil Commission has failed to do, it's under a 360 CMR 1100. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9294.762s">It's</a>  a continuation of contract water supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9298.465s">And</a>  this came out in 1994. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9299.285s">And</a>  it states the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9301.947s">You</a>  incorporate a uniform rate or an alternative structure which provides incentives for water conservation and or is designed to ensure the affordability of water service to low and or fixed income people. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9317.117s">You</a>  don't have that at the present time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9319.76s">That's</a>  never been brought up before the Water and Soil Commission to give that particular rate out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9324.704s">You</a>  don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9326.485s">But</a>  if you're even going to get into the idea of the thought process of wanting to get into this, how do you justify the rates that are being proposed by the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9335.914s">The</a>  rates being proposed by the city range anywhere from <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9341.055s">A</a>  residential house up to 3 quarters of an inch would be $51.66 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9347.142s">Now,</a>  you may say it's only $51. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9349.125s">But</a>  you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9351.387s">$51</a>  to some people is a lot of money, especially if you want a fixed income. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9355.272s">And</a>  if you have a one-inch line coming into your house, it's $141 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9360.658s">Take</a>  that and add it on to the CPA tax, for which you're not even going to get reimbursed by the state on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9366.241s">That</a>  is another $50, $60 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9368.281s">And</a>  now you're almost up to over $150, $200 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9372.023s">Your</a>  taxes each and every year continuously keep going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9375.064s">It's</a>  absolutely unfair for the city to even entertain or engage itself in a connectivity fee tax every other month when you're sitting on that kind of a profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9385.749s">Now,</a>  if you want to be realistic and look at this thing and say, OK, maybe we should do like some other cities and towns, the community of Melrose, your sister next door, they have a one-time fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9397.352s">And</a>  it's at the discretion of the director of public works. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9400.553s">It's</a>  a one-time fee of $50. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9403.073s">And</a>  if you're building a new house and it's a first-time connection, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9406.734s">If</a>  you're rebuilding your house and you have to make a reconnection, that reconnection is either $50 and or at the discretion <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9414.753s">of</a>  the Director of Public Works, because if you're the same owner, it could be abated. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9418.623s">It</a>  just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9423.246s">It</a>  doesn't make any sense because you, as the Medford City Council, are supposed to be looking out for the best financial interests of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9432.07s">And</a>  the only way you can seem to do it right now, at least through the majority of you, if you so choose, is you just hold this budget in abeyance until the mayor comes forward and indicates how can you keep going out and making these charges against Medford taxpayers and ratepayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9450.757s">Let's</a>  flip over to the second part, to the hotel. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9454.34s">You</a>  have a hotel proposal that you haven't even sat down, hasn't even been discussed, and there the mayor of this community in the State of the City address in February says this is going to be up and running by the fall of 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9469.977s">You</a>  haven't had a discussion either with the contractor who's only been around since 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9476.16s">You</a>  don't even know what the taxes is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9479.221s">And</a>  the best part about this hotel, you need city and state land to be taken to accommodate the parking that's necessary for this proposed hotel. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9487.624s">Here's</a>  your time to discuss it during the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9490.886s">And</a>  if you don't discuss it, why give the vote out? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9494.487s">It</a>  doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9496.741s">It's</a>  unfortunate under this form of government that this mayor who said she was going to be transparent and would have someone here each and every week to listen and to discuss these issues, there's nobody here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9507.723s">You're</a>  lucky if that person's been here twice in the two years that it's been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9512.144s">And</a>  what doesn't make sense is how can you go back and keep telling Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer that this is only a small little dollar amount, especially when you're dealing with a surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9523.086s">You've</a>  got $9 million in your free cash or thereabouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9526.892s">But</a>  nobody around here has discussed your $29 million in an unfunded liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9533.258s">How</a>  are you going to address that? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9534.9s">And</a>  is this new connectivity charge going to be able to be used to offset salaries and wages of employees in that department, pension system funds? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9544.97s">These</a>  are the questions you need to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9547.232s">And</a>  the low and moderate income, fixed income people don't even have a break on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9552.242s">So</a>  while you think you're making the taxpayer feel good because you're lowering his water rate by 3%, you're charging him in excess of the 3% by having a bimonthly, six times a year, new tax being placed upon him. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9569.271s">And</a>  the line that should really get you in every single ratepayer is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9573.513s">It</a>  says the base rate is not a tax, nor is it an additional charge in which residents pay for water and sewer services. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9581.059s">Well,</a>  you tell me what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9583.101s">You</a>  tell me, Mr. President, what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9585.223s">If</a>  it's not a tax, okay, if it's not a fee, and if it's not for water and sewer services, well, why am I paying a connectivity fee to let that water go through that pipe that comes into the pipe that I own, that comes into my house, that you charge me water and sewer taxes on? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9601.263s">I</a>  respectfully ask this Medford City Council to ask this mayor, you hold up this question and remove this connectivity fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9609.29s">It's</a>  an unfair tax, it's unnecessary, and it does not do good for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9616.156s">I'm</a>  more than happy to answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9618.238s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9622.101s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9623.562s">I'll</a>  ask you a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9625.203s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9627.686s">You</a>  had said the council should rebut the tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9630.631s">Now,</a>  I guess we went public, I think it was under Council Max's resolution, with regards to some of us not being happy about this fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9641.479s">How</a>  can we rebut it? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9642.32s">I</a>  mean, it was voted on by the Water and Sewer.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9645.443s">How</a>  you would rebut it is you would tell the mayor that we're not voting for your budget until you tell the Water and Sewer commissioners to roll back that fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9654.29s">You</a>  justify $8.5 million sitting there and justify telling the taxpayers you're going to generate another million dollars plus a year with this connectivity fee, and you don't even have a program set aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9667.262s">Look</a>  at every street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9668.383s">Look</a>  at all the streets that are waiting to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9670.585s">Look</a>  at the potholes that can't get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9672.527s">Look</a>  at Evans Street that's been promised for almost two years they were going to get done when the water main broke. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9678.032s">We</a>  could just go on and on and on with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9680.434s">You</a>  can't keep charging the taxpayers of this community for something, especially when you're sitting on millions of dollars in a surplus in this particular account.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9690.362s">I</a>  voiced my concern at the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9692.323s">I'm</a>  very concerned about how this plays out in the years to come, but the way it was explained to us this year is that the rate was being reduced, this fee was being implemented, and we were raising enough just to cover what we owe MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9706.887s">There</a>  was going to be no excess revenue taken in from <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9712.233s">the</a>  rates and the fee?</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9714.735s">We're</a>  reducing the water rate, Madam Chairperson, we're reducing the water rate by 3%. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9720.52s">So</a>  if you have a $24 million cost, whatever it is, I think that's what you said, Mr. President, for the cost of coming in this year, and inclusive of that cost is water and sewer charges, because it's coming in, and we all know that your sewer charge is at 121% of your water. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9734.975s">So</a>  if the city already knows that they're going to be operating at a $300,000 loss, why wouldn't you just take the money from your $8.5 million profit rather than go out and tell the people we're going to charge you for a connectivity fee and have the audacity to put in a letter that's got nothing to do with water and sewer services? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9753.321s">What</a>  do you think, people are stupid? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9755.785s">I'm</a>  not stupid. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9757.245s">You</a>  know, I love this city, and I'll do anything to make it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9760.627s">But</a>  when I see stuff like this, this really gets to me, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9764.248s">And</a>  it should get to every one of you members of the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9767.209s">Because</a>  it's not right, it's not fair, and you can't even take care of people on fixed incomes, you know, allowing you to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9774.631s">You</a>  haven't even discussed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9775.891s">Where's</a>  the Water and Soil Commissioner on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9781.035s">Didn't</a>  mean TL, Mr. President, but you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9783.516s">When</a>  you sit here all night and you watch what's going on here and you're being played to wait till the end of the night, I get upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9790.337s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9791.298s">But</a>  every dog has its day. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9792.478s">Remember</a>  that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9793.658s">There's</a>  an election coming up and I hope people remember that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9796.579s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

letter and I called the city to inquire, to get more explanation because it was very unclear what that was all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9830.212s">And</a>  they told me there was, um, a meeting that evening, which I did attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9833.974s">I</a>  went on your website there, your meetings for this evening, the council meetings, everything is posted, but you're at the water and sewer commission meetings and I'm not posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9844.939s">From</a>  my understanding from the city is that the Water and Sewer Commission is their own independent body. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9853.891s">They</a>  pretty much, no one answers, they don't really answer to anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9858.858s">They</a>  are not elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9860.876s">There</a>  is no transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9863.538s">There</a>  is no communication to the public to be able to go to these meetings and voice your opinion and ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9871.724s">I</a>  happen to have had gone to this meeting, inquired about this specific agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9878.849s">And</a>  the information that I was told by the chair of the Water School, and there's actually the gentleman from the state, the Department of Water and Sewer from Massachusetts, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9888.519s">So</a>  it's not, I was told at the meeting, it was not a connectivity fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9893.221s">It's</a>  a fee to read the meter and to send out the bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9900.343s">This</a>  is exactly how Dominic explained it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9906.185s">So</a>  $8.61 per meter, and it's so that the bill can be generated, the meter's read. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9913.328s">And</a>  as the gentleman prior to myself, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9916.397s">noted</a>  that they will also be lowering the rates of the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9922.484s">I</a>  expressed my concerns for various reasons, and I have a document that I provide to all the members of the commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9929.773s">One,</a>  the meter is per meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9934.398s">So</a>  if you have, it's not, first of all, it was not fairly, in my opinion, not fairly implemented in the sense that there are homes that have a meter for their home for your water and sewer in your house, and then you have a meter for your landscaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9952.428s">If</a>  this fee was going to be implemented, it should be two times. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9956.05s">They</a>  say no, because it's just one. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9958.331s">So</a>  if you have a three-family home, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9961.94s">There's</a>  one meter coming into a home. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9964.041s">You're</a>  only charged that $8.61 for the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9966.463s">We're</a>  a single-family home. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9970.518s">is</a>  charged the same amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9973.04s">I</a>  question why they're raising the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9975.282s">They</a>  said it's to ensure a minimum, I believe it's $1 to $2 million a year of guaranteed revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9982.787s">And</a>  that revenue was supposedly to help pay for infrastructure in the city, for their sewers that needs to be repaired in the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9991.134s">And</a>  I get all that, the reason for raising, that you need to generate revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9996.838s">But</a>  to charge to lower rates, and then at the cost of adding more, the cost to other people unfairly, it just wasn't clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10011.807s">And</a>  I questioned the decision, how they came up with this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10016.951s">And</a>  the bottom line was, the answer I got was unclear. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10019.692s">And</a>  basically, this is what we thought, and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10021.653s">And</a>  there was absolutely no discussion, input from anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10026.05s">in</a>  absolute denial to reconsider the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10029.754s">And</a>  I requested that it be reviewed and that people have the opportunity to propose a more fairer way if they need to generate revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10042.466s">But</a>  if the purpose is to generate revenue, why are you lowering the water rates? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10051.225s">How</a>  do you justify—so you're lowering—someone's going to benefit, and someone's going to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10055.468s">You're</a>  just shifting the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10057.309s">That's</a>  all this was all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10058.73s">And</a>  I don't want to get into it here right now, but in a different forum, if you had to sit there and ask the Board of Supervisors to provide an explanation, all it's going to do is shift funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10070.919s">The</a>  revenue you're getting from certain people will benefit, and others will pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10076.829s">will</a>  be paying more for the, you know, it's you're offsetting costs unfairly. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10081.951s">And</a>  I don't know what the, why that is and where they came up with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10085.492s">But,</a>  um, and I feel that is the city council should be questioning this in the purpose of the water and sewer commission in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10094.934s">Their,</a>  their meeting should be transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10097.162s">They</a>  should be held accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10098.423s">It</a>  should be open to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10100.285s">They</a>  should not be able to make decisions on their own without being responding to, I think, at least this committee here.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10106.151s">Their</a>  meetings are publicized and open to the public.</p>

    <p>[DeFabritas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10108.934s">It</a>  was not on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10111.096s">It</a>  was not. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10112.298s">And</a>  like I said, I was the only one there.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10114.9s">But</a>  they usually are posted and they are open to the public.</p>

    <p>[DeFabritas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10119.932s">I</a>  know it was open to the public, but it was not posted.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10122.494s">I</a>  don't know if it was posted, but it should be posted.</p>

    <p>[DeFabritas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10124.195s">Yeah,</a>  it did call and it was not posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10126.537s">But</a>  I mean, anyway, so that was, that's just my comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10129.839s">I</a>  just, I, again, I don't know how that commission is elected or who appoints them.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10134.303s">They're</a>  appointed by the mayor.</p>

    <p>[DeFabritas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10135.684s">By</a>  the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10136.344s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10138.506s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10140.632s">I</a>  think there should be, you know, in any public office, sometimes you need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10144.054s">Uh,</a>  there should be a tenor, uh, you know, a limited years that people stay in a position or at least shifted around and move the people up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10152.299s">Uh,</a>  because I think sometimes what happens with people in positions for too many years, uh, they think they can, you know, make decisions on their own without feeling consultant, uh, public opinion and getting the input of others. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10163.705s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10164.205s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10167.607s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Caputi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10169.448s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10170.993s">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10171.413s">I'm</a>  Rob Caputi of 71 Evans street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10173.795s">I</a>  want to thank Mr. Penta for bringing, bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10180.221s">I</a>  just want to say, I mean, I, this is a very important issue to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10186.426s">Uh,</a>  what, what's actually going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10190.026s">with</a>  this tax and all the other taxes is the businesses and residents, they're not going to pay it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10195.429s">They're</a>  going to pass these costs along to people that rent, to people that buy goods and services. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10201.732s">You</a>  know, I've been sitting in these subcommittee meetings that this honorable body has been having on the budget and, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10210.186s">To</a>  see an issue like this come, and then to hear different department heads, like the chief of police talking about he asked for five new police officers, and that was denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10221.194s">And</a>  it's explained off that they're going to be hiring civil dispatchers, and that will bring in more police. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10231.903s">But</a>  in actuality, that's not really going to bring in more police. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10235.846s">I</a>  mean, it's just very confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10238.988s">and</a>  frustrating to the citizens who are seeing things like My Street, Evans Street, and all the infrastructure repairs that are needed across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10248.791s">To</a>  see other ways of bringing money into the city, rather than direct tax or new connectivity fees, to look at the budget that's being proposed here, to see only $97,000, I think the figure is, for the Chevalier Theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10265.404s">that</a>  could be bringing in so much more money, an increase to the investment, to that treasure of a theater, where we could actually bring in enough money <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10281.055s">by</a>  bringing in bigger names with more investment to that almost 2,000 seat theater to see the increase in sales and whatnot to our downtown business district that's being crippled by the Craddock Bridge repair, and then use that money to actually really reduce water rates and property rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10301.414s">and</a>  so many other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10305.039s">$1,200,000</a>  taken in by the Community Preservation Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10310.665s">To</a>  see that when we know we have surpluses in other areas, I mean, to me that's money taken out of the economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10318.615s">It's</a>  going away from <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10320.0s">from</a>  people being able to pay a better rent in Medford or a better mortgage or better prices for goods and services. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10330.108s">I</a>  think Mr. Penter is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10332.13s">I</a>  think this body should stand up on this and sit down with the mayor in these subcommittee meetings that I've been going to. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10341.938s">Sometimes</a>  department heads coming without full facts on each decimal point. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10349.133s">Sometimes</a>  department heads might even be in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10351.554s">Sometimes</a>  the Hormel commission department wasn't there on, on Saturday morning, I believe it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10358.778s">And</a>  then wondering why, why is there a Hormel commission in a, in a park commission? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10364.12s">Why,</a>  why isn't that one, one, one commission? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10369.303s">Yeah,</a>  I am wondering about that.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10372.421s">With</a>  the land transfer, when the city accepted ownership of Hormel Stadium, the establishment of the Hormel Commission was statutory and is required by state law.</p>

    <p>[Caputi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10382.147s">Well,</a>  I guess that explains that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10384.668s">But</a>  why can't, through maybe Hormel petition, we combine the two, like we've done in other things, like Councilor Marks brought up on Saturday morning at the subcommittee meeting, different ways that this body has brought other <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10402.56s">like</a>  the Traffic Commission, I think it was, and the Off-Street Parking Commission into one. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10407.563s">That's</a>  what I'm hoping to see more of when I go to these subcommittee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10410.885s">Streamlining</a>  government, making it smaller, more responsible, more effective, more transparent and accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10417.566s">uh,</a>  to see all these dollar amounts too, that are coming in for 450,000 that was budgeted for 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10426.393s">They</a>  only spent 420. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10427.334s">Well,</a>  what happens to that other 30,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10429.636s">Oh,</a>  it just gets rolled over into the general fund and not being applied to next year's spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10439.244s">I'm</a>  sorry, Mr. President is, uh, continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10443.214s">Is</a>  there a point of information to be made? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10445.114s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10446.735s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10449.195s">I</a>  just want to say that, you know, I mean, you guys are very smart and intelligent people. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10455.376s">You</a>  see what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10458.097s">$167</a>  million being proposed to spend this year, but not in areas where we could actually bring in more money and provide better rates on all sorts of taxes to the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10468.738s">It's</a>  a shame and it's disconcerting, and I hope <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10473.174s">that</a>  the public is watching during this election year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10476.577s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10478.498s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10481.721s">May</a>  I have an address to the record, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10483.983s">Andrew</a>  Cushion Street and Abbott Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10487.165s">It's</a>  the same location today, June 13th, 2017, that the big city neglected infested tree had fallen down an hour and a half ago all around my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10502.338s">Again,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10503.459s">I</a>  hate to repeat myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10505.38s">I've</a>  said it before. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10506.08s">I'm</a>  not that smart. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10507.36s">I</a>  went to BU once. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10508.481s">It</a>  was closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10509.681s">I'm</a>  not going back either. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10511.181s">I'm</a>  just not going to go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10512.342s">I'm</a>  not going to go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10514.863s">However,</a>  on this connectivity fee, I like to call it, we're already connected to the grid of H2O and the storage going out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10527.326s">So</a>  I kind of understand how you'd want to charge for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10532.816s">unless</a>  you're doing a new Marauder development, and you're putting new pipes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10537.017s">That</a>  makes sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10538.517s">You</a>  might even charge $1,000, whatever it costs, depending on what the contractor's going to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10543.558s">And</a>  as far as the shake, whatever they call that, that fee that they try to charge contractors at times if they want to develop. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10553.58s">I'm</a>  thinking out loud, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10556.641s">I'm</a>  wondering if the connectivity fee is a way to generate a base <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10564.853s">such</a>  as when Representative Congressman Markey, I believe, an example, next door in Malden, I believe, lived in Malden, he said, when he was a congressman. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10576.737s">And</a>  I'm not sure if that water meter was running when he supposedly lived there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10584.299s">And</a>  so now Senator Markey, I guess, would still get a connectivity fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10594.167s">a</a>  base rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10596.728s">I</a>  don't use any gas or my electric on the second floor because I have an empty apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10603.011s">So</a>  the bill should be zero, you would think, but it is not zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10607.134s">There</a>  is some sort of basic charge on the electric and, as Pinto would say, the other conglomerate for the gas. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10618.639s">With</a>  $8.5 million of overcharged money out of our ratepayers' money <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10624.366s">Water</a>  bills, you know, it's like 1,200 bucks a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10628.568s">On</a>  an average, I'm guesstimating. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10632.45s">Why</a>  do you want to shake down the lower middle class especially? <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10635.611s">Give</a>  us a break, please.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10638.332s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10638.712s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10641.994s">Jean</a>  Nuzzo, 35 Parrish Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10644.835s">So</a>  having listened tonight, I was unable to attend the last meeting where this topic was discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10650.317s">So</a>  I'm happy to hear it again and become more familiar with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10655.665s">As</a>  I sit here and I ponder this, I think about the fact that there are many people who live in the city of Medford that work two jobs to be able to afford the homes they have, and they're strapped, and things are tight for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10669.874s">And</a>  I think of our elderly community, which is a high number of people in the city of Medford, more than some other cities, and how they might be on fixed incomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10680.29s">and</a>  others who maybe use water less as a method to help save money. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10685.991s">And</a>  it's decisions like these, $60 for water connectivity, $100 some odd for CPA, it's really death by paper cut for these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10697.713s">It's</a>  incremental and repetitive and it cuts deeply over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10703.154s">And</a>  it's decisions and choices like this that create a tipping point that force these people out of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10709.952s">and</a>  make them move someplace else, a city that has historically been made up of people who are hardworking individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10717.894s">And</a>  it troubles me greatly that I continue to see this gentrification going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10722.796s">And</a>  I really would urge you to consider maybe some type of tiered approach, especially for those folks who maybe are just making ends meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10732.558s">Because</a>  some of us can handle it, but there are others in our community that cannot. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10739.172s">So,</a>  I just would like to raise that point because it makes them vulnerable, it makes them vulnerable to the loss of their property, and it makes them vulnerable to opportunistic developers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10750.402s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10751.023s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10753.125s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10754.906s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10757.406s">My</a>  experiences with the members of the Water and Sewer Commission have been nothing but positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10761.209s">I</a>  think that they're a great group of individuals, and if given the opportunity to explain themselves and explain the connectivity, if you will do so in a fashion that will make people a little bit more understanding of their implementation and their reasoning behind it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10772.557s">With</a>  that being said, Mr. President, on the community calendar this evening, it's posted that the next Water and Sewer Commission meeting is on 6-28 at 5 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10781.383s">in</a>  the council chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10782.894s">So</a>  those individuals that do have questions that concerns about the connectivity feel the baseline charges as it's called can appear and before the Commission And take those issues up that evening.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10791.317s">It's</a>  going to be in this room and it's my understanding it may be televised, but I'm not sure Thank you for that information councillor night Motion to receive and place on file seconded by councillor night all in favor motion passes <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10811.986s">Records</a>  of the meeting of June 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10816.129s">Vice</a>  President Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10818.431s">Before</a>  you read the records, this past Thursday, we had a groundbreaking in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10825.697s">Myself,</a>  Council President Caraviello, and Councilor Lungo-Koehn were present. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10831.562s">We</a>  had a groundbreaking, Mr. President, for the first ever dog park in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10838.508s">And</a>  I want to personally thank Mr. President <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10842.168s">uh,</a>  the pause for method group. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10844.489s">Uh,</a>  here was a group of five or six citizens that had a common cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10850.131s">Uh,</a>  one night, two and a half years ago, they got together, um, and decided that, um, it would be nice to have a full fledged dog park in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10860.955s">One</a>  in which dogs can exercise, socialize, and they felt there was a need, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10866.837s">They</a>  never once approached the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10870.319s">They</a>  went out on their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10871.86s">They</a>  found $250,000 in grant money from the Stanton Foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10878.763s">They</a>  went out on their own, Mr. President, and found a consultant that does dog park design and design parks in Somerville and Arlington and met with this particular consultant and started the ball rolling, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10894.572s">And,</a>  uh, this past Thursday after two and a half years of, uh, fundraising, dog washes, uh, the method day where they had raffle prizes and, uh, come and bring your dog to a picnic and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10908.76s">Um,</a>  I'm proud to say, Mr. President, as part of, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10911.548s">uh,</a>  pause for method that, uh, we will have a full fledged, uh, park in our community, one with a small dog and large dogs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10921.61s">Um,</a>  it will have a full irrigation system, lighting, uh, exercise and obstacle course for the, uh, animals. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10930.292s">And,</a>  um, again, this is truly, uh, uh, you know, uh, when people say, oh, you can't fight city hall, you can't get things done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10938.646s">This</a>  was truly a groundswell of just residents getting together and moving a very important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10945.049s">I</a>  believe last year, Mr. Clerk, correct me if I'm wrong, we licensed about 350 dogs, about 400 dogs in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10954.072s">We</a>  estimate through doing some of our own homework that there's over 7,000 dogs that reside in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10965.157s">So</a>  there's a need for the park, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10967.879s">And</a>  I want to thank the committee members, Jim Silva, Patty Flynn, Gary DiStefano, Diane Gittner, and John Sidon, who, like I said, spent countless hours, still spending countless hours, in putting this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10984.006s">I</a>  want to thank the McGlynn administration, who actually heard about it and got interested and saw that this group was a working group and wanted to accomplish something. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=10995.01s">and</a>  came on board, and then Mayor Burke followed through on her end, Mr. President, along with Delicia Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=11001.952s">So</a>  I just want to thank this group of citizens, and I'm proud that we will have our first park. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=11010.035s">It's</a>  going to be located in between the Andrews and the McGlynn School along Riverbend Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=11017.397s">And</a>  as I said, it's going to be a state-of-the-art park and something I think we can all be proud of.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=11022.639s">Thank</a>  you, and you should be commended for being up front of this a couple of years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=11027.721s">And</a>  we thank you for your hard work also, Mr. Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=11031.342s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>
