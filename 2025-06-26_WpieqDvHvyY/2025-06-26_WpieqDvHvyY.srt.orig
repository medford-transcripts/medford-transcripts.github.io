[SPEAKER_09]: Present.

20
00:01:29,981 --> 00:01:32,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think Kless is here tonight, right?

21
00:01:32,142 --> 00:01:37,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, let me check my notes.

22
00:01:39,624 --> 00:01:42,545
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you're right that he was unable.

23
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,167
[SPEAKER_05]: In the meantime, I'm here, present.

24
00:01:59,063 --> 00:02:00,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I just need one more moment.

25
00:02:04,888 --> 00:02:09,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus did RSVP, so I'm gonna send him a message.

26
00:02:12,574 --> 00:02:14,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we can get started anyway.

27
00:02:14,896 --> 00:02:25,905
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's go to the approval of minutes.

28
00:02:27,927 --> 00:02:35,509
[SPEAKER_06]: We have some minutes from... Are these the ones that we already did?

29
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:37,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that right, Amanda?

30
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,351
[SPEAKER_10]: No, these should be new, I believe.

31
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:46,891
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so previously we did November 18th.

32
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:47,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

33
00:02:48,032 --> 00:02:48,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

34
00:02:49,132 --> 00:02:53,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I was looking at these and they did seem new, but I was just now looking.

35
00:02:54,588 --> 00:02:56,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, that confused me.

36
00:02:56,869 --> 00:03:03,470
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we have the minutes from the December 20th, 2021 board meeting.

37
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:10,612
[SPEAKER_06]: And any comments, edits, revisions, questions by members of the board?

38
00:03:15,293 --> 00:03:19,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing none, is there a motion to approve the minutes of December 20th?

39
00:03:25,483 --> 00:03:26,544
[SPEAKER_01]: Andre, this is Jackie.

40
00:03:26,804 --> 00:03:31,047
[SPEAKER_01]: I present the motion to approve the minutes from December 20th.

41
00:03:32,008 --> 00:03:32,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Jackie.

42
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:33,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a second?

43
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,031
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Deanna, I'll second.

44
00:03:37,152 --> 00:03:37,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Deanna.

45
00:03:38,773 --> 00:03:39,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call vote.

46
00:03:39,694 --> 00:03:40,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it order?

47
00:03:40,874 --> 00:03:41,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Christy Dowd?

48
00:03:41,495 --> 00:03:43,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

49
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:44,857
[SPEAKER_06]: David Blumberg?

50
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:46,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

51
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Deanna Peabody?

52
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:49,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

53
00:03:51,202 --> 00:03:52,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice Chair Furtado?

54
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:53,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

55
00:03:53,183 --> 00:03:55,045
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm an aye as well.

56
00:03:58,984 --> 00:04:00,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Minutes are approved.

57
00:04:01,345 --> 00:04:20,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Next item on the agenda is our continued hearing from last meeting of June 9th, the site plan review recommendations to the Zoning Board of Appeals in regards to 4054 Mystic Valley Parkway.

58
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:23,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Proponent is rise together.

59
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:37,836
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had some questions at that time, we reviewed a lot of the conditions and questions that we had, but there were some engineering issues.

60
00:04:37,956 --> 00:04:43,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that the engineering team weren't available at that time.

61
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,784
[SPEAKER_06]: So now we have, I believe the proponent has their engineers with them.

62
00:04:48,944 --> 00:04:53,067
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also have our municipal engineer as well to help us through this.

63
00:04:54,601 --> 00:05:00,523
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me turn it over to, would that be you, Quinlan?

64
00:05:02,104 --> 00:05:03,045
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep, I'll take it.

65
00:05:03,705 --> 00:05:04,065
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

66
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:09,507
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think either Tim or Mark might be sharing their screen.

67
00:05:09,547 --> 00:05:13,929
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm happy to share my screen too, if either of you don't have it up or available.

68
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:18,091
[SPEAKER_15]: I have it up.

69
00:05:18,171 --> 00:05:18,611
[SPEAKER_05]: I can share it.

70
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:19,111
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Mark.

71
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:20,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.

72
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:21,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Mark.

73
00:05:23,953 --> 00:05:28,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, let me, I got a full screen, there we go.

74
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:36,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to remind the members of the public and our board members participating, there were some questions we had.

75
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:46,606
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I had in particular about the height of the retaining wall around the rear of the property and the effect on the adjacent wetlands and the butters.

76
00:05:47,486 --> 00:05:49,988
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's just the big context for this.

77
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'll leave it in PDF.

78
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:54,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.

79
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:55,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that.

80
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:05,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a quick note that Klaus is trying to join us, but he's having some connection issues.

81
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:11,854
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we can continue to get started, but hopefully he'll pop in shortly.

82
00:06:11,874 --> 00:06:15,375
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me know if you guys can see that.

83
00:06:15,455 --> 00:06:18,676
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you see this?

84
00:06:18,696 --> 00:06:19,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think we're good, Mark.

85
00:06:19,476 --> 00:06:20,897
[SPEAKER_14]: I can see you there.

86
00:06:20,957 --> 00:06:21,177
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, good.

87
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:25,930
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the board.

88
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,171
[SPEAKER_14]: Great to be back here this evening again with the team here.

89
00:06:29,992 --> 00:06:34,013
[SPEAKER_14]: For those of you who might be on the call that haven't met me yet, my name is Quinlan Locke.

90
00:06:34,073 --> 00:06:40,055
[SPEAKER_14]: I am the project manager with Rise Together, working on 4054 Mystic Valley Parkway.

91
00:06:40,655 --> 00:06:44,196
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the third time we've been to the Community Development Board.

92
00:06:44,256 --> 00:06:47,638
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot's been discussed, and we look forward to

93
00:06:49,195 --> 00:06:52,938
[SPEAKER_14]: discussing some of those retaining wall issues that the chair mentioned earlier.

94
00:06:53,558 --> 00:06:54,759
[SPEAKER_14]: If you can go to the next slide, Mark.

95
00:06:57,881 --> 00:07:06,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Just again, a quick recap on some of the project team here, just focusing on tonight's topic on the retaining wall.

96
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:12,712
[SPEAKER_14]: Mostly you'll be hearing from our VHB civil team who's on the call tonight, as well as MDLA landscape.

97
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:16,555
[SPEAKER_14]: They'll be on the call answering any questions at the end of the call as well.

98
00:07:17,591 --> 00:07:23,835
[SPEAKER_14]: And with that, we have some members of the rest of our team here as well, if there are any other questions after that.

99
00:07:24,636 --> 00:07:29,519
[SPEAKER_14]: Next slide, please.

100
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:31,660
[SPEAKER_14]: So the last time we were here is about two weeks ago.

101
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:45,449
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a great conversation about some of the items from the first hearing, but there was one particular item that I think the board wanted some more information on, which is really the civil design, especially with the retaining wall around the property.

102
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:48,216
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, you know, what, what is the retaining wall?

103
00:07:48,256 --> 00:07:48,957
[SPEAKER_14]: How does it work?

104
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:49,717
[SPEAKER_14]: Why is it needed?

105
00:07:50,238 --> 00:07:57,724
[SPEAKER_14]: All questions that, um, we, we had a meeting with a few, few members that are on the call tonight, uh, last week.

106
00:07:58,265 --> 00:08:02,929
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, and Owen Bortala and a few other members of the city were on the call last week.

107
00:08:02,989 --> 00:08:08,934
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a great conversation on just what the retaining wall is and what it means to the property as well.

108
00:08:08,994 --> 00:08:09,114
[SPEAKER_14]: So.

109
00:08:09,976 --> 00:08:11,977
[SPEAKER_14]: Looking forward to getting right into that tonight.

110
00:08:13,297 --> 00:08:22,319
[SPEAKER_14]: If there aren't any questions on that, I'm happy to turn it right over to Mark Jones to go over, who's on our DHB civil team, to go over the retaining wall itself.

111
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:23,599
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

112
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,660
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, that would be me.

113
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,320
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm up.

114
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,921
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, Mark Younghens with DHB.

115
00:08:30,521 --> 00:08:33,482
[SPEAKER_15]: We're the civil designers for this project.

116
00:08:33,502 --> 00:08:35,042
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm with Tim Smith, who's here.

117
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:49,567
[SPEAKER_15]: who's working through the nuts and the bolts, and then Stephanie Krul, who's on our team as well, whose understanding of the resiliency conditions here is also a big part of the design that we've developed.

118
00:08:51,128 --> 00:09:00,332
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's important to know that this building, its first control was really Mystic Valley Parkway, of course.

119
00:09:00,913 --> 00:09:03,554
[SPEAKER_15]: That's where the building front door is.

120
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:10,750
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is the place where we want to make sure that we have an accessible entrance from Mystic Valley Parkway.

121
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,511
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's really where we began when we began to set this building.

122
00:09:14,532 --> 00:09:18,534
[SPEAKER_15]: The width of the building is really established by its use as a lab building.

123
00:09:19,054 --> 00:09:24,977
[SPEAKER_15]: It's 140 feet wide, which is pretty close to a lab requirement.

124
00:09:25,017 --> 00:09:27,858
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes they'd like to be a little wider, but this is what the site would allow.

125
00:09:34,485 --> 00:09:46,628
[SPEAKER_15]: The building has a 20-foot driveway around the building, which is designed to allow fire apparatus to circulate around the building without any issues.

126
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,769
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a one-way circulation.

127
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:53,710
[SPEAKER_15]: These arrows are actually flow arrows, but not directional arrows.

128
00:09:53,810 --> 00:10:01,532
[SPEAKER_15]: That was, once again, the base case, if you would, everything we needed to make sure this building was accessible and safe.

129
00:10:02,188 --> 00:10:10,533
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the service area right here off the one-way drive, trucks come in and they back in, they get off the driveway, and then the parking entrance is over in this corner.

130
00:10:12,135 --> 00:10:15,877
[SPEAKER_15]: The elevation of the building is driven by a number of factors.

131
00:10:15,937 --> 00:10:25,123
[SPEAKER_15]: First off, it's that, how can we have, this is a nice plaza, we can see it later on the landscape drawings, but we need an accessible route from here to here.

132
00:10:25,563 --> 00:10:30,927
[SPEAKER_15]: And because this is a plaza, the way ADA determines its,

133
00:10:32,606 --> 00:10:38,127
[SPEAKER_15]: Acceptability is it needs to be ADA accessible in every direction, not just in one direction that you're walking.

134
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:41,168
[SPEAKER_15]: So that kind of drives what we can do on this plaza.

135
00:10:43,088 --> 00:10:56,091
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we come from the street, which is about elevation nine existing, and come up as fast as we can, we get up to elevation 11.35 for our finished floor.

136
00:10:56,111 --> 00:11:01,112
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was sort of our starting point where we looked at, okay, so how does this work with the surrounding

137
00:11:02,075 --> 00:11:05,296
[SPEAKER_15]: site and what do we need to do to carry this forward.

138
00:11:05,976 --> 00:11:08,497
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, if you went out there today, there's the Bertucci's.

139
00:11:09,438 --> 00:11:10,158
[SPEAKER_15]: Love Bertucci's.

140
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:21,802
[SPEAKER_15]: And this parking lot, which is actually the impervious area before and after are surprisingly similar between the two, the existing and the proposed condition.

141
00:11:22,622 --> 00:11:31,105
[SPEAKER_15]: But if you went out there today, you'd find that from this point right at the frontage all the way to the back of the site, it's kind of an even slope all the way back.

142
00:11:31,713 --> 00:11:35,795
[SPEAKER_15]: to the back edge of the site, and then it drops off to where the wetlands are.

143
00:11:35,855 --> 00:11:39,617
[SPEAKER_15]: This heavy line right here is the wetland flagging line.

144
00:11:40,818 --> 00:11:43,819
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's generally sloped from front to back.

145
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,842
[SPEAKER_15]: There are no drainage system components on this site.

146
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:49,962
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything is sheet flow.

147
00:11:49,982 --> 00:11:51,663
[SPEAKER_15]: There's nothing there to catch sediment.

148
00:11:51,703 --> 00:11:56,065
[SPEAKER_15]: There's nothing there to control oils that might come out of cars.

149
00:11:56,126 --> 00:12:00,808
[SPEAKER_15]: There is nothing there to control the peak flow coming off the site and into the wetland.

150
00:12:01,628 --> 00:12:10,872
[SPEAKER_15]: everything that goes from this site except for a small strip out front flows to this wetland and which extends back, back this way.

151
00:12:11,952 --> 00:12:25,217
[SPEAKER_15]: So and the generally the design that we're required to follow is that your proposed site has to match the existing drainage conditions so that the water that is feeding that wetland continues to feed that wetland in the end condition.

152
00:12:26,117 --> 00:12:27,458
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have to provide

153
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:40,169
[SPEAKER_15]: components that improve the water quality over the existing condition, manage the sediments, manage the oils, and also provide a level of treatment.

154
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:54,212
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we came up with was we had to have some vertical to allow us to manage the, let's go, okay, we'll go with this one, to manage the site drainage.

155
00:12:55,032 --> 00:12:56,052
[SPEAKER_15]: This section here,

156
00:12:57,012 --> 00:12:58,053
[SPEAKER_15]: Is the section taken?

157
00:12:58,073 --> 00:13:04,118
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's, okay, I'm sorry, this keeps grabbing me.

158
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:13,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, my ability to negotiate Adobe is a little challenge.

159
00:13:13,945 --> 00:13:18,529
[SPEAKER_15]: This green shape here is a big tank.

160
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,073
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a tank designed to mitigate the peak slope from this site.

161
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:25,855
[SPEAKER_15]: All the drainage that comes off the roof or the parking lot,

162
00:13:26,553 --> 00:13:36,920
[SPEAKER_15]: gets routed through this chamber and if you can imagine it's like a bathtub with a hole at the bottom you can fill it up as fast as you want but the water comes out that hole at a reasonably consistent rate.

163
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:47,987
[SPEAKER_15]: This way we can manage the site stormwater to match the existing conditions or be less than the existing conditions what which is generally what the design requirement is.

164
00:13:49,268 --> 00:13:53,271
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a section through here where you can see that this is our

165
00:13:54,259 --> 00:14:04,425
[SPEAKER_15]: holding chamber and we had to fill the site just so we could capture the drainage and catch basins along the side of the site and direct it to this chamber.

166
00:14:05,046 --> 00:14:11,550
[SPEAKER_15]: This chamber fills up and then this chamber discharges to another chamber, which is just off the page.

167
00:14:13,328 --> 00:14:15,770
[SPEAKER_15]: right here, which provides treatment.

168
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:23,696
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's a cartridge system we have, once again, which sort of polishes the stormwater to make sure it's the best quality that we can have before it goes into the wetland.

169
00:14:24,037 --> 00:14:26,799
[SPEAKER_15]: So it has a positive effect on the wetland.

170
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,142
[SPEAKER_15]: So a lot of this, this is the existing grade down here.

171
00:14:30,362 --> 00:14:36,847
[SPEAKER_15]: Once again, it slopes back down to about elevation four at the back of the site from elevation nine at the front of the site.

172
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,310
[SPEAKER_15]: And this fill here, which is

173
00:14:42,727 --> 00:15:03,772
[SPEAKER_15]: covering over our tank we have enough cover over our tank to have our dry vial we need at least a pavement box here works just works for our drainage system providing us with the vertical we need to make this thing work the even the polishing chamber has I believe it's four inches of vertical it needs to get it through the system and Tim will

174
00:15:07,762 --> 00:15:10,024
[SPEAKER_15]: And so this is sort of our beginning point.

175
00:15:10,184 --> 00:15:16,310
[SPEAKER_15]: The other piece that drives this design is this site is in a flood zone.

176
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:24,837
[SPEAKER_15]: It's in essentially a flood area that is contiguous with the Mystic Valley River.

177
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:30,823
[SPEAKER_15]: So this area here is part of a flood zone that essentially extends across Mystic Valley Parkway.

178
00:15:32,216 --> 00:15:34,617
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, Mark, I just want to interject.

179
00:15:34,757 --> 00:15:36,118
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the future flood zone.

180
00:15:36,358 --> 00:15:37,639
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not currently within.

181
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:40,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's not within the clean.

182
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:47,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just want to make sure that there is no land subject to flooding resource area on on the site.

183
00:15:48,124 --> 00:15:48,745
[SPEAKER_03]: So sorry about that.

184
00:15:48,765 --> 00:15:49,765
[SPEAKER_15]: Excellent point.

185
00:15:49,945 --> 00:15:50,486
[SPEAKER_15]: Excellent point.

186
00:15:50,526 --> 00:15:50,866
[SPEAKER_15]: You're right.

187
00:15:50,926 --> 00:15:53,287
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a future resource, not a current resource.

188
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:54,588
[SPEAKER_15]: Got it.

189
00:15:54,728 --> 00:15:55,108
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

190
00:15:56,314 --> 00:16:04,560
[SPEAKER_15]: So, all buildings that are being built nowadays, no matter where they are, are really being asked to look at future flood conditions and plan for the future flood conditions.

191
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:09,845
[SPEAKER_15]: So, the 20, 30, 100-year flood plain is 11.5.

192
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:13,508
[SPEAKER_15]: Our finished floor is 11.35.

193
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:21,935
[SPEAKER_15]: So, the other thing that drives this design is the need to get the building above at least the 20, 30, 100-year flood elevation.

194
00:16:25,114 --> 00:16:31,098
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have a finished floor of an 1135, and then we have additional flood proofing to at least 1385.

195
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:34,501
[SPEAKER_15]: It actually may be to 1435.

196
00:16:35,201 --> 00:16:39,784
[SPEAKER_15]: It's between 18 and 24 inches, but the minimum is 1385.

197
00:16:40,765 --> 00:16:52,833
[SPEAKER_15]: So above finished floor, we're going to have additional flood proofing on the building, protection of doors and windows and entrances, so that if we do have this 100-year flood condition, we can protect our building.

198
00:16:53,293 --> 00:16:54,014
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is sort of

199
00:16:54,962 --> 00:16:58,165
[SPEAKER_15]: the condition that we're being asked to design to.

200
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:03,589
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we look at the site and we say, why is there a wall there?

201
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:12,356
[SPEAKER_15]: That's being driven by the conditions and we feel that if someone's going to build a building next door to us, they're going to have to take into account all the exact same things.

202
00:17:12,816 --> 00:17:17,320
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the questions that there was concern about is, how does this connect to things that may happen next door?

203
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:22,344
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you'll find that in the future as people want to build in this area that

204
00:17:23,047 --> 00:17:26,230
[SPEAKER_15]: they're going to have to take into account these exact same constraints.

205
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:33,195
[SPEAKER_15]: We also did a section longitudinally, which hopefully will make things a little clearer.

206
00:17:33,295 --> 00:17:36,718
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is Mystic Valley Parkway on the left.

207
00:17:36,738 --> 00:17:39,820
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is going from Mystic Valley Parkway all the way to the back of the site.

208
00:17:40,481 --> 00:17:44,364
[SPEAKER_15]: The shaded area is where the building is located, just to simplify.

209
00:17:45,144 --> 00:17:47,446
[SPEAKER_15]: So here's Mystic Valley Parkway existing grade.

210
00:17:48,087 --> 00:17:50,969
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's us coming up as quickly as we can to 1135.

211
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:55,740
[SPEAKER_15]: And then this is the grade of the site.

212
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:07,623
[SPEAKER_15]: Along the side of the building, we have a reasonably even grade because those first floor doors need to land at that grade, the loading dock needs to land at that grade, and the parking entrance needs to land at that grade.

213
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:16,925
[SPEAKER_15]: Down to the back of the site where this is probably a little easier to see all as one strip.

214
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:22,987
[SPEAKER_15]: It shows here's our detention tank in the back, our drive aisle in the back,

215
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:28,511
[SPEAKER_15]: And then a 42-inch fence, once again, for fall protection.

216
00:18:29,271 --> 00:18:34,274
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the wall leading to the edge of the site, and then the drop-off toward the wetland.

217
00:18:36,795 --> 00:18:38,776
[SPEAKER_15]: And once again, flood elevation is blue.

218
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:43,319
[SPEAKER_15]: Our protection elevation is in red, our minimum protection elevation.

219
00:18:46,721 --> 00:18:51,103
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought the best picture, and I'm going to go forward a little bit if you guys don't mind,

220
00:18:52,204 --> 00:18:54,024
[SPEAKER_15]: that really, we say, thank you.

221
00:18:54,164 --> 00:18:55,285
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going beyond thank you.

222
00:18:55,945 --> 00:19:01,406
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I thought there was one rendering in here that really, from Mystic Valley Parkway, this is what you're going to see.

223
00:19:01,546 --> 00:19:03,766
[SPEAKER_15]: We're meeting Mystic Valley Parkway.

224
00:19:04,147 --> 00:19:06,447
[SPEAKER_15]: We're providing that accessibility that we want here.

225
00:19:06,467 --> 00:19:11,828
[SPEAKER_15]: And that wall sort of presents itself over time into the back of the site.

226
00:19:12,688 --> 00:19:14,589
[SPEAKER_15]: And so this is generally kept level.

227
00:19:15,209 --> 00:19:18,670
[SPEAKER_15]: And once again, being driven by that accessibility and that flood elevation.

228
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:19,990
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought this was a great rendering.

229
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:20,710
[SPEAKER_15]: It really showed

230
00:19:21,711 --> 00:19:23,112
[SPEAKER_15]: what it will feel like in the end.

231
00:19:23,172 --> 00:19:24,472
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't think it's abrupt.

232
00:19:24,512 --> 00:19:29,154
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it actually works really well with what we think is the most important connection, which is out front.

233
00:19:31,155 --> 00:19:35,616
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will stop there and see if there are any questions.

234
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry if there's barking.

235
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,621
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a puppy in the background who doesn't figure that out yet.

236
00:19:51,586 --> 00:19:53,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't we go through the rest of the presentation.

237
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:59,802
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you have other team members that are going to say a few comments and then we'll come back to the board members.

238
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:10,149
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think, you know, we have one more slide after this just kind of showed some examples of what the wall could look like.

239
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:12,830
[SPEAKER_14]: That helps a little bit.

240
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,552
[SPEAKER_14]: So the wall is on that red line there.

241
00:20:15,932 --> 00:20:17,653
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the existing property line.

242
00:20:18,354 --> 00:20:22,716
[SPEAKER_14]: You can kind of see right below that is a section diagram of what the wall is.

243
00:20:22,796 --> 00:20:26,418
[SPEAKER_14]: And these are just examples of what could be done with the wall as well.

244
00:20:27,499 --> 00:20:28,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Right in the middle here.

245
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,982
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, there's a lot of opportunities to create something new here.

246
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:38,162
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and to the right here, you'll see the existing well, what is what will be the proposed fence?

247
00:20:38,242 --> 00:20:42,006
[SPEAKER_14]: It does have to be rated for vehicular impact because there is a drive aisle there.

248
00:20:42,086 --> 00:20:42,306
[SPEAKER_14]: So.

249
00:20:42,846 --> 00:20:45,309
[SPEAKER_14]: There needs to be a certain rating to that fence, but.

250
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:47,950
[SPEAKER_14]: MDOA is on the call.

251
00:20:48,011 --> 00:20:51,695
[SPEAKER_14]: Our landscape architect can talk a little bit more through these if we want.

252
00:20:51,775 --> 00:20:58,363
[SPEAKER_14]: But other than that, Mr. Chair, I think that concludes our core presentation tonight.

253
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:03,429
[SPEAKER_14]: We did want to open it up to questions and comments, if there are any, and make sure that we have plenty of time for that.

254
00:21:06,584 --> 00:21:13,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, and Mr. Lockett, can you speak a little bit to any conversations you've had with abutters?

255
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:21,137
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that there's a kind of a hockey stick shaped piece of land that wraps around this parcel.

256
00:21:21,157 --> 00:21:24,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you maybe just explain that and show the board members that?

257
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,502
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, absolutely.

258
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:43,351
[SPEAKER_14]: So the conversations with the butters, you know, that there's has been conversations with the two of butters that we have to the site, one of them is the, the owner of what is what we're calling a hockey stick parcel, which actually wraps around the eastern and northern edge of the site.

259
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:50,555
[SPEAKER_14]: And that parcel is actually owned by the same group that owns the entire wetlands area.

260
00:21:50,615 --> 00:21:50,755
[SPEAKER_14]: So

261
00:21:51,746 --> 00:21:59,890
[SPEAKER_14]: really been engaging in good conversations with them about that parcel, what could happen there in the future, any sort of proposed conditions.

262
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:08,855
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now, that parcel is actually, is parking that we believe used to serve the Bertucci site.

263
00:22:08,915 --> 00:22:12,897
[SPEAKER_14]: So it is impervious today and it's actually fenced off.

264
00:22:12,997 --> 00:22:20,021
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we had a good picture of the existing conditions in the appendix, Mark, I'm not sure if you could find that.

265
00:22:21,512 --> 00:22:24,995
[SPEAKER_14]: But today it is parking.

266
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:26,156
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, there it is right there.

267
00:22:26,176 --> 00:22:34,262
[SPEAKER_14]: So that fence that you see there, the gray fence to the left that runs all the way to the back of the site is actually the property line today.

268
00:22:35,143 --> 00:22:42,890
[SPEAKER_14]: And the rest of that gray fence going from left to right on the backside of that tree is what we're calling the hockey stick parcel.

269
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:48,134
[SPEAKER_14]: So there is some parking there today, some asphalt's there, but it's not accessible to cars.

270
00:22:48,982 --> 00:22:54,104
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're not anticipating that it will stay parking for the foreseeable future.

271
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:57,125
[SPEAKER_14]: It won't be able to be accessed from our site.

272
00:22:57,205 --> 00:23:00,147
[SPEAKER_14]: It won't be able to be accessed from the street.

273
00:23:00,267 --> 00:23:02,227
[SPEAKER_14]: As you can see, there's a tree in that street pole there.

274
00:23:02,307 --> 00:23:10,971
[SPEAKER_14]: So we do anticipate that site changing and the conversations with the abutting properties that we've had are sort of leading in that direction as well.

275
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,877
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, I can jump in as well on that question.

276
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:26,285
[SPEAKER_12]: Quinlan, if you don't mind, I also had a conversation with with Charter Realty, who's the owner of the hockey stick parcel.

277
00:23:28,287 --> 00:23:30,709
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're very familiar with the plans.

278
00:23:31,851 --> 00:23:33,752
[SPEAKER_12]: Karen Johnson, which are Charter Realty.

279
00:23:35,454 --> 00:23:38,717
[SPEAKER_12]: Told me that I could I could tell the board that they're they're supportive.

280
00:23:39,177 --> 00:23:54,509
[SPEAKER_12]: They do look forward to seeing more information on what the final materials will be for the retaining wall and and also discussing the construction process with with rise in the city as this moves forward.

281
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:55,290
[SPEAKER_12]: But they're there.

282
00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:06,458
[SPEAKER_12]: aware, paying attention, understand that it'll go to ZBA and CONCOM next, and we'll be following that process.

283
00:24:06,758 --> 00:24:09,901
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a good relationship with them here at the city.

284
00:24:09,961 --> 00:24:14,985
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, if anything comes up in the future, we have the ability to reach out and engage.

285
00:24:15,025 --> 00:24:19,968
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know that RISE and Charter have been talking since day one as well.

286
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:24,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Victor.

287
00:24:30,647 --> 00:24:46,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Just looking at these two images here, Quinlan, the fence line that's shown in the rendering is where the chain link fence is now, and there's some unused.

288
00:24:48,745 --> 00:24:58,432
[SPEAKER_06]: asphalt that is on the other side of your property line that obviously you won't be part of this.

289
00:24:58,472 --> 00:25:01,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Here in this rendering, it looks nice and landscaped.

290
00:25:02,415 --> 00:25:04,117
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be nice and landscaped.

291
00:25:04,137 --> 00:25:06,338
[SPEAKER_06]: The asphalt could be broken up.

292
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:11,861
[SPEAKER_06]: could be planted, there could be kind of a wildlife corridor along that edge.

293
00:25:13,002 --> 00:25:25,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, you don't control that land, but is that something that you might seek to landscape in your negotiations with Charter?

294
00:25:26,688 --> 00:25:29,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think that's exactly right, Mr. Chair.

295
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,611
[SPEAKER_14]: That's where these conversations are heading.

296
00:25:31,991 --> 00:25:34,573
[SPEAKER_14]: And we hope that that site will change.

297
00:25:34,593 --> 00:25:39,796
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think they want empty parking spaces or asphalt on their property either.

298
00:25:40,216 --> 00:25:41,237
[SPEAKER_14]: That can't be used.

299
00:25:41,257 --> 00:25:46,039
[SPEAKER_14]: And it would just benefit us if we did those improvements over there.

300
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:49,682
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's where those conversations are heading.

301
00:25:50,042 --> 00:25:52,283
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to commit that we're going to do them.

302
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:53,404
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not really our site.

303
00:25:54,208 --> 00:26:00,171
[SPEAKER_14]: We are committed to working with them to make it something different than just that asphalt area right there.

304
00:26:00,211 --> 00:26:04,252
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not really doing anyone any benefits over there, including the site owners.

305
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:16,658
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we can do anything over there as far as benefits to the landscape or anything like that, we are looking into that and hoping to come to a conclusion with the landowner there as well.

306
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:27,952
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to stop the screen sharing right here so I can see my board members.

307
00:26:28,452 --> 00:26:31,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions or comments from any of the board members?

308
00:26:40,656 --> 00:26:44,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Any feedback about the materials of the retaining wall or anything like that?

309
00:26:46,573 --> 00:26:51,276
[SPEAKER_16]: I just had a question about this tank the water runs into.

310
00:26:51,316 --> 00:26:55,859
[SPEAKER_16]: Is this something that has to be maintained on a regular basis to operate properly?

311
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:05,525
[SPEAKER_15]: The tank itself doesn't require much maintenance because it has catch basins upstream that'll manage the sediments that are alike.

312
00:27:05,965 --> 00:27:08,346
[SPEAKER_15]: If there's maintenance, it's maybe once every 10 years.

313
00:27:09,687 --> 00:27:14,350
[SPEAKER_15]: The treatment, the polishing filter, if you would, at the end of the tank,

314
00:27:15,115 --> 00:27:22,858
[SPEAKER_15]: has cartridges that will need to be changed every year or two or maintained if you would.

315
00:27:22,978 --> 00:27:28,380
[SPEAKER_15]: But there's a maintenance plan that'll be developed as part of the design.

316
00:27:32,922 --> 00:27:40,004
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that a maintenance plan that the developer will enter into with the city to ensure that certain things happen at the site?

317
00:27:40,485 --> 00:27:41,345
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that what you're referring to?

318
00:27:41,944 --> 00:27:49,111
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, usually we do them for the owner for as part of their own facilities plan, but we don't they don't usually go into an agreement with the city.

319
00:27:49,191 --> 00:27:50,772
[SPEAKER_15]: It's kind of their own responsibility.

320
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,531
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, if I could just jump in for a second.

321
00:27:56,232 --> 00:28:13,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Generally, during CONCOM hearings, the CONCOM will probably anticipate asking questions about the maintenance and would probably want to see the O&M plan in their files for their records being associated with the order of conditions that they would eventually issue for the site.

322
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:18,446
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, there'll be a formal O&M plan that is part of the process for sure.

323
00:28:18,466 --> 00:28:22,089
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

324
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:22,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Michael.

325
00:28:29,731 --> 00:28:40,103
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, other questions or comments?

326
00:28:40,544 --> 00:28:47,812
[SPEAKER_06]: One comment that I have, and it's not really for the proponents per se, as much as maybe for the city in general, would be to,

327
00:28:50,018 --> 00:29:16,688
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, since this is a significant open space in the city that's behind this property, and it's also projected to be an area at risk of flooding in coming decades, that it would make sense for the city to start looking strategically at some of these open spaces that are in flood prone areas and perhaps use community preservation dollars to acquire them

328
00:29:17,928 --> 00:29:24,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially if there's going to be a row of development here, that's going to lift the edge of all of those properties.

329
00:29:24,749 --> 00:29:32,411
[SPEAKER_06]: It may turn the area behind it, that wetland into a retaining area eventually.

330
00:29:32,431 --> 00:29:45,393
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think the city really needs to be thinking long-term about this and strategic and trying to acquire some of these possible wetlands.

331
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:58,417
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say that it's the city.

332
00:29:58,437 --> 00:30:12,357
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to speak for own because it's actually the engineer before him was part of looking at large wetlands in the upper mystic area and plan strategic plans to use them for climate.

333
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:21,560
[SPEAKER_11]: And the difficulty, one of the reasons this wasn't selected as a project location was actually because of its private ownership.

334
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:26,802
[SPEAKER_11]: And because the city doesn't own it, we don't have control over it.

335
00:30:28,523 --> 00:30:35,426
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the things that we should be talking about as we look at zoning change and update is,

336
00:30:36,346 --> 00:31:01,018
[SPEAKER_11]: as the proponent alluded to many municipalities require and zoning that you have to build to future floodplains like the 2030 or the 2050 and the 100 year that are some common ones and we really should be building this into our policies and our zoning going forward because there are some

337
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:07,675
[SPEAKER_11]: things that should be that the city should be looking at.

338
00:31:07,895 --> 00:31:15,001
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there's also, you know, the responsibilities of the owners to protect their own properties as well.

339
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:26,869
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I actually appreciate the fact that this proponent is looking at future floodplains, future storm surge possibilities, and, um,

340
00:31:29,226 --> 00:31:36,789
[SPEAKER_11]: how they can manage their properties with it so that we are not then running rescue operations on their property if things flood.

341
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:45,932
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the slides, I know the board was shared the proponents slides, including the appendix.

342
00:31:45,992 --> 00:31:53,134
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the slides in the appendix is about future strategies for preventing wide scale flooding.

343
00:31:53,574 --> 00:31:55,895
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is something that I have been working with

344
00:31:56,295 --> 00:32:24,629
[SPEAKER_11]: um our regional resilient mystic collaborative on that that project and getting large-scale funding because none of the uh things that one would do to prevent this flooding is in medford but medford would benefit dramatically from these items occurring basically so i thought i'd just share that with the board yeah and and director hud could you just maybe give like a two sentence overview of what those

345
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:29,118
[SPEAKER_06]: flood prevention measures entail?

346
00:32:29,138 --> 00:32:31,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we talking about the dam?

347
00:32:35,061 --> 00:32:37,342
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, I was muted again, sorry, yes.

348
00:32:38,483 --> 00:32:44,686
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a number of things that include the Amelia Earhart Dam.

349
00:32:45,146 --> 00:32:47,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, I had them up in front of me a second ago.

350
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:47,527
[SPEAKER_11]: And

351
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:58,914
[SPEAKER_11]: raising that or hardening it, but there's also some looking at a flood barrier next to the Encore Casino.

352
00:32:59,474 --> 00:33:11,220
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some areas in Somerville at Draw 7 State Park that we're jointly working on and at the MBTA Bus Depot and at the Schrapp Center.

353
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:16,663
[SPEAKER_11]: The one that's really, really the most benefit to the City of Medford though is the amazing

354
00:33:18,166 --> 00:33:23,323
[SPEAKER_11]: raising the height of the Amelia Earhart Dam, there was a storm.

355
00:33:24,658 --> 00:33:30,603
[SPEAKER_11]: actually two winters ago now, that came within 18 inches of overtopping that dam.

356
00:33:31,544 --> 00:33:49,599
[SPEAKER_11]: And some of you may remember that Medford used to be, well, no, none of you will remember that Medford used to be a floodplain from your personal experience, but before that dam was built in the 60s, a good portion of Medford had salt marsh, so.

357
00:33:51,882 --> 00:33:52,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Director Hahn.

358
00:33:53,402 --> 00:33:55,443
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we have a comment from a member of the public.

359
00:33:55,523 --> 00:33:56,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Amanda, do you have that?

360
00:33:58,743 --> 00:34:00,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, let me pull it up.

361
00:34:00,904 --> 00:34:07,225
[SPEAKER_10]: So this comment is from Anna Salvo at 112 Lawrence Street, Medford.

362
00:34:08,585 --> 00:34:16,367
[SPEAKER_10]: In reference to the detention tank, has the possibility of a living or green roof been factored into the total rainwater runoff of the building?

363
00:34:22,115 --> 00:34:24,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think, yeah, and Mark, feel free to jump in.

364
00:34:24,737 --> 00:34:31,881
[SPEAKER_14]: We also have Jacob Jacobs, who's one of our architectural consultants on here, who's been who's been looking into some of this as well.

365
00:34:31,901 --> 00:34:34,102
[SPEAKER_14]: But Mark, I don't know if you have something to add first there.

366
00:34:35,443 --> 00:34:41,046
[SPEAKER_15]: No, actually, we did not take credit for that sort of a treatment on the roof that wasn't in the plan at the moment.

367
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:48,490
[SPEAKER_15]: It's as I understand it as a lab building, you have limited space because these require some significant systems, but

368
00:34:49,448 --> 00:34:53,649
[SPEAKER_15]: No, there's no part of the design that includes that kind of mitigation.

369
00:34:55,189 --> 00:35:12,993
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe one of the conditions that we had that we talked about last meeting was to kind of examine, analyze the real estate on top of the roof and to either accommodate solar facilities or green roof as part of it.

370
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:23,770
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing that might not be 100% clear, if there was a green roof that would reduce the amount of runoff going into the tank, not increase it.

371
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:34,935
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's better to not take it into account when designing the tank, the sizing of the tank, because you would actually reduce the size.

372
00:35:35,215 --> 00:35:40,378
[SPEAKER_11]: If anything, it would not increase the amount of runoff, a green roof.

373
00:35:41,278 --> 00:35:50,485
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, the tank size would, yeah, I'd leave it in the conservative side, because you want to plan for a winter, a shoulder condition, shoulder season condition.

374
00:35:50,505 --> 00:36:04,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, and just to be clear, the lab buildings are particular in that they have a lot going on on the roof, so it makes it difficult to do some of these other things that we might ordinarily be more aggressive about.

375
00:36:05,336 --> 00:36:08,358
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know if, you know, Mark or Quinlan, you want to speak to

376
00:36:09,693 --> 00:36:14,975
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, whether you think there may be space up there for one or the other of these.

377
00:36:16,516 --> 00:36:19,797
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and that's why I was going to turn it over to Stephan from Jacobs real quick.

378
00:36:20,057 --> 00:36:24,980
[SPEAKER_14]: It's something that we talked about a little bit after the last meeting when we had a discussion with you guys.

379
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,101
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know, Stephan, if you want to hop in real quick.

380
00:36:29,032 --> 00:36:36,837
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I mean, we're definitely going to evaluate possibilities for both photovoltaic as well as as well as opportunities for green roof.

381
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:44,803
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the lab building in the systems that are required to make it function successfully.

382
00:36:46,904 --> 00:37:02,127
[SPEAKER_00]: including, you know, making it ready for a potential net zero in the future, tend to eat up roof opportunities, but we're still going to evaluate it during later design phases to try to optimize photovoltaic as well as green roofing systems.

383
00:37:04,767 --> 00:37:06,387
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of the conditions.

384
00:37:06,467 --> 00:37:15,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, we can't figure that out right now, but we're directing the proponent to explore that and incorporate it if they can.

385
00:37:21,665 --> 00:37:21,965
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

386
00:37:23,485 --> 00:37:28,086
[SPEAKER_06]: I would, you know, I don't hear any other comments right now.

387
00:37:28,186 --> 00:37:32,547
[SPEAKER_06]: So Amanda, if you could just monitor that, let me know if there's anything else coming in from members of the public.

388
00:37:33,567 --> 00:37:45,850
[SPEAKER_06]: I would suggest to the board and the proponent a condition that's not really prescriptive, but that, you know,

389
00:37:46,684 --> 00:38:10,879
[SPEAKER_06]: directs the proponent to continue dialogue with the abutter to see if they can't come to an agreement about landscaping that parcel, the adjacent parcel for, particularly as kind of a wetland buffer and as a wildlife corridor.

390
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:15,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chair.

391
00:38:15,999 --> 00:38:16,800
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's great.

392
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,883
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something we wanted to do anyway.

393
00:38:18,923 --> 00:38:20,686
[SPEAKER_05]: So I agree that that'd be great.

394
00:38:20,706 --> 00:38:23,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

395
00:38:27,216 --> 00:38:29,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other comments or questions from the board?

396
00:38:33,006 --> 00:38:34,728
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know we have the city engineer.

397
00:38:34,748 --> 00:38:52,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and we're telling here I don't know when if you want to make any comments about about this how, what is your kind of review of this project and like on the engineering side on the engineering side, then basically looking at stormwater and seeing how it's going to.

398
00:38:53,806 --> 00:38:58,529
[SPEAKER_07]: basically meet the standards of the city and state and the general public.

399
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:14,777
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that we've reviewed this conceptually and I've looked at the design plans and it appears that the project will benefit the wetland from the existing conditions.

400
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:19,498
[SPEAKER_07]: basically, you know, the runoff is going to be treated.

401
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:20,759
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not treated now.

402
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:26,064
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are all improvements to the stormwater runoff.

403
00:39:29,808 --> 00:39:33,611
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

404
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:38,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Would there be a motion by a member of the board to

405
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:50,050
[SPEAKER_06]: approve the site plan review with the conditions that we discussed both at the last meeting and the one that I just proposed tonight.

406
00:39:50,691 --> 00:39:51,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Amanda.

407
00:39:51,891 --> 00:39:57,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you all mind if I read out those conditions just to ensure that everything is captured?

408
00:39:57,494 --> 00:39:59,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you.

409
00:40:00,556 --> 00:40:01,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, great.

410
00:40:03,817 --> 00:40:08,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so that the proponent commits to having the site be electric ready.

411
00:40:09,571 --> 00:40:17,533
[SPEAKER_10]: That available roof space be used for solar panels, and if not feasible, that available roof space be considered or used for a green roof.

412
00:40:18,853 --> 00:40:21,714
[SPEAKER_10]: That the building be LEED Gold Certifiable.

413
00:40:22,554 --> 00:40:27,295
[SPEAKER_10]: That the proponent commit to joining the Lower Mystic Transportation Management Association.

414
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:34,137
[SPEAKER_10]: That the proponent complete the mitigation efforts proposed in the Director of Traffic and Transportation memo from May 12th, 2022.

415
00:40:37,122 --> 00:41:01,174
[SPEAKER_10]: that there be showers and lockers on site, that there be at least 10 outdoor and 42 indoor bike parking spaces, that 10% of all parking spaces are to have EV charging, and we've called out here that as presented, that would be 43 spaces, that the programming space be available to the public and that it be available for scheduling and hosting community groups,

416
00:41:02,184 --> 00:41:08,709
[SPEAKER_10]: That the proponent work with city staff to determine an appropriate amount of visitor parking for the retail location.

417
00:41:10,591 --> 00:41:19,835
[SPEAKER_10]: that the proponent make a best effort to connect with the abutter to remove the asphalt and provide landscaping on the adjacent property as a wetland buffer and wildlife corridor.

418
00:41:20,775 --> 00:41:29,959
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wasn't sure if there was a desire by the board to mention some sort of deferring to the Conservation Commission on wetlands protection.

419
00:41:31,799 --> 00:41:32,760
[SPEAKER_10]: I raise that to you all.

420
00:41:33,676 --> 00:41:59,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, we were just discussing in the office that if there were specific changes that the Conservation Commission requests with regards to the edge, that they would not need to come back to this board, that we would just notify this board, but they wouldn't need to come back because it was a change in conditions, but rather that this board would defer to Conservation Commission

421
00:42:01,078 --> 00:42:07,023
[SPEAKER_11]: requirements with regards to the wetland buffer and the, yeah, basically with their conditions.

422
00:42:09,805 --> 00:42:10,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Makes sense.

423
00:42:13,728 --> 00:42:16,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Board members, does this capture our discussion?

424
00:42:20,794 --> 00:42:21,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Chair, if I may.

425
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:24,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, just one quick comment.

426
00:42:24,485 --> 00:42:31,590
[SPEAKER_13]: Amanda, the condition about the green roof and the PV, maybe I just didn't hear what you were saying correctly.

427
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:38,274
[SPEAKER_13]: The commitment is to explore the feasibility of both PV and the green roof, correct?

428
00:42:39,035 --> 00:42:41,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, and I can reword that to make that more clear.

429
00:42:42,617 --> 00:42:43,538
[SPEAKER_13]: Fantastic, thank you.

430
00:42:51,892 --> 00:43:01,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion to approve the site plan review with the associated conditions to the ZBA?

431
00:43:02,741 --> 00:43:03,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Andre, this is Christy.

432
00:43:04,362 --> 00:43:10,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I will make a motion to approve the site plan review as the conditions were read by Amanda.

433
00:43:10,907 --> 00:43:12,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

434
00:43:12,968 --> 00:43:13,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a second?

435
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:16,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Andre, this is Jackie.

436
00:43:16,071 --> 00:43:17,092
[SPEAKER_01]: I second the motion.

437
00:43:18,112 --> 00:43:18,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Jackie.

438
00:43:19,933 --> 00:43:20,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call vote.

439
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:22,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Christy Dowd.

440
00:43:23,394 --> 00:43:24,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

441
00:43:24,494 --> 00:43:25,214
[SPEAKER_06]: David Blumberg.

442
00:43:26,534 --> 00:43:26,815
No.

443
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:29,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Deanna Peabody.

444
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:31,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

445
00:43:33,396 --> 00:43:34,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Jackie Furtado.

446
00:43:34,976 --> 00:43:35,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

447
00:43:37,137 --> 00:43:37,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Les Andresen.

448
00:43:39,457 --> 00:43:39,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

449
00:43:41,298 --> 00:43:42,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm an aye as well.

450
00:43:43,998 --> 00:43:47,699
[SPEAKER_06]: I have one, two, three, four, five to one, the motion passes.

451
00:43:50,681 --> 00:43:55,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the board, appreciate your time and looking forward to keeping you updated on the project as well.

452
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:57,284
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, thank you very much.

453
00:43:58,545 --> 00:43:58,845
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

454
00:44:01,146 --> 00:44:02,147
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you all for your time.

455
00:44:19,405 --> 00:44:24,569
[SPEAKER_06]: The next item on the agenda is the city board rules and regulations.

456
00:44:27,692 --> 00:44:33,096
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm gonna ask David if you can take the lead on that.

457
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:39,922
[SPEAKER_06]: But David, before we start, I don't know if, did you wanna make any other, any final comments about the last project or have any discussion?

458
00:44:45,393 --> 00:44:48,537
[SPEAKER_16]: just while we're all here amongst friends.

459
00:44:48,597 --> 00:44:55,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, as a kind of an invitation, if there were concerns that you didn't want to raise there, but that we should be aware of.

460
00:44:55,887 --> 00:44:57,049
[SPEAKER_11]: But you're still recorded.

461
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,652
[SPEAKER_11]: I always feel like people need to be reminded of that.

462
00:45:00,827 --> 00:45:01,268
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't mind.

463
00:45:01,508 --> 00:45:04,892
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't mind sharing my thoughts it's fine, but thank you for the reminder, appreciate it.

464
00:45:06,093 --> 00:45:11,418
[SPEAKER_16]: I just I think it's too big, and in light of the allowable height in the zone.

465
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:18,506
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's that's my concern I mean I think the projects can deliver a lot of benefits to the city so.

466
00:45:21,328 --> 00:45:24,349
[SPEAKER_16]: these folks seem to be intent on doing a good job.

467
00:45:24,409 --> 00:45:26,370
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think ultimately it'll work out.

468
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:32,732
[SPEAKER_16]: I just, I have a hard time seeing how the ZBA under the statutory standard is gonna approve that variance, but.

469
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:37,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you for sharing that.

470
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:48,199
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say that it does sort of feel like to me that, and we talked about this at one of the earlier meetings that

471
00:45:50,567 --> 00:45:59,475
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems to me like there should also almost be like a little overlay district in this area to sort of guide development along the parkway.

472
00:46:02,317 --> 00:46:14,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Because in a way I do agree with David that it's a really big project and it's, you know, I mean, I think the thing for me is,

473
00:46:17,782 --> 00:46:28,829
[SPEAKER_08]: looking at the apartment building next door and sort of thinking of a row of buildings that meet the scale of the two that are there.

474
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:34,693
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, it's interesting.

475
00:46:41,297 --> 00:46:41,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

476
00:46:42,518 --> 00:46:45,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other board members wanna comment?

477
00:46:50,254 --> 00:46:57,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Just that I hope that the city really focuses on a master plan approach for that area.

478
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:04,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that it was really important that this project be leveraged to really activate that area.

479
00:47:04,627 --> 00:47:14,696
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do get concerned about the long-term plan for that whole area.

480
00:47:15,877 --> 00:47:17,158
[SPEAKER_05]: And it really needs to be thoughtful.

481
00:47:19,768 --> 00:47:25,578
[SPEAKER_06]: By that whole area, you're along- All the parcels that are coming up, yeah, on that side.

482
00:47:25,638 --> 00:47:29,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, the plaza around the corner as well, right?

483
00:47:29,545 --> 00:47:29,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

484
00:47:29,986 --> 00:47:30,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

485
00:47:31,088 --> 00:47:32,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that whole zone.

486
00:47:35,301 --> 00:47:54,719
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe this is a good time to jump in and agree completely and let the board know that we did receive notice from the Mass Gaming Commission that got some funding for a study for this area.

487
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,083
[SPEAKER_12]: And I sent out a scope through the chair,

488
00:48:01,885 --> 00:48:04,967
[SPEAKER_12]: Andrea, I can send it directly to members if you'd prefer.

489
00:48:05,107 --> 00:48:06,128
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that'd be great.

490
00:48:06,148 --> 00:48:06,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't you do that?

491
00:48:07,469 --> 00:48:07,629
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

492
00:48:07,929 --> 00:48:19,876
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'd love to get your eyes on the scope and it encompasses Mystic Valley Parkway, a lot of interesting development on commercial Sycamore Ave, Felsway Plaza.

493
00:48:21,597 --> 00:48:23,318
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a very large area.

494
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:26,780
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really consequential for a lot of reasons but also could

495
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:33,124
[SPEAKER_12]: proved to be just super beneficial if it's thoughtfully redeveloped.

496
00:48:34,045 --> 00:48:42,910
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think we imagine this as being kind of our catalytic kind of assembly opportunity.

497
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:51,975
[SPEAKER_12]: And not to say that it's going to be exactly that project, but just from a benefit standpoint, there's real

498
00:48:53,570 --> 00:49:04,076
[SPEAKER_12]: There's real excitement on our end to look at this closely and to get input from you all in the community on what it should be and understand what the market wants it to be as well.

499
00:49:04,136 --> 00:49:07,558
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're going to be getting started on that.

500
00:49:08,839 --> 00:49:12,701
[SPEAKER_12]: Wish it were in place now, but definitely getting started on it.

501
00:49:13,181 --> 00:49:21,846
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some synergy with the fact that there's the massive MassDOT Gaming Commission review of the Wellington Circle itself.

502
00:49:22,695 --> 00:49:42,216
[SPEAKER_11]: in the eye to making it more pedestrian and bicycle friendly is the goal but also to be able to meet to move large amounts of vehicles through there as instead of getting stuck there at the lights as we tend to see and those projects have been alerted to take into account

503
00:49:42,676 --> 00:50:01,349
[SPEAKER_11]: additional development in this area, because we're so close to the T. The proximity makes it such a good place for transit-oriented development, whether you mean that residential or commercial, but for that intersection,

504
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:02,490
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

505
00:50:02,591 --> 00:50:04,973
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so close, but you can't get there.

506
00:50:05,434 --> 00:50:17,127
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the fact that there is actually a massive project with so much money that they were told to look at grade separated options, that that was not just automatically out of the scope of the project.

507
00:50:17,507 --> 00:50:20,791
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we'll end up with grade separated based on what I've seen myself.

508
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:28,261
[SPEAKER_11]: But to think that that much funding is in scope for that project, and they're not asking the city to pay for it.

509
00:50:28,602 --> 00:50:34,030
[SPEAKER_11]: There are other entities that are going to pay for that to really open up access to that T station there.

510
00:50:34,771 --> 00:50:37,234
[SPEAKER_11]: When we talk about development along Mystic Ave.

511
00:50:38,315 --> 00:50:49,646
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really object, but it doesn't have the accessibility to the rapid transit that this stretch of land actually has, and then the open space for people to use it.

512
00:50:50,086 --> 00:50:52,228
[SPEAKER_11]: That is one of the least, the most underused

513
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:56,112
[SPEAKER_11]: open space tracks.

514
00:50:56,232 --> 00:51:02,619
[SPEAKER_11]: It's such a large area and it's so poorly used by the public.

515
00:51:03,279 --> 00:51:07,644
[SPEAKER_11]: And the fact that you just would have more people there and more people would feel comfortable there.

516
00:51:08,104 --> 00:51:12,849
[SPEAKER_11]: There is in fact a playground designed for McDonald Park.

517
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:17,192
[SPEAKER_11]: that was supposed to go in right as the pandemic was starting.

518
00:51:17,212 --> 00:51:24,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, I'd have to go back to Dennis in our office to find out the timing, because it's very close to the wetlands and the river.

519
00:51:25,257 --> 00:51:34,162
[SPEAKER_11]: So the Conservation Commission has been very in the loop on that, or he has as the environmental agent as that piece.

520
00:51:34,182 --> 00:51:36,783
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just thought I'd throw those in there.

521
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:57,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, one little note that I have to comment on is just in terms of the park there, I think that, you know, there's benefit to leaving some parkland in kind of a passive state and not having to, you know,

522
00:52:00,015 --> 00:52:00,895
[SPEAKER_06]: over-program it.

523
00:52:01,216 --> 00:52:06,097
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like, you know, I live near Riverside Park and there's a lot of things going in there.

524
00:52:06,117 --> 00:52:07,738
[SPEAKER_06]: We've seen dog parks go in.

525
00:52:07,778 --> 00:52:13,300
[SPEAKER_06]: We've seen, it's just kind of like open spaces getting kind of chipped away and it's a wonderful outdoor area.

526
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:21,163
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's an area that we will need in, you know, in case of flooding to be able to absorb land.

527
00:52:21,223 --> 00:52:24,905
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's just my two cents on that issue.

528
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:28,821
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do see that park actually gets used a lot.

529
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:39,486
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm over there all the time and there's a lot of people, a lot of families come in having picnics there and birthday parties and get really good use out of it.

530
00:52:39,767 --> 00:52:42,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Very, very diverse use, I would say.

531
00:52:42,988 --> 00:52:46,630
[SPEAKER_11]: That's good to hear.

532
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:51,392
[SPEAKER_11]: It's such a big space that when you just drive by, you don't even realize that there are people in there.

533
00:52:52,012 --> 00:52:55,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you don't see it from the roadway.

534
00:52:57,897 --> 00:53:01,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's actually protected by that hillock and it's nice and quiet on the other side.

535
00:53:02,902 --> 00:53:05,845
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a gem and it's quite nice.

536
00:53:05,865 --> 00:53:11,890
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of fishing over there and everything else.

537
00:53:13,292 --> 00:53:16,415
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I would eat the fish, but there is a lot of fishing going on.

538
00:53:18,406 --> 00:53:27,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, onto the next agenda item, which is the long awaited rules and regulations of the CD board.

539
00:53:27,593 --> 00:53:33,698
[SPEAKER_06]: So David, I'm going to ask you if you could kind of introduce this for us.

540
00:53:34,499 --> 00:53:34,699
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

541
00:53:34,839 --> 00:53:44,407
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, much, much less interesting than the discussion that preceded it, but we've started on this process and been working on it for quite a while now.

542
00:53:46,503 --> 00:54:02,899
[SPEAKER_16]: before under the old zoning and now we have our updated zoning so those updates that I made most recently were sort of a reaction to having read through the rules post zoning amendment to make sure things still line up okay.

543
00:54:04,813 --> 00:54:06,254
[SPEAKER_16]: We do have very old rules.

544
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:10,118
[SPEAKER_16]: I've covered this for everybody, but just in case someone may be watching.

545
00:54:11,659 --> 00:54:15,163
[SPEAKER_16]: Just looking to make them a little bit more up to date, more current.

546
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:30,117
[SPEAKER_16]: I've taken a look at some neighboring communities and tried to develop using the same framework as our old rules to try to add some best practices into our rules to help us as a board moving forward.

547
00:54:31,073 --> 00:54:47,857
[SPEAKER_16]: So I've made a handful of changes here as a result of having read it in the last week or two, including I changed vice deputy or deputy chair to vice chair, because that seems to be our language that we'd like to use for Jackie's position.

548
00:54:48,917 --> 00:54:51,438
[SPEAKER_16]: And made a couple of stylistic changes on there.

549
00:54:51,458 --> 00:55:00,460
[SPEAKER_16]: I also added a couple of notes about the associate member, which is now approved, which was not approved when we started this process.

550
00:55:03,502 --> 00:55:12,369
[SPEAKER_16]: in particular that the associate member would be introduced or appointed sort of item by item on the agenda.

551
00:55:12,529 --> 00:55:23,258
[SPEAKER_16]: So for instance, if one of the regular members had to recuse him or herself, the chair would introduce the fact that the associate member is going to participate in this particular matter.

552
00:55:26,069 --> 00:55:33,115
[SPEAKER_16]: So those are some of the exciting items that have been added, and I've responded to other comments.

553
00:55:33,755 --> 00:55:44,244
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if the public sees these things, but we've had a sort of a threat in our margins here, various comments, and I've tried to respond to those over the various drafts that we've worked on.

554
00:55:45,345 --> 00:55:51,670
[SPEAKER_16]: So hopefully that's enough background for now.

555
00:55:53,051 --> 00:55:53,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

556
00:55:55,992 --> 00:55:58,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Any members want to weigh in on this?

557
00:56:04,577 --> 00:56:08,980
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanna say thank you for putting in so much time, David, really, really appreciate it.

558
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:16,264
[SPEAKER_06]: And your expertise as an attorney, making sure that everything lines up is really valuable.

559
00:56:16,424 --> 00:56:17,565
[SPEAKER_06]: So appreciate it.

560
00:56:19,317 --> 00:56:19,677
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, thanks.

561
00:56:19,777 --> 00:56:29,846
[SPEAKER_16]: I probably had a little more fun than I should admit going through it, but I did learn a few things along the way because it's been a project I've been working on almost throughout my tenure.

562
00:56:29,866 --> 00:56:30,947
[SPEAKER_16]: It feels like throughout the tenure.

563
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:33,069
[SPEAKER_16]: So I was able to learn a number of things.

564
00:56:33,149 --> 00:56:34,330
[SPEAKER_16]: Alicia taught me some stuff.

565
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:37,673
[SPEAKER_16]: We had KP law pop in every now and again to educate us.

566
00:56:37,733 --> 00:56:41,657
[SPEAKER_16]: So hopefully we've all learned a few things along the way as part of the process too.

567
00:56:42,685 --> 00:56:45,107
[SPEAKER_06]: been a working group of one board member.

568
00:56:45,127 --> 00:56:49,231
[SPEAKER_06]: With some city staff participation.

569
00:56:54,696 --> 00:56:57,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm not sure how controversial these are.

570
00:56:57,618 --> 00:56:58,719
[SPEAKER_06]: They look pretty good to me.

571
00:56:58,839 --> 00:57:02,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Any board members have anything you want to say?

572
00:57:02,282 --> 00:57:08,668
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to echo your thanks to David for all the work that he put into it.

573
00:57:10,033 --> 00:57:18,020
[SPEAKER_01]: I did look over and I don't really have any objections because it just looks, I mean, all the work that was put into it, he just made it that much better.

574
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:22,684
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very clear, the clarity of it, so much so that a couple of things stood out to me.

575
00:57:22,704 --> 00:57:26,767
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just wondering if we were to implement this, when do we start?

576
00:57:26,807 --> 00:57:28,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for instance, it was just brought to our attention.

577
00:57:28,829 --> 00:57:33,973
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, Andre, we'll be losing you as chair at the end of your term soon.

578
00:57:34,253 --> 00:57:38,757
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do know that it says going forward, there'll be one year,

579
00:57:39,685 --> 00:57:44,509
[SPEAKER_01]: term for chairs, but it doesn't say what the term is for vice chairs and so forth, so on.

580
00:57:44,529 --> 00:57:47,031
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just trying to figure that out in between.

581
00:57:47,431 --> 00:57:49,953
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been an honor to be a vice chair alongside you.

582
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:55,398
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also want to make sure that we're conforming and giving other people that opportunity.

583
00:57:56,979 --> 00:57:58,280
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the only questions.

584
00:57:58,661 --> 00:58:06,347
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so good, David, that it got me thinking along those lines of just how we're going to implement it and follow.

585
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:12,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's a good point, Jackie.

586
00:58:12,617 --> 00:58:15,299
[SPEAKER_16]: Boy, I don't have my packet with me right now, Jackie.

587
00:58:15,699 --> 00:58:23,704
[SPEAKER_16]: But if I have a limitation on the chair as only being able to serve for a year at a time, that's what you're suggesting, right?

588
00:58:24,505 --> 00:58:26,186
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I thought that's what I saw.

589
00:58:26,246 --> 00:58:31,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you struck the language, but I'm almost positive I saw that within the content.

590
00:58:32,667 --> 00:58:34,308
[SPEAKER_01]: but it could have been something you struck out.

591
00:58:35,068 --> 00:58:55,294
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm checking, but I think my understanding, sometimes I see this and things and you could read it as limited, but that it's appointed for a year means they have to be reappointed and that it doesn't preclude them from being reappointed, but it doesn't mean they're automatically the chair for three years in a row.

592
00:58:55,915 --> 00:58:56,895
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, okay.

593
00:58:58,211 --> 00:58:59,492
[SPEAKER_16]: I would concur with that.

594
00:58:59,772 --> 00:59:01,472
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's how it's set up.

595
00:59:02,033 --> 00:59:16,978
[SPEAKER_16]: The term limits that are general to our terms, putting aside any officer title that anyone holds, just our regular terms, that's driven by the acts, the enabling acts.

596
00:59:17,578 --> 00:59:23,140
[SPEAKER_16]: But this is just, as a board, every year we have to go through the process of electing our officers.

597
00:59:26,561 --> 00:59:26,621
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

598
00:59:28,144 --> 00:59:37,873
[SPEAKER_01]: And even with saying that, I mean, again, with getting a new chair, I'm just wondering, are we going to have like an election, a re-election for vice chair?

599
00:59:37,893 --> 00:59:41,836
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to make sure that we're going along with what is suggested.

600
00:59:43,257 --> 00:59:49,343
[SPEAKER_16]: That's how I pictured it is each first, I think it's the first meeting in July.

601
00:59:50,042 --> 00:59:59,012
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so go through that process and go ahead and get somebody could serve in that position multiple times, presumably, but you'd only have it for a year at a time.

602
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:00,113
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

603
01:00:01,234 --> 01:00:02,616
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm just going to put a plug there.

604
01:00:02,636 --> 01:00:10,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody should be thinking about that because Andre down from this board and so we need to get this

605
01:00:13,315 --> 01:00:16,856
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to clarify because this question has come up to me.

606
01:00:18,057 --> 01:00:20,198
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just the end of my term.

607
01:00:20,238 --> 01:00:22,259
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had two terms and there are term limits.

608
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:25,120
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not like I'm just leaving.

609
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:30,502
[SPEAKER_11]: This is one of the few boards that I have to step down.

610
01:00:31,943 --> 01:00:33,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, there are term limits.

611
01:00:34,684 --> 01:00:37,205
[SPEAKER_06]: And Deanna as well, actually, we came on at the same time.

612
01:00:40,444 --> 01:00:46,467
[SPEAKER_10]: You will both be dearly missed, but we can talk more about that in the July meeting.

613
01:00:46,487 --> 01:00:49,928
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like we all just got started, didn't we?

614
01:00:51,009 --> 01:00:51,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

615
01:00:51,869 --> 01:00:55,731
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm just going to say it now.

616
01:00:55,791 --> 01:00:57,852
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that Amanda's been communicating with people.

617
01:00:57,992 --> 01:01:04,135
[SPEAKER_11]: As we're setting up a meeting with the comprehensive plan consultants to present stuff to this board,

618
01:01:05,206 --> 01:01:09,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Deanna and Andre, you're very welcome to attend and participate in that meeting.

619
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:24,180
[SPEAKER_11]: There is some level of intention that it's so that if the board who's going to be asked to approve the plan later has changes, I'd rather have those changes now and not when we literally come to approval.

620
01:01:24,621 --> 01:01:27,803
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the same time, this is about making the plan a better plan.

621
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:32,527
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you can, we would like you to participate in that meeting.

622
01:01:34,258 --> 01:01:35,319
[SPEAKER_03]: planning on participating.

623
01:01:37,281 --> 01:01:45,267
[SPEAKER_12]: And Deanna and Andre, just because we're losing you from this CD board doesn't mean you can't join other boards or commissions.

624
01:01:46,689 --> 01:01:49,891
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're interested in that, we'd love to talk to you about it.

625
01:01:53,755 --> 01:01:55,116
[SPEAKER_04]: CPC is looking for people.

626
01:01:59,019 --> 01:01:59,780
[SPEAKER_12]: Shameless plug.

627
01:02:03,434 --> 01:02:19,281
[SPEAKER_10]: I will just also make another note here that, as was thoughtfully laid out by David, there is a clerk position, which I think currently we have not formally filled, so something to consider for the next meeting in July.

628
01:02:20,628 --> 01:02:36,844
[SPEAKER_06]: That was actually going to be my one question about this was whether, given the fact that the staff, the city staff, essentially serves that function, whether we need to have a clerk, but I don't know, David, if there was conversations around that or your thinking.

629
01:02:38,173 --> 01:02:50,143
[SPEAKER_16]: I tried to set it up because the statute for planning boards calls for a clerk to be one of the, it's one of the positions that someone would hold that title.

630
01:02:50,904 --> 01:02:58,270
[SPEAKER_16]: But the services that Princess Amanda is so capably providing to us now, she could continue to provide.

631
01:02:58,771 --> 01:03:04,376
[SPEAKER_16]: Our clerk would just sort of ensure that things like minutes are produced and presented at each meeting, that sort of thing.

632
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:09,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that could be helpful, especially to review the minutes, make sure they're accurate.

633
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:15,289
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be good.

634
01:03:15,449 --> 01:03:16,870
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, well, I'm convinced.

635
01:03:18,671 --> 01:03:20,492
[SPEAKER_16]: We can always change them too as we go.

636
01:03:20,632 --> 01:03:22,533
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's the ultimate comfort.

637
01:03:26,535 --> 01:03:34,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, is there a motion to adopt the rules and regulations of the CD board as proposed by member Blumberg?

638
01:03:36,825 --> 01:03:37,786
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll make that motion.

639
01:03:41,748 --> 01:03:42,968
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll second it, it's Jackie.

640
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:46,470
[SPEAKER_06]: A roll call vote.

641
01:03:47,451 --> 01:03:48,211
[SPEAKER_06]: David Blumberg.

642
01:03:49,412 --> 01:03:50,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are you on this?

643
01:03:50,072 --> 01:03:51,433
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to give us the surprise now?

644
01:03:51,533 --> 01:03:53,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.

645
01:03:56,755 --> 01:03:57,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Christy Dowd.

646
01:03:58,396 --> 01:03:58,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

647
01:04:00,758 --> 01:04:01,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Jackie Furtado.

648
01:04:02,358 --> 01:04:02,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

649
01:04:03,579 --> 01:04:04,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Deanna Peabody.

650
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:05,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

651
01:04:06,488 --> 01:04:07,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Bless Andreessen.

652
01:04:07,789 --> 01:04:08,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

653
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:09,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi as well.

654
01:04:11,252 --> 01:04:12,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Passed unanimously.

655
01:04:12,133 --> 01:04:14,875
[SPEAKER_06]: We have some rules and regulations and thank you very much, David.

656
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:21,040
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

657
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:23,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see here.

658
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:28,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me just, next item on the agenda is just miscellaneous and other updates.

659
01:04:28,661 --> 01:04:35,291
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did cover a couple of things that probably fall into that category, like the transition of Deanna and me.

660
01:04:36,433 --> 01:04:37,615
[SPEAKER_06]: But is there anything else, Amanda?

661
01:04:40,345 --> 01:04:41,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, just a reminder.

662
01:04:41,726 --> 01:04:44,108
[SPEAKER_10]: July 14th is our next meeting.

663
01:04:44,988 --> 01:04:54,254
[SPEAKER_10]: During then we'll have the comp plan presentation discussion of election of these new or not so new roles.

664
01:04:55,094 --> 01:05:09,383
[SPEAKER_10]: And one piece that wasn't floated with you guys yet is that we have since been kicked a zoning map change petition from the city council.

665
01:05:10,063 --> 01:05:12,424
[SPEAKER_10]: two petitions actually for the kind of same area.

666
01:05:12,444 --> 01:05:21,026
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a kind of like Boston Ave stretch that includes like 200 Boston Ave, 222.

667
01:05:22,546 --> 01:05:32,689
[SPEAKER_10]: So our first formal vote experience with potentially some new board members will be during that meeting as well.

668
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:40,333
[SPEAKER_10]: And obviously you all get the materials ahead of time to review for that conversation.

669
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:47,578
[SPEAKER_06]: And Amanda, how many board members, new board members do you expect to join the next meeting?

670
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:54,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Hoping two, maybe three, but put feelers out.

671
01:05:54,422 --> 01:06:01,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, feelers out for two, one and we've made an offer to just waiting to hear back final confirmation.

672
01:06:03,699 --> 01:06:07,905
[SPEAKER_06]: And is there also recruiting happening for an associate number?

673
01:06:09,587 --> 01:06:10,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Not yet.

674
01:06:11,950 --> 01:06:13,672
[SPEAKER_10]: But well, I think.

675
01:06:14,848 --> 01:06:16,088
[SPEAKER_10]: I should revise that statement.

676
01:06:16,188 --> 01:06:24,410
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been looking at applications that have been coming in with kind of an eye to both like full membership roles and associate member roles.

677
01:06:24,870 --> 01:06:28,091
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's, you know, been a part of the process.

678
01:06:28,931 --> 01:06:35,752
[SPEAKER_10]: But if I would highly encourage folks, if anybody comes to mind, to please encourage them to apply.

679
01:06:36,593 --> 01:06:37,913
[SPEAKER_10]: We're still looking and reviewing.

680
01:06:39,525 --> 01:06:45,789
[SPEAKER_06]: And that, the application, the board application, can you drop the link in there for people?

681
01:06:46,429 --> 01:06:49,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I actually don't know where it lives.

682
01:06:50,151 --> 01:06:50,852
[SPEAKER_11]: I can get it.

683
01:06:51,652 --> 01:06:56,195
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, so people are aware it's on the boards and commissions webpage.

684
01:06:57,535 --> 01:07:02,038
[SPEAKER_11]: So the easy URL is for me to just say medfordma.org slash boards.

685
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:07,761
[SPEAKER_11]: And on that is paperwork submission

686
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:12,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Boards and committees application is the second bullet on the list.

687
01:07:13,047 --> 01:07:16,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Interested in serving on one of the boards, please fill out an application form.

688
01:07:17,309 --> 01:07:24,372
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's one of those URLs that no one could ever say on television, because it's a string of letters and numbers.

689
01:07:28,034 --> 01:07:32,176
[SPEAKER_11]: So we direct everybody to medfordma.org slash boards.

690
01:07:36,996 --> 01:07:40,998
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a nice new online form where you can check off.

691
01:07:41,198 --> 01:07:53,483
[SPEAKER_11]: And if there are any like ad hoc boards that are just appointing for a short period of time, they would be available on there as well.

692
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:06,972
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would encourage people to always apply for anything that looks interesting to you and don't worry about whether or not there's an opening.

693
01:08:08,693 --> 01:08:10,373
[SPEAKER_11]: Openings occur all the time.

694
01:08:10,393 --> 01:08:18,376
[SPEAKER_11]: And sometimes there are openings because people say, well, if there are other people actually applying, then I'm willing to step down.

695
01:08:18,916 --> 01:08:22,117
[SPEAKER_11]: But people feel obligated to stay until there's a replacement.

696
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, thank you, Director Hunt.

697
01:08:31,134 --> 01:08:47,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Some other updates or one more really is just, I mentioned this last meeting that Theory Wellness, which is a proposed cannabis dispensary project at 162 Mystic Ave has submitted their materials for site plan review.

698
01:08:48,442 --> 01:08:58,687
[SPEAKER_10]: They requested a brief extension in that kind of initial review that we do administratively to tie up a few loose ends, but assuming that those get squared away in the next week,

699
01:08:59,247 --> 01:09:04,312
[SPEAKER_10]: we should anticipate hosting them for a meeting for site plan review towards the end of July.

700
01:09:04,632 --> 01:09:07,614
[SPEAKER_10]: So I will be in touch with folks about scheduling.

701
01:09:07,634 --> 01:09:21,587
[SPEAKER_10]: And the last piece is there are a couple of folks that I still need to grab signatures from for the plan sets for Steve Miller Drive and Freedom Way.

702
01:09:23,428 --> 01:09:33,130
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just notified that there is kind of a scheduling urgency around some of that to make the city council meeting in July that's happening.

703
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:42,272
[SPEAKER_10]: So if y'all haven't seen it already, for those that I'm waiting on, just take a look at your email and feel free to be in touch.

704
01:09:42,652 --> 01:09:43,352
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll figure that out.

705
01:09:47,252 --> 01:09:48,233
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's everything on my end.

706
01:09:51,145 --> 01:10:09,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Andre, this is Jackie, I just wanted to clarify on that going back to the zoning map change, Amanda, are you able to give a little bit of specifics about what that zoning change would be for 200 blocks and I'm just a little, I thought that was like a shared space already, like with toughs being there and just like office space.

707
01:10:09,575 --> 01:10:11,156
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just wondering what that's

708
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:13,319
[SPEAKER_01]: change would look like.

709
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:15,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Amanda, do you want me to speak to that?

710
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,541
[SPEAKER_11]: That is right, the block with Tufts.

711
01:10:19,061 --> 01:10:31,926
[SPEAKER_11]: There's the block with Tufts and then there's another group of parcels and that other group of parcels, including a upholstery shop that's been closed for quite a while, that whole group is owned by one person.

712
01:10:32,946 --> 01:10:37,188
[SPEAKER_11]: So those two property owners put these requests into the City Council

713
01:10:37,668 --> 01:10:44,010
[SPEAKER_11]: and it's to change it from an I, the industrial zone, to an O2, which is the new office two zone.

714
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:45,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

715
01:10:45,210 --> 01:10:50,992
[SPEAKER_11]: So that would actually allow life science, would allow some more height there.

716
01:10:51,012 --> 01:10:58,714
[SPEAKER_11]: It would allow some reasonably sized life science to be built there as of right actually, but with site plan review because they would be big buildings.

717
01:10:59,594 --> 01:10:59,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

718
01:11:00,875 --> 01:11:01,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

719
01:11:06,833 --> 01:11:07,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for asking that.

720
01:11:10,055 --> 01:11:16,118
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be formally presented next week, but it was at city council this week and the week before so.

721
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:19,479
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

722
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:24,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think we've come to the end of the agenda.

723
01:11:25,302 --> 01:11:28,364
[SPEAKER_06]: So if there's no further comments.

724
01:11:29,284 --> 01:11:30,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion to adjourn.

725
01:11:36,545 --> 01:11:38,186
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to offer a motion to adjourn.

726
01:11:39,427 --> 01:11:39,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, David.

727
01:11:39,887 --> 01:11:40,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a second?

728
01:11:41,528 --> 01:11:42,168
[SPEAKER_08]: I will second.

729
01:11:43,089 --> 01:11:43,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, class.

730
01:11:44,349 --> 01:11:44,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call vote.

731
01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:45,970
[SPEAKER_06]: David Blumberg.

732
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:47,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

733
01:11:48,352 --> 01:11:48,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Christy Dowd.

734
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:52,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, was that an aye?

735
01:11:54,655 --> 01:11:54,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

736
01:11:55,136 --> 01:11:55,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Jackie Furtado.

737
01:11:56,756 --> 01:11:56,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

738
01:11:57,697 --> 01:11:58,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Deanna Peabody.

739
01:11:59,198 --> 01:11:59,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

740
01:12:00,138 --> 01:12:00,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Les and Jason.

741
01:12:01,379 --> 01:12:01,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

742
01:12:02,539 --> 01:12:03,479
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm an I as well.

743
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:09,062
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll probably still see y'all on July 14th, but it's been a pleasure.

744
01:12:09,082 --> 01:12:11,523
[SPEAKER_06]: So thanks, everyone.
