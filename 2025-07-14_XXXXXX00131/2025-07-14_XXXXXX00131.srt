[SPEAKER_00]: Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:30,356 --> 00:00:33,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:33,796 --> 00:00:35,877
[SPEAKER_01]: And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:42,438 --> 00:00:45,280
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, thanks so much for making the time to meet with me tonight.

10
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:51,025
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't mind just introducing yourself with your name, pronouns, and just a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:52,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

12
00:00:52,426 --> 00:00:54,387
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Miranda Breseno.

13
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:55,408
[SPEAKER_02]: She, her pronouns.

14
00:00:56,109 --> 00:01:00,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in the Hillside neighborhood of Medford.

15
00:01:00,993 --> 00:01:04,715
[SPEAKER_02]: I've lived there in the same apartment since I moved to Medford in 2019.

16
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,629
[SPEAKER_02]: I moved here originally from Los Angeles.

17
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I moved here for grad school at Tufts in urban planning.

18
00:01:14,192 --> 00:01:24,660
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wasn't sure if I was gonna stay living in the area post-grad school, but I finished in 2020 and the world had other plans.

19
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:33,927
[SPEAKER_02]: And so six and a half, almost seven years later, I'm very much happy to call this home and haven't wanted to move.

20
00:01:34,647 --> 00:01:35,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been looking

21
00:01:35,665 --> 00:01:45,472
[SPEAKER_02]: or I was looking for new apartments, but I've always wanted to stay in Medford since I've made so many friends and really developed a community here.

22
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:52,157
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am a cat mom.

23
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:59,943
[SPEAKER_02]: My orange cat, Alto, is often with me, or not here because I'm in the library, but he would be a part of this interview otherwise.

24
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:04,409
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a planner by training.

25
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:05,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously I went to planning school.

26
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,291
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked at City Hall for a couple of years in the planning office.

27
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:16,293
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to a nonprofit, used to be called Walk Boston, now Walk Massachusetts, doing pedestrian advocacy work.

28
00:02:17,034 --> 00:02:30,739
[SPEAKER_02]: And I now work for MassDOT in the planning office as a regional planning coordinator and federal programs coordinator, working with municipalities to get them, mostly federal funds, but other funds, complete kind of a range of projects,

29
00:02:31,386 --> 00:02:49,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Small projects like bike share and bike racks and some bigger projects like the feasibility studies for putting a bridge at grade and some other planning work regionally and around the state.

30
00:02:50,627 --> 00:02:50,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

31
00:02:52,328 --> 00:03:01,437
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really interesting and it does actually set a good beginning for our interview to talk about your campaign for city council.

32
00:03:01,477 --> 00:03:03,419
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those feel like really relevant skills.

33
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:10,887
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's some of the things that you're naming that you work in and know a lot about are, I think, some of the biggest complaints people have about the city.

34
00:03:12,682 --> 00:03:15,603
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we get to that, I just want to ask you the question we ask everybody.

35
00:03:15,723 --> 00:03:18,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's the most challenging question that we'll have today.

36
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:21,984
[SPEAKER_01]: But what is your favorite place to eat in Medford?

37
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:23,205
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you like to eat there?

38
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:29,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I did talk to a couple of folks who you've been to before and they were like, know what your favorite place to eat is.

39
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:30,507
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have plenty.

40
00:03:31,997 --> 00:03:37,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like to joke that I kept Pinky's Pizza running during the pandemic because I was like, they are like down the street for me.

41
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:41,203
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, you know, chicken tenders, calzone, pizza, whatever.

42
00:03:42,244 --> 00:03:44,605
[SPEAKER_02]: So Pinky's is up there just because they're so close to me.

43
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say I have like a top three.

44
00:03:47,547 --> 00:03:52,210
[SPEAKER_02]: El Tacuba, hands down the best Mexican food on the East Coast.

45
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I will never stop saying that.

46
00:03:53,991 --> 00:03:55,092
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I have

47
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:04,266
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the expertise to say so as someone from Los Angeles and someone who is Mexican, that is the absolute best Mexican food.

48
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,207
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it so much there.

49
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,008
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love all their cocktails, too.

50
00:04:09,089 --> 00:04:09,970
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Colleen's.

51
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,432
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like I said, those are like my top three.

52
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Tom Yum Kung.

53
00:04:15,513 --> 00:04:16,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I have so many places.

54
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:24,640
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the, you know, the sort of staying in the kind of Medford Square and Medford Square proximity.

55
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,040
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nice.

56
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, no, and the food seems definitely improved over the last couple of years.

57
00:04:29,671 --> 00:04:30,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.

58
00:04:30,531 --> 00:04:40,073
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when we moved here, we moved here in like 2014 and not so not too long after they put the like coming soon sign up for to cook.

59
00:04:40,793 --> 00:04:41,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

60
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:41,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

61
00:04:41,713 --> 00:04:45,574
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I remember when I started at the city, it was like a whole thing.

62
00:04:45,594 --> 00:04:48,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, we've been waiting for this thing to happen.

63
00:04:48,095 --> 00:04:51,995
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it finally opened, you know, I don't even remember when it finally opened.

64
00:04:52,055 --> 00:04:53,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I just remember being so excited.

65
00:04:53,176 --> 00:04:53,576
[SPEAKER_02]: It was open.

66
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:53,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

67
00:04:54,276 --> 00:04:54,376
Um,

68
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:56,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, wow, that was a long time.

69
00:04:56,514 --> 00:04:59,637
[SPEAKER_02]: They were still working on that when I was at City Hall.

70
00:05:00,197 --> 00:05:09,045
[SPEAKER_02]: But I actually got to meet and work with Alvaro, who's one of the owners, you know, when he was working on the Tenog stuff.

71
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:11,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Great guy.

72
00:05:12,548 --> 00:05:14,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome, awesome time to get to know him.

73
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:16,451
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just so excited about the restaurants there.

74
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:20,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I tell literally anyone and everyone that will listen, I'm like, you need to come to Medford.

75
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:20,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

76
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,032
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're waiting for Altacuba, you can hit up Mrs. Murphy's.

77
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:26,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

78
00:05:26,552 --> 00:05:28,613
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been to Mrs. Murphy's yet, but I need to.

79
00:05:29,253 --> 00:05:29,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

80
00:05:30,094 --> 00:05:30,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

81
00:05:30,934 --> 00:05:35,316
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm excited for the Tanosh guys for their coffee shop that's supposed to be opening.

82
00:05:35,896 --> 00:05:36,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?

83
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:37,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know.

84
00:05:37,957 --> 00:05:39,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we used to have a coffee shop.

85
00:05:40,278 --> 00:05:41,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Mr. Coffee Roaster.

86
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:42,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.

87
00:05:42,219 --> 00:05:43,340
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's right in that space.

88
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

89
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:50,803
[SPEAKER_02]: They closed when I was still at City Hall, and that was rough because I would walk to work when the weather was nice from my apartment.

90
00:05:52,674 --> 00:05:55,555
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always nice to be like, you know, I'm not above Duncan.

91
00:05:55,955 --> 00:06:06,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll, I'll get Duncan any day, but it was always nice to be like, yeah, you know, I'm going to get like a nice, like a nicer bagel from the local shop.

92
00:06:06,297 --> 00:06:08,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so sad when they closed.

93
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:10,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have a shirt.

94
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:11,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I did get a shirt during 2020.

95
00:06:11,859 --> 00:06:13,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I was like, I love them.

96
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:17,880
[SPEAKER_02]: But I it's exciting to hear they're going to open a coffee shop.

97
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, they've also, the signs have been up for a while, so hopefully it's happening soon, but it's exciting.

98
00:06:24,482 --> 00:06:26,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Worth the wait, these places, so that's good.

99
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:27,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, definitely.

100
00:06:28,423 --> 00:06:41,526
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Miranda, so we did allude to it before, but you're running for city council in Medford, and I'm curious to hear kind of what the path has been like for you to arrive at that decision, kind of what prompted you to run for city council?

101
00:06:43,527 --> 00:06:47,488
[SPEAKER_02]: What really prompted me was other people asking if I considered it.

102
00:06:49,273 --> 00:07:00,459
[SPEAKER_02]: When I realized I would be staying in Medford for a while, just because I wasn't sure if another job opportunity would take me somewhere, in 2020, I was like, well, let me develop roots here.

103
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:10,525
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got involved, like everybody, in the summer of 2020 after George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, so many other things.

104
00:07:10,585 --> 00:07:17,628
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I need to feel like, besides working at City Hall, which is great and see a lot of what you work on happening in real time,

105
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:23,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I needed, I wanted to feel like more connected to people because I didn't know many people living in Medford.

106
00:07:24,371 --> 00:07:29,934
[SPEAKER_02]: So I joined Our Revolution Medford, met someone who literally lived across the street from me.

107
00:07:30,874 --> 00:07:32,895
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, a couple other folks in my neighborhood.

108
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,997
[SPEAKER_02]: And since then have just been, you know, making friends.

109
00:07:37,097 --> 00:07:45,580
[SPEAKER_02]: And in 2021 is when I first started getting door knocking and canvassing, trying to elect candidates endorsed by Our Revolution Medford.

110
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:50,710
[SPEAKER_02]: just really started rooting myself through that.

111
00:07:51,770 --> 00:08:15,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Working at City Hall too, I did, when, you know, as we were trying to navigate COVID, one of the first projects, Alicia Hunt, director of planning, kind of assigned me and one of, now planner, used to be intern, was using HUD funds for COVID relief business grants.

112
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,037
[SPEAKER_02]: City of Cambridge had done one and they were like,

113
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:31,203
[SPEAKER_02]: we have a lot of CDBG, Community Development Block Grant money that we can use for this, you know, look into the details or requirements, what we would need from folks and who we can and can't offer this grant to.

114
00:08:32,404 --> 00:08:41,466
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was kind of like being thrown in the deep end, but very much with like the comfort of knowing that, you know, Alicia, the mayor and other folks were there to support us.

115
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,507
[SPEAKER_02]: But that really, I'd say that work in particular,

116
00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:58,541
[SPEAKER_02]: That, plus I also worked on outdoor dining, really just like kind of spread my knowledge wide of the city, particularly like business owners, and like the kind of businesses that people were needing relief for.

117
00:08:58,581 --> 00:09:04,646
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it was like our corner stores and convenience stores, like they just needed help making rent.

118
00:09:06,427 --> 00:09:08,529
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of our restaurants as well.

119
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,971
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the biggest thing I would say we helped pay for was rent.

120
00:09:13,652 --> 00:09:14,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Rent and

121
00:09:14,783 --> 00:09:26,933
[SPEAKER_02]: for businesses that were like operating in the homes, it was like Zoom memberships, stuff to make them available online and sort of start to digitize and like dip into e-commerce if they weren't already.

122
00:09:28,615 --> 00:09:38,724
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that and my involvement in the community with ORM and other stuff kind of just really organically got me knowing more about Medford.

123
00:09:39,967 --> 00:09:41,247
[SPEAKER_02]: and just getting really involved.

124
00:09:41,608 --> 00:09:46,469
[SPEAKER_02]: And even as I started, I changed jobs a couple of times since working at City Hall.

125
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:49,770
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still always been like, I love being in Medford.

126
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,731
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the people that I've met here.

127
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:57,393
[SPEAKER_02]: My apartment isn't like the most affordable, but it's not insane.

128
00:09:57,413 --> 00:09:59,433
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I can continue to keep affording it.

129
00:10:01,314 --> 00:10:04,455
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, I've just been involved and then I,

130
00:10:05,327 --> 00:10:22,679
[SPEAKER_02]: this last or this upcoming election was talking with a friend who had has been involved with the ORM, like coordinated campaigns previously, and had asked, is this something you'd consider, you're qualified for it?

131
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,523
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still do often have the imposter syndrome of like, am I qualified?

132
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:33,448
[SPEAKER_02]: then I list out the things that I've done and what I went to school for.

133
00:10:33,648 --> 00:10:35,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I am.

134
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:45,073
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think part of it is just like, I'm pretty, I'm an introverted, extroverted introvert, I'd say.

135
00:10:45,153 --> 00:10:49,654
[SPEAKER_02]: So part of it is really just like exposure therapy and like getting to know people.

136
00:10:49,954 --> 00:10:52,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I do really thrive much more in one-on-one situations.

137
00:10:53,676 --> 00:10:55,056
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I've canvassed before in 2021, 2023,

138
00:10:58,092 --> 00:11:05,158
[SPEAKER_02]: like those conversations at the doors are like, they seem intimidating, but they're actually very fruitful and I really enjoy them.

139
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,040
[SPEAKER_02]: And plus I like walking around anyway.

140
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,602
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was part of it.

141
00:11:10,662 --> 00:11:16,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I think part of it's like, I am lucky enough to have job security.

142
00:11:16,106 --> 00:11:26,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm lucky enough to have, despite, you know, my own like struggles in my life, I did, you know, still kind of got a lucky card out of it all.

143
00:11:27,782 --> 00:11:44,267
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I have this privilege and like some level of comfort in my life, I do kind of sort of view, I don't want to say like my calling or kind of view it as like, I want to make this world better for people.

144
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:56,950
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I can like offer myself and offer what I know, particularly when it comes to something like being a city Councilor or even just working at city hall, I think something that's always kind of come

145
00:11:57,728 --> 00:12:07,434
[SPEAKER_02]: through in my work professionally, in particular, has been let me help you understand this really bureaucratic, nuanced thing that can help you.

146
00:12:07,454 --> 00:12:22,263
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the times it doesn't need to be that nuanced or bureaucratic, it just kind of is because, well, historically, these processes and institutions were made to exclude people systematically, and so helping

147
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:30,504
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of kind of like that helping within the system as it exists to try and get people access to it who haven't been able to access it before.

148
00:12:31,224 --> 00:12:36,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that's a lot of my work professionally.

149
00:12:36,147 --> 00:12:46,933
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if I have the knowledge and the ability to try and do that in the role of city councilor, I'd be, you know, honored at the privilege to.

150
00:12:47,914 --> 00:12:52,817
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end of the day, it's really, I think just like putting yourself out there, people respond to it, cool.

151
00:12:53,057 --> 00:12:53,417
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't.

152
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,180
[SPEAKER_02]: tried my best and I met some more neighbors.

153
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:09,564
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think there's, I'm really, I think inspired and like excited about all the work the Kern Council is doing.

154
00:13:10,424 --> 00:13:11,825
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanna see it keep going.

155
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:19,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that there has been a lot, not a lot of opposition, but some loud opposition to certain things going on.

156
00:13:19,347 --> 00:13:22,668
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think given the federal landscape,

157
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:46,174
[SPEAKER_02]: and being targeted specifically here in Massachusetts by the federal administration, it would really just hurt everyone if we started to revert back to policies and programs and things that didn't put people first, didn't really consider protecting everyone, making sure everyone is welcome here and safe here.

158
00:13:48,164 --> 00:14:11,489
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think like during COVID is when this started for me, but also obviously like now, nothing's gotten really better since then, but you know, like when everything is sort of on fire in the world and in our country, it's like, if you can have an impact on where you live and that you can sort of try to make that a better place, I think that gives us a little bit of sense of control and a little bit of hope.

159
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:14,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was basically the biggest thing.

160
00:14:14,609 --> 00:14:17,070
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like particularly now people are feeling that too.

161
00:14:17,978 --> 00:14:20,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a primary for a reason, right?

162
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Like so many people did feel called to run for city council.

163
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:32,069
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that plus, I also started getting involved in mutual aid Medford-Somerville mamas in 2020.

164
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:38,113
[SPEAKER_02]: And that has also been like huge for me as much as I like the political organizing.

165
00:14:39,474 --> 00:14:46,660
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, the systems and institutions that rule us were created unequally and exclusively

166
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:57,847
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do sort of see like mutual aid and like other community-based efforts as kind of the filler of that because, you know electoral politics and organizing is only gonna get us so far.

167
00:14:59,407 --> 00:15:05,528
[SPEAKER_02]: And so particularly like to your point of let me help someone here, like let me feel slightly in control.

168
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:08,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a grocery pair every two weeks.

169
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:11,950
[SPEAKER_02]: So I drop off a market basket card to a neighbor in Medford who needs it.

170
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,110
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just like, you know, I know like

171
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:22,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Mamas in particular, they're helping so many people, but like I helped this family get their groceries and I can feel good about that.

172
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:29,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Despite like everything, like I know that like I did what I could.

173
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:35,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, and I think this idea of like a couple years ago, we talked about this little bit of

174
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:43,422
[SPEAKER_01]: this, I think the conversation is like, how do we get more people to participate in local government, like to come to city council meetings?

175
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,523
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, like, how do we get them to us?

176
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:55,786
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, and if you look at like, the city council, when our mayor was on city council, she, I think, was the only woman, everyone was like, an old white guy.

177
00:15:56,336 --> 00:16:04,746
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and like I think sometimes they their meetings were like not attended at all by the public right and so it was this kind of like closed door sort of thing.

178
00:16:05,146 --> 00:16:13,196
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's changed and I think that the current city council, the makeup is different and also I think they're doing a better job of

179
00:16:14,532 --> 00:16:17,214
[SPEAKER_01]: going to the people versus waiting for them to come to them.

180
00:16:17,254 --> 00:16:24,380
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think about how the makeup has changed, but also to have like some, like a woman who's Mexican.

181
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:34,148
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I think that that would be a huge thing for Medford, especially for, I don't want to assume, but if you speak Spanish, like that, having that kind of- It's conversational.

182
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:35,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish it was better.

183
00:16:35,969 --> 00:16:37,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have a strong duolingo streak.

184
00:16:39,452 --> 00:16:41,534
[SPEAKER_02]: And I try my best to practice as much as I can.

185
00:16:41,574 --> 00:16:41,934
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really,

186
00:16:43,307 --> 00:16:50,313
[SPEAKER_02]: In particular, I've learned Mexican Spanish is so much slower than most other Spanish, um, you know, speakers.

187
00:16:50,393 --> 00:17:00,922
[SPEAKER_02]: And so particularly living on the East coast for college and grad school, and now just being here, it's like, I'll start and say a few things and then someone will like just rattle off so quickly.

188
00:17:00,962 --> 00:17:03,825
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, Oh, let's try English.

189
00:17:04,185 --> 00:17:06,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but you know, usually I just try my best.

190
00:17:07,008 --> 00:17:12,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it was my first language, but, um, when I was growing up, actually the teacher told my mom that

191
00:17:12,635 --> 00:17:15,897
[SPEAKER_02]: we might be slow if she talked to us in two languages.

192
00:17:16,777 --> 00:17:23,582
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the time, you know, we were my mom's first kids and she and my father used to get like hit in school for speaking Spanish.

193
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:26,203
[SPEAKER_02]: So she was like, Oh, okay.

194
00:17:27,244 --> 00:17:27,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

195
00:17:27,444 --> 00:17:30,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven years later, my sister's born and we're like, Oh, bilingualism.

196
00:17:30,085 --> 00:17:31,846
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like great for kids in their development.

197
00:17:33,307 --> 00:17:34,468
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do try my best.

198
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:36,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I do feel like slightly more confident.

199
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:41,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I think part of it is really just like, people want to see you give an effort and like communicating.

200
00:17:42,076 --> 00:17:44,418
[SPEAKER_02]: with them and if you can meet someone on their level.

201
00:17:44,818 --> 00:17:56,685
[SPEAKER_02]: In particular, yeah, I just don't think, even myself, as a native English speaker, you don't realize just how hard it is for someone who doesn't know English.

202
00:17:58,086 --> 00:18:06,090
[SPEAKER_02]: And English is not easy and we use so many colloquialisms and terms of phrase that's like, what are you saying?

203
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,173
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, in particular, I've been trying to try

204
00:18:10,938 --> 00:18:14,240
[SPEAKER_02]: understand more Spanish in regards to my work.

205
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:22,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause not only do you need to like learn a lot of language, but specific like industry language is hard to learn.

206
00:18:22,365 --> 00:18:28,089
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't even know everything there is to know about, you know, talking about transportation in Spanish in particular.

207
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:30,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

208
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,452
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine there's a lot of those words I wouldn't know in English.

209
00:18:34,753 --> 00:18:35,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

210
00:18:35,453 --> 00:18:36,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, how do you say urban planning?

211
00:18:36,914 --> 00:18:39,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, I know it's urban planning, but it's like, how do you really like,

212
00:18:40,757 --> 00:18:49,805
[SPEAKER_02]: get at the core of what you're trying to say, not just like this word that might mean something to us in English, but doesn't really translate well over into another language.

213
00:18:50,625 --> 00:19:01,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I think that kind of along that idea of accessibility for as many people as possible in the city, what have you observed about Medfair?

214
00:19:01,755 --> 00:19:08,681
[SPEAKER_01]: What sort of critiques do you have in terms of what we could do in terms of increasing accessibility and inclusivity?

215
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:14,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that is actually a big part of, I think, what I want to focus on for this campaign.

216
00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:26,643
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I think that really came to light for me, particularly working at non-profit Walk Massachusetts, very pedestrian-focused.

217
00:19:26,844 --> 00:19:36,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Pedestrian, technically, you know, sometimes cyclists, but really just non-car, like, cyclist movers, whether you're walking, you're playing, you have a mobility device.

218
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's the really, it's the basics, sidewalks.

219
00:19:43,093 --> 00:19:50,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I walk a lot in my neighborhood and sometimes I'll walk down like George Street all the way down to Main Street.

220
00:19:50,918 --> 00:19:56,621
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are like so many curbs that have no curb ramps.

221
00:19:57,161 --> 00:20:06,007
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I'm not, again, I'm not even using a mobility device, but I have short legs and sometimes these curbs, I'm like, these are a little like,

222
00:20:07,348 --> 00:20:11,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Rough around the edges, we have so many tree roots uprooting sidewalks.

223
00:20:12,012 --> 00:20:18,157
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think as much as people are like, well, yeah, everyone wants better sidewalk.

224
00:20:18,337 --> 00:20:27,104
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a hindrance to people who have just a little bit of struggle walking, have a cane or mobility device.

225
00:20:27,924 --> 00:20:31,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone like me who's just uncoordinated at times.

226
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, I mean, actually I didn't trip on a sidewalk.

227
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:36,722
[SPEAKER_02]: I tripped on my own porch and sprained my ankle.

228
00:20:36,742 --> 00:20:37,362
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was on me.

229
00:20:38,422 --> 00:20:43,504
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's a big one for me in particular, not just like, okay, is the sidewalk flat?

230
00:20:43,564 --> 00:20:46,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have curb ramps at every corner?

231
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:52,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Curb ramps with, you know, the tactile landing that also points in the correct direction.

232
00:20:52,107 --> 00:20:55,909
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many times you see those and they're like not even going the right way.

233
00:20:55,969 --> 00:21:01,351
[SPEAKER_02]: So if someone is vision impaired or has low vision, like they might be led into the wrong area.

234
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:16,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that plus no removal and like just debris in general, uh, big, big for me because I, you know, walk to the Greenline station when I go into work a couple of days a week.

235
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,503
[SPEAKER_02]: And this past winter in particular really made me mad.

236
00:21:20,123 --> 00:21:32,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and as someone who's kind of taken a peek behind the curtain in regards to like transportation, uh, a lot of what you might run into if you're walking around the city and there's not like snow removed.

237
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:41,081
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly like on a little bridge, like over the commuter rail, often it's jurisdiction like arguments.

238
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:46,443
[SPEAKER_02]: So MassDOT, my employer, owns that, you know, part of the sidewalk.

239
00:21:46,523 --> 00:21:55,067
[SPEAKER_02]: And understandably, most municipalities are going to stop where they have to stop because they don't have the money or the funds to like keep paying for the removal.

240
00:21:56,007 --> 00:22:00,269
[SPEAKER_02]: But in particular, this past winter, the sidewalk from like Nick's Pizza all the way

241
00:22:01,308 --> 00:22:08,474
[SPEAKER_02]: up until like right when they have the nice repaved sidewalk by the T station, just fully like a sheet of ice.

242
00:22:09,315 --> 00:22:13,818
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, you know, penguin walking to make sure I don't slip and fall.

243
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done it so many, I think I've done it every winter.

244
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:23,947
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I actually just started taking the bus up to the station because I knew that I would get, you know, avoid most of that.

245
00:22:24,047 --> 00:22:26,609
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, if I,

246
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw plenty of people walking over it, but it's like, we shouldn't have to do that first of all.

247
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:42,386
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we want to encourage people to walk more or just support people who need to walk for whatever reason, we have to do that at all times of the year.

248
00:22:43,346 --> 00:22:50,229
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, I feel like that's a great example of how adults, um, how like your like working life is impeded by that.

249
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:54,391
[SPEAKER_01]: But even kids like stroll, there's a, we live close to Fulton street.

250
00:22:54,411 --> 00:22:56,972
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a big hill and we have the, like the,

251
00:22:57,715 --> 00:23:05,941
[SPEAKER_01]: carrier thing on the back of our bikes for the kids, like the trailer thing, it doesn't fit between the telephone pole and the side of the street, like in some parts.

252
00:23:05,961 --> 00:23:09,103
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, then what, you have to go into Fulton Street.

253
00:23:09,243 --> 00:23:11,164
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, no, I've driven on Fulton Street, thanks.

254
00:23:11,404 --> 00:23:11,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

255
00:23:12,005 --> 00:23:12,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

256
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:15,227
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just like little things like that.

257
00:23:15,307 --> 00:23:22,352
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think part of what that looks like for me is like having the city complete an ADA transition plan.

258
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:26,237
[SPEAKER_02]: which would sort of lay out like, okay, where are our deficiencies?

259
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:33,140
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the city did do a kind of like a sidewalk inventory report in 2021, which did lay out everything.

260
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,763
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a matter of like, you know, committing the money and the like manpower to doing that.

261
00:23:39,283 --> 00:23:52,390
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also thinking about like, not just like for this transition plan, where do we need curb ramps, but like, what about our buildings, our recreation, like opportunities, like where are we failing to really be accessible

262
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,472
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just thinking about sort of like the physical accessibility.

263
00:23:55,512 --> 00:23:58,534
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not even thinking about like, you know, language.

264
00:24:00,695 --> 00:24:04,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have things that are like services that allow people to be involved?

265
00:24:05,138 --> 00:24:07,920
[SPEAKER_02]: If they have like other commitments, child, you know, childcare.

266
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:13,324
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as well, you know, thinking about people who are neurodivergent or just learn in different ways.

267
00:24:15,726 --> 00:24:17,207
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had

268
00:24:18,068 --> 00:24:21,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to say the privilege, but my sister is on the spectrum.

269
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:23,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I've worked a lot with people who are neurodivergent.

270
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:33,418
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've come to not understand, but I think really kind of get that picture of like what it's like when something really isn't clicking for whatever reason.

271
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:39,002
[SPEAKER_02]: And just, okay, how do we just rearrange how we explain this or offer this?

272
00:24:40,183 --> 00:24:45,987
[SPEAKER_02]: And even some folks who I've met in Medford who are on the spectrum or have different

273
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:53,303
[SPEAKER_02]: intellectual or developmental disabilities or like just the slight change.

274
00:24:53,343 --> 00:25:08,370
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we kind of become inclusive and accessible for what seems like a small population, but it's not, we actually are just making it easier for everyone involved and to understand what's going on.

275
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:13,011
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just for this like specific group, but we're actually making it better for everyone.

276
00:25:13,372 --> 00:25:16,653
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when sidewalks are smooth, someone in a wheelchair can use them.

277
00:25:17,228 --> 00:25:28,592
[SPEAKER_02]: but it also means like, as you get older, if you want to keep living in Medford, you don't have to worry about tripping and then like needing a full knee replacement as a result.

278
00:25:29,753 --> 00:25:31,713
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's something I always keep in mind.

279
00:25:31,793 --> 00:25:36,255
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not just for people who need it now, but we're all going to need it at some point.

280
00:25:37,315 --> 00:25:37,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

281
00:25:37,556 --> 00:25:38,756
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a good, uh,

282
00:25:39,321 --> 00:25:58,470
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully non-political issue for folks because I think it's those, not to generalize, but I think in a lot of cities, it's the older folks that maybe aren't, don't perceive themselves as benefiting as much from the city services that are more hesitant to like vote for an override or wanna put money into different things.

283
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:01,932
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a good example of something that would help everyone.

284
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:03,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

285
00:26:06,512 --> 00:26:14,056
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other sort of hopes for like how your time on city council could positively impact our city?

286
00:26:15,237 --> 00:26:15,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

287
00:26:16,757 --> 00:26:20,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I want, I think this kind of, for me, falls under accessibility too.

288
00:26:20,099 --> 00:26:24,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I want more benches, more places for people to sit and rest.

289
00:26:25,842 --> 00:26:28,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Ideally, I'd want like a bench at every bus stop.

290
00:26:28,663 --> 00:26:29,824
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care where that bus stop is.

291
00:26:29,944 --> 00:26:30,684
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a bench there.

292
00:26:32,005 --> 00:26:35,907
[SPEAKER_02]: And the hill I'll die on is I don't want a bench with an armrest in the middle.

293
00:26:38,411 --> 00:27:05,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I, if listeners have not heard of the term hostile architecture, sort of the kind of approach to architecture and like seating that lends itself to not letting people lay down or we don't want people loitering for whatever reason in this area.

294
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:13,535
[SPEAKER_02]: And what might seem like, oh, well, we don't want certain people in and around here, which I don't care about.

295
00:27:13,935 --> 00:27:26,602
[SPEAKER_02]: But even if that was your thing, all that kind of infrastructure or lack thereof, like in New York City, is it Moynihan station where they just took everything out?

296
00:27:26,662 --> 00:27:29,143
[SPEAKER_02]: One of their train stations, super busy.

297
00:27:30,443 --> 00:27:31,103
[SPEAKER_02]: just no seating.

298
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:33,865
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, we're just not going to have anyone sit here.

299
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:41,910
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, okay, but if I went there and I have four kids and we each have bags, like that's hurting me.

300
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:45,812
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm elderly and need somewhere to rest, that's hurting me.

301
00:27:47,113 --> 00:27:52,636
[SPEAKER_02]: If I broke my leg and I'm on crutches right now, that's going to negatively affect me.

302
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:54,957
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want benches everywhere.

303
00:27:55,198 --> 00:27:57,639
[SPEAKER_02]: And if people need to lay down on them, that's fine with me.

304
00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:01,195
[SPEAKER_01]: I never thought about that design flaw.

305
00:28:01,635 --> 00:28:09,543
[SPEAKER_01]: I work in Central Square in Cambridge and we have a big population of people who use drugs and they started to redo this area.

306
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:18,972
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not exactly sure what the plan is but it's where everybody would hang out during the day and I think that was just not pleasing to people but what I noticed is since they've shut that down

307
00:28:19,753 --> 00:28:24,797
[SPEAKER_01]: people just are going into the subway to use drugs, which I feel like is way more dangerous.

308
00:28:25,358 --> 00:28:26,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody will see them if they overdose.

309
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:27,440
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be hard.

310
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,241
[SPEAKER_01]: They could fall into the train tracks, right?

311
00:28:29,301 --> 00:28:39,430
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, yeah, that idea of taking these options away from people because it's not what we want to see, it doesn't mean it's not there, right?

312
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,350
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not helping the public.

313
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:40,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, yeah.

314
00:28:41,351 --> 00:28:42,472
[SPEAKER_01]: People aren't going to go anywhere.

315
00:28:42,492 --> 00:28:46,696
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just going to go somewhere else, and anyone deserves help.

316
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:59,453
[SPEAKER_02]: strong believer in the tenets of harm reduction and the ways that that looks in terms of municipal policy.

317
00:28:59,853 --> 00:29:08,716
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, no, being on benches, I was actually able to get, we got a grant when I was still at the city for bus infrastructure improvement.

318
00:29:08,756 --> 00:29:18,380
[SPEAKER_02]: So the bus shelter that's across the street from Dempsey's and sort of near Elta Cuba, like across the corner from, or across from the cemetery,

319
00:29:18,867 --> 00:29:20,487
[SPEAKER_02]: by City Hall, we got those.

320
00:29:21,568 --> 00:29:29,629
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I believe on Salem Street, if you see like, there's like four or five like benches that are kind of like brownish in color, bought those.

321
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:36,871
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was very adamant that I was going to get these and not have them have an armrest in the middle.

322
00:29:37,791 --> 00:29:44,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I even actually was able to get the bus shelters when we talked with the TEAS team about getting them because they have the contract we could hop on.

323
00:29:45,413 --> 00:29:47,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I had said, I want that bar removed.

324
00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:49,248
[SPEAKER_02]: and we got it removed.

325
00:29:49,348 --> 00:29:53,392
[SPEAKER_02]: They were very surprised and I think I was the first person who ever requested it, but I was happy to do it.

326
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,974
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want more of those.

327
00:29:56,634 --> 00:29:57,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

328
00:29:58,355 --> 00:29:58,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

329
00:30:00,697 --> 00:30:16,670
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's not like rare, but I think that it sounds like as a social worker myself, that the approach of a city official, it seems more in line with, I mean, I think philosophically like somebody who's here to help people and really thinking thoughtfully about

330
00:30:17,505 --> 00:30:25,107
[SPEAKER_01]: those, what those actual needs are versus like somebody who's running for city council as a politician, right?

331
00:30:25,147 --> 00:30:27,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so I appreciate that.

332
00:30:27,628 --> 00:30:35,070
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate this, the really thoughtful and like specific ideas around how to help as many people as you can.

333
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:36,331
Thanks.

334
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:37,691
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

335
00:30:38,652 --> 00:30:43,793
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know when I finally, like, I think it's one of those things where you're like, Oh, I think I've always believed this.

336
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:44,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't always have the words.

337
00:30:46,648 --> 00:30:54,951
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, in particular, growing up in LA and being in school on the East Coast, you know, last eight years, I've gone back and forth so many times.

338
00:30:55,711 --> 00:31:00,173
[SPEAKER_02]: One, I just see the increasing amount of people who are unhoused when I visit LA.

339
00:31:00,213 --> 00:31:04,695
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not that it's not a thing here, it's just LA is insanely populated.

340
00:31:06,415 --> 00:31:07,916
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not going anywhere.

341
00:31:08,976 --> 00:31:16,299
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, encampments are happening because there's so many, even if there is like mobile homes offered

342
00:31:17,266 --> 00:31:23,231
[SPEAKER_02]: To people who need it, there's so many qualifiers to getting that housing.

343
00:31:24,012 --> 00:31:33,941
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we're going to put so many qualifiers on someone else's housing, but we're not putting those on ourselves, I think that's a huge disconnect.

344
00:31:34,241 --> 00:31:41,347
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we're putting all these qualifiers on someone who just needs a place to stay, I mean, it's the basic hierarchy of needs.

345
00:31:41,447 --> 00:31:44,650
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have shelter, food,

346
00:31:46,018 --> 00:31:49,301
[SPEAKER_02]: safe shelter, consistent food, and food that you want.

347
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:55,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not here to tell you what you can and can't spend your SNAP benefits on.

348
00:31:58,251 --> 00:31:59,332
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the basics, right?

349
00:31:59,433 --> 00:32:06,060
[SPEAKER_02]: If we get people this, what they need, and if everyone has what they need, we're all safe.

350
00:32:07,684 --> 00:32:14,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do think that a lot of our policies as a country, as a state, are based around this moral judgment of people.

351
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:18,833
[SPEAKER_01]: If you fit the mold of who we think should be housed, then we'll house you.

352
00:32:18,893 --> 00:32:22,996
[SPEAKER_01]: But if not, then you deserve to be on the street, which is awful.

353
00:32:23,016 --> 00:32:25,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's really cool.

354
00:32:25,718 --> 00:32:28,520
[SPEAKER_01]: I never thought about the way you could affect

355
00:32:30,277 --> 00:32:33,360
[SPEAKER_01]: change as a city planner in that way.

356
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,000
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.

357
00:32:34,761 --> 00:32:43,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, sometimes, you know, it's really, especially at the state level, even it's not even the federal level, but I feel like we're such a globalized world now that it's like, what am I doing?

358
00:32:45,209 --> 00:32:49,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Even, you know, like as a one person in this ether, am I even doing anything?

359
00:32:50,273 --> 00:32:54,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Every now and then I walk or drive by, see the benches or the bus shelter.

360
00:32:54,636 --> 00:32:56,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, one time I did drive by one of the shelters and

361
00:32:57,025 --> 00:32:59,306
[SPEAKER_02]: someone was laying down and it was like towards the evening.

362
00:32:59,466 --> 00:33:02,947
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just like, yes, lay down, please.

363
00:33:03,027 --> 00:33:09,789
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cause I mean, I'm lucky enough to have never experienced homelessness myself, but I've, you know, faced housing insecurity.

364
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,770
[SPEAKER_02]: My father was homeless.

365
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:15,231
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, at the end of the day, we're all just humans trying to live.

366
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:22,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I, anyone I see on the street, who's like struggling to find a like comfortable place to sleep.

367
00:33:22,214 --> 00:33:26,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, why am I going to make their life so much harder when they're clearly already

368
00:33:27,185 --> 00:33:32,806
[SPEAKER_02]: at a pretty rough point, and if they wanna lay down, who am I to sit here and police that?

369
00:33:33,486 --> 00:33:34,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, wow.

370
00:33:36,607 --> 00:33:39,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I really enjoyed hearing about this.

371
00:33:39,287 --> 00:33:45,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything that you wanna plug, any campaign events or things that we should know about, website, anything like that?

372
00:33:45,468 --> 00:33:53,170
[SPEAKER_02]: My website will be done this week, I think, but I am having a Meet the Candidate event this Sunday.

373
00:33:54,778 --> 00:34:00,963
[SPEAKER_02]: at, I don't even know how to say the street name, 7 Ronaleigh, Ronaleigh.

374
00:34:02,104 --> 00:34:06,968
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go to bit.ly slash meet dash Miranda.

375
00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:10,952
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's, it looks like a form that you have to donate on.

376
00:34:10,992 --> 00:34:14,575
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't, there's like a little free RSVP that has the address.

377
00:34:15,696 --> 00:34:19,499
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I want it Northwest-ish Medford.

378

[SPEAKER_02]: So,

379
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:25,435

380

382
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:41,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how plugged in I'll be on the social medias, but can't find me there.

383
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:43,340
[SPEAKER_02]: I might be at Altacuba or hanging out with my cat.

384
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,060
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

385
