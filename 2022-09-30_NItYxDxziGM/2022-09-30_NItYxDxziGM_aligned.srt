1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:00,330
I'm

2
00:01:51,173 --> 00:01:55,777
Hey Jonathan, how do we help out people who are trying to donate money?

3
00:01:55,977 --> 00:01:56,338
Huh?

4
00:01:56,618 --> 00:01:58,480
How do we help out people who are trying to donate money?

5
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,802
Um, there's a jar inside actually.

6
00:02:00,842 --> 00:02:04,725
Yeah, or if it's easier you can go to the vendor.

7
00:02:04,745 --> 00:02:06,286
Yeah, no, that's fine.

8
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:09,009
Yeah, so there's a jar, there's a jar for cash donation inside.

9
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:09,829
Oh, okay, thanks.

10
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:10,009
Yeah.

11
00:02:19,478 --> 00:02:21,981
We'll probably be another five minutes or so.

12
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:24,204
You've got a little bit of time.

13
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:25,746
Do you want a snack, Dad?

14
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:26,707
What do we have for snacks?

15
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:28,189
Pretzels, chips, popcorn.

16
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:41,619
All right.

17
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,721
So if we do have to do it.

18
00:03:07,705 --> 00:03:07,985
Okay.

19
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,232
The cool kids hang out on the ramp there.

20
00:04:07,494 --> 00:04:08,157
I'm picking up.

21
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:18,833
It looks like everything's fine until it starts.

22
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:24,718
It's like when you're playing short stuff and the pitcher hasn't pitched yet, hasn't thrown anything yet.

23
00:04:24,758 --> 00:04:26,499
The first note, all power goes out.

24
00:04:43,336 --> 00:04:50,506
The band swung so hard, it ruined the entire concert.

25
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:53,810
The jam was too smooth, so they went personal again.

26
00:04:56,598 --> 00:04:57,759
Blue is the jazz club.

27
00:05:18,197 --> 00:05:20,619
When I first started, I used to get gel.

28
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:50,213
Here, here.

29
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:52,014
You press a color, you know.

30
00:05:52,054 --> 00:06:00,500
It's like, even a songwriter can do it.

31
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:07,724
Honestly, yeah, like the mic, it's kind of like, it's fine, because it's like roughly where, in between the keys and the drums.

32
00:06:08,024 --> 00:06:14,288
At the end of the day, like I said, like, the sound stuff, more concert sound.

33
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,279
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

34
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,101
My name is Terry Cotter.

35
00:06:41,381 --> 00:06:45,202
I manage elder services here at the West Medford Community Center.

36
00:06:46,943 --> 00:06:49,924
I'm also the Poet Laureate of Medford, Massachusetts.

37
00:06:54,389 --> 00:07:05,708
I won't get into the whole story because we'll talk again when we come up to play, but I want to introduce you to a friend of mine, a kindred spirit, a guy who's

38
00:07:06,937 --> 00:07:27,433
musical abilities I appreciate so much and someone who has, you know, kind of taught me some things about how we can collaborate and cooperate and get together and do things that are meaningful without looking at each other suspiciously or as if we have ulterior motives or anything like that.

39
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:33,678
So the convener, one of the original conveners of the Medford Jazz Festival,

40
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:37,390
And we're hosting it for the first time outside.

41
00:07:38,012 --> 00:07:40,541
My friend, Jonathan Fagan.

42
00:07:44,517 --> 00:07:45,657
Thank you so much, Terry.

43
00:07:46,058 --> 00:07:48,879
It's always a blast to get introduced by a poet laureate.

44
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,959
I don't know how many of you have had that experience.

45
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,060
Maybe not very many.

46
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,941
But anyways, yes.

47
00:07:54,361 --> 00:07:55,421
My name is Jonathan Fagan.

48
00:07:55,481 --> 00:08:01,103
I'm the producer of the Medford Jazz Festival, which has actually been going on for quite some time.

49
00:08:01,183 --> 00:08:06,805
I joke with my friends that it started in Peter Cobb's laundromat about four years ago.

50
00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:09,006
It was a place called Wash Vault Lab.

51
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:11,167
It's on Boston Avenue in Medford.

52
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:13,688
That was my first collaboration with, here, let me just,

53
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:16,412
get this out of the way.

54
00:08:18,536 --> 00:08:25,400
Medford Arts Council, and then that in turn led us to collaborate with Arts Alive Foundation, who's one of our primary sponsors this year.

55
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:36,645
We launched a Patreon page three years ago, and of course, we were planning on doing the first festival in 2020, but well, 2020 was an interesting year for many reasons.

56
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:41,628
So we streamed the whole thing from Bopstop Studios near Medford Center.

57
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:47,851
Thank you so much to George Tresk and all of our tech people that helped us with that, including Nathan Montgomery, who's

58
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:49,632
running cameras tonight.

59
00:08:49,652 --> 00:08:51,493
Yes, please.

60
00:08:52,174 --> 00:09:00,319
And so this is, you know, this has been going on for some time, but it's so exciting to finally have a live event.

61
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:08,564
So I really appreciate all of you coming and braving the cold weather to, you know, just really have a live audience tonight.

62
00:09:08,644 --> 00:09:15,909
And thank you also to those on the stream, which has been put together generously by Medford Community Media over there with Kevin Harrington.

63
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:21,877
Oh, she's okay.

64
00:09:22,698 --> 00:09:26,203
Thank you also to my father Avi Fagan for providing the sound.

65
00:09:27,745 --> 00:09:31,330
I've been joking with people earlier today that I'm kind of bringing him out of retirement here.

66
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:31,791
Yeah.

67
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:39,351
Which, that's the plus of having your dad be a sound engineer, is you can, yes, you have the secret weapon.

68
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:40,451
Really.

69
00:09:40,911 --> 00:09:43,893
So, a couple of other people to thank.

70
00:09:43,913 --> 00:09:49,955
Of course, Terry Carter, for putting together this partnership with the West Medford Community Center.

71
00:09:50,116 --> 00:09:54,498
It's been amazing to just have his support at pretty much every juncture of this.

72
00:09:55,238 --> 00:09:59,660
And to the executive director, Lisa, who I believe will be...

73
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,219
Oh, she's on the run.

74
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:01,619
Okay.

75
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:02,680
Busy person.

76
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,061
Executive director.

77
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:07,524
And finally to our sponsors themselves.

78
00:10:08,364 --> 00:10:22,255
Starting with the people that are in our Patreon subscription who pay a couple dollars each month and they really do help raise money for events like this and also our monthly jam sessions which we've been doing quite a few of actually over the past year.

79
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:23,156
We've had

80
00:10:23,596 --> 00:10:25,478
between five and six over the past year.

81
00:10:25,498 --> 00:10:32,484
It's a great opportunity for a lot of adult students to get to play with professionals and for local musicians to network.

82
00:10:32,524 --> 00:10:34,907
There is so much talent here in the Medford area.

83
00:10:35,047 --> 00:10:41,633
It's still surprising to me every single month that we do it and someone shows up and great players.

84
00:10:43,134 --> 00:10:47,058
Thank you also to the Arts Alive Foundation, which is run by Mae Marbeck.

85
00:10:47,990 --> 00:11:11,710
which has donated quite a bit to help make this possible and expand this into a two-day festival, to the Medford Arts Council for their continued support, to CACHE, which is a really wonderful organization here in Medford that connects a lot of artistic people to each other, and to the Mystic River Watershed Association, which really stepped in and also made this possible.

86
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,478
So I hope I'm not forgetting anybody.

87
00:11:16,518 --> 00:11:17,419
I don't think I am.

88
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:21,023
We have had a lot of support this year, which is amazing.

89
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:24,107
Last, just a couple housekeeping things.

90
00:11:24,187 --> 00:11:28,232
Bathrooms are inside, obviously, along with a donation.

91
00:11:29,493 --> 00:11:33,477
A donation jar if you feel moved by what you see and hear today.

92
00:11:33,977 --> 00:11:35,538
Please consider donating to us.

93
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:37,220
Really everything does matter.

94
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,583
I know it's a cliche, but a couple dollars at a time is how we've gotten to where we are.

95
00:11:42,524 --> 00:11:50,371
There are CDs for sale and books for sale inside by both Terry and I. And there are snacks available for purchase for just a couple dollars each.

96
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:56,015
And I believe there will be some hot chocolate and coffee out there later.

97
00:11:57,276 --> 00:12:14,648
So without further ado, I will introduce this first group, which is actually an ensemble of adult students that I've had the pleasure of working with over the past couple years over at Morningside Music Studio in Arlington, calling this the Beacon Blue Jazz Quintet.

98
00:12:14,808 --> 00:12:16,850
So why don't you guys come on up and we'll get started.

99
00:13:23,711 --> 00:13:36,635
One, two, one, two, three, four.

100
00:14:33,121 --> 00:14:33,482
you

101
00:15:19,705 --> 00:15:19,765
do

102
00:16:24,603 --> 00:16:31,567
Background music playing.

103
00:17:02,608 --> 00:17:03,188
The end.

104
00:17:33,237 --> 00:17:34,458
Great, thanks.

105
00:17:35,159 --> 00:17:35,679
Oh.

106
00:17:35,739 --> 00:17:37,381
Great, thanks.

107
00:17:37,421 --> 00:17:42,605
Should we put my mic on?

108
00:18:00,425 --> 00:18:00,825
Oh, great.

109
00:18:00,885 --> 00:18:01,326
There we go.

110
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:02,647
Thank you so much.

111
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,589
That was a Grant Green composition called Flood in Franklin Park.

112
00:18:07,109 --> 00:18:09,171
Let me just take a second to introduce this band.

113
00:18:09,191 --> 00:18:11,993
So we have Jeff Hopwood on the trumpet over there.

114
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:15,735
Steven Weber on the saxophone.

115
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:18,797
David Sands on the bass.

116
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,219
Bill Kuklinski on guitar.

117
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:28,944
And Mike Chen is all the way over there, hidden a little bit by the lights, but holding it down on drums.

118
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:35,455
And I'm still Jonathan Fagan, and I play piano.

119
00:18:35,995 --> 00:18:44,178
We're going to do one of my favorite things to do as both an educator and just as an all-around musician is to have my students write things.

120
00:18:44,838 --> 00:18:51,640
And I feel like our trumpet player, Jeff, has definitely taken up that challenge to a different level this year.

121
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,221
And so he calls this one One Beer Blues.

122
00:18:54,921 --> 00:18:59,963
Because as he explained it to me, when you have one beer, you're not feeling so great.

123
00:19:00,023 --> 00:19:04,624
It's only when you get past that point that things tend to improve.

124
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,424
Is that a correct paraphrase?

125
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:08,285
OK, yeah, there we go.

126
00:19:08,785 --> 00:19:12,326
So this is the, I mean, well, we'll see where it goes.

127
00:19:12,406 --> 00:19:15,687
Maybe it'll evolve into two-beer territory, but we'll see.

128
00:19:16,227 --> 00:19:17,948
So the one-beer blues, here we go.

129
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:31,743
One, two, one, two, three, four.

130
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:02,501
do do

131
00:22:00,366 --> 00:22:00,527
you

132
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:37,285
Mm hmm.

133
00:24:41,776 --> 00:24:44,117
All right, The One Beer Blues by Jeff Hopwood.

134
00:24:44,597 --> 00:24:46,017
We're going to play one of mine now.

135
00:24:47,258 --> 00:24:52,660
When I can, I love giving my groups some of my compositions just to think about.

136
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,281
This one is called The Dreamcatcher.

137
00:24:54,881 --> 00:24:58,963
It was written right after, well, a couple days after I saw Kenny Garrett.

138
00:25:00,303 --> 00:25:03,565
It's a great alto saxophone player who's inspired me in a number of ways.

139
00:25:04,385 --> 00:25:08,567
So it has some hints of Kenny Garrett in it, but probably a number of other things, too.

140
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,412
Music Music

141
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,080
Music playing

142
00:27:31,668 --> 00:27:37,674
Music playing

143
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:22,902
Music playing

144
00:31:40,714 --> 00:31:40,854
you

145
00:32:16,792 --> 00:32:24,275
All right, we're going to do, well, all of the tunes that we've been working on recently are totally different in some ways.

146
00:32:24,315 --> 00:32:25,255
As a matter of fact, yes.

147
00:32:25,395 --> 00:32:26,616
As a matter of fact, yes.

148
00:32:26,776 --> 00:32:32,278
This next one actually was brought in by our guitar player, Bill Kuklinski.

149
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:33,218
You were there, too.

150
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:34,179
I was there, too.

151
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:35,359
That is true.

152
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:40,962
I was going to say, Bill and I a couple of years ago went on one of Morningside Music Studios

153
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:55,197
basically music tours and we ended up in Venice with an amazing vocalist named Sheila Jordan but along the way we also met a bass player named Alvise Seiji who wrote this tune and

154
00:32:56,465 --> 00:32:59,107
Well, Bill was the one that still had the music, somehow.

155
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:07,933
Because he liked the song, and he remembers to keep things on, like me, sometimes.

156
00:33:08,794 --> 00:33:09,694
So we're going to play it for you.

157
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:11,196
This one's called African Colors.

158
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:15,919
And then after that, we're going to do a Hoagy Carmichael ballad, which is one of my favorites.

159
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:17,340
That one's called The Nearness of You.

160
00:42:48,007 --> 00:42:48,227
do

161
00:43:12,668 --> 00:43:12,788
So,

162
00:44:50,723 --> 00:45:09,374
All right that one again featured David Sands on the bass.

163
00:45:14,275 --> 00:45:18,099
And also, I guess, Jeff Hopwood on the trumpet with the melody.

164
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:18,699
What the heck?

165
00:45:18,739 --> 00:45:20,461
I'll just introduce the whole band one more time.

166
00:45:20,481 --> 00:45:21,642
They're great.

167
00:45:22,462 --> 00:45:28,188
No, truly, this is a highlight of my week every time we get together.

168
00:45:28,528 --> 00:45:30,790
Bill Kuklinski on the guitar, again.

169
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:32,592
And Mike Channis on the drums.

170
00:45:33,837 --> 00:45:35,297
We're going to do one more tune for you.

171
00:45:35,337 --> 00:45:39,819
This one was suggested by our bass player, but some of you may recognize it as well.

172
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,260
This is a Miles Davis composition called Walking.

173
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:46,481
And then after that, please stick around to hear the Ally Project.

174
00:45:47,301 --> 00:45:48,902
Warm up inside if you have to.

175
00:45:49,182 --> 00:45:56,344
The rumor goes that there's hot chocolate and coffee and maybe some other things in there, including books and CDs.

176
00:45:56,424 --> 00:45:58,264
Shameless personal plug there.

177
00:46:00,845 --> 00:46:10,992
Yeah, please consider, again, if you like what you hear, please consider joining our Patreon page or donating to the Medford Jazz Festival, which is on Venmo, and also we accept cash donations.

178
00:46:11,672 --> 00:46:14,794
All right, so here we go.

179
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:19,658
We'll see how fast we can play this, given how cold our hands are at this particular moment.

180
00:52:10,822 --> 00:52:11,142
do do

181
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,503
All right, again, thank you so much.

182
00:52:47,544 --> 00:52:49,288
The Beacon Blue Jazz Quintet.

183
00:52:50,552 --> 00:52:54,001
Featuring Stephen Webber, Jeff Hopwood, David Sands, Phil Clinton.

184
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,702
Why did I just realize this at the very, very end?

185
00:53:02,182 --> 00:53:02,803
Great, all right.

186
00:53:05,024 --> 00:53:07,606
Musicians can only count up to four, that's the saying.

187
00:53:08,187 --> 00:53:19,395
So anyways, please stick around, warm up, get a snack, explore the inside of the iconic West Bedford Community Center, and be back in about 10 to 15 minutes for the Ally Project.

188
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:28,627
You know, that's me because I've never done that.

189
00:53:28,647 --> 00:53:30,491
I was following instructions.

190
00:53:30,531 --> 00:53:30,912
You did.

191
00:53:30,992 --> 00:53:32,755
You told me and I still didn't respond.

192
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,321
Thank you.

193
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:08,618
Good to see you.

194
00:54:08,658 --> 00:54:09,718
Glad you made it.

195
00:54:09,738 --> 00:54:10,579
Very good.

196
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:12,039
Go inside and get a little heat.

197
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,781
How you doing?

198
00:54:42,463 --> 00:54:47,226
You guys want to go inside and get warm for a few minutes?

199
00:55:12,555 --> 00:55:13,236
Thank you.

200
00:55:47,827 --> 00:55:48,447
Hey, hey.

201
00:55:48,968 --> 00:55:49,348
Hey, hey.

202
00:55:49,508 --> 00:55:50,348
One, two, two.

203
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:51,989
Two, two.

204
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,272
Hey, hey, one, two, two.

205
00:56:17,312 --> 00:56:19,352
So you're Jonathan's father?

206
00:56:19,372 --> 00:56:20,153
I am, yeah.

207
00:56:20,273 --> 00:56:20,633
Wow.

208
00:56:21,133 --> 00:56:23,774
You look like you're his older brother or something.

209
00:56:23,834 --> 00:56:23,994
Go on.

210
00:56:24,034 --> 00:56:25,575
Hey, hey, one, two, two.

211
00:56:25,695 --> 00:56:29,216
I am 70, so I guess I could be your father.

212
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,822
If you're not getting paid, you're retired.

213
00:57:17,782 --> 00:57:20,264
Hey, hey, one, two, two, two, two, two.

214
00:57:20,284 --> 00:57:21,365
Awesome, awesome.

215
00:57:49,728 --> 00:57:50,408
Thank you.

216
00:58:11,685 --> 00:58:15,448
On that song, I don't do much.

217
00:58:15,528 --> 00:58:18,130
I just kind of throw it out there.

218
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:21,592
What you're going to do is have to really listen.

219
00:58:42,729 --> 00:58:43,032
Yeah.

220
00:59:03,514 --> 00:59:04,275
We're hanging out.

221
00:59:29,701 --> 00:59:30,402
How are you kids?

222
01:00:02,921 --> 01:00:03,784
Oh, it's a wild card, right?

223
01:00:35,934 --> 01:00:40,197
I finally came and bought a stand light.

224
01:00:40,237 --> 01:00:50,043
It's funny, I played with this guy, just, you know, like folk music, but he's like, you know, it's all arranged.

225
01:00:50,123 --> 01:00:53,785
It's like, you're playing like the Rhymes, you know?

226
01:00:54,145 --> 01:00:56,086
It's like, you can't see any of the charts.

227
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:59,849
It's like, I'm like, okay, I gotta finally get one of these.

228
01:01:00,069 --> 01:01:03,711
I managed to avoid it for however many years I've been playing Rhymes.

229
01:01:05,648 --> 01:01:06,470
Nice.

230
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:07,071
Yeah.

231
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:38,911
My bass has been through worse than this.

232
01:02:00,231 --> 01:02:02,755
The seam is starting to open up a little bit

233
01:02:15,182 --> 01:02:19,123
But the back is just coming slightly unglued.

234
01:02:19,783 --> 01:02:28,046
And it's like, you know, it's not getting any worse, but that's the kind of thing they could like, you know, south quickly.

235
01:02:28,126 --> 01:02:31,067
So I'd rather just get it taken care of.

236
01:02:31,107 --> 01:02:34,908
You know, luckily I only have one upright piece.

237
01:02:36,408 --> 01:02:36,849
Yeah, man.

238
01:02:51,505 --> 01:02:57,126
That's like, that's like, yeah, that's like, you know, it's bad.

239
01:02:57,226 --> 01:02:58,187
It's bad.

240
01:02:58,287 --> 01:03:01,107
It's like, it's just like, it's in a word.

241
01:03:01,127 --> 01:03:01,888
Yeah, I dig it.

242
01:03:01,928 --> 01:03:05,028
It looks like, it looks like I look over here and out of it.

243
01:03:05,108 --> 01:03:05,609
The lights.

244
01:03:05,629 --> 01:03:06,129
Yeah, cool.

245
01:03:20,253 --> 01:03:20,513
Yeah.

246
01:03:52,936 --> 01:03:53,997
Hi, are you Linda?

247
01:03:54,017 --> 01:03:54,137
Yes.

248
01:03:54,157 --> 01:03:54,837
What happened?

249
01:03:54,877 --> 01:03:55,917
I need a stand.

250
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:57,438
I thought we were in the lobby.

251
01:03:58,018 --> 01:03:59,939
This is your monitor.

252
01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:00,619
Oh, OK.

253
01:04:00,659 --> 01:04:01,900
So I'll be on this side?

254
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:02,280
I guess so.

255
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:02,460
OK.

256
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,821
Do you have another stand for me?

257
01:04:05,401 --> 01:04:07,102
Let me check with Jonathan.

258
01:04:07,142 --> 01:04:08,102
That one might be available.

259
01:04:08,182 --> 01:04:09,482
The one sitting downstairs there.

260
01:04:09,502 --> 01:04:10,443
Hey, Jonathan.

261
01:04:10,483 --> 01:04:11,803
Jonathan, Linda needs a music stand.

262
01:04:12,704 --> 01:04:13,544
Another music stand?

263
01:04:13,984 --> 01:04:14,264
Yeah.

264
01:04:14,564 --> 01:04:20,427
Yeah, we got this one over here.

265
01:04:20,447 --> 01:04:20,867
That's perfect.

266
01:04:20,887 --> 01:04:20,987
Do it.

267
01:04:21,007 --> 01:04:21,227
Do it.

268
01:04:21,307 --> 01:04:21,447
Do it.

269
01:04:22,961 --> 01:04:24,941
Yeah, they should only need one.

270
01:04:24,981 --> 01:04:27,842
So, I think that's good.

271
01:04:27,962 --> 01:04:29,922
I know it's not a good one.

272
01:04:30,042 --> 01:04:31,103
It's a little louder.

273
01:04:31,123 --> 01:04:32,703
It's a little louder.

274
01:04:32,803 --> 01:04:33,463
One more monitor?

275
01:04:33,503 --> 01:04:33,643
Yeah.

276
01:04:50,632 --> 01:04:53,033
I always like to, if you're going to pray, to pray.

277
01:04:53,273 --> 01:04:58,614
That's right, I forgot that that one.

278
01:04:58,634 --> 01:04:59,034
Try that.

279
01:04:59,094 --> 01:05:00,535
Right, right, right.

280
01:05:00,615 --> 01:05:01,715
That's good, nice.

281
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:05,016
Hey Tyler, come here.

282
01:05:05,156 --> 01:05:08,977
As you can hear, Terry and all, do you want to look at Terry and yours?

283
01:05:15,067 --> 01:05:19,190
I should be able to hear him beside me, right?

284
01:05:20,131 --> 01:05:22,412
No, he's talking and then I'm just singing with him.

285
01:05:22,573 --> 01:05:24,174
Yeah, we're in the same time.

286
01:05:24,234 --> 01:05:25,395
Yeah, a little background.

287
01:05:25,435 --> 01:05:27,676
We'll be singing a few lines together.

288
01:05:27,736 --> 01:05:28,637
Yeah, it'll be a vibe.

289
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,028
Yeah.

290
01:05:55,248 --> 01:05:55,348
Yeah.

291
01:06:06,849 --> 01:06:08,831
So we'll bring you up to reprise, okay?

292
01:06:08,911 --> 01:06:13,614
Okay, and then we'll do a couple other pieces, and then we'll go up to legacy, okay?

293
01:06:13,714 --> 01:06:14,695
And then toward the back.

294
01:06:14,795 --> 01:06:15,535
Okay, you got it all?

295
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:16,736
Okay, okay, well you can.

296
01:06:33,302 --> 01:06:34,182
Yeah, I finally got it, man.

297
01:06:34,222 --> 01:06:35,463
Yeah, I got it just this month.

298
01:07:01,406 --> 01:07:02,407
Good to go?

299
01:07:02,467 --> 01:07:02,947
I figured.

300
01:07:02,967 --> 01:07:04,087
Yeah, it's all good.

301
01:07:04,227 --> 01:07:05,288
I'm way ahead of you.

302
01:07:27,498 --> 01:07:29,599
So Nathan, just all me the whole night.

303
01:07:29,619 --> 01:07:30,939
You got it?

304
01:07:30,959 --> 01:07:31,199
Perfect.

305
01:07:31,239 --> 01:07:32,660
I got to post it on Instagram.

306
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:37,041
Yeah, I'm going to zoom in on your right hand.

307
01:07:37,181 --> 01:07:37,361
Yes.

308
01:07:37,421 --> 01:07:37,682
Perfect.

309
01:07:37,702 --> 01:07:38,142
Perfect.

310
01:08:44,215 --> 01:08:45,662
I can't really stand that.

311
01:09:41,409 --> 01:09:48,174
I've been painting my apartment all day, man.

312
01:09:48,214 --> 01:09:53,917
My hand is like... I didn't realize how tired my hand was cramping up earlier.

313
01:10:04,222 --> 01:10:06,023
We won't protect it anymore.

314
01:10:06,043 --> 01:10:08,145
That's how you know the intermission is over.

315
01:10:08,165 --> 01:10:09,726
You don't want to miss this.

316
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:35,200
So

317
01:10:53,973 --> 01:10:56,814
Thanks for hanging in with us.

318
01:10:57,074 --> 01:11:03,456
We're back here trying to talk about being a little bit chilly, but it's cold.

319
01:11:04,516 --> 01:11:05,937
I mean, it's cold.

320
01:11:06,237 --> 01:11:11,598
But it's been a warm night, and the Beacon Blues Band was real nice.

321
01:11:11,618 --> 01:11:15,039
They got us started out well, and we really appreciate that.

322
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:19,981
I want to just remember to thank our sponsors once again.

323
01:11:21,021 --> 01:11:31,306
the host and the provider of this lovely venue, the West Medford Community Center Incorporated, my home.

324
01:11:32,387 --> 01:11:48,335
I also want to thank the Arts Alive Medford Foundation, the Mystic River Watershed Association, Cache Medford Arts Council, and a special thank you to Kevin Harrington,

325
01:11:49,135 --> 01:11:59,841
from Method Community Media and Kyle Douglas who is here working and Kat Darnell who all came over to make sure that we could do a live stream and a YouTube.

326
01:12:00,021 --> 01:12:12,227
So for those of you that are out there watching this on your computers, your laptops, your television on 3 or 47, we appreciate, we appreciate you being with us.

327
01:12:13,047 --> 01:12:24,316
As Jonathan said earlier, Medford Jazz Festival also has a Patreon account, so if you want to contribute to Patreon, we have information about that inside.

328
01:12:25,457 --> 01:12:30,481
When we finish up, Jonathan and I both have some product, as they call it, in the trade.

329
01:12:30,501 --> 01:12:32,263
He has some CDs.

330
01:12:32,343 --> 01:12:34,705
I have some of my fifth book.

331
01:12:34,745 --> 01:12:36,126
I'm working on my sixth now.

332
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:43,343
Jonathan and I basically met at the intersection of jazz and social justice.

333
01:12:44,223 --> 01:12:46,124
So that's what we call this music.

334
01:12:46,945 --> 01:12:59,151
Music is, to a great extent, that intersection where jazz, which has always been a progressive thing in the United States, meets social justice, which is really becoming a

335
01:13:00,792 --> 01:13:02,435
a thing all over again.

336
01:13:02,615 --> 01:13:14,015
So we're happy to be working together under any circumstances, but we think it's necessary for us to work together under these particular circumstances.

337
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:24,222
So by his definition and in my agreement, this is the Ally Project.

338
01:13:24,643 --> 01:13:26,345
And I want to introduce the players.

339
01:13:27,086 --> 01:13:30,250
Over here on the traps, on the drums, John Dalton.

340
01:13:32,936 --> 01:13:37,760
And John's got like six, seven different groups that he plays with, right?

341
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:41,964
He's got a great, great group called Spheres of Influence.

342
01:13:42,504 --> 01:13:45,246
Spheres of Influence, okay?

343
01:13:45,426 --> 01:13:49,250
S-P-H-E-R-E-S, Spheres of Influence.

344
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:54,414
And they do some real, real good edgy stuff.

345
01:13:54,994 --> 01:14:00,479
We got my man Greg Turow on what I call the big sexy, okay?

346
01:14:02,129 --> 01:14:04,652
That stand up bass with the hourglass figure.

347
01:14:05,332 --> 01:14:06,193
It's real cool.

348
01:14:06,813 --> 01:14:10,857
And then my friend, and really Jonathan found me.

349
01:14:10,917 --> 01:14:15,541
I think he had seen something that I did maybe at Martin Luther King.

350
01:14:15,742 --> 01:14:16,983
Was it Martin Luther King Day?

351
01:14:18,103 --> 01:14:32,593
And he sought me out, and we just started talking about how we could again integrate this theme of jazz, him as a musician, a composer, an arranger, a teacher, a man of many talents, and me as a humble poet.

352
01:14:32,873 --> 01:14:36,415
And before you know it, this thing just started to evolve.

353
01:14:36,495 --> 01:14:39,818
So a little over a month ago,

354
01:14:40,788 --> 01:14:43,711
We were in the studio recording our first CD.

355
01:14:45,132 --> 01:14:53,539
And we brought together this group, but also a very talented woman, who you'll hear some from a little bit later.

356
01:14:53,639 --> 01:14:54,620
Her name is Linda.

357
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,081
Call her Lady Morose.

358
01:14:56,702 --> 01:14:58,483
And I found her.

359
01:15:01,085 --> 01:15:05,187
based on another friend who's also a musician and a poet named Max Heinig.

360
01:15:05,688 --> 01:15:16,914
And Max teaches at Medford High School and she was one of his students and when he recorded his recent CD, which I actually contributed a song to, Linda was his singer.

361
01:15:17,494 --> 01:15:20,816
And I heard her at the Medford Public Library and I was done.

362
01:15:21,716 --> 01:15:22,737
I was completely done.

363
01:15:22,777 --> 01:15:30,601
I said, you know, when Jonathan and I were talking, we said, well, you know, maybe we could get a singer to add some layers, a little bit of subtext to this thing.

364
01:15:30,981 --> 01:15:32,562
And I said, I got just the person.

365
01:15:33,322 --> 01:15:36,144
Hence, Linda will be singing with us in a little while.

366
01:15:36,584 --> 01:15:37,564
So we're going to get to it.

367
01:15:39,005 --> 01:15:47,716
This first piece really defines the relationship of this community, West Medford, with greater Medford.

368
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:53,363
And it's a historical but somewhat fragmented relationship.

369
01:15:53,924 --> 01:15:56,647
And again, it began

370
01:15:58,348 --> 01:16:10,391
probably 15, 20 years after the Civil War, and has evolved to a very different West Medford than the West Medford that I grew up with, but that's another story for another poem.

371
01:16:10,891 --> 01:16:13,012
This piece is called Hired by the Mystic.

372
01:16:18,253 --> 01:16:22,014
They gave my people the lowlands, and not much of it.

373
01:16:23,094 --> 01:16:24,955
Just a few streets high by the river.

374
01:16:25,854 --> 01:16:29,617
Banks turned a blind eye behind the red lines, and it wasn't about the money.

375
01:16:30,498 --> 01:16:32,600
Class was an irresistible force.

376
01:16:33,761 --> 01:16:35,763
Race was an immovable object.

377
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:51,437
Perhaps it wasn't a written rule, but white folks knew the legal tool to keep us in our place in this mystic valley space, where slaves and rum and chips had built some mansions, made some millionaires, and hid some old money.

378
01:16:53,422 --> 01:16:55,402
So it was hard by the mystic we went.

379
01:16:56,783 --> 01:16:58,423
Muddy and a bit turned down.

380
01:16:58,903 --> 01:17:03,804
The only place where one could be brown in this ancient Middlesex County town.

381
01:17:04,664 --> 01:17:05,645
But we named it.

382
01:17:06,085 --> 01:17:06,825
We claimed it.

383
01:17:07,225 --> 01:17:08,665
We made it our own.

384
01:17:10,566 --> 01:17:18,407
Even in the heat of summer when the shores were pipes and the soil was rank with the decay of aquatic alchemy, we were one with the river.

385
01:17:19,247 --> 01:17:22,128
We followed its flow to the lakes and the sandy beachfront.

386
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:31,464
Like our own Jordan Shore, we baptized and blessed our brothers and sisters in Christ.

387
01:17:31,704 --> 01:17:40,608
We caught the little fishes to go with our loaves of bread and became the teaming multitude who our Lord Jesus fed, hired by the mission.

388
01:17:42,569 --> 01:17:43,850
We became community.

389
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:45,751
We commanded unity.

390
01:17:46,231 --> 01:17:49,853
We embraced the village and raised up our children in the way they should go.

391
01:17:52,066 --> 01:17:57,110
As the river ebbs and flows, the tide will turn and our fortune grows.

392
01:17:57,810 --> 01:17:59,952
A few more streets become our home.

393
01:18:00,632 --> 01:18:03,474
Houses on Sharon join Kin on Jerome.

394
01:18:04,415 --> 01:18:09,839
From Duggar Park to the railroad tracks, the landed folks make more room for blacks.

395
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:12,580
The color line recedes a bit.

396
01:18:13,141 --> 01:18:15,863
Church and school and center sit.

397
01:18:16,523 --> 01:18:20,346
The Ville becomes the heart of it, hard by the mystic shore.

398
01:18:33,854 --> 01:18:40,310
Now the worm has surely turned, and folks who left have surely learned things couldn't stay the same.

399
01:18:41,792 --> 01:18:44,333
The muddy mystic most days is clean.

400
01:18:44,393 --> 01:18:46,934
The banks are freshly cut and green.

401
01:18:47,634 --> 01:18:51,755
Faces once distinctly brown are not the only ones in town.

402
01:18:52,756 --> 01:18:59,298
The streets that once were our confines must now embrace what gentry defined.

403
01:19:00,038 --> 01:19:09,041
Condominium culture, bedroom convenience, university sprawl, access, e-graph, access,

404
01:19:15,595 --> 01:19:27,766
Now those lowlands have become the highlights of a trending city and sometimes that success isn't pretty when it's at the expense of your black and brown and tan family.

405
01:19:29,528 --> 01:19:41,719
And yet, the river still turns and bends from where it begins to where it ends.

406
01:19:42,711 --> 01:20:00,160
the only place where one could be brown in this ancient Middlesex County town where we named it and claimed it and made it our own.

407
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:06,523
Thank you.

408
01:20:06,703 --> 01:20:07,024
Thank you.

409
01:20:07,644 --> 01:20:10,645
So now that you have a bit of the history,

410
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:14,929
I want to talk institutionally.

411
01:20:16,069 --> 01:20:23,032
And in West Medford, when I was growing up, there were three, maybe four institutions that were really, really important to us.

412
01:20:23,812 --> 01:20:27,093
Now you're sitting in the patio of one of them, West Medford Community Center.

413
01:20:27,114 --> 01:20:31,715
This is the second building on the site, but this organization goes back 1945-ish.

414
01:20:33,775 --> 01:20:39,805
Okay, when a group of men from West Medford determined that they needed a place to be somebody.

415
01:20:40,386 --> 01:20:42,990
So they actually carted up from

416
01:20:44,535 --> 01:20:51,960
temporary military installation in Charlestown, what's called a Quonset hut, or military barracks in pieces.

417
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:58,144
They brought it to this site, they poured a foundation, and they built the original West Memphis Community Center.

418
01:20:58,464 --> 01:21:08,331
This is the second iteration of that building, and so this is one of the great institutions of the West Memphis Community Center, West Memphis Community.

419
01:21:09,284 --> 01:21:15,226
The other great institution was called Shiloh Baptist Church, and it's on the corner of Holton and Bower Streets.

420
01:21:15,326 --> 01:21:23,389
It's still there, it's still ministering to the needs of a predominantly African American congregation.

421
01:21:24,309 --> 01:21:31,131
And then the third institution was not as, not what you think it would be.

422
01:21:31,211 --> 01:21:35,673
It's not a school, it's not a university, it's not, let me just read the poem.

423
01:21:37,874 --> 01:21:38,634
The Little Store.

424
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:02,363
It was a tiny red hovel on upper Jerome, a bit rundown and rough around the edges.

425
01:22:03,443 --> 01:22:11,207
And Mr. Henry seemed so old to us, even then, with a lot of whiskers, impatient and a little scary.

426
01:22:12,381 --> 01:22:15,002
One would suspect that he didn't even like kids.

427
01:22:15,562 --> 01:22:18,842
But he really must have loved us.

428
01:22:19,142 --> 01:22:22,903
Or else, where did all that penny candy come from?

429
01:22:23,823 --> 01:22:24,583
He had all of it.

430
01:22:24,843 --> 01:22:26,384
No, no, seriously.

431
01:22:26,664 --> 01:22:32,345
We'd bust in there with a few nickels or a handful of pennies, all loud and unruly.

432
01:22:33,745 --> 01:22:37,046
He'd hush us up while he finished with grown folks' business.

433
01:22:37,998 --> 01:22:41,482
Then he'd be back like a black Willy Wonka up in that old shack.

434
01:22:42,043 --> 01:22:46,369
He'd peer over those old horn rimmed glasses and tell us he didn't have all day.

435
01:22:46,389 --> 01:22:55,741
Then he'd blow open one of those small brown craft paper bags and get to stuffing while we were oohing and aahing.

436
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:58,882
Muffin and Puffin.

437
01:22:58,962 --> 01:23:02,044
See, Mr. Henry had all the treats.

438
01:23:02,545 --> 01:23:03,546
All of our favorites.

439
01:23:04,066 --> 01:23:05,908
100 great sweets.

440
01:23:07,389 --> 01:23:09,170
Root beer barrels and pixie sticks.

441
01:23:09,490 --> 01:23:11,372
Squirrel nut zippers and banana splits.

442
01:23:11,632 --> 01:23:13,494
Green mint juleps and button strips.

443
01:23:13,754 --> 01:23:15,656
Red licorice ropes and bottle nips.

444
01:23:16,056 --> 01:23:18,398
He had bazooka Joe bubble gum.

445
01:23:18,758 --> 01:23:20,900
And a tiny sucker called a dum-dum.

446
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,142
Yaw breakers and Tootsie Rolls.

447
01:23:23,702 --> 01:23:25,886
Sugary love for little kids sold.

448
01:23:26,947 --> 01:23:32,075
Candy necklaces to wear and fight, and waxy red lips were such a sight.

449
01:23:32,876 --> 01:23:37,443
Fat gum cigars and kid cigarettes right beside the crunchy sticks.

450
01:23:40,132 --> 01:23:44,375
Hot fireballs and Mexican hats.

451
01:23:45,156 --> 01:23:48,278
Just the genuine Percy's kisses.

452
01:23:48,418 --> 01:23:50,640
All of the hits and none of the misses.

453
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,782
Like kids' taffy squares and Necco wafers.

454
01:23:54,822 --> 01:23:56,924
Liquor made in Boston may be.

455
01:23:57,384 --> 01:24:00,687
Gold rocks, nuggets of gum in a bag.

456
01:24:23,663 --> 01:24:26,965
from cold January to chilly December.

457
01:24:28,186 --> 01:24:33,951
More kinds of candy than I can remember at the Mill storefront on Upper Jerome.

458
01:24:34,871 --> 01:24:37,493
I knew I had to write this poem.

459
01:24:37,533 --> 01:24:45,039
See, Mr. Henry had all of the treats, all of our favorites, a hundred great sweets.

460
01:24:53,820 --> 01:25:07,706
So now I have the distinct pleasure of welcoming to the stage our collaborator, our friend, a muse of sorts, Linda Lady Moreau.

461
01:25:14,358 --> 01:25:23,504
We're gonna do an old tune, a takeoff on an old tune by Nat Simon, popularized by the pianist Ahmed Jamal.

462
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:31,889
That tune was called Poinciana, and this riff on Poinciana is called Reprise for Poinciana.

463
01:25:41,428 --> 01:25:44,169
Perfect a fantasy in black and tan.

464
01:25:45,049 --> 01:25:48,450
Between the Savoy ballroom and a Paris can-can.

465
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:51,631
The kind of blue that doesn't get you down.

466
01:25:52,291 --> 01:25:56,072
It rather has you twirling round and round and round.

467
01:25:56,232 --> 01:25:59,813
Kind of blue, but not really.

468
01:26:01,397 --> 01:26:09,341
Like a conversation between Miles and Q in a smoke-filled corner, just those two talking about the music round midnight.

469
01:26:10,022 --> 01:26:17,786
Miles and that miraculous horn, all gravel-voicing, full of scorn, asking Q, what made you feel like doing stuff like that?

470
01:26:19,267 --> 01:26:22,249
Jazz finds justice in the majesty of the blues.

471
01:26:22,809 --> 01:26:26,031
Take five to wonder, and you'll know that this is true.

472
01:26:26,711 --> 01:26:29,613
Deep and delicious all over.

473
01:26:30,728 --> 01:26:36,431
Pondered passionately in pianissimo, keeping standard time.

474
01:26:36,571 --> 01:26:47,197
Duke's mood indigo, Joe Sample's rainbow seeker, Errol Garner's misty worship in the style of G. You know the melody, songs you just can't get out of your head.

475
01:26:47,517 --> 01:26:50,819
Kind of blue, but not really.

476
01:26:52,466 --> 01:26:56,893
just like the woman whose name you call as autumn leaves begin to fall.

477
01:26:58,836 --> 01:27:03,042
Or maybe like that melody by Ahmad Jamal.

478
01:27:04,281 --> 01:27:05,802
Po-en-ci-a-na.

479
01:27:06,723 --> 01:27:09,325
Last days of sun and sand and sea.

480
01:27:09,845 --> 01:27:12,987
You and your love and the music made three.

481
01:27:13,467 --> 01:27:17,310
A lyric so familiar, a song so free, so sweet.

482
01:27:17,950 --> 01:27:19,892
Ebony notes on an ivory sheet.

483
01:27:20,252 --> 01:27:22,233
New tear stains on every page.

484
01:27:22,614 --> 01:27:25,376
A bit of your heart in a crystal cage.

485
01:27:26,416 --> 01:27:30,099
Kind of blue, but not really.

486
01:27:31,892 --> 01:27:34,754
You'll remember her most round midnight.

487
01:27:35,415 --> 01:27:41,039
Poesiana, fragrant, fresh wind recollections, a song reprise.

488
01:27:41,619 --> 01:27:48,264
Summer breeze makes me feel fine.

489
01:27:48,924 --> 01:27:52,066
Oh, through the jazz winds of my mind.

490
01:27:56,516 --> 01:28:03,283
Miles in queue in that smoke-filled corner, talking about taking the A train, going up to Smalls Paradise.

491
01:28:03,583 --> 01:28:10,710
Sassy's going to be scatting, and Hawk's band is in town, doing jazz some real justice.

492
01:28:11,391 --> 01:28:17,197
Marvelous, majestic, and kind of blue, but not really.

493
01:28:18,496 --> 01:28:20,517
You'll remember her most round midnight.

494
01:28:20,878 --> 01:28:22,579
Po-en-ci-a-na.

495
01:28:22,979 --> 01:28:26,441
Pungent rose petal pictures, a song reprise.

496
01:28:26,461 --> 01:28:33,906
The first time ever I saw your face.

497
01:28:44,295 --> 01:28:58,543
fantasy perfected in cocoa and cream, Harlem nights in a Moulin Rouge daydream, the kind of blue that fills your soul, engulfs your spirit, and makes you whole.

498
01:28:58,943 --> 01:29:11,190
My Poinciana, I'll remember you most round midnight, frail fragments of love's fulfillment, kind of blue, but not really.

499
01:29:12,267 --> 01:29:14,269
Your song, reprise.

500
01:29:15,510 --> 01:29:28,261
♪ Till you come back to me ♪ ♪ That's what I'm gonna do ♪ Poinciana, my Poinciana.

501
01:29:32,985 --> 01:29:33,766
Linda Morales.

502
01:29:37,649 --> 01:29:38,871
John Dalton on the drums.

503
01:29:41,112 --> 01:29:47,018
Rafe Toro on the stand up, Jonathan Fagan on the keys, and I'm Terry Cotter.

504
01:29:49,421 --> 01:29:53,985
So, Linda, you just know, right?

505
01:29:54,366 --> 01:29:55,467
All right.

506
01:29:57,169 --> 01:29:57,349
So.

507
01:29:59,011 --> 01:30:13,919
I mean, at the intersection of jazz and social justice, there's some real nice music, but there's also some dangerous stuff that's taking place, some dangerous stuff that we have to take into account and play about.

508
01:30:14,439 --> 01:30:17,641
So we're gonna play a piece called Microaggressions.

509
01:30:31,035 --> 01:30:32,757
You'll never know what this feels like.

510
01:30:32,777 --> 01:30:40,846
24-7, 365, 366 in the leap year, and it's definitely a black thing.

511
01:30:42,147 --> 01:30:42,428
Why?

512
01:30:43,389 --> 01:30:44,510
I'm so glad you asked.

513
01:30:45,051 --> 01:30:49,315
You call the police on us like you're calling a building manager to come unclog your toilet.

514
01:30:49,976 --> 01:30:50,276
Why?

515
01:30:50,717 --> 01:30:51,398
Because you can.

516
01:30:52,403 --> 01:30:54,764
The skin you're in says, I win.

517
01:30:55,904 --> 01:30:57,485
We can't ever be too loud.

518
01:30:58,265 --> 01:30:59,866
We can't ever be too educated.

519
01:31:00,426 --> 01:31:02,226
We can't ever be too proud.

520
01:31:02,426 --> 01:31:04,387
We can't ever be too dedicated.

521
01:31:06,048 --> 01:31:08,849
Nobody follows you around in Nordstrom just because.

522
01:31:09,649 --> 01:31:13,590
Nobody asks you for your ID on campus just because.

523
01:31:14,410 --> 01:31:21,753
Nobody sprints and cuffs you without provocation just because, just because of the skin you're in.

524
01:31:24,025 --> 01:31:25,186
You can never be too loud.

525
01:31:26,027 --> 01:31:27,969
You can never be too educated.

526
01:31:28,049 --> 01:31:29,690
You can never be too proud.

527
01:31:30,231 --> 01:31:31,972
You can never be too dedicated.

528
01:31:33,334 --> 01:31:34,755
We live with this every day.

529
01:31:36,176 --> 01:31:37,798
We deal with this every day.

530
01:31:38,419 --> 01:31:40,861
We're mindful of this every day.

531
01:31:41,321 --> 01:31:43,964
We're stressed by this every day.

532
01:31:45,984 --> 01:31:47,946
never walked a mile in my shoes.

533
01:31:47,986 --> 01:31:51,269
You can't feel how much these shoes pinch my toes.

534
01:31:51,569 --> 01:31:58,295
You can't feel the tightness and discomfort in every step I have to take in a whitewashed world.

535
01:32:05,241 --> 01:32:05,841
But why?

536
01:32:06,882 --> 01:32:12,988
Why does it take 26 bullets to subdue a black boy with his back turned and no weapon save a cell phone?

537
01:32:14,656 --> 01:32:24,667
Why do major corporations like Unilever, H&M, and Heineken perpetuate racial stereotypes with tone-deaf advertising on the regular?

538
01:32:26,729 --> 01:32:34,358
Why does the sitting potent think it's okay to call the country where my people came from, home?

539
01:32:37,355 --> 01:32:50,880
Why does a black child in grade school get put out of class for the same type of force play, or youthful obstinance, or mild assertiveness that gets his white classmate a simple, Johnny, behave yourself.

540
01:33:07,739 --> 01:33:25,569
You don't know how it feels to see the smiling faces of rednecks and Klansmen, Klanswomen and Klanskids standing hundreds deep in a field where the charred body of a black boy is dangling from a noose on the bow of an ancient oak tree.

541
01:33:26,789 --> 01:33:34,534
Perhaps the Jew does when he sees the image of naked bodies piled in the rigor of death at Auschwitz or Dachau.

542
01:33:35,731 --> 01:33:46,798
Perhaps the native Apache or Cherokee does when she sees the grainy illustrations of the forced death marches of her ancestors across the Trail of Tears.

543
01:33:48,719 --> 01:34:00,667
Perhaps the Japanese immigrant does when he remembers the barbed wire perimeters and horse stables converted to living quarters for the forced internment of potential enemy agents.

544
01:34:01,848 --> 01:34:02,188
But you,

545
01:34:03,345 --> 01:34:18,137
heir to Anglo-Euro spoils of colonial conquest and systemic privilege do not have radar for this, do not have a frame of reference for this, do not have an appreciation of this.

546
01:34:18,997 --> 01:34:30,366
You do not have the emotional intelligence for these little hurts of the heart, bee stings to the brain, sucker punches to the soul, spilled milk of the spirit.

547
01:34:31,587 --> 01:34:32,048
You say,

548
01:34:33,536 --> 01:34:38,801
It's nothing we think you should cry over, even as you watch us sometimes die over.

549
01:34:39,221 --> 01:34:55,416
These microaggressions, these race-fueled transgressions, this constant procession of slings and arrows that seldom miss the target when the bullseye is black like me.

550
01:35:06,488 --> 01:35:10,352
So people ask sometimes, why are you so angry?

551
01:35:11,693 --> 01:35:16,317
And I try to tell them I'm a loving and compassionate person.

552
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:17,438
I'm a man of faith.

553
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:20,161
I'm not angry.

554
01:35:20,781 --> 01:35:21,642
I'm resolute.

555
01:35:22,423 --> 01:35:25,586
I think it's important that we tell the truth and shame the devil.

556
01:35:26,426 --> 01:35:27,868
I think it's important that

557
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:40,349
We talk about the things that are issues between us because if we can't bridge the gulfs, and there are many between us, we're in for a long and bumpy ride.

558
01:35:41,390 --> 01:35:46,214
But the neighborhood that I grew up in, West Medford, has changed an awful lot.

559
01:35:46,655 --> 01:35:52,640
It was at one time a very nuclear African-American neighborhood that

560
01:35:53,803 --> 01:35:57,464
took up about eight or 10 streets, right around where we are now.

561
01:35:58,704 --> 01:35:59,645
But things are changing.

562
01:35:59,885 --> 01:36:01,625
Part of the change is actually going up.

563
01:36:01,685 --> 01:36:03,526
I don't know if you can see it right beside us.

564
01:36:04,086 --> 01:36:11,928
It's a multi-unit dwelling in front of a house that, in all honesty, we used to own, but that's another story for another day.

565
01:36:13,188 --> 01:36:18,250
But I wanna play, we wanna play a little tune for you called Gentrified.

566
01:36:26,001 --> 01:36:26,202
you

567
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:37,171
They talk about renovating, reimagining, and rehabilitating.

568
01:36:37,692 --> 01:36:41,573
They rave about new visions, new horizons, and new perspectives.

569
01:36:42,073 --> 01:36:45,434
They revel in bistros, boutiques, and boulangeries.

570
01:36:45,494 --> 01:36:47,935
They fairly skip to the subway stations.

571
01:36:48,055 --> 01:36:49,776
They bike on the painted pathways.

572
01:36:50,096 --> 01:36:52,237
They Uber and Lyft religiously.

573
01:36:52,517 --> 01:36:55,838
Everything's on trend and on point and au pair.

574
01:36:57,059 --> 01:37:06,541
They've codified the way they speak about what used to be urban blight, eyesores, drug dens, crack houses, tenements, and slums, the ghetto.

575
01:37:07,201 --> 01:37:17,323
They've modified the way they speak about what we now see, makeovers, investment properties, B&Bs, brownstones, townhouses, condos, and co-ops.

576
01:37:18,303 --> 01:37:26,025
Everything's vintage, bohemian, artsy, and retro, with creative green spaces and lofted open places.

577
01:37:28,183 --> 01:37:41,680
Speculators bought lower than low, patiently waiting for the change, waiting for the junkies to move on, waiting for the squatters to give up, waiting for the blacks and the browns and the tans to fade.

578
01:37:44,005 --> 01:37:46,207
They waited for the graffiti to erode.

579
01:37:46,988 --> 01:37:49,191
They waited for the chain link to corrode.

580
01:37:49,671 --> 01:37:51,854
They waited for the family to implode.

581
01:37:51,894 --> 01:37:54,617
They waited for the prices to explode.

582
01:37:55,778 --> 01:37:57,860
They waited, and they calculated.

583
01:37:58,701 --> 01:38:00,443
They waited as folks capitulated.

584
01:38:01,083 --> 01:38:03,306
They waited as folks evacuated.

585
01:38:03,867 --> 01:38:05,889
They waited as folks migrated.

586
01:38:10,987 --> 01:38:13,832
Then the realtors came and dispelled white folks' fears.

587
01:38:14,393 --> 01:38:16,718
The architects came and re-engineered.

588
01:38:17,098 --> 01:38:19,683
The designers came and changed the veneers.

589
01:38:20,084 --> 01:38:22,929
The builders came and the new folk cheered.

590
01:38:24,028 --> 01:38:48,260
Now they've moved closer to work in the city, to quartz countertops that made kitchens pretty, to chowder schools, nannies, and drivers, and bite frames made with carbon fibers, to Starbucks lattes and artisanal breads, and articulated sleep number beds, to million dollar urban show places, and fewer and fewer black and brown faces.

591
01:38:50,629 --> 01:38:52,930
They showed us their heels when they took the white flight.

592
01:38:53,370 --> 01:38:55,450
Then they crept back in in the dead of night.

593
01:38:56,030 --> 01:38:59,411
With fat bank accounts, they were IPO wealthy.

594
01:38:59,791 --> 01:39:03,432
Their move to this place was measured and stealthy.

595
01:39:04,953 --> 01:39:07,493
All of the potholes now smoothly paved over.

596
01:39:08,033 --> 01:39:10,714
Brown folks got schooled like a Curry crossover.

597
01:39:11,354 --> 01:39:13,815
White folks doing a long-term sleepover.

598
01:39:14,175 --> 01:39:17,956
Exclusive, obtrusive, extreme home makeover.

599
01:39:19,389 --> 01:39:21,832
full of sugar, they took all the clover.

600
01:39:25,737 --> 01:39:30,222
Changing the context of neighborhood with subway tile and exotic wood.

601
01:39:30,783 --> 01:39:33,846
Harlem, Detroit, and Chicago's South Side.

602
01:39:34,207 --> 01:39:36,970
Boston's South End surely gentrified.

603
01:39:37,731 --> 01:39:38,432
Empty the church.

604
01:39:39,545 --> 01:39:43,288
Emptied the steeple, now it's a spot for the chai-drinking people.

605
01:39:43,849 --> 01:39:48,632
Took down the poles and the basketball hoops, now it's a park for the dog-walking troops.

606
01:39:49,233 --> 01:39:53,997
No more rec and community center, but a new parking lot for the monthly renters.

607
01:39:59,175 --> 01:40:02,379
Some folks hang on, but the die is cast.

608
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:05,583
The fire consumes and the torch is passed.

609
01:40:06,204 --> 01:40:12,312
Invisible lines are drawn again, and the folks can't buy when the banks won't lend.

610
01:40:13,737 --> 01:40:18,559
Some folks keep their roots in the ground, but the waiting game is deep and profound.

611
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:24,280
They tour the streets noting history, yet what they want is no mystery.

612
01:40:24,921 --> 01:40:35,764
Holland, Detroit, and Chicago's South Side, a reoccupation is being applied to model cities that trickle down, no longer suited to black and brown.

613
01:40:37,062 --> 01:40:48,017
The urban sprawl that used to be the only homes that we got to see is now the place for growing infusion, is now the space that the gentry is choosing.

614
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:26,849
low-rise projects slowly yield to equity building leases sealed to folks who came from far afield who won the fight when the poor folk appealed to lawyers and doctors and high-tech heroes with Trust Fund One and Hedge Fund Zero.

615
01:41:28,470 --> 01:41:38,135
No preserving community, no real thought of legacy, a small flag here, a street sign there, nothing that bronzes the atmosphere.

616
01:41:39,381 --> 01:41:44,443
Oakland, Brooklyn, and New Orleans, all made targets by whites with means.

617
01:41:45,263 --> 01:41:50,886
Even in venerable chocolate cities, the news in the district inspires some pity.

618
01:42:12,307 --> 01:42:16,469
killing the concept of neighborhood in ways they've never understood.

619
01:42:16,489 --> 01:42:26,234
And now we witness the slow, painful slide as the village we built becomes gentrified.

620
01:42:38,163 --> 01:42:40,384
My mother used to say, life is hard, but fair.

621
01:42:40,424 --> 01:42:42,464
You had a good home, but you didn't stay there.

622
01:42:44,045 --> 01:42:52,027
So I want to bring back our friend, our muse, Linda Moreau, and she's going to join me for a tune we call Legacy.

623
01:43:02,711 --> 01:43:03,611
How you folks holding up?

624
01:43:04,838 --> 01:43:05,679
Good, good, good.

625
01:43:05,819 --> 01:43:06,740
You enjoying yourselves?

626
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:07,200
Yes.

627
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:08,241
All right, all right.

628
01:43:08,281 --> 01:43:12,365
When we do this the next time, we've got to definitely make sure that we do it in warmer weather.

629
01:43:17,149 --> 01:43:23,454
And the forecast tomorrow suggests rain, suggested very dramatically.

630
01:43:23,534 --> 01:43:28,579
So we are assuming that we will be inside tomorrow as opposed to outside.

631
01:43:30,531 --> 01:43:36,242
So hopefully if you come back tomorrow, you won't have to suffer through the chill.

632
01:43:38,587 --> 01:43:39,028
You good to go?

633
01:44:16,642 --> 01:44:18,923
It's not for you to tell your own story.

634
01:44:19,484 --> 01:44:21,285
That is the burden of your children.

635
01:44:21,926 --> 01:44:26,229
They must shoulder this yoke with love and loyalty.

636
01:44:27,570 --> 01:44:33,574
And yet, you have not gathered them up and bid them sit before the campfires of their elders.

637
01:44:34,531 --> 01:44:40,953
You have not seasoned their meals with the spice of their identity and the savor of their name.

638
01:44:42,073 --> 01:44:45,874
How will they learn to walk the walk and talk the talk?

639
01:44:46,454 --> 01:44:50,775
How will they learn to tell your story even as they live out their own?

640
01:44:52,036 --> 01:45:01,338
Sons and daughters and heirs, if you didn't smell the burning ash or feel the warmth of the flame on your neck, you don't know.

641
01:45:02,529 --> 01:45:10,074
If you didn't revel in the growl of the griot's earthly reply or the trill of the mockingbird's cry, you don't know.

642
01:45:11,235 --> 01:45:20,402
If mama was too tired and daddy too long gone to carry the wood, light the spark, and stoke the flames, you don't know.

643
01:45:22,363 --> 01:45:28,488
And until the lion cub knows how to tell the pride story, the hunters will always tell them first.

644
01:45:40,834 --> 01:45:44,756
The good book says, train up the child in the way they should go.

645
01:45:44,776 --> 01:45:57,242
Will we let them depart from the community of faith and the city on a hill without the master's touch, without the oil of his anointing and his full measure of grace?

646
01:45:58,936 --> 01:46:13,673
Will we not show them Anansi's clever ways, Popo and Fafina's journey, Muparo's beautiful daughters, the people who could fly, the wonders of Wakanda, and Song Kololo's news hacky.

647
01:46:15,270 --> 01:46:19,673
The prophet says he will encourage fathers and their children to return.

648
01:46:19,953 --> 01:46:31,122
But how will they know the way home if no map charts the seas, measures the roads, cites the peaks and valleys, and names each forest despite the thickening stream?

649
01:46:33,066 --> 01:46:36,349
Will the burden of the elder stories be too heavy for the children?

650
01:46:36,829 --> 01:46:38,210
Will they care to carry?

651
01:46:38,611 --> 01:46:40,512
Will they dare to tarry?

652
01:46:41,413 --> 01:46:43,274
Will they linger at the foot of the griot?

653
01:46:43,334 --> 01:46:46,157
Will they hunger for the wisdom of the sage?

654
01:46:47,318 --> 01:46:59,307
We must put them on the page, where hard work earns the man his wage, where power is measured by God's own gauge, where miracles scarf at the wand of a maid.

655
01:47:02,335 --> 01:47:13,124
We must share with them the truth that is loyal and fierce like Naomi and Ruth, that doesn't wait for the confessional boot, that has the bite of the panther's tooth.

656
01:47:20,529 --> 01:47:29,336
This is a gift of legacy, where a glorious past sets the captives free, and a candle's light beckons liberty.

657
01:47:30,459 --> 01:47:33,100
sons and daughters and heir.

658
01:47:34,241 --> 01:47:43,566
I bid you sit before the campfires of your elders, hear their stories, gather up their stones, and build up your strength.

659
01:47:44,686 --> 01:47:59,654
They will show you Anansi's club away, Popo and Fafina's journey, Mufaro's beautiful daughters, the people who could fly, the wonders of Wakanda, and Sangololo's Tutaki.

660
01:48:02,185 --> 01:48:04,387
Soon you will be the herald.

661
01:48:04,767 --> 01:48:07,710
Write these things down on the tablets of your spirit.

662
01:48:08,050 --> 01:48:10,232
Let them put a running in your feet.

663
01:48:14,335 --> 01:48:15,777
With each quickening step,

664
01:48:16,658 --> 01:48:20,962
You repel the arrows of the hunter with the shield of abiding faith.

665
01:48:21,223 --> 01:48:25,086
You capture the flags of your enemies and gather up their spoils.

666
01:48:25,607 --> 01:48:32,334
You remain the lions of your pride and your children, your tales will always be your children's friends.

667
01:48:42,585 --> 01:49:03,796
You will never abandon the community of faith, though you build a thousand cities on a hill, drawing wondrous strength from the master's touch, as the oil of his anointing fills your clay jars with his grace.

668
01:49:05,918 --> 01:49:06,658
Linda Morales.

669
01:49:16,095 --> 01:49:29,819
So you're in what has been traditionally called The Ville, probably short for village, but I'm not 100% sure of that.

670
01:49:31,419 --> 01:49:35,760
And it's also called The Hood, short for The Neighborhood.

671
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:38,921
So we're gonna do a piece called Neighborhood.

672
01:50:03,123 --> 01:50:12,487
Neighborhood is a place where mothers buy extra food for kids that aren't even their own, on the premise that they will eventually show up hungry.

673
01:50:13,948 --> 01:50:26,753
Neighborhood is grandmas and grandpas that raise their children's children long after they've raised their own, lovingly, carefully, happily, long after they've raised their own.

674
01:50:28,055 --> 01:50:36,143
Neighborhood is that corner bodega where the nice Spanish man always gave you 10 cents worth of penny candy when all you ever had was a nickel.

675
01:50:38,725 --> 01:50:45,952
Neighborhood is the homeowner that doesn't look down his nose at the frazzled rental with the Section 8 and a few kids without a daddy.

676
01:50:47,819 --> 01:50:51,281
Neighborhood is the block party that everyone comes to.

677
01:50:52,022 --> 01:50:53,583
And nobody calls the cops.

678
01:50:54,283 --> 01:50:57,445
No drugs, no guns, no drama.

679
01:50:58,245 --> 01:51:07,091
Cooling the gang, earth, wind, and fire, Rick James, Tina Marie, and Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan.

680
01:51:08,621 --> 01:51:13,346
Neighborhood knows everybody's name but isn't collecting big data on anyone.

681
01:51:13,906 --> 01:51:21,854
Keeps tabs on strangers but doesn't discriminate based on color or caste or custom.

682
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:33,305
Neighborhood keeps pies and cookies ready to welcome newcomers, and always has something to invite folk to, and always has something good to eat when you get there.

683
01:51:34,745 --> 01:51:47,151
Neighborhood loves all of its children, watches out for all of the babies, disciplines fairly, drops dimes carefully, daps up consistently, and marches for justice dutifully.

684
01:51:48,697 --> 01:51:56,341
Neighborhood cares for its sick with homemade chicken soup, ginger tea, flowers, cards, and pastoral visits.

685
01:51:57,141 --> 01:52:00,503
Never lets you feel lonely, never leaves you alone.

686
01:52:01,823 --> 01:52:13,489
Neighborhood laments the loss of its kings and queens reverently, even while it celebrates their lives jubilantly and recollects their ways permanently.

687
01:52:14,810 --> 01:52:27,193
Neighborhood has well-worn welcome mats and four-way stop signs, a community gathering place as the hub of the wheels, and nicknames like The Port, The Coast, and The Ville.

688
01:52:29,133 --> 01:52:38,115
Neighborhood says yes more than it says no, chooses love over hate, never cries when it could laugh, and never laughs when it should cry.

689
01:52:40,089 --> 01:52:52,254
Neighborhood understands the importance of respect, covers everyone with an umbrella, shovels snow for its elders, pronounces your name right, and picks up the poop left by its dog.

690
01:52:52,875 --> 01:52:55,296
Small, medium, and large.

691
01:52:57,697 --> 01:53:04,920
And no matter where you go, neighborhood is always the place you call home.

692
01:53:15,692 --> 01:53:21,936
Once again, John Dalton on drums, Greg Toro on bass, Jonathan Fagan on the keys.

693
01:53:23,197 --> 01:53:36,566
So again, that intersection of jazz and social justice, I'm gonna take it back a little bit and forward at the same time with a piece we call Riding Up Front.

694
01:53:57,281 --> 01:54:20,510
can't do it don't even ask me black it's a bus but i ain't riding in the back young bloods ain't got no idea of how long we had to ride in the red in the lazy south american apothecary the law of the land was stratified seats up front unoccupied yet a pregnant brown girl can sit and ride

695
01:54:21,250 --> 01:54:23,533
Elders, toddlers, just didn't matter.

696
01:54:23,793 --> 01:54:26,697
And don't let them hear no race talk or chatter.

697
01:54:26,857 --> 01:54:29,040
Redneck drivers would put us out.

698
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:31,282
But y'all don't know what I'm talking about.

699
01:54:32,631 --> 01:54:39,237
Then along came courageous Rosa Parks, tired and weary, but full of sparks.

700
01:54:40,117 --> 01:54:45,542
Took a seat in the first few rows, seeking not chaos, but simple repose.

701
01:54:46,263 --> 01:54:48,184
Think them whites heard what she was saying?

702
01:54:48,565 --> 01:54:51,107
Hell no, and them crackers for sure wasn't playing.

703
01:54:51,627 --> 01:54:57,913
She held up Miss Rosa without dignity, commending her acts to our history.

704
01:55:00,845 --> 01:55:05,787
You don't have no gratitude, no pride in self, just attitude.

705
01:55:06,327 --> 01:55:08,547
You make your way to the back of the bus.

706
01:55:08,967 --> 01:55:11,628
You drink and smoke and holler and cuss.

707
01:55:12,168 --> 01:55:14,229
You say it's your prerogative.

708
01:55:14,689 --> 01:55:16,830
You say it's just the way you live.

709
01:55:17,510 --> 01:55:18,790
You just don't get it.

710
01:55:19,411 --> 01:55:20,771
You just don't care.

711
01:55:21,371 --> 01:55:23,432
So cavalier, so unaware.

712
01:55:25,535 --> 01:55:26,636
But I can't do it.

713
01:55:27,036 --> 01:55:28,697
Don't even ask me, black.

714
01:55:28,797 --> 01:55:29,638
It's a bust.

715
01:55:29,718 --> 01:55:31,819
But I ain't riding in the back.

716
01:55:32,259 --> 01:55:33,900
Three seats up front.

717
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:35,101
That's for me.

718
01:55:35,721 --> 01:55:38,503
I'm digging Miss Rose's legacy.

719
01:55:39,764 --> 01:55:44,406
Here it is.

720
01:55:53,272 --> 01:55:53,612
All right.

721
01:55:54,485 --> 01:55:56,346
We are getting to the good part.

722
01:55:58,628 --> 01:56:12,419
So as I said earlier, in the jazz canon, there are these signature tunes that if you know jazz, you can be anywhere and hear three or four notes and you can name that tune.

723
01:56:12,459 --> 01:56:19,264
This is one of those tunes written, composed, and played by the legendary John Coltrane.

724
01:56:22,654 --> 01:56:23,674
was called Naima.

725
01:56:24,135 --> 01:56:26,936
Our take on it is called Reprise for Naima.

726
01:56:32,118 --> 01:56:35,139
He would blow this note in the midnight air.

727
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:39,301
Aloft in the ether, it floats out there.

728
01:56:40,042 --> 01:56:44,243
Staccato cadence sets a mood of bluesy lyrical attitude.

729
01:56:45,791 --> 01:56:54,196
Improvisational mystery like Monk's piano epistrophe, or Miles' tone poem in a silent way, and Flanagan's peace at the end of the day.

730
01:56:55,797 --> 01:57:04,882
Syncopated and sharp, bright tone, a countdown to stardust, a twilight zone, like a blue train running against the night, setting the pace then out of sight.

731
01:57:06,075 --> 01:57:08,537
With Hartman crooning of bags-on vibes.

732
01:57:08,917 --> 01:57:11,779
Trios, duets, quartets, and tribes.

733
01:57:12,099 --> 01:57:14,721
The blues, the ballads, the avant-garde.

734
01:57:15,202 --> 01:57:18,384
Incredibly gorgeous, impossibly hard.

735
01:57:19,985 --> 01:57:22,067
Giant steps move us miles ahead.

736
01:57:22,307 --> 01:57:24,328
Cooking up bop for Harlem street cred.

737
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:26,430
Melodies hand to the harmony wed.

738
01:57:26,690 --> 01:57:28,571
Pianos lullaby fresh in the bed.

739
01:57:28,852 --> 01:57:30,613
Rhythm rocks with a drum of lead.

740
01:57:30,773 --> 01:57:32,854
Rhythm rolls with a bass man's fed.

741
01:57:33,135 --> 01:57:33,695
Rhythm burlesque.

742
01:57:35,623 --> 01:57:37,564
them heard what the master said.

743
01:57:39,584 --> 01:57:41,685
How could he make the bitter taste sweeter?

744
01:57:42,165 --> 01:57:44,106
How could a tortured mind delete her?

745
01:57:44,146 --> 01:57:46,407
How could the mellowed scotch be neater?

746
01:57:46,807 --> 01:58:00,392
How could the smoke from each cigarette create blue notes that cast a net, create blue beads of cascading sweat, create blue haze that compounds regret, create blue nights that we can't forget?

747
01:58:02,369 --> 01:58:14,399
Coltrane's notes are a crystal scale, a velvet scream in the urban travail, the heavenly riff of a love supreme, the pungent whip of his lover's theme.

748
01:58:16,120 --> 01:58:27,230
Coltrane's knots are a cozy romance, the breezy bounce of a bop and a dance, the languid lilt of stray's lush life, the cadence cut by the artist's knife.

749
01:58:28,597 --> 01:58:40,303
Coltrane's notes are a standard refine, like gold in a pan or gemstones mine, the sparkling glow of a hopeful dream, hot black coffee with a hint of cream.

750
01:58:41,864 --> 01:58:53,209
Coltrane's notes are Naima's reprise, like madness that brings a man to his knees, or sadness that comes when lovers part, the gladness removed from the balladeer's heart.

751
01:58:59,403 --> 01:59:01,185
A tight arrangement cuts the gloom.

752
01:59:01,745 --> 01:59:03,707
The melody sends that love's in bloom.

753
01:59:04,068 --> 01:59:05,989
The harmony spirit engulfs the room.

754
01:59:06,290 --> 01:59:08,552
The bride says yes to her lyrical broom.

755
01:59:08,892 --> 01:59:11,054
The groove and the beat then jumps the broom.

756
01:59:11,395 --> 01:59:15,539
The kick drum resounds with a sonic boom.

757
01:59:16,620 --> 01:59:19,863
As genius is birthed in a soul-filled room.

758
01:59:27,799 --> 01:59:31,983
Musical mythology mocks a twisted path the hero walks.

759
01:59:32,423 --> 01:59:34,605
With sealed and sword the hero stalks.

760
01:59:34,945 --> 01:59:36,947
The tempest shakes her twisted locks.

761
01:59:37,287 --> 01:59:39,229
Medusa snakes his vision shocks.

762
01:59:39,529 --> 01:59:41,290
Holds up the mirror to stony blocks.

763
01:59:41,530 --> 01:59:43,532
The harp and the horn melt icy rocks.

764
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:46,394
Serpents retreat and symphony talks.

765
01:59:46,775 --> 01:59:48,836
Love's door opens as lyric.

766
01:59:55,556 --> 01:59:55,998
Okay.

767
02:00:44,773 --> 02:00:55,177
Coltrane's notes are a rollercoaster, a hallelujah and a paternoster, the glorious jolt of the maestro's hand, the saxophone titan is in command.

768
02:00:56,138 --> 02:01:05,862
Coltrane's notes are a crazy rhythm, the squawk of chords and playful schism, the frenetic pace of Mr. PC, the coolest round midnight will ever be.

769
02:01:07,338 --> 02:01:19,502
Coltrane's notes are genius refined, like gold in a pan or gemstones mined, the sparkling glow of a hopeful dream, hot black coffee with a hint of cream.

770
02:01:20,682 --> 02:01:31,465
Coltrane's notes are Naima's reprieve, like madness that brings a man to his knees, or sadness that comes when lovers part.

771
02:01:31,605 --> 02:01:36,327
Then, gladness revived by the balladeer's heart.

772
02:01:47,397 --> 02:01:48,578
Yes, yes, yes.

773
02:01:49,919 --> 02:01:50,679
Yes, yes, yes.

774
02:01:50,719 --> 02:01:52,040
See, these cats can play.

775
02:01:52,120 --> 02:01:54,021
So that's, you know, that's how that goes.

776
02:01:54,161 --> 02:01:54,541
All right.

777
02:01:55,942 --> 02:01:58,003
So we're going to bring Linda back up.

778
02:01:58,023 --> 02:02:00,144
We're going to do a piece called Kitchen Table Poem.

779
02:02:05,768 --> 02:02:06,128
Okay.

780
02:02:07,609 --> 02:02:07,929
All righty.

781
02:02:15,049 --> 02:02:15,429
All right.

782
02:02:17,631 --> 02:02:17,831
Good?

783
02:02:19,353 --> 02:02:19,873
Bye-bye.

784
02:02:22,275 --> 02:02:23,897
Nobody ever wants to leave.

785
02:02:25,038 --> 02:02:30,222
They're like the blueberry stains on mama's apron, settled and satisfied.

786
02:02:30,962 --> 02:02:32,464
Good food has been eaten.

787
02:02:33,525 --> 02:02:40,330
Fresh corn and collard greens, fried chicken and potato salad, bellies are fat and full.

788
02:02:41,251 --> 02:02:42,692
This is that room.

789
02:02:46,926 --> 02:02:47,807
Are you serious right now?

790
02:02:48,708 --> 02:02:49,630
It's real talk.

791
02:02:50,250 --> 02:02:51,151
We're real people.

792
02:02:51,572 --> 02:02:52,012
Family.

793
02:02:52,473 --> 02:02:53,434
You know what I'm saying?

794
02:02:53,454 --> 02:02:54,856
We're family.

795
02:02:56,318 --> 02:02:58,981
You can smell the love long before the doors open.

796
02:02:59,021 --> 02:03:04,228
You know there's going to be pecan pie and the sweet tea will be ice cold.

797
02:03:05,828 --> 02:03:08,449
Southern folk will slip out of their northerness.

798
02:03:08,809 --> 02:03:13,432
Accents will thicken and the country shade will feel closer than the city sun.

799
02:03:14,752 --> 02:03:18,254
And they'll stay at that table long after the crumbs are cleared.

800
02:03:18,774 --> 02:03:20,395
The dishes will be all washed.

801
02:03:20,435 --> 02:03:24,737
The food will be put away or packed in Tupperware and Ziploc bags.

802
02:03:25,517 --> 02:03:28,539
Everyone will have a doggie bag and a story to tell.

803
02:03:29,443 --> 02:03:35,787
The men will be playing bids, slapping down some dominoes, sipping on a little something something, and talking big trash.

804
02:03:36,208 --> 02:03:40,571
The smiles will be broad and the laughter will be contagious.

805
02:03:42,572 --> 02:03:44,914
The women will be fanning and fussing.

806
02:03:50,171 --> 02:03:51,992
That ain't the dress for her, okay?

807
02:03:52,172 --> 02:03:54,514
That ain't no Sunday saved outfit.

808
02:03:54,934 --> 02:03:57,175
That ain't for Saturday night sinning.

809
02:03:57,776 --> 02:03:58,656
You know I'm right.

810
02:03:58,796 --> 02:04:00,197
Girl, you know I'm right.

811
02:04:00,958 --> 02:04:02,539
Nobody ever wants to leave.

812
02:04:03,239 --> 02:04:06,201
They're like black Jesus's eyes on that old print.

813
02:04:06,701 --> 02:04:07,942
Loving and insistent.

814
02:04:08,542 --> 02:04:10,223
Soul food has been shared.

815
02:04:10,664 --> 02:04:15,547
My Jean prayed down heaven and the babies sang their song.

816
02:04:16,427 --> 02:04:19,129
Everyone's tickled and tranquil.

817
02:04:21,516 --> 02:04:23,197
This is that room.

818
02:04:24,558 --> 02:04:25,959
I really miss pap.

819
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:28,141
Mom's holding her own.

820
02:04:28,862 --> 02:04:30,783
And baby boy's cancer's in remission.

821
02:04:31,564 --> 02:04:35,947
And when you coming back to church, it's real talk.

822
02:04:36,147 --> 02:04:37,848
We're real people.

823
02:04:38,129 --> 02:04:38,609
Family.

824
02:04:39,129 --> 02:04:40,050
You know what I'm saying?

825
02:04:40,831 --> 02:04:42,612
We're family.

826
02:04:44,774 --> 02:04:45,034
Family.

827
02:04:54,943 --> 02:04:55,743
You better do that.

828
02:04:57,824 --> 02:04:59,265
Linda Morose, thank you so much.

829
02:05:00,986 --> 02:05:07,549
Okay, so we're gonna finish up with a piece called Beloved Country.

830
02:05:09,289 --> 02:05:17,393
And I always say this, you know, to preface this, if you're not, you know, native, native, native, native,

831
02:05:18,642 --> 02:05:24,784
Um, then you and your ancestors or your ancestors came here from someplace else, right?

832
02:05:24,904 --> 02:05:32,667
So this is about the folks who came from someplace else and who just want to be in with the in crowd.

833
02:05:33,308 --> 02:05:34,288
It's called Beloved Country.

834
02:06:03,959 --> 02:06:05,280
I can love this country, too.

835
02:06:06,041 --> 02:06:08,284
I didn't have to be born on these bonding shores.

836
02:06:08,804 --> 02:06:12,829
I didn't have to be a son of the Pentacook or Quinnipiac or Mohican.

837
02:06:13,449 --> 02:06:18,975
I didn't have to have a pilgrim pedigree or be a Connecticut Yankee from King Arthur's Court.

838
02:06:19,256 --> 02:06:24,721
I can be the Dahomian, the Pole, or the child of Caribbean suns in Amazon shade.

839
02:06:25,919 --> 02:06:27,261
I can love this country too.

840
02:06:27,882 --> 02:06:32,187
My green card was a welcome ticket to a new life in a new land.

841
02:06:32,748 --> 02:06:36,072
My passport was stamped with new hopes and new dreams.

842
02:06:36,112 --> 02:06:41,338
My suitcases were packed full of new aspirations and some apprehensions too.

843
02:06:42,671 --> 02:06:50,895
Perhaps I didn't see the harbor sign that said, give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuge of your teeming shore.

844
02:06:51,175 --> 02:06:53,436
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me.

845
02:06:53,776 --> 02:06:56,157
I lift my lamp beside the golden door.

846
02:06:56,897 --> 02:07:02,540
Perhaps I didn't see the gleaming city on a hill that couldn't be hid, and my soul responded.

847
02:07:04,562 --> 02:07:06,323
I can love this country, too.

848
02:07:06,743 --> 02:07:09,244
I can love its rocky mountains and its rolling meadows.

849
02:07:09,784 --> 02:07:12,765
I can love its gospel songs and its crazy rhythms.

850
02:07:13,505 --> 02:07:17,247
I can love its asphalt highways and its born-to-run bars.

851
02:07:18,287 --> 02:07:21,328
I can love its teeming ghetto and its urban sprawl.

852
02:07:22,028 --> 02:07:26,450
I can love its old fires, new minarets, and golden menorahs.

853
02:07:58,246 --> 02:08:00,006
But can America love me too?

854
02:08:00,927 --> 02:08:03,827
Can she love my curry spices, roti, and oxtails?

855
02:08:04,887 --> 02:08:07,328
Can she love my hijab and henna tattoos?

856
02:08:08,048 --> 02:08:11,089
Can she love my Hajj, my Mecca, my Medina?

857
02:08:11,749 --> 02:08:14,890
Can she love my Cinco de Mayo, my Dia de los Muertos?

858
02:08:14,930 --> 02:08:18,430
Can she love my kente cloth, dreads, twists, and locks?

859
02:08:18,890 --> 02:08:26,452
Can she love the skin I'm in, be it ebony, ivory, dulce de leche, or cafe au lait?

860
02:08:28,260 --> 02:08:30,021
Can she love me by name?

861
02:08:30,681 --> 02:08:40,745
Shekinah Glory, Muhammad bin Saeed, Anastasia Kozoff, Cleophis Dorcio, Claudia Gonzalez, can she love me by name?

862
02:08:42,525 --> 02:08:51,349
And what if I am among those huddled masses and that wretched refuge or that homeless, tempest-tossed, will she continue to lift her lamp?

863
02:08:52,731 --> 02:09:07,038
or do war and rumors of war, IEDs, sleeper cells, and faith distortions make me a pariah to be eliminated, a scourge to be annihilated, and a plague to be exterminated.

864
02:09:08,338 --> 02:09:09,119
I come in peace.

865
02:09:16,676 --> 02:09:17,736
I love this country, too.

866
02:09:18,677 --> 02:09:20,317
I love its boundless opportunity.

867
02:09:20,937 --> 02:09:22,658
I love its generosity of spirit.

868
02:09:22,698 --> 02:09:24,559
I love the audacity of its hope.

869
02:09:25,019 --> 02:09:27,860
I love its rolling meadows and its joyful songs.

870
02:09:28,440 --> 02:09:31,681
I love its asphalt highways and its little red Corvettes.

871
02:09:32,381 --> 02:09:35,242
I love its teeming ghetto and its urban sprawl.

872
02:09:37,143 --> 02:09:41,444
I love its old spires, new minarets, and golden menorah.

873
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:46,784
I come in peace and I love America too.

874
02:09:47,886 --> 02:09:51,630
I come in peace and I love America too.

875
02:09:54,935 --> 02:09:55,636
That's our time.

876
02:09:57,718 --> 02:10:00,963
Once again, John Dalton on the drums.

877
02:10:02,298 --> 02:10:06,000
Greg Toro on bass, Jonathan Fagan on the keys.

878
02:10:06,501 --> 02:10:11,444
I'm Terry E. Cotter, that's Linda Lady Morose, and we are the Ally Project.

879
02:10:11,824 --> 02:10:14,186
Thank you so much for joining us this evening.

880
02:10:14,626 --> 02:10:19,670
We appreciate you making it out to this first outdoor jazz festival.

881
02:10:21,111 --> 02:10:28,855
More to come, definitely, but I want to thank our congenial, convivial, loving host, the West Medford Community Center, Incorporated.

882
02:10:29,335 --> 02:10:34,838
I want to thank Arts Alive, Medford Foundation, the Mystic River Watershed Association.

883
02:10:35,259 --> 02:10:47,946
Again, thanks to Cache, the Medford Arts Council, an offshoot of the Massachusetts Cultural Council, Medford Community Media, Audie and Sound Company, out of retirement.

884
02:10:50,307 --> 02:11:08,816
Avi Fagan, Kevin Harrington, Kyle Douglas, Lisa Crossman, our executive director, one of our board members, Melinda is out in the back there.

885
02:11:08,856 --> 02:11:09,696
Thank you, Melinda.

886
02:11:10,697 --> 02:11:13,258
And my man, Nathan.

887
02:11:16,579 --> 02:11:17,440
Nathan Montgomery.

888
02:11:19,362 --> 02:11:23,105
on the cameras, and we've had a blast.

889
02:11:23,125 --> 02:11:24,405
We've had a really good time.

890
02:11:24,706 --> 02:11:25,766
It was a little bit chilly.

891
02:11:26,467 --> 02:11:29,689
There's still refreshments inside, so go in and avail yourself.

892
02:11:29,729 --> 02:11:33,811
Jonathan and I will come in if you want a CD of Jonathan's music.

893
02:11:33,891 --> 02:11:35,573
If you want a book, I've got some books.

894
02:11:36,033 --> 02:11:40,856
And make sure that you stay tuned for what we've got coming up next, okay?

895
02:11:40,876 --> 02:11:43,698
There's always something good happening at the West Memphis Community Center.

896
02:11:44,358 --> 02:11:45,679
All right, God bless y'all.

897
02:11:59,259 --> 02:12:00,460
Oh, you were amazing.

898
02:12:00,580 --> 02:12:01,820
Oh, thank you so much.

899
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:03,941
I was so nervous, and then it was cold.

900
02:12:04,021 --> 02:12:05,501
Oh, you're warm, too?

901
02:12:05,781 --> 02:12:05,901
Oh.

902
02:12:06,422 --> 02:12:07,322
Never leave me.

903
02:12:08,582 --> 02:12:09,082
Oh, yeah.

904
02:12:09,123 --> 02:12:10,323
I'm not going anywhere.

905
02:12:10,363 --> 02:12:12,404
You're going to have to carry me to the car.

906
02:12:33,601 --> 02:12:37,825
Thank you, it's chilly out, so I'm trying my best.

907
02:12:37,905 --> 02:12:39,267
Thank you, oh my gosh.

908
02:13:09,360 --> 02:13:11,062
It makes my heart so happy.

909
02:13:11,182 --> 02:13:12,064
It's really up to them.

910
02:13:12,224 --> 02:13:13,686
I'm just collaborating when I can.
