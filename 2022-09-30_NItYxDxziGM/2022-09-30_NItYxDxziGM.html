    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=111.173s">Hey</a>  Jonathan, how do we help out people who are trying to donate money?</p>

    <p>[Fagan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=115.977s">Huh?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=116.618s">How</a>  do we help out people who are trying to donate money? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=118.58s">Um,</a>  there's a jar inside actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=120.842s">Yeah,</a>  or if it's easier you can go to the vendor. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=124.745s">Yeah,</a>  no, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=126.326s">Yeah,</a>  so there's a jar, there's a jar for cash donation inside.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=129.129s">Oh,</a>  okay, thanks.</p>

    <p>[Fagan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=129.869s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=139.478s">We'll</a>  probably be another five minutes or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=142.001s">You've</a>  got a little bit of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=144.965s">Do</a>  you want a snack, Dad? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=145.786s">What</a>  do we have for snacks? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=147.167s">Pretzels,</a>  chips, popcorn.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=162.18s">So</a>  if we do have to do it.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=245.06s">The</a>  cool kids hang out on the ramp there. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=247.494s">I'm</a>  picking up.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=256.591s">It</a>  looks like everything's fine until it starts. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=258.933s">It's</a>  like when you're playing short stuff and the pitcher hasn't pitched yet, hasn't thrown anything yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=264.758s">The</a>  first note, all power goes out. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=283.336s">The</a>  band swung so hard, it ruined the entire concert. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=290.566s">The</a>  jam was too smooth, so they went personal again.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=296.598s">Blue</a>  is the jazz club.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=318.197s">When</a>  I first started, I used to get gel.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=348.332s">Here,</a>  here. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=350.594s">You</a>  press a color, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=352.054s">It's</a>  like, even a songwriter can do it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=360.54s">Honestly,</a>  yeah, like the mic, it's kind of like, it's fine, because it's like roughly where, in between the keys and the drums. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=368.024s">At</a>  the end of the day, like I said, like, the sound stuff, more concert sound.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=396.979s">Good</a>  evening, ladies and gentlemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=399.82s">My</a>  name is Terry Cotter. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=401.381s">I</a>  manage elder services here at the West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=406.943s">I'm</a>  also the Poet Laureate of Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=414.389s">I</a>  won't get into the whole story because we'll talk again when we come up to play, but I want to introduce you to a friend of mine, a kindred spirit, a guy who's <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=426.937s">musical</a>  abilities I appreciate so much and someone who has, you know, kind of taught me some things about how we can collaborate and cooperate and get together and do things that are meaningful without looking at each other suspiciously or as if we have ulterior motives or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=448.514s">So</a>  the convener, one of the original conveners of the Medford Jazz Festival, <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=454.459s">And</a>  we're hosting it for the first time outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=458.012s">My</a>  friend, Jonathan Fagan.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=464.517s">Thank</a>  you so much, Terry.</p>

    <p>[Fagan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=466.058s">It's</a>  always a blast to get introduced by a poet laureate. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=469.079s">I</a>  don't know how many of you have had that experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=472.0s">Maybe</a>  not very many. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=473.12s">But</a>  anyways, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=474.361s">My</a>  name is Jonathan Fagan. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=475.481s">I'm</a>  the producer of the Medford Jazz Festival, which has actually been going on for quite some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=481.183s">I</a>  joke with my friends that it started in Peter Cobb's laundromat about four years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=486.825s">It</a>  was a place called Wash Vault Lab. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=489.026s">It's</a>  on Boston Avenue in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=491.207s">That</a>  was my first collaboration with, here, let me just, <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=495.126s">get</a>  this out of the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=498.536s">Medford</a>  Arts Council, and then that in turn led us to collaborate with Arts Alive Foundation, who's one of our primary sponsors this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=506.62s">We</a>  launched a Patreon page three years ago, and of course, we were planning on doing the first festival in 2020, but well, 2020 was an interesting year for many reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=517.266s">So</a>  we streamed the whole thing from Bopstop Studios near Medford Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=522.148s">Thank</a>  you so much to George Tresk and all of our tech people that helped us with that, including Nathan Montgomery, who's <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=528.311s">running</a>  cameras tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=529.652s">Yes,</a>  please. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=532.174s">And</a>  so this is, you know, this has been going on for some time, but it's so exciting to finally have a live event. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=540.379s">So</a>  I really appreciate all of you coming and braving the cold weather to, you know, just really have a live audience tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=548.644s">And</a>  thank you also to those on the stream, which has been put together generously by Medford Community Media over there with Kevin Harrington. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=561.036s">Oh,</a>  she's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=562.698s">Thank</a>  you also to my father Avi Fagan for providing the sound. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=567.745s">I've</a>  been joking with people earlier today that I'm kind of bringing him out of retirement here. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=571.471s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=573.368s">Which,</a>  that's the plus of having your dad be a sound engineer, is you can, yes, you have the secret weapon. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=580.211s">Really.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=580.911s">So,</a>  a couple of other people to thank. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=583.913s">Of</a>  course, Terry Carter, for putting together this partnership with the West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=590.116s">It's</a>  been amazing to just have his support at pretty much every juncture of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=595.238s">And</a>  to the executive director, Lisa, who I believe will be... <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=600.558s">Oh,</a>  she's on the run. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=601.279s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=602.079s">Busy</a>  person. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=603.18s">Executive</a>  director. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=604.922s">And</a>  finally to our sponsors themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=608.364s">Starting</a>  with the people that are in our Patreon subscription who pay a couple dollars each month and they really do help raise money for events like this and also our monthly jam sessions which we've been doing quite a few of actually over the past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=622.755s">We've</a>  had <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=623.596s">between</a>  five and six over the past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=625.498s">It's</a>  a great opportunity for a lot of adult students to get to play with professionals and for local musicians to network. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=632.524s">There</a>  is so much talent here in the Medford area. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=635.047s">It's</a>  still surprising to me every single month that we do it and someone shows up and great players. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=643.134s">Thank</a>  you also to the Arts Alive Foundation, which is run by Mae Marbeck. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=647.99s">which</a>  has donated quite a bit to help make this possible and expand this into a two-day festival, to the Medford Arts Council for their continued support, to CACHE, which is a really wonderful organization here in Medford that connects a lot of artistic people to each other, and to the Mystic River Watershed Association, which really stepped in and also made this possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=674.215s">So</a>  I hope I'm not forgetting anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=676.518s">I</a>  don't think I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=677.619s">We</a>  have had a lot of support this year, which is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=682.325s">Last,</a>  just a couple housekeeping things. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=684.187s">Bathrooms</a>  are inside, obviously, along with a donation. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=689.493s">A</a>  donation jar if you feel moved by what you see and hear today. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=693.977s">Please</a>  consider donating to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=695.759s">Really</a>  everything does matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=697.62s">I</a>  know it's a cliche, but a couple dollars at a time is how we've gotten to where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=702.524s">There</a>  are CDs for sale and books for sale inside by both Terry and I. And there are snacks available for purchase for just a couple dollars each. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=712.012s">And</a>  I believe there will be some hot chocolate and coffee out there later. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=717.276s">So</a>  without further ado, I will introduce this first group, which is actually an ensemble of adult students that I've had the pleasure of working with over the past couple years over at Morningside Music Studio in Arlington, calling this the Beacon Blue Jazz Quintet. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=734.808s">So</a>  why don't you guys come on up and we'll get started. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=803.711s">One,</a>  two, one, two, three, four.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=919.705s">do</a> </p>

    <p>[Fagan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1080.425s">Oh,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1080.885s">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1081.846s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1083.207s">That</a>  was a Grant Green composition called Flood in Franklin Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1087.109s">Let</a>  me just take a second to introduce this band. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1089.191s">So</a>  we have Jeff Hopwood on the trumpet over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1094.294s">Steven</a>  Weber on the saxophone. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1097.556s">David</a>  Sands on the bass. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1100.558s">Bill</a>  Kuklinski on guitar. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1104.121s">And</a>  Mike Chen is all the way over there, hidden a little bit by the lights, but holding it down on drums. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1111.994s">And</a>  I'm still Jonathan Fagan, and I play piano. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1115.995s">We're</a>  going to do one of my favorite things to do as both an educator and just as an all-around musician is to have my students write things. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1124.838s">And</a>  I feel like our trumpet player, Jeff, has definitely taken up that challenge to a different level this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1131.7s">And</a>  so he calls this one One Beer Blues. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1134.921s">Because</a>  as he explained it to me, when you have one beer, you're not feeling so great. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1140.023s">It's</a>  only when you get past that point that things tend to improve. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1144.644s">Is</a>  that a correct paraphrase? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1147.145s">OK,</a>  yeah, there we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1148.785s">So</a>  this is the, I mean, well, we'll see where it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1152.406s">Maybe</a>  it'll evolve into two-beer territory, but we'll see. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1156.227s">So</a>  the one-beer blues, here we go.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1167.601s">One,</a>  two, one, two, three, four. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1410.319s">Mm</a>  hmm.</p>

    <p>[Fagan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1481.776s">All</a>  right, The One Beer Blues by Jeff Hopwood. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1484.597s">We're</a>  going to play one of mine now. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1487.258s">When</a>  I can, I love giving my groups some of my compositions just to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1492.7s">This</a>  one is called The Dreamcatcher. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1494.881s">It</a>  was written right after, well, a couple days after I saw Kenny Garrett. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1500.303s">It's</a>  a great alto saxophone player who's inspired me in a number of ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1504.385s">So</a>  it has some hints of Kenny Garrett in it, but probably a number of other things, too.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1596.34s">Music</a>  playing</p>

    <p>[Fagan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1936.792s">All</a>  right, we're going to do, well, all of the tunes that we've been working on recently are totally different in some ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1944.315s">As</a>  a matter of fact, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1945.395s">As</a>  a matter of fact, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1946.776s">This</a>  next one actually was brought in by our guitar player, Bill Kuklinski.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1952.558s">You</a>  were there, too.</p>

    <p>[Fagan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1953.419s">I</a>  was there, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1954.699s">That</a>  is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1956.06s">I</a>  was going to say, Bill and I a couple of years ago went on one of Morningside Music Studios <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1962.728s">basically</a>  music tours and we ended up in Venice with an amazing vocalist named Sheila Jordan but along the way we also met a bass player named Alvise Seiji who wrote this tune and <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1976.465s">Well,</a>  Bill was the one that still had the music, somehow. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1980.288s">Because</a>  he liked the song, and he remembers to keep things on, like me, sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1988.794s">So</a>  we're going to play it for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1989.734s">This</a>  one's called African Colors. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1991.256s">And</a>  then after that, we're going to do a Hoagy Carmichael ballad, which is one of my favorites. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=1995.959s">That</a>  one's called The Nearness of You.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=2568.007s">do</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=2592.668s">So,</a> </p>

there watching this on your computers, your laptops, your television on 3 or 47, we appreciate, we appreciate you being with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4333.047s">As</a>  Jonathan said earlier, Medford Jazz Festival also has a Patreon account, so if you want to contribute to Patreon, we have information about that inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4345.457s">When</a>  we finish up, Jonathan and I both have some product, as they call it, in the trade. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4350.501s">He</a>  has some CDs. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4352.343s">I</a>  have some of my fifth book. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4354.745s">I'm</a>  working on my sixth now. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4358.74s">Jonathan</a>  and I basically met at the intersection of jazz and social justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4364.223s">So</a>  that's what we call this music. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4366.945s">Music</a>  is, to a great extent, that intersection where jazz, which has always been a progressive thing in the United States, meets social justice, which is really becoming a <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4380.792s">a</a>  thing all over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4382.615s">So</a>  we're happy to be working together under any circumstances, but we think it's necessary for us to work together under these particular circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4394.87s">So</a>  by his definition and in my agreement, this is the Ally Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4404.643s">And</a>  I want to introduce the players. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4407.086s">Over</a>  here on the traps, on the drums, John Dalton. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4412.936s">And</a>  John's got like six, seven different groups that he plays with, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4418.04s">He's</a>  got a great, great group called Spheres of Influence. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4422.504s">Spheres</a>  of Influence, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4425.426s">S-P-H-E-R-E-S,</a>  Spheres of Influence. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4430.31s">And</a>  they do some real, real good edgy stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4434.994s">We</a>  got my man Greg Turow on what I call the big sexy, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4442.129s">That</a>  stand up bass with the hourglass figure. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4445.332s">It's</a>  real cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4446.813s">And</a>  then my friend, and really Jonathan found me. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4450.917s">I</a>  think he had seen something that I did maybe at Martin Luther King. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4455.742s">Was</a>  it Martin Luther King Day? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4458.103s">And</a>  he sought me out, and we just started talking about how we could again integrate this theme of jazz, him as a musician, a composer, an arranger, a teacher, a man of many talents, and me as a humble poet. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4472.873s">And</a>  before you know it, this thing just started to evolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4476.495s">So</a>  a little over a month ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4480.788s">We</a>  were in the studio recording our first CD. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4485.132s">And</a>  we brought together this group, but also a very talented woman, who you'll hear some from a little bit later. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4493.639s">Her</a>  name is Linda. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4494.68s">Call</a>  her Lady Morose. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4496.702s">And</a>  I found her. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4501.085s">based</a>  on another friend who's also a musician and a poet named Max Heinig. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4505.688s">And</a>  Max teaches at Medford High School and she was one of his students and when he recorded his recent CD, which I actually contributed a song to, Linda was his singer. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4517.494s">And</a>  I heard her at the Medford Public Library and I was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4521.716s">I</a>  was completely done. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4522.777s">I</a>  said, you know, when Jonathan and I were talking, we said, well, you know, maybe we could get a singer to add some layers, a little bit of subtext to this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4530.981s">And</a>  I said, I got just the person. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4533.322s">Hence,</a>  Linda will be singing with us in a little while. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4536.584s">So</a>  we're going to get to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4539.005s">This</a>  first piece really defines the relationship of this community, West Medford, with greater Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4547.876s">And</a>  it's a historical but somewhat fragmented relationship. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4553.924s">And</a>  again, it began <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4558.348s">probably</a>  15, 20 years after the Civil War, and has evolved to a very different West Medford than the West Medford that I grew up with, but that's another story for another poem. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4570.891s">This</a>  piece is called Hired by the Mystic. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4578.253s">They</a>  gave my people the lowlands, and not much of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4583.094s">Just</a>  a few streets high by the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4585.854s">Banks</a>  turned a blind eye behind the red lines, and it wasn't about the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4590.498s">Class</a>  was an irresistible force. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4593.761s">Race</a>  was an immovable object. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4596.884s">Perhaps</a>  it wasn't a written rule, but white folks knew the legal tool to keep us in our place in this mystic valley space, where slaves and rum and chips had built some mansions, made some millionaires, and hid some old money. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4613.422s">So</a>  it was hard by the mystic we went. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4616.783s">Muddy</a>  and a bit turned down. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4618.903s">The</a>  only place where one could be brown in this ancient Middlesex County town. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4624.664s">But</a>  we named it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4626.085s">We</a>  claimed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4627.225s">We</a>  made it our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4630.566s">Even</a>  in the heat of summer when the shores were pipes and the soil was rank with the decay of aquatic alchemy, we were one with the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4639.247s">We</a>  followed its flow to the lakes and the sandy beachfront. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4646.141s">Like</a>  our own Jordan Shore, we baptized and blessed our brothers and sisters in Christ. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4651.704s">We</a>  caught the little fishes to go with our loaves of bread and became the teaming multitude who our Lord Jesus fed, hired by the mission. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4662.569s">We</a>  became community. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4664.41s">We</a>  commanded unity. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4666.231s">We</a>  embraced the village and raised up our children in the way they should go. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4672.066s">As</a>  the river ebbs and flows, the tide will turn and our fortune grows. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4677.81s">A</a>  few more streets become our home. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4680.632s">Houses</a>  on Sharon join Kin on Jerome. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4684.415s">From</a>  Duggar Park to the railroad tracks, the landed folks make more room for blacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4690.419s">The</a>  color line recedes a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4693.141s">Church</a>  and school and center sit. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4696.523s">The</a>  Ville becomes the heart of it, hard by the mystic shore. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4713.854s">Now</a>  the worm has surely turned, and folks who left have surely learned things couldn't stay the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4721.792s">The</a>  muddy mystic most days is clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4724.393s">The</a>  banks are freshly cut and green. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4727.634s">Faces</a>  once distinctly brown are not the only ones in town. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4732.756s">The</a>  streets that once were our confines must now embrace what gentry defined. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4740.038s">Condominium</a>  culture, bedroom convenience, university sprawl, access, e-graph, access, <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4755.595s">Now</a>  those lowlands have become the highlights of a trending city and sometimes that success isn't pretty when it's at the expense of your black and brown and tan family. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4769.528s">And</a>  yet, the river still turns and bends from where it begins to where it ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4782.711s">the</a>  only place where one could be brown in this ancient Middlesex County town where we named it and claimed it and made it our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4806.143s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4806.703s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4807.644s">So</a>  now that you have a bit of the history, <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4813.208s">I</a>  want to talk institutionally. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4816.069s">And</a>  in West Medford, when I was growing up, there were three, maybe four institutions that were really, really important to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4823.812s">Now</a>  you're sitting in the patio of one of them, West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4827.114s">This</a>  is the second building on the site, but this organization goes back 1945-ish. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4833.775s">Okay,</a>  when a group of men from West Medford determined that they needed a place to be somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4840.386s">So</a>  they actually carted up from <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4844.535s">temporary</a>  military installation in Charlestown, what's called a Quonset hut, or military barracks in pieces. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4852.54s">They</a>  brought it to this site, they poured a foundation, and they built the original West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4858.464s">This</a>  is the second iteration of that building, and so this is one of the great institutions of the West Medford Community Center, West Medford Community. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4869.284s">The</a>  other great institution was called Shiloh Baptist Church, and it's on the corner of Holton and Bower Streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4875.326s">It's</a>  still there, it's still ministering to the needs of a predominantly African American congregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4884.309s">And</a>  then the third institution was not as, not what you think it would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4891.211s">It's</a>  not a school, it's not a university, it's not, let me just read the poem. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4897.874s">The</a>  Little Store. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4917.0s">It</a>  was a tiny red hovel on upper Jerome, a bit rundown and rough around the edges. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4923.443s">And</a>  Mr. Henry seemed so old to us, even then, with a lot of whiskers, impatient and a little scary. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4932.381s">One</a>  would suspect that he didn't even like kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4935.562s">But</a>  he really must have loved us. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4939.142s">Or</a>  else, where did all that penny candy come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4943.823s">He</a>  had all of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4944.843s">No,</a>  no, seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4946.664s">We'd</a>  bust in there with a few nickels or a handful of pennies, all loud and unruly. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4953.745s">He'd</a>  hush us up while he finished with grown folks' business. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4957.998s">Then</a>  he'd be back like a black Willy Wonka up in that old shack. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4962.043s">He'd</a>  peer over those old horn rimmed glasses and tell us he didn't have all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4966.389s">Then</a>  he'd blow open one of those small brown craft paper bags and get to stuffing while we were oohing and aahing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4976.82s">Muffin</a>  and Puffin. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4978.962s">See,</a>  Mr. Henry had all the treats. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4982.545s">All</a>  of our favorites. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4984.066s">100</a>  great sweets. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4987.389s">Root</a>  beer barrels and pixie sticks. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4989.49s">Squirrel</a>  nut zippers and banana splits. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4991.632s">Green</a>  mint juleps and button strips. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4993.754s">Red</a>  licorice ropes and bottle nips. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4996.056s">He</a>  had bazooka Joe bubble gum. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=4998.758s">And</a>  a tiny sucker called a dum-dum. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5001.0s">Yaw</a>  breakers and Tootsie Rolls. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5003.702s">Sugary</a>  love for little kids sold. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5006.947s">Candy</a>  necklaces to wear and fight, and waxy red lips were such a sight. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5012.876s">Fat</a>  gum cigars and kid cigarettes right beside the crunchy sticks. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5020.132s">Hot</a>  fireballs and Mexican hats. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5025.156s">Just</a>  the genuine Percy's kisses. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5028.418s">All</a>  of the hits and none of the misses. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5031.84s">Like</a>  kids' taffy squares and Necco wafers. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5034.822s">Liquor</a>  made in Boston may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5037.384s">Gold</a>  rocks, nuggets of gum in a bag. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5063.663s">from</a>  cold January to chilly December. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5068.186s">More</a>  kinds of candy than I can remember at the Mill storefront on Upper Jerome. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5074.871s">I</a>  knew I had to write this poem. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5077.533s">See,</a>  Mr. Henry had all of the treats, all of our favorites, a hundred great sweets. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5093.82s">So</a>  now I have the distinct pleasure of welcoming to the stage our collaborator, our friend, a muse of sorts, Linda Lady Moreau. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5114.358s">We're</a>  gonna do an old tune, a takeoff on an old tune by Nat Simon, popularized by the pianist Ahmed Jamal. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5124.244s">That</a>  tune was called Poinciana, and this riff on Poinciana is called Reprise for Poinciana. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5141.428s">Perfect</a>  a fantasy in black and tan. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5145.049s">Between</a>  the Savoy ballroom and a Paris can-can. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5149.27s">The</a>  kind of blue that doesn't get you down. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5152.291s">It</a>  rather has you twirling round and round and round. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5156.232s">Kind</a>  of blue, but not really. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5161.397s">Like</a>  a conversation between Miles and Q in a smoke-filled corner, just those two talking about the music round midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5170.022s">Miles</a>  and that miraculous horn, all gravel-voicing, full of scorn, asking Q, what made you feel like doing stuff like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5179.267s">Jazz</a>  finds justice in the majesty of the blues. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5182.809s">Take</a>  five to wonder, and you'll know that this is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5186.711s">Deep</a>  and delicious all over. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5190.728s">Pondered</a>  passionately in pianissimo, keeping standard time. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5196.571s">Duke's</a>  mood indigo, Joe Sample's rainbow seeker, Errol Garner's misty worship in the style of G. You know the melody, songs you just can't get out of your head. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5207.517s">Kind</a>  of blue, but not really. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5212.466s">just</a>  like the woman whose name you call as autumn leaves begin to fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5218.836s">Or</a>  maybe like that melody by Ahmad Jamal. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5224.281s">Po-en-ci-a-na.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5226.723s">Last</a>  days of sun and sand and sea. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5229.845s">You</a>  and your love and the music made three. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5233.467s">A</a>  lyric so familiar, a song so free, so sweet. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5237.95s">Ebony</a>  notes on an ivory sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5240.252s">New</a>  tear stains on every page. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5242.614s">A</a>  bit of your heart in a crystal cage. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5246.416s">Kind</a>  of blue, but not really. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5251.892s">You'll</a>  remember her most round midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5255.415s">Poesiana,</a>  fragrant, fresh wind recollections, a song reprise.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5276.516s">Miles</a>  in queue in that smoke-filled corner, talking about taking the A train, going up to Smalls Paradise. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5283.583s">Sassy's</a>  going to be scatting, and Hawk's band is in town, doing jazz some real justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5291.391s">Marvelous,</a>  majestic, and kind of blue, but not really. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5298.496s">You'll</a>  remember her most round midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5300.878s">Po-en-ci-a-na.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5302.979s">Pungent</a>  rose petal pictures, a song reprise.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5306.461s">The</a>  first time ever I saw your face.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5324.295s">fantasy</a>  perfected in cocoa and cream, Harlem nights in a Moulin Rouge daydream, the kind of blue that fills your soul, engulfs your spirit, and makes you whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5338.943s">My</a>  Poinciana, I'll remember you most round midnight, frail fragments of love's fulfillment, kind of blue, but not really. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5352.267s">Your</a>  song, reprise.</p>

just know, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5394.366s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5397.169s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5399.011s">I</a>  mean, at the intersection of jazz and social justice, there's some real nice music, but there's also some dangerous stuff that's taking place, some dangerous stuff that we have to take into account and play about. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5414.439s">So</a>  we're gonna play a piece called Microaggressions. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5431.035s">You'll</a>  never know what this feels like. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5432.777s">24-7,</a>  365, 366 in the leap year, and it's definitely a black thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5442.147s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5443.389s">I'm</a>  so glad you asked. <a

href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5449.976s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5450.717s">Because</a>  you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5452.403s">The</a>  skin

just because. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5474.41s">Nobody</a>  sprints and cuffs you without provocation just because, just because of the skin you're in. <a

href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5511.569s">You</a>  can't feel the tightness and discomfort in every step I have to take in a whitewashed world. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5525.241s">But</a>  why? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5526.882s">Why</a>  does it take 26 bullets to subdue a black boy with his back turned and no weapon save a cell phone? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5534.656s">Why</a>  do major corporations like Unilever, H&M, and Heineken perpetuate racial stereotypes with tone-deaf advertising on the regular? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5546.729s">Why</a>  does the sitting potent think it's okay to call the country where my people came from, home? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5557.355s">Why</a>  does a black child in grade school get put out of class for the same type of force play, or youthful obstinance, or mild assertiveness that gets his white classmate a simple, Johnny, behave yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5587.739s">You</a>  don't know how it feels to see the smiling faces of rednecks and Klansmen, Klanswomen and Klanskids standing hundreds deep in a field where the charred body of a black boy is dangling from a noose on the bow of an ancient oak tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5606.789s">Perhaps</a>  the Jew does when he sees the image of naked bodies piled in the rigor of death at Auschwitz or Dachau. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5615.731s">Perhaps</a>  the native Apache or Cherokee does when she sees the grainy illustrations of the forced death marches of her ancestors across the Trail of Tears. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5628.719s">Perhaps</a>  the Japanese immigrant does when he remembers the barbed wire perimeters and horse stables converted to living quarters for the forced internment of potential enemy agents. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5641.848s">But</a>  you, <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5643.345s">heir</a>  to Anglo-Euro spoils of colonial conquest and systemic privilege do not have radar for this, do not have a frame of reference for this, do not have an appreciation of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5658.997s">You</a>  do not have the emotional intelligence for these little hurts of the heart, bee stings to the brain, sucker punches to the soul, spilled milk of the spirit. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5671.587s">You</a>  say, <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5673.536s">It's</a>  nothing we think you should cry over, even as you watch us sometimes die over. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5679.221s">These</a>  microaggressions, these race-fueled transgressions, this constant procession of slings and arrows that seldom miss the target when the bullseye is black like me. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5706.488s">So</a>  people ask sometimes, why are you so angry? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5711.693s">And</a>  I try to tell them I'm a loving and compassionate person. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5716.377s">I'm</a>  a man of faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5719.22s">I'm</a>  not angry. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5720.781s">I'm</a>  resolute. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5722.423s">I</a>  think it's important that we tell the truth and shame the devil. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5726.426s">I</a>  think it's important that <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5729.52s">We</a>  talk about the things that are issues between us because if we can't bridge the gulfs, and there are many between us, we're in for a long and bumpy ride. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5741.39s">But</a>  the neighborhood that I grew up in, West Medford, has changed an awful lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5746.655s">It</a>  was at one time a very nuclear African-American neighborhood that <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5753.803s">took</a>  up about eight or 10 streets, right around where we are now. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5758.704s">But</a>  things are changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5759.885s">Part</a>  of the change is actually going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5761.685s">I</a>  don't know if you can see it right beside us. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5764.086s">It's</a>  a multi-unit dwelling in front of a house that, in all honesty, we used to own, but that's another story for another day. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5773.188s">But</a>  I wanna play, we wanna play a little tune for you called Gentrified. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5793.37s">They</a>  talk about renovating, reimagining, and rehabilitating. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5797.692s">They</a>  rave about new visions, new horizons, and new perspectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5802.073s">They</a>  revel in bistros, boutiques, and boulangeries. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5805.494s">They</a>  fairly skip to the subway stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5808.055s">They</a>  bike on the painted pathways. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5810.096s">They</a>  Uber and Lyft religiously. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5812.517s">Everything's</a>  on trend and on point and au pair. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5817.059s">They've</a>  codified the way they speak about what used to be urban blight, eyesores, drug dens, crack houses, tenements, and slums, the ghetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5827.201s">They've</a>  modified the way they speak about what we now see, makeovers, investment properties, B&Bs, brownstones, townhouses, condos, and co-ops. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5838.303s">Everything's</a>  vintage, bohemian, artsy, and retro, with creative green spaces and lofted open places. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5848.183s">Speculators</a>  bought lower than low, patiently waiting for the change, waiting for the junkies to move on, waiting for the squatters to give up, waiting for the blacks and the browns and the tans to fade. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5864.005s">They</a>  waited for the graffiti to erode. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5866.988s">They</a>  waited for the chain link to corrode. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5869.671s">They</a>  waited for the family to implode. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5871.894s">They</a>  waited for the prices to explode. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5875.778s">They</a>  waited, and they calculated. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5878.701s">They</a>  waited as folks capitulated. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5881.083s">They</a>  waited as folks evacuated. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5883.867s">They</a>  waited as folks migrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5890.987s">Then</a>  the realtors came and dispelled white folks' fears. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5894.393s">The</a>  architects came and re-engineered. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5897.098s">The</a>  designers came and changed the veneers. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5900.084s">The</a>  builders came and the new folk cheered. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5904.028s">Now</a>  they've moved closer to work in the city, to quartz countertops that made kitchens pretty, to chowder schools, nannies, and drivers, and bite frames made with carbon fibers, to Starbucks lattes and artisanal breads, and articulated sleep number beds, to million dollar urban show places, and fewer and fewer black and brown faces. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5930.629s">They</a>  showed us their heels when they took the white flight. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5933.37s">Then</a>  they crept back in in the dead of night. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5936.03s">With</a>  fat bank accounts, they were IPO wealthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5939.791s">Their</a>  move to this place was measured and stealthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5944.953s">All</a>  of the potholes now smoothly paved over. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5948.033s">Brown</a>  folks got schooled like a Curry crossover. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5951.354s">White</a>  folks doing a long-term sleepover. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5954.175s">Exclusive,</a>  obtrusive, extreme home makeover. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5959.389s">full</a>  of sugar, they took all the clover. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5965.737s">Changing</a>  the context of neighborhood with subway tile and exotic wood. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5970.783s">Harlem,</a>  Detroit, and Chicago's South Side. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5974.207s">Boston's</a>  South End surely gentrified. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5977.731s">Empty</a>  the church. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5979.545s">Emptied</a>  the steeple, now it's a spot for the chai-drinking people. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5983.849s">Took</a>  down the poles and the basketball hoops, now it's a park for the dog-walking troops. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5989.233s">No</a>  more rec and community center, but a new parking lot for the monthly renters. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=5999.175s">Some</a>  folks hang on, but the die is cast. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6002.84s">The</a>  fire consumes and the torch is passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6006.204s">Invisible</a>  lines are drawn again, and the folks can't buy when the banks won't lend. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6013.737s">Some</a>  folks keep their roots in the ground, but the waiting game is deep and profound. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6019.119s">They</a>  tour the streets noting history, yet what they want is no mystery. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6024.921s">Holland,</a>  Detroit, and Chicago's South Side, a reoccupation is being applied to model cities that trickle down, no longer suited to black and brown. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6037.062s">The</a>  urban sprawl that used to be the only homes that we got to see is now the place for growing infusion, is now the space that the gentry is choosing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6070.08s">low-rise</a>  projects slowly yield to equity building leases sealed to folks who came from far afield who won the fight when the poor folk appealed to lawyers and doctors and high-tech heroes with Trust Fund One and Hedge Fund Zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6088.47s">No</a>  preserving community, no real thought of legacy, a small flag here, a street sign there, nothing that bronzes the atmosphere. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6099.381s">Oakland,</a>  Brooklyn, and New Orleans, all made targets by whites with means. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6105.263s">Even</a>  in venerable chocolate cities, the news in the district inspires some pity. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6132.307s">killing</a>  the concept of neighborhood in ways they've never understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6136.489s">And</a>  now we witness the slow, painful slide as the village we built becomes gentrified. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6158.163s">My</a>  mother used to say, life is hard, but fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6160.424s">You</a>  had a good home, but you didn't stay there. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6164.045s">So</a>  I want to bring back our friend, our muse, Linda Moreau, and she's going to join me for a tune we call Legacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6182.711s">How</a>  you folks holding up? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6184.838s">Good,</a>  good, good. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6185.819s">You</a>  enjoying yourselves? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6186.96s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6187.48s">All</a>  right, all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6188.281s">When</a>  we do this the next time, we've got to definitely make sure that we do it in warmer weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6197.149s">And</a>  the forecast tomorrow suggests rain, suggested very dramatically. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6203.534s">So</a>  we are assuming that we will be inside tomorrow as opposed to outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6210.531s">So</a>  hopefully if you come back tomorrow, you won't have to suffer through the chill. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6218.587s">You</a>  good to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6256.642s">It's</a>  not for you to tell your own story. <a

href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6267.57s">And</a>  yet, you have not gathered them up and bid them sit before the campfires of their elders. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6274.531s">You</a>  have not seasoned their meals with the spice of their identity and the savor of their name. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6282.073s">How</a>  will they learn to walk the walk and talk the talk? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6286.454s">How</a>  will they learn to tell your story even as they live out their own? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6292.036s">Sons</a>  and daughters and heirs, if you didn't smell the burning ash or feel the warmth of the flame on your neck, you don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6302.529s">If</a>  you didn't revel in the growl of the griot's earthly reply or the trill of the mockingbird's cry, you don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6311.235s">If</a>  mama was too tired and daddy too long gone to carry the wood, light the spark, and stoke the flames, you don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6322.363s">And</a>  until the lion cub knows how to tell the pride story, the hunters will always tell them first. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6340.834s">The</a>  good book says, train up the child in the way they should go. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6344.776s">Will</a>  we let them depart from the community of faith and the city on a hill without the master's touch, without the oil of his anointing and his full measure of grace? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6358.936s">Will</a>  we not show them Anansi's clever ways, Popo and Fafina's journey, Muparo's beautiful daughters, the people who could fly, the wonders of Wakanda, and Song Kololo's news hacky. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6375.27s">The</a>  prophet says he will encourage fathers and their children to return. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6379.953s">But</a>  how will they know the way home if no map charts the seas, measures the roads, cites the peaks and valleys, and names each forest despite the thickening stream? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6393.066s">Will</a>  the burden of the elder stories be too heavy for the children? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6396.829s">Will</a>  they care to carry? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6398.611s">Will</a>  they dare to tarry? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6401.413s">Will</a>  they linger at the foot of the griot? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6403.334s">Will</a>  they hunger for the wisdom of the sage? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6407.318s">We</a>  must put them on the page, where hard work earns the man his wage, where power is measured by God's own gauge, where miracles scarf at the wand of a maid. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6422.335s">We</a>  must share with them the truth that is loyal and fierce like Naomi and Ruth, that doesn't wait for the confessional boot, that has the bite of the panther's tooth. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6440.529s">This</a>  is a gift of legacy, where a glorious past sets the captives free, and a candle's light beckons liberty. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6450.459s">sons</a>  and daughters and heir. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6454.241s">I</a>  bid you sit before the campfires of your elders, hear their stories, gather up their stones, and build up your strength. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6464.686s">They</a>  will show you Anansi's club away, Popo and Fafina's journey, Mufaro's

<a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6494.335s">With</a>  each quickening step, <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6496.658s">You</a>  repel the arrows of the hunter with the shield of abiding faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6501.223s">You</a>  capture the flags of your enemies and gather up their spoils. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6505.607s">You</a>  remain the lions of your pride and your children, your tales will always be your children's friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6522.585s">You</a>  will never abandon the community of faith, though you build a thousand cities on a hill, drawing wondrous strength from the master's touch, as the oil of his anointing fills your clay jars with his grace. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6545.918s">Linda</a>  Morales. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6556.095s">So</a>  you're in what has been traditionally called The Ville, probably short for village, but I'm not 100% sure of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6571.419s">And</a>  it's also called The Hood, short for The Neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6576.24s">So</a>  we're gonna do a piece called Neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6603.123s">Neighborhood</a>  is a place where mothers buy extra food for kids that aren't even their own, on the premise that they will eventually show up hungry. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6613.948s">Neighborhood</a>  is grandmas and grandpas that raise their children's children long after they've raised their own, lovingly, carefully, happily, long after they've raised their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6628.055s">Neighborhood</a>  is that corner bodega where the nice Spanish man always gave you 10 cents worth of penny candy when all you ever had was a nickel. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6638.725s">Neighborhood</a>  is the homeowner that doesn't look down his nose at the frazzled rental with the Section 8 and a few kids without a daddy. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6647.819s">Neighborhood</a>  is the block party that everyone comes to. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6652.022s">And</a>  nobody calls the cops. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6654.283s">No</a>  drugs, no guns, no drama. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6658.245s">Cooling</a>  the gang, earth, wind, and fire, Rick James, Tina Marie, and Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6668.621s">Neighborhood</a>  knows everybody's name but isn't collecting big data on anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6673.906s">Keeps</a>  tabs on strangers but doesn't discriminate based on color or caste or custom. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6683.3s">Neighborhood</a>  keeps pies and cookies ready to welcome newcomers, and always has something to invite folk to, and always has something good to eat when you get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6694.745s">Neighborhood</a>  loves all of its children, watches out for all of the babies, disciplines fairly, drops dimes carefully, daps up consistently, and marches for justice dutifully. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6708.697s">Neighborhood</a>  cares for its sick with homemade chicken soup, ginger tea, flowers, cards, and pastoral visits. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6717.141s">Never</a>  lets you feel lonely, never leaves you alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6721.823s">Neighborhood</a>  laments the loss of its kings and queens reverently, even while it celebrates their lives jubilantly and recollects their ways permanently. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6734.81s">Neighborhood</a>  has well-worn welcome mats and four-way stop signs, a community gathering place as the hub of the wheels, and nicknames like The Port, The Coast, and The Ville. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6749.133s">Neighborhood</a>  says yes more than it says no, chooses love over hate, never cries when it could laugh, and never laughs when it should cry. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6760.089s">Neighborhood</a>  understands the importance of respect, covers everyone with an umbrella, shovels snow for its elders, pronounces your name right, and picks up the poop left by its dog. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6772.875s">Small,</a>  medium, and large. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6777.697s">And</a>  no matter where you go, neighborhood is always the place you call home. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6795.692s">Once</a>  again, John Dalton on drums, Greg Toro on bass, Jonathan Fagan on the keys. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6803.197s">So</a>  again, that intersection of jazz and social justice, I'm gonna take it back a little bit and forward at the same time with a piece we call Riding Up Front. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6837.281s">can't</a>  do it don't even ask me black it's a bus but i ain't riding in the back young bloods ain't got no idea of how long we had to ride in the red in the lazy south american apothecary the law of the land was stratified seats up front unoccupied yet a pregnant brown girl can sit and ride <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6861.25s">Elders,</a>  toddlers, just didn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6863.793s">And</a>  don't let them hear no race talk or chatter. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6866.857s">Redneck</a>  drivers would put us out. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6869.78s">But</a>  y'all don't know what I'm talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6872.631s">Then</a>  along came courageous Rosa Parks, tired and weary, but full of sparks. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6880.117s">Took</a>  a seat in the first few rows, seeking not chaos, but simple repose. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6886.263s">Think</a>  them whites heard what she was saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6888.565s">Hell</a>  no, and them crackers for sure wasn't playing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6891.627s">She</a>  held up Miss Rosa without dignity, commending her acts to our history. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6900.845s">You</a>  don't have no gratitude, no pride in self, just attitude. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6906.327s">You</a>  make your way to the back of the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6908.967s">You</a>  drink and smoke and holler and cuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6912.168s">You</a>  say it's your prerogative. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6914.689s">You</a>  say it's just the way you live. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6917.51s">You</a>  just don't get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6919.411s">You</a>  just don't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6921.371s">So</a>  cavalier, so unaware. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6925.535s">But</a>  I can't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6927.036s">Don't</a>  even ask me, black. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6928.797s">It's</a>  a bust. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6929.718s">But</a>  I ain't riding in the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6932.259s">Three</a>  seats up front. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6934.32s">That's</a>  for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6935.721s">I'm</a>  digging Miss Rose's legacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6939.764s">Here</a>  it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6953.272s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6954.485s">We</a>  are getting to the good part. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6958.628s">So</a>  as I said earlier, in the jazz canon, there are these signature tunes that if you know jazz, you can be anywhere and hear three or four notes and you can name that tune. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6972.459s">This</a>  is one of those tunes written, composed, and played by the legendary John Coltrane. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6982.654s">was</a>  called Naima. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6984.135s">Our</a>  take on it is called Reprise for Naima. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6992.118s">He</a>  would blow this note in the midnight air. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=6996.32s">Aloft</a>  in the ether, it floats out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7000.042s">Staccato</a>  cadence sets a mood of bluesy lyrical attitude. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7005.791s">Improvisational</a>  mystery like Monk's piano epistrophe, or Miles' tone poem in a silent way, and Flanagan's peace at the end of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7015.797s">Syncopated</a>  and sharp, bright tone, a countdown to stardust, a twilight zone, like a blue train running against the night, setting the pace then out of sight. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7026.075s">With</a>  Hartman crooning of bags-on vibes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7028.917s">Trios,</a>  duets, quartets, and tribes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7032.099s">The</a>  blues, the ballads, the avant-garde. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7035.202s">Incredibly</a>  gorgeous, impossibly hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7039.985s">Giant</a>  steps move us miles ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7042.307s">Cooking</a>  up bop for Harlem street cred. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7044.608s">Melodies</a>  hand to the harmony wed. <a

href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7055.623s">them</a>  heard what the master said. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7059.584s">How</a>  could he make the bitter taste sweeter? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7062.165s">How</a>  could a tortured mind delete her? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7064.146s">How</a>  could the mellowed scotch be neater? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7066.807s">How</a>  could the smoke from each cigarette create blue notes that cast a net, create blue beads of cascading sweat, create blue haze that compounds regret, create blue nights that we can't forget? <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7082.369s">Coltrane's</a>  notes are a crystal scale, a velvet scream in the urban travail, the heavenly riff of a love supreme, the pungent whip of his lover's theme. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7096.12s">Coltrane's</a>  knots are a cozy romance, the breezy bounce of a bop and a dance, the languid lilt of stray's lush life, the cadence cut by the artist's knife. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7108.597s">Coltrane's</a>  notes are a standard refine, like gold in a pan or gemstones mine, the sparkling glow of a hopeful dream, hot black coffee with a hint of cream. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7121.864s">Coltrane's</a>  notes are Naima's reprise, like madness that brings a man to his knees, or sadness that comes when lovers part, the gladness removed from the balladeer's heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7139.403s">A</a>  tight arrangement cuts the gloom. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7141.745s">The</a>  melody sends that love's in bloom. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7144.068s">The</a>  harmony spirit engulfs the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7146.29s">The</a>  bride says yes to her lyrical broom. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7148.892s">The</a>  groove and the beat then jumps the broom. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7151.395s">The</a>  kick drum resounds with a sonic boom. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7156.62s">As</a>  genius is birthed in a soul-filled room. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7167.799s">Musical</a>  mythology mocks a twisted path the hero walks. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7172.423s">With</a>  sealed and sword the hero stalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7174.945s">The</a>  tempest shakes her twisted locks. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7177.287s">Medusa</a>  snakes his vision shocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7179.529s">Holds</a>  up the mirror to stony blocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7181.53s">The</a>  harp and the horn melt icy rocks. <a

href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7244.773s">Coltrane's</a>  notes are a rollercoaster, a hallelujah and a paternoster, the glorious jolt of the maestro's hand, the saxophone titan is in command. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7256.138s">Coltrane's</a>  notes are a crazy rhythm, the squawk of chords and playful schism, the frenetic pace of Mr. PC, the coolest round midnight will ever be. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7267.338s">Coltrane's</a>  notes are genius refined, like gold in a pan or gemstones mined, the sparkling glow of a hopeful dream, hot black coffee with a hint of cream. <a href="https://youtu.be/NItYxDxziGM&t=7280.682s">Coltrane's</a>  notes are Naima's reprieve, like madness that brings a man to his knees, or sadness that comes when lovers part. <a
