00:01:50,913 --> 00:02:13,012
Hey Jonathan, how do we help out people who are trying to donate money? Huh? How do we help out people who are trying to donate money? Um, there's a jar inside actually. Yeah, or if it's easier you can go to the vendor. Yeah, no, that's fine. Yeah, so there's a jar, there's a jar for cash donation inside. Oh, okay, thanks. Yeah.

3
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:35,998
We'll probably be another five minutes or so. You've got a little bit of time. Do you want a snack, Dad? What do we have for snacks? Pretzels, chips, popcorn.

4
00:02:40,759 --> 00:03:03,490
All right. So if we do have to do it.

5
00:03:07,705 --> 00:03:31,049
Okay.

6
00:04:04,718 --> 00:04:09,002
The cool kids hang out on the ramp there. I'm picking up.

7
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:41,732
It looks like everything's fine until it starts. It's like when you're playing short stuff and the pitcher hasn't pitched yet, hasn't thrown anything yet. The first note, all power goes out.

8
00:04:43,336 --> 00:04:54,411
The band swung so hard, it ruined the entire concert. The jam was too smooth, so they went personal again.

9
00:04:56,578 --> 00:05:16,476
Blue is the jazz club.

10
00:05:16,476 --> 00:05:41,613
When I first started, I used to get gel.

11
00:05:48,012 --> 00:06:16,049
Here, here. You press a color, you know. It's like, even a songwriter can do it. Honestly, yeah, like the mic, it's kind of like, it's fine, because it's like roughly where, in between the keys and the drums. At the end of the day, like I said, like, the sound stuff, more concert sound.

12
00:06:22,073 --> 00:06:52,005
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Terry Cotter. I manage elder services here at the West Medford Community Center. I'm also the Poet Laureate of Medford, Massachusetts.

13
00:06:54,309 --> 00:07:06,169
I won't get into the whole story because we'll talk again when we come up to play, but I want to introduce you to a friend of mine, a kindred spirit, a guy who's

14
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:34,138
musical abilities I appreciate so much and someone who has, you know, kind of taught me some things about how we can collaborate and cooperate and get together and do things that are meaningful without looking at each other suspiciously or as if we have ulterior motives or anything like that. So the convener, one of the original conveners of the Medford Jazz Festival,

15
00:07:34,138 --> 00:07:40,862
And we're hosting it for the first time outside. My friend, Jonathan Fagan.

16
00:07:44,497 --> 00:08:13,968
Thank you so much, Terry. It's always a blast to get introduced by a poet laureate. I don't know how many of you have had that experience. Maybe not very many. But anyways, yes. My name is Jonathan Fagan. I'm the producer of the Medford Jazz Festival, which has actually been going on for quite some time. I joke with my friends that it started in Peter Cobb's laundromat about four years ago. It was a place called Wash Vault Lab. It's on Boston Avenue in Medford. That was my first collaboration with, here, let me just,

17
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:18,080
get this out of the way.

18
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:48,131
Medford Arts Council, and then that in turn led us to collaborate with Arts Alive Foundation, who's one of our primary sponsors this year. We launched a Patreon page three years ago, and of course, we were planning on doing the first festival in 2020, but well, 2020 was an interesting year for many reasons. So we streamed the whole thing from Bopstop Studios near Medford Center. Thank you so much to George Tresk and all of our tech people that helped us with that, including Nathan Montgomery, who's

19
00:08:48,131 --> 00:09:16,049
running cameras tonight. Yes, please. And so this is, you know, this has been going on for some time, but it's so exciting to finally have a live event. So I really appreciate all of you coming and braving the cold weather to, you know, just really have a live audience tonight. And thank you also to those on the stream, which has been put together generously by Medford Community Media over there with Kevin Harrington.

20
00:09:20,896 --> 00:09:32,432
Oh, she's okay. Thank you also to my father Avi Fagan for providing the sound. I've been joking with people earlier today that I'm kind of bringing him out of retirement here. Yeah.

21
00:09:33,268 --> 00:10:00,060
Which, that's the plus of having your dad be a sound engineer, is you can, yes, you have the secret weapon. Really. So, a couple of other people to thank. Of course, Terry Carter, for putting together this partnership with the West Medford Community Center. It's been amazing to just have his support at pretty much every juncture of this. And to the executive director, Lisa, who I believe will be...

22
00:10:00,418 --> 00:10:23,456
Oh, she's on the run. Okay. Busy person. Executive director. And finally to our sponsors themselves. Starting with the people that are in our Patreon subscription who pay a couple dollars each month and they really do help raise money for events like this and also our monthly jam sessions which we've been doing quite a few of actually over the past year. We've had

23
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:47,278
between five and six over the past year. It's a great opportunity for a lot of adult students to get to play with professionals and for local musicians to network. There is so much talent here in the Medford area. It's still surprising to me every single month that we do it and someone shows up and great players. Thank you also to the Arts Alive Foundation, which is run by Mae Marbeck.

24
00:10:47,910 --> 00:11:12,090
which has donated quite a bit to help make this possible and expand this into a two-day festival, to the Medford Arts Council for their continued support, to CACHE, which is a really wonderful organization here in Medford that connects a lot of artistic people to each other, and to the Mystic River Watershed Association, which really stepped in and also made this possible.

25
00:11:14,155 --> 00:11:28,933
So I hope I'm not forgetting anybody. I don't think I am. We have had a lot of support this year, which is amazing. Last, just a couple housekeeping things. Bathrooms are inside, obviously, along with a donation.

26
00:11:29,053 --> 00:11:51,732
A donation jar if you feel moved by what you see and hear today. Please consider donating to us. Really everything does matter. I know it's a cliche, but a couple dollars at a time is how we've gotten to where we are. There are CDs for sale and books for sale inside by both Terry and I. And there are snacks available for purchase for just a couple dollars each.

27
00:11:51,732 --> 00:12:17,210
And I believe there will be some hot chocolate and coffee out there later. So without further ado, I will introduce this first group, which is actually an ensemble of adult students that I've had the pleasure of working with over the past couple years over at Morningside Music Studio in Arlington, calling this the Beacon Blue Jazz Quintet. So why don't you guys come on up and we'll get started.

28
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:36,715

Great, thanks. Oh. Great, thanks. Should we put my mic on?

36
00:18:00,265 --> 00:18:29,224
Oh, great. There we go. Thank you so much. That was a Grant Green composition called Flood in Franklin Park. Let me just take a second to introduce this band. So we have Jeff Hopwood on the trumpet over there. Steven Weber on the saxophone. David Sands on the bass. Bill Kuklinski on guitar. And Mike Chen is all the way over there, hidden a little bit by the lights, but holding it down on drums.

37
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:54,821
And I'm still Jonathan Fagan, and I play piano. We're going to do one of my favorite things to do as both an educator and just as an all-around musician is to have my students write things. And I feel like our trumpet player, Jeff, has definitely taken up that challenge to a different level this year. And so he calls this one One Beer Blues.

38
00:18:54,821 --> 00:19:18,268
Because as he explained it to me, when you have one beer, you're not feeling so great. It's only when you get past that point that things tend to improve. Is that a correct paraphrase? OK, yeah, there we go. So this is the, I mean, well, we'll see where it goes. Maybe it'll evolve into two-beer territory, but we'll see. So the one-beer blues, here we go.

All right, The One Beer Blues by Jeff Hopwood. We're going to play one of mine now. When I can, I love giving my groups some of my compositions just to think about. This one is called The Dreamcatcher. It was written right after, well, a couple days after I saw Kenny Garrett. It's a great alto saxophone player who's inspired me in a number of ways. So it has some hints of Kenny Garrett in it, but probably a number of other things, too.

This next one actually was brought in by our guitar player, Bill Kuklinski. You were there, too. I was there, too. That is true. I was going to say, Bill and I a couple of years ago went on one of Morningside Music Studios

55
00:32:42,688 --> 00:32:55,657
basically music tours and we ended up in Venice with an amazing vocalist named Sheila Jordan but along the way we also met a bass player named Alvise Seiji who wrote this tune and

Well, Bill was the one that still had the music, somehow. Because he liked the song, and he remembers to keep things on, like me, sometimes. So we're going to play it for you. This one's called African Colors. And then after that, we're going to do a Hoagy Carmichael ballad, which is one of my favorites. That one's called The Nearness of You.

01:02:15,162 --> 01:02:35,828
But the back is just coming slightly unglued. And it's like, you know, it's not getting any worse, but that's the kind of thing they could like, you know, south quickly. So I'd rather just get it taken care of. You know, luckily I only have one upright piece.

Let me check with Jonathan. That one might be available. The one sitting downstairs there. Hey, Jonathan. Jonathan, Linda needs a music stand. Another music stand? Yeah. Yeah, we got this one over here. That's perfect. Do it. Do it. Do it.

116
01:04:22,961 --> 01:04:48,746

118
01:05:14,787 --> 01:05:35,742
I should be able to hear him beside me, right? No, he's talking and then I'm just singing with him. Yeah, we're in the same time. Yeah, a little background. We'll be singing a few lines together. Yeah, it'll be a vibe.

I've been painting my apartment all day, man. My hand is like... I didn't realize how tired my hand was cramping up earlier.

127
01:10:04,002 --> 01:10:32,961
We won't protect it anymore. That's how you know the intermission is over. You don't want to miss this.

128
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:53,439
So

129
01:10:53,933 --> 01:11:20,401
Thanks for hanging in with us. We're back here trying to talk about being a little bit chilly, but it's cold. I mean, it's cold. But it's been a warm night, and the Beacon Blues Band was real nice. They got us started out well, and we really appreciate that. I want to just remember to thank our sponsors once again.

130
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:48,695
the host and the provider of this lovely venue, the West Medford Community Center Incorporated, my home. I also want to thank the Arts Alive Medford Foundation, the Mystic River Watershed Association, Cache Medford Arts Council, and a special thank you to Kevin Harrington,

131
01:11:48,695 --> 01:12:12,807
from Method Community Media and Kyle Douglas who is here working and Kat Darnell who all came over to make sure that we could do a live stream and a YouTube. So for those of you that are out there watching this on your computers, your laptops, your television on 3 or 47, we appreciate, we appreciate you being with us.

132
01:12:12,807 --> 01:12:37,227
As Jonathan said earlier, Medford Jazz Festival also has a Patreon account, so if you want to contribute to Patreon, we have information about that inside. When we finish up, Jonathan and I both have some product, as they call it, in the trade. He has some CDs. I have some of my fifth book. I'm working on my sixth now.

133
01:12:38,660 --> 01:13:00,572
Jonathan and I basically met at the intersection of jazz and social justice. So that's what we call this music. Music is, to a great extent, that intersection where jazz, which has always been a progressive thing in the United States, meets social justice, which is really becoming a

134
01:13:00,572 --> 01:13:14,616
a thing all over again. So we're happy to be working together under any circumstances, but we think it's necessary for us to work together under these particular circumstances.

135
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:31,271
So by his definition and in my agreement, this is the Ally Project. And I want to introduce the players. Over here on the traps, on the drums, John Dalton.

136
01:13:32,756 --> 01:14:00,759
And John's got like six, seven different groups that he plays with, right? He's got a great, great group called Spheres of Influence. Spheres of Influence, okay? S-P-H-E-R-E-S, Spheres of Influence. And they do some real, real good edgy stuff. We got my man Greg Turow on what I call the big sexy, okay?

137
01:14:01,869 --> 01:14:17,363
That stand up bass with the hourglass figure. It's real cool. And then my friend, and really Jonathan found me. I think he had seen something that I did maybe at Martin Luther King. Was it Martin Luther King Day?

138
01:14:17,363 --> 01:14:40,538
And he sought me out, and we just started talking about how we could again integrate this theme of jazz, him as a musician, a composer, an arranger, a teacher, a man of many talents, and me as a humble poet. And before you know it, this thing just started to evolve. So a little over a month ago,

139
01:14:40,708 --> 01:15:00,725
We were in the studio recording our first CD. And we brought together this group, but also a very talented woman, who you'll hear some from a little bit later. Her name is Linda. Call her Lady Morose. And I found her.

140
01:15:00,725 --> 01:15:21,476
based on another friend who's also a musician and a poet named Max Heinig. And Max teaches at Medford High School and she was one of his students and when he recorded his recent CD, which I actually contributed a song to, Linda was his singer. And I heard her at the Medford Public Library and I was done.

141
01:15:21,476 --> 01:15:38,865
I was completely done. I said, you know, when Jonathan and I were talking, we said, well, you know, maybe we could get a singer to add some layers, a little bit of subtext to this thing. And I said, I got just the person. Hence, Linda will be singing with us in a little while. So we're going to get to it.

142
01:15:38,865 --> 01:15:57,568
This first piece really defines the relationship of this community, West Medford, with greater Medford. And it's a historical but somewhat fragmented relationship. And again, it began

143
01:15:57,568 --> 01:16:25,435
probably 15, 20 years after the Civil War, and has evolved to a very different West Medford than the West Medford that I grew up with, but that's another story for another poem. This piece is called Hired by the Mystic. They gave my people the lowlands, and not much of it. Just a few streets high by the river.

144
01:16:25,794 --> 01:16:51,937
Banks turned a blind eye behind the red lines, and it wasn't about the money. Class was an irresistible force. Race was an immovable object. Perhaps it wasn't a written rule, but white folks knew the legal tool to keep us in our place in this mystic valley space, where slaves and rum and chips had built some mansions, made some millionaires, and hid some old money.

145
01:16:53,422 --> 01:17:22,568
So it was hard by the mystic we went. Muddy and a bit turned down. The only place where one could be brown in this ancient Middlesex County town. But we named it. We claimed it. We made it our own. Even in the heat of summer when the shores were pipes and the soil was rank with the decay of aquatic alchemy, we were one with the river. We followed its flow to the lakes and the sandy beachfront.

146
01:17:26,101 --> 01:17:50,333
Like our own Jordan Shore, we baptized and blessed our brothers and sisters in Christ. We caught the little fishes to go with our loaves of bread and became the teaming multitude who our Lord Jesus fed, hired by the mission. We became community. We commanded unity. We embraced the village and raised up our children in the way they should go.

147
01:17:51,886 --> 01:18:20,606
As the river ebbs and flows, the tide will turn and our fortune grows. A few more streets become our home. Houses on Sharon join Kin on Jerome. From Duggar Park to the railroad tracks, the landed folks make more room for blacks. The color line recedes a bit. Church and school and center sit. The Ville becomes the heart of it, hard by the mystic shore.

148
01:18:33,814 --> 01:18:40,691
Now the worm has surely turned, and folks who left have surely learned things couldn't stay the same.

149
01:18:41,732 --> 01:19:09,241
The muddy mystic most days is clean. The banks are freshly cut and green. Faces once distinctly brown are not the only ones in town. The streets that once were our confines must now embrace what gentry defined. Condominium culture, bedroom convenience, university sprawl, access, e-graph, access,

150
01:19:15,555 --> 01:19:42,039
Now those lowlands have become the highlights of a trending city and sometimes that success isn't pretty when it's at the expense of your black and brown and tan family. And yet, the river still turns and bends from where it begins to where it ends.

151
01:19:42,671 --> 01:20:11,886
the only place where one could be brown in this ancient Middlesex County town where we named it and claimed it and made it our own. Thank you. Thank you. So now that you have a bit of the history,

152
01:20:13,148 --> 01:20:33,456
I want to talk institutionally. And in West Medford, when I was growing up, there were three, maybe four institutions that were really, really important to us. Now you're sitting in the patio of one of them, West Medford Community Center. This is the second building on the site, but this organization goes back 1945-ish.

153
01:20:33,695 --> 01:20:43,831
Okay, when a group of men from West Medford determined that they needed a place to be somebody. So they actually carted up from

154
01:20:44,155 --> 01:21:08,831
temporary military installation in Charlestown, what's called a Quonset hut, or military barracks in pieces. They brought it to this site, they poured a foundation, and they built the original West Memphis Community Center. This is the second iteration of that building, and so this is one of the great institutions of the West Memphis Community Center, West Memphis Community.

155
01:21:09,224 --> 01:21:38,814
The other great institution was called Shiloh Baptist Church, and it's on the corner of Holton and Bower Streets. It's still there, it's still ministering to the needs of a predominantly African American congregation. And then the third institution was not as, not what you think it would be. It's not a school, it's not a university, it's not, let me just read the poem. The Little Store.

156
01:21:52,398 --> 01:22:11,647
It was a tiny red hovel on upper Jerome, a bit rundown and rough around the edges. And Mr. Henry seemed so old to us, even then, with a lot of whiskers, impatient and a little scary.

157
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:37,466
One would suspect that he didn't even like kids. But he really must have loved us. Or else, where did all that penny candy come from? He had all of it. No, no, seriously. We'd bust in there with a few nickels or a handful of pennies, all loud and unruly. He'd hush us up while he finished with grown folks' business.

158
01:22:37,978 --> 01:22:55,981
Then he'd be back like a black Willy Wonka up in that old shack. He'd peer over those old horn rimmed glasses and tell us he didn't have all day. Then he'd blow open one of those small brown craft paper bags and get to stuffing while we were oohing and aahing.

159
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:23,422
Muffin and Puffin. See, Mr. Henry had all the treats. All of our favorites. 100 great sweets. Root beer barrels and pixie sticks. Squirrel nut zippers and banana splits. Green mint juleps and button strips. Red licorice ropes and bottle nips. He had bazooka Joe bubble gum. And a tiny sucker called a dum-dum. Yaw breakers and Tootsie Rolls.

160
01:23:23,422 --> 01:23:37,483
Sugary love for little kids sold. Candy necklaces to wear and fight, and waxy red lips were such a sight. Fat gum cigars and kid cigarettes right beside the crunchy sticks.

161
01:23:39,872 --> 01:24:02,688
Hot fireballs and Mexican hats. Just the genuine Percy's kisses. All of the hits and none of the misses. Like kids' taffy squares and Necco wafers. Liquor made in Boston may be. Gold rocks, nuggets of gum in a bag.

162
01:24:23,643 --> 01:24:45,299
from cold January to chilly December. More kinds of candy than I can remember at the Mill storefront on Upper Jerome. I knew I had to write this poem. See, Mr. Henry had all of the treats, all of our favorites, a hundred great sweets.

163
01:24:53,780 --> 01:25:08,166
So now I have the distinct pleasure of welcoming to the stage our collaborator, our friend, a muse of sorts, Linda Lady Moreau.

164
01:25:14,258 --> 01:25:39,053
We're gonna do an old tune, a takeoff on an old tune by Nat Simon, popularized by the pianist Ahmed Jamal. That tune was called Poinciana, and this riff on Poinciana is called Reprise for Poinciana.

165
01:25:41,408 --> 01:26:00,213
Perfect a fantasy in black and tan. Between the Savoy ballroom and a Paris can-can. The kind of blue that doesn't get you down. It rather has you twirling round and round and round. Kind of blue, but not really.

166
01:26:01,357 --> 01:26:29,753
Like a conversation between Miles and Q in a smoke-filled corner, just those two talking about the music round midnight. Miles and that miraculous horn, all gravel-voicing, full of scorn, asking Q, what made you feel like doing stuff like that? Jazz finds justice in the majesty of the blues. Take five to wonder, and you'll know that this is true. Deep and delicious all over.

167
01:26:30,708 --> 01:26:50,879
Pondered passionately in pianissimo, keeping standard time. Duke's mood indigo, Joe Sample's rainbow seeker, Errol Garner's misty worship in the style of G. You know the melody, songs you just can't get out of your head. Kind of blue, but not really.

168
01:26:52,466 --> 01:27:03,643
just like the woman whose name you call as autumn leaves begin to fall. Or maybe like that melody by Ahmad Jamal.

169
01:27:04,241 --> 01:27:30,299
Po-en-ci-a-na. Last days of sun and sand and sea. You and your love and the music made three. A lyric so familiar, a song so free, so sweet. Ebony notes on an ivory sheet. New tear stains on every page. A bit of your heart in a crystal cage. Kind of blue, but not really.

170
01:27:31,852 --> 01:27:52,807
You'll remember her most round midnight. Poesiana, fragrant, fresh wind recollections, a song reprise. Summer breeze makes me feel fine. Oh, through the jazz winds of my mind.

171
01:27:56,476 --> 01:28:17,637
Miles in queue in that smoke-filled corner, talking about taking the A train, going up to Smalls Paradise. Sassy's going to be scatting, and Hawk's band is in town, doing jazz some real justice. Marvelous, majestic, and kind of blue, but not really.

172
01:28:18,456 --> 01:28:34,206
You'll remember her most round midnight. Po-en-ci-a-na. Pungent rose petal pictures, a song reprise. The first time ever I saw your face.

173
01:28:44,275 --> 01:29:11,510
fantasy perfected in cocoa and cream, Harlem nights in a Moulin Rouge daydream, the kind of blue that fills your soul, engulfs your spirit, and makes you whole. My Poinciana, I'll remember you most round midnight, frail fragments of love's fulfillment, kind of blue, but not really.

174
01:29:12,227 --> 01:29:39,411
Your song, reprise. ♪ Till you come back to me ♪ ♪ That's what I'm gonna do ♪ Poinciana, my Poinciana. Linda Morales. John Dalton on the drums.

175
01:29:41,032 --> 01:29:58,370
Rafe Toro on the stand up, Jonathan Fagan on the keys, and I'm Terry Cotter. So, Linda, you just know, right? All right. So.

176
01:29:58,951 --> 01:30:17,961
I mean, at the intersection of jazz and social justice, there's some real nice music, but there's also some dangerous stuff that's taking place, some dangerous stuff that we have to take into account and play about. So we're gonna play a piece called Microaggressions.

177
01:30:31,015 --> 01:30:51,698
You'll never know what this feels like. 24-7, 365, 366 in the leap year, and it's definitely a black thing. Why? I'm so glad you asked. You call the police on us like you're calling a building manager to come unclog your toilet. Why? Because you can.

178
01:30:52,363 --> 01:31:22,193
The skin you're in says, I win. We can't ever be too loud. We can't ever be too educated. We can't ever be too proud. We can't ever be too dedicated. Nobody follows you around in Nordstrom just because. Nobody asks you for your ID on campus just because. Nobody sprints and cuffs you without provocation just because, just because of the skin you're in.

179
01:31:23,985 --> 01:31:44,224
You can never be too loud. You can never be too educated. You can never be too proud. You can never be too dedicated. We live with this every day. We deal with this every day. We're mindful of this every day. We're stressed by this every day.

180
01:31:45,964 --> 01:32:13,268
never walked a mile in my shoes. You can't feel how much these shoes pinch my toes. You can't feel the tightness and discomfort in every step I have to take in a whitewashed world. But why? Why does it take 26 bullets to subdue a black boy with his back turned and no weapon save a cell phone?

181
01:32:14,616 --> 01:32:34,718
Why do major corporations like Unilever, H&M, and Heineken perpetuate racial stereotypes with tone-deaf advertising on the regular? Why does the sitting potent think it's okay to call the country where my people came from, home?

182
01:32:37,295 --> 01:32:51,800
Why does a black child in grade school get put out of class for the same type of force play, or youthful obstinance, or mild assertiveness that gets his white classmate a simple, Johnny, behave yourself.

183
01:33:07,739 --> 01:33:34,974
You don't know how it feels to see the smiling faces of rednecks and Klansmen, Klanswomen and Klanskids standing hundreds deep in a field where the charred body of a black boy is dangling from a noose on the bow of an ancient oak tree. Perhaps the Jew does when he sees the image of naked bodies piled in the rigor of death at Auschwitz or Dachau.

184
01:33:35,691 --> 01:34:02,568
Perhaps the native Apache or Cherokee does when she sees the grainy illustrations of the forced death marches of her ancestors across the Trail of Tears. Perhaps the Japanese immigrant does when he remembers the barbed wire perimeters and horse stables converted to living quarters for the forced internment of potential enemy agents. But you,

185
01:34:03,285 --> 01:34:32,568
heir to Anglo-Euro spoils of colonial conquest and systemic privilege do not have radar for this, do not have a frame of reference for this, do not have an appreciation of this. You do not have the emotional intelligence for these little hurts of the heart, bee stings to the brain, sucker punches to the soul, spilled milk of the spirit. You say,

186
01:34:33,456 --> 01:34:55,896
It's nothing we think you should cry over, even as you watch us sometimes die over. These microaggressions, these race-fueled transgressions, this constant procession of slings and arrows that seldom miss the target when the bullseye is black like me.

187
01:35:06,408 --> 01:35:28,148
So people ask sometimes, why are you so angry? And I try to tell them I'm a loving and compassionate person. I'm a man of faith. I'm not angry. I'm resolute. I think it's important that we tell the truth and shame the devil. I think it's important that

188
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:53,080
We talk about the things that are issues between us because if we can't bridge the gulfs, and there are many between us, we're in for a long and bumpy ride. But the neighborhood that I grew up in, West Medford, has changed an awful lot. It was at one time a very nuclear African-American neighborhood that

189
01:35:53,763 --> 01:36:18,490
took up about eight or 10 streets, right around where we are now. But things are changing. Part of the change is actually going up. I don't know if you can see it right beside us. It's a multi-unit dwelling in front of a house that, in all honesty, we used to own, but that's another story for another day. But I wanna play, we wanna play a little tune for you called Gentrified.

190
01:36:25,981 --> 01:36:30,111
you

191
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:56,118
They talk about renovating, reimagining, and rehabilitating. They rave about new visions, new horizons, and new perspectives. They revel in bistros, boutiques, and boulangeries. They fairly skip to the subway stations. They bike on the painted pathways. They Uber and Lyft religiously. Everything's on trend and on point and au pair.

192
01:36:57,039 --> 01:37:26,305
They've codified the way they speak about what used to be urban blight, eyesores, drug dens, crack houses, tenements, and slums, the ghetto. They've modified the way they speak about what we now see, makeovers, investment properties, B&Bs, brownstones, townhouses, condos, and co-ops. Everything's vintage, bohemian, artsy, and retro, with creative green spaces and lofted open places.

193
01:37:28,183 --> 01:37:41,920
Speculators bought lower than low, patiently waiting for the change, waiting for the junkies to move on, waiting for the squatters to give up, waiting for the blacks and the browns and the tans to fade.

194
01:37:43,985 --> 01:38:06,169
They waited for the graffiti to erode. They waited for the chain link to corrode. They waited for the family to implode. They waited for the prices to explode. They waited, and they calculated. They waited as folks capitulated. They waited as folks evacuated. They waited as folks migrated.

195
01:38:10,947 --> 01:38:23,490
Then the realtors came and dispelled white folks' fears. The architects came and re-engineered. The designers came and changed the veneers. The builders came and the new folk cheered.

196
01:38:23,968 --> 01:38:48,780
Now they've moved closer to work in the city, to quartz countertops that made kitchens pretty, to chowder schools, nannies, and drivers, and bite frames made with carbon fibers, to Starbucks lattes and artisanal breads, and articulated sleep number beds, to million dollar urban show places, and fewer and fewer black and brown faces.

197
01:38:50,589 --> 01:39:18,336
They showed us their heels when they took the white flight. Then they crept back in in the dead of night. With fat bank accounts, they were IPO wealthy. Their move to this place was measured and stealthy. All of the potholes now smoothly paved over. Brown folks got schooled like a Curry crossover. White folks doing a long-term sleepover. Exclusive, obtrusive, extreme home makeover.

198
01:39:19,189 --> 01:39:38,712
full of sugar, they took all the clover. Changing the context of neighborhood with subway tile and exotic wood. Harlem, Detroit, and Chicago's South Side. Boston's South End surely gentrified. Empty the church.

199
01:39:39,445 --> 01:39:54,497
Emptied the steeple, now it's a spot for the chai-drinking people. Took down the poles and the basketball hoops, now it's a park for the dog-walking troops. No more rec and community center, but a new parking lot for the monthly renters.

200
01:39:59,155 --> 01:40:13,473
Some folks hang on, but the die is cast. The fire consumes and the torch is passed. Invisible lines are drawn again, and the folks can't buy when the banks won't lend.

201
01:40:13,677 --> 01:40:36,084
Some folks keep their roots in the ground, but the waiting game is deep and profound. They tour the streets noting history, yet what they want is no mystery. Holland, Detroit, and Chicago's South Side, a reoccupation is being applied to model cities that trickle down, no longer suited to black and brown.

202
01:40:37,022 --> 01:40:48,217
The urban sprawl that used to be the only homes that we got to see is now the place for growing infusion, is now the space that the gentry is choosing.

203
01:41:10,060 --> 01:41:38,575
low-rise projects slowly yield to equity building leases sealed to folks who came from far afield who won the fight when the poor folk appealed to lawyers and doctors and high-tech heroes with Trust Fund One and Hedge Fund Zero. No preserving community, no real thought of legacy, a small flag here, a street sign there, nothing that bronzes the atmosphere.

204
01:41:39,241 --> 01:41:54,667
Oakland, Brooklyn, and New Orleans, all made targets by whites with means. Even in venerable chocolate cities, the news in the district inspires some pity.

205
01:42:12,227 --> 01:42:26,954
killing the concept of neighborhood in ways they've never understood. And now we witness the slow, painful slide as the village we built becomes gentrified.

206
01:42:38,063 --> 01:43:03,831
My mother used to say, life is hard, but fair. You had a good home, but you didn't stay there. So I want to bring back our friend, our muse, Linda Moreau, and she's going to join me for a tune we call Legacy. How you folks holding up?

207
01:43:04,838 --> 01:43:29,019
Good, good, good. You enjoying yourselves? Yes. All right, all right. When we do this the next time, we've got to definitely make sure that we do it in warmer weather. And the forecast tomorrow suggests rain, suggested very dramatically. So we are assuming that we will be inside tomorrow as opposed to outside.

208
01:43:29,770 --> 01:43:40,230
So hopefully if you come back tomorrow, you won't have to suffer through the chill. You good to go?

209
01:44:04,053 --> 01:44:33,814
It's not for you to tell your own story. That is the burden of your children. They must shoulder this yoke with love and loyalty. And yet, you have not gathered them up and bid them sit before the campfires of their elders.

210
01:44:34,531 --> 01:45:01,578
You have not seasoned their meals with the spice of their identity and the savor of their name. How will they learn to walk the walk and talk the talk? How will they learn to tell your story even as they live out their own? Sons and daughters and heirs, if you didn't smell the burning ash or feel the warmth of the flame on your neck, you don't know.

211
01:45:02,449 --> 01:45:28,968
If you didn't revel in the growl of the griot's earthly reply or the trill of the mockingbird's cry, you don't know. If mama was too tired and daddy too long gone to carry the wood, light the spark, and stoke the flames, you don't know. And until the lion cub knows how to tell the pride story, the hunters will always tell them first.

212
01:45:40,794 --> 01:45:57,602
The good book says, train up the child in the way they should go. Will we let them depart from the community of faith and the city on a hill without the master's touch, without the oil of his anointing and his full measure of grace?

213
01:45:58,916 --> 01:46:14,053
Will we not show them Anansi's clever ways, Popo and Fafina's journey, Muparo's beautiful daughters, the people who could fly, the wonders of Wakanda, and Song Kololo's news hacky.

214
01:46:15,230 --> 01:46:31,442
The prophet says he will encourage fathers and their children to return. But how will they know the way home if no map charts the seas, measures the roads, cites the peaks and valleys, and names each forest despite the thickening stream?

215
01:46:33,046 --> 01:47:00,128
Will the burden of the elder stories be too heavy for the children? Will they care to carry? Will they dare to tarry? Will they linger at the foot of the griot? Will they hunger for the wisdom of the sage? We must put them on the page, where hard work earns the man his wage, where power is measured by God's own gauge, where miracles scarf at the wand of a maid.

216
01:47:02,295 --> 01:47:30,077
We must share with them the truth that is loyal and fierce like Naomi and Ruth, that doesn't wait for the confessional boot, that has the bite of the panther's tooth. This is a gift of legacy, where a glorious past sets the captives free, and a candle's light beckons liberty.

217
01:47:30,299 --> 01:48:00,094
sons and daughters and heir. I bid you sit before the campfires of your elders, hear their stories, gather up their stones, and build up your strength. They will show you Anansi's club away, Popo and Fafina's journey, Mufaro's beautiful daughters, the people who could fly, the wonders of Wakanda, and Sangololo's Tutaki.

218
01:48:02,125 --> 01:48:16,357
Soon you will be the herald. Write these things down on the tablets of your spirit. Let them put a running in your feet. With each quickening step,

219
01:48:16,578 --> 01:48:32,654
You repel the arrows of the hunter with the shield of abiding faith. You capture the flags of your enemies and gather up their spoils. You remain the lions of your pride and your children, your tales will always be your children's friends.

220
01:48:42,585 --> 01:49:06,698
You will never abandon the community of faith, though you build a thousand cities on a hill, drawing wondrous strength from the master's touch, as the oil of his anointing fills your clay jars with his grace. Linda Morales.

221
01:49:16,015 --> 01:49:39,121
So you're in what has been traditionally called The Ville, probably short for village, but I'm not 100% sure of that. And it's also called The Hood, short for The Neighborhood. So we're gonna do a piece called Neighborhood.

222
01:50:03,063 --> 01:50:27,193
Neighborhood is a place where mothers buy extra food for kids that aren't even their own, on the premise that they will eventually show up hungry. Neighborhood is grandmas and grandpas that raise their children's children long after they've raised their own, lovingly, carefully, happily, long after they've raised their own.

223
01:50:27,995 --> 01:50:46,613
Neighborhood is that corner bodega where the nice Spanish man always gave you 10 cents worth of penny candy when all you ever had was a nickel. Neighborhood is the homeowner that doesn't look down his nose at the frazzled rental with the Section 8 and a few kids without a daddy.

224
01:50:47,739 --> 01:51:07,551
Neighborhood is the block party that everyone comes to. And nobody calls the cops. No drugs, no guns, no drama. Cooling the gang, earth, wind, and fire, Rick James, Tina Marie, and Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan.

225
01:51:08,541 --> 01:51:21,954
Neighborhood knows everybody's name but isn't collecting big data on anyone. Keeps tabs on strangers but doesn't discriminate based on color or caste or custom.

226
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:47,551
Neighborhood keeps pies and cookies ready to welcome newcomers, and always has something to invite folk to, and always has something good to eat when you get there. Neighborhood loves all of its children, watches out for all of the babies, disciplines fairly, drops dimes carefully, daps up consistently, and marches for justice dutifully.

227
01:51:48,677 --> 01:52:13,729
Neighborhood cares for its sick with homemade chicken soup, ginger tea, flowers, cards, and pastoral visits. Never lets you feel lonely, never leaves you alone. Neighborhood laments the loss of its kings and queens reverently, even while it celebrates their lives jubilantly and recollects their ways permanently.

228
01:52:14,770 --> 01:52:38,575
Neighborhood has well-worn welcome mats and four-way stop signs, a community gathering place as the hub of the wheels, and nicknames like The Port, The Coast, and The Ville. Neighborhood says yes more than it says no, chooses love over hate, never cries when it could laugh, and never laughs when it should cry.

229
01:52:39,889 --> 01:53:05,060
Neighborhood understands the importance of respect, covers everyone with an umbrella, shovels snow for its elders, pronounces your name right, and picks up the poop left by its dog. Small, medium, and large. And no matter where you go, neighborhood is always the place you call home.

230
01:53:15,572 --> 01:53:36,766
Once again, John Dalton on drums, Greg Toro on bass, Jonathan Fagan on the keys. So again, that intersection of jazz and social justice, I'm gonna take it back a little bit and forward at the same time with a piece we call Riding Up Front.

231
01:53:57,261 --> 01:54:20,930
can't do it don't even ask me black it's a bus but i ain't riding in the back young bloods ain't got no idea of how long we had to ride in the red in the lazy south american apothecary the law of the land was stratified seats up front unoccupied yet a pregnant brown girl can sit and ride

232
01:54:20,930 --> 01:54:31,903
Elders, toddlers, just didn't matter. And don't let them hear no race talk or chatter. Redneck drivers would put us out. But y'all don't know what I'm talking about.

233
01:54:32,551 --> 01:54:58,473
Then along came courageous Rosa Parks, tired and weary, but full of sparks. Took a seat in the first few rows, seeking not chaos, but simple repose. Think them whites heard what she was saying? Hell no, and them crackers for sure wasn't playing. She held up Miss Rosa without dignity, commending her acts to our history.

234
01:55:00,845 --> 01:55:23,712
You don't have no gratitude, no pride in self, just attitude. You make your way to the back of the bus. You drink and smoke and holler and cuss. You say it's your prerogative. You say it's just the way you live. You just don't get it. You just don't care. So cavalier, so unaware.

235
01:55:25,435 --> 01:55:53,712
But I can't do it. Don't even ask me, black. It's a bust. But I ain't riding in the back. Three seats up front. That's for me. I'm digging Miss Rose's legacy. Here it is. All right.

236
01:55:54,445 --> 01:56:21,766
We are getting to the good part. So as I said earlier, in the jazz canon, there are these signature tunes that if you know jazz, you can be anywhere and hear three or four notes and you can name that tune. This is one of those tunes written, composed, and played by the legendary John Coltrane.

237
01:56:22,654 --> 01:56:45,384
was called Naima. Our take on it is called Reprise for Naima. He would blow this note in the midnight air. Aloft in the ether, it floats out there. Staccato cadence sets a mood of bluesy lyrical attitude.

238
01:56:45,691 --> 01:57:05,282
Improvisational mystery like Monk's piano epistrophe, or Miles' tone poem in a silent way, and Flanagan's peace at the end of the day. Syncopated and sharp, bright tone, a countdown to stardust, a twilight zone, like a blue train running against the night, setting the pace then out of sight.

239
01:57:06,015 --> 01:57:33,695
With Hartman crooning of bags-on vibes. Trios, duets, quartets, and tribes. The blues, the ballads, the avant-garde. Incredibly gorgeous, impossibly hard. Giant steps move us miles ahead. Cooking up bop for Harlem street cred. Melodies hand to the harmony wed. Pianos lullaby fresh in the bed. Rhythm rocks with a drum of lead. Rhythm rolls with a bass man's fed. Rhythm burlesque.

240
01:57:35,623 --> 01:58:01,152
them heard what the master said. How could he make the bitter taste sweeter? How could a tortured mind delete her? How could the mellowed scotch be neater? How could the smoke from each cigarette create blue notes that cast a net, create blue beads of cascading sweat, create blue haze that compounds regret, create blue nights that we can't forget?

241
01:58:02,329 --> 01:58:27,790
Coltrane's notes are a crystal scale, a velvet scream in the urban travail, the heavenly riff of a love supreme, the pungent whip of his lover's theme. Coltrane's knots are a cozy romance, the breezy bounce of a bop and a dance, the languid lilt of stray's lush life, the cadence cut by the artist's knife.

242
01:58:28,217 --> 01:58:56,391
Coltrane's notes are a standard refine, like gold in a pan or gemstones mine, the sparkling glow of a hopeful dream, hot black coffee with a hint of cream. Coltrane's notes are Naima's reprise, like madness that brings a man to his knees, or sadness that comes when lovers part, the gladness removed from the balladeer's heart.

243
01:58:59,343 --> 01:59:20,043
A tight arrangement cuts the gloom. The melody sends that love's in bloom. The harmony spirit engulfs the room. The bride says yes to her lyrical broom. The groove and the beat then jumps the broom. The kick drum resounds with a sonic boom. As genius is birthed in a soul-filled room.

244
01:59:27,739 --> 01:59:49,497
Musical mythology mocks a twisted path the hero walks. With sealed and sword the hero stalks. The tempest shakes her twisted locks. Medusa snakes his vision shocks. Holds up the mirror to stony blocks. The harp and the horn melt icy rocks. Serpents retreat and symphony talks. Love's door opens as lyric.

245
01:59:55,435 --> 01:59:58,353
Okay.

246
02:00:44,753 --> 02:01:06,442
Coltrane's notes are a rollercoaster, a hallelujah and a paternoster, the glorious jolt of the maestro's hand, the saxophone titan is in command. Coltrane's notes are a crazy rhythm, the squawk of chords and playful schism, the frenetic pace of Mr. PC, the coolest round midnight will ever be.

247
02:01:07,278 --> 02:01:36,647
Coltrane's notes are genius refined, like gold in a pan or gemstones mined, the sparkling glow of a hopeful dream, hot black coffee with a hint of cream. Coltrane's notes are Naima's reprieve, like madness that brings a man to his knees, or sadness that comes when lovers part. Then, gladness revived by the balladeer's heart.

248
02:01:45,316 --> 02:02:08,029
Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. See, these cats can play. So that's, you know, that's how that goes. All right. So we're going to bring Linda back up. We're going to do a piece called Kitchen Table Poem. Okay. All righty.

249
02:02:14,889 --> 02:02:43,473
All right. Good? Bye-bye. Nobody ever wants to leave. They're like the blueberry stains on mama's apron, settled and satisfied. Good food has been eaten. Fresh corn and collard greens, fried chicken and potato salad, bellies are fat and full. This is that room.

250
02:02:46,766 --> 02:03:04,548
Are you serious right now? It's real talk. We're real people. Family. You know what I'm saying? We're family. You can smell the love long before the doors open. You know there's going to be pecan pie and the sweet tea will be ice cold.

251
02:03:05,708 --> 02:03:29,019
Southern folk will slip out of their northerness. Accents will thicken and the country shade will feel closer than the city sun. And they'll stay at that table long after the crumbs are cleared. The dishes will be all washed. The food will be put away or packed in Tupperware and Ziploc bags. Everyone will have a doggie bag and a story to tell.

252
02:03:29,343 --> 02:03:49,497
The men will be playing bids, slapping down some dominoes, sipping on a little something something, and talking big trash. The smiles will be broad and the laughter will be contagious. The women will be fanning and fussing.

253
02:03:50,111 --> 02:04:19,309
That ain't the dress for her, okay? That ain't no Sunday saved outfit. That ain't for Saturday night sinning. You know I'm right. Girl, you know I'm right. Nobody ever wants to leave. They're like black Jesus's eyes on that old print. Loving and insistent. Soul food has been shared. My Jean prayed down heaven and the babies sang their song. Everyone's tickled and tranquil.

254
02:04:21,476 --> 02:04:45,094
This is that room. I really miss pap. Mom's holding her own. And baby boy's cancer's in remission. And when you coming back to church, it's real talk. We're real people. Family. You know what I'm saying? We're family. Family.

255
02:04:54,923 --> 02:05:17,773
You better do that. Linda Morose, thank you so much. Okay, so we're gonna finish up with a piece called Beloved Country. And I always say this, you know, to preface this, if you're not, you know, native, native, native, native,

256
02:05:18,422 --> 02:05:34,428
Um, then you and your ancestors or your ancestors came here from someplace else, right? So this is about the folks who came from someplace else and who just want to be in with the in crowd. It's called Beloved Country.

257
02:06:03,899 --> 02:06:25,282
I can love this country, too. I didn't have to be born on these bonding shores. I didn't have to be a son of the Pentacook or Quinnipiac or Mohican. I didn't have to have a pilgrim pedigree or be a Connecticut Yankee from King Arthur's Court. I can be the Dahomian, the Pole, or the child of Caribbean suns in Amazon shade.

258
02:06:25,759 --> 02:06:42,159
I can love this country too. My green card was a welcome ticket to a new life in a new land. My passport was stamped with new hopes and new dreams. My suitcases were packed full of new aspirations and some apprehensions too.

259
02:06:42,551 --> 02:07:03,200
Perhaps I didn't see the harbor sign that said, give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuge of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me. I lift my lamp beside the golden door. Perhaps I didn't see the gleaming city on a hill that couldn't be hid, and my soul responded.

260
02:07:04,462 --> 02:07:26,630
I can love this country, too. I can love its rocky mountains and its rolling meadows. I can love its gospel songs and its crazy rhythms. I can love its asphalt highways and its born-to-run bars. I can love its teeming ghetto and its urban sprawl. I can love its old fires, new minarets, and golden menorahs.

261
02:07:58,166 --> 02:08:26,732
But can America love me too? Can she love my curry spices, roti, and oxtails? Can she love my hijab and henna tattoos? Can she love my Hajj, my Mecca, my Medina? Can she love my Cinco de Mayo, my Dia de los Muertos? Can she love my kente cloth, dreads, twists, and locks? Can she love the skin I'm in, be it ebony, ivory, dulce de leche, or cafe au lait?

262
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:51,749
Can she love me by name? Shekinah Glory, Muhammad bin Saeed, Anastasia Kozoff, Cleophis Dorcio, Claudia Gonzalez, can she love me by name? And what if I am among those huddled masses and that wretched refuge or that homeless, tempest-tossed, will she continue to lift her lamp?

263
02:08:52,551 --> 02:09:09,599
or do war and rumors of war, IEDs, sleeper cells, and faith distortions make me a pariah to be eliminated, a scourge to be annihilated, and a plague to be exterminated. I come in peace.

264
02:09:16,476 --> 02:09:41,664
I love this country, too. I love its boundless opportunity. I love its generosity of spirit. I love the audacity of its hope. I love its rolling meadows and its joyful songs. I love its asphalt highways and its little red Corvettes. I love its teeming ghetto and its urban sprawl. I love its old spires, new minarets, and golden menorah.

265
02:09:43,660 --> 02:10:01,203
I come in peace and I love America too. I come in peace and I love America too. That's our time. Once again, John Dalton on the drums.

266
02:10:02,278 --> 02:10:20,230
Greg Toro on bass, Jonathan Fagan on the keys. I'm Terry E. Cotter, that's Linda Lady Morose, and we are the Ally Project. Thank you so much for joining us this evening. We appreciate you making it out to this first outdoor jazz festival.

267
02:10:20,230 --> 02:10:49,667
More to come, definitely, but I want to thank our congenial, convivial, loving host, the West Medford Community Center, Incorporated. I want to thank Arts Alive, Medford Foundation, the Mystic River Watershed Association. Again, thanks to Cache, the Medford Arts Council, an offshoot of the Massachusetts Cultural Council, Medford Community Media, Audie and Sound Company, out of retirement.

268
02:10:49,667 --> 02:11:18,080
Avi Fagan, Kevin Harrington, Kyle Douglas, Lisa Crossman, our executive director, one of our board members, Melinda is out in the back there. Thank you, Melinda. And my man, Nathan. Nathan Montgomery.

269
02:11:18,882 --> 02:11:45,879
on the cameras, and we've had a blast. We've had a really good time. It was a little bit chilly. There's still refreshments inside, so go in and avail yourself. Jonathan and I will come in if you want a CD of Jonathan's music. If you want a book, I've got some books. And make sure that you stay tuned for what we've got coming up next, okay? There's always something good happening at the West Memphis Community Center. All right, God bless y'all.

270
02:11:58,899 --> 02:12:28,029
Oh, you were amazing. Oh, thank you so much. I was so nervous, and then it was cold. Oh, you're warm, too? Oh. Never leave me. Oh, yeah. I'm not going anywhere. You're going to have to carry me to the car.

271
02:12:33,541 --> 02:12:56,323
Thank you, it's chilly out, so I'm trying my best. Thank you, oh my gosh.

272
02:13:08,899 --> 02:13:19,855
It makes my heart so happy. It's really up to them. I'm just collaborating when I can.
