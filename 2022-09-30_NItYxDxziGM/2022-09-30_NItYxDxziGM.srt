1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:00,330
I'm

2
00:01:51,173 --> 00:01:55,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Jonathan, how do we help out people who are trying to donate money?

3
00:01:55,977 --> 00:01:56,338
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh?

4
00:01:56,618 --> 00:01:58,480
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we help out people who are trying to donate money?

5
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a jar inside actually.

6
00:02:00,842 --> 00:02:04,725
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, or if it's easier you can go to the vendor.

7
00:02:04,745 --> 00:02:06,286
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that's fine.

8
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:09,009
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so there's a jar, there's a jar for cash donation inside.

9
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:09,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay, thanks.

10
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:10,009
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

11
00:02:19,478 --> 00:02:21,981
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll probably be another five minutes or so.

12
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:24,204
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a little bit of time.

13
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:25,746
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want a snack, Dad?

14
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:26,707
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we have for snacks?

15
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:28,189
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretzels, chips, popcorn.

16
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:41,619
All right.

17
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,721
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we do have to do it.

18
00:03:07,705 --> 00:03:07,985
Okay.

19
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,232
[SPEAKER_01]: The cool kids hang out on the ramp there.

20
00:04:07,494 --> 00:04:08,157
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm picking up.

21
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:18,833
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like everything's fine until it starts.

22
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:24,718
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like when you're playing short stuff and the pitcher hasn't pitched yet, hasn't thrown anything yet.

23
00:04:24,758 --> 00:04:26,499
[SPEAKER_02]: The first note, all power goes out.

24
00:04:43,336 --> 00:04:50,506
[SPEAKER_02]: The band swung so hard, it ruined the entire concert.

25
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:53,810
[SPEAKER_02]: The jam was too smooth, so they went personal again.

26
00:04:56,598 --> 00:04:57,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue is the jazz club.

27
00:05:18,197 --> 00:05:20,619
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first started, I used to get gel.

28
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:50,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, here.

29
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:52,014
[SPEAKER_06]: You press a color, you know.

30
00:05:52,054 --> 00:06:00,500
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, even a songwriter can do it.

31
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:07,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, yeah, like the mic, it's kind of like, it's fine, because it's like roughly where, in between the keys and the drums.

32
00:06:08,024 --> 00:06:14,288
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, like I said, like, the sound stuff, more concert sound.

33
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

34
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,101
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Terry Cotter.

35
00:06:41,381 --> 00:06:45,202
[SPEAKER_10]: I manage elder services here at the West Medford Community Center.

36
00:06:46,943 --> 00:06:49,924
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm also the Poet Laureate of Medford, Massachusetts.

37
00:06:54,389 --> 00:07:05,708
[SPEAKER_10]: I won't get into the whole story because we'll talk again when we come up to play, but I want to introduce you to a friend of mine, a kindred spirit, a guy who's

38
00:07:06,937 --> 00:07:27,433
[SPEAKER_10]: musical abilities I appreciate so much and someone who has, you know, kind of taught me some things about how we can collaborate and cooperate and get together and do things that are meaningful without looking at each other suspiciously or as if we have ulterior motives or anything like that.

39
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:33,678
[SPEAKER_10]: So the convener, one of the original conveners of the Medford Jazz Festival,

40
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:37,390
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're hosting it for the first time outside.

41
00:07:38,012 --> 00:07:40,541
[SPEAKER_10]: My friend, Jonathan Fagan.

42
00:07:44,517 --> 00:07:45,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much, Terry.

43
00:07:46,058 --> 00:07:48,879
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a blast to get introduced by a poet laureate.

44
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,959
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many of you have had that experience.

45
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,060
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not very many.

46
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,941
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, yes.

47
00:07:54,361 --> 00:07:55,421
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Jonathan Fagan.

48
00:07:55,481 --> 00:08:01,103
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the producer of the Medford Jazz Festival, which has actually been going on for quite some time.

49
00:08:01,183 --> 00:08:06,805
[SPEAKER_00]: I joke with my friends that it started in Peter Cobb's laundromat about four years ago.

50
00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:09,006
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a place called Wash Vault Lab.

51
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:11,167
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on Boston Avenue in Medford.

52
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:13,688
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my first collaboration with, here, let me just,

53
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:16,412
[SPEAKER_00]: get this out of the way.

54
00:08:18,536 --> 00:08:25,400
[SPEAKER_00]: Medford Arts Council, and then that in turn led us to collaborate with Arts Alive Foundation, who's one of our primary sponsors this year.

55
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:36,645
[SPEAKER_00]: We launched a Patreon page three years ago, and of course, we were planning on doing the first festival in 2020, but well, 2020 was an interesting year for many reasons.

56
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:41,628
[SPEAKER_00]: So we streamed the whole thing from Bopstop Studios near Medford Center.

57
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:47,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much to George Tresk and all of our tech people that helped us with that, including Nathan Montgomery, who's

58
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:49,632
[SPEAKER_00]: running cameras tonight.

59
00:08:49,652 --> 00:08:51,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, please.

60
00:08:52,174 --> 00:09:00,319
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is, you know, this has been going on for some time, but it's so exciting to finally have a live event.

61
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:08,564
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really appreciate all of you coming and braving the cold weather to, you know, just really have a live audience tonight.

62
00:09:08,644 --> 00:09:15,909
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you also to those on the stream, which has been put together generously by Medford Community Media over there with Kevin Harrington.

63
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:21,877
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, she's okay.

64
00:09:22,698 --> 00:09:26,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you also to my father Avi Fagan for providing the sound.

65
00:09:27,745 --> 00:09:31,330
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been joking with people earlier today that I'm kind of bringing him out of retirement here.

66
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:31,791
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

67
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:39,351
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, that's the plus of having your dad be a sound engineer, is you can, yes, you have the secret weapon.

68
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:40,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Really.

69
00:09:40,911 --> 00:09:43,893
[SPEAKER_00]: So, a couple of other people to thank.

70
00:09:43,913 --> 00:09:49,955
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Terry Carter, for putting together this partnership with the West Medford Community Center.

71
00:09:50,116 --> 00:09:54,498
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been amazing to just have his support at pretty much every juncture of this.

72
00:09:55,238 --> 00:09:59,660
[SPEAKER_00]: And to the executive director, Lisa, who I believe will be...

73
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,219
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, she's on the run.

74
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:01,619
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

75
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:02,680
[SPEAKER_00]: Busy person.

76
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,061
[SPEAKER_00]: Executive director.

77
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:07,524
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally to our sponsors themselves.

78
00:10:08,364 --> 00:10:22,255
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with the people that are in our Patreon subscription who pay a couple dollars each month and they really do help raise money for events like this and also our monthly jam sessions which we've been doing quite a few of actually over the past year.

79
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:23,156
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had

80
00:10:23,596 --> 00:10:25,478
[SPEAKER_00]: between five and six over the past year.

81
00:10:25,498 --> 00:10:32,484
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great opportunity for a lot of adult students to get to play with professionals and for local musicians to network.

82
00:10:32,524 --> 00:10:34,907
[SPEAKER_00]: There is so much talent here in the Medford area.

83
00:10:35,047 --> 00:10:41,633
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still surprising to me every single month that we do it and someone shows up and great players.

84
00:10:43,134 --> 00:10:47,058
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you also to the Arts Alive Foundation, which is run by Mae Marbeck.

85
00:10:47,990 --> 00:11:11,710
[SPEAKER_00]: which has donated quite a bit to help make this possible and expand this into a two-day festival, to the Medford Arts Council for their continued support, to CACHE, which is a really wonderful organization here in Medford that connects a lot of artistic people to each other, and to the Mystic River Watershed Association, which really stepped in and also made this possible.

86
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,478
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope I'm not forgetting anybody.

87
00:11:16,518 --> 00:11:17,419
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I am.

88
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:21,023
[SPEAKER_00]: We have had a lot of support this year, which is amazing.

89
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:24,107
[SPEAKER_00]: Last, just a couple housekeeping things.

90
00:11:24,187 --> 00:11:28,232
[SPEAKER_00]: Bathrooms are inside, obviously, along with a donation.

91
00:11:29,493 --> 00:11:33,477
[SPEAKER_00]: A donation jar if you feel moved by what you see and hear today.

92
00:11:33,977 --> 00:11:35,538
[SPEAKER_00]: Please consider donating to us.

93
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:37,220
[SPEAKER_00]: Really everything does matter.

94
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,583
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a cliche, but a couple dollars at a time is how we've gotten to where we are.

95
00:11:42,524 --> 00:11:50,371
[SPEAKER_00]: There are CDs for sale and books for sale inside by both Terry and I. And there are snacks available for purchase for just a couple dollars each.

96
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:56,015
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe there will be some hot chocolate and coffee out there later.

97
00:11:57,276 --> 00:12:14,648
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further ado, I will introduce this first group, which is actually an ensemble of adult students that I've had the pleasure of working with over the past couple years over at Morningside Music Studio in Arlington, calling this the Beacon Blue Jazz Quintet.

98
00:12:14,808 --> 00:12:16,850
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't you guys come on up and we'll get started.

99
00:13:23,711 --> 00:13:36,635
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, one, two, three, four.

100
00:14:33,121 --> 00:14:33,482
you

101
00:15:19,705 --> 00:15:19,765
[SPEAKER_14]: do

102
00:16:24,603 --> 00:16:31,567
Background music playing.

103
00:17:02,608 --> 00:17:03,188
The end.

104
00:17:33,237 --> 00:17:34,458
Great, thanks.

105
00:17:35,159 --> 00:17:35,679
Oh.

106
00:17:35,739 --> 00:17:37,381
Great, thanks.

107
00:17:37,421 --> 00:17:42,605
Should we put my mic on?

108
00:18:00,425 --> 00:18:00,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, great.

109
00:18:00,885 --> 00:18:01,326
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.

110
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:02,647
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.

111
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,589
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a Grant Green composition called Flood in Franklin Park.

112
00:18:07,109 --> 00:18:09,171
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just take a second to introduce this band.

113
00:18:09,191 --> 00:18:11,993
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have Jeff Hopwood on the trumpet over there.

114
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:15,735
[SPEAKER_00]: Steven Weber on the saxophone.

115
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:18,797
[SPEAKER_00]: David Sands on the bass.

116
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,219
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill Kuklinski on guitar.

117
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:28,944
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mike Chen is all the way over there, hidden a little bit by the lights, but holding it down on drums.

118
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:35,455
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm still Jonathan Fagan, and I play piano.

119
00:18:35,995 --> 00:18:44,178
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do one of my favorite things to do as both an educator and just as an all-around musician is to have my students write things.

120
00:18:44,838 --> 00:18:51,640
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like our trumpet player, Jeff, has definitely taken up that challenge to a different level this year.

121
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,221
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he calls this one One Beer Blues.

122
00:18:54,921 --> 00:18:59,963
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as he explained it to me, when you have one beer, you're not feeling so great.

123
00:19:00,023 --> 00:19:04,624
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only when you get past that point that things tend to improve.

124
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,424
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a correct paraphrase?

125
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:08,285
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, yeah, there we go.

126
00:19:08,785 --> 00:19:12,326
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the, I mean, well, we'll see where it goes.

127
00:19:12,406 --> 00:19:15,687
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it'll evolve into two-beer territory, but we'll see.

128
00:19:16,227 --> 00:19:17,948
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one-beer blues, here we go.

129
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:31,743
[SPEAKER_14]: One, two, one, two, three, four.

130
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:02,501
do do

131
00:22:00,366 --> 00:22:00,527
you

132
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:37,285
[SPEAKER_14]: Mm hmm.

133
00:24:41,776 --> 00:24:44,117
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, The One Beer Blues by Jeff Hopwood.

134
00:24:44,597 --> 00:24:46,017
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to play one of mine now.

135
00:24:47,258 --> 00:24:52,660
[SPEAKER_00]: When I can, I love giving my groups some of my compositions just to think about.

136
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,281
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is called The Dreamcatcher.

137
00:24:54,881 --> 00:24:58,963
[SPEAKER_00]: It was written right after, well, a couple days after I saw Kenny Garrett.

138
00:25:00,303 --> 00:25:03,565
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great alto saxophone player who's inspired me in a number of ways.

139
00:25:04,385 --> 00:25:08,567
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has some hints of Kenny Garrett in it, but probably a number of other things, too.

140
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,412
Music Music

141
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Music playing

142
00:27:31,668 --> 00:27:37,674
Music playing

143
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:22,902
Music playing

144
00:31:40,714 --> 00:31:40,854
you

145
00:32:16,792 --> 00:32:24,275
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're going to do, well, all of the tunes that we've been working on recently are totally different in some ways.

146
00:32:24,315 --> 00:32:25,255
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, yes.

147
00:32:25,395 --> 00:32:26,616
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, yes.

148
00:32:26,776 --> 00:32:32,278
[SPEAKER_00]: This next one actually was brought in by our guitar player, Bill Kuklinski.

149
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:33,218
[SPEAKER_11]: You were there, too.

150
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:34,179
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there, too.

151
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:35,359
[SPEAKER_00]: That is true.

152
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:40,962
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, Bill and I a couple of years ago went on one of Morningside Music Studios

153
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:55,197
[SPEAKER_00]: basically music tours and we ended up in Venice with an amazing vocalist named Sheila Jordan but along the way we also met a bass player named Alvise Seiji who wrote this tune and

154
00:32:56,465 --> 00:32:59,107
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Bill was the one that still had the music, somehow.

155
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:07,933
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he liked the song, and he remembers to keep things on, like me, sometimes.

156
00:33:08,794 --> 00:33:09,694
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to play it for you.

157
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:11,196
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's called African Colors.

158
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:15,919
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, we're going to do a Hoagy Carmichael ballad, which is one of my favorites.

159
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:17,340
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's called The Nearness of You.

160
00:42:48,007 --> 00:42:48,227
[SPEAKER_14]: do

161
00:43:12,668 --> 00:43:12,788
[SPEAKER_14]: So,

162
00:44:50,723 --> 00:45:09,374
[SPEAKER_00]: All right that one again featured David Sands on the bass.

163
00:45:14,275 --> 00:45:18,099
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I guess, Jeff Hopwood on the trumpet with the melody.

164
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:18,699
[SPEAKER_00]: What the heck?

165
00:45:18,739 --> 00:45:20,461
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just introduce the whole band one more time.

166
00:45:20,481 --> 00:45:21,642
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great.

167
00:45:22,462 --> 00:45:28,188
[SPEAKER_00]: No, truly, this is a highlight of my week every time we get together.

168
00:45:28,528 --> 00:45:30,790
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill Kuklinski on the guitar, again.

169
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:32,592
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mike Channis on the drums.

170
00:45:33,837 --> 00:45:35,297
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do one more tune for you.

171
00:45:35,337 --> 00:45:39,819
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was suggested by our bass player, but some of you may recognize it as well.

172
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,260
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Miles Davis composition called Walking.

173
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:46,481
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, please stick around to hear the Ally Project.

174
00:45:47,301 --> 00:45:48,902
[SPEAKER_00]: Warm up inside if you have to.

175
00:45:49,182 --> 00:45:56,344
[SPEAKER_00]: The rumor goes that there's hot chocolate and coffee and maybe some other things in there, including books and CDs.

176
00:45:56,424 --> 00:45:58,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Shameless personal plug there.

177
00:46:00,845 --> 00:46:10,992
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, please consider, again, if you like what you hear, please consider joining our Patreon page or donating to the Medford Jazz Festival, which is on Venmo, and also we accept cash donations.

178
00:46:11,672 --> 00:46:14,794
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so here we go.

179
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:19,658
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how fast we can play this, given how cold our hands are at this particular moment.

180
00:52:10,822 --> 00:52:11,142
[SPEAKER_14]: do do

181
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,503
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, again, thank you so much.

182
00:52:47,544 --> 00:52:49,288
[SPEAKER_00]: The Beacon Blue Jazz Quintet.

183
00:52:50,552 --> 00:52:54,001
[SPEAKER_00]: Featuring Stephen Webber, Jeff Hopwood, David Sands, Phil Clinton.

184
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,702
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I just realize this at the very, very end?

185
00:53:02,182 --> 00:53:02,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, all right.

186
00:53:05,024 --> 00:53:07,606
[SPEAKER_00]: Musicians can only count up to four, that's the saying.

187
00:53:08,187 --> 00:53:19,395
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, please stick around, warm up, get a snack, explore the inside of the iconic West Bedford Community Center, and be back in about 10 to 15 minutes for the Ally Project.

188
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:28,627
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, that's me because I've never done that.

189
00:53:28,647 --> 00:53:30,491
[SPEAKER_15]: I was following instructions.

190
00:53:30,531 --> 00:53:30,912
[SPEAKER_15]: You did.

191
00:53:30,992 --> 00:53:32,755
[SPEAKER_15]: You told me and I still didn't respond.

192
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,321
Thank you.

193
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:08,618
[SPEAKER_14]: Good to see you.

194
00:54:08,658 --> 00:54:09,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Glad you made it.

195
00:54:09,738 --> 00:54:10,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

196
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:12,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Go inside and get a little heat.

197
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,781
[SPEAKER_13]: How you doing?

198
00:54:42,463 --> 00:54:47,226
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys want to go inside and get warm for a few minutes?

199
00:55:12,555 --> 00:55:13,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

200
00:55:47,827 --> 00:55:48,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, hey.

201
00:55:48,968 --> 00:55:49,348
Hey, hey.

202
00:55:49,508 --> 00:55:50,348
One, two, two.

203
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:51,989
Two, two.

204
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, hey, one, two, two.

205
00:56:17,312 --> 00:56:19,352
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're Jonathan's father?

206
00:56:19,372 --> 00:56:20,153
[SPEAKER_05]: I am, yeah.

207
00:56:20,273 --> 00:56:20,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

208
00:56:21,133 --> 00:56:23,774
[SPEAKER_05]: You look like you're his older brother or something.

209
00:56:23,834 --> 00:56:23,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Go on.

210
00:56:24,034 --> 00:56:25,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, hey, one, two, two.

211
00:56:25,695 --> 00:56:29,216
[SPEAKER_05]: I am 70, so I guess I could be your father.

212
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,822
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not getting paid, you're retired.

213
00:57:17,782 --> 00:57:20,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, hey, one, two, two, two, two, two.

214
00:57:20,284 --> 00:57:21,365
Awesome, awesome.

215
00:57:49,728 --> 00:57:50,408
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

216
00:58:11,685 --> 00:58:15,448
[SPEAKER_11]: On that song, I don't do much.

217
00:58:15,528 --> 00:58:18,130
[SPEAKER_11]: I just kind of throw it out there.

218
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:21,592
What you're going to do is have to really listen.

219
00:58:42,729 --> 00:58:43,032
Yeah.

220
00:59:03,514 --> 00:59:04,275
We're hanging out.

221
00:59:29,701 --> 00:59:30,402
[SPEAKER_15]: How are you kids?

222
01:00:02,921 --> 01:00:03,784
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, it's a wild card, right?

223
01:00:35,934 --> 01:00:40,197
[SPEAKER_03]: I finally came and bought a stand light.

224
01:00:40,237 --> 01:00:50,043
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny, I played with this guy, just, you know, like folk music, but he's like, you know, it's all arranged.

225
01:00:50,123 --> 01:00:53,785
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you're playing like the Rhymes, you know?

226
01:00:54,145 --> 01:00:56,086
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you can't see any of the charts.

227
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:59,849
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I'm like, okay, I gotta finally get one of these.

228
01:01:00,069 --> 01:01:03,711
[SPEAKER_03]: I managed to avoid it for however many years I've been playing Rhymes.

229
01:01:05,648 --> 01:01:06,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.

230
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:07,071
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

231
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:38,911
[SPEAKER_03]: My bass has been through worse than this.

232
01:02:00,231 --> 01:02:02,755
[SPEAKER_04]: The seam is starting to open up a little bit

233
01:02:15,182 --> 01:02:19,123
[SPEAKER_04]: But the back is just coming slightly unglued.

234
01:02:19,783 --> 01:02:28,046
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, you know, it's not getting any worse, but that's the kind of thing they could like, you know, south quickly.

235
01:02:28,126 --> 01:02:31,067
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd rather just get it taken care of.

236
01:02:31,107 --> 01:02:34,908
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, luckily I only have one upright piece.

237
01:02:36,408 --> 01:02:36,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.

238
01:02:51,505 --> 01:02:57,126
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like, that's like, yeah, that's like, you know, it's bad.

239
01:02:57,226 --> 01:02:58,187
[SPEAKER_03]: It's bad.

240
01:02:58,287 --> 01:03:01,107
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's just like, it's in a word.

241
01:03:01,127 --> 01:03:01,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I dig it.

242
01:03:01,928 --> 01:03:05,028
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like, it looks like I look over here and out of it.

243
01:03:05,108 --> 01:03:05,609
[SPEAKER_06]: The lights.

244
01:03:05,629 --> 01:03:06,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, cool.

245
01:03:20,253 --> 01:03:20,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

246
01:03:52,936 --> 01:03:53,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, are you Linda?

247
01:03:54,017 --> 01:03:54,137
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

248
01:03:54,157 --> 01:03:54,837
[SPEAKER_15]: What happened?

249
01:03:54,877 --> 01:03:55,917
[SPEAKER_15]: I need a stand.

250
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:57,438
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought we were in the lobby.

251
01:03:58,018 --> 01:03:59,939
[SPEAKER_12]: This is your monitor.

252
01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:00,619
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, OK.

253
01:04:00,659 --> 01:04:01,900
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll be on this side?

254
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:02,280
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess so.

255
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:02,460
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

256
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,821
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you have another stand for me?

257
01:04:05,401 --> 01:04:07,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me check with Jonathan.

258
01:04:07,142 --> 01:04:08,102
[SPEAKER_04]: That one might be available.

259
01:04:08,182 --> 01:04:09,482
[SPEAKER_04]: The one sitting downstairs there.

260
01:04:09,502 --> 01:04:10,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Jonathan.

261
01:04:10,483 --> 01:04:11,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Jonathan, Linda needs a music stand.

262
01:04:12,704 --> 01:04:13,544
[SPEAKER_00]: Another music stand?

263
01:04:13,984 --> 01:04:14,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

264
01:04:14,564 --> 01:04:20,427
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we got this one over here.

265
01:04:20,447 --> 01:04:20,867
[SPEAKER_14]: That's perfect.

266
01:04:20,887 --> 01:04:20,987
[SPEAKER_14]: Do it.

267
01:04:21,007 --> 01:04:21,227
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it.

268
01:04:21,307 --> 01:04:21,447
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it.

269
01:04:22,961 --> 01:04:24,941
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they should only need one.

270
01:04:24,981 --> 01:04:27,842
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I think that's good.

271
01:04:27,962 --> 01:04:29,922
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's not a good one.

272
01:04:30,042 --> 01:04:31,103
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little louder.

273
01:04:31,123 --> 01:04:32,703
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little louder.

274
01:04:32,803 --> 01:04:33,463
[SPEAKER_06]: One more monitor?

275
01:04:33,503 --> 01:04:33,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

276
01:04:50,632 --> 01:04:53,033
[SPEAKER_06]: I always like to, if you're going to pray, to pray.

277
01:04:53,273 --> 01:04:58,614
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, I forgot that that one.

278
01:04:58,634 --> 01:04:59,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Try that.

279
01:04:59,094 --> 01:05:00,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, right, right.

280
01:05:00,615 --> 01:05:01,715
[SPEAKER_14]: That's good, nice.

281
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:05,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey Tyler, come here.

282
01:05:05,156 --> 01:05:08,977
[SPEAKER_15]: As you can hear, Terry and all, do you want to look at Terry and yours?

283
01:05:15,067 --> 01:05:19,190
[SPEAKER_07]: I should be able to hear him beside me, right?

284
01:05:20,131 --> 01:05:22,412
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he's talking and then I'm just singing with him.

285
01:05:22,573 --> 01:05:24,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're in the same time.

286
01:05:24,234 --> 01:05:25,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a little background.

287
01:05:25,435 --> 01:05:27,676
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be singing a few lines together.

288
01:05:27,736 --> 01:05:28,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it'll be a vibe.

289
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

290
01:05:55,248 --> 01:05:55,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

291
01:06:06,849 --> 01:06:08,831
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll bring you up to reprise, okay?

292
01:06:08,911 --> 01:06:13,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, and then we'll do a couple other pieces, and then we'll go up to legacy, okay?

293
01:06:13,714 --> 01:06:14,695
[SPEAKER_10]: And then toward the back.

294
01:06:14,795 --> 01:06:15,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, you got it all?

295
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:16,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, okay, well you can.

296
01:06:33,302 --> 01:06:34,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I finally got it, man.

297
01:06:34,222 --> 01:06:35,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I got it just this month.

298
01:07:01,406 --> 01:07:02,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to go?

299
01:07:02,467 --> 01:07:02,947
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured.

300
01:07:02,967 --> 01:07:04,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's all good.

301
01:07:04,227 --> 01:07:05,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm way ahead of you.

302
01:07:27,498 --> 01:07:29,599
[SPEAKER_06]: So Nathan, just all me the whole night.

303
01:07:29,619 --> 01:07:30,939
[SPEAKER_13]: You got it?

304
01:07:30,959 --> 01:07:31,199
[SPEAKER_13]: Perfect.

305
01:07:31,239 --> 01:07:32,660
[SPEAKER_13]: I got to post it on Instagram.

306
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:37,041
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I'm going to zoom in on your right hand.

307
01:07:37,181 --> 01:07:37,361
Yes.

308
01:07:37,421 --> 01:07:37,682
Perfect.

309
01:07:37,702 --> 01:07:38,142
Perfect.

310
01:08:44,215 --> 01:08:45,662
I can't really stand that.

311
01:09:41,409 --> 01:09:48,174
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been painting my apartment all day, man.

312
01:09:48,214 --> 01:09:53,917
[SPEAKER_04]: My hand is like... I didn't realize how tired my hand was cramping up earlier.

313
01:10:04,222 --> 01:10:06,023
[SPEAKER_09]: We won't protect it anymore.

314
01:10:06,043 --> 01:10:08,145
[SPEAKER_15]: That's how you know the intermission is over.

315
01:10:08,165 --> 01:10:09,726
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't want to miss this.

316
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:35,200
[SPEAKER_09]: So

317
01:10:53,973 --> 01:10:56,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for hanging in with us.

318
01:10:57,074 --> 01:11:03,456
[SPEAKER_10]: We're back here trying to talk about being a little bit chilly, but it's cold.

319
01:11:04,516 --> 01:11:05,937
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's cold.

320
01:11:06,237 --> 01:11:11,598
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's been a warm night, and the Beacon Blues Band was real nice.

321
01:11:11,618 --> 01:11:15,039
[SPEAKER_10]: They got us started out well, and we really appreciate that.

322
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:19,981
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to just remember to thank our sponsors once again.

323
01:11:21,021 --> 01:11:31,306
[SPEAKER_10]: the host and the provider of this lovely venue, the West Medford Community Center Incorporated, my home.

324
01:11:32,387 --> 01:11:48,335
[SPEAKER_10]: I also want to thank the Arts Alive Medford Foundation, the Mystic River Watershed Association, Cache Medford Arts Council, and a special thank you to Kevin Harrington,

325
01:11:49,135 --> 01:11:59,841
[SPEAKER_10]: from Method Community Media and Kyle Douglas who is here working and Kat Darnell who all came over to make sure that we could do a live stream and a YouTube.

326
01:12:00,021 --> 01:12:12,227
[SPEAKER_10]: So for those of you that are out there watching this on your computers, your laptops, your television on 3 or 47, we appreciate, we appreciate you being with us.

327
01:12:13,047 --> 01:12:24,316
[SPEAKER_10]: As Jonathan said earlier, Medford Jazz Festival also has a Patreon account, so if you want to contribute to Patreon, we have information about that inside.

328
01:12:25,457 --> 01:12:30,481
[SPEAKER_10]: When we finish up, Jonathan and I both have some product, as they call it, in the trade.

329
01:12:30,501 --> 01:12:32,263
[SPEAKER_10]: He has some CDs.

330
01:12:32,343 --> 01:12:34,705
[SPEAKER_10]: I have some of my fifth book.

331
01:12:34,745 --> 01:12:36,126
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm working on my sixth now.

332
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:43,343
[SPEAKER_10]: Jonathan and I basically met at the intersection of jazz and social justice.

333
01:12:44,223 --> 01:12:46,124
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's what we call this music.

334
01:12:46,945 --> 01:12:59,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Music is, to a great extent, that intersection where jazz, which has always been a progressive thing in the United States, meets social justice, which is really becoming a

335
01:13:00,792 --> 01:13:02,435
[SPEAKER_10]: a thing all over again.

336
01:13:02,615 --> 01:13:14,015
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're happy to be working together under any circumstances, but we think it's necessary for us to work together under these particular circumstances.

337
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:24,222
[SPEAKER_10]: So by his definition and in my agreement, this is the Ally Project.

338
01:13:24,643 --> 01:13:26,345
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to introduce the players.

339
01:13:27,086 --> 01:13:30,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Over here on the traps, on the drums, John Dalton.

340
01:13:32,936 --> 01:13:37,760
[SPEAKER_10]: And John's got like six, seven different groups that he plays with, right?

341
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:41,964
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got a great, great group called Spheres of Influence.

342
01:13:42,504 --> 01:13:45,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Spheres of Influence, okay?

343
01:13:45,426 --> 01:13:49,250
[SPEAKER_10]: S-P-H-E-R-E-S, Spheres of Influence.

344
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:54,414
[SPEAKER_10]: And they do some real, real good edgy stuff.

345
01:13:54,994 --> 01:14:00,479
[SPEAKER_10]: We got my man Greg Turow on what I call the big sexy, okay?

346
01:14:02,129 --> 01:14:04,652
[SPEAKER_10]: That stand up bass with the hourglass figure.

347
01:14:05,332 --> 01:14:06,193
[SPEAKER_10]: It's real cool.

348
01:14:06,813 --> 01:14:10,857
[SPEAKER_10]: And then my friend, and really Jonathan found me.

349
01:14:10,917 --> 01:14:15,541
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he had seen something that I did maybe at Martin Luther King.

350
01:14:15,742 --> 01:14:16,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it Martin Luther King Day?

351
01:14:18,103 --> 01:14:32,593
[SPEAKER_10]: And he sought me out, and we just started talking about how we could again integrate this theme of jazz, him as a musician, a composer, an arranger, a teacher, a man of many talents, and me as a humble poet.

352
01:14:32,873 --> 01:14:36,415
[SPEAKER_10]: And before you know it, this thing just started to evolve.

353
01:14:36,495 --> 01:14:39,818
[SPEAKER_10]: So a little over a month ago,

354
01:14:40,788 --> 01:14:43,711
[SPEAKER_10]: We were in the studio recording our first CD.

355
01:14:45,132 --> 01:14:53,539
[SPEAKER_10]: And we brought together this group, but also a very talented woman, who you'll hear some from a little bit later.

356
01:14:53,639 --> 01:14:54,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Her name is Linda.

357
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Call her Lady Morose.

358
01:14:56,702 --> 01:14:58,483
[SPEAKER_10]: And I found her.

359
01:15:01,085 --> 01:15:05,187
[SPEAKER_10]: based on another friend who's also a musician and a poet named Max Heinig.

360
01:15:05,688 --> 01:15:16,914
[SPEAKER_10]: And Max teaches at Medford High School and she was one of his students and when he recorded his recent CD, which I actually contributed a song to, Linda was his singer.

361
01:15:17,494 --> 01:15:20,816
[SPEAKER_10]: And I heard her at the Medford Public Library and I was done.

362
01:15:21,716 --> 01:15:22,737
[SPEAKER_10]: I was completely done.

363
01:15:22,777 --> 01:15:30,601
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, you know, when Jonathan and I were talking, we said, well, you know, maybe we could get a singer to add some layers, a little bit of subtext to this thing.

364
01:15:30,981 --> 01:15:32,562
[SPEAKER_10]: And I said, I got just the person.

365
01:15:33,322 --> 01:15:36,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Hence, Linda will be singing with us in a little while.

366
01:15:36,584 --> 01:15:37,564
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to get to it.

367
01:15:39,005 --> 01:15:47,716
[SPEAKER_10]: This first piece really defines the relationship of this community, West Medford, with greater Medford.

368
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:53,363
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a historical but somewhat fragmented relationship.

369
01:15:53,924 --> 01:15:56,647
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, it began

370
01:15:58,348 --> 01:16:10,391
[SPEAKER_10]: probably 15, 20 years after the Civil War, and has evolved to a very different West Medford than the West Medford that I grew up with, but that's another story for another poem.

371
01:16:10,891 --> 01:16:13,012
[SPEAKER_10]: This piece is called Hired by the Mystic.

372
01:16:18,253 --> 01:16:22,014
[SPEAKER_10]: They gave my people the lowlands, and not much of it.

373
01:16:23,094 --> 01:16:24,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a few streets high by the river.

374
01:16:25,854 --> 01:16:29,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Banks turned a blind eye behind the red lines, and it wasn't about the money.

375
01:16:30,498 --> 01:16:32,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Class was an irresistible force.

376
01:16:33,761 --> 01:16:35,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Race was an immovable object.

377
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:51,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps it wasn't a written rule, but white folks knew the legal tool to keep us in our place in this mystic valley space, where slaves and rum and chips had built some mansions, made some millionaires, and hid some old money.

378
01:16:53,422 --> 01:16:55,402
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was hard by the mystic we went.

379
01:16:56,783 --> 01:16:58,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Muddy and a bit turned down.

380
01:16:58,903 --> 01:17:03,804
[SPEAKER_10]: The only place where one could be brown in this ancient Middlesex County town.

381
01:17:04,664 --> 01:17:05,645
[SPEAKER_10]: But we named it.

382
01:17:06,085 --> 01:17:06,825
[SPEAKER_10]: We claimed it.

383
01:17:07,225 --> 01:17:08,665
[SPEAKER_10]: We made it our own.

384
01:17:10,566 --> 01:17:18,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Even in the heat of summer when the shores were pipes and the soil was rank with the decay of aquatic alchemy, we were one with the river.

385
01:17:19,247 --> 01:17:22,128
[SPEAKER_10]: We followed its flow to the lakes and the sandy beachfront.

386
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:31,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Like our own Jordan Shore, we baptized and blessed our brothers and sisters in Christ.

387
01:17:31,704 --> 01:17:40,608
[SPEAKER_10]: We caught the little fishes to go with our loaves of bread and became the teaming multitude who our Lord Jesus fed, hired by the mission.

388
01:17:42,569 --> 01:17:43,850
[SPEAKER_10]: We became community.

389
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:45,751
[SPEAKER_10]: We commanded unity.

390
01:17:46,231 --> 01:17:49,853
[SPEAKER_10]: We embraced the village and raised up our children in the way they should go.

391
01:17:52,066 --> 01:17:57,110
[SPEAKER_10]: As the river ebbs and flows, the tide will turn and our fortune grows.

392
01:17:57,810 --> 01:17:59,952
[SPEAKER_10]: A few more streets become our home.

393
01:18:00,632 --> 01:18:03,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Houses on Sharon join Kin on Jerome.

394
01:18:04,415 --> 01:18:09,839
[SPEAKER_10]: From Duggar Park to the railroad tracks, the landed folks make more room for blacks.

395
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:12,580
[SPEAKER_10]: The color line recedes a bit.

396
01:18:13,141 --> 01:18:15,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Church and school and center sit.

397
01:18:16,523 --> 01:18:20,346
[SPEAKER_10]: The Ville becomes the heart of it, hard by the mystic shore.

398
01:18:33,854 --> 01:18:40,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Now the worm has surely turned, and folks who left have surely learned things couldn't stay the same.

399
01:18:41,792 --> 01:18:44,333
[SPEAKER_10]: The muddy mystic most days is clean.

400
01:18:44,393 --> 01:18:46,934
[SPEAKER_10]: The banks are freshly cut and green.

401
01:18:47,634 --> 01:18:51,755
[SPEAKER_10]: Faces once distinctly brown are not the only ones in town.

402
01:18:52,756 --> 01:18:59,298
[SPEAKER_10]: The streets that once were our confines must now embrace what gentry defined.

403
01:19:00,038 --> 01:19:09,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Condominium culture, bedroom convenience, university sprawl, access, e-graph, access,

404
01:19:15,595 --> 01:19:27,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Now those lowlands have become the highlights of a trending city and sometimes that success isn't pretty when it's at the expense of your black and brown and tan family.

405
01:19:29,528 --> 01:19:41,719
[SPEAKER_10]: And yet, the river still turns and bends from where it begins to where it ends.

406
01:19:42,711 --> 01:20:00,160
[SPEAKER_10]: the only place where one could be brown in this ancient Middlesex County town where we named it and claimed it and made it our own.

407
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:06,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

408
01:20:06,703 --> 01:20:07,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

409
01:20:07,644 --> 01:20:10,645
[SPEAKER_10]: So now that you have a bit of the history,

410
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:14,929
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to talk institutionally.

411
01:20:16,069 --> 01:20:23,032
[SPEAKER_10]: And in West Medford, when I was growing up, there were three, maybe four institutions that were really, really important to us.

412
01:20:23,812 --> 01:20:27,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Now you're sitting in the patio of one of them, West Medford Community Center.

413
01:20:27,114 --> 01:20:31,715
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the second building on the site, but this organization goes back 1945-ish.

414
01:20:33,775 --> 01:20:39,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, when a group of men from West Medford determined that they needed a place to be somebody.

415
01:20:40,386 --> 01:20:42,990
[SPEAKER_10]: So they actually carted up from

416
01:20:44,535 --> 01:20:51,960
[SPEAKER_10]: temporary military installation in Charlestown, what's called a Quonset hut, or military barracks in pieces.

417
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:58,144
[SPEAKER_10]: They brought it to this site, they poured a foundation, and they built the original West Medford Community Center.

418
01:20:58,464 --> 01:21:08,331
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the second iteration of that building, and so this is one of the great institutions of the West Medford Community Center, West Medford Community.

419
01:21:09,284 --> 01:21:15,226
[SPEAKER_10]: The other great institution was called Shiloh Baptist Church, and it's on the corner of Holton and Bower Streets.

420
01:21:15,326 --> 01:21:23,389
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still there, it's still ministering to the needs of a predominantly African American congregation.

421
01:21:24,309 --> 01:21:31,131
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the third institution was not as, not what you think it would be.

422
01:21:31,211 --> 01:21:35,673
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a school, it's not a university, it's not, let me just read the poem.

423
01:21:37,874 --> 01:21:38,634
[SPEAKER_10]: The Little Store.

424
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:02,363
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a tiny red hovel on upper Jerome, a bit rundown and rough around the edges.

425
01:22:03,443 --> 01:22:11,207
[SPEAKER_10]: And Mr. Henry seemed so old to us, even then, with a lot of whiskers, impatient and a little scary.

426
01:22:12,381 --> 01:22:15,002
[SPEAKER_10]: One would suspect that he didn't even like kids.

427
01:22:15,562 --> 01:22:18,842
[SPEAKER_10]: But he really must have loved us.

428
01:22:19,142 --> 01:22:22,903
[SPEAKER_10]: Or else, where did all that penny candy come from?

429
01:22:23,823 --> 01:22:24,583
[SPEAKER_10]: He had all of it.

430
01:22:24,843 --> 01:22:26,384
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, seriously.

431
01:22:26,664 --> 01:22:32,345
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd bust in there with a few nickels or a handful of pennies, all loud and unruly.

432
01:22:33,745 --> 01:22:37,046
[SPEAKER_10]: He'd hush us up while he finished with grown folks' business.

433
01:22:37,998 --> 01:22:41,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Then he'd be back like a black Willy Wonka up in that old shack.

434
01:22:42,043 --> 01:22:46,369
[SPEAKER_10]: He'd peer over those old horn rimmed glasses and tell us he didn't have all day.

435
01:22:46,389 --> 01:22:55,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Then he'd blow open one of those small brown craft paper bags and get to stuffing while we were oohing and aahing.

436
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:58,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Muffin and Puffin.

437
01:22:58,962 --> 01:23:02,044
[SPEAKER_10]: See, Mr. Henry had all the treats.

438
01:23:02,545 --> 01:23:03,546
[SPEAKER_10]: All of our favorites.

439
01:23:04,066 --> 01:23:05,908
[SPEAKER_10]: 100 great sweets.

440
01:23:07,389 --> 01:23:09,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Root beer barrels and pixie sticks.

441
01:23:09,490 --> 01:23:11,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Squirrel nut zippers and banana splits.

442
01:23:11,632 --> 01:23:13,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Green mint juleps and button strips.

443
01:23:13,754 --> 01:23:15,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Red licorice ropes and bottle nips.

444
01:23:16,056 --> 01:23:18,398
[SPEAKER_10]: He had bazooka Joe bubble gum.

445
01:23:18,758 --> 01:23:20,900
[SPEAKER_10]: And a tiny sucker called a dum-dum.

446
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Yaw breakers and Tootsie Rolls.

447
01:23:23,702 --> 01:23:25,886
[SPEAKER_10]: Sugary love for little kids sold.

448
01:23:26,947 --> 01:23:32,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Candy necklaces to wear and fight, and waxy red lips were such a sight.

449
01:23:32,876 --> 01:23:37,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Fat gum cigars and kid cigarettes right beside the crunchy sticks.

450
01:23:40,132 --> 01:23:44,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Hot fireballs and Mexican hats.

451
01:23:45,156 --> 01:23:48,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Just the genuine Percy's kisses.

452
01:23:48,418 --> 01:23:50,640
[SPEAKER_10]: All of the hits and none of the misses.

453
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Like kids' taffy squares and Necco wafers.

454
01:23:54,822 --> 01:23:56,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Liquor made in Boston may be.

455
01:23:57,384 --> 01:24:00,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Gold rocks, nuggets of gum in a bag.

456
01:24:23,663 --> 01:24:26,965
[SPEAKER_10]: from cold January to chilly December.

457
01:24:28,186 --> 01:24:33,951
[SPEAKER_10]: More kinds of candy than I can remember at the Mill storefront on Upper Jerome.

458
01:24:34,871 --> 01:24:37,493
[SPEAKER_10]: I knew I had to write this poem.

459
01:24:37,533 --> 01:24:45,039
[SPEAKER_10]: See, Mr. Henry had all of the treats, all of our favorites, a hundred great sweets.

460
01:24:53,820 --> 01:25:07,706
[SPEAKER_10]: So now I have the distinct pleasure of welcoming to the stage our collaborator, our friend, a muse of sorts, Linda Lady Moreau.

461
01:25:14,358 --> 01:25:23,504
[SPEAKER_10]: We're gonna do an old tune, a takeoff on an old tune by Nat Simon, popularized by the pianist Ahmed Jamal.

462
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:31,889
[SPEAKER_10]: That tune was called Poinciana, and this riff on Poinciana is called Reprise for Poinciana.

463
01:25:41,428 --> 01:25:44,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect a fantasy in black and tan.

464
01:25:45,049 --> 01:25:48,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Between the Savoy ballroom and a Paris can-can.

465
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:51,631
[SPEAKER_10]: The kind of blue that doesn't get you down.

466
01:25:52,291 --> 01:25:56,072
[SPEAKER_10]: It rather has you twirling round and round and round.

467
01:25:56,232 --> 01:25:59,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of blue, but not really.

468
01:26:01,397 --> 01:26:09,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Like a conversation between Miles and Q in a smoke-filled corner, just those two talking about the music round midnight.

469
01:26:10,022 --> 01:26:17,786
[SPEAKER_10]: Miles and that miraculous horn, all gravel-voicing, full of scorn, asking Q, what made you feel like doing stuff like that?

470
01:26:19,267 --> 01:26:22,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Jazz finds justice in the majesty of the blues.

471
01:26:22,809 --> 01:26:26,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Take five to wonder, and you'll know that this is true.

472
01:26:26,711 --> 01:26:29,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Deep and delicious all over.

473
01:26:30,728 --> 01:26:36,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Pondered passionately in pianissimo, keeping standard time.

474
01:26:36,571 --> 01:26:47,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Duke's mood indigo, Joe Sample's rainbow seeker, Errol Garner's misty worship in the style of G. You know the melody, songs you just can't get out of your head.

475
01:26:47,517 --> 01:26:50,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of blue, but not really.

476
01:26:52,466 --> 01:26:56,893
[SPEAKER_10]: just like the woman whose name you call as autumn leaves begin to fall.

477
01:26:58,836 --> 01:27:03,042
[SPEAKER_10]: Or maybe like that melody by Ahmad Jamal.

478
01:27:04,281 --> 01:27:05,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Po-en-ci-a-na.

479
01:27:06,723 --> 01:27:09,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Last days of sun and sand and sea.

480
01:27:09,845 --> 01:27:12,987
[SPEAKER_10]: You and your love and the music made three.

481
01:27:13,467 --> 01:27:17,310
[SPEAKER_10]: A lyric so familiar, a song so free, so sweet.

482
01:27:17,950 --> 01:27:19,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Ebony notes on an ivory sheet.

483
01:27:20,252 --> 01:27:22,233
[SPEAKER_10]: New tear stains on every page.

484
01:27:22,614 --> 01:27:25,376
[SPEAKER_10]: A bit of your heart in a crystal cage.

485
01:27:26,416 --> 01:27:30,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of blue, but not really.

486
01:27:31,892 --> 01:27:34,754
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll remember her most round midnight.

487
01:27:35,415 --> 01:27:41,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Poesiana, fragrant, fresh wind recollections, a song reprise.

488
01:27:41,619 --> 01:27:48,264
[SPEAKER_12]: Summer breeze makes me feel fine.

489
01:27:48,924 --> 01:27:52,066
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, through the jazz winds of my mind.

490
01:27:56,516 --> 01:28:03,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Miles in queue in that smoke-filled corner, talking about taking the A train, going up to Smalls Paradise.

491
01:28:03,583 --> 01:28:10,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Sassy's going to be scatting, and Hawk's band is in town, doing jazz some real justice.

492
01:28:11,391 --> 01:28:17,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Marvelous, majestic, and kind of blue, but not really.

493
01:28:18,496 --> 01:28:20,517
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll remember her most round midnight.

494
01:28:20,878 --> 01:28:22,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Po-en-ci-a-na.

495
01:28:22,979 --> 01:28:26,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Pungent rose petal pictures, a song reprise.

496
01:28:26,461 --> 01:28:33,906
[SPEAKER_12]: The first time ever I saw your face.

497
01:28:44,295 --> 01:28:58,543
[SPEAKER_10]: fantasy perfected in cocoa and cream, Harlem nights in a Moulin Rouge daydream, the kind of blue that fills your soul, engulfs your spirit, and makes you whole.

498
01:28:58,943 --> 01:29:11,190
[SPEAKER_10]: My Poinciana, I'll remember you most round midnight, frail fragments of love's fulfillment, kind of blue, but not really.

499
01:29:12,267 --> 01:29:14,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Your song, reprise.

500
01:29:15,510 --> 01:29:28,261
[SPEAKER_12]: ♪ Till you come back to me ♪ ♪ That's what I'm gonna do ♪ Poinciana, my Poinciana.

501
01:29:32,985 --> 01:29:33,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Linda Morales.

502
01:29:37,649 --> 01:29:38,871
[SPEAKER_10]: John Dalton on the drums.

503
01:29:41,112 --> 01:29:47,018
[SPEAKER_10]: Rafe Toro on the stand up, Jonathan Fagan on the keys, and I'm Terry Cotter.

504
01:29:49,421 --> 01:29:53,985
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Linda, you just know, right?

505
01:29:54,366 --> 01:29:55,467
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

506
01:29:57,169 --> 01:29:57,349
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

507
01:29:59,011 --> 01:30:13,919
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, at the intersection of jazz and social justice, there's some real nice music, but there's also some dangerous stuff that's taking place, some dangerous stuff that we have to take into account and play about.

508
01:30:14,439 --> 01:30:17,641
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're gonna play a piece called Microaggressions.

509
01:30:31,035 --> 01:30:32,757
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll never know what this feels like.

510
01:30:32,777 --> 01:30:40,846
[SPEAKER_10]: 24-7, 365, 366 in the leap year, and it's definitely a black thing.

511
01:30:42,147 --> 01:30:42,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

512
01:30:43,389 --> 01:30:44,510
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so glad you asked.

513
01:30:45,051 --> 01:30:49,315
[SPEAKER_10]: You call the police on us like you're calling a building manager to come unclog your toilet.

514
01:30:49,976 --> 01:30:50,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

515
01:30:50,717 --> 01:30:51,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you can.

516
01:30:52,403 --> 01:30:54,764
[SPEAKER_10]: The skin you're in says, I win.

517
01:30:55,904 --> 01:30:57,485
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't ever be too loud.

518
01:30:58,265 --> 01:30:59,866
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't ever be too educated.

519
01:31:00,426 --> 01:31:02,226
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't ever be too proud.

520
01:31:02,426 --> 01:31:04,387
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't ever be too dedicated.

521
01:31:06,048 --> 01:31:08,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody follows you around in Nordstrom just because.

522
01:31:09,649 --> 01:31:13,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody asks you for your ID on campus just because.

523
01:31:14,410 --> 01:31:21,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody sprints and cuffs you without provocation just because, just because of the skin you're in.

524
01:31:24,025 --> 01:31:25,186
[SPEAKER_10]: You can never be too loud.

525
01:31:26,027 --> 01:31:27,969
[SPEAKER_10]: You can never be too educated.

526
01:31:28,049 --> 01:31:29,690
[SPEAKER_10]: You can never be too proud.

527
01:31:30,231 --> 01:31:31,972
[SPEAKER_10]: You can never be too dedicated.

528
01:31:33,334 --> 01:31:34,755
[SPEAKER_10]: We live with this every day.

529
01:31:36,176 --> 01:31:37,798
[SPEAKER_10]: We deal with this every day.

530
01:31:38,419 --> 01:31:40,861
[SPEAKER_10]: We're mindful of this every day.

531
01:31:41,321 --> 01:31:43,964
[SPEAKER_10]: We're stressed by this every day.

532
01:31:45,984 --> 01:31:47,946
[SPEAKER_10]: never walked a mile in my shoes.

533
01:31:47,986 --> 01:31:51,269
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't feel how much these shoes pinch my toes.

534
01:31:51,569 --> 01:31:58,295
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't feel the tightness and discomfort in every step I have to take in a whitewashed world.

535
01:32:05,241 --> 01:32:05,841
[SPEAKER_10]: But why?

536
01:32:06,882 --> 01:32:12,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Why does it take 26 bullets to subdue a black boy with his back turned and no weapon save a cell phone?

537
01:32:14,656 --> 01:32:24,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do major corporations like Unilever, H&M, and Heineken perpetuate racial stereotypes with tone-deaf advertising on the regular?

538
01:32:26,729 --> 01:32:34,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Why does the sitting potent think it's okay to call the country where my people came from, home?

539
01:32:37,355 --> 01:32:50,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Why does a black child in grade school get put out of class for the same type of force play, or youthful obstinance, or mild assertiveness that gets his white classmate a simple, Johnny, behave yourself.

540
01:33:07,739 --> 01:33:25,569
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't know how it feels to see the smiling faces of rednecks and Klansmen, Klanswomen and Klanskids standing hundreds deep in a field where the charred body of a black boy is dangling from a noose on the bow of an ancient oak tree.

541
01:33:26,789 --> 01:33:34,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps the Jew does when he sees the image of naked bodies piled in the rigor of death at Auschwitz or Dachau.

542
01:33:35,731 --> 01:33:46,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps the native Apache or Cherokee does when she sees the grainy illustrations of the forced death marches of her ancestors across the Trail of Tears.

543
01:33:48,719 --> 01:34:00,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps the Japanese immigrant does when he remembers the barbed wire perimeters and horse stables converted to living quarters for the forced internment of potential enemy agents.

544
01:34:01,848 --> 01:34:02,188
[SPEAKER_10]: But you,

545
01:34:03,345 --> 01:34:18,137
[SPEAKER_10]: heir to Anglo-Euro spoils of colonial conquest and systemic privilege do not have radar for this, do not have a frame of reference for this, do not have an appreciation of this.

546
01:34:18,997 --> 01:34:30,366
[SPEAKER_10]: You do not have the emotional intelligence for these little hurts of the heart, bee stings to the brain, sucker punches to the soul, spilled milk of the spirit.

547
01:34:31,587 --> 01:34:32,048
[SPEAKER_10]: You say,

548
01:34:33,536 --> 01:34:38,801
[SPEAKER_10]: It's nothing we think you should cry over, even as you watch us sometimes die over.

549
01:34:39,221 --> 01:34:55,416
[SPEAKER_10]: These microaggressions, these race-fueled transgressions, this constant procession of slings and arrows that seldom miss the target when the bullseye is black like me.

550
01:35:06,488 --> 01:35:10,352
[SPEAKER_10]: So people ask sometimes, why are you so angry?

551
01:35:11,693 --> 01:35:16,317
[SPEAKER_10]: And I try to tell them I'm a loving and compassionate person.

552
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:17,438
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a man of faith.

553
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:20,161
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not angry.

554
01:35:20,781 --> 01:35:21,642
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm resolute.

555
01:35:22,423 --> 01:35:25,586
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's important that we tell the truth and shame the devil.

556
01:35:26,426 --> 01:35:27,868
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's important that

557
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:40,349
[SPEAKER_10]: We talk about the things that are issues between us because if we can't bridge the gulfs, and there are many between us, we're in for a long and bumpy ride.

558
01:35:41,390 --> 01:35:46,214
[SPEAKER_10]: But the neighborhood that I grew up in, West Medford, has changed an awful lot.

559
01:35:46,655 --> 01:35:52,640
[SPEAKER_10]: It was at one time a very nuclear African-American neighborhood that

560
01:35:53,803 --> 01:35:57,464
[SPEAKER_10]: took up about eight or 10 streets, right around where we are now.

561
01:35:58,704 --> 01:35:59,645
[SPEAKER_10]: But things are changing.

562
01:35:59,885 --> 01:36:01,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Part of the change is actually going up.

563
01:36:01,685 --> 01:36:03,526
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you can see it right beside us.

564
01:36:04,086 --> 01:36:11,928
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a multi-unit dwelling in front of a house that, in all honesty, we used to own, but that's another story for another day.

565
01:36:13,188 --> 01:36:18,250
[SPEAKER_10]: But I wanna play, we wanna play a little tune for you called Gentrified.

566
01:36:26,001 --> 01:36:26,202
you

567
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:37,171
[SPEAKER_10]: They talk about renovating, reimagining, and rehabilitating.

568
01:36:37,692 --> 01:36:41,573
[SPEAKER_10]: They rave about new visions, new horizons, and new perspectives.

569
01:36:42,073 --> 01:36:45,434
[SPEAKER_10]: They revel in bistros, boutiques, and boulangeries.

570
01:36:45,494 --> 01:36:47,935
[SPEAKER_10]: They fairly skip to the subway stations.

571
01:36:48,055 --> 01:36:49,776
[SPEAKER_10]: They bike on the painted pathways.

572
01:36:50,096 --> 01:36:52,237
[SPEAKER_10]: They Uber and Lyft religiously.

573
01:36:52,517 --> 01:36:55,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything's on trend and on point and au pair.

574
01:36:57,059 --> 01:37:06,541
[SPEAKER_10]: They've codified the way they speak about what used to be urban blight, eyesores, drug dens, crack houses, tenements, and slums, the ghetto.

575
01:37:07,201 --> 01:37:17,323
[SPEAKER_10]: They've modified the way they speak about what we now see, makeovers, investment properties, B&Bs, brownstones, townhouses, condos, and co-ops.

576
01:37:18,303 --> 01:37:26,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything's vintage, bohemian, artsy, and retro, with creative green spaces and lofted open places.

577
01:37:28,183 --> 01:37:41,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Speculators bought lower than low, patiently waiting for the change, waiting for the junkies to move on, waiting for the squatters to give up, waiting for the blacks and the browns and the tans to fade.

578
01:37:44,005 --> 01:37:46,207
[SPEAKER_10]: They waited for the graffiti to erode.

579
01:37:46,988 --> 01:37:49,191
[SPEAKER_10]: They waited for the chain link to corrode.

580
01:37:49,671 --> 01:37:51,854
[SPEAKER_10]: They waited for the family to implode.

581
01:37:51,894 --> 01:37:54,617
[SPEAKER_10]: They waited for the prices to explode.

582
01:37:55,778 --> 01:37:57,860
[SPEAKER_10]: They waited, and they calculated.

583
01:37:58,701 --> 01:38:00,443
[SPEAKER_10]: They waited as folks capitulated.

584
01:38:01,083 --> 01:38:03,306
[SPEAKER_10]: They waited as folks evacuated.

585
01:38:03,867 --> 01:38:05,889
[SPEAKER_10]: They waited as folks migrated.

586
01:38:10,987 --> 01:38:13,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Then the realtors came and dispelled white folks' fears.

587
01:38:14,393 --> 01:38:16,718
[SPEAKER_10]: The architects came and re-engineered.

588
01:38:17,098 --> 01:38:19,683
[SPEAKER_10]: The designers came and changed the veneers.

589
01:38:20,084 --> 01:38:22,929
[SPEAKER_10]: The builders came and the new folk cheered.

590
01:38:24,028 --> 01:38:48,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Now they've moved closer to work in the city, to quartz countertops that made kitchens pretty, to chowder schools, nannies, and drivers, and bite frames made with carbon fibers, to Starbucks lattes and artisanal breads, and articulated sleep number beds, to million dollar urban show places, and fewer and fewer black and brown faces.

591
01:38:50,629 --> 01:38:52,930
[SPEAKER_10]: They showed us their heels when they took the white flight.

592
01:38:53,370 --> 01:38:55,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Then they crept back in in the dead of night.

593
01:38:56,030 --> 01:38:59,411
[SPEAKER_10]: With fat bank accounts, they were IPO wealthy.

594
01:38:59,791 --> 01:39:03,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Their move to this place was measured and stealthy.

595
01:39:04,953 --> 01:39:07,493
[SPEAKER_10]: All of the potholes now smoothly paved over.

596
01:39:08,033 --> 01:39:10,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Brown folks got schooled like a Curry crossover.

597
01:39:11,354 --> 01:39:13,815
[SPEAKER_10]: White folks doing a long-term sleepover.

598
01:39:14,175 --> 01:39:17,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Exclusive, obtrusive, extreme home makeover.

599
01:39:19,389 --> 01:39:21,832
[SPEAKER_10]: full of sugar, they took all the clover.

600
01:39:25,737 --> 01:39:30,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Changing the context of neighborhood with subway tile and exotic wood.

601
01:39:30,783 --> 01:39:33,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Harlem, Detroit, and Chicago's South Side.

602
01:39:34,207 --> 01:39:36,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Boston's South End surely gentrified.

603
01:39:37,731 --> 01:39:38,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Empty the church.

604
01:39:39,545 --> 01:39:43,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Emptied the steeple, now it's a spot for the chai-drinking people.

605
01:39:43,849 --> 01:39:48,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Took down the poles and the basketball hoops, now it's a park for the dog-walking troops.

606
01:39:49,233 --> 01:39:53,997
[SPEAKER_10]: No more rec and community center, but a new parking lot for the monthly renters.

607
01:39:59,175 --> 01:40:02,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Some folks hang on, but the die is cast.

608
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:05,583
[SPEAKER_10]: The fire consumes and the torch is passed.

609
01:40:06,204 --> 01:40:12,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Invisible lines are drawn again, and the folks can't buy when the banks won't lend.

610
01:40:13,737 --> 01:40:18,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Some folks keep their roots in the ground, but the waiting game is deep and profound.

611
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:24,280
[SPEAKER_10]: They tour the streets noting history, yet what they want is no mystery.

612
01:40:24,921 --> 01:40:35,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Holland, Detroit, and Chicago's South Side, a reoccupation is being applied to model cities that trickle down, no longer suited to black and brown.

613
01:40:37,062 --> 01:40:48,017
[SPEAKER_10]: The urban sprawl that used to be the only homes that we got to see is now the place for growing infusion, is now the space that the gentry is choosing.

614
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:26,849
[SPEAKER_10]: low-rise projects slowly yield to equity building leases sealed to folks who came from far afield who won the fight when the poor folk appealed to lawyers and doctors and high-tech heroes with Trust Fund One and Hedge Fund Zero.

615
01:41:28,470 --> 01:41:38,135
[SPEAKER_10]: No preserving community, no real thought of legacy, a small flag here, a street sign there, nothing that bronzes the atmosphere.

616
01:41:39,381 --> 01:41:44,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Oakland, Brooklyn, and New Orleans, all made targets by whites with means.

617
01:41:45,263 --> 01:41:50,886
[SPEAKER_10]: Even in venerable chocolate cities, the news in the district inspires some pity.

618
01:42:12,307 --> 01:42:16,469
[SPEAKER_10]: killing the concept of neighborhood in ways they've never understood.

619
01:42:16,489 --> 01:42:26,234
[SPEAKER_10]: And now we witness the slow, painful slide as the village we built becomes gentrified.

620
01:42:38,163 --> 01:42:40,384
[SPEAKER_10]: My mother used to say, life is hard, but fair.

621
01:42:40,424 --> 01:42:42,464
[SPEAKER_10]: You had a good home, but you didn't stay there.

622
01:42:44,045 --> 01:42:52,027
[SPEAKER_10]: So I want to bring back our friend, our muse, Linda Moreau, and she's going to join me for a tune we call Legacy.

623
01:43:02,711 --> 01:43:03,611
[SPEAKER_10]: How you folks holding up?

624
01:43:04,838 --> 01:43:05,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Good, good, good.

625
01:43:05,819 --> 01:43:06,740
[SPEAKER_10]: You enjoying yourselves?

626
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:07,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

627
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:08,241
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, all right.

628
01:43:08,281 --> 01:43:12,365
[SPEAKER_10]: When we do this the next time, we've got to definitely make sure that we do it in warmer weather.

629
01:43:17,149 --> 01:43:23,454
[SPEAKER_10]: And the forecast tomorrow suggests rain, suggested very dramatically.

630
01:43:23,534 --> 01:43:28,579
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are assuming that we will be inside tomorrow as opposed to outside.

631
01:43:30,531 --> 01:43:36,242
[SPEAKER_10]: So hopefully if you come back tomorrow, you won't have to suffer through the chill.

632
01:43:38,587 --> 01:43:39,028
[SPEAKER_10]: You good to go?

633
01:44:16,642 --> 01:44:18,923
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not for you to tell your own story.

634
01:44:19,484 --> 01:44:21,285
[SPEAKER_10]: That is the burden of your children.

635
01:44:21,926 --> 01:44:26,229
[SPEAKER_10]: They must shoulder this yoke with love and loyalty.

636
01:44:27,570 --> 01:44:33,574
[SPEAKER_10]: And yet, you have not gathered them up and bid them sit before the campfires of their elders.

637
01:44:34,531 --> 01:44:40,953
[SPEAKER_10]: You have not seasoned their meals with the spice of their identity and the savor of their name.

638
01:44:42,073 --> 01:44:45,874
[SPEAKER_10]: How will they learn to walk the walk and talk the talk?

639
01:44:46,454 --> 01:44:50,775
[SPEAKER_10]: How will they learn to tell your story even as they live out their own?

640
01:44:52,036 --> 01:45:01,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Sons and daughters and heirs, if you didn't smell the burning ash or feel the warmth of the flame on your neck, you don't know.

641
01:45:02,529 --> 01:45:10,074
[SPEAKER_10]: If you didn't revel in the growl of the griot's earthly reply or the trill of the mockingbird's cry, you don't know.

642
01:45:11,235 --> 01:45:20,402
[SPEAKER_10]: If mama was too tired and daddy too long gone to carry the wood, light the spark, and stoke the flames, you don't know.

643
01:45:22,363 --> 01:45:28,488
[SPEAKER_10]: And until the lion cub knows how to tell the pride story, the hunters will always tell them first.

644
01:45:40,834 --> 01:45:44,756
[SPEAKER_10]: The good book says, train up the child in the way they should go.

645
01:45:44,776 --> 01:45:57,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Will we let them depart from the community of faith and the city on a hill without the master's touch, without the oil of his anointing and his full measure of grace?

646
01:45:58,936 --> 01:46:13,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Will we not show them Anansi's clever ways, Popo and Fafina's journey, Muparo's beautiful daughters, the people who could fly, the wonders of Wakanda, and Song Kololo's news hacky.

647
01:46:15,270 --> 01:46:19,673
[SPEAKER_10]: The prophet says he will encourage fathers and their children to return.

648
01:46:19,953 --> 01:46:31,122
[SPEAKER_10]: But how will they know the way home if no map charts the seas, measures the roads, cites the peaks and valleys, and names each forest despite the thickening stream?

649
01:46:33,066 --> 01:46:36,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Will the burden of the elder stories be too heavy for the children?

650
01:46:36,829 --> 01:46:38,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Will they care to carry?

651
01:46:38,611 --> 01:46:40,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Will they dare to tarry?

652
01:46:41,413 --> 01:46:43,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Will they linger at the foot of the griot?

653
01:46:43,334 --> 01:46:46,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Will they hunger for the wisdom of the sage?

654
01:46:47,318 --> 01:46:59,307
[SPEAKER_10]: We must put them on the page, where hard work earns the man his wage, where power is measured by God's own gauge, where miracles scarf at the wand of a maid.

655
01:47:02,335 --> 01:47:13,124
[SPEAKER_10]: We must share with them the truth that is loyal and fierce like Naomi and Ruth, that doesn't wait for the confessional boot, that has the bite of the panther's tooth.

656
01:47:20,529 --> 01:47:29,336
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a gift of legacy, where a glorious past sets the captives free, and a candle's light beckons liberty.

657
01:47:30,459 --> 01:47:33,100
[SPEAKER_10]: sons and daughters and heir.

658
01:47:34,241 --> 01:47:43,566
[SPEAKER_10]: I bid you sit before the campfires of your elders, hear their stories, gather up their stones, and build up your strength.

659
01:47:44,686 --> 01:47:59,654
[SPEAKER_10]: They will show you Anansi's club away, Popo and Fafina's journey, Mufaro's beautiful daughters, the people who could fly, the wonders of Wakanda, and Sangololo's Tutaki.

660
01:48:02,185 --> 01:48:04,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Soon you will be the herald.

661
01:48:04,767 --> 01:48:07,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Write these things down on the tablets of your spirit.

662
01:48:08,050 --> 01:48:10,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Let them put a running in your feet.

663
01:48:14,335 --> 01:48:15,777
[SPEAKER_10]: With each quickening step,

664
01:48:16,658 --> 01:48:20,962
[SPEAKER_10]: You repel the arrows of the hunter with the shield of abiding faith.

665
01:48:21,223 --> 01:48:25,086
[SPEAKER_10]: You capture the flags of your enemies and gather up their spoils.

666
01:48:25,607 --> 01:48:32,334
[SPEAKER_10]: You remain the lions of your pride and your children, your tales will always be your children's friends.

667
01:48:42,585 --> 01:49:03,796
[SPEAKER_10]: You will never abandon the community of faith, though you build a thousand cities on a hill, drawing wondrous strength from the master's touch, as the oil of his anointing fills your clay jars with his grace.

668
01:49:05,918 --> 01:49:06,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Linda Morales.

669
01:49:16,095 --> 01:49:29,819
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're in what has been traditionally called The Ville, probably short for village, but I'm not 100% sure of that.

670
01:49:31,419 --> 01:49:35,760
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's also called The Hood, short for The Neighborhood.

671
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:38,921
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're gonna do a piece called Neighborhood.

672
01:50:03,123 --> 01:50:12,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Neighborhood is a place where mothers buy extra food for kids that aren't even their own, on the premise that they will eventually show up hungry.

673
01:50:13,948 --> 01:50:26,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Neighborhood is grandmas and grandpas that raise their children's children long after they've raised their own, lovingly, carefully, happily, long after they've raised their own.

674
01:50:28,055 --> 01:50:36,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Neighborhood is that corner bodega where the nice Spanish man always gave you 10 cents worth of penny candy when all you ever had was a nickel.

675
01:50:38,725 --> 01:50:45,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Neighborhood is the homeowner that doesn't look down his nose at the frazzled rental with the Section 8 and a few kids without a daddy.

676
01:50:47,819 --> 01:50:51,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Neighborhood is the block party that everyone comes to.

677
01:50:52,022 --> 01:50:53,583
[SPEAKER_10]: And nobody calls the cops.

678
01:50:54,283 --> 01:50:57,445
[SPEAKER_10]: No drugs, no guns, no drama.

679
01:50:58,245 --> 01:51:07,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Cooling the gang, earth, wind, and fire, Rick James, Tina Marie, and Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan.

680
01:51:08,621 --> 01:51:13,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Neighborhood knows everybody's name but isn't collecting big data on anyone.

681
01:51:13,906 --> 01:51:21,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Keeps tabs on strangers but doesn't discriminate based on color or caste or custom.

682
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:33,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Neighborhood keeps pies and cookies ready to welcome newcomers, and always has something to invite folk to, and always has something good to eat when you get there.

683
01:51:34,745 --> 01:51:47,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Neighborhood loves all of its children, watches out for all of the babies, disciplines fairly, drops dimes carefully, daps up consistently, and marches for justice dutifully.

684
01:51:48,697 --> 01:51:56,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Neighborhood cares for its sick with homemade chicken soup, ginger tea, flowers, cards, and pastoral visits.

685
01:51:57,141 --> 01:52:00,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Never lets you feel lonely, never leaves you alone.

686
01:52:01,823 --> 01:52:13,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Neighborhood laments the loss of its kings and queens reverently, even while it celebrates their lives jubilantly and recollects their ways permanently.

687
01:52:14,810 --> 01:52:27,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Neighborhood has well-worn welcome mats and four-way stop signs, a community gathering place as the hub of the wheels, and nicknames like The Port, The Coast, and The Ville.

688
01:52:29,133 --> 01:52:38,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Neighborhood says yes more than it says no, chooses love over hate, never cries when it could laugh, and never laughs when it should cry.

689
01:52:40,089 --> 01:52:52,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Neighborhood understands the importance of respect, covers everyone with an umbrella, shovels snow for its elders, pronounces your name right, and picks up the poop left by its dog.

690
01:52:52,875 --> 01:52:55,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Small, medium, and large.

691
01:52:57,697 --> 01:53:04,920
[SPEAKER_10]: And no matter where you go, neighborhood is always the place you call home.

692
01:53:15,692 --> 01:53:21,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Once again, John Dalton on drums, Greg Toro on bass, Jonathan Fagan on the keys.

693
01:53:23,197 --> 01:53:36,566
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, that intersection of jazz and social justice, I'm gonna take it back a little bit and forward at the same time with a piece we call Riding Up Front.

694
01:53:57,281 --> 01:54:20,510
[SPEAKER_10]: can't do it don't even ask me black it's a bus but i ain't riding in the back young bloods ain't got no idea of how long we had to ride in the red in the lazy south american apothecary the law of the land was stratified seats up front unoccupied yet a pregnant brown girl can sit and ride

695
01:54:21,250 --> 01:54:23,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Elders, toddlers, just didn't matter.

696
01:54:23,793 --> 01:54:26,697
[SPEAKER_10]: And don't let them hear no race talk or chatter.

697
01:54:26,857 --> 01:54:29,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Redneck drivers would put us out.

698
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:31,282
[SPEAKER_10]: But y'all don't know what I'm talking about.

699
01:54:32,631 --> 01:54:39,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Then along came courageous Rosa Parks, tired and weary, but full of sparks.

700
01:54:40,117 --> 01:54:45,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Took a seat in the first few rows, seeking not chaos, but simple repose.

701
01:54:46,263 --> 01:54:48,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Think them whites heard what she was saying?

702
01:54:48,565 --> 01:54:51,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Hell no, and them crackers for sure wasn't playing.

703
01:54:51,627 --> 01:54:57,913
[SPEAKER_10]: She held up Miss Rosa without dignity, commending her acts to our history.

704
01:55:00,845 --> 01:55:05,787
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't have no gratitude, no pride in self, just attitude.

705
01:55:06,327 --> 01:55:08,547
[SPEAKER_10]: You make your way to the back of the bus.

706
01:55:08,967 --> 01:55:11,628
[SPEAKER_10]: You drink and smoke and holler and cuss.

707
01:55:12,168 --> 01:55:14,229
[SPEAKER_10]: You say it's your prerogative.

708
01:55:14,689 --> 01:55:16,830
[SPEAKER_10]: You say it's just the way you live.

709
01:55:17,510 --> 01:55:18,790
[SPEAKER_10]: You just don't get it.

710
01:55:19,411 --> 01:55:20,771
[SPEAKER_10]: You just don't care.

711
01:55:21,371 --> 01:55:23,432
[SPEAKER_10]: So cavalier, so unaware.

712
01:55:25,535 --> 01:55:26,636
[SPEAKER_10]: But I can't do it.

713
01:55:27,036 --> 01:55:28,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't even ask me, black.

714
01:55:28,797 --> 01:55:29,638
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a bust.

715
01:55:29,718 --> 01:55:31,819
[SPEAKER_10]: But I ain't riding in the back.

716
01:55:32,259 --> 01:55:33,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Three seats up front.

717
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:35,101
[SPEAKER_10]: That's for me.

718
01:55:35,721 --> 01:55:38,503
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm digging Miss Rose's legacy.

719
01:55:39,764 --> 01:55:44,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Here it is.

720
01:55:53,272 --> 01:55:53,612
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

721
01:55:54,485 --> 01:55:56,346
[SPEAKER_10]: We are getting to the good part.

722
01:55:58,628 --> 01:56:12,419
[SPEAKER_10]: So as I said earlier, in the jazz canon, there are these signature tunes that if you know jazz, you can be anywhere and hear three or four notes and you can name that tune.

723
01:56:12,459 --> 01:56:19,264
[SPEAKER_10]: This is one of those tunes written, composed, and played by the legendary John Coltrane.

724
01:56:22,654 --> 01:56:23,674
[SPEAKER_10]: was called Naima.

725
01:56:24,135 --> 01:56:26,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Our take on it is called Reprise for Naima.

726
01:56:32,118 --> 01:56:35,139
[SPEAKER_10]: He would blow this note in the midnight air.

727
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:39,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Aloft in the ether, it floats out there.

728
01:56:40,042 --> 01:56:44,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Staccato cadence sets a mood of bluesy lyrical attitude.

729
01:56:45,791 --> 01:56:54,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Improvisational mystery like Monk's piano epistrophe, or Miles' tone poem in a silent way, and Flanagan's peace at the end of the day.

730
01:56:55,797 --> 01:57:04,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Syncopated and sharp, bright tone, a countdown to stardust, a twilight zone, like a blue train running against the night, setting the pace then out of sight.

731
01:57:06,075 --> 01:57:08,537
[SPEAKER_10]: With Hartman crooning of bags-on vibes.

732
01:57:08,917 --> 01:57:11,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Trios, duets, quartets, and tribes.

733
01:57:12,099 --> 01:57:14,721
[SPEAKER_10]: The blues, the ballads, the avant-garde.

734
01:57:15,202 --> 01:57:18,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Incredibly gorgeous, impossibly hard.

735
01:57:19,985 --> 01:57:22,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Giant steps move us miles ahead.

736
01:57:22,307 --> 01:57:24,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Cooking up bop for Harlem street cred.

737
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:26,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Melodies hand to the harmony wed.

738
01:57:26,690 --> 01:57:28,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Pianos lullaby fresh in the bed.

739
01:57:28,852 --> 01:57:30,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Rhythm rocks with a drum of lead.

740
01:57:30,773 --> 01:57:32,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Rhythm rolls with a bass man's fed.

741
01:57:33,135 --> 01:57:33,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Rhythm burlesque.

742
01:57:35,623 --> 01:57:37,564
[SPEAKER_10]: them heard what the master said.

743
01:57:39,584 --> 01:57:41,685
[SPEAKER_10]: How could he make the bitter taste sweeter?

744
01:57:42,165 --> 01:57:44,106
[SPEAKER_10]: How could a tortured mind delete her?

745
01:57:44,146 --> 01:57:46,407
[SPEAKER_10]: How could the mellowed scotch be neater?

746
01:57:46,807 --> 01:58:00,392
[SPEAKER_10]: How could the smoke from each cigarette create blue notes that cast a net, create blue beads of cascading sweat, create blue haze that compounds regret, create blue nights that we can't forget?

747
01:58:02,369 --> 01:58:14,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Coltrane's notes are a crystal scale, a velvet scream in the urban travail, the heavenly riff of a love supreme, the pungent whip of his lover's theme.

748
01:58:16,120 --> 01:58:27,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Coltrane's knots are a cozy romance, the breezy bounce of a bop and a dance, the languid lilt of stray's lush life, the cadence cut by the artist's knife.

749
01:58:28,597 --> 01:58:40,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Coltrane's notes are a standard refine, like gold in a pan or gemstones mine, the sparkling glow of a hopeful dream, hot black coffee with a hint of cream.

750
01:58:41,864 --> 01:58:53,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Coltrane's notes are Naima's reprise, like madness that brings a man to his knees, or sadness that comes when lovers part, the gladness removed from the balladeer's heart.

751
01:58:59,403 --> 01:59:01,185
[SPEAKER_10]: A tight arrangement cuts the gloom.

752
01:59:01,745 --> 01:59:03,707
[SPEAKER_10]: The melody sends that love's in bloom.

753
01:59:04,068 --> 01:59:05,989
[SPEAKER_10]: The harmony spirit engulfs the room.

754
01:59:06,290 --> 01:59:08,552
[SPEAKER_10]: The bride says yes to her lyrical broom.

755
01:59:08,892 --> 01:59:11,054
[SPEAKER_10]: The groove and the beat then jumps the broom.

756
01:59:11,395 --> 01:59:15,539
[SPEAKER_10]: The kick drum resounds with a sonic boom.

757
01:59:16,620 --> 01:59:19,863
[SPEAKER_10]: As genius is birthed in a soul-filled room.

758
01:59:27,799 --> 01:59:31,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Musical mythology mocks a twisted path the hero walks.

759
01:59:32,423 --> 01:59:34,605
[SPEAKER_10]: With sealed and sword the hero stalks.

760
01:59:34,945 --> 01:59:36,947
[SPEAKER_10]: The tempest shakes her twisted locks.

761
01:59:37,287 --> 01:59:39,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Medusa snakes his vision shocks.

762
01:59:39,529 --> 01:59:41,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Holds up the mirror to stony blocks.

763
01:59:41,530 --> 01:59:43,532
[SPEAKER_10]: The harp and the horn melt icy rocks.

764
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:46,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Serpents retreat and symphony talks.

765
01:59:46,775 --> 01:59:48,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Love's door opens as lyric.

766
01:59:55,556 --> 01:59:55,998
Okay.

767
02:00:44,773 --> 02:00:55,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Coltrane's notes are a rollercoaster, a hallelujah and a paternoster, the glorious jolt of the maestro's hand, the saxophone titan is in command.

768
02:00:56,138 --> 02:01:05,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Coltrane's notes are a crazy rhythm, the squawk of chords and playful schism, the frenetic pace of Mr. PC, the coolest round midnight will ever be.

769
02:01:07,338 --> 02:01:19,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Coltrane's notes are genius refined, like gold in a pan or gemstones mined, the sparkling glow of a hopeful dream, hot black coffee with a hint of cream.

770
02:01:20,682 --> 02:01:31,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Coltrane's notes are Naima's reprieve, like madness that brings a man to his knees, or sadness that comes when lovers part.

771
02:01:31,605 --> 02:01:36,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Then, gladness revived by the balladeer's heart.

772
02:01:47,397 --> 02:01:48,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, yes, yes.

773
02:01:49,919 --> 02:01:50,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, yes, yes.

774
02:01:50,719 --> 02:01:52,040
[SPEAKER_10]: See, these cats can play.

775
02:01:52,120 --> 02:01:54,021
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's, you know, that's how that goes.

776
02:01:54,161 --> 02:01:54,541
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

777
02:01:55,942 --> 02:01:58,003
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to bring Linda back up.

778
02:01:58,023 --> 02:02:00,144
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to do a piece called Kitchen Table Poem.

779
02:02:05,768 --> 02:02:06,128
Okay.

780
02:02:07,609 --> 02:02:07,929
[SPEAKER_08]: All righty.

781
02:02:15,049 --> 02:02:15,429
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

782
02:02:17,631 --> 02:02:17,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Good?

783
02:02:19,353 --> 02:02:19,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye-bye.

784
02:02:22,275 --> 02:02:23,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody ever wants to leave.

785
02:02:25,038 --> 02:02:30,222
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like the blueberry stains on mama's apron, settled and satisfied.

786
02:02:30,962 --> 02:02:32,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Good food has been eaten.

787
02:02:33,525 --> 02:02:40,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Fresh corn and collard greens, fried chicken and potato salad, bellies are fat and full.

788
02:02:41,251 --> 02:02:42,692
[SPEAKER_10]: This is that room.

789
02:02:46,926 --> 02:02:47,807
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you serious right now?

790
02:02:48,708 --> 02:02:49,630
[SPEAKER_10]: It's real talk.

791
02:02:50,250 --> 02:02:51,151
[SPEAKER_10]: We're real people.

792
02:02:51,572 --> 02:02:52,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Family.

793
02:02:52,473 --> 02:02:53,434
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I'm saying?

794
02:02:53,454 --> 02:02:54,856
[SPEAKER_10]: We're family.

795
02:02:56,318 --> 02:02:58,981
[SPEAKER_10]: You can smell the love long before the doors open.

796
02:02:59,021 --> 02:03:04,228
[SPEAKER_10]: You know there's going to be pecan pie and the sweet tea will be ice cold.

797
02:03:05,828 --> 02:03:08,449
[SPEAKER_10]: Southern folk will slip out of their northerness.

798
02:03:08,809 --> 02:03:13,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Accents will thicken and the country shade will feel closer than the city sun.

799
02:03:14,752 --> 02:03:18,254
[SPEAKER_10]: And they'll stay at that table long after the crumbs are cleared.

800
02:03:18,774 --> 02:03:20,395
[SPEAKER_10]: The dishes will be all washed.

801
02:03:20,435 --> 02:03:24,737
[SPEAKER_10]: The food will be put away or packed in Tupperware and Ziploc bags.

802
02:03:25,517 --> 02:03:28,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone will have a doggie bag and a story to tell.

803
02:03:29,443 --> 02:03:35,787
[SPEAKER_10]: The men will be playing bids, slapping down some dominoes, sipping on a little something something, and talking big trash.

804
02:03:36,208 --> 02:03:40,571
[SPEAKER_10]: The smiles will be broad and the laughter will be contagious.

805
02:03:42,572 --> 02:03:44,914
[SPEAKER_10]: The women will be fanning and fussing.

806
02:03:50,171 --> 02:03:51,992
[SPEAKER_07]: That ain't the dress for her, okay?

807
02:03:52,172 --> 02:03:54,514
[SPEAKER_07]: That ain't no Sunday saved outfit.

808
02:03:54,934 --> 02:03:57,175
[SPEAKER_07]: That ain't for Saturday night sinning.

809
02:03:57,776 --> 02:03:58,656
[SPEAKER_07]: You know I'm right.

810
02:03:58,796 --> 02:04:00,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Girl, you know I'm right.

811
02:04:00,958 --> 02:04:02,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody ever wants to leave.

812
02:04:03,239 --> 02:04:06,201
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like black Jesus's eyes on that old print.

813
02:04:06,701 --> 02:04:07,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Loving and insistent.

814
02:04:08,542 --> 02:04:10,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Soul food has been shared.

815
02:04:10,664 --> 02:04:15,547
[SPEAKER_10]: My Jean prayed down heaven and the babies sang their song.

816
02:04:16,427 --> 02:04:19,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone's tickled and tranquil.

817
02:04:21,516 --> 02:04:23,197
[SPEAKER_10]: This is that room.

818
02:04:24,558 --> 02:04:25,959
[SPEAKER_10]: I really miss pap.

819
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:28,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Mom's holding her own.

820
02:04:28,862 --> 02:04:30,783
[SPEAKER_10]: And baby boy's cancer's in remission.

821
02:04:31,564 --> 02:04:35,947
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you coming back to church, it's real talk.

822
02:04:36,147 --> 02:04:37,848
[SPEAKER_10]: We're real people.

823
02:04:38,129 --> 02:04:38,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Family.

824
02:04:39,129 --> 02:04:40,050
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I'm saying?

825
02:04:40,831 --> 02:04:42,612
[SPEAKER_12]: We're family.

826
02:04:44,774 --> 02:04:45,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Family.

827
02:04:54,943 --> 02:04:55,743
[SPEAKER_10]: You better do that.

828
02:04:57,824 --> 02:04:59,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Linda Morose, thank you so much.

829
02:05:00,986 --> 02:05:07,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so we're gonna finish up with a piece called Beloved Country.

830
02:05:09,289 --> 02:05:17,393
[SPEAKER_10]: And I always say this, you know, to preface this, if you're not, you know, native, native, native, native,

831
02:05:18,642 --> 02:05:24,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, then you and your ancestors or your ancestors came here from someplace else, right?

832
02:05:24,904 --> 02:05:32,667
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is about the folks who came from someplace else and who just want to be in with the in crowd.

833
02:05:33,308 --> 02:05:34,288
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called Beloved Country.

834
02:06:03,959 --> 02:06:05,280
[SPEAKER_10]: I can love this country, too.

835
02:06:06,041 --> 02:06:08,284
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't have to be born on these bonding shores.

836
02:06:08,804 --> 02:06:12,829
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't have to be a son of the Pentacook or Quinnipiac or Mohican.

837
02:06:13,449 --> 02:06:18,975
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't have to have a pilgrim pedigree or be a Connecticut Yankee from King Arthur's Court.

838
02:06:19,256 --> 02:06:24,721
[SPEAKER_10]: I can be the Dahomian, the Pole, or the child of Caribbean suns in Amazon shade.

839
02:06:25,919 --> 02:06:27,261
[SPEAKER_10]: I can love this country too.

840
02:06:27,882 --> 02:06:32,187
[SPEAKER_10]: My green card was a welcome ticket to a new life in a new land.

841
02:06:32,748 --> 02:06:36,072
[SPEAKER_10]: My passport was stamped with new hopes and new dreams.

842
02:06:36,112 --> 02:06:41,338
[SPEAKER_10]: My suitcases were packed full of new aspirations and some apprehensions too.

843
02:06:42,671 --> 02:06:50,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps I didn't see the harbor sign that said, give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuge of your teeming shore.

844
02:06:51,175 --> 02:06:53,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me.

845
02:06:53,776 --> 02:06:56,157
[SPEAKER_10]: I lift my lamp beside the golden door.

846
02:06:56,897 --> 02:07:02,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps I didn't see the gleaming city on a hill that couldn't be hid, and my soul responded.

847
02:07:04,562 --> 02:07:06,323
[SPEAKER_10]: I can love this country, too.

848
02:07:06,743 --> 02:07:09,244
[SPEAKER_10]: I can love its rocky mountains and its rolling meadows.

849
02:07:09,784 --> 02:07:12,765
[SPEAKER_10]: I can love its gospel songs and its crazy rhythms.

850
02:07:13,505 --> 02:07:17,247
[SPEAKER_10]: I can love its asphalt highways and its born-to-run bars.

851
02:07:18,287 --> 02:07:21,328
[SPEAKER_10]: I can love its teeming ghetto and its urban sprawl.

852
02:07:22,028 --> 02:07:26,450
[SPEAKER_10]: I can love its old fires, new minarets, and golden menorahs.

853
02:07:58,246 --> 02:08:00,006
[SPEAKER_10]: But can America love me too?

854
02:08:00,927 --> 02:08:03,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Can she love my curry spices, roti, and oxtails?

855
02:08:04,887 --> 02:08:07,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Can she love my hijab and henna tattoos?

856
02:08:08,048 --> 02:08:11,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Can she love my Hajj, my Mecca, my Medina?

857
02:08:11,749 --> 02:08:14,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Can she love my Cinco de Mayo, my Dia de los Muertos?

858
02:08:14,930 --> 02:08:18,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Can she love my kente cloth, dreads, twists, and locks?

859
02:08:18,890 --> 02:08:26,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Can she love the skin I'm in, be it ebony, ivory, dulce de leche, or cafe au lait?

860
02:08:28,260 --> 02:08:30,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Can she love me by name?

861
02:08:30,681 --> 02:08:40,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Shekinah Glory, Muhammad bin Saeed, Anastasia Kozoff, Cleophis Dorcio, Claudia Gonzalez, can she love me by name?

862
02:08:42,525 --> 02:08:51,349
[SPEAKER_10]: And what if I am among those huddled masses and that wretched refuge or that homeless, tempest-tossed, will she continue to lift her lamp?

863
02:08:52,731 --> 02:09:07,038
[SPEAKER_10]: or do war and rumors of war, IEDs, sleeper cells, and faith distortions make me a pariah to be eliminated, a scourge to be annihilated, and a plague to be exterminated.

864
02:09:08,338 --> 02:09:09,119
[SPEAKER_10]: I come in peace.

865
02:09:16,676 --> 02:09:17,736
[SPEAKER_10]: I love this country, too.

866
02:09:18,677 --> 02:09:20,317
[SPEAKER_10]: I love its boundless opportunity.

867
02:09:20,937 --> 02:09:22,658
[SPEAKER_10]: I love its generosity of spirit.

868
02:09:22,698 --> 02:09:24,559
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the audacity of its hope.

869
02:09:25,019 --> 02:09:27,860
[SPEAKER_10]: I love its rolling meadows and its joyful songs.

870
02:09:28,440 --> 02:09:31,681
