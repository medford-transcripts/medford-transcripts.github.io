31
00:01:19,727 --> 00:01:21,547
[SPEAKER_09]: First up on the agenda is an introduction.

32
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:24,688
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll start with an affordable housing trust fund overview.

33
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:26,068
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to turn it over to Aditi.

34
00:01:26,741 --> 00:01:30,523
[SPEAKER_09]: to give a short presentation about the trust and Medford's housing data.

35
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:31,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

36
00:01:31,663 --> 00:01:32,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mia.

37
00:01:35,525 --> 00:01:38,526
[SPEAKER_09]: And just maybe to let everyone know your title.

38
00:01:38,826 --> 00:01:39,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

39
00:01:39,706 --> 00:01:40,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, everyone.

40
00:01:41,027 --> 00:01:43,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite excited to have the first meeting.

41
00:01:43,028 --> 00:01:46,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Aditi Mughal, staff planner for housing.

42
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:52,832
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to provide a short presentation on affordable housing trust fund and an overview of Medford's housing data.

43
00:01:55,013 --> 00:01:56,594
[SPEAKER_03]: What is an affordable housing trust?

44
00:01:56,754 --> 00:01:57,895
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a public entity.

45
00:01:58,215 --> 00:02:05,020
[SPEAKER_03]: It acts as a municipal bank that can collect funds and use those funds to create and preserve affordable housing.

46
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:07,922
[SPEAKER_03]: The trust is led by a board of trustees.

47
00:02:10,384 --> 00:02:11,305
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a state law.

48
00:02:14,322 --> 00:02:18,627
[SPEAKER_03]: a statute that allows local municipalities to establish an affordable housing trust.

49
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:21,910
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how Medford was able to establish an affordable housing trust.

50
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:35,283
[SPEAKER_03]: And the statute outlines that the main purpose of the trust is to provide for the creation and preservation of affordable housing in municipalities for the benefit of low and moderate income households and for the funding of community housing.

51
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,511
[SPEAKER_03]: What can the trust do?

52
00:02:38,972 --> 00:02:50,104
[SPEAKER_03]: The trust can provide financial support to develop affordable homes, rehabilitate existing homes to convert them to affordable housing, increase affordable housing development projects.

53
00:02:50,998 --> 00:03:05,161
[SPEAKER_03]: develop affordable housing in city-owned lots, preserve properties faced with expiring affordability restrictions, and then provide rental assistance for low and moderate income households.

54
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:15,323
[SPEAKER_03]: These are some of the activities that the trust can support, but the trust can also act as an affordable housing advocacy and policy development agent.

55
00:03:18,457 --> 00:03:20,418
[SPEAKER_03]: So what does the Board of Trustees look like?

56
00:03:20,798 --> 00:03:23,699
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a seven-member board, which includes the mayor.

57
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:32,661
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one member of the Community Preservation Committee, and the remaining are the residents of the Medford City.

58
00:03:33,762 --> 00:03:38,843
[SPEAKER_03]: The Board of Trustees are appointed by the mayor upon confirmation by the City Council.

59
00:03:38,863 --> 00:03:43,985
[SPEAKER_03]: The trustees have a two-year term, while the initial terms are standard.

60
00:03:45,035 --> 00:03:53,403
[SPEAKER_03]: We require a four-member board of trustees to form a quorum and a quorum will allow the board of trustees to approve any motion.

61
00:03:54,003 --> 00:04:01,230
[SPEAKER_03]: If there are vacancies on the board, for example, if there are two vacancies, then the board would require to have three members to form a quorum.

62
00:04:04,455 --> 00:04:11,180
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are certain powers and rules and regulations that are outlined in the state statute.

63
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,843
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also outlined in our affordable housing ordinance.

64
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:30,795
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of the powers listed here are the board can accept and receive property, purchase and retain real or personal property, sell, exchange and transfer property, execute, acknowledge and deliver deeds and other instruments.

65
00:04:31,515 --> 00:04:37,777
[SPEAKER_03]: The trust can also employ advisors, agents, consultants, even full or part-time staff.

66
00:04:38,418 --> 00:04:48,441
[SPEAKER_03]: So for more information on the 16 powers set forth in the trust statute, please feel free to scan the QR code or it's available on the city's website.

67
00:04:51,503 --> 00:04:56,805
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I mentioned earlier, the trust acts as a municipal bank, so the trust would require to

68
00:04:58,418 --> 00:05:00,180
[SPEAKER_03]: look for funding sources.

69
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Here are some of the examples.

70
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:06,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Community Preservation Act funds is the most popular funding source.

71
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,667
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have inclusionary zoning payments.

72
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:15,333
[SPEAKER_03]: At this point, the City of Medford has inclusionary zoning ordinance, but we don't have inclusionary zoning payments yet.

73
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:29,130
[SPEAKER_03]: There are also possibilities of acquiring private donations, municipalities general fund, tax title sales, payments from special bylaws or ordinance, and self-tavern lease payments.

74
00:05:32,112 --> 00:05:41,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Since the trust works for the benefit of low and moderate income households, HUD outlines what the income categories are for low and moderate income households.

75
00:05:42,495 --> 00:05:49,219
[SPEAKER_03]: The current area median income of Medford is at $149,000 approximately.

76
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:57,444
[SPEAKER_03]: So low and moderate income households income are set at 80% of the area median income or below.

77
00:05:57,784 --> 00:06:01,066
[SPEAKER_03]: So that amounts to roughly around $130,000.

78
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:06,009
[SPEAKER_03]: A very low income household would be at 50% AMI.

79
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:13,971
[SPEAKER_03]: and extremely low income household would be at 30% AMI based on the hard income limits of 2024.

80
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:20,455
[SPEAKER_03]: So what does Medford's household income look like?

81
00:06:21,235 --> 00:06:30,422
[SPEAKER_03]: An owner-occupied median household income is around $115,000, and a renter-occupied income is around $94,000.

82
00:06:31,463 --> 00:06:37,607
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you look at the income graph, there's about 35% of the households that earn $115,000 or more, whereas nearly 65% of

83
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:52,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford's households are at 80% or below, so they comprise of low and moderate income households.

84
00:06:52,580 --> 00:07:02,108
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are 35% of the households that earn $150,000 or more income, but based on HUD area median income, which is set at $149,000 nearly, so that would equate to nearly 65% of

85
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,661
[SPEAKER_03]: the households in Medford are at low or moderate income households.

86
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:19,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

87
00:07:19,421 --> 00:07:20,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I ask a quick question as well?

88
00:07:20,722 --> 00:07:20,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

89
00:07:21,022 --> 00:07:25,923
[SPEAKER_05]: So for the high number, is that also a family of four from the previous slide, I'm assuming?

90
00:07:25,943 --> 00:07:26,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

91
00:07:26,023 --> 00:07:27,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is a family of four.

92
00:07:27,404 --> 00:07:27,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

93
00:07:27,724 --> 00:07:30,444
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but the area median, yeah, that's also a family of four.

94
00:07:30,464 --> 00:07:30,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

95
00:07:30,744 --> 00:07:30,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

96
00:07:31,244 --> 00:07:31,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Gotcha.

97
00:07:31,865 --> 00:07:32,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Great question.

98
00:07:37,346 --> 00:07:39,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on to Medford's housing characteristics,

99
00:07:41,717 --> 00:07:46,740
[SPEAKER_03]: The majority of the household size is a 2% household followed by a 3% household.

100
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,001
[SPEAKER_03]: So we add them together.

101
00:07:49,121 --> 00:07:57,846
[SPEAKER_03]: So 64% of the households consist of one to two person, while we only have 15% of the units that are studio or one bedroom units.

102
00:07:57,946 --> 00:08:02,528
[SPEAKER_03]: So this seems to be a mismatch between the household size and the unit size.

103
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:10,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Similarly, 36% of the households consists of three or more persons, but we only have

104
00:08:11,072 --> 00:08:20,174
[SPEAKER_03]: but we have like 85% of the units that are two or more bedrooms, so which is clearly a mismatch between household size and unit size.

105
00:08:23,455 --> 00:08:38,978
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of housing types, majority of the housing types are townhouses or two to four family units followed by single family, and then we have multifamily units and five or more units per building.

106
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:55,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at the housing occupancy, 95% of Medford's housing are occupied, out of which 53% of them are owner-occupied and 47% are renter-occupied.

107
00:08:58,847 --> 00:09:10,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at housing affordability, 29% of Medford residents are housing cost burdened, which means these households spend more than 30% of their income on housing cost.

108
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:23,681
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look more closely, 16% of them are moderating cost burden, which means that they spend over 30% and less than 50% of their income.

109
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:30,686
[SPEAKER_03]: And those that are severely cost burdened are 13% of the households that spend over 50% of their income.

110
00:09:34,288 --> 00:09:37,010
[SPEAKER_03]: It will affect housing cost burden by income level.

111
00:09:37,664 --> 00:09:43,551
[SPEAKER_03]: nearly 70% of extremely low and very low income households are housing cost burden.

112
00:09:44,473 --> 00:09:55,106
[SPEAKER_03]: This is almost 80% of Medford's total households and nearly 44% of low or moderate income households are also housing cost burden.

113
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:09,019
[SPEAKER_03]: And proportion of cost-burdened households by tenure, it's the renter-occupied households that are cost-burdened more than the owner-occupied households.

114
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:24,461
[SPEAKER_03]: The Massachusetts state has a, the Massachusetts state's housing agency has a subsidized housing inventory which allows municipalities to measure the housing, affordability housing stock.

115
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:41,828
[SPEAKER_03]: So Medford currently has a total of 2,433 affordable units on the state subsidized housing inventory, which accounts to 98% of the affordable housing stock that are rental units, while only 2% of them are ownership.

116
00:10:42,846 --> 00:10:49,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford would require to produce 132 more units to reach the 10% affordability target.

117
00:10:55,472 --> 00:11:07,398
[SPEAKER_03]: As you may be aware, Medford has a housing production plan which outlines various housing strategies that would enable us to produce more housing, specifically affordable housing.

118
00:11:07,558 --> 00:11:10,059
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the strategies was to establish a municipal

119
00:11:10,909 --> 00:11:12,770
[SPEAKER_03]: affordable housing trust, which we have.

120
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:31,301
[SPEAKER_03]: And the action plan has also outlined one of the strategies that the trust could consider, which is examine affordable infill on city-owned lands and, when appropriate, develop affordable housing on city-owned lands.

121
00:11:34,023 --> 00:11:39,286
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that the trust could consider when the trust develops its own action plan as well.

122
00:11:43,073 --> 00:11:55,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Last but not the least, we have various housing resources, housing toolbox, a great source to understand our client.

123
00:11:55,557 --> 00:12:07,361
[SPEAKER_03]: DataTown has resources on housing data, and then there's Max Housing Partnerships guidebook and operation manual to operate affordable housing trust.

124
00:12:07,922 --> 00:12:11,983
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also, the city has a page on affordable housing trust.

125
00:12:13,307 --> 00:12:17,990
[SPEAKER_03]: This presentation will be uploaded on the webpage if you'd like to refer in the future.

126
00:12:19,812 --> 00:12:31,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this was a short presentation, but we also plan on inviting a staff from Mass Housing Partnership for our next meeting so we can have one-on-one training on how to operate equitable housing first.

127
00:12:33,681 --> 00:12:34,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Aditi.

128
00:12:34,602 --> 00:12:35,182
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

129
00:12:35,743 --> 00:12:37,084
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a lot of information to take in.

130
00:12:37,104 --> 00:12:37,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

131
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:37,644
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 minutes.

132
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:45,623
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll let the record reflect that member Cameron, Roberta Cameron, arrived at 634.

133
00:12:45,663 --> 00:12:48,986
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you for the presentation, DP.

134
00:12:49,006 --> 00:12:51,388
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to now go around.

135
00:12:51,829 --> 00:13:02,058
[SPEAKER_09]: And if everybody wants to, can everybody at the table just state your name and tell us a little bit about yourself and what makes you interested in form housing and being on the board.

136
00:13:02,558 --> 00:13:06,102
[SPEAKER_09]: So, DP, we'll make sure you think about it.

137
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:18,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm a renter myself, and from my lived experience, it's been hard to find affordable housing when we just had a one family member earning.

138
00:13:19,618 --> 00:13:24,821
[SPEAKER_03]: And that got me interested in now finding out more about affordable housing.

139
00:13:25,142 --> 00:13:33,246
[SPEAKER_03]: And given my planning background, I thought, why don't I focus on housing and specifically affordable housing?

140
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:34,287
[SPEAKER_03]: So here I am.

141
00:13:34,687 --> 00:13:35,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for sharing.

142
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you.

143
00:13:37,715 --> 00:13:38,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Introduce yourself.

144
00:13:39,837 --> 00:13:40,757
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Derek.

145
00:13:41,218 --> 00:13:44,680
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working in the planning department as an intern this summer.

146
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,482
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm originally from New York.

147
00:13:47,162 --> 00:13:51,926
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an architecture and background in architecture.

148
00:13:52,126 --> 00:13:55,948
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of why I'm interested in affordable housing.

149
00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:01,292
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from Brooklyn, and I've seen a lot of gentrification happening in that area.

150
00:14:01,513 --> 00:14:07,437
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm really trying to focus on how we can help families find affordable places to live.

151
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:11,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'm Lisa's son.

152
00:14:11,363 --> 00:14:15,546
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a pretty similar education background to you.

153
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:19,249
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a master's in architecture and also a master's in urban planning.

154
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:24,093
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm particularly passionate about environmental justice.

155
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:36,323
[SPEAKER_05]: So having resilient communities against climate change means thinking about the environment, like the fiscal environment, but also the economics of it and the people who are

156
00:14:37,048 --> 00:14:43,392
[SPEAKER_05]: getting basically the brunt of it are the ones who can't afford it.

157
00:14:43,852 --> 00:14:46,193
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what I am passionate about.

158
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:48,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Lisa.

159
00:14:48,174 --> 00:14:49,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Roberta.

160
00:14:49,395 --> 00:14:50,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Roberta Cameron.

161
00:14:54,097 --> 00:14:54,918
[SPEAKER_08]: So many things.

162
00:14:55,098 --> 00:14:59,060
[SPEAKER_08]: I serve on the Community Preservation Committee, which we got established

163
00:15:06,327 --> 00:15:32,869
[SPEAKER_08]: um through a vote in 2015 in Medford and have been very that I had been a planning consultant before that and did a lot of work around um affordable housing among other things and I really I affordable housing really hit me deeply especially working in suburbs and seeing the disconnect between

164
00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:41,602
[SPEAKER_08]: the what people were willing to do and the assumptions that they made and what the needs were and the reality.

165
00:15:41,723 --> 00:15:44,544
[SPEAKER_08]: So that gave me a lot of feelings.

166
00:15:44,564 --> 00:16:00,531
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've been working very hard on affordable housing since then and on helping Medford to establish more resources for affordable housing and I work for the city of Somerville relating to the Community Preservation Act.

167
00:16:03,772 --> 00:16:05,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, my name is Kayla Lassen.

168
00:16:05,253 --> 00:16:15,860
[SPEAKER_07]: The last almost 15 years I've worked for a for-profit developer who focuses on mixed income housing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

169
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,463
[SPEAKER_07]: I also am a lawyer by education, not so much by

170
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:35,535
[SPEAKER_07]: trade, though I've had extensive experience with HUD, mass housing, a little dabble with mass development, and yeah, just looking to get back and contributing.

171
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:41,398
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not, whoever you work for is not an affordable housing developer, but they do mixed income levels?

172
00:16:41,878 --> 00:16:51,143
[SPEAKER_07]: They were at one point an affordable housing developer, 100% affordable, and then the 80s programs changed and focused a lot on mixed income, so 25% percent

173
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:55,928
[SPEAKER_07]: level, sometimes 40 B's.

174
00:16:56,669 --> 00:16:58,190
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, thank you.

175
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:59,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Carrie.

176
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:01,612
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Medford resident.

177
00:17:02,573 --> 00:17:05,775
[SPEAKER_00]: I was interested in joining the board.

178
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:18,885
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought being a low income resident, I actually, you know, interested in, was hoping to buy, purchase here in Medford, but unfortunately, things have just gotten so out of control.

179
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:24,815
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't seem to have going to happen, but so I thought maybe, you know, just get involved.

180
00:17:24,895 --> 00:17:32,020
[SPEAKER_00]: I could learn a little bit more things and also maybe bring some information to the table where I am as well.

181
00:17:34,718 --> 00:17:36,258
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing with us.

182
00:17:36,278 --> 00:17:37,019
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Penny.

183
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:42,500
[SPEAKER_12]: I am a renter, so I think probably got into this through lived experience as well.

184
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,702
[SPEAKER_12]: I was living in Union Square, Somerville, and got involved in community organizing to prevent displacement.

185
00:17:47,762 --> 00:17:53,284
[SPEAKER_12]: Just first looking around seeing my friend getting displaced and then realizing I could try to do something about it.

186
00:17:53,464 --> 00:18:02,646
[SPEAKER_12]: So got involved, helped found a neighborhood council there that had been negotiating community benefits agreements with developers for things including affordable housing.

187
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,427
[SPEAKER_12]: That was one of our

188
00:18:04,998 --> 00:18:16,503
[SPEAKER_12]: Big wins and our 1st CBA since then moving to Medford looking around to see a lot of people who've also been displaced and found themselves in Medford and want to keep at their home and not get displaced again.

189
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:23,286
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is kind of the local and I also work for the city of Somerville in the office of housing stability.

190
00:18:23,326 --> 00:18:23,727
[SPEAKER_12]: So, for 3 years.

191
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:38,014
[SPEAKER_12]: I was a rental assistance advocate from 2020 to 2023, helping people access funds and legal support to prevent eviction, and now I run housing programs and healthy.

192
00:18:38,054 --> 00:18:38,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy to be with all of you.

193
00:18:39,014 --> 00:18:39,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

194
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:41,616
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Tracy DuPont.

195
00:18:41,716 --> 00:18:45,178
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the Community Preservation Act Manager here at the City of Medford.

196
00:18:45,518 --> 00:18:53,862
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also been a renter myself, so I have plenty of lived experience of talking

197
00:18:57,898 --> 00:19:06,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Communities having to, you know, so, but yes, more directly, I managed the, I helped support the CPC here.

198
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:11,802
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really looking forward to seeing what this group's going to do and help support in any way that we can.

199
00:19:12,323 --> 00:19:12,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

200
00:19:12,623 --> 00:19:13,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Theresa.

201
00:19:13,963 --> 00:19:16,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Lisa, do you want to say hello online?

202
00:19:18,188 --> 00:19:25,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm Lisa Davidson, and I've been doing housing my entire career, actually.

203
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:37,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Started off with the City of Somerville in the 90s, and then went and worked with the unhoused population with the Somerville Homeless Coalition for years.

204
00:19:37,754 --> 00:19:39,174
[SPEAKER_06]: I found myself back at the

205
00:19:39,943 --> 00:19:49,706
[SPEAKER_06]: City of Somerville's housing division and now I'm looking at funding affordable housing properties that come into the City of Somerville.

206
00:19:49,726 --> 00:19:51,667
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm very interested in housing.

207
00:19:51,687 --> 00:19:53,827
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it should be

208
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,221
[SPEAKER_06]: affordable for everybody.

209
00:19:58,261 --> 00:19:59,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody has the right to housing.

210
00:19:59,842 --> 00:20:04,804
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm looking forward to seeing what the Affordable Housing Trust Fund can do here as well.

211
00:20:05,165 --> 00:20:09,887
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sorry I'm not there in person, but thanks for putting the Zoom link.

212
00:20:09,947 --> 00:20:10,748
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.

213
00:20:11,808 --> 00:20:12,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

214
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:15,450
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll try to do this each time now that this room is set up this way.

215
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds great.

216
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:18,172
[SPEAKER_11]: And Brianna, the mayor,

217
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:37,497
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been, I have been a renter, I'm lucky to be a homeowner, and I hear from all walks of life, the issues that our residents are facing from our seniors to our low income, to our students trying to find housing, to our people who want to downsize.

218
00:20:37,577 --> 00:20:41,422
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm very interested in trying to do what we can to hammer up the needle.

219
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:46,150
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you for all taking your time.

220
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:49,913
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we're going to meet monthly, and we really appreciate you being on this board with us.

221
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:58,698
[SPEAKER_09]: So it seems like it's Medford residents who work in Medford and Somerville, so.

222
00:20:58,939 --> 00:20:59,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Not too far.

223
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:01,921
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're ready for a vote.

224
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Good.

225
00:21:05,363 --> 00:21:06,584
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll go on to number two.

226
00:21:06,604 --> 00:21:08,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, we're going to try to meet monthly.

227
00:21:08,745 --> 00:21:09,325
[SPEAKER_09]: That's our goal.

228
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:15,541
[SPEAKER_09]: We're hoping to meet the first Wednesday of each month, and we have some options for times.

229
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:17,962
[SPEAKER_09]: We have 5.30 to 7 or 6 to 7.30.

230
00:21:18,302 --> 00:21:29,007
[SPEAKER_09]: We can set a time that works for everybody, or we can do it by plan, but we'll be able to just block out your first Wednesday of the month.

231
00:21:29,692 --> 00:21:34,653
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's hard to get here by 5.30, just speak up and we'll make sure we go to 6.00.

232
00:21:34,973 --> 00:21:41,675
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, it'll be a little difficult for me to get here by 5.30, but I could definitely get here by 6.00, 6.30.

233
00:21:42,095 --> 00:21:44,015
[SPEAKER_00]: If 6.00 says has to be, I can do it by then.

234
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:45,836
[SPEAKER_00]: I would prefer the 6.00.

235
00:21:45,876 --> 00:21:46,496
[SPEAKER_09]: So 5.30 is up.

236
00:21:46,516 --> 00:21:47,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Press that up.

237
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:53,338
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to try to meet between 6.00 and 6.30, depending on if we need an hour, an hour and a half, a few hours.

238
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:54,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, great.

239
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:02,692
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing we do have to do, and I don't know if that'll be today or not, but we have designated officers.

240
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:12,135
[SPEAKER_09]: An affordable housing trust can include a chair, a vice chair, a treasurer, and clerk, which a clerk is optional.

241
00:22:12,355 --> 00:22:22,399
[SPEAKER_09]: The chair facilitates the meeting, guides the trust activities and meeting agenda, makes sure agreed tasks are carried out, ensures decisions are carried out, delegates tasks, and so on.

242
00:22:23,169 --> 00:22:27,413
[SPEAKER_09]: The vice chair assumes the role and responsibilities of the chair in her absence.

243
00:22:28,254 --> 00:22:34,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Treasurer works with the city's treasurer to set up a trust fund account, maintain financial records, and report it to the trust.

244
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:42,787
[SPEAKER_09]: The city's treasurer will have access to the trust financial records, and the trust treasurer will act as an intermediary between the trust and the city's treasurer department.

245
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:48,653
[SPEAKER_09]: And the clerk, which is optional, is responsible for taking and circulating minutes, preparing agendas for meetings,

246
00:22:49,173 --> 00:22:52,495
[SPEAKER_09]: in consultation with the chair, distributing information to members.

247
00:22:53,035 --> 00:22:54,076
[SPEAKER_09]: This is an optional role.

248
00:22:54,116 --> 00:22:57,157
[SPEAKER_09]: The city staff will also support the trust's administrative work.

249
00:22:59,418 --> 00:23:06,582
[SPEAKER_09]: I request that the trustees think about all the different roles and your potential interests in taking up any of these above roles.

250
00:23:07,002 --> 00:23:11,785
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can inform a DP over the next month or next week.

251
00:23:11,865 --> 00:23:12,885
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like a week.

252
00:23:12,905 --> 00:23:16,107
[SPEAKER_09]: So hopefully in the next couple of weeks, we can see who's interested in which roles.

253
00:23:16,692 --> 00:23:17,852
[SPEAKER_09]: and vote on that next time.

254
00:23:18,293 --> 00:23:21,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Please feel free to write to me if you're interested in any of these rules.

255
00:23:21,914 --> 00:23:25,215
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I just ask a clarifying question?

256
00:23:25,255 --> 00:23:29,317
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe I read that municipal employees cannot be the treasurer of this.

257
00:23:29,437 --> 00:23:30,457
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that correct?

258
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:35,079
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not too sure.

259
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:39,160
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, yeah, so you just double check for that.

260
00:23:40,321 --> 00:23:40,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

261
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:42,402
[SPEAKER_09]: That leaves one or two options.

262
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:53,454
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder whether that's intended set specific municipal employees of the municipality.

263
00:23:53,694 --> 00:23:56,896
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that clarification would be super helpful.

264
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:57,556
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

265
00:23:57,576 --> 00:23:57,816
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

266
00:23:58,176 --> 00:23:59,977
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, we'll get that answer.

267
00:24:00,978 --> 00:24:07,501
[SPEAKER_09]: But you all have a DPC email, so if you're interested in any of those positions, please let her know in the next week or so.

268
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:14,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions about how meetings will be run or on any of those positions?

269
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:20,543
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to go into number four, establishing working groups.

270
00:24:20,784 --> 00:24:29,289
[SPEAKER_09]: The trust could have two working groups that can meet once in two weeks to work on the following draft of the Declaration of Trust.

271
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:35,093
[SPEAKER_09]: The trust can execute the Declaration of Trust, which includes the trust's authority, rules, and regulations.

272
00:24:35,673 --> 00:24:37,775
[SPEAKER_09]: The trust should be reported to the Registry of Deeds.

273
00:24:38,075 --> 00:24:41,858
[SPEAKER_09]: While the declaration is not legally required by statute, it is recommended.

274
00:24:41,878 --> 00:24:49,003
[SPEAKER_09]: The report declaration will provide notice of establishment of the trust and its power and authority to hold and convey title to real estate.

275
00:24:49,604 --> 00:24:56,549
[SPEAKER_09]: A declaration is required when a housing trust applies any interest in real property by deed, restriction, or mortgage.

276
00:24:57,169 --> 00:25:00,172
[SPEAKER_09]: The declaration of trust must be reviewed by a legal counsel.

277
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:05,483
[SPEAKER_09]: The board can set up a working group of one to two trustees who can draft a declaration.

278
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:11,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Once reviewed by the full board, the declaration should be reviewed by a legal counsel before reporting the declaration.

279
00:25:13,007 --> 00:25:19,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Trustee suggestions, Gail Lessen has legal background and could be one of the board members.

280
00:25:23,006 --> 00:25:23,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, that's great.

281
00:25:24,466 --> 00:25:30,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we do have examples of other communities, so I'm happy to share them with you.

282
00:25:30,148 --> 00:25:33,829
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you support in any way.

283
00:25:34,389 --> 00:25:40,011
[SPEAKER_11]: We won't put pressure on you.

284
00:25:40,031 --> 00:25:42,972
[SPEAKER_11]: With the development strategy action plan.

285
00:25:43,438 --> 00:25:50,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Creating an action plan can illustrate the board's goals and priorities, usually for a period of one to five years.

286
00:25:50,244 --> 00:25:57,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Mass Housing Partnership, or MHP, a quasi-public agency, suggested that we have an action plan for a period of two years.

287
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:05,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Communities have drafted an action plan in-house, forming a working group, subcommittee, and others have hired consultants to draft an action plan.

288
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:12,082
[SPEAKER_09]: MHP recommends that we draft a two-year action plan in-house with two to three achievable goals.

289
00:26:14,947 --> 00:26:22,150
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are the two working groups that are being suggested that would probably, again, take another week to review.

290
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:25,651
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you're interested in any, please email Adeepi.

291
00:26:25,771 --> 00:26:26,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

292
00:26:26,091 --> 00:26:30,313
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll try to get probably three member working groups.

293
00:26:30,353 --> 00:26:32,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, four members will form a quorum.

294
00:26:32,774 --> 00:26:34,355
[SPEAKER_03]: So maximum of three.

295
00:26:34,495 --> 00:26:35,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Two to three members.

296
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:36,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

297
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:43,739
[SPEAKER_03]: And probably to draft a declaration of maybe two members maximum, and then three for strategic plan development.

298
00:26:46,211 --> 00:26:54,895
[SPEAKER_03]: and we probably guess that working groups can meet more than once a month so that we can report back to the trust.

299
00:26:57,476 --> 00:26:58,156
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

300
00:27:00,597 --> 00:27:01,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions there?

301
00:27:01,437 --> 00:27:04,878
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't see none.

302
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:06,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Five, we have finances.

303
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,020
[SPEAKER_09]: A, funding sources.

304
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,622
[SPEAKER_09]: The trust will have to identify funding sources to support the trust's activities and goals.

305
00:27:14,657 --> 00:27:17,137
[SPEAKER_09]: and B, CPA funding application.

306
00:27:17,157 --> 00:27:17,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

307
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:27,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Teresa DuPont, our CPA grant manager will, she's gonna briefly talk about CPA funding and how these funds can support the trust's rural housing goals and initiatives.

308
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:33,240
[SPEAKER_09]: And then DP will provide a status update on the CPA application that we have and next steps.

309
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Teresa.

310
00:27:34,721 --> 00:27:35,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, everybody.

311
00:27:36,061 --> 00:27:39,601
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanna give like a quick elevator pitch on what CPA is.

312
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:42,922
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're familiar with it, I'm really, really sorry, tune me out for the next 30 seconds.

313
00:27:43,737 --> 00:27:55,062
[SPEAKER_02]: So Community Preservation Act funding, as Roberta mentioned, it was voted in here in Medford in 2015 by a ballot and implemented in 2017-ish.

314
00:27:57,363 --> 00:28:11,510
[SPEAKER_02]: This funding comes from a surcharge on top of folks' property taxes, about 1.5% right now, which at the end of all of it, the math ends up being around $2 million each year that we can reinvest back into community projects.

315
00:28:12,627 --> 00:28:16,689
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a local tax that's raised locally, and we spend it locally.

316
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:19,150
[SPEAKER_02]: We invest it locally, all local.

317
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:26,514
[SPEAKER_02]: The three areas that we can spend CPA funding on is historic preservation, open space and recreation.

318
00:28:26,534 --> 00:28:32,016
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've seen all these beautiful big park projects happening, CPA was very much involved.

319
00:28:32,557 --> 00:28:36,118
[SPEAKER_02]: And the third one, more important to this group, is affordable housing.

320
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,740
[SPEAKER_02]: So CPA, in our young,

321
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,140
[SPEAKER_02]: time together.

322
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:48,741
[SPEAKER_02]: We have funded housing projects that include like the Walking Port redevelopment that's happening.

323
00:28:49,241 --> 00:28:52,822
[SPEAKER_02]: We've created some systems at Lepree's Village.

324
00:28:53,422 --> 00:29:00,783
[SPEAKER_02]: We have funded three condos, affordable ownership condos that are being put in on Bell's Way West.

325
00:29:01,503 --> 00:29:03,984
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping that those wrap up sometime this fall.

326
00:29:04,724 --> 00:29:10,445
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also have been funding our housing support resource programs for housing families,

327
00:29:12,073 --> 00:29:18,375
[SPEAKER_02]: So like our rental arrears and moving startup funding assistance programs.

328
00:29:19,195 --> 00:29:20,816
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we've done with housing.

329
00:29:20,836 --> 00:29:28,418
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really excited about the housing trust because I think this is a vehicle that gives a little bit more, you know, oomph behind it.

330
00:29:28,778 --> 00:29:34,379
[SPEAKER_02]: So how CPA funds can be used on the affordable trust side of things.

331
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,921
[SPEAKER_02]: The three real big things when it comes to how you can spend CPA money is on acquisition,

332
00:29:40,867 --> 00:29:45,471
[SPEAKER_02]: preservation, creation, and support.

333
00:29:46,271 --> 00:29:56,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of, and maybe Roberta can have an opinion on this, but preservation and support, it kind of can muddle the lines.

334
00:29:56,219 --> 00:30:09,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so acquisition is easy, creation is easy to understand, but support means to help households be able to access housing they can afford.

335
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:13,921
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a very specific kind of support.

336
00:30:13,941 --> 00:30:27,053
[SPEAKER_08]: So we use it for rental assistance and we have a move-in assistance program in Medford to help pay first to last month rent so that people can access apartments.

337
00:30:27,073 --> 00:30:30,255
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what the support category is.

338
00:30:31,056 --> 00:30:35,580
[SPEAKER_08]: And the preserve category is tricky with affordable housing because it's

339
00:30:38,992 --> 00:30:45,116
[SPEAKER_08]: We're only supposed to use a CPA fund to preserve affordable housing if it was created with CPA in the first place.

340
00:30:45,896 --> 00:30:52,401
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're not supposed to use CPA funds to fix housing authority billings.

341
00:30:53,122 --> 00:30:56,424
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not the purpose of CPA.

342
00:30:56,684 --> 00:31:00,527
[SPEAKER_08]: We're supposed to use it to create more affordable housing.

343
00:31:01,007 --> 00:31:19,615
[SPEAKER_08]: expanding, but if we, for example, we used it to build the units at Bellsman West, if in 15 years from now something was in disrepair and they needed to put more funds back into those buildings, they could use it to preserve those buildings.

344
00:31:22,817 --> 00:31:29,540
[SPEAKER_02]: One couple of just notes to throw out there early about CPA is any property acquired

345
00:31:30,378 --> 00:31:40,401
[SPEAKER_02]: or bills with CPA dollars must have a perpetual deed restriction on it, which is another way for us to protect our affordable housing inventory here in the city.

346
00:31:40,421 --> 00:31:43,022
[SPEAKER_02]: In perpetuity.

347
00:31:43,142 --> 00:31:43,682
[SPEAKER_02]: In perpetuity.

348
00:31:44,042 --> 00:31:45,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Perpetual, yeah, sorry.

349
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:46,463
[SPEAKER_09]: I messed up that word.

350
00:31:47,003 --> 00:31:49,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no, just, yeah, because I think in the past,

351
00:31:50,895 --> 00:31:53,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Back in the day, there weren't any.

352
00:31:54,096 --> 00:31:55,036
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to make sure.

353
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially this board needs to make sure.

354
00:31:57,857 --> 00:32:11,741
[SPEAKER_02]: And that might be a task that the board addresses, because we do have inventory on our subsidized housing inventory, SHI listing, that, as the mayor alluded, had deep restrictions, but they were only for 15 to 20 years.

355
00:32:11,821 --> 00:32:15,302
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got a couple next year that are falling off of that.

356
00:32:15,943 --> 00:32:20,146
[SPEAKER_02]: As they try, you know, it's not a whole heck of a lot, but it's still it's sad to lose any units.

357
00:32:20,426 --> 00:32:22,708
[SPEAKER_02]: But the 38 we don't measure somebody.

358
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:25,390
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like it's it's one of the extensions.

359
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:28,292
[SPEAKER_02]: The water's clean.

360
00:32:28,732 --> 00:32:32,515
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, there's another one coming up in like twenty, thirty two, which three this one.

361
00:32:32,695 --> 00:32:32,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

362
00:32:33,136 --> 00:32:33,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

363
00:32:33,396 --> 00:32:37,819
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just you know, CPA could be used to help protect that.

364
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:44,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not exactly sure how it would look like, but if there's dollars that need to be spent for preserving those restrictions and sending them.

365
00:32:45,522 --> 00:32:46,683
[SPEAKER_02]: CPA could be used for that.

366
00:32:46,723 --> 00:32:53,268
[SPEAKER_02]: We have rules from the Department of Revenue on what we can spend the funding on.

367
00:32:53,288 --> 00:32:59,613
[SPEAKER_02]: So any funding that does go to the trust would have to be very carefully recorded, the files and record keeping and everything like that.

368
00:32:59,673 --> 00:33:09,461
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would be working with whomever the treasurer is and whatnot for helping keep that straight.

369
00:33:10,101 --> 00:33:14,605
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there's any questions on CPA, I know that was a little bit longer than 30 seconds,

370
00:33:15,302 --> 00:33:15,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

371
00:33:16,902 --> 00:33:17,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions?

372
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:19,523
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what that is.

373
00:33:20,643 --> 00:33:22,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll leave my cards with everybody.

374
00:33:22,163 --> 00:33:24,764
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if you have a question over the weekend, I'll shoot me an email.

375
00:33:24,784 --> 00:33:26,684
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to take that up.

376
00:33:28,145 --> 00:33:31,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, Aditi, thank you, President Behrs, for being here with us.

377
00:33:31,846 --> 00:33:33,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sure.

378
00:33:33,506 --> 00:33:37,587
[SPEAKER_12]: I was holding my phone at that age.

379
00:33:37,607 --> 00:33:38,447
[SPEAKER_12]: Pay attention.

380
00:33:38,467 --> 00:33:39,147
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, CPA.

381
00:33:39,187 --> 00:33:41,088
[SPEAKER_12]: I've never heard of it.

382
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:45,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, CPA has been great.

383
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:47,680
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got a lot of projects done at CPA.

384
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Teresa.

385
00:33:48,981 --> 00:33:52,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for being here and being supportive.

386
00:33:52,143 --> 00:33:58,287
[SPEAKER_03]: And speaking of CPA, CPC put out a funding application in July.

387
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:06,763
[SPEAKER_03]: And on behalf of the trust, I went ahead and filled out a form to determine our eligibility, the trust's eligibility.

388
00:34:07,104 --> 00:34:10,006
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was the first round of the application form.

389
00:34:10,646 --> 00:34:15,130
[SPEAKER_03]: And in September 1st week, there's a full application form that's due.

390
00:34:16,051 --> 00:34:21,695
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're hoping that the trust can apply and receive CPA funds.

391
00:34:22,295 --> 00:34:26,138
[SPEAKER_03]: So the initial application that I put out was requesting funds for $250,000.

392
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:36,665
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping that by September 10th, we can fill out a full application.

393
00:34:37,085 --> 00:34:44,529
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm happy to have a draft out there and share with the trustees for my feedback.

394
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:50,231
[SPEAKER_03]: As a follow-up question to Roberta's comment on support as

395
00:34:51,933 --> 00:35:00,416
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the CPA categories to support affordable housing, can we use CPA funds to develop an action plan for the trust?

396
00:35:01,276 --> 00:35:02,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's a very good question.

397
00:35:02,657 --> 00:35:08,078
[SPEAKER_08]: That would fall under the CPA and admin category.

398
00:35:08,558 --> 00:35:19,362
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a very limited amount of funding that can be used for activities that help to determine how to spend CPA funds.

399
00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:21,868
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's in the admin category.

400
00:35:22,348 --> 00:35:29,037
[SPEAKER_08]: So we don't have a lot of admin funding available, but we could see how much we have.

401
00:35:29,438 --> 00:35:33,463
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be a qualifying expense for admin.

402
00:35:34,345 --> 00:35:34,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

403
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:49,016
[SPEAKER_03]: given that the trust doesn't have an action plan yet, but the CDA on funding applications due next month, just wondering how can we fill out the application form?

404
00:35:49,056 --> 00:35:51,297
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no application form for admin.

405
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:56,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Admin doesn't have to go through the application and accounts approval process.

406
00:35:59,081 --> 00:35:59,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

407
00:35:59,481 --> 00:36:01,742
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a direct decision by the

408
00:36:05,005 --> 00:36:14,532
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been made by the CPA manager, by the CPA officers, or the CPC officers, or just by the CPC as a whole.

409
00:36:15,052 --> 00:36:24,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Depending on the amount that we are agreeing to spend, different parties will have discretion to make that decision.

410
00:36:26,881 --> 00:36:30,764
[SPEAKER_02]: And as for the full application, I know we're very young.

411
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:33,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Inaugural meeting happening right now.

412
00:36:34,196 --> 00:36:39,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think that the committee would acknowledge that in the application.

413
00:36:39,117 --> 00:36:43,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of our applications that come through, we're really deep diving into the details with this.

414
00:36:45,219 --> 00:36:53,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's not up to me, it's up to the committee, but I think that they would factor in the very newness of this group into the application.

415
00:36:53,821 --> 00:37:02,903
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll have presentations in October, so maybe by that time we'll have a little bit more meat that we can discuss on the group, and then you can share that during the presentations.

416
00:37:04,065 --> 00:37:04,365
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

417
00:37:05,366 --> 00:37:13,650
[SPEAKER_09]: But it can be a little bit more open-ended for things we might decide to do or talk about doing in October, November, December and into the future.

418
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:18,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully just get a lot of money to have some spending ability, right?

419
00:37:18,472 --> 00:37:25,596
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, up to the committee, but I feel like I know that they're very supportive of this group and the work that we're going to be doing here, so.

420
00:37:26,276 --> 00:37:27,997
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to know.

421
00:37:28,057 --> 00:37:28,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Lisa asked.

422
00:37:29,117 --> 00:37:30,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Lisa, yes, sorry.

423
00:37:31,736 --> 00:37:32,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, no, no, thank you.

424
00:37:33,477 --> 00:37:37,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, just to clarify and question actually, maybe 3.

425
00:37:37,981 --> 00:37:43,145
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I heard an applications due in September for the CPA CPA monies.

426
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:46,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and I think I heard them the amount 250,000 dollars.

427
00:37:50,590 --> 00:38:00,994
[SPEAKER_06]: I assume this could be wrong, but when you're doing an application, there has to be some sort of idea on what you're going to spend the funding on.

428
00:38:01,494 --> 00:38:03,135
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I heard, I'm sorry.

429
00:38:04,452 --> 00:38:10,113
[SPEAKER_06]: I forget her name from the CPC.

430
00:38:10,353 --> 00:38:11,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Teresa, thank you.

431
00:38:11,293 --> 00:38:14,494
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost called her Terry, so I knew it was a T, I'm sorry.

432
00:38:15,554 --> 00:38:23,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, I think I heard that you're already funding other nonprofits through the CPC application.

433
00:38:23,216 --> 00:38:24,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that correct?

434
00:38:25,096 --> 00:38:26,517
[SPEAKER_06]: That is correct.

435
00:38:26,577 --> 00:38:32,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Rental arrears, startups, when we're filling out an application for the trust,

436
00:38:37,338 --> 00:38:40,200
[SPEAKER_06]: do we have an idea on what we would be using the $250,000?

437
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, $250,000 is, if we're gonna look to help with development, $250,000 is not a lot of money for development, right?

438
00:38:43,683 --> 00:38:49,847
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's, I mean, in Somerville, we're doing, there's a lot, it costs a lot of money right now for development.

439
00:38:49,867 --> 00:38:50,888
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just kind of wondering,

440
00:39:05,193 --> 00:39:12,635
[SPEAKER_06]: where the 250 came from and if there was an idea on what it would be used for.

441
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:19,816
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know we're early on in the process, but September is going to be here soon, right?

442
00:39:22,997 --> 00:39:26,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I can answer definitely the first part of your question there.

443
00:39:26,277 --> 00:39:29,658
[SPEAKER_02]: The 250 kind of came out because in CPA land,

444
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:34,614
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to spend a minimum of 10% for each of those three categories I mentioned.

445
00:39:35,175 --> 00:39:43,083
[SPEAKER_02]: So based on our budgeting that we allocate, we actually allocated 15% this year towards affordable housing.

446
00:39:43,143 --> 00:39:48,949
[SPEAKER_02]: So the 250 is almost what we've kind of allocated for housing anyway is our minimum.

447
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:57,570
[SPEAKER_02]: It also does, this is pure happenstance, that it aligns with what a lot of other communities have done for their housing trusts.

448
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:08,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was Lincoln, Harvard, Genoa, not local, but those are examples I was able to dig up, that when their affordable housing trust first applied, it was also for about $200 to $250.

449
00:40:08,779 --> 00:40:15,305
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hear you that it's not a whole heck of a lot of money, but it's something to at least get us started, to get something in the bank.

450
00:40:20,512 --> 00:40:42,472
[SPEAKER_02]: As for not being able to necessarily identify exact tasks or assignments, if you will, for what this trust is going to do, I think that we're just in a tough spot right now, but I think for the sake of the application, if we can identify a couple of items that we're going to come out the gate with,

451
00:40:43,102 --> 00:40:45,483
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of tackling, I think that that would be sufficient.

452
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:51,144
[SPEAKER_02]: I do also happen to have one of my chairperson here right now who maybe has other opinions, but I will see the floor.

453
00:40:51,344 --> 00:41:08,468
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to point out that we have, that the CPC has in the past banked housing, money for affordable housing, but when they didn't have an applicant that round, they just carved off money and said, we'll use this in the future.

454
00:41:08,809 --> 00:41:10,549
[SPEAKER_11]: So I see this as a similar thing.

455
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:19,429
[SPEAKER_08]: money and saying that we'll use it in the future, even though it won't buy.

456
00:41:19,569 --> 00:41:28,014
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a start, and potentially it will double it before we even have a concrete plan of how to move forward.

457
00:41:28,054 --> 00:41:35,878
[SPEAKER_09]: And we do have, I think Theresa mentioned that 2.4 million applications have come in.

458
00:41:36,457 --> 00:41:40,578
[SPEAKER_09]: for the CPA funding, and we have only have 2 million to disperse.

459
00:41:40,678 --> 00:41:46,180
[SPEAKER_09]: So the committee is going to have to make those decisions in September, October, November.

460
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:56,262
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, this is a good start, considering we have so many applicants with a number of projects, many of which are city-method projects, too.

461
00:41:56,302 --> 00:41:56,922
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yes.

462
00:41:58,243 --> 00:41:59,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I answer your question, Lisa?

463
00:42:02,845 --> 00:42:03,366
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't.

464
00:42:03,406 --> 00:42:03,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

465
00:42:04,246 --> 00:42:06,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Just trying to like wrap my head around it.

466
00:42:06,808 --> 00:42:07,809
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

467
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:13,253
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I just, um, is the due date September 1st or 10th?

468
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:13,794
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, cool.

469
00:42:13,834 --> 00:42:15,095
[SPEAKER_12]: I love the deadline.

470
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:15,995
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's good to know.

471
00:42:16,035 --> 00:42:16,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

472
00:42:16,336 --> 00:42:16,736
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on Monday.

473
00:42:16,756 --> 00:42:16,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

474
00:42:16,916 --> 00:42:17,617
[SPEAKER_12]: The Monday after Labor Day.

475
00:42:26,756 --> 00:42:44,874
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds as though to complete that application, what will be most helpful would be for you to draft the application and then the committee can all or the trust board can all review the draft and make comments and updates to it.

476
00:42:45,554 --> 00:42:45,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

477
00:42:46,295 --> 00:42:48,557
[SPEAKER_08]: I can also help guide you through it too.

478
00:42:48,837 --> 00:42:49,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

479
00:42:49,557 --> 00:42:59,223
[SPEAKER_03]: because we don't have, the trust doesn't have an action plan yet, and I assume it will be at least end of the year for us to come up with a complete set of strategies and goals.

480
00:42:59,423 --> 00:43:00,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

481
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:04,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Just be careful not to wiggle the meeting along.

482
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:07,267
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, you can't email it to us and we can't all comment.

483
00:43:07,307 --> 00:43:07,968
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you know.

484
00:43:08,068 --> 00:43:10,029
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be in our meeting packet.

485
00:43:10,069 --> 00:43:10,609
[SPEAKER_08]: In your meeting, yes.

486
00:43:10,709 --> 00:43:14,351
[SPEAKER_08]: In our meeting packet, and then we have one meeting in which to discuss it.

487
00:43:14,371 --> 00:43:14,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

488
00:43:14,612 --> 00:43:14,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, yep.

489
00:43:15,012 --> 00:43:16,993
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm saying.

490
00:43:17,322 --> 00:43:22,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's a little time because with September 1st, Monday, 4th, 1st, Wednesday.

491
00:43:22,685 --> 00:43:27,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so September 4th, we ideally have the next meeting.

492
00:43:27,468 --> 00:43:31,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but you don't need to finalize.

493
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:32,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

494
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:32,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

495
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:37,913
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think if you have ideas or, you know, something that someone's done or a different community, send them to what you think.

496
00:43:38,213 --> 00:43:41,155
[SPEAKER_09]: You can organize them into what the draft.

497
00:43:41,435 --> 00:43:41,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

498
00:43:42,015 --> 00:43:43,716
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a final reading.

499
00:43:43,937 --> 00:43:46,458
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be able to get in our packet a week prior.

500
00:43:47,128 --> 00:43:49,552
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we have a final discussion on and on and forth.

501
00:43:49,612 --> 00:43:50,974
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think it lines up pretty nicely.

502
00:43:50,994 --> 00:43:54,739
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you able to share what you submitted before?

503
00:43:54,840 --> 00:44:01,049
[SPEAKER_12]: Just I think you said you had to upload it or share it with like, is it just kind of a placeholder paragraph or like what's out there already?

504
00:44:02,216 --> 00:44:07,019
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an eligibility, eligibility determination form.

505
00:44:07,219 --> 00:44:13,763
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just, it's like a one and a half page just to make sure that your, your project can be eligible for CPA.

506
00:44:13,803 --> 00:44:15,985
[SPEAKER_02]: If somebody comes and says, Hey, I want to buy an ice cream truck.

507
00:44:16,205 --> 00:44:20,828
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not an appropriate use, but somebody wants to establish an affordable housing trust.

508
00:44:21,028 --> 00:44:25,031
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to prevent people, have you ever written a grant where it's like, you've gotten all the way to the end?

509
00:44:25,071 --> 00:44:26,271
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, Oh, you can't do that.

510
00:44:26,371 --> 00:44:28,193
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't share that at all.

511
00:44:28,233 --> 00:44:29,534
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a reading package.

512
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:30,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it makes sense.

513
00:44:33,408 --> 00:44:48,757
[SPEAKER_09]: have any questions or comments from the board.

514
00:45:03,983 --> 00:45:07,045
[SPEAKER_09]: reviewing city-owned parcels to see what's available.

515
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:11,269
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the idea of trying to build some affordable housing on some.

516
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:16,953
[SPEAKER_09]: I also like the idea of selling some lots so that we can, the sale proceeds can go into the trust.

517
00:45:17,494 --> 00:45:20,737
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is something, I just signed up the contract on that recently.

518
00:45:20,757 --> 00:45:30,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are some of the ideas of what we could do with the 250,000 consultants we could hire to evaluate what other cities and towns have done, give us some bids.

519
00:45:34,654 --> 00:45:41,118
[SPEAKER_12]: I have two questions, I guess, about on the topic of studies, which like you do need that.

520
00:45:41,218 --> 00:45:46,862
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yeah, yeah, I guess.

521
00:45:47,463 --> 00:45:53,807
[SPEAKER_12]: Has there been a nexus study for housing nexus in Medford?

522
00:45:54,187 --> 00:46:00,892
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've been having this conversation because the city of Medford has the linkage program, which includes

523
00:46:02,508 --> 00:46:13,172
[SPEAKER_03]: collecting linkage fee for the development of parks and recreation, police and fire, water and sewer, roads and transportation.

524
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:24,376
[SPEAKER_03]: We have an act that establishes this linkage program, which includes affordable housing, but we do not have that in our ordinance yet.

525
00:46:24,496 --> 00:46:30,278
[SPEAKER_03]: The City Council brought this up a couple of months ago to include affordable housing linkage.

526
00:46:31,108 --> 00:46:39,154
[SPEAKER_03]: but we were also trying to see if we can update the existing linkage fee as well as include equitable housing linkage along with that.

527
00:46:39,874 --> 00:46:44,918
[SPEAKER_03]: So to conduct a Nexus study, it would cost us nearly $200,000 at this point.

528
00:46:45,058 --> 00:46:49,761
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are figuring out how to identify the funding to do this Nexus study.

529
00:46:50,261 --> 00:46:56,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we've been in touch with a couple of consultants who are willing to do this, but it's sort of a conversation that's ongoing.

530
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,824
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it was a certain amount of money to include affordable housing in linkage.

531
00:47:02,024 --> 00:47:07,068
[SPEAKER_09]: And then another portion of money to update all the accounts we already have.

532
00:47:07,148 --> 00:47:12,732
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's something maybe this committee can put in our application as a possibility of how to spend it.

533
00:47:12,952 --> 00:47:13,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

534
00:47:13,573 --> 00:47:20,098
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they were to include affordable housing linkage, so that would amount to $16,000 roughly.

535
00:47:20,818 --> 00:47:24,181
[SPEAKER_03]: But updating the entire program would amount to nearly $200,000.

536
00:47:25,877 --> 00:47:27,018
[SPEAKER_12]: Understood.

537
00:47:27,318 --> 00:47:37,422
[SPEAKER_12]: And then if I could, if there's a follow-up question, another study that was mentioned, I think in the health and production plan, just kind of to check in on the analysis of impediments to fair housing.

538
00:47:37,442 --> 00:47:38,923
[SPEAKER_12]: It said the most recent one had been 2012.

539
00:47:38,963 --> 00:47:46,426
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess I was just wondering if since that report came out, if one's happened or if that's still something on our list, to-do list.

540
00:47:46,706 --> 00:47:49,047
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not too sure, but I think that's something on our list.

541
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:49,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, great.

542
00:47:49,747 --> 00:47:50,187
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks so much.

543
00:47:50,207 --> 00:47:50,668
[SPEAKER_11]: That's helpful.

544
00:47:54,005 --> 00:47:58,627
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the home consortium might be working on something that's regional in nature.

545
00:47:58,647 --> 00:48:04,529
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if that's a good question to ask them, since they're working on a, is it a consolidated plan they're working on now?

546
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:08,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there's a consolidated plan, a five-year plan that NSE is working on.

547
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:13,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it's just, the PICOF meeting was today, so we'll have to wait to know what that entails.

548
00:48:13,412 --> 00:48:20,095
[SPEAKER_12]: Amazing, and last moving forward for this, they just approved, I think, an Office of Fair Housing, so I think there will be a lot more happening around that, but anyway, okay, thank you, Sharon.

549
00:48:20,275 --> 00:48:23,356
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're missing only two, and we can maybe also, and then I'll just speak

550
00:48:24,517 --> 00:48:41,716
[SPEAKER_09]: We can also state in the application maybe for some matching money because the $5 billion bill just got signed yesterday by the governor and then Senator Warren had a very big press conference last week with money she's going to be

551
00:48:42,928 --> 00:49:10,508
[SPEAKER_09]: trying to get to cities and towns which is going to be pretty broad and open-ended like how do you how can you increase and support affordable housing and there's going to be it's going to be pretty open-ended for us so I don't know it could be any matching money we need for any of anything that's coming down the pipeline but um all good news on on that front so uh and maybe after reversing maybe you can just explain to the committee what the home is so that everybody's educated

552
00:49:11,794 --> 00:49:12,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so two things.

553
00:49:13,015 --> 00:49:19,058
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, the nexus study would not be an eligible use of CPA funds.

554
00:49:19,278 --> 00:49:24,900
[SPEAKER_08]: So I like to be serious to look at other directions for where to get funding for that.

555
00:49:25,881 --> 00:49:29,783
[SPEAKER_08]: And then queuing up Danielle talking about the whole consortium.

556
00:49:29,843 --> 00:49:34,125
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm curious what the timeline is for the consolidated plan.

557
00:49:34,885 --> 00:49:40,068
[SPEAKER_08]: And to, I think it'd be useful for this board to know

558
00:49:40,893 --> 00:49:50,519
[SPEAKER_08]: how their funding could align with funding that we have to support the same projects?

559
00:49:52,361 --> 00:50:05,709
[SPEAKER_03]: To respond to Roberta's question, the timeline for the consolidated plan is February next year, based on all these meetings, and they plan to finalize it by May 2025.

560
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:08,852
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the first draft is in February.

561
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:09,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, yes.

562
00:50:11,073 --> 00:50:12,675
[SPEAKER_10]: and Daniela who's the new planner.

563
00:50:12,735 --> 00:50:15,597
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry I was late, I had a meeting about the board meeting that I was having.

564
00:50:17,239 --> 00:50:27,367
[SPEAKER_10]: So the home consortium, so the city of Medford is part of the North Suburban Home Consortium, which is comprised of eight communities.

565
00:50:27,427 --> 00:50:36,576
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's Medford, Malden, Everett, Chelsea, Arlington, Melrose, what am I forgetting?

566
00:50:36,636 --> 00:50:36,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Revere.

567
00:50:37,396 --> 00:50:37,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Revere.

568
00:50:40,656 --> 00:50:41,376
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the other one?

569
00:50:41,697 --> 00:50:42,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, WinFIRST.

570
00:50:43,057 --> 00:50:43,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

571
00:50:44,138 --> 00:50:56,766
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically, those eight communities basically get an allocation from HUD based on a formula.

572
00:50:57,166 --> 00:51:02,849
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Medgar probably brings the lion's share of the funds there, but it's all pooled.

573
00:51:02,869 --> 00:51:09,874
[SPEAKER_10]: And so it's any developer, mostly nonprofit developers, comes to the consortium and can apply for funding.

574
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:19,584
[SPEAKER_10]: There are many of those state communities and it's rolling, so you can come anytime and ask.

575
00:51:19,604 --> 00:51:27,029
[SPEAKER_10]: So if the funding cycle for the trust is rolling, then they can be aligned pretty well.

576
00:51:30,071 --> 00:51:40,797
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the projects in Medford that the home is supporting or did support is the three units that are being built on the Bellsway, and you can actually see them being built right now, structures up.

577
00:51:41,418 --> 00:51:47,922
[SPEAKER_10]: And Walgreens is going to get some of the home ARP, which I'm very glad.

578
00:51:47,942 --> 00:51:49,623
[SPEAKER_10]: I encourage them to apply for it.

579
00:51:49,643 --> 00:51:51,344
[SPEAKER_10]: If they haven't yet, don't apply for it.

580
00:51:51,624 --> 00:51:52,444
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine.

581
00:51:54,946 --> 00:51:59,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Can CPA funds be used to study city-owned blocks to develop affordable housing?

582
00:52:00,849 --> 00:52:03,611
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a question that I would need to think about.

583
00:52:03,631 --> 00:52:09,274
[SPEAKER_08]: CPA funds can be used as pre-development for a development project.

584
00:52:09,434 --> 00:52:10,875
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we're certain

585
00:52:11,244 --> 00:52:16,447
[SPEAKER_08]: that those city-owned lots are candidates for developing affordable housing, then yes.

586
00:52:17,227 --> 00:52:22,470
[SPEAKER_08]: If we're not certain, then that might fall into the administrative funding category.

587
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:30,615
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you say it cannot be used for the NEXUS study, does that mean just increasing

588
00:52:32,198 --> 00:52:42,882
[SPEAKER_09]: review of increasing the buckets we already have and could we use it for the $60,000 just to add affordable housing to the linkage?

589
00:52:43,842 --> 00:52:53,686
[SPEAKER_08]: So seed money to help us make more money for affordable housing doesn't fit into any of the categories for CPA.

590
00:52:53,786 --> 00:52:55,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Acquire, create,

591
00:52:56,020 --> 00:53:05,768
[SPEAKER_08]: support households to access housing they can afford, but that really has to be tied to specific households or to preserve or restore.

592
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:09,131
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there already a map of the lots?

593
00:53:11,133 --> 00:53:13,615
[SPEAKER_03]: We've identified two or three lots.

594
00:53:13,915 --> 00:53:14,175
Okay.

595
00:53:14,796 --> 00:53:20,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but there's a huge inventory, but they've not identified to build affordable housing yet.

596
00:53:20,441 --> 00:53:20,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

597
00:53:21,248 --> 00:53:27,733
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a listing of, and I received it recently from the assessing office of all municipal owned lots, so.

598
00:53:27,753 --> 00:53:29,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, yeah, okay.

599
00:53:29,314 --> 00:53:31,115
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a couple pages long.

600
00:53:33,416 --> 00:53:40,141
[SPEAKER_09]: And another piece is the inclusionary zoning that was passed, and I believe finalized and passed in 2019.

601
00:53:40,181 --> 00:53:50,048
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's been five years, so that's something maybe we could pick up, not even necessarily with CPA money, but just reviewing that and seeing how we can strengthen it without deterring development.

602
00:53:50,775 --> 00:54:04,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, yeah, I always, I always talk to Danielle about, about how a developer will do build one home and the next six months, six months for them, buy another home and, and, you know, start developing that.

603
00:54:04,705 --> 00:54:05,886
[SPEAKER_09]: And it just goes on and on.

604
00:54:05,926 --> 00:54:11,210
[SPEAKER_09]: So I always in mind when they do that 15 home or 10 home, that one should be affordable.

605
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:13,952
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's one way I'd really love to strengthen it.

606
00:54:13,972 --> 00:54:19,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause we have developers that can do flip a two family home and another two family and another two family, but never.

607
00:54:20,617 --> 00:54:22,178
[SPEAKER_09]: add to our affordable housing stock.

608
00:54:22,218 --> 00:54:24,659
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's something that needs to be looked into.

609
00:54:25,439 --> 00:54:28,460
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd like to see us being able to do fractional payments.

610
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:46,948
[SPEAKER_10]: So a lot of times, so if they round up, but the way that developers will plan a project and they'll, you know, cut off enough units where they don't have to round up because of the entire factory unit, you know, it's, you know, a big chunk of change that they're subsidizing.

611
00:54:46,968 --> 00:54:47,928
[SPEAKER_10]: But if say it was,

612
00:54:49,340 --> 00:55:08,525
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, fractional payments, just pay like 10%, I'd say it was, it rounds up, say 6.1 units divided when you do the math, our organization has to round up to seven, so they'll reduce their unit count, so they only have to get six even.

613
00:55:08,825 --> 00:55:14,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so it'd be a lot of fractional payment, that could be some funds I could come to trust.

614
00:55:21,035 --> 00:55:21,715
[SPEAKER_11]: So good ideas.

615
00:55:21,935 --> 00:55:23,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's start again.

616
00:55:26,537 --> 00:55:31,258
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's no other questions or comments or ideas, we have a few tasks.

617
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:41,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Like we stated, so you're gonna let a DP know if you have any interest in the chair, vice chair, treasurer, or potential clerk.

618
00:55:42,362 --> 00:55:47,244
[SPEAKER_09]: You're gonna let a DP know of any ideas you might have for the CPA funding.

619
00:55:48,701 --> 00:55:58,725
[SPEAKER_09]: and whether or not you want to be the one or two members to help draft the declaration of trust, or the one, two, three members to help develop a strategy action plan.

620
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:05,889
[SPEAKER_09]: So within the next week, maybe two, please email DPM and let her know if there's any interest in any of those.

621
00:56:07,709 --> 00:56:11,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, please hold September 4th at 6 p.m.

622
00:56:11,871 --> 00:56:15,052
[SPEAKER_09]: If we change that to 6.30, we'll let you know, but please hold 6 p.m.

623
00:56:15,173 --> 00:56:15,293
[SPEAKER_09]: to 7.30

624
00:56:18,359 --> 00:56:25,426
[SPEAKER_09]: is no further comment or question on anything that's listed on the agenda, then I'll await a motion to adjourn.

625
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:27,588
[SPEAKER_09]: So moved.

626
00:56:28,409 --> 00:56:34,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to adjourn, seconded by Kayla and Penny.

627
00:56:36,314 --> 00:56:38,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to adjourn by Kayla, seconded by Penny.

628
00:56:39,235 --> 00:56:47,556
[SPEAKER_09]: All those, actually there's somebody on Zoom and I haven't been learning everybody's name by tonight, so I'll call the roll on the motion to adjourn.

629
00:56:48,216 --> 00:56:48,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Kayla.

630
00:56:49,217 --> 00:56:49,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Kay.

631
00:56:50,197 --> 00:56:50,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Roberta.

632
00:56:50,857 --> 00:56:51,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

633
00:56:51,957 --> 00:56:52,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Lisa Ann.

634
00:56:53,558 --> 00:56:53,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

635
00:56:54,538 --> 00:56:54,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Carol.

636
00:56:55,518 --> 00:56:55,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Carol.

637
00:56:56,258 --> 00:56:56,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

638
00:56:56,778 --> 00:56:57,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Penny.

639
00:56:57,398 --> 00:56:57,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

640
00:56:58,158 --> 00:56:58,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Lisa.

641
00:56:58,739 --> 00:56:58,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

642
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:00,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Myself, yes.

643
00:57:00,659 --> 00:57:02,619
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's 70 affirmative, zero negative.

644
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:04,120
[SPEAKER_09]: This meeting is adjourned.

645
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:05,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you again for joining us.

646
00:57:06,249 --> 00:57:07,502
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll see you on September 4.
