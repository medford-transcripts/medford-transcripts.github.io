    <p>[Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=98.826">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=99.706">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=101.027">Quite</a>  excited to have the first meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=103.028">I'm</a>  Aditi Mughal, staff planner for housing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=106.369">I'm</a>  going to provide a short presentation on affordable housing trust fund and an overview of Medford's housing data. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=115.013">What</a>  is an affordable housing trust? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=116.754">It's</a>  a public entity. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=118.215">It</a>  acts as a municipal bank that can collect funds and use those funds to create and preserve affordable housing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=125.501">The</a>  trust is led by a board of trustees. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=130.384">There's</a>  a state law. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=134.322">a</a>  statute that allows local municipalities to establish an affordable housing trust. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=138.967">That's</a>  how Medford was able to establish an affordable housing trust. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=142.47">And</a>  the statute outlines that the main purpose of the trust is to provide for the creation and preservation of affordable housing in municipalities for the benefit of low and moderate income households and for the funding of community housing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=157.43">What</a>  can the trust do? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=158.972">The</a>  trust can provide financial support to develop affordable homes, rehabilitate existing homes to convert them to affordable housing, increase affordable housing development projects. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=170.998">develop</a>  affordable housing in city-owned lots, preserve properties faced with expiring affordability restrictions, and then provide rental assistance for low and moderate income households. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=185.561">These</a>  are some of the activities that the trust can support, but the trust can also act as an affordable housing advocacy and policy development agent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=198.457">So</a>  what does the Board of Trustees look like? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=200.798">We</a>  have a seven-member board, which includes the mayor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=204.319">We</a>  have one member of the Community Preservation Committee, and the remaining are the residents of the Medford City. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=213.762">The</a>  Board of Trustees are appointed by the mayor upon confirmation by the City Council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=218.863">The</a>  trustees have a two-year term, while the initial terms are standard. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=225.035">We</a>  require a four-member board of trustees to form a quorum and a quorum will allow the board of trustees to approve any motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=234.003">If</a>  there are vacancies on the board, for example, if there are two vacancies, then the board would require to have three members to form a quorum. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=244.455">So</a>  there are certain powers and rules and regulations that are outlined in the state statute. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=251.62">And</a>  it's also outlined in our affordable housing ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=255.423">So</a>  some of the powers listed here are the board can accept and receive property, purchase and retain real or personal property, sell, exchange and transfer property, execute, acknowledge and deliver deeds and other instruments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=271.515">The</a>  trust can also employ advisors, agents, consultants, even full or part-time staff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=278.418">So</a>  for more information on the 16 powers set forth in the trust statute, please feel free to scan the QR code or it's available on the city's website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=291.503">So</a>  as I mentioned earlier, the trust acts as a municipal bank, so the trust would require to <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=298.418">look</a>  for funding sources. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=300.3">Here</a>  are some of the examples. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=302.502">Community</a>  Preservation Act funds is the most popular funding source. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=306.625">We</a>  also have inclusionary zoning payments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=309.267">At</a>  this point, the City of Medford has inclusionary zoning ordinance, but we don't have inclusionary zoning payments yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=316.942">There</a>  are also possibilities of acquiring private donations, municipalities general fund, tax title sales, payments from special bylaws or ordinance, and self-tavern lease payments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=332.112">Since</a>  the trust works for the benefit of low and moderate income households, HUD outlines what the income categories are for low and moderate income households. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=342.495">The</a>  current area median income of Medford is at $149,000 approximately. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=349.939">So</a>  low and moderate income households income are set at 80% of the area median income or below. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=357.784">So</a>  that amounts to roughly around $130,000. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=361.366">A</a>  very low income household would be at 50% AMI. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=368.038">and</a>  extremely low income household would be at 30% AMI based on the hard income limits of 2024. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=377.733">So</a>  what does Medford's household income look like? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=381.235">An</a>  owner-occupied median household income is around $115,000, and a renter-occupied income is around $94,000. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=391.463">So</a>  if you look at the income graph, there's about 35% of the households that earn $115,000 or more, whereas nearly 65% of <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=404.433">Medford's</a>  households are at 80% or below, so they comprise of low and moderate income households. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=412.58">So</a>  there are 35% of the households that earn $150,000 or more income, but based on HUD area median income, which is set at $149,000 nearly, so that would equate to nearly 65% of <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=433.64">the</a>  households in Medford are at low or moderate income households.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001763_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=438.741">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=439.421">Can</a>  I ask a quick question as well? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=440.722">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=441.022">So</a>  for the high number, is that also a family of four from the previous slide, I'm assuming? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=445.943">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=446.023">Yeah,</a>  this is a family of four. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=447.404">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=447.724">No,</a>  but the area median, yeah, that's also a family of four. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=450.464">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=450.744">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=451.244">Gotcha.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=451.865">Great</a>  question.</p>

    <p>[Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=457.346">Moving</a>  on to Medford's housing characteristics, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=461.717">The</a>  majority of the household size is a 2% household followed by a 3% household. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=467.4">So</a>  we add them together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=469.121">So</a>  64% of the households consist of one to two person, while we only have 15% of the units that are studio or one bedroom units. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=477.946">So</a>  this seems to be a mismatch between the household size and the unit size. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=484.149">Similarly,</a>  36% of the households consists of three or more persons, but we only have <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=491.072">but</a>  we have like 85% of the units that are two or more bedrooms, so which is clearly a mismatch between household size and unit size. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=503.455">In</a>  terms of housing types, majority of the housing types are townhouses or two to four family units followed by single family, and then we have multifamily units and five or more units per building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=523.081">Looking</a>  at the housing occupancy, 95% of Medford's housing are occupied, out of which 53% of them are owner-occupied and 47% are renter-occupied. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=538.847">Looking</a>  at housing affordability, 29% of Medford residents are housing cost burdened, which means these households spend more than 30% of their income on housing cost. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=551.633">If</a>  you look more closely, 16% of them are moderating cost burden, which means that they spend over 30% and less than 50% of their income. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=564.241">And</a>  those that are severely cost burdened are 13% of the households that spend over 50% of their income. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=574.288">It</a>  will affect housing cost burden by income level. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=577.664">nearly</a>  70% of extremely low and very low income households are housing cost burden. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=584.473">This</a>  is almost 80% of Medford's total households and nearly 44% of low or moderate income households are also housing cost burden. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=599.758">And</a>  proportion of cost-burdened households by tenure, it's the renter-occupied households that are cost-burdened more than the owner-occupied households. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=612.377">The</a>  Massachusetts state has a, the Massachusetts state's housing agency has a subsidized housing inventory which allows municipalities to measure the housing, affordability housing stock. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=625.042">So</a>  Medford currently has a total of 2,433 affordable units on the state subsidized housing inventory, which accounts to 98% of the affordable housing stock that are rental units, while only 2% of them are ownership. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=642.846">Medford</a>  would require to produce 132 more units to reach the 10% affordability target. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=655.472">As</a>  you may be aware, Medford has a housing production plan which outlines various housing strategies that would enable us to produce more housing, specifically affordable housing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=667.558">And</a>  one of the strategies was to establish a municipal <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=670.909">affordable</a>  housing trust, which we have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=674.971">And</a>  the action plan has also outlined one of the strategies that the trust could consider, which is examine affordable infill on city-owned lands and, when appropriate, develop affordable housing on city-owned lands. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=694.023">This</a>  is something that the trust could consider when the trust develops its own action plan as well.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=703.073">Last</a>  but not the least, we have various housing resources, housing toolbox, a great source to understand our client.</p>

    <p>[Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=715.557">DataTown</a>  has resources on housing data, and then there's Max Housing Partnerships guidebook and operation manual to operate affordable housing trust. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=727.922">And</a>  we also, the city has a page on affordable housing trust. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=733.307">This</a>  presentation will be uploaded on the webpage if you'd like to refer in the future. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=739.812">Yeah,</a>  this was a short presentation, but we also plan on inviting a staff from Mass Housing Partnership for our next meeting so we can have one-on-one training on how to operate equitable housing first.</p>

    <p>[ea2kg9eBURI_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=814.687">Thanks</a>  for sharing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=815.347">Yeah,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001763_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=849.601">Hi,</a>  I'm Lisa's son. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=851.363">I</a>  have a pretty similar education background to you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=855.626">I</a>  have a master's in architecture and also a master's in urban planning. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=860.27">But</a>  I'm particularly passionate about environmental justice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=864.233">So</a>  having resilient communities against climate change means thinking about the environment, like the fiscal environment, but also the economics of it and the people who are <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=877.048">getting</a>  basically the brunt of it are the ones who can't afford it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=883.852">So</a>  that's what I am passionate about.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=996.195">So</a>  it's not, whoever you work for is not an affordable housing developer, but they do mixed income levels?</p>

    <p>[Maria D'Orsi]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1001.878">They</a>  were at one point an affordable housing developer, 100% affordable, and then the 80s programs changed and focused a lot on mixed income, so 25% percent <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1014.467">level,</a>  sometimes 40 B's. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1016.669">So</a>  yeah, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1222.159">I've</a>  been, I have been a renter, I'm lucky to be a homeowner, and I hear from all walks of life, the issues that our residents are facing from our seniors to our low income, to our students trying to find housing, to our people who want to downsize. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1237.577">So</a>  I'm very interested in trying to do what we can to hammer up the needle. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1244.349">And</a>  thank you for all taking your time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1246.19">I</a>  know we're going to meet monthly, and we really appreciate you being on this board with us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1250.133">So</a>  it seems like it's Medford residents who work in Medford and Somerville, so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1258.939">Not</a>  too far. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1259.539">So</a>  we're ready for a vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1263.041">Good.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1265.363">We'll</a>  go on to number two. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1266.604">Like</a>  I said, we're going to try to meet monthly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1268.745">That's</a>  our goal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1270.599">We're</a>  hoping to meet the first Wednesday of each month, and we have some options for times. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1275.581">We</a>  have 5.30 to 7 or 6 to 7.30. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1278.302">We</a>  can set a time that works for everybody, or we can do it by plan, but we'll be able to just block out your first Wednesday of the month. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1289.692">and</a>  it's hard to get here by 5.30, just speak up and we'll make sure we go to 6.00.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001729_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1294.973">I</a>  was going to say, it'll be a little difficult for me to get here by 5.30, but I could definitely get here by 6.00, 6.30. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1302.095">If</a>  6.00 says has to be, I can do it by then. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1304.035">I</a>  would prefer the 6.00.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1305.876">So</a>  5.30 is up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1306.516">Press</a>  that up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1307.916">We're</a>  going to try to meet between 6.00 and 6.30, depending on if we need an hour, an hour and a half, a few hours. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1313.438">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1316.85">One</a>  thing we do have to do, and I don't know if that'll be today or not, but we have designated officers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1323.772">An</a>  affordable housing trust can include a chair, a vice chair, a treasurer, and clerk, which a clerk is optional. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1332.355">The</a>  chair facilitates the meeting, guides the trust activities and meeting agenda, makes sure agreed tasks are carried out, ensures decisions are carried out, delegates tasks, and so on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1343.169">The</a>  vice chair assumes the role and responsibilities of the chair in her absence. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1348.254">Treasurer</a>  works with the city's treasurer to set up a trust fund account, maintain financial records, and report it to the trust. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1355.12">The</a>  city's treasurer will have access to the trust financial records, and the trust treasurer will act as an intermediary between the trust and the city's treasurer department. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1363.488">And</a>  the clerk, which is optional, is responsible for taking and circulating minutes, preparing agendas for meetings, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1369.173">in</a>  consultation with the chair, distributing information to members. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1373.035">This</a>  is an optional role. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1374.116">The</a>  city staff will also support the trust's administrative work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1379.418">I</a>  request that the trustees think about all the different roles and your potential interests in taking up any of these above roles. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1387.002">And</a>  you can inform a DP over the next month or next week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1391.865">It</a>  looks like a week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1392.905">So</a>  hopefully in the next couple of weeks, we can see who's interested in which roles. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1396.692">and</a>  vote on that next time.</p>

    <p>[Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1398.293">Please</a>  feel free to write to me if you're interested in any of these rules.</p>

    <p>[Penelope Taylor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1401.914">Can</a>  I just ask a clarifying question? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1405.255">I</a>  believe I read that municipal employees cannot be the treasurer of this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1409.437">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1413.458">I'm</a>  not too sure.</p>

    <p>[Penelope Taylor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1415.099">Okay,</a>  yeah, so you just double check for that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1420.321">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1420.921">That</a>  leaves one or two options.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1427.331">I</a>  wonder whether that's intended set specific municipal employees of the municipality.</p>

    <p>[Penelope Taylor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1433.694">Yeah,</a>  that clarification would be super helpful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1436.916">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1437.576">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1438.176">OK,</a>  we'll get that answer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1440.978">But</a>  you all have a DPC email, so if you're interested in any of those positions, please let her know in the next week or so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1448.981">Any</a>  questions about how meetings will be run or on any of those positions? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1456.721">We're</a>  going to go into number four, establishing working groups. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1460.784">The</a>  trust could have two working groups that can meet once in two weeks to work on the following draft of the Declaration of Trust. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1469.529">The</a>  trust can execute the Declaration of Trust, which includes the trust's authority, rules, and regulations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1475.673">The</a>  trust should be reported to the Registry of Deeds. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1478.075">While</a>  the declaration is not legally required by statute, it is recommended. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1481.878">The</a>  report declaration will provide notice of establishment of the trust and its power and authority to hold and convey title to real estate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1489.604">A</a>  declaration is required when a housing trust applies any interest in real property by deed, restriction, or mortgage. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1497.169">The</a>  declaration of trust must be reviewed by a legal counsel. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1501.001">The</a>  board can set up a working group of one to two trustees who can draft a declaration. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1505.503">Once</a>  reviewed by the full board, the declaration should be reviewed by a legal counsel before reporting the declaration. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1513.007">Trustee</a>  suggestions, Gail Lessen has legal background and could be one of the board members.</p>

    <p>[Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1523.006">Yeah,</a>  no, that's great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1524.466">Yeah,</a>  we do have examples of other communities, so I'm happy to share them with you.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1530.148">I</a>  think you support in any way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1534.389">We</a>  won't put pressure on you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1540.031">With</a>  the development strategy action plan.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1543.438">Creating</a>  an action plan can illustrate the board's goals and priorities, usually for a period of one to five years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1550.244">Mass</a>  Housing Partnership, or MHP, a quasi-public agency, suggested that we have an action plan for a period of two years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1558.891">Communities</a>  have drafted an action plan in-house, forming a working group, subcommittee, and others have hired consultants to draft an action plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1565.997">MHP</a>  recommends that we draft a two-year action plan in-house with two to three achievable goals. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1574.947">So</a>  those are the two working groups that are being suggested that would probably, again, take another week to review. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1582.29">And</a>  if you're interested in any, please email Adeepi.</p>

    <p>[Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1585.771">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1586.091">And</a>  we'll try to get probably three member working groups.</p>

    <p>[Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1590.353">Yeah,</a>  four members will form a quorum. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1592.774">So</a>  maximum of three. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1594.495">Two</a>  to three members. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1595.875">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1596.836">And</a>  probably to draft a declaration of maybe two members maximum, and then three for strategic plan development. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1606.211">and</a>  we probably guess that working groups can meet more than once a month so that we can report back to the trust.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1617.476">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1620.597">Any</a>  questions there? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1621.437">We</a>  didn't see none. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1625.419">Five,</a>  we have finances. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1627.62">A,</a>  funding sources. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1629.08">The</a>  trust will have to identify funding sources to support the trust's activities and goals. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1634.657">and</a>  B, CPA funding application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1637.157">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1637.958">Teresa</a>  DuPont, our CPA grant manager will, she's gonna briefly talk about CPA funding and how these funds can support the trust's rural housing goals and initiatives. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1648.359">And</a>  then DP will provide a status update on the CPA application that we have and next steps. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1653.64">Yes,</a>  Teresa.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1654.721">Hi,</a>  everybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1656.061">So</a>  I just wanna give like a quick elevator pitch on what CPA is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1660.041">If</a>  you're familiar with it, I'm really, really sorry, tune me out for the next 30 seconds. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1663.737">So</a>  Community Preservation Act funding, as Roberta mentioned, it was voted in here in Medford in 2015 by a ballot and implemented in 2017-ish. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1677.363">This</a>  funding comes from a surcharge on top of folks' property taxes, about 1.5% right now, which at the end of all of it, the math ends up being around $2 million each year that we can reinvest back into community projects. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1692.627">So</a>  it's a local tax that's raised locally, and we spend it locally. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1696.789">We</a>  invest it locally, all local. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1699.45">The</a>  three areas that we can spend CPA funding on is historic preservation, open space and recreation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1706.534">So</a>  if you've seen all these beautiful big park projects happening, CPA was very much involved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1712.557">And</a>  the third one, more important to this group, is affordable housing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1717.039">So</a>  CPA, in our young, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1722.46">time</a>  together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1724.04">We</a>  have funded housing projects that include like the Walking Port redevelopment that's happening. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1729.241">We've</a>  created some systems at Lepree's Village. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1733.422">We</a>  have funded three condos, affordable ownership condos that are being put in on Bell's Way West. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1741.503">I'm</a>  hoping that those wrap up sometime this fall. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1744.724">And</a>  then we also have been funding our housing support resource programs for housing families, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1752.073">So</a>  like our rental arrears and moving startup funding assistance programs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1759.195">So</a>  that's what we've done with housing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1760.836">We're</a>  really excited about the housing trust because I think this is a vehicle that gives a little bit more, you know, oomph behind it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1768.778">So</a>  how CPA funds can be used on the affordable trust side of things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1775.16">The</a>  three real big things when it comes to how you can spend CPA money is on acquisition, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1780.867">preservation,</a>  creation, and support. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1786.271">I</a>  kind of, and maybe Roberta can have an opinion on this, but preservation and support, it kind of can muddle the lines.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1796.219">Yeah,</a>  so acquisition is easy, creation is easy to understand, but support means to help households be able to access housing they can afford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1810.398">So</a>  that's a very specific kind of support. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1813.941">So</a>  we use it for rental assistance and we have a move-in assistance program in Medford to help pay first to last month rent so that people can access apartments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1827.073">So</a>  that's what the support category is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1831.056">And</a>  the preserve category is tricky with affordable housing because it's <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1838.992">We're</a>  only supposed to use a CPA fund to preserve affordable housing if it was created with CPA in the first place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1845.896">So</a>  we're not supposed to use CPA funds to fix housing authority billings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1853.122">That's</a>  not the purpose of CPA. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1856.684">We're</a>  supposed to use it to create more affordable housing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1861.007">expanding,</a>  but if we, for example, we used it to build the units at Bellsman West, if in 15 years from now something was in disrepair and they needed to put more funds back into those buildings, they could use it to preserve those buildings.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1882.817">One</a>  couple of just notes to throw out there early about CPA is any property acquired <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1890.378">or</a>  bills with CPA dollars must have a perpetual deed restriction on it, which is another way for us to protect our affordable housing inventory here in the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1900.421">In</a>  perpetuity. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1903.142">In</a>  perpetuity.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1904.042">Perpetual,</a>  yeah, sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1905.363">I</a>  messed up that word. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1907.003">Oh,</a>  no, just, yeah, because I think in the past, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1910.895">Back</a>  in the day, there weren't any. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1914.096">We</a>  need to make sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1915.136">Especially</a>  this board needs to make sure.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1917.857">And</a>  that might be a task that the board addresses, because we do have inventory on our subsidized housing inventory, SHI listing, that, as the mayor alluded, had deep restrictions, but they were only for 15 to 20 years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1931.821">So</a>  we've got a couple next year that are falling off of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1935.943">As</a>  they try, you know, it's not a whole heck of a lot, but it's still it's sad to lose any units. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1940.426">But</a>  the 38 we don't measure somebody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1942.808">And</a>  I feel like it's it's one of the extensions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1945.55">The</a>  water's clean. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1948.732">But,</a>  you know, there's another one coming up in like twenty, thirty two, which three this one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1952.695">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1953.136">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1953.396">So</a>  we just you know, CPA could be used to help protect that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1958.119">I'm</a>  not exactly sure how it would look like, but if there's dollars that need to be spent for preserving those restrictions and sending them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1965.522">CPA</a>  could be used for that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1966.723">We</a>  have rules from the Department of Revenue on what we can spend the funding on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1973.288">So</a>  any funding that does go to the trust would have to be very carefully recorded, the files and record keeping and everything like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1979.673">But</a>  I would be working with whomever the treasurer is and whatnot for helping keep that straight. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1990.101">So</a>  if there's any questions on CPA, I know that was a little bit longer than 30 seconds, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1995.302">Good.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1996.902">Any</a>  questions? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=1997.583">I</a>  don't know what that is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2000.643">I'll</a>  leave my cards with everybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2002.163">So</a>  even if you have a question over the weekend, I'll shoot me an email. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2004.784">I'm</a>  happy to take that up.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2008.145">Unfortunately,</a>  Aditi, thank you, President Bears, for being here with us.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2011.846">Oh,</a>  sure.</p>

    <p>[Penelope Taylor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2013.506">I</a>  was holding my phone at that age. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2017.607">Pay</a>  attention. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2018.467">I</a>  was like, CPA. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2019.187">I've</a>  never heard of it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2024.038">Yes,</a>  CPA has been great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2025.259">We've</a>  got a lot of projects done at CPA. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2027.72">Thank</a>  you, Teresa. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2028.981">Thanks</a>  for being here and being supportive.</p>

    <p>[Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2032.143">And</a>  speaking of CPA, CPC put out a funding application in July. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2039.958">And</a>  on behalf of the trust, I went ahead and filled out a form to determine our eligibility, the trust's eligibility. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2047.104">So</a>  that was the first round of the application form. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2050.646">And</a>  in September 1st week, there's a full application form that's due. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2056.051">So</a>  we're hoping that the trust can apply and receive CPA funds. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2062.295">So</a>  the initial application that I put out was requesting funds for $250,000. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2070.302">I'm</a>  hoping that by September 10th, we can fill out a full application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2077.085">And</a>  I'm happy to have a draft out there and share with the trustees for my feedback. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2085.349">As</a>  a follow-up question to Roberta's comment on support as <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2091.933">one</a>  of the CPA categories to support affordable housing, can we use CPA funds to develop an action plan for the trust?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2101.276">Oh,</a>  that's a very good question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2102.657">That</a>  would fall under the CPA and admin category. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2108.558">So</a>  we have a very limited amount of funding that can be used for activities that help to determine how to spend CPA funds. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2119.985">And</a>  that's in the admin category. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2122.348">So</a>  we don't have a lot of admin funding available, but we could see how much we have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2129.438">That</a>  would be a qualifying expense for admin.</p>

    <p>[Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2134.345">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2135.87">given</a>  that the trust doesn't have an action plan yet, but the CDA on funding applications due next month, just wondering how can we fill out the application form?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2149.056">There</a>  is no application form for admin. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2151.958">Admin</a>  doesn't have to go through the application and accounts approval process. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2159.081">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2159.481">So</a>  that's a direct decision by the <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2165.005">It's</a>  been made by the CPA manager, by the CPA officers, or the CPC officers, or just by the CPC as a whole. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2175.052">Depending</a>  on the amount that we are agreeing to spend, different parties will have discretion to make that decision.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2186.881">And</a>  as for the full application, I know we're very young. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2191.524">Inaugural</a>  meeting happening right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2194.196">I</a>  would think that the committee would acknowledge that in the application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2199.117">Some</a>  of our applications that come through, we're really deep diving into the details with this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2205.219">Again,</a>  it's not up to me, it's up to the committee, but I think that they would factor in the very newness of this group into the application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2213.821">And</a>  we'll have presentations in October, so maybe by that time we'll have a little bit more meat that we can discuss on the group, and then you can share that during the presentations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2224.065">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2225.366">But</a>  it can be a little bit more open-ended for things we might decide to do or talk about doing in October, November, December and into the future. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2233.81">Hopefully</a>  just get a lot of money to have some spending ability, right?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2238.472">And</a>  again, up to the committee, but I feel like I know that they're very supportive of this group and the work that we're going to be doing here, so.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2246.276">I</a>  just want to know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2248.057">Lisa</a>  asked. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2249.117">Oh,</a>  Lisa, yes, sorry.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2251.736">Yeah,</a>  no, no, no, thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2253.477">Um,</a>  just to clarify and question actually, maybe 3. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2257.981">I</a>  think I heard an applications due in September for the CPA CPA monies. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2263.625">Um,</a>  and I think I heard them the amount 250,000 dollars. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2270.59">I</a>  assume this could be wrong, but when you're doing an application, there has to be some sort of idea on what you're going to spend the funding on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2281.494">And</a>  as I heard, I'm sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2284.452">I</a>  forget her name from the CPC. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2290.353">Teresa,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2291.293">I</a>  almost called her Terry, so I knew it was a T, I'm sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2295.554">Anyways,</a>  I think I heard that you're already funding other nonprofits through the CPC application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2303.216">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2305.096">That</a>  is correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2306.577">Rental</a>  arrears, startups, when we're filling out an application for the trust, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2317.338">do</a>  we have an idea on what we would be using the $250,000? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2320.24">I</a>  mean, $250,000 is, if we're gonna look to help with development, $250,000 is not a lot of money for development, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2323.683">I</a>  mean, it's, I mean, in Somerville, we're doing, there's a lot, it costs a lot of money right now for development. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2329.867">So</a>  I'm just kind of wondering, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2345.193">where</a>  the 250 came from and if there was an idea on what it would be used for. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2352.935">And</a>  I know we're early on in the process, but September is going to be here soon, right?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2362.997">I</a>  can answer definitely the first part of your question there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2366.277">The</a>  250 kind of came out because in CPA land, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2370.31">We</a>  have to spend a minimum of 10% for each of those three categories I mentioned. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2375.175">So</a>  based on our budgeting that we allocate, we actually allocated 15% this year towards affordable housing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2383.143">So</a>  the 250 is almost what we've kind of allocated for housing anyway is our minimum. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2390.083">It</a>  also does, this is pure happenstance, that it aligns with what a lot of other communities have done for their housing trusts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2397.83">I</a>  think it was Lincoln, Harvard, Genoa, not local, but those are examples I was able to dig up, that when their affordable housing trust first applied, it was also for about $200 to $250. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2408.779">So</a>  I hear you that it's not a whole heck of a lot of money, but it's something to at least get us started, to get something in the bank. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2420.512">As</a>  for not being able to necessarily identify exact tasks or assignments, if you will, for what this trust is going to do, I think that we're just in a tough spot right now, but I think for the sake of the application, if we can identify a couple of items that we're going to come out the gate with, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2443.102">in</a>  terms of tackling, I think that that would be sufficient. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2445.743">I</a>  do also happen to have one of my chairperson here right now who maybe has other opinions, but I will see the floor.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2451.344">I</a>  just wanted to point out that we have, that the CPC has in the past banked housing, money for affordable housing, but when they didn't have an applicant that round, they just carved off money and said, we'll use this in the future.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2468.809">So</a>  I see this as a similar thing.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2475.807">money</a>  and saying that we'll use it in the future, even though it won't buy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2479.569">It's</a>  a start, and potentially it will double it before we even have a concrete plan of how to move forward.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2488.054">And</a>  we do have, I think Theresa mentioned that 2.4 million applications have come in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2496.457">for</a>  the CPA funding, and we have only have 2 million to disperse. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2500.678">So</a>  the committee is going to have to make those decisions in September, October, November. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2506.24">But</a>  yeah, this is a good start, considering we have so many applicants with a number of projects, many of which are city-method projects, too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2516.302">So,</a>  yes.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2518.243">Did</a>  I answer your question, Lisa?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2522.845">It</a>  doesn't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2523.406">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2524.246">Just</a>  trying to like wrap my head around it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2526.808">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Penelope Taylor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2527.829">Yeah,</a>  I just, um, is the due date September 1st or 10th? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2533.333">Okay,</a>  cool. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2533.834">I</a>  love the deadline. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2535.115">So</a>  that's good to know.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2536.035">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2536.336">It's</a>  on Monday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2536.756">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Penelope Taylor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2536.916">The</a>  Monday after Labor Day.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2546.756">It</a>  sounds as though to complete that application, what will be most helpful would be for you to draft the application and then the committee can all or the trust board can all review the draft and make comments and updates to it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2565.554">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2566.295">I</a>  can also help guide you through it too.</p>

    <p>[Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2568.837">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2569.557">because</a>  we don't have, the trust doesn't have an action plan yet, and I assume it will be at least end of the year for us to come up with a complete set of strategies and goals.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2579.423">Of</a>  course. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2580.703">Just</a>  be careful not to wiggle the meeting along.</p>

    <p>[Maria D'Orsi]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2584.206">I</a>  was going to say, you can't email it to us and we can't all comment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2587.307">No,</a>  you know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2588.068">It</a>  would be in our meeting packet.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2590.069">In</a>  your meeting, yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2590.709">In</a>  our meeting packet, and then we have one meeting in which to discuss it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2594.371">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2594.612">Yep,</a>  yep. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2595.012">That's</a>  what I'm saying.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2597.322">Yeah,</a>  it's a little time because with September 1st, Monday, 4th, 1st, Wednesday.</p>

    <p>[Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2602.685">Yeah,</a>  so September 4th, we ideally have the next meeting.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2607.468">Yeah,</a>  but you don't need to finalize. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2611.85">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2612.09">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2612.23">So</a>  I think if you have ideas or, you know, something that someone's done or a different community, send them to what you think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2618.213">You</a>  can organize them into what the draft. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2621.435">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2622.015">We</a>  have a final reading. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2623.937">We'll</a>  be able to get in our packet a week prior. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2627.128">And</a>  then we have a final discussion on and on and forth.</p>

    <p>[Penelope Taylor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2629.612">So</a>  I think it lines up pretty nicely. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2630.994">Are</a>  you able to share what you submitted before? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2634.84">Just</a>  I think you said you had to upload it or share it with like, is it just kind of a placeholder paragraph or like what's out there already?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2642.216">It's</a>  an eligibility, eligibility determination form. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2647.219">So</a>  that's just, it's like a one and a half page just to make sure that your, your project can be eligible for CPA. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2653.803">If</a>  somebody comes and says, Hey, I want to buy an ice cream truck. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2656.205">That's</a>  not an appropriate use, but somebody wants to establish an affordable housing trust. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2661.028">So</a>  just to prevent people, have you ever written a grant where it's like, you've gotten all the way to the end? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2665.071">And</a>  I said, Oh, you can't do that.</p>

    <p>[Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2666.371">I</a>  didn't share that at all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2668.233">That's</a>  a reading package.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2669.634">I</a>  hope it makes sense.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2673.408">have</a>  any questions or comments from the board. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2703.983">reviewing</a>  city-owned parcels to see what's available. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2707.246">I</a>  like the idea of trying to build some affordable housing on some. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2711.349">I</a>  also like the idea of selling some lots so that we can, the sale proceeds can go into the trust. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2717.494">So</a>  that is something, I just signed up the contract on that recently. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2720.757">Those</a>  are some of the ideas of what we could do with the 250,000 consultants we could hire to evaluate what other cities and towns have done, give us some bids.</p>

    <p>[Penelope Taylor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2734.654">I</a>  have two questions, I guess, about on the topic of studies, which like you do need that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2741.218">So,</a>  yeah, yeah, I guess. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2747.463">Has</a>  there been a nexus study for housing nexus in Medford?</p>

    <p>[Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2754.187">So</a>  we've been having this conversation because the city of Medford has the linkage program, which includes <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2762.508">collecting</a>  linkage fee for the development of parks and recreation, police and fire, water and sewer, roads and transportation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2775.673">We</a>  have an act that establishes this linkage program, which includes affordable housing, but we do not have that in our ordinance yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2784.496">The</a>  City Council brought this up a couple of months ago to include affordable housing linkage. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2791.108">but</a>  we were also trying to see if we can update the existing linkage fee as well as include equitable housing linkage along with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2799.874">So</a>  to conduct a Nexus study, it would cost us nearly $200,000 at this point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2805.058">So</a>  we are figuring out how to identify the funding to do this Nexus study. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2810.261">Yeah,</a>  we've been in touch with a couple of consultants who are willing to do this, but it's sort of a conversation that's ongoing.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2817.28">And</a>  I think it was a certain amount of money to include affordable housing in linkage. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2822.024">And</a>  then another portion of money to update all the accounts we already have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2827.148">So</a>  that's something maybe this committee can put in our application as a possibility of how to spend it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2832.952">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2833.573">So</a>  if they were to include affordable housing linkage, so that would amount to $16,000 roughly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2840.818">But</a>  updating the entire program would amount to nearly $200,000.</p>

    <p>[Penelope Taylor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2845.877">Understood.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2847.318">And</a>  then if I could, if there's a follow-up question, another study that was mentioned, I think in the health and production plan, just kind of to check in on the analysis of impediments to fair housing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2857.442">It</a>  said the most recent one had been 2012. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2858.963">I</a>  guess I was just wondering if since that report came out, if one's happened or if that's still something on our list, to-do list.</p>

    <p>[Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2866.706">I'm</a>  not too sure, but I think that's something on our list.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2869.167">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2869.747">Thanks</a>  so much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2870.207">That's</a>  helpful.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2874.005">I</a>  think the home consortium might be working on something that's regional in nature. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2878.647">I</a>  don't know if that's a good question to ask them, since they're working on a, is it a consolidated plan they're working on now?</p>

    <p>[Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2885.049">Yes,</a>  there's a consolidated plan, a five-year plan that NSE is working on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2888.69">Yeah,</a>  and it's just, the PICOF meeting was today, so we'll have to wait to know what that entails.</p>

    <p>[Penelope Taylor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2893.412">Amazing,</a>  and last moving forward for this, they just approved, I think, an Office of Fair Housing, so I think there will be a lot more happening around that, but anyway, okay, thank you, Sharon.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2900.275">And</a>  we're missing only two, and we can maybe also, and then I'll just speak <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2904.517">We</a>  can also state in the application maybe for some matching money because the $5 billion bill just got signed yesterday by the governor and then Senator Warren had a very big press conference last week with money she's going to be <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2922.928">trying</a>  to get to cities and towns which is going to be pretty broad and open-ended like how do you how can you increase and support affordable housing and there's going to be it's going to be pretty open-ended for us so I don't know it could be any matching money we need for any of anything that's coming down the pipeline but um all good news on on that front so uh and maybe after reversing maybe you can just explain to the committee what the home is so that everybody's educated</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2951.794">Okay,</a>  so two things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2953.015">First</a>  of all, the nexus study would not be an eligible use of CPA funds. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2959.278">So</a>  I like to be serious to look at other directions for where to get funding for that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2965.881">And</a>  then queuing up Danielle talking about the whole consortium. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2969.843">I'm</a>  curious what the timeline is for the consolidated plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2974.885">And</a>  to, I think it'd be useful for this board to know <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2980.893">how</a>  their funding could align with funding that we have to support the same projects?</p>

    <p>[Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=2992.361">To</a>  respond to Roberta's question, the timeline for the consolidated plan is February next year, based on all these meetings, and they plan to finalize it by May 2025. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3006.13">I</a>  think the first draft is in February.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3008.872">Okay,</a>  yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3011.073">and</a>  Daniela who's the new planner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3012.735">I'm</a>  sorry I was late, I had a meeting about the board meeting that I was having. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3017.239">So</a>  the home consortium, so the city of Medford is part of the North Suburban Home Consortium, which is comprised of eight communities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3027.427">So</a>  it's Medford, Malden, Everett, Chelsea, Arlington, Melrose, what am I forgetting? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3036.636">Revere.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3037.396">Revere.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3040.656">What's</a>  the other one? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3041.697">Oh,</a>  WinFIRST. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3043.057">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3044.138">So</a>  basically, those eight communities basically get an allocation from HUD based on a formula. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3057.166">I</a>  think Medgar probably brings the lion's share of the funds there, but it's all pooled. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3062.869">And</a>  so it's any developer, mostly nonprofit developers, comes to the consortium and can apply for funding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3072.32">There</a>  are many of those state communities and it's rolling, so you can come anytime and ask. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3079.604">So</a>  if the funding cycle for the trust is rolling, then they can be aligned pretty well.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3090.071">One</a>  of the projects in Medford that the home is supporting or did support is the three units that are being built on the Bellsway, and you can actually see them being built right now, structures up.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3101.418">And</a>  Walgreens is going to get some of the home ARP, which I'm very glad. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3107.942">I</a>  encourage them to apply for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3109.643">If</a>  they haven't yet, don't apply for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3111.624">That's</a>  fine.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3120.849">That's</a>  a question that I would need to think about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3123.631">CPA</a>  funds can be used as pre-development for a development project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3129.434">So</a>  if we're certain <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3131.244">that</a>  those city-owned lots are candidates for developing affordable housing, then yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3137.227">If</a>  we're not certain, then that might fall into the administrative funding category.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3142.49">And</a>  when you say it cannot be used for the NEXUS study, does that mean just increasing <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3152.198">review</a>  of increasing the buckets we already have and could we use it for the $60,000 just to add affordable housing to the linkage?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3163.842">So</a>  seed money to help us make more money for affordable housing doesn't fit into any of the categories for CPA. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3173.786">Acquire,</a>  create, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3176.02">support</a>  households to access housing they can afford, but that really has to be tied to specific households or to preserve or restore.</p>

    <p>[Penelope Taylor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3187.65">Is</a>  there already a map of the lots?</p>

    <p>[Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3191.133">We've</a>  identified two or three lots. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3194.796">Yes,</a>  but there's a huge inventory, but they've not identified to build affordable housing yet.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3200.441">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3201.248">We</a>  have a listing of, and I received it recently from the assessing office of all municipal owned lots, so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3207.753">Okay,</a>  yeah, okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3209.314">And</a>  it's a couple pages long. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3213.416">And</a>  another piece is the inclusionary zoning that was passed, and I believe finalized and passed in 2019. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3220.181">So</a>  it's been five years, so that's something maybe we could pick up, not even necessarily with CPA money, but just reviewing that and seeing how we can strengthen it without deterring development. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3230.775">Um,</a>  yeah, I always, I always talk to Danielle about, about how a developer will do build one home and the next six months, six months for them, buy another home and, and, you know, start developing that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3244.705">And</a>  it just goes on and on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3245.926">So</a>  I always in mind when they do that 15 home or 10 home, that one should be affordable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3251.27">And</a>  so that's one way I'd really love to strengthen it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3253.972">Cause</a>  we have developers that can do flip a two family home and another two family and another two family, but never. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3260.617">add</a>  to our affordable housing stock. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3262.218">And</a>  I think that's something that needs to be looked into.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3265.439">And</a>  I'd like to see us being able to do fractional payments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3268.9">So</a>  a lot of times, so if they round up, but the way that developers will plan a project and they'll, you know, cut off enough units where they don't have to round up because of the entire factory unit, you know, it's, you know, a big chunk of change that they're subsidizing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3286.968">But</a>  if say it was, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3289.34">you</a>  know, fractional payments, just pay like 10%, I'd say it was, it rounds up, say 6.1 units divided when you do the math, our organization has to round up to seven, so they'll reduce their unit count, so they only have to get six even. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3308.825">Yeah,</a>  so it'd be a lot of fractional payment, that could be some funds I could come to trust.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3321.035">So</a>  good ideas.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3321.935">Let's</a>  start again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3326.537">If</a>  there's no other questions or comments or ideas, we have a few tasks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3331.839">Like</a>  we stated, so you're gonna let a DP know if you have any interest in the chair, vice chair, treasurer, or potential clerk. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3342.362">You're</a>  gonna let a DP know of any ideas you might have for the CPA funding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3348.701">and</a>  whether or not you want to be the one or two members to help draft the declaration of trust, or the one, two, three members to help develop a strategy action plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3359.166">So</a>  within the next week, maybe two, please email DPM and let her know if there's any interest in any of those. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3367.709">Otherwise,</a>  please hold September 4th at 6 p.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3371.871">If</a>  we change that to 6.30, we'll let you know, but please hold 6 p.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3375.173">to</a>  7.30 <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3378.359">is</a>  no further comment or question on anything that's listed on the agenda, then I'll await a motion to adjourn. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3387.208">So</a>  moved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3388.409">Motion</a>  to adjourn, seconded by Kayla and Penny. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3396.314">Motion</a>  to adjourn by Kayla, seconded by Penny. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3399.235">All</a>  those, actually there's somebody on Zoom and I haven't been learning everybody's name by tonight, so I'll call the roll on the motion to adjourn. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-07-24&start=3408.216">Kayla.</a> </p>
