Councilor saying present present row, present seven present zero absent, please rise to salute the flag.

7
00:00:48,978 --> 00:00:49,598
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

8
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:09,770
Yes.

9
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,050
Yes.

10
00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:10,771
Yes.

11
00:01:12,212 --> 00:01:12,452
Yes.

12
00:01:20,717 --> 00:01:22,158
Yes, seven affirmative, zero negative.

13
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:23,758
The rules are suspended.

14
00:01:23,778 --> 00:01:27,900
22-381, petition for zoning amendment.

15
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:47,569
The undersigned property owners of the parcels located at 222-230-236 Boston Avenue and 67 North Street comprising approximately 1.4 acres petition to change the current zoning designation from industrial to office two as rewritten in the zoning bylaws.

16
00:01:49,129 --> 00:01:55,912
signed for each address 222 Boston Ave, 230 Boston Ave, 236 Boston Ave, and 67 North Street, John Walsh.

17
00:01:56,192 --> 00:02:00,454
I do believe we have members here who would like to present on the petition.

18
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,199
Name and address for the record, please.

19
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,060
John Walsh, 222 Boston Ave, Medford.

20
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:17,341
Thank you, please go ahead.

21
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:26,835
Good evening, President Morrell, city council members, and Medford residents.

22
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:35,301
My name is John Walsh, and I'm a petitioner for amending the zoning map to include four parcels located on Boston Avenue.

23
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:40,924
All would be within the newly created Office 2 Zoning District.

24
00:02:41,965 --> 00:02:46,488
As the petition reflects, the parcels included 222, 230, 236 Boston Avenue, and 67 North Street.

25
00:02:52,098 --> 00:03:04,841
I am the president, treasurer of the Elizabeth Grady Properties and the managing member of 236 Boston Avenue LLC and 67 North Street LLC and make all decisions.

26
00:03:05,901 --> 00:03:11,463
The parcels mentioned are located in the industrial zone and comprise approximately 1.4 acres.

27
00:03:12,223 --> 00:03:13,323
The sites are contiguous

28
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:24,015
and in close proximity to the newly constructed Midford Tufts Greenline Station, which allows for convenient access to additional public transportation.

29
00:03:25,396 --> 00:03:36,223
With the progressive creation of the new zoning district for the council and other city agencies, the site is now poised for life science among other research and development companies.

30
00:03:37,324 --> 00:03:43,388
The conversion of these parcels from industrial to O2 would allow for more modern buildings

31
00:03:44,687 --> 00:03:57,874
substantial increase in tax revenue and permit fees, gainful employment within the city, and create a mixed use area of the opportunity in that section of the city, along with more green space.

32
00:03:58,854 --> 00:04:05,618
The property locations clearly seem to fit with what was intended by the city creating the O2 district.

33
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:12,361
In conclusion, I respectfully request approval of this petition as an amendment to the zoning map.

34
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:14,372
Thank you for your consideration.

35
00:04:15,072 --> 00:04:15,813
Thank you, Mr. Walsh.

36
00:04:15,893 --> 00:04:16,374
Councilor Knight.

37
00:04:17,314 --> 00:04:19,216
Madam President, this is something I'm very excited about.

38
00:04:19,236 --> 00:04:25,101
This is the first petition that we've seen come before us after our newly codified zoning ordinance.

39
00:04:25,962 --> 00:04:32,687
This is something that we worked on specifically, actually, to create an O2 district so that we could generate life science opportunities here in the community.

40
00:04:33,328 --> 00:04:35,630
Mr. Walsh is a property owner in the community, as he said.

41
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,771
He owns a substantial amount of real estate here in Medford.

42
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,573
He's been a good neighbor, a good taxpayer.

43
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:45,039
Mr wash I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about the revenues that the city will generate down through this process if you could.

44
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:56,734
Some from the analysis and I we've submitted it previously, economic development and community development, the aviation young real estate brokerage firm said.

45
00:04:57,809 --> 00:05:13,674
The property of about 200,000 square foot development, the permitting fees would be in the $3 million range one time, and the tax revenue on a 200,000 square foot building would also exceed $3 million per annum.

46
00:05:16,055 --> 00:05:20,096
And can you tell us right now what an estimate is we're getting out of that parcel?

47
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:25,538
Collectively for all four parcels in the neighborhood of about $100,000 plus.

48
00:05:30,737 --> 00:05:39,262
I'm not much of a math guy, but it sounds like quite an investment in quite a worthwhile initiative for this community to look at.

49
00:05:39,902 --> 00:05:44,345
You know, we've talked about our commitment to life sciences, bringing jobs to this community to pay a living wage.

50
00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:52,089
We talked about, you know, the need to diversify our CIP in residential districts to keep us

51
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:59,077
competitive with a strong commercial tax base so that I residential property or there's not burdened with balancing the tax tax burden on their back.

52
00:05:59,618 --> 00:06:03,099
I think this project makes sense, Madam President, I support it wholeheartedly will prove.

53
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:05,801
Thank you.

54
00:06:05,821 --> 00:06:09,923
Thank you, Madam President, join on.

55
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:15,546
I know, um, Cummings is probably going to be right right around the corner.

56
00:06:16,892 --> 00:06:23,857
Are you working collaboratively with them to maybe get into two buildings to maybe have a mirror image so it doesn't look like two separate buildings?

57
00:06:23,957 --> 00:06:25,838
Is that something you're doing?

58
00:06:26,198 --> 00:06:32,462
Yeah, Cummings is in favor of the project and they spoke to Victor as recently as today in favor of it.

59
00:06:33,163 --> 00:06:36,285
But is it going to be like similar in look?

60
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:38,446
So one doesn't look out of place?

61
00:06:38,906 --> 00:06:40,547
I'm sure that they'll blend in their council.

62
00:06:41,228 --> 00:06:41,468
Thank you.

63
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:44,684
Thank you, Madam President.

64
00:06:45,264 --> 00:06:46,645
Thank you, Mr. Walsh for being here.

65
00:06:46,905 --> 00:07:02,894
I think this is an exciting use of those parcels to take advantage of the new office to zone and bring in the commercial development that we've all been talking so much about as a necessary piece of a revenue strategy to effectively fund our city budget, which I'm sure you'll hear about in a moment from me.

66
00:07:04,655 --> 00:07:13,283
Pursuant to Chapter 48, I believe we have to refer this to the Community Development Board, and then we will receive their comments, and then we could consider it after a duly noticed hearing.

67
00:07:14,785 --> 00:07:16,506
At this point, I certainly have no objections.

68
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:24,694
I would motion to refer this to the Community Development Board, and also encourage them to initiate their process and bring it back before us as quickly as they can.

69
00:07:25,775 --> 00:07:25,976
Thank you.

70
00:07:25,996 --> 00:07:26,616
Thank you, Mr. Zimberis.

71
00:07:26,997 --> 00:07:28,218
Any further discussion from the Council?

72
00:07:29,118 --> 00:07:41,124
I just want to reiterate what Park Susan Bair says, this is part of a process that this would be referred to the Community Development Board where they would have meetings, they would give us an opinion, and then we'd vote whether or not to accept this zoning proposal before us.

73
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:44,685
Is there anyone from the public who would like to speak on the proposal in front of us?

74
00:07:49,328 --> 00:07:50,088
Seeing none, so.

75
00:07:51,132 --> 00:07:52,693
Councilor Knight you had a motion to approve.

76
00:07:54,655 --> 00:07:57,798
So on the motion of, I'll just say it because you said it first.

77
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:03,042
On the motion of Councilor Knight to refer to the Community Development Board, seconded by Vice President Behrs.

78
00:08:03,203 --> 00:08:04,584
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

79
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:11,289
Vice President Behrs.

80
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:11,850
Yes.

81
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,011
Councilor Kerrio.

82
00:08:13,271 --> 00:08:13,591
Yes.

83
00:08:13,972 --> 00:08:14,612
Councilor Collins.

84
00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:15,073
Yes.

85
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:15,933
Councilor Knight.

86
00:08:16,154 --> 00:08:16,394
Yes.

87
00:08:16,734 --> 00:08:17,375
Councilor Scarpelli.

88
00:08:17,395 --> 00:08:17,475
Yes.

89
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,070
Can he unmute himself?

90
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,331
He's on there and he's muted.

91
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:24,831
Hang on.

92
00:08:25,531 --> 00:08:29,612
He said he's having a problem with his connection.

93
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:35,594
If you could turn his camera on and indicate which way he's going to vote, that'd be fine too.

94
00:08:44,216 --> 00:08:47,937
I'm going to pass Councillor Scarpelli and go to Councillor Sang, then we'll come back.

95
00:08:53,622 --> 00:08:56,103
President Morrell, I'm gonna call you too, but then we'll get Councilor Scarpelli again.

96
00:08:56,723 --> 00:08:57,003
Yes.

97
00:08:57,623 --> 00:08:57,763
Okay.

98
00:09:02,644 --> 00:09:05,705
Councilor Scarpelli, are you, can you hear us?

99
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:09,586
Are you able to turn on your video to gesture to vote?

100
00:09:09,946 --> 00:09:10,126
Hang on.

101
00:09:10,146 --> 00:09:11,427
Let me text him.

102
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:14,908
I think he says he's having trouble.

103
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,469
We can move it without him.

104
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,991
Yeah, we can count him as absent.

105
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:23,272
Okay.

106
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,673
All right.

107
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:26,995
I'm gonna count him absent for technical reasons.

108
00:09:27,055 --> 00:09:27,615
Okay.

109
00:09:29,397 --> 00:09:32,560
So six in the affirmative, one absent.

110
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:32,980
Yes.

111
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,101
Yes.

112
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:36,543
Thank you.

113
00:09:38,905 --> 00:09:40,787
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

114
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,708
The motion passes.

115
00:09:42,728 --> 00:09:43,349
Thank you for being here.

116
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:44,390
Thank you very much.

117
00:09:48,887 --> 00:10:02,672
Moving to 22 dash three eight four offered by Vice President bears, be it so resolved by the Medford City Council that Vice President presentation regarding the city budget and the FYI 2023 budget crisis by President bears.

118
00:10:05,013 --> 00:10:06,053
Thank you Madam President.

119
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:15,577
I don't normally go without a mask in the chamber but given the fact that I think.

120
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:22,572
This is such an essential topic and maybe people might want to see my lips moving as I speak for a number of minutes.

121
00:10:24,412 --> 00:10:28,393
That's why I've taken my mask off if anyone has questions.

122
00:10:30,774 --> 00:10:34,095
I just want to start before I give my presentation to say that

123
00:10:36,062 --> 00:10:51,733
My attitude as a councilor over the past two terms has been one of collaboration and building trust and bringing this community together to advance shared goals and shared priorities to build a better future for our community.

124
00:10:52,694 --> 00:11:01,560
I think that this council has gone above and beyond to try to work with this mayor and her administration

125
00:11:02,908 --> 00:11:07,470
on a number of issues that run the gamut of all the priorities that we have.

126
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:16,693
And when it comes to this budget process that that return collaboration has not been there.

127
00:11:18,673 --> 00:11:23,095
One of the things that has been really most impactful to me over the past

128
00:11:24,883 --> 00:11:33,729
week, 10 days, two weeks, it's blurring together a little bit, has been just how many people have reached out and communicated that they don't know what's going on.

129
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:37,591
That they're not sure why the city budget is in the position that it's in.

130
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:48,037
They're not sure why suddenly, you know, changes were made to the proposed budget at the last minute that have such significant impacts on so many of our city departments and our public schools.

131
00:11:49,038 --> 00:11:53,681
And that lack of trust or loss of trust

132
00:11:54,804 --> 00:12:04,150
in the integrity and the communication coming from the city administration is going to have impacts going forward.

133
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:05,571
If it isn't repaired.

134
00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:16,379
My goal here is to try to explain from what I know from the budget meetings we've had from the discussions that we've had with city staff.

135
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:29,836
and other entities involved in these decision-making processes, what we know, why things happen the way they happened, and what we can do to ask that they be fixed.

136
00:12:30,976 --> 00:12:45,540
And again, it is essential that the administration take action to restore the trust of this council, to restore the trust of the residents of this community in the information and the integrity of our budget process

137
00:12:46,432 --> 00:13:01,661
And I hope that by providing a shared set of facts that we can all agree on, that sets the table for the next steps of accountability and of making a plan to address these problems.

138
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:11,067
So I'm going to now share my screen and give this presentation.

139
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:15,490
And Vice President Behrs, I will hold you to the rules of the council as far as timing on this.

140
00:13:16,037 --> 00:13:20,420
Yes, if I do run over, I do apologize.

141
00:13:26,323 --> 00:13:27,804
Thank you, Councilor Caraballo.

142
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:30,146
This is the title slide.

143
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:31,587
Medford City Budget Review.

144
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:38,351
Long-term underfunding leads to yearly shortfalls, crumbling infrastructure, and vulnerability to shocks.

145
00:13:40,412 --> 00:13:43,355
The causes of our city's budget crisis go back decades.

146
00:13:44,016 --> 00:13:53,264
The City of Medford does not bring in enough revenue to meet the spending needs for our city services, for public schools, and for the maintenance of city buildings and infrastructure.

147
00:13:54,317 --> 00:14:06,867
There are many reasons why one proposition two and a half limits the growth of the city's main source of revenue property taxes to two and a half percent per year, plus new construction and major renovation also called new growth.

148
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:14,053
That's below the rate of inflation and certainly below the rate at which the cost of a city grow like insurance trash removal and construction costs.

149
00:14:14,934 --> 00:14:19,938
We've also had for a long time a lack of new commercial development that's restricted a major tool to raise revenue.

150
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:23,601
This council has taken action on that with the new zoning ordinance as we just saw.

151
00:14:24,175 --> 00:14:29,599
before this presentation where we are finally bringing in the kind of projects that the city has needed for a long time.

152
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,863
The impacts of our budget crisis are serious and longstanding.

153
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:46,971
We have bare bones budgets and low staffing levels for most of our city departments, like our Department of Public Works or our planning department, our law department, our library, health department and recreation.

154
00:14:47,151 --> 00:14:48,913
We heard a number of those stories tonight.

155
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:53,926
And it means that Medford provides fewer services than our residents deserve.

156
00:14:54,878 --> 00:15:16,697
We've seen a very small real dollar growth to the Medford Public Schools budget after you adjust for inflation, limited purchase of new materials and resources and new staff hires, reliance on fees from families to fund programs, limits on proposals for our educator pay and their union contracts, and years of deferred maintenance that lead to costly repairs.

157
00:15:17,538 --> 00:15:19,880
Some of those deferred maintenance needs we see every day.

158
00:15:21,058 --> 00:15:44,800
huge infrastructure backlog in the hundred million dollar range just for our roads and sidewalks we're paying out thousands of dollars a year and claims for injuries and property damage crumbling city and school buildings, like our fire headquarters, Medford High School pieces of this very building that we're in right now City Hall, and not enough investments in our capital maintenance to even lower the backlog.

159
00:15:46,188 --> 00:15:51,789
City and school staff are often then scrambling to fund operating budgets through one-time grants.

160
00:15:51,849 --> 00:16:04,211
I can't tell you how many times we've had someone before us saying, you know, we'd be better off with a grant writer, because that's going to bring in more money than advocating for the city, or I'm writing grants all the time, or we're trying to organize volunteers.

161
00:16:04,271 --> 00:16:07,532
These are things that should be happening in an operating budget.

162
00:16:08,892 --> 00:16:13,713
The next two slides are to show you a couple of charts that illustrate this.

163
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:31,285
This is the mayor's initial proposed budget for fiscal 23 we were lucky to be presented with this last Tuesday on a single top sheet of paper here, instead of a budget book as would normally be provided.

164
00:16:32,006 --> 00:16:35,690
The first column is our recurring revenue what we can expect to come in every year.

165
00:16:37,168 --> 00:16:47,838
The second column includes the one time revenue that this administration had been expecting to come in to fund the budget of about $11.25 million.

166
00:16:48,498 --> 00:16:51,961
That one time revenue is what we call a structural deficit.

167
00:16:52,362 --> 00:16:57,446
It's revenue that we can't expect to have in the future, but we're still using it to balance our operating budget.

168
00:16:58,713 --> 00:17:11,058
And here it says a definition of structural deficit, use of one-time revenue, in this case ARPA, that's federal money, revenue replacement, one of the specific restricted uses, and free cash reserves that were used to cover recurring spending.

169
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:18,981
The third column here is the initial proposed spending that was initially proposed prior to June of 2022.

170
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:26,397
And then the column here is an estimate of potentially what we actually should be spending.

171
00:17:26,817 --> 00:17:31,020
Now, this is an estimate because we don't actually know what we should be spending.

172
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:37,924
I estimated that perhaps our costs really, our needs are really 20% higher than the amount that we're spending.

173
00:17:38,365 --> 00:17:40,006
It's my hope that it's less than that.

174
00:17:40,086 --> 00:17:42,007
It's certainly my hope that it's not more than that.

175
00:17:42,468 --> 00:17:46,850
But I felt that that was a relatively good estimate that we could use in the short term

176
00:17:47,831 --> 00:18:02,040
And as everyone here knows what I've been campaigning on and advocating for for several years, is that we assess our needs for our operating budget and our capital assets, and then make a plan to raise the revenue to actually meet those needs.

177
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:21,080
This is what the same chart would look like just the revenue and spending amounts over the last three fiscal years, and again fiscal 23 is the mayor's initial proposed budget before this month of June, 2022.

178
00:18:25,215 --> 00:18:35,258
before the pandemic, we were not using any one time revenue to balance the budget in fiscal year 21 we used almost $6 million from our free cash reserves to balance the budget.

179
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:40,779
Last year we used over $12 million in ARPA revenue replacement to balance the budget.

180
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,780
And this year the mayor's what the initial budget proposal

181
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:58,484
that had been worked on for months had rested on was the assumption that we would use 11.25 million a piece from that from free cash and about 8 million in ARPA revenue replacement to balance this year's budget.

182
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:05,006
What you can also see is that our estimated needs deficit isn't shrinking over this time, it's growing.

183
00:19:05,606 --> 00:19:11,068
So the gap between what we're spending every year and what we should be spending to provide the services that residents need

184
00:19:11,748 --> 00:19:16,829
and maintain and repair our capital assets has been growing worse over the past four years.

185
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,931
The key takeaways here are that we have a long-term city budget crisis.

186
00:19:24,532 --> 00:19:31,413
Our city budget for years has had an unstudied and unknown needs deficit, meaning that our spending needs are greater than the available revenue.

187
00:19:32,134 --> 00:19:40,676
Starting in fiscal year 21, the city also began to have a structural deficit, meaning the use of one-time revenue sources to balance the city budget.

188
00:19:41,743 --> 00:19:49,387
This city needs a short-term plan to eliminate the structural deficit and a long-term plan to eliminate the needs deficit.

189
00:19:50,348 --> 00:19:56,632
The only major options before us in terms of addressing these are the following.

190
00:19:57,912 --> 00:20:05,557
One, more budget cuts to end the structural deficit, further reducing services and increasing the needs deficit.

191
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:28,968
In the medium to long term, we can increase new growth revenue from development, especially new commercial and mixed use development that brings in the most money based on how our tax structure works, but as anyone in construction knows, going from the process that we started here tonight for a new development through design and permitting and then construction is a multi year process.

192
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:36,966
So any building that we permit today is not going to help us in the next two, three, maybe even four fiscal years.

193
00:20:38,327 --> 00:20:46,611
In terms of our operating budget, we could also raise revenue through a proposition two and a half override, which would close the structural deficit.

194
00:20:47,131 --> 00:20:53,275
And then we could actually assess the needs deficit to determine if we need a further override for our operating budget.

195
00:20:54,586 --> 00:21:09,634
Finally, for our capital expenses, we could raise revenue through a proposition two and a half debt exclusion to fund items like a new fire headquarters, a new Medford High School, building maintenance and renovation and fixing our $100 million road and sidewalk backlog.

196
00:21:12,415 --> 00:21:17,458
Now, I've just told you about the long term context that we are in as a city.

197
00:21:18,352 --> 00:21:27,618
What people have been incredibly concerned and stressed and confused about is why we've had issues in this fiscal year budget.

198
00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:32,262
The title of this slide is shortfalls and shocks in fiscal year 23.

199
00:21:32,822 --> 00:21:34,123
It's not the library's fault.

200
00:21:34,743 --> 00:21:38,586
The fiscal 23 budget process rested on inaccurate revenue assumptions.

201
00:21:39,682 --> 00:21:46,788
Now, what's been going around the city is that money came in from library donations and that's why, you know, we don't have the money we need.

202
00:21:47,168 --> 00:21:49,931
The answer is really a little different.

203
00:21:52,013 --> 00:21:59,139
Last minute cuts to the proposed fiscal 23 budget were an unnecessary curveball that resulted from a lack of adequate planning.

204
00:21:59,865 --> 00:22:18,702
The fiscal 23 budget numbers presented so far in this presentation have been the initial proposed budget prior to June 2022 on June 2 2022 this council received an email from the city administration that stated that we did not have the expected ARPA revenue replacement

205
00:22:19,075 --> 00:22:22,597
figure that was being planned to use one-time revenue to balance the budget.

206
00:22:23,098 --> 00:22:33,985
And therefore, they were going to be presenting us with an amended budget that had a significant amount of cuts relative to the budget that they had been working on and planning for months and that departments had sent in their figures about.

207
00:22:35,043 --> 00:22:46,687
Throughout the fiscal year 2023 budget process beginning months ago, the city administration assumed that we would have between seven and 8 million in one time ARPA revenue replacement for the budget this year.

208
00:22:47,347 --> 00:23:03,272
But according to discussions with city staff in these meetings with the CLA consultant as well from Clifton, Larson and Allen, I believe who was helping with the auditing and federal compliance, it was clear months ago that that seven to $8 million figure could not be guaranteed

209
00:23:03,732 --> 00:23:13,942
and that a final figure could not be calculated until the city's books were reviewed and cleaned up after 10 months from July 2021 to May 2022, where the city did not have a chief financial officer.

210
00:23:17,783 --> 00:23:41,533
Sometime in late May or early June, the mayor and the leadership team were given a final fixture figure of just approximately $4 million for ARPA revenue replacement in the fiscal 23 budget, due to the US Treasury Department's ARPA rules that counted several private donations to our library into our city funds and counted them as revenue and for the terms of the final revenue replacement calculation.

211
00:23:42,193 --> 00:23:43,696
I want to be clear with the residents.

212
00:23:44,196 --> 00:23:56,836
Medford did not lose any money, but now 3.75 million or so in revenue that had been assumed for the available for the fiscal 23 budget must now be spent on different restricted ARPA uses.

213
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:12,380
This assumption that we would have about $4 million that we did not have for this budget, led the administration to make last minute crop cuts across the proposed fiscal 23 budget for our city departments and our public schools.

214
00:24:13,504 --> 00:24:24,929
If this situation and the uncertainty had been shared months ago with the city council and with the public, the city and its departments and the public school system could have prepared for multiple revenue scenarios.

215
00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:42,357
The city council would have been informed as we have been requesting for months about the financial situation of the city and our city staff and our Medford residents wouldn't have experienced such urgent and unexpected reductions to the proposed fiscal 23 budget at the very last minute.

216
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,383
This is what the situation looks like in a chart.

217
00:24:49,923 --> 00:25:02,711
The first column is the initial proposed revenue, assuming 11.25 million in one time revenue that reduced to about 7.5 million due to the inaccurate assumptions about the ARPA revenue calculation.

218
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:25,654
What that means for our city is that spending is also significantly reduced by about $5 million a little less than $5 million, including the school department having 2.8 million less than they had expected city departments, having 1.7 million less than expected, and a small decrease in the debt service payments for the city.

219
00:25:26,674 --> 00:25:29,415
What does that mean in real terms.

220
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:35,994
It means that city departments that have been desperately asking for additional staff for years will not be getting it.

221
00:25:36,615 --> 00:25:44,921
It means that the public school system laid off more educators than they expected for the next year and isn't doesn't know if they'll be able to bring them all back.

222
00:25:45,581 --> 00:25:52,907
And it means that across the city, we are asking our city departments and our public schools to once again, do more with less.

223
00:25:54,059 --> 00:26:15,412
Now, I'm not saying that I have a magic bullet here that could have solved it, but I do know for a fact that finding out at the beginning of June, that we have to make significant budget reductions in the proposed budget has led to us not having a budget book for the city council, not knowing the information we need to know or the full picture of our city budget.

224
00:26:15,912 --> 00:26:24,335
It's led to the school department finance team scrambling to find the cuts that would have the least impact on our students and our teachers in the classroom.

225
00:26:24,775 --> 00:26:35,659
It's led to city departments coming to us, like our library did tonight, and saying that they are not going to have enough basic funding to provide the key and core services that they should be providing.

226
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:43,482
And at the end of the day, what it means is that we are once again, at best, kicking the can down the road, and at worst,

227
00:26:44,382 --> 00:26:51,884
actively creating situations that will hurt people and reduce services in this community.

228
00:26:55,105 --> 00:27:01,047
I want to close my presentation with some action recommendations and explain to residents how they can help.

229
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:07,054
One, I have some recommendations to address our long term budget needs.

230
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:23,645
First, we need to determine the actual budget needs deficit for the city of Medford's operating budget, and our capital needs pieces of this work have been done, the school committee process over the past two years has significantly improved to where they are actually beginning to assess their need

231
00:27:24,045 --> 00:27:24,966
and share that number.

232
00:27:25,446 --> 00:27:37,951
In addition, departments like our Department of Public Works have done comprehensive reviews of capital assets like our roads and sidewalks, so we actually have an accurate picture of how big the problem is and what it will cost to solve it.

233
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:45,034
But those are not comprehensive assessments of our needs deficit for our operating budget and our capital assets.

234
00:27:46,115 --> 00:27:46,435
Second,

235
00:27:47,118 --> 00:28:00,503
We I would implore the mayor to develop and release a revenue generation plan to meet the budget needs deficit to set goals and benchmarks that can be tracked and provide a clear and reasonable timeline for that over the next 10 years.

236
00:28:01,826 --> 00:28:05,709
I'm not saying that all the new revenue we need needs to come from specific sources.

237
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:24,624
My best hope is that it can come from sources like new growth and commercial development, and the exact kind of thing that we're trying to bring into this city, that we've seen cities in similar positions in recent history like Cambridge and Somerville do, where they've had that commercial development and mixed use development that has significantly grown their revenues.

238
00:28:25,144 --> 00:28:31,249
However, I'm also not ruling out without studying the other options before us to raise revenue.

239
00:28:32,968 --> 00:28:34,588
two for the short term.

240
00:28:35,288 --> 00:28:56,393
My recommendations are one that the city council and the school committee hold the mayor accountable to release all information and a clear timeline for the assumptions that were made in the FY 23 ARPA revenue replacement calculation that led to the fiscal year 23 budget cuts we deserve to know what the administration knew, and when they knew it, because the last minute

241
00:28:57,253 --> 00:29:08,843
release of this issue and information has caused significant harm and pain and a district just, you know, disruption to the trust and loss of trust in the information coming from the city administration.

242
00:29:09,243 --> 00:29:21,474
The first step to repairing that is to let us know the truth of what happened, why the decisions that were made were made, and then to acknowledge any mistakes and move forward from that point.

243
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:24,777
Without that restoring trust will be incredibly difficult.

244
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:46,482
Second, the mayor must release a full accounting of the ARPA funds from the Federal American Rescue Plan Act that were spent in fiscal year 21 and fiscal year 22, then share how much is remaining in American Rescue Act funds after fiscal year 2022, and outline the timeline and spending plan for the remaining ARPA funds.

245
00:29:47,403 --> 00:29:49,764
Finally, by July 14 2022.

246
00:29:50,244 --> 00:30:04,251
It is my belief, considering that the mayor has said that not only is the fiscal year 2023 budget incredibly tight, but that the fiscal year 2024 budget, maybe the same or worse, that to avoid another year and fiscal 2024.

247
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:21,504
and hopefully to mitigate the impact on fiscal 2023, the mayor must demonstrate to us that she has an alternative plan to a Proposition 2.5 override and that we do not need a Proposition 2.5 override to address the short-term structural deficit.

248
00:30:22,658 --> 00:30:36,087
If that cannot be demonstrated, I don't believe it is a responsible and reasonable choice to move forward with a massive structural deficit that will essentially mean more cuts, more negative impacts in the future.

249
00:30:37,267 --> 00:30:45,353
Finally, in terms of community action steps, I asked the up the people of Medford to attend our upcoming city council budget hearings.

250
00:30:46,427 --> 00:31:10,067
And to attend our budget presentation this council has requested and preferred that we have a budget presented to us on June 21, which would give us an additional meeting to review the budget, however it's beginning to look like the budget will not be presented to us until June 28, which is just two days before the state imposed deadline for a city to pass a budget, basically putting a budget before us with a take it

251
00:31:10,747 --> 00:31:19,572
or leave it, and there cannot be any sort of discussion or process around it, which I think is really not a collaborative approach.

252
00:31:20,652 --> 00:31:22,373
And that's a kind word.

253
00:31:23,613 --> 00:31:29,416
I ask you to come on the 21st to the 28th and speak up and share what this budget impact means to you.

254
00:31:30,137 --> 00:31:36,900
I also ask you to contact the mayor and ask for a release of information about the decision-making process that led us to this point.

255
00:31:37,611 --> 00:31:50,139
to state your support for the recommendations in this presentation, if you so agree, and to ask whether or not the mayor will explore an override to eliminate the structural deficit and stop further austerity and budget cuts in fiscal 2024.

256
00:31:50,719 --> 00:31:59,125
Finally, I ask you to organize community campaigns to advocate for solutions to address the long-term budget needs deficit we have here in Medford.

257
00:32:00,132 --> 00:32:04,478
And to my fellow councilors, I thank you for allowing me to make this presentation.

258
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:16,273
And I would ask you, if possible, that we could vote on these recommendations either one by one or as a package tonight, subsequent to this presentation.

259
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:18,296
And that's the conclusion of my presentation.

260
00:32:19,178 --> 00:32:40,594
My hopes are that residents feel a little bit more informed about what has happened over the past months that led us to this point, the context and situation of our city budget, and at least my vision of some recommendations that could help us to move forward and make a plan to address these issues.

261
00:32:41,315 --> 00:32:42,556
I just want to say one more thing.

262
00:32:42,576 --> 00:32:47,820
I've also been made aware that tonight, a video was posted by the mayor.

263
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:51,480
explaining something about the city budget.

264
00:32:52,301 --> 00:32:58,067
I obviously haven't had time to review it, as I've been here in the chambers and meetings about the city budget.

265
00:32:58,707 --> 00:33:05,234
And I personally think that that sort of message could have been made directly to us, and should have been made directly to us

266
00:33:06,489 --> 00:33:20,234
I don't know what it says so I don't know if it answers these questions but a presentation like that, I believe should have been made to this council on the first day of our budget hearings, explaining exactly what happened, and exactly why we're in the situation we're in.

267
00:33:20,814 --> 00:33:24,475
And I think that it once again shows that

268
00:33:24,995 --> 00:33:34,783
there's a lot of effort that's going to have to be undertaken to restore trust in the administration, and the idea that a collaborative approach is what this city needs to move forward.

269
00:33:34,883 --> 00:33:50,734
This council sits waiting for collaboration, but we have waited a long time, and when it doesn't come, it means we don't have the information we need to answer the questions and make the decisions that this community elected us to make.

270
00:33:51,395 --> 00:33:51,795
Thank you.

271
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:54,157
Thank you, President Bares.

272
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,431
discussion on the council counselor night.

273
00:33:57,611 --> 00:33:58,852
Madam President, thank you very much.

274
00:34:00,213 --> 00:34:03,014
It's amazing how much things can change in three short years.

275
00:34:04,135 --> 00:34:08,537
And FYI 2020 I remember that budget, I remember speaking on that budget when we voted on it.

276
00:34:09,157 --> 00:34:16,341
And I believe my comments were something along the lines of this is the best city budget that I've seen as a member of the city council.

277
00:34:16,842 --> 00:34:17,622
That was an FYI, 2020.

278
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,504
Looking at Council of bears graphs.

279
00:34:22,224 --> 00:34:22,825
FYI 2020.

280
00:34:23,685 --> 00:34:24,846
What was our deficit spending.

281
00:34:26,168 --> 00:34:26,568
Zero.

282
00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:32,272
Three years later, $29 million in deficit spending.

283
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,977
In FY 2021, I spoke of a budget.

284
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:47,282
I warned about us becoming reliant on these one-time revenues to balance the budget.

285
00:34:49,424 --> 00:34:51,665
I warned about creating a structural deficit.

286
00:34:53,146 --> 00:34:54,287
I called for recurring

287
00:34:55,153 --> 00:34:56,274
non-tax-based revenues.

288
00:34:57,074 --> 00:35:05,140
I called for public-private partnerships for us to be able to offset some of this impact on the residential taxpayer.

289
00:35:05,401 --> 00:35:08,043
In 2002, I said the same thing.

290
00:35:12,466 --> 00:35:22,874
Since 2001, this council has been calling on the administration to come before us on a quarterly basis to discuss

291
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:51,246
the financial and fiscal health and well-being of this community, to discuss our projected revenues versus our actual revenues, and to give us a snapshot each quarter as to where we are financially, so that come June 28th, seems to be the mayor's favorite day, we're not surprised with a situation

292
00:35:52,606 --> 00:36:00,374
that puts us in a position that says, spend $7 million of reserves or I'm gonna have to cut teachers.

293
00:36:02,255 --> 00:36:09,202
In fact, the budget that the mayor presented us says, spend $7 million of reserves and I'm still gonna cut teachers.

294
00:36:13,326 --> 00:36:16,149
This is financial mismanagement at its finest.

295
00:36:18,296 --> 00:36:22,598
We have a mayor that's not interested in municipal finance and the superintendent of schools is not interested in school finance.

296
00:36:24,058 --> 00:36:26,779
Three years down the line, this is where we end up.

297
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:29,820
All right?

298
00:36:30,501 --> 00:36:42,465
When we abuse a finance director to the point where she has to leave the job for her own health and wellbeing, and we can't get someone to fill the spot for 10 months because we're bullying employees, this is where we end up.

299
00:36:45,678 --> 00:36:59,505
When you send every person in City Hall to come up here and carry your water and do your dirty work and give a three minute and 92nd budget presentation, and 92nd budget presentation over zoom over zoom.

300
00:37:00,206 --> 00:37:02,007
Thank you, Council bus over zoom.

301
00:37:03,327 --> 00:37:04,348
How important is it.

302
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:13,453
How important is it 90% of life is showing up.

303
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:15,530
At least show up.

304
00:37:16,531 --> 00:37:18,952
If you're gonna give us bad news, look us in the eye and give it to us.

305
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,873
Tell us how we got here and why.

306
00:37:20,893 --> 00:37:30,737
Because I'm so tired of hearing one thing at this podium and then seeing a press release that says something totally different the same day.

307
00:37:32,277 --> 00:37:33,418
Government by press release.

308
00:37:34,298 --> 00:37:36,179
No transparency, no fiscal transparency.

309
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:42,982
If there was fiscal transparency, then this council would have had their quarterly meetings for the past four quarters.

310
00:37:45,081 --> 00:37:47,342
And this wouldn't be a surprise to us, right?

311
00:37:47,382 --> 00:37:54,885
And then maybe we wouldn't be so outraged when the chief of staff comes up here and tries to sell us slush, because that's what it is, it's slush.

312
00:37:55,165 --> 00:37:55,726
You know what I mean?

313
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:57,446
This organization, there's this organization.

314
00:37:57,466 --> 00:37:58,247
It's the city of Medford.

315
00:37:58,347 --> 00:37:59,347
This isn't an organization.

316
00:37:59,547 --> 00:38:00,207
It's where people live.

317
00:38:00,227 --> 00:38:02,889
It's not an organization.

318
00:38:03,129 --> 00:38:03,689
This is a government.

319
00:38:03,829 --> 00:38:04,849
It's here to provide services.

320
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:11,232
And we can't do that operating in a $29 million, 36 month structural deficit.

321
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:17,723
can't do it, can't deliver the services that the taxpayers deserve.

322
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:24,613
The way we're spending with the way we're doing deficit spending, we can't do it, we can't do it we can't sustain.

323
00:38:25,354 --> 00:38:27,498
So console biz, let's look at you.

324
00:38:28,588 --> 00:38:29,288
It's out there, right?

325
00:38:29,828 --> 00:38:33,129
There's the talk, there's the discussion, there's the conversation that needs to be had, all right?

326
00:38:33,249 --> 00:38:33,970
It has to be had.

327
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:53,255
We can either continue on the road that we're on right now and go down this path that we're on right now and continue to say, we're gonna throw good money after bad money and bad money after good money to keep us running in place, while we watch the likes of Everett and Malden and Somerville and Arlington and Melrose, give me another one, anybody, give me another one.

328
00:38:53,795 --> 00:38:55,216
All these communities pass us by.

329
00:38:56,352 --> 00:38:57,812
All these communities pass us by.

330
00:38:58,233 --> 00:39:03,394
Cambridge gives their high school graduates $3,000 each in opera money when they graduate.

331
00:39:03,994 --> 00:39:04,594
Malden gives them 1,000.

332
00:39:05,775 --> 00:39:06,275
We're broke.

333
00:39:08,455 --> 00:39:08,936
We're broke.

334
00:39:09,676 --> 00:39:09,896
How?

335
00:39:10,976 --> 00:39:12,016
How is that possible?

336
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:13,777
How is that possible?

337
00:39:14,257 --> 00:39:17,478
Is it maybe because when you look at these other communities, you see cranes in the sky?

338
00:39:17,498 --> 00:39:24,420
When you look at these other communities, you see them creating public-private partnerships with developers that want to come into this community?

339
00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:40,508
I think that might have a little bit to do with it, a little bit to do with it, but you have to be present and you have to show up in order to develop these partnerships, in order to face the music, in order to get ahead of bad situations.

340
00:39:40,528 --> 00:39:42,229
You have to be present and you have to show up.

341
00:39:45,852 --> 00:39:46,352
I'm at a loss.

342
00:39:47,502 --> 00:39:48,083
I'm at a loss.

343
00:39:48,783 --> 00:40:03,960
I wanted one thing in this budget, and one thing only, to get Mark Wabrowski rehired so that we could go look at our zoning map, so that we as a council, again, again, acting as the adults in the room, can figure out a way for us to generate revenues to get us out of this mess.

344
00:40:06,001 --> 00:40:09,982
But for 50,000 bucks, now you just saw what $50,000 got us earlier this evening.

345
00:40:10,503 --> 00:40:15,664
The gentleman came up here and he said that they have a parcel of land and they're getting about $100,000 a year.

346
00:40:15,684 --> 00:40:18,985
100,000 the city's getting out of it in property taxes.

347
00:40:19,886 --> 00:40:29,309
And through the work that this council did by creating an office two district, that parcel now is gonna generate us $3 million, $3 million in permitting fees.

348
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:34,751
And the property taxes are gonna be $2.9 million higher than where they are today.

349
00:40:38,883 --> 00:40:41,345
So we got a consultant for 50 grand.

350
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:44,648
The first project that walked in the door just got us 2.9 million bucks.

351
00:40:48,371 --> 00:40:48,711
I don't know.

352
00:40:48,751 --> 00:40:53,855
I mean, like I said to Mr. Walsh, I'm not great at math, but I'm pretty sure these numbers will add up.

353
00:40:54,216 --> 00:40:56,097
At some point in time, these numbers will add up.

354
00:40:56,157 --> 00:41:06,486
If we can create growth, if we can generate revenue in this community, because if we're running in place and we're not generating at least 1.25% a year, we're losing, we're deficit spending again.

355
00:41:08,641 --> 00:41:13,844
we have to generate at least 1.25% of new growth annually for us to just run in place.

356
00:41:16,706 --> 00:41:26,153
That's why an assistant city solicitor for this council is so important, because we've seen what we can do when we get the tools in the toolbox for us to go to work.

357
00:41:26,633 --> 00:41:29,335
And there's not anybody behind this rail that's afraid to go to work.

358
00:41:29,935 --> 00:41:30,796
We're all present.

359
00:41:31,316 --> 00:41:32,477
We're all here ready to do it.

360
00:41:34,807 --> 00:41:37,849
I think console base for going through the time, putting this together.

361
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:46,553
You know, in years past this is something I said to him on the phone today in years past this is something that would have been we've ever would have been arguing yelling and screaming about this and that because you made a suggestion.

362
00:41:47,288 --> 00:41:50,690
He made a suggestion that we have a problem, all right?

363
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:52,772
Now, I don't think that's a suggestion.

364
00:41:52,792 --> 00:41:53,532
I think that's a fact.

365
00:41:53,852 --> 00:41:54,993
We have a problem, all right?

366
00:41:55,473 --> 00:41:58,835
He also made a suggestion that there's a few ways out of it, and one of them is taxation.

367
00:41:59,436 --> 00:41:59,776
Well, yeah.

368
00:42:00,597 --> 00:42:15,967
Yeah, if we're not gonna develop public-private partnerships, we're not gonna generate new non-tax revenues, there's no other way for us to get out of it other than deficit spend and borrow from our reserves and watch our bond rating crash and watch our interest rates rise so we can't borrow and we can't build and we can't maintain.

369
00:42:16,747 --> 00:42:18,668
The conversation has to be had.

370
00:42:18,688 --> 00:42:20,728
The conversation has to be had.

371
00:42:20,768 --> 00:42:25,070
Now, this council is not going to go magic wand, boom, the taxes got raised, pow, poof, and that's it.

372
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:28,691
It's going to be an open and public process, and the discussion has to take place.

373
00:42:29,031 --> 00:42:31,291
I'm not saying I want to see the taxes go up in this community.

374
00:42:31,671 --> 00:42:39,934
What I am saying is I want to see the taxpayers receive the services that they deserve at a level that's above mediocrity.

375
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:48,834
Now, I can count on my hand all the tires that I parked this year driving down our public streets.

376
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:50,955
Counselor Singh told me he got one not too long ago.

377
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:57,776
This gentleman owns a company that drives cars, a livery service, multiple vehicles.

378
00:42:58,177 --> 00:43:07,319
I can imagine, I can imagine the impact that this business owner is feeling for our lack of investments in our roads, the amount of money that he has to pay out of pocket on tires, on alignments.

379
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:12,860
Add it all up, look what's going on.

380
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,741
All right, add it all up and look what's going on.

381
00:43:16,121 --> 00:43:18,182
We've been asking for it, we've been calling for it for two years.

382
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:25,606
The only reason this is a surprise to us, the only reason this is a surprise to us is because someone wasn't being transparent.

383
00:43:28,528 --> 00:43:29,548
And that's the fact of the matter.

384
00:43:29,888 --> 00:43:42,555
And now we're gonna be put in a position where it's gonna say, spend the 7.5 million in reserves, potentially mortgage, potentially mortgage the financial and fiscal health of this community for years to come.

385
00:43:44,535 --> 00:43:46,716
because for the past 24 months, I didn't want to deal with you people.

386
00:43:49,078 --> 00:43:49,558
Is that fair?

387
00:43:50,799 --> 00:43:51,239
Not to me.

388
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,100
It's not about me.

389
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:52,580
I don't care.

390
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:53,621
It's not about me.

391
00:43:53,661 --> 00:43:54,581
It's not being fair to me.

392
00:43:54,902 --> 00:44:04,488
It's being fair to the people that put us here and being fair to the people that rely on us to make good decisions on their behalf so they can continue to live in this community.

393
00:44:05,413 --> 00:44:08,275
continue to be a part of it and want to be a part of it.

394
00:44:08,295 --> 00:44:09,115
Want to be a part of it.

395
00:44:09,235 --> 00:44:10,016
That's the biggest thing.

396
00:44:10,616 --> 00:44:11,837
I see people getting pushed away.

397
00:44:12,257 --> 00:44:13,658
People don't want to be involved anymore.

398
00:44:13,678 --> 00:44:14,159
Enough's enough.

399
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:14,959
I'm so tired of it.

400
00:44:15,379 --> 00:44:16,120
I'm so tired of it.

401
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,060
I can't take it anymore.

402
00:44:18,861 --> 00:44:23,985
And I think we're all getting there at some point because we keep asking, we keep asking, we keep begging, we keep crying.

403
00:44:24,185 --> 00:44:25,586
Please give us this information.

404
00:44:26,026 --> 00:44:29,088
We don't want it because we want to, you know, do something bad to you.

405
00:44:29,108 --> 00:44:32,270
We want it because we want to help this community and we want to do the job that we're elected to do.

406
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:42,811
And sometimes that means bringing up unpopular issues and bringing up things that people might not want to hear, but it's a discussion that has to take place.

407
00:44:44,553 --> 00:44:45,534
You got to hand it to Zach.

408
00:44:46,395 --> 00:44:49,618
It takes a lot of guts to do what he did tonight, to put this on the table and say, look,

409
00:44:51,141 --> 00:44:51,962
This is what's going on.

410
00:44:52,142 --> 00:44:56,205
But like I said before, and I'll say it again, once again, this body is acting like the adults.

411
00:44:56,665 --> 00:44:57,886
So thank you Constance for putting this on.

412
00:44:57,906 --> 00:44:58,507
I appreciate it.

413
00:44:58,527 --> 00:45:02,650
I certainly have no problem with a resolution going over these recommendations that you made.

414
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:09,735
I think we need to get these key takeaways back from the administration so that we can make a more informed decision going forward.

415
00:45:10,356 --> 00:45:12,577
But I'm very impressed with the work you did this evening.

416
00:45:12,597 --> 00:45:15,780
And I thank you for it because it's necessary for someone

417
00:45:17,817 --> 00:45:21,960
to tell the truth about the fiscal health of this community and what's going on and why we're in the situation we're in.

418
00:45:23,541 --> 00:45:27,244
And not do it through press release and social media posts.

419
00:45:29,246 --> 00:45:30,847
Use the forum for what it's for.

420
00:45:31,588 --> 00:45:33,589
So I've talked far too much about this.

421
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:35,131
Thank you very much, Madam President.

422
00:45:35,211 --> 00:45:36,071
Thank you, Councilor Beasley.

423
00:45:36,712 --> 00:45:37,392
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

424
00:45:37,452 --> 00:45:38,193
Councilor Carvalho.

425
00:45:38,553 --> 00:45:39,454
Thank you, Madam President.

426
00:45:39,574 --> 00:45:42,576
And I thank my two councilors for the great presentation.

427
00:45:42,917 --> 00:45:46,760
You know, I had a very uncomfortable conversation with

428
00:45:47,483 --> 00:45:50,664
with a woman a couple of days ago about the street.

429
00:45:52,204 --> 00:45:57,285
They live on the street in Medford that is so dilapidated that they can't drive on it anymore.

430
00:45:57,965 --> 00:46:01,866
So they've decided now to take matters into their own hands.

431
00:46:02,467 --> 00:46:10,688
They wanna spend $40,000 in their own money on a street that generates close to $80,000 a year in taxes.

432
00:46:14,068 --> 00:46:16,229
Because we can't even do street.

433
00:46:16,509 --> 00:46:19,911
We can't repair the street, which is horrendous.

434
00:46:20,771 --> 00:46:35,879
And when I went down to the assessor's office to get the information to compile the numbers that I got, I find out that we have an interim assessor.

435
00:46:37,059 --> 00:46:38,060
So Ellen Brosseau,

436
00:46:39,117 --> 00:46:43,140
is the interim assessor for here while she's working for the city of Lowell.

437
00:46:44,121 --> 00:46:47,003
She said, yeah, how does that, how does that happen?

438
00:46:48,203 --> 00:46:51,285
How's one person serving two cities?

439
00:46:52,426 --> 00:46:55,028
And Ellen was an outstanding assessor.

440
00:46:56,149 --> 00:46:58,971
But you know, like I said, moved on.

441
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:04,154
So now we've begged her to be the interim assessor.

442
00:47:04,975 --> 00:47:07,617
I don't know how she's doing two jobs at the same time.

443
00:47:08,611 --> 00:47:10,632
Again, do we get a notification from the mayor?

444
00:47:11,313 --> 00:47:11,593
Nothing.

445
00:47:13,955 --> 00:47:18,778
You got a phone call before you came over here tonight about private way parking.

446
00:47:19,278 --> 00:47:21,380
Something we've been asking for all along.

447
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:26,143
Knowing we have a budget meeting tomorrow night and none of us can go.

448
00:47:28,384 --> 00:47:29,925
I had input for that meeting.

449
00:47:30,025 --> 00:47:31,266
I wanted to be on that meeting.

450
00:47:31,286 --> 00:47:33,708
People call me all the time about that.

451
00:47:35,045 --> 00:47:38,527
Again, this is not a one-person show here.

452
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:46,990
Councilor Scott Pelley says, no, we'll share in your defeat, but give us a chance to share in the other stuff too.

453
00:47:47,971 --> 00:47:49,811
We just can't keep working in the dark here.

454
00:47:49,831 --> 00:48:00,216
And again, I thank Councilor Basie did an outstanding presentation, and Councilor Knight followed right up on it, but where do we go?

455
00:48:00,436 --> 00:48:02,037
Do we keep on spending, spending, spending?

456
00:48:03,097 --> 00:48:04,918
We're not gonna have any more money for anything in the city.

457
00:48:06,297 --> 00:48:07,137
Thank you, Councilor Carvillo.

458
00:48:07,457 --> 00:48:08,098
Councilor Collins.

459
00:48:09,558 --> 00:48:10,418
Thank you, President Morrell.

460
00:48:11,539 --> 00:48:15,260
And I also want to join in thanking Vice President Behrs for his presentation tonight.

461
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:25,143
I think that maybe one of the definitions of leadership is being willing to say what is unpopular, what you know people don't want to hear because it's the right thing to do.

462
00:48:25,984 --> 00:48:28,204
And I'm glad that we have that coming from somebody.

463
00:48:28,224 --> 00:48:32,466
The budget proposals that we've received so far

464
00:48:33,982 --> 00:48:38,985
have demonstrated, I think this is clear to anybody paying attention so far have demonstrated their operating budget.

465
00:48:39,466 --> 00:48:49,172
It not only cannot support the current level of service that for example our library patrons and staff infrastructure, public school students and teachers and staff.

466
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,970
crumbling infrastructure already has a need for.

467
00:48:52,990 --> 00:49:01,378
It also, as has been demonstrated, at least bear the reliance on one-time funding that's needed just to balance the operating budget.

468
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:11,288
And it's been made abundantly clear that we have no concrete plans to look forward to to better our mid and long-term future to navigate out of the situation that we find ourselves in.

469
00:49:12,143 --> 00:49:16,207
no plan except to hope that things will get better on their own.

470
00:49:17,147 --> 00:49:25,634
This administration has already divulged that the next year for fiscal year 24, it's likely that the belt will be pulled even tighter.

471
00:49:26,615 --> 00:49:39,585
It was wishful thinking to assume that we had the level of revenue replacement that the original proposed budget proposal was based off of, and the revenue replacement calculation for fiscal year 24 will only be smaller.

472
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:40,426
This is not our plan.

473
00:49:40,446 --> 00:49:41,347
This cannot be our plan.

474
00:49:43,152 --> 00:49:54,116
And I want to acknowledge it is true that the administration is uniquely and solely responsible for balancing money in, money out, coming up with a budget that keeps the entire city afloat.

475
00:49:54,756 --> 00:49:56,556
This is a huge cross to bear.

476
00:49:56,856 --> 00:49:57,837
That is a heavy burden.

477
00:49:58,377 --> 00:49:59,597
It is a huge responsibility.

478
00:49:59,657 --> 00:50:00,397
I acknowledge that.

479
00:50:00,698 --> 00:50:03,478
I don't envy the task of putting the budget proposals together.

480
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,579
I think everybody here understands that.

481
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:08,320
But at the same time, that branch of our government

482
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,803
is the only one that is empowered to do those things.

483
00:50:11,863 --> 00:50:14,567
It's the only branch with that power to make those decisions.

484
00:50:15,808 --> 00:50:22,415
And we knew going into it, we knew going into this term, that the situation was never going to be easy, that these circumstances are bad.

485
00:50:23,036 --> 00:50:25,259
You cannot go through a pandemic and emerge unscathed.

486
00:50:26,812 --> 00:50:33,095
But I think each of us knew exactly what we were getting in for when we ran for office two years into a global pandemic.

487
00:50:33,295 --> 00:50:41,199
The circumstances are real, but allowing these circumstances to justify what we do or don't do to better our future, that doesn't help us.

488
00:50:41,339 --> 00:50:42,059
That isn't what we need.

489
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:44,600
That isn't what our constituency deserves.

490
00:50:47,221 --> 00:50:51,023
When this administration is ready to take the reins to collaborate,

491
00:50:51,637 --> 00:50:52,597
I am ready to collaborate.

492
00:50:52,677 --> 00:50:56,838
I know that this entire council is ready, enthusiastic to collaborate.

493
00:50:56,858 --> 00:51:03,479
I feel that starting with the very first meeting of this year, this council has gone to bat for the administration's priorities.

494
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:15,842
We've supported personnel appropriations and sought to codify ordinances that would all further this administration's goals and priorities in addition to the goals and priorities of the people that we were elected to represent.

495
00:51:16,882 --> 00:51:21,123
And I believe that we've made every attempt to have a proactive and organized budget process.

496
00:51:23,431 --> 00:51:28,973
There's a lot to say, but there's a couple, to me, key points that I just want to underline from what's already been said.

497
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:38,737
It's not to me just that our very thin, highly curated list of council budget priorities didn't fit into this budget.

498
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:43,860
Priorities like an assistant city solicitor, a code enforcement officer, a zoning consultant,

499
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:59,026
nothing sexy, nothing expensive, all of which are directly tied to the ability of this legislative body to do what it's elected to do, which is to legislate and in legislating to support the goals of the administration and the goals of the people that we were elected to represent.

500
00:52:01,427 --> 00:52:11,151
And it's not just that this budget spells out a reduction in services for, again, just for example, library patrons and staff and public school students and teachers.

501
00:52:12,272 --> 00:52:14,433
It's not even the opacity

502
00:52:14,966 --> 00:52:27,051
of this budget process, that it's been so disorganized, that it's been so late breaking, that it's been hard to read any transparency into the process, even though I know, I'm sure that was an intention, it's been hard to see that there at all.

503
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:40,137
The point to underline in all of those frustrations is this, that this plan, as the administration has stated, is to pass this austerity budget and follow it up for one for fiscal year 24 that will be even worse.

504
00:52:40,818 --> 00:52:43,459
When I talk to constituents, this is what I hear.

505
00:52:44,808 --> 00:53:01,882
roads and sidewalks, a better Medford public high school, better outreach to our marginalized constituencies, an office of housing stability, affordable and accessible afterschool, and on and on and on and on.

506
00:53:02,182 --> 00:53:02,902
We have many needs.

507
00:53:02,963 --> 00:53:05,765
That's what a government is for, to support its constituencies.

508
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:21,060
Many of these are matters of the most basic constituent services, again, potholes, but they are also a matter of equity and of justice, of properly serving the constituencies that we represent.

509
00:53:22,381 --> 00:53:34,687
And if we are to implement our city's many laudable plans, the social justice roadmap, the climate action and adaptation plan, the pavement management program, et cetera,

510
00:53:36,128 --> 00:53:38,089
we need to fund those values.

511
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:46,171
So these cuts to the school and the library budget are just a glimmer of what's to come if we don't change course.

512
00:53:47,231 --> 00:53:58,835
I'll end with a quote from something my dear old dad loves to say, people don't fail to plan, people don't plan to fail, they fail to plan.

513
00:54:00,535 --> 00:54:05,657
And to follow up on that, I also wanna note one of actually my favorite quotes which comes from our mayor, which is,

514
00:54:08,343 --> 00:54:10,825
A vision without a plan is just a hallucination.

515
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:14,148
I know that this council is ready to partner in planning.

516
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:16,631
Thank you.

517
00:54:18,492 --> 00:54:19,253
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

518
00:54:19,293 --> 00:54:19,794
Councilor Sang.

519
00:54:21,395 --> 00:54:28,241
I think Councilor Collins laid out to us what we hear on the doorsteps when we campaign every two years, which is that

520
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:44,771
We want our residents want basic services above all and that's what they expect from the city they expect us to be addressing our schools they expect us to be addressing our roads and our potholes, and it's upsetting that us counselors are have to be the ones to deliver the bad news that

521
00:54:45,923 --> 00:54:59,370
We have a government that isn't addressing the fiscal crisis in front of us that is necessary to deal with first in order for us to provide the services that our residents deserve.

522
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:07,293
To not talk about the budget crisis in front of us today would be fiscal irresponsibility.

523
00:55:08,274 --> 00:55:14,357
To not talk about these problems that Vice President Behr has presented

524
00:55:15,913 --> 00:55:19,336
would be either incompetence or indifference.

525
00:55:19,496 --> 00:55:21,859
And this council, I know for sure, will not stand for that.

526
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,382
We are out of time.

527
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:31,788
Vice President Sparrows' presentation was not a halftime speech.

528
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:40,716
It was a Hail Mary prayer that our executive leadership shows the boldness and the courage to be honest about our finances.

529
00:55:41,939 --> 00:55:46,202
This is us down 10 points with five seconds left to go in the game.

530
00:55:47,583 --> 00:55:50,205
But we cannot be fearful of the moment.

531
00:55:50,665 --> 00:55:52,647
We need to be brave and we need to rise up to it.

532
00:55:52,727 --> 00:55:58,951
And we need to have the difficult conversations to do this and the tools to let us do this.

533
00:56:00,072 --> 00:56:07,918
If we wanna grow revenue, if we want to increase new growth in this community, we will need a zoning consultant

534
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:16,943
as Councillor Knight has talked about, to increase our commercial tax base and to increase our housing in the city.

535
00:56:17,964 --> 00:56:25,549
Without giving us this tool, we, not only us, but the people of Medford are being set up to fail.

536
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:35,676
If we don't talk realistically and honestly about a Prop 2.5 override to meet, to reduce our structural deficit,

537
00:56:36,988 --> 00:56:47,473
because there's no more room to cut, and because next year might even be worse, if we don't have that conversation, we are doing our constituents no favors.

538
00:56:49,014 --> 00:56:51,395
There's no more time for distractions.

539
00:56:51,735 --> 00:56:53,336
There's just no more time for distractions.

540
00:56:53,856 --> 00:57:00,539
Handing us sheets of paper two minutes before a budget meeting, that's not seriousness about fiscal issues.

541
00:57:02,768 --> 00:57:08,169
I as a counselor and Councilor Collins has talked about this and I know every single one of us here today.

542
00:57:08,909 --> 00:57:15,270
We are ready to work with the mayor's office to make sure that our city survives this budget crisis.

543
00:57:16,311 --> 00:57:19,151
This long term fiscal conundrum.

544
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:20,871
We are ready.

545
00:57:21,531 --> 00:57:24,052
And many of us in all of us.

546
00:57:25,232 --> 00:57:27,573
All of us have acted in good faith with the city.

547
00:57:27,973 --> 00:57:29,413
We have tried

548
00:57:31,305 --> 00:57:47,697
over and over again to engage the mayor's administration when it comes to finances, when it comes to shared priorities, we've even taken difficult votes to advance the mayor's priorities, even when it came to community backlash.

549
00:57:49,119 --> 00:58:00,047
Because we believe that working together, that collaborative spirit that Vice President Behrs is talking about, we believe that by moving ahead together on our shared priorities,

550
00:58:01,133 --> 00:58:01,834
Medford will win.

551
00:58:03,175 --> 00:58:04,817
And that's exactly what we have to do now.

552
00:58:04,857 --> 00:58:06,598
We have to have that collaborative spirit.

553
00:58:06,638 --> 00:58:12,684
We have to bring back that collaboration, that cooperation, and that trust.

554
00:58:14,045 --> 00:58:22,313
We need to have that honest conversation about where our city is headed, what we want our city to look like, and how exactly policy-wise we're going to get that vision implemented.

555
00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:23,674
Or else, as

556
00:58:24,823 --> 00:58:32,529
Councilor Collins alluded to and as our mayor loves to say that vision without a plan, really just does become a hallucination.

557
00:58:34,051 --> 00:58:36,412
No one wants to be in this position that we're in today.

558
00:58:37,513 --> 00:58:38,214
I don't want to be here.

559
00:58:38,234 --> 00:58:40,556
I know all my counselors don't want to be here.

560
00:58:40,576 --> 00:58:42,317
I know the mayor doesn't want to be here.

561
00:58:43,178 --> 00:58:47,942
But if we are to be the adults in the room, we need to face

562
00:58:49,062 --> 00:58:51,263
our situation face forward.

563
00:58:51,943 --> 00:58:58,805
We need to not shy away and we need to address the real challenges that we have before us.

564
00:58:59,325 --> 00:59:08,708
And we need to not make up excuses for this, because we can't just pin this on the pandemic or say that other cities are like this, because that's just not true.

565
00:59:09,368 --> 00:59:10,048
It's just not true.

566
00:59:11,308 --> 00:59:12,469
Thank you, President Murrell.

567
00:59:12,789 --> 00:59:13,469
Thank you, Councilor Seng.

568
00:59:13,489 --> 00:59:15,310
Back to Councilor Carvilla, then Vice-President Behrs.

569
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:16,690
Thank you, Madam President.

570
00:59:18,313 --> 00:59:22,395
Councilor Collins mentioned vision, Councilor Saine mentioned vision.

571
00:59:22,815 --> 00:59:25,396
During the campaign, the mayor mentioned the vision, the vision, the vision.

572
00:59:25,416 --> 00:59:26,717
There is no vision.

573
00:59:28,158 --> 00:59:35,661
We scared the death out of everybody on Mystic Avenue because if you voted for the Mystic Avenue project, the world was gonna come to an end.

574
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:40,123
Four years later, Mystic Avenue is still a graveyard.

575
00:59:40,323 --> 00:59:41,443
Nothing's going on down there.

576
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:42,824
Very little interest down there.

577
00:59:43,364 --> 00:59:44,785
No, Councilor Baskin was bringing up

578
00:59:45,812 --> 00:59:47,954
about some points here about a two and a half override.

579
00:59:50,696 --> 01:00:03,168
I think that's a decision for the people to make, but how can we possibly pass a two and a half override and hand it over to this administration?

580
01:00:05,189 --> 01:00:06,631
How do we do that?

581
01:00:09,678 --> 01:00:16,420
Okay, that's, you know, this is a plan A form of government where we have a strong mayor and the mayor has to show up every day.

582
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:26,523
If this isn't what we want to do, let's go back to the plan E form of government where we have a town manager who will listen to the wishes of the council.

583
01:00:27,683 --> 01:00:30,064
And that's the only thing, but I say, but you know,

584
01:00:31,031 --> 01:00:37,313
How do we wanna get, you know, we keep talking about we're in trouble, we're in trouble here, but who's gonna get us out of this trouble?

585
01:00:37,654 --> 01:00:44,516
We can do two and a half overrides, we can do debt exclusions, but if we put it back in the same hands, where are we gonna be again?

586
01:00:45,757 --> 01:00:48,438
We're gonna be back here where we were right now.

587
01:00:49,678 --> 01:00:51,719
And as I said, this is not a personal attack against the mayor.

588
01:00:52,539 --> 01:00:55,980
Again, it's just that, you know, like Councilor Knight says, you gotta show up every day.

589
01:00:57,341 --> 01:00:58,621
This is the job.

590
01:00:59,342 --> 01:00:59,822
I don't know why,

591
01:01:00,211 --> 01:01:00,931
Any other way to put it?

592
01:01:01,732 --> 01:01:07,255
Again, I say, you know, we can continue to talk about it, talk about it.

593
01:01:07,876 --> 01:01:16,421
We can take the action, but if we hand the money over to the same group, we're gonna be back in the same bucket we're in now.

594
01:01:17,442 --> 01:01:19,503
And again, Councilor Baez, I thank you for all the work you put in.

595
01:01:19,523 --> 01:01:21,564
It was an excellent presentation.

596
01:01:21,764 --> 01:01:22,845
It's true.

597
01:01:23,385 --> 01:01:23,746
It's true.

598
01:01:23,806 --> 01:01:27,448
And we were elected to make some tough decisions.

599
01:01:28,823 --> 01:01:32,545
They're not always popular or make people happy, but that's what we do.

600
01:01:32,885 --> 01:01:39,348
We make tough decisions and the administration has to make tough decisions also.

601
01:01:39,648 --> 01:01:43,630
Don't just keep throwing on this group to throw out the bad news to everybody.

602
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:47,972
They need to start making tough decisions for the city going forward.

603
01:01:49,253 --> 01:01:50,193
Thank you, Councilor Farbello.

604
01:01:50,213 --> 01:01:50,954
Vice President Farris.

605
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:52,374
Thank you, Madam President.

606
01:01:52,394 --> 01:01:53,475
I'll keep it brief.

607
01:01:54,375 --> 01:01:57,697
First, I just want to say part of the discussion

608
01:01:58,811 --> 01:02:01,373
around these options, I think is right to your point.

609
01:02:02,474 --> 01:02:05,436
You know, would I feel comfortable going to the voters just for willy nilly anything?

610
01:02:05,796 --> 01:02:09,538
No, I'd wanna hear demonstrated from that office.

611
01:02:10,399 --> 01:02:16,443
This is why we don't need it, or if we can't prove that we don't need it, this is exactly what we need it for.

612
01:02:16,523 --> 01:02:22,807
So I don't disagree with you at all that there needs to be accountability and clear, clear path if we're gonna go down that road.

613
01:02:23,828 --> 01:02:27,451
What I really wanna say is just to anyone watching this,

614
01:02:29,018 --> 01:02:34,659
who's been watching over the past, has it only been seven days since our first budget hearing?

615
01:02:34,699 --> 01:02:54,483
It feels like seven weeks, but over the past seven days to anyone who's been watching, I think you found a very unexpected unity of belief and commitment and the ideas of how we move forward here around this budget from

616
01:02:56,142 --> 01:03:01,764
a group of people who come from different political backgrounds and different political affiliations.

617
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:21,552
Whoever thought our revolution and Adam Knight and George Scarpelli and Rick Carviello would all be equally outraged about something, or that they would all agree to the same set of facts about a situation, or that they would all say, you know, we have to have these serious conversations.

618
01:03:23,372 --> 01:03:24,113
It's amazing.

619
01:03:25,113 --> 01:03:33,638
when something is truly wrong and when the truth is truly not out there, how much that can unify people and unify a community.

620
01:03:34,238 --> 01:03:49,107
And I just wanna close by saying that the truth, if it is ever said and released and comes out about what has happened to bring us to this point, if the mayor chooses to do that, that can unify this community too.

621
01:03:50,375 --> 01:03:51,916
And I hope that's what will happen.

622
01:03:52,176 --> 01:03:56,177
That is the goal of what I've put forward tonight is to just get everyone on the same page.

623
01:03:56,978 --> 01:03:57,958
This is what happened.

624
01:03:59,379 --> 01:04:11,264
And to be honest, one of the most important traits of leadership, it's just admitting when you made a mistake and being willing to say that this is what happened.

625
01:04:11,684 --> 01:04:14,725
This is why we made the mistake and this is how we're fixing it.

626
01:04:15,165 --> 01:04:16,126
And if that came out,

627
01:04:17,058 --> 01:04:25,341
there would be a lot more trust and a lot more collaboration and a lot less confusion and misunderstanding.

628
01:04:26,122 --> 01:04:30,243
And quite frankly, a lot less finger pointing, because that's what's happening here.

629
01:04:30,303 --> 01:04:32,944
It's, you know, we're getting fingers pointed at us all the time.

630
01:04:34,305 --> 01:04:35,105
Why'd you say this?

631
01:04:35,185 --> 01:04:36,006
Why'd you do that?

632
01:04:36,126 --> 01:04:37,086
Why aren't you doing this?

633
01:04:38,126 --> 01:04:41,648
That's no way to be a unified city that's going to achieve

634
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:47,122
a real plan to catch up to all of our neighbors who have passed us by.

635
01:04:47,543 --> 01:05:02,750
We're in the best position, all of them, if you ask me, we're a little piece of every one of our neighbors here in Medford, different communities, different neighborhoods, different visions of what a city can be all in one with a river that unites us at a location that is in such demand.

636
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:05,932
I can't even begin to tell you how much people wanna come here.

637
01:05:06,592 --> 01:05:09,434
All we have to do is come together

638
01:05:10,127 --> 01:05:17,609
get that plan out there, and let's just see the amazing things that can happen here in Medford.

639
01:05:17,669 --> 01:05:19,990
So the only way we're gonna get there is with the truth.

640
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:27,232
This is an attempt to seek truth, and I hope that our partner across the hall in the executive branch will meet us there.

641
01:05:27,532 --> 01:05:28,473
Thank you, Madam President.

642
01:05:29,073 --> 01:05:30,013
Thank you, Vice President Bares.

643
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:31,594
Any further discussion from the council?

644
01:05:35,335 --> 01:05:35,975
Councilor Collins.

645
01:05:37,754 --> 01:05:45,143
Not knowing if it's already on the table, I just wanted to make a motion to approve the recommendations included in Vice President Behrs' presentation.

646
01:05:46,765 --> 01:05:53,714
We have a motion on the floor from Councilor Collins to approve Councilor Behrs' recommendations.

647
01:05:54,335 --> 01:05:55,336
Before we get to that, if I could.

648
01:05:56,803 --> 01:05:58,644
to speak from the chair, I will be brief.

649
01:05:59,405 --> 01:06:05,470
I know that sometimes folks, members of the public, presidents may say, we need to cut more from the budget.

650
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:06,791
Clearly there's some fat to cut.

651
01:06:06,931 --> 01:06:11,634
And I really encourage you to attend our meetings, to look at the budget sheets.

652
01:06:12,015 --> 01:06:16,238
We haven't been given them in a way that can be made readily available to the public when that is available.

653
01:06:16,758 --> 01:06:22,803
I encourage you to look at the budget because what is offered to our departments is so, so bare bones.

654
01:06:23,484 --> 01:06:24,725
There's really nowhere to cut.

655
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:28,046
We already aren't offering the services that people deserve.

656
01:06:28,226 --> 01:06:29,147
There's nowhere to cut.

657
01:06:29,327 --> 01:06:31,208
So I just encourage people to look at that.

658
01:06:32,168 --> 01:06:38,832
And then also as Vice President Baird said, this is not a challenge that occurred overnight, but it's something that's come to roost.

659
01:06:39,612 --> 01:06:54,260
And I think we've seen tonight more creativity around solutions offered by this council in this meeting, and even resulting from our previous work of how to raise revenue for this city than has been presented to us by the administration.

660
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:57,433
because level funding is not creative.

661
01:06:58,053 --> 01:07:06,976
As we've seen tonight, as we saw in our Committee of the Whole, level funding does not provide level service, and level funding means vastly different things to different departments.

662
01:07:07,296 --> 01:07:20,901
When we level fund a budget for a library as the same small space where it had services from that building and occupied, you're not gonna get the level of service that you deserve, that residents deserve.

663
01:07:22,322 --> 01:07:27,204
And I wanna, I'll end with a quote that I've used in past years, and that a budget is a moral document.

664
01:07:28,125 --> 01:07:30,046
We fund what we value.

665
01:07:31,326 --> 01:07:35,168
And we have been shown by this administration, we'll just say two things, we haven't covered every budget.

666
01:07:35,588 --> 01:07:45,773
We've been showed that the administration does not value the new library, and the administration does not value the work that this body does, and the work that is asked for by residents for us to do.

667
01:07:45,793 --> 01:07:47,854
And just two budgets reflect that.

668
01:07:48,475 --> 01:07:48,915
So thank you.

669
01:07:50,284 --> 01:07:53,165
We do have a number of residents who want to speak on Zoom.

670
01:07:53,246 --> 01:07:58,288
Also, if anyone would like to speak in the chambers, feel free to line up.

671
01:08:00,269 --> 01:08:01,490
I will start with Zoom.

672
01:08:04,771 --> 01:08:06,812
Mr. Castagnetti, name and address for the record, please.

673
01:08:08,894 --> 01:08:13,476
Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street, East Medford, Massachusetts.

674
01:08:14,196 --> 01:08:16,277
Thank you for your attention, Madam President.

675
01:08:18,639 --> 01:08:19,239
And the last

676
01:08:20,205 --> 01:08:24,686
One and a half years, it seems everyone wants free cash.

677
01:08:27,427 --> 01:08:35,130
From the federal government, the state government to the local cities and towns, it seems everybody wants free cash.

678
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:40,171
And what we have is massive inflation.

679
01:08:42,412 --> 01:08:46,773
I saw RAC 61, make it 69 on this zoom meeting.

680
01:08:51,242 --> 01:08:57,525
And I figured prop two and a half override was coming or and a dead exclusion.

681
01:08:58,026 --> 01:08:59,807
And sure enough, I must be a psychic.

682
01:09:00,567 --> 01:09:09,772
You mentioned it many times, a lot of you, but not, but you know something, not here.

683
01:09:09,792 --> 01:09:12,613
It never happened ever before in Medford.

684
01:09:13,694 --> 01:09:15,175
This is not Winchester.

685
01:09:17,536 --> 01:09:19,397
As Dr. Starella says,

686
01:09:20,308 --> 01:09:47,683
cut the fat and make do with the 200 million dollar budget and also I gotta add this because it's my baby can I can you hear me this city is working on skin and bones and skeletons but there's nothing to cut here please don't talk about making cuts because there's nothing to cut here

687
01:09:50,884 --> 01:09:52,044
I'm not saying cut.

688
01:09:52,124 --> 01:09:56,546
I'm telling you to make do with the $200 million budget, which would be an all time record.

689
01:09:56,826 --> 01:09:58,067
And let me finish, please.

690
01:09:58,447 --> 01:10:00,307
I know you have point of information.

691
01:10:00,647 --> 01:10:01,828
I'd like to end with one sentence.

692
01:10:02,908 --> 01:10:03,828
Can you hear me please?

693
01:10:04,489 --> 01:10:05,009
We can hear you.

694
01:10:06,609 --> 01:10:07,010
Thank you.

695
01:10:07,650 --> 01:10:16,513
And be mindful you the city have not ever adopted to give us the real estate tax, the home tax exemption.

696
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:19,114
It's not fair for the last 23 years.

697
01:10:21,291 --> 01:10:22,011
Come on, man.

698
01:10:22,631 --> 01:10:23,012
Thank you.

699
01:10:24,713 --> 01:10:34,460
To your point, I just want to know we were trying to hold that meeting with our chief assessor to learn more about what that process might be just as a fact finding she quit.

700
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:38,022
The city so unfortunately we can't have that meeting until we have someone in that position.

701
01:10:38,062 --> 01:10:39,203
So I just want to make that clear.

702
01:10:39,223 --> 01:10:43,186
Yeah, I know that maybe maybe in a couple of years before I get to old world.

703
01:10:44,107 --> 01:10:45,648
Thank you, Mr. Cassidy.

704
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:50,211
Bill Giglio name and address for the record, please.

705
01:10:55,656 --> 01:11:03,842
I mean, I'm definitely not opposed to an override if it's used for specific reasons.

706
01:11:04,963 --> 01:11:16,212
I think, you know, Zach, I shouldn't say names, but people on this council have been pushing for an override since they've been trying to get elected two years ago, you know, since their first term.

707
01:11:16,232 --> 01:11:20,215
So this just happened to fall on their lap as a great opportunity to bring a presentation.

708
01:11:20,235 --> 01:11:22,056
And the presentation was actually pretty good.

709
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:34,022
Uh, my, my question is though, if, if there is any type of an override, is there like, will, will, you know, the four councils up there that are always, uh, advocating for, you know, people's rent getting raised.

710
01:11:34,042 --> 01:11:37,683
I mean, that's what it's going to, will, will, will that all stop?

711
01:11:37,703 --> 01:11:42,944
Because when you start raising someone's taxes, especially a landlord, they're going to pass it on to the owners.

712
01:11:42,984 --> 01:11:46,485
And then we're going to hear that the cost of living and rent control and all that.

713
01:11:46,505 --> 01:11:51,787
So I'm just hoping, you know, if, if there is a, uh, an override that, you know, four members of the revolution will stop.

714
01:11:52,959 --> 01:11:56,346
you know, crying about the rent control, about rent, that's all.

715
01:11:57,489 --> 01:11:58,511
Thank you, Mr. Giglio.

716
01:11:59,873 --> 01:12:00,054
Yep.

717
01:12:01,577 --> 01:12:03,000
Anna, name and address for the record, please.

718
01:12:08,593 --> 01:12:09,454
Oh, sorry.

719
01:12:10,094 --> 01:12:10,414
Sorry.

720
01:12:10,715 --> 01:12:11,155
Uh, yeah.

721
01:12:11,255 --> 01:12:11,535
Sorry.

722
01:12:11,975 --> 01:12:12,116
Um.

723
01:12:12,136 --> 01:12:13,717
I don't know.

724
01:12:13,737 --> 01:12:16,239
Virovsky 20 Pleasant Street.

725
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:23,284
Uh I wanted to thank Vice President bears for the excellent presentation.

726
01:12:24,164 --> 01:12:25,745
Um and thank the whole council for, um.

727
01:12:27,186 --> 01:12:28,768
You're you know, clear

728
01:12:39,471 --> 01:12:45,094
the mayor to tell us all what has happened, which I really appreciate.

729
01:12:45,254 --> 01:12:49,957
I didn't learn about any of this until about the last week.

730
01:12:50,677 --> 01:12:59,362
And I just wanted to say that I first learned about this issue from checking out some books from the library.

731
01:13:00,362 --> 01:13:02,043
I'm a parent of a four and a half year old.

732
01:13:03,584 --> 01:13:08,067
And when I went to the library, the librarian handed me a sheet that said,

733
01:13:08,725 --> 01:13:10,166
There's a budget meeting on Tuesday.

734
01:13:10,526 --> 01:13:14,368
We have catastrophic cuts to the library this year in the budget.

735
01:13:14,548 --> 01:13:15,989
We would really appreciate your support.

736
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:34,080
And I just wanted to make it really clear how much the library means to me, particularly as a parent of a kid who is not eligible for vaccination against COVID, yet there are really not that many places that I feel comfortable going.

737
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:36,401
Our lives are really curtailed.

738
01:13:38,215 --> 01:13:49,744
and have been for the last two and a half years, which is really not the way that parenting, it's not a really mentally sustainable mode of parenting or of existing as a non-parent.

739
01:13:50,805 --> 01:14:00,313
And the library is really just vital to our mental health and our education of our kid and him being around people.

740
01:14:00,573 --> 01:14:06,858
And so the idea that the children's room wouldn't be able to be open

741
01:14:07,841 --> 01:14:23,034
because of level funding is really distressing to me and the idea that the library wouldn't be able to be open on Saturdays because the budget was unable to provide for that funding is also really distressing.

742
01:14:24,659 --> 01:14:35,726
So the library is just, I think, and I'm sure, I know that parents are not the only members of the community for whom the library is really a vital provider of many different kinds of services.

743
01:14:37,047 --> 01:14:40,049
So that's all I wanted to say.

744
01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:42,091
Thank you, Anna.

745
01:14:43,231 --> 01:14:45,093
Any further discussion?

746
01:14:45,113 --> 01:14:46,694
Any members of the public would like to speak?

747
01:14:49,476 --> 01:14:50,997
Seeing none, we do have a motion.

748
01:14:52,277 --> 01:14:58,941
or Councilor Collins to approve to vote on the recommendations from Vice President Baird's presentation.

749
01:14:59,461 --> 01:15:08,266
Could you please read back those recommendations so that I know you can send them to the, if you want to summarize them, you can send them to the clerk, but just so the public knows what we're voting on.

750
01:15:08,746 --> 01:15:18,413
Um, it may be even easier if I were to just put them on the agenda next week for for the council and then they're on the agenda the public can see them we can all vote on them.

751
01:15:19,153 --> 01:15:29,681
Sounds to me like we have agreement tonight, and presentation is not going to change between now and next week because it's just a fact so I'm happy to put those on the agenda for next week's meeting and we can vote on them there.

752
01:15:30,121 --> 01:15:30,441
Thank you.

753
01:15:30,561 --> 01:15:32,523
Do I have a motion on the floor for the paper in general.

754
01:15:35,778 --> 01:15:38,660
We're receiving this motion to receive the paper in place on file.

755
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:44,643
On a motion of vices and bears to receive in place on file seconded by Councillor Carviello.

756
01:15:45,103 --> 01:15:46,224
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

757
01:15:57,070 --> 01:15:57,891
Vice President bears.

758
01:15:57,911 --> 01:15:58,171
Yes.

759
01:15:59,052 --> 01:15:59,772
Council carry on.

760
01:15:59,832 --> 01:16:00,092
Yes.

761
01:16:00,833 --> 01:16:01,553
Council Collins.

762
01:16:01,753 --> 01:16:01,953
Yes.

763
01:16:02,494 --> 01:16:03,034
Council night.

764
01:16:03,134 --> 01:16:03,414
Yes.

765
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:14,048
Yeah, he's been going in and out.

766
01:16:15,549 --> 01:16:17,050
Actually don't see him at the moment.

767
01:16:17,090 --> 01:16:19,872
I'm gonna skip Councilor Scarpelli for a second and go to Councilor Sang.

768
01:16:20,072 --> 01:16:20,292
Yes.

769
01:16:21,313 --> 01:16:21,913
President Morrell.

770
01:16:22,113 --> 01:16:22,333
Yes.

771
01:16:23,394 --> 01:16:25,055
And I'm gonna try Councilor Scarpelli one more time.

772
01:16:25,395 --> 01:16:27,437
I know he's been having trouble getting in and out of the presentation.

773
01:16:27,477 --> 01:16:29,198
Yeah, I don't see him on.

774
01:16:29,218 --> 01:16:32,520
Okay, I'm gonna mark him as absent for now, but he may come back to change that vote.

775
01:16:38,589 --> 01:16:43,833
Okay, so six in the affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

776
01:16:46,274 --> 01:16:54,640
On the motion of Councilor Knight to revert back to the regular order of business, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

777
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:57,862
As I don't see Councilor Scarpelian, can we do a roll call vote?

778
01:16:59,983 --> 01:17:00,664
All those in favor?

779
01:17:01,344 --> 01:17:01,905
All those opposed?

780
01:17:01,945 --> 01:17:02,485
Motion passes.

781
01:17:03,146 --> 01:17:05,287
Vice-President Behrs, if you could tag in for a second.

782
01:17:30,198 --> 01:17:38,384
that the records.

783
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:40,105
We're gonna come back to the records at the end of the meeting.

784
01:17:40,125 --> 01:17:42,327
We'll start with reports of committees.

785
01:17:43,348 --> 01:17:48,832
Reports of committees, 22-354, June 7th, 2022, committee of the whole report to follow.

786
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:50,833
This was our first budget meeting.

787
01:17:52,755 --> 01:17:58,599
Motion to approve, Councilor Caravaglio, seconded by Councilor Knight.

788
01:17:58,679 --> 01:17:59,260
All those in favor?

789
01:18:00,473 --> 01:18:00,973
Opposed?

790
01:18:01,433 --> 01:18:04,554
Motion passes.

791
01:18:04,574 --> 01:18:07,214
22-354, Wednesday, June 8th, Committee of the Whole report, budget meetings.

792
01:18:08,894 --> 01:18:11,735
Motion, Councilor Carviello, seconded by Councilor Knight to approve.

793
01:18:11,795 --> 01:18:12,555
All those in favor?

794
01:18:13,375 --> 01:18:14,135
All those opposed?

795
01:18:14,775 --> 01:18:15,616
Motion passes.

796
01:18:15,636 --> 01:18:27,198
22-380, on 22-380, motion to table from Councilor Carviello, seconded by Councilor Sang.

797
01:18:27,238 --> 01:18:27,918
All those in favor?

798
01:18:27,938 --> 01:18:29,258
Opposed?

799
01:18:30,137 --> 01:18:46,272
Motion passes to table 22 dash 38 to offer by counselor night be it so resolved that the city administration legal department report back to the council on what steps the council can take to give city employees and retirees preference in the city's affordable housing lottery programs counselor night.

800
01:18:47,072 --> 01:18:51,997
Mr. President, thank you very much as we've all had discussions and talked about the cost of living here in the city of mentioned.

801
01:18:52,507 --> 01:18:55,852
We've also talked about the fact that many of our department heads don't live in this community.

802
01:18:56,914 --> 01:19:00,318
And we also talked about the fact that many of the people that work in this community can't afford to live there.

803
01:19:01,079 --> 01:19:09,171
This council has been at the forefront of affordable housing issues looking at creating an affordable housing trust fund, looking at examining housing production plan.

804
01:19:09,998 --> 01:19:14,420
utilizing Community Preservation Act funds to create affordable housing opportunities here in the community.

805
01:19:15,241 --> 01:19:28,027
This is something they did in Philadelphia, Mr. President, where they passed a council ordinance that required preference be given to city employee and retirees in the city of Philadelphia, and they apply for affordable housing lotteries.

806
01:19:28,107 --> 01:19:34,450
So if you think about it, the people that, you know, work for our city and our school department are retirees, they're the people that actually

807
01:19:35,631 --> 01:19:51,103
You know, give their blood, sweat and tears to the community they're a part of the fabric of this community they want to stay in the community they live in they might be overhoused underemployed or under income, and can meet the guidelines, why not keep these people in the community instead of forcing them out by allowing them the opportunity to get a preference in affordable housing.

808
01:19:51,123 --> 01:19:54,666
Now this isn't to say that this is something that you want to pass or don't want to pass what I'm asking for.

809
01:19:55,387 --> 01:19:56,648
is what steps we can take.

810
01:19:56,908 --> 01:19:59,871
And then hopefully we can get a document or a draft to work off of.

811
01:19:59,951 --> 01:20:07,897
So I don't wanna say, you know, this is gonna be the end all be all at the end of the day, but there should be a process in place that we can look at and examine to see if this is something that would be worthwhile.

812
01:20:09,499 --> 01:20:10,079
Thank you, Councilor.

813
01:20:10,099 --> 01:20:10,840
Councilor Collins.

814
01:20:11,637 --> 01:20:14,538
Thank you vice president bears and thank you councillor knife for putting this forward.

815
01:20:15,539 --> 01:20:24,562
As you just said, I'm not sure of my stance on this so far I'm not sure I agree with giving city employees retirees preference over equally eligible people but until far as this is just a request for information.

816
01:20:25,002 --> 01:20:28,544
I'm all certainly supported tonight.

817
01:20:28,564 --> 01:20:30,304
Sorry about that I was getting a message from the clerk.

818
01:20:31,005 --> 01:20:31,785
Is there anything I need to do.

819
01:20:32,405 --> 01:20:33,446
Nope.

820
01:20:33,806 --> 01:20:37,287
So, on the motion that counts and I'd seconded by Councilor Carvio.

821
01:20:37,747 --> 01:20:38,408
All those in favor.

822
01:20:39,507 --> 01:20:43,629
Opposed motion passes 22 dash three eight three offered by counselor night.

823
01:20:44,030 --> 01:20:51,834
It's so resolved that the city included crosswalk restoration of the curbing on the corner of Rockwell Terrace and Fulton Street as part of the Gillis Park accessibility project counselor night.

824
01:20:52,094 --> 01:20:53,154
Mr. President, thank you very much.

825
01:20:53,295 --> 01:21:00,458
This location is a crosswalk, and the crosswalk is fine to fall into disrepair the curb stone is totally completely removed going around the corner.

826
01:21:00,919 --> 01:21:07,282
If you know Rockwell Terrace Rockwell Terrace is the street that would stretch between Hickey Park and Gillis Park.

827
01:21:07,842 --> 01:21:08,763
It's a small little cut through.

828
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:22,477
Um, that is traversed quite a bit by, um, the league baseball players, uh, dog walkers, people that utilize in the parking lot, like, um, it's a safe pathway for individuals to cut through, um, and utilize the open space.

829
01:21:22,537 --> 01:21:25,621
But, uh, the sidewalk has fallen at the disrepair of the homeowner on the corner.

830
01:21:26,202 --> 01:21:39,850
is now being faced with the situation where many vehicles and cars are parking up on the curb, very close to the home, to the point where, you know, she can't even walk by on the sidewalk to get into her house because the curb stones gone so cars are edging closer and closer and closer to her home.

831
01:21:40,657 --> 01:21:42,538
but this looks like it's something that's an easy fix.

832
01:21:42,558 --> 01:21:45,040
They're doing the Gillis Park accessibility project.

833
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:48,582
There's a construction project that's underway right now that we just funded.

834
01:21:48,642 --> 01:21:56,507
So I'm hoping that based upon the reports that came out of the OCD and the status of that project and how it's moving along, that this is something that can be added in there.

835
01:21:56,807 --> 01:21:58,108
It should be a really low cost item.

836
01:21:58,148 --> 01:22:03,231
It's just some granite curb stoning that needs to be put in and a little bit of asphalt or concrete.

837
01:22:03,351 --> 01:22:04,352
So it's not something that's going to

838
01:22:04,733 --> 01:22:09,515
break the bank, the crosswalk doesn't have to be designed, it's already been designed, it's already there, it's just in disrepair.

839
01:22:09,815 --> 01:22:13,857
So I'm hoping that this is something that can be addressed by the administration, but I would not hold my breath.

840
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:18,779
Motion of Councilor Knight to approve, seconded by Councilor Caviello.

841
01:22:18,839 --> 01:22:19,559
All those in favor?

842
01:22:19,919 --> 01:22:20,059
Aye.

843
01:22:20,399 --> 01:22:20,839
Opposed?

844
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:22,720
Motion passes.

845
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:23,761
We're gonna skip my motion.

846
01:22:23,781 --> 01:22:32,364
We'll go to 22-386 offered by Councilor Knight, being so resolved that the Medford Chamber of Commerce be invented to discuss parking needs and potential for a parking garage in Medford Square.

847
01:22:32,975 --> 01:22:36,337
Mr. President, this item is also on public participation portion of our agenda.

848
01:22:36,377 --> 01:22:45,281
This evening, we have Mr. Carroll and Mr. Kamara, both from the Chamber of Commerce that we're here, we're waiting to speak on it, where the night was going not quite according to agenda or plan.

849
01:22:45,841 --> 01:22:57,747
I suggest to the gentleman that we could pass this resolution that's on the agenda this evening, not worry about that public participation paper, and they can come back at a later date to present on what their questions and concerns are surrounding the garage.

850
01:22:58,435 --> 01:22:59,896
Okay, Mr. President, yes.

851
01:23:00,957 --> 01:23:03,419
So, be one of the counselors on the council.

852
01:23:04,039 --> 01:23:06,441
When the garage came up 2013 14.

853
01:23:08,603 --> 01:23:10,844
I was one of the four votes voted for the garage.

854
01:23:12,085 --> 01:23:12,726
We need five.

855
01:23:13,867 --> 01:23:17,810
And we had $6 million from the state for the garage.

856
01:23:18,830 --> 01:23:20,432
If, if I were married voted on it.

857
01:23:21,512 --> 01:23:24,775
The garage will be up, it will be generating income.

858
01:23:25,142 --> 01:23:27,243
and we wouldn't even be having this conversation.

859
01:23:27,523 --> 01:23:36,227
We had a second crack at the apple for this year, when then Congressman Mackey got us $2 million federal funding for the garage, failed again.

860
01:23:37,048 --> 01:23:47,513
So, again, this garage should have been up and going, but as I said, certain people in the city didn't vote for it, and that's why we're talking about it today.

861
01:23:47,793 --> 01:23:52,295
It should have been up at probably a third of the cost though, and it's gonna cost us now.

862
01:23:53,395 --> 01:23:54,516
Thank you, Councilor Carriello.

863
01:23:55,348 --> 01:24:00,822
for the discussion on the motion of Council night to a second seconded by Councilor carmielo all those in favor.

864
01:24:04,329 --> 01:24:07,431
Motion passes.

865
01:24:07,451 --> 01:24:08,832
Speaking from the chair, Mr. President.

866
01:24:09,373 --> 01:24:10,754
About President Morales.

867
01:24:10,914 --> 01:24:12,715
Or the town hall guide, whichever one you feel.

868
01:24:13,996 --> 01:24:17,939
I'd actually like to go to Mr. Carroll's public participation paper.

869
01:24:17,959 --> 01:24:19,860
Oh, I just took care of that one.

870
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:20,520
Did we table it?

871
01:24:21,021 --> 01:24:25,244
Well, because I had the same paper on the agenda and he had the public participation.

872
01:24:25,264 --> 01:24:27,205
So I said, we won't worry about the public participation.

873
01:24:27,225 --> 01:24:28,966
We'll just pass this paper, which we just did.

874
01:24:29,066 --> 01:24:30,007
Okay, so do we need to?

875
01:24:30,367 --> 01:24:30,948
Nope, it's done.

876
01:24:31,468 --> 01:24:32,369
Okay, great, okay.

877
01:24:33,389 --> 01:24:40,375
then if folks do not mind me speaking from the chair on the town hall guide, it's very simple resolution.

878
01:24:40,415 --> 01:24:41,055
Any objection?

879
01:24:41,475 --> 01:24:43,977
Go for it.

880
01:24:43,997 --> 01:24:59,609
22-385 offered by Vice President Behrs, be it so resolved by the Medford City Council that residents of Medford be notified of an inaccurate and false mailing sent out by quote, town hall guide that was not sent by the city of Medford and contains incorrect contact information for city departments and emergency services.

881
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:11,248
I was made aware that a mailing has gone out, kind of like a magnet you'd put on something or a calendar that just has like 508 area codes for the city of Medford for our police for our city departments.

882
01:25:11,889 --> 01:25:19,054
There's kind of some seals on it that make it seem like it may be an official document and I think it's worth letting people know that is not an official document.

883
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:25,079
Motion of counselor night to approve seconded by Councilor carb yellow all those in favor.

884
01:25:25,099 --> 01:25:27,341
I was opposed motion passes.

885
01:25:29,559 --> 01:25:31,153
Public participation.

886
01:25:35,215 --> 01:25:38,156
to the Honorable City Council, June 8th, 2022.

887
01:25:38,256 --> 01:25:40,597
Councilors, the undersigned respectfully pray for.

888
01:25:40,617 --> 01:25:44,138
I would like to speak and try to get help with the ongoing issue of my mother's sidewalks.

889
01:25:44,758 --> 01:25:46,379
She is handicapped, so I am helping her.

890
01:25:46,399 --> 01:25:49,239
I've been trying to get them done since before COVID started.

891
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:57,402
I had engineering DPW and tree warning down on a site meeting in October, 2021, and was guaranteed they would be completed by the end of October, which it is not.

892
01:25:57,842 --> 01:25:59,563
I have photos of how bad the sidewalks are.

893
01:26:00,583 --> 01:26:02,584
using a tape measure due to the lack of drainage.

894
01:26:02,624 --> 01:26:04,045
The curbing is sinking as well.

895
01:26:04,245 --> 01:26:08,967
I tried going through the mayor, but have yet to be able to set up a meeting with her since before Easter.

896
01:26:09,467 --> 01:26:14,589
Signed Erica Chavez from Cabot Road and her mom's address is on Sydney Street.

897
01:26:15,930 --> 01:26:16,250
Is Ms.

898
01:26:16,270 --> 01:26:19,491
Chavez available on Zoom?

899
01:26:19,571 --> 01:26:20,531
Do we have a hand up?

900
01:26:27,614 --> 01:26:28,035
I don't see.

901
01:26:30,545 --> 01:26:31,446
Well, that's a different name.

902
01:26:31,506 --> 01:26:32,366
I don't believe that's her.

903
01:26:33,607 --> 01:26:34,028
It's not.

904
01:26:36,730 --> 01:26:41,733
Just give one more chance, if you could raise your hand on Zoom using the raise hand function.

905
01:26:47,097 --> 01:26:54,923
All right, on the motion to table, Mr. Clerk, if you could please reach out to this member and let them know that it's tabled and we'd be happy to take it up next week.

906
01:26:54,983 --> 01:27:00,267
And also if they could let us know if they'll be present, we would be able to recognize them

907
01:27:01,981 --> 01:27:03,421
at the beginning, potentially, of the meeting.

908
01:27:04,422 --> 01:27:08,944
On the motion of the table of Councilor Crabiello, and that would be included in unfinished business, correct?

909
01:27:09,524 --> 01:27:10,684
Seconded by Councilor Knight.

910
01:27:11,305 --> 01:27:12,025
All those in favor?

911
01:27:12,825 --> 01:27:13,566
All those opposed?

912
01:27:13,646 --> 01:27:14,426
Motion passes.

913
01:27:15,927 --> 01:27:16,567
Want me to keep going?

914
01:27:17,707 --> 01:27:18,047
Okay.

915
01:27:25,110 --> 01:27:25,751
Yeah, sorry.

916
01:27:26,391 --> 01:27:27,051
I should keep going.

917
01:27:27,692 --> 01:27:28,072
It's the,

918
01:27:30,029 --> 01:27:30,169
22-387, bus.

919
01:27:35,902 --> 01:27:36,602
Would you like to read it?

920
01:27:37,122 --> 01:27:40,183
Yes, I should tonight.

921
01:27:40,203 --> 01:27:42,023
22-387 offered by President Morrell.

922
01:27:42,483 --> 01:27:51,065
Be it so resolved that Medford City Council requests that the MBTA hold an in-person meeting to solicit feedback from residents on the bus network redesign and its impacts on the inner core.

923
01:27:51,585 --> 01:27:58,466
Be it further resolved that the administration notice the entire city about virtual meeting of the bus network redesign to take place June 16th at 6 p.m.

924
01:27:58,526 --> 01:28:00,726
on Zoom, and I believe that is a meeting hosted by the MBTA.

925
01:28:01,407 --> 01:28:01,727
Correct.

926
01:28:02,247 --> 01:28:03,387
Councilor Morrell, President Morrell.

927
01:28:03,748 --> 01:28:04,629
Thank you, Mr. President.

928
01:28:04,689 --> 01:28:09,973
So this, I'm sure this happened to my fellow counselors as well I had a number of residents reach out to me.

929
01:28:10,953 --> 01:28:19,840
Some good neighbors are spreading the word about this bus redesign project which counts are saying, to his credit, I did bring up a previous motion letting people know about this.

930
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:25,684
It's, you know, not everyone watches the city council meeting so we're just now getting around and one of the main issues that we're hitting against is

931
01:28:26,805 --> 01:28:46,633
A lot of elderly people, a lot of people, you know that take the bus may not have access, you know, to a zoom meeting maybe at work during this time and so this is asking that the MBTA hold an in person meeting for those folks impacted in the inner core which is what includes Medford so the MBTA is hosting a number of in person meetings but the vast majority of them are in Boston.

932
01:28:47,413 --> 01:28:51,497
and communities that aren't Medford and communities that aren't actually, I believe, in the inner core.

933
01:28:51,617 --> 01:28:55,300
So they're leaving a lot of folks out from this decision making.

934
01:28:55,400 --> 01:29:13,336
So my hope is perhaps we do have someone who has some close contacts at the MBTA, perhaps the city clerk who worked for the MBTA could help us in nudging them to have an in-person meeting so that folks can submit their feedback to this and also

935
01:29:14,768 --> 01:29:20,793
I will work my hardest and also again, working with the city clerk so that we can have that committee of the whole as councilor center requested.

936
01:29:20,873 --> 01:29:30,440
So also in lieu of a dedicated MBTA meeting, perhaps we can have a committee of the whole where we can have an MBTA representative attend before the comment period is closed.

937
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:34,603
So that would be something we'd be looking at for before or around our summer meeting.

938
01:29:35,324 --> 01:29:38,446
That way residents can at least attend that in person.

939
01:29:38,486 --> 01:29:41,529
We can communicate that feedback through the public comment form.

940
01:29:42,009 --> 01:29:46,850
I also do just want to note that, again, there is a public comment form if folks aren't aware.

941
01:29:46,910 --> 01:29:51,351
So if you've already seen the plan and you have thoughts on it, please submit your comments.

942
01:29:51,411 --> 01:29:52,632
This is not a done deal.

943
01:29:52,672 --> 01:29:53,812
This is a lot of ideas.

944
01:29:54,892 --> 01:30:05,575
And we want to get feedback from as many residents as possible and get feedback from those folks that are actually using these services who might not be able to attend that Zoom meeting for a variety of reasons.

945
01:30:05,915 --> 01:30:10,816
So letting them know about the Zoom meeting if they can attend, working with the city clerk to see if we can get

946
01:30:12,076 --> 01:30:24,739
the MBTA to host their own meeting, and then also working with the city clerk to see if we can get the MBTA, get an MBTA representative to attend a future Committee of the Whole so that we can solicit feedback from all of our residents that are gonna be impacted by this redesign.

947
01:30:26,579 --> 01:30:27,419
And I move approval.

948
01:30:27,739 --> 01:30:27,980
Second.

949
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:29,420
Thank you, President Morrell.

950
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:31,420
Any further discussion?

951
01:30:36,921 --> 01:30:38,642
On the 16th, yes, we will be at a budget hearing.

952
01:30:38,662 --> 01:30:39,022
Correct.

953
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:43,214
and not to speak for the president, it may be in another budget hearing next week.

954
01:30:44,996 --> 01:30:46,738
So the process continues.

955
01:30:48,199 --> 01:30:52,224
On the motion of President Morrell, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

956
01:30:52,885 --> 01:30:53,565
All those in favor?

957
01:30:53,585 --> 01:30:54,106
Aye.

958
01:30:55,067 --> 01:30:55,688
Opposed?

959
01:30:56,028 --> 01:30:57,069
Motion passes.

960
01:30:59,894 --> 01:31:01,535
I, yes, one moment.

961
01:31:02,815 --> 01:31:05,997
I'm happy to mediate public participation.

962
01:31:06,477 --> 01:31:08,278
And then the last thing we have is the record.

963
01:31:08,419 --> 01:31:11,300
So maybe, and I'm gonna- All right, I'll come back up.

964
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:15,843
But so public participation, if there's a member of the public who'd like to speak, they may come up to the podium and form a line.

965
01:31:17,363 --> 01:31:19,024
Please give us your name and address for the record.

966
01:31:19,064 --> 01:31:23,687
Also, if you'd like to speak in public participation, please raise your hand on Zoom and we will recognize you as well.

967
01:31:24,507 --> 01:31:35,194
Okay, I'm one of the people that spoke to Councilor Morrell about the MBTA meeting, but- Can we just have your name?

968
01:31:35,615 --> 01:31:37,416
Oh, Mary Anna Ducey, 2 North Street, Medford.

969
01:31:37,676 --> 01:31:37,976
Thank you.

970
01:31:37,996 --> 01:31:43,340
Okay, before I get into that, I got the call from the city last Thursday.

971
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:49,544
It was a reverse 911 call, and it said that there was gonna be this meeting.

972
01:31:49,564 --> 01:31:53,207
It didn't tell you which bus lines were gonna be affected,

973
01:31:54,075 --> 01:31:56,456
And it said, of course, go to the website.

974
01:31:56,676 --> 01:31:59,058
Of course, I haven't got a computer, I can't go to the website.

975
01:32:00,859 --> 01:32:02,720
But this isn't the first time this has happened.

976
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:09,724
I've called City Hall several times in the last year and a half about different voicemail messages we get.

977
01:32:10,324 --> 01:32:15,187
They don't pay attention to the fact that not everybody has a computer.

978
01:32:15,607 --> 01:32:19,389
So when they draft these 911 calls or whatever they wanna call them,

979
01:32:20,552 --> 01:32:23,453
They only think about Zoom and how to get to Zoom.

980
01:32:24,034 --> 01:32:30,277
They don't consider us people that don't have computers or senior citizens or don't know how to use a computer or whatever.

981
01:32:31,377 --> 01:32:32,357
That's the first issue.

982
01:32:32,718 --> 01:32:37,600
As far as the second issue about the bus lines, I and one of my neighbors who does have a computer,

983
01:32:38,233 --> 01:32:42,014
she went to the map and she found out which ones were affected in our area.

984
01:32:42,475 --> 01:32:50,618
We have done a little bit of a memo to tell people, you know, you can communicate to the city by phone, by email, by letter.

985
01:32:51,338 --> 01:32:56,480
I've gone around and posted all the bus stops so that the people who take those buses know.

986
01:32:57,501 --> 01:33:01,684
We've tried to talk to the senior citizens in our area, I've called the senior center.

987
01:33:02,906 --> 01:33:11,774
She has called the MBTA she's going to try to get somebody to come out to talk to the people at the senior center she says she doesn't know how successful that's going to be.

988
01:33:13,035 --> 01:33:14,856
Today I went over to walk in court.

989
01:33:15,757 --> 01:33:17,938
I spoke to some of the people that happened to be outside.

990
01:33:17,958 --> 01:33:21,359
Um, some of them knew, but some of them didn't know.

991
01:33:21,379 --> 01:33:26,360
Uh, and now those people that walk in court in my area, I live on the hillside.

992
01:33:26,380 --> 01:33:30,781
Um, there are going to be three buses that are going to affect us that are going to be changed.

993
01:33:31,401 --> 01:33:33,662
The 80 bus is going to be eliminated.

994
01:33:33,682 --> 01:33:36,102
Uh, the 94 is going to, um, uh,

995
01:33:39,412 --> 01:33:44,097
Right now it's going to, it's not going to go up High Street anymore, it's going to go to Winchester.

996
01:33:44,117 --> 01:33:50,423
And the third bus is the 96, which is going to change, it comes up George Street now, but it's not going to do that anymore.

997
01:33:50,443 --> 01:33:55,227
It's going to go up College Ave, and then it's going to go as far as Porter Square on the surface.

998
01:33:55,708 --> 01:33:56,929
It's going to end at Porter Square.

999
01:33:58,070 --> 01:34:01,774
All right, so different people have different problems with each one of those.

1000
01:34:04,488 --> 01:34:10,632
But I wanted to communicate, thank you for doing what you're doing, but there is a communication problem with the city.

1001
01:34:10,652 --> 01:34:17,056
You people might have one with the city hall, but us residents have one too, that hasn't been resolved.

1002
01:34:18,317 --> 01:34:22,299
Even the city council, the clerk will remember me, I came in last week.

1003
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:26,902
When you people have your city council meeting, you say public participation, raise your hand.

1004
01:34:26,922 --> 01:34:28,423
Well, that's for Zoom people.

1005
01:34:28,703 --> 01:34:30,465
I can't raise my hand and you don't know me.

1006
01:34:30,825 --> 01:34:34,087
So I suggested to the city clerk that when you start your meetings,

1007
01:34:35,097 --> 01:34:36,978
put up on the screen on the TV.

1008
01:34:37,778 --> 01:34:39,458
This is the meeting ID number.

1009
01:34:39,478 --> 01:34:40,298
This is the phone number.

1010
01:34:40,338 --> 01:34:41,219
This is how you can get in.

1011
01:34:41,339 --> 01:34:45,840
And when it comes time for public participation, I've been participating on some other committees.

1012
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:48,961
You press the star six key and you can speak.

1013
01:34:49,021 --> 01:34:51,001
And I just say hello and wait to be recognized.

1014
01:34:51,301 --> 01:34:53,762
So you could probably do that for the city council also.

1015
01:34:54,542 --> 01:34:57,363
And I don't know what's gonna happen going forward.

1016
01:34:57,423 --> 01:35:04,725
People all got used to using Zoom during the pandemic, which is fine, but you have to also make accommodations for people who cannot use Zoom.

1017
01:35:06,524 --> 01:35:07,325
So that's what I want to say.

1018
01:35:07,345 --> 01:35:15,973
The other thing I wanted to tell you people is that my neighbor that helped us do all this, she has communicated to all of you by email.

1019
01:35:16,593 --> 01:35:21,678
So you've probably already got her email, but she's also communicated to our state representatives.

1020
01:35:22,179 --> 01:35:30,727
She's talked to Sean Gabali, she's talked to Christine, not caught, emailed Christine Barber, Pat Gellin and Paul Donato.

1021
01:35:31,398 --> 01:35:49,532
She said that Senator, no, Representative Gavali said that he's asking his constituents in Arlington to send all their letters to him and he's gonna present them to the T or whoever the body is in mass.

1022
01:35:49,732 --> 01:35:55,056
He was pretty upset because the 80 bus is the Leachmere to Arlington Center now.

1023
01:35:55,951 --> 01:35:57,992
And he said that they were eliminating that bus.

1024
01:35:58,012 --> 01:36:01,573
He says, how are the people from alley to center going to get to the new green line?

1025
01:36:01,933 --> 01:36:04,394
That's the whole purpose he said of doing this.

1026
01:36:05,114 --> 01:36:06,434
And so that cuts them all off.

1027
01:36:07,355 --> 01:36:12,896
So in reality, the T should be leaving everything the way it is.

1028
01:36:12,996 --> 01:36:17,538
With the prices of gas, more people might decide to take the T going forward.

1029
01:36:18,378 --> 01:36:19,838
So the buses should remain.

1030
01:36:19,938 --> 01:36:23,660
I know the problem is they haven't got drivers because they've said that in the newspaper.

1031
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:24,920
They have a shortage of drivers.

1032
01:36:25,341 --> 01:36:36,726
And I don't know if this is driving it in my area isn't the only area that's going to have changes in buses I think a couple of meetings ago that you said that the Fulton Heights area was also going to be affected.

1033
01:36:37,366 --> 01:36:45,510
So, I think, T should just leave things as they get most of the people that I talked to said that just totally the buses the way they are.

1034
01:36:46,846 --> 01:36:49,607
So that's all I wanted to say.

1035
01:36:49,647 --> 01:36:54,328
But I wanted to let you know that we are in the neighborhood trying to communicate with people.

1036
01:36:54,948 --> 01:36:58,689
But 95% of the people that I talked to didn't know anything about it.

1037
01:37:00,230 --> 01:37:03,191
So I don't know who gets these voicemails, but not very many.

1038
01:37:04,371 --> 01:37:07,392
So if the city is going to use that for communication, it isn't working.

1039
01:37:07,811 --> 01:37:08,412
Absolutely.

1040
01:37:08,432 --> 01:37:14,938
I just want to, before I recognize Councilor Cabrera, I want to thank you for doing that outreach to your neighbors, getting them more informed.

1041
01:37:14,978 --> 01:37:18,181
We've been trying to do the same with the resources that we have.

1042
01:37:18,201 --> 01:37:18,802
I understand.

1043
01:37:18,822 --> 01:37:19,622
I understand.

1044
01:37:19,662 --> 01:37:20,583
And we know it's not enough.

1045
01:37:21,044 --> 01:37:21,765
Yeah.

1046
01:37:21,845 --> 01:37:23,386
And the T is notorious for this.

1047
01:37:23,486 --> 01:37:30,533
I've been involved with the different public meetings that the T has had over the last 12 years since they've been working on the Green Line extension.

1048
01:37:31,879 --> 01:37:37,304
The T always has public comment periods or public meetings at inopportune times.

1049
01:37:37,864 --> 01:37:40,266
They hold a Thanksgiving week when people are busy.

1050
01:37:40,527 --> 01:37:44,010
They hold them, this comment period is gonna be in end of July.

1051
01:37:44,270 --> 01:37:45,471
Well, where are people in July?

1052
01:37:45,491 --> 01:37:46,392
They're on vacation.

1053
01:37:46,872 --> 01:37:48,874
Nobody's thinking about public comments.

1054
01:37:49,755 --> 01:37:51,416
So they're notorious for this.

1055
01:37:51,436 --> 01:37:54,739
They just wanna reduce the number of comments they have to deal with, basically.

1056
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:57,882
And this has been going on for 12 years, so it's nothing new.

1057
01:38:00,410 --> 01:38:01,251
That's all I wanted to say.

1058
01:38:01,351 --> 01:38:08,133
I thank you for all your comments and whatever you can do to get this moving along at the T. Thank you, Mr. Ducci.

1059
01:38:09,874 --> 01:38:13,616
She's a constant visitor of my house also.

1060
01:38:13,816 --> 01:38:14,156
She's right.

1061
01:38:15,436 --> 01:38:18,398
Not everybody has access to computers.

1062
01:38:18,438 --> 01:38:24,340
And I think part of the other problem is we're getting phone calls to death now from the city.

1063
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:26,681
Getting too many and people are just ignoring them.

1064
01:38:27,488 --> 01:38:28,869
But the message is incomplete.

1065
01:38:29,069 --> 01:38:30,450
They don't give you enough.

1066
01:38:30,470 --> 01:38:35,812
But we're getting so many now that people just say, just let it go.

1067
01:38:36,893 --> 01:38:40,215
I think we need to cut back on the amount of messages sent out.

1068
01:38:40,835 --> 01:38:42,236
We just keep sending them out.

1069
01:38:42,556 --> 01:38:43,877
We're sending out messages for everything.

1070
01:38:44,997 --> 01:38:45,798
And again, you're right.

1071
01:38:46,158 --> 01:38:48,499
Not everybody has a computer and computer access.

1072
01:38:48,879 --> 01:38:50,300
And we should be having more meetings in there.

1073
01:38:51,158 --> 01:38:52,039
Not just on Zoom.

1074
01:38:52,799 --> 01:38:53,640
Thank you for coming down.

1075
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:55,021
Thank you, Councilor Caravello.

1076
01:38:55,222 --> 01:38:55,842
President Morrell.

1077
01:38:55,982 --> 01:38:56,523
Thank you, Mr. President.

1078
01:38:56,543 --> 01:39:00,426
Just quickly, to Councilor Caravello's point, we actually, we got a notification, or I did.

1079
01:39:01,327 --> 01:39:03,449
I don't know how the map is drawn for these things half the time.

1080
01:39:04,050 --> 01:39:06,672
Got a notification that streets would be closed around City Hall.

1081
01:39:06,712 --> 01:39:07,613
Click for more information.

1082
01:39:07,873 --> 01:39:09,835
You click, there's no more information.

1083
01:39:09,895 --> 01:39:15,400
So if we could get a little more thought process behind what we're putting out, I think that would be good for all residents.

1084
01:39:16,406 --> 01:39:20,190
I think whoever drafts these should say to themselves, Okay, I haven't got a computer.

1085
01:39:20,530 --> 01:39:22,152
Does this message, give me the message.

1086
01:39:22,933 --> 01:39:25,916
Yeah, you know, just forget about that you have a computer say, you know,

1087
01:39:27,892 --> 01:39:28,372
Thank you.

1088
01:39:29,392 --> 01:39:44,955
I just want to note a couple of things that I actually maybe ask something of my fellow counselors, but first is just that we were also discussing the importance of the library earlier tonight for people who don't have access to technology and how that is another essential service that we are trying to get funded.

1089
01:39:45,736 --> 01:39:57,298
I just want to maybe ask my fellow counselors, I know this is not standard protocol, perhaps for next week we could put a motion on to ask the diversity, equity and inclusion director to think about the inclusion

1090
01:39:58,160 --> 01:40:02,624
of people who don't have technology in our city communications, Councilor Seng.

1091
01:40:04,365 --> 01:40:09,209
And I had another one, but I'll leave it at that for now, because I've forgotten.

1092
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:17,355
Any further public participation on any topic of any import before the council?

1093
01:40:18,396 --> 01:40:21,538
Yes, I'm just making sure no one in the room, and then also just announcing one time for Zoom.

1094
01:40:21,578 --> 01:40:23,880
I see Bill Giglio.

1095
01:40:24,821 --> 01:40:25,562
I will unmute you.

1096
01:40:25,762 --> 01:40:27,323
Please just give your name and address for the record.

1097
01:40:29,798 --> 01:40:31,159
Hi, Bill Giglio, Winthrop Street.

1098
01:40:31,299 --> 01:40:46,590
I just want to note that with the, you know, throughout past meetings, we've always recognized, you know, ancient Flag Day, Pride Flag Day, this Flag Day, that Flag Day, but there was no mention of today being Flag Day right here in the United States, which is kind of saddening.

1099
01:40:47,031 --> 01:40:52,275
But I just want to let, you know, remind you, June 14th, every single year is Flag Day here in America.

1100
01:40:52,355 --> 01:40:52,615
Thank you.

1101
01:40:54,036 --> 01:40:54,396
Thank you.

1102
01:40:54,957 --> 01:40:55,537
And that is true.

1103
01:40:55,577 --> 01:40:56,278
We did not mention it.

1104
01:40:56,538 --> 01:40:57,859
Of course, we did salute the flag.

1105
01:40:58,823 --> 01:41:02,466
Thank you.

1106
01:41:02,586 --> 01:41:05,449
Mr. Castagnetti, name and address for the record, please.

1107
01:41:09,633 --> 01:41:12,015
Just wanted to say thank you to Mr. Giglio.

1108
01:41:12,075 --> 01:41:15,538
That was very thoughtful for recognizing our flag in this country.

1109
01:41:15,678 --> 01:41:16,059
Thank you.

1110
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:19,301
Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

1111
01:41:20,462 --> 01:41:23,445
There's one more item, which is the record since they were passed to me.

1112
01:41:26,279 --> 01:41:26,740
You want to give up?

1113
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:27,340
All right.

1114
01:41:27,921 --> 01:41:32,487
Vice President Behrs, how did you find the records?

1115
01:41:33,388 --> 01:41:35,571
I found the records in order and I move approval.

1116
01:41:35,591 --> 01:41:41,358
On the motion of Vice President Behrs to approve the records, seconded by Councilor Carviel.

1117
01:41:41,378 --> 01:41:42,019
All those in favor?

1118
01:41:42,039 --> 01:41:42,519
Aye.

1119
01:41:42,539 --> 01:41:43,200
All those opposed?

1120
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:43,841
Motion passes.

1121
01:41:44,622 --> 01:41:49,288
Motion to adjourn by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Collins.

1122
01:41:49,308 --> 01:41:49,868
All those in favor?

1123
01:41:49,888 --> 01:41:50,329
Aye.

1124
01:41:50,629 --> 01:41:51,090
All those opposed?

1125
01:41:51,130 --> 01:41:51,691
Motion passes.

1126
01:41:51,731 --> 01:41:53,493
Meeting is adjourned.
