1
00:00:01,651 --> 00:00:02,832
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, thanks for coming tonight.

2
00:00:04,152 --> 00:00:09,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Dennis, do you want to kick us off?

3
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:13,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Request for determination of applicability, vegetation management.

4
00:00:13,857 --> 00:00:28,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority has filed a request for determination of applicability to conduct vegetation management activities along the MBTA's right-of-way to the commuter rail within the 100-foot buffer zone of a bordering vegetated wetland and or the 200-foot buffer zone area in Medford Pass.

5
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:35,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, everyone.

6
00:00:35,877 --> 00:00:37,498
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Matt Donovan from Benesch.

7
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,119
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to represent Keolis for this RDA.

8
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:42,522
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for coming tonight.

9
00:00:43,563 --> 00:00:46,625
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you for coming.

10
00:00:47,025 --> 00:00:57,493
[SPEAKER_00]: So this RDA is submitted to your commission every five years, required by CMR 11, and is required to get these determinations before submitting the five-year vegetation management plan to MDAR for approval.

11
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:07,241
[SPEAKER_00]: The vegetation management plan, or the maps that were provided, were mainly made for the chemical portion of the plan, but often dictate where mechanical methods will be used due to chemical restrictions.

12
00:01:08,462 --> 00:01:13,445
[SPEAKER_00]: Each year, there are two main chemical applications, one in the May to June timeframe that targets the roadbed.

13
00:01:14,326 --> 00:01:22,628
[SPEAKER_00]: up to 12 feet from the center line of track and one in the August-September time frame that targets the brush and areas adjacent to the track.

14
00:01:23,568 --> 00:01:34,150
[SPEAKER_00]: The sensitive areas marked with blue and yellow on the maps are restricted from that brush program further away from the track and will only receive the roadbed program directly down on the track 12 feet from the center.

15
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:41,252
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll focus on that roadbed program because that's that's the only chemical application happening in your areas

16
00:01:42,913 --> 00:01:45,575
[SPEAKER_00]: areas of jurisdiction in those sensitive areas.

17
00:01:46,336 --> 00:01:53,442
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you do have questions regarding the BRUSH program in the areas adjacent to the tracks, I would be happy to answer those as well.

18
00:01:54,243 --> 00:02:03,912
[SPEAKER_00]: So the roadway application is performed by a spray truck, drives directly on the track, equipped with nozzles on the backside, located about 18 inches above the ground, spraying the solution directly down onto the track.

19
00:02:05,673 --> 00:02:12,759
[SPEAKER_00]: The certified applicator is always accompanied by an environmental monitor familiar with the site conditions and equipped with these maps instructing the operator as necessary.

20
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:23,428
[SPEAKER_00]: The applicator has the ability to turn off all the nozzles or in many cases just the nozzles that are targeting the shoulders of the tracks where it may be getting closer to the buffer zones of sensitive areas.

21
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:25,830
[SPEAKER_00]: They can turn those off at the flip of a switch.

22
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,232
[SPEAKER_00]: The yellow zones typically

23
00:02:31,555 --> 00:02:33,375
[SPEAKER_00]: will never receive any treatment to the shoulders.

24
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:36,396
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they still may receive treatment directly down onto the ties.

25
00:02:37,376 --> 00:02:43,158
[SPEAKER_00]: This is done at the environmental monitor and applicator's discretion to keep it in conformance with the regulations.

26
00:02:43,578 --> 00:02:48,659
[SPEAKER_00]: And the blue zones will typically receive the full roadbed treatment once per year.

27
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:56,861
[SPEAKER_00]: In these blue and yellow zones, due to the limited spray, more effort is put into controlling the vegetation with manual and mechanical measures.

28
00:02:58,821 --> 00:03:01,282
[SPEAKER_00]: We are seeking a positive two-way determination.

29
00:03:01,962 --> 00:03:11,506
[SPEAKER_00]: for the confirmation of the maps as well as a negative determination for the work that's included in the vegetation management plan.

30
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:13,866
[SPEAKER_00]: That's everything I have.

31
00:03:14,187 --> 00:03:19,228
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to answer any questions or open the floor up to the commission if anyone else has any comments.

32
00:03:21,529 --> 00:03:21,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

33
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:29,512
[SPEAKER_12]: Does the commission have any questions or comments?

34
00:03:35,676 --> 00:03:37,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Dennis, I just have a question for you.

35
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:39,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you reviewed these delineations?

36
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:43,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I mean, I'll be honest.

37
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:43,960
[SPEAKER_06]: They haven't changed.

38
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,861
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been no.

39
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:53,505
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is, I think the 3rd or 4th time as me as agent going over these and prior to that, another.

40
00:03:55,497 --> 00:03:59,839
[SPEAKER_06]: 2 or 3 times as a member, so it's basically the same markings.

41
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:07,463
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want, I can sort of, I don't know if you guys want me to bring up a couple of the maps just to sort of show the areas, maybe.

42
00:04:08,304 --> 00:04:08,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you got it.

43
00:04:09,965 --> 00:04:12,286
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have had it ready, so I figured I would.

44
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:18,049
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority of the resource area that the right-of-way runs through is the riverfront.

45
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:21,851
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those areas, once you get basically 100 feet away from it,

46
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,540
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll turn into a blue zone.

47
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,083
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 10 feet, but we're always on the conservative side.

48
00:04:28,123 --> 00:04:32,926
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe like 10 to 20 feet from it, it would be a yellow zone where there is no spray.

49
00:04:35,787 --> 00:04:41,151
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, let me know if you have any questions, but I'm kind of just slowly strolling through.

50
00:04:41,211 --> 00:04:43,152
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, it's mostly riverfront.

51
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:46,894
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the Malden line.

52
00:04:46,914 --> 00:04:47,515
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the,

53
00:04:49,427 --> 00:04:55,411
[SPEAKER_00]: The extent of the line that I just scrolled through, I'm happy to go slower or stop anywhere if there's any questions.

54
00:05:00,815 --> 00:05:06,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Dennis, or perhaps Heidi, do you recall, did we confirm the delineations in the prior RDAs?

55
00:05:06,638 --> 00:05:13,263
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't recall that.

56
00:05:13,283 --> 00:05:17,906
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you have every five years since the right of way

57
00:05:19,207 --> 00:05:23,010
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations were created and I believe 1987 or so.

58
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:34,997
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I, I believe, uh, at one point in time, someone from your commission actually came out to approve the markings in the field as well.

59
00:05:35,017 --> 00:05:39,820
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but like, like Dennis said, this is reoccurring.

60
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:47,565
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, so they don't typically, the commissions don't come out every, every year, especially, um,

61
00:05:49,626 --> 00:05:51,367
[SPEAKER_00]: through Medford where it's pretty straightforward.

62
00:05:51,387 --> 00:05:55,770
[SPEAKER_12]: The front area boundaries don't change really.

63
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:56,930
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

64
00:05:59,131 --> 00:06:01,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Wetlands can change of course.

65
00:06:02,693 --> 00:06:03,814
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah exactly.

66
00:06:09,277 --> 00:06:12,939
[SPEAKER_00]: So again we will be seeking that positive 2a as well as the negative.

67
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:20,748
[SPEAKER_00]: positive two way for the confirmation of the maps and the negative for the work included in the vegetation management plan.

68
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:23,969
[SPEAKER_12]: We can take those one at a time.

69
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:29,971
[SPEAKER_12]: Is the commission comfortable with a positive two way for the delineation?

70
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:38,454
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess my question might be more procedural.

71
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:39,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that needed?

72
00:06:44,062 --> 00:06:45,423
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know the answer to that.

73
00:06:46,143 --> 00:06:47,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we need to confirm?

74
00:06:47,744 --> 00:06:51,626
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't recall doing a quick check like that.

75
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:56,529
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking back at the previous one we did and we didn't do a confirmation.

76
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:06,475
[SPEAKER_06]: We just did, sorry, just, previous one we just did a negative two.

77
00:07:09,377 --> 00:07:11,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Were there any conditions associated with that?

78
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:12,985
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

79
00:07:13,885 --> 00:07:14,105
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

80
00:07:16,086 --> 00:07:25,447
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're required to fill out the RDA form with the box B checked, which I'd have to have it pulled up here.

81
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:31,348
[SPEAKER_00]: But whether the boundaries of the resource areas depicted on the plans are referenced above or accurately delineated.

82
00:07:31,428 --> 00:07:37,329
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only real response to that with a DOA form would be the positive 2A or positive 2B.

83
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,980
[SPEAKER_00]: to go along with that negative.

84
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,885
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you want, I can, I'll just sort of read out the language here just so the folks sort of have it.

85
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:58,912
[SPEAKER_06]: So determination 2A, the boundary delineations of the following resource areas described on the reference plans are confirmed as accurate.

86
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:10,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Therefore, the resource area boundaries confirmed in this determination are binding as to all decisions rendered pursuant to the Wetlands Protection Act and its regulations regarding such boundaries for as long as this determination is valid.

87
00:08:12,554 --> 00:08:25,742
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to add to that, there has been several commissions because of that kind of binding language that have, as you can see, the DOA form has like lines below it, Dennis, if you're looking at it.

88
00:08:26,482 --> 00:08:36,968
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of commissions have added language such as this determination is only valid for the sole purpose of the vegetation management plan as approved by MDAR.

89
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:39,410
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be binding for any other projects by,

90
00:08:40,502 --> 00:08:42,602
[SPEAKER_00]: other applicants or the applicant.

91
00:08:43,043 --> 00:08:48,764
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do propose something other than vegetation management plan, we would be coming back to your commission.

92
00:08:48,784 --> 00:08:55,125
[SPEAKER_00]: The boundaries wouldn't be binding for any other use.

93
00:08:55,465 --> 00:09:04,607
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an option that other commissions, just because the uniqueness of this RDA, there isn't really a perfect determination.

94
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:08,048
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a way that commissions have used to issue that.

95
00:09:08,964 --> 00:09:10,486
[SPEAKER_12]: Makes sense, yeah.

96
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:19,637
[SPEAKER_12]: But if we issue both a positive 2A for the delineation and a negative for the work, are we literally issuing two different determinations of applicability?

97
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:25,964
[SPEAKER_00]: No, every town has just done it on one DOA form, yeah.

98
00:09:32,025 --> 00:09:34,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, because actually I was looking at the very top.

99
00:09:34,526 --> 00:09:37,146
[SPEAKER_06]: It says the following determination, and then S in parentheses.

100
00:09:37,186 --> 00:09:39,347
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can actually have multiple determinations on one.

101
00:09:39,507 --> 00:09:43,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, never had one before, but it seems.

102
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:49,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Donovan.

103
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:49,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.

104
00:09:49,909 --> 00:10:00,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think I'm inclined to, with that additional language that the delineation is specific to this vegetation management, that seems fine to me.

105
00:10:02,022 --> 00:10:06,286
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Dennis, I'd be happy to send you that language as well from what other towns have used.

106
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:12,552
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had to send it before, but it's just a sentence or two to add to that determination.

107
00:10:12,572 --> 00:10:13,793
[SPEAKER_06]: You're reading my mind.

108
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,514
[SPEAKER_06]: That was literally going to be my next question.

109
00:10:15,594 --> 00:10:15,895
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.

110
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:19,958
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's pretty much word for word how I just said it, but I wasn't reading it.

111
00:10:19,978 --> 00:10:20,258
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

112
00:10:20,438 --> 00:10:25,763
[SPEAKER_12]: Do I have a motion then?

113
00:10:31,604 --> 00:10:45,175
[SPEAKER_06]: So moved I make a motion to issue, um, can you, Dennis, can you remind me which it's a positive to a, with the, uh, language specifying that it is only for, um, vegetation management.

114
00:10:46,516 --> 00:10:46,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

115
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:54,536
[SPEAKER_06]: and a negative two that the work described in the request is within an area subject to protection, but will not remove, fill, dredge, or alter that area.

116
00:10:55,357 --> 00:10:56,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so moved.

117
00:10:56,357 --> 00:10:56,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

118
00:10:57,778 --> 00:10:58,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded.

119
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded.

120
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Question, is this supposed to be negative two or negative five?

121
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:04,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

122
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,707
[SPEAKER_07]: I think in their application, they mentioned negative five.

123
00:11:08,747 --> 00:11:09,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you do?

124
00:11:09,148 --> 00:11:09,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

125
00:11:10,282 --> 00:11:20,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, I think your commission typically issues, it's negative 2, 3, or 5 all work the same for this work.

126
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:27,167
[SPEAKER_00]: So honestly, just as many towns issue negative 2 and 3 rather than the 5, and it doesn't.

127
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:29,828
[SPEAKER_06]: For 2020, we did a negative 2.

128
00:11:31,008 --> 00:11:31,208
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

129
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:33,149
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got that form here.

130
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:35,570
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be happy with either.

131
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,548
[SPEAKER_11]: All in favor, Heather?

132
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:41,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

133
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:43,128
[SPEAKER_11]: Caroline?

134
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:44,149
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

135
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:45,529
[SPEAKER_11]: Fred?

136
00:11:46,669 --> 00:11:46,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

137
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:47,730
[SPEAKER_11]: Eric?

138
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:48,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

139
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,430
[SPEAKER_11]: And myself as an aye.

140
00:11:53,031 --> 00:11:54,092
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, everyone.

141
00:11:54,712 --> 00:11:55,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a good night.

142
00:11:56,552 --> 00:11:56,992
[SPEAKER_12]: You too.

143
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:25,563
[SPEAKER_06]: The next item on the agenda is to... There we go.

144
00:12:32,987 --> 00:12:39,932
[SPEAKER_06]: A discussion of the plantings on South Street, and I believe, Greg, you're on the call?

145
00:12:41,112 --> 00:12:41,292
[SPEAKER_06]: No?

146
00:12:41,813 --> 00:12:42,013
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

147
00:12:43,154 --> 00:12:44,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I assume that the other thing was him.

148
00:12:45,615 --> 00:12:46,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry about that.

149
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:48,257
[SPEAKER_06]: I did contact him last week,

150
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:52,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Sent him the invite, and he said he was going to be here.

151
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,349
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

152
00:13:03,176 --> 00:13:04,437
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you send him an email?

153
00:13:04,477 --> 00:13:05,638
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm doing right now, yeah.

154
00:13:29,217 --> 00:13:32,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, actually, while we're doing this, I can give you some updates and some other things.

155
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:34,099
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are going to have a filing in two weeks.

156
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:39,962
[SPEAKER_06]: We have gotten a notice of intent has been submitted.

157
00:13:39,982 --> 00:13:41,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, two have been submitted.

158
00:13:41,222 --> 00:13:42,763
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one's still in the pipeline.

159
00:13:46,485 --> 00:13:54,128
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, that's tending to move on, but I think it's got misplaced or something.

160
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,669
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it should be already by then.

161
00:13:57,283 --> 00:14:20,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Or on Arlington Street, two notices for basically expanding the houses within the riverfront area and a little bit of some of the work is within 100-year floodplain and buffer zone to drop the backing.

162
00:14:21,968 --> 00:14:22,909
[SPEAKER_11]: and riverfront area.

163
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:24,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I say riverfront area?

164
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,631
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I said that at the start.

165
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,772
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just double-checking.

166
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:28,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

167
00:14:28,773 --> 00:14:29,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, no.

168
00:14:29,954 --> 00:14:33,837
[SPEAKER_06]: The entire house, pretty much, with the exception of a small little corner, is all riverfront area.

169
00:14:33,857 --> 00:14:34,377
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, yeah, yeah.

170
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:37,560
[SPEAKER_12]: And so this is the notice of intent.

171
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:42,123
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the couple that came before us with the determination.

172
00:14:42,443 --> 00:14:50,870
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also the property next door, the owner is doing basically the exact same thing, except it's basically the same project.

173
00:14:52,137 --> 00:14:54,138
[SPEAKER_06]: but two properties for the most part.

174
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:55,679
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's differences, of course, but.

175
00:14:56,219 --> 00:14:57,880
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's two different file numbers.

176
00:14:58,161 --> 00:14:58,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

177
00:14:58,581 --> 00:14:58,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

178
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,643
[SPEAKER_06]: And the one next door has the file number.

179
00:15:01,663 --> 00:15:02,283
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that?

180
00:15:02,964 --> 00:15:03,804
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the address, do you know?

181
00:15:03,824 --> 00:15:03,924
[SPEAKER_06]: 171 and 173.

182
00:15:04,324 --> 00:15:05,005
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll be the 17th.

183
00:15:05,045 --> 00:15:05,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

184
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:05,165
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

185
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:23,434
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was on a call today with DCR.

186
00:15:23,835 --> 00:15:30,880
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be doing some roadwork improvements at the High Street Rotary going across into Arlington.

187
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:37,524
[SPEAKER_06]: That is, they've got some paint down, but it's not going to be there for a while because they were

188
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:48,647
[SPEAKER_06]: basically asked to put a pathway along, uh, let's see.

189
00:15:48,727 --> 00:15:49,868
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

190
00:15:49,888 --> 00:15:54,552
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically in that neighborhood, but further down, uh,

191
00:15:56,003 --> 00:16:04,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Mississippi Valley Parkway across from the street, Lakeview Avenue, that the residents have asked for a raised crosswalk and better pathway.

192
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:12,307
[SPEAKER_06]: And that work is not within our resource area, but we went over sort of both of them today.

193
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:18,209
[SPEAKER_12]: It's... And that was in response to the pedestrian fatality last winter.

194
00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:18,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

195
00:16:19,969 --> 00:16:22,230
[SPEAKER_06]: So that'll be... So if you see something there, it is...

196
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:25,624
[SPEAKER_06]: It's far enough away.

197
00:16:25,664 --> 00:16:27,485
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like 300 feet from the river at that spot.

198
00:16:28,326 --> 00:16:32,028
[SPEAKER_02]: There's equipment over at that bridge off and on this past week.

199
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:34,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're doing work both in Medford and Arlington.

200
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,892
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think they were originally going to start there.

201
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:53,844
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the Lakeview Ave work was basically pushed to the top due to public interest and public, basically, for lack of a better word, pushing DCR to put that in there.

202
00:16:54,900 --> 00:17:07,403
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, because it is, I actually, two of my best friends grew up on one street over from that and crossing that one down there is a treacherous event.

203
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:11,404
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think a race thing there would be very helpful.

204
00:17:12,344 --> 00:17:21,807
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, earlier today I went down to walk, we have a conservation restriction on the property along the,

205
00:17:22,887 --> 00:17:31,231
[SPEAKER_06]: at Clippership Park by the Afghan schools, and they have to do a basic inspection of it every few years.

206
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:41,837
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did a walk today of all the work that's been done around there, and while I was there, they're looking to put in a COVID memorial garden along the river.

207
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, along the pathway there behind the schools.

208
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:48,934
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and that will be within our jurisdiction.

209
00:17:48,954 --> 00:17:56,420
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm sort of going over with one of my staff coworkers who's going to be handling that sort of they're still formulating designs.

210
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,043
[SPEAKER_06]: So depending on the design, you know, then it will come before us.

211
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,704
[SPEAKER_06]: That might not be for a while, but.

212
00:18:02,945 --> 00:18:08,749
[SPEAKER_06]: I was asking who would be the proponent?

213
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,090
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be the city.

214
00:18:14,017 --> 00:18:25,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Dennis, recently I was at a social event and our friend who likes to clear along there and trim was quite vocal about the fact that he's still active.

215
00:18:28,225 --> 00:18:36,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Today when we walked out I found a small pile that looked old, so I couldn't tell if it was there recent or not, so we're still keeping an eye out.

216
00:18:38,343 --> 00:18:40,604
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we ask people... Just to let you know.

217
00:18:40,645 --> 00:18:41,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, I appreciate it.

218
00:18:41,725 --> 00:18:44,307
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not ashamed of it, and he's... No, I know.

219
00:18:44,427 --> 00:18:51,051
[SPEAKER_06]: It's... Until we actually physically catch him again, there's unfortunately not much we can do.

220
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:52,292
[SPEAKER_06]: We've set up cameras.

221
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:53,753
[SPEAKER_06]: He's well aware.

222
00:18:54,273 --> 00:18:54,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, oh yeah.

223
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,315
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that.

224
00:18:57,351 --> 00:18:59,772
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have one other quick question.

225
00:19:00,212 --> 00:19:09,314
[SPEAKER_02]: You know a house that has been burned out on the river for well over three or four years now, it's up by, oh dear.

226
00:19:09,934 --> 00:19:11,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Boston Ave and Arlington.

227
00:19:11,595 --> 00:19:14,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Boston Ave, it's that second house in.

228
00:19:14,635 --> 00:19:18,796
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still in tremendous disrepair and it's right on the river.

229
00:19:18,896 --> 00:19:21,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any kind of,

230
00:19:22,349 --> 00:19:27,973
[SPEAKER_02]: authority or anything that we can do to push for that.

231
00:19:27,993 --> 00:19:34,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, number one, it's a major danger to the community, but nothing seems to be happening.

232
00:19:34,158 --> 00:19:36,420
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just didn't know if we had a role we could play.

233
00:19:38,216 --> 00:19:45,343
[SPEAKER_06]: I can check with the building commissioner, because I know it's, I mean, like, obviously, clearly, if it was going to, I mean, it probably, if it's that much of a hazard, it would be taken down.

234
00:19:45,363 --> 00:19:45,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

235
00:19:46,444 --> 00:19:58,296
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it is an attractive nuisance, let alone if there is either another fire there, or if there's some kind of collapse into the river, that's the concern.

236
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the one right at the end of Canal Street, basically?

237
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:03,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's right there.

238
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:03,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

239
00:20:03,861 --> 00:20:09,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Right when Canal Street takes that elbow, it's that little spur that continues on, yeah, I guess.

240
00:20:10,265 --> 00:20:10,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

241
00:20:10,765 --> 00:20:13,968
[SPEAKER_06]: I will check with the building department.

242
00:20:14,908 --> 00:20:15,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

243
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:20,412
[SPEAKER_06]: And see, and I'll look up, because I mean, obviously, clearly, if they file a demo permit, that would come before me.

244
00:20:20,432 --> 00:20:23,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I wish they would.

245
00:20:23,234 --> 00:20:24,495
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to see it gone, but.

246
00:20:24,855 --> 00:20:25,116
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

247
00:20:26,296 --> 00:20:27,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I did get one, it was a while ago.

248
00:20:27,778 --> 00:20:29,380
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually on South Street.

249
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:37,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone actually filed a demo permit for one of the houses there, and I basically emailed back to them, this has to come before the Conservation Commission, and that's the last I heard from them, so I don't know.

250
00:20:37,532 --> 00:20:40,876
[SPEAKER_06]: They might have looked at how much that would entail and decided that.

251
00:20:41,537 --> 00:20:41,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

252
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:43,698
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't, I didn't mean to take up a lot of time.

253
00:20:43,758 --> 00:20:54,923
[SPEAKER_12]: I just mentioned, I have a, I have a dream that the city could acquire that parcel and water view, if not waterfront access.

254
00:20:55,784 --> 00:20:59,505
[SPEAKER_12]: I know public access would be difficult, but you could at least have a view spot.

255
00:20:59,645 --> 00:21:00,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

256
00:21:01,846 --> 00:21:03,027
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an excellent idea.

257
00:21:03,087 --> 00:21:05,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Heidi Jeremy's not here serving on the CPC.

258
00:21:05,588 --> 00:21:06,289
[SPEAKER_12]: We could say.

259
00:21:10,151 --> 00:21:11,752
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

260
00:21:12,693 --> 00:21:15,755
[SPEAKER_12]: But of course, who knows what the owner intends to do with that?

261
00:21:16,415 --> 00:21:22,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Given that I'm pretty sure that area is zoned for apartments, weirdly.

262
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,941
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, here we go.

263
00:21:51,171 --> 00:21:51,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Greg, welcome.

264
00:21:51,872 --> 00:21:59,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Next one, I don't know if you're in yet, but just give us a shout when you're ready.

265
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:18,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Dennis, you do have Jeremy's notes on this matter available, correct?

266
00:22:18,613 --> 00:22:19,694
[SPEAKER_10]: I do, yeah.

267
00:22:22,032 --> 00:22:23,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, can you hear me at all?

268
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:23,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

269
00:22:25,454 --> 00:22:25,794
[SPEAKER_03]: You can?

270
00:22:26,495 --> 00:22:26,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

271
00:22:26,675 --> 00:22:27,836
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

272
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:28,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry about that.

273
00:22:28,636 --> 00:22:30,917
[SPEAKER_03]: A little connection issue.

274
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:35,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to the meeting late here.

275
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost track of time.

276
00:22:36,901 --> 00:22:37,922
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize for that.

277
00:22:40,403 --> 00:22:41,664
[SPEAKER_12]: We're glad you could make it.

278
00:22:44,926 --> 00:22:47,668
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just looking for 54 South Street.

279
00:22:47,748 --> 00:22:49,769
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got all the plantings in and done.

280
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:51,170
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if anybody's been by.

281
00:22:52,473 --> 00:22:57,317
[SPEAKER_03]: take a look to make sure that you're satisfied with what you were looking for?

282
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:07,324
[SPEAKER_06]: I've gone by, but we actually, unfortunately, one of the members, he's a landscape person.

283
00:23:07,444 --> 00:23:17,191
[SPEAKER_06]: He had some, he basically sent it to me at the end of last week with some questions and concerns about some of the trees and everything.

284
00:23:17,251 --> 00:23:20,793
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll just see if I can call up the landscape plan and sort of talk about what he

285
00:23:24,516 --> 00:23:27,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I had an issue with the PDFs.

286
00:23:49,436 --> 00:23:52,857
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought we were going to approve this plan.

287
00:23:52,918 --> 00:23:54,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe we have approved it, have we?

288
00:23:55,178 --> 00:23:56,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to my memory.

289
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:26,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I guess my question is similar to yours, Heidi, is what was planted and what plan was it planted in accordance to the one?

290
00:24:27,454 --> 00:24:29,795
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the order of conditions are a new one.

291
00:24:30,155 --> 00:24:33,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know that answer Mr. Maynard?

292
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:43,039
[SPEAKER_03]: The last meeting we had, we went over the plan and we talked about the plants that were on the plan that we had.

293
00:24:43,099 --> 00:24:45,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe you've got that, Dennis, right?

294
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's the one from last, a year ago basically, September 24.

295
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:50,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

296
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:51,981
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what do we do?

297
00:24:52,061 --> 00:24:56,745
[SPEAKER_03]: We, we had that meeting about what, about four months ago or three months ago.

298
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:05,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and about like, there being an issue about some calipers on, on certain plants.

299
00:25:06,052 --> 00:25:12,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and we talked about doing like maybe an extra tree or something that I did in the back of the house.

300
00:25:12,437 --> 00:25:18,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I put, um, a third, um, oak tree, uh,

301
00:25:23,904 --> 00:25:29,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have the exact names for them, but I did the smaller bushes.

302
00:25:30,469 --> 00:25:42,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there were five of one specific brand and then seven of another that we did out front, along with the four trees out front.

303
00:25:43,699 --> 00:25:46,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to pull it up and see what time.

304
00:25:49,513 --> 00:25:52,135
[SPEAKER_03]: with the actual names on them.

305
00:25:54,617 --> 00:26:02,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

306
00:26:02,184 --> 00:26:10,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember how many, what was the final number of trees planted?

307
00:26:10,351 --> 00:26:12,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I should have had this.

308
00:26:12,633 --> 00:26:14,214
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to pull mine up too.

309
00:26:18,217 --> 00:26:21,679
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was five within the riverfront area.

310
00:26:21,699 --> 00:26:26,542
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's on the site plan approved.

311
00:26:52,783 --> 00:26:53,704
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, guys.

312
00:26:57,846 --> 00:26:58,587
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the old one.

313
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:01,509
[SPEAKER_03]: I got so many plans here.

314
00:27:01,629 --> 00:27:04,931
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the most recent plan I have dated September 24, 2024.

315
00:27:06,412 --> 00:27:07,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this what we're going off of?

316
00:27:10,815 --> 00:27:16,758
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the same plan I have for what it's worth in the planting list, top left.

317
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:20,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm looking for that right now.

318
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:20,561
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

319
00:27:23,817 --> 00:27:33,842
[SPEAKER_03]: That that should be it let me pull up the email I sent to because I'm at the last meeting I sent Dennis that email with that particular planting.

320
00:28:01,907 --> 00:28:02,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Unreal.

321
00:28:12,615 --> 00:28:16,698
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you, Dennis, what do you have on for the plantings on what's in front of you there?

322
00:28:16,978 --> 00:28:23,243
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to, unfortunately I'm having a little trouble calling up some things on my computer today.

323
00:28:23,923 --> 00:28:24,624
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

324
00:28:24,644 --> 00:28:28,527
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think this is the one that was sort of submitted.

325
00:28:28,547 --> 00:28:30,028
[SPEAKER_06]: I think one thing which...

326
00:28:31,356 --> 00:28:33,838
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going over Jeremy's notes.

327
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,962
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so I got it here.

328
00:28:41,124 --> 00:28:51,253
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were doing five swamp mellows and seven carnivores, one to two feet in height.

329
00:28:51,353 --> 00:28:53,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I got all those in there.

330
00:28:53,975 --> 00:28:56,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Two flowering dogwoods.

331
00:29:00,414 --> 00:29:02,735
[SPEAKER_03]: And one Easton Redbud.

332
00:29:05,016 --> 00:29:09,899
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it calls for three red maples.

333
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:19,984
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm sorry, two maples, but I got three maples out there now.

334
00:29:34,694 --> 00:29:51,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Dennis, if I may make a recommendation, I think it makes sense to memorialize Commissioner Martin's notes on this planting plan, perhaps in a memo to Mr. Maynard.

335
00:29:53,460 --> 00:30:00,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Jeremy raises some valid points about the quantities of shrub in the riverfront area.

336
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:08,531
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate his comments on the species as well, particularly with respect to the proposed trees.

337
00:30:12,172 --> 00:30:16,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps with that information, Mr. Mater could revise this planting plan.

338
00:30:16,253 --> 00:30:29,875
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be my preference, but I would defer to fellow commissioners if they had thoughts on what is proposed on this plan or as an alternative, what Commissioner Martin is suggesting.

339
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:35,924
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I thought Mr. Maynard said that the plans had been planted.

340
00:30:36,884 --> 00:30:38,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's my understanding, Heidi, as well.

341
00:30:38,825 --> 00:30:39,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's been planted.

342
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:43,266
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we had the previous meeting.

343
00:30:43,646 --> 00:30:44,967
[SPEAKER_03]: This was approved.

344
00:30:46,007 --> 00:30:47,948
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went ahead and did it.

345
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:56,930
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess the question is, did we approve the plan?

346
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,471
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we did approve the plan, then

347
00:31:00,836 --> 00:31:03,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure exactly where we stand right now.

348
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:07,485
[SPEAKER_02]: So Dennis, can you clarify whether we approved the plan or not?

349
00:31:07,545 --> 00:31:10,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if we did, isn't it sort of a fait accompli?

350
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,030
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it is.

351
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:16,977
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the one thing, Greg, are you available tomorrow?

352
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yep.

353
00:31:19,771 --> 00:31:32,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't I meet you down there and just sort of go over some things, because I just sort of take up, because I did, honestly, I wish I had more time to like go over there, but I had another meeting today that I was, I was hopeful to get over there today, but I was down on the other emergency front and never made it fully over there.

354
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:47,454
[SPEAKER_06]: But why don't I do that, walk over with you, and then sort of look at what you have, and then, because I think part of one of the things that our other commissioner sort of asked for was he, his opinion was that the shrubs were too densely far apart, and that there might be room to maybe put in a few other shrubs.

355
00:31:48,802 --> 00:31:58,073
[SPEAKER_06]: In the spaces that might fit in better, but I think that was one of his predominant ones and the other one was with the trees, but I mean, we have right now they were.

356
00:31:58,955 --> 00:32:02,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there were part of the biggest problem is that that existing tree in the front that was removed.

357
00:32:03,219 --> 00:32:06,603
[SPEAKER_06]: If that had been kept, we wouldn't really probably having this issue.

358
00:32:07,063 --> 00:32:09,846
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just because that tree was such a I get it.

359
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,208
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I'm guessing wasn't it wasn't you.

360
00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:14,811
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's no, no, I know Dennis.

361
00:32:14,831 --> 00:32:16,893
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just a little confused from the last meeting.

362
00:32:16,993 --> 00:32:21,358
[SPEAKER_03]: I was under the that what I gave you here for this plan.

363
00:32:22,295 --> 00:32:51,742
[SPEAKER_03]: was approved to go ahead and do it that's why we did it and i think we we specifically said that um some of the because i said some of the calipers might not like be um exactly what you're looking for and um like say on the maples and um we agreed that you know instead of doing two maybe i put uh put three in and that's what i did okay um so are you right that does ramp up yeah yeah we didn't i mean i'm just kind of like i'm

364
00:32:52,542 --> 00:32:53,163
[SPEAKER_03]: This is done.

365
00:32:53,343 --> 00:32:53,843
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

366
00:32:53,883 --> 00:32:54,483
[SPEAKER_03]: I put it in.

367
00:32:54,523 --> 00:33:02,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't I don't mind going back and throwing a few more shrubs in but There's really not a ton of room in here for more trees.

368
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:11,114
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I Mean, especially when these trees, I mean these maples are gonna get you know, I'm not a arborist, but I mean, they're gonna be 60 feet tall.

369
00:33:11,154 --> 00:33:16,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean you can along with the With the red, you know, these are dogwoods.

370
00:33:16,477 --> 00:33:17,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean they get pretty big.

371
00:33:17,918 --> 00:33:18,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I

372
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:25,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Dennis, at the risk of asking a loaded question, do we have minutes from that meeting?

373
00:33:25,147 --> 00:33:27,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me check.

374
00:33:27,268 --> 00:33:29,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

375
00:33:29,548 --> 00:33:36,110
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely have it recorded, so I can go look at that just to double check, but... And that's not something I'm asking us to do live.

376
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:43,971
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, you know, if the two of you are meeting later this week, it might be worth going in either with a transcription or minutes and please share those with us if we have them.

377
00:33:44,411 --> 00:33:44,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

378
00:33:45,872 --> 00:33:46,292
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess...

379
00:33:48,715 --> 00:33:59,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Maynard, could you at least, in an email to Dennis, confirm what was planted, the size of the trees, and maybe some photos for us as well would be helpful?

380
00:33:59,819 --> 00:34:02,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can take the photos when I've done it with Greg.

381
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:07,722
[SPEAKER_06]: I can sort of do like a point by point of all the different trees and everything and get those and send them to you.

382
00:34:08,062 --> 00:34:08,582
[SPEAKER_06]: I can do that.

383
00:34:10,683 --> 00:34:13,324
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that might sort of help too for us to sort of be able to see it as well.

384
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:16,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, that's fine.

385
00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:30,203
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to repeat, we would like to know the details of the minutes, ideally see the minutes, but at least review the minutes in some fashion.

386
00:34:30,223 --> 00:34:36,931
[SPEAKER_02]: And number two, gather the additional information just requested by Caroline.

387
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:37,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

388
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:46,762
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's pretty much, I mean, we seem to be at a point where we need more information.

389
00:34:48,063 --> 00:34:49,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

390
00:34:51,404 --> 00:34:55,966
[SPEAKER_12]: We could report back to us on our next meeting on the 17th.

391
00:34:56,946 --> 00:35:00,467
[SPEAKER_06]: So Greg, give me a call tomorrow when you're free and you want to meet down there.

392
00:35:00,487 --> 00:35:01,028
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here all day.

393
00:35:01,048 --> 00:35:04,069
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no meeting scheduled, so I can come down whenever it's good for you.

394
00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:06,169
[SPEAKER_06]: So just anytime after 9 o'clock, give me a shout.

395
00:35:07,938 --> 00:35:08,959
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, sounds good.

396
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:09,999
[SPEAKER_12]: Appreciate it.

397
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:11,200
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for coming, Mr. Banner.

398
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,321
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Dennis.

399
00:35:20,145 --> 00:35:21,126
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

400
00:35:23,047 --> 00:35:25,108
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the date of that hearing, Dennis?

401
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:29,130
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm trying to go back and find out.

402
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,392
[SPEAKER_11]: It was, like, 4th of March.

403
00:35:39,622 --> 00:35:40,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I think early June.

404
00:35:40,963 --> 00:35:42,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, because I think I was away.

405
00:35:42,964 --> 00:35:46,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, that would have been, yeah.

406
00:35:47,326 --> 00:35:47,806
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was.

407
00:35:48,466 --> 00:35:48,927
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

408
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,371
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the first two weeks in June.

409
00:35:57,791 --> 00:35:58,011
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

410
00:35:59,011 --> 00:36:02,853
[SPEAKER_06]: I will look through my notes and stuff and get you something.

411
00:36:04,594 --> 00:36:08,416
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this emphasizes the need to get minutes up to date as soon as we can.

412
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:11,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Craig.

413
00:36:12,448 --> 00:36:17,332
[SPEAKER_06]: We have interns, and I've been told that they can do those.

414
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:23,477
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think I'm just going to start sloughing them off to them to do some of the other.

415
00:36:23,577 --> 00:36:25,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, I didn't realize this.

416
00:36:25,258 --> 00:36:34,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, some of my other fellow co-workers have been having me do that for ages, and I was not aware that that was an option that I can take and use.

417
00:36:34,445 --> 00:36:38,168
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll be doing that.

418
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:39,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you stop sharing for the moment?

419
00:36:41,012 --> 00:36:42,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sorry.

420
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:44,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

421
00:36:46,316 --> 00:36:48,077
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we have any other business items?

422
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:52,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Not even that I'm aware of.

423
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,042
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I gave you kind of the updates on potential projects.

424
00:36:55,202 --> 00:36:57,303
[SPEAKER_12]: We are meeting again on the 17th.

425
00:36:57,363 --> 00:37:00,765
[SPEAKER_12]: If we could close the public hearing portion of this.

426
00:37:01,706 --> 00:37:04,188
[SPEAKER_12]: I make a motion to close the public hearing portion of the meeting.

427
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:04,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Seconded.

428
00:37:06,025 --> 00:37:07,046
[SPEAKER_12]: All in favor, Heather.

429
00:37:07,066 --> 00:37:08,087
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.
