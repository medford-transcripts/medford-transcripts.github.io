    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=988.883s">[Kit Collins]</a>:  Present.
 Three present, two absent.
 The meeting is called to order.
 Thank you all for being here.
 People were clamoring for one final planning and permitting committee meeting before we closed out this term, so I had to oblige.
 The action and discussion item, thank you for laughing, Simon.
 The action discussion item for tonight's meeting is paper 22-321, a condominium conversion ordinance.
 This is something that we have not talked about in a little while.
 It's been on the council's radar for a couple of terms now.
 This was brought up in the context, initially this was brought up as an idea before the council in the context of one of the mass displacement events in Medford in recent years when a couple dozen tenants were evicted, no fault, from the Bradley Road rental building.
 In 2022, this is brought up as one possible strategy that Medford could look into as a strategy that many municipalities have pursued as a way of protecting the stock of rental units within a city.
 There are many strategies that have to work together to preserve affordable housing and to preserve rental housing stock within a municipality.
 This is one that actually many of our neighbors here in Massachusetts
 have used and have adapted and have adapted to fit their unique needs.
 And so in 2022, we had a couple of initial meetings on this idea.
 We gathered and looked at together some initial research, compared what some of our neighbors do and don't do through their condo conversion ordinances.
 and put together a framework from which we would make a draft ordinance in those couple preliminary meetings which were in March and September of 2023.
 Like I said, we looked at kind of a survey of some other municipalities, condo conversion ordinances, compared and contrasted them, and also got some initial reactions and questions on the board from our planning development sustainability department and our building commissioner.
 So what we have today, and this is in the agenda packet, is a preliminary kind of version one draft of a condo conversion ordinance, which I wrote.
 The text did not just come out of my head.
 This came from several, this was adapted from
 several of the different condo conversion ordinances that are currently on the books in many of our, in some of our neighboring communities, who we looked at, who we looked to as examples at the September 2023 meeting and discussed and it kind of comes out of our conversation from about a year and a half ago about what of these neighboring communities ordinances make sense and seems like it's interesting and seems like it's something that'd be worth looking into here in Medford and which of these things seem like they're less tailored for a community like ours.
 So I'm happy to run through that draft tonight, but just quickly since it has been a while since we've looked at this, I just want to quickly recenter us on kind of the principles of this ordinance and the why of doing it at all.
 Why do a condo conversion ordinance?
 This is, like I said, it's just one strategy, but it's a way of making sure that the city has more control and has a seat at the table when the conversion of rental units to condominiums happens in a city.
 And we know that in Medford, that's already been happening quite a lot, especially in Hillside and South Medford.
 A condo conversion provides a really fantastic profit opportunity for for-profit developers and for house flippers.
 And we've seen this, but especially if corporations and for-profit flippers that aren't rooted here in Medford, that kind of have no business in Medford except for extracting property from these conversions.
 If they're going to profit from housing in our community, we should make sure that that transaction gives something back to our community as well, to individual tenants who are displaced.
 and to the public at large and the ordinance provides a structure for doing that.
 In addition it's important to keep in mind as we're thinking through the levers in this ordinance that the conversion of rentals into condos has an impact on our chances of local racial and class diversity because not everybody can afford to buy a home.
 It's very important to have homes for the
 I think over 45% of Medford that does rent at this time.
 Anyway, this is a way to make sure that the public gets something back when what is often a mechanism of gentrification takes place.
 So with this ordinance, it's up to us to, you know, kind of pull the different levers to make this do what we want it to do in my mind and based on the conversations that we've had about this so far in council.
 The outcomes that we intend to get out of this ordinance are to target for-profit developers,
 while protecting homeowners and while protecting the retirement incomes of seniors in our community, to increase tenant protections, to increase the city's ability to connect displaced tenants with new comparable affordable housing, to make sure that relocation payments, compensation to displaced tenants aligns with the true cost of moving within our community, and to increase the incentives and the assistance to owners or condo developers
 to help with finding new housing for their tenants.
 And so as we go through the ordinance, I think the key questions for us to be considering and, you know, happy to add to this list are how do we make sure that we're targeting for-profit developers and flippers as opposed to owner-occupants?
 How what does that relate to a certain type or size of building that we should make sure to target or be sure to exempt?
 And what are the key enforcement related issues that we should make sure to get feedback from city staff on?
 So with that, if there are no pressing comments or questions from my fellow Councilors at this time, I'd happily run us quickly through the draft of the ordinance and then we can go forward.
 Proceed?
 I'll share my screen.
 All right, I'm going to try to go through this pretty quickly because it is quite long.
 This draft, including the comments, is on the city council's public portal for if anybody watching would like to follow along or read it in greater detail that I'm going to go into.
 So like I said, prior to the writing of this draft, the council reviewed several condo conversion ordinances from other communities in Massachusetts.
 This included Somerville, Boston, New Bedford, Lexington, and Marlborough.
 Based on my notes from our conversations in 2023, it seemed like our most instructive examples, the things that were closely aligned with the mechanisms that we might want to pursue.
 And most comparable and useful for us here in Medford would be Somerville's ordinance and Marlborough's ordinance.
 And there are some sections that are kind of adapted from those other communities as well.
 Boston tends to be pretty unique.
 It interacts pretty uniquely with state law in a lot of cases, but still really interesting to look at.
 So we start, I'm just going to run through this quickly.
 We start with the statement of purpose, which is kind of what I spoke to in terms of the housing context for this project in general.
 It's followed by a definitions section.
 These definitions align with the other ordinance, the other condo conversion ordinances that are held by our neighbors.
 Then we get to section three, condominium conversion requirements.
 Actually, let me just switch my navigation here.
 This is where we get into the meat of the ordinance this is speaking to.
 Okay, so we've gotten to the point where a condo conversion, a developer or an owner wants that to happen.
 Now what?
 So this is,
 This is where we start to get into that flowchart of what a developer might want to do with their property and what the city is saying must happen to increase fairness for tenants and the community in that case.
 Provisions for vacant units or owner-occupied units.
 These are treated a little bit differently.
 In this case, we don't have a tenant unrelated to the owner that might be displaced by the conversion.
 occupied units, this sets forth, sorry I'm losing my place here.
 So largely this is about how much notice is an owner required to give to a tenant when they intend to take a rental unit and convert it into a condominium.
 This was one major point of comparison among the other ordinances.
 Most of the other communities that we looked at give protected tenants a five year notice period and an either one or three year notice period for all other tenants.
 If you are a protected tenant, so for example, if you have a disability, if you are a senior, if you are low income, your notice period is five years.
 All other tenants, three years of notice.
 That's how long the owner has to give you a warning when they're about to take that rental off the market because they're going to perform a conversion.
 Renting units during a conversion, this is, this section is speaking to tenants' rights while they are kind of going through a current lease when an owner is preparing for conversion.
 And it speaks to essentially protecting tenants from the conditions of their lease changing while they're still in that same current lease.
 The intent of this is to prevent owners from doing things that would essentially try to force their tenants out early by, say, increasing the rent drastically or increasing demands on the tenant during their current lease so that they could make the conversion earlier.
 So this prevents that from happening.
 It also prevents evictions before the notice period, as specified earlier in this section, would be up.
 Tenant right to purchase was another stipulation that we saw in many other condominium conversion ordinances.
 This puts forward that when a owner wants to convert a unit that is currently occupied by a tenant, before they put it on the market, they must extend to the tenant like first right of refusal.
 Before they put it out to the general public, they have to offer it first to the tenant.
 on equal or comparable terms to that which they would be offering it on the free market.
 Most of the other examples that we looked at gave that first right of refusal period as 120 days to average tenants and 180 days refusal period in the case of protected tenants.
 We also have a section in here and this is interesting, something that I think the council should talk about further at some point is if a tenant should pass on this opportunity to purchase the unit once it is converted, that first, that's actually a second right of refusal would then go to the city of Medford or its designee which might include our affordable housing trust to maintain the property as affordable housing in perpetuity.
 And then it would be up to the city or its designee to waive that right to purchase and then it could go on to the market.
 I do want to note and make really clear.
 that this does not obligate any owner to sell the unit for less than it would be offering in good faith to third parties on the market.
 It's more about the sequence here, giving the tenant the first right to say no thank you, and after that, giving the municipality or its designee the right to say no thank you before it goes on the market.
 There are exceptions to the first right of refusal.
 including if they intend to transfer the condo to a close relative instead of offering it on the market.
 That would be an instance where first right of refusal to the tenant or to the city would be exempted.
 The intent of the ordinance is not to prevent people from converting units and then selling or giving it to a family member.
 going down to the next section underneath requirements if a condo conversion is going to take place.
 The other major piece of, or I would say one of the main pillars of the ordinance, of course, is increasing tenants' rights in the event of a condo conversion of a unit where they're living and also making sure that they are fairly compensated for the disruptions to their life as a result of that conversion.
 One of the ways that cities can do that is by making sure that
 tenants are financially compensated when they're displaced by a conversion.
 And so all of the condo conversion ordinances that we looked at from those other municipalities included some level of relocation payment.
 This is a way of making the tenant whole because they're being forced to move because of the conversion, whereas they otherwise wouldn't have had to.
 So in terms of the actual payment, the financial compensation, we looked at a bunch of different numbers from these other communities.
 The relocation benefit of $10,000 per unit for protected tenants and $6,000 per unit for all other tenants aligns us with the city of Somerville and how they are structuring their relocation payments.
 They're much higher in Boston.
 That makes sense.
 The cost of living is much higher in most parts of Boston.
 Boston's relocation payments are more like $15,000 for protected tenants and $10,000 for all other tenants.
 New Bedford and Marlboros are far lower.
 But again, I think that one of our north stars here is trying to make sure that it does what it's intended to do, and that's to make tenants whole based on the actual cost of moving and finding comparable housing after displacement.
 There's also an annual adjustment mechanism in here to make sure that we don't
 codify one relocation payment that in 10 or 20 years is vastly out of step with how much it actually does cost to move and resettle.
 So this draft includes language that is similar to what's found in other ordinances, that it shall be adjusted annually by an amount equal to the increase in the CPI for the preceding calendar year, just to make sure that this increases with inflation.
 Another way that this ordinance seeks to
 assist tenants with that displacement caused by the conversion is with actual housing and relocation assistance by the owner.
 The owner under this is entitled to assist the tenant with finding housing within the city of Medford that is comparable, that is not far more expensive or radically different that would essentially satisfy the needs that the current unit was satisfying for them.
 There's an interesting exemption in here essentially for owners who have gone above and beyond in terms of affordability.
 keeping their rent levels in line with MHA Section 8 payment standards, or limiting rent increases to no more than 5% per year.
 They are kind of given deference during this housing relocation assistance process, knowing that the rest of the housing market has been escalating far more rapidly than they allowed their unit to escalate, and this takes that into account.
 Essentially, we want to set homeowners up for, or owners and sellers up for success, not for failure.
 And this next section is kind of an extension of saying during the notice period when tenants are continuing to live at the unit during that notice period, the rental unit, the rental agreement is extended and it has to be comparable to the rental agreement that was signed prior to the beginning of the notice period.
 Again, not giving owners the ability to do any sort of bait and switch scheme to try to force tenants out early to speed up the conversion process.
 Subsection 8 goes over the administration and the regulation of conversions.
 Permits will be required for conversions and a sitting board within the city of Medford will do that process, administer those permits and make the necessary documentations.
 One second.
 I'm going to come back to permitting in a minute.
 Just to continue with the rest of the tenant rights and protections under this ordinance, it speaks to renovations to units during the notice period, again, protecting tenants from
 or super noisy or inconveniences due to renovations that the owner may be making to prepare for the conversion.
 Tenants still have to be able to enjoy a safe, quiet and peaceful home like anybody else.
 And the tenant does have the right to vacate their unit early before their lease period would expire, the notice period would expire should they choose to once the notice period has been given.
 So, excuse me.
 The next section sets up a condominium and cooperative review board in the city of Medford that will be the administrator of this ordinance and oversee the permitting process.
 And this is, I think, another interesting section for the city council and staff to review together.
 It was interesting looking at other ordinances, breakdown of who should sit on this board.
 My recommendation, based on that research in this draft, is for it to have seven full members and one alternate, which matches with a lot of our comparable communities.
 Staggered terms of three years each, and that the review board should include two homeowners.
 Nope, sorry, actually my total number I didn't update.
 Two homeowners, two tenants, at least one person that would fall into that protected class that might be a homeowner or a tenant, an elderly, disabled, or lower moderate income person.
 A representative from the CDB, a representative from the Affordable Housing Trust or Medford Housing Authority, and an alternate who may be either a homeowner or a tenant.
 And I think that actually does add up to seven people.
 If I can count and talk at the same time.
 This provides for an appointment process and an annual stipend, which is similar to that of the CDB.
 And it enumerates the board's duties and powers largely to enforce this ordinance.
 to create and make available the conversion permit applications to issue them to owners who want to do a conversion and who are compliant with the prerequisites found in this ordinance, to hear complaints from people who are alleging that this ordinance has been violated, to assist in a public awareness program about this ordinance, to establish fees for the issuing of permits,
 review the documentation of everything associated with this ordinance and condo conversions in Medford and to kind of keep a running list of those numbers, analyze the number of conversions in the city where they're taking place for the edification of the city and the city council.
 And then finally, the board retains the power to not issue a permit to any owner
 who has taken any action to circumvent mass general law chapter.
 527, which also deals with condo conversions or of this ordinance, including but not limited to unreasonable rent increases, reduction or elimination of services, termination of any tenancy without cause or the imposition of new conditions of the tenancy.
 Essentially, if a owner of a rental unit is being a really bad landlord, if they're doing shady things to try to vacate tenants in ways that are illegal, the board then has the discretion to not issue a conversion.
 if a pattern of that behavior is documented.
 And I just want to, speaking of powers and discretion granted to the board, this is a little bit earlier in section three.
 But just while we're on that topic, broadly owners in order to retain a conversion permit
 are required to comply with Chapter, Master and Rule of Chapter 527 of the Acts of 1983.
 And, sorry for pausing, I'm looking for something specific.
 Right, my apologies.
 In subsection seven.
 The board is permitted to make the conversion permit subject to reasonable conditions for the protection of tenants and the public interest of the city of Medford, including but not limited to these following factors.
 And this part is really important because this is the section of the ordinance that essentially says what is that kind of
 What's the word I'm looking for?
 How is the city allowed to make that decision of whether to issue a conversion permit or not?
 And different cities handle this differently and handle discretion of this differently.
 Some other cities that we looked at have a hard cap, like for example, in Marlborough.
 And per their ordinance, no more than 25% of units in a building per year may be converted from rental to conversion in other cities.
 Whether conversion permits are approved or not depends on the vacancy rate of units community wide, which I do think is a very interesting way to handle it.
 To essentially let the housing market and the vacancy rate be a guide on how many units are allowed to be taken out of the rental market.
 These are things for the city council to consider as we move forward.
 I did not include those hard caps in this draft.
 I don't know that that would be my recommendation.
 But some of the other factors and pieces of context from some of our neighbors I thought were useful.
 For example, when deciding whether to approve a permit or not, to consider the hardships imposed on the tenants residing in the accommodations proposed to be converted.
 The aggravation of the shortage of rental housing accommodations in the city.
 particularly for lower income people.
 What reasonable arrangements may have been made or will be made to alleviate the hardship on the tenants that might be affected by the conversion, and an intent by the owner to offer a reasonable percentage of the new conversions to sell to the Medford Housing Authority, Affordable Housing Trust, or another entity that will serve a similar function.
 So a lot of the same principles are at play here, but this leaves a little bit more discretion in the hands of the board to interpret hardship, to interpret the market, and to approve or deny permits based on those important pieces of context.
 So I will jump down again to, I think we're at section five now.
 Permitting process, this is the, lays out the steps that an owner with an intent to convert might go through.
 I'm not going to go through this in great detail.
 This provides details for if you want a permit to convert, here's how you do it.
 Here's the steps that you would take.
 The granting process, which would include, again, some administrative steps and some hearings before the board.
 And then if a permit were to expire before it is approved, steps that the owner must take to get a new one and restart the process.
 Effective date, I propose that the ordinance would take effect six months after passage.
 Give the city time to prepare, create the board, empower the board, and start that administrative process.
 Standard severability clause, annual reporting.
 The review board should submit to the city council building department and office of planning development and sustainability an annual report kind of summarizing what we have learned about conversions, their rate, where they're happening in the city because of this ordinance and penalties for violation.
 This was also adapted from other communities with condo conversion ordinances putting forth or actually this one was pulled directly from mass general law I believe.
 that any property owner who violates or knowingly permits a violation will be punished with a fine of not less than $1,000.
 With the final disclaimer that a violation of this ordinance by an owner will not affect or negatively impact its sale to a purchaser who is not involved in the violation and had no knowledge of it.
 I'm going to pause there.
 for a second, so I can pull up my other notes document.
 Are there any initial reactions, questions, or sections that we should go back to?
 All right, I'll go to Councilor Leming and then Councilor Bears.
 Oh, wait.
 I went to you first, go ahead.

 Điều đó thật tuyệt vời.

 Vì vậy, câu hỏi duy nhất khác của tôi là, bạn nghĩ chúng ta nên liên hệ với ai trong đội ngũ nhân viên thành phố hoặc hội đồng quản trị và ủy ban để gặp họ về vấn đề này?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2671.802s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Tất nhiên PDS, Giám đốc Hunter và tôi tin rằng Planner Evans đã thảo luận vấn đề này trong các cuộc họp trước đây của chúng tôi.
 Chúng rất hữu ích.
 Tôi nghĩ chắc chắn chúng nên được đưa vào.
 Không còn nghi ngờ gì nữa, Tòa nhà Ủy viên.
 Và cựu Ủy viên số 40 đã giúp đỡ ông rất nhiều khi ông còn đương nhiệm cách đây vài năm.
 Ngoài ra, tôi nghĩ có
 Chủ tịch Ngân hàng Phát triển Trung Quốc và đại diện Quỹ Nhà ở Giá phải chăng đáng tin cậy đã đưa ra một số nhận xét.
 Đây sẽ là bốn hoặc năm điểm đầu tiên của tôi và tôi rất vui khi xác định được những gì tôi cho là điểm quyết định quan trọng và ghi chúng vào một bản ghi nhớ làm đề xuất để thảo luận ở hội đồng tiếp theo.</p>

 Tiếp theo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2719.525s">[Matt Leming]</a>: Khi tôi đang trải qua điều này, tôi đã ghi nhớ hai điều.
 Đầu tiên, tôi biết được rằng có một
 Một dự luật, nhưng tôi chưa thực sự chú ý đến nó, tôi chưa thực sự chú ý đến những gì bạn đã làm trong vài năm qua liên quan đến việc ưu tiên cho người thuê nhà ở Tòa nhà Quốc hội tiểu bang.
 Vì vậy, câu hỏi đầu tiên của tôi là: Yếu tố này tương tác với luật pháp của tiểu bang như thế nào?
 Điều thứ hai tôi nghĩ đến là:
 Dựa trên nghiên cứu của bạn trong các cộng đồng khác, bạn có biết bảng đánh giá căn hộ được xử lý như thế nào không?
 Số lượng đơn đăng ký nhận được mỗi năm chỉ lớn hơn gấp nhiều lần.
 Vì vậy, nếu chúng tôi thành lập một ủy ban cụ thể, nó có dành cho những người được liệt kê trong Phần Bốn không? Liệu họ có gặp nhau mỗi năm một lần không?
 Hay đây sẽ là một nhiệm vụ hàng tháng?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2781.749s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Vâng, đó là một câu hỏi hay.
 Hãy để tôi dành chút thời gian để ghi lại một số ghi chú và một số dữ liệu về các chuyển đổi trong quá khứ của chúng tôi.
 Một giây.
 Tôi nghĩ là không có trong tài liệu.
 Ồ, tôi nghĩ đó là một câu hỏi rất hay.
 Tôi không thể nói về việc người khác bận rộn như thế nào
 Hội đồng xét duyệt căn hộ cộng đồng thì có, nhưng tôi cảm thấy rằng đây phải giống một mô hình CBD với các cuộc họp thường trực hàng tháng hơn là một thỏa thuận hàng năm, không phải vì tôi nghĩ sẽ có, không phải vì tôi nghĩ sẽ có nhiều giấy phép, mà hơn thế nữa, chúng tôi muốn có thể xử lý giấy phép kinh doanh nhanh chóng khi chúng đến hội đồng.
 chúng tôi không muốn thắng
 Một nhân viên bán hàng hoặc chủ sở hữu có kỳ vọng cao từ khán giả của họ.
 Cựu thực tập sinh PDS đã nghiên cứu việc cải tạo căn hộ ở Medford từ năm 2018 đến năm 2022 và sẽ
 Một cảnh báo rất quan trọng mà bạn đã đề cập vào thời điểm đó: rất khó để có được dữ liệu này vì chúng tôi không theo dõi nó.
 Vì vậy, nó hơi mềm và không sắc nét như chúng ta mong muốn.
 Nhưng theo đăng ký trên bài báo của chúng tôi, số lượng chuyển đổi là khoảng 24 vào năm 2018, 30 vào năm sau, 29 vào năm 2020, 37 vào năm 2021 và 33 vào năm 2022.
 Tôi giải thích điều này có nghĩa là nó không thực sự là một trận lũ lụt.
 Đây cũng không phải là một số tiền lớn đối với toàn thành phố, ít nhất là vào thời điểm này, đối với hội đồng xét duyệt.
 Tất nhiên, tôi nghĩ rằng có thể có nhiều chuyển đổi có thể được ghi lại theo cách khác hoặc không và có thể chúng thậm chí không xuất hiện trong dữ liệu.
 Nhưng tôi nghĩ đây là khối lượng công việc ở cấp CBD nhiều hơn, hoặc ít nhất là khối lượng công việc ở cấp CBD hai năm trước.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2912.519s">[Matt Leming]</a>: bạn có nó Bạn có biết phần luật pháp tiểu bang không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2918.969s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Ồ, phải, xin lỗi.
 Bạn đang nói về luật tiểu bang liên quan đến quyền mua của người thuê nhà phải không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2925.888s">[Matt Leming]</a>: Đúng.
 Đúng.
 sự ưu tiên.
 Tôi chỉ nhớ mơ hồ thôi.
 Tôi chưa đọc Luật 1983 mà bạn đề cập nên không biết có chi tiết hay không.
 Nhưng tôi nhớ đây là một trong những điểm cấp tiến mà họ đưa ra khi Đạo luật Nhà ở Giá cả phải chăng đang được thảo luận vào thời điểm đó, khi họ công nhận khả năng các thành phố thực hiện các ưu tiên của người thuê nhà.
 Tôi bối rối không biết cuộc tranh luận này sẽ đi đến đâu.</p>

 Tôi nghĩ rằng vấn đề thực sự ở cấp địa phương là quyền từ chối đầu tiên của thành phố, nhưng tôi đoán, thưa Tổng thống Bales, nếu ông có thể có bất kỳ nhận xét nào về điều đó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2967.398s">[Zac Bears]</a>: Vâng, vâng, hóa đơn mua nhà đề cập đến những người thuê nhà bất kể quá trình chuyển đổi của họ.
 Luật năm 1983 đặc biệt cho phép chuyển đổi căn hộ, đó là sự khác biệt.
 Xuất sắc.
 Đúng.
 Đúng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2980.905s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Tôi nghĩ điều đáng chú ý là ở Somerville, quyền từ chối đầu tiên của thành phố đã bị loại bỏ một cách hiệu quả.
 Điều này vẫn còn trong bản dự thảo này vì tôi biết dù sao thì nó cũng sẽ thay đổi.
 Tôi nghĩ thành phố nên có quyền từ chối thứ nhất hoặc thứ hai.
 Nhưng nếu nó vẫn nằm trong dự thảo này, tôi chắc chắn luật sư thành phố sẽ nói với chúng ta rằng điều này có thể bị coi là bất hợp pháp.
 tôi thấy
 Một điều khác tôi muốn nhấn mạnh trong cuộc thảo luận sơ bộ này là một điểm tranh luận và so sánh quan trọng khác trong một số sắc lệnh cộng đồng khác: liệu một số loại tòa nhà nhất định có nên được miễn trừ hay không.
 Như chúng ta đã thảo luận, các quy định có nhiều miễn trừ khác cho những điều khác nhau.
 Phạm vi của loại từ chối thứ nhất có thể được miễn đối với những chủ sở hữu có ý định bán hoặc chuyển nhượng cho thành viên trong gia đình.
 Ở các cộng đồng khác, các tòa nhà nhỏ được miễn hạn chế này.
 Kiểu như, chờ đã, tôi xin lỗi.
 Xin lỗi, tôi phải bắt đầu lại câu này.
 Ở một số cộng đồng khác, các tòa nhà 2 và 3 căn thực sự được miễn toàn bộ sắc lệnh bởi vì, rõ ràng hơn và không cần phải nói, việc chủ sở hữu nhà ở chuyển đổi các tòa nhà 2 hoặc 3 căn để sống gần hoặc trong đó là điều phổ biến hơn.
 Tôi không nghĩ đây là điểm khởi đầu tốt cho Medford.
 Chúng tôi thấy rất nhiều người không cư trú bỏ tiền mua căn hộ hai tầng và căn hộ dành cho ba gia đình.
 Tôi nghĩ có nhiều cách khác để điều chỉnh các quy định của sắc lệnh sao cho công bằng với chủ sở hữu nhưng không miễn trừ hoàn toàn các tòa nhà nhỏ khỏi sắc lệnh và các biện pháp bảo vệ người thuê nhà.
 Ngoài ra, tôi muốn đưa điều này vào bản ghi nhớ để Hội đồng xem xét trong tương lai, tùy thuộc vào mức độ sáng tạo mà chúng tôi muốn.
 Các cộng đồng khác đã giải quyết vấn đề này theo những cách thú vị.
 Ví dụ, ở Malden, tránh chuyển đổi các tòa nhà hai và ba căn trừ khi tỷ lệ trống vượt quá một tỷ lệ nhất định.
 Đây là một cách khác để làm phức tạp các quy định và khiến chúng trở nên nhạy cảm hơn với những gì đang thực sự xảy ra trên thị trường nhà ở trong một năm nhất định.
 Nhưng hiện tại, dự luật không miễn trừ bất kỳ tòa nhà nào chỉ vì quy mô hoặc số lượng căn hộ của nó.
 Tôi nghĩ việc chúng tôi giữ nó là phù hợp, đặc biệt là vì chúng tôi đã thấy nhiều tòa nhà nhỏ hơn gồm 2 hoặc 3 căn hộ đang được chuyển đổi và tu sửa, đặc biệt là ở các khu vực lân cận mà chúng tôi đã thảo luận trước đây.
 Bất cứ ai, đến.
 Đặc biệt.</p>

 Chủ tịch Collins không chỉ vì sự lãnh đạo của ông trong mệnh lệnh hành pháp này mà còn vì sự lãnh đạo sắc sảo của ông đối với ủy ban này trong hai năm qua.
 Tất cả mọi người sẽ nhớ đến sự hiện diện của bạn với tư cách là chủ tịch ủy ban này, đặc biệt là những người sẽ là thành viên tiếp theo của ủy ban.

 Thật là một mất mát lớn khi ông không thể lãnh đạo ủy ban này.
 Ý tôi là, bạn đã đạt được rất nhiều thành tựu trong thời gian làm việc tại Hội đồng Thành phố Medford.
 Các bạn đã phục vụ tốt cho thành phố và tôi biết chúng ta sẽ giải quyết vấn đề này trong tương lai.
 Trong một cuộc họp thường xuyên, nhưng cảm ơn bạn rất nhiều.
 Cảm ơn bạn rất nhiều vì dịch vụ của bạn.
 Đó là một nhiệm vụ rất khó khăn, trong các cuộc họp, ở hậu trường hoặc trong cuộc sống của các bạn, để hướng dẫn chúng tôi vượt qua những gì đã xảy ra trong nhiệm kỳ vừa qua của ủy ban này.
 Tôi đã học được rất nhiều điều từ bạn và rất vui được gặp bạn.

 Được rồi, theo đề nghị hoãn lại.
 Đợi đã, chúng ta có thể gọi, phải không?
 Ý tôi là, đừng trả lời điện thoại, cái khác đi.
 Vâng, tôi đã lâu không làm chủ tịch ủy ban này.
 Xin lỗi Rich, có vẻ như tôi đang gặp rắc rối với đồng nghiệp lần cuối.
