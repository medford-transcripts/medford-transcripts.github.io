    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=988.883s">[Kit Collins]</a>:  Present.
 Three present, two absent.
 The meeting is called to order.
 Thank you all for being here.
 People were clamoring for one final planning and permitting committee meeting before we closed out this term, so I had to oblige.
 The action and discussion item, thank you for laughing, Simon.
 The action discussion item for tonight's meeting is paper 22-321, a condominium conversion ordinance.
 This is something that we have not talked about in a little while.
 It's been on the council's radar for a couple of terms now.
 This was brought up in the context, initially this was brought up as an idea before the council in the context of one of the mass displacement events in Medford in recent years when a couple dozen tenants were evicted, no fault, from the Bradley Road rental building.
 In 2022, this is brought up as one possible strategy that Medford could look into as a strategy that many municipalities have pursued as a way of protecting the stock of rental units within a city.
 There are many strategies that have to work together to preserve affordable housing and to preserve rental housing stock within a municipality.
 This is one that actually many of our neighbors here in Massachusetts
 have used and have adapted and have adapted to fit their unique needs.
 And so in 2022, we had a couple of initial meetings on this idea.
 We gathered and looked at together some initial research, compared what some of our neighbors do and don't do through their condo conversion ordinances.
 and put together a framework from which we would make a draft ordinance in those couple preliminary meetings which were in March and September of 2023.
 Like I said, we looked at kind of a survey of some other municipalities, condo conversion ordinances, compared and contrasted them, and also got some initial reactions and questions on the board from our planning development sustainability department and our building commissioner.
 So what we have today, and this is in the agenda packet, is a preliminary kind of version one draft of a condo conversion ordinance, which I wrote.
 The text did not just come out of my head.
 This came from several, this was adapted from
 several of the different condo conversion ordinances that are currently on the books in many of our, in some of our neighboring communities, who we looked at, who we looked to as examples at the September 2023 meeting and discussed and it kind of comes out of our conversation from about a year and a half ago about what of these neighboring communities ordinances make sense and seems like it's interesting and seems like it's something that'd be worth looking into here in Medford and which of these things seem like they're less tailored for a community like ours.
 So I'm happy to run through that draft tonight, but just quickly since it has been a while since we've looked at this, I just want to quickly recenter us on kind of the principles of this ordinance and the why of doing it at all.
 Why do a condo conversion ordinance?
 This is, like I said, it's just one strategy, but it's a way of making sure that the city has more control and has a seat at the table when the conversion of rental units to condominiums happens in a city.
 And we know that in Medford, that's already been happening quite a lot, especially in Hillside and South Medford.
 A condo conversion provides a really fantastic profit opportunity for for-profit developers and for house flippers.
 And we've seen this, but especially if corporations and for-profit flippers that aren't rooted here in Medford, that kind of have no business in Medford except for extracting property from these conversions.
 If they're going to profit from housing in our community, we should make sure that that transaction gives something back to our community as well, to individual tenants who are displaced.
 and to the public at large and the ordinance provides a structure for doing that.
 In addition it's important to keep in mind as we're thinking through the levers in this ordinance that the conversion of rentals into condos has an impact on our chances of local racial and class diversity because not everybody can afford to buy a home.
 It's very important to have homes for the
 I think over 45% of Medford that does rent at this time.
 Anyway, this is a way to make sure that the public gets something back when what is often a mechanism of gentrification takes place.
 So with this ordinance, it's up to us to, you know, kind of pull the different levers to make this do what we want it to do in my mind and based on the conversations that we've had about this so far in council.
 The outcomes that we intend to get out of this ordinance are to target for-profit developers,
 while protecting homeowners and while protecting the retirement incomes of seniors in our community, to increase tenant protections, to increase the city's ability to connect displaced tenants with new comparable affordable housing, to make sure that relocation payments, compensation to displaced tenants aligns with the true cost of moving within our community, and to increase the incentives and the assistance to owners or condo developers
 to help with finding new housing for their tenants.
 And so as we go through the ordinance, I think the key questions for us to be considering and, you know, happy to add to this list are how do we make sure that we're targeting for-profit developers and flippers as opposed to owner-occupants?
 How what does that relate to a certain type or size of building that we should make sure to target or be sure to exempt?
 And what are the key enforcement related issues that we should make sure to get feedback from city staff on?
 So with that, if there are no pressing comments or questions from my fellow Councilors at this time, I'd happily run us quickly through the draft of the ordinance and then we can go forward.
 Proceed?
 I'll share my screen.
 All right, I'm going to try to go through this pretty quickly because it is quite long.
 This draft, including the comments, is on the city council's public portal for if anybody watching would like to follow along or read it in greater detail that I'm going to go into.
 So like I said, prior to the writing of this draft, the council reviewed several condo conversion ordinances from other communities in Massachusetts.
 This included Somerville, Boston, New Bedford, Lexington, and Marlborough.
 Based on my notes from our conversations in 2023, it seemed like our most instructive examples, the things that were closely aligned with the mechanisms that we might want to pursue.
 And most comparable and useful for us here in Medford would be Somerville's ordinance and Marlborough's ordinance.
 And there are some sections that are kind of adapted from those other communities as well.
 Boston tends to be pretty unique.
 It interacts pretty uniquely with state law in a lot of cases, but still really interesting to look at.
 So we start, I'm just going to run through this quickly.
 We start with the statement of purpose, which is kind of what I spoke to in terms of the housing context for this project in general.
 It's followed by a definitions section.
 These definitions align with the other ordinance, the other condo conversion ordinances that are held by our neighbors.
 Then we get to section three, condominium conversion requirements.
 Actually, let me just switch my navigation here.
 This is where we get into the meat of the ordinance this is speaking to.
 Okay, so we've gotten to the point where a condo conversion, a developer or an owner wants that to happen.
 Now what?
 So this is,
 This is where we start to get into that flowchart of what a developer might want to do with their property and what the city is saying must happen to increase fairness for tenants and the community in that case.
 Provisions for vacant units or owner-occupied units.
 These are treated a little bit differently.
 In this case, we don't have a tenant unrelated to the owner that might be displaced by the conversion.
 occupied units, this sets forth, sorry I'm losing my place here.
 So largely this is about how much notice is an owner required to give to a tenant when they intend to take a rental unit and convert it into a condominium.
 This was one major point of comparison among the other ordinances.
 Most of the other communities that we looked at give protected tenants a five year notice period and an either one or three year notice period for all other tenants.
 If you are a protected tenant, so for example, if you have a disability, if you are a senior, if you are low income, your notice period is five years.
 All other tenants, three years of notice.
 That's how long the owner has to give you a warning when they're about to take that rental off the market because they're going to perform a conversion.
 Renting units during a conversion, this is, this section is speaking to tenants' rights while they are kind of going through a current lease when an owner is preparing for conversion.
 And it speaks to essentially protecting tenants from the conditions of their lease changing while they're still in that same current lease.
 The intent of this is to prevent owners from doing things that would essentially try to force their tenants out early by, say, increasing the rent drastically or increasing demands on the tenant during their current lease so that they could make the conversion earlier.
 So this prevents that from happening.
 It also prevents evictions before the notice period, as specified earlier in this section, would be up.
 Tenant right to purchase was another stipulation that we saw in many other condominium conversion ordinances.
 This puts forward that when a owner wants to convert a unit that is currently occupied by a tenant, before they put it on the market, they must extend to the tenant like first right of refusal.
 Before they put it out to the general public, they have to offer it first to the tenant.
 on equal or comparable terms to that which they would be offering it on the free market.
 Most of the other examples that we looked at gave that first right of refusal period as 120 days to average tenants and 180 days refusal period in the case of protected tenants.
 We also have a section in here and this is interesting, something that I think the council should talk about further at some point is if a tenant should pass on this opportunity to purchase the unit once it is converted, that first, that's actually a second right of refusal would then go to the city of Medford or its designee which might include our affordable housing trust to maintain the property as affordable housing in perpetuity.
 And then it would be up to the city or its designee to waive that right to purchase and then it could go on to the market.
 I do want to note and make really clear.
 that this does not obligate any owner to sell the unit for less than it would be offering in good faith to third parties on the market.
 It's more about the sequence here, giving the tenant the first right to say no thank you, and after that, giving the municipality or its designee the right to say no thank you before it goes on the market.
 There are exceptions to the first right of refusal.
 including if they intend to transfer the condo to a close relative instead of offering it on the market.
 That would be an instance where first right of refusal to the tenant or to the city would be exempted.
 The intent of the ordinance is not to prevent people from converting units and then selling or giving it to a family member.
 going down to the next section underneath requirements if a condo conversion is going to take place.
 The other major piece of, or I would say one of the main pillars of the ordinance, of course, is increasing tenants' rights in the event of a condo conversion of a unit where they're living and also making sure that they are fairly compensated for the disruptions to their life as a result of that conversion.
 One of the ways that cities can do that is by making sure that
 tenants are financially compensated when they're displaced by a conversion.
 And so all of the condo conversion ordinances that we looked at from those other municipalities included some level of relocation payment.
 This is a way of making the tenant whole because they're being forced to move because of the conversion, whereas they otherwise wouldn't have had to.
 So in terms of the actual payment, the financial compensation, we looked at a bunch of different numbers from these other communities.
 The relocation benefit of $10,000 per unit for protected tenants and $6,000 per unit for all other tenants aligns us with the city of Somerville and how they are structuring their relocation payments.
 They're much higher in Boston.
 That makes sense.
 The cost of living is much higher in most parts of Boston.
 Boston's relocation payments are more like $15,000 for protected tenants and $10,000 for all other tenants.
 New Bedford and Marlboros are far lower.
 But again, I think that one of our north stars here is trying to make sure that it does what it's intended to do, and that's to make tenants whole based on the actual cost of moving and finding comparable housing after displacement.
 There's also an annual adjustment mechanism in here to make sure that we don't
 codify one relocation payment that in 10 or 20 years is vastly out of step with how much it actually does cost to move and resettle.
 So this draft includes language that is similar to what's found in other ordinances, that it shall be adjusted annually by an amount equal to the increase in the CPI for the preceding calendar year, just to make sure that this increases with inflation.
 Another way that this ordinance seeks to
 assist tenants with that displacement caused by the conversion is with actual housing and relocation assistance by the owner.
 The owner under this is entitled to assist the tenant with finding housing within the city of Medford that is comparable, that is not far more expensive or radically different that would essentially satisfy the needs that the current unit was satisfying for them.
 There's an interesting exemption in here essentially for owners who have gone above and beyond in terms of affordability.
 keeping their rent levels in line with MHA Section 8 payment standards, or limiting rent increases to no more than 5% per year.
 They are kind of given deference during this housing relocation assistance process, knowing that the rest of the housing market has been escalating far more rapidly than they allowed their unit to escalate, and this takes that into account.
 Essentially, we want to set homeowners up for, or owners and sellers up for success, not for failure.
 And this next section is kind of an extension of saying during the notice period when tenants are continuing to live at the unit during that notice period, the rental unit, the rental agreement is extended and it has to be comparable to the rental agreement that was signed prior to the beginning of the notice period.
 Again, not giving owners the ability to do any sort of bait and switch scheme to try to force tenants out early to speed up the conversion process.
 Subsection 8 goes over the administration and the regulation of conversions.
 Permits will be required for conversions and a sitting board within the city of Medford will do that process, administer those permits and make the necessary documentations.
 One second.
 I'm going to come back to permitting in a minute.
 Just to continue with the rest of the tenant rights and protections under this ordinance, it speaks to renovations to units during the notice period, again, protecting tenants from
 or super noisy or inconveniences due to renovations that the owner may be making to prepare for the conversion.
 Tenants still have to be able to enjoy a safe, quiet and peaceful home like anybody else.
 And the tenant does have the right to vacate their unit early before their lease period would expire, the notice period would expire should they choose to once the notice period has been given.
 So, excuse me.
 The next section sets up a condominium and cooperative review board in the city of Medford that will be the administrator of this ordinance and oversee the permitting process.
 And this is, I think, another interesting section for the city council and staff to review together.
 It was interesting looking at other ordinances, breakdown of who should sit on this board.
 My recommendation, based on that research in this draft, is for it to have seven full members and one alternate, which matches with a lot of our comparable communities.
 Staggered terms of three years each, and that the review board should include two homeowners.
 Nope, sorry, actually my total number I didn't update.
 Two homeowners, two tenants, at least one person that would fall into that protected class that might be a homeowner or a tenant, an elderly, disabled, or lower moderate income person.
 A representative from the CDB, a representative from the Affordable Housing Trust or Medford Housing Authority, and an alternate who may be either a homeowner or a tenant.
 And I think that actually does add up to seven people.
 If I can count and talk at the same time.
 This provides for an appointment process and an annual stipend, which is similar to that of the CDB.
 And it enumerates the board's duties and powers largely to enforce this ordinance.
 to create and make available the conversion permit applications to issue them to owners who want to do a conversion and who are compliant with the prerequisites found in this ordinance, to hear complaints from people who are alleging that this ordinance has been violated, to assist in a public awareness program about this ordinance, to establish fees for the issuing of permits,
 review the documentation of everything associated with this ordinance and condo conversions in Medford and to kind of keep a running list of those numbers, analyze the number of conversions in the city where they're taking place for the edification of the city and the city council.
 And then finally, the board retains the power to not issue a permit to any owner
 who has taken any action to circumvent mass general law chapter.
 527, which also deals with condo conversions or of this ordinance, including but not limited to unreasonable rent increases, reduction or elimination of services, termination of any tenancy without cause or the imposition of new conditions of the tenancy.
 Essentially, if a owner of a rental unit is being a really bad landlord, if they're doing shady things to try to vacate tenants in ways that are illegal, the board then has the discretion to not issue a conversion.
 if a pattern of that behavior is documented.
 And I just want to, speaking of powers and discretion granted to the board, this is a little bit earlier in section three.
 But just while we're on that topic, broadly owners in order to retain a conversion permit
 are required to comply with Chapter, Master and Rule of Chapter 527 of the Acts of 1983.
 And, sorry for pausing, I'm looking for something specific.
 Right, my apologies.
 In subsection seven.
 The board is permitted to make the conversion permit subject to reasonable conditions for the protection of tenants and the public interest of the city of Medford, including but not limited to these following factors.
 And this part is really important because this is the section of the ordinance that essentially says what is that kind of
 What's the word I'm looking for?
 How is the city allowed to make that decision of whether to issue a conversion permit or not?
 And different cities handle this differently and handle discretion of this differently.
 Some other cities that we looked at have a hard cap, like for example, in Marlborough.
 And per their ordinance, no more than 25% of units in a building per year may be converted from rental to conversion in other cities.
 Whether conversion permits are approved or not depends on the vacancy rate of units community wide, which I do think is a very interesting way to handle it.
 To essentially let the housing market and the vacancy rate be a guide on how many units are allowed to be taken out of the rental market.
 These are things for the city council to consider as we move forward.
 I did not include those hard caps in this draft.
 I don't know that that would be my recommendation.
 But some of the other factors and pieces of context from some of our neighbors I thought were useful.
 For example, when deciding whether to approve a permit or not, to consider the hardships imposed on the tenants residing in the accommodations proposed to be converted.
 The aggravation of the shortage of rental housing accommodations in the city.
 particularly for lower income people.
 What reasonable arrangements may have been made or will be made to alleviate the hardship on the tenants that might be affected by the conversion, and an intent by the owner to offer a reasonable percentage of the new conversions to sell to the Medford Housing Authority, Affordable Housing Trust, or another entity that will serve a similar function.
 So a lot of the same principles are at play here, but this leaves a little bit more discretion in the hands of the board to interpret hardship, to interpret the market, and to approve or deny permits based on those important pieces of context.
 So I will jump down again to, I think we're at section five now.
 Permitting process, this is the, lays out the steps that an owner with an intent to convert might go through.
 I'm not going to go through this in great detail.
 This provides details for if you want a permit to convert, here's how you do it.
 Here's the steps that you would take.
 The granting process, which would include, again, some administrative steps and some hearings before the board.
 And then if a permit were to expire before it is approved, steps that the owner must take to get a new one and restart the process.
 Effective date, I propose that the ordinance would take effect six months after passage.
 Give the city time to prepare, create the board, empower the board, and start that administrative process.
 Standard severability clause, annual reporting.
 The review board should submit to the city council building department and office of planning development and sustainability an annual report kind of summarizing what we have learned about conversions, their rate, where they're happening in the city because of this ordinance and penalties for violation.
 This was also adapted from other communities with condo conversion ordinances putting forth or actually this one was pulled directly from mass general law I believe.
 that any property owner who violates or knowingly permits a violation will be punished with a fine of not less than $1,000.
 With the final disclaimer that a violation of this ordinance by an owner will not affect or negatively impact its sale to a purchaser who is not involved in the violation and had no knowledge of it.
 I'm going to pause there.
 for a second, so I can pull up my other notes document.
 Are there any initial reactions, questions, or sections that we should go back to?
 All right, I'll go to Councilor Leming and then Councilor Bears.
 Oh, wait.
 I went to you first, go ahead.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2642.361s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 好的，我会快点的。
 是的。
 将您确定为决策点的评论作为一种一线决策点文件，以指导我们未来。
 那真是太棒了。
 谢谢。
 所以我唯一的另一个问题是，您认为我们应该联系市政府工作人员或董事会和委员会中的哪些人，与他们就此事进行会面？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2671.802s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 当然，PDS、亨特总监和我相信规划师埃文斯过去曾在我们的会议上讨论过这个问题。
 他们非常有帮助。
 我认为他们绝对应该被包括在内。
 毫无疑问，建设委员。
 而前四十号专员几年前还在任职时就给了他很大的帮助。
 此外，我认为拥有
 国家开发银行行长以及保障性住房信托基金的代表发表了讲话。
 这些将是我的前四名或前五名，我很高兴确定我认为的关键决策点，并将它们放入备忘录中，作为下届理事会讨论的建议。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2711.077s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 太好了，谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2712.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 谢谢。
 下一个。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2719.525s">[Matt Leming]</a>: 在经历这件事的过程中，我一直牢记两件事。
 首先，我了解到有一个
 一项法案，但我并没有真正关注它，我并没有真正关注你在过去两年中有关州议会大厦租户优先购买权的情况。
 所以我的第一个问题是：这个组成部分如何与州立法相互作用？
 我想到的第二件事是：
 根据您对其他社区的研究，您是否知道公寓审查委员会有多忙？
 他们每年收到的申请数量只是一个数量级。
 因此，如果我们专门成立一个委员会，该委员会将是第四部分中列出的人员吗？他们会每年开会一次吗？
 或者这会是每月的工作吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2781.749s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 是的，这是一个好问题。
 让我花点时间拿出一些笔记，其中包含一些有关我们过去转换的数据。
 一秒钟。
 它不在我认为的文档中。
 嗯，我认为这是一个非常好的问题。
 我无法谈论其他人有多忙
 社区公寓审查委员会是，但我的感觉是，这应该更像是每月举行常务会议而不是年度协议的 CBD 模式，这并不是因为我认为会有，也不是因为我认为会有这么多许可证，而是更多地沿着同样的思路，我们希望能够在营业执照提交给董事会时快速处理。
 我们不想有
 对受众期望很高的卖家或业主。
 前 PDS 实习生对 2018 年至 2022 年梅德福的公寓改造进行了研究，并将
 您当时提到的一个非常重要的警告：很难找到这些数据，因为我们没有跟踪它。
 所以它有点软，没有我们希望的那么清晰。
 但根据我们的契约登记，2018 年的转换数量约为 24 起，次年为 30 起，2020 年为 29 起，2021 年为 37 起，2022 年为 33 起。
 我将此解释为这并不是真正的洪水。
 对于审查委员会来说，这对于整个城市来说也不是一个大数目，至少在这一点上是这样。
 当然，我认为可能有很多转化可能以不同的方式记录，也可能没有，也许它们甚至没有出现在数据中。
 但我想这更多是CBD层面的工作量，或者至少是两年前CBD层面的工作量。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2912.519s">[Matt Leming]</a>: 你有吗？您了解州法律部分吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2918.969s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 哦，对了，抱歉。
 您是在谈论有关租户购买权的州法律吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2925.888s">[Matt Leming]</a>: 是的。
 是的。
 优先权。
 我只记得模糊。
 我没有读过你提到的1983年法案，所以我不确定那里是否有详细的内容。
 但我记得这是当时讨论《保障性住房法》时的激进观点之一，当时城市落实租户优先权的能力得到了认可。
 我有点不知道这场辩论的走向了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2957.294s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 当然。
 我认为在地方层面真正存在问题的是城市的优先购买权，但我想，贝尔斯总统，如果您能就此发表任何意见。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2967.398s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 是的，是的，众议院的法案提到了租户，无论他们的转变如何。
 1983 年的法律专门允许公寓改建，所以这就是区别。
 出色地。
 是的。
 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2980.905s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 我认为值得注意的是，在萨默维尔，该市的优先购买权实际上被取消了。
 这仍然在这个草案中，因为我知道无论如何它都会被改变。
 我认为这座城市应该有第一或第二拒绝权。
 但如果它保留在这份草案中，我相信市检察官会告诉我们，这可能被认为是非法的。
 我明白。
 我在这个初步讨论中要强调的另一件事是其他一些社区条例中争论和比较的另一个重要点：某些类型的建筑物是否应该豁免。
 正如我们所讨论的，该条例对于不同的事情还有许多其他豁免。
 对于打算出售或转让给家庭成员的业主来说，第一类拒绝的适用范围可以豁免。
 在其他社区，小型建筑不受此限制。
 例如，哦等等，对不起。
 抱歉，我必须重新开始那句话。
 在其他一些社区，2 和 3 单元建筑实际上不受整个条例的约束，因为更明显的是，不用说，业主居住者将 2 或 3 单元建筑改建为他们可以居住在附近或其中的情况更为常见。
 我并不认为这对梅德福来说是一个合适的起点。
 我们看到很多非本地资金购买复式公寓和三户公寓。
 我认为还有很多其他方法可以调整该条例的规定，使其对自住业主公平，但又不能完全免除小型建筑物的条例及其租户保护。
 另外，我希望将这一点包含在备忘录中，供未来理事会审议，具体取决于我们想要的创造力。
 其他社区已经以有趣的方式解决了这个问题。
 例如，在马尔登，除非空置率超过一定百分比，否则避免对两单元和三单元建筑进行改建。
 这是另一种使监管复杂化并让他们对特定年份的房地产市场实际情况更加敏感的方式。
 但就目前而言，该法案并没有仅仅因为任何建筑物的规模或单元数量而免除其豁免。
 我认为保持这种状态是合适的，特别是因为我们已经看到了许多较小的、两单元和三单元的建筑被改建和改建，特别是在我们之前讨论过的社区。
 任何人，都来吧。
 出色的。</p>
