1
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,495
forward for even a second.

2
00:12:49,755 --> 00:12:59,482
Yeah.

3
00:13:00,563 --> 00:13:04,086
Oh yeah, no, I didn't yet know that I haven't seen everybody to tell them that.

4
00:13:04,446 --> 00:13:05,307
Yeah, I'm doing that.

5
00:13:05,627 --> 00:13:07,869
Yeah, the mayor's great plan was to have you all share a desk.

6
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:09,150
Well, we should wait all one.

7
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,431
We all share one desk.

8
00:13:10,471 --> 00:13:11,852
Each two people share one desk.

9
00:13:11,932 --> 00:13:12,152
What?

10
00:13:12,753 --> 00:13:14,374
No, that would be dead right now.

11
00:13:14,514 --> 00:13:15,375
Yeah, well, that's

12
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:17,818
That's the mayor's plan.

13
00:15:23,003 --> 00:15:25,824
All right, good to go.

14
00:15:31,087 --> 00:15:32,347
Sorry, I closed something I need.

15
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:47,814
Okay.

16
00:15:50,522 --> 00:15:56,103
There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Planning and Permitting Committee, December 16th, 2025.

17
00:15:56,964 --> 00:15:58,504
This meeting will take place at 6 p.m.

18
00:15:58,664 --> 00:16:04,046
in the City Council Chambers, second floor, Medford City Hall, 85 George B. Hassett Drive, Medford MA and via Zoom.

19
00:16:05,326 --> 00:16:06,386
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

20
00:16:11,227 --> 00:16:12,188
Councilor Callahan.

21
00:16:13,488 --> 00:16:14,668
Councilor Callahan is absent.

22
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:17,429
Councilor Lemming.

23
00:16:19,493 --> 00:16:20,554
Councilor Scott Pelley.

24
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,277
Councilor Scott Pelley is absent.

25
00:16:24,398 --> 00:16:24,999
President Beers.

26
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:25,159
Present.

27
00:16:27,101 --> 00:16:28,222
Vice President Collins.

28
00:16:28,883 --> 00:16:29,223
Present.

29
00:16:29,944 --> 00:16:31,306
Three present, two absent.

30
00:16:31,406 --> 00:16:32,987
The meeting is called to order.

31
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:35,150
Thank you all for being here.

32
00:16:37,032 --> 00:16:41,757
People were clamoring for one final planning and permitting committee meeting before we closed out this term, so I had to oblige.

33
00:16:44,562 --> 00:16:47,184
The action and discussion item, thank you for laughing, Simon.

34
00:16:47,705 --> 00:16:56,652
The action discussion item for tonight's meeting is paper 22-321, a condominium conversion ordinance.

35
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,435
This is something that we have not talked about in a little while.

36
00:17:00,555 --> 00:17:05,259
It's been on the council's radar for a couple of terms now.

37
00:17:07,582 --> 00:17:24,504
This was brought up in the context, initially this was brought up as an idea before the council in the context of one of the mass displacement events in Medford in recent years when a couple dozen tenants were evicted, no fault, from the Bradley Road rental building.

38
00:17:25,438 --> 00:17:39,891
In 2022, this is brought up as one possible strategy that Medford could look into as a strategy that many municipalities have pursued as a way of protecting the stock of rental units within a city.

39
00:17:39,931 --> 00:17:46,217
There are many strategies that have to work together to preserve affordable housing and to preserve rental housing stock within a municipality.

40
00:17:46,237 --> 00:17:48,820
This is one that actually many of our neighbors here in Massachusetts

41
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,543
have used and have adapted and have adapted to fit their unique needs.

42
00:17:53,883 --> 00:18:00,048
And so in 2022, we had a couple of initial meetings on this idea.

43
00:18:00,588 --> 00:18:10,095
We gathered and looked at together some initial research, compared what some of our neighbors do and don't do through their condo conversion ordinances.

44
00:18:10,982 --> 00:18:19,706
and put together a framework from which we would make a draft ordinance in those couple preliminary meetings which were in March and September of 2023.

45
00:18:21,907 --> 00:18:37,775
Like I said, we looked at kind of a survey of some other municipalities, condo conversion ordinances, compared and contrasted them, and also got some initial reactions and questions on the board from our planning development sustainability department and our building commissioner.

46
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:48,252
So what we have today, and this is in the agenda packet, is a preliminary kind of version one draft of a condo conversion ordinance, which I wrote.

47
00:18:48,713 --> 00:18:51,376
The text did not just come out of my head.

48
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:54,420
This came from several, this was adapted from

49
00:18:55,621 --> 00:19:23,255
several of the different condo conversion ordinances that are currently on the books in many of our, in some of our neighboring communities, who we looked at, who we looked to as examples at the September 2023 meeting and discussed and it kind of comes out of our conversation from about a year and a half ago about what of these neighboring communities ordinances make sense and seems like it's interesting and seems like it's something that'd be worth looking into here in Medford and which of these things seem like they're less tailored for a community like ours.

50
00:19:26,134 --> 00:19:36,133
So I'm happy to run through that draft tonight, but just quickly since it has been a while since we've looked at this, I just want to quickly recenter us on kind of the principles of this ordinance and the why of doing it at all.

51
00:19:37,722 --> 00:19:39,084
Why do a condo conversion ordinance?

52
00:19:39,764 --> 00:19:49,813
This is, like I said, it's just one strategy, but it's a way of making sure that the city has more control and has a seat at the table when the conversion of rental units to condominiums happens in a city.

53
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:54,937
And we know that in Medford, that's already been happening quite a lot, especially in Hillside and South Medford.

54
00:19:55,844 --> 00:20:01,407
A condo conversion provides a really fantastic profit opportunity for for-profit developers and for house flippers.

55
00:20:02,728 --> 00:20:13,253
And we've seen this, but especially if corporations and for-profit flippers that aren't rooted here in Medford, that kind of have no business in Medford except for extracting property from these conversions.

56
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:21,978
If they're going to profit from housing in our community, we should make sure that that transaction gives something back to our community as well, to individual tenants who are displaced.

57
00:20:22,715 --> 00:20:25,876
and to the public at large and the ordinance provides a structure for doing that.

58
00:20:28,217 --> 00:20:40,301
In addition it's important to keep in mind as we're thinking through the levers in this ordinance that the conversion of rentals into condos has an impact on our chances of local racial and class diversity because not everybody can afford to buy a home.

59
00:20:40,361 --> 00:20:42,062
It's very important to have homes for the

60
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,501
I think over 45% of Medford that does rent at this time.

61
00:20:46,922 --> 00:20:53,565
Anyway, this is a way to make sure that the public gets something back when what is often a mechanism of gentrification takes place.

62
00:20:54,625 --> 00:21:04,669
So with this ordinance, it's up to us to, you know, kind of pull the different levers to make this do what we want it to do in my mind and based on the conversations that we've had about this so far in council.

63
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:10,512
The outcomes that we intend to get out of this ordinance are to target for-profit developers,

64
00:21:11,234 --> 00:21:39,301
while protecting homeowners and while protecting the retirement incomes of seniors in our community, to increase tenant protections, to increase the city's ability to connect displaced tenants with new comparable affordable housing, to make sure that relocation payments, compensation to displaced tenants aligns with the true cost of moving within our community, and to increase the incentives and the assistance to owners or condo developers

65
00:21:39,888 --> 00:21:42,090
to help with finding new housing for their tenants.

66
00:21:45,412 --> 00:21:55,480
And so as we go through the ordinance, I think the key questions for us to be considering and, you know, happy to add to this list are how do we make sure that we're targeting for-profit developers and flippers as opposed to owner-occupants?

67
00:21:57,342 --> 00:22:03,086
How what does that relate to a certain type or size of building that we should make sure to target or be sure to exempt?

68
00:22:04,507 --> 00:22:09,411
And what are the key enforcement related issues that we should make sure to get feedback from city staff on?

69
00:22:11,171 --> 00:22:21,402
So with that, if there are no pressing comments or questions from my fellow counselors at this time, I'd happily run us quickly through the draft of the ordinance and then we can go forward.

70
00:22:24,045 --> 00:22:24,365
Proceed?

71
00:22:24,905 --> 00:22:25,086
Okay.

72
00:22:31,052 --> 00:22:31,913
I'll share my screen.

73
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:44,872
All right, I'm going to try to go through this pretty quickly because it is quite long.

74
00:22:46,473 --> 00:22:56,338
This draft, including the comments, is on the city council's public portal for if anybody watching would like to follow along or read it in greater detail that I'm going to go into.

75
00:22:57,618 --> 00:23:06,543
So like I said, prior to the writing of this draft, the council reviewed several condo conversion ordinances from other communities in Massachusetts.

76
00:23:06,563 --> 00:23:10,305
This included Somerville, Boston, New Bedford, Lexington, and Marlborough.

77
00:23:11,175 --> 00:23:21,123
Based on my notes from our conversations in 2023, it seemed like our most instructive examples, the things that were closely aligned with the mechanisms that we might want to pursue.

78
00:23:21,783 --> 00:23:28,709
And most comparable and useful for us here in Medford would be Somerville's ordinance and Marlborough's ordinance.

79
00:23:28,749 --> 00:23:32,432
And there are some sections that are kind of adapted from those other communities as well.

80
00:23:33,232 --> 00:23:34,393
Boston tends to be pretty unique.

81
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:38,316
It interacts pretty uniquely with state law in a lot of cases, but still really interesting to look at.

82
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:42,158
So we start, I'm just going to run through this quickly.

83
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:50,001
We start with the statement of purpose, which is kind of what I spoke to in terms of the housing context for this project in general.

84
00:23:53,743 --> 00:23:56,144
It's followed by a definitions section.

85
00:23:57,465 --> 00:24:03,187
These definitions align with the other ordinance, the other condo conversion ordinances that are held by our neighbors.

86
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:11,071
Then we get to section three, condominium conversion requirements.

87
00:24:11,611 --> 00:24:14,812
Actually, let me just switch my navigation here.

88
00:24:16,292 --> 00:24:21,693
This is where we get into the meat of the ordinance this is speaking to.

89
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:27,954
Okay, so we've gotten to the point where a condo conversion, a developer or an owner wants that to happen.

90
00:24:28,895 --> 00:24:29,275
Now what?

91
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:30,295
So this is,

92
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:41,776
This is where we start to get into that flowchart of what a developer might want to do with their property and what the city is saying must happen to increase fairness for tenants and the community in that case.

93
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:50,102
Provisions for vacant units or owner-occupied units.

94
00:24:51,303 --> 00:24:52,643
These are treated a little bit differently.

95
00:24:52,683 --> 00:24:58,688
In this case, we don't have a tenant unrelated to the owner that might be displaced by the conversion.

96
00:25:00,524 --> 00:25:08,290
occupied units, this sets forth, sorry I'm losing my place here.

97
00:25:13,522 --> 00:25:21,247
So largely this is about how much notice is an owner required to give to a tenant when they intend to take a rental unit and convert it into a condominium.

98
00:25:22,467 --> 00:25:25,649
This was one major point of comparison among the other ordinances.

99
00:25:28,271 --> 00:25:36,916
Most of the other communities that we looked at give protected tenants a five year notice period and an either one or three year notice period for all other tenants.

100
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:46,664
If you are a protected tenant, so for example, if you have a disability, if you are a senior, if you are low income, your notice period is five years.

101
00:25:47,385 --> 00:25:49,847
All other tenants, three years of notice.

102
00:25:50,748 --> 00:25:58,655
That's how long the owner has to give you a warning when they're about to take that rental off the market because they're going to perform a conversion.

103
00:26:12,242 --> 00:26:23,604
Renting units during a conversion, this is, this section is speaking to tenants' rights while they are kind of going through a current lease when an owner is preparing for conversion.

104
00:26:25,385 --> 00:26:34,147
And it speaks to essentially protecting tenants from the conditions of their lease changing while they're still in that same current lease.

105
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:51,421
The intent of this is to prevent owners from doing things that would essentially try to force their tenants out early by, say, increasing the rent drastically or increasing demands on the tenant during their current lease so that they could make the conversion earlier.

106
00:26:52,082 --> 00:26:53,443
So this prevents that from happening.

107
00:26:57,006 --> 00:27:03,471
It also prevents evictions before the notice period, as specified earlier in this section, would be up.

108
00:27:05,668 --> 00:27:13,773
Tenant right to purchase was another stipulation that we saw in many other condominium conversion ordinances.

109
00:27:15,995 --> 00:27:28,823
This puts forward that when a owner wants to convert a unit that is currently occupied by a tenant, before they put it on the market, they must extend to the tenant like first right of refusal.

110
00:27:28,843 --> 00:27:32,625
Before they put it out to the general public, they have to offer it first to the tenant.

111
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,143
on equal or comparable terms to that which they would be offering it on the free market.

112
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:48,313
Most of the other examples that we looked at gave that first right of refusal period as 120 days to average tenants and 180 days refusal period in the case of protected tenants.

113
00:27:59,356 --> 00:28:24,649
We also have a section in here and this is interesting, something that I think the council should talk about further at some point is if a tenant should pass on this opportunity to purchase the unit once it is converted, that first, that's actually a second right of refusal would then go to the city of Medford or its designee which might include our affordable housing trust to maintain the property as affordable housing in perpetuity.

114
00:28:28,985 --> 00:28:37,760
And then it would be up to the city or its designee to waive that right to purchase and then it could go on to the market.

115
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:42,489
I do want to note and make really clear.

116
00:28:43,477 --> 00:28:54,524
that this does not obligate any owner to sell the unit for less than it would be offering in good faith to third parties on the market.

117
00:28:55,504 --> 00:29:04,549
It's more about the sequence here, giving the tenant the first right to say no thank you, and after that, giving the municipality or its designee the right to say no thank you before it goes on the market.

118
00:29:07,131 --> 00:29:10,833
There are exceptions to the first right of refusal.

119
00:29:13,117 --> 00:29:18,939
including if they intend to transfer the condo to a close relative instead of offering it on the market.

120
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:24,582
That would be an instance where first right of refusal to the tenant or to the city would be exempted.

121
00:29:26,303 --> 00:29:32,005
The intent of the ordinance is not to prevent people from converting units and then selling or giving it to a family member.

122
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:40,182
going down to the next section underneath requirements if a condo conversion is going to take place.

123
00:29:40,902 --> 00:29:58,847
The other major piece of, or I would say one of the main pillars of the ordinance, of course, is increasing tenants' rights in the event of a condo conversion of a unit where they're living and also making sure that they are fairly compensated for the disruptions to their life as a result of that conversion.

124
00:29:59,447 --> 00:30:01,728
One of the ways that cities can do that is by making sure that

125
00:30:02,338 --> 00:30:06,519
tenants are financially compensated when they're displaced by a conversion.

126
00:30:06,999 --> 00:30:15,562
And so all of the condo conversion ordinances that we looked at from those other municipalities included some level of relocation payment.

127
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:26,205
This is a way of making the tenant whole because they're being forced to move because of the conversion, whereas they otherwise wouldn't have had to.

128
00:30:28,956 --> 00:30:38,062
So in terms of the actual payment, the financial compensation, we looked at a bunch of different numbers from these other communities.

129
00:30:39,623 --> 00:30:51,831
The relocation benefit of $10,000 per unit for protected tenants and $6,000 per unit for all other tenants aligns us with the city of Somerville and how they are structuring their relocation payments.

130
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:55,453
They're much higher in Boston.

131
00:30:56,118 --> 00:30:56,618
That makes sense.

132
00:30:56,638 --> 00:30:58,860
The cost of living is much higher in most parts of Boston.

133
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:06,444
Boston's relocation payments are more like $15,000 for protected tenants and $10,000 for all other tenants.

134
00:31:07,445 --> 00:31:09,125
New Bedford and Marlboros are far lower.

135
00:31:09,206 --> 00:31:20,152
But again, I think that one of our north stars here is trying to make sure that it does what it's intended to do, and that's to make tenants whole based on the actual cost of moving and finding comparable housing after displacement.

136
00:31:20,172 --> 00:31:25,435
There's also an annual adjustment mechanism in here to make sure that we don't

137
00:31:27,742 --> 00:31:35,947
codify one relocation payment that in 10 or 20 years is vastly out of step with how much it actually does cost to move and resettle.

138
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:52,318
So this draft includes language that is similar to what's found in other ordinances, that it shall be adjusted annually by an amount equal to the increase in the CPI for the preceding calendar year, just to make sure that this increases with inflation.

139
00:31:54,619 --> 00:31:56,541
Another way that this ordinance seeks to

140
00:31:58,832 --> 00:32:07,137
assist tenants with that displacement caused by the conversion is with actual housing and relocation assistance by the owner.

141
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:22,186
The owner under this is entitled to assist the tenant with finding housing within the city of Medford that is comparable, that is not far more expensive or radically different that would essentially satisfy the needs that the current unit was satisfying for them.

142
00:32:23,845 --> 00:32:30,972
There's an interesting exemption in here essentially for owners who have gone above and beyond in terms of affordability.

143
00:32:34,649 --> 00:32:44,134
keeping their rent levels in line with MHA Section 8 payment standards, or limiting rent increases to no more than 5% per year.

144
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:57,480
They are kind of given deference during this housing relocation assistance process, knowing that the rest of the housing market has been escalating far more rapidly than they allowed their unit to escalate, and this takes that into account.

145
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:03,363
Essentially, we want to set homeowners up for, or owners and sellers up for success, not for failure.

146
00:33:08,692 --> 00:33:25,665
And this next section is kind of an extension of saying during the notice period when tenants are continuing to live at the unit during that notice period, the rental unit, the rental agreement is extended and it has to be comparable to the rental agreement that was signed prior to the beginning of the notice period.

147
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:35,492
Again, not giving owners the ability to do any sort of bait and switch scheme to try to force tenants out early to speed up the conversion process.

148
00:33:39,673 --> 00:33:46,478
Subsection 8 goes over the administration and the regulation of conversions.

149
00:33:47,799 --> 00:34:00,750
Permits will be required for conversions and a sitting board within the city of Medford will do that process, administer those permits and make the necessary documentations.

150
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,420
One second.

151
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:12,804
Okay.

152
00:34:13,545 --> 00:34:14,886
I'm going to come back to permitting in a minute.

153
00:34:15,527 --> 00:34:27,780
Just to continue with the rest of the tenant rights and protections under this ordinance, it speaks to renovations to units during the notice period, again, protecting tenants from

154
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:35,083
or super noisy or inconveniences due to renovations that the owner may be making to prepare for the conversion.

155
00:34:35,123 --> 00:34:41,205
Tenants still have to be able to enjoy a safe, quiet and peaceful home like anybody else.

156
00:34:42,045 --> 00:34:53,410
And the tenant does have the right to vacate their unit early before their lease period would expire, the notice period would expire should they choose to once the notice period has been given.

157
00:34:58,585 --> 00:35:00,647
So, excuse me.

158
00:35:03,329 --> 00:35:18,480
The next section sets up a condominium and cooperative review board in the city of Medford that will be the administrator of this ordinance and oversee the permitting process.

159
00:35:19,561 --> 00:35:26,386
And this is, I think, another interesting section for the city council and staff to review together.

160
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:34,740
It was interesting looking at other ordinances, breakdown of who should sit on this board.

161
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:44,363
My recommendation, based on that research in this draft, is for it to have seven full members and one alternate, which matches with a lot of our comparable communities.

162
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:49,764
Staggered terms of three years each, and that the review board should include two homeowners.

163
00:35:49,784 --> 00:35:53,285
Nope, sorry, actually my total number I didn't update.

164
00:35:56,088 --> 00:36:05,574
Two homeowners, two tenants, at least one person that would fall into that protected class that might be a homeowner or a tenant, an elderly, disabled, or lower moderate income person.

165
00:36:06,215 --> 00:36:16,381
A representative from the CDB, a representative from the Affordable Housing Trust or Medford Housing Authority, and an alternate who may be either a homeowner or a tenant.

166
00:36:16,401 --> 00:36:18,142
And I think that actually does add up to seven people.

167
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:21,885
If I can count and talk at the same time.

168
00:36:24,252 --> 00:36:29,103
This provides for an appointment process and an annual stipend, which is similar to that of the CDB.

169
00:36:30,025 --> 00:36:34,374
And it enumerates the board's duties and powers largely to enforce this ordinance.

170
00:36:35,258 --> 00:36:58,673
to create and make available the conversion permit applications to issue them to owners who want to do a conversion and who are compliant with the prerequisites found in this ordinance, to hear complaints from people who are alleging that this ordinance has been violated, to assist in a public awareness program about this ordinance, to establish fees for the issuing of permits,

171
00:37:01,475 --> 00:37:18,664
review the documentation of everything associated with this ordinance and condo conversions in Medford and to kind of keep a running list of those numbers, analyze the number of conversions in the city where they're taking place for the edification of the city and the city council.

172
00:37:23,186 --> 00:37:29,109
And then finally, the board retains the power to not issue a permit to any owner

173
00:37:30,545 --> 00:37:36,534
who has taken any action to circumvent mass general law chapter.

174
00:37:37,727 --> 00:37:49,952
527, which also deals with condo conversions or of this ordinance, including but not limited to unreasonable rent increases, reduction or elimination of services, termination of any tenancy without cause or the imposition of new conditions of the tenancy.

175
00:37:50,552 --> 00:38:05,099
Essentially, if a owner of a rental unit is being a really bad landlord, if they're doing shady things to try to vacate tenants in ways that are illegal, the board then has the discretion to not issue a conversion.

176
00:38:06,987 --> 00:38:08,727
if a pattern of that behavior is documented.

177
00:38:15,549 --> 00:38:25,611
And I just want to, speaking of powers and discretion granted to the board, this is a little bit earlier in section three.

178
00:38:28,732 --> 00:38:32,973
But just while we're on that topic, broadly owners in order to retain a conversion permit

179
00:38:33,502 --> 00:38:39,866
are required to comply with Chapter, Master and Rule of Chapter 527 of the Acts of 1983.

180
00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:51,993
And, sorry for pausing, I'm looking for something specific.

181
00:38:55,094 --> 00:38:56,055
Right, my apologies.

182
00:38:57,076 --> 00:38:58,056
In subsection seven.

183
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:14,017
The board is permitted to make the conversion permit subject to reasonable conditions for the protection of tenants and the public interest of the city of Medford, including but not limited to these following factors.

184
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:20,241
And this part is really important because this is the section of the ordinance that essentially says what is that kind of

185
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:26,531
What's the word I'm looking for?

186
00:39:27,572 --> 00:39:31,873
How is the city allowed to make that decision of whether to issue a conversion permit or not?

187
00:39:32,133 --> 00:39:36,615
And different cities handle this differently and handle discretion of this differently.

188
00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:42,276
Some other cities that we looked at have a hard cap, like for example, in Marlborough.

189
00:39:43,197 --> 00:39:50,759
And per their ordinance, no more than 25% of units in a building per year may be converted from rental to conversion in other cities.

190
00:39:52,025 --> 00:40:00,747
Whether conversion permits are approved or not depends on the vacancy rate of units community wide, which I do think is a very interesting way to handle it.

191
00:40:01,348 --> 00:40:07,989
To essentially let the housing market and the vacancy rate be a guide on how many units are allowed to be taken out of the rental market.

192
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:13,431
These are things for the city council to consider as we move forward.

193
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:18,128
I did not include those hard caps in this draft.

194
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:20,170
I don't know that that would be my recommendation.

195
00:40:21,671 --> 00:40:29,618
But some of the other factors and pieces of context from some of our neighbors I thought were useful.

196
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:37,565
For example, when deciding whether to approve a permit or not, to consider the hardships imposed on the tenants residing in the accommodations proposed to be converted.

197
00:40:39,327 --> 00:40:43,050
The aggravation of the shortage of rental housing accommodations in the city.

198
00:40:44,344 --> 00:40:46,385
particularly for lower income people.

199
00:40:48,765 --> 00:41:11,012
What reasonable arrangements may have been made or will be made to alleviate the hardship on the tenants that might be affected by the conversion, and an intent by the owner to offer a reasonable percentage of the new conversions to sell to the Medford Housing Authority, Affordable Housing Trust, or another entity that will serve a similar function.

200
00:41:13,108 --> 00:41:26,231
So a lot of the same principles are at play here, but this leaves a little bit more discretion in the hands of the board to interpret hardship, to interpret the market, and to approve or deny permits based on those important pieces of context.

201
00:41:30,952 --> 00:41:37,073
So I will jump down again to, I think we're at section five now.

202
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:45,955
Permitting process, this is the, lays out the steps that an owner with an intent to convert might go through.

203
00:41:45,995 --> 00:41:47,376
I'm not going to go through this in great detail.

204
00:41:49,658 --> 00:41:52,801
This provides details for if you want a permit to convert, here's how you do it.

205
00:41:53,061 --> 00:41:53,981
Here's the steps that you would take.

206
00:41:58,665 --> 00:42:08,413
The granting process, which would include, again, some administrative steps and some hearings before the board.

207
00:42:16,724 --> 00:42:26,770
And then if a permit were to expire before it is approved, steps that the owner must take to get a new one and restart the process.

208
00:42:30,192 --> 00:42:34,095
Effective date, I propose that the ordinance would take effect six months after passage.

209
00:42:34,235 --> 00:42:39,218
Give the city time to prepare, create the board, empower the board, and start that administrative process.

210
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:42,179
Standard severability clause, annual reporting.

211
00:42:43,367 --> 00:42:58,118
The review board should submit to the city council building department and office of planning development and sustainability an annual report kind of summarizing what we have learned about conversions, their rate, where they're happening in the city because of this ordinance and penalties for violation.

212
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:10,588
This was also adapted from other communities with condo conversion ordinances putting forth or actually this one was pulled directly from mass general law I believe.

213
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:17,731
that any property owner who violates or knowingly permits a violation will be punished with a fine of not less than $1,000.

214
00:43:23,152 --> 00:43:34,094
With the final disclaimer that a violation of this ordinance by an owner will not affect or negatively impact its sale to a purchaser who is not involved in the violation and had no knowledge of it.

215
00:43:39,375 --> 00:43:40,495
I'm going to pause there.

216
00:43:41,322 --> 00:43:44,865
for a second, so I can pull up my other notes document.

217
00:43:47,528 --> 00:43:51,311
Are there any initial reactions, questions, or sections that we should go back to?

218
00:43:51,331 --> 00:43:58,077
All right, I'll go to Councilor Lemming and then Councilor Baird.

219
00:43:59,258 --> 00:43:59,478
Oh, wait.

220
00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:01,840
I went to you first, go ahead.

221
00:44:02,361 --> 00:44:03,081
Okay, I'll be quick.

222
00:44:03,261 --> 00:44:03,642
Yeah.

223
00:44:05,662 --> 00:44:15,068
take the comments that you identified as decision points and put them in kind of like a top line such decision points document for to guide us in the future.

224
00:44:15,088 --> 00:44:17,269
That would be amazing.

225
00:44:17,309 --> 00:44:17,749
Thank you.

226
00:44:17,929 --> 00:44:27,255
And then my only other question is who from city staff or boards and commissions do you think we should follow up with to have a meeting with them about this?

227
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:38,326
PDS certainly, Director Hunt and I think Planner Evans, I believe, have both been in our meetings on this in the past.

228
00:44:38,346 --> 00:44:39,207
They were super helpful.

229
00:44:39,227 --> 00:44:40,608
I think they should definitely be looped in.

230
00:44:41,128 --> 00:44:42,369
Building Commissioner certainly.

231
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:47,352
And former Commissioner Forty was really helpful a couple years ago when he was still on staff.

232
00:44:47,972 --> 00:44:51,114
In addition to that, I think that it would be really helpful to have the

233
00:44:52,787 --> 00:44:57,930
CDB chair looped in, as well as a representative from the Affordable Housing Trust.

234
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:09,736
Those would be my top four or five, and I'd be really happy to identify what I think are the main decision points and put them in a memo as suggestions for discussion for the next council.

235
00:45:11,077 --> 00:45:11,777
Great, thank you.

236
00:45:12,157 --> 00:45:12,437
Thanks.

237
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:17,660
Go ahead.

238
00:45:19,525 --> 00:45:22,487
Two things that were on my mind coming through this.

239
00:45:22,567 --> 00:45:26,750
The first is I understand that there was either a

240
00:45:28,166 --> 00:45:38,177
a bill and I didn't really follow, I didn't really track the status of it over the past two years regarding tenant right of first refusal going through the state house.

241
00:45:39,018 --> 00:45:46,585
So my first question is, how does that component of it interact with state law?

242
00:45:47,606 --> 00:45:50,409
And the second thing on my mind is,

243
00:45:51,390 --> 00:46:00,432
Do you have an idea from your research in other communities how busy the condo review board typically is?

244
00:46:00,752 --> 00:46:04,673
Just an order of magnitude, how many applications they receive a year.

245
00:46:04,693 --> 00:46:16,696
So if we made a dedicated board for this, would they be the people that are listed out in section four, would they be meeting once a year?

246
00:46:16,716 --> 00:46:19,517
Or would this be a once a month kind of a job?

247
00:46:21,749 --> 00:46:22,870
Yeah, that's a good question.

248
00:46:23,491 --> 00:46:29,417
Let me, just one second and I'll pull up notes that have a little bit of data on our past conversions.

249
00:46:29,497 --> 00:46:29,937
One second.

250
00:46:37,585 --> 00:46:39,006
It wasn't in the document I thought it was in.

251
00:46:40,828 --> 00:46:42,590
Okay, I think that's a really good question.

252
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:45,293
I can't speak to how busy other,

253
00:46:47,112 --> 00:47:09,785
Communities condo review boards are but my impression is that this should be more similar to the CDB model of having a standing meeting every month that it is to a yearly Kind of arrangement and that's not because I think that there will be that's not at all because I think there will be that many permits but rather in the same vein as we want to be able to be Expeditiously working through business permits when they come before the council.

254
00:47:09,825 --> 00:47:10,545
We don't want to have

255
00:47:12,515 --> 00:47:15,478
sellers or owners waiting too long for their hearing.

256
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:24,447
Former PDS intern put together some research on condo conversions in Medford from 2018 to 2022 and I will

257
00:47:26,411 --> 00:47:31,633
give a pretty big caveat that she said at the time, it's hard to find this data because we're not tracking it.

258
00:47:31,673 --> 00:47:35,555
So it was a little bit squishy, not as clear as we would like it to be.

259
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:44,860
But the number of conversions per our registry of deeds were around 24 for 2018, 30 the next year, 29 for 2020, 37 in 2021, 33 in 2022.

260
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,120
I interpret that as being really not a deluge.

261
00:47:54,565 --> 00:48:01,951
for the review board and also like not a huge amount for the city in general, at least at that time.

262
00:48:01,991 --> 00:48:10,498
Though, of course, I think that there may be a lot of conversions that were perhaps recorded differently or maybe not, perhaps not showing up in the data at all.

263
00:48:13,501 --> 00:48:21,267
But I picture this as more of a CDB level workload or at least the CDB of two years ago level workload.

264
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:38,048
Did you have any, do you know anything about the state law portion of it?

265
00:48:38,969 --> 00:48:39,770
Oh right, sorry.

266
00:48:42,014 --> 00:48:44,597
And you were speaking about the state law pertaining to tenant right to purchase?

267
00:48:45,888 --> 00:48:46,308
Yeah.

268
00:48:46,328 --> 00:48:46,529
Yeah.

269
00:48:46,569 --> 00:48:47,649
The right of first refusal.

270
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:49,910
I'm just vaguely remembering that.

271
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:55,693
I haven't read the Acts of 1983 that you're referencing, so I'm not sure if it's spelled out there.

272
00:48:56,114 --> 00:49:11,982
But I do remember that this was one of the points of activism around the time that the Affordable Homes Act was being discussed, was passing the ability of cities to implement tenant right of first refusal.

273
00:49:13,973 --> 00:49:16,274
kind of lost track of where that debate was going.

274
00:49:17,294 --> 00:49:17,475
Sure.

275
00:49:17,975 --> 00:49:23,337
I think actually what was challenged locally was the city right of first refusal, but I think President Behrs, if you might have something on this.

276
00:49:27,398 --> 00:49:31,480
Yes, yeah, the bill at the Statehouse was about tenants regardless of conversion.

277
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:38,002
The Acts of 1983 allows this specifically for condo conversion, so that's the difference.

278
00:49:38,102 --> 00:49:38,583
Okay.

279
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:38,803
Yeah.

280
00:49:39,063 --> 00:49:39,143
Yep.

281
00:49:40,905 --> 00:49:46,929
I do think it's important to note in Somerville, the city's right of first refusal was actually struck down.

282
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:52,212
That's still in this draft because I knew this draft was going to be amended anyway.

283
00:49:52,692 --> 00:49:56,214
And I think that the city should have a first or second right of refusal.

284
00:49:57,095 --> 00:50:04,239
But that is something that if it stays in this draft, I'm sure that the city's lawyers will advise us that it's likely to be deemed illegal.

285
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:05,940
Got it.

286
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:30,474
Just one other thing that I will note for this preliminary discussion is another major point of discussion and point of comparison in some other communities ordinances is if certain types of buildings should be exempted.

287
00:50:31,035 --> 00:50:34,898
And there are lots of other exemptions in this ordinance for various things, you know, like we talked about.

288
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:44,883
extension of first rate of refusal to tenants is exempted for owners who are planning to sell or convey to family members.

289
00:50:47,704 --> 00:50:53,727
In other communities, small buildings are exempted.

290
00:50:56,728 --> 00:50:59,129
For example, oh, wait, sorry.

291
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:03,631
Sorry, I have to start that sentence over.

292
00:51:08,047 --> 00:51:20,343
In some other communities 2 and 3 unit buildings are actually exempted from the entire ordinance because it is more obviously it goes without saying it's more common for owner occupants to be converting 2 or 3 unit buildings that they might live close to or live inside of.

293
00:51:23,508 --> 00:51:26,831
I don't necessarily think that that's an appropriate starting place for Medford.

294
00:51:27,071 --> 00:51:33,716
We're seeing a lot of non-local money purchasing duplexes and three-family units.

295
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:45,765
I think that there are lots of other ways that we can tailor the provisions of the ordinance to make it fair for owner-occupants without exempting smaller buildings from the ordinance and its protections for tenants entirely.

296
00:51:52,131 --> 00:52:00,355
In addition, and this is something that I'd be happy to put in the memo for the future council to deliberate on, depending on how creative we want to get.

297
00:52:00,916 --> 00:52:03,297
Other communities have dealt with this in interesting ways.

298
00:52:03,397 --> 00:52:13,922
For example, in Malden, conversions of two and three unit buildings are prevented, except the vacancy rate is in excess of a certain percentage.

299
00:52:13,942 --> 00:52:21,206
And that's another way of kind of increasing the complication of the regulations and making it more responsive to what the housing market actually looks like that particular year.

300
00:52:24,842 --> 00:52:31,066
But for now, this draft does not exempt any buildings on the sole basis of size or number of units.

301
00:52:31,746 --> 00:52:43,393
And I think that that's appropriate for it to stay that way, especially since we've been seeing so many smaller buildings of two or three units being converted and flipped, especially in those neighborhoods that we talked about earlier.

302
00:52:55,193 --> 00:52:56,894
Any, go ahead.

303
00:52:58,795 --> 00:52:58,995
Great.

304
00:53:01,116 --> 00:53:17,343
I would move that we keep the paper in committee pending the memo from Vice President Collins and invite our Planning Development and Sustainability Director and staff and Building Commissioner to a future meeting in this committee on this draft ordinance.

305
00:53:25,187 --> 00:53:25,427
Great.

306
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:29,128
On the motion by Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Lemming.

307
00:53:29,808 --> 00:53:30,769
Mr. Clerk, when you're ready.

308
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:39,731
Councilor Lemming.

309
00:53:39,751 --> 00:53:43,172
Yes.

310
00:53:43,192 --> 00:53:43,952
President Behrs.

311
00:53:44,052 --> 00:53:44,292
Yes.

312
00:53:47,553 --> 00:53:48,594
Vice President Collins.

313
00:53:48,914 --> 00:53:49,094
Yes.

314
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:51,414
Councilor Kelly.

315
00:53:52,475 --> 00:53:53,595
Councilor Kelly is absent.

316
00:53:54,448 --> 00:53:55,308
Councilor Scarpelli.

317
00:53:56,609 --> 00:53:57,970
Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

318
00:54:01,692 --> 00:54:01,912
Great.

319
00:54:01,992 --> 00:54:02,292
Thank you.

320
00:54:02,653 --> 00:54:04,093
Three in favor, two absent.

321
00:54:04,113 --> 00:54:04,854
The motion passes.

322
00:54:05,714 --> 00:54:10,477
Are there any final comments, questions or motions from my fellow councilors?

323
00:54:11,618 --> 00:54:15,400
I'm on already.

324
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:16,380
There you go.

325
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,842
I just wanted to be recognized by the chair.

326
00:54:18,942 --> 00:54:19,302
Thank you.

327
00:54:20,431 --> 00:54:28,398
Chair Collins for not only your leadership on this ordinance, but your astute leadership of this committee for the past two years.

328
00:54:29,279 --> 00:54:38,666
Your presence at the chair of this committee will be missed by all of us, especially those of us who have to serve on the committee next.

329
00:54:38,727 --> 00:54:42,630
So we are so thankful.

330
00:54:44,792 --> 00:54:45,552
I'll speak for myself.

331
00:54:45,772 --> 00:54:48,655
I'm so thankful for your leadership and

332
00:54:49,383 --> 00:54:54,753
everything that you brought to this council and to this committee as its chair this term.

333
00:54:56,095 --> 00:54:56,356
Thank you.

334
00:55:03,656 --> 00:55:04,416
I wish you could stay.

335
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:06,217
I wish you were staying here.

336
00:55:08,619 --> 00:55:14,082
It's such a loss having you not lead this committee.

337
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:20,426
I mean, you have accomplished so much in your time on Medford City Council.

338
00:55:21,046 --> 00:55:26,389
You have served the city so well, and I know we'll be getting into this in the

339
00:55:27,055 --> 00:55:30,896
in the regular meeting, but thank you very much.

340
00:55:31,557 --> 00:55:32,897
Thank you so much for your service.

341
00:55:32,977 --> 00:55:49,183
It's been a very difficult job, both in the meetings, behind the scenes, and just in your own life, leading us through all that's happened over the past term in this committee.

342
00:55:49,223 --> 00:55:54,305
I've learned so much from you, and I'm grateful that I know you.

343
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:59,962
Yeah, thank you, thank you very much and I motion to adjourn.

344
00:56:01,923 --> 00:56:02,483
Thank you very much.

345
00:56:03,984 --> 00:56:05,124
All right, on the motion to adjourn.

346
00:56:06,605 --> 00:56:08,926
Wait, we can do roll call, right.

347
00:56:10,527 --> 00:56:11,608
I mean not roll call, the other one.

348
00:56:13,729 --> 00:56:15,550
Yeah, it's been a long time since I chaired this committee.

349
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:19,832
Sorry Rich, like I get one final annoyance from my colleagues.

350
00:56:22,063 --> 00:56:22,684
All in favor?

351
00:56:22,704 --> 00:56:23,545
Aye.

352
00:56:23,685 --> 00:56:24,266
All opposed?

353
00:56:24,867 --> 00:56:25,528
Motion passes.

354
00:56:25,628 --> 00:56:26,129
Meeting adjourned.

355
00:56:26,169 --> 00:56:26,729
Thank you very much.

356
00:56:26,749 --> 00:56:29,733
Thank you.

357
00:56:30,314 --> 00:56:30,795
No, thank you.
