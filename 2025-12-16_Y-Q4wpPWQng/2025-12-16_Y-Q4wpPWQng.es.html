    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=988.883s">[Kit Collins]</a>:  Present.
 Three present, two absent.
 The meeting is called to order.
 Thank you all for being here.
 People were clamoring for one final planning and permitting committee meeting before we closed out this term, so I had to oblige.
 The action and discussion item, thank you for laughing, Simon.
 The action discussion item for tonight's meeting is paper 22-321, a condominium conversion ordinance.
 This is something that we have not talked about in a little while.
 It's been on the council's radar for a couple of terms now.
 This was brought up in the context, initially this was brought up as an idea before the council in the context of one of the mass displacement events in Medford in recent years when a couple dozen tenants were evicted, no fault, from the Bradley Road rental building.
 In 2022, this is brought up as one possible strategy that Medford could look into as a strategy that many municipalities have pursued as a way of protecting the stock of rental units within a city.
 There are many strategies that have to work together to preserve affordable housing and to preserve rental housing stock within a municipality.
 This is one that actually many of our neighbors here in Massachusetts
 have used and have adapted and have adapted to fit their unique needs.
 And so in 2022, we had a couple of initial meetings on this idea.
 We gathered and looked at together some initial research, compared what some of our neighbors do and don't do through their condo conversion ordinances.
 and put together a framework from which we would make a draft ordinance in those couple preliminary meetings which were in March and September of 2023.
 Like I said, we looked at kind of a survey of some other municipalities, condo conversion ordinances, compared and contrasted them, and also got some initial reactions and questions on the board from our planning development sustainability department and our building commissioner.
 So what we have today, and this is in the agenda packet, is a preliminary kind of version one draft of a condo conversion ordinance, which I wrote.
 The text did not just come out of my head.
 This came from several, this was adapted from
 several of the different condo conversion ordinances that are currently on the books in many of our, in some of our neighboring communities, who we looked at, who we looked to as examples at the September 2023 meeting and discussed and it kind of comes out of our conversation from about a year and a half ago about what of these neighboring communities ordinances make sense and seems like it's interesting and seems like it's something that'd be worth looking into here in Medford and which of these things seem like they're less tailored for a community like ours.
 So I'm happy to run through that draft tonight, but just quickly since it has been a while since we've looked at this, I just want to quickly recenter us on kind of the principles of this ordinance and the why of doing it at all.
 Why do a condo conversion ordinance?
 This is, like I said, it's just one strategy, but it's a way of making sure that the city has more control and has a seat at the table when the conversion of rental units to condominiums happens in a city.
 And we know that in Medford, that's already been happening quite a lot, especially in Hillside and South Medford.
 A condo conversion provides a really fantastic profit opportunity for for-profit developers and for house flippers.
 And we've seen this, but especially if corporations and for-profit flippers that aren't rooted here in Medford, that kind of have no business in Medford except for extracting property from these conversions.
 If they're going to profit from housing in our community, we should make sure that that transaction gives something back to our community as well, to individual tenants who are displaced.
 and to the public at large and the ordinance provides a structure for doing that.
 In addition it's important to keep in mind as we're thinking through the levers in this ordinance that the conversion of rentals into condos has an impact on our chances of local racial and class diversity because not everybody can afford to buy a home.
 It's very important to have homes for the
 I think over 45% of Medford that does rent at this time.
 Anyway, this is a way to make sure that the public gets something back when what is often a mechanism of gentrification takes place.
 So with this ordinance, it's up to us to, you know, kind of pull the different levers to make this do what we want it to do in my mind and based on the conversations that we've had about this so far in council.
 The outcomes that we intend to get out of this ordinance are to target for-profit developers,
 while protecting homeowners and while protecting the retirement incomes of seniors in our community, to increase tenant protections, to increase the city's ability to connect displaced tenants with new comparable affordable housing, to make sure that relocation payments, compensation to displaced tenants aligns with the true cost of moving within our community, and to increase the incentives and the assistance to owners or condo developers
 to help with finding new housing for their tenants.
 And so as we go through the ordinance, I think the key questions for us to be considering and, you know, happy to add to this list are how do we make sure that we're targeting for-profit developers and flippers as opposed to owner-occupants?
 How what does that relate to a certain type or size of building that we should make sure to target or be sure to exempt?
 And what are the key enforcement related issues that we should make sure to get feedback from city staff on?
 So with that, if there are no pressing comments or questions from my fellow Councilors at this time, I'd happily run us quickly through the draft of the ordinance and then we can go forward.
 Proceed?
 I'll share my screen.
 All right, I'm going to try to go through this pretty quickly because it is quite long.
 This draft, including the comments, is on the city council's public portal for if anybody watching would like to follow along or read it in greater detail that I'm going to go into.
 So like I said, prior to the writing of this draft, the council reviewed several condo conversion ordinances from other communities in Massachusetts.
 This included Somerville, Boston, New Bedford, Lexington, and Marlborough.
 Based on my notes from our conversations in 2023, it seemed like our most instructive examples, the things that were closely aligned with the mechanisms that we might want to pursue.
 And most comparable and useful for us here in Medford would be Somerville's ordinance and Marlborough's ordinance.
 And there are some sections that are kind of adapted from those other communities as well.
 Boston tends to be pretty unique.
 It interacts pretty uniquely with state law in a lot of cases, but still really interesting to look at.
 So we start, I'm just going to run through this quickly.
 We start with the statement of purpose, which is kind of what I spoke to in terms of the housing context for this project in general.
 It's followed by a definitions section.
 These definitions align with the other ordinance, the other condo conversion ordinances that are held by our neighbors.
 Then we get to section three, condominium conversion requirements.
 Actually, let me just switch my navigation here.
 This is where we get into the meat of the ordinance this is speaking to.
 Okay, so we've gotten to the point where a condo conversion, a developer or an owner wants that to happen.
 Now what?
 So this is,
 This is where we start to get into that flowchart of what a developer might want to do with their property and what the city is saying must happen to increase fairness for tenants and the community in that case.
 Provisions for vacant units or owner-occupied units.
 These are treated a little bit differently.
 In this case, we don't have a tenant unrelated to the owner that might be displaced by the conversion.
 occupied units, this sets forth, sorry I'm losing my place here.
 So largely this is about how much notice is an owner required to give to a tenant when they intend to take a rental unit and convert it into a condominium.
 This was one major point of comparison among the other ordinances.
 Most of the other communities that we looked at give protected tenants a five year notice period and an either one or three year notice period for all other tenants.
 If you are a protected tenant, so for example, if you have a disability, if you are a senior, if you are low income, your notice period is five years.
 All other tenants, three years of notice.
 That's how long the owner has to give you a warning when they're about to take that rental off the market because they're going to perform a conversion.
 Renting units during a conversion, this is, this section is speaking to tenants' rights while they are kind of going through a current lease when an owner is preparing for conversion.
 And it speaks to essentially protecting tenants from the conditions of their lease changing while they're still in that same current lease.
 The intent of this is to prevent owners from doing things that would essentially try to force their tenants out early by, say, increasing the rent drastically or increasing demands on the tenant during their current lease so that they could make the conversion earlier.
 So this prevents that from happening.
 It also prevents evictions before the notice period, as specified earlier in this section, would be up.
 Tenant right to purchase was another stipulation that we saw in many other condominium conversion ordinances.
 This puts forward that when a owner wants to convert a unit that is currently occupied by a tenant, before they put it on the market, they must extend to the tenant like first right of refusal.
 Before they put it out to the general public, they have to offer it first to the tenant.
 on equal or comparable terms to that which they would be offering it on the free market.
 Most of the other examples that we looked at gave that first right of refusal period as 120 days to average tenants and 180 days refusal period in the case of protected tenants.
 We also have a section in here and this is interesting, something that I think the council should talk about further at some point is if a tenant should pass on this opportunity to purchase the unit once it is converted, that first, that's actually a second right of refusal would then go to the city of Medford or its designee which might include our affordable housing trust to maintain the property as affordable housing in perpetuity.
 And then it would be up to the city or its designee to waive that right to purchase and then it could go on to the market.
 I do want to note and make really clear.
 that this does not obligate any owner to sell the unit for less than it would be offering in good faith to third parties on the market.
 It's more about the sequence here, giving the tenant the first right to say no thank you, and after that, giving the municipality or its designee the right to say no thank you before it goes on the market.
 There are exceptions to the first right of refusal.
 including if they intend to transfer the condo to a close relative instead of offering it on the market.
 That would be an instance where first right of refusal to the tenant or to the city would be exempted.
 The intent of the ordinance is not to prevent people from converting units and then selling or giving it to a family member.
 going down to the next section underneath requirements if a condo conversion is going to take place.
 The other major piece of, or I would say one of the main pillars of the ordinance, of course, is increasing tenants' rights in the event of a condo conversion of a unit where they're living and also making sure that they are fairly compensated for the disruptions to their life as a result of that conversion.
 One of the ways that cities can do that is by making sure that
 tenants are financially compensated when they're displaced by a conversion.
 And so all of the condo conversion ordinances that we looked at from those other municipalities included some level of relocation payment.
 This is a way of making the tenant whole because they're being forced to move because of the conversion, whereas they otherwise wouldn't have had to.
 So in terms of the actual payment, the financial compensation, we looked at a bunch of different numbers from these other communities.
 The relocation benefit of $10,000 per unit for protected tenants and $6,000 per unit for all other tenants aligns us with the city of Somerville and how they are structuring their relocation payments.
 They're much higher in Boston.
 That makes sense.
 The cost of living is much higher in most parts of Boston.
 Boston's relocation payments are more like $15,000 for protected tenants and $10,000 for all other tenants.
 New Bedford and Marlboros are far lower.
 But again, I think that one of our north stars here is trying to make sure that it does what it's intended to do, and that's to make tenants whole based on the actual cost of moving and finding comparable housing after displacement.
 There's also an annual adjustment mechanism in here to make sure that we don't
 codify one relocation payment that in 10 or 20 years is vastly out of step with how much it actually does cost to move and resettle.
 So this draft includes language that is similar to what's found in other ordinances, that it shall be adjusted annually by an amount equal to the increase in the CPI for the preceding calendar year, just to make sure that this increases with inflation.
 Another way that this ordinance seeks to
 assist tenants with that displacement caused by the conversion is with actual housing and relocation assistance by the owner.
 The owner under this is entitled to assist the tenant with finding housing within the city of Medford that is comparable, that is not far more expensive or radically different that would essentially satisfy the needs that the current unit was satisfying for them.
 There's an interesting exemption in here essentially for owners who have gone above and beyond in terms of affordability.
 keeping their rent levels in line with MHA Section 8 payment standards, or limiting rent increases to no more than 5% per year.
 They are kind of given deference during this housing relocation assistance process, knowing that the rest of the housing market has been escalating far more rapidly than they allowed their unit to escalate, and this takes that into account.
 Essentially, we want to set homeowners up for, or owners and sellers up for success, not for failure.
 And this next section is kind of an extension of saying during the notice period when tenants are continuing to live at the unit during that notice period, the rental unit, the rental agreement is extended and it has to be comparable to the rental agreement that was signed prior to the beginning of the notice period.
 Again, not giving owners the ability to do any sort of bait and switch scheme to try to force tenants out early to speed up the conversion process.
 Subsection 8 goes over the administration and the regulation of conversions.
 Permits will be required for conversions and a sitting board within the city of Medford will do that process, administer those permits and make the necessary documentations.
 One second.
 I'm going to come back to permitting in a minute.
 Just to continue with the rest of the tenant rights and protections under this ordinance, it speaks to renovations to units during the notice period, again, protecting tenants from
 or super noisy or inconveniences due to renovations that the owner may be making to prepare for the conversion.
 Tenants still have to be able to enjoy a safe, quiet and peaceful home like anybody else.
 And the tenant does have the right to vacate their unit early before their lease period would expire, the notice period would expire should they choose to once the notice period has been given.
 So, excuse me.
 The next section sets up a condominium and cooperative review board in the city of Medford that will be the administrator of this ordinance and oversee the permitting process.
 And this is, I think, another interesting section for the city council and staff to review together.
 It was interesting looking at other ordinances, breakdown of who should sit on this board.
 My recommendation, based on that research in this draft, is for it to have seven full members and one alternate, which matches with a lot of our comparable communities.
 Staggered terms of three years each, and that the review board should include two homeowners.
 Nope, sorry, actually my total number I didn't update.
 Two homeowners, two tenants, at least one person that would fall into that protected class that might be a homeowner or a tenant, an elderly, disabled, or lower moderate income person.
 A representative from the CDB, a representative from the Affordable Housing Trust or Medford Housing Authority, and an alternate who may be either a homeowner or a tenant.
 And I think that actually does add up to seven people.
 If I can count and talk at the same time.
 This provides for an appointment process and an annual stipend, which is similar to that of the CDB.
 And it enumerates the board's duties and powers largely to enforce this ordinance.
 to create and make available the conversion permit applications to issue them to owners who want to do a conversion and who are compliant with the prerequisites found in this ordinance, to hear complaints from people who are alleging that this ordinance has been violated, to assist in a public awareness program about this ordinance, to establish fees for the issuing of permits,
 review the documentation of everything associated with this ordinance and condo conversions in Medford and to kind of keep a running list of those numbers, analyze the number of conversions in the city where they're taking place for the edification of the city and the city council.
 And then finally, the board retains the power to not issue a permit to any owner
 who has taken any action to circumvent mass general law chapter.
 527, which also deals with condo conversions or of this ordinance, including but not limited to unreasonable rent increases, reduction or elimination of services, termination of any tenancy without cause or the imposition of new conditions of the tenancy.
 Essentially, if a owner of a rental unit is being a really bad landlord, if they're doing shady things to try to vacate tenants in ways that are illegal, the board then has the discretion to not issue a conversion.
 if a pattern of that behavior is documented.
 And I just want to, speaking of powers and discretion granted to the board, this is a little bit earlier in section three.
 But just while we're on that topic, broadly owners in order to retain a conversion permit
 are required to comply with Chapter, Master and Rule of Chapter 527 of the Acts of 1983.
 And, sorry for pausing, I'm looking for something specific.
 Right, my apologies.
 In subsection seven.
 The board is permitted to make the conversion permit subject to reasonable conditions for the protection of tenants and the public interest of the city of Medford, including but not limited to these following factors.
 And this part is really important because this is the section of the ordinance that essentially says what is that kind of
 What's the word I'm looking for?
 How is the city allowed to make that decision of whether to issue a conversion permit or not?
 And different cities handle this differently and handle discretion of this differently.
 Some other cities that we looked at have a hard cap, like for example, in Marlborough.
 And per their ordinance, no more than 25% of units in a building per year may be converted from rental to conversion in other cities.
 Whether conversion permits are approved or not depends on the vacancy rate of units community wide, which I do think is a very interesting way to handle it.
 To essentially let the housing market and the vacancy rate be a guide on how many units are allowed to be taken out of the rental market.
 These are things for the city council to consider as we move forward.
 I did not include those hard caps in this draft.
 I don't know that that would be my recommendation.
 But some of the other factors and pieces of context from some of our neighbors I thought were useful.
 For example, when deciding whether to approve a permit or not, to consider the hardships imposed on the tenants residing in the accommodations proposed to be converted.
 The aggravation of the shortage of rental housing accommodations in the city.
 particularly for lower income people.
 What reasonable arrangements may have been made or will be made to alleviate the hardship on the tenants that might be affected by the conversion, and an intent by the owner to offer a reasonable percentage of the new conversions to sell to the Medford Housing Authority, Affordable Housing Trust, or another entity that will serve a similar function.
 So a lot of the same principles are at play here, but this leaves a little bit more discretion in the hands of the board to interpret hardship, to interpret the market, and to approve or deny permits based on those important pieces of context.
 So I will jump down again to, I think we're at section five now.
 Permitting process, this is the, lays out the steps that an owner with an intent to convert might go through.
 I'm not going to go through this in great detail.
 This provides details for if you want a permit to convert, here's how you do it.
 Here's the steps that you would take.
 The granting process, which would include, again, some administrative steps and some hearings before the board.
 And then if a permit were to expire before it is approved, steps that the owner must take to get a new one and restart the process.
 Effective date, I propose that the ordinance would take effect six months after passage.
 Give the city time to prepare, create the board, empower the board, and start that administrative process.
 Standard severability clause, annual reporting.
 The review board should submit to the city council building department and office of planning development and sustainability an annual report kind of summarizing what we have learned about conversions, their rate, where they're happening in the city because of this ordinance and penalties for violation.
 This was also adapted from other communities with condo conversion ordinances putting forth or actually this one was pulled directly from mass general law I believe.
 that any property owner who violates or knowingly permits a violation will be punished with a fine of not less than $1,000.
 With the final disclaimer that a violation of this ordinance by an owner will not affect or negatively impact its sale to a purchaser who is not involved in the violation and had no knowledge of it.
 I'm going to pause there.
 for a second, so I can pull up my other notes document.
 Are there any initial reactions, questions, or sections that we should go back to?
 All right, I'll go to Councilor Leming and then Councilor Bears.
 Oh, wait.
 I went to you first, go ahead.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2642.361s">[Zac Bears]</a>: Está bien, seré rápido.
 Sí.
 Tome los comentarios que identificó como puntos de decisión y colóquelos como una especie de documento de puntos de decisión en la primera línea para guiarnos en el futuro.
 Eso sería asombroso.
 Gracias.
 Y luego mi única otra pregunta es ¿con quién del personal de la ciudad o de las juntas y comisiones cree que deberíamos contactar para tener una reunión con ellos sobre esto?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2671.802s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Ciertamente, el PDS, el director Hunt y creo que el planificador Evans han estado en nuestras reuniones sobre esto en el pasado.
 Fueron muy útiles.
 Creo que definitivamente deberían incluirse.
 Comisionado de Construcción, sin duda.
 Y el ex comisionado Forty fue de gran ayuda hace un par de años, cuando todavía formaba parte del personal.
 Además de eso, creo que sería muy útil tener la
 Intervino el presidente del CDB, así como un representante del Affordable Housing Trust.
 Esos serían mis cuatro o cinco principales y estaría muy feliz de identificar cuáles creo que son los principales puntos de decisión y ponerlos en un memorando como sugerencias para discusión en el próximo consejo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2711.077s">[Zac Bears]</a>: Genial, gracias.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2712.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Gracias.
 Adelante.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2719.525s">[Matt Leming]</a>: Dos cosas que tenía en mente al pasar por esto.
 La primera es que entiendo que hubo una
 un proyecto de ley y realmente no lo seguí, realmente no hice un seguimiento de su estado durante los últimos dos años con respecto al derecho de preferencia del inquilino en la cámara estatal.
 Entonces mi primera pregunta es, ¿cómo interactúa ese componente con la ley estatal?
 Y lo segundo que tengo en mente es:
 ¿Tiene una idea, a partir de su investigación en otras comunidades, de lo ocupada que suele estar la junta de revisión de condominios?
 Sólo un orden de magnitud, cuántas solicitudes reciben al año.
 Entonces, si creáramos una junta dedicada a esto, ¿serían las personas que figuran en la sección cuatro y se reunirían una vez al año?
 ¿O sería este un trabajo que se realiza una vez al mes?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2781.749s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sí, esa es una buena pregunta.
 Permítanme solo un segundo y sacaré notas que tienen un poco de datos sobre nuestras conversiones pasadas.
 Un segundo.
 No estaba en el documento en el que pensé que estaba.
 Bien, creo que es una muy buena pregunta.
 No puedo hablar de lo ocupados que están los demás,
 Las juntas de revisión de condominios de las comunidades lo son, pero mi impresión es que esto debería ser más similar al modelo del CDB de tener una reunión permanente cada mes que a un tipo de acuerdo anual y eso no es porque creo que habrá, no es en absoluto porque creo que habrá tantos permisos, sino más bien en la misma línea en la que queremos poder trabajar rápidamente a través de los permisos comerciales cuando se presenten ante el consejo.
 No queremos tener
 vendedores o propietarios que esperan demasiado tiempo para su audiencia.
 El ex pasante de PDS realizó una investigación sobre conversiones de condominios en Medford de 2018 a 2022 y lo haré
 Haga una advertencia bastante importante que dijo en ese momento: es difícil encontrar estos datos porque no los estamos rastreando.
 Así que estaba un poco blando, no tan claro como nos gustaría que fuera.
 Pero el número de conversiones según nuestro registro de escrituras fue de alrededor de 24 para 2018, 30 el año siguiente, 29 para 2020, 37 en 2021, 33 en 2022.
 Lo interpreto como que en realidad no se trata de un diluvio.
 para la junta de revisión y tampoco es una cantidad enorme para la ciudad en general, al menos en ese momento.
 Aunque, por supuesto, creo que puede haber muchas conversiones que tal vez se registraron de manera diferente o tal vez no, tal vez no aparezcan en los datos en absoluto.
 Pero me imagino que esto es más bien una carga de trabajo a nivel del CDB o al menos la carga de trabajo a nivel del CDB de hace dos años.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2912.519s">[Matt Leming]</a>: ¿Tuviste alguno? ¿Sabes algo sobre la parte de la ley estatal?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2918.969s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Ah claro, lo siento.
 ¿Y usted estaba hablando de la ley estatal relativa al derecho de compra del inquilino?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2925.888s">[Matt Leming]</a>: Sí.
 Sí.
 El derecho de tanteo.
 Sólo lo recuerdo vagamente.
 No he leído las Leyes de 1983 a las que hace referencia, por lo que no estoy seguro de si están detalladas allí.
 Pero sí recuerdo que este fue uno de los puntos de activismo en la época en que se discutía la Ley de Viviendas Asequibles, cuando se aprobaba la capacidad de las ciudades para implementar el derecho de preferencia de los inquilinos.
 Como que perdí la noción de hacia dónde iba ese debate.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2957.294s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seguro.
 Creo que en realidad lo que se cuestionó a nivel local fue el derecho de preferencia de la ciudad, pero creo que, presidente Bears, si pudiera tener algo sobre esto.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2967.398s">[Zac Bears]</a>: Sí, sí, el proyecto de ley en la Cámara de Representantes se refería a los inquilinos independientemente de su conversión.
 Las Leyes de 1983 permiten esto específicamente para la conversión de condominios, así que esa es la diferencia.
 Bueno.
 Sí.
 Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-Q4wpPWQng&t=2980.905s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Creo que es importante señalar que en Somerville, el derecho de preferencia de la ciudad en realidad fue anulado.
 Eso todavía está en este borrador porque sabía que este borrador iba a ser modificado de todos modos.
 Y creo que la ciudad debería tener un primer o segundo derecho de negativa.
 Pero eso es algo que si permanece en este borrador, estoy seguro de que los abogados de la ciudad nos informarán que probablemente se considere ilegal.
 Entiendo.
 Otra cosa que señalaré para esta discusión preliminar es otro punto importante de discusión y punto de comparación en algunas ordenanzas de otras comunidades: si ciertos tipos de edificios deben estar exentos.
 Y hay muchas otras exenciones en esta ordenanza para varias cosas, ya sabes, como hablamos.
 La ampliación del primer tipo de denegación a los inquilinos está exenta para los propietarios que tengan previsto vender o traspasar a familiares.
 En otras comunidades, los edificios pequeños están exentos.
 Por ejemplo, oh, espera, lo siento.
 Lo siento, tengo que empezar esa frase de nuevo.
 En algunas otras comunidades, los edificios de 2 y 3 unidades en realidad están exentos de toda la ordenanza porque es más obvio, no hace falta decir que es más común que los propietarios ocupantes conviertan edificios de 2 o 3 unidades en los que podrían vivir cerca o dentro de ellos.
 No creo necesariamente que ese sea un punto de partida apropiado para Medford.
 Estamos viendo una gran cantidad de dinero no local que compra dúplex y unidades trifamiliares.
 Creo que hay muchas otras maneras en que podemos adaptar las disposiciones de la ordenanza para que sean justas para los propietarios-ocupantes sin eximir por completo a los edificios más pequeños de la ordenanza y sus protecciones para los inquilinos.
 Además, esto es algo que me encantaría incluir en el memorándum para que el futuro consejo delibere sobre ello, dependiendo de cuán creativos queramos ser.
 Otras comunidades han abordado esto de maneras interesantes.
 Por ejemplo, en Malden, se impiden las conversiones de edificios de dos y tres unidades, excepto que la tasa de desocupación exceda un cierto porcentaje.
 Y esa es otra forma de aumentar la complicación de las regulaciones y hacerlas más sensibles a cómo se ve realmente el mercado inmobiliario ese año en particular.
 Pero por ahora, este borrador no exime a ningún edificio únicamente por su tamaño o número de unidades.
 Y creo que es apropiado que siga así, especialmente porque hemos visto tantos edificios más pequeños de dos o tres unidades convertidos y remodelados, especialmente en los vecindarios de los que hablamos antes.
 Cualquiera, adelante.
 Excelente.</p>

 Presidente Collins no sólo por su liderazgo en esta ordenanza, sino también por su astuto liderazgo de este comité durante los últimos dos años.
 Todos extrañaremos su presencia como presidente de este comité, especialmente aquellos de nosotros que tenemos que servir en el comité a continuación.
 Por eso estamos muy agradecidos.
 Hablaré por mí mismo.
 Estoy muy agradecido por su liderazgo y

 Es una gran pérdida que usted no dirija este comité.
 Quiero decir, usted ha logrado mucho durante su tiempo en el Concejo Municipal de Medford.
 Usted ha servido muy bien a la ciudad y sé que abordaremos esto en el futuro.
 en la reunión ordinaria, pero muchas gracias.
 Muchas gracias por su servicio.
 Ha sido un trabajo muy difícil, tanto en las reuniones, entre bastidores y simplemente en su propia vida, guiarnos a través de todo lo que sucedió durante el último período en este comité.
 He aprendido mucho de ti y estoy agradecido de conocerte.
 Sí, gracias, muchas gracias y hago una moción para levantar la sesión.</p>

 Muy bien, sobre la moción de aplazar la sesión.
 Espera, podemos pasar lista, ¿verdad?
 Me refiero a no pasar lista, el otro.
 Sí, ha pasado mucho tiempo desde que presidí este comité.
 Lo siento Rich, como si recibiera una última molestia de mis colegas.
 ¿Todos a favor?
 Sí.
 ¿Todos en contra?
 El movimiento pasa.
 Se levantó la sesión.
 Muchas gracias.
 Gracias.
 No, gracias.</p>
