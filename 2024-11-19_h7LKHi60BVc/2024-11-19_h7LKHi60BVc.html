    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=278.565s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=282.338s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=283.319s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, bring this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=286.221s">Chief</a>  has been a rock here in the community for so many years and now I can publicly say my dream is to, when I grow up, is to be like Chief Gilberti, hoping to get hair plugs, lose some weight and go to the tanning beds and <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=303.839s">And</a>  we could say this publicly now, can we please get the new chief Friedman. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=307.783s">I</a>  know, I know, Chief Gilbert he had his, his, his city vehicle, which had the right the side to look really close. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=320.997s">It's</a>  a fire chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=324.029s">So</a>  I wanna get a nice big sign so everybody knows who our fire chief is. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=328.611s">No,</a>  but seriously, we appreciate all the hard work he's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=333.472s">I</a>  know it's not easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=334.433s">You</a>  can't make everybody happy 100% of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=338.994s">And</a>  I think chief had that balance to make sure that his department worked for the best interests of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=350.458s">And</a>  we appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=351.358s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=352.573s">Chair</a>  recognizes Council Member Morell.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=355.357s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=356.198s">I</a>  just want to echo my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=357.62s">I</a>  obviously didn't have the pleasure to work alongside the chief as long as everyone else did, but I thank him for his decades of service to the city, the residents, his firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=368.093s">I</a>  think in the short time I have had, <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=371.044s">been</a>  able to work with him and whether it's meetings here or events, he's always welcoming kind and available and that's really just an asset to everyone in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=378.572s">And</a>  I also echo my council colleagues in congratulating Deputy Chief Friedman on his elevation.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=387.08s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=390.163s">Similar</a>  to Councilor Morell I think <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=392.303s">you</a>  know, working with Chief Gilberti these past two years, he's been incredibly open, communicative, trying to let us know the needs of the department within the constraints that, you know, any department head is under. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=405.307s">But</a>  I think even more than that, the chief has been the chief more than 80% of my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=411.409s">And</a>  he's still here. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=412.91s">And</a>  I'm still here. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=414.33s">He's</a>  still here. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=416.511s">And,</a>  you know, I'll always remember, we had a <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=419.435s">weird</a>  electrical fire in one of our walls. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=421.697s">And</a>  I always remember the fire department coming down this quick, you know, very promptly getting an address, saving our home from what I'm sure would have been a disaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=432.205s">And</a>  I, you know, can't say enough about everything that our fire department does to keep our community safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=438.289s">So</a>  I think that's a testament to the chief and to deputy chief Friedman. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=442.292s">And</a>  I look forward to working with deputy chief Friedman when he becomes a chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=448.257s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=449.669s">If</a>  I may, from the chair, Chief Gilberti has become someone I've grown to admire. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=455.655s">I've</a>  always been <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=457.35s">very</a>  impressed with the way that he's handled the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=460.833s">And</a>  I think that in his retirement he should hold classes for the current department heads on how to answer questions at a budget session. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=469.099s">Chief</a>  Gilberti I think has the most direct responses out of any of our department heads here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=474.744s">Three</a>  words or less usually most of his answers are yes, no, maybe, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=479.267s">He's</a>  been great. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=479.968s">He's</a>  been great to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=481.909s">And</a>  he's going to be sorely missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=483.21s">He</a>  brings a lot of institutional knowledge to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=485.812s">His</a>  expertise in financing and firefighting is something that's unparalleled. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=489.975s">And</a>  I do wish him the best of luck in his retirement here in Massachusetts and down in sunny Florida. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=495.678s">And</a>  I also know with great faith that the city of Medford's in good hands with John Friedman behind the helm. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=503.283s">So</a>  with that being said, on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=508.085s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=509.066s">As</a>  amended by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=511.267s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=512.528s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=513.629s">Opposed.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=515.163s">The</a>  eyes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=517.524s">Show</a>  it's a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=522.367s">Motion</a>  by council this take papers in the hands of the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=526.149s">Second,</a>  because the cover yellow. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=527.269s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=529.751s">I</a>  opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=531.571s">I</a>  just have it under suspension in Council November 9 2021 Council paper 21615 on set by offered by Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=541.28s">Caraviello,</a>  be it resolved the Medford City Council receive an answer regarding the paving of South Street and Prescott Street Council Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=549.928s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, Mr. President done. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=552.069s">As</a>  you know, we've been struggling with this ever source project for going on four or five years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=559.893s">And</a>  with the paving so I think many of us have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=564.835s">I</a>  think we, we went a little bit dodging the manhole covers all over Mr. gab we got that paved. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=571.797s">Now,</a>  we're still dodging manhole covers on South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=577.218s">The</a>  neighbors have received a letter that this street was supposed to have been paid a month ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=584.94s">As</a>  of today there's still no paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=589.892s">I</a>  think, as we all know, as the weather gets colder, the asphalt plants will be closing down soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=595.195s">So</a>  are we going to wait until the asphalt plant closes down and we buy asphalt of serious standard, just the kind they use to do patchwork, or is this going to get done in a reasonable amount of time? <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=610.692s">Again,</a>  we have one of the neighbors here that lives on South Street, and they say, these neighbors have been promised this for going on a while now. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=619.535s">They</a>  say they were a month overdue.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=623.117s">Would</a>  you like to?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=624.617s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=625.057s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=625.177s">Well,</a>  I'll say, again, we'd like to get an update in when this pavement is going to get done on South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=631.4s">Never</a>  mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=632.56s">And</a>  if you go to Prescott Street, they've dug up streets over there with trenches, and they didn't even patch them. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=640.494s">They</a>  filled them in with dirt. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=642.436s">Again,</a>  we're gonna wait till the plane closes, and we're gonna be using the winter mix that lasts about a month, and then it's gone again. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=651.303s">I</a>  mean, there's not even anybody down there working anymore on Prescott Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=656.327s">In</a>  fact, I had a call to the engineer last week, because during all that rain, there was a hole that you can drive your car fell into. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=665.058s">So</a>  again, these are projects that, this Eversource project is never gonna end, ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=672.624s">I</a>  mean, it's just going, and you say, now that, I mean, they're still digging in front of the police station now every night, and you're seeing plates and plates, and now we're getting the complaints from the neighbors as the plates have moved down on that end now. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=689.779s">I</a>  say, I would think at some point, we need to get Eversource in here, <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=695.083s">and</a>  figure out where they're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=696.124s">I</a>  mean, they're going a couple of feet a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=700.469s">This</a>  project isn't going anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=702.15s">We're</a>  probably another two years away from this project getting done. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=706.634s">So</a>  I would make a motion that we have a community of the whole meeting with the Eversource officials, whether it be, I think it's Robin Collins, she's the project manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=718.975s">to</a>  get somebody in here at the committee hall to discuss where the project is going and have the engineer reach out to the people doing the work on Prescott Street by the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=730.503s">Get</a>  your hand out of his back, Zach.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=760.311s">I</a>  don't know who's doing Prescott Street, but I haven't seen them down there in a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=766.415s">I</a>  think it is McCabe. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=767.236s">I'm</a>  not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=768.357s">But</a>  again, they've dug trenches there, and all they do is fill them in with gravel. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=774.301s">And</a>  they're coming up now.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=781.962s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=783.283s">I</a>  want to thank President Caraviello for putting this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=788.689s">You</a>  know, when we talk about Eversource, I think no one can refute that Winthrop Street was heavily impacted by all the construction over the last several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=799.859s">And</a>  another street that comes to mind is Salt Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=802.682s">South</a>  Street has really borne the brunt of not only ever source but other projects, Mr. President, over the last several years, and they. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=812.231s">deserve</a>  some peace and quiet on that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=814.873s">So</a>  the quicker they can pave that area and give these residents a break, I'm all in support of that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=821.358s">So</a>  I would hope the administration gets a wind of this and immediately acts, Mr. President, before, as President Caraviello mentioned, before the weather gets too inclement for any type of road pavements. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=835.49s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=851.066s">I</a>  would say we'd have the project manager from Episodes come down along with our city engineer and DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=858.652s">And</a>  maybe our city solicitor to find out what our legal ramifications are. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=864.436s">As</a>  I say, this project's gonna be going on for another two more years at the pace they're going, if not longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=869.569s">Stop</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=902.214s">Probably</a>  in the chimney.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=915.148s">Okay,</a>  if we can't to go back to that I think that it's important I'm going to hop on this until we find some sort of resolution I think it's important that we have a clerk of the works. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=925.713s">That's</a>  really reporting back to the city when we talk about these, these huge, huge inconvenience <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=933.958s">wrote</a>  the roadwork that's going on again. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=936.581s">If</a>  we have someone there on site every day something's going to get done something's going to be reported to the right people because there's definitely a disconnect, and I think that who's paying the price up and down Winthrop Street not the South Street and no council mark said it but <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=950.798s">You</a>  know this, it's no different than the rattling of the plates, you know, it's, I've talked to a few neighbors in Winchester, and I said geez I said do you have the same concerns with the rattle and plates, and they say no that was one of the first initiatives I talked to them about making sure that every time they drop those plates. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=967.188s">It</a>  was an enough of a buffer to make sure that didn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=971.25s">But</a>  you travel and traverse right over the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=974.033s">And</a>  it seems like the slap in the face keeps coming back with these huge companies like Eversource and National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=981.82s">So</a>  I appreciate the welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=986.364s">I</a>  think we need every department there that's possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=989.327s">And</a>  we need to make sure that we have a watchdog moving forward that's representing the city to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=996.664s">Everything</a>  that that person will say from Eversource is held accountable, because if you remember the first meeting we had at Eversource, remember everyone? <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1005.031s">The</a>  gentleman came up and he had a plan, and this is great, they're gonna put door signs, and everybody, this is my cell phone number, people call me, remember how great that was? <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1015.619s">I</a>  have yet to hear from that, that man disappeared. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1019.302s">It</a>  was a figment of our imagination, because there has been no communication, no support from Eversource. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1024.406s">And</a>  again, <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1025.868s">We</a>  know we had no power control to allow them in. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1029.569s">We</a>  heard that a thousand times, but we also heard that we would get the support and the people would have, somebody would hear a voice that when something needed to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1040.572s">And</a>  I'm just so disappointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1042.532s">I'll</a>  say this to the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1045.213s">This</a>  is what we hear every day, roads, sidewalks, and a lot has to do with our, <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1054.464s">our</a>  partnerships with Eversource and National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1057.707s">So</a>  I'm pretty disgusted. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1059.568s">I</a>  appreciate Council President bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1061.41s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1062.17s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Peco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1063.671s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1064.392s">I</a>  also want to thank Council President Capriolo for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1069.116s">I</a>  know I've been on the Council for six years and pretty much this started six years ago and it still drags on today. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1079.278s">And</a>  this needs to be addressed, this is absolutely these are quality of life issues that need to be addressed in every single day the residents are residents throughout the community are impacted, but especially the residents that live. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1091.586s">In</a>  and along that route of where the constructions taking place, I mean, if you take a look at the construction in surrounding communities it's been definitely been managed differently than it's been managed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1103.828s">And</a>  I definitely would agree with President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1107.671s">There</a>  needs to be a meeting, Committee of the Whole meeting sooner than later on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1111.653s">And</a>  I would ask that when the meeting is held or when it's scheduled, if we could send a robo-call to everyone that lives on this route. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1119.979s">The</a>  residents need to be involved in this and the questions should be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1125.242s">I</a>  think everyone wants to know when is this finally going to be finished? <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1131.258s">The</a>  other source project is gonna last my tenure on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1135.86s">I</a>  mean, really, it's ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1137.7s">It's</a>  been going on for six years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1139.861s">That's</a>  just unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1141.641s">It</a>  needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1143.702s">It</a>  needs to be managed. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1144.702s">I</a>  don't think it's being managed properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1146.783s">And</a>  I would ask that all of the residents along the route be notified of this meeting so they can have their questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1154.986s">And</a>  if we could schedule this as soon as possible, I greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1158.887s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1160.089s">Chair,</a>  Mr. Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1161.37s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1162.631s">And</a>  I'll be as quick as I can on this, but I just want to drive home the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1166.814s">When</a>  we're talking about the plates, when we're talking about the paving schedule, we're talking about any of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1172.119s">There</a>  were plates 300 yards up the street a year ago, and we said, can you make them not be so loud that people can't sleep at night? <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1178.724s">It's</a>  recurring. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1179.285s">You</a>  know, we are going back. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1180.245s">It's</a>  a recurring problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1181.286s">I</a>  think Clerk of the Works is one potential answer here. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1184.949s">And</a>  I'm totally supportive of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1187.311s">But</a>  at this point, <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1188.512s">when</a>  we're asking them to do something over and over again, they go and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1191.794s">And</a>  then the next time they go out to do something similar and they don't follow that instruction again, I just want to ask you in the form of an amendment, is there any sort of recourse we have with the department of public utilities, either for additional accountability on oversight from their end on projects like these are specifically on the ever source project. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1210.367s">And</a>  is there any compensation that the city's entitled to considering the impact that this has had <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1215.718s">and</a>  what I would call the negligence of the contractor working for this company. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1221.342s">Because</a>  basically I think to Councilor Scarpelli's point, it doesn't feel like a very public to me, not so public utilities in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1228.588s">These</a>  companies are just running roughshod and they're not accountable to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1231.71s">So</a>  if there's some recourse either through additional accountability that the state can come down, I think it's an addition to whatever we can do as a city in the long run to get these projects working. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1242.158s">And</a>  to be honest, I think <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1243.579s">you</a>  know, I'm sure that we're not entitled to compensation, but I'd at least like to ask because I think we deserve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1249.202s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1250.283s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1250.583s">And,</a>  um, you know, if you look at like the big, big, for example, you know, they had performance standards, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1254.485s">Where</a>  they said, if you don't meet these benchmarks, then you're going to pay us money. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1257.867s">Um,</a>  I think it might be time for us to start looking at the contracts that we're offering and, uh, seeing if that's an option.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1263.891s">They</a>  don't pay utility companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1266.673s">We</a>  went through that with the state, with the fast 14 project, with the bridge, they will not pay.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1271.475s">Right.</a> </p>
