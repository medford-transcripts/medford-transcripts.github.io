19

[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to order is a resolution to 1610 water by President Gabrielle, the result of it that city council come in to congratulate you, Frank Hilbert you for 23 years of 23 years as chief and 39 years in the play department when it's upcoming your time.

00:01:33,317 --> 00:01:38,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President, as you all know, Chief Gilbert, he will be retiring at the end of the month there.

21
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:48,741
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just wanted to recognize him for his 26 years of being being the chief of the city of Baffin and 39 years with our fire department.

22
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:54,342
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also like to recognize that the mayor was appointed john Freeman, excuse me, john

23
00:01:55,283 --> 00:02:02,627
[SPEAKER_05]: is our new chief and I want to welcome him as the new chief but I just want to talk about the chief for a few minutes.

24
00:02:03,468 --> 00:02:08,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, he's been a dedicated employee for almost 40 years.

25
00:02:09,771 --> 00:02:18,156
[SPEAKER_05]: He's overseen by department that said, you know, we've had building concerns everything and they'll do some difficult times here and

26
00:02:18,716 --> 00:02:32,682
[SPEAKER_05]: want to commend him for his work that he's done over the years and I think he's done his best to try to keep the buildings up as the best he could with the, with the budget that he had so I just wanted to commend him for that.

27
00:02:33,122 --> 00:02:44,466
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd like to maybe have him come here maybe next week to receive a citation from our city council chair recognizes Councilmarks.

28
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:46,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

29
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,907
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank President Caviello for putting this on the agenda.

30
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:55,253
[SPEAKER_06]: We all know this day was coming, Mr. President.

31
00:02:56,175 --> 00:03:01,739
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, Chief Gil Birdy served as chief for, as was mentioned, 26 years.

32
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, he led the fire department through some good and bad times.

33
00:03:05,682 --> 00:03:16,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr President, my only hope was that we could be talking about a brand new fire headquarters and revitalized fire stations throughout the community.

34
00:03:17,491 --> 00:03:18,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately,

35
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:20,306
[SPEAKER_06]: That is not the case, Mr. President.

36
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:42,718
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd like to thank Chief Gilberti for his many years of dedicated service to the residents of this community and the property of this community, and congratulate Deputy Chief John Friedman, Mr. President, who, in my opinion, will do a tremendous job in that role.

37
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:47,681
[SPEAKER_06]: He is well-liked by his colleagues, Mr. President,

38
00:03:48,241 --> 00:03:55,823
[SPEAKER_06]: He is someone that really fights for his fellow firefighters.

39
00:03:56,603 --> 00:04:14,107
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know he's interested, like the rest of us, about moving forward with getting a new headquarters, revamping our stations, and also, Mr. President, getting the training tower, which was promised to our firefighters back several years ago.

40
00:04:14,987 --> 00:04:15,967
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you, Mr. President.

41
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair recognizes Councilor Fevella.

42
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

43
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,821
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank President Carriello for bringing this forward tonight.

44
00:04:22,881 --> 00:04:29,243
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to thank Chief Gilberti for his many years of service and commitment to our community.

45
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:36,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Wish him well in his retirement and also congratulate Deputy Chief Freeman on his new position, his new role and wish him well.

46
00:04:37,224 --> 00:04:37,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

47
00:04:38,565 --> 00:04:40,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.

48
00:04:42,338 --> 00:04:43,239
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

49
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:45,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President, bring this forward.

50
00:04:46,221 --> 00:05:02,472
[SPEAKER_00]: Chief has been a rock here in the community for so many years and now I can publicly say my dream is to, when I grow up, is to be like Chief Gilberti, hoping to get hair plugs, lose some weight and go to the tanning beds and

51
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,002
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could say this publicly now, can we please get the new chief Friedman.

52
00:05:07,783 --> 00:05:20,436
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I know, Chief Gilbert he had his, his, his city vehicle, which had the right the side to look really close.

53
00:05:20,997 --> 00:05:22,038
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fire chief.

54
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:28,531
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanna get a nice big sign so everybody knows who our fire chief is.

55
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:33,412
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but seriously, we appreciate all the hard work he's done.

56
00:05:33,472 --> 00:05:34,293
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's not easy.

57
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:38,654
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't make everybody happy 100% of the time.

58
00:05:38,994 --> 00:05:50,298
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think chief had that balance to make sure that his department worked for the best interests of our community.

59
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,338
[SPEAKER_00]: And we appreciate that.

60
00:05:51,358 --> 00:05:51,778
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.

61
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:53,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Chair recognizes Council Member Morrell.

62
00:05:55,357 --> 00:05:56,118
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Vice President.

63
00:05:56,198 --> 00:05:57,559
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to echo my colleagues.

64
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:07,953
[SPEAKER_01]: I obviously didn't have the pleasure to work alongside the chief as long as everyone else did, but I thank him for his decades of service to the city, the residents, his firefighters.

65
00:06:08,093 --> 00:06:10,196
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in the short time I have had,

66
00:06:11,044 --> 00:06:17,911
[SPEAKER_01]: been able to work with him and whether it's meetings here or events, he's always welcoming kind and available and that's really just an asset to everyone in the city.

67
00:06:18,572 --> 00:06:26,820
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also echo my council colleagues in congratulating Deputy Chief Friedman on his elevation.

68
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

69
00:06:30,163 --> 00:06:31,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Similar to Councilor Morrell I think

70
00:06:32,303 --> 00:06:43,527
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, working with Chief Gilberti these past two years, he's been incredibly open, communicative, trying to let us know the needs of the department within the constraints that, you know, any department head is under.

71
00:06:45,307 --> 00:06:50,689
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think even more than that, the chief has been the chief more than 80% of my life.

72
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:52,670
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's still here.

73
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:53,970
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm still here.

74
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,031
[SPEAKER_07]: He's still here.

75
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,012
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I'll always remember, we had a

76
00:06:59,435 --> 00:07:01,597
[SPEAKER_07]: weird electrical fire in one of our walls.

77
00:07:01,697 --> 00:07:12,185
[SPEAKER_07]: And I always remember the fire department coming down this quick, you know, very promptly getting an address, saving our home from what I'm sure would have been a disaster.

78
00:07:12,205 --> 00:07:18,229
[SPEAKER_07]: And I, you know, can't say enough about everything that our fire department does to keep our community safe.

79
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:22,232
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's a testament to the chief and to deputy chief Friedman.

80
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:27,936
[SPEAKER_07]: And I look forward to working with deputy chief Friedman when he becomes a chief.

81
00:07:28,257 --> 00:07:28,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

82
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:35,575
[SPEAKER_08]: If I may, from the chair, Chief Gilberti has become someone I've grown to admire.

83
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:36,536
[SPEAKER_08]: I've always been

84
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,992
[SPEAKER_08]: very impressed with the way that he's handled the budget.

85
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:47,418
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that in his retirement he should hold classes for the current department heads on how to answer questions at a budget session.

86
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:54,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Chief Gilberti I think has the most direct responses out of any of our department heads here in the community.

87
00:07:54,744 --> 00:07:58,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Three words or less usually most of his answers are yes, no, maybe, I don't know.

88
00:07:59,267 --> 00:07:59,848
[SPEAKER_08]: He's been great.

89
00:07:59,968 --> 00:08:00,909
[SPEAKER_08]: He's been great to work with.

90
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:03,190
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's going to be sorely missed.

91
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,172
[SPEAKER_08]: He brings a lot of institutional knowledge to the table.

92
00:08:05,812 --> 00:08:09,494
[SPEAKER_08]: His expertise in financing and firefighting is something that's unparalleled.

93
00:08:09,975 --> 00:08:14,878
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do wish him the best of luck in his retirement here in Massachusetts and down in sunny Florida.

94
00:08:15,678 --> 00:08:22,602
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also know with great faith that the city of Medford's in good hands with John Friedman behind the helm.

95
00:08:23,283 --> 00:08:28,065
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, on the motion of Councilor Caviello, seconded by.

96
00:08:28,085 --> 00:08:28,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

97
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:30,487
[SPEAKER_08]: As amended by Councilor Caviello.

98
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:32,208
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor.

99
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:32,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

100
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:34,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Opposed.

101
00:08:35,163 --> 00:08:35,703
[SPEAKER_08]: The eyes have it.

102
00:08:37,524 --> 00:08:38,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Show it's a motion.

103
00:08:42,367 --> 00:08:44,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion by council this take papers in the hands of the clerk.

104
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:47,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Second, because the cover yellow.

105
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:49,410
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor.

106
00:08:49,751 --> 00:08:50,631
[SPEAKER_08]: I opposed.

107
00:08:51,571 --> 00:08:56,574
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have it under suspension in Council November 9 2021 Council paper 21615 on set by offered by counselor.

108
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:08,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Caravello, be it resolved the Memphis City Council receive an answer regarding the paving of South Street and Prescott Street Council Carville.

109
00:09:09,928 --> 00:09:11,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President, Mr President done.

110
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:18,295
[SPEAKER_05]: As you know, we've been struggling with this ever source project for going on four or five years now.

111
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:23,434
[SPEAKER_05]: And with the paving so I think many of us have been.

112
00:09:24,835 --> 00:09:30,976
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we, we went a little bit dodging the manhole covers all over Mr gab we got that paved.

113
00:09:31,797 --> 00:09:35,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, we're still dodging manhole covers on South Street.

114
00:09:37,218 --> 00:09:42,339
[SPEAKER_05]: The neighbors have received a letter that this street was supposed to have been paid a month ago.

115
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,500
[SPEAKER_05]: As of today there's still no paving.

116
00:09:49,892 --> 00:09:54,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, as we all know, as the weather gets colder, the asphalt plants will be closing down soon.

117
00:09:55,195 --> 00:10:09,102
[SPEAKER_05]: So are we going to wait until the asphalt plant closes down and we buy asphalt of serious standard, just the kind they use to do patchwork, or is this going to get done in a reasonable amount of time?

118
00:10:10,692 --> 00:10:19,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, we have one of the neighbors here that lives on South Street, and they say, these neighbors have been promised this for going on a while now.

119
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,936
[SPEAKER_05]: They say they were a month overdue.

120
00:10:23,117 --> 00:10:24,597
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to?

121
00:10:24,617 --> 00:10:24,697
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

122
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:25,157
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

123
00:10:25,177 --> 00:10:30,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'll say, again, we'd like to get an update in when this pavement is going to get done on South Street.

124
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:31,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind.

125
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:39,603
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you go to Prescott Street, they've dug up streets over there with trenches, and they didn't even patch them.

126
00:10:40,494 --> 00:10:41,575
[SPEAKER_05]: They filled them in with dirt.

127
00:10:42,436 --> 00:10:51,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, we're gonna wait till the plane closes, and we're gonna be using the winter mix that lasts about a month, and then it's gone again.

128
00:10:51,303 --> 00:10:55,467
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's not even anybody down there working anymore on Prescott Street.

129
00:10:56,327 --> 00:11:04,114
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I had a call to the engineer last week, because during all that rain, there was a hole that you can drive your car fell into.

130
00:11:05,058 --> 00:11:12,524
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, these are projects that, this Eversource project is never gonna end, ever.

131
00:11:12,624 --> 00:11:27,737
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just going, and you say, now that, I mean, they're still digging in front of the police station now every night, and you're seeing plates and plates, and now we're getting the complaints from the neighbors as the plates have moved down on that end now.

132
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:33,782
[SPEAKER_05]: I say, I would think at some point, we need to get Eversource in here,

133
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,064
[SPEAKER_05]: and figure out where they're going.

134
00:11:36,124 --> 00:11:39,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they're going a couple of feet a day.

135
00:11:40,469 --> 00:11:42,110
[SPEAKER_05]: This project isn't going anywhere.

136
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,433
[SPEAKER_05]: We're probably another two years away from this project getting done.

137
00:11:46,634 --> 00:11:57,645
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would make a motion that we have a community of the whole meeting with the Eversource officials, whether it be, I think it's Robin Collins, she's the project manager.

138
00:11:58,975 --> 00:12:09,862
[SPEAKER_05]: to get somebody in here at the committee hall to discuss where the project is going and have the engineer reach out to the people doing the work on Prescott Street by the school.

139
00:12:10,503 --> 00:12:12,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Get your hand out of his back, Zach.

140
00:12:28,162 --> 00:12:31,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounded better the second time.

141
00:12:31,724 --> 00:12:34,486
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll make that motion, Mr. President.

142
00:12:34,526 --> 00:12:36,488
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the corporation?

143
00:12:36,508 --> 00:12:39,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that McCabe that's down there on Prescott?

144
00:12:40,311 --> 00:12:45,034
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who's doing Prescott Street, but I haven't seen them down there in a bit.

145
00:12:46,415 --> 00:12:47,216
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it is McCabe.

146
00:12:47,236 --> 00:12:47,856
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.

147
00:12:48,357 --> 00:12:53,540
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, they've dug trenches there, and all they do is fill them in with gravel.

148
00:12:54,301 --> 00:12:55,522
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're coming up now.

149
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair recognizes Council Members.

150
00:13:01,962 --> 00:13:03,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

151
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:07,708
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank President Caviello for putting this on the agenda.

152
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:19,139
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when we talk about Eversource, I think no one can refute that Winthrop Street was heavily impacted by all the construction over the last several years.

153
00:13:19,859 --> 00:13:22,142
[SPEAKER_06]: And another street that comes to mind is Salt Street.

154
00:13:22,682 --> 00:13:31,473
[SPEAKER_06]: South Street has really borne the brunt of not only ever source but other projects, Mr President, over the last several years, and they.

155
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:34,813
[SPEAKER_06]: deserve some peace and quiet on that street.

156
00:13:34,873 --> 00:13:41,318
[SPEAKER_06]: So the quicker they can pave that area and give these residents a break, I'm all in support of that, Mr. President.

157
00:13:41,358 --> 00:13:54,970
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would hope the administration gets a wind of this and immediately acts, Mr. President, before, as President Caviello mentioned, before the weather gets too inclement for any type of road pavements.

158
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:56,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

159
00:13:58,893 --> 00:13:59,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Scarpelli.

160
00:14:00,414 --> 00:14:01,135
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

161
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,242
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, who have we invited?

162
00:14:04,262 --> 00:14:05,723
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss that, Mr. President.

163
00:14:06,543 --> 00:14:10,746
[SPEAKER_00]: For the Committee of the Whole meeting, we want, what departments are we asking, requesting again?

164
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:17,831
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say we'd have the project manager from Episodes come down along with our city engineer and DPW.

165
00:14:18,652 --> 00:14:24,035
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe our city solicitor to find out what our legal ramifications are.

166
00:14:24,436 --> 00:14:29,139
[SPEAKER_05]: As I say, this project's gonna be going on for another two more years at the pace they're going, if not longer.

167
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:30,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it.

168
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,154
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

169
00:15:02,214 --> 00:15:03,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably in the chimney.

170
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:25,073
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, if we can't to go back to that I think that it's important I'm going to hop on this until we find some sort of resolution I think it's important that we have a clerk of the works.

171
00:15:25,713 --> 00:15:32,477
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really reporting back to the city when we talk about these, these huge, huge inconvenience

172
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,001
[SPEAKER_00]: wrote the roadwork that's going on again.

173
00:15:36,581 --> 00:15:50,177
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have someone there on site every day something's going to get done something's going to be reported to the right people because there's definitely a disconnect, and I think that who's paying the price up and down Winthrop Street not the South Street and no council mark said it but

174
00:15:50,798 --> 00:16:06,667
[SPEAKER_00]: You know this, it's no different than the rattling of the plates, you know, it's, I've talked to a few neighbors in Winchester, and I said geez I said do you have the same concerns with the rattle and plates, and they say no that was one of the first initiatives I talked to them about making sure that every time they drop those plates.

175
00:16:07,188 --> 00:16:10,710
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an enough of a buffer to make sure that didn't happen.

176
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,552
[SPEAKER_00]: But you travel and traverse right over the line.

177
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:21,780
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like the slap in the face keeps coming back with these huge companies like Eversource and National Grid.

178
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,703
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate the welcome.

179
00:16:26,364 --> 00:16:28,486
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need every department there that's possible.

180
00:16:29,327 --> 00:16:35,713
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to make sure that we have a watchdog moving forward that's representing the city to make sure that

181
00:16:36,664 --> 00:16:44,370
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that that person will say from Eversource is held accountable, because if you remember the first meeting we had at Eversource, remember everyone?

182
00:16:45,031 --> 00:16:55,279
[SPEAKER_00]: The gentleman came up and he had a plan, and this is great, they're gonna put door signs, and everybody, this is my cell phone number, people call me, remember how great that was?

183
00:16:55,619 --> 00:16:59,142
[SPEAKER_00]: I have yet to hear from that, that man disappeared.

184
00:16:59,302 --> 00:17:03,986
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a figment of our imagination, because there has been no communication, no support from Eversource.

185
00:17:04,406 --> 00:17:04,746
[SPEAKER_00]: And again,

186
00:17:05,868 --> 00:17:09,529
[SPEAKER_00]: We know we had no power control to allow them in.

187
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:20,552
[SPEAKER_00]: We heard that a thousand times, but we also heard that we would get the support and the people would have, somebody would hear a voice that when something needed to be done.

188
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:21,852
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just so disappointed.

189
00:17:22,532 --> 00:17:23,573
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say this to the end.

190
00:17:25,213 --> 00:17:31,475
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we hear every day, roads, sidewalks, and a lot has to do with our,

191
00:17:34,464 --> 00:17:37,687
[SPEAKER_00]: our partnerships with Eversource and National Grid.

192
00:17:37,707 --> 00:17:39,388
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pretty disgusted.

193
00:17:39,568 --> 00:17:41,370
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate Council President bringing this forward.

194
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:41,690
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

195
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,371
[SPEAKER_00]: Chair recognizes Councilor Peco.

196
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:44,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

197
00:17:44,392 --> 00:17:47,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to thank Council President Capriolo for bringing this resolution forward.

198
00:17:49,116 --> 00:17:56,242
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I've been on the Council for six years and pretty much this started six years ago and it still drags on today.

199
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:10,526
[SPEAKER_03]: And this needs to be addressed, this is absolutely these are quality of life issues that need to be addressed in every single day the residents are residents throughout the community are impacted, but especially the residents that live.

200
00:18:11,586 --> 00:18:23,074
[SPEAKER_03]: In and along that route of where the constructions taking place, I mean, if you take a look at the construction in surrounding communities it's been definitely been managed differently than it's been managed here.

201
00:18:23,828 --> 00:18:27,611
[SPEAKER_03]: And I definitely would agree with President Cabrillo.

202
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:31,013
[SPEAKER_03]: There needs to be a meeting, Committee of the Whole meeting sooner than later on this.

203
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:38,798
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would ask that when the meeting is held or when it's scheduled, if we could send a robo-call to everyone that lives on this route.

204
00:18:39,979 --> 00:18:45,222
[SPEAKER_03]: The residents need to be involved in this and the questions should be addressed.

205
00:18:45,242 --> 00:18:49,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I think everyone wants to know when is this finally going to be finished?

206
00:18:51,258 --> 00:18:54,299
[SPEAKER_03]: The other source project is gonna last my tenure on the council.

207
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really, it's ridiculous.

208
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,681
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been going on for six years now.

209
00:18:59,861 --> 00:19:01,081
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just unacceptable.

210
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:02,962
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be addressed.

211
00:19:03,702 --> 00:19:04,642
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be managed.

212
00:19:04,702 --> 00:19:06,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's being managed properly.

213
00:19:06,783 --> 00:19:14,966
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would ask that all of the residents along the route be notified of this meeting so they can have their questions answered.

214
00:19:14,986 --> 00:19:18,767
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we could schedule this as soon as possible, I greatly appreciate it.

215
00:19:18,887 --> 00:19:19,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

216
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:21,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair, Mr. Councilor Baez.

217
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

218
00:19:22,631 --> 00:19:25,934
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll be as quick as I can on this, but I just want to drive home the point.

219
00:19:26,814 --> 00:19:30,818
[SPEAKER_07]: When we're talking about the plates, when we're talking about the paving schedule, we're talking about any of this.

220
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:38,664
[SPEAKER_07]: There were plates 300 yards up the street a year ago, and we said, can you make them not be so loud that people can't sleep at night?

221
00:19:38,724 --> 00:19:39,265
[SPEAKER_07]: It's recurring.

222
00:19:39,285 --> 00:19:40,205
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we are going back.

223
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:41,246
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a recurring problem.

224
00:19:41,286 --> 00:19:44,929
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Clerk of the Works is one potential answer here.

225
00:19:44,949 --> 00:19:46,911
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm totally supportive of that.

226
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:47,952
[SPEAKER_07]: But at this point,

227
00:19:48,512 --> 00:19:51,714
[SPEAKER_07]: when we're asking them to do something over and over again, they go and do it.

228
00:19:51,794 --> 00:20:09,886
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the next time they go out to do something similar and they don't follow that instruction again, I just want to ask you in the form of an amendment, is there any sort of recourse we have with the department of public utilities, either for additional accountability on oversight from their end on projects like these are specifically on the ever source project.

229
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:15,110
[SPEAKER_07]: And is there any compensation that the city's entitled to considering the impact that this has had

230
00:20:15,718 --> 00:20:20,502
[SPEAKER_07]: and what I would call the negligence of the contractor working for this company.

231
00:20:21,342 --> 00:20:28,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Because basically I think to Councilor Scarpelli's point, it doesn't feel like a very public to me, not so public utilities in my opinion.

232
00:20:28,588 --> 00:20:31,590
[SPEAKER_07]: These companies are just running roughshod and they're not accountable to the public.

233
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:41,578
[SPEAKER_07]: So if there's some recourse either through additional accountability that the state can come down, I think it's an addition to whatever we can do as a city in the long run to get these projects working.

234
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:42,959
[SPEAKER_07]: And to be honest, I think

235
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:47,641
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, I'm sure that we're not entitled to compensation, but I'd at least like to ask because I think we deserve it.

236
00:20:49,202 --> 00:20:49,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

237
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:50,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

238
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:54,445
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, you know, if you look at like the big, big, for example, you know, they had performance standards, right?

239
00:20:54,485 --> 00:20:57,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Where they said, if you don't meet these benchmarks, then you're going to pay us money.

240
00:20:57,867 --> 00:21:03,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I think it might be time for us to start looking at the contracts that we're offering and, uh, seeing if that's an option.

241
00:21:03,891 --> 00:21:06,152
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't pay utility companies.

242
00:21:06,673 --> 00:21:11,375
[SPEAKER_06]: We went through that with the state, with the fast 14 project, with the bridge, they will not pay.

243
00:21:11,475 --> 00:21:11,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

244
00:21:13,712 --> 00:21:14,373
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't give any.

245
00:21:16,374 --> 00:21:23,220
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion by Councilor Caviello, as amended by Councilor Caviello, Councilor Falco, Councilor Scarpelli, and Councilor Baez.

246
00:21:23,761 --> 00:21:24,341
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

247
00:21:24,361 --> 00:21:24,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

248
00:21:25,582 --> 00:21:25,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Opposed?

249
00:21:28,104 --> 00:21:28,705
[SPEAKER_08]: The ayes have it.

250
00:21:30,043 --> 00:21:38,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Council paper 21613 offered by Councilor Mox, be it resolved that a moment of silence be held to lifelong resident Robert Amari on his recent passing.

251
00:21:38,906 --> 00:21:39,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Mox.

252
00:21:40,387 --> 00:21:41,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

253
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,549
[SPEAKER_06]: What a life Mr. Amari led.

254
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:47,330
[SPEAKER_06]: He was a lifelong Meffitt resident.

255
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,891
[SPEAKER_06]: He was a graduate of Meffitt High School.

256
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:55,533
[SPEAKER_06]: He was the captain of the varsity football team at Meffitt High School.

257
00:21:56,293 --> 00:21:58,137
[SPEAKER_06]: He was enlisted in the U.S.

258
00:21:58,277 --> 00:22:05,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Army, achieving the rank of corporal, and was decorated for service in the Korean War.

259
00:22:06,797 --> 00:22:14,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Robert was a plumber by trade, and he also enjoyed a long career with the MBTA as a mechanics and maintenance supervisor.

260
00:22:15,061 --> 00:22:21,464
[SPEAKER_06]: He was a devoted husband, father, grandfather, brother, and friend to many, Mr. President.

261
00:22:22,504 --> 00:22:29,868
[SPEAKER_06]: He is survived by his wife, Frances, a sweetheart of a woman, his children, Joanne, Robert,

262
00:22:30,368 --> 00:22:33,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Lisa, and Johnny Amari.

263
00:22:33,931 --> 00:22:41,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone knows Johnny Amari as the mayor of South Method, and he truly is the mayor of South Method, if you know Johnny.

264
00:22:41,756 --> 00:22:53,805
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, the Amaris are just a staple of this community, have been here for many decades, and they will be, Robert will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

265
00:22:54,337 --> 00:23:01,241
[SPEAKER_06]: I would ask that we dedicate this meeting in his honor, Robert Amari from Stearns Ave, Mr. President.

266
00:23:01,762 --> 00:23:02,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

267
00:23:04,443 --> 00:23:08,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, on the motion of Council Marks, seconded by Vice President Knight.

268
00:23:09,547 --> 00:23:10,147
[SPEAKER_05]: All in favor.

269
00:23:13,109 --> 00:23:14,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Please rise for a moment of silence.

270
00:23:37,425 --> 00:23:44,530
[SPEAKER_05]: 21614 of my vice president, I'd be a strong result and let me see council and send the defense to say congratulations.

271
00:23:45,445 --> 00:23:51,090
[SPEAKER_05]: to Ralph and Loretta Evangelista on the momentous celebration of their 60th wedding anniversary.

272
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President May.

273
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:53,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, yes, thank you very much.

274
00:23:54,113 --> 00:23:58,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Just this past week, Ralph and Loretta celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary.

275
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:05,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Many of us know Ralph and Loretta from being around the community, raising two lovely daughters, Lisa Evangelista and Julia Evangelista.

276
00:24:06,304 --> 00:24:08,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Many of us know Lisa from her work in the mayor's office and from her work

277
00:24:09,572 --> 00:24:10,513

279
00:24:14,356 --> 00:24:19,841
[SPEAKER_08]: But that is nothing compared to the dedication that Ralph and Loretta have shown each other for the past 60, Mr. President.

280
00:24:19,861 --> 00:24:24,145
[SPEAKER_08]: They're the cutest couple you'll ever see, two peas in a pod that you'll see go everywhere together.

281
00:24:24,645 --> 00:24:28,168
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's great to see that they've been able to celebrate this momentous occasion.

282
00:24:28,689 --> 00:24:31,911
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to join me in congratulating them.

283
00:24:33,433 --> 00:24:33,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

284
00:24:35,436 --> 00:24:50,182
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I could speak, I've known Ralph and Loretta many, many years, two great daughters, two great people, good friends of mine, and I wanna wish them congratulations, 60 years of marriage.

285
00:24:52,463 --> 00:24:53,903
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Council Member Falco.

286
00:24:55,484 --> 00:24:57,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Council Member Knight for bringing this forward.

287
00:24:57,384 --> 00:25:04,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanna wish the evangelist is a very happy anniversary and many more years to come.

288

293
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:26,187
[SPEAKER_05]: 2-1-6-1-6 offered by Vice President Knight, be it so resolved to seek counsel for the moment of silence and recognition of the sacrifices made by veterans.

294
00:25:27,447 --> 00:25:28,407
[SPEAKER_05]: in honor of Veterans Day.

295
00:25:28,447 --> 00:25:29,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Knight.

296
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

297
00:25:30,888 --> 00:25:34,269
[SPEAKER_08]: As we're all aware, this Thursday is Veterans Day, 11-11.

298
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:40,431
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's also the, I believe, 246th birthday of the United States Marine Corps, if I'm not mistaken.

299
00:25:40,451 --> 00:25:44,452
[SPEAKER_08]: But with that being said, Mr. President, Medford has a very strong veterans population.

300
00:25:44,472 --> 00:25:51,375
[SPEAKER_08]: There's almost 2,000 veterans that reside in this community that at one point in their lives signed the dotted line and said, I'm going to do more for my country.

301
00:25:51,815 --> 00:25:52,575
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to do more.

302
00:25:53,155 --> 00:25:57,497
[SPEAKER_08]: And these individuals sacrifice they spent time away from their family they put themselves in harm's way.

303
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,118
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of them are fortunate to come back.

304
00:26:00,578 --> 00:26:04,199
[SPEAKER_08]: And those are the people that we honor here on Veterans Day, Mr. President, all those who have served.

305
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,341
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support me in this resolution.

306
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:13,383
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd also like to offer that I've had conversations with Michael Durham.

307
00:26:13,867 --> 00:26:24,055
[SPEAKER_08]: down the veterans office I bumped into him just the other day at the Mets donuts where he was making a purchase of 300 donuts to distribute to veterans mentioned veterans on Veterans Day.

308
00:26:24,776 --> 00:26:37,947
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said was the president that for those veterans that are interested that please visit the veterans services website for more information but it will be a celebration Thursday coming out of the veterans service office on Iraq veterans with donuts from the Mets.

309
00:26:39,148 --> 00:26:39,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
