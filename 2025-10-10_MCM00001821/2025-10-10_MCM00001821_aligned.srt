1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:07,843
I'd like to call to order the Medical Affordable Housing Trust Funds Wednesday, October 1st meeting.

2
00:00:07,863 --> 00:00:14,947
We're meeting in room 201 in a hybrid meeting called attendance, I guess.

3
00:00:15,627 --> 00:00:15,967
Penny?

4
00:00:15,987 --> 00:00:17,748
Kayla?

5
00:00:18,048 --> 00:00:18,308
Here.

6
00:00:18,608 --> 00:00:19,129
Roberta?

7
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:19,689
Here.

8
00:00:20,169 --> 00:00:20,529
Harry?

9
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:22,310
Teta?

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:22,970
Here.

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:23,891
Madam Mayor?

12
00:00:24,911 --> 00:00:25,552
And Lisa?

13
00:00:25,732 --> 00:00:26,012
Here.

14
00:00:26,732 --> 00:00:28,353
Oh, the Mayor is in the meeting room.

15
00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:43,887
This is fantastic.

16
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:45,588
Good evening, Madam Mayor.

17
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:48,490
Good evening, everybody.

18
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,311
Thank you for joining.

19
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:53,232
Oh, sorry, I'm late and I have an event to go to.

20
00:00:53,292 --> 00:00:58,735
So that's why I'm just going to hang in so I can commute while listening in too.

21
00:00:58,915 --> 00:00:59,255
Thank you.

22
00:01:00,376 --> 00:01:00,736
Thank you.

23
00:01:01,783 --> 00:01:09,649
All right, so announcements we have I want to officially welcome Rosa to the affordable housing trust fund.

24
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:13,672
She was confirmed at the city council meeting on September 9th.

25
00:01:14,012 --> 00:01:15,973
It's a long council meeting.

26
00:01:16,254 --> 00:01:16,694
It was.

27
00:01:16,714 --> 00:01:19,556
I stayed as long as I could.

28
00:01:19,576 --> 00:01:20,617
Actually, it wasn't

29
00:01:22,728 --> 00:01:25,189
long after you had left, that maybe I solved the app.

30
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:26,150
So it was pretty good.

31
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,431
And it was nice to see the meeting in person.

32
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:28,791
Yes.

33
00:01:29,231 --> 00:01:29,952
Congratulations.

34
00:01:30,012 --> 00:01:30,652
Thank you.

35
00:01:30,812 --> 00:01:31,492
Welcome.

36
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:37,636
Does everybody, we did introductions, brief, once you know everybody around the table.

37
00:01:38,096 --> 00:01:38,376
Yes.

38
00:01:38,476 --> 00:01:40,777
And we just introduced ourselves then.

39
00:01:41,137 --> 00:01:41,498
Perfect.

40
00:01:43,258 --> 00:01:44,979
All right.

41
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:50,502
So has everybody gotten a chance to review the September 30th minutes?

42
00:01:51,162 --> 00:01:51,383
Yes.

43
00:01:51,603 --> 00:01:51,843
Yes.

44
00:01:52,560 --> 00:02:01,262
Okay, if there are no edits to the board minutes from September 3rd, I'd like to request a motion to approve the meeting minutes.

45
00:02:02,943 --> 00:02:03,423
So moved.

46
00:02:04,403 --> 00:02:04,803
Second.

47
00:02:06,843 --> 00:02:09,664
All right, and we're gonna do a roll call.

48
00:02:10,884 --> 00:02:11,305
Kayla?

49
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:11,785
Yes.

50
00:02:12,025 --> 00:02:12,665
Roberta?

51
00:02:12,805 --> 00:02:13,085
Yes.

52
00:02:14,245 --> 00:02:14,625
Teda?

53
00:02:14,865 --> 00:02:15,126
Yes.

54
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:16,046
Madam Mayor?

55
00:02:17,866 --> 00:02:18,126
Yes.

56
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:20,807
Okay, and Lisa, yes.

57
00:02:24,223 --> 00:02:31,365
Okay, and item four on the agenda is Councilor Lemmon's Fractional Payment Resolution.

58
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:44,689
We're joined tonight with Councilor Lemmon to discuss his resolution regarding allowing fractional payments to be made to the Affordable Housing Trust, rather than rounding up to the next affordable unit.

59
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,310
I'll open the floor to discussion.

60
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,831
Is there anything I'm not seeing?

61
00:02:55,956 --> 00:02:59,377
First of all, thank you for the resolution.

62
00:03:00,017 --> 00:03:06,640
For the, having the fractional payments, if I'm understanding, would be made to the Affordable Housing Trust.

63
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,260
Yes.

64
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,742
Can I ask a question before we start the conversation?

65
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:12,182
Yes.

66
00:03:13,802 --> 00:03:20,325
I am embarrassed to say I'm not 100% afloat in the ordinance right now.

67
00:03:21,305 --> 00:03:22,946
If the fractional, is it,

68
00:03:25,115 --> 00:03:30,918
is there a certain threshold that happens before they round up?

69
00:03:31,018 --> 00:03:43,304
So if it's less than 50%, is it no pay, nothing happens, or if it is, no matter what the fractional unit is, they have to round up?

70
00:03:44,644 --> 00:03:51,187
My reading of the language, and I went over this a few times, that it's rounded up, which is- It doesn't matter, right?

71
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:52,768
Yeah, so it's like,

72
00:03:54,951 --> 00:04:02,578
you know, if it comes out to like 20%, then it's, yeah, yeah, it's always rounded up.

73
00:04:02,718 --> 00:04:03,419
It's always rounded.

74
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,363
So if it's like 1.2 units, it automatically goes to the two units.

75
00:04:07,443 --> 00:04:09,225
And that, yeah, that's an issue.

76
00:04:09,245 --> 00:04:09,565
Thank you.

77
00:04:14,948 --> 00:04:18,150
Roberta did a slide show.

78
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,712
Thank you for comparing the different ordinance.

79
00:04:21,732 --> 00:04:23,954
I don't know if we want to just jump right in there.

80
00:04:23,974 --> 00:04:30,458
I don't sure how to press and it's the purpose of this slide show is just to.

81
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:47,293
Demonstrate to everyone that our ordinances are different and we can kind of see at a very high level what they look like, because I really haven't spent a lot of time with this, but I thought even this little cursory look would be very instructive.

82
00:04:47,974 --> 00:04:50,137
So next slide please.

83
00:04:50,932 --> 00:04:57,057
So just kind of some basic facts of what Medford's Inclusionary Ordinance looks like.

84
00:04:57,758 --> 00:05:00,660
At the bottom, we see what it applies to.

85
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:14,652
Any development with 10 or more units has to provide some inclusionary units, and it is the proportion of inclusionary units required increases with the number of units.

86
00:05:15,272 --> 00:05:25,261
So, at 10 to 24 units, it's 10%, 25 to 49 units, 13%, and 50 or more units, it's 15%.

87
00:05:27,003 --> 00:05:31,527
All of the affordability is set at 80% of area median income.

88
00:05:32,047 --> 00:05:33,949
We have no fractional units.

89
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:39,314
Anything that falls in between is rounded up, which I think

90
00:05:40,118 --> 00:05:51,900
An argument is that this discourages unit creation because developers would rather eliminate a unit than have to round up or eliminate nine units rather than round up.

91
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,021
Let me just go back to that side a little bit more.

92
00:05:57,521 --> 00:06:05,642
Units have to be, there are no bonuses or incentives built into our ordinance and the units must be onsite.

93
00:06:05,682 --> 00:06:07,863
There's no alternative to onsite.

94
00:06:09,238 --> 00:06:09,718
mentioned.

95
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:14,763
So the next slide is Watertown I looked at.

96
00:06:15,984 --> 00:06:20,848
The affordability in Watertown is also 80% of area median income.

97
00:06:21,228 --> 00:06:27,394
They also have different levels of proportion of units required.

98
00:06:27,874 --> 00:06:29,415
Theirs start a little bit lower.

99
00:06:29,435 --> 00:06:29,896
It's 6 to 19 units.

100
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:37,922
in a development, it's 12.5%, 20 units is 15%.

101
00:06:38,342 --> 00:06:54,571
They also round up to the nearest full number, but they do allow for cash payment in lieu if it's a very small, less than 10 units in a development can make cash and lieu payments optionally.

102
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:57,132
And they provide, I'm sorry, yeah, go ahead.

103
00:06:57,152 --> 00:06:59,213
I'm pretty sure they round down or round up

104
00:07:00,043 --> 00:07:00,703
I missed that, okay.

105
00:07:00,723 --> 00:07:03,785
There's a cash-in-lieu option, but you need a special permit.

106
00:07:04,205 --> 00:07:05,246
Okay, thank you.

107
00:07:05,286 --> 00:07:07,607
Thank you.

108
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:09,008
Thank you.

109
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:15,911
Yeah, this is such a quick cursory view that I stand to be corrected also when I get to Somerville, too.

110
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:18,532
Somerville, yeah.

111
00:07:18,552 --> 00:07:27,337
Watertown doesn't actually have a fractional payment, like cash payment provision because you round down, so it would be correct.

112
00:07:27,377 --> 00:07:28,097
Yeah, got it.

113
00:07:28,952 --> 00:07:36,581
And so a formula is provided for calculating the cash in lieu payment, which is based on, that's a lot of letters.

114
00:07:39,764 --> 00:07:46,552
Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development Qualified Allocation Plan.

115
00:07:48,698 --> 00:07:55,080
for low income housing tax credits.

116
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:04,422
So basically, their formula is pegging to a published standard by the state.

117
00:08:04,963 --> 00:08:06,523
That's what all those letters mean.

118
00:08:08,103 --> 00:08:15,285
And they do provide some incentive, which is affordable units are exempted for minimum lot area for or the

119
00:08:17,695 --> 00:08:28,884
Floor area ratio that determines the amount of development that can take place and they rental units to be exempted.

120
00:08:28,904 --> 00:08:39,733
So if you build more than required number of rental units and those more than required units are affordable to households below 65% area median income, you can

121
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,786
you can obtain this incentive of additional units.

122
00:08:47,806 --> 00:09:00,504
And also I understood, maybe I'm wrong, that small scale of affordable housing developments can be allowed by right.

123
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:06,700
So I assume that means that there must be a special permit required for some uses.

124
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,121
So that's Watertown.

125
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:20,304
Somerville I looked at and Somerville has three tiers of affordability required defined by the size of the development.

126
00:09:21,064 --> 00:09:31,089
offsite units or alternative methods of compliance are strongly discouraged, but several different options are spelled out in the ordinance.

127
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:37,772
And there's a procedure given for determining when it's in the city's best interest.

128
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:44,015
Fractional units, you're about to correct me, Lisa, and I was looking at your chart.

129
00:09:44,095 --> 00:09:44,755
I'm sorry.

130
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:45,836
Oh, it's wrong.

131
00:09:46,936 --> 00:09:48,737
So some of those 20 percent across the board.

132
00:09:50,068 --> 00:09:56,232
I might be looking at an old version of 2019.

133
00:09:56,272 --> 00:09:59,133
2019, they had a new ordinance that went in place.

134
00:09:59,153 --> 00:10:13,121
2019's ordinance is anything with four or more units, again, depends on what's it called, the zone that they're in, essentially you are in.

135
00:10:15,757 --> 00:10:17,338
So ignore the table.

136
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,643
But all the other stop ups, the 1, 2, 3, 1st, 4th.

137
00:10:25,664 --> 00:10:31,148
It is 20% and it does do, we do, Summerville does do fractional payments.

138
00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:37,833
And it is, there's a fun calculation that it does with the fractional payments too.

139
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:46,477
And there's also bonuses for additional units and additional incentives for a plus plus students.

140
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:50,139
That's not true.

141
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,521
It doesn't sound like I could be wrong.

142
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:53,101
Okay.

143
00:10:53,301 --> 00:10:58,063
I could be reading a wrong version of the ordinance when I looked at this.

144
00:10:58,144 --> 00:10:58,504
So, um.

145
00:10:59,718 --> 00:11:01,759
This is to be determined.

146
00:11:01,859 --> 00:11:15,185
This is just really to show contrasting the simplicity of Medford's to the subtlety that is in some of these other ordinances, and that

147
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:21,828
it's not only a matter of, like, fractional payments aren't the only way of generating revenue through the Inclusionary Ordinance.

148
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:28,311
Watertown is also doing it by allowing for, you know, the payment in lieu for small developments.

149
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:41,697
And so there are questions to be explored about how we can generate revenue with the Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance and maybe make some tweaks to the ordinance to encourage more

150
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:46,532
larger scale development that's going to use that ordinance to create these units.

151
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:51,116
So that was my case to be made.

152
00:11:51,356 --> 00:11:52,197
Thank you.

153
00:11:52,217 --> 00:12:02,825
Thank you.

154
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:05,227
Can I ask a question for clarity?

155
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:08,169
Through the chair, thank you.

156
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:27,076
I like the idea of both, but are we talking about having a developer round up if there's a fraction or to make a payment or are we proposing or Councilor Lemme, are you proposing that we let them choose, but they have to do one or the other?

157
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:28,156
I just want to be clear.

158
00:12:28,216 --> 00:12:32,098
Cause I like the concept of this and what it's leading to.

159
00:12:32,178 --> 00:12:33,298
I just want clarity.

160
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:37,099
Well, the current system is to round up.

161
00:12:39,145 --> 00:12:45,251
which sort of discourages them from developing more units.

162
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:57,061
It kind of just makes it so that they're incentivized to build nine units instead of 10 on the current system, whereas they

163
00:12:58,369 --> 00:13:05,776
Whereas if we switch to a fractional payment system, they could be encouraged to build 10.

164
00:13:05,977 --> 00:13:15,426
That last unit's not affordable, but then they give some sort of a payment to the affordable housing trust.

165
00:13:15,506 --> 00:13:21,993
Or if they're building a 20-unit property, they're currently very discouraged from building

166
00:13:23,443 --> 00:13:26,984
21 units, that would be an additional affordable unit.

167
00:13:27,144 --> 00:13:36,225
But if it were a fractional payment system, then they wouldn't really have that disincentive from building at that discrete threshold.

168
00:13:37,106 --> 00:13:40,906
They would have the option to just put some cash in the Affordable Housing Trust instead.

169
00:13:42,847 --> 00:13:44,827
Does that make sense?

170
00:13:44,967 --> 00:13:45,607
Yes, that's great.

171
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:46,247
Thank you.

172
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:48,928
There's two things you're talking about.

173
00:13:48,968 --> 00:13:50,348
There's cash in lieu where

174
00:13:51,286 --> 00:14:09,960
do you have a whole unit you're supposed to provide and then a cash payment in lieu of providing the unit or the fractional payment where it's, you know, say the number comes up to 2.2 units must be provided through the formula, which that would be the 15% or 20%.

175
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,383
I just did it using the numbers on the resolution

176
00:14:15,468 --> 00:14:21,290
The 10 to 24 units at 10%, I use the 24, that would be 2.4 units.

177
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:30,993
Yes, I'm trying to give an example where a developer has like a 314 unit project.

178
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:35,214
And I'm not good at math, that's why I'm a planner, not an engineer.

179
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,475
And so it'll come up to a fraction.

180
00:14:38,595 --> 00:14:43,257
And as the senior planner who reviews all the development that comes in,

181
00:14:44,027 --> 00:14:52,692
Nobody is creating a unit count that results in a fractional payment where they're going to lose more money.

182
00:14:53,112 --> 00:14:57,854
So they size the total unit count to be just under.

183
00:14:59,955 --> 00:15:02,877
So nobody is rounding up.

184
00:15:02,937 --> 00:15:03,938
That's just not happening.

185
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:07,219
But if it was 0.1, 0.2 of a unit, we could have

186
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:17,253
basically doing a cash and move calculation and taking that percentage of it.

187
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:25,880
So like 10% of the cost, either the development cost of a unit or the subsidy gap.

188
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:33,966
So the gap between, which the subsidy gap works better for ownership because that's very clear price difference.

189
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:37,949
What's affordable to, the affordable price versus the market rate price.

190
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:41,992
And then that's the payment or the development costs under the

191
00:15:45,788 --> 00:15:59,232
Well, yeah, yeah, I think in order to solve this, to solve this problem, like, the, the, the, the issue is that developers are sort of like discouraged from building like a certain number of units and I just kind of like makes these very weird.

192
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:09,076
Step off saying, so the point of the resolution, like, the intention behind it is to make it this sort of like, give the affordable housing trust, like, broad.

193
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:17,678
like broad like authority to recommend to council a policy that fixes this issue.

194
00:16:17,798 --> 00:16:33,242
So it could be something similar they're doing in Somerville, Watertown or another municipality or could be completely original policy just as long as it solves that discrete like number of units problem and can potentially get some cash in to be

195
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,872
into the affordable housing trust.

196
00:16:35,932 --> 00:16:50,844
So the way that I was envisioning it was give the AHT time to discuss, come up with something that you can agree upon, and it would be voted and sent back to Council in the form of a recommendation.

197
00:16:51,305 --> 00:16:52,286
Council could

198
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:59,660
Council could, you know, refer it to legal if we have the authority to do that.

199
00:17:00,201 --> 00:17:02,101
So it could be looked over in that sense.

200
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:21,049
And then it would go through the normal process for updating a zoning ordinance, which is Council votes it out to recommend to the Community Development Board, which would then hold their own public hearings on it, refer it back to Council, and then Council could potentially pass that with a two-thirds vote, and then it would be ordained.

201
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:23,010
The point of this is that, like,

202
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:32,871
I have been hearing planners rightfully talk about this particular policy.

203
00:17:32,891 --> 00:17:34,832
We talked about it.

204
00:17:34,872 --> 00:17:36,133
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

205
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:38,774
Our office hired us years ago.

206
00:17:38,794 --> 00:17:43,557
And so this is sort of like saying, OK, please tell council how to fix this.

207
00:17:44,037 --> 00:17:45,498
That's kind of the intention here.

208
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,240
So thank you for the clarification.

209
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,100
I appreciate that.

210
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:51,962
With the attention, because

211
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,591
what I'm hearing, I just want to make sure I heard it correctly.

212
00:17:56,412 --> 00:18:07,316
The intention is getting affordable, getting units built in the city of Medford, as many as the developer wishes.

213
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:17,421
And then if there's a, if instead of losing a certain number of units, we want them to be able to do a fractional, possibly do a fractional payment.

214
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:20,342
I have got to, and I think,

215
00:18:20,955 --> 00:18:46,178
I think what I'm also hearing is that your resolution is asking for the Affordable Housing Trust Fund to do some brainstorming and to sort of look at whether or not, you know, do we, if there is a fractional payment, is that fractional payment, does the fractional, do you look at whether it's a fractional payment, anything below 50%

216
00:18:48,454 --> 00:19:00,378
or, and then round up 50, if the fractional is 50, you round up and you kind of get a twofer, or just a fractional payment straight across the board.

217
00:19:00,498 --> 00:19:09,741
And if that's the case, looking at the formula, because Somerville has a formula.

218
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:17,363
Somerville changed its formula in the 2019 ordinance because in Somerville,

219
00:19:18,803 --> 00:19:21,625
We wanted, once upon a time, we wanted the units.

220
00:19:21,805 --> 00:19:25,727
I mean, we wanted the money for it to do the trust.

221
00:19:26,848 --> 00:19:32,811
And then we really wanted them to encourage, by we, I mean Somerville, I'm sorry, I've got to think of the word, ma'am.

222
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,311
The Somerville wanted the unit.

223
00:19:34,392 --> 00:19:38,834
So the formula for the fractional payment, let's say that it is,

224
00:19:49,309 --> 00:20:07,360
a homeownership, it is actually looking at the comparable units, sale prices by the difference between the, oh my God, the affordable unit multiplied by the fractional.

225
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,282
So in some cases, it doesn't matter what the fractional payment is.

226
00:20:12,302 --> 00:20:18,326
There are some cases where they may owe the affordable housing trust fund, the developer owes the trust fund.

227
00:20:18,955 --> 00:20:27,805
When I'd like millions of dollars or close to millions of dollars for that fractional payment, which adds to the developer, right?

228
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:29,147
It adds to the cost.

229
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:35,234
And if you're thinking about the pipeline right now, or what's coming in and the cost of developing property is very expensive.

230
00:20:35,774 --> 00:20:36,275
So just.

231
00:20:37,552 --> 00:20:40,434
I don't know if that's what you're looking for.

232
00:20:40,514 --> 00:20:50,599
I would say it would be fine to just recommend a complete update to the policy as overall.

233
00:20:51,380 --> 00:21:02,546
Again, I guess not just looking at the fractional payments issue in a vacuum, but if there is a consensus that the 10 to 24, 25 to 49, or 50 plus is

234
00:21:07,003 --> 00:21:13,748
working, then I would view this as an opportunity to just, like, recommend something completely different.

235
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:23,436
Just, like, I think the important thing from Council's perspective is that there's consensus and solid reasoning behind it.

236
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:28,340
And I think that the AHT is a good board to, a good body to provide that.

237
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,223
Okay, thank you.

238
00:21:33,006 --> 00:21:34,327
I have a question.

239
00:21:34,587 --> 00:21:42,515
Is the city putting out an RFP for a consultant to study this issue?

240
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:49,321
I thought I read in the minutes that there would be a consultant.

241
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,962
I might have misunderstood or misremembered that.

242
00:21:57,222 --> 00:22:06,587
I believe Teresa is making an RFP at the moment for the affordable housing access study, which is a little bit different.

243
00:22:09,568 --> 00:22:10,468
Okay.

244
00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:13,050
That's related to the linkage fee, that's not related to.

245
00:22:14,055 --> 00:22:29,208
So we're looking for community and affordable housing trust input on what we think the inclusionary zoning should look like and maybe coordinating with the city staff to develop that.

246
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:29,769
Yes.

247
00:22:31,944 --> 00:22:41,106
Yeah, if you think that it is only within the capacity to recommend a small change, like a small common sense changes that the city staff could support, that's fine.

248
00:22:41,246 --> 00:22:50,689
If you think that the whole policy just needs to be overthrown and that it is within the capacity of city staff to do that, that's fine too.

249
00:22:51,949 --> 00:22:54,269
So, Danielle, yeah, sorry.

250
00:22:57,186 --> 00:23:03,691
the thresholds, we need to do an economic feasibility analysis because you don't want to run into the problems that Somerville did.

251
00:23:03,731 --> 00:23:08,936
We had to walk back the requirements because if you require too much, you don't rebuild anything.

252
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:12,799
So there's kind of, you know.

253
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:17,463
And we're in the mess, Somerville's in the mess of doing a financial feasibility analysis.

254
00:23:17,503 --> 00:23:18,644
Yes, we have to do that.

255
00:23:19,825 --> 00:23:25,790
The MBTA zoning, like we had to do an economic feasibility analysis to even let them to,

256
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:38,484
allow us to even use our existing ordinance because it's more, I don't know, onerous, I guess, because it's more than 10%.

257
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:47,392
So the state basically said, you have to prove that requiring anything more than 10%, 80% of your AMI wouldn't sign in development.

258
00:23:47,953 --> 00:23:51,396
And so did the study show that our

259
00:23:52,949 --> 00:23:59,033
The ordinance that we have now, in combination with linkage too, because right now residential development is out of linkage.

260
00:23:59,593 --> 00:24:04,456
So you have to be careful with the levers that you're pulling, otherwise you get nothing.

261
00:24:05,116 --> 00:24:11,219
So I would not be changing the percentages, especially where we're trying to get our linkage fees.

262
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:11,920
Yeah.

263
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:19,024
And that's, again, I'd say that's a decision that the AHT can make, but yeah.

264
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:26,264
I'm just basically Council's just looking for a recommendation to get another revenue stream into the AHT.

265
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:28,526
Yeah, the fractional payments.

266
00:24:28,806 --> 00:24:30,347
Our office completely supports this.

267
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,448
I think I, yeah.

268
00:24:32,202 --> 00:24:34,183
was telling you about the concepts.

269
00:24:36,884 --> 00:24:52,989
It's just helpful to understand what has already gone into thinking about this, and then what we imagine the process is going to look like to develop it.

270
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:57,151
I'm just listening and wrapping my head around it.

271
00:24:57,191 --> 00:24:58,651
Because when I read this, I was like, OK,

272
00:25:00,725 --> 00:25:03,827
paying in lieu of having a unit, right?

273
00:25:05,528 --> 00:25:15,375
So trying to visualize West Method Square, we have luxury condos going up and they're doing nine units.

274
00:25:16,196 --> 00:25:22,100
Had they did 10 units, they would have to have one, at least one affordable unit.

275
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:26,083
So when I first read this, I was thinking, okay, so why would,

276
00:25:27,308 --> 00:25:43,578
somebody like developers because they want to make the most money that they possibly can you know they're you know staying underneath so if they're going to stay at nine and instead of rounding up to the 10 they're going to give a fractional amount or

277
00:25:47,274 --> 00:25:56,843
They may have gone in and may have, because I'm not the developer, I don't know, they may have thought, you know what, this is a perfect site for 10 units.

278
00:25:57,424 --> 00:25:58,625
And they did the math.

279
00:25:58,865 --> 00:26:01,367
And well, no, because they would have been even.

280
00:26:01,387 --> 00:26:02,248
They wanted to avoid.

281
00:26:02,268 --> 00:26:02,348
Yeah.

282
00:26:03,009 --> 00:26:04,590
But then you would have to buy two.

283
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:04,750
Yeah.

284
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:04,871
Yeah.

285
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:15,862
But are you asking, like, why they wouldn't even consider an affordable at all?

286
00:26:16,162 --> 00:26:16,682
Well, right.

287
00:26:16,763 --> 00:26:23,908
Because, like, so why would a developer come in if they know if I stand or a certain amount of numbers, you know what I mean?

288
00:26:24,028 --> 00:26:28,612
And then my other thought was, so if they have 9 units, and then they have.

289
00:26:30,486 --> 00:26:34,288
they're going to have store like commercial unit underneath.

290
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:39,452
Is that considered a unit or is that completely separate because it's mixed use?

291
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:48,057
So, you know, if they have one store or two stores, essentially that's like two income generating units.

292
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:50,479
So instead of it being nine, it's actually 11.

293
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:50,999
Right.

294
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,040
And I don't know.

295
00:26:53,061 --> 00:26:56,783
I mean, that's where my head was going and I'm like listening and I'm like, yeah,

296
00:26:57,397 --> 00:27:08,225
Trying to figure out where that balance is and, you know, are we going to have a bunch of nine-unit developments going up so that they don't have to put affordable housing?

297
00:27:08,325 --> 00:27:14,049
Anytime that there's a cliff, there's going to be a natural progression, a natural indication to go underneath.

298
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:17,992
So that's going to be hard to avoid whatever we craft.

299
00:27:18,032 --> 00:27:23,496
I don't know about the mixed unit, the commercial unit question, I'm assuming

300
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:25,259
residential only.

301
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,221
They usually lose money on the ground floor.

302
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:37,989
It's sort of like doing us a favor to put it in there so you can have like a walkable nice square so I wouldn't want to disincentivize.

303
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:41,292
Do they pay linkage on the commercial space?

304
00:27:42,673 --> 00:27:51,640
There's no, that one didn't require, well actually, because linkage kicks in at six units and there's a threshold for

305
00:27:53,692 --> 00:28:20,675
size for commercials this i'm not sure if it rises to that because the commercial space of that one example is actually quite small that's there's um you know other stuff there's a unit down there too so the the link i just want to because i'm just not used to the linkage being tagged to residential i'm used to the linkage being tagged to commercial so i just want to make sure that that's what i'm hearing so the linkage is

306
00:28:21,135 --> 00:28:23,657
There's no linkage being tapped to cook.

307
00:28:23,697 --> 00:28:29,342
Well, there may not be linkage attached to commercial, but there's definitely linkage payments.

308
00:28:29,943 --> 00:28:35,128
Attached to residential and not don't pay linkage and the.

309
00:28:36,103 --> 00:28:38,424
The commercial, there's size requirements.

310
00:28:38,504 --> 00:28:42,086
A small commercial space would not be subject to it.

311
00:28:42,247 --> 00:28:43,727
I think it's 10,000.

312
00:28:43,888 --> 00:29:05,100
So if a developer is coming into Method and they're developing a 50-unit residential mixed first floor, storefronts, 50 units, the developer may be required, I don't want to use absolutes, but may be required to pay

313
00:29:05,805 --> 00:29:12,547
linkage for commercial, linkage for residential, and provide affordable units.

314
00:29:13,828 --> 00:29:15,148
Yeah, possibly.

315
00:29:15,388 --> 00:29:26,672
I think that's kind of in the scope of the NEXUS study that Teresa is currently writing up the RFP for, because I would end up considering a fusion of all those.

316
00:29:28,051 --> 00:29:33,879
Sorry, I'd like to, I mean, to illustrate where the fractional payments issue come in.

317
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:38,825
So, if you have you have a 10 unit property, then that's where it starts to kick and that's never.

318
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:42,601
to be affordable, which is one unit.

319
00:29:42,621 --> 00:29:48,085
You have 11 units, 10% of those is 1.1 units, which under the current policy ends up being rounded up to two.

320
00:29:48,606 --> 00:29:53,230
So if you want to build an 11 unit property, suddenly two of those have to be affordable under the current policy.

321
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:57,714
Want to build 13, same difference.

322
00:29:57,854 --> 00:30:00,096
It's 1.3 units, you have to build two of them to be affordable.

323
00:30:00,617 --> 00:30:05,321
So if you want to build a 13 unit property under a fractional incentive policy, it's

324
00:30:05,621 --> 00:30:22,084
It would be slightly more appealing because you would still have to build one affordable unit, but you can take the 0.3 and then basically take whatever 0.3 of an affordable unit would end up being and put that into the housing trust.

325
00:30:22,965 --> 00:30:33,767
Then developers would be strongly incentivized from building anything above nine units, and you would get more affordable units as a result of that, and you get money into the housing trust.

326
00:30:34,957 --> 00:30:38,158
So it's kind of a win-win for everybody.

327
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,100
Yes, Roberta.

328
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:50,002
Is there a timeline for the linkage nexus study?

329
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,543
That's on our agenda to give an update on.

330
00:30:53,663 --> 00:30:57,444
It is, right?

331
00:30:57,464 --> 00:30:57,924
Yeah, sort of.

332
00:30:59,444 --> 00:31:04,126
Katherine asked if I could maybe address it on our next agenda items at the end of it.

333
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:04,646
Yeah, OK.

334
00:31:06,112 --> 00:31:10,800
All right, does anybody else have any other questions for the council?

335
00:31:15,413 --> 00:31:33,767
So what I'm here, I just want to restate what I heard was the ask from the, from the resolution is just for this, for the affordable housing trust fund to have a conversation about the benefits of receiving, of adding a fractional payment.

336
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:44,695
And then may, and then if we all agree, weigh the benefits and the bonds benefits, then make the recommendation to the city council and then

337
00:31:45,957 --> 00:31:56,139
what I heard was maybe city staff is the one that will be making the, working on changing the ordinance and all of that.

338
00:31:56,179 --> 00:31:58,139
Like that, you're not asking us to do that.

339
00:31:58,659 --> 00:31:59,279
You're asking us.

340
00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:00,799
Well, draft language would be nice.

341
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,960
Okay.

342
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,060
It would save time.

343
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,640
Okay.

344
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:11,941
But usually it's like any changes would have to be introduced by a counselor.

345
00:32:11,961 --> 00:32:15,522
And we could like just use this paper to end up introducing

346
00:32:17,062 --> 00:32:18,583
language for the ordinance.

347
00:32:18,723 --> 00:32:39,259
If it needs to be referred to legal at that point, we could hand it to the solicitor, then at the same time refer it to the community development board who would go through their own process, potentially offer recommendations on it, go back to council, and then we would ordain it by a two-thirds vote.

348
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,422
Sorry, I did have one more question then.

349
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,583
Did the bonus

350
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:50,973
Um, inclusionary zoning get included in this last draft, like bonus, um, density.

351
00:32:50,993 --> 00:33:00,737
You came to us like a couple months ago and talked about like the rezoning progress and there were some bonus density percentages in that as well.

352
00:33:00,998 --> 00:33:01,218
Yes.

353
00:33:01,298 --> 00:33:05,940
We have, um, we added density bonuses the first time in our.

354
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:07,801
MBTA zoning overlay.

355
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:08,102
Okay.

356
00:33:08,422 --> 00:33:20,986
And the redevelopment that's happening or is before the community development board, the former Cathy site that one that 10 to 20, the Veer Beach Parkway is actually availing themselves to that.

357
00:33:21,146 --> 00:33:29,109
They're going to do a deeper affordability for a subset of their units in exchange for getting, I think it's an extra floor.

358
00:33:31,045 --> 00:33:33,187
But that was only for the MBTA overlay district.

359
00:33:33,307 --> 00:33:40,212
But we also added it to the Mystic Avenue Corridor District as well as the Salish Street Corridor District.

360
00:33:40,432 --> 00:33:47,878
So currently those three stand-alone districts have their own kind of rules.

361
00:33:51,348 --> 00:33:57,409
Yeah, those are separate overlay districts for density bonuses for affordable units in those districts only.

362
00:33:57,449 --> 00:34:01,750
So those would be separate from the inclusionary zoning percentages.

363
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:02,370
Okay, thanks.

364
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:07,931
And then one thing we thought about is we could eventually overhaul.

365
00:34:07,951 --> 00:34:10,512
We do want to change the inclusionary zoning.

366
00:34:10,952 --> 00:34:15,073
One of the things we wanted to change was to have fractional units and density bonuses.

367
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:18,594
It's going to take longer to get to this.

368
00:34:20,751 --> 00:34:24,513
We need revenue now to increase the housing production.

369
00:34:24,533 --> 00:34:29,895
It would make sense, low-hanging fruit, to just stop the crash limit.

370
00:34:30,075 --> 00:34:33,376
We would love to roll out the density bonuses citywide.

371
00:34:36,297 --> 00:34:37,478
Thank you.

372
00:34:38,678 --> 00:34:40,499
Thank you for the clarification.

373
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:41,439
I appreciate it.

374
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,822
If we're all set with this topic, we can go on to the next item on the agenda.

375
00:34:50,428 --> 00:34:53,649
Thank you all for your work.

376
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:54,830
Thank you.

377
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,570
Thank you.

378
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,371
It was nice seeing you.

379
00:34:57,671 --> 00:35:01,033
Okay, the CPA application.

380
00:35:01,753 --> 00:35:06,835
This here says that one of the staff is going to provide an update.

381
00:35:07,115 --> 00:35:13,978
Is one of the staff able to provide an update or I can certainly do it.

382
00:35:14,018 --> 00:35:18,000
Just to reintroduce myself to anybody who's watching or in the room.

383
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,842
Teresa Dupont, I'm the Community Preservation Act Manager for the City.

384
00:35:21,862 --> 00:35:26,905
I'm helping out running this meeting tonight, but my day job is to manage our program over there.

385
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:31,687
The Affordable Housing Trust has once again come to us for a tranche of funding.

386
00:35:32,228 --> 00:35:41,453
We have applications that we solicit annually, as well as we do have an off-cycle application for urgent or emergency needs.

387
00:35:42,548 --> 00:35:57,092
Pertaining to your application for fiscal 26 funding, the trust has asked for $550,000, which happens to align with our minimum that the CPA has set to spend in housing.

388
00:35:57,112 --> 00:36:06,975
Don't want to bore you with details, but CPA can only be spent on three different things, historic preservation, open space and recreation projects, like our park projects, and affordable housing.

389
00:36:07,015 --> 00:36:10,016
So every year we set a budget of how much we can

390
00:36:10,621 --> 00:36:14,803
set aside from our overall budget into each one of those buckets.

391
00:36:15,203 --> 00:36:23,226
This year we elected to increase our contribution to 25%, which equals $550,000, which is what you're asking for.

392
00:36:24,906 --> 00:36:28,608
So as an update to that, the application has been submitted and accepted.

393
00:36:29,668 --> 00:36:32,469
There are presentations that all grant applicants must do.

394
00:36:32,509 --> 00:36:33,229
So you are scheduled for November 18.

395
00:36:38,158 --> 00:36:40,860
I will also send along a courtesy invite to everybody.

396
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:45,424
But Tuesday, November 18th, that is not the week of Thanksgiving.

397
00:36:45,464 --> 00:36:46,304
It's the one before.

398
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,728
Similar to how you meet at the trust, we meet hybridly.

399
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:55,191
So folks can certainly join via Zoom or join us in person.

400
00:36:55,231 --> 00:37:00,315
But there will just be a small presentation to the committee to support the funding request.

401
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:02,437
It'll be very similar to the one

402
00:37:02,975 --> 00:37:11,141
that was presented to the committee last year, because I don't think at this point we have really finite projects, but y'all need money, and we're a funding source.

403
00:37:11,441 --> 00:37:17,166
So happy to answer any specific questions folks may have, but that's just kind of a general overview.

404
00:37:17,546 --> 00:37:18,847
Application's good, accepted.

405
00:37:20,028 --> 00:37:23,210
Our voting on our decision-making will be in December.

406
00:37:23,831 --> 00:37:30,936
So you'll be informed in December where that funding request lands.

407
00:37:32,447 --> 00:37:34,669
Um, I do not speak on behalf of the committee.

408
00:37:34,689 --> 00:37:36,071
I think it was a good application.

409
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:40,495
We've funded you before we're, we're very much in partnership with the affordable housing trust.

410
00:37:40,515 --> 00:37:44,119
So I think it will be a favorable outcome.

411
00:37:44,539 --> 00:37:48,443
Um, we do have, this is probably our most competitive round.

412
00:37:48,463 --> 00:37:52,547
Just want to share with everybody, our most competitive round since I've been there.

413
00:37:52,607 --> 00:37:54,910
Certainly, um, we have a budget of about 2 million.

414
00:37:55,892 --> 00:37:59,233
And right now, we're about 3.9 million in requests.

415
00:37:59,413 --> 00:38:02,894
So we will be breaking some hearts this year.

416
00:38:04,155 --> 00:38:06,616
But just as a brief update as to CPA.

417
00:38:06,636 --> 00:38:14,198
So hopefully, even if you don't need to be there to speak, I mean, I think Lisa and Kathleen have kind of fleshed out who will be running that.

418
00:38:14,218 --> 00:38:17,079
But we would love to have you all join to help support if you can.

419
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:19,940
I know evenings after work can be tough.

420
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,801
But you're obviously all invited to come and support that.

421
00:38:23,622 --> 00:38:24,702
Any questions in particular?

422
00:38:26,577 --> 00:38:27,637
Thank you for the update.

423
00:38:27,837 --> 00:38:39,161
I think, um, just one, any follow up on the discussion that we had with them in the joint meeting regarding, um, standardizing percentages or things like that going forward.

424
00:38:39,181 --> 00:38:42,622
Um, not as of yet, but, um, I think.

425
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:51,025
We're in, since we're in our funding round, the next three meetings, um, so the rest of the year will be pretty much devoted to reviewing our funding.

426
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:52,494
applications.

427
00:38:53,034 --> 00:39:02,657
This is a great topic for us to address in our January-February meetings, which is typically when we re-evaluate how the funding round went, see if there's any opportunities for improvements.

428
00:39:03,757 --> 00:39:05,258
So those would be great discussions.

429
00:39:05,338 --> 00:39:07,278
And again, it's a public meeting.

430
00:39:07,338 --> 00:39:08,038
Everybody's welcome.

431
00:39:08,058 --> 00:39:12,380
But we can certainly set up a formal invite to have any members that want to join us.

432
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:17,141
But that'll be something we'll flesh out late winter, early spring.

433
00:39:17,761 --> 00:39:18,421
Thank you.

434
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:18,961
Thank you.

435
00:39:19,021 --> 00:39:19,602
That's a great question.

436
00:39:19,642 --> 00:39:20,022
Thank you.

437
00:39:20,042 --> 00:39:20,722
Great question.

438
00:39:21,387 --> 00:39:26,891
which I have a follow-up question, as you could see my brain thinking.

439
00:39:28,472 --> 00:39:32,554
Should there be joint minutes for that meeting?

440
00:39:32,674 --> 00:39:35,876
Should the trust, because that was a joint meeting.

441
00:39:35,896 --> 00:39:40,079
I was intending to write up meeting minutes.

442
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:48,365
I will check with our legal counsel on whether, since we were hosting it, like do you all need to accept it?

443
00:39:49,341 --> 00:39:50,422
I'm sorry, I keep saying y'all.

444
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:52,743
Yeah, no, no, no, that's fine.

445
00:39:52,903 --> 00:40:02,309
Because I know you, we did the joint meeting and then we adjourned that meeting and then you did another.

446
00:40:02,389 --> 00:40:03,910
Yeah, we rolled into our CPC meeting.

447
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:08,592
I think we might need to be at least have that on record.

448
00:40:08,652 --> 00:40:08,913
Yes.

449
00:40:09,893 --> 00:40:14,736
So we will be meeting CPC meets on the 14th of October.

450
00:40:14,756 --> 00:40:18,118
I feel like that's a quick, easy agenda item I can get in there.

451
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:23,423
But I'll also check with our legal counsel because it's unprecedented for me and I should have that answer.

452
00:40:23,483 --> 00:40:24,524
So thank you for flagging me.

453
00:40:25,124 --> 00:40:26,725
It was just thought of it.

454
00:40:26,805 --> 00:40:28,086
I didn't even think of it.

455
00:40:28,106 --> 00:40:31,248
Yeah, it was in the back of my mind of like, I should do those minutes.

456
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:36,672
I think just the CPS, but I will legally confirm where that should land.

457
00:40:36,712 --> 00:40:37,292
Thank you for that.

458
00:40:37,372 --> 00:40:37,693
Awesome.

459
00:40:37,773 --> 00:40:38,193
Thank you.

460
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:47,420
All right, item number six on the agenda is the five-year action plan update timeline for plan submission to the City Council.

461
00:40:48,061 --> 00:40:59,907
Updates we discussed in previous meetings we've made to the action plan, and we will likely submit the plan to the City Council in January.

462
00:41:00,407 --> 00:41:05,190
The goal, if memory serves correctly and the reason why we're holding off,

463
00:41:05,949 --> 00:41:14,994
is we want to get a picture of the Fellsway West development on our cover page.

464
00:41:15,214 --> 00:41:17,815
Am I misremembering?

465
00:41:17,835 --> 00:41:24,839
I agree we would ideally like to have that.

466
00:41:25,299 --> 00:41:33,203
Is it worth holding the action plan back from presenting it to city council until then?

467
00:41:37,665 --> 00:41:38,526
I didn't understand.

468
00:41:38,546 --> 00:41:40,608
We voted on it.

469
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:43,210
I thought we said we'd like it.

470
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,431
I don't think we said we must.

471
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:46,933
I think we voted to be included.

472
00:41:47,932 --> 00:41:49,373
We should look back.

473
00:41:49,953 --> 00:42:00,517
I asked actually for Catherine, I had a conversation with her about what we actually voted on the last time or if we voted on the action plan.

474
00:42:00,537 --> 00:42:11,122
And what she recalled was that we said, let's come back this month because we were making some changes, including a couple of substantive ones.

475
00:42:11,182 --> 00:42:13,403
So those substantive changes have been made.

476
00:42:15,364 --> 00:42:18,285
And some minor formatting changes have been made.

477
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:23,008
So what I think what we said was that we would approve it this month.

478
00:42:23,688 --> 00:42:29,731
Pending the with with just adding the photograph after we approve it this month.

479
00:42:30,092 --> 00:42:30,352
Yeah.

480
00:42:30,972 --> 00:42:35,975
So that the only change after our approval now is to make the cover.

481
00:42:40,696 --> 00:42:41,797
Thank you for the reminder.

482
00:42:41,817 --> 00:42:50,022
I thought we voted on it, but lots of conversations about whether or not to vote to approve as amended or vote to wait.

483
00:42:50,262 --> 00:43:06,192
So I guess, does anybody have any strong feelings about whether or not we should wait for and get a picture of the development of Eiffel's Way or submit?

484
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:10,095
My thought is, what if they have to push it back more?

485
00:43:10,727 --> 00:43:15,908
you know, because of delays, then it delays submitting the plan.

486
00:43:15,928 --> 00:43:27,071
I was going to say, I think even like a partially finished in action photo would be fine.

487
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:27,451
Yeah.

488
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:29,652
Honestly, whenever I'm sorry.

489
00:43:29,812 --> 00:43:30,872
Yeah.

490
00:43:30,992 --> 00:43:37,934
CPC side anytime I've been advertising those were less they have some really fun like renderings that I've been using because, you know, construction blueprints.

491
00:43:38,034 --> 00:43:38,314
Yeah.

492
00:43:38,713 --> 00:43:42,616
you know, there are some collateral images out there.

493
00:43:43,297 --> 00:43:43,537
Yeah.

494
00:43:43,637 --> 00:43:45,359
It doesn't have to be the actual thing.

495
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:46,660
It could be the design.

496
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:52,985
I have strong feelings that I'd like to roll this out with fanfare as soon as possible.

497
00:43:53,005 --> 00:44:02,573
This is like the two big firsts for this committee are funding our first project and completing this plan that we spent a year writing.

498
00:44:03,353 --> 00:44:04,414
And so we can, it would be,

499
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:13,068
perfect if we could put a ribbon cutting on the photo that we submit to city council.

500
00:44:13,128 --> 00:44:23,514
But like you said, a nearly finished photo of the building would also say that, and we can later sneak in a change.

501
00:44:24,994 --> 00:44:32,538
But I would love to be able to post the final version on our website and present it to city council.

502
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:34,740
So

503
00:44:36,535 --> 00:44:38,378
Do I, is that an emotion?

504
00:44:38,398 --> 00:44:47,891
I make a motion to accept the final housing trust action plan.

505
00:44:51,383 --> 00:44:59,066
I'll just offer one friendly amendment and I will, let's delegate picture approval to Roberta.

506
00:44:59,627 --> 00:45:04,029
She's the master of the document.

507
00:45:04,829 --> 00:45:10,431
I believe you'll be able to find a photo that works for the front so we don't have to re-evaluate it again.

508
00:45:10,811 --> 00:45:11,172
Okay.

509
00:45:11,392 --> 00:45:16,294
I'd like clarification for that motion.

510
00:45:16,314 --> 00:45:18,775
Do we need to add in a timeline into that motion?

511
00:45:20,066 --> 00:45:21,086
It's just on the agenda.

512
00:45:21,126 --> 00:45:23,607
So it's like update and timeline for plan submissions.

513
00:45:24,728 --> 00:45:35,691
I think that so I think we could vote to approve the final and then we can have a discussion about when can we get this to City Council?

514
00:45:35,971 --> 00:45:38,472
And I don't think we need to ask for City Council's approval.

515
00:45:38,532 --> 00:45:41,393
We're just giving it to them for informational purposes.

516
00:45:44,471 --> 00:45:57,769
All right, so the motion as I heard it is, there's been a motion made to accept the final version of the five year action plan five year affordable housing action plan for.

517
00:46:03,095 --> 00:46:06,158
How am I going to say it?

518
00:46:06,178 --> 00:46:08,580
And Roberta's choice of pictures.

519
00:46:09,681 --> 00:46:12,744
Roberta's pending cover.

520
00:46:12,804 --> 00:46:13,084
Yes.

521
00:46:13,184 --> 00:46:15,366
Pending cover designed by Roberta.

522
00:46:15,386 --> 00:46:15,986
There we go.

523
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:19,069
Pending cover designed by Roberta.

524
00:46:19,089 --> 00:46:20,490
There is a motion there.

525
00:46:20,991 --> 00:46:22,312
Do I hear a second?

526
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:23,653
Second.

527
00:46:24,894 --> 00:46:25,595
Come see it go.

528
00:46:29,475 --> 00:46:29,995
Okay.

529
00:46:30,055 --> 00:46:32,957
So we do not need to actually do a roll call.

530
00:46:33,497 --> 00:46:35,778
All in favor say aye.

531
00:46:36,198 --> 00:46:36,759
Aye.

532
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:38,019
There we go.

533
00:46:43,362 --> 00:46:46,504
I probably should have asked this before we approved the plan.

534
00:46:50,237 --> 00:46:51,618
I have a really minor question.

535
00:46:51,678 --> 00:46:59,661
If anybody has looked at the plan, is there anything that you dislike about the formatting, color scheme, or anything?

536
00:46:59,782 --> 00:47:03,863
Did you find it hard to read?

537
00:47:06,325 --> 00:47:15,529
I will again offer my sincerest appreciation to Roberta for, I mean, she did it.

538
00:47:16,523 --> 00:47:17,544
Thank you, Roberta.

539
00:47:17,904 --> 00:47:22,367
That was a lot of work and a lot of data and going in and put a lot of this rubbish.

540
00:47:22,447 --> 00:47:22,987
So thank you.

541
00:47:23,127 --> 00:47:24,989
Really appreciate the work that you did on that.

542
00:47:26,129 --> 00:47:40,578
So the part two of the conversation, I do not think we need a vote more so than we just need to talk to, we would like to talk to staff about when can we get it to the city council.

543
00:47:42,479 --> 00:47:44,361
They meet October the 7th.

544
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:52,004
which is next Tuesday and then meeting after that.

545
00:47:52,084 --> 00:47:58,809
So we could scramble certainly to get it onto the agenda that is pending the mayor's office.

546
00:47:58,829 --> 00:48:03,713
There's just procedures on how to get things onto the agenda.

547
00:48:04,593 --> 00:48:09,037
And then I believe the next time they meet again will be the 21st of October.

548
00:48:10,015 --> 00:48:19,339
So best case scenario, we can work on getting it onto next Tuesday's council agenda, but more realistically, it would probably land on the October 21st agenda.

549
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:24,421
But I know we want to try and get this through, so I'll ask.

550
00:48:25,741 --> 00:48:28,603
I anticipate Catherine will be out for the rest of the week, so I'm happy to.

551
00:48:28,983 --> 00:48:29,943
Yes.

552
00:48:30,924 --> 00:48:34,545
If nobody has any objections, I'm fine with waiting until October.

553
00:48:34,565 --> 00:48:37,806
It's still before January, right?

554
00:48:39,848 --> 00:48:44,551
getting things on and moving things, I know can be cumbersome.

555
00:48:44,731 --> 00:48:49,155
So if there's no objections, October 21st would work.

556
00:48:50,115 --> 00:48:57,921
If I may ask as well, would representatives from this trust, the trustees be in attendance as well, be available, somebody?

557
00:48:58,361 --> 00:49:00,062
Yeah, I think I will.

558
00:49:01,003 --> 00:49:03,485
I'll say yes, as the chair.

559
00:49:03,605 --> 00:49:06,507
I won't volunteer anybody else, but welcome to have them.

560
00:49:09,917 --> 00:49:13,980
I anticipate that they will have questions, active questions, constructive.

561
00:49:15,461 --> 00:49:16,361
I don't know.

562
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:18,602
Maybe not that way.

563
00:49:18,702 --> 00:49:19,563
I can be there.

564
00:49:20,063 --> 00:49:23,766
And I'd love to talk about data all day long.

565
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:34,152
I would really very happily defer to talk about the trust policy choices that we made as a group.

566
00:49:34,292 --> 00:49:39,195
I think that you'd be the best person to represent that.

567
00:49:40,568 --> 00:49:42,729
just in case they have to get out of place.

568
00:49:42,829 --> 00:49:46,350
I'm in love with it.

569
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:52,092
All right, item number seven, the loan.

570
00:49:53,252 --> 00:50:02,455
Medford Community Housing loan update and discussion of terms on the topic of 703 Felsbury West.

571
00:50:02,495 --> 00:50:08,637
City staff and I have been working, it is late, I was like, did I do this?

572
00:50:09,947 --> 00:50:17,792
City staff and I have been working with the city attorneys regarding putting together the loan documents for the Medford Community Housing.

573
00:50:18,192 --> 00:50:20,274
Documents have been shared with the board.

574
00:50:20,754 --> 00:50:26,358
Does anybody have any questions or comments about the terms, conditions of the loans that they've been drafted?

575
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:43,606
Yeah, so has everybody been able to take a sneak a peek at the mortgage, the loan, the loan note, as well as the loan agreement?

576
00:50:43,846 --> 00:50:44,127
Yes.

577
00:50:45,768 --> 00:50:49,390
And does anybody have any questions, comments?

578
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:54,033
We do have paper copies as well of everything.

579
00:50:57,378 --> 00:51:04,580
And just as a reminder, I think before it's always nice to be alive and then color.

580
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:05,040
When is the.

581
00:51:26,805 --> 00:51:29,887
It's a really bad one.

582
00:51:31,348 --> 00:51:31,889
It's a wedding.

583
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:34,130
It's a wedding.

584
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:35,751
Oh, that's so exciting.

585
00:51:35,911 --> 00:51:38,593
She's not a happy camper.

586
00:51:38,613 --> 00:51:43,837
She's discreet because Teresa and I sit next to the nurse's office, and the kids come in for their vaccination.

587
00:51:43,917 --> 00:51:45,018
It's like, bless her, bless her.

588
00:51:45,038 --> 00:51:45,138
Yeah.

589
00:51:51,330 --> 00:52:17,033
just a little reminder i know it's in the meetings uh in the minutes but we did vote um to approve a hundred thousand dollar award as a loan with a two percent interest rate with payments based on a 25 cash flow the first payment will be due a year after the units are fully occupied and the city staff will work about it and it does that but

590
00:52:17,741 --> 00:52:21,202
The rest is like normal, but it's really the term.

591
00:52:21,262 --> 00:52:22,063
So it is $100,000.

592
00:52:22,183 --> 00:52:22,843
It's 2%.

593
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:28,025
It is 25% based out of cash flow.

594
00:52:29,186 --> 00:52:31,987
And the first payment is due at occupancy.

595
00:52:32,147 --> 00:52:43,632
I am saying that because I saw something that in the loan promissory notes that maybe it wasn't exactly that.

596
00:52:45,072 --> 00:52:49,675
Does anybody have any questions, comments, or do you want to chat?

597
00:52:49,695 --> 00:52:52,576
Yeah, if you want to start with a promissory note for the chair.

598
00:52:53,357 --> 00:53:02,281
Yes, I think the interest payment amount should probably be specified that we're talking about the 25% cash flow in this.

599
00:53:02,361 --> 00:53:02,842
I'm not.

600
00:53:04,302 --> 00:53:05,103
We'll start there.

601
00:53:05,123 --> 00:53:06,844
Yeah, I'm not sure that it was.

602
00:53:10,226 --> 00:53:12,667
They talk about an interest payment start date.

603
00:53:13,047 --> 00:53:13,728
They do have the 2%.

604
00:53:16,799 --> 00:53:18,280
annual interest.

605
00:53:22,141 --> 00:53:33,226
So I think there should just be a definition added what the interest payment is on top of the interest rate.

606
00:53:34,287 --> 00:53:45,632
And I suppose if the interest payment is not enough to actually pay for the full accrual of interest, there might need to be an additional accrual going forward.

607
00:53:46,048 --> 00:53:52,674
So I think those are a couple main points that we should add to the promissory note.

608
00:53:53,175 --> 00:53:56,418
You also did it as simple interest.

609
00:53:56,678 --> 00:53:57,158
Oh, correct.

610
00:53:57,178 --> 00:53:58,179
Simple interest.

611
00:53:58,219 --> 00:53:59,040
Simple interest.

612
00:53:59,120 --> 00:53:59,160
OK.

613
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:05,246
So it wouldn't be compounded on the interest that you didn't pay last year, but it could still be accrued separately.

614
00:54:05,366 --> 00:54:05,907
Exactly.

615
00:54:05,947 --> 00:54:06,447
Exactly.

616
00:54:06,467 --> 00:54:07,088
Correct.

617
00:54:07,128 --> 00:54:09,490
That would be helpful to share.

618
00:54:10,142 --> 00:54:12,183
This, yeah, it works.

619
00:54:13,164 --> 00:54:20,569
I'm just looking because Catherine and I were doing a lot of back and forth along on the loan language.

620
00:54:20,629 --> 00:54:24,371
And I remember going, that sounds perfect, but I don't think it was this.

621
00:54:24,391 --> 00:54:28,774
But I could provide.

622
00:54:49,947 --> 00:54:54,369
So does anybody else have any questions?

623
00:54:54,489 --> 00:55:00,293
I feel like we should talk to Catherine about the language here.

624
00:55:00,393 --> 00:55:03,755
Ask for a legal point of view.

625
00:55:03,795 --> 00:55:08,717
I know there was a lot of back and forth with the legal about what happens if they don't have cash flow.

626
00:55:09,678 --> 00:55:12,819
And if they don't have cash flow, they don't have a payment owed.

627
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:18,122
Or when they do have cash flow, that's when they start making the payments.

628
00:55:20,545 --> 00:55:25,347
Can't find it in my emails to grab my apologies for back and forth.

629
00:55:26,007 --> 00:55:28,909
And we talked about like, what is cashflow?

630
00:55:29,889 --> 00:55:31,770
What is- Yeah, it should be defined somewhere.

631
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:34,131
Exactly, the operating expenses.

632
00:55:34,751 --> 00:55:37,412
So we'll go back.

633
00:55:39,173 --> 00:55:41,374
I'll also go back with Catherine on this.

634
00:55:41,394 --> 00:55:44,075
So I have a question.

635
00:55:49,435 --> 00:55:54,700
kind of off of that, like, regarding defining what the cash flow is, right?

636
00:55:54,800 --> 00:56:10,594
And how do we know if they're, if they have cash flow, do they have to, like, report, like, with a business, you have to report how much you make every year, like, you know?

637
00:56:11,395 --> 00:56:13,157
Yeah, there's usually some sort of audit.

638
00:56:13,528 --> 00:56:15,429
or unaudited financial statements.

639
00:56:15,489 --> 00:56:18,890
I'm not sure how far this organization can go.

640
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:24,953
There's also usually a regulatory agreement that goes along with some of these affordable housing developments.

641
00:56:25,333 --> 00:56:32,957
And that usually gets more into what is cash flow, what income is included, what expenses are included, and how you get to a number.

642
00:56:33,457 --> 00:56:35,918
So this is kind of just the loan documents.

643
00:56:36,198 --> 00:56:38,359
And usually there's maybe one other missing piece

644
00:56:38,779 --> 00:56:39,960
which they might already have.

645
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:51,410
I was just going to say, I wonder if we can ask them for copies of their home, because they got home money.

646
00:56:52,551 --> 00:56:54,292
I wonder what those terms were.

647
00:56:54,372 --> 00:56:56,634
I think we may have a copy of their home.

648
00:56:58,055 --> 00:57:04,861
We can look at the terms to see if that was a cash flow payment, probably that was.

649
00:57:05,432 --> 00:57:07,133
And maybe just mirror that.

650
00:57:07,153 --> 00:57:09,433
We should refer to that affordable housing.

651
00:57:09,473 --> 00:57:09,873
Exactly.

652
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:10,294
Yeah.

653
00:57:10,374 --> 00:57:13,835
And then we could all be using the same calculation for cash flow.

654
00:57:13,895 --> 00:57:15,215
That way they're not doing it twice.

655
00:57:15,235 --> 00:57:18,596
Because if I remember correctly, they do not do an all-candle audit.

656
00:57:19,677 --> 00:57:21,277
But it's not an organization.

657
00:57:21,297 --> 00:57:23,518
No, but they should do it of the property.

658
00:57:23,538 --> 00:57:24,618
They should do it of the property.

659
00:57:30,927 --> 00:57:47,976
So we had simple interest, accrual of unpaid interest annually, maybe a specific definition of payment since we're linking it to 25% of cash flow.

660
00:57:54,419 --> 00:58:00,022
And then I think also if we wanted to talk about the interest payment start date,

661
00:58:01,569 --> 00:58:04,992
So as it's drafted right now, it doesn't say.

662
00:58:07,514 --> 00:58:08,294
It doesn't say.

663
00:58:08,314 --> 00:58:12,037
It says interest payment start date and therefore after.

664
00:58:12,057 --> 00:58:17,201
On the date that all three units have been constructed and rented.

665
00:58:17,221 --> 00:58:18,482
Where's that?

666
00:58:18,922 --> 00:58:22,265
So right before interest payment start date.

667
00:58:22,385 --> 00:58:23,386
Oh, there we go.

668
00:58:23,406 --> 00:58:25,988
All units have been constructed and rented.

669
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:31,660
the borrower shall pay interest of 2% per year, but only after the first year.

670
00:58:33,122 --> 00:58:34,042
It does say that.

671
00:58:34,162 --> 00:58:39,467
I mean, they can't say it does start paid until we know when they're actually going to be fully paid.

672
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:40,067
Yeah.

673
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:43,430
OK.

674
00:58:47,853 --> 00:58:48,294
Any other?

675
00:58:48,314 --> 00:58:53,118
Kayla, if it's OK, I may move you into a conversation.

676
00:58:53,138 --> 00:58:53,578
Yeah, of course.

677
00:58:58,519 --> 00:59:01,380
Do you want to pick up any of the other documents as well?

678
00:59:01,701 --> 00:59:04,182
Yes.

679
00:59:04,842 --> 00:59:11,846
On the mortgage document, I picked up what might be a typo.

680
00:59:11,946 --> 00:59:12,726
I'm not sure.

681
00:59:12,746 --> 00:59:28,094
It said, under affordable housing restrictions, and it makes reference to the Medway Redevelopment Authority

682
00:59:28,825 --> 00:59:33,207
as agent and represented to the North Suburban Consortium.

683
00:59:33,227 --> 00:59:35,148
I don't think many of those.

684
00:59:35,348 --> 00:59:35,668
Yeah.

685
00:59:36,329 --> 00:59:36,669
Yeah.

686
00:59:36,689 --> 00:59:38,430
It would make more sense.

687
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:40,811
Yeah.

688
00:59:40,851 --> 00:59:42,472
Yeah.

689
00:59:43,692 --> 00:59:44,032
Yeah.

690
00:59:44,292 --> 00:59:46,794
Well, yeah.

691
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:49,275
The loan agreement talks to it says to Maldon.

692
00:59:49,295 --> 00:59:50,335
Yeah.

693
00:59:51,996 --> 00:59:52,196
Yeah.

694
00:59:52,236 --> 00:59:57,799
Referring to the restriction that I didn't even think to look up the rate that we

695
00:59:58,172 --> 00:59:59,033
the restriction.

696
01:00:02,135 --> 01:00:13,705
Anyways, we want to double check, but I think that's what we want to double check is the restriction is the restriction that is referred to in that section.

697
01:00:14,125 --> 01:00:14,786
What was it done?

698
01:00:24,939 --> 01:00:26,781
Anybody else notice anything else in the red?

699
01:00:52,999 --> 01:00:54,620
We're some insurance requirements.

700
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,761
They don't think we're onerous, but.

701
01:01:02,244 --> 01:01:10,288
At the time of the closing and we're not, I guess larger question, we're going to have like an actual closing or we just kind of.

702
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:18,302
finishing these documents and sending them money because there's usually like a larger construction loan closing or permanent loan closing.

703
01:01:18,322 --> 01:01:21,583
This is fairly small and like subordinate.

704
01:01:21,603 --> 01:01:34,488
So if there's not going to be like a process of loan closing, I think the insurance certificates should probably be sent to staff and just ensure that they are compliant with requirements.

705
01:01:37,349 --> 01:01:37,669
Thanks.

706
01:01:52,284 --> 01:01:53,085
Oh, no, they have it, right.

707
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:53,265
Medway?

708
01:01:53,285 --> 01:01:53,525
Maldonets.

709
01:01:53,545 --> 01:01:53,765
Maldonets.

710
01:01:53,785 --> 01:01:54,005

Maldonets.

733

Maldonets.

734

735

Maldonets.

736

Maldonets.

737
01:02:03,831 --> 01:02:04,011
Maldonets.

738

Maldonets.

739
01:02:04,232 --> 01:02:04,452
Maldonets.

740
01:02:04,472 --> 01:02:04,652
Maldonets.

741
01:02:04,672 --> 01:02:04,852
Maldonets.

742
01:02:04,872 --> 01:02:06,253
Maldonets.

743
01:02:10,436 --> 01:02:10,616
Maldonets.

744
01:02:11,856 --> 01:02:12,077
Maldonets.

745
01:02:12,097 --> 01:02:12,337
Maldonets.

746
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:16,259
Maldonets.

747
01:02:16,279 --> 01:02:16,479
Maldonets.

748
01:02:20,142 --> 01:02:20,342
Maldonets.

749
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:20,622
Maldonets.

750
01:02:20,642 --> 01:02:20,662
M

751
01:02:21,253 --> 01:02:22,234
One more section.

752
01:02:22,894 --> 01:02:26,857
On the mortgage?

753
01:02:27,237 --> 01:02:28,138
Not on the mortgage.

754
01:02:28,518 --> 01:02:30,720
So if there are any other questions on the mortgage, I can hold.

755
01:02:51,320 --> 01:03:00,723
Can we just ask them to double check under the affordable housing restriction?

756
01:03:02,084 --> 01:03:02,344
Yes.

757
01:03:02,804 --> 01:03:06,865
I'm looking at the restriction and it has referred to Metro Community Housing.

758
01:03:07,405 --> 01:03:12,207
Oh, I think that's not the developer, Metro Community Housing and Grand Tour.

759
01:03:12,927 --> 01:03:16,708
But the other side of it, I think you understand, I think it did say

760
01:03:17,466 --> 01:03:29,530
They both said it said that, um, you're looking at the actual restriction on the, yeah, here to mold and redevelopment authority at the end was they're both grantors.

761
01:03:33,591 --> 01:03:39,893
Hey, like the signature page at the end or yeah, we weren't here, but maybe just if there's we ask it to the.

762
01:03:42,809 --> 01:03:48,572
Because the mortgage is actually with Medford Community Housing, and so therefore, shh.

763
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:52,013
Who signs that?

764
01:03:52,634 --> 01:03:53,454
Treasurer.

765
01:03:55,395 --> 01:03:57,296
Medford Community Housing is signing that.

766
01:03:57,456 --> 01:03:57,876
Yeah.

767
01:03:58,877 --> 01:03:59,977
I think it should be met.

768
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:05,600
But there should be a counterparty that you're giving the restriction to.

769
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:10,162
In favor of the lender and Medford Development Housing.

770
01:04:11,127 --> 01:04:12,768
as agent or representatives.

771
01:04:14,049 --> 01:04:14,649
Yeah, I am.

772
01:04:15,729 --> 01:04:17,670
Malden, yeah, Malden Redevelopment Authority.

773
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:18,311
Yeah.

774
01:04:18,571 --> 01:04:21,292
As agent and representative of the North Suburban Consortium.

775
01:04:21,412 --> 01:04:25,534
Yeah, I think, I think, I think that was just such a great a typo.

776
01:04:25,574 --> 01:04:25,955
Yes.

777
01:04:27,035 --> 01:04:28,336
Medway instead of Malden.

778
01:04:28,356 --> 01:04:29,056
Yeah.

779
01:04:29,316 --> 01:04:33,518
Or you could just refer to the deed restriction and don't even have to do all of that.

780
01:04:33,558 --> 01:04:39,221
You would just say the deed restriction recorded at the middle of sex registry of deeds and we found that broken page.

781
01:04:39,521 --> 01:04:39,742
Yeah.

782
01:04:39,782 --> 01:04:40,422
Keep it simple.

783
01:04:41,212 --> 01:04:43,674
Sure, I'm just get striking granted by borrower.

784
01:04:44,114 --> 01:04:46,776
Yeah, I would just keep it.

785
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:52,580
Just providing that legal is okay with that.

786
01:04:52,741 --> 01:04:53,241
Yeah.

787
01:04:54,042 --> 01:04:56,003
Great.

788
01:04:57,184 --> 01:04:57,704
Thank you.

789
01:04:57,724 --> 01:04:59,245
So low agreements.

790
01:05:01,187 --> 01:05:01,327
Yes.

791
01:05:11,156 --> 01:05:11,976
Most of sections 3.2.

792
01:05:12,777 --> 01:05:23,123
The signature page, do you want to change the signature page on the mortgage?

793
01:05:24,183 --> 01:05:27,125
It is Medford Redevelopment Authorization.

794
01:05:27,165 --> 01:05:29,946
We want it to be Medford Community Housing.

795
01:05:34,649 --> 01:05:37,390
I think this is... That's the consent to mortgage.

796
01:05:37,951 --> 01:05:38,691
Yeah, yeah.

797
01:05:38,711 --> 01:05:39,131
So that's the...

798
01:05:40,988 --> 01:05:45,969
primary, they're consenting to a subordinate loan, I believe is what they're doing.

799
01:05:48,249 --> 01:05:48,589
Okay.

800
01:05:48,689 --> 01:05:49,709
Don't forget that.

801
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:50,150
I'm sorry.

802
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:50,370
Okay.

803
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:51,550
I was looking at it.

804
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:56,151
No worries.

805
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:56,151
3.2?

806
01:05:56,431 --> 01:05:56,731
Yeah, 3.2.

807
01:05:57,371 --> 01:06:03,012
I think these were, again, normal for the big construction closing.

808
01:06:03,052 --> 01:06:09,173
I'm not sure if we want to just specify that most of these have been, most or all have already been met.

809
01:06:11,305 --> 01:06:24,276
Um, I think again, legal committee weigh in and just cross them off and, you know, say, you know, we all agree and represent and warranty that these conditions have already been met.

810
01:06:24,917 --> 01:06:27,019
Um, so we don't have like a missing and.

811
01:06:27,419 --> 01:06:34,385
Because I think normally you would want to see all of this before you get the money.

812
01:06:35,926 --> 01:06:36,527
And then I think.

813
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:51,639
And then I think the certificates of occupancy, which is on page four.

814
01:06:51,659 --> 01:06:59,984
I'm not sure that they have that until after this is going to happen anyway.

815
01:07:00,325 --> 01:07:03,847
So I think that one might be one that we might need to remove.

816
01:07:16,749 --> 01:07:16,989
Okay.

817
01:07:30,711 --> 01:07:31,312
I don't know.

818
01:07:31,452 --> 01:07:43,294
I feel like the submission, the COs show that they actually did the job and it's the... Yeah, but I was just saying that these are conditions to close out the loan, not... Oh, okay.

819
01:07:43,314 --> 01:07:44,834
So yeah, that's a good answer.

820
01:07:45,234 --> 01:07:45,594
So I think

821
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,561
they won't be able to give us a certificate of occupancy at the time of the closing.

822
01:08:11,805 --> 01:08:15,006
That was it for me.

823
01:08:15,386 --> 01:08:15,846
Thank you.

824
01:08:15,886 --> 01:08:16,526
No problem.

825
01:08:19,267 --> 01:08:21,788
And so there's a focus on the television.

826
01:08:23,389 --> 01:08:25,250
That's where they get you, Lisa.

827
01:08:25,631 --> 01:08:29,213
That's where they get you in all representations and warranties.

828
01:08:29,313 --> 01:08:32,456
I have other people, too, for televisions.

829
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:33,677
All right.

830
01:08:33,877 --> 01:08:39,241
Anybody else have any other comments, feedback that we've gotten?

831
01:08:39,441 --> 01:08:39,821
Okay.

832
01:08:48,942 --> 01:08:49,482
Thank you.

833
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:49,802
Thank you.

834
01:08:49,982 --> 01:08:54,805
Please express appreciation to the legal department for doing all of that.

835
01:08:54,825 --> 01:08:57,026
Thank you.

836
01:08:57,046 --> 01:09:05,209
Okay, continuing talking about a continuation of conversation about funding cycles.

837
01:09:06,130 --> 01:09:12,893
The board may continue discussing the discussion from August meeting about how to proceed with issuing

838
01:09:13,481 --> 01:09:21,145
future rounds of funding, including whether or not to accept applications on a rolling basis throughout the year or a time schedule.

839
01:09:22,726 --> 01:09:36,332
In my conversations with Penny when she was telling me she was going to be here, she reminded me that our declaration of trust actually lays out how we're going to accept applications.

840
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:40,695
And I think it does say rolling basis on that.

841
01:09:41,851 --> 01:09:43,912
I think it does say rolling basis.

842
01:09:44,252 --> 01:09:51,875
I think it says both that we can issue RFPs from time to time for annual funding, but then it does say also rolling basis.

843
01:09:51,895 --> 01:09:57,938
So we kind of gave ourselves both, I guess, is how I... Excellent.

844
01:09:58,158 --> 01:09:59,298
I wonder who drafted it.

845
01:09:59,318 --> 01:10:02,480
All right.

846
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:09,843
So I think this discussion point is actually closed and we're all set with this one.

847
01:10:10,626 --> 01:10:15,489
I don't think we need to vote on it because it's already, we voted on it in our declaration, right?

848
01:10:15,989 --> 01:10:16,349
Yeah.

849
01:10:16,830 --> 01:10:29,717
Okay, proposed meeting schedule for the upcoming year based on conversations from previous meetings, the board would continue to meet the first Wednesday of every month at six o'clock with a few exceptions as previously discussed.

850
01:10:30,558 --> 01:10:35,381
Recommendation to meet only via Zoom in December of 2020, yeah, 2025.

851
01:10:38,247 --> 01:10:40,469
At least I thought we were in 26 already.

852
01:10:44,812 --> 01:10:51,337
Recommendation to meet in June and on Zoom in December of 25.

853
01:10:51,857 --> 01:11:05,888
The meeting for June of 26 would serve as our social gathering, so no meeting per se, so no trusted topics being discussed more, get to know you, how's everything going.

854
01:11:06,439 --> 01:11:07,860
When did you say that was?

855
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:08,520
June of 26.

856
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:09,881
I don't know.

857
01:11:10,181 --> 01:11:12,583
I'm like, wait a minute.

858
01:11:12,623 --> 01:11:13,943
Yeah, I know.

859
01:11:13,963 --> 01:11:14,784
I'm done talking.

860
01:11:14,804 --> 01:11:16,385
December is the Zoom meeting.

861
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:17,045
Yes, I have that.

862
01:11:17,145 --> 01:11:18,646
And June would be the social.

863
01:11:31,026 --> 01:11:38,730
And I would assume the social would be in a different location, but we, when the time comes, we'll figure that out.

864
01:11:39,410 --> 01:11:45,953
It was suggested that there could be a recess in the summer, potentially August, no meeting.

865
01:11:46,553 --> 01:11:50,895
In light of our discussion about the future funding is a good part of the agenda item above.

866
01:11:51,315 --> 01:11:52,856
How does the schedule sound?

867
01:11:55,737 --> 01:11:57,078
Everybody good with the schedule?

868
01:11:58,178 --> 01:11:58,459
All right.

869
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:05,097
Would change, no, that doesn't matter because you don't have to worry about the funding cycle at all.

870
01:12:05,358 --> 01:12:13,121
So everybody is, I'm hearing we're all good with continuing the first Wednesday at six o'clock.

871
01:12:13,401 --> 01:12:16,463
I'm hearing a Zoom meeting, December is good.

872
01:12:16,643 --> 01:12:27,928
I'm also hearing a June 2026 social is good and a possible recess in August.

873
01:12:29,197 --> 01:12:29,897
Perfect, yeah.

874
01:12:30,778 --> 01:12:52,905
I would just caution that since we have a rolling application cycle, there is every possibility that our plans for next year are changed when something comes along that necessitates our attention.

875
01:12:54,346 --> 01:12:56,747
I appreciate that, thank you, but I also

876
01:13:01,522 --> 01:13:08,766
If there's no meeting scheduled, then the application would go to the next meeting of the next.

877
01:13:09,826 --> 01:13:15,229
All right.

878
01:13:16,249 --> 01:13:19,211
Hey, we are at the end.

879
01:13:19,991 --> 01:13:22,312
Do I have a motion to adjourn?

880
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,094
We both do it simultaneously.

881
01:13:26,154 --> 01:13:26,494
All right.

882
01:13:31,029 --> 01:13:32,010
All in favor of adjourn?

883
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:33,610
Aye.

884
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:34,211
Awesome.

885
01:13:34,471 --> 01:13:36,192
Thanks guys for a great meeting.

886
01:13:36,252 --> 01:13:36,732
Thank you.
