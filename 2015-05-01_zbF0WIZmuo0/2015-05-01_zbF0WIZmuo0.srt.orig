1
00:00:05,295 --> 00:00:06,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Isaac, what did you do in shop yesterday?

2
00:00:07,016 --> 00:00:08,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I had some light bulbs and some switches.

3
00:00:08,997 --> 00:00:09,697
[SPEAKER_03]: I was taking vitals.

4
00:00:09,757 --> 00:00:10,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

5
00:00:10,037 --> 00:00:10,718
[SPEAKER_01]: You were taking vitals?

6
00:00:10,818 --> 00:00:11,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

7
00:00:11,138 --> 00:00:11,938
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually pretty cool.

8
00:00:12,158 --> 00:00:14,279
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you go to school?

9
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,140
[SPEAKER_03]: We go up there.

10
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,241
[SPEAKER_01]: We go up there too!

11
00:00:18,422 --> 00:00:18,882
[SPEAKER_01]: That's weird.

12
00:00:18,902 --> 00:00:20,843
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like we go to the exact same school.

13
00:00:21,223 --> 00:00:23,084
[SPEAKER_01]: We do go to the same school!

14
00:00:29,308 --> 00:00:35,454
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, whatever button he presses on the keyboard sends a signal to a website.

15
00:00:35,694 --> 00:00:39,717
[SPEAKER_00]: And every half second, the robot checks that website for those numbers constantly.

16
00:00:40,318 --> 00:00:45,142
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once the website numbers get changed, then it sends it to the robot.

17
00:00:45,362 --> 00:00:49,446
[SPEAKER_00]: The robot notices that the numbers changed, and it does whatever key he is pressing.

18
00:00:49,546 --> 00:00:51,768
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can pan to the left and right.

19
00:00:52,108 --> 00:00:54,571
[SPEAKER_00]: It can move left, right, forward, backwards.

20
00:00:59,029 --> 00:01:03,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I have to measure how long it is, and I have to measure the height.

21
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,363
[SPEAKER_01]: have the tire run.

22
00:01:11,483 --> 00:01:14,066
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows how much it's off on each side.

23
00:01:14,686 --> 00:01:27,940
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mr. Brown and Lord have assisted in the renovation of this cafeteria by painting and installing the screen and they actually built these speakers from scratch.

24
00:01:28,732 --> 00:01:31,573
[SPEAKER_02]: the students in the Construction and Craft Laborers Program.

25
00:01:31,593 --> 00:01:45,060
[SPEAKER_02]: This is cosmetology, and it is a four-year vocational program, but students can earn their license as a cosmetologist with the State Board of Cosmetologists.

26
00:01:45,934 --> 00:01:47,655
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is our culinary arts program.

27
00:01:47,715 --> 00:01:54,618
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a four-year program, and this year we just started with the Post-Art Massachusetts Restaurant Association program.

28
00:01:55,238 --> 00:02:04,863
[SPEAKER_02]: So students that now enroll in this program get certification as a food service management program where they can get college credit.

29
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:13,569
[SPEAKER_02]: at Johnson and Wales University, the Culinary Institute of America, as well as any community college in the state of Massachusetts.

30
00:02:18,995 --> 00:02:23,856
[SPEAKER_02]: wired this smart TV so that people can watch TV while they're in here.

31
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:31,498
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is going to be our new hospitality program that will be combined with culinary arts.

32
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:37,699
[SPEAKER_02]: And our students in the construction and craft labors program are building out a mock hotel.

33
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,761
[SPEAKER_02]: So here will be the reception area where guests would actually check into a hotel room.

34
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,564
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a conference suite over here that will occur.

35
00:02:48,684 --> 00:02:51,307
[SPEAKER_02]: So the tables were donated, the chairs were donated.

36
00:02:51,327 --> 00:02:53,429
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to create a little conference room over here.

37
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:57,133
[SPEAKER_02]: In here, I'll take you into the master suite.

38
00:02:58,594 --> 00:03:05,961
[SPEAKER_02]: So there'll be a bed in here where they can learn housekeeping, obviously with the nightstand.

39
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,123
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have a mock.

40
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:16,666
[SPEAKER_02]: So this bathroom will not be running or operable, but they'll be able to kind of learn the housekeeping skills that they need.

41
00:03:16,726 --> 00:03:20,729
[SPEAKER_02]: So you print programs, business cards, and you design them.

42
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:39,884
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get a vacuum hose in there.
