00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:11,409
And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:14,792
Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,092 --> 00:00:17,834
And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:20,176
And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,457 --> 00:00:28,363
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:32,246
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,728
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:42,728 --> 00:00:45,070
All right, Shelley and I are here today.

10
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,011
Thanks for joining us and thank you for joining us.

11
00:00:47,652 --> 00:00:53,636
If you don't mind, just by starting out with introducing yourself, so saying your name, pronouns, and just a bit about who you are.

12
00:00:54,476 --> 00:00:56,357
Yeah, so my name is Jacqueline Torres-Roth.

13
00:00:56,477 --> 00:00:57,697
I use she, they pronouns.

14
00:00:58,217 --> 00:01:04,119
My wife and I live in Wellington, and I am part of a couple of different committees here in Medford.

15
00:01:04,139 --> 00:01:08,481
I'm part of the Solid Waste Task Force, the Medford Arts Council, the Medford Pride Planning Committee.

16
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,101
We have a bunch of cool stuff coming up.

17
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,582
And I am running for city council.

18
00:01:13,662 --> 00:01:14,242
Great, thank you.

19
00:01:14,262 --> 00:01:22,365
So before we get into talking about the local politics angle, if you could just tell us your favorite place to eat in Medford and what you like to eat there.

20
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:24,056
Yeah, so I have two favorites.

21
00:01:24,457 --> 00:01:28,958
My favorite that's very close to me is called Annie's Pizzeria on Middlesex Ave.

22
00:01:29,318 --> 00:01:32,280
They make a delicious buffalo chicken mess pizza.

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,182
I love to have friends over for a board game night and order a couple pizzas and they go so fast.

24
00:01:38,562 --> 00:01:42,944
And then the other one is Najia in Medford Square, which I know is a popular one.

25
00:01:42,964 --> 00:01:48,966
I love their all-you-can-eat sushi and friends and I always go there to celebrate birthdays or really any special occasion.

26
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,687
So I love to frequent both of those.

27
00:01:51,606 --> 00:01:51,826
Nice.

28
00:01:52,087 --> 00:01:52,327
Love it.

29
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:53,047
Thank you.

30
00:01:53,107 --> 00:01:53,308
Yeah.

31
00:01:53,348 --> 00:01:58,532
So we had you on today to talk a little bit about your run for city council.

32
00:01:58,592 --> 00:02:04,677
So if you don't mind sharing kind of what was like, what led you to run for city council, if you could share kind of like your path to local politics.

33
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:05,898
Yeah, absolutely.

34
00:02:05,978 --> 00:02:09,341
So my path to local politics started at a young age.

35
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:12,984
I remember my parents would take me to the polls for every election.

36
00:02:13,064 --> 00:02:17,668
And we would either go early in the morning before school or after school, they would pick me up.

37
00:02:17,748 --> 00:02:19,129
And I just really loved

38
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,954
The whole process, checking in, getting your ballot, filling in the selections.

39
00:02:23,994 --> 00:02:26,856
And I remember thinking, I can't wait until I can vote.

40
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:30,239
And I turn 18 and can go through this whole process.

41
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:35,864
And we always had discussions around the dinner table, talking about politics, talking about current events.

42
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:38,807
So I got to thinking about these things at a young age.

43
00:02:38,847 --> 00:02:42,871
And then once I could vote, that's when I really got invested in my community.

44
00:02:42,951 --> 00:02:46,455
So when I went to Brown, I was on the newspaper.

45
00:02:46,475 --> 00:02:51,020
I was constantly talking about current events with my fellow staff members.

46
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:56,046
And I had an internship in Senator Markey's office my sophomore year of college.

47
00:02:56,086 --> 00:02:58,008
And that was a great opportunity to

48
00:02:58,448 --> 00:03:07,637
Talking to constituents, I got a lot of calls in and understood, you know, what were the big things that they were focused on and how could I help them and bring that to Senator Markey's attention.

49
00:03:07,697 --> 00:03:12,562
So that really spurred my interest in really getting involved in the community.

50
00:03:12,582 --> 00:03:15,145
And then once my wife and I moved to Medford, I really

51
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:22,928
wanted to be a part of the community, meet a lot of different types of people, and environment and sustainability is a huge piece of that.

52
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:32,753
So I joined the Solid Waste Task Force, had an amazing experience and a really interesting experience learning a lot about trash and recycling in Medford and just the importance of composting.

53
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,754
And I also am part of the Arts Council and the Pride Planning Committee.

54
00:03:36,774 --> 00:03:42,177
So I've got to meet a wide section of people, hear a lot about the issues.

55
00:03:42,937 --> 00:03:45,980
enjoy watching the City Council meetings and keeping up to date on that.

56
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,864
And I am part of our Revolution Medford as well and talk to people there.

57
00:03:49,944 --> 00:04:02,235
So I've become quite invested in the community and just love the different pieces that go into it and meeting people and through those conversations and relationships decided to run for office.

58
00:04:03,617 --> 00:04:03,897
Thank you.

59
00:04:06,387 --> 00:04:07,989
I love that.

60
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:16,779
When you sort of envision the work, what might you say are your change priorities from your current perspective?

61
00:04:17,502 --> 00:04:22,023
Yeah, so the big focus in my campaign is a thriving environment for all.

62
00:04:22,183 --> 00:04:24,064
And so that's a lot of different pieces.

63
00:04:24,104 --> 00:04:28,725
That's City Hall, that's the environment, that's public transportation, that's affordable housing.

64
00:04:28,805 --> 00:04:43,128
So when you look at City Hall, I think looking at our charter reform, looking at the governance that we have, making sure that it is equitable between the mayor and city council, and also making sure that we have representation from all facets of our community.

65
00:04:43,488 --> 00:04:47,109
I think having those diverse voices and having more of those

66
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:50,971
populations that aren't necessarily as represented.

67
00:04:51,271 --> 00:04:54,032
We have a majority white population, about 71%.

68
00:04:54,553 --> 00:04:58,515
We don't have as much of, you know, more black and brown voices.

69
00:04:58,595 --> 00:05:07,019
So I think having more people in leadership on committees and commissions that can bring their voices to the table to have these conversations and really make change.

70
00:05:07,499 --> 00:05:10,381
So I think having that in City Hall is first and foremost.

71
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:12,902
I think environment and sustainability

72
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:15,416
We have so much green space.

73
00:05:15,456 --> 00:05:17,759
The Middlesex Fells Reservation is a huge part of it.

74
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:18,800
We have a ton of parks.

75
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:25,109
I think having more tree canopy, that helps with cleaner air and that also helps with the heat.

76
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:29,254
It helps with cooler temperatures in the summer and having cooling stations around Medford is a huge

77
00:05:30,035 --> 00:05:35,420
thing that we need, especially in those hotter months, that having that tree canopy is super important.

78
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,761
And composting as well.

79
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:45,648
On the Solid Waste Task Force, I learned a lot about how composting, just at a minimum, reduces the amount of waste that you're putting in your trash bin.

80
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:52,294
And you can really eliminate and reduce your footprint just by something small like that.

81
00:05:52,314 --> 00:05:58,099
And I know it's more of an education and awareness piece, but that's something that I think can really make a huge difference.

82
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:01,861
And then when it comes to public transportation, I am a commuter.

83
00:06:01,901 --> 00:06:05,184
I take the Orange Line many days a week into the office.

84
00:06:05,744 --> 00:06:13,470
And so I was someone who was impacted by the slower rails, by the issues with the maintenance and repair.

85
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:20,134
So I think making sure that we invest in our Orange Line, in our commuter rail, and having more access across the city.

86
00:06:20,215 --> 00:06:22,356
We have the commuter rail in West Medford.

87
00:06:22,396 --> 00:06:24,678
We have the Orange Line in Wellington.

88
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:31,439
It's really hard if you're somewhere in the middle to access that transportation and to have more bus access as well.

89
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:32,860
We have infrequent routes.

90
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:39,201
It's really hard for people who need accessibility to be able to navigate the bus system.

91
00:06:39,281 --> 00:06:46,483
So expanding that and making it easier and more accessible for people to get around the city is really important.

92
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:51,418
And for the affordable housing piece, you know, we, it's a big focus.

93
00:06:51,438 --> 00:06:58,200
I think there's a lot of different areas within Medford that we can focus on affordable housing, like in Medford Square and Haines Square.

94
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:07,523
And I think having mixed use development is super important, but this starts with zoning reform and making sure that our zoning is equitable.

95
00:07:07,863 --> 00:07:19,848
For all populations, and it's not just to prioritize those white residents, but really everyone has an equal opportunity and an equitable chance to get housing.

96
00:07:20,568 --> 00:07:25,910
And I think we have about 7.2% of affordable housing in Medford.

97
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,851
The Massachusetts municipal requirement is 10%.

98
00:07:28,971 --> 00:07:35,500
Making sure that we get there and are on par with what the state is advocating for is really important.

99
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,503
And then the last piece is just that piece of belonging.

100
00:07:38,563 --> 00:07:43,450
I think, you know, my wife and I are really grateful to live in Medford and we were welcomed into the community.

101
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:50,053
really haven't had any issues with the fact that we are out in a queer couple, but that's not always the case for everyone.

102
00:07:50,073 --> 00:08:00,058
So making sure that everyone, no matter how they identify, feels like they are a part of the community, feels welcomed, and feels like this is a place where they can really thrive and build that community with others.

103
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:10,472
Yeah, I love, I adore how you're discussing the way that intersectionality touches on so many of these important pieces, be it housing, education, climate stuff.

104
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:25,181
Do you have thoughts or strategies around what building opportunities for equity would look like, raising the voices of, like you said, black and brown people, youth, sort of queer agendas?

105
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:28,243
Any thoughts on any of those pieces?

106
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:45,418
Yeah, I think having a office of housing development is a big priority and having a cross-section of people who make up Medford, having those youth voices, having those queer voices, having those black and brown voices, truly make up what's important to them and what's going on there.

107
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,279
And I think having that

108
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:58,125
Mixed use development is a great way to get even some, you know, minority owned businesses more into our city because, you know, we have some but I don't think we have nearly enough and I'd like to see more of that.

109
00:08:58,145 --> 00:09:07,391
So I think bringing all these people into the conversation and bringing these voices into our zoning reform as well, having them, you know,

110
00:09:08,231 --> 00:09:12,716
give their perspective and share a little bit about what their experience is like.

111
00:09:12,736 --> 00:09:21,267
I think having those conversations and engaging in that healthy debate and conversation and different viewpoints is really what's going to move the needle forward with these policies.

112
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:23,799
Yeah.

113
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:26,060
You talked about a couple of like boards, commissions that you're on.

114
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:38,122
And, um, and I just kind of wonder, like, so having gone through the process of being assigned or elected to those boards, um, could you say anything about your experience?

115
00:09:38,142 --> 00:09:53,466
Like how that, cause I think you named like being able to make those boards and commissions more diverse and are more inclusive and represent more representative of our community, um, from your experience, could you say how maybe that could, that process could look differently to, to do that?

116
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:54,186
Yeah.

117
00:09:54,787 --> 00:10:00,089
So I think one of the biggest things is the time commitment and the accessibility in finding these.

118
00:10:00,109 --> 00:10:06,493
I wanted to be on a board and commission, so spent a lot of time, talked to a lot of people trying to figure out where do I apply?

119
00:10:06,593 --> 00:10:07,313
How do I apply?

120
00:10:07,393 --> 00:10:08,574
What's the timeline look like?

121
00:10:08,894 --> 00:10:12,836
And I don't think that is super easy for some Medford residents.

122
00:10:12,856 --> 00:10:20,280
I think it's really difficult if you don't necessarily have access to the internet, if you don't have a laptop at home, if you're not

123
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:40,517
Part of these certain groups and on these social media channels that you're able to see this I think it's really hard to get to so I think if we have more opportunities to share this at City Hall in meetings and really across town so that we can get different people who can share their voices because I think that the biggest barrier is just is

124
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:43,880
seeing it and being able to know the process.

125
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:57,873
So I think being transparent about we're looking for people, we want different voices is really impactful and we can get more people and kind of lessen the barriers to entry there in terms of getting them on boards and commissions.

126
00:10:58,768 --> 00:11:13,964
My understanding is like right now, boards and commissions, the assignments for those are basically made by the mayor, and that it sounds like maybe you're suggesting that some of that power be sort of shifted to other bodies in the city so that it's not all just a decision in the hands of the mayor.

127
00:11:14,635 --> 00:11:15,937
Yeah, I think that's really important.

128
00:11:15,977 --> 00:11:29,156
I think having more voices and kind of getting more opportunities for more diverse populations to speak and, you know, having city council share these boards and commissions.

129
00:11:29,937 --> 00:11:40,766
Because these do make an impact, they have a lot of say, especially the Solid Waste Task Force and making sure that we have the right trash and recycling in our city.

130
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:55,979
And I think, you know, emphasizing the importance of stepping into these roles and being able to have a lot of leadership sharing these ideas and talking about the value would really get more people engaged and excited about joining the work.

131
00:11:57,576 --> 00:12:00,357
You just wrapped up working on the, remind me what it was called.

132
00:12:01,118 --> 00:12:05,120
Yeah, so I have two entire HRC meetings left.

133
00:12:05,521 --> 00:12:08,383
Oh yeah, and then there's the sex ed curriculum.

134
00:12:08,423 --> 00:12:09,623
That's right.

135
00:12:09,783 --> 00:12:10,724
You forgot already, yeah.

136
00:12:10,744 --> 00:12:12,825
Sorry, I forgot already.

137
00:12:12,985 --> 00:12:15,587
And I'm on the charter review commission.

138
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:20,230
I think you make some great points about just even those meetings being accessible, right?

139
00:12:21,171 --> 00:12:25,053
My observation is most of the people in that meeting maybe don't have

140
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:31,297
young kids, or they have a more flexible schedule, so they can do meetings at lots of different times.

141
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:43,004
I mean, I think it eliminates a lot of people that maybe have a work schedule that they can't work around, or can't maybe commit to an extended time of working on one of these commissions, but their perspectives are valuable, right?

142
00:12:43,184 --> 00:12:43,804
Yeah, absolutely.

143
00:12:43,924 --> 00:12:51,110
I think you also nailed it when you said belonging and folks want to know that what they're saying means something.

144
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:58,517
I get the impression a lot of times that folks are like, yeah, sure, I can show up and I can share what I'm thinking, but does it have any weight?

145
00:12:58,597 --> 00:13:01,019
Will my energy and effort be worth it?

146
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:02,720
you know, six months down the road.

147
00:13:03,561 --> 00:13:08,727
And then, of course, a lot of these positions are unpaid, if not most of them or all of them are unpaid.

148
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:16,775
And so to give this, to feel like you're giving and giving and giving, combined with a potential lack of weight or belonging.

149
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:20,318
And I can imagine when people are like, I'm not sure why this makes sense for me.

150
00:13:20,618 --> 00:13:21,339
Yeah, absolutely.

151
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:24,803
And even like watching city council meetings, anyone who goes up there and speaks,

152
00:13:25,203 --> 00:13:25,943
It's intimidating.

153
00:13:26,023 --> 00:13:26,604
It's a lot.

154
00:13:26,644 --> 00:13:43,990
You're in front of a huge crowd, and I think eliminating that barrier that your voice does matter, even if it's just to agree or disagree with something, but just saying something is really huge and just making sure that, you know, in those meetings, people feel comfortable and know that they are valued and supported and what they believe in.

155
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:46,131
Thank you.

156
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:47,712
Yeah, I think, and in that sort of

157
00:13:49,558 --> 00:13:53,623
I wonder if you could share kind of something that you like most appreciate about this community in Medford.

158
00:13:55,225 --> 00:13:57,628
So many things.

159
00:13:58,108 --> 00:14:04,616
I think being part of the Arts Council has been a really cool opportunity to try a lot of different things.

160
00:14:04,917 --> 00:14:07,140
I'm someone who loves to go outside my comfort zone and be

161
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:16,448
Really bad at something just for the sake of having a story and getting a little bit better So I have brought my wife along to a bunch of different things in the city.

162
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:29,160
There is dance classes actually here at the library We learned the tango the rumba the salsa and we were terrible, but it was so much fun We got to meet people in the community so I think having those opportunities where you can go outside your comfort zone and

163
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,964
Again, it is an accessibility thing where you have to know where to look and, you know, you have to have the time as well.

164
00:14:36,024 --> 00:14:41,868
But having those events, we have PorchFest coming up, our first PorchFest in June, so that's going to be huge.

165
00:14:41,888 --> 00:14:53,736
There's a lot of cool opportunities to connect with people either outside or just kind of detached from a screen, which I think is super important now more than ever to be able to have those face-to-face interactions.

166
00:14:53,796 --> 00:14:59,020
So I've really enjoyed being able to try new things and just meet different people with different interests.

167
00:14:59,725 --> 00:15:00,065
Thank you.

168
00:15:02,087 --> 00:15:09,472
So to kind of add a little bit more of a personal element, so we're wondering if you could share something about you that might surprise us to learn.

169
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,540
So I guess two things.

170
00:15:11,981 --> 00:15:15,702
One is I have a tabby cat named Pekin, who is amazing.

171
00:15:15,722 --> 00:15:19,904
I wasn't originally a cat person, but my wife convinced me.

172
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:21,265
And she's just so much fun.

173
00:15:21,465 --> 00:15:23,786
She loves to sunbathe in her tower.

174
00:15:24,126 --> 00:15:25,187
She's obsessed with breakfast.

175
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:28,488
She gets me up at the crack of dawn every day to feed her.

176
00:15:29,148 --> 00:15:31,169
And she's just very playful and snuggly.

177
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:34,131
So that's been amazing to have her join our family.

178
00:15:34,431 --> 00:15:36,572
And the other piece is just a fun one.

179
00:15:36,632 --> 00:15:38,593
I ripstick, which is kind of like a skateboard.

180
00:15:39,193 --> 00:15:56,483
but you and you kind of like do the same motion of like a surfboard so you just go on the street and I used to do it growing up in elementary school and I recently got back into it and it's really fun to just rip stick out there see the kids on their bikes and just have fun and be a kid again.

181
00:15:56,503 --> 00:15:57,503
That's great.

182
00:15:58,664 --> 00:16:03,587
Alright so our final question is just to sort of share any advice that you've received that you'd want to pass on.

183
00:16:04,787 --> 00:16:12,291
Yeah, so I think as a big sports background, a lot of the advice I've received has kind of related to sports, but related to a lot of different things.

184
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:15,793
So one phrase that I always keep with me is just the phrase, next one.

185
00:16:16,353 --> 00:16:24,958
And that's sort of helpful, whether you're thinking about sports, whether you're thinking about work, friendships, it's really just keep trying, keep going, things happen, things come up.

186
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:38,670
It might not be the best interaction you had, it might not be the best phone call, or just the best experience, but just take it, run with it, learn something from it, and take that into the next opportunity you have to be better and keep growing.

187
00:16:39,671 --> 00:16:40,172
Check us out.

188
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,734
Ending on a note of resilience, I love that.

189
00:16:43,134 --> 00:16:45,617
Is there anything else that you want to share before we wrap up for today?

190
00:16:46,077 --> 00:16:53,521
Yeah, I think the last thing I just want to share is as a city counselor and just as a person what I'm really focused on is I'm, I'm a learner.

191
00:16:53,902 --> 00:17:02,387
I'm a connector and I'm a competitor and what I mean by that is I'm endlessly curious, I love to learn things I get really invested in the things I'm passionate about and.

192
00:17:03,287 --> 00:17:04,688
Making a change in our community.

193
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:17,639
I'm invested in our community I spend a lot of time learning as much as I can and I will do that in the role of City Councilor and as a connector I love meeting people building relationships and building relationships with people with diverse perspectives.

194
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:25,766
I don't shy away from healthy debate I think having those hard conversations is where we're able to move forward and create policies that

195
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:30,413
make the most sense for the community and are the most inclusive and accessible.

196
00:17:30,873 --> 00:17:35,616
And in terms of the competitor piece, I want Medford to be the best city possible.

197
00:17:35,716 --> 00:17:38,058
I want us to compete with neighboring cities.

198
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:46,984
One of the things I see is we have a walkability score of about 68 and Somerville is at 89 and I believe Cambridge is at 90.

199
00:17:47,485 --> 00:17:48,605
So I want to beat them.

200
00:17:48,706 --> 00:17:49,366
I want to be better.

201
00:17:49,386 --> 00:17:55,030
I want our city to be the best city in our area and I will fight hard for that.

202
00:17:56,311 --> 00:17:56,771
I like that.

203
00:17:57,332 --> 00:17:59,313
I also want Medford to be better than this.

204
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,475
Awesome.

205
00:18:02,736 --> 00:18:03,696
And the work begins.

206
00:18:04,197 --> 00:18:05,678
Are there any like events that you want to share?

207
00:18:05,758 --> 00:18:08,980
Anything that you want to kind of, any?

208
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,060
Yes.

209
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,502
So June 1st is the flag raising ceremony.

210
00:18:11,622 --> 00:18:14,884
I'm going to be emceeing and giving some welcoming remarks.

211
00:18:14,944 --> 00:18:17,306
So if you want to see me there, I will be there.

212
00:18:17,466 --> 00:18:20,088
Also June 25th is our community day.

213
00:18:20,608 --> 00:18:22,510
We have a lot of cool stuff in store.

214
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,812
We're going to have some drag performers, which will be a great experience to

215
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:33,135
get people out and about, get people educated, aware of how amazing these drag queens are and drag kings.

216
00:18:33,475 --> 00:18:36,077
And also PorchFest on June 3rd.

217
00:18:36,097 --> 00:18:37,098
It's our first PorchFest.

218
00:18:37,138 --> 00:18:38,038
It's going to be awesome.

219
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,439
And I'm really excited to bring it to Medford.

220
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:40,720
Great.

221
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:41,501
Awesome.

222
00:18:41,941 --> 00:18:42,662
Well, thank you so much.

223
00:18:42,682 --> 00:18:43,162
Thank you.

224
00:18:43,202 --> 00:18:44,123
Good luck November.

225
