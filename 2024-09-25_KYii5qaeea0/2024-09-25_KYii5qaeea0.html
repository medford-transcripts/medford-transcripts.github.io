    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=71.334s">the</a>  Medford Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=76.656s">We</a>  have two items on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=80.357s">One</a>  is the resolution to publish a City Council newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=83.279s">The</a>  other is a resolution to create a residence guide to City Council procedures and processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=91.662s">So</a>  I am just going to go ahead and <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=96.613s">share</a>  my screen as to the draft that we came up with. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=101.875s">First,</a>  I apologize, I wasn't able to get this particular draft out during, wasn't able to get this particular draft out to folks before yesterday, but <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=120.458s">We</a>  do have a version here now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=122.721s">This</a>  was drafted by Anna and I also did some edits. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=128.447s">This</a>  version of the newsletter is essentially meant to, I'm just gonna see if there's a cleaner way to sort of zoom in on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=138.387s">Okay,</a>  so this version of the newsletter covers the July to September 2024 period because we essentially skipped this over the summer because we only had two regular meetings during that month. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=151.193s">And</a>  otherwise, this just sort of, this just covers the different pieces of committee work that were done. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=157.876s">Throws</a>  in the commemorations as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=161.618s">So</a>  if, <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=166.212s">So</a>  essentially, just going over very briefly, July 23rd, the condolences to the family of MPS teacher Robin Irving, September 10th, to family of Frank Zizzo, September 10th, recognized September's National Recovery Month, and then celebrate the importance of the Chevalier Theatre and Gene Mack Gym on the 17th. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=191.538s">The</a>  general business goes over <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=195.455s">The</a>  newly created stabilization fund September 10th covers the whole petition to the. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=201.579s">state</a>  house, as well as the approval of the wildlife feeding ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=206.943s">A</a>  couple of other financial things that were also done on September 10th, the electrical vehicle charging revolving fund and the refunding loan order, essentially to get better rates on some city bonds. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=225.157s">September</a>  17th also, <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=229.666s">approved</a>  late night hours for Panda Express. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=232.807s">And</a>  on July 23rd, this details how we chose to not move forward with a second independent audit of the city, since we already had an independent audit every year, as noted during the meeting in July. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=247.911s">And</a>  just some of the individual committees are only just starting to meet again. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=255.333s">So</a>  the governance committee, I noted here how <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=258.979s">It</a>  hasn't met, but it did receive a referral from a regular meeting to start considering charter reforms. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=275.25s">The</a>  Charter Study Committee wraps up its work. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=278.352s">So</a>  that's just a mechanism, essentially, to start discussing that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=284.875s">Planning</a>  and permitting committee did meet over the summer and this just goes over some of the activity that we've been doing for INS Associates and the planning department and the public health and community safety committee worked on the wildlife feeding ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=306.687s">Noticing</a>  a typo here just now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=313.044s">I</a>  do think, uh, Emily, uh, Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=318.229s">I</a>  know we're casual in the committee meetings, but, um, the, uh, one comment about the public health and community safety committee, um, the, I appreciate the ordinance will allow the city to step in if and only if there's a problem that neighbors are complaining about, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=338.308s">For</a>  example, it specifically allows people to have bird feeders. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=341.751s">I'm</a>  not sure, so, and maybe I'm too close to this discussion since I was leading all of the meetings and I feel like the wildlife feeding ordinance is something that, because I discussed it at great length, I feel like I would want to say more than this, but I don't want the newsletter to be overrun with <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=366.104s">our</a>  back and forth discussions of the Wildlife Feeding Ordinance, but I think I would wanna say the purpose of the ordinance is to avoid, I think we can be more direct about what it was about, which was that it was like, in that committee, we drafted and thoroughly discussed the Wildlife Feeding Ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=395.916s">Um,</a>  which, you know, can you just tell me verbatim what, uh, yeah, I think I'm just thinking about like what, what it should say, and I'm not ready for it to be verbatim just yet, but I'd like to hear sort of your thoughts as I say them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=408.406s">Um,</a>  I think I would just want to say that the point of it was to, um, make sure that folks are not feeding wild animals intentionally aside from birds using bird feeders. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=422.898s">And</a>  I think you can say that in one sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=428.223s">And</a>  it would be something that you could, what's the word I'm looking for? <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=437.827s">Something</a>  that you could enforce, that's the word. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=441.629s">This</a>  ordinance would be something that you could enforce only if there are complaints about a nuisance. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=449.393s">Something</a>  that would be enforced only if there were complaints about a nuisance. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=455.543s">I</a>  guess I'm just I'm trying to simplify and be like a little bit more specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=474.688s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=478.589s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=480.569s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=480.869s">And</a>  then I think we can cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=482.91s">And</a>  then I think you can cut from <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=488.77s">And</a>  then I think you can say it allows people to have bird feeders.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=495.274s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=498.355s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=499.396s">It</a>  might be nice to say something like the city council is taking the issue of rodents in our city seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=507.24s">Like</a>  start off with sort of the purpose of the wildlife feeding ordinance.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=516.974s">Are</a>  you recommending to start off this whole paragraph by saying the city is working very hard to address the rodent problem?</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=527.26s">Yes,</a>  exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=528.601s">And</a>  the Wildlife Feeding Ordinance is one of our tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=532.744s">I</a>  think that just helps people to kind of understand, like, if I just see the Wildlife Feeding Ordinance, I don't really know what that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=540.628s">But</a>  like, if it's like, we're taking rodents seriously, and this is one of our tools for doing it.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=546.4s">I</a>  would fully concur with that.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=550.805s">What</a>  about overgrowth ordinance?</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=564.861s">The</a>  overgrowth ordinance, we just are beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=567.823s">Well,</a>  we did begin discussing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=569.965s">Actually,</a>  and that was this month. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=571.506s">Wait,</a>  did we begin discussing that? <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=573.947s">We</a>  talked about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=575.248s">Did</a>  we refer it to committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=576.569s">I'm</a>  all turned around now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=579.011s">Yes,</a>  we did discuss that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=582.333s">We</a>  did discuss that this month. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=584.735s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=585.115s">Overgrowth,</a>  and that's also rodent related.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=586.996s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=589.258s">I</a>  mean, they were sort of mixed into that one committee meeting, but I don't know.</p>

    <p>[6XRDVyVUfUQ_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=592.881s">Oh,</a>  you're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=594.215s">Oh,</a>  were you saying that outside?</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=601.156s">There's</a>  a lot of traffic today.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=603.737s">Yeah,</a>  so on that note, yeah, we can add in the overgrowth in that case because we did just talk about that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=613.099s">And</a>  that really encompasses how much intentionality there is in that committee and in the council overall in the partnership with the Board of Health.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=623.268s">Can</a>  you look up the, wait, what was the date of this committee meeting again? <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=625.871s">That's</a>  Tuesday, September 17th. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=668.042s">I</a>  mean, I think we did work on both of that committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=682.645s">I</a>  believe if my memory serves right, so I could just say that.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=692.566s">And</a>  then begin the discussion of overgrowth. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=695.747s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=698.583s">The</a>  agenda's there, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=700.544s">Make</a>  doubly sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=704.245s">It</a>  does begin to blend together sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=711.046s">But</a>  I think in that meeting we had two items. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=722.489s">Oh,</a>  it was an update to the rodent control. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=725.836s">So</a>  we had, right, because the wildlife feeding had already been approved and it was in first reading at the regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=734.478s">So</a>  this was two additional ordinances that we were addressing to further hone the rodent control measures in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=743.621s">So</a>  maybe we have two bullet points under public health and community safety and they're all rodent related.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=748.002s">Yeah,</a>  my memory is like... <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=788.425s">Okay,</a>  what was the, I'm just gonna go to another tab here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=814.432s">And</a>  I was 17. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=817.521s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=823.104s">And</a>  then we have the one in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=826.946s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=827.186s">That</a>  was, that was the August 13th. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=830.107s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=858.513s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=863.717s">So</a>  I just want to update that next sentence a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=866.159s">The</a>  purpose of this ordinance is to ensure that residents do not intentionally feed wildlife. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=870.922s">I</a>  don't think that's quite right. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=871.963s">I</a>  think it's more like do not feed unwanted wildlife. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=879.408s">I</a>  mean, it's really the purpose is to make sure that, you know, people aren't accidentally providing food for pests. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=887.967s">But</a>  I don't know exactly how to phrase that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=892.449s">I</a>  mean, I don't think anybody's intentionally feeding rodents, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=900.092s">That's</a>  not a thing.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=902.172s">It's</a>  more like... And we don't have to spend forever on this, but... Maybe we can take that whole thing out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=914.837s">Maybe</a>  we don't need an intentionality. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=917.093s">Yeah,</a>  we did, we put the purpose at the top, so we can, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=921.157s">Yeah,</a>  I think that's enough.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=926.882s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=927.503s">Oh,</a>  I just wanted to note, I had a comment after we finished talking about rodents.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=935.351s">Sorry,</a>  can you speak up?</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=937.853s">I</a>  just wanted to note that I have a comment after we talked about rodents.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=954.795s">My</a>  brain's blinking a little bit here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=956.557s">What</a>  is a good way to summarize all the discussions on the overgrowth and rodent control ordinances? <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=963.222s">Those</a>  are, to be honest, those are kind of like mixing together at this point for me, between the wildlife feeding and the overgrowth and rodent control. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=994.624s">I</a>  mean, the crossed out stuff isn't going to be... <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1020.407s">This</a>  actually... This will ensure that residents don't feed on wildlife and only allow the city to step in if there is news. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1036.676s">In</a>  a sense, it will help us reduce our issues with rats and other unwanted animals. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1045.261s">Additionally,</a>  I'm just going to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1061.115s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1064.577s">And</a>  then again, I'm going, once I actually format this, I'm just going to blow it up with links to the actual drafts of the ordinances themselves, which is half the purpose of this thing to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1078.287s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1079.528s">It's</a>  a bit of a bit of a long paragraph, but it basically summarizes that the public health and community safety committee is trying to work on the rodent issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1093.297s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1094.718s">Justin,</a>  how close are you to City Hall?</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1098.961s">Very</a>  close. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1100.622s">But</a>  I did have one note about the charter review part. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1105.665s">I</a>  just wanted to just simplify the language a little bit and explain what it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1111.589s">So</a>  I would say instead of just charter reform, I would probably say work on reviewing the city charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1125.299s">And</a>  then we could have one sentence explaining what the city charter is. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1130.382s">I</a>  mean, the way I think about it and the way that the law professors teach it is like it's a mini constitution for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1142.307s">I</a>  don't know if there's a better way to put it.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1145.268s">Trying</a>  to think of, I could just say mini constitution, but this is analogous to a constitution.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1155.211s">Analogous</a>  might be too much of a word, or too big of a word, too complex.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1163.195s">Anna</a>  might have an idea.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1189.744s">I'm</a>  currently outside the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1191.626s">I'll</a>  be up in one minute.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1234.648s">City</a>  Charters, the Charters. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1245.81s">I</a>  should say finalizes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1251.952s">City</a>  Charters, the Governor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1253.432s">All</a>  right, Councilor Tseng has just entered the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1278.855s">Alright,</a>  I like things in lists of three but I'm having trouble thinking of something besides this as an example of what the charter covers. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1298.27s">Cool.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1318.49s">see</a>  that law school has been treating you well okay this should definitely go before because</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1362.183s">and</a>  begins its work, to begin its work by reviewing the city charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1370.367s">Something</a>  about, I wanted to put in something about just like the, we're just gonna start by looking at the timeline and like big picture approaches to the city charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1386.614s">What?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1389.534s">Just</a>  to reassure some members of the Charter Study Committee that we value their input as well, and that we're going to wait for their final product, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1410.572s">To</a>  the members of the committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1416.553s">I</a>  mean, I mean, it could be extraneous.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1418.655s">Yeah,</a>  that this is, I mean, it was, I think, I think this is work on the charter is probably going to be covered pretty extensively in future newsletters. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1427.861s">And</a>  this is really meant, I mean, really all that happened is that's fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1431.784s">Now</a>  we <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1432.85s">there</a>  was a resolution that was referred directly to committee.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1436.233s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1437.113s">Then,</a>  you know, I, I did see a member of the charter study committee on zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1441.377s">So</a>  I hope that she helps relay the message that we're not trying to step on anyone's toes here and that we're trying to, um, well, this can be open to public comment as well.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1449.623s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1469.931s">It's</a>  just that there is going to be inherently some overlap in terms of like, because we'll, I don't know who's on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1476.134s">It</a>  sounds like it'll overcomplicate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1482.677s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1494.426s">to</a>  do this work, rather than, you know, if anybody, like, because this is for people who really don't know much about government, but it works just to help people understand things. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1506.13s">And</a>  if they see that there's a charter structure that is not out there, that maybe you just rubber stamp with them, or that's their job, you know, but to make it clear that, like, the next <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1522.33s">So</a>  I think that that's clear in the words begin its work. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1526.091s">I</a>  think I, let's just not overcomplicate it then. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1530.892s">Let's</a>  just keep it as is.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1533.753s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1534.753s">I</a>  was thinking maybe finalize this recommendations or finalize its drafts.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1540.435s">I</a>  think that's good. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1548.517s">Nope.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1554.295s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1554.855s">Um,</a>  clarify Councilor, is Councilor Scarpelli here? <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1559.698s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1572.625s">Um,</a>  I'm going to go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1576.327s">And,</a>  um, is there any other parts of the newsletter that folks would like to comment on? <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1583.915s">I</a>  think that we need to go over. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1586.296s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1595.379s">In</a>  that case, is there any public, is there any public participation in this matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1601.021s">There's</a>  nobody currently in the chamber, but there are some folks on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1605.542s">So</a>  if you'd like to offer input onto this current draft of the <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1613.433s">under</a>  this current draft of the newsletter, feel free. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1615.495s">In</a>  that case, do we have a motion on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1623.802s">Motion</a>  approves it for publication. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1626.344s">I</a>  have a motion to approve for publication by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1630.827s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1633.73s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1640.08s">I</a>  did see iPhone on Zoom, but I'm not seeing it anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1644.903s">So</a>  I don't think Councilor Scarpelli is on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1649.106s">So</a>  we can just do a voice vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1652.728s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1653.428s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1654.489s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1655.83s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1659.792s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1660.873s">We'll</a>  get this formatted and hold on. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1668.137s">did</a>  have a note from Zoom reminding members to turn their mics on when they talk just so that it can be, just so that everybody can hear them that's listening in and for the recording. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1683.307s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1685.588s">Now,</a>  <a href="../resolutions/24-370.pdf"><font color="green">24-370</font></a> offered by Councilor Tseng, a resolution to create a residence guide to City Council's procedures and processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1695.731s">So</a>  I have the draft that Councilor Tseng shared. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1702.036s">And</a>  again, apologies that this is not, this was not in the initial agenda, but folks put in some work over the weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1717.568s">And</a>  if that is, all right, seems to be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1722.452s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>
