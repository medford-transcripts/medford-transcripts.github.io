1
00:01:11,334 --> 00:01:15,035
[SPEAKER_05]: the Medford Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.

2
00:01:16,656 --> 00:01:19,717
[SPEAKER_05]: We have two items on the agenda.

3
00:01:20,357 --> 00:01:23,199
[SPEAKER_05]: One is the resolution to publish a City Council newsletter.

4
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:30,861
[SPEAKER_05]: The other is a resolution to create a residence guide to City Council procedures and processes.

5
00:01:31,662 --> 00:01:33,943
[SPEAKER_05]: So I am just going to go ahead and

6
00:01:36,613 --> 00:01:41,575
[SPEAKER_05]: share my screen as to the draft that we came up with.

7
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:57,222
[SPEAKER_05]: First, I apologize, I wasn't able to get this particular draft out during, wasn't able to get this particular draft out to folks before yesterday, but

8
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,260
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a version here now.

9
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:08,006
[SPEAKER_05]: This was drafted by Anna and I also did some edits.

10
00:02:08,447 --> 00:02:16,336
[SPEAKER_05]: This version of the newsletter is essentially meant to, I'm just gonna see if there's a cleaner way to sort of zoom in on this.

11
00:02:18,387 --> 00:02:30,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so this version of the newsletter covers the July to September 2024 period because we essentially skipped this over the summer because we only had two regular meetings during that month.

12
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:37,856
[SPEAKER_05]: And otherwise, this just sort of, this just covers the different pieces of committee work that were done.

13
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:41,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Throws in the commemorations as well.

14
00:02:41,618 --> 00:02:42,799
[SPEAKER_05]: So if,

15
00:02:46,212 --> 00:03:09,818
[SPEAKER_05]: So essentially, just going over very briefly, July 23rd, the condolences to the family of MPS teacher Robin Irving, September 10th, to family of Frank Zizzo, September 10th, recognized September's National Recovery Month, and then celebrate the importance of the Chevalier Theatre and Gene Mack Gym on the 17th.

16
00:03:11,538 --> 00:03:14,319
[SPEAKER_05]: The general business goes over

17
00:03:15,455 --> 00:03:20,623
[SPEAKER_05]: The newly created stabilization fund September 10th covers the whole petition to the.

18
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:26,923
[SPEAKER_05]: state house, as well as the approval of the wildlife feeding ordinances.

19
00:03:26,943 --> 00:03:43,596
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of other financial things that were also done on September 10th, the electrical vehicle charging revolving fund and the refunding loan order, essentially to get better rates on some city bonds.

20
00:03:45,157 --> 00:03:46,238
[SPEAKER_05]: September 17th also,

21
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,807
[SPEAKER_05]: approved late night hours for Panda Express.

22
00:03:52,807 --> 00:04:07,891
[SPEAKER_05]: And on July 23rd, this details how we chose to not move forward with a second independent audit of the city, since we already had an independent audit every year, as noted during the meeting in July.

23
00:04:07,911 --> 00:04:15,213
[SPEAKER_05]: And just some of the individual committees are only just starting to meet again.

24
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,714
[SPEAKER_05]: So the governance committee, I noted here how

25
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:35,230
[SPEAKER_05]: It hasn't met, but it did receive a referral from a regular meeting to start considering charter reforms.

26
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,291
[SPEAKER_05]: The Charter Study Committee wraps up its work.

27
00:04:38,352 --> 00:04:42,655
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's just a mechanism, essentially, to start discussing that process.

28
00:04:44,875 --> 00:05:05,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Planning and permitting committee did meet over the summer and this just goes over some of the activity that we've been doing for INS Associates and the planning department and the public health and community safety committee worked on the wildlife feeding ordinance.

29
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Noticing a typo here just now.

30
00:05:13,044 --> 00:05:17,048
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think, uh, Emily, uh, Councilor Lazaro.

31
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:36,567
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're casual in the committee meetings, but, um, the, uh, one comment about the public health and community safety committee, um, the, I appreciate the ordinance will allow the city to step in if and only if there's a problem that neighbors are complaining about, uh,

32
00:05:38,308 --> 00:05:40,910
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, it specifically allows people to have bird feeders.

33
00:05:41,751 --> 00:06:05,192
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure, so, and maybe I'm too close to this discussion since I was leading all of the meetings and I feel like the wildlife feeding ordinance is something that, because I discussed it at great length, I feel like I would want to say more than this, but I don't want the newsletter to be overrun with

34
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:34,364
[SPEAKER_01]: our back and forth discussions of the Wildlife Feeding Ordinance, but I think I would wanna say the purpose of the ordinance is to avoid, I think we can be more direct about what it was about, which was that it was like, in that committee, we drafted and thoroughly discussed the Wildlife Feeding Ordinance.

35
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:47,826
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which, you know, can you just tell me verbatim what, uh, yeah, I think I'm just thinking about like what, what it should say, and I'm not ready for it to be verbatim just yet, but I'd like to hear sort of your thoughts as I say them.

36
00:06:48,406 --> 00:07:01,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think I would just want to say that the point of it was to, um, make sure that folks are not feeding wild animals intentionally aside from birds using bird feeders.

37
00:07:02,898 --> 00:07:04,319
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you can say that in one sentence.

38
00:07:08,223 --> 00:07:17,127
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be something that you could, what's the word I'm looking for?

39
00:07:17,827 --> 00:07:20,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that you could enforce, that's the word.

40
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:27,872
[SPEAKER_01]: This ordinance would be something that you could enforce only if there are complaints about a nuisance.

41
00:07:29,393 --> 00:07:31,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that would be enforced only if there were complaints about a nuisance.

42
00:07:35,543 --> 00:07:40,144
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm just I'm trying to simplify and be like a little bit more specific.

43
00:07:54,688 --> 00:07:54,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

44
00:07:58,589 --> 00:07:58,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

45
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:00,769
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

46
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:01,869
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think we can cut.

47
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,370
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think you can cut from

48
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,372
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think you can say it allows people to have bird feeders.

49
00:08:15,274 --> 00:08:15,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Callahan.

50
00:08:18,355 --> 00:08:18,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

51
00:08:19,396 --> 00:08:27,220
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be nice to say something like the city council is taking the issue of rodents in our city seriously.

52
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Like start off with sort of the purpose of the wildlife feeding ordinance.

53
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:47,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you recommending to start off this whole paragraph by saying the city is working very hard to address the rodent problem?

54
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, exactly.

55
00:08:48,601 --> 00:08:51,323
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Wildlife Feeding Ordinance is one of our tools.

56
00:08:52,744 --> 00:09:00,308
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that just helps people to kind of understand, like, if I just see the Wildlife Feeding Ordinance, I don't really know what that is.

57
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:04,871
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, if it's like, we're taking rodents seriously, and this is one of our tools for doing it.

58
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,722
[SPEAKER_01]: I would fully concur with that.

59
00:09:10,805 --> 00:09:12,467
[SPEAKER_10]: What about overgrowth ordinance?

60
00:09:24,861 --> 00:09:27,703
[SPEAKER_01]: The overgrowth ordinance, we just are beginning.

61
00:09:27,823 --> 00:09:29,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we did begin discussing that.

62
00:09:29,965 --> 00:09:31,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, and that was this month.

63
00:09:31,506 --> 00:09:33,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, did we begin discussing that?

64
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:34,868
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about it.

65
00:09:35,248 --> 00:09:36,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Did we refer it to committee?

66
00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:37,450
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all turned around now.

67
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we did discuss that.

68
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,654
[SPEAKER_01]: We did discuss that this month.

69
00:09:44,735 --> 00:09:44,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

70
00:09:45,115 --> 00:09:46,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Overgrowth, and that's also rodent related.

71
00:09:46,996 --> 00:09:48,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

72
00:09:49,258 --> 00:09:52,861
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they were sort of mixed into that one committee meeting, but I don't know.

73
00:09:52,881 --> 00:09:53,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you're here.

74
00:09:54,215 --> 00:09:55,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, were you saying that outside?

75
00:10:01,156 --> 00:10:02,437
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of traffic today.

76
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:09,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so on that note, yeah, we can add in the overgrowth in that case because we did just talk about that as well.

77
00:10:13,099 --> 00:10:22,041
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really encompasses how much intentionality there is in that committee and in the council overall in the partnership with the Board of Health.

78
00:10:23,268 --> 00:10:25,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you look up the, wait, what was the date of this committee meeting again?

79
00:10:25,871 --> 00:10:38,344
[SPEAKER_10]: That's Tuesday, September 17th.

80
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:22,605
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I think we did work on both of that committee meeting.

81
00:11:22,645 --> 00:11:25,425
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe if my memory serves right, so I could just say that.

82
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,947
[SPEAKER_01]: And then begin the discussion of overgrowth.

83
00:11:35,747 --> 00:11:35,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

84
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,784
[SPEAKER_01]: The agenda's there, yeah.

85
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:41,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Make doubly sure.

86
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,725
[SPEAKER_01]: It does begin to blend together sometimes.

87
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:53,367
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think in that meeting we had two items.

88
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:05,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was an update to the rodent control.

89
00:12:05,836 --> 00:12:14,038
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had, right, because the wildlife feeding had already been approved and it was in first reading at the regular meeting.

90
00:12:14,478 --> 00:12:22,281
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was two additional ordinances that we were addressing to further hone the rodent control measures in the city.

91
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:27,982
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe we have two bullet points under public health and community safety and they're all rodent related.

92
00:12:28,002 --> 00:12:30,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, my memory is like...

93
00:13:08,425 --> 00:13:27,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, what was the, I'm just gonna go to another tab here.

94
00:13:34,432 --> 00:13:34,732
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was 17.

95
00:13:37,521 --> 00:13:42,444
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

96
00:13:43,104 --> 00:13:44,845
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have the one in August.

97
00:13:46,946 --> 00:13:47,166
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

98
00:13:47,186 --> 00:13:50,087
[SPEAKER_10]: That was, that was the August 13th.

99
00:13:50,107 --> 00:13:50,327
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

100
00:14:18,513 --> 00:14:22,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Callahan.

101
00:14:23,717 --> 00:14:26,119
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to update that next sentence a little bit.

102
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:30,862
[SPEAKER_04]: The purpose of this ordinance is to ensure that residents do not intentionally feed wildlife.

103
00:14:30,922 --> 00:14:31,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's quite right.

104
00:14:31,963 --> 00:14:38,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's more like do not feed unwanted wildlife.

105
00:14:39,408 --> 00:14:47,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's really the purpose is to make sure that, you know, people aren't accidentally providing food for pests.

106
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:49,508
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know exactly how to phrase that.

107
00:14:52,449 --> 00:15:00,052
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't think anybody's intentionally feeding rodents, right?

108
00:15:00,092 --> 00:15:02,112
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a thing.

109
00:15:02,172 --> 00:15:13,997
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like... And we don't have to spend forever on this, but... Maybe we can take that whole thing out of it.

110
00:15:14,837 --> 00:15:16,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we don't need an intentionality.

111
00:15:17,093 --> 00:15:19,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we did, we put the purpose at the top, so we can, yeah.

112
00:15:21,157 --> 00:15:22,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's enough.

113
00:15:26,882 --> 00:15:27,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Sang.

114
00:15:27,503 --> 00:15:33,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I just wanted to note, I had a comment after we finished talking about rodents.

115
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, can you speak up?

116
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:41,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to note that I have a comment after we talked about rodents.

117
00:15:54,795 --> 00:15:56,376
[SPEAKER_05]: My brain's blinking a little bit here.

118
00:15:56,557 --> 00:16:03,102
[SPEAKER_05]: What is a good way to summarize all the discussions on the overgrowth and rodent control ordinances?

119
00:16:03,222 --> 00:16:11,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are, to be honest, those are kind of like mixing together at this point for me, between the wildlife feeding and the overgrowth and rodent control.

120
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:36,946
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the crossed out stuff isn't going to be...

121
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:15,716
[SPEAKER_10]: This actually... This will ensure that residents don't feed on wildlife and only allow the city to step in if there is news.

122
00:17:16,676 --> 00:17:25,181
[SPEAKER_05]: In a sense, it will help us reduce our issues with rats and other unwanted animals.

123
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:28,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Additionally, I'm just going to say,

124
00:17:41,115 --> 00:17:41,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

125
00:17:44,577 --> 00:17:55,945
[SPEAKER_05]: And then again, I'm going, once I actually format this, I'm just going to blow it up with links to the actual drafts of the ordinances themselves, which is half the purpose of this thing to begin with.

126
00:17:58,287 --> 00:17:58,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

127
00:17:59,528 --> 00:18:08,674
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a bit of a bit of a long paragraph, but it basically summarizes that the public health and community safety committee is trying to work on the rodent issue.

128
00:18:13,297 --> 00:18:13,597
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

129
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:18,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Justin, how close are you to City Hall?

130
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:19,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Very close.

131
00:18:20,622 --> 00:18:24,424
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did have one note about the charter review part.

132
00:18:25,665 --> 00:18:31,309
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to just simplify the language a little bit and explain what it was.

133
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:39,194
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say instead of just charter reform, I would probably say work on reviewing the city charter.

134
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:50,362
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we could have one sentence explaining what the city charter is.

135
00:18:50,382 --> 00:19:02,247
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the way I think about it and the way that the law professors teach it is like it's a mini constitution for the city.

136
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if there's a better way to put it.

137
00:19:05,268 --> 00:19:13,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Trying to think of, I could just say mini constitution, but this is analogous to a constitution.

138
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:21,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Analogous might be too much of a word, or too big of a word, too complex.

139
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:23,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Anna might have an idea.

140
00:19:49,744 --> 00:19:51,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm currently outside the building.

141
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:52,547
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be up in one minute.

142
00:20:34,648 --> 00:20:40,129
[SPEAKER_11]: City Charters, the Charters.

143
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,311
[SPEAKER_05]: I should say finalizes.

144
00:20:51,952 --> 00:20:53,172
[SPEAKER_05]: City Charters, the Governor.

145
00:20:53,432 --> 00:20:57,553
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Councilor Seng has just entered the room.

146
00:21:18,855 --> 00:21:27,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I like things in lists of three but I'm having trouble thinking of something besides this as an example of what the charter covers.

147
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:38,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

148
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:05,653
[SPEAKER_07]: see that law school has been treating you well okay this should definitely go before because

149
00:22:42,183 --> 00:22:46,685
[SPEAKER_02]: and begins its work, to begin its work by reviewing the city charter.

150
00:22:50,367 --> 00:23:01,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Something about, I wanted to put in something about just like the, we're just gonna start by looking at the timeline and like big picture approaches to the city charter.

151
00:23:06,614 --> 00:23:06,754
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

152
00:23:09,534 --> 00:23:30,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to reassure some members of the Charter Study Committee that we value their input as well, and that we're going to wait for their final product, too.

153
00:23:30,572 --> 00:23:31,613
[SPEAKER_02]: To the members of the committee,

154
00:23:36,553 --> 00:23:37,914
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I mean, it could be extraneous.

155
00:23:38,655 --> 00:23:47,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that this is, I mean, it was, I think, I think this is work on the charter is probably going to be covered pretty extensively in future newsletters.

156
00:23:47,861 --> 00:23:51,764
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is really meant, I mean, really all that happened is that's fair.

157
00:23:51,784 --> 00:23:52,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we

158
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,772
[SPEAKER_05]: there was a resolution that was referred directly to committee.

159
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:56,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

160
00:23:57,113 --> 00:24:01,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, you know, I, I did see a member of the charter study committee on zoom.

161
00:24:01,377 --> 00:24:09,483
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope that she helps relay the message that we're not trying to step on anyone's toes here and that we're trying to, um, well, this can be open to public comment as well.

162
00:24:09,623 --> 00:24:09,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

163
00:24:29,931 --> 00:24:36,114
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that there is going to be inherently some overlap in terms of like, because we'll, I don't know who's on the committee.

164
00:24:36,134 --> 00:24:42,637
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like it'll overcomplicate it.

165
00:24:42,677 --> 00:24:43,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

166
00:24:54,426 --> 00:25:04,629
[SPEAKER_09]: to do this work, rather than, you know, if anybody, like, because this is for people who really don't know much about government, but it works just to help people understand things.

167
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:17,733
[SPEAKER_09]: And if they see that there's a charter structure that is not out there, that maybe you just rubber stamp with them, or that's their job, you know, but to make it clear that, like, the next

168
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:25,451
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that that's clear in the words begin its work.

169
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:29,732
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I, let's just not overcomplicate it then.

170
00:25:30,892 --> 00:25:31,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just keep it as is.

171
00:25:33,753 --> 00:25:34,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

172
00:25:34,753 --> 00:25:39,915
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking maybe finalize this recommendations or finalize its drafts.

173
00:25:40,435 --> 00:25:41,055
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's good.

174
00:25:48,517 --> 00:25:48,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

175
00:25:54,295 --> 00:25:54,495
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

176
00:25:54,855 --> 00:25:59,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, clarify Councilor, is Councilor Scarpelli here?

177
00:25:59,698 --> 00:26:12,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

178
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:16,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I'm going to go ahead.

179
00:26:16,327 --> 00:26:22,411
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, is there any other parts of the newsletter that folks would like to comment on?

180
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,276
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that we need to go over.

181
00:26:26,296 --> 00:26:33,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

182
00:26:35,379 --> 00:26:41,001
[SPEAKER_05]: In that case, is there any public, is there any public participation in this matter?

183
00:26:41,021 --> 00:26:45,502
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nobody currently in the chamber, but there are some folks on Zoom.

184
00:26:45,542 --> 00:26:51,224
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you'd like to offer input onto this current draft of the

185
00:26:53,433 --> 00:26:55,455
[SPEAKER_05]: under this current draft of the newsletter, feel free.

186
00:26:55,495 --> 00:27:02,901
[SPEAKER_05]: In that case, do we have a motion on the floor?

187
00:27:03,802 --> 00:27:06,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion approves it for publication.

188
00:27:06,344 --> 00:27:10,327
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a motion to approve for publication by Councilor Sang.

189
00:27:10,827 --> 00:27:11,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

190
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Councilor Lozaro.

191
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,042
[SPEAKER_05]: I did see iPhone on Zoom, but I'm not seeing it anymore.

192
00:27:24,903 --> 00:27:29,046
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think Councilor Scarpelli is on Zoom.

193
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:32,187
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can just do a voice vote.

194
00:27:32,728 --> 00:27:33,408
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

195
00:27:33,428 --> 00:27:34,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

196
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:35,169
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

197
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

198
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:40,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

199
00:27:40,873 --> 00:27:43,094
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get this formatted and hold on.

200
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:45,596
Oh.

201
00:27:48,137 --> 00:28:00,385
[SPEAKER_05]: did have a note from Zoom reminding members to turn their mics on when they talk just so that it can be, just so that everybody can hear them that's listening in and for the recording.

202
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:05,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

203
00:28:05,588 --> 00:28:13,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, 24370 offered by Councilor Sang, a resolution to create a residence guide to City Council's procedures and processes.

204
00:28:15,731 --> 00:28:21,255
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have the draft that Councilor Sang shared.

205
00:28:22,036 --> 00:28:36,327
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, apologies that this is not, this was not in the initial agenda, but folks put in some work over the weekend.

206
00:28:37,568 --> 00:28:41,751
[SPEAKER_05]: And if that is, all right, seems to be good.

207
00:28:42,452 --> 00:28:43,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Sang.

208
00:28:43,352 --> 00:28:43,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

209
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:53,421
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I put together given the comments from counselors at our last meeting about what they would like to see on the residence guide.

210
00:28:53,461 --> 00:28:56,582
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've included, I went back to watch the meeting.

211
00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:58,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've included everything.

212
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there is a lot of text on it.

213
00:29:00,924 --> 00:29:05,125
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if cutting text is something we want to do, I'm very open to it as well.

214
00:29:06,026 --> 00:29:10,587
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted to put everything that we had talked about on this first.

215
00:29:11,508 --> 00:29:12,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we spent

216
00:29:12,768 --> 00:29:19,270
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit of time at that last meeting about having something that prints on black and white as well.

217
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,810
[SPEAKER_02]: This should print well on black and white.

218
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,211
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is also visually appreciable.

219
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:35,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to put words in anyone's mouth, but I also think it's visually appealing enough for digital publication.

220
00:29:37,612 --> 00:29:39,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be happy to hear any comments.

221
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:50,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I can also make adjustments right now and send on my computer and then send it over to the chair and the clerk after we make edits as a committee.

222
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Just one that comes to mind.

223
00:29:55,582 --> 00:29:57,563
[SPEAKER_05]: It says that we pass

224
00:29:59,147 --> 00:30:00,247
[SPEAKER_05]: resolutions right there.

225
00:30:00,287 --> 00:30:02,368
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, or sorry, we pass ordinances right there.

226
00:30:02,388 --> 00:30:09,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that some, the use of the word resolution is also, would also be good just to kind of include right there.

227
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:18,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we pass resolutions, then an explanation of what that is, ordinances, and zoning regulations.

228
00:30:19,195 --> 00:30:27,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've actually gone back and forth on that one since I define ordinances up there.

229
00:30:28,218 --> 00:30:32,019
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't know whether we should define resolutions up there as well.

230
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:38,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there is a definition for resolution at the bottom of the commonly used terms table.

231
00:30:39,581 --> 00:30:42,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be happy to put it on if we don't think we have to define it.

232
00:30:43,963 --> 00:30:45,003
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a long definition.

233
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,201
[SPEAKER_02]: It could make sense just to write it on top as well.

234
00:30:56,123 --> 00:30:56,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Councillor Cownie.

235
00:30:57,023 --> 00:31:06,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I would lean toward, I agree with putting all three of those at the top because it is a thing that we do.

236
00:31:07,847 --> 00:31:14,829
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I would put ordinances, the definition of ordinance down with the commonly used terms and keep it out of that one line.

237
00:31:16,405 --> 00:31:16,725
[SPEAKER_04]: the top.

238
00:31:16,745 --> 00:31:17,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that make sense?

239
00:31:17,485 --> 00:31:18,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that makes sense.

240
00:31:18,686 --> 00:31:22,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Um I guess the only question then is, are we okay shrinking the font?

241
00:31:22,827 --> 00:31:27,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Um well, I would remove motion the previous, I can't see it cuz it's covered by the.

242
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:28,288
[SPEAKER_02]: We do take captions.

243
00:31:28,368 --> 00:31:29,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Um we do take motions to move.

244
00:31:30,068 --> 00:31:31,529
[SPEAKER_02]: We we do move the previous question.

245
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:32,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

246
00:31:32,489 --> 00:31:37,910
[SPEAKER_02]: We do move the we in in this session of the city council, we have moved the previous question quite a bit.

247
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:46,092
[SPEAKER_04]: I suspect that for people who are, you know, coming to their first city council meeting or something, that is not a thing they need to know.

248
00:31:47,551 --> 00:31:52,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just take that one out because I don't think it's like super important to know that one motion.

249
00:31:53,035 --> 00:31:56,037
[SPEAKER_04]: There's other stuff that we could put in there in terms of commonly used terms.

250
00:31:56,577 --> 00:31:59,499
[SPEAKER_04]: I would rather see ordinance than that one.

251
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,100
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I would do.

252
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I would remove that one and put in ordinance.

253
00:32:26,172 --> 00:32:27,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazaro.

254
00:32:28,975 --> 00:32:37,364
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I think what Councilor Seng was suggesting is you could almost say passing resolutions, ordinances, and zoning regulations.

255
00:32:37,464 --> 00:32:42,830
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be the first bullet, and then you could define all of those at the bottom in a little quick way.

256
00:32:44,326 --> 00:32:46,908
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to say, I kind of like that idea.

257
00:32:47,428 --> 00:32:53,793
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to say generally, and I was kind of alluding to this before the meeting began, but you all weren't privy to it.

258
00:32:53,913 --> 00:33:14,029
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, I think the way we have to think about the way that we're communicating with the public via this committee and as individuals, and just because we're a thousand blossoms blooming in the city, everybody takes in information in such a wide variety of different ways.

259
00:33:14,557 --> 00:33:21,120
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, this would be absolutely, I would be completely unable to comprehend this piece of paper.

260
00:33:22,261 --> 00:33:42,692
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand what it is now because I've done this work, but because of the way my brain operates and because of how quickly my eyes would gloss over looking at it, I think it's really useful for somebody who finds it really interesting and can process information without being actively involved in it.

261
00:33:44,008 --> 00:33:51,435
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if we print it out and laminate it and put it on the walls, it'll be useful for the sort of people that are interested in receiving information in that way.

262
00:33:51,455 --> 00:33:59,021
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the way that we think about it should be like giving information in a wide variety of different ways to people.

263
00:33:59,882 --> 00:34:04,106
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I'm sort of, as a courtesy to everybody,

264
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:10,441
[SPEAKER_01]: have to remove myself from having this conversation because I'm like, I don't understand who would ever receive information in this way.

265
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:11,622
[SPEAKER_01]: I know somebody does.

266
00:34:12,362 --> 00:34:13,883
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am not that person.

267
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:19,045
[SPEAKER_01]: I would need it to be like, on a bulletin board at like a children's section of a library.

268
00:34:20,006 --> 00:34:22,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Like big words and like, what's an ordinance?

269
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a worm explains it to me as it crawls out of an apple.

270
00:34:26,209 --> 00:34:28,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's so confusing.

271
00:34:28,751 --> 00:34:30,852
[SPEAKER_01]: And Robert's rules took me a long time to figure out.

272
00:34:31,232 --> 00:34:33,414
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's true for a lot of people, too.

273
00:34:34,234 --> 00:34:35,995
[SPEAKER_01]: But this stuff is all super true.

274
00:34:36,015 --> 00:34:38,156
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't believe you fit it all in a piece of paper.

275
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:39,157
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.

276
00:34:40,598 --> 00:34:43,400
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is, like, very applicable to the work that we do.

277
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:53,566
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of think that, like, this being, like, the most critical, most useful stuff that comes up every single time, almost, is amazing.

278
00:34:54,071 --> 00:34:56,212
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the people that it's going to work for, it's going to work really well.

279
00:34:56,793 --> 00:35:02,936
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we have to be super nitpicky about it, because again, like for the people that are going to read it, they're going to be like, wow, this is great.

280
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:15,903
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we put it up on the walls, and even I think also maybe having a few copies for people to hang on to, especially if it's a long meeting and they're waiting for their turn, and they can maybe hang on to eliminated copy and like look through it while they wait, that would be really useful too.

281
00:35:16,963 --> 00:35:18,404
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does make me think like,

282
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:32,708
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the ways that we can present this in like bigger words, like easily accessible for people that maybe have a different like neuro-processing way of doing things, like maybe I do, a lot of people I know.

283
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:38,392
[SPEAKER_01]: So like that kind of thing would be an interesting thing to discuss as like a next step too.

284
00:35:39,453 --> 00:35:47,758
[SPEAKER_01]: But thank you so much, Justin, or Councilor Singh, for putting this together because it is super thorough and for what it is, really clear, I think.

285
00:35:53,206 --> 00:36:03,712
[SPEAKER_05]: just to follow up on that, there always is a balance that needs to be struck with these kinds of things.

286
00:36:03,772 --> 00:36:19,822
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think that we can write, I don't think we can write anything down on a piece of paper that will work for every single person.

287
00:36:19,922 --> 00:36:21,103
[SPEAKER_05]: What I think would happen is,

288
00:36:22,851 --> 00:36:30,574
[SPEAKER_05]: matter what we end up approving in this committee, it'll go out and then people, some people will really help out.

289
00:36:30,614 --> 00:36:37,657
[SPEAKER_05]: I think overall do very good, but people will also start to come to us with like problems with like, I had no idea what I was talking about here.

290
00:36:38,117 --> 00:36:41,459
[SPEAKER_05]: And over time, we'll get real world feedback from that.

291
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:44,040
[SPEAKER_05]: So it could be a process whereby we could go back and

292
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,461
[SPEAKER_05]: update it later.

293
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:52,029
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a way to say that I completely agree with everything that Councilor Lozaro said.

294
00:36:52,049 --> 00:37:02,281
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not opposed to releasing an imperfect product because I don't think that, I think that any discussions we have here

295
00:37:03,646 --> 00:37:17,984
[SPEAKER_05]: we'll just end up becoming theoretical and the best feedback we'll get is if we release something and then people use it and then bring that to us over time so we could release a version two, you know, after a while.

296
00:37:19,546 --> 00:37:20,868
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my thoughts on that.

297
00:37:20,928 --> 00:37:21,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Callahan.

298
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

299
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:29,003
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that what Councilor Lozano was saying was that this is going to be improved.

300
00:37:29,043 --> 00:37:32,565
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that there are different people who understand things in different ways.

301
00:37:33,525 --> 00:37:34,446
[SPEAKER_04]: And I completely agree.

302
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:36,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is fantastic for what it is.

303
00:37:36,627 --> 00:37:43,690
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the idea of laminated copies being in this room for people to just like maybe on every row, there's a copy and people can look at it.

304
00:37:45,772 --> 00:37:50,614
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would love to offer to work with Councilor Lozano on the apples and worms version.

305
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:58,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Sang.

306
00:37:59,081 --> 00:37:59,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

307
00:37:59,482 --> 00:38:02,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I totally agree with what's been said.

308
00:38:02,105 --> 00:38:05,910
[SPEAKER_02]: This is definitely not the most accessible form for everyone.

309
00:38:06,731 --> 00:38:08,232
[SPEAKER_02]: It will work for some people.

310
00:38:11,161 --> 00:38:14,883
[SPEAKER_02]: The way I viewed it is I was given a task to put all this information on one sheet of paper.

311
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:27,488
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would really love if we could think more about how else we can get this type of information out in a way that more people can digest as well.

312
00:38:30,123 --> 00:38:34,672
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, no, I would love to talk about that as a council or committee.

313
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:38,919
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a few small tweaks that I've been making right now.

314
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I received a comment that

315
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually, you know, if folks attend in person, they can sign up with City Messenger.

316
00:38:48,221 --> 00:38:52,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, our City Messenger is out.

317
00:38:53,402 --> 00:38:57,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we, there's usually a signup sheet at the desk.

318
00:38:57,404 --> 00:39:01,545
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that we could still, we should still think about putting on this.

319
00:39:01,845 --> 00:39:04,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the city clerk can give us his thoughts on that.

320
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:06,666
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's some smaller edits.

321
00:39:06,686 --> 00:39:09,927
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just added the YouTube channel on the, at the,

322
00:39:11,781 --> 00:39:14,123
[SPEAKER_02]: the mention of the YouTube channel at the bottom.

323
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:24,291
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, I saw in the newsletter for the summer that there, um, that there is a bitly link for the city, city council newsletter sign up.

324
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:27,213
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've replaced the clerk's email with that link as well.

325
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:34,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Council Lazzaro.

326
00:39:34,718 --> 00:39:35,739
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it looks really good.

327
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, again, I really appreciate the work you've done, Councilor Singh.

328
00:39:40,677 --> 00:39:54,723
[SPEAKER_01]: I especially like how to participate that sort of outlines the ways that if you're in the chambers, if you're on Zoom, we've had people with a lot of confusion about how to participate on Zoom, the raise hand, the ask, I've asked you to unmute, like that kind of stuff.

329
00:39:54,783 --> 00:40:02,707
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, just the, I think it's really good for where we're at right now.

330
00:40:02,907 --> 00:40:07,949
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we should move ahead and, you know, see if we can get it out in the room

331
00:40:09,397 --> 00:40:13,559
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would motion to move that process forward however we can.

332
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:18,141
[SPEAKER_01]: If we need to get it approved by the full council, I would motion that we bring it to the full council.

333
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:26,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think this would need to be referred to, I think a good way to form that motion would be to,

334
00:40:27,706 --> 00:40:37,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Um move this for approval to the regular council subject to the edits that we've given to councilor saying this session.

335
00:40:37,933 --> 00:40:43,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we do that, I just wanted to ask, is there any public participation?

336
00:40:43,077 --> 00:40:48,780
[SPEAKER_05]: I see we have some folks on Zoom who might want to offer input on this.

337
00:40:48,801 --> 00:40:52,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I'm not seeing any raised hands.

338
00:40:53,003 --> 00:40:53,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.

339
00:40:53,744 --> 00:40:56,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we have Eileen

340
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Learner on Zoom.

341
00:40:58,835 --> 00:40:59,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on a minute.

342
00:41:01,282 --> 00:41:04,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, I have to unmute.

343
00:41:06,892 --> 00:41:10,635
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Eileen Lerner from 9 Adams Circle in Medford.

344
00:41:11,596 --> 00:41:22,065
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed that once again, we see that in order to participate in public comment, one has to stand online.

345
00:41:22,285 --> 00:41:34,996
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wonder what happened to the idea of a signup sheet, because older people and disabled people may not be able to stand online and so may be deprived of the right to comment.

346
00:41:37,794 --> 00:41:57,409
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think, I believe that Councilor Sang, we saw your comment in the chat and I believe Councilor Sang just said that he would add something to the participation rules about the fact that we will have a sign up sheet and typically do.

347
00:41:57,489 --> 00:42:02,452
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just our, we don't have a city messenger at the moment.

348
00:42:02,492 --> 00:42:05,334
[SPEAKER_05]: So that might've been why this particular draft

349
00:42:07,765 --> 00:42:08,906
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't include that.

350
00:42:10,046 --> 00:42:23,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and it seems like if we do go to that, which seems much fairer, that we have to let people know that that's a possibility and that they need to sign up to speak.

351
00:42:28,073 --> 00:42:28,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tsang?

352
00:42:29,874 --> 00:42:30,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yep.

353
00:42:31,434 --> 00:42:32,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Justin just said that he

354
00:42:34,535 --> 00:42:35,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Justin just said that he added it.

355
00:42:35,756 --> 00:42:48,800
[SPEAKER_05]: So the version that we refer to the regular council meeting will have will tell people explicitly that they can sign up to participate and don't have to wait in line.

356
00:42:50,241 --> 00:42:51,521
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you very much.

357
00:42:52,562 --> 00:42:53,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Eileen.

358
00:42:57,864 --> 00:42:58,864
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a motion on the floor.

359
00:43:00,365 --> 00:43:02,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the motion is to

360
00:43:04,022 --> 00:43:08,566
[SPEAKER_01]: refer this paper, no.

361
00:43:08,606 --> 00:43:16,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Refer the paper to the regular meeting subject to the edits that were discussed.

362
00:43:16,092 --> 00:43:18,654
[SPEAKER_05]: That were recommended at this meeting.

363
00:43:18,674 --> 00:43:19,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

364
00:43:19,895 --> 00:43:21,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

365
00:43:23,198 --> 00:43:24,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Clerk, do you have that written down?

366
00:43:30,643 --> 00:43:31,263
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

367
00:43:31,283 --> 00:43:32,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

368
00:43:32,864 --> 00:43:33,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Opposed?

369
00:43:33,925 --> 00:43:34,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passed.

370
00:43:36,427 --> 00:43:36,807
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

371
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:40,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any other motions on the floor?

372
00:43:45,012 --> 00:43:45,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to adjourn.

373
00:43:45,913 --> 00:43:47,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a second to that motion?

374
00:43:47,054 --> 00:43:47,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

375
00:43:49,395 --> 00:43:50,156
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

376
00:43:50,176 --> 00:43:50,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

377
00:43:51,176 --> 00:43:51,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Opposed?

378
00:43:52,097 --> 00:43:52,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

379
00:43:52,857 --> 00:43:55,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passed 3 to 1.

380
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:56,460
All right.

381
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, everybody.

382
00:44:02,162 --> 00:44:04,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a wonderful Tuesday.
