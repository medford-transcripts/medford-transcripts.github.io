[SPEAKER_01]: And our agenda today, our topics today are really to

31
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:18,734
[SPEAKER_01]: build a plan to collect community input for our strategic plan.

32
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:26,239
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will identify actions we will take to collect community input regarding the MPS strategic plan.

33
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,900
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will take attendance.

[SPEAKER_01]: And Member McLaughlin?

38
00:05:35,484 --> 00:05:35,684
[SPEAKER_01]: Here.

39
00:05:36,845 --> 00:05:38,286
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, three absent.

40
00:05:39,427 --> 00:05:40,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, three present, none absent.

41
00:05:43,555 --> 00:05:47,817
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked about two things in our last meeting.

42
00:05:47,977 --> 00:05:56,441
[SPEAKER_01]: One is some round tables specifically geared toward the strategic plan itself.

43
00:05:57,202 --> 00:05:59,523
[SPEAKER_01]: So separate and apart from the listening sessions that are happening.

44
00:05:59,963 --> 00:06:07,667
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also talked about a survey for those who can't participate in the Zoom session.

45
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:10,088
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually did take

46
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:16,500
[SPEAKER_01]: a crack at a draft of all of this and I'm gonna share my screen.

47
00:06:24,525 --> 00:06:26,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you see my screen?

48
00:06:26,306 --> 00:06:29,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, not yet.

49
00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:31,829
[SPEAKER_01]: How about now?

50
00:06:38,592 --> 00:06:39,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

51
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:40,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.

52
00:06:42,044 --> 00:06:43,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

53
00:06:43,145 --> 00:06:59,938
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, what I did was just try to do some thinking around like what, you know, when we talk about a strategic plan and the kind of input we want from the community, how do we collect that input in a meaningful way?

54
00:06:59,998 --> 00:07:08,525
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one of the keys when you embark on strategic planning is that you sort of separate the like,

55
00:07:09,489 --> 00:07:21,427
[SPEAKER_01]: The aspirational goal, or the what from the how, and I think when we, you know what I tried to do was say that, you know, we want to know about the what from the community so what.

56
00:07:23,505 --> 00:07:25,966
[SPEAKER_01]: are we trying to accomplish with this strategic plan?

57
00:07:27,086 --> 00:07:35,690
[SPEAKER_01]: The how is uniquely something that the people sort of in the inner workings of the organization have to ultimately come up with to align to that what.

58
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:47,394
[SPEAKER_01]: So I first did some digging and said, okay, when we talk about a strategic plan, it should always be anchored to our mission and our vision.

59
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:53,297
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went out on the website and there were two different mission statements on the website.

60
00:07:55,498 --> 00:08:05,445
[SPEAKER_01]: One sort of really short for MPS and then something longer for Medford High.

61
00:08:07,526 --> 00:08:13,449
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was no like stated vision statement on the web.

62
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:26,055
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just say that to say that maybe those things exist and I just didn't put my hands on them on the website, but I'm just sharing with you what I did find.

63
00:08:28,516 --> 00:08:31,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think it's important as we talk about sort of a precursor to the,

64
00:08:33,091 --> 00:08:36,955
[SPEAKER_01]: sessions that I was thinking about in terms of collecting community input.

65
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:49,268
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, and there's one more bullet at the bottom of that, become contributing citizens in a global society.

66
00:08:49,288 --> 00:08:53,533
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I think one question that I have is,

67
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:11,298
[SPEAKER_01]: When we talk about our vision, our mission, and our vision with Medford Public School, for Medford Public Schools in general, are these the right, like, what is the stated mission and vision of the district?

68
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:22,905
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, you know, I didn't, wasn't able to put my hands on it as I was planning, so I just tried to sort of navigate around that a little bit, but that's an obvious question that we'll have to answer before we

69
00:09:25,668 --> 00:09:26,649
[SPEAKER_01]: go into the details.

70
00:09:27,729 --> 00:09:51,764
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I thought about the round table structure, what I tried to do was say, you know, what questions could we be asking the community to weigh in on that would allow us to sort of, us, you know, certainly the administration, but also the school committee as the policy makers and setters,

71
00:09:53,770 --> 00:10:10,915
[SPEAKER_01]: to sort of understand what the community expects from this endeavor so that when we lay out our set of steps, when we aggregate the things that we're doing, we can be guided by that overall expectation from our mission and our vision statement.

72
00:10:11,535 --> 00:10:15,836
[SPEAKER_01]: And often when I work with clients on strategic plans,

73
00:10:16,602 --> 00:10:31,808
[SPEAKER_01]: the first thing that becomes clear is the vision and the mission are stale or dated or need some revision to sort of be relevant to what is going on in the current planning efforts.

74
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:40,251
[SPEAKER_01]: So really the three questions that I thought we would ask during our round tables

75
00:10:41,377 --> 00:10:49,926
[SPEAKER_01]: right here, and we can talk about sort of the structure of the roundtables separately, but to me, I have three questions.

76
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:55,552
[SPEAKER_01]: So does Medford Public Schools' current mission statement accurately describe

77
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:02,674
[SPEAKER_01]: the long range goals you feel MPS should aspire to, why or not, why not, and what changes or suggestions do you have?

78
00:11:02,694 --> 00:11:04,355
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's question number one.

79
00:11:05,395 --> 00:11:14,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Question number two, does MPS's current vision statement adequately describe what you feel MPS should achieve in the next X number of years?

80
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,462
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said X because,

81
00:11:17,997 --> 00:11:30,788
[SPEAKER_01]: a strategic plan usually does lay out a path to a date in the future that says like, this is where we're going and this is when we will arrive at this new place in terms of the vision.

82
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:36,052
[SPEAKER_01]: And why or why not and what input changes or suggestions do you have?

83
00:11:36,672 --> 00:11:44,879
[SPEAKER_01]: And then third question, what key actions does MPS need to take to demonstrate forward progress toward our vision in

84
00:11:47,692 --> 00:11:56,958
[SPEAKER_01]: x, you know, in whatever year it is that the strategic plan is intended to take us to and in what timeframe would those steps have to be taken.

85
00:11:57,058 --> 00:12:14,688
[SPEAKER_01]: So in trying to think about how to ask questions that can be meaningful input for all of us and also be questions that truly the public is positioned to weigh in on, that was sort of what I came up with as a starting point

86
00:12:15,315 --> 00:12:17,396
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was hoping we could talk about that today.

87
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:29,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Overall, my thought was an hour and a half roundtable would give us some time to bring people in, do some introduction, set the groundwork of what

88
00:12:30,853 --> 00:12:32,854
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we are doing the strategic planning effort.

89
00:12:33,014 --> 00:12:35,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is our current vision and mission.

90
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:41,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if there was something sort of new that we wanted to ask people to react to, we could do that as well.

91
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Break people out for about an hour, bring everybody back for a recap.

92
00:12:47,484 --> 00:12:50,406
[SPEAKER_01]: So try to keep it pretty simple in structure.

93
00:12:50,426 --> 00:12:56,550
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we now have breakout room capabilities we didn't have last year, which hopefully will be really, really helpful as well.

94
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:24,247
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in terms of like the organization of the breakout rooms, sort of my thought was that we would break it somewhat by level, but also understand that there are special populations out there that may have their own sort of community around what they're wanting to see or aspire to.

95
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:35,832
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there may be a group of folks from a special education perspective or an English learner perspective and groups that can be supported by a translator.

96
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:40,134
[SPEAKER_01]: But fundamentally, I'll be asking these same three questions.

97
00:13:41,915 --> 00:13:49,138
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll stop there and ask for thoughts, questions, comments, changes, feedback.

98
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,564
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the I was going to just jump in.

99
00:13:57,584 --> 00:14:09,355
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask, is it possible for you to just make it a little larger I Maybe like 150 yeah let me next to the under the word insert

100
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:12,959
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, geez.

101
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:16,700
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that better?

102
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,581
[SPEAKER_00]: That just makes it a little easier to see.

103
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:38,164
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the proposed structure that you want for the round tables to have, and then to have the specialized breakout groups by EL with translation, special education, elementary, middle, and high.

104
00:14:38,705 --> 00:14:46,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and those were sort of the groups that jumped out at me and I know back in the spring, we had questions around like,

105
00:14:48,948 --> 00:14:58,356
[SPEAKER_01]: We had topical breakouts, but we also had people who had really different perspectives and experiences because of the levels their kids were at, et cetera.

106
00:14:58,457 --> 00:15:03,241
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually went back and looked at how we did those.

107
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:05,803
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were sort of two factors that

108
00:15:09,623 --> 00:15:10,684
[SPEAKER_01]: would identify people.

109
00:15:10,824 --> 00:15:17,690
[SPEAKER_01]: One was like this like leveling where you sort of sit in the world question.

110
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,052
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other was like the topical question.

111
00:15:20,092 --> 00:15:26,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when we were doing it last time, we were talking about athletics and extracurriculars and curriculum and instruction.

112
00:15:26,056 --> 00:15:30,060
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, so people were in lots of different categories for that reason.

113
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,243
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this time we don't have two dimensions there.

114
00:15:34,383 --> 00:15:38,286
[SPEAKER_01]: So that makes life a little bit easier because the same three questions

115
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:44,191
[SPEAKER_01]: apply when you talk about the vision and the mission and like action steps.

116
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,334
[SPEAKER_01]: no matter what your subgroup is.

117
00:15:49,834 --> 00:15:58,320
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that makes it a little bit less complicated and Zoom has gotten markedly better about how you identify people.

118
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,162
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is always helpful as well.

119
00:16:02,343 --> 00:16:04,464
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was my thought.

120
00:16:04,684 --> 00:16:13,530
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not tied to that at all, but that was as I was thinking about trying to put together a straw man for us to react to sort of where my head went to.

121
00:16:16,465 --> 00:16:36,998
[SPEAKER_00]: My wondering or my question regarding question number one about the long range goals, like, you know, redoing the vision statement or updating it or having a collaborative process for mission, vision statement.

122
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,583
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, you know, that's a great process to definitely go through with the community.

123
00:16:44,845 --> 00:17:05,470
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the long range goals, I guess my wondering is, are we talking from what's happening instructionally and academically and programming that I don't know if you were thinking about those goals as well because that's a different

124
00:17:06,364 --> 00:17:15,029
[SPEAKER_00]: arena, where I could end up with 15 people saying I like this program that program and the superintendent.

125
00:17:15,649 --> 00:17:24,735
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of like the instructional piece of how instruction is is delivered in the classroom would fall.

126
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:38,143
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath my umbrella in terms of what's happening specifically in the classrooms or how the instruction is being delivered and working with administration and those pieces.

127
00:17:38,944 --> 00:17:49,812
[SPEAKER_00]: But like long-range goals, I just was trying to understand, is it physical plant long-range goals, offering additional language

128
00:17:50,665 --> 00:18:03,432
[SPEAKER_00]: things, different coursework, because it was kind of open ended and broad, I just wasn't sure what you were thinking in that first question there.

129
00:18:03,972 --> 00:18:07,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I think that's actually a really good question.

130
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:08,094
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean,

131
00:18:10,124 --> 00:18:16,790
[SPEAKER_01]: when you talk about a mission, I always think about that as like, the reason we get out of bed in the morning, that's the mission, right?

132
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:30,163
[SPEAKER_01]: So the mission is something that sort of stands, ideally stands the test of time to some degree, although language, you know, always is worth looking at.

133
00:18:31,204 --> 00:18:34,086
[SPEAKER_01]: But the vision, to me, the vision is where you say like,

134
00:18:35,143 --> 00:18:52,001
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, this is what it's going to look like at the end of this strategic plan, and, and I went back and looked at a couple of strategic plans that I had poked in on last year when we were going through it and I think, you know, Lexington's certainly does a really nice job of like.

135
00:18:53,002 --> 00:18:56,544
[SPEAKER_01]: wrapping you in a warm hug when you read it.

136
00:18:56,944 --> 00:19:18,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the mission is compelling, the vision just sort of jumps off the page at you, but the distinguishing characteristics, they actually sort of define in their strategic plan, which I think is important because many people think of those two things as exactly the same, like mission and vision are the same, or they talk about them in the same breath.

137
00:19:19,095 --> 00:19:24,918
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when you talk about them differently, you can get sort of different things out of them.

138
00:19:25,118 --> 00:19:39,026
[SPEAKER_01]: But to your point, we can and should expect that the community will come to us with the things on their mind, and they will put them in whatever bucket it goes in.

139
00:19:39,326 --> 00:19:46,070
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't mean just because somebody wants our mission to be having a winning football team that that becomes the mission.

140
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:56,891
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to ask the question sort of in, what I envisioned is we would talk about these three things as a grounding statement at the beginning.

141
00:19:57,412 --> 00:20:03,978
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we would let the community tell us what they think about the answers to these questions.

142
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:14,467
[SPEAKER_01]: We would capture the feedback and that would become input for not just the school committee, but also the administration as we talk about like, how do we unveil

143
00:20:15,634 --> 00:20:16,174
[SPEAKER_01]: our plan.

144
00:20:16,234 --> 00:20:21,777
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we don't know, will the entire community be like, yeah, our mission statement is fine.

145
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:23,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Like maybe I'm the only one that doesn't like it.

146
00:20:23,718 --> 00:20:25,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe Melanie is the only one that doesn't like it.

147
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:33,624
[SPEAKER_01]: But we, I think we need to ask to really sort of know, is it

148
00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:36,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the words?

149
00:20:37,131 --> 00:20:39,954
[SPEAKER_01]: People like the words, people don't like the words.

150
00:20:40,074 --> 00:20:41,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the intent of the words?

151
00:20:41,977 --> 00:20:43,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it something else entirely?

152
00:20:43,098 --> 00:20:49,566
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do think we will get a lot of varied input in these sessions.

153
00:20:50,367 --> 00:20:53,932
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think sort of classifying and categorizing them.

154
00:20:54,555 --> 00:21:02,258
[SPEAKER_01]: what somebody says is a mission statement response may actually be an action step.

155
00:21:03,518 --> 00:21:10,120
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think either way, collecting the feedback from the community is important and valuable.

156
00:21:12,461 --> 00:21:18,563
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing we'll talk about in a little bit is a survey that we can follow up with.

157
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:22,764
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was sort of how I was thinking about it.

158
00:21:22,784 --> 00:21:24,385
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?

159
00:21:26,357 --> 00:21:27,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Melanie.

160
00:21:31,868 --> 00:21:32,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you.

161
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:34,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I am curious.

162
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:53,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that for the, it would be really helpful for these breakouts to be able to see the data from the last session that we had and where people shared their ideas and thoughts with us about what they wanted done and what they, you know, thought we needed to work on from last time.

163
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:59,691
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that this is sort of a different ask in terms of like focusing really on the mission and vision so that

164
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:19,798
[SPEAKER_02]: we're backing into these questions and that it's not sort of this abstract, but I'd love to see, you know, a summary of sort of, I feel like, you know, we spent a good amount of time at these round tables last year really talking and I thought did our group, you know, had some great suggestions and we did a lot of that work shopping.

165
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:23,279
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be great to have sort of a summary of that.

166
00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:35,265
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, either as part of this presentation before we start or something to ground us for where we are and what people have already said they wanted so that we're not feeling like we're starting from scratch.

167
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:50,849
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing to think about from my perspective is that that set of roundtables was so squarely talking about back to school in COVID.

168
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:58,892
[SPEAKER_01]: it will be a challenge to not talk about COVID here.

169
00:22:58,912 --> 00:23:02,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, just for a point of information, not that one.

170
00:23:02,073 --> 00:23:05,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking, what was the one that we had at the library pre-COVID?

171
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:06,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Zoom.

172
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:10,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember the mayor's transition planning session?

173
00:23:10,577 --> 00:23:12,077
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was specific to school.

174
00:23:12,097 --> 00:23:13,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

175
00:23:13,638 --> 00:23:14,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that it?

176
00:23:14,218 --> 00:23:15,318
[SPEAKER_03]: The mayor's transition planning?

177
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:17,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but it was very specific to school.

178
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:17,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

179
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:17,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

180
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:18,820
[SPEAKER_01]: That one.

181
00:23:20,478 --> 00:23:21,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah and that's been summarized.

182
00:23:22,418 --> 00:23:25,859
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure the mayor can resurface that as input.

183
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be really helpful just to have that as a ground and you're right.

184
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:47,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the one you know in between those was certainly very specific to the back to school and COVID and you know yeah I think you're right about sort of having us you know be specific so that we're not being derailed on a lot of the you know back to school questions and concerns because those are going to be a big part understandably.

185
00:23:48,923 --> 00:23:50,804
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we need some grounding too.

186
00:23:51,204 --> 00:24:00,369
[SPEAKER_02]: And also I think it's really helpful and I'm happy to reach out if people want me to whatever to the mayor for that info and also even for the others, the second round table.

187
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:08,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just really helpful for people to see that we value the work they've already put in and that we've heard them and we have really summary of that information.

188
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:15,938
[SPEAKER_02]: So we haven't forgotten about that because I feel like if I was a constituent and I was being asked to come to this again, I'd be like,

189
00:24:16,478 --> 00:24:40,715
[SPEAKER_02]: you know haven't we done this like a couple times already like we you know and and although this is different um and it's you know post a year's long pandemic um i want to see that we that that we we've been heard and that you know the constituents feel like they've been heard so i'm happy to reach out to jackie or the mayor for that um round table for the mayor's uh specific to education if you guys want so we could see those

190
00:24:41,235 --> 00:24:45,819
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, maybe there could be a summary sheet for the back to school as well.

191
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:59,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think there will be some crossover, because I think there are some themes that are universal outside of the back to school piece, which, you know, again, just sort of whether we're meeting, you know, equity, for example, right?

192
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:02,651
[SPEAKER_02]: That's universal across all three of those pieces.

193
00:25:02,912 --> 00:25:03,152
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

194
00:25:03,172 --> 00:25:03,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

195
00:25:06,694 --> 00:25:07,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

196
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:27,134
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, perhaps there's a way to weave in even the round tables that we did last year around back to school, as we would announce these round tables to say, you know, among the great feedback and suggestions we got in those round tables were these things.

197
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:33,059
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we use them as we built our back to school plan and our task force and all that stuff.

198
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:35,961
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's an opportunity to sort of connect back to like,

199
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:39,682
[SPEAKER_01]: the value of the input of the community there as well.

200
00:25:40,948 --> 00:25:41,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Kathy?

201
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:45,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

202
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:49,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for providing us with this nice plan.

203
00:25:49,063 --> 00:25:51,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think this is, it looks good.

204
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:52,246
[SPEAKER_04]: The questions look good.

205
00:25:52,686 --> 00:25:55,149
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and I do appreciate Ms.

206
00:25:55,189 --> 00:25:56,690
[SPEAKER_04]: McLaughlin reaching out to the mayor.

207
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be helpful information.

208
00:25:58,692 --> 00:26:07,199
[SPEAKER_04]: I did attend that meeting at the library and we were split up into groups and we did talk a little bit about, you know, strategic plan education.

209
00:26:07,219 --> 00:26:10,722
[SPEAKER_04]: There was like a little bit of a mix so that I do remember that meeting.

210
00:26:11,242 --> 00:26:12,764
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when we,

211
00:26:13,444 --> 00:26:19,412
[SPEAKER_04]: When we begin the process to invite people to this the roundtable meetings.

212
00:26:20,574 --> 00:26:28,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Will there be like a little, like a little background like with the current mission statement, what it is currently, you know what's the current vision statement.

213
00:26:29,325 --> 00:26:43,496
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and maybe a little background with the meeting that was at the library, just a brief, you know, summary so that when it's shared, people know, you know, well, this is what this meeting is about.

214
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:45,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we're going to be reviewing the mission statement.

215
00:26:46,118 --> 00:26:54,825
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe they can come to the meeting ready with, you know, ideas and questions, you know, or suggestions or feedback.

216
00:26:55,605 --> 00:26:56,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wondering.

217
00:26:56,226 --> 00:26:58,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that's a great idea.

218
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

219
00:27:05,141 --> 00:27:19,149
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna say, my only ask would be where one of the things that is going to be critically important, and I know we're on a tight timetable, is to really

220
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:33,356
[SPEAKER_00]: try to get the strategic plan to a place where we are able to be using that to guide all the work that we're doing moving forward.

221
00:27:34,056 --> 00:27:37,277
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm only restating that because

222
00:27:40,853 --> 00:27:48,259
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of how we know everything is aligned and we're kind of moving in the same direction and getting that traction.

223
00:27:48,899 --> 00:28:02,170
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mission and the vision work, it's important to get that buy-in, to have everyone strongly be able to be committed to something that the community feels is a compelling statement.

224
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:18,645
[SPEAKER_00]: something that really grips, but also now all of us need that guide in progression.

225
00:28:19,825 --> 00:28:21,446
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to say that.

226
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:27,088
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're freezing and we missed a little bit of what you just said.

227
00:28:32,189 --> 00:28:34,310
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going back to 5G, give me a second.

228
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:41,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me?

229
00:28:42,613 --> 00:28:43,834
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you able to hear me better right now?

230
00:28:43,854 --> 00:28:46,176
[SPEAKER_00]: I just switched over.

231
00:28:46,376 --> 00:28:49,059
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you.

232
00:28:49,319 --> 00:29:05,672
[SPEAKER_00]: No, what I was just saying that I just hope as we get into the round tables and we're gathering the additional feedback that my hope is really that by the end of the school year, we do have,

233
00:29:08,861 --> 00:29:21,808
[SPEAKER_00]: By the end of this school year, we do have a strong plan that we're going to be able to, you know, fully execute for next year, because I

234
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:33,825
[SPEAKER_00]: If we put too many layers, it's gonna extend the process and it's gonna delay the full implementation of the plan.

235
00:29:34,045 --> 00:29:41,748
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just wanted us to be cognizant of how much we aim to accomplish

236
00:29:45,695 --> 00:30:02,579
[SPEAKER_00]: with the with this set of roundtables and knowing that we have to open the schools there is going to be continue to be additional guidance from the commissioner as we get closer to the start of school and knowing that Medford's in a

237
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:14,744
[SPEAKER_00]: very strong position in comparison to many other districts that I think we will continue to do keeping safety, equity, and consistency as our priorities.

238
00:30:15,284 --> 00:30:15,705
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm

239
00:30:17,788 --> 00:30:25,271
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm less worried about us being able to have a strong start next year, because I believe we will.

240
00:30:25,331 --> 00:30:31,874
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of systems and structures in place that will continue for us to have a strong opening.

241
00:30:32,634 --> 00:30:39,117
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm more thinking about the entire strategic plan and being able to execute

242
00:30:39,977 --> 00:30:48,581
[SPEAKER_00]: more of that plan next year, because we're not going to be on the same type of a COVID schedule that we'll be able to get.

243
00:30:48,962 --> 00:30:53,604
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, fingers crossed, but I'm very optimistic.

244
00:30:54,084 --> 00:30:56,525
[SPEAKER_00]: J&J's vaccine has been approved.

245
00:30:56,726 --> 00:31:04,850
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have three vaccines out there, and I believe we're going to get people vaccinated

246
00:31:06,235 --> 00:31:33,911
[SPEAKER_00]: um soon so i'm very optimistic about that and i i i i would just love to have um that strategic plan you know approved um and everyone knowing this is this is our why and this is what we're doing to you know bring the district to the next level yeah and i think um when we met last month we talked about trying to do these in in april um

247
00:31:35,585 --> 00:31:44,851
[SPEAKER_01]: so that really between April and the month of May could be really working that plan so that it could be presented to the school committee in June.

248
00:31:44,931 --> 00:31:52,956
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just, it feels like March is flying by, but it's only the second day of March just in case anybody else is wondering.

249
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:59,200
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I do think it's really reasonable like to do this in early April so that

250
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:15,469
[SPEAKER_01]: They can they can happen, and still give your team and the school committee, enough time, I, I'm based on what we heard from the mayor about sort of the budget planning process it sounds like the budget

251
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:37,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Budget discussions are going to lag a bit while the city waits for direction and guidance, hopefully in a good direction from the Biden administration in particular, but you know, perhaps we can target these and I obviously we have to bring that to the whole committee, but perhaps we can target these for like the week of April 5th so that

252
00:32:39,228 --> 00:33:01,081
[SPEAKER_01]: we can get them, we can get the feedback, we can get ready to kick off like a survey, but you all can progressively be pulling that information to your plan, so to speak, that you already have the bones and the framework of the plan.

253
00:33:01,181 --> 00:33:06,144
[SPEAKER_01]: So I sort of feel like to really round out the strategic plan

254
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:33,480
[SPEAKER_01]: aligning it to that community expectation is A, really important, and B, not substantively changing the how of many of the tasks, maybe adding, maybe changing some, but I wouldn't see that work as a wholesale change to the work you've already done or will continue to do.

255
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,561
[SPEAKER_01]: At least that's sort of my take.

256
00:33:36,642 --> 00:33:37,782
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what you think about that.

257
00:33:39,214 --> 00:33:49,443
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, I follow what you're saying the one piece about the mission vision work as we think about it at the district level.

258
00:33:54,009 --> 00:34:08,395
[SPEAKER_00]: in their handbooks and on their websites, the schools have some of their individual mission, vision statements, because each school kind of has its own personality.

259
00:34:08,975 --> 00:34:21,940
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is something for us to also just keep in mind that the individual schools have their individual personality and that this would be more of the district level.

260
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:47,848
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah yeah so that just so that i don't want schools and school communities and um you know pto's or you know the active parent groups that have said hey you know this is something we've worked on or this is our particular you know at the elementary level this is our mascot this is part of who we are this is part of our identity i don't want them to feel um like

261
00:34:49,604 --> 00:34:53,406
[SPEAKER_00]: we're saying goodbye to, you know, their individuality.

262
00:34:53,446 --> 00:34:58,729
[SPEAKER_00]: So I still want the schools to be able to feel like they have their own personalities.

263
00:34:59,609 --> 00:35:04,592
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but they know that we're all part of one family, you know, the Mustang nation.

264
00:35:05,252 --> 00:35:14,116
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, but I, I definitely encourage the individuality of the schools, but at the same time, um,

265
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:19,947
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up with a mission and vision statement that is inclusive of all.

266
00:35:28,937 --> 00:35:35,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I would say that that is sort of a really natural evolution.

267
00:35:37,122 --> 00:35:39,324
[SPEAKER_01]: as you talk about like strategic planning, right?

268
00:35:39,344 --> 00:35:56,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the overall organization has to like set the plan and then the sub organizations or the schools, the individual schools, you know, have to sort of take and tailor their own individual operations to align to that plan.

269
00:35:56,118 --> 00:36:04,706
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wouldn't think that they would be doing that in this school year anyway, because there's just, there's only so much you can do

270
00:36:05,781 --> 00:36:06,662
[SPEAKER_01]: in one school year.

271
00:36:06,742 --> 00:36:13,587
[SPEAKER_01]: So that seems like a natural, you know, phase two next step iteration of the evolution of the plan.

272
00:36:22,753 --> 00:36:30,839
[SPEAKER_01]: So does trying to target the week of April 6th make sense?

273
00:36:40,668 --> 00:36:41,509
[SPEAKER_00]: April 6th.

274
00:36:44,972 --> 00:36:45,712
[SPEAKER_00]: Just jumping.

275
00:36:45,732 --> 00:37:08,310
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the right, do I have the right dates?

276
00:37:09,278 --> 00:37:13,679
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so Tuesday, April 6th is our next communication subcommittee.

277
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:23,202
[SPEAKER_00]: On Tuesday, April 6th is our next scheduled subcommittee meeting.

278
00:37:25,162 --> 00:37:27,303
[SPEAKER_00]: We have rules subcommittee on the 7th.

279
00:37:34,245 --> 00:37:37,506
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's- We don't have anything on Monday.

280
00:37:38,722 --> 00:37:43,683
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not have a regular school committee meeting scheduled on the 5th.

281
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:48,184
[SPEAKER_00]: For April, it's the 12th and the 26th.

282
00:37:49,425 --> 00:37:50,505
[SPEAKER_00]: We have April vacation.

283
00:37:51,065 --> 00:37:52,465
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the week of the 19th.

284
00:37:53,526 --> 00:37:58,147
[SPEAKER_00]: So Monday the 5th is open right now.

285
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Kathy.

286
00:38:04,561 --> 00:38:04,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

287
00:38:04,841 --> 00:38:05,582
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had a question.

288
00:38:05,682 --> 00:38:21,655
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we were going to have the round table meetings, would we, instead of having the communication stakeholder engagement subcommittee meeting, could that be that meeting time, you know, change for one of the round table meetings?

289
00:38:22,695 --> 00:38:23,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I just had that thought.

290
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:27,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it totally could.

291
00:38:27,499 --> 00:38:30,702
[SPEAKER_01]: If that is doing it like Monday and

292
00:38:31,203 --> 00:38:32,625
[SPEAKER_01]: Tuesday makes sense.

293
00:38:33,005 --> 00:38:33,666
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be fine.

294
00:38:34,126 --> 00:38:52,286
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be happy to change our meeting or even cancel it for the month of april And block off the the fifth and the sixth um And I know you had shown it I I keep trying to scroll your um

295
00:38:55,122 --> 00:38:55,963
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep trying to do it.

296
00:38:56,023 --> 00:38:57,343
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, Oh, why isn't it moving?

297
00:38:58,364 --> 00:39:03,727
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you're, you're envisioning it being 90 minutes, approximately.

298
00:39:04,487 --> 00:39:04,747
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

299
00:39:05,368 --> 00:39:05,688
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 minutes.

300
00:39:06,588 --> 00:39:23,958
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, So did it five, five to six 30, you think the same timeframe for both days?

301
00:39:26,986 --> 00:39:36,813
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if we could do one later in the evening, little bit later in the evening so that folks who have trouble with five o'clock could attend.

302
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:52,485
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have an issue with that, but I know that I generally try not to schedule meetings too late because it's the end of an already long day, but I'm open to that so that we can make sure that the community can participate.

303
00:39:56,135 --> 00:39:56,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Kathy?

304
00:39:57,016 --> 00:40:07,327
[SPEAKER_04]: What about not being too late, but maybe 6 to 7.30, so it's not 7 to 8.30, because then we're getting late.

305
00:40:07,347 --> 00:40:16,917
[SPEAKER_04]: I know 5 to 6.30, that's kind of the late hour, but then people want to eat and everything.

306
00:40:16,937 --> 00:40:17,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

307
00:40:19,092 --> 00:40:25,835
[SPEAKER_04]: So it gets tricky when it starts at seven, because then we're definitely going into the later hour, but I'm not sure.

308
00:40:26,335 --> 00:40:30,818
[SPEAKER_04]: What does everybody else think?

309
00:40:30,938 --> 00:40:46,185
[SPEAKER_00]: I think to do a five to 6.30 and a six to 7.30, because of all of the different breakout rooms, I would need to coordinate the entire team and other administrators to help

310
00:40:46,985 --> 00:40:54,662
[SPEAKER_00]: With the concurrent breakout rooms that are going to be happening so I just want to be able to have time.

311
00:40:57,182 --> 00:41:07,346
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you, in the order that you had it listed, would you be saying which one would be the 5 to 630 and which would be the 6 to 730?

312
00:41:07,786 --> 00:41:10,287
[SPEAKER_01]: I think whatever works for you.

313
00:41:11,107 --> 00:41:11,548
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

314
00:41:11,808 --> 00:41:12,948
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter to me at all.

315
00:41:12,988 --> 00:41:15,669
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, Kathy and Melanie, if you have any.

316
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have anything on those days, so yeah.

317
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:22,132
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I just had the communication one, but it's fine.

318
00:41:22,712 --> 00:41:24,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever one you choose and just let me know.

319
00:41:24,613 --> 00:41:25,473
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

320
00:41:27,328 --> 00:41:51,881
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will definitely work with the other administrators to, you know, use those two timeframes and just see which, you know, in case people have a conflict, just to see which day, you know, if Monday would be like the 6 to 7.30 and Tuesday keep the 5 to 6.30, but I will confirm that and let you know.

321
00:41:54,294 --> 00:41:58,797
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can confirm that when we read out the minutes as well.

322
00:41:59,037 --> 00:42:05,542
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we do that at the meeting on Monday, this, yeah, this coming Monday.

323
00:42:08,104 --> 00:42:08,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

324
00:42:09,845 --> 00:42:19,952
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing we talked about last time was providing a survey so that people who can engage in that, in the,

325
00:42:23,598 --> 00:42:27,901
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, in the breakout sessions have an opportunity to, to weigh in as well.

326
00:42:28,001 --> 00:42:35,967
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did, um, let me just try to put this all on one page so that I did come up with like a rough list of questions.

327
00:42:36,327 --> 00:42:38,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'll start at the bottom.

328
00:42:38,669 --> 00:42:40,390
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the demographic questions.

329
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:48,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I actually took these right from the survey, the surveying that we did, uh, when we solicited input for the superintendent search, because we worked.

330
00:42:50,153 --> 00:43:02,748
[SPEAKER_01]: rather extensively to make sure we were reflecting all the demographic questions and the way in which they were asked was something we spent a lot of time on so I just sort of stole from there and if I recall correctly.

331
00:43:05,403 --> 00:43:12,765
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you use SurveyMonkey, which is I think what we used, it recommends the answers to these questions.

332
00:43:12,805 --> 00:43:28,990
[SPEAKER_01]: So age, gender, how would you describe yourself, which is a question that I can't remember what those sub questions were, but that was sort of a newer one that

333
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:32,229
[SPEAKER_01]: we felt was meaningful.

334
00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:34,970
[SPEAKER_01]: What language do you mainly speak at home?

335
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:41,153
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your highest level of, your highest degree or level of school you've completed?

336
00:43:41,173 --> 00:43:45,996
[SPEAKER_01]: And I forgot to finish the question there, so I'll fix that.

337
00:43:47,937 --> 00:43:50,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Total combined income of your household.

338
00:43:50,218 --> 00:43:54,060
[SPEAKER_01]: How many children of high school age or younger live in your house?

339
00:43:55,641 --> 00:43:58,182
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you or is a member of your household disabled?

340
00:43:58,848 --> 00:44:02,151
[SPEAKER_01]: in which neighborhood do you live and what is your sexual orientation?

341
00:44:02,191 --> 00:44:15,222
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was sort of our, at the time, that was our work to say, we wanna know if we're hearing from a community that represents what our community looks like.

342
00:44:16,444 --> 00:44:25,612
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the demographic questions, but in terms of the actual questions, these would be the actual questions that I came up with.

343
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:34,898
[SPEAKER_01]: One is, does the current mission statement adequately describe the long range work that MPS needs to do on behalf of the city of Medford?

344
00:44:35,438 --> 00:44:38,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Scale of one to 10 with some like free text response.

345
00:44:39,902 --> 00:44:46,527
[SPEAKER_01]: How well does each portion of MPS's current vision statement describe what you feel MPS should achieve in X number of years?

346
00:44:46,587 --> 00:44:52,291
[SPEAKER_01]: So however many number of years the strategic plan is looking to address.

347
00:44:53,231 --> 00:44:54,873
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever those vision statement items are,

348
00:44:56,216 --> 00:45:05,121
[SPEAKER_01]: we would ask for some assessment of each of those vision statement items.

349
00:45:08,783 --> 00:45:13,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Two other questions, if sort of the results of

350
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:28,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the work we do allow us to think that we might make a change, so this is one of those places where if like we the early feedback we get says everyone's really happy with the vision and the mission statements like what we would probably have to change these questions, but assuming that some changes.

351
00:45:31,138 --> 00:45:37,003
[SPEAKER_01]: might be made if as part of a strategic plan we change our mission statement to one of the below please rank in order of preference.

352
00:45:37,884 --> 00:45:48,713
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, whatever sort of the thinking is or the options are that we're asking we would be asking people to weigh in on and then we're considering a revised vision statement that may include the following items, please.

353
00:45:49,193 --> 00:45:51,634
[SPEAKER_01]: rate and order of the importance to you and your and your family.

354
00:45:51,694 --> 00:45:57,936
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, just giving people sort of some pre like some previewing of things that we're thinking about.

355
00:45:59,276 --> 00:46:06,579
[SPEAKER_01]: If in fact, we are going in that direction, obviously, if we're not thinking about making changes, we would change the nature of that question a bit.

356
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:13,881
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I was again, trying to think about like, we still don't, we still can't expect the community to

357
00:46:15,461 --> 00:46:33,969
[SPEAKER_01]: weigh in on the how we will do these things because that's really where the internal work and expertise is required in order to actually make a good plan, but this is, you know, I think could be a good way for us to collect some information from a broader

358
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:35,693
[SPEAKER_01]: group of people.

359
00:46:35,713 --> 00:46:50,004
[SPEAKER_01]: The survey was translated when we did the superintendent search committee as well, but that was trying to keep it short and simple, but also be engaging to the larger community.

360
00:46:50,044 --> 00:46:53,067
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I came up with.

361
00:46:56,049 --> 00:46:56,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Thoughts, questions?

362
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:43,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Jenny, I guess sort of the only questions I would, you know, just sort of in thinking of the question of the survey with some of the questionnaires, I'm wondering how well, and I don't know this, because I'm not another language speaker, but I would want to, you know, I'm wondering how well these questions are translate, like, are they easily translated?

363
00:47:43,281 --> 00:47:45,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, in some languages, there are not

364
00:47:46,827 --> 00:47:51,750
[SPEAKER_02]: the same or some things are not easily translated.

365
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:53,171
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know the answer to that.

366
00:47:57,513 --> 00:48:07,879
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might be worth just sort of, I don't know if maybe Paul might be able to take a look or share with some constituents who might be able to take a look or to just consider that.

367
00:48:07,959 --> 00:48:15,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Because again, I don't know about, I know, Dr. Maurice, are you bilingual in Haitian Creole?

368
00:48:17,042 --> 00:48:28,428
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but for example like phrases that I wouldn't be I wouldn't be using this in when you think about the academic language versus a social language.

369
00:48:30,438 --> 00:48:35,143
[SPEAKER_00]: How well does each portion of the NPS current vision statement describe what you feel?

370
00:48:36,004 --> 00:48:39,167
[SPEAKER_00]: You could ask the same question, but you just have to break it out differently.

371
00:48:39,247 --> 00:48:41,890
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to translate it into chunks.

372
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:50,038
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would not, right now it's showing as four questions, it would have to be broken out to be, I would say more.

373
00:48:51,447 --> 00:48:56,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I guess I'm also talking specifically about the ladder survey questions too.

374
00:48:57,992 --> 00:48:59,273
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's exactly what I mean.

375
00:48:59,313 --> 00:49:07,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I know, you know, just, I don't know, for example, with, and this is just a minor example of my own home, but like with Gracie, we don't often ask open-ended questions, right?

376
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,581
[SPEAKER_02]: We ask multiple choice questions for her.

377
00:49:10,101 --> 00:49:14,625
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all, yeah, they are all multiple choice questions, the demographic questions in particular.

378
00:49:15,145 --> 00:49:18,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay, so you can choose something that's already a pop-up.

379
00:49:18,228 --> 00:49:18,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

380
00:49:18,908 --> 00:49:19,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

381
00:49:19,188 --> 00:49:20,449
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was,

382
00:49:22,474 --> 00:49:26,055
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the result of the superintendent search survey.

383
00:49:26,075 --> 00:49:26,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you see this?

384
00:49:28,316 --> 00:49:33,579
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, each question had a series of responses.

385
00:49:35,859 --> 00:49:44,683
[SPEAKER_01]: The survey monkey itself recommended these allocations, if that makes sense.

386
00:49:44,903 --> 00:49:45,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know it does.

387
00:49:45,723 --> 00:49:46,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember.

388
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:49,305
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, they're all here and I would,

389
00:49:50,968 --> 00:49:53,809
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend that we use them just the way that they are.

390
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:59,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

391
00:50:03,114 --> 00:50:05,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they offer not sures in any of those?

392
00:50:05,556 --> 00:50:07,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I see a right there, but they have that.

393
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:09,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, OK, I'm sure good, OK.

394
00:50:10,618 --> 00:50:11,659
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, thank you.

395
00:50:16,341 --> 00:50:18,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so those would definitely be.

396
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:20,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Broken down.

397
00:50:20,612 --> 00:50:20,972
[SPEAKER_01]: that way.

398
00:50:32,717 --> 00:50:35,879
[SPEAKER_01]: I know thoughts, questions, it's sort of just to start.

399
00:50:35,919 --> 00:50:41,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I think you would definitely want to wait to finalize the questions until the roundtables were done.

400
00:50:43,602 --> 00:50:45,103
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was sort of my,

401
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:51,243
[SPEAKER_01]: my thought in terms of how do we meaningfully engage the community in this discussion.

402
00:51:02,951 --> 00:51:14,158
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess my question would be with the survey piece going out after April vacation, how long were you thinking about having the survey open for?

403
00:51:15,423 --> 00:51:16,564
[SPEAKER_00]: couple weeks tops.

404
00:51:18,225 --> 00:51:23,348
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean certainly it could go out like during April vacation.

405
00:51:23,428 --> 00:51:38,538
[SPEAKER_01]: I just it it was sort of my sense that if we we would need some time between the roundtables and this kickoff of the survey to finalize the survey and then you'd want to send it out.

406
00:51:38,618 --> 00:51:41,160
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could even I mean it could go out during the week of

407
00:51:41,584 --> 00:51:46,111
[SPEAKER_01]: of April vacation or it could go out on your Friday communication before the end of that week.

408
00:51:49,236 --> 00:51:52,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhat flexible, but I wouldn't, you know, I feel like surveys are.

409
00:51:54,426 --> 00:51:59,749
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of diminishing in the number of people, like people respond early, then it wanes.

410
00:51:59,889 --> 00:52:02,891
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the due date, you get the last flurry.

411
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:08,595
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will stretch out sort of as long as you let the survey out there.

412
00:52:08,655 --> 00:52:14,399
[SPEAKER_01]: So being finite about a couple of weeks, I feel like is more than enough time.

413
00:52:17,876 --> 00:52:28,041
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely could remind people in weekly updates and in those kinds of things, keep putting a link to remind them.

414
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:32,242
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sometimes when people know they have time, it goes both ways.

415
00:52:32,302 --> 00:52:35,144
[SPEAKER_00]: They know they have time, so they're like, oh, I've got a month.

416
00:52:35,204 --> 00:52:35,984
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get it done.

417
00:52:37,665 --> 00:52:39,386
[SPEAKER_00]: So just trying to find that balance.

418
00:52:40,446 --> 00:52:40,606
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

419
00:52:42,547 --> 00:52:42,607
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

420
00:52:47,919 --> 00:52:52,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Melanie, Kathy, any other questions, thoughts?

421
00:52:56,491 --> 00:53:01,058
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will share this document, Dr. Edouard-Vincent with you and Susie as well.

422
00:53:08,856 --> 00:53:12,698
[SPEAKER_02]: We are meeting one more time before this, right?

423
00:53:13,879 --> 00:53:14,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Before the.

424
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:18,341
[SPEAKER_01]: The school committee no no engagement.

425
00:53:19,122 --> 00:53:21,623
[SPEAKER_01]: We would not be meeting another time or not.

426
00:53:24,545 --> 00:53:24,705
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

427
00:53:25,646 --> 00:53:26,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're not scheduled to.

428
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:35,111
[SPEAKER_01]: We can, but we're not scheduled to.

429
00:53:36,395 --> 00:53:39,277
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, March is a pretty packed month.

430
00:53:40,518 --> 00:53:46,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not advocating for more meetings, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, believe me, definitely, I hear you.

431
00:53:47,244 --> 00:54:01,876
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we have this, we have two regular scheduled meetings this month as well, where on Monday to be able to give an update and then we have another meeting at the end of the month

432
00:54:04,503 --> 00:54:15,787
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the time that other meeting were to come at the end of the month, if there needed to be a specific update or something, that would at least give us some time.

433
00:54:15,867 --> 00:54:28,491
[SPEAKER_00]: If there was something else that needed to be said, we could have it as new business and you could report out specifically on it as new business at the second meeting at the end of the month.

434
00:54:32,893 --> 00:54:33,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

435
00:54:35,555 --> 00:54:37,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you need a motion to approve?

436
00:54:37,136 --> 00:54:39,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

437
00:54:39,817 --> 00:54:43,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, make a motion to approve these proposed.

438
00:54:47,142 --> 00:54:56,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so motion to approve the proposed roundtable plan and survey by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Kreatz.

439
00:54:56,808 --> 00:54:57,369

[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the end of our agenda.

447

[SPEAKER_02]: And you have 36 minutes left.

448

449
00:55:20,812 --> 00:55:21,432
[SPEAKER_02]: That is great.

450
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:24,633
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big one.

451
00:55:25,033 --> 00:55:26,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Logging all my points.

452
00:55:27,354 --> 00:55:28,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

453
00:55:28,734 --> 00:55:30,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, do we get to carry them over?

454
00:55:30,094 --> 00:55:30,834
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that.

455
00:55:30,855 --> 00:55:31,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on a second.

456
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:35,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, all right, so I make a motion to adjourn.

[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

461
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:47,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Member McLaughlin?

462
00:55:48,382 --> 00:55:48,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

463
00:55:49,803 --> 00:55:51,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Just actually, sorry, excuse me.

464
00:55:51,184 --> 00:55:57,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we do a roll call on, I mean, did we do a vote call on the motion to approve?

465
00:55:57,909 --> 00:55:58,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

466
00:55:58,450 --> 00:55:58,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we did?

467
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

468
00:55:59,531 --> 00:56:00,491
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I must be getting tired.

469
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,752
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, did we fund the roll call?

470
00:56:02,853 --> 00:56:04,655
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, good, thank you.
