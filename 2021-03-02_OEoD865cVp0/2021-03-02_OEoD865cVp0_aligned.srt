00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:13,433
Hello.

2
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:23,255
Hey, Kathy.

3
00:01:26,296 --> 00:01:26,776
Oh, OK.

4
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:27,036
Can I?

5
00:01:46,417 --> 00:01:48,678
Kathy and Melanie, can you unmute now?

6
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:50,219
Yes.

7
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:50,960
OK.

8
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,041
Yes.

9
00:01:52,841 --> 00:01:53,041
Hi.

10
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:53,381
OK.

11
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,064
Peter beat me to it.

12
00:01:58,104 --> 00:02:00,466
Or I don't know if I can unmute, because I was just the co-host.

13
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:08,531
Sorry, I was over trying to get us on YouTube.

14
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:09,612
Just give me one second.

15
00:02:09,992 --> 00:02:10,112
OK.

16
00:02:36,536 --> 00:02:37,657
All right, we should be good to go.

17
00:02:42,904 --> 00:02:43,645
OK.

18
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,473
Give me one second to pull up the agenda.

And our agenda today, our topics today are really to

31
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:18,734
build a plan to collect community input for our strategic plan.

32
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:26,239
So we will identify actions we will take to collect community input regarding the MPS strategic plan.

33
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,900
So I will take attendance.

34
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:31,442
Member Graham is here.

35
00:05:31,702 --> 00:05:32,262
Member Kratz?

36
00:05:32,783 --> 00:05:32,863
Here.

37
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:34,944
And Member McLaughlin?

38
00:05:35,484 --> 00:05:35,684
Here.

39
00:05:36,845 --> 00:05:38,286
All right, three absent.

40
00:05:39,427 --> 00:05:40,967
Sorry, three present, none absent.

41
00:05:43,555 --> 00:05:47,817
So we talked about two things in our last meeting.

42
00:05:47,977 --> 00:05:56,441
One is some round tables specifically geared toward the strategic plan itself.

43
00:05:57,202 --> 00:05:59,523
So separate and apart from the listening sessions that are happening.

44
00:05:59,963 --> 00:06:07,667
And then we also talked about a survey for those who can't participate in the Zoom session.

45
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:10,088
So I actually did take

46
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:16,500
a crack at a draft of all of this and I'm gonna share my screen.

47
00:06:24,525 --> 00:06:26,286
Can you see my screen?

48
00:06:26,306 --> 00:06:29,808
Oh, not yet.

49
00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:31,829
How about now?

50
00:06:38,592 --> 00:06:39,133
Okay.

51
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:40,503
Perfect.

52
00:06:42,044 --> 00:06:43,125
Okay.

53
00:06:43,145 --> 00:06:59,938
So, you know, what I did was just try to do some thinking around like what, you know, when we talk about a strategic plan and the kind of input we want from the community, how do we collect that input in a meaningful way?

54
00:06:59,998 --> 00:07:08,525
And I think one of the keys when you embark on strategic planning is that you sort of separate the like,

55
00:07:09,489 --> 00:07:21,427
The aspirational goal, or the what from the how, and I think when we, you know what I tried to do was say that, you know, we want to know about the what from the community so what.

56
00:07:23,505 --> 00:07:25,966
are we trying to accomplish with this strategic plan?

57
00:07:27,086 --> 00:07:35,690
The how is uniquely something that the people sort of in the inner workings of the organization have to ultimately come up with to align to that what.

58
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:47,394
So I first did some digging and said, okay, when we talk about a strategic plan, it should always be anchored to our mission and our vision.

59
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:53,297
And I went out on the website and there were two different mission statements on the website.

60
00:07:55,498 --> 00:08:05,445
One sort of really short for MPS and then something longer for Medford High.

61
00:08:07,526 --> 00:08:13,449
And there was no like stated vision statement on the web.

62
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:26,055
So I just say that to say that maybe those things exist and I just didn't put my hands on them on the website, but I'm just sharing with you what I did find.

63
00:08:28,516 --> 00:08:31,378
Because I think it's important as we talk about sort of a precursor to the,

64
00:08:33,091 --> 00:08:36,955
sessions that I was thinking about in terms of collecting community input.

65
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:49,268
And I think, and there's one more bullet at the bottom of that, become contributing citizens in a global society.

66
00:08:49,288 --> 00:08:53,533
So, I think one question that I have is,

67
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:11,298
When we talk about our vision, our mission, and our vision with Medford Public School, for Medford Public Schools in general, are these the right, like, what is the stated mission and vision of the district?

68
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:22,905
I didn't, you know, I didn't, wasn't able to put my hands on it as I was planning, so I just tried to sort of navigate around that a little bit, but that's an obvious question that we'll have to answer before we

69
00:09:25,668 --> 00:09:26,649
go into the details.

70
00:09:27,729 --> 00:09:51,764
So when I thought about the round table structure, what I tried to do was say, you know, what questions could we be asking the community to weigh in on that would allow us to sort of, us, you know, certainly the administration, but also the school committee as the policy makers and setters,

71
00:09:53,770 --> 00:10:10,915
to sort of understand what the community expects from this endeavor so that when we lay out our set of steps, when we aggregate the things that we're doing, we can be guided by that overall expectation from our mission and our vision statement.

72
00:10:11,535 --> 00:10:15,836
And often when I work with clients on strategic plans,

73
00:10:16,602 --> 00:10:31,808
the first thing that becomes clear is the vision and the mission are stale or dated or need some revision to sort of be relevant to what is going on in the current planning efforts.

74
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:40,251
So really the three questions that I thought we would ask during our round tables

75
00:10:41,377 --> 00:10:49,926
right here, and we can talk about sort of the structure of the roundtables separately, but to me, I have three questions.

76
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:55,552
So does Medford Public Schools' current mission statement accurately describe

77
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:02,674
the long range goals you feel MPS should aspire to, why or not, why not, and what changes or suggestions do you have?

78
00:11:02,694 --> 00:11:04,355
So that's question number one.

79
00:11:05,395 --> 00:11:14,260
Question number two, does MPS's current vision statement adequately describe what you feel MPS should achieve in the next X number of years?

80
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,462
And I said X because,

81
00:11:17,997 --> 00:11:30,788
a strategic plan usually does lay out a path to a date in the future that says like, this is where we're going and this is when we will arrive at this new place in terms of the vision.

82
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:36,052
And why or why not and what input changes or suggestions do you have?

83
00:11:36,672 --> 00:11:44,879
And then third question, what key actions does MPS need to take to demonstrate forward progress toward our vision in

84
00:11:47,692 --> 00:11:56,958
x, you know, in whatever year it is that the strategic plan is intended to take us to and in what timeframe would those steps have to be taken.

85
00:11:57,058 --> 00:12:14,688
So in trying to think about how to ask questions that can be meaningful input for all of us and also be questions that truly the public is positioned to weigh in on, that was sort of what I came up with as a starting point

86
00:12:15,315 --> 00:12:17,396
But I was hoping we could talk about that today.

87
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:29,440
Overall, my thought was an hour and a half roundtable would give us some time to bring people in, do some introduction, set the groundwork of what

88
00:12:30,853 --> 00:12:32,854
You know, we are doing the strategic planning effort.

89
00:12:33,014 --> 00:12:35,156
Here is our current vision and mission.

90
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:41,540
Or if there was something sort of new that we wanted to ask people to react to, we could do that as well.

91
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,483
Break people out for about an hour, bring everybody back for a recap.

92
00:12:47,484 --> 00:12:50,406
So try to keep it pretty simple in structure.

93
00:12:50,426 --> 00:12:56,550
I know we now have breakout room capabilities we didn't have last year, which hopefully will be really, really helpful as well.

94
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:24,247
And then in terms of like the organization of the breakout rooms, sort of my thought was that we would break it somewhat by level, but also understand that there are special populations out there that may have their own sort of community around what they're wanting to see or aspire to.

95
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:35,832
You know, there may be a group of folks from a special education perspective or an English learner perspective and groups that can be supported by a translator.

96
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:40,134
But fundamentally, I'll be asking these same three questions.

97
00:13:41,915 --> 00:13:49,138
So I'll stop there and ask for thoughts, questions, comments, changes, feedback.

98
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,564
I'm the I was going to just jump in.

99
00:13:57,584 --> 00:14:09,355
I was going to ask, is it possible for you to just make it a little larger I Maybe like 150 yeah let me next to the under the word insert

100
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:12,959
Oh, geez.

101
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:16,700
Is that better?

102
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,581
That just makes it a little easier to see.

103
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:38,164
So this is the proposed structure that you want for the round tables to have, and then to have the specialized breakout groups by EL with translation, special education, elementary, middle, and high.

104
00:14:38,705 --> 00:14:46,974
Yeah, and those were sort of the groups that jumped out at me and I know back in the spring, we had questions around like,

105
00:14:48,948 --> 00:14:58,356
We had topical breakouts, but we also had people who had really different perspectives and experiences because of the levels their kids were at, et cetera.

106
00:14:58,457 --> 00:15:03,241
So I actually went back and looked at how we did those.

107
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:05,803
And there were sort of two factors that

108
00:15:09,623 --> 00:15:10,684
would identify people.

109
00:15:10,824 --> 00:15:17,690
One was like this like leveling where you sort of sit in the world question.

110
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,052
And then the other was like the topical question.

111
00:15:20,092 --> 00:15:26,016
Like when we were doing it last time, we were talking about athletics and extracurriculars and curriculum and instruction.

112
00:15:26,056 --> 00:15:30,060
And like, so people were in lots of different categories for that reason.

113
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,243
So I think this time we don't have two dimensions there.

114
00:15:34,383 --> 00:15:38,286
So that makes life a little bit easier because the same three questions

115
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:44,191
apply when you talk about the vision and the mission and like action steps.

116
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,334
no matter what your subgroup is.

117
00:15:49,834 --> 00:15:58,320
So I think that makes it a little bit less complicated and Zoom has gotten markedly better about how you identify people.

118
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,162
So that is always helpful as well.

119
00:16:02,343 --> 00:16:04,464
So that was my thought.

120
00:16:04,684 --> 00:16:13,530
I'm not tied to that at all, but that was as I was thinking about trying to put together a straw man for us to react to sort of where my head went to.

121
00:16:16,465 --> 00:16:36,998
My wondering or my question regarding question number one about the long range goals, like, you know, redoing the vision statement or updating it or having a collaborative process for mission, vision statement.

122
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,583
I think that, you know, that's a great process to definitely go through with the community.

123
00:16:44,845 --> 00:17:05,470
In terms of the long range goals, I guess my wondering is, are we talking from what's happening instructionally and academically and programming that I don't know if you were thinking about those goals as well because that's a different

124
00:17:06,364 --> 00:17:15,029
arena, where I could end up with 15 people saying I like this program that program and the superintendent.

125
00:17:15,649 --> 00:17:24,735
That's part of like the instructional piece of how instruction is is delivered in the classroom would fall.

126
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:38,143
underneath my umbrella in terms of what's happening specifically in the classrooms or how the instruction is being delivered and working with administration and those pieces.

127
00:17:38,944 --> 00:17:49,812
But like long-range goals, I just was trying to understand, is it physical plant long-range goals, offering additional language

128
00:17:50,665 --> 00:18:03,432
things, different coursework, because it was kind of open ended and broad, I just wasn't sure what you were thinking in that first question there.

129
00:18:03,972 --> 00:18:07,774
Yeah, and I think that's actually a really good question.

130
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:08,094
I mean,

131
00:18:10,124 --> 00:18:16,790
when you talk about a mission, I always think about that as like, the reason we get out of bed in the morning, that's the mission, right?

132
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:30,163
So the mission is something that sort of stands, ideally stands the test of time to some degree, although language, you know, always is worth looking at.

133
00:18:31,204 --> 00:18:34,086
But the vision, to me, the vision is where you say like,

134
00:18:35,143 --> 00:18:52,001
This is, this is what it's going to look like at the end of this strategic plan, and, and I went back and looked at a couple of strategic plans that I had poked in on last year when we were going through it and I think, you know, Lexington's certainly does a really nice job of like.

135
00:18:53,002 --> 00:18:56,544
wrapping you in a warm hug when you read it.

136
00:18:56,944 --> 00:19:18,435
Like the mission is compelling, the vision just sort of jumps off the page at you, but the distinguishing characteristics, they actually sort of define in their strategic plan, which I think is important because many people think of those two things as exactly the same, like mission and vision are the same, or they talk about them in the same breath.

137
00:19:19,095 --> 00:19:24,918
I think when you talk about them differently, you can get sort of different things out of them.

138
00:19:25,118 --> 00:19:39,026
But to your point, we can and should expect that the community will come to us with the things on their mind, and they will put them in whatever bucket it goes in.

139
00:19:39,326 --> 00:19:46,070
That doesn't mean just because somebody wants our mission to be having a winning football team that that becomes the mission.

140
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:56,891
trying to ask the question sort of in, what I envisioned is we would talk about these three things as a grounding statement at the beginning.

141
00:19:57,412 --> 00:20:03,978
And then we would let the community tell us what they think about the answers to these questions.

142
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:14,467
We would capture the feedback and that would become input for not just the school committee, but also the administration as we talk about like, how do we unveil

143
00:20:15,634 --> 00:20:16,174
our plan.

144
00:20:16,234 --> 00:20:21,777
And so we don't know, will the entire community be like, yeah, our mission statement is fine.

145
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:23,658
Like maybe I'm the only one that doesn't like it.

146
00:20:23,718 --> 00:20:25,579
Maybe Melanie is the only one that doesn't like it.

147
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:33,624
But we, I think we need to ask to really sort of know, is it

148
00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:36,290
Is it the words?

149
00:20:37,131 --> 00:20:39,954
People like the words, people don't like the words.

150
00:20:40,074 --> 00:20:41,917
Is it the intent of the words?

151
00:20:41,977 --> 00:20:43,018
Is it something else entirely?

152
00:20:43,098 --> 00:20:49,566
So I do think we will get a lot of varied input in these sessions.

153
00:20:50,367 --> 00:20:53,932
And I think sort of classifying and categorizing them.

154
00:20:54,555 --> 00:21:02,258
what somebody says is a mission statement response may actually be an action step.

155
00:21:03,518 --> 00:21:10,120
But I think either way, collecting the feedback from the community is important and valuable.

156
00:21:12,461 --> 00:21:18,563
And then the other thing we'll talk about in a little bit is a survey that we can follow up with.

157
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:22,764
But that was sort of how I was thinking about it.

158
00:21:22,784 --> 00:21:24,385
Does that make sense?

159
00:21:26,357 --> 00:21:27,701
Okay, Melanie.

160
00:21:31,868 --> 00:21:32,488
Yeah, thank you.

161
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:34,770
I am curious.

162
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:53,326
I think that for the, it would be really helpful for these breakouts to be able to see the data from the last session that we had and where people shared their ideas and thoughts with us about what they wanted done and what they, you know, thought we needed to work on from last time.

163
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:59,691
And I know that this is sort of a different ask in terms of like focusing really on the mission and vision so that

164
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:19,798
we're backing into these questions and that it's not sort of this abstract, but I'd love to see, you know, a summary of sort of, I feel like, you know, we spent a good amount of time at these round tables last year really talking and I thought did our group, you know, had some great suggestions and we did a lot of that work shopping.

165
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:23,279
And it would be great to have sort of a summary of that.

166
00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:35,265
you know, either as part of this presentation before we start or something to ground us for where we are and what people have already said they wanted so that we're not feeling like we're starting from scratch.

167
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:50,849
The only thing to think about from my perspective is that that set of roundtables was so squarely talking about back to school in COVID.

168
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:58,892
it will be a challenge to not talk about COVID here.

169
00:22:58,912 --> 00:23:02,013
Sorry, just for a point of information, not that one.

170
00:23:02,073 --> 00:23:05,074
I'm thinking, what was the one that we had at the library pre-COVID?

171
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:06,415
Not Zoom.

172
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:10,036
Remember the mayor's transition planning session?

173
00:23:10,577 --> 00:23:12,077
No, it was specific to school.

174
00:23:12,097 --> 00:23:13,158
Yeah.

175
00:23:13,638 --> 00:23:14,138
Was that it?

176
00:23:14,218 --> 00:23:15,318
The mayor's transition planning?

177
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:17,099
Yeah, but it was very specific to school.

178
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:17,459
Yeah.

179
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:17,719
Yes.

180
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:18,820
That one.

181
00:23:20,478 --> 00:23:21,998
Yeah and that's been summarized.

182
00:23:22,418 --> 00:23:25,859
I'm sure the mayor can resurface that as input.

183
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,140
I think it would be really helpful just to have that as a ground and you're right.

184
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:47,923
I think the one you know in between those was certainly very specific to the back to school and COVID and you know yeah I think you're right about sort of having us you know be specific so that we're not being derailed on a lot of the you know back to school questions and concerns because those are going to be a big part understandably.

185
00:23:48,923 --> 00:23:50,804
But I think we need some grounding too.

186
00:23:51,204 --> 00:24:00,369
And also I think it's really helpful and I'm happy to reach out if people want me to whatever to the mayor for that info and also even for the others, the second round table.

187
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:08,934
I think it's just really helpful for people to see that we value the work they've already put in and that we've heard them and we have really summary of that information.

188
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:15,938
So we haven't forgotten about that because I feel like if I was a constituent and I was being asked to come to this again, I'd be like,

189
00:24:16,478 --> 00:24:40,715
you know haven't we done this like a couple times already like we you know and and although this is different um and it's you know post a year's long pandemic um i want to see that we that that we we've been heard and that you know the constituents feel like they've been heard so i'm happy to reach out to jackie or the mayor for that um round table for the mayor's uh specific to education if you guys want so we could see those

190
00:24:41,235 --> 00:24:45,819
And then, you know, maybe there could be a summary sheet for the back to school as well.

191
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:59,969
Because I think there will be some crossover, because I think there are some themes that are universal outside of the back to school piece, which, you know, again, just sort of whether we're meeting, you know, equity, for example, right?

192
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:02,651
That's universal across all three of those pieces.

193
00:25:02,912 --> 00:25:03,152
So.

194
00:25:03,172 --> 00:25:03,632
Yep.

195
00:25:06,694 --> 00:25:07,335
Okay.

196
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:27,134
And, you know, perhaps there's a way to weave in even the round tables that we did last year around back to school, as we would announce these round tables to say, you know, among the great feedback and suggestions we got in those round tables were these things.

197
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:33,059
And, you know, we use them as we built our back to school plan and our task force and all that stuff.

198
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:35,961
So there's an opportunity to sort of connect back to like,

199
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:39,682
the value of the input of the community there as well.

200
00:25:40,948 --> 00:25:41,249
Kathy?

201
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:45,781
Thank you.

202
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:49,043
Thank you for providing us with this nice plan.

203
00:25:49,063 --> 00:25:51,325
Yeah, I think this is, it looks good.

204
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:52,246
The questions look good.

205
00:25:52,686 --> 00:25:55,149
So, and I do appreciate Ms.

206
00:25:55,189 --> 00:25:56,690
McLaughlin reaching out to the mayor.

207
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,652
I think that would be helpful information.

208
00:25:58,692 --> 00:26:07,199
I did attend that meeting at the library and we were split up into groups and we did talk a little bit about, you know, strategic plan education.

209
00:26:07,219 --> 00:26:10,722
There was like a little bit of a mix so that I do remember that meeting.

210
00:26:11,242 --> 00:26:12,764
And so when we,

211
00:26:13,444 --> 00:26:19,412
When we begin the process to invite people to this the roundtable meetings.

212
00:26:20,574 --> 00:26:28,584
Will there be like a little, like a little background like with the current mission statement, what it is currently, you know what's the current vision statement.

213
00:26:29,325 --> 00:26:43,496
you know, and maybe a little background with the meeting that was at the library, just a brief, you know, summary so that when it's shared, people know, you know, well, this is what this meeting is about.

214
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:45,858
Oh, we're going to be reviewing the mission statement.

215
00:26:46,118 --> 00:26:54,825
So maybe they can come to the meeting ready with, you know, ideas and questions, you know, or suggestions or feedback.

216
00:26:55,605 --> 00:26:56,206
Just wondering.

217
00:26:56,226 --> 00:26:58,828
Yeah, I think that's a great idea.

218
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,781
Thanks.

219
00:27:05,141 --> 00:27:19,149
I was gonna say, my only ask would be where one of the things that is going to be critically important, and I know we're on a tight timetable, is to really

220
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:33,356
try to get the strategic plan to a place where we are able to be using that to guide all the work that we're doing moving forward.

221
00:27:34,056 --> 00:27:37,277
And I'm only restating that because

222
00:27:40,853 --> 00:27:48,259
That's kind of how we know everything is aligned and we're kind of moving in the same direction and getting that traction.

223
00:27:48,899 --> 00:28:02,170
So the mission and the vision work, it's important to get that buy-in, to have everyone strongly be able to be committed to something that the community feels is a compelling statement.

224
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:18,645
something that really grips, but also now all of us need that guide in progression.

225
00:28:19,825 --> 00:28:21,446
I just wanted to say that.

226
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:27,088
I think you're freezing and we missed a little bit of what you just said.

227
00:28:32,189 --> 00:28:34,310
I'm going back to 5G, give me a second.

228
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:41,913
Can you hear me?

229
00:28:42,613 --> 00:28:43,834
Are you able to hear me better right now?

230
00:28:43,854 --> 00:28:46,176
I just switched over.

231
00:28:46,376 --> 00:28:49,059
Okay, thank you.

232
00:28:49,319 --> 00:29:05,672
No, what I was just saying that I just hope as we get into the round tables and we're gathering the additional feedback that my hope is really that by the end of the school year, we do have,

233
00:29:08,861 --> 00:29:21,808
By the end of this school year, we do have a strong plan that we're going to be able to, you know, fully execute for next year, because I

234
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:33,825
If we put too many layers, it's gonna extend the process and it's gonna delay the full implementation of the plan.

235
00:29:34,045 --> 00:29:41,748
And so I just wanted us to be cognizant of how much we aim to accomplish

236
00:29:45,695 --> 00:30:02,579
with the with this set of roundtables and knowing that we have to open the schools there is going to be continue to be additional guidance from the commissioner as we get closer to the start of school and knowing that Medford's in a

237
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:14,744
very strong position in comparison to many other districts that I think we will continue to do keeping safety, equity, and consistency as our priorities.

238
00:30:15,284 --> 00:30:15,705
So I'm

239
00:30:17,788 --> 00:30:25,271
I'm less worried about us being able to have a strong start next year, because I believe we will.

240
00:30:25,331 --> 00:30:31,874
We have a lot of systems and structures in place that will continue for us to have a strong opening.

241
00:30:32,634 --> 00:30:39,117
And I'm more thinking about the entire strategic plan and being able to execute

242
00:30:39,977 --> 00:30:48,581
more of that plan next year, because we're not going to be on the same type of a COVID schedule that we'll be able to get.

243
00:30:48,962 --> 00:30:53,604
Yes, fingers crossed, but I'm very optimistic.

244
00:30:54,084 --> 00:30:56,525
J&J's vaccine has been approved.

245
00:30:56,726 --> 00:31:04,850
And so we have three vaccines out there, and I believe we're going to get people vaccinated

246
00:31:06,235 --> 00:31:33,911
um soon so i'm very optimistic about that and i i i i would just love to have um that strategic plan you know approved um and everyone knowing this is this is our why and this is what we're doing to you know bring the district to the next level yeah and i think um when we met last month we talked about trying to do these in in april um

247
00:31:35,585 --> 00:31:44,851
so that really between April and the month of May could be really working that plan so that it could be presented to the school committee in June.

248
00:31:44,931 --> 00:31:52,956
So I was just, it feels like March is flying by, but it's only the second day of March just in case anybody else is wondering.

249
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:59,200
So, I mean, I do think it's really reasonable like to do this in early April so that

250
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:15,469
They can they can happen, and still give your team and the school committee, enough time, I, I'm based on what we heard from the mayor about sort of the budget planning process it sounds like the budget

251
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:37,893
Budget discussions are going to lag a bit while the city waits for direction and guidance, hopefully in a good direction from the Biden administration in particular, but you know, perhaps we can target these and I obviously we have to bring that to the whole committee, but perhaps we can target these for like the week of April 5th so that

252
00:32:39,228 --> 00:33:01,081
we can get them, we can get the feedback, we can get ready to kick off like a survey, but you all can progressively be pulling that information to your plan, so to speak, that you already have the bones and the framework of the plan.

253
00:33:01,181 --> 00:33:06,144
So I sort of feel like to really round out the strategic plan

254
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:33,480
aligning it to that community expectation is A, really important, and B, not substantively changing the how of many of the tasks, maybe adding, maybe changing some, but I wouldn't see that work as a wholesale change to the work you've already done or will continue to do.

255
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,561
At least that's sort of my take.

256
00:33:36,642 --> 00:33:37,782
I don't know what you think about that.

257
00:33:39,214 --> 00:33:49,443
I, I, I follow what you're saying the one piece about the mission vision work as we think about it at the district level.

258
00:33:54,009 --> 00:34:08,395
in their handbooks and on their websites, the schools have some of their individual mission, vision statements, because each school kind of has its own personality.

259
00:34:08,975 --> 00:34:21,940
And so that is something for us to also just keep in mind that the individual schools have their individual personality and that this would be more of the district level.

260
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:47,848
yeah yeah so that just so that i don't want schools and school communities and um you know pto's or you know the active parent groups that have said hey you know this is something we've worked on or this is our particular you know at the elementary level this is our mascot this is part of who we are this is part of our identity i don't want them to feel um like

261
00:34:49,604 --> 00:34:53,406
we're saying goodbye to, you know, their individuality.

262
00:34:53,446 --> 00:34:58,729
So I still want the schools to be able to feel like they have their own personalities.

263
00:34:59,609 --> 00:35:04,592
Um, but they know that we're all part of one family, you know, the Mustang nation.

264
00:35:05,252 --> 00:35:14,116
And so, um, but I, I definitely encourage the individuality of the schools, but at the same time, um,

265
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:19,947
coming up with a mission and vision statement that is inclusive of all.

266
00:35:28,937 --> 00:35:35,845
Yeah, and I would say that that is sort of a really natural evolution.

267
00:35:37,122 --> 00:35:39,324
as you talk about like strategic planning, right?

268
00:35:39,344 --> 00:35:56,038
Like the overall organization has to like set the plan and then the sub organizations or the schools, the individual schools, you know, have to sort of take and tailor their own individual operations to align to that plan.

269
00:35:56,118 --> 00:36:04,706
So I wouldn't think that they would be doing that in this school year anyway, because there's just, there's only so much you can do

270
00:36:05,781 --> 00:36:06,662
in one school year.

271
00:36:06,742 --> 00:36:13,587
So that seems like a natural, you know, phase two next step iteration of the evolution of the plan.

272
00:36:22,753 --> 00:36:30,839
So does trying to target the week of April 6th make sense?

273
00:36:40,668 --> 00:36:41,509
April 6th.

274
00:36:44,972 --> 00:36:45,712
Just jumping.

275
00:36:45,732 --> 00:37:08,310
Is that the right, do I have the right dates?

276
00:37:09,278 --> 00:37:13,679
Yeah, so Tuesday, April 6th is our next communication subcommittee.

277
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:23,202
On Tuesday, April 6th is our next scheduled subcommittee meeting.

278
00:37:25,162 --> 00:37:27,303
We have rules subcommittee on the 7th.

279
00:37:34,245 --> 00:37:37,506
So that's- We don't have anything on Monday.

280
00:37:38,722 --> 00:37:43,683
We do not have a regular school committee meeting scheduled on the 5th.

281
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:48,184
For April, it's the 12th and the 26th.

282
00:37:49,425 --> 00:37:50,505
We have April vacation.

283
00:37:51,065 --> 00:37:52,465
That's the week of the 19th.

284
00:37:53,526 --> 00:37:58,147
So Monday the 5th is open right now.

285
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,060
Hey, Kathy.

286
00:38:04,561 --> 00:38:04,741
Yes.

287
00:38:04,841 --> 00:38:05,582
I just had a question.

288
00:38:05,682 --> 00:38:21,655
So if we were going to have the round table meetings, would we, instead of having the communication stakeholder engagement subcommittee meeting, could that be that meeting time, you know, change for one of the round table meetings?

289
00:38:22,695 --> 00:38:23,856
I just, I just had that thought.

290
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:27,459
Yeah, I think it totally could.

291
00:38:27,499 --> 00:38:30,702
If that is doing it like Monday and

292
00:38:31,203 --> 00:38:32,625
Tuesday makes sense.

293
00:38:33,005 --> 00:38:33,666
That would be fine.

294
00:38:34,126 --> 00:38:52,286
I'd be happy to change our meeting or even cancel it for the month of april And block off the the fifth and the sixth um And I know you had shown it I I keep trying to scroll your um

295
00:38:55,122 --> 00:38:55,963
I keep trying to do it.

296
00:38:56,023 --> 00:38:57,343
I'm like, Oh, why isn't it moving?

297
00:38:58,364 --> 00:39:03,727
Um, so you're, you're envisioning it being 90 minutes, approximately.

298
00:39:04,487 --> 00:39:04,747
Yeah.

299
00:39:05,368 --> 00:39:05,688
90 minutes.

300
00:39:06,588 --> 00:39:23,958
Um, So did it five, five to six 30, you think the same timeframe for both days?

301
00:39:26,986 --> 00:39:36,813
I wonder if we could do one later in the evening, little bit later in the evening so that folks who have trouble with five o'clock could attend.

302
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:52,485
I don't have an issue with that, but I know that I generally try not to schedule meetings too late because it's the end of an already long day, but I'm open to that so that we can make sure that the community can participate.

303
00:39:56,135 --> 00:39:56,455
Kathy?

304
00:39:57,016 --> 00:40:07,327
What about not being too late, but maybe 6 to 7.30, so it's not 7 to 8.30, because then we're getting late.

305
00:40:07,347 --> 00:40:16,917
I know 5 to 6.30, that's kind of the late hour, but then people want to eat and everything.

306
00:40:16,937 --> 00:40:17,478
Yeah.

307
00:40:19,092 --> 00:40:25,835
So it gets tricky when it starts at seven, because then we're definitely going into the later hour, but I'm not sure.

308
00:40:26,335 --> 00:40:30,818
What does everybody else think?

309
00:40:30,938 --> 00:40:46,185
I think to do a five to 6.30 and a six to 7.30, because of all of the different breakout rooms, I would need to coordinate the entire team and other administrators to help

310
00:40:46,985 --> 00:40:54,662
With the concurrent breakout rooms that are going to be happening so I just want to be able to have time.

311
00:40:57,182 --> 00:41:07,346
Would you, in the order that you had it listed, would you be saying which one would be the 5 to 630 and which would be the 6 to 730?

312
00:41:07,786 --> 00:41:10,287
I think whatever works for you.

313
00:41:11,107 --> 00:41:11,548
OK.

314
00:41:11,808 --> 00:41:12,948
It doesn't matter to me at all.

315
00:41:12,988 --> 00:41:15,669
I don't know, Kathy and Melanie, if you have any.

316
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,910
I don't have anything on those days, so yeah.

317
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:22,132
I mean, I just had the communication one, but it's fine.

318
00:41:22,712 --> 00:41:24,593
Whatever one you choose and just let me know.

319
00:41:24,613 --> 00:41:25,473
Yeah.

320
00:41:27,328 --> 00:41:51,881
So I will definitely work with the other administrators to, you know, use those two timeframes and just see which, you know, in case people have a conflict, just to see which day, you know, if Monday would be like the 6 to 7.30 and Tuesday keep the 5 to 6.30, but I will confirm that and let you know.

321
00:41:54,294 --> 00:41:58,797
And we can confirm that when we read out the minutes as well.

322
00:41:59,037 --> 00:42:05,542
So when we do that at the meeting on Monday, this, yeah, this coming Monday.

323
00:42:08,104 --> 00:42:08,444
Okay.

324
00:42:09,845 --> 00:42:19,952
And then the other thing we talked about last time was providing a survey so that people who can engage in that, in the,

325
00:42:23,598 --> 00:42:27,901
uh, in the breakout sessions have an opportunity to, to weigh in as well.

326
00:42:28,001 --> 00:42:35,967
So I did, um, let me just try to put this all on one page so that I did come up with like a rough list of questions.

327
00:42:36,327 --> 00:42:38,348
Um, I'll start at the bottom.

328
00:42:38,669 --> 00:42:40,390
These are the demographic questions.

329
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:48,996
Um, I actually took these right from the survey, the surveying that we did, uh, when we solicited input for the superintendent search, because we worked.

330
00:42:50,153 --> 00:43:02,748
rather extensively to make sure we were reflecting all the demographic questions and the way in which they were asked was something we spent a lot of time on so I just sort of stole from there and if I recall correctly.

331
00:43:05,403 --> 00:43:12,765
So if you use SurveyMonkey, which is I think what we used, it recommends the answers to these questions.

332
00:43:12,805 --> 00:43:28,990
So age, gender, how would you describe yourself, which is a question that I can't remember what those sub questions were, but that was sort of a newer one that

333
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:32,229
we felt was meaningful.

334
00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:34,970
What language do you mainly speak at home?

335
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:41,153
What's your highest level of, your highest degree or level of school you've completed?

336
00:43:41,173 --> 00:43:45,996
And I forgot to finish the question there, so I'll fix that.

337
00:43:47,937 --> 00:43:50,038
Total combined income of your household.

338
00:43:50,218 --> 00:43:54,060
How many children of high school age or younger live in your house?

339
00:43:55,641 --> 00:43:58,182
Are you or is a member of your household disabled?

340
00:43:58,848 --> 00:44:02,151
in which neighborhood do you live and what is your sexual orientation?

341
00:44:02,191 --> 00:44:15,222
So that was sort of our, at the time, that was our work to say, we wanna know if we're hearing from a community that represents what our community looks like.

342
00:44:16,444 --> 00:44:25,612
So those are the demographic questions, but in terms of the actual questions, these would be the actual questions that I came up with.

343
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:34,898
One is, does the current mission statement adequately describe the long range work that MPS needs to do on behalf of the city of Medford?

344
00:44:35,438 --> 00:44:38,621
Scale of one to 10 with some like free text response.

345
00:44:39,902 --> 00:44:46,527
How well does each portion of MPS's current vision statement describe what you feel MPS should achieve in X number of years?

346
00:44:46,587 --> 00:44:52,291
So however many number of years the strategic plan is looking to address.

347
00:44:53,231 --> 00:44:54,873
Whatever those vision statement items are,

348
00:44:56,216 --> 00:45:05,121
we would ask for some assessment of each of those vision statement items.

349
00:45:08,783 --> 00:45:13,026
Two other questions, if sort of the results of

350
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:28,874
Some of the work we do allow us to think that we might make a change, so this is one of those places where if like we the early feedback we get says everyone's really happy with the vision and the mission statements like what we would probably have to change these questions, but assuming that some changes.

351
00:45:31,138 --> 00:45:37,003
might be made if as part of a strategic plan we change our mission statement to one of the below please rank in order of preference.

352
00:45:37,884 --> 00:45:48,713
And you know, whatever sort of the thinking is or the options are that we're asking we would be asking people to weigh in on and then we're considering a revised vision statement that may include the following items, please.

353
00:45:49,193 --> 00:45:51,634
rate and order of the importance to you and your and your family.

354
00:45:51,694 --> 00:45:57,936
So again, just giving people sort of some pre like some previewing of things that we're thinking about.

355
00:45:59,276 --> 00:46:06,579
If in fact, we are going in that direction, obviously, if we're not thinking about making changes, we would change the nature of that question a bit.

356
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:13,881
But when I was again, trying to think about like, we still don't, we still can't expect the community to

357
00:46:15,461 --> 00:46:33,969
weigh in on the how we will do these things because that's really where the internal work and expertise is required in order to actually make a good plan, but this is, you know, I think could be a good way for us to collect some information from a broader

358
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:35,693
group of people.

359
00:46:35,713 --> 00:46:50,004
The survey was translated when we did the superintendent search committee as well, but that was trying to keep it short and simple, but also be engaging to the larger community.

360
00:46:50,044 --> 00:46:53,067
So that's what I came up with.

361
00:46:56,049 --> 00:46:56,970
Thoughts, questions?

362
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:43,241
Jenny, I guess sort of the only questions I would, you know, just sort of in thinking of the question of the survey with some of the questionnaires, I'm wondering how well, and I don't know this, because I'm not another language speaker, but I would want to, you know, I'm wondering how well these questions are translate, like, are they easily translated?

363
00:47:43,281 --> 00:47:45,242
Because, you know, in some languages, there are not

364
00:47:46,827 --> 00:47:51,750
the same or some things are not easily translated.

365
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:53,171
And I don't know the answer to that.

366
00:47:57,513 --> 00:48:07,879
So it might be worth just sort of, I don't know if maybe Paul might be able to take a look or share with some constituents who might be able to take a look or to just consider that.

367
00:48:07,959 --> 00:48:15,343
Because again, I don't know about, I know, Dr. Maurice, are you bilingual in Haitian Creole?

368
00:48:17,042 --> 00:48:28,428
Yes, but for example like phrases that I wouldn't be I wouldn't be using this in when you think about the academic language versus a social language.

369
00:48:30,438 --> 00:48:35,143
How well does each portion of the NPS current vision statement describe what you feel?

370
00:48:36,004 --> 00:48:39,167
You could ask the same question, but you just have to break it out differently.

371
00:48:39,247 --> 00:48:41,890
You'd have to translate it into chunks.

372
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:50,038
So it would not, right now it's showing as four questions, it would have to be broken out to be, I would say more.

373
00:48:51,447 --> 00:48:56,591
Yeah, and I guess I'm also talking specifically about the ladder survey questions too.

374
00:48:57,992 --> 00:48:59,273
And so that's exactly what I mean.

375
00:48:59,313 --> 00:49:07,860
Like I know, you know, just, I don't know, for example, with, and this is just a minor example of my own home, but like with Gracie, we don't often ask open-ended questions, right?

376
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,581
We ask multiple choice questions for her.

377
00:49:10,101 --> 00:49:14,625
These are all, yeah, they are all multiple choice questions, the demographic questions in particular.

378
00:49:15,145 --> 00:49:18,188
Oh, okay, so you can choose something that's already a pop-up.

379
00:49:18,228 --> 00:49:18,468
Yeah.

380
00:49:18,908 --> 00:49:19,168
Okay.

381
00:49:19,188 --> 00:49:20,449
So this was,

382
00:49:22,474 --> 00:49:26,055
This was the result of the superintendent search survey.

383
00:49:26,075 --> 00:49:26,696
Can you see this?

384
00:49:28,316 --> 00:49:33,579
So yeah, each question had a series of responses.

385
00:49:35,859 --> 00:49:44,683
The survey monkey itself recommended these allocations, if that makes sense.

386
00:49:44,903 --> 00:49:45,603
Yeah, I know it does.

387
00:49:45,723 --> 00:49:46,584
I remember.

388
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:49,305
So yeah, they're all here and I would,

389
00:49:50,968 --> 00:49:53,809
recommend that we use them just the way that they are.

390
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:59,052
Yeah.

391
00:50:03,114 --> 00:50:05,215
Do they offer not sures in any of those?

392
00:50:05,556 --> 00:50:07,436
I know I see a right there, but they have that.

393
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:09,337
Yeah, OK, I'm sure good, OK.

394
00:50:10,618 --> 00:50:11,659
OK, thank you.

395
00:50:16,341 --> 00:50:18,042
Yeah, so those would definitely be.

396
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:20,023
Broken down.

397
00:50:20,612 --> 00:50:20,972
that way.

398
00:50:32,717 --> 00:50:35,879
I know thoughts, questions, it's sort of just to start.

399
00:50:35,919 --> 00:50:41,861
Like I think you would definitely want to wait to finalize the questions until the roundtables were done.

400
00:50:43,602 --> 00:50:45,103
But that was sort of my,

401
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:51,243
my thought in terms of how do we meaningfully engage the community in this discussion.

402
00:51:02,951 --> 00:51:14,158
I guess my question would be with the survey piece going out after April vacation, how long were you thinking about having the survey open for?

403
00:51:15,423 --> 00:51:16,564
couple weeks tops.

404
00:51:18,225 --> 00:51:23,348
So I mean certainly it could go out like during April vacation.

405
00:51:23,428 --> 00:51:38,538
I just it it was sort of my sense that if we we would need some time between the roundtables and this kickoff of the survey to finalize the survey and then you'd want to send it out.

406
00:51:38,618 --> 00:51:41,160
So it could even I mean it could go out during the week of

407
00:51:41,584 --> 00:51:46,111
of April vacation or it could go out on your Friday communication before the end of that week.

408
00:51:49,236 --> 00:51:52,401
Somewhat flexible, but I wouldn't, you know, I feel like surveys are.

409
00:51:54,426 --> 00:51:59,749
sort of diminishing in the number of people, like people respond early, then it wanes.

410
00:51:59,889 --> 00:52:02,891
And then at the due date, you get the last flurry.

411
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:08,595
And that will stretch out sort of as long as you let the survey out there.

412
00:52:08,655 --> 00:52:14,399
So being finite about a couple of weeks, I feel like is more than enough time.

413
00:52:17,876 --> 00:52:28,041
And I definitely could remind people in weekly updates and in those kinds of things, keep putting a link to remind them.

414
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:32,242
Because sometimes when people know they have time, it goes both ways.

415
00:52:32,302 --> 00:52:35,144
They know they have time, so they're like, oh, I've got a month.

416
00:52:35,204 --> 00:52:35,984
I can get it done.

417
00:52:37,665 --> 00:52:39,386
So just trying to find that balance.

418
00:52:40,446 --> 00:52:40,606
Yeah.

419
00:52:42,547 --> 00:52:42,607
OK.

420
00:52:47,919 --> 00:52:52,526
Melanie, Kathy, any other questions, thoughts?

421
00:52:56,491 --> 00:53:01,058
And I will share this document, Dr. Edward Vincent with you and Susie as well.

422
00:53:08,856 --> 00:53:12,698
We are meeting one more time before this, right?

423
00:53:13,879 --> 00:53:14,479
Before the.

424
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:18,341
The school committee no no engagement.

425
00:53:19,122 --> 00:53:21,623
We would not be meeting another time or not.

426
00:53:24,545 --> 00:53:24,705
No.

427
00:53:25,646 --> 00:53:26,746
Well, we're not scheduled to.

428
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:35,111
We can, but we're not scheduled to.

429
00:53:36,395 --> 00:53:39,277
Yeah, March is a pretty packed month.

430
00:53:40,518 --> 00:53:46,483
I'm not advocating for more meetings, Dr. Edward Vincent, believe me, definitely, I hear you.

431
00:53:47,244 --> 00:54:01,876
But I think we have this, we have two regular scheduled meetings this month as well, where on Monday to be able to give an update and then we have another meeting at the end of the month

432
00:54:04,503 --> 00:54:15,787
So by the time that other meeting were to come at the end of the month, if there needed to be a specific update or something, that would at least give us some time.

433
00:54:15,867 --> 00:54:28,491
If there was something else that needed to be said, we could have it as new business and you could report out specifically on it as new business at the second meeting at the end of the month.

434
00:54:32,893 --> 00:54:33,153
Okay.

435
00:54:35,555 --> 00:54:37,116
Do you need a motion to approve?

436
00:54:37,136 --> 00:54:39,797
I think so.

437
00:54:39,817 --> 00:54:43,760
Okay, make a motion to approve these proposed.

438
00:54:47,142 --> 00:54:56,008
Okay, so motion to approve the proposed roundtable plan and survey by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Kretz.

439
00:54:56,808 --> 00:54:57,369
Roll call.

440
00:54:57,469 --> 00:54:58,950
So member Graham, yes.

441
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:00,431
Member Kretz?

442
00:55:01,011 --> 00:55:01,171
Yes.

443
00:55:03,507 --> 00:55:03,827
Yes.

444
00:55:04,747 --> 00:55:07,528
Three in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

445
00:55:07,988 --> 00:55:08,568
Motion passes.

446
00:55:10,469 --> 00:55:11,889
And that is the end of our agenda.

447
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:16,251
And you have 36 minutes left.

448
00:55:18,591 --> 00:55:20,652
You won the prize this past week.

449
00:55:20,812 --> 00:55:21,432
That is great.

450
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:24,633
That's a big one.

451
00:55:25,033 --> 00:55:26,113
Logging all my points.

452
00:55:27,354 --> 00:55:28,294
Yeah, exactly.

453
00:55:28,734 --> 00:55:30,074
Oh, do we get to carry them over?

454
00:55:30,094 --> 00:55:30,834
I didn't know that.

455
00:55:30,855 --> 00:55:31,615
Hold on a second.

456
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:35,514
Um, all right, so I make a motion to adjourn.

457
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:41,897
Okay, motion to adjourn by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kretz.

458
00:55:41,977 --> 00:55:43,719
Roll call, Member Graham, yes.

459
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:45,060
Member Kretz?

460
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:46,040
Yes.

461
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:47,542
Member McLaughlin?

462
00:55:48,382 --> 00:55:48,702
Yes.

463
00:55:49,803 --> 00:55:51,144
Just actually, sorry, excuse me.

464
00:55:51,184 --> 00:55:57,449
Did we do a roll call on, I mean, did we do a vote call on the motion to approve?

465
00:55:57,909 --> 00:55:58,130
Yes.

466
00:55:58,450 --> 00:55:58,850
Oh, we did?

467
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,511
Yeah.

468
00:55:59,531 --> 00:56:00,491
God, I must be getting tired.

469
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,752
I'm like, did we fund the roll call?

470
00:56:02,853 --> 00:56:04,655
All right, good, thank you.
