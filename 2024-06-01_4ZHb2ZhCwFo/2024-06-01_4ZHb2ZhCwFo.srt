1
00:00:02,568 --> 00:00:09,690
[SPEAKER_04]: So I believe that Councilor Tseng is going to be joining us from in just a little bit.

2
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:23,353
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do have quorum now, so I think we can get a request permission to record on this computer.

3
00:00:33,806 --> 00:00:39,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually have Councilor Tseng standing about three feet away from me, so he's technically present right now.

4
00:00:40,972 --> 00:00:46,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, go ahead and do the roll call.

5
00:00:47,138 --> 00:00:47,738
[SPEAKER_04]: My pleasure.

6
00:00:47,758 --> 00:00:48,939
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

7
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:51,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Callahan.

8
00:00:52,142 --> 00:00:52,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

9
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazzaro.

10
00:00:54,644 --> 00:00:54,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

11
00:00:55,685 --> 00:00:56,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Strackelly.

12
00:00:56,406 --> 00:00:56,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

13
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:04,063
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe he's absent.

14
00:01:04,603 --> 00:01:06,005
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see Councilor Scarpelli.

15
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:06,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

16
00:01:07,027 --> 00:01:08,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tseng, I see right behind me.

17
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:09,690
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to log on.

18
00:01:10,131 --> 00:01:10,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair Leming.

19
00:01:11,352 --> 00:01:11,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

20
00:01:12,314 --> 00:01:13,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to stand here until I log on.

21
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:26,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, just for full clarifications for the record, this meeting is starting half an hour late because the previous planning and permitting committee meeting went over.

22
00:01:26,156 --> 00:01:32,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to say that because of open meeting law.

23
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:43,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm streaming this meeting from the clerk's office because we're trying to troubleshoot a YouTube live stream, which is not on so well so far, but it's a work in progress.

24
00:01:44,285 --> 00:01:49,028
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are, and Councilor Tseng is also right up here as well.

25
00:01:49,748 --> 00:02:02,676
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are going to start by discussing paper 24-351, resolution to allow the director of veteran services to offer housing incentives to veteran renters.

26
00:02:04,977 --> 00:02:12,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially, this would edit the division

27
00:02:14,252 --> 00:02:25,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, this would edit the city's ordinances to give the director of veteran services additional authority to offer a cash incentive to landlords to.

28
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,171
[SPEAKER_04]: rent out to qualified veterans.

29
00:02:29,832 --> 00:02:37,796
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a program that she approached the city council with and I understand that some of my fellow Councilors have questions about it.

30
00:02:37,836 --> 00:02:40,358
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll leave it to Ms.

31
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:53,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Shaw who's present right now to go ahead and explain the idea behind the program and the problems that it is addressing and then hear from my, hear any questions from my fellow Councilors.

32
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:59,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't hear you.

33
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:07,073
[SPEAKER_05]: See if I can get her as a co-host and then we'll alleviate that.

34
00:03:07,173 --> 00:03:09,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Then she'll have to ask to unmute every time.

35
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm not saying that she's muted.

36
00:03:12,395 --> 00:03:15,435
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be an audio input situation.

37
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:22,397
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could check your speaker in there.

38
00:03:28,134 --> 00:03:28,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Francis?

39
00:03:29,896 --> 00:03:33,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Derek, just short if needed, just pop into my office and jump on.

40
00:03:35,622 --> 00:03:36,923
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that way.

41
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:41,948
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we still can't hear you.

42
00:03:41,968 --> 00:03:43,049
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'll come over.

43
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:43,530
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go.

44
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,531
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no.

45
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:45,372
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can't.

46
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:46,453
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can't.

47
00:03:46,513 --> 00:03:46,813
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

48
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:47,494
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.

49
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,993
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for having me again.

50
00:03:56,673 --> 00:04:07,298
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of a middle of the road class of veterans, not necessarily income, and certainly not our veterans that are not struggling at all.

51
00:04:08,218 --> 00:04:15,261
[SPEAKER_00]: But the people that are looking for a place to live, can afford it, or if they're using VASH,

52
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:19,758
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're struggling to find landlords that will rent to them.

53
00:04:20,278 --> 00:04:28,919
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a stigma associated with veterans that they're not good tenants.

54
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,980
[SPEAKER_00]: They cause problems.

55
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:38,441
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us do have SD, which a lot of people just put on that burden.

56
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:42,522
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have a lot of veterans that are looking for places to live.

57
00:04:43,402 --> 00:04:44,802
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hoping that what this,

58
00:04:45,492 --> 00:04:51,857
[SPEAKER_00]: will do, will incentivize landlords to take a chance on these veterans.

59
00:04:53,579 --> 00:05:03,006
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them have guaranteed income because they have VA disabilities that, you know, you can't, whether they lose their job or not, that money will always be there.

60
00:05:05,948 --> 00:05:15,196
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm hoping that this $500 a year stipend will help just encourage landlords to take that chance on a veteran.

61
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:24,832
[SPEAKER_00]: The money would come from our cash aid account and would be payable.

62
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:48,293
[SPEAKER_00]: write them a check they would the veteran or the landlord would have to become a vendor to the city so that we could write them that check and you know the logistics are things that you know i'm certainly open to suggestions of course we would have to make sure you know my office would validate the fact that they are a veteran we would check to make sure that you know if

63
00:05:49,193 --> 00:05:52,475
[SPEAKER_00]: that they left the service under honorable conditions.

64
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:59,639
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't do background checks, but we could certainly verify the military status.

65
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,922
[SPEAKER_00]: And going from there, you know, I would

66
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:09,695
[SPEAKER_00]: happily renew that every year as long as they were willing to run to a veteran.

67
00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:25,420
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start small with just doing four pairings of a landlord and a veteran just to see how it goes to see the how many veterans and how many landlords are willing to work with us on this.

68
00:06:26,338 --> 00:06:31,321
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully in the future, we can expand it to a lot more than that.

69
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:35,483
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, I think it's smart to start small and see how we can grow.

70
00:06:35,503 --> 00:06:40,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

71
00:06:41,627 --> 00:06:43,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions from my fellow Councilors?

72
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:51,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, ma'am.

73
00:06:53,971 --> 00:06:56,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, yes, so the sounds great.

74
00:06:56,753 --> 00:07:00,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anything that you would need from us for authorization to do this?

75
00:07:00,636 --> 00:07:03,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is it is it a city program that you would be able to implement?

76
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:11,884
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I'm the attachment that we have in the packet.

77
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:18,622
[SPEAKER_08]: is about your position, but not about the program that you're describing.

78
00:07:18,722 --> 00:07:21,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it a program that exists elsewhere or not really?

79
00:07:21,564 --> 00:07:23,505
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like an idea.

80
00:07:24,686 --> 00:07:28,168
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not part of any thing having to do with Medford.

81
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:32,371
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other communities in the country that are doing it, but this is a first for Medford.

82
00:07:32,771 --> 00:07:55,998
[SPEAKER_08]: cool well it sounds really awesome to me i definitely think that there's a place for programs like this uh i i think that there are a lot of situations where people who are really on the very low end of um sort of the economic ladder will have a lot of services that are available and then there are people that don't require any services but there are people that are somehow in the middle that you sort of experience some difficulty they kind of

83
00:07:56,798 --> 00:07:58,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, ma'am.

84
00:07:58,359 --> 00:08:01,121
[SPEAKER_08]: So this does sound like a program that would be really beneficial.

85
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:06,064
[SPEAKER_08]: And if there's a known issue, I'm I think that it's a great idea.

86
00:08:06,084 --> 00:08:20,753
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess what I'm curious about is how we can, you know, facilitate the process and how we can make sure that it's, you know, something that is

87
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Legal, I don't know.

88
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:26,971
[SPEAKER_04]: I can speak to that a little bit.

89
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:27,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

90
00:08:27,491 --> 00:08:29,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah For the interruption.

91
00:08:29,532 --> 00:08:33,034
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've had some communications of legal about this nothing.

92
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:38,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, nothing normal, but they um, uh, it was attorney austin.

93
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I have any email from her where she says she can

94
00:08:41,657 --> 00:08:51,381
[SPEAKER_04]: in order to review the legal authority, in order to establish legal authority for this, you would have to, she could review the public purpose, municipal finance limitations under state law.

95
00:08:51,761 --> 00:09:10,489
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that what would need to come from this committee tonight is a motion to request that legal, essentially review these documents in order, and just get us a memo to say that, you know, this is okay under the public, under public purpose limitations.

96
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:23,659
[SPEAKER_04]: I looked at other parts of the municipal code, and I just I think that putting this squarely in the veteran services office just every all things considered is the most appropriate.

97
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,784
[SPEAKER_04]: The other 4 do seem to be just taken straight out of state law, but again.

98
00:09:31,983 --> 00:09:44,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's there's literally four authorities that are directly granted in there, but I really don't see think that there'll be much of an issue with just putting this and there is an additional one on the city side.

99
00:09:44,398 --> 00:09:47,983
[SPEAKER_04]: I did have some discussions with.

100
00:09:49,224 --> 00:10:04,072
[SPEAKER_04]: the city's chief of staff in this area and just over, you know, I think that her concerns were, you know, just operationalizing it, having it, you know, having these funds recur year to year.

101
00:10:04,352 --> 00:10:15,498
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also think that those parts of it could probably be figured out sort of at the implementation level, whereas this is just mainly

102
00:10:16,923 --> 00:10:22,664
[SPEAKER_04]: explicitly saying that the Director of Veterans Services has the authority to implement this sort of a program.

103
00:10:22,684 --> 00:10:31,767
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't think that every single bit of this would necessarily need to be defined in the ordinance other than this very small paragraph.

104
00:10:32,907 --> 00:10:35,707
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope that lends some clarity there.

105
00:10:35,907 --> 00:10:39,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan, did I see your hand raised?

106
00:10:40,229 --> 00:10:40,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

107
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:42,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

108
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:55,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well, I would be happy to make that motion the motion to send this proposal to legal counsel so that we can, you know, facilitate this programs execution.

109
00:10:57,762 --> 00:11:25,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Lazzaro to send this to legal counsel to, I guess the specific wording should be to determine the, what would be a good word is, to send this to legal for review, probably the best way to phrase it, and keep the paper in committee, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

110
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:31,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any further discussion?

111
00:11:35,405 --> 00:11:37,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

112
00:11:39,508 --> 00:11:39,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

113
00:11:40,469 --> 00:11:41,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazzaro?

114
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:42,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

115
00:11:42,771 --> 00:11:44,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

116
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tseng?

117
00:11:48,777 --> 00:11:50,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tseng may be temporarily absent actually.

118
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:53,261
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just unmuted.

119
00:11:57,913 --> 00:12:00,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.

120
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,998
[SPEAKER_03]: The audio for me cut out for a second, for a minute.

121
00:12:08,221 --> 00:12:08,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

122
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:08,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

123
00:12:08,721 --> 00:12:11,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, let me say yes.

124
00:12:14,585 --> 00:12:14,806
So.

125
00:12:14,926 --> 00:12:15,026
OK.

126
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:30,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it says network bandwidth is low.

127
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:31,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

128
00:12:33,894 --> 00:12:35,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I can share that was in my office.

129
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:35,955
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a yes.

130
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Council yet Council saying is a yes.

131
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:38,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

132
00:12:39,076 --> 00:12:44,258
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we have, we have four, we have four in favor, zero opposed and Councilor Scarpelli absent.

133
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:47,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

134
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

135
00:12:50,201 --> 00:12:50,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

136
00:12:52,782 --> 00:12:54,122
[SPEAKER_04]: You record Shaw.

137
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,932
[SPEAKER_04]: very much for attending.

138
00:12:59,852 --> 00:13:10,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we are going to move on to 24354 resolution to publish the City Council newsletter.

139
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:18,985
[SPEAKER_04]: The draft of the current newsletter, which was so kindly prepared by

140
00:13:20,936 --> 00:13:25,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lazzaro, that should be in everybody's agenda packet.

141
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:36,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I am just going to pull up the draft of it just so that we can prepare for any edits that may be necessary.

142
00:13:36,266 --> 00:13:37,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

143
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:40,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, good.

144
00:13:41,365 --> 00:13:41,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

145
00:13:41,805 --> 00:13:45,326
[SPEAKER_04]: There was 1 suggestion that.

146
00:13:46,007 --> 00:13:49,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Was taken that I took in just in the.

147
00:13:50,188 --> 00:13:53,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Few days in between, so I think that there's still a little bit of.

148
00:13:55,676 --> 00:14:01,961
[SPEAKER_04]: still a little bit of few details that need to be worked out in terms of who's distributing it.

149
00:14:02,382 --> 00:14:11,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that the city clerk received an influx of emails after his email was put directly on the last newsletter.

150
00:14:11,068 --> 00:14:19,655
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that discussions about distribution by the city would still need to be discussed.

151
00:14:19,715 --> 00:14:21,457
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the meantime, I put,

152
00:14:22,418 --> 00:14:34,949
[SPEAKER_04]: hear a Bitly link, Bitly Medford City Council newsletter, which links to a Google form that both have access to.

153
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:37,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially, this is just a very simple thing that

154
00:14:39,113 --> 00:14:46,101
[SPEAKER_04]: people would be able to come up with people potentially would be able to just look at on their on their websites.

155
00:14:46,862 --> 00:14:49,105
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a suggestion by myself.

156
00:14:49,726 --> 00:14:54,832
[SPEAKER_04]: But otherwise, if anybody else has any discussion on that or any suggestions, I'd be pleased to hear it.

157
00:14:54,952 --> 00:14:55,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Calderon.

158
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:57,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

159
00:14:58,058 --> 00:15:04,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you mind sending, because I'm not sure if I have access to this document and with OML, but I probably shouldn't.

160
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:12,591
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you can, I would love to send the ability to sign up the sign up form to folks that I know.

161
00:15:12,691 --> 00:15:15,873
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you can send that bitly link out, that would be great.

162
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,036
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did have one and only one comment.

163
00:15:20,797 --> 00:15:21,598
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the newsletter.

164
00:15:21,658 --> 00:15:25,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much to Councilor Lazzaro for writing it up.

165
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,962
[SPEAKER_09]: And I enjoy the exclamation points and the this is very exciting.

166
00:15:32,002 --> 00:15:34,484
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a lovely personal touch.

167
00:15:35,384 --> 00:15:38,545
[SPEAKER_09]: I have one suggestion, which is that we do not

168
00:15:41,138 --> 00:16:00,683
[SPEAKER_09]: say, we make statements like this is popular legislation in Medford and many residents spoke in favor of the resolution simply because, you know, it is my experience having talked to city councilors across the country and also looked at a lot of studies on, you know,

169
00:16:01,463 --> 00:16:11,394
[SPEAKER_09]: what happens inside city council chambers and who emails and you know talks to their legislators and who is usually left out of that conversation that

170
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:21,020
[SPEAKER_09]: just because people appear at the city council chamber and make a statement does not mean that it is popular in the city.

171
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:30,786
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we should not be stating as a city council, this is popular in the city, because I think it's not a fair statement for us to say.

172
00:16:30,806 --> 00:16:35,209
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would just recommend that we don't make statements like that in the newsletter.

173
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:43,054
[SPEAKER_09]: I think people who disagree might be unhappy that we are making this as a blanket statement.

174
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:53,448
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just kind of overall, I think that we should probably refrain from using those kinds of commentary about popularity of stuff in the city of Medford.

175
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:55,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

176
00:16:57,093 --> 00:16:59,556
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, Councilor Nazaro.

177
00:17:01,027 --> 00:17:18,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, just to quickly reply, um, uh, the only reason I put that in is because there were, um, there was like no opposition in the chambers to that particular piece of legislation, which was unique for our, which, you know, the Councilors know, uh, that is unique for our experience when we are presenting, um,

178
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,171
[SPEAKER_08]: a piece of legislation.

179
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:24,853
[SPEAKER_08]: So that seems sort of safe to me.

180
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:26,854
[SPEAKER_08]: But that is a super fair point.

181
00:17:27,334 --> 00:17:29,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Callahan and I appreciate you bringing that up.

182
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:31,016
[SPEAKER_08]: So I definitely support us pulling that out.

183
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:33,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I haven't thought about it that way.

184
00:17:33,998 --> 00:17:36,299
[SPEAKER_08]: That's, that's definitely I would agree with that.

185
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so yes, agreed.

186
00:17:45,017 --> 00:17:47,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I was on mute.

187
00:17:47,747 --> 00:17:49,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I would agree with Councilor Callaghan.

188
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:54,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, I like how personable this is.

189
00:17:54,912 --> 00:18:12,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I think sometimes maybe we should refrain a little bit from, as much as possible, from personal commentary, or even if it's a council commentary on an issue, I think we need to walk the line.

190
00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:17,593
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think what Councilor Callahan brought up is an example of that.

191
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:25,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

192
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:47,637
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would, being a scientist and in favor of impartial, neutral language, I would also, now that I'm kind of saying it, and I should, full disclosure, just say that I have already reviewed this, but looking at it, it's kind of with eyes, like a big set of eyes.

193
00:18:49,008 --> 00:18:54,637
[SPEAKER_04]: I would also favor just kind of getting, removing this part.

194
00:18:54,657 --> 00:18:57,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I know it's fun and personable, but.

195
00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:02,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lazzaro.

196
00:19:03,427 --> 00:19:04,187
[SPEAKER_08]: That's totally fine.

197
00:19:06,449 --> 00:19:18,875
[SPEAKER_08]: As the first not-Councilor-Leming person to write a newsletter, I was experimenting with how much of my own voice we were going to have be part of this.

198
00:19:19,315 --> 00:19:24,078
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm comfortable with removing any of the non-facts in here.

199
00:19:24,518 --> 00:19:27,440
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, I guess this is something for us to discuss as a committee.

200
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,881
[SPEAKER_08]: How much of the newsletter is

201
00:19:33,376 --> 00:19:34,864
[SPEAKER_08]: And now we don't weep.

202
00:19:36,889 --> 00:19:46,013
[SPEAKER_08]: To also to articulate just a small bit of my background, I used to write literal humor pieces for the internet.

203
00:19:46,974 --> 00:19:50,375
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the least I could have possibly done.

204
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,316
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's still, I understand, too much.

205
00:19:53,197 --> 00:20:01,000
[SPEAKER_08]: So that all being said, we can remove all of the anything that's anything but exactly what happened.

206
00:20:05,754 --> 00:20:13,019
[SPEAKER_08]: That being said, I guess I do wonder, what is the newsletter besides a list of what happened?

207
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:14,379
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess the answer is nothing.

208
00:20:14,499 --> 00:20:15,780
[SPEAKER_08]: It is just a list of what happened.

209
00:20:16,221 --> 00:20:18,262
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's because people don't know what happened.

210
00:20:18,362 --> 00:20:19,382
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what we're communicating.

211
00:20:19,402 --> 00:20:21,364
[SPEAKER_08]: We're telling people what happened so that they know.

212
00:20:22,424 --> 00:20:27,427
[SPEAKER_08]: So I do want people to be interested, but the point isn't for people to be entertained.

213
00:20:27,507 --> 00:20:29,809
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just for people to be made aware of something.

214
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:31,250
[SPEAKER_08]: So, understood.

215
00:20:33,028 --> 00:20:38,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, my internet connection is unstable, so I thought that you were finished when it was just a lag.

216
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng, do you have anything further?

217
00:20:47,394 --> 00:20:53,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I meant to lower my hand, but now that you did call on me.

218
00:20:54,781 --> 00:21:02,427
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some more specific lines to take out, or one specific line to take out, I think that's also in the commentary vein.

219
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:13,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I think regardless of our views on the success of certain city programs, I think we should be careful about talking about them that way.

220
00:21:14,112 --> 00:21:19,374
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the line that's highlighted, I would prefer if we took it out just for neutrality.

221
00:21:19,394 --> 00:21:24,176
[SPEAKER_03]: And because what?

222
00:21:25,806 --> 00:21:31,549
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know if we're expanding the BWC program, the body one standard program.

223
00:21:32,509 --> 00:21:34,790
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a set plan for it.

224
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:41,613
[SPEAKER_03]: And I personally wouldn't necessarily call that an expansion or using it more widely, but I digress.

225
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:47,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I think similarly, there was a bullet point about the budget.

226
00:21:48,735 --> 00:21:52,361
[SPEAKER_03]: budget ordinance earlier on in the document.

227
00:21:53,363 --> 00:21:55,907
[SPEAKER_03]: I do actually think we can push that one.

228
00:21:59,537 --> 00:22:04,462
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the one I meant was at the 30th, April 30th meeting, the final vote was taken to make the budget ordinance law.

229
00:22:05,143 --> 00:22:10,247
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I think it would still be helpful if we provide one sentence about what that budget ordinance is.

230
00:22:10,528 --> 00:22:19,416
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's essentially like the fact that it's creating a new and earlier budget schedule for the mayor.

231
00:22:19,557 --> 00:22:22,279
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am seeing that there's actually a repeat line.

232
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:23,761
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really a.

233
00:22:25,607 --> 00:22:39,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I did notice that, and I think if there's a way to restructure it so that, I mean, I personally don't have a very specific suggestion, but to restructure a little bit.

234
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:48,785
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just when you read the budget ordinance bullet point, it's not entirely clear what it is, but then I guess there is context above.

235
00:22:50,346 --> 00:22:53,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if the committee has any suggestions for that.

236
00:22:54,209 --> 00:22:54,870
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a suggestion.

237
00:22:56,162 --> 00:22:58,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan.

238
00:22:58,162 --> 00:23:04,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we just, at the April 30th meeting, the final vote was taken to make the budget ordinance law, make that the first bullet point.

239
00:23:05,904 --> 00:23:11,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though it, you know, things may be slightly out of chronological order, nobody cares.

240
00:23:11,685 --> 00:23:16,446
[SPEAKER_09]: I think people just need to understand what happened.

241
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,867
[SPEAKER_09]: So make that the first bullet point.

242
00:23:20,051 --> 00:23:32,903
[SPEAKER_09]: At the end of that bullet point, have our one sentence about what it is, and then the next bullet can say, in anticipation, we met many times to hear a city department's budget proposals.

243
00:23:35,265 --> 00:23:41,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Or in alignment with the budget ordinance, we met many times in committee of the whole to hear city department budgets.

244
00:23:49,389 --> 00:23:53,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Alignment with the new budget ordinance, new budget ordinance law, I feel like that's.

245
00:23:54,832 --> 00:23:55,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Redundant, yeah.

246
00:23:55,912 --> 00:23:59,594
[SPEAKER_06]: The budget may come to, I think it comes to the law.

247
00:23:59,794 --> 00:24:18,684
[SPEAKER_09]: To the law, and so the sentence at the end of that first bullet point can be something like, this new ordinance requires that the city council and public be more

248
00:24:19,986 --> 00:24:22,427
[SPEAKER_09]: be involved earlier in the budgeting process.

249
00:24:24,568 --> 00:24:25,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that fair?

250
00:24:25,068 --> 00:24:27,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to say more than that?

251
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:28,689
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's fine.

252
00:24:31,391 --> 00:24:43,735
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing here is, and this is a bit of Cher's editorial review, but when I'm formatting this, I'll include links to all of these, which is only accessible in the digital version, but still.

253
00:24:45,976 --> 00:24:48,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I did want to address.

254
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:50,000
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if Councilor.

255
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:54,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Was Zara's point about.

256
00:24:55,545 --> 00:24:58,168
[SPEAKER_04]: This being the individual so.

257
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:14,277
[SPEAKER_04]: I do feel like when we're starting out with this newsletter, it is best to err on the side of caution and humor could perhaps come in at a later time when it's sort of a more established thing.

258
00:25:14,537 --> 00:25:24,022
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do think that having a positive spin on things is not a bad thing, especially when we're giving $250,000 to all these organizations in the community.

259
00:25:29,685 --> 00:25:56,005
[SPEAKER_04]: having like phrasing that in a positive in a positive light is not a bad thing but when starting out it I think it is it is best to just kind of like present things as they're as they happen and then when we sort of see what this becomes we'll kind of like be more familiar like what we're able to and not able to do with it

260
00:25:59,537 --> 00:26:17,724
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that was a great perspective on that, but I don't, we don't necessarily have to like avoid any sort of humor whatsoever, but I do understand the reaction that we're starting at.

261
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Councilor Tseng.

262
00:26:22,947 --> 00:26:25,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, I was just gonna say that I agree with that take.

263
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,292
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that there's no place for it.

264
00:26:28,512 --> 00:26:36,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in the future, when this becomes more established, I would agree that we can find a place for it.

265
00:26:38,101 --> 00:26:41,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I think just in the beginning, hearing on the side of caution makes a lot of sense.

266
00:26:43,586 --> 00:26:44,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Calderon.

267
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:45,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

268
00:26:46,224 --> 00:26:51,426
[SPEAKER_09]: I just did want to mention that I have to leave at 10 after, unfortunately.

269
00:26:51,446 --> 00:26:56,207
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wanted to ask, I'm fine with the newsletter as it is.

270
00:26:56,227 --> 00:27:04,049
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know whether other folks are ready to vote on that, but I would ask that we

271
00:27:05,589 --> 00:27:09,852
[SPEAKER_09]: That I can make a motion to disband the subcommittee on listening sessions today.

272
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:18,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think, as we discussed earlier, that it does make the scheduling part very difficult for the listening sessions.

273
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:22,781
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be my request that we'd be able to do that before eight.

274
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:30,450
[SPEAKER_04]: So, okay, so actually I do remember that we did talk about that and the recent subcommittee.

275
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:38,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Clerk, would you be able to comment on is that acceptable under open meeting law because listening sessions is not technically on this agenda.

276
00:27:39,195 --> 00:27:42,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sorry, I thought that we were specifically going to do it at this meeting but maybe I was wrong.

277
00:27:44,181 --> 00:27:47,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that was discussed, but this could be an oversight on my end.

278
00:27:48,623 --> 00:27:51,584
[SPEAKER_05]: I would characterize that, Mr. Chairman, as a gray area.

279
00:27:51,664 --> 00:27:58,067
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not think that is specifically prohibited simply because it has been on the agenda before.

280
00:27:58,868 --> 00:28:03,390
[SPEAKER_05]: You would definitely be cleaner and safer by having it as an item on the agenda.

281
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:07,231
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know that that would be prohibited.

282
00:28:07,732 --> 00:28:12,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I'm not the authority on the opening law, but I think you could probably

283
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,271
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure that it's expressly prohibited.

284
00:28:19,332 --> 00:28:20,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay.

285
00:28:21,552 --> 00:28:22,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Tseng.

286
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:26,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just advise in that case that we err on the side of caution.

287
00:28:26,934 --> 00:28:29,315
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say that I supported the motion.

288
00:28:30,956 --> 00:28:42,941
[SPEAKER_03]: And for folks who may be tuning in, I don't think there are many folks tuning in right now, but for folks who are tuning in, we worked through a lot of logistical planning.

289
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:58,485
[SPEAKER_03]: when it came to the listening sessions at our subcommittee meeting, and having planned a lot of what we needed to do together out, disbanding it at this point makes more sense for scheduling, as Councilor Callahan said.

290
00:28:59,485 --> 00:29:04,468
[SPEAKER_03]: With that being said, I would, with the clerk's advice, I would err on the side of caution.

291
00:29:04,588 --> 00:29:10,431
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have one listening session lined up for pretty soon, and we'll have more,

292
00:29:11,713 --> 00:29:17,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we'll have more in the future after we meet again in committee in this committee.

293
00:29:17,915 --> 00:29:21,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there might be one listening session that we schedule.

294
00:29:21,356 --> 00:29:27,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I could be wrong, but we might have time for one more before this committee meets again, but I think it should be all right.

295
00:29:28,638 --> 00:29:28,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

296
00:29:29,318 --> 00:29:30,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, council Zara.

297
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,180
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

298
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,141
[SPEAKER_07]: My, my issue is about the newsletter.

299
00:29:37,241 --> 00:29:40,762
[SPEAKER_07]: There's just a word that's misspelled acknowledgements in the, um, the line.

300
00:29:41,124 --> 00:29:42,145
[SPEAKER_07]: It has an extra E, I think.

301
00:29:42,645 --> 00:29:45,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, uh... There you go.

302
00:29:45,707 --> 00:29:46,127
[SPEAKER_06]: On the top.

303
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:51,091
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just checking if that's spelled right.

304
00:29:51,111 --> 00:29:51,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it?

305
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:56,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, am I... Is that it?

306
00:29:58,236 --> 00:29:58,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

307
00:30:03,019 --> 00:30:05,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's spelled correctly.

308
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just, uh... I think you're thinking judgment, which has no E.

309
00:30:10,262 --> 00:30:12,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you know, you know, it's the same way.

310
00:30:13,365 --> 00:30:14,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

311
00:30:15,546 --> 00:30:17,628
[SPEAKER_05]: The British spelling puts an extra in both of them.

312
00:30:18,969 --> 00:30:19,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're right.

313
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:19,930
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right.

314
00:30:21,712 --> 00:30:22,612
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to.

315
00:30:22,973 --> 00:30:23,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

316
00:30:23,193 --> 00:30:27,136
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we hopefully we can get this done.

317
00:30:27,516 --> 00:30:29,638
[SPEAKER_04]: deadline.

318
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,340
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no.

319
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,741
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that's okay.

320
00:30:33,782 --> 00:30:38,626
[SPEAKER_04]: So do we have a motion on the floor to approve?

321
00:30:39,494 --> 00:30:40,554
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

322
00:30:41,955 --> 00:30:44,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, if I may, I have a question.

323
00:30:45,216 --> 00:30:52,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we need a motion to allow you to add in links if we want to add in links to different ordinances?

324
00:30:54,378 --> 00:31:02,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure, we could do that motion as well.

325
00:31:02,081 --> 00:31:05,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Callahan.

326
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I move that the chair can always add the links in?

327
00:31:11,062 --> 00:31:19,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Any links that the chair deems necessary, the chair can always add those links that are relevant and necessary into the final document.

328
00:31:20,827 --> 00:31:21,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I would second that.

329
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:29,211
[SPEAKER_04]: And can we add to that motion to approve the newsletter?

330
00:31:29,231 --> 00:31:30,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, to approve the newsletter.

331
00:31:31,713 --> 00:31:32,553
[SPEAKER_04]: And to keep the paper.

332
00:31:32,793 --> 00:31:34,454
[SPEAKER_09]: As amended, as edited.

333
00:31:35,253 --> 00:31:35,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

334
00:31:35,973 --> 00:31:36,934
[SPEAKER_04]: And keep the paper in committee.

335
00:31:37,554 --> 00:31:38,355
[SPEAKER_09]: And keep the paper in committee.

336
00:31:38,895 --> 00:31:39,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

337
00:31:39,235 --> 00:31:41,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Clerk, will you spell the roll?

338
00:31:44,198 --> 00:31:45,499
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll be ready.

339
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,640
[SPEAKER_05]: And who's the second?

340
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

341
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Justin.

342
00:31:50,021 --> 00:31:50,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I am.

00:31:51,162 --> 00:31:51,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

344
00:31:55,084 --> 00:31:55,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Hang on a second.

345
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:56,465

[SPEAKER_04]: Motion is passed.

355
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any other motions on the floor?

356
00:32:15,742 --> 00:32:16,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to adjourn.

357
00:32:17,203 --> 00:32:17,643
