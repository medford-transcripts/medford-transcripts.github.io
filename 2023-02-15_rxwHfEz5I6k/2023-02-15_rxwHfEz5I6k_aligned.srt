00:00:10,157 --> 00:00:13,078
I am Julie Morrow and I teach cosmetology.

2
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:23,642
Some of the highlights of our shop is being able to work on people.

3
00:00:24,703 --> 00:00:30,845
Having actually live clients come into the shop and being able to do nails here and skin services for them.

4
00:00:34,226 --> 00:00:36,307
I'm Danelle and I'm a junior in cosmetology.

5
00:00:36,687 --> 00:00:39,028
I was interested in nail art and hair color.

6
00:00:42,014 --> 00:00:47,902
and do nail art with the correction tools.

7
00:00:48,102 --> 00:00:49,944
The teachers are very nice.

8
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:55,171
I just really like doing hair and making people feel good about themselves.

9
00:00:55,671 --> 00:00:59,917
After high school, I plan on doing cosmetology and getting my license.

10
00:01:03,142 --> 00:01:06,365
I joined this shop because I knew I wanted to open a salon.

11
00:01:06,665 --> 00:01:12,069
My favorite project we've done has to be the Halloween too, but I love that we get to work on each other.

12
00:01:12,089 --> 00:01:22,016
My plan after high school is to pursue aesthetics, like facials, makeup, stuff like that.

13
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:29,031
Some of the opportunities are being a hair stylist.

14
00:01:29,331 --> 00:01:31,973
You could actually be a makeup artist.

15
00:01:32,234 --> 00:01:36,497
You could go on to work in the field of making the products or selling the products.

16
00:01:36,837 --> 00:01:41,581
Also, there's extension schools where you could go to learn how to do hair extensions.

17
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:47,365
And also, there's additional schooling for advanced aesthetics and barbering.
