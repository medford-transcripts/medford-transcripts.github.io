1
00:00:00,411 --> 00:00:02,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, this is the Medford Historical Commission.

2
00:00:02,433 --> 00:00:07,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Today is Monday, July 8th, and we will open up the meeting.

3
00:00:08,018 --> 00:00:10,460
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll read our governor's statement here.

4
00:00:11,201 --> 00:00:18,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Pursuant to Chapter 20 of the Acts of 2021, this meeting of the City of Medford Historical Commission will be conducted via remote means.

5
00:00:18,548 --> 00:00:23,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Members of the public who wish to access the meeting may do so by using the Zoom link provided for in the agenda.

6
00:00:24,433 --> 00:00:32,080
[SPEAKER_05]: No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, and public participation in any public hearing during this meeting shall be by remote means only.

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:40,707
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a fairly light agenda this month, but we will get started nonetheless.

8
00:00:42,188 --> 00:00:51,075
[SPEAKER_05]: So just to update folks on 18 Wedgmere Road, the owners have asked us to table that case.

9
00:00:53,443 --> 00:00:55,946
[SPEAKER_05]: They are trying to decide what they want to do with the property.

10
00:00:57,667 --> 00:01:00,570
[SPEAKER_05]: So until we hear from them, we will table this one.

11
00:01:03,633 --> 00:01:08,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving forward, Wackling Court.

12
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:10,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Ryan, I know you wanted to talk about this one.

13
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,723
[SPEAKER_05]: You're muted.

14
00:01:17,308 --> 00:01:28,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Marklingport put in for their demo permit, but I saw no sign of documentation or contract for archaeological supervision during demolition.

15
00:01:29,452 --> 00:01:41,777
[SPEAKER_03]: So I intend to reach out to the, via the permit system to ask for those two things as a, before signing off on their building permit for demolition.

16
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:47,366
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so do we write a letter.

17
00:01:47,386 --> 00:01:48,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to throw a letter.

18
00:01:49,248 --> 00:01:53,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I think just a simple email because I think our section 106 letter.

19
00:01:53,491 --> 00:02:02,919
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing I'm going to do is ask if they've completed the section 106 review through HUD, because the Massachusetts Historical Commission actually noted that they are not the entity that is

20
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:14,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if that's what's required for this because it's the federal level that it's actually hot that needs to make that determination that they haven't concluded that process of the section 106 review process.

21
00:02:20,742 --> 00:02:38,130
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like them to provide those three things, evidence that they've completed that process and received permission from HUD to move forward and that they are going to fulfill their requirements of documentation before the buildings are demoed and then the archaeological monitoring during demo.

22
00:02:41,952 --> 00:02:42,172
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

23
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:47,455
[SPEAKER_05]: So what do we need to document anything?

24
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:52,414
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to put that in the permit system so that it goes right over to the applicant.

25
00:02:52,935 --> 00:02:57,959
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from there, it will be up to them to reach out to us and get us that information.

26
00:02:58,059 --> 00:03:02,623
[SPEAKER_03]: There are scans of the original blueprints of the original buildings.

27
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:04,224
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not documentation.

28
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,505
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not what we asked for.

29
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:05,565
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

30
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,702
[SPEAKER_05]: We, did we officially review this?

31
00:03:13,142 --> 00:03:13,982
[SPEAKER_05]: We did, right?

32
00:03:14,062 --> 00:03:18,984
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, did we review for demolition, for demo delay purposes?

33
00:03:19,244 --> 00:03:19,765
[SPEAKER_03]: We did.

34
00:03:20,385 --> 00:03:22,005
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not old enough for demo delay.

35
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:22,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, okay.

36
00:03:22,506 --> 00:03:24,346
[SPEAKER_03]: We reviewed it under section 106 review.

37
00:03:24,947 --> 00:03:25,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, okay.

38
00:03:27,868 --> 00:03:28,328
[SPEAKER_05]: So, okay.

39
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:34,513
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can't really hold up their permit.

40
00:03:34,893 --> 00:03:35,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yes, we can.

41
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:45,817
[SPEAKER_03]: They've they've asked us for a sign off and they've they've they've asked us to do something and this is the point where you make a determination of whether or not they fulfill that or not.

42
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:51,080
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm we will not be signing off on that building permit until we get the information that they.

43
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Said that they would provide us.

44
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:56,762
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not under demo delay.

45
00:03:56,862 --> 00:04:00,343
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not under the order of their demo delay, but it is section 106 review.

46
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:07,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to be clear that the permit hold is not for demo delay.

47
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:07,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

48
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:15,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryan, are you suggesting there's some bad faith or unwillingness to comply with our previous requests?

49
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,370
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I just don't want it to be forgotten.

50
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:19,330
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

51
00:04:21,711 --> 00:04:28,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as soon as they get the demo permit, they can go and demo the buildings.

52
00:04:32,757 --> 00:04:33,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

53
00:04:34,298 --> 00:04:39,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I did go in today and cleared out some other permits, but I didn't touch those.

54
00:04:39,141 --> 00:04:42,022
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, okay.

55
00:04:42,062 --> 00:04:59,793
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're going to upload a document and we're going to put their permit on hold and pending, um, you know, the contracts and whatnot for, um, the proper documentation that we agreed to in the section 106 review.

56
00:05:00,253 --> 00:05:00,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

57
00:05:01,694 --> 00:05:01,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

58
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do that tonight.

59
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:04,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

60
00:05:08,784 --> 00:05:13,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anybody else have anything as it pertains to new business?

61
00:05:18,032 --> 00:05:18,212
[SPEAKER_05]: No?

62
00:05:18,672 --> 00:05:18,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

63
00:05:19,622 --> 00:05:24,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on to old business, properties under demo delay.

64
00:05:24,384 --> 00:05:26,004
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that we have any updates.

65
00:05:26,445 --> 00:05:26,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Jen.

66
00:05:27,305 --> 00:05:27,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

67
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:29,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I was muted there.

68
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm sorry Peter, go ahead.

69
00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:36,108
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I did was I attended that meeting for the fire department headquarters.

70
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:37,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, how was that?

71
00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:38,829
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good.

72
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:47,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they had suggested that people who weren't involved with traffic

73
00:05:49,404 --> 00:05:53,812
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, come an hour later and I had to go to awake anyway.

74
00:05:53,892 --> 00:05:54,392
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um,

75
00:05:56,481 --> 00:06:05,305
[SPEAKER_02]: I joined a little bit late and it would have been better if I'd have been there at the beginning because I really didn't get to see the architectural plans because of that.

76
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:10,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the site plan, but I didn't really see the architectural plans.

77
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,049
[SPEAKER_02]: It's under flux anyway.

78
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:21,074
[SPEAKER_02]: They're mostly talking about curb cuts and parking, bus stops as it pertains to the building.

79
00:06:23,504 --> 00:06:40,394
[SPEAKER_02]: The existing building will be demoed, and then there's gonna be parking where the existing building is, and then the new building is gonna go, let's say, closer to Dunkin' Donuts, if you will, further away from the measured square.

80
00:06:42,095 --> 00:06:47,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, further away from the, so there'll be, essentially, the police station will be at one end, and then,

81
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:55,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Further along after the kind of where the, where mystic wise off.

82
00:06:55,593 --> 00:07:03,237
[SPEAKER_02]: And further to the right will be the, the new fire department headquarters, and then there'll be kind of parking in between.

83
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:06,679
[SPEAKER_02]: But they were talking about an additional curb cut.

84
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,722
[SPEAKER_02]: They're talking about what's if it's better for.

85
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,404
[SPEAKER_02]: the fire engines to back in or pull through.

86
00:07:17,424 --> 00:07:23,510
[SPEAKER_02]: So those were some of the, you know, kind of higher level stuff that still seemed to be in flux.

87
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:28,876
[SPEAKER_02]: But, and unfortunately, I didn't get to see if they had any building elevations or not.

88
00:07:29,977 --> 00:07:32,419
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a sawtooth building in plan, but.

89
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:44,820
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if that's something that we can request, or will they send around, Dennis, do you know, will they send around, like, does community development still need to get involved in this?

90
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,844
[SPEAKER_05]: And will there be some other reviews once plans are a little bit more formal?

91
00:07:52,553 --> 00:07:58,476
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's going to have to go through community development board because for site point of view, I would imagine it has to.

92
00:07:58,736 --> 00:07:59,557
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll check tomorrow.

93
00:07:59,597 --> 00:08:00,717
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll check when I get in tomorrow.

94
00:08:01,118 --> 00:08:03,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause when I'm not sure Danielle's out.

95
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,120
[SPEAKER_01]: So whenever she gets back in, I'll check with her.

96
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,760
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll check with Alicia just to see.

97
00:08:07,201 --> 00:08:10,723
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if it is, then yeah, you'll absolutely get it.

98
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:19,027
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if not, we can, we can work on getting you, you all them, the plans when they're, as they're going.

99
00:08:19,962 --> 00:08:20,762
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, that would be great.

100
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:27,804
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, Ryan, what's the age of the fire headquarters?

101
00:08:27,844 --> 00:08:29,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it even fall under our purview?

102
00:08:29,344 --> 00:08:31,544
[SPEAKER_03]: 65, I think.

103
00:08:32,005 --> 00:08:32,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, OK.

104
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:35,405
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're just giving comments as a courtesy.

105
00:08:35,425 --> 00:08:35,465
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

106
00:08:39,106 --> 00:08:40,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thanks for doing that, Peter.

107
00:08:40,526 --> 00:08:42,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they were all wondering who I was.

108
00:08:44,427 --> 00:08:44,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Who are you?

109
00:08:44,827 --> 00:08:46,949
[SPEAKER_02]: They were everybody was very nice to me.

110
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:53,415
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it seemed like they have a good dialogue going on, a lot of good ideas flowing.

111
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:56,778
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it should be a good, great project.

112
00:08:57,158 --> 00:09:02,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't really get to see the architect Peter of the project.

113
00:09:02,663 --> 00:09:03,784
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't catch that.

114
00:09:04,905 --> 00:09:05,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

115
00:09:07,475 --> 00:09:09,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it the same people that did the library?

116
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:10,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it is it Burtex?

117
00:09:10,998 --> 00:09:14,241
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's the same architect.

118
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:17,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK.

119
00:09:17,705 --> 00:09:23,070
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be, but I didn't catch that and I wasn't sure there was a.

120
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,071
[SPEAKER_02]: A civil guy there.

121
00:09:28,191 --> 00:09:32,112
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't sure who everybody was because I missed all the intros at the beginning.

122
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:46,075
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, Peter, I don't think I want to wait for the final site plan when everything's baked in and it's basically done to be able to have some comments if we can see anything about massing circulation.

123
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:54,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Even a draft would be, I think, useful because at that point, it's hard to change anything if it's been going on for a year or so.

124
00:09:55,717 --> 00:09:59,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know if those plans are available, Dennis, the ones that we were looking at.

125
00:10:02,098 --> 00:10:02,538
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be.

126
00:10:02,558 --> 00:10:06,539
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, I would assume so.

127
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:14,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I can check tomorrow on our drive and see what's available and what's not.

128
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:17,681
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I get something, I'll shoot you all a link to it.

129
00:10:19,241 --> 00:10:20,002
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, that'd be great.

130
00:10:20,362 --> 00:10:21,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Was the meeting recorded, Peter?

131
00:10:24,132 --> 00:10:24,792
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if it's on.

132
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:25,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.

133
00:10:25,952 --> 00:10:26,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.

134
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:26,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

135
00:10:27,313 --> 00:10:27,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

136
00:10:28,313 --> 00:10:30,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if we can get the plan, so either way.

137
00:10:30,973 --> 00:10:37,314
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, thanks for that update.

138
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:38,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

139
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:45,036
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like it's the architect was the Galante Architecture Studio.

140
00:10:45,556 --> 00:10:47,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Galante, that's right.

141
00:10:49,397 --> 00:10:50,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't sure if he was the.

142
00:10:51,922 --> 00:10:54,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Civil guy or the architect guys?

143
00:10:57,584 --> 00:10:59,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Has it actually been awarded?

144
00:10:59,104 --> 00:11:03,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is this just, like, I wasn't sure how far.

145
00:11:03,585 --> 00:11:04,105
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed like it.

146
00:11:04,145 --> 00:11:20,690
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to, like, they're kind of, it seemed like they were trying to settle the footprint, like, you know, lock into the footprint, because they were kind of saying, you know, if it's here, well, wherever, you know, and there's another curb cut,

147
00:11:21,638 --> 00:11:26,041
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know if it's totally set in stone, but it seemed like it was pretty close.

148
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:38,792
[SPEAKER_02]: engines are getting in and out of the building yet though, then I don't see how it could be set.

149
00:11:38,913 --> 00:11:45,239
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, I'm curious how much land they have, like to the right.

150
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:53,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there's basically all the way down to that point, like between, um, mystic and union.

151
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,202
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have a flagpole at that point.

152
00:12:00,522 --> 00:12:08,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you guys know where Bulsar Motors is, but right across from there and the filling station.

153
00:12:08,968 --> 00:12:21,656
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were trying to figure out like, is it gonna be more disruptive to traffic, you know, to like have people back in and they're talking about the number of signals and stuff like that.

154
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:33,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and I don't suppose they're having conversation because they're, I think it was at MassDOT or somebody like they've opened up the conversation about that whole intersection coming on South Street.

155
00:12:34,302 --> 00:12:38,143
[SPEAKER_02]: MassDOT definitely going to be involved if they're not already.

156
00:12:38,283 --> 00:12:41,184
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was one of the players they were talking about.

157
00:12:42,624 --> 00:12:48,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if they're thinking about that South Street intersection, then they need to,

158
00:12:49,737 --> 00:12:59,640
[SPEAKER_05]: that, you know, the police and the fire, like that whole situation there, that's an opportunity to bring all of that in, let alone the other, you know, the main street.

159
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:09,248
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, intersection with mystic and it's, it's pretty complicated, you know, the traffic flows in there.

160
00:13:09,308 --> 00:13:12,671
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they were trying to figure out what's the best way to come.

161
00:13:12,991 --> 00:13:26,003
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then there, there's still this, another curb cut up in the air, you know, like this, they want this other curb cut, uh, which will cost them parking spaces and stuff like that.

162
00:13:28,252 --> 00:13:39,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems a little bit like it's not totally gelled yet, but it sounds like they were on a schedule and they needed to make it happen pretty soon.

163
00:13:39,522 --> 00:13:44,907
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, it'll be good when we see those plans, we can provide some comments.

164
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:50,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, does anybody else have any new business?

165
00:13:54,597 --> 00:13:57,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Joan, I see you raise your hand.

166
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I get your name and address for the record, please?

167
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:07,543
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Joan Keene, and I actually live in Acton, but I'm a member of the Medford UU Church.

168
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:16,047
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm here because you had invited me to attend in case you wanted to discuss our CPA application in progress.

169
00:14:17,352 --> 00:14:17,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

170
00:14:18,052 --> 00:14:18,953
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so sorry.

171
00:14:19,073 --> 00:14:20,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I forgot.

172
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,154
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not on the agenda.

173
00:14:22,174 --> 00:14:22,854
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.

174
00:14:22,974 --> 00:14:25,735
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I'm here from you with your invitation.

175
00:14:26,235 --> 00:14:26,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you?

176
00:14:28,636 --> 00:14:30,817
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we help you with?

177
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:35,059
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you need a an explanation of the project?

178
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:36,799
[SPEAKER_00]: The breadth of it?

179
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:37,960
[SPEAKER_00]: The details?

180
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:43,702
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what you had mentioned, perhaps describing the project.

181
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:46,995
[SPEAKER_00]: and being open for any questions anyone might have.

182
00:14:47,075 --> 00:14:49,557
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the information I have.

183
00:14:49,617 --> 00:14:52,019
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how useful it is at this time, but.

184
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:55,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah, why don't you, thank you, and I'm so sorry.

185
00:14:56,122 --> 00:15:05,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you let us, if you could just describe the project and, you know, then with the board here, we can at least kind of chime in.

186
00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:09,211
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're looking for a letter of support, we can talk about that.

187
00:15:09,571 --> 00:15:10,792
[SPEAKER_00]: That's mainly what it is.

188
00:15:10,812 --> 00:15:11,052
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

189
00:15:12,232 --> 00:15:16,456
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably familiar with Liz Ammons from our church.

190
00:15:16,676 --> 00:15:26,824
[SPEAKER_00]: She has spearheaded many previous projects, very instrumental in helping with the big Osgoode House project from 20 to 21.

191
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,206
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a wonderful grant of $132,850.

192
00:15:29,927 --> 00:15:31,508
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically this grant is to re-shingle

193
00:15:40,285 --> 00:15:44,087
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of all the rotted wood on all the surfaces around the building.

194
00:15:44,587 --> 00:15:46,908
[SPEAKER_00]: Some more urgent than others.

195
00:15:47,088 --> 00:15:53,191
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, the ceiling of our portico on the western side is currently held up by chicken wire.

196
00:15:54,032 --> 00:15:55,552
[SPEAKER_00]: The back door is about to fall off.

197
00:15:56,353 --> 00:16:02,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the shingles at base level to be expected are rotted.

198
00:16:02,136 --> 00:16:08,919
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of that has to, the shingles have to be replaced as well as the supporting beams, many of the windows.

199
00:16:09,681 --> 00:16:13,203
[SPEAKER_00]: around the building, half the framing is rotted, that has to be replaced.

200
00:16:13,703 --> 00:16:17,185
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the whole place shingled, the front doors painted, et cetera.

201
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:20,646
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had an estimate of about 80 to 85.

202
00:16:20,686 --> 00:16:28,110
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so is this considered historic preservation?

203
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,150
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that where you're?

204
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:29,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is.

205
00:16:30,251 --> 00:16:33,913
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had we're getting all the documents.

206
00:16:34,013 --> 00:16:36,614
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm new to the congregation and new to all of this.

207
00:16:37,194 --> 00:16:38,735
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very different where I lived before.

208
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:43,607
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know one of the major things was making sure we're in the registry.

209
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:54,070
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Massachusetts Historical Commission did, excuse me, issue us in 75 a document nominating us for the National Register.

210
00:16:54,570 --> 00:17:03,692
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was documentation used for the Osgoode House and two previous CPA grants.

211
00:17:06,452 --> 00:17:07,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Joe, let me jump in here.

212
00:17:07,914 --> 00:17:11,137
[SPEAKER_04]: The, um, I, I serve on the TPC representing the commission.

213
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:11,858
[SPEAKER_04]: So where.

214
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:16,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we're meeting, I think it's tomorrow, um, tonight.

215
00:17:17,344 --> 00:17:20,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but they just announced the schedule for the round, right?

216
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:22,931
[SPEAKER_04]: So it hasn't actually, um.

217
00:17:24,092 --> 00:17:25,193
[SPEAKER_04]: really started yet.

218
00:17:26,153 --> 00:17:28,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing is actually due until the end of this month, I believe.

219
00:17:28,874 --> 00:17:30,295
[SPEAKER_04]: You're well aware of that, I believe.

220
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:35,698
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have all the dates of when the application is due, when the presentations are, and when the deliberations are.

221
00:17:35,718 --> 00:17:36,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that correct?

222
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:37,619
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

223
00:17:37,879 --> 00:17:38,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.

224
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:41,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we've already downloaded the application.

225
00:17:41,741 --> 00:17:43,061
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mainly completed.

226
00:17:43,081 --> 00:17:48,804
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the process, as with Liz, getting the letters of support as required.

227
00:17:50,978 --> 00:17:55,259
[SPEAKER_00]: for the registry documentation, proof of insurance, et cetera.

228
00:17:55,999 --> 00:18:09,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I think because you've received a grant before, a lot of the paperwork should be cut and paste from before, you know, so there's not like a lot of, you have a track record, which I think helps you as well, of a successful project.

229
00:18:10,863 --> 00:18:15,544
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think, you know, I'm sure knowing we all are,

230
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,192
[SPEAKER_04]: broadly familiar with the building, I think.

231
00:18:18,212 --> 00:18:20,954
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's any questions, we can certainly answer that.

232
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:21,254
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

233
00:18:23,497 --> 00:18:27,560
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought this might be superfluous at this point, given the invitation.

234
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,222
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

235
00:18:30,262 --> 00:18:31,943
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we're happy to have you.

236
00:18:32,223 --> 00:18:37,467
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, and this is something that we do for many folks putting in for CPC.

237
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:38,588
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're happy to have you.

238
00:18:39,008 --> 00:18:45,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one question, and I don't know if this is really appropriate, and maybe Ryan and Doug could kind of jump in here.

239
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:51,197
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think with CPC, we're always careful to toe the line of,

240
00:18:52,562 --> 00:18:57,365
[SPEAKER_05]: maintenance versus restoration or historic preservation.

241
00:18:58,046 --> 00:19:03,049
[SPEAKER_05]: So obviously, we want to make sure that this is not considered maintenance.

242
00:19:03,569 --> 00:19:06,191
[SPEAKER_05]: And how is that delineated?

243
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:09,193
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

244
00:19:09,734 --> 00:19:12,576
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.

245
00:19:12,956 --> 00:19:21,802
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say because the structure is 1894, it's prominent right there on High Street as a historic presence.

246
00:19:23,886 --> 00:19:27,288
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's gone beyond just maintenance.

247
00:19:27,588 --> 00:19:31,430
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked through all those documents to try to define it.

248
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:37,254
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's as close as I can tell being new to the project.

249
00:19:37,434 --> 00:19:38,355
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so urgent.

250
00:19:38,435 --> 00:19:44,558
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are things that we cannot fund and are urgent to the integrity of the structure.

251
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:50,482
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past two years, we have spent a fair amount of money for a small congregation.

252
00:19:51,098 --> 00:20:16,249
[SPEAKER_00]: In 23, we did shingle and rot mediation and replacement, especially around the windows, the stained glass windows, which then had plexiglass covers put on, which allowed moisture transfer so it would not impact or exponentially increase future rot.

253
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:17,189
[SPEAKER_00]: That was 16K.

254
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:26,712
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this last year, we mortared all the granite around the church, and that was 22K.

255
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:32,574
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are using funds as best we can to maintain what we can do.

256
00:20:32,974 --> 00:20:46,439
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a sizable project, not only because of the amount, but given the condition of the deterioration, which is some urgency that we cannot fund.

257
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:49,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, Joan, if I could chime in here.

258
00:20:49,533 --> 00:20:56,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a preservation architect who's doing drawings or describing the scope of work for you?

259
00:20:56,778 --> 00:21:02,341
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's a good question that I asked people who have been doing it before.

260
00:21:03,301 --> 00:21:04,362
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not think so.

261
00:21:04,402 --> 00:21:08,204
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a contractor that is familiar that we've been using before.

262
00:21:09,765 --> 00:21:15,108
[SPEAKER_00]: He did work somewhat on the Osgoode House, but not that I know of.

263
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:16,609
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that going to be required?

264
00:21:18,784 --> 00:21:25,026
[SPEAKER_04]: I think to a degree it might be, and I think, Ryan, I think it's probably a good idea because I remember what you had on the Osgoode House.

265
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:38,332
[SPEAKER_04]: You had a preservation architect who understood all the standards at the federal level, and I think to make anything that firm did drawings that showed

266
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:55,220
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't just a contractor's quote because even if the contractor has experience, if they did the Osgoode House, they have qualified experience for historic properties, which is a good thing.

267
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,941
[SPEAKER_04]: But contractors don't typically do drawings.

268
00:21:58,101 --> 00:22:01,863
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have even existing drawings or you can mark up photos,

269
00:22:03,162 --> 00:22:19,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Something physical that talks in the language has to be about restoration, not about maintenance, just the way you presented, I think, is half the deal sometimes in terms of making sure, you know, all restoration at some level can be portrayed as maintenance, but when it's going back to the original.

270
00:22:20,598 --> 00:22:26,939
[SPEAKER_04]: materials and wood and the siding and all that, it's an easier sell.

271
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:37,001
[SPEAKER_04]: There are people on the CPC board who will be, as Jen was, looking pretty hard at that line because we've drawn a pretty bright line between one and the other.

272
00:22:37,261 --> 00:22:41,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you'll be on the right side of that line, but you have to prepare it that way.

273
00:22:42,783 --> 00:22:49,724
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I presented when we, having been in real estate and done historic restoration in different towns, being on the commission,

274
00:22:50,045 --> 00:22:52,686
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all things that I discussed.

275
00:22:52,746 --> 00:23:02,188
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I think this is unlike the Osgoode House, which had the extent of renovation required would impact current codes.

276
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:07,949
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just replacement in kind as was we described to me.

277
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:14,791
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't involve any codes because I know there's hazardous materials issues and

278
00:23:15,124 --> 00:23:20,005
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're doing the extent on the Osgoode House, but we're just doing it in kind.

279
00:23:20,585 --> 00:23:40,128
[SPEAKER_00]: And given that we have been able to do this before, gotten grants to, if you want to define it as maintenance, okay, but at what point do you call it preservation if you're trying to save something?

280
00:23:40,648 --> 00:23:41,789
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

281
00:23:42,069 --> 00:23:44,569
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I was wondering about that too.

282
00:23:45,019 --> 00:23:51,325
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could not find anywhere on the site exactly what would be required.

283
00:23:51,405 --> 00:23:59,012
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the historic documents from wherever, whenever, but I couldn't figure out exactly.

284
00:23:59,032 --> 00:24:02,335
[SPEAKER_00]: I was told it would be simpler than this.

285
00:24:02,715 --> 00:24:10,742
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've gone through everything that we've had on the Osgoode, et cetera, and the thing from the state, and the lawyer had to sign off.

286
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:13,938
[SPEAKER_00]: the preservation restriction agreement.

287
00:24:13,978 --> 00:24:19,401
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through all of that at trying to define what constitutes maintenance versus preservation.

288
00:24:19,421 --> 00:24:25,884
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think you'll need something more than a contractor's quote.

289
00:24:25,904 --> 00:24:29,006
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll need something that describes the scope.

290
00:24:31,267 --> 00:24:36,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Ideally, it's more than photos marked up, but there are ways around it.

291
00:24:36,249 --> 00:24:37,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I think we can

292
00:24:39,188 --> 00:24:44,751
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be worth going back to, I think McKinley-Kausau is no longer a firm.

293
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:50,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he retired, the folks who worked on the building across the street.

294
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:54,735
[SPEAKER_04]: But some of the people who worked on the project, I think, have started their own.

295
00:24:54,995 --> 00:25:05,980
[SPEAKER_04]: You might want to look into that and just maybe buy some of their time to make sure your package just looks like a preservation architect is involved, just because it's more than

296
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,641
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's probably better that it's more than just a contractor.

297
00:25:09,661 --> 00:25:11,921
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the only set of eyes on it, typically.

298
00:25:13,242 --> 00:25:13,562
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

299
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:23,505
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in addition, the contractor we've had that they've used and he's done a lot of historic sites.

300
00:25:24,485 --> 00:25:32,107
[SPEAKER_00]: He was able to draw the permits, understanding the codes or what would be involved, but this is another level that you think is required?

301
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would help your case if there's this is not a code issue.

302
00:25:36,441 --> 00:25:39,264
[SPEAKER_04]: This is you're restoring architectural features of the building.

303
00:25:39,685 --> 00:25:45,711
[SPEAKER_04]: There's virtually no codes that I'm aware of what you described, but it needs to be clear layers.

304
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:46,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.

305
00:25:48,065 --> 00:25:51,226
[SPEAKER_04]: need to be clear to the CPC board what the scope is.

306
00:25:52,247 --> 00:25:55,648
[SPEAKER_04]: That's usually drawings, and photos, and something.

307
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:59,610
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think there's plenty of time to pull this together, I think.

308
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:15,997
[SPEAKER_04]: And it doesn't sound like it will be a huge investment, but I think it might help your application to have, I guess maybe you could work on it and share it with maybe Ryan, and myself, and Peter, and we could give you some feedback.

309
00:26:17,465 --> 00:26:23,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy to do that offline, you know, to make sure that you're heading in the right direction.

310
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:26,112
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look at all the CPC grants, they're all online.

311
00:26:26,132 --> 00:26:30,296
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the type of things that are presented, you know.

312
00:26:31,096 --> 00:26:36,461
[SPEAKER_04]: It's usually a contractor's quote is not enough, but try to see what you can pull together.

313
00:26:36,701 --> 00:26:37,261
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

314
00:26:38,562 --> 00:26:40,604
[SPEAKER_00]: Although we all know what the timeline is.

315
00:26:40,644 --> 00:26:40,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

316
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:41,885
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

317
00:26:41,945 --> 00:26:42,686
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.

318
00:26:43,086 --> 00:26:43,326
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

319
00:26:43,586 --> 00:26:44,888
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will see what we can do.

320
00:26:45,028 --> 00:26:45,248
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

321
00:26:46,878 --> 00:26:48,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and then Ryan, do we need?

322
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:52,483
[SPEAKER_05]: We would need to see all that before we can do a letter of support.

323
00:26:54,284 --> 00:27:01,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you know, just just a basic summary and then some detailed information would be super helpful.

324
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:04,392
[SPEAKER_03]: To see it to get the letter of support rolling.

325
00:27:04,712 --> 00:27:11,958
[SPEAKER_05]: So Joan, when you have that information, if you want to send it to our email, then we can get a letter of support out to you for your application.

326
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:14,160
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that would be for the final.

327
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,241
[SPEAKER_00]: We can still apply.

328
00:27:15,863 --> 00:27:17,844
[SPEAKER_00]: which is through this month, right?

329
00:27:17,904 --> 00:27:27,709
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make an initial application, but to do a total presentation, we need all that documentation with the letters of support.

330
00:27:28,129 --> 00:27:30,951
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives us a little more time, like until September.

331
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:35,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's not going to impact the project determination.

332
00:27:35,913 --> 00:27:41,196
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a, that'll be, you know, you would include your letters of support with the larger project.

333
00:27:41,476 --> 00:27:41,696
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

334
00:27:42,377 --> 00:27:42,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

335
00:27:45,411 --> 00:27:46,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for your time.

336
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:47,172
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.

337
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep us posted and anything we can do to help.

338
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:49,932
[SPEAKER_05]: We're here to help.

339
00:27:49,952 --> 00:27:50,293
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

340
00:27:50,373 --> 00:27:50,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

341
00:27:51,193 --> 00:27:51,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

342
00:27:54,074 --> 00:27:54,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

343
00:27:54,514 --> 00:27:57,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any other new business from the commissioners?

344
00:28:00,076 --> 00:28:00,296
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

345
00:28:00,936 --> 00:28:01,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

346
00:28:01,936 --> 00:28:06,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on to old business properties under demo delay.

347
00:28:06,097 --> 00:28:10,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Ryan, were you guys able to meet with all Mon Street folks yet?

348
00:28:11,243 --> 00:28:11,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Not yet.

349
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:19,965
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I saw Nelson sent over some additional thoughts about his property, so I gotta get back on the train here.

350
00:28:20,085 --> 00:28:21,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Just been swapped with work.

351
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:22,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one was that?

352
00:28:22,946 --> 00:28:24,046
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Pearl Street.

353
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:25,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, OK.

354
00:28:26,467 --> 00:28:28,127
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I connected that that was him.

355
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:29,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew Kathleen was working on that.

356
00:28:29,768 --> 00:28:30,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

357
00:28:31,288 --> 00:28:31,728
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, good.

358
00:28:31,808 --> 00:28:32,088
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

359
00:28:32,108 --> 00:28:36,709
[SPEAKER_05]: So that will, those are kind of in progress.

360
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:39,090
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Wareham, have we heard from them?

361
00:28:40,364 --> 00:28:41,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we did hear from them.

362
00:28:41,685 --> 00:28:47,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I did send comments around to Peter and Doug who made comments that we have to get back to Yale.

363
00:28:47,749 --> 00:28:48,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

364
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:49,250
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

365
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:52,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys want to set up a meeting with them?

366
00:28:53,753 --> 00:28:54,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're far enough along.

367
00:28:57,075 --> 00:28:57,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug and Peter.

368
00:29:00,518 --> 00:29:00,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

369
00:29:00,918 --> 00:29:01,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

370
00:29:01,538 --> 00:29:02,719
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll set up a meeting with them.

371
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

372
00:29:06,142 --> 00:29:06,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

373
00:29:09,102 --> 00:29:14,984
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we don't have, there's nothing on Winchester Street, so that one's probably just gonna ride it out at this point.

374
00:29:15,344 --> 00:29:15,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

375
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:28,127
[SPEAKER_03]: We should, maybe I'll try again, given that the CPC is applying for stuff, maybe I'll try again and say, hey, now's the time to apply.

376
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:33,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that would be a good kind of last effort, I think.

377
00:29:35,837 --> 00:29:36,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, good.

378
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:41,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Permits subcommittee and processes, nothing crazy there.

379
00:29:41,499 --> 00:29:46,921
[SPEAKER_05]: We're sitting to get permits assigned to us again now that I think the building commissioner is settling in.

380
00:29:46,981 --> 00:29:53,863
[SPEAKER_05]: So Ryan and I have been on that and I've sent around a few things for them to look at.

381
00:29:54,203 --> 00:29:56,204
[SPEAKER_05]: We've passed on a couple of things the past week.

382
00:29:56,284 --> 00:29:59,205
[SPEAKER_05]: So I feel like we're in a good rhythm there again.

383
00:29:59,545 --> 00:30:00,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you agree, Ryan?

384
00:30:01,586 --> 00:30:03,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're assigning stuff to us.

385
00:30:03,727 --> 00:30:04,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, which is good.

386
00:30:08,608 --> 00:30:10,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Ryan, any update on the cemetery project?

387
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:13,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have lots of updates.

388
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:23,675
[SPEAKER_03]: After much battling, I finally got City Hall to set up the financial accounts necessary to move the assessment project forward.

389
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:29,818
[SPEAKER_03]: And even though it didn't happen in this fiscal year, I think this following fiscal year will be fine.

390
00:30:30,498 --> 00:30:34,120
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have the contractor, their contract.

391
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:43,984
[SPEAKER_03]: and they will be moving forward with assessing the headstones and doing some excavation work there to document what the headstones are laid in.

392
00:30:44,124 --> 00:30:55,048
[SPEAKER_03]: We suspect that they're laid in a bed of concrete, which will make preservation of the stones infinitely more difficult, but I'm hoping to have something prepared by them

393
00:30:55,928 --> 00:30:59,869
[SPEAKER_03]: relatively soon so that we can apply for CPC funding.

394
00:31:00,049 --> 00:31:14,614
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we miss the round, there's nobody to blame but the city itself for delaying for nearly six and a half months that I've been begging them to create financial accounts to get that project off the board so that I could have everything in place by CPC.

395
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:17,435
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we miss the mark, it'll just delay that project by 365 days.

396
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:21,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing that I can do there.

397
00:31:23,077 --> 00:31:39,165
[SPEAKER_03]: On the other front, I put out to bid today the RFPs for the archaeological fieldwork at the former Cross Street Cemetery site, and for the excavation services, the archaeologists will need an excavator.

398
00:31:41,606 --> 00:31:44,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, we put that out to bid under a separate contract.

399
00:31:44,807 --> 00:31:55,351
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm giving people two and a half, three weeks to put together bids, and as soon as we have those back, if we get something back, we'll award the project accordingly.

400
00:31:55,971 --> 00:31:57,812
[SPEAKER_03]: So that will also be going.

401
00:31:58,312 --> 00:32:10,757
[SPEAKER_03]: That work, if all goes according to schedule, the contract would be signed at the beginning of August, and actual excavation work in the ground would be late August, early September.

402
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:17,236
[SPEAKER_03]: That is to confirm whether the original cemetery site is intact or not.

403
00:32:17,616 --> 00:32:20,497
[SPEAKER_03]: That will impact the development that takes place at Bedford Square.

404
00:32:22,478 --> 00:32:25,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Will they be seeking community volunteers on that one?

405
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I didn't think so.

406
00:32:30,855 --> 00:32:32,717
[SPEAKER_03]: There certainly will be the availability to watch.

407
00:32:33,677 --> 00:32:35,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I certainly will be down there supervising.

408
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:42,283
[SPEAKER_03]: But no public participation on that one because of the sensitivity of it.

409
00:32:42,303 --> 00:32:43,884
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a cemetery.

410
00:32:46,368 --> 00:32:59,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so that's the that's the major project update with those 2. so they are crawling, but I. I put my foot down and said, nothing else will move forward until the cemetery assessment project moves forward.

411
00:32:59,237 --> 00:33:03,420
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that that's moving all these other projects can just kind of roll right along.

412
00:33:05,782 --> 00:33:07,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you for all your work on that.

413
00:33:07,803 --> 00:33:07,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

414
00:33:08,844 --> 00:33:09,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry.

415
00:33:09,124 --> 00:33:09,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I got more good.

416
00:33:11,841 --> 00:33:12,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep going.

417
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:20,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, so I guess I'll roll right into Thomas Brooks Park is sort of on hold until I get those other two projects off the board.

418
00:33:21,364 --> 00:33:32,788
[SPEAKER_03]: But as soon as those happen, I would like to meet with the city department heads to get specifications together for preparation for bidding the.

419
00:33:34,188 --> 00:33:36,349
[SPEAKER_03]: the various projects on that front.

420
00:33:36,409 --> 00:33:42,551
[SPEAKER_03]: There'll be the archeology work and tree work and the sidewalks, crossings, et cetera.

421
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:45,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I will need help with that.

422
00:33:46,773 --> 00:33:47,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug, I saw your hand raised.

423
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:50,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, go ahead, Doug.

424
00:33:50,474 --> 00:33:52,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Ryan.

425
00:33:53,276 --> 00:34:01,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I've noticed much like the Brooks Estate stone wall that you guys just built along Thomas Brooks Park is being devoured by neighbors.

426
00:34:03,269 --> 00:34:08,313
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've tried to attack it on our own, but we think it's not really sustainable.

427
00:34:08,893 --> 00:34:13,937
[SPEAKER_04]: So we feel we need to come up with either DPW or a city landscape.

428
00:34:15,058 --> 00:34:16,119
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a couple of different ways.

429
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:22,564
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Zach mentioned something to you and I, Jen, about this.

430
00:34:23,244 --> 00:34:28,789
[SPEAKER_04]: He talked about the park grounds, the landscaping contract, or the DPW as two potential

431
00:34:30,029 --> 00:34:36,191
[SPEAKER_04]: City agencies who could do a quarterly and maintain that wall, because if we don't do it, like, all that works going to be.

432
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:37,751
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't take long.

433
00:34:37,971 --> 00:34:41,312
[SPEAKER_04]: We've 2, some 2 winners and 2 summers and.

434
00:34:42,592 --> 00:34:51,875
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a 1000 feet of the road street wall on the Brooks estate is is was was really starting to get covered with some trees and binds and and weeds and.

435
00:34:53,317 --> 00:34:54,758
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of work and you know that.

436
00:34:55,339 --> 00:35:02,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And since we're obviously setting this up to make sure we well maintained, I think the solution for one is the solution for the other.

437
00:35:04,848 --> 00:35:05,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think.

438
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:15,679
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's a little crazy that Thomas Brooks Park wall hasn't been at least weed whacked because they go in there to cut the grass in the green space.

439
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:19,443
[SPEAKER_05]: So I actually been meaning to email.

440
00:35:19,463 --> 00:35:24,505
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to shoot an email to like Teresa and be like, hey, can somebody like put in?

441
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:30,487
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we have to put in C click fix or something to just be like somebody needs to get over there and trim it.

442
00:35:31,908 --> 00:35:33,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, agreed.

443
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:43,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi Jen, yeah, maybe we should do that and reach out to the DPW director and say, you know, hey, we CPC funded this project we spent.

444
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,662
[SPEAKER_03]: $300,000 and had a lot of expertise to do it.

445
00:35:48,702 --> 00:35:50,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we just need to maintain it.

446
00:35:51,443 --> 00:35:56,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been by to look at it, but I'm assuming that it's a lot of grass and that's some invasions.

447
00:35:57,627 --> 00:35:58,607
[SPEAKER_05]: It's bad.

448
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:00,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the stuff is taller than the wall, the growth.

449
00:36:00,728 --> 00:36:01,008
[SPEAKER_05]: It's insane.

450
00:36:01,028 --> 00:36:01,869
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more than grass.

451
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:02,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

452
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:03,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

453
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:06,311
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of weeds and just random.

454
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,012
[SPEAKER_04]: It's shrubs and weeds.

455
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:08,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

456
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:08,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

457
00:36:10,313 --> 00:36:10,754
[SPEAKER_04]: And trees.

458
00:36:11,614 --> 00:36:11,974
[SPEAKER_03]: And trees.

459
00:36:12,034 --> 00:36:13,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the trees are going to come back.

460
00:36:14,428 --> 00:36:20,751
[SPEAKER_05]: They are.

461
00:36:21,851 --> 00:36:28,654
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll draft an email, Ryan, but I think we should draft it and say, if you're doing one, you got to do both.

462
00:36:28,814 --> 00:36:29,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

463
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:34,096
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Thomas Brooks Park wall and it's the Grove Street wall at the Brooks Estate.

464
00:36:35,397 --> 00:36:37,698
[SPEAKER_05]: They put them on your maintenance schedule.

465
00:36:38,178 --> 00:36:38,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

466
00:36:38,818 --> 00:36:40,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Because technically, the Brooks Estate is city land.

467
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:41,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

468
00:36:42,272 --> 00:36:46,721
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, you know, it's not just because it's managed by Ambel doesn't mean the city can abandon it.

469
00:36:48,845 --> 00:36:49,567
[SPEAKER_04]: I beg to differ.

470
00:36:49,627 --> 00:36:50,308
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they think.

471
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of the Brooks Estate, our picnic is Saturday.

472
00:36:56,601 --> 00:37:01,082
[SPEAKER_05]: So anybody, we would love to have you all from 12 to 3.

473
00:37:02,082 --> 00:37:05,043
[SPEAKER_05]: You can meet our new president, Carly Nessen, who's amazing.

474
00:37:05,063 --> 00:37:07,303
[SPEAKER_05]: We have live music.

475
00:37:07,343 --> 00:37:08,224
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have raffles.

476
00:37:08,284 --> 00:37:09,124
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have food.

477
00:37:09,524 --> 00:37:12,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you to Wegmans for your generous donation.

478
00:37:12,725 --> 00:37:15,085
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fingers crossed for good weather.

479
00:37:15,645 --> 00:37:16,546
[SPEAKER_05]: We have games.

480
00:37:16,626 --> 00:37:17,706
[SPEAKER_05]: I have yard games.

481
00:37:18,686 --> 00:37:21,947
[SPEAKER_05]: So please come hang out with us and have a hot dog at least.

482
00:37:23,265 --> 00:37:25,106
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be driving the shuttle up and down the road.

483
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:32,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else on Thomas Brooks Park?

484
00:37:33,648 --> 00:37:41,511
[SPEAKER_03]: We sent around the archaeological cap to city department heads, and I will hound Teresa tomorrow to see if there's any other feedback.

485
00:37:41,931 --> 00:37:47,493
[SPEAKER_03]: We should set up a meeting to go public with that proposed project to get public feedback.

486
00:37:48,393 --> 00:38:03,323
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can let people know that the sidewalks and crossings and all the things that they've been clamoring for are actually coming now that the CPC has awarded the project and that if there's anything else that they would like us to see in the future, that now would be the time to tell us.

487
00:38:04,623 --> 00:38:08,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Should we plan that meeting for September after the summer?

488
00:38:10,917 --> 00:38:15,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sure, just so we don't get accused of burying it in the summer schedule.

489
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:16,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

490
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:17,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

491
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:17,900
[SPEAKER_03]: It can't hurt.

492
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:28,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I just Peter's under contract and he's not going to want to stay under contract forever, but maybe that will be the end of his public meeting.

493
00:38:28,844 --> 00:38:30,825
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he does final revisions and then he's done.

494
00:38:30,845 --> 00:38:34,647
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we basically incorporate that as a supplement to the master plan.

495
00:38:36,576 --> 00:38:37,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm just throwing it out there.

496
00:38:37,837 --> 00:38:41,559
[SPEAKER_05]: If we think we want to do it in August or pick a date, you know.

497
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,641
[SPEAKER_05]: But we need to do.

498
00:38:43,781 --> 00:38:45,562
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to probably have at least 30 days notice.

499
00:38:46,022 --> 00:38:46,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.

500
00:38:46,803 --> 00:38:48,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

501
00:38:48,304 --> 00:38:50,085
[SPEAKER_03]: At that point we're in August, so we might as well.

502
00:38:50,345 --> 00:38:52,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Might as well throw it out there for September and get it on the radar.

503
00:38:52,707 --> 00:38:54,968
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we can get neighborhood.

504
00:38:54,988 --> 00:38:57,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was going to say, can we ask?

505
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:11,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we get a, you know, I always want to say Captain Barry, even though it's not Captain Barry anymore, like Captain Barry call and get, you know, I would love some sort of mailing to go to at least the immediate neighbors.

506
00:39:13,847 --> 00:39:14,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that possible?

507
00:39:15,348 --> 00:39:16,709
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we can see what we can do.

508
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:26,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there'd be no reason why we wouldn't be able to do something similar to like a zoning board meeting where you just plug in an address and then get everybody within 300 feet and you do a mailing.

509
00:39:27,014 --> 00:39:29,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, or maybe we can grab a water bill that's coming.

510
00:39:29,896 --> 00:39:33,758
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what the water bill schedule is, but maybe we can do an insert with the water bills.

511
00:39:35,803 --> 00:39:36,623
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly don't know.

512
00:39:36,643 --> 00:39:40,706
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had my meter replaced, so I got a sizable credit back.

513
00:39:40,806 --> 00:39:43,728
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't get a water bill right now.

514
00:39:44,368 --> 00:39:45,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I got one of those cards, too.

515
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:46,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

516
00:39:48,631 --> 00:39:49,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll work with Dennis on that.

517
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,473
[SPEAKER_05]: So Jen, with the water bill.

518
00:39:51,793 --> 00:39:52,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

519
00:39:52,174 --> 00:39:52,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Dennis.

520
00:39:52,754 --> 00:39:53,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

521
00:39:53,054 --> 00:39:53,895
[SPEAKER_01]: Jen, with the water bill.

522
00:39:56,536 --> 00:40:00,159
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do it, but it has to be, A, there's a cost involved.

523
00:40:02,002 --> 00:40:05,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we don't, the water bills are not drafted out to send out.

524
00:40:06,063 --> 00:40:07,724
[SPEAKER_01]: And it only goes to the people who get paper bills.

525
00:40:08,064 --> 00:40:13,546
[SPEAKER_01]: So it actually is sort of limiting who gets a lot of these notices if you do it like that.

526
00:40:14,086 --> 00:40:15,747
[SPEAKER_01]: I would actually say what Ryan would have said,

527
00:40:16,982 --> 00:40:20,707
[SPEAKER_01]: we can get address labels like pretty easily.

528
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:26,635
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just basically grab a point and then just go everyone within this radius, get them all.

529
00:40:26,655 --> 00:40:30,680
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have plenty of interns in our office this summer.

530
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,424
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to send stuff out, if you want to just

531
00:40:34,305 --> 00:40:41,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Give us something and if you have, you know, envelopes or whatever you have, just give it to us and we can do everything and mail them out from City Hall that day.

532
00:40:41,329 --> 00:40:44,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, it's OK.

533
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:49,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the sounds of it is that we should take advantage of the fact that they have interned.

534
00:40:49,554 --> 00:40:50,995
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's set up a meeting.

535
00:40:51,396 --> 00:40:54,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's take a date and then we can at least prep the mailing.

536
00:40:54,438 --> 00:40:56,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, and then get it out.

537
00:40:57,019 --> 00:40:57,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk to Peter.

538
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, let me talk to him tomorrow morning.

539
00:41:01,982 --> 00:41:03,683
[SPEAKER_05]: OK and see what his availability is.

540
00:41:03,703 --> 00:41:04,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

541
00:41:05,523 --> 00:41:09,265
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, are we going to do it on zoom or we're going to do it in person or hybrid?

542
00:41:09,285 --> 00:41:10,085
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do.

543
00:41:10,225 --> 00:41:11,445
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do a hybrid meeting.

544
00:41:11,585 --> 00:41:18,548
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do a meeting likely at either the West Medford Community Center or City Hall.

545
00:41:19,068 --> 00:41:25,650
[SPEAKER_03]: City Hall is probably more primed for it, cause they've got the owl and yeah, I don't know the West.

546
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:26,651
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know even know.

547
00:41:26,891 --> 00:41:30,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know the West Medford Community Center has Wi-Fi, but I don't know how.

548
00:41:30,972 --> 00:41:32,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know how reliable it is.

549
00:41:33,173 --> 00:41:38,195
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dennis, maybe we can have somebody there from staff to help run the digital component of the meeting.

550
00:41:42,976 --> 00:41:45,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let's get some availability from here.

551
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:46,938
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we can schedule that.

552
00:41:46,958 --> 00:41:50,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know you don't have a date?

553
00:41:50,259 --> 00:41:57,182
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get some options, Dennis, because we obviously have to check the city calendar to see what is available and rooms and all that stuff.

554
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:02,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

555
00:42:06,197 --> 00:42:07,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else, Ryan?

556
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:10,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Not for Thomas Burke Park.

557
00:42:11,145 --> 00:42:13,666
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, well what it roll into the next one.

558
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:15,766
[SPEAKER_03]: So Fulton Heights is done.

559
00:42:15,786 --> 00:42:21,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just waiting for the contractor to finish the final report for the entire neighborhood.

560
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:28,369
[SPEAKER_03]: We got 20 forms which cover 165 buildings in Fulton Heights.

561
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:31,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Give a broad overview of the neighborhood.

562
00:42:31,869 --> 00:42:38,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of organic little tiny cottages and a little bit of information about the little commercial district that they have and.

563
00:42:39,731 --> 00:42:49,804
[SPEAKER_03]: The only unresolved question that nobody seems to be able to answer, not even the historians that are in the city, is who Car Park is named after.

564
00:42:50,745 --> 00:42:57,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Supposedly it's Dutch Car, but obviously Doug Car.

565
00:42:57,253 --> 00:42:57,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

566
00:43:00,147 --> 00:43:12,917
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's no plaque, there's no dedication in the newspapers, there's no information whatsoever other than his name appearing on a city map from like 1955.

567
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:18,879
[SPEAKER_03]: So the park was bought relatively late.

568
00:43:18,899 --> 00:43:23,080
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a failed residential subdivision that the city snatched up.

569
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:26,181
[SPEAKER_03]: And they got it in 1939.

570
00:43:26,361 --> 00:43:29,761
[SPEAKER_03]: So it took it by eminent domain.

571
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:32,442
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's one of the really early uses of eminent domain.

572
00:43:33,062 --> 00:43:35,883
[SPEAKER_03]: And they must have decided that they would have a

573
00:43:36,773 --> 00:43:39,454
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you need a good lake location for open space.

574
00:43:39,654 --> 00:43:44,076
[SPEAKER_03]: So, because the aerial view show by 45, there's definitely a park there.

575
00:43:44,096 --> 00:43:44,916
[SPEAKER_03]: There's ball fields.

576
00:43:45,737 --> 00:43:52,640
[SPEAKER_03]: So... Is there some old map on which it's marked car park with one R?

577
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:56,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Car park.

578
00:43:57,222 --> 00:43:57,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Auto park.

579
00:43:57,682 --> 00:43:58,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it was an auto park.

580
00:43:58,542 --> 00:43:59,823
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been a car park.

581
00:44:00,023 --> 00:44:01,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

582
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Could have been a... be cool if it was a...

583
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:17,924
[SPEAKER_03]: like a movie theater, drive-in movie theater, that would be unusual for its location, but you know, knowing Fulton Heights, all those houses were built in the 10s, 20s, and 30s, so every house probably had a car.

584
00:44:21,845 --> 00:44:22,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

585
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:23,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

586
00:44:24,066 --> 00:44:27,528
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do not have a survey project for this

587
00:44:28,242 --> 00:44:30,482
[SPEAKER_05]: current fiscal year that we're in?

588
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:40,244
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have a MHC survey project, but we will absolutely be moving forward with a survey project for the using our city budget match that MHC.

589
00:44:41,384 --> 00:44:54,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Mass historical usually has extra funding, so we're going to poke them because we're certified local government community and see if they have extra funding that they have to expend to

590
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:00,657
[SPEAKER_03]: to be able to help make that project go further.

591
00:45:00,737 --> 00:45:07,139
[SPEAKER_03]: But even if we don't get a matching grant from them, it just allows us to move forward with our own survey.

592
00:45:07,399 --> 00:45:15,321
[SPEAKER_03]: We can pick a small neighborhood, and it will probably cover 35, 40 buildings, something like that.

593
00:45:15,361 --> 00:45:17,661
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a sizable amount of buildings.

594
00:45:19,442 --> 00:45:19,962
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, great.

595
00:45:20,462 --> 00:45:20,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

596
00:45:24,233 --> 00:45:24,954
[SPEAKER_05]: You have anything else?

597
00:45:25,274 --> 00:45:30,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, so I'm working on the paperwork for the certified local government program.

598
00:45:30,597 --> 00:45:38,843
[SPEAKER_03]: So because the fiscal year ended, CLG paperwork is due in September so that that rolled into a couple of different things.

599
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:47,509
[SPEAKER_03]: So while doing my analysis of the CLG, it came to my attention that the Medford Historic District Commission has not received a single application for.

600
00:45:49,865 --> 00:45:52,726
[SPEAKER_03]: for review for building permits.

601
00:45:52,806 --> 00:45:58,648
[SPEAKER_03]: They get permits, they review permits and are supposed to approve certificates for work in the district.

602
00:45:58,688 --> 00:46:03,709
[SPEAKER_03]: And I find it nearly impossible that no work in the district has taken place in 365 days.

603
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:16,257
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've planned on bringing that to the attention of the mayor's office to start a dialogue with the building department about making sure that they are back in the loop with building permits.

604
00:46:16,317 --> 00:46:19,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, originally the building department would send them to the board.

605
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:23,542
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's a much more in-person process.

606
00:46:23,602 --> 00:46:24,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's all digital.

607
00:46:24,642 --> 00:46:26,964
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to make sure that they are not forgotten in the loop.

608
00:46:28,065 --> 00:46:28,225
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

609
00:46:29,733 --> 00:46:33,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I've also you could do some spot checks in the permitting system.

610
00:46:33,894 --> 00:46:47,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think yeah, I think I'm likely to find some things that have been, you know, I think there's a there's a there's kind of a. Gap in my opinion, I feel like the way the permitting system is.

611
00:46:49,058 --> 00:46:49,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you should.

612
00:46:51,959 --> 00:46:55,920
[SPEAKER_05]: The the property addresses should already be tagged that they're in a district.

613
00:46:57,009 --> 00:46:57,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

614
00:46:57,490 --> 00:46:58,191
[SPEAKER_05]: And anything.

615
00:46:59,232 --> 00:47:02,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, there's a little bit of a, I feel like technology could help us.

616
00:47:02,996 --> 00:47:15,370
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if it's set up to, but that the assessor's office has to talk to the building department has to talk to and have, you know, all the every house in the district kind of flagged, but I don't know that it works that way.

617
00:47:16,623 --> 00:47:25,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm not really sure GIS can mark them, so I don't know how much effort's using GIS, but certainly we can, you know, plug in all the inventory forms.

618
00:47:25,727 --> 00:47:37,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it came up for discussion during the survey and planning project this year because they have to create maps that show the locations of the buildings, and we chose to omit that this year because it really just is a

619
00:47:38,753 --> 00:47:43,577
[SPEAKER_03]: thing that sits in the shelf on the file, never used.

620
00:47:43,657 --> 00:47:55,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's gone to GIS, so there's no reason why we can't tag buildings in GIS and just create a digital map that shows not only the projects as they're adding them, but all the existing inventory forms of what's been surveyed.

621
00:47:55,907 --> 00:47:59,210
[SPEAKER_02]: How did they get flagged previously?

622
00:48:00,727 --> 00:48:06,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the building department had in their office the two maps of the district, so they just knew.

623
00:48:07,172 --> 00:48:17,018
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, with the districts moving around, and you know, it's the same general two people, Paul Mokie and John Bavuso, who used to just handle what passed down permits.

624
00:48:17,219 --> 00:48:22,462
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I think just making sure that Scott knows that there is.

625
00:48:22,502 --> 00:48:28,927
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are some new inspectors, like, I mean, there's just people there that don't have the legacy that John and Paul Mokie had.

626
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:29,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

627
00:48:29,887 --> 00:48:30,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

628
00:48:30,147 --> 00:48:31,548
[SPEAKER_03]: So just making sure.

629
00:48:31,568 --> 00:48:31,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Not their fault.

630
00:48:32,448 --> 00:48:33,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

631
00:48:33,249 --> 00:48:35,409
[SPEAKER_03]: We just make sure that we come bring them back up.

632
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:56,118
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and one of the things that I'm talking with the, well, would like to talk to the HTC about is making sure that they notify their residents to make sure that they know that they are the resource available to them to help them with their projects and that they should apply to them first before even going to the building department just to prevent delay in their process.

633
00:49:00,405 --> 00:49:07,652
[SPEAKER_03]: I have heard that they're in the process of, and I don't know where it is in the process, creating a South Street historic district.

634
00:49:07,692 --> 00:49:11,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard it went, it may have gotten on the floor of city council.

635
00:49:11,535 --> 00:49:12,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not exactly sure.

636
00:49:13,457 --> 00:49:18,381
[SPEAKER_03]: But the HTC is only met twice, once in January, once in February, to the best of my knowledge.

637
00:49:18,501 --> 00:49:22,044
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have been out of the loop.

638
00:49:24,583 --> 00:49:25,363
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy.

639
00:49:25,724 --> 00:49:34,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I spoke to Sharon Guzik about it briefly, just ran into her and she seemed frustrated.

640
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:38,291
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think much has happened.

641
00:49:41,233 --> 00:49:44,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think, you know, I think that

642
00:49:45,835 --> 00:49:53,977
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the lack of movement from that board will get some attention in the coming weeks, certainly.

643
00:49:54,557 --> 00:49:56,938
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see what happens.

644
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:07,840
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, with all the stuff that's happening with city council, politically, it may not have been a good time to bring it to the table at that point, so.

645
00:50:09,761 --> 00:50:09,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

646
00:50:12,842 --> 00:50:13,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis, do you know anything?

647
00:50:16,534 --> 00:50:20,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really, I haven't been staffing them in a while, so.

648
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:21,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

649
00:50:23,297 --> 00:50:26,679
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm pretty sure they're scheduled to meet this Thursday.

650
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,861
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what it is.

651
00:50:29,881 --> 00:50:33,863
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be up on the city's calendar, at least what their agenda is, but I don't know what it is.

652
00:50:36,064 --> 00:50:36,784
[SPEAKER_05]: We will check it out.

653
00:50:36,804 --> 00:50:39,745
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I'll take a look.

654
00:50:48,672 --> 00:50:53,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anybody have anything else before we wrap it up with meeting minutes?

655
00:50:57,734 --> 00:50:58,534
[SPEAKER_05]: No, okay.

656
00:50:58,814 --> 00:51:03,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter did circulate the meeting minutes, so I can take a motion when someone's ready.

657
00:51:03,555 --> 00:51:05,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve.

658
00:51:07,176 --> 00:51:07,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ryan.

659
00:51:09,657 --> 00:51:10,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Doug.

661
00:51:12,762 --> 00:51:17,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, motion to approve the meeting minutes from June 2024.

662
00:51:17,604 --> 00:51:22,446
[SPEAKER_05]: I will go around for a roll call vote as I see people on my screen.

663
00:51:22,467 --> 00:51:23,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Doug?

664

[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, motion passes 5-0.

674
00:51:39,277 --> 00:51:41,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anybody have anything else before we wrap up?

675
00:51:45,179 --> 00:51:45,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Move to adjourn.

676
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:46,740
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

677
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:47,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to adjourn, 753.

678
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,302
