[SPEAKER_06]: We also have a budget meeting tomorrow night with several more departments, and we'll be having further meetings over the next couple of weeks.

24
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:11,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Just as a reminder to everyone about the budget schedule, we are following the new budget ordinance, which is soon to be finalized.

25
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:17,899
[SPEAKER_06]: It is actually up for third reading tonight at the City Council regular meeting at 7 o'clock.

[SPEAKER_06]: for consideration by the council.

28
00:01:28,826 --> 00:01:34,107
[SPEAKER_06]: By Friday, March 22nd, 2024, the council will go to submit a collective budget recommendation to the mayor.

29
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:35,407
[SPEAKER_06]: That has all happened.

30
00:01:36,568 --> 00:01:38,208
[SPEAKER_06]: We did receive a response from the mayor.

31
00:01:38,788 --> 00:01:44,410
[SPEAKER_06]: From April 15th, 2024 to May 15th, 2024, we'll be holding preliminary budget meetings with our department heads.

32
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:49,351
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what this meeting is, and we have had two already, and we'll have several ahead of us.

33
00:01:50,231 --> 00:01:55,753
[SPEAKER_06]: And then by Friday, May 31st, the mayor will submit the budget to the city council for final consideration.

34
00:01:56,585 --> 00:02:00,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so far at the meetings, we've been hearing from our department budgets.

35
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:07,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we did also last week here from the finance director who did give a presentation on the revenue projection for the fiscal year.

36
00:02:07,592 --> 00:02:15,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but as I said, we are hearing from departments tonight and generally I've been asking four questions to every department.

37
00:02:16,038 --> 00:02:19,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, just, you know, what was your budget requests and what, what does it consist of?

38
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:25,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, was there anything that was not requested this year that your department might be looking for in future budgets?

39
00:02:27,706 --> 00:02:35,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you can share anything you'd like to share about your department narrative, the work you've done over the past year, or what you're planning to do over the next year.

40
00:02:36,054 --> 00:02:39,257
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'll just remind everyone that after the formal budget is submitted,

41
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:45,904
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm guessing, given the budgets we're seeing tonight, that there won't be much change between tonight and what ends up being submitted at the end of May.

42
00:02:46,364 --> 00:02:55,408
[SPEAKER_06]: But if there is some change that either we wanted to ask a question about, or if the administration wants to have you come back, we may invite you back in June.

43
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:57,249
[SPEAKER_06]: But we may not.

44
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:08,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, if you guys would like to be invited back, if there's something you don't have tonight, like a narrative or some project you want to talk about, we do want to give everyone the opportunity to share what their department is doing.

45
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:13,216
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's basically how the process has been working this year.

46
00:03:13,256 --> 00:03:27,240
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit new, but with that, I'm happy to take, unless the Madam Chief of Staff will take the Recreation Department, and we will hear from our director, Kevin Bailey.

47
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:33,922
[SPEAKER_06]: We have, as far as I can tell from here, we have the Recreation Department.

48
00:03:35,122 --> 00:03:37,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Top to the bottom line budget for the general fund is

49
00:03:38,801 --> 00:04:05,270
[SPEAKER_06]: 312,685, and that includes the permanent employees, the part-time employees, and basically the only change here is there's been a somewhat small increase in the pay for the employees, and there was a slight reduction in the sick leave incentive and the stipends, and that the total change in the budget

50
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:12,798
[SPEAKER_06]: is $8,850 and that is all fixed cost growth he raises for non-unit employees.

51
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:13,399
[SPEAKER_06]: So with that,

52
00:04:15,074 --> 00:04:27,676
[SPEAKER_06]: I will go to you, Kevin, if you want to say what your request entails, if there's anything that you may want in the future that we're not requesting this year, and then share a little bit about what your department's been up to and what you plan to do over the next year.

53
00:04:27,956 --> 00:04:28,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect, yeah.

54
00:04:28,496 --> 00:04:32,017
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have a budget narrative that I will present in just a few minutes.

55
00:04:33,377 --> 00:04:39,018
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think a lot of the questions you, a lot of the information you just gave about what our summary is for the FY25 budget will be.

56
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:51,385
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as requests, the only thing that we did request, like many other departments, is asking for another staff member for our department.

57
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:54,468
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we are a growing department.

58
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:57,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Every year we are becoming larger and larger.

59
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,131
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the

60
00:05:00,424 --> 00:05:11,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Different responsibilities and facilities that our recreation department has been given over the years really warrants us to become a larger recreation department.

61
00:05:11,738 --> 00:05:18,827
[SPEAKER_03]: When we first started seven years ago, we were really a small, small rec department with only a director and assistant director.

62
00:05:19,608 --> 00:05:25,174
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the expectation was us to really just run programs and to operate the pond and the pool in the summer.

63
00:05:25,695 --> 00:05:32,743
[SPEAKER_03]: As you know, looking back at seven years from now, not only do we have the pond and pool, but we also have the recreation center with the gym.

64
00:05:33,164 --> 00:05:34,545
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot more programs.

65
00:05:35,727 --> 00:05:37,789
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition to that, we are running a summer camp.

66
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:45,512
[SPEAKER_03]: and we have Hormel Stadium, we have Laconia Rank, we have the Cotton Shell, so we are continuously growing.

67
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:55,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Comparing us with other state recreation departments, I think it's more than fair to say that we should have more than four full-time staff members.

68
00:05:56,536 --> 00:06:02,738
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the requests that I have been looking at and talking about through our department

69
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:05,199
[SPEAKER_03]: is to have a office manager.

70
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:29,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Thinking about what we can get for basically the biggest bang for your buck, if we can get an office manager to be at the recreation center doing the office hours, answering the phone, helping us get ready to pay bills and to help get our payroll ready and reconciled for either myself or our assistant director to sign off, would be the best help to the department.

71
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:57,650
[SPEAKER_03]: really what we're seeing is myself and our assistant director is bogged down with phone calls emails trying to keep up with that but also just being in the office and doing a lot of administrative work that if we can get someone to kind of take some of that workload off of our plate it allows us to be out more at the facilities and to be running some of the uh higher programs that is either difficult to find a perfect example of that i keep on getting emails to run babysitter training classes and it's

72
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:03,512
[SPEAKER_03]: something that I'm certified, I can teach, I can run it, but I just can't find the time to do it.

73
00:07:03,532 --> 00:07:22,218
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I find myself a lot working on the weekends and stuff playing catch-up with administrative duties, so that was our request, but as I said, it's a request that every other city department is also requesting for staff, so it's understandable, but I think that would be a huge help to the recreation department.

74
00:07:22,998 --> 00:07:28,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing to add is we have been trying to use part time staff for that, which has been very helpful.

75
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:36,814
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is a lot of training on how to request a purchase order to have me sign it, or whether it's to fill in park permits and how to use our operating system.

76
00:07:37,503 --> 00:07:49,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Part-time staff is very helpful, but the reality is when we're working with usually college students, by the time we teach them how to do the software and they're able to do a lot of this stuff on their own, they're graduating and they're getting a full-time job.

77
00:07:50,014 --> 00:07:53,077
[SPEAKER_03]: So having someone that's consistent in that role will be helpful.

78
00:07:53,977 --> 00:07:56,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, and I just want to recognize that Councilor Tseng is with us on Zoom.

79
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Callahan has joined us.

80
00:07:58,021 --> 00:07:58,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

81
00:08:02,585 --> 00:08:04,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, Councilor Scrivella.

82
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:05,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

83
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,152
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't care.

84
00:08:06,892 --> 00:08:10,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a budget summary, but if you want, do you want me to go through it first and then okay.

85
00:08:10,935 --> 00:08:18,800
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do have just kind of an update about our where our department is kind of standing where we do each year but a little bit more detail this year.

86
00:08:19,261 --> 00:08:25,285
[SPEAKER_03]: But as we are moving into our seventh round, our seventh year as a full time recreation department.

87
00:08:26,226 --> 00:08:30,629
[SPEAKER_03]: This year really faced some real challenges and our biggest one.

88
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:35,654
[SPEAKER_03]: was having two of our employees on extended time off.

89
00:08:36,034 --> 00:08:39,478
[SPEAKER_03]: That led to our program manager position that was eventually opened up.

90
00:08:40,178 --> 00:08:49,047
[SPEAKER_03]: And after about eight months without having an employee able to perform that role, we were able to hire Krista DeVoe, who is our new program manager.

91
00:08:49,868 --> 00:08:56,990
[SPEAKER_03]: She was just hired at the beginning of April, so she's only been with us for a few weeks, but she does have a background in program management.

92
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:11,775
[SPEAKER_03]: She has worked for various towns around the country, so she has a lot of experience in program management, but she also holds her master's degree in therapeutic recreation and also holds a director certification from the American Camping Association.

93
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,856
[SPEAKER_03]: We were amazed during the hiring process.

94
00:09:15,896 --> 00:09:18,677
[SPEAKER_03]: She really checked off almost everything that we were looking for.

95
00:09:18,877 --> 00:09:23,378
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are expecting great things already just in a few weeks.

96
00:09:24,258 --> 00:09:32,960
[SPEAKER_03]: After school vacation, I met with her and she has tons of different program ideas and really been evaluating the programs where they're currently at.

97
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:34,683
[SPEAKER_03]: and ways that we can improve it.

98
00:09:34,743 --> 00:09:42,396
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are really looking forward for the next couple of months, things to be coming out program-wise.

99
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:57,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, even though we were really short staff and our main goal for this year was really just to maintain the level of programs and services that our department has been running, uh, even being short staff and working off of a skeleton crew.

100
00:09:57,023 --> 00:10:06,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, even though we were short, we do have a lot of different achievements that I would say would move the department in a forward direction for the future.

101
00:10:07,192 --> 00:10:13,633
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's three different things that I do want to highlight for achievements that were part of our goals in FY24.

102
00:10:14,094 --> 00:10:19,415
[SPEAKER_03]: The first and foremost, one of the biggest and exciting things for me is the Friends of Method Recreation.

103
00:10:20,175 --> 00:10:35,218
[SPEAKER_03]: For Councilors who have been in this role for a couple of years, you know we keep on rolling this over year after year because it is a challenge to get a board together and to establish the 501c, but we do have that board and we were able to submit

104
00:10:35,638 --> 00:10:39,961
[SPEAKER_03]: our bylaws and our information to the IRS and are waiting for approval.

105
00:10:40,481 --> 00:10:53,109
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do have to thank our board members, Brett Hauser, Kate Yenrick, Heather Boudette, and Amanda O'Leary are our initial board members right now to kind of help get this stuff established and get it operational.

106
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Already this year, we were able to raise over $700 in scholarship funding.

107
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:06,117
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we also have done other things, such as last summer, if you remember, we accepted 50 life jackets from the Method Kiwanis.

108
00:11:06,818 --> 00:11:08,860
[SPEAKER_03]: The life jackets were used for both the pond and the pool.

109
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,403
[SPEAKER_03]: This year, they donated an additional 50.

110
00:11:13,064 --> 00:11:15,946
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have new life jackets for the pond and pool, which is great.

111
00:11:15,986 --> 00:11:19,129
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was all through the Friends of Method Recreation.

112
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,674
[SPEAKER_03]: This spring, we've been able to start using our financial aid and our scholarships.

113
00:11:24,115 --> 00:11:35,488
[SPEAKER_03]: So far to date, we've given over $682 in financial aid, and the majority of that was starting this spring with our new financial aid process.

114
00:11:36,394 --> 00:11:39,816
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was one of our large, what I consider a win.

115
00:11:40,796 --> 00:11:48,600
[SPEAKER_03]: The second one that we were working on is working towards making our communication to the public in different languages that represent the city.

116
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:51,922
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a lot of help with the Method Connectors team.

117
00:11:52,622 --> 00:11:54,903
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that, we were able to get language writers.

118
00:11:55,324 --> 00:11:56,064
[SPEAKER_03]: We have two of them.

119
00:11:57,325 --> 00:12:00,386
[SPEAKER_03]: During the summertime, they were both at the pond and the other one was at the pool.

120
00:12:00,966 --> 00:12:05,949
[SPEAKER_03]: And then during the academic year, one was at the recreation center and the hockey rink.

121
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:12,992
[SPEAKER_03]: and that really just helps our frontline staff if somebody comes in with a language barrier to have a tool to be able to communicate with them.

122
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:25,699
[SPEAKER_03]: The other things that we have done is in the recreation website if you go on to it recently we do have a section now that tells you how to translate our website into multiple languages.

123
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:33,863
[SPEAKER_03]: The software that we have already has that capability so just working with the connectors team and having that posted up front on the web page

124
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:40,726
[SPEAKER_03]: We are trying to really use QR codes and direct people to our recreation website.

125
00:12:41,146 --> 00:12:48,870
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there is a language barrier, they can get it translated and easy to see the different programs and events that we have to offer.

126
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:57,883
[SPEAKER_03]: With that, I do have to thank our liaison from the Connectus team, Charbel.

127
00:12:58,323 --> 00:13:11,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Charbel and I meet each month and we kind of go over what our needs are and a lot of the different goals and achievements that we've made with this really came from the Connectus team, particularly with Charbel being the point liaison person for us.

128
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:28,405
[SPEAKER_03]: The last one that we also had as a goal was to start using surveys and trying to get more community feedback and the types of programs and help kind of make some decisions on how we operate as a recreation department.

129
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:33,727
[SPEAKER_03]: We were trying to look for a larger goal of having a bigger survey.

130
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:37,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say not having the program manager, we kind of put that on hold.

131
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:43,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Krista, our new hire, already has a draft going, so like I said, she's hitting the ground running.

132
00:13:44,953 --> 00:13:51,176
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have used our newsletter, we've used Constant Contact for a weekly newsletter, and we started to do surveys.

133
00:13:51,877 --> 00:13:53,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them might be interested in programs.

134
00:13:54,578 --> 00:14:00,480
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, earlier in the fall, we did a survey for a cricket program because we had an opportunity to run cricket.

135
00:14:02,281 --> 00:14:07,943
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't get a lot of interest, so we decided it wasn't really the best decision of using all of our time.

136
00:14:08,364 --> 00:14:09,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Crickets for cricket?

137
00:14:09,964 --> 00:14:10,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Cricket, yes.

138
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:13,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

139
00:14:15,267 --> 00:14:18,790
[SPEAKER_03]: But we did also do other surveys too, such as the wrestling program.

140
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,732
[SPEAKER_03]: The wrestling program came out as a survey.

141
00:14:20,752 --> 00:14:26,157
[SPEAKER_03]: It was originally an idea from parents at the high school that their children are in a wrestling program.

142
00:14:26,838 --> 00:14:28,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Using the survey, we got a lot of interest.

143
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,284
[SPEAKER_03]: We decided to go ahead and run it, and we're running a youth wrestling program this spring.

144
00:14:34,545 --> 00:14:42,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other things that we've also done with that is just surveys on making a decision on where our movie nights are going to be or what movie we're going to display.

145
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:49,033
[SPEAKER_03]: In years past, we've always done this internally as a department and figuring out what type of movies we're going to do.

146
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:53,115
[SPEAKER_03]: This year, we were able to do a survey and break it down to the three.

147
00:14:53,575 --> 00:14:58,798
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is the survey that's really choosing the movies that we're going to have this summer.

148
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are just a couple of ideas that we've done with surveys.

149
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:05,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking forward to FY 25.

150
00:15:05,298 --> 00:15:09,302
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have four goals for primary goals department.

151
00:15:09,382 --> 00:15:12,925
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have other sub goals that I'm not reporting today.

152
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:16,548
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we found is achievable.

153
00:15:17,654 --> 00:15:19,796
[SPEAKER_03]: is can be a challenge for us.

154
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:23,118
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do think we'll put the department forward.

155
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:34,467
[SPEAKER_03]: First and foremost, this month, we did just receive a 12 passenger bus that was used with opera funding that is going to be shared with the Council of aging and with our recreation department.

156
00:15:35,487 --> 00:15:41,412
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a shared bus, but I think this does open us up for a lot of different programming ideas.

157
00:15:42,092 --> 00:15:45,535
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've already have started to work with ideas on how we're going to

158
00:15:45,555 --> 00:15:51,459
[SPEAKER_03]: include more field trips during our school vacation weeks, during school half day programs.

159
00:15:51,819 --> 00:16:03,446
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also going to try to implement this summer into our summer park program and have kids being able to go to different locations throughout the city and utilizing that bus a little bit.

160
00:16:05,293 --> 00:16:16,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Our second goal is to utilize the recently renovated street hockey rink that we finished this fall and to use home stadium to develop a intramural program for our middle school students.

161
00:16:17,904 --> 00:16:21,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Our third goal is to enhance our summer park program and our saga week program.

162
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:37,633
[SPEAKER_03]: And this really came about we Danny and our assistant director and myself went to the state conference, just a few months ago, and we had a couple of sessions that were specific towards camp, and these presenters.

163
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:41,054
[SPEAKER_03]: typically present from the American Camping Association.

164
00:16:41,374 --> 00:16:44,235
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got a little glimpse of what that conference would look like.

165
00:16:44,615 --> 00:16:46,995
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got to say, I think we got a lot of knowledge.

166
00:16:48,156 --> 00:16:51,917
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we came back with a conference really excited to try to implement some of these things.

167
00:16:52,557 --> 00:16:59,119
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think our goal this year is to work with the American Camping Association

168
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:10,862
[SPEAKER_03]: to attend more of their conferences and to become a member to really enhance a lot of the camp and the saga week programs that we have to offer.

169
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:16,184
[SPEAKER_03]: And our fourth and our final main goal is to offer free swim lessons.

170
00:17:18,665 --> 00:17:20,185
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a big goal of mine.

171
00:17:20,265 --> 00:17:21,666
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that I think

172
00:17:22,862 --> 00:17:28,624
[SPEAKER_03]: As many of you, when you are working in your fields, there are certain things that you want to achieve in life.

173
00:17:28,744 --> 00:17:35,107
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, as the rec department, this is one goal that I've always wanted to do and I'm very passionate about.

174
00:17:36,227 --> 00:17:42,130
[SPEAKER_03]: This year, we did try to go with certain grants and to try to offer free swim lessons.

175
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,650
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it is achievable.

176
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:49,453
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there are grants out there that I am very confident that we would be able to get awarded.

177
00:17:50,583 --> 00:18:03,944
[SPEAKER_03]: However, one of the things that we've done over the years to make our swim program affordable at Tufts Pool is we have our lifeguards trained internally by May at the beginning of the season and run an internal learn to swim program.

178
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:14,598
[SPEAKER_03]: In order to qualify the grants we have to be a nationally recognized swim program and that would most likely be American Red Cross since we are already an authorized provider.

179
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:18,779
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is still a challenge of a goal.

180
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:19,840
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not an easy one.

181
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:27,703
[SPEAKER_03]: This year we need to get our staff, we need to have a few more on staff that are water safety instructors and be able to run

182
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,546
[SPEAKER_03]: the National Recognized Program in order to receive those grants.

183
00:18:32,026 --> 00:18:47,200
[SPEAKER_03]: So there will be some legwork, but I do think it is achievable that by the end of next summer, we can make the swim program at Tufts Pool that is currently $35 for two weeks, that we can make that a free learn to swim program that I am very passionate about.

184
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Two rather quick things.

185
00:18:51,701 --> 00:18:53,403
[SPEAKER_03]: The next one is our program highlights.

186
00:18:53,823 --> 00:19:01,109
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have an end-of-the-year report that I am working on that I will have published on the recreation website in the next couple of weeks.

187
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:06,714
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a little challenging trying to do an end-of-the-year report when we still have a couple of months to go.

188
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:10,996
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do have one outlined and ready to be posted.

189
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:17,900
[SPEAKER_03]: But one thing that you will look at our programs overall, we do have a slight decrease in our program enrollment from this year.

190
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:27,666
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of that is expected, obviously having a program manager out for eight months, there were certain programs that we did have to cancel that we would normally be running.

191
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:31,128
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, that was pretty minimal, considering.

192
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:39,333
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing that you will see in our report since FY 22, we've had a steady increase in drop-in programs.

193
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:41,593
[SPEAKER_03]: So this should be an expectation.

194
00:19:41,753 --> 00:19:51,216
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing ourselves when we get emails from the public, a lot of the requests is for us to offer more drop-in programs or offer more times, whether it's women's basketball, pick a ball.

195
00:19:51,836 --> 00:19:54,358
[SPEAKER_03]: All different drop-in programs, people are asking for more of that.

196
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,339
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that should be happening.

197
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:02,183
[SPEAKER_03]: As we get more established, more people know about our programs.

198
00:20:02,323 --> 00:20:03,804
[SPEAKER_03]: People are coming into the drop-in.

199
00:20:03,864 --> 00:20:06,506
[SPEAKER_03]: There's enough people to run a pickup game.

200
00:20:06,986 --> 00:20:09,167
[SPEAKER_03]: So these programs are running.

201
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:10,748
[SPEAKER_03]: People are excited for it.

202
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:15,151
[SPEAKER_03]: But obviously, that takes gym time away that would normally be a program.

203
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:19,194
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you do look at our program enrollment, even though there's a decrease,

204
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:23,471
[SPEAKER_03]: that is expected with our drop-in programs increasing.

205
00:20:23,968 --> 00:20:32,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Another fun little thing that I noticed, I know everyone thinks recreation and pickleball, but that is our highest demand of drop-in programs.

206
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:41,852
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually twice, it's double the amount of people participated in our drop-in pickleball program to our second highest drop-in program, which was basketball.

207
00:20:42,672 --> 00:20:53,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously for us, we try to balance to make sure that we're not heavily focused on one particular sport or activity, but pickleball is certainly a big aspect to the recreation department.

208
00:20:55,282 --> 00:20:57,403
[SPEAKER_03]: The last and final part is our budget narrative.

209
00:20:58,784 --> 00:21:04,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Council bears I think you already gave a pretty good synopsis of what our budget request is.

210
00:21:05,506 --> 00:21:14,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Just some quick things to when you are looking at our budgets for the actuals you are seeing a large decrease in our full time budget and that is because of the.

211
00:21:15,911 --> 00:21:17,912
[SPEAKER_03]: vacant position for the program manager.

212
00:21:18,513 --> 00:21:23,976
[SPEAKER_03]: The position was only vacant for a few months, but there are other times where that person was on leave without pay.

213
00:21:24,056 --> 00:21:31,120
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are several months that you would see that we didn't have to spend money that was budgeted for.

214
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:43,661
[SPEAKER_03]: What you will see, and you're getting the reflections of FY24 for the calendar year, what you're not seeing is the overtime pay in our part-time employee line.

215
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:47,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I am expecting to be slightly above the budget.

216
00:21:47,963 --> 00:21:53,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, being short-staffed, there were some additional overtime that was unexpected.

217
00:21:54,585 --> 00:21:57,966
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you look at our part-time staff, I believe we're still about $10,000 left in the account.

218
00:21:59,927 --> 00:22:07,052
[SPEAKER_03]: but most of the part-time staff is accounting for our lifeguards, our bathhouse attendants, our park rangers that work in the summertime.

219
00:22:07,512 --> 00:22:22,563
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a few weeks that are still left in FY24, so I do think that will be slightly above, but we have used additional part-time staff, particularly in the fall when we were really short staffed to kind of help offset some of the administrative duties on that.

220
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:27,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, overall, though, at the end of the year, I still think we will.

221
00:22:27,686 --> 00:22:32,590
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm certain we will be lower than what is currently in the budget.

222
00:22:33,932 --> 00:22:35,713
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about the stipends.

223
00:22:36,173 --> 00:22:38,814
[SPEAKER_03]: There is still $3,000 left in our stipends account.

224
00:22:38,834 --> 00:22:43,115
[SPEAKER_03]: That was because of one certification we expected a person to renew, didn't.

225
00:22:43,135 --> 00:22:46,636
[SPEAKER_03]: So because it was expired, they didn't get an extra $3,000.

226
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:53,078
[SPEAKER_03]: And then moving into FY 25, we're leaving that because our new program manager

227
00:22:55,199 --> 00:23:00,444
[SPEAKER_03]: projecting that she will not have her pool operator license by the beginning of the summer.

228
00:23:01,645 --> 00:23:14,817
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will anticipate following year, we do want her to have that CPO license so that she is able to handle a lot of the pool chemistry and troubleshooting, particularly with that position working nights and weekends.

229
00:23:16,418 --> 00:23:17,599
[SPEAKER_03]: our sick leave incentives.

230
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:25,802
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just we reduce it by looking at previous years of how much we've how much we've actually had to pay out and sick leave incentives.

231
00:23:26,262 --> 00:23:29,923
[SPEAKER_03]: The reality is every single manager on our team have children.

232
00:23:29,963 --> 00:23:35,586
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we can all agree that it's an unreal expectation that all of us are going to take no sick time.

233
00:23:35,686 --> 00:23:41,008
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were able to reduce that amount and be realistic on what that budget would be.

234
00:23:41,668 --> 00:23:50,271
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you do look at your full time increases, that is part of the negotiations with the union teams, just local 25.

235
00:23:51,311 --> 00:23:53,652
[SPEAKER_03]: It is still under contract negotiation.

236
00:23:54,252 --> 00:23:55,913
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a part of that discussion.

237
00:23:55,993 --> 00:24:03,776
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is one part that I probably will not be able to answer too much with the council not being a part of the negotiating team.

238
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:07,257
[SPEAKER_03]: I leave that for questions.

239
00:24:08,817 --> 00:24:09,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, thank you, Kevin.

240
00:24:09,677 --> 00:24:14,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I will go to Councilor Scarpelli, and then if anyone else wants to join in.

241
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Kevin, thanks so much.

242
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:18,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

243
00:24:20,022 --> 00:24:34,688
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of my initiatives when I first started to bring forth the vision of a full-time recreation department, and you've taken that vision that we had years ago and done

244
00:24:35,854 --> 00:24:36,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Yoman's work.

245
00:24:36,654 --> 00:24:40,795
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been amazing to see what you've done for not a lot.

246
00:24:41,635 --> 00:24:41,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

247
00:24:42,176 --> 00:24:51,658
[SPEAKER_05]: I can honestly say that because I'm reviewing my budget this year, and I'm embarrassed to see what we have and how you're functioning.

248
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:55,479
[SPEAKER_05]: So I give you, you and your team, pat on the back.

249
00:24:55,519 --> 00:25:00,740
[SPEAKER_05]: You and Mr. Folsom really done a great job, and I think that people should identify that.

250
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,921
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the constants we've seen in the last few years is how

251
00:25:05,091 --> 00:25:07,813
[SPEAKER_05]: amazing the recreation department's been.

252
00:25:08,433 --> 00:25:13,637
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we could talk about the little things, but that would have been bigger things in a negative way.

253
00:25:14,157 --> 00:25:26,286
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the lives we've, your life got saved at the pool and the pond and understanding what, how you prepared for that and making sure that we did what we had to do to fund that.

254
00:25:26,386 --> 00:25:32,530
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I didn't hear any, the good part is this, I didn't hear anything negative here.

255
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,511
[SPEAKER_05]: that you look like you're going to be okay.

256
00:25:34,571 --> 00:25:44,858
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing that I did see in one of my initiatives that we met to talk about what we were looking for, I looked at something close to my heart, which is recreation.

257
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:52,483
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have probably the most expensive administrative assistants in the country.

258
00:25:54,324 --> 00:26:00,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Between your salary and the salary of your assistant, it's kind of...

259
00:26:02,148 --> 00:26:05,451
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of we're losing money and what we can be doing.

260
00:26:06,592 --> 00:26:17,481
[SPEAKER_05]: And I brought forth the idea that we had when this came about last year with the Elections Commission and talking about the elections office and not having enough work throughout the year.

261
00:26:18,922 --> 00:26:47,101
[SPEAKER_05]: and how great would that be to find maybe if the chief of staff can forward this to the mayor's office and look at a part-time position, even if you have someone working in your office, I know because I understand it, someone there at 8.30 in the morning till 12.30, just to prepare your signatures for what you need for payroll, returning emails, returning text, phone calls, that I would imagine would open up so much of your day and so much of your week.

262
00:26:48,702 --> 00:26:50,604
[SPEAKER_05]: and I could see the benefit.

263
00:26:51,624 --> 00:26:59,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I see a lot in addition to an addition, and it's a minimal addition, especially when we're talking about what we're seeing in the elections office.

264
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:09,698
[SPEAKER_05]: And granted, some months might be slower, some years might be slower, but what a way to take the opportunity of, you know, cross-training someone

265
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,690
[SPEAKER_05]: to work in that role.

266
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:18,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that I would love to see maybe a little bit more work done before we sign off on the budget.

267
00:27:18,592 --> 00:27:24,494
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully that can come to fruition because it'll pay off.

268
00:27:24,854 --> 00:27:33,537
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's one thing that I fear is that working in recreation, always having someone on the other end of the phone when kids are out at programs,

269
00:27:34,335 --> 00:27:37,639
[SPEAKER_05]: or parents have questions, it's imperative that there's someone there.

270
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:48,210
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a safety, it's a reassuring factor, and it's a more legitimate factor, knowing that there's someone that's going to be answering the phone, and it's not going to be your director, your assistant director.

271
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially when, like you said, we do the, if

272
00:27:52,614 --> 00:28:00,136
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to step on your toes, but we do a robust babysitting program, 25 students at $50 a time.

273
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:02,857
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do it every other every other season.

274
00:28:03,438 --> 00:28:06,098
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we're seeing is it pays for itself.

275
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:11,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially if you're already trained to do it, it cuts eliminates the middleman.

276
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,961
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't really have any other questions except for

277
00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:19,904
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, a pat on your back and for your staff, I think that you guys are doing some amazing things.

278
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:41,077
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear a track meet, I see middle school programming, I see adult programming, I see drop-in programs, I see week vacation programs, I see programs that other communities don't do that we're doing here, so I give you a lot of credit, and something that I don't think everybody here knows, but

279
00:28:42,057 --> 00:28:49,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Our Director of Recreation is also the leader in the state, the field of recreation and aquatics, correct?

280
00:28:50,524 --> 00:28:59,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so the Massachusetts Rec and Park Association voted me in as the aquatic representative for waterfronts.

281
00:28:59,430 --> 00:28:59,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

282
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,491
[SPEAKER_05]: So waterfront trainings and stuff.

283
00:29:01,651 --> 00:29:08,857
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's another, you know, feather in our cap in the fact that, you know, I was taking advantage of Kevin for a few years calling him.

284
00:29:09,757 --> 00:29:27,963
[SPEAKER_05]: uh helping with my aquatics questions that you know you're always willing to help as a as a brother recreation employee so um I think the other piece too I'd like to I brought this up years ago and uh I'm not sure if it's a violation or an ethics issue but I don't care because I think it's important because I think looking at

285
00:29:29,113 --> 00:29:38,546
[SPEAKER_05]: years ago, I asked for the city to look into making Cornell Stadium's parking lot into a solar parking lot and see the benefits financially, what it can do.

286
00:29:38,926 --> 00:29:43,452
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hear that they're talking about maybe the schools coming forward, and that's such a great idea.

287
00:29:44,193 --> 00:29:52,920
[SPEAKER_05]: But imagine if we could put the fourth cab, if we can look at that parking lot and how we would fund the hockey rink.

288
00:29:53,361 --> 00:29:54,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I can only imagine.

289
00:29:54,782 --> 00:29:58,985
[SPEAKER_05]: I would assume the electricity costs would be over almost $200,000 maybe for the year.

290
00:29:59,005 --> 00:29:59,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you took the word.

291
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:05,971
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, if it was anything energy wise, put it to the rink, not to Hormel Stadium.

292
00:30:06,051 --> 00:30:07,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

293
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:08,393
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying.

294
00:30:08,413 --> 00:30:09,834
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we can find a way to do that.

295
00:30:10,555 --> 00:30:12,076
[SPEAKER_05]: it just benefits.

296
00:30:12,116 --> 00:30:22,083
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if we use some of that money to bring it back into the recreation department for what you're trying to do, I think that's an added benefit without costing us anything right now.

297
00:30:22,123 --> 00:30:35,191
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, if we can, for the record, Mr. President, if we can ask, maybe do an energy assessment over at the formal parking lot, and then,

298
00:30:36,727 --> 00:30:50,102
[SPEAKER_05]: again, requests the administration to see if we can do a dual position with another department, which we've heard with the elections department for administrative assistant that would support the recreation department.

299
00:30:50,122 --> 00:30:53,125
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you very much and thank you for your hard work.

300
00:30:53,145 --> 00:30:53,705
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.

301
00:30:53,926 --> 00:30:54,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

302
00:30:54,266 --> 00:30:54,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys so much.

303
00:30:54,827 --> 00:30:57,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to clarify on the energy assessment for the parking lot.

304
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:58,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's for overhead

305
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:01,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, overhead, it's pockets.

306
00:31:01,722 --> 00:31:07,233
[SPEAKER_05]: They can, if you want, the Lincoln Sudbury High School, if they want something to...

307
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:09,776
[SPEAKER_05]: to see what it looks like.

308
00:31:10,277 --> 00:31:11,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Even Stone Zoo has it now too.

309
00:31:11,758 --> 00:31:13,419
[SPEAKER_05]: So it doesn't touch the trees.

310
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,922
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't affect parking spots.

311
00:31:17,422 --> 00:31:24,027
[SPEAKER_05]: All it does is puts a covering over that we can capture that energy that could feed the hockey rink and save us a lot of money.

312
00:31:24,427 --> 00:31:27,830
[SPEAKER_05]: And that would be super if we could see if we can do that.

313
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:33,754
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a motion to request an energy assessment for the Hormel parking lot for solar to power the

314
00:31:35,015 --> 00:31:35,815
[SPEAKER_06]: the hockey rink.

315
00:31:36,296 --> 00:31:36,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

316
00:31:37,016 --> 00:31:46,661
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also a motion, or the same motion, a request to consider a split position for administrative support for the Recreation Department, potentially split with another department.

317
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:47,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

318
00:31:48,202 --> 00:31:52,364
[SPEAKER_06]: By Councilor Scarpelliglia, seconded by Councilor Leming, and we'll take the motions at the end of the meeting.

319
00:31:53,924 --> 00:31:56,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further questions for our Recreation Department?

320
00:31:56,526 --> 00:31:57,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lazzaro.

321
00:31:57,651 --> 00:31:58,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a question, just a comment.

322
00:31:58,732 --> 00:32:01,954
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to say I love the idea of the free swimming lessons.

323
00:32:02,074 --> 00:32:08,339
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so important for public safety and health to make sure our residents are able to swim.

324
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,160
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really support that.

325
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:16,545
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you need any backup or, you know, letters of support where you're writing grants or anything like that, I'd be happy to help.

326
00:32:16,605 --> 00:32:18,206
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's an awesome initiative.

327
00:32:18,406 --> 00:32:18,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

328
00:32:19,327 --> 00:32:20,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

329
00:32:21,459 --> 00:32:21,799
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

330
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:26,865
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to thank Kevin for all the work that he has done for us, our city.

331
00:32:27,385 --> 00:32:27,605
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean,

332
00:32:29,608 --> 00:32:44,297
[SPEAKER_00]: My colleague, Councilor Scarpelli, is such a leader in this field as well, and for him to seek such high praise of Kevin, I think is further proof of the really excellent job that our director is doing in our city.

333
00:32:44,737 --> 00:32:53,503
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that we've been talking quite a lot about that the Council is working on with Kevin is, of course, the Youth Commission, and I'm very excited to see where that goes as well.

334
00:32:53,863 --> 00:32:56,604
[SPEAKER_00]: but I wanted to thank him for the work.

335
00:32:57,604 --> 00:33:07,288
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Councilor Scarpelli answered or asked the main question I had about staffing, administrative staffing, which is, you know, I've heard some parents calling about.

336
00:33:08,368 --> 00:33:10,549
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's, you know, helpful.

337
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:13,410
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll happily support that motion as well.

338
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:14,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

339
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

340
00:33:18,511 --> 00:33:20,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further questions or discussion?

341
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Kevin, will you do Hormel tonight?

342
00:33:24,331 --> 00:33:26,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Sam, I can present on that as well.

343
00:33:26,811 --> 00:33:43,756
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just very quickly say that the Hormel budget for the Hormel Commission, if I can get to it, is budgeted for no change, $3,900 for stipend for the boards and commissions, and then a $1,500 stipend, I believe that's for the staff support for the Hormel Commission.

344
00:33:44,636 --> 00:33:48,377
[SPEAKER_06]: And if there's anything else you want to talk about Hormel Stadium or the commission?

345
00:33:48,998 --> 00:33:50,238
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to keep this one very simple.

346
00:33:51,499 --> 00:33:55,461
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the homeowner commission, it's a pretty simple budget.

347
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:58,863
[SPEAKER_03]: We have three commissioners on the board plus a secretary.

348
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:08,228
[SPEAKER_03]: When you are looking the FY 24 actuals, you see that there is a decrease in that and the projection and that's because one of the board members have recently moved.

349
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:10,310
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is a vacant position.

350
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:19,575
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why for FY 25, it is the same request as FY 24 with the expectation that we will have a new board member soon.

351
00:34:21,203 --> 00:34:22,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

352
00:34:22,665 --> 00:34:23,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

353
00:34:23,126 --> 00:34:23,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

354
00:34:36,069 --> 00:34:38,430
[SPEAKER_05]: The press box has been pretty dangerous.

355
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:41,271
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess we've had visitors there.

356
00:34:41,971 --> 00:34:42,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Squirrels.

357
00:34:42,652 --> 00:34:47,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Squirrels, they have their own, their address there now.

358
00:34:47,954 --> 00:34:48,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any talk?

359
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:53,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that there was some talk that we were supposed to do some renovations, but that hasn't happened, right?

360
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:58,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so we did have some plans of doing some repairs to it.

361
00:34:58,636 --> 00:35:00,957
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't call it a renovation.

362
00:35:02,118 --> 00:35:06,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we do need to look at replacing it completely at some point.

363
00:35:06,759 --> 00:35:09,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, if we do a full renovation of this, we would have to also

364
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:13,623
[SPEAKER_03]: make it ADA accessible, which would include an elevator.

365
00:35:14,003 --> 00:35:17,525
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is pretty costly to completely do the press box.

366
00:35:18,006 --> 00:35:23,249
[SPEAKER_03]: With that said, we certainly need to do repairs to keep our animal friends out and to make it safe.

367
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:26,191
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have been working with the DPW department.

368
00:35:27,172 --> 00:35:27,432
[SPEAKER_03]: They

369
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:29,594
[SPEAKER_03]: are in the process.

370
00:35:29,654 --> 00:35:41,521
[SPEAKER_03]: They have purchased some of the material and I have given them a budget to be able to do a lot of the work basically completely replace the roof and to re-vinyl side the press box and stuff.

371
00:35:41,541 --> 00:35:46,625
[SPEAKER_03]: So while it's not a full renovation it would look a lot better than where it currently is.

372
00:35:47,605 --> 00:35:54,090
[SPEAKER_03]: There has been some staffing issues under the DPW department which led us to doing some just quick repairs.

373
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,470
[SPEAKER_03]: There has been

374
00:35:56,511 --> 00:36:02,815
[SPEAKER_03]: some repairs to it for this season where all the holes where animals have been getting in has been completely closed.

375
00:36:03,256 --> 00:36:07,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say for the past two months, we have not had any visitors in the press box.

376
00:36:07,819 --> 00:36:10,520
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just from the quick repair for DPW.

377
00:36:11,141 --> 00:36:23,349
[SPEAKER_03]: But I am still hoping that when DPW has time to be able to do the actual work of replacing the roof and the vinyl siding and make it aesthetically pleasing as well.

378
00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:29,396
[SPEAKER_03]: As you know, when you first walk into Hormel, that's one of the first things that you see when you drive into that parking lot area.

379
00:36:29,516 --> 00:36:33,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's something that I really want to get taken care of as soon as possible.

380
00:36:34,762 --> 00:36:38,407
[SPEAKER_05]: If I can, I know that the only reason why I bring this up is that former alumni that

381
00:36:38,939 --> 00:36:49,523
[SPEAKER_05]: done very well for themselves, reached out and asked if there's anything they can do financially, or they also are in the business that possibly they would like to commit and help.

382
00:36:49,563 --> 00:36:57,906
[SPEAKER_05]: So if there's any way that if you want to leave that charge and see what that would entail, and I could put everybody together, I think that'd be great.

383
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:02,768
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the other issue too, that they brought up was the audio system.

384
00:37:03,668 --> 00:37:04,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was gonna bring that up.

385
00:37:04,748 --> 00:37:05,849
[SPEAKER_03]: So from what,

386
00:37:07,389 --> 00:37:12,854
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're referring to the same thing with the audio system, there's been times where the audio hasn't been working.

387
00:37:13,355 --> 00:37:16,378
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is actually from our visitor friends coming into the press box.

388
00:37:16,998 --> 00:37:23,525
[SPEAKER_03]: As you know, squirrels like to eat wires, and they've been eating wires in the microphone and ruining the speakers.

389
00:37:24,105 --> 00:37:35,675
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is one of the main reasons why I also said, put the money in, do work that is necessary in the press box, because we're spending money on the other end of constantly repairing the sound system.

390
00:37:36,716 --> 00:37:46,585
[SPEAKER_03]: With that said, our last repair, our manager, John Curley, did speak to them about the issue of squirrels getting in and chewing on the wires.

391
00:37:46,785 --> 00:37:46,885
[SPEAKER_03]: And

392
00:37:47,425 --> 00:37:55,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only did we fix it, but we also did conduit like enclosures so that animals can't get access to the wire itself.

393
00:37:55,551 --> 00:38:01,816
[SPEAKER_03]: So we haven't had issues recently where we did have it last year.

394
00:38:01,876 --> 00:38:04,638
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would like to say that this has been a solution.

395
00:38:05,299 --> 00:38:10,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, we need to go through at least a full season to know that that is certainly a fix.

396
00:38:11,223 --> 00:38:14,746
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are trying to address that to make sure that animals are not chewing on those wires.

397
00:38:15,342 --> 00:38:19,425
[SPEAKER_05]: And as we can see, I mean, Homel is now, it's not just the high school's field.

398
00:38:20,045 --> 00:38:29,711
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we're hosting professional teams, our marching band and color guards, we're doing multiple rentals now there.

399
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:35,755
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's beneficial that we, you know, are cost effective, that we make sure we do that.

400
00:38:36,175 --> 00:38:38,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they still bringing out that 1902 speaker?

401
00:38:40,638 --> 00:38:45,763
[SPEAKER_05]: before games you know that gigantic it looked like a megaphone they're not that i know

402
00:38:48,581 --> 00:38:53,843
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a sound system as a backup that we use as a rec department for like city events and stuff.

403
00:38:54,283 --> 00:38:59,965
[SPEAKER_03]: We do store that down in our office so that if we do have an issue with sound, we do have a backup plan.

404
00:38:59,985 --> 00:39:05,207
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of my background used to be at MIT for their sporting events.

405
00:39:05,287 --> 00:39:08,429
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've just learned from that job, I always have a backup plan.

406
00:39:08,649 --> 00:39:10,189
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are trying to do that with Hormel.

407
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:13,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the same budget as when I was at MIT, but we do try.

408
00:39:15,031 --> 00:39:17,713
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of backwards, isn't it?

409
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:18,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

410
00:39:18,714 --> 00:39:23,057
[SPEAKER_06]: If I could follow up on Councilor Scarpelli's question about the sound system at Hormel.

411
00:39:24,177 --> 00:39:33,463
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad to hear about the conduit, and I think our videographer, Shane, may have had something to do with some of the repairs, so thanks, Shane.

412
00:39:34,344 --> 00:39:37,106
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think there's also, you know,

413
00:39:39,366 --> 00:39:54,900
[SPEAKER_06]: The band had their great award-winning show last year, and I think the cheer team had a song program as well, and the sound quality itself was just really underwhelming, I think is a fair comment.

414
00:39:56,949 --> 00:40:10,234
[SPEAKER_06]: So if there is any sort of ability to maybe try to improve on that front, I mean, I think it's fine for like doing vocal announcements and kind of doing the play-by-play, but when you try to pump music through that thing, it's pretty rough.

415
00:40:10,494 --> 00:40:13,775
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I know that that was, you know, something that

416
00:40:14,554 --> 00:40:32,562
[SPEAKER_06]: I think would have been nice to, if it was a little bit of a higher quality, I think it would have been nice for everybody, at least I was at the Thanksgiving game, and you know, when we win a Thanksgiving game, which is starting to happen more, it's nice to have that for everyone who's also showing off their big shows at halftime and stuff like that.

417
00:40:32,662 --> 00:40:34,123
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to throw that comment in.

418
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:36,104
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm glad to hear that at least we're not

419
00:40:37,124 --> 00:40:39,805
[SPEAKER_06]: chewing through everything at this point with our squirrels.

420
00:40:40,265 --> 00:40:57,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and to your point, just I would say, in all honesty, I think the first thing we should focus on is getting the press box fixed, make sure no animals are in there, and then work on the sound system, because I don't want to improve the sound system and then find, you know, that any animals are eating it still.

421
00:40:58,028 --> 00:40:58,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

422
00:40:58,528 --> 00:40:58,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

423
00:40:58,948 --> 00:41:00,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

424
00:41:00,408 --> 00:41:00,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

425
00:41:00,688 --> 00:41:03,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further questions about the Hormel Commission, Hormel Stadium?

426
00:41:05,399 --> 00:41:07,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing none, thank you, Kevin.

427
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Danny.

428
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:08,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

429
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:10,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Glad to have you here.

430
00:41:10,381 --> 00:41:15,263
[SPEAKER_06]: And if there's anything you want to come back in June and talk about, we'll be more than happy to have you.

431
00:41:15,463 --> 00:41:16,944
[SPEAKER_03]: But if not, thank you for having me tonight.

432
00:41:17,084 --> 00:41:18,705
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you in a few months.

433
00:41:18,725 --> 00:41:19,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

434
00:41:19,265 --> 00:41:19,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

435
00:41:19,765 --> 00:41:20,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

436
00:41:23,167 --> 00:41:23,547
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

437
00:41:24,087 --> 00:41:29,650
[SPEAKER_06]: The last two budgets we have for tonight are the Executive Department and the Licensing Commission.

438
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:32,071
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe we have the Chief of Staff, Nina Nazarian,

439
00:41:33,086 --> 00:41:34,186
[SPEAKER_06]: present those budgets.

440
00:41:34,947 --> 00:41:37,207
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm guessing you want to take executive first.

441
00:41:39,408 --> 00:41:45,190
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think I have here, I'll just read it off.

442
00:41:48,391 --> 00:41:49,431
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a total budget of $667,696.68.

443
00:41:49,471 --> 00:41:49,912
[SPEAKER_06]: That's up from $640,390.

444
00:41:58,142 --> 00:42:03,712
[SPEAKER_06]: And these costs are salaries, non-union increases, and the ending of ARPA.

445
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:07,479
[SPEAKER_06]: 10% of the communications director's salary is in ARPA.

446
00:42:08,883 --> 00:42:18,625
[SPEAKER_06]: And it also looks like the special project administrator position is going down in terms of hours, and some of the positions in the executive department are funded by outside sources.

447
00:42:19,785 --> 00:42:26,146
[SPEAKER_06]: So it looks like all of the growth and costs for the department is fixed cost growth for staff for their pay.

448
00:42:26,906 --> 00:42:32,227
[SPEAKER_06]: And with that, I'll turn it over to you to share whatever you'd like to share, and also to let us know if there's anything.

449
00:42:32,247 --> 00:42:35,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, obviously, it's the executive department,

450
00:42:36,024 --> 00:42:44,130
[SPEAKER_06]: you would probably know best about your own department of, you know, if you're going to request from the mayor for the mayor to put something in the budget.

451
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:49,874
[SPEAKER_06]: But if there's anything in the future that you're considering for your department that wasn't included this year, we'd love to hear about it.

452
00:42:51,075 --> 00:42:52,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, thank you very much.

453
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:59,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the overview that you provided on the executive budget that's presented tonight is pretty clear and spot on.

454
00:42:59,878 --> 00:43:02,259
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't necessarily have much more to add to that.

455
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:10,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I also, you know, given the timing of these presentations and given the timing of how we've done these in the past,

456
00:43:11,902 --> 00:43:22,869
[SPEAKER_02]: the mayor would present the entire budget, talk about highlights throughout the organization, things that our office has worked closely with other offices on to, you know, get off the ground.

457
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:38,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to either, you know, entirely skip over that section or just do some very, very high-level items, because, you know, that will all be presented at a later time when we do the full-budget presentation, when the full-budget book is before the council.

458
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:59,265
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, again, I'm happy to go through any item that the council has any questions on, and I'll pause now in case there are questions, but I'm happy to go through just very, very quick high-level highlights on FY24 and follow the council's lead on what you'd like.

459
00:43:59,305 --> 00:44:06,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is just a different process, so it makes it a little... It almost... And this is... I'm...

460
00:44:09,434 --> 00:44:14,237
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad we've worked together to develop a budget ordinance that begins this process early.

461
00:44:14,357 --> 00:44:15,898
[SPEAKER_02]: None of us feel we're in a rush.

462
00:44:16,299 --> 00:44:32,389
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just that this particular department being discussed earlier, it just puts things at a different timing and shifts things in a way that makes it a little, I don't want to say unusual, but that's the best word I'm able to come up with right now.

463
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:35,152
[SPEAKER_02]: different than the history.

464
00:44:35,192 --> 00:44:43,599
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to treat this as the nuts and bolts and leave the big show for the big budget presentation, I certainly wouldn't mind because we are at 653.

465
00:44:43,899 --> 00:44:47,362
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you'd like to share highlights, we've invited every department to share that as well.

466
00:44:47,402 --> 00:44:48,343
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're welcome to do so.

467
00:44:48,897 --> 00:44:51,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll do very, very, very high highlights.

468
00:44:51,658 --> 00:45:10,525
[SPEAKER_02]: And that really is not even, you know, in, in fear of actually leaving very, very high highlights off, because as I attempted to think about how I would present tonight, you know, there's, there's inevitably a chance that I missed something that I should be recognizing, but I at a

469
00:45:11,371 --> 00:45:14,854
[SPEAKER_02]: at the opportunity to at least touch on some of those high highlights.

470
00:45:14,914 --> 00:45:20,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I will do so and hope that anything I missed obviously would be captured by a future presentation.

471
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:21,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

472
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Go right ahead.

473
00:45:22,581 --> 00:45:22,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

474
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:24,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

475
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:45,556
[SPEAKER_02]: So as the city council knows, you know, the mayor's office has worked cooperatively, both in her capacity as chair of the school committee, but obviously in the mayor's office, just in general, to get a application before the Massachusetts School Building Authority to have that accepted by the school building authority and continues to work cooperatively with

476
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:51,661
[SPEAKER_02]: schools to further that top priority of, I'm sure, the mayor, this council.

477
00:45:52,161 --> 00:45:58,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the mayor and then I'm sure this council of, you know, having a new high school building for this community.

478
00:46:00,047 --> 00:46:06,853
[SPEAKER_02]: The office worked closely with the finance team to have a recent bond rating reissued.

479
00:46:06,893 --> 00:46:11,296
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to do that because we went out to permanently bond and anytime permanent bonding is

480
00:46:13,345 --> 00:46:15,117
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially required than a...

481
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:27,165
[SPEAKER_02]: bond rating call occurs during that bond rating call, the community has an obligation to present a variety of answers for questions that the bond rating agency has.

482
00:46:27,745 --> 00:46:36,269
[SPEAKER_02]: With the help of the mayor, the finance team, I'm, again, pleased to announce that the city reaffirmed the second highest bond rating, which is a double A plus.

483
00:46:36,769 --> 00:46:43,672
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really something that community Medford size should be very proud to have and proud to maintain.

484
00:46:44,992 --> 00:46:46,493
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not necessarily easy.

485
00:46:46,934 --> 00:46:55,562
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also not necessarily easy to get to the next step, but we have our sights on that next step and are planning towards those next steps as well.

486
00:46:57,063 --> 00:46:59,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Our office obviously worked to fill a number of vacancies.

487
00:47:00,186 --> 00:47:03,629
[SPEAKER_02]: We have filled the human resources director vacancy.

488
00:47:03,789 --> 00:47:05,030
[SPEAKER_02]: We had filled the

489
00:47:07,023 --> 00:47:10,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Economic Development Director vacancy, the Building Commissioner vacancy.

490
00:47:10,584 --> 00:47:19,487
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to announce that our new Elections Manager will begin on Monday, May 6th, and also the Veterans Services Director vacancy.

491
00:47:19,527 --> 00:47:22,508
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a very high level of department head level positions.

492
00:47:24,505 --> 00:47:39,014
[SPEAKER_02]: We the office worked with the health department office of prevention and outreach community liaisons and Medford connectors to enroll non English speaking residents into the city's reverse 911 alert system, allowing for targeted messaging across the community.

493
00:47:39,074 --> 00:47:40,795
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something certainly that I think.

494
00:47:41,455 --> 00:47:42,897
[SPEAKER_02]: should be highlighted.

495
00:47:43,757 --> 00:47:55,347
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a number of infrastructure projects that the office has been working closely with the DPW and engineering office on, with regard to 3 million in funding to repair nearly two miles worth of sidewalks throughout the city.

496
00:47:56,588 --> 00:48:07,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Among that also, another item at a high level is 500,000 on extensive patchworking across the community on 34 streets identified by the pavement assessment plan.

497
00:48:09,426 --> 00:48:19,670
[SPEAKER_02]: the office worked with the parking department to install new state-of-the-art meter, both kiosks and meter heads at all of our squares.

498
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:27,253
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still more work to be done, so that continues to be reviewed and hopefully projected into the future.

499
00:48:29,393 --> 00:48:32,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I think just to kind of

500
00:48:33,931 --> 00:48:55,070
[SPEAKER_02]: ended off again, you know, these are just my selected highlights the best I could, but we've worked with the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability and our fleet team to have electric vehicle charging infrastructure installed at the Yale Street lot, West Medford lot, Tufts Park, Roberts Elementary and Brooks Elementary.

501
00:48:55,959 --> 00:48:57,920
[SPEAKER_02]: So happy to answer any questions.

502
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:13,947
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I think the council, I know the council will receive a more thorough presentation of the executive budget and all the work that the executive office has done to collaborate with departments and internal and external stakeholders, including the council.

503
00:49:15,128 --> 00:49:15,788
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

504
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:20,790
[SPEAKER_05]: I can.

505
00:49:21,831 --> 00:49:22,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

506
00:49:22,191 --> 00:49:24,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for being here this evening.

507
00:49:24,945 --> 00:49:28,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I applaud the eight double plus rating for the bond.

508
00:49:28,367 --> 00:49:29,767
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's important.

509
00:49:29,807 --> 00:49:33,308
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot has to do with the amount of money we have in our free cash.

510
00:49:33,909 --> 00:49:38,871
[SPEAKER_05]: So kudos to the community for investing their money into that part.

511
00:49:38,911 --> 00:49:42,152
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a feather in the city's cap.

512
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:43,993
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's very important.

513
00:49:44,033 --> 00:49:49,335
[SPEAKER_05]: I just hope it doesn't affect us negatively when we look to balance our budget coming.

514
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:50,976
[SPEAKER_05]: FY 25.

515
00:49:54,040 --> 00:50:00,548
[SPEAKER_05]: When we see the mayor, I think there's a lot of questions I have, especially with the new growth as we're going through.

516
00:50:01,192 --> 00:50:14,662
[SPEAKER_05]: giving understanding, so if you want to prepare for that when we get here, the understanding of the lack of projects that we're seeing, the lack of new tax revenue, and I think the lack of movement in Method Square.

517
00:50:15,442 --> 00:50:24,689
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that, I believe it was her, at the mayoral debate she talked about these jobs that were already shovels in the ground, I believe I can bring that up.

518
00:50:25,009 --> 00:50:27,191
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's going to be important to see where the mayor stands when she gets here, but.

519
00:50:27,211 --> 00:50:32,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Knowing where that is, especially when we're looking to our fiscal future is going to be very important.

520
00:50:33,095 --> 00:50:36,898
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that if we can as well, uh, the home rule petitions that are out.

521
00:50:36,918 --> 00:50:45,044
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't hear much from the mayor and where she stands with those, so it will be nice when she comes as that presentation as we look at our fiscal future.

522
00:50:45,464 --> 00:50:46,685
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it'll be important to see where the

523
00:50:53,649 --> 00:51:05,478
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just a little curious that we have, if you can just educate me in the Director of Communications, looks like 94.5, Director of Community Affairs?

524
00:51:05,738 --> 00:51:06,879
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct.

525
00:51:06,979 --> 00:51:07,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, 94.5.

526
00:51:08,019 --> 00:51:13,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we have Special Projects Coordinator, it's a small $13,000, looks like a stipend.

527
00:51:13,563 --> 00:51:16,826
[SPEAKER_05]: And then does that look like we're hiring another communications specialist at 75.3?

528
00:51:18,712 --> 00:51:20,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what the increase says, is that someone moved?

529
00:51:20,713 --> 00:51:46,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, through you to Councilor Scarapelli, no, that's essentially our second comms staff member that has been ARPA funded and is now shifting to being partially ARPA funded and partially on the Barr Foundation, which is a grant that was secured by, essentially led and spearheaded by the Office of Prevention and Outreach and in collaboration with the Mayor's Office, Health Office, Planning, Development and Sustainability.

530
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:47,880
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's an existing FTE.

531
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so that's great.

532
00:51:49,121 --> 00:51:50,403
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's funding sources.

533
00:51:50,443 --> 00:51:51,885
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's good to know.

534
00:51:51,945 --> 00:52:03,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Just that when you when you look at the budget, and when you're hearing it, I know that I got phone calls today that there are going to be massive cuts in the secretarial staffing at the high school I'm hearing.

535
00:52:03,562 --> 00:52:32,627
[SPEAKER_05]: huge cuts that that emergency meeting today and I just want to make sure that as we're looking at and I'll say this to all the the department heads moving forward and especially at the school department here with the executive department is making sure that we're looking at our executive offices and making sure that they've tightened their belts as much as they could because it looks like we're losing frontline employees again throughout the city

536
00:52:33,227 --> 00:52:37,030
[SPEAKER_05]: and we've seen level funded here at this office.

537
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:38,551
[SPEAKER_05]: So I could appreciate that.

538
00:52:38,591 --> 00:52:40,852
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you, Mr. President.

539
00:52:46,055 --> 00:52:48,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing none, would you like to present the License Commission budget?

540
00:52:48,657 --> 00:52:54,100
[SPEAKER_06]: I see it here as budgeted fiscal 24, 5,800, 5,400 for stipends and 400 for office supplies and budgeted for fiscal 25, the same amount, no change.

541
00:52:59,454 --> 00:53:00,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you, Mr. President.

542
00:53:00,615 --> 00:53:06,843
[SPEAKER_02]: And essentially, there's no change to the licensed commission structure staffing, not staffing, but appointed body.

543
00:53:07,223 --> 00:53:10,607
[SPEAKER_02]: And therefore, there's no change to the proposed budget this year over last year.

544
00:53:11,668 --> 00:53:11,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

545
00:53:12,409 --> 00:53:13,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions?

546
00:53:14,351 --> 00:53:19,157
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be asking for all these commissions of these all method residents managing the staff to the chair.

547
00:53:20,206 --> 00:53:24,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, through you, to Councilor Scarapelli, I can't say that with 100% certainty.

548
00:53:24,894 --> 00:53:29,181
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to review the matter, but I don't have detailed information on that.

549
00:53:29,782 --> 00:53:34,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Some positions obviously would require to be, and others may not require to be.

550
00:53:34,943 --> 00:53:59,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, if I can, I think that if you would have that ready for us with next meeting is the big much meeting, because that's one thing that I look forward to making sure that all of our commissions, our method residents, to have people that live in different communities and sit on commissions that are making big decisions for our community, I think is kind of, you know, it doesn't pass the test to me.

551
00:53:59,587 --> 00:54:02,068
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we can have that prepared, that'd be appreciated.

552
00:54:02,268 --> 00:54:02,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

553
00:54:03,752 --> 00:54:04,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

554
00:54:05,253 --> 00:54:08,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President, I'm happy to get that information.

555
00:54:08,176 --> 00:54:10,438
[SPEAKER_01]: I just timeline just a little bit more flexibility.

556
00:54:10,478 --> 00:54:10,738
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

557
00:54:10,758 --> 00:54:11,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

558
00:54:11,319 --> 00:54:11,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

559
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:11,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

560
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:16,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further questions for the chief of staff on the license commission?

561
00:54:19,246 --> 00:54:22,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, can you redirect the motions for the meeting?

562
00:54:39,292 --> 00:54:46,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, is there a motion to refer that motion to the administration and to adjourn?

563
00:54:46,095 --> 00:54:48,936
[SPEAKER_05]: I make the motion to refer that to the administration and adjourn.

564
00:54:49,356 --> 00:54:57,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll motion to refer that to the administration for a response and to adjourn by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Fleming.

565
00:54:59,421 --> 00:54:59,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Too late.

566
00:54:59,821 --> 00:55:01,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

567
00:55:02,442 --> 00:55:02,882
Thank you.

568
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:27,011

[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I mean, affirmative.
