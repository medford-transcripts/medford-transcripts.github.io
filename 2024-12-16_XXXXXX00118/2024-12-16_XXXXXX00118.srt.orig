1
00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:10,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:11,073 --> 00:00:11,573
[SPEAKER_03]: And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:14,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,254 --> 00:00:17,995
[SPEAKER_00]: And Danielle is a community mobilizer and change maker.

5
00:00:18,636 --> 00:00:20,356
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,617 --> 00:00:28,499
[SPEAKER_00]: Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:34,902
[SPEAKER_03]: And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:39,518 --> 00:00:42,200
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, thanks so much for having me here with you today.

10
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:46,204
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if you could just introduce yourself by saying your name and your pronouns.

11
00:00:46,845 --> 00:00:48,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Barry Rafferty, he, him.

12
00:00:48,086 --> 00:00:49,327
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, thanks Barry.

13
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:54,832
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are today sitting here inside your bar that's set to be open in a couple months.

14
00:00:55,612 --> 00:01:06,002
[SPEAKER_03]: But before we get into talking about the new bar, I'm wondering if you can answer the question that we ask everybody on the podcast, which is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

15
00:01:07,172 --> 00:01:08,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's a great question.

16
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:11,753
[SPEAKER_01]: I spend a lot of time in the Ford Tavern, obviously.

17
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:18,995
[SPEAKER_01]: But outside of that, I love two places in particular, the Magnificent Muffin and Bagel.

18
00:01:20,316 --> 00:01:21,776
[SPEAKER_01]: The guys in there do a great job.

19
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:24,697
[SPEAKER_01]: And Goldilocks, the guys in there do a great job, too.

20
00:01:24,897 --> 00:01:27,098
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned you get the same sandwich at Magnificent Muffin.

21
00:01:27,198 --> 00:01:27,478
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.

22
00:01:27,538 --> 00:01:28,058
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you order there?

23
00:01:28,158 --> 00:01:31,139
[SPEAKER_01]: It's club sandwich on white, bacon, sausage, salt, pepper.

24
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:33,159
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not good for me, but it's wonderful.

25
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Delicious.

26
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

27
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:34,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

28
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,504
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so like I said, and like you said, we know you as the owner of the Ford, or most people would know you that way.

29
00:01:41,145 --> 00:01:50,872
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're sitting right now inside a construction zone in Medford Square, in what will soon be your new bar.

30
00:01:50,892 --> 00:01:58,158
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm wondering if you could tell us a little bit about how you arrived at this point in wanting to open a bar, and kind of what your vision is here.

31
00:01:58,778 --> 00:02:09,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I'm a Medford resident, obviously, and there was a winter, two winters ago, it was a January evening around 8.30, I was going on one of my walks.

32
00:02:10,582 --> 00:02:24,407
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a snowy, cold evening and, you know, as we all do, there was a million things going through my mind, but as I was walking through Medford Square, I saw a for lease sign on this premises.

33
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:32,926
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found it intriguing, but I was not interested at that point, really, in opening another bar.

34
00:02:33,907 --> 00:02:36,369
[SPEAKER_01]: I had my hands full with the Ford.

35
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,571
[SPEAKER_01]: It was only open about a year, I think, at that point.

36
00:02:39,913 --> 00:02:52,724
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I walked about two buildings down, and I saw this old red-bricked wall, and I questioned whether the unit that we're sitting in now also has that red-brick wall, because I began to see in my mind

37
00:02:54,775 --> 00:03:03,644
[SPEAKER_01]: the starting ideas of how a back bar might look against an old wall that's, I don't know, as we look at it now, it's probably a hundred years old.

38
00:03:05,246 --> 00:03:11,472
[SPEAKER_01]: On top of that, when I saw the for lease sign, it was John Veneziano, who happens to be my neighbor,

39
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:17,630
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, yeah, no, Barry, keep walking.

40
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,831
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the time I got back to my house, I thought, you know, I'll call John tomorrow.

41
00:03:21,211 --> 00:03:25,352
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go walk through it and see what my opinion is.

42
00:03:25,432 --> 00:03:27,132
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did call John the next morning.

43
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:31,554
[SPEAKER_01]: I think about 45 minutes later, I ended up here in 25 Salem Street.

44
00:03:33,354 --> 00:03:40,717
[SPEAKER_01]: And the wall that I hoped was here was covered by, I don't know what the surface was,

45
00:03:42,115 --> 00:03:54,924
[SPEAKER_01]: foolishly or what maybe I shouldn't have done it but I just kicked a little hole at the bottom of that surface and I see behind it that there was a red brick wall so I thought okay well okay that's a good start.

46
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:56,685
[SPEAKER_01]: On top of which

47
00:03:57,806 --> 00:04:16,121
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked the size of it because if I was going to do an Irish bar I was going to make sure that it was small and cozy so the size certainly worked for me and there's a great basement downstairs that I could have storage and so forth in and what really closed the deal for me was there's a little space at the back of this unit that we can put a patio on.

48
00:04:17,322 --> 00:04:21,606
[SPEAKER_01]: It's semi-enclosed, it's not

49
00:04:23,858 --> 00:04:28,699
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no difficulties in relation to residents because there's no apartments close by.

50
00:04:28,719 --> 00:04:41,522
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, hmm, I could put a little deck out here, a little TV perhaps, and it's a place that you'll walk out to and you'll think, hmm, I think I'll sit down here, have my pint, and stay for the afternoon.

51
00:04:42,642 --> 00:04:51,985
[SPEAKER_01]: So I met the landlord, a gentleman called John Costas, and we agreed on a rent, and that was, I don't know, gosh, it could be nearly two years ago.

52
00:04:53,405 --> 00:05:01,429
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we are about two months away, or circa two months away from opening what will be an Irish bar called Mrs Murphy's.

53
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:08,812
[SPEAKER_01]: I called it Mrs Murphy's, my mother-in-law is a Murphy, is a Mrs Murphy obviously, and my wife is obviously Murphy, and I thought

54
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:17,591
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as against going with Murphy's or Murphy's Bar, I wanted to kind of put a female friendly element into it and Mrs. Murphy's was born.

55
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:22,893
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that did for me also was kind of give me an idea of how I wanted it to look.

56
00:05:23,793 --> 00:05:29,476
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I go back to my own childhood in Ireland, all we have is memories, Danielle.

57
00:05:30,116 --> 00:05:35,738
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, my memory is not what it used to be, but there's certain moments in my life that I'll never forget.

58
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:38,960
[SPEAKER_01]: One of which is going to my grandmother's farm

59
00:05:39,667 --> 00:06:03,821
[SPEAKER_01]: in County Mayo, where she had this old, small farmhouse on 50 acres of really poor land, stones, rocks, very hard to make a living out of, to such a degree that she had to come over to America for three or four years at a time, a nanny in a house in Manhattan to earn enough money to keep the family farm going, leave her three daughters behind.

60
00:06:04,861 --> 00:06:07,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Very difficult, very hard times, but I used to go

61
00:06:08,254 --> 00:06:09,871
[SPEAKER_01]: to my grandmother's house when she returned.

62
00:06:11,814 --> 00:06:13,455
[SPEAKER_01]: I might spend the whole summer there by myself.

63
00:06:13,515 --> 00:06:15,355
[SPEAKER_01]: I had five other siblings.

64
00:06:15,795 --> 00:06:19,516
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was six of us, but none of them wanted to go to Mayo.

65
00:06:19,536 --> 00:06:25,438
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all happy to stay in their house in Dublin and play with their friends and do their own thing.

66
00:06:25,498 --> 00:06:28,919
[SPEAKER_01]: But I felt like my grandmother was, she was elderly at that point.

67
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,520
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't like her staying there by herself.

68
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:38,522
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used to help her paint the gates and get rid of weeds and as much as I could help her.

69
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:40,223
[SPEAKER_01]: But she had,

70
00:06:41,311 --> 00:06:56,028
[SPEAKER_01]: She had this old farmhouse, as I alluded to, and in this house, it's extraordinary really, the house might have been, I don't know, 900 square feet maybe, but of the 900 square feet, 400 square feet was devoted to a room called the good room.

71
00:06:57,163 --> 00:06:59,565
[SPEAKER_01]: And the good room was not to be used by anybody.

72
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:09,712
[SPEAKER_01]: It was simply to be there for when the priest called into the house, or the lawyer called into the house, or the accountant, anybody with a profession.

73
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:21,460
[SPEAKER_01]: And the good china would come out, the tea and whiskey would be produced, and then when they left, it was all removed, and the door was closed, and you didn't go back in.

74
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,921
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I think about that old room,

75
00:07:26,148 --> 00:07:32,694
[SPEAKER_01]: I began to think about how I would like to dress this bar, and how I would like the feeling of this bar to be.

76
00:07:33,294 --> 00:07:41,801
[SPEAKER_01]: So it goes back to my grandmother, it goes back to my wife's mother now, and hopefully it'll go back to my children when it's my time to go.

77
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:48,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that reminds me of people here, they have the formal living room where everything is covered in plastic.

78
00:07:49,046 --> 00:07:53,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it reminds me of Everybody Loves Raymond, showing that.

79
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,431
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true, and Seinfeld for that matter too.

80
00:07:57,432 --> 00:08:00,114
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bizarre, I think the world has changed somewhat since then.

81
00:08:00,634 --> 00:08:01,575
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't do that anymore.

82
00:08:03,204 --> 00:08:04,345
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's kind of nice.

83
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,206
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of like it.

84
00:08:05,386 --> 00:08:11,050
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you have a 900 square foot house and 400 square feet is not available to you, it's kind of bizarre.

85
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.

86
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:16,694
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going for something to honor that aesthetic.

87
00:08:16,734 --> 00:08:19,616
[SPEAKER_03]: How would you describe how you want it to be in here?

88
00:08:19,756 --> 00:08:21,777
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, old.

89
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:25,040
[SPEAKER_01]: I would open with that.

90
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,521
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to

91
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:31,026
[SPEAKER_01]: when it's finished, I'd love for it to look like it's been here for 70 years.

92
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it's easy to say that, Danielle.

93
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,047
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard to do.

94
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:54,973
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've spent, I don't know how many road trips going up to New Hampshire to, you know, salvage yards, antique reclamation, all sorts of places to try to find, you know, five or six or seven or 10 pieces that I can kind of

95
00:08:55,707 --> 00:09:00,689
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporate here that go back to 50, 100, 150 years ago.

96
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:12,152
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we sit here now, as I just described before we went live, is, you know, there's two pieces, there's three, there's four pieces that I bought that came out of a mansion in Beacon Hill that was built in 1880.

97
00:09:15,203 --> 00:09:24,614
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's extraordinary to think really, when I think about that, the craftsmanship that's gone into these pieces, there was no machinery like we have now.

98
00:09:25,174 --> 00:09:34,404
[SPEAKER_01]: Weeks and weeks and months of time spent on these wonderful pieces that are now being reborn into something else and hopefully will be here for another hundred years.

99
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:45,569
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I wanted to kind of get a base of, okay, so if I get a certain amount of pieces that is old, that are old, I'll build around that.

100
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:58,452
[SPEAKER_01]: So, as we sit here, it's very hard for people to listen to us to try to explain it, but we're going to go back to old world benches, wainscoting, dark woods,

101
00:09:59,602 --> 00:10:01,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Not unusual for an Irish bar, let's be clear about that.

102
00:10:02,263 --> 00:10:16,167
[SPEAKER_01]: But warm, friendly, like when I walk into a bar and I feel like, gosh, they're nearly putting a blanket around me to make sure that I feel loved and respected and that they're glad that you're here.

103
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,409
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're going to try to do.

104
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:28,360
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the walls, what we'd like to do is, as against getting generic pictures and sayings and so forth, have something that means something.

105
00:10:30,123 --> 00:10:33,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately for me, I was on the phone to my mother yesterday about

106
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:38,771
[SPEAKER_01]: her old pictures of where she grew up and my grandmother and so forth.

107
00:10:39,011 --> 00:10:41,393
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, she moved house about four years ago.

108
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:42,453
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all been lost.

109
00:10:43,274 --> 00:10:44,175
[SPEAKER_01]: So she has a sister.

110
00:10:44,235 --> 00:10:46,356
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hoping that that isn't going to be lost.

111
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:56,484
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to kind of incorporate part of the wall space to what was important to me and when I grew up and how times are much simpler then.

112
00:10:57,505 --> 00:10:58,685
[SPEAKER_01]: And they truly were much simpler.

113
00:10:59,146 --> 00:11:00,447
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not going to try to

114
00:11:01,892 --> 00:11:03,793
[SPEAKER_01]: create something here that's cool.

115
00:11:04,114 --> 00:11:06,875
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to be the antithesis of cool, in truth.

116
00:11:07,336 --> 00:11:12,119
[SPEAKER_01]: We want it to be old and comfortable and familiar, where you don't feel I have to get dressed up.

117
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:21,365
[SPEAKER_01]: You walk in, you have a beer or two, or whatever else takes your fancy, and you leave thinking, yeah, it's kind of an extension of my living room.

118
00:11:22,326 --> 00:11:29,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I've heard the way that like the sort of culture around pubs in Ireland feels really different than like a bar.

119
00:11:29,153 --> 00:11:30,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm going to a sports bar here.

120
00:11:31,435 --> 00:11:41,444
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like, you know, I think we know from the Ford, like that you're very community oriented, right, that like you guys do a lot of work in the community, people know you a lot, I think for that.

121
00:11:42,345 --> 00:11:43,566
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess what are you hoping for?

122
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,491
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned how you want people to kind of feel at home here.

123
00:11:48,512 --> 00:11:53,418
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you hoping for, like an impact for the community, or how the community will interact with this?

124
00:11:53,438 --> 00:11:57,643
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question, Daniel, and I'll explain why, in my view, why.

125
00:11:57,663 --> 00:12:03,090
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a misconception, A, that Irish people

126
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:09,670
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say drink too much because, gosh, who defines what that is?

127
00:12:10,351 --> 00:12:20,339
[SPEAKER_01]: But Irish people use a bar or pub, which this is going to be, they use it as a means to communicate with their friends, to meet new people.

128
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:24,702
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't just come in for a beer or gin and tonic or whatever it may be.

129
00:12:25,122 --> 00:12:31,267
[SPEAKER_01]: They come in to interact before they go home or before they go to bed and it's a community space.

130
00:12:33,518 --> 00:12:38,841
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I can achieve anything, that would be my hope.

131
00:12:39,561 --> 00:12:42,162
[SPEAKER_01]: That it's somewhere, I'll meet you in Mrs. Murphy's.

132
00:12:42,922 --> 00:12:45,924
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a few beers, we'll have a chat, we'll have a bit of a laugh, and then we'll go home.

133
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:49,025
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I would hope it to be.

134
00:12:49,465 --> 00:12:58,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Medford, I live less than, I don't know, half a mile from here, and the Ford is, I don't know, a further mile down the road.

135
00:13:00,587 --> 00:13:06,789
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm at an age now, Danielle, where the idea of walking a mile and a half down to a bar is not really appealing to me.

136
00:13:07,609 --> 00:13:16,272
[SPEAKER_01]: But it certainly would appeal to me, given where I live now, to be able to walk, I don't know, eight minute walk down here, meet some people, and go home.

137
00:13:16,412 --> 00:13:22,134
[SPEAKER_01]: But the amount of housing that surrounds where we are now,

138
00:13:23,952 --> 00:13:30,762
[SPEAKER_01]: I would also hope they can leave their cars behind, they can walk, meet their friends and walk home from there.

139
00:13:31,764 --> 00:13:34,748
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in Medford, gosh, 11 years now.

140
00:13:34,768 --> 00:13:38,133
[SPEAKER_01]: I married a lady from Medford called Erin Murphy.

141
00:13:39,942 --> 00:13:41,584
[SPEAKER_01]: And quite frankly, it changed my life.

142
00:13:42,485 --> 00:13:43,967
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say that all for the good.

143
00:13:44,387 --> 00:13:45,088
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say that too.

144
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:54,419
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we moved back from Ireland, because Erin had lived with me for two years or so in Dublin, and we had no intention, to be honest, of coming back to America.

145
00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:55,440
[SPEAKER_01]: And neither did Erin.

146
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:58,043
[SPEAKER_01]: It just happened.

147
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:05,019
[SPEAKER_01]: By chance, I won't go into how or why, but the reality is it was a very unusual occurrence.

148
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:17,305
[SPEAKER_01]: And to such a degree that I was given an opportunity to come work for a large company in Boston, an opportunity that I wasn't looking for, and they pursued me.

149
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,847
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just thought one day, yeah, you know what, let's go.

150
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,369
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how I ended up in Medford.

151
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,792
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few funny little stories about Medford from my point of view.

152
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:32,856
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember my wife's family used to live kind of very close to Haynes Square.

153
00:14:32,876 --> 00:14:38,220
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember I went for a walk one evening and I sat on a bench at a bus stop.

154
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:41,903
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was watching the world go by, trying to figure out where am I?

155
00:14:42,063 --> 00:14:44,105
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I living in?

156
00:14:44,285 --> 00:14:45,426
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it was all new.

157
00:14:46,707 --> 00:14:49,869
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very different than what I was used to.

158
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,753
[SPEAKER_01]: And I couldn't figure it out.

159
00:14:54,813 --> 00:15:00,738
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say to Erin, let's go to a bar for a drink, and she'd bring me to what I would have called a restaurant.

160
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,820
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd say, well, this is not a bar.

161
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,461
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go to a bar.

162
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:04,302
[SPEAKER_01]: She'd say, well, this is a bar.

163
00:15:04,322 --> 00:15:06,284
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say, no, it's a restaurant.

164
00:15:06,764 --> 00:15:09,106
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no delineation here.

165
00:15:09,126 --> 00:15:10,187
[SPEAKER_01]: There certainly wasn't.

166
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:11,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at Redford, yeah.

167
00:15:11,508 --> 00:15:12,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

168
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:15,932
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went to a few places, and my dream began there.

169
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:21,095
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, well, if I'm going to do something by myself, I'm going to do it in Medford.

170
00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:24,516
[SPEAKER_01]: And here I am with the second place coming.

171
00:15:24,977 --> 00:15:26,397
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's my last, to be honest.

172
00:15:26,737 --> 00:15:30,139
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm old and grey and bald and I'm tired.

173
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:38,303
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, when I look at the projects that I've done over my life, this might be the nearest and dearest to my heart.

174
00:15:39,123 --> 00:15:41,624
[SPEAKER_01]: I want a little piece of Ireland here.

175
00:15:42,845 --> 00:15:44,565
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get emotional even thinking about that.

176
00:15:46,426 --> 00:15:49,947
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think people are excited for it too.

177
00:15:50,347 --> 00:15:53,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know the Chevalier certainly are.

178
00:15:54,588 --> 00:16:05,290
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, you know, from when I go through the square and I think about, you know, people from other cities parking their cars, trying to get somewhere to eat or have a drink in Medford Square before they go to the Chevalier.

179
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's so busy, but there's not enough places.

180
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,471
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's fair to say.

181
00:16:10,151 --> 00:16:14,152
[SPEAKER_01]: And this might play a little part in helping with that.

182
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:20,020
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly hope it will, and I'm pretty sure it will, actually.

183
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:20,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

184
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:28,462
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember, I mean, I remember coming, I was like teaching a podcast class at the library that went till eight, and I was like, I just want to get a drink after the class.

185
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:29,562
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to go to the Ford.

186
00:16:29,662 --> 00:16:31,022
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing open here.

187
00:16:31,342 --> 00:16:33,863
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was great to go to the Ford, but I had to drive across town.

188
00:16:33,903 --> 00:16:34,663
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I get it.

189
00:16:34,683 --> 00:16:35,363
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely get it.

190
00:16:35,403 --> 00:16:35,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

191
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:39,624
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people think sometimes, you know, competition is good.

192
00:16:39,844 --> 00:16:40,324
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my view.

193
00:16:41,564 --> 00:16:43,745
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't believe the Ford will be

194
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:47,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Competition or Mrs. Murphy's will be competition for the board.

195
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:55,519
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'll bring in new opportunities a new business and This city needs more competition.

196
00:16:55,579 --> 00:17:00,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and if competition comes for us here for mrs. Murphy's great bring it on Yeah, let's go.

197
00:17:00,304 --> 00:17:02,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we were we went to uh, I was worried about I

198
00:17:02,967 --> 00:17:04,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford Brewing since the beer hall opened.

199
00:17:05,168 --> 00:17:05,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

200
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,648
[SPEAKER_03]: And we went to trivia there.

201
00:17:06,668 --> 00:17:07,028
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.

202
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:08,028
[SPEAKER_03]: It was crowded.

203
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:08,868
[SPEAKER_03]: We couldn't even sit down.

204
00:17:08,888 --> 00:17:11,649
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think, you know, we're primed for wanting more.

205
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:12,549
[SPEAKER_01]: It's helped Medford.

206
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:14,389
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no question in my mind about that.

207
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it has.

208
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,290
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's good.

209
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:18,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

210
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,351
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when do you, like, do you have an estimate on when you'll be opening?

211
00:17:22,871 --> 00:17:25,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, this is a question I'm asked on a regular basis.

212
00:17:26,092 --> 00:17:28,292
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been asked it consistently for a year in the Ford.

213
00:17:28,552 --> 00:17:31,493
[SPEAKER_01]: And in truth, you know, I thought this would be open

214
00:17:32,953 --> 00:17:33,955
[SPEAKER_01]: I think last April.

215
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:36,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it was going to be April.

216
00:17:37,343 --> 00:17:40,110
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm keen to get it open

217
00:17:40,645 --> 00:17:42,906
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm also keen, insofar as I can, to get it right.

218
00:17:43,306 --> 00:17:48,148
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had to tie in with a general contractor, who was also the contractor who built out the Ford.

219
00:17:49,608 --> 00:17:53,150
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved them, great people, great craftsmen, honest people.

220
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,491
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was prepared to wait for them to be ready.

221
00:17:56,571 --> 00:17:58,492
[SPEAKER_01]: So that took a few months.

222
00:17:58,932 --> 00:18:04,794
[SPEAKER_01]: On top of which, the design and planning, there's far more goes into this than people understand.

223
00:18:04,894 --> 00:18:06,595
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though, as we sit here, it's only,

224
00:18:07,315 --> 00:18:09,896
[SPEAKER_01]: a footprint of 1510 square feet, I think.

225
00:18:11,697 --> 00:18:13,757
[SPEAKER_01]: You think, well, that's, I mean, how difficult can that be?

226
00:18:13,978 --> 00:18:15,638
[SPEAKER_01]: But I promise you, it is very difficult.

227
00:18:16,018 --> 00:18:21,340
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the whole permitting process and so forth is a skill set that I still haven't acquired.

228
00:18:21,941 --> 00:18:23,581
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's taken some time.

229
00:18:24,802 --> 00:18:28,283
[SPEAKER_01]: But to answer your question, I'm going to say

230
00:18:29,903 --> 00:18:33,009
[SPEAKER_01]: by mid-January I'd be very confident it would be open.

231
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:38,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there an element of the pub or any part of it that you're most excited for people to see?

232
00:18:39,862 --> 00:18:41,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's several.

233
00:18:43,653 --> 00:19:11,704
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an area, I think we spoke offline about this too, there's an area, as you walk in the door on the left, there was a thing called a snug in Ireland, and it was a private enclosed space where, we're going back, gosh, 80 to 100 years, where the ladies who liked to have a little beverage didn't want the world seeing them having their little beverage, so the bars created an area called a snug where it was women only.

234
00:19:13,188 --> 00:19:17,973
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though the world has changed, there is an area we are doing a little snug.

235
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:19,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Will it be women only?

236
00:19:19,094 --> 00:19:20,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you'll have to come in to find out yourselves.

237
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:23,098
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like the concept of it.

238
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,182
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the area I think, yeah, I'm the most excited about.

239
00:19:28,423 --> 00:19:30,344
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited too.

240
00:19:31,325 --> 00:19:33,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything else you want people to know about?

241
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:38,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we haven't discussed Armenia because in truth,

242
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,502
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the menu is now.

243
00:19:43,324 --> 00:19:46,748
[SPEAKER_01]: We're, what, eight, nine, ten weeks away from opening it.

244
00:19:51,373 --> 00:19:54,537
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how brave I want to be.

245
00:19:55,138 --> 00:19:56,619
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I want it to be great food.

246
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,541
[SPEAKER_01]: That's easier said than done.

247
00:20:00,947 --> 00:20:07,870
[SPEAKER_01]: The menu, in as far as I can make it authentic Irish, has to be married with the fact that we are in Medford in the USA.

248
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,291
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll be an Americanized version of an Irish menu.

249
00:20:11,731 --> 00:20:14,452
[SPEAKER_01]: It will not be big in as far as we can.

250
00:20:14,552 --> 00:20:15,333
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be quality.

251
00:20:15,993 --> 00:20:18,634
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be reasonably priced because I believe that's what it should be.

252
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:22,556
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the world we live in, that is becoming increasingly difficult to do as well.

253
00:20:23,196 --> 00:20:24,797
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know when we go to our supermarkets,

254
00:20:26,417 --> 00:20:31,422
[SPEAKER_01]: My goodness when you walk out with your taking your hand you think how did that just cost $100 for what?

255
00:20:33,143 --> 00:20:45,214
[SPEAKER_01]: The same applies to a business There's a science behind every bar restaurant where you know if you serve something for $10 you cannot it cannot cost you a certain above a certain amount for you to plate that

256
00:20:47,451 --> 00:20:52,215
[SPEAKER_01]: And unless you're really good at what you do, the only alternative is putting up your prices.

257
00:20:53,517 --> 00:20:54,618
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not something I wanted to do.

258
00:20:54,758 --> 00:21:00,283
[SPEAKER_01]: So myself and the chef, we have a good handle on that, but it's becoming very difficult.

259
00:21:00,303 --> 00:21:01,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.

260
00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:09,571
[SPEAKER_01]: But it goes back to your business model as well, how much, you know, I won't go into the business details, but if you keep everything reasonable,

261
00:21:11,213 --> 00:21:13,035
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got a better chance, let's be clear about that.

262
00:21:14,616 --> 00:21:17,179
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I said, yeah, it's not easy.

263
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,083
[SPEAKER_01]: So outside of that, we'll work on the menu over the next four or five or six weeks.

264
00:21:22,424 --> 00:21:27,048
[SPEAKER_01]: The kitchen equipment arrives, I believe the flooring is going down next week.

265
00:21:27,933 --> 00:21:34,016
[SPEAKER_01]: And once the floor arrives, we can get all of our kitchen equipment in and we can start playing around with what foods and figure it out from there.

266
00:21:35,537 --> 00:21:37,198
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the hard part, actually.

267
00:21:37,358 --> 00:21:38,278
[SPEAKER_01]: The menu is the hard part.

268
00:21:38,378 --> 00:21:46,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's not just about the menu, it's about how do you produce it on a consistent level on a daily basis for 50 or 100 or 150 people.

269
00:21:46,983 --> 00:21:48,443
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what staff goes with that.

270
00:21:48,904 --> 00:21:50,384
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're working on the staff now, too.

271
00:21:52,200 --> 00:22:03,524
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I said to you offline as well that my wife doesn't really enjoy going out with me for dinner or for beers because, you know, the business that I'm in, I've got something to say every time and it gets a bit boring for her.

272
00:22:04,304 --> 00:22:10,226
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the mood is created by the staff that work with you.

273
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:16,088
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're very lucky in the Ford that we have great staff and we're looking for great staff now too.

274
00:22:16,728 --> 00:22:20,129
[SPEAKER_01]: So for any of you who are listening to this, if you want to,

275
00:22:21,188 --> 00:22:25,773
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to have a conversation, just talk to Danielle, I'm sure she'll give you my number.

276
00:22:26,694 --> 00:22:33,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and you did mention County Mayo, and I know a huge Gaelic football fan, so I wanted to ask, will people be able to watch Gaelic football here?

277
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:37,385
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a great question too, and Premier League, that's another obsession in Ireland.

278
00:22:37,786 --> 00:22:38,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaelic football of course, yes.

279
00:22:40,508 --> 00:22:45,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Guild Football and Hurling will consistently be on.

280
00:22:46,212 --> 00:22:55,778
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, I was in City Hall yesterday asking, am I allowed to open at 7.30am for Premier League games and so forth, and they assure me that I am, so we'll do that too.

281
00:22:55,998 --> 00:23:03,623
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll evolve into that, so we'll get ourselves right first, try to figure out what we're doing, and then once we've got that figured out, we'll go further.

282
00:23:03,643 --> 00:23:05,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing, great.

283
00:23:05,304 --> 00:23:06,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're really looking forward to it.

284
00:23:06,905 --> 00:23:07,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you.

285
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:10,449
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been fun Danielle, thank you and well done for you.

286
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:11,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Well done to you.

287
00:23:11,412 --> 00:23:12,294
