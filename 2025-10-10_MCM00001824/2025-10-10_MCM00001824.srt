1
00:00:09,396 --> 00:00:10,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, everybody.

2
00:00:10,818 --> 00:00:11,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the patience.

3
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:21,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anybody have anything under good of the order from the committee?

4
00:00:23,555 --> 00:00:26,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Hearing and seeing none, we're going to go right to the consent agenda.

5
00:00:26,336 --> 00:00:31,458
[SPEAKER_05]: We have approval of bills and payrolls, approval of capital purchases, approval of donations.

6
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:41,562
[SPEAKER_05]: First donation is Kids Corner Child Care Center, $600 for a playground donation from Japanese Language School of Greater Boston.

[SPEAKER_05]: We also have approval of grants, approval of field trips, approval of meeting minutes from our regular meetings, September 2nd, 2025.

9
00:01:07,965 --> 00:01:09,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion to approve?

10
00:01:09,245 --> 00:01:09,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to approve.

11
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:13,466
[SPEAKER_05]: By member Lopate, seconded by member Intoppa.

12
00:01:14,406 --> 00:01:16,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, all those in favor?

13
00:01:16,407 --> 00:01:17,968
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

14
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:21,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Consent agenda is approved.

15
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:27,133
[SPEAKER_05]: We do not have any reports of our subcommittees, but we do have a number of reports under our superintendent.

16
00:01:27,273 --> 00:01:30,575
[SPEAKER_05]: First up is our Mustang moment, Dr. Galusi.

17
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

18
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:35,260
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very excited.

19
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:41,124
[SPEAKER_06]: So this evening for our Mustang moment, we have four CTE students that are here joining us.

20
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:44,527
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Haley Lagrassa, who's a senior in health assisting.

21
00:01:44,907 --> 00:01:47,850
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Will McLaughlin, who is a junior in electrical.

22
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:55,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Sarah Carboni, a freshman in Exploratory, and we have Gabriella Coletri, a senior in Cosmetology.

23
00:01:55,114 --> 00:02:05,761
[SPEAKER_06]: They're also joined by Executive Director of CTE Programming, Chad Fallon, and Assistant Principal, Sheila Freitas-Haley.

24
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:10,484
[SPEAKER_06]: So at this time, I'd like to invite the students up to share for Mustang Moment.

25
00:02:23,553 --> 00:02:24,294
[SPEAKER_04]: to the little speaker.

26
00:02:24,334 --> 00:02:24,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

27
00:02:24,674 --> 00:02:25,374
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not on.

28
00:02:25,415 --> 00:02:26,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hold on one second.

29
00:02:27,176 --> 00:02:30,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, there you go.

30
00:02:30,779 --> 00:02:31,159
[SPEAKER_06]: It's right.

31
00:02:31,179 --> 00:02:31,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

32
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:31,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so.

33
00:02:48,328 --> 00:02:49,389
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, I'm Haley.

34
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:50,970
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm Haley.

35
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,691
[SPEAKER_16]: I already said that.

36
00:02:54,112 --> 00:03:00,676
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm a senior in health assisting, and as an incoming freshman, I honestly had no idea what the vocational pathway was.

37
00:03:01,476 --> 00:03:04,018
[SPEAKER_16]: But when I heard about it, I had to try it out.

38
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:08,201
[SPEAKER_16]: I had no idea what I wanted to do, so I thought it was a good way to find out.

39
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:11,883
[SPEAKER_16]: Going through the rotations, it was really appealing to me.

40
00:03:12,123 --> 00:03:19,028
[SPEAKER_16]: I loved almost every shop, and I tried to picture myself in any of those situations.

41
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:25,852
[SPEAKER_16]: When it came to health assisting, I first thought I could never see myself in health care.

42
00:03:25,993 --> 00:03:29,835
[SPEAKER_16]: I honestly thought I was going to hate it, but I came out with an open mindset.

43
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:35,879
[SPEAKER_16]: And going through those four days, I just realized how much I understood already and how

44
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,301
[SPEAKER_16]: Interesting, I was.

45
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:42,084
[SPEAKER_16]: And then from there, I knew it was for me.

46
00:03:42,104 --> 00:03:46,507
[SPEAKER_16]: Health assisting was my first choice, and I got in without being waitlisted.

47
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:49,329
[SPEAKER_16]: And ever since then, my shop has been my happy place.

48
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:54,893
[SPEAKER_16]: I met some of my favorite people there, and without Mr. Fimo, I wouldn't be where I am today.

49
00:03:56,454 --> 00:04:00,558
[SPEAKER_16]: Not only have I met good people in my shop, but in the vocational school as a whole.

50
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:04,864
[SPEAKER_16]: My classes and the hallways around me are filled with a positive environment.

51
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:09,107
[SPEAKER_16]: I feel welcome in any shop I walk into, and we all help each other out.

52
00:04:09,727 --> 00:04:13,790
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't count how many times a kid from automotive comes in looking for a Band-Aid.

53
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:26,919
[SPEAKER_16]: After high school, I plan to go to college and get my master's degree and become a physician's assistant, and I wouldn't be able to even imagine that without vocational school.

54
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:28,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

55
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm Gabby Calicci.

56
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:36,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a senior in the cosmetology program.

57
00:04:36,882 --> 00:04:39,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Exploratory also helped me decide what I wanted to be in.

58
00:04:40,144 --> 00:04:45,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Originally, I went into freshman year wanting to be into business, and I was like dead set going into business.

59
00:04:45,847 --> 00:04:48,668
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as I went through the rotations, I loved Cosmo.

60
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:52,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I also got in without being waitlisted, and it was my first choice.

61
00:04:57,033 --> 00:05:08,902
[SPEAKER_02]: After high school, I plan to go to college and open my own dance studio, which has nothing to do with Cosmo, but it's one of those things that you can do both, and I'm a person that loves to do both, and going through the Vogue has let me do that.

62
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:13,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I love the Vogue just because, as Haley said, the community that it creates.

63
00:05:13,686 --> 00:05:16,369
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know me, I'm in every single shop but my own during the day.

64
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:20,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I had nothing to do with electrical, but Cormier was going to get sick of me soon.

65
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:27,243
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, how you doing tonight?

66
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:30,084
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Will, as previously stated.

67
00:05:30,524 --> 00:05:40,627
[SPEAKER_12]: But I knew when I was really young that I didn't want to just sit at a desk job and kind of sit around and type buttons on a computer all day.

68
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:44,507
[SPEAKER_12]: And granted, that sounds pretty fun for some people.

69
00:05:44,547 --> 00:05:45,648
[SPEAKER_12]: But for me, it wasn't the thing.

70
00:05:45,688 --> 00:05:54,270
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was interested in how things work, looking at things that I didn't understand, like escalators and the Bermuda Triangle, which I don't know if they figured that out yet.

71
00:05:55,418 --> 00:05:56,238
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll get there, I guess.

72
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:03,139
[SPEAKER_12]: But electrical was one of those things that I never really got much of it at first.

73
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,080
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, what is this?

74
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,000
[SPEAKER_12]: Is this just heat?

75
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,941
[SPEAKER_12]: I got nothing.

76
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:17,682
[SPEAKER_12]: And when I started at the high school and was able to go through the vocational rotations and all that, I had a really positive experience in all the shops.

77
00:06:17,762 --> 00:06:18,943
[SPEAKER_12]: All of them were very welcoming.

78
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:20,343
[SPEAKER_12]: The teachers were very knowledgeable.

79
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,612
[SPEAKER_12]: and they have firsthand experience.

80
00:06:23,652 --> 00:06:32,234
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of those people, they're not teaching just from a textbook, they're teaching from a place where they've been, and you don't always get that a lot of times at a regular school.

81
00:06:32,314 --> 00:06:37,095
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was very thankful to have met all the people that I have and have all the connections that I do now.

82
00:06:38,095 --> 00:06:41,556
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can only recommend it for other people, because it's treated me great.

83
00:06:41,796 --> 00:06:47,597
[SPEAKER_12]: And after high school, I planned on maybe someday opening my own electrical company or business.

84
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:50,290
[SPEAKER_12]: It would really be great for me.

85
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,474
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be great for someday if I start a family or something like that.

86
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:58,419
[SPEAKER_12]: But right out of high school, got to start at the bottom, work my way up, and it's going to be a great time.

87
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,421
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I know for sure.

88
00:07:00,961 --> 00:07:01,242
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

89
00:07:05,065 --> 00:07:11,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, I'm Sarah Carboni, a freshman currently in the process of the CTE Exploratory Program at Medford High School.

90
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:18,234
[SPEAKER_10]: Prior to the program, I was never once in my life told that someone could make a comfortable living without going to college and going broke.

91
00:07:18,554 --> 00:07:23,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, prior to... Oh, fuck.

92
00:07:23,398 --> 00:07:23,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

93
00:07:29,444 --> 00:07:38,700
[SPEAKER_10]: The longest time I was told, if you don't go to college, you won't be able to make money, which then you won't be able to make a living, and you'll be homeless.

94
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:45,554
[SPEAKER_10]: But thanks to the CTE program at Medford High School, I have learned that this is thankfully incorrect.

95
00:07:45,795 --> 00:08:01,340
[SPEAKER_10]: During the program, I have learned several things about the job industry and many different wonderful perspectives of the hands-on aspects of jobs such as that, such as electrical, automotive tech, carpentry, et cetera.

96
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,382
[SPEAKER_10]: The Exploratory Program gives students more information on all these useful and amazing professions that

97
00:08:09,162 --> 00:08:15,924
[SPEAKER_10]: even if I or other students chose not to join, still hold very valuable skills in them.

98
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:24,826
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, this past month, I learned how to change a tire, which is something I believe everyone should learn regardless of whether they choose to do it or not.

99
00:08:25,386 --> 00:08:27,647
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a skill that most people can't do on their own.

100
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:31,488
[SPEAKER_10]: So the fact that I was able to learn it thanks to this program means so much.

101
00:08:32,628 --> 00:08:38,052
[SPEAKER_10]: from coming from people who actually did this stuff for a living for a long time and who are very passionate about it.

102
00:08:38,112 --> 00:08:42,595
[SPEAKER_10]: It's amazing talking and listening and learning from these people.

103
00:08:43,235 --> 00:08:52,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Having exposure towards other career paths is a very valuable thing to any student and I think many, if not all, people should at least try the program.

104
00:08:52,762 --> 00:08:53,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

105
00:09:07,751 --> 00:09:08,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I should say that.

106
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,641
[SPEAKER_15]: I have two things to say.

107
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:43,148
[SPEAKER_15]: One, a huge shout out to Mr. Fallon because he really does run all of these businesses while he's assistant, while he's the principal of the VOC and it always amazes me your organization is just

108
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:45,120
[SPEAKER_15]: amazing to me.

109
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,381
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a huge Vogue fan.

110
00:09:46,581 --> 00:09:53,566
[SPEAKER_15]: My son is also in electrical and did karate with you, I think, maybe probably 10 years ago, so just FYI.

111
00:09:54,306 --> 00:10:06,294
[SPEAKER_15]: And then my daughter just graduated Medford High, a Vogue student, culinary, loved it, and decided today that she's majoring in criminology and a minor in forensic science, nothing to do with the kitchen.

112
00:10:07,255 --> 00:10:15,321
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think there is this huge myth that we've talked about many times here that, you know, you can still go to the Vogue.

113
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:17,223
[SPEAKER_15]: You can still go to college.

114
00:10:17,463 --> 00:10:20,605
[SPEAKER_15]: You can go to the Vogue for culinary and become a forensic scientist.

115
00:10:21,006 --> 00:10:21,806
[SPEAKER_15]: That's okay.

116
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:25,149
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, and I think busy hands are busy minds at school.

117
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:32,334
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just, when I was in high school, wasn't that long ago, but I went to Medford High.

118
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:37,500
[SPEAKER_15]: I went to Medford High too, and you couldn't cross that line.

119
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,302
[SPEAKER_15]: And I talked to Ms.

120
00:10:41,322 --> 00:10:48,445
[SPEAKER_15]: Fraley, what, Haley, Freitas Haley, the other day, and I was saying that we couldn't cross that line when we went to Medford High.

121
00:10:48,505 --> 00:10:55,468
[SPEAKER_15]: If you were a Vogue student, you were a Vogue student, you had a different start time, a different end time, you were not allowed to cross the line.

122
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,889
[SPEAKER_15]: You got in trouble, you got detention if you went over to the Vogue side.

123
00:10:58,349 --> 00:11:00,710
[SPEAKER_15]: So I love how much we've incorporated all of this.

124
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,691
[SPEAKER_15]: I love that.

125
00:11:02,811 --> 00:11:03,751
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys are happy.

126
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:05,032
[SPEAKER_15]: You want to go to school.

127
00:11:05,172 --> 00:11:07,173
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I remember so many days my daughter saying, I'm not going.

128
00:11:07,193 --> 00:11:08,433
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm like, well, you can't go to culinary.

129
00:11:08,453 --> 00:11:11,274
[SPEAKER_15]: And she was like, I love that it's the end of the day for you guys.

130
00:11:11,394 --> 00:11:15,676
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of you, you know, Dominic's a sophomore and he has to wait till the last two periods.

131
00:11:15,956 --> 00:11:17,657
[SPEAKER_15]: That is so strategic.

132
00:11:18,017 --> 00:11:22,459
[SPEAKER_15]: I love it because it gets them there and they want to stay and they want to stay till the end of the day.

133
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:25,420
[SPEAKER_15]: So yay, go Vogue.

134
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,180
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to keep promoting the Vogue.

135
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,341
[SPEAKER_15]: So keep talking about it.

136
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:28,761
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

137
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:29,421
[SPEAKER_15]: Keep doing good.

138
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:30,282
[SPEAKER_15]: Really proud of you guys.

139
00:11:30,302 --> 00:11:30,902
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much.

140
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:07,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's on.

141
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:08,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

142
00:13:08,852 --> 00:13:09,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Great job.

143
00:13:09,973 --> 00:13:11,075
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a great presentation.

144
00:13:11,095 --> 00:13:15,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up, we have our CTE lottery report.

145
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,565
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll call up Mr. Chad Fallon, our executive director of career and technical education.

146
00:13:19,805 --> 00:13:20,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, Mr. Fallon.

147
00:13:24,027 --> 00:13:44,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Before you begin, Mr. Farrellin, I just want to say that just as a segue, listening to your voices and your perspectives as to what the CTE pathways and programs have meant to you and to have the freshman perspective of the importance of doing the exploratories and the fact that

148
00:13:45,398 --> 00:13:53,783
[SPEAKER_06]: we have a comprehensive high school that has been able to provide this sort of learning environment and experience for our students is really quite special.

149
00:13:54,343 --> 00:14:08,211
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I appreciate that you took the time to share a little bit of that with us and inform us as we engage in a really important conversation around CTE programming and the lottery process.

150
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:13,695
[SPEAKER_06]: And so Mr. Fallon is going to explain to us a little bit of the regulation that this

151
00:14:14,624 --> 00:14:21,646
[SPEAKER_06]: board of education has come down with in terms of how we're assigning students to career technical education programs.

152
00:14:23,246 --> 00:14:24,207
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know Ms.

153
00:14:25,147 --> 00:14:29,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Sheila Freitas-Haley is here and works a lot in partnership with Mr. Fallon.

154
00:14:29,488 --> 00:14:30,788
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you both very much.

155
00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:33,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Floor is yours.

156
00:15:12,803 --> 00:15:13,143
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

157
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:16,726
[SPEAKER_00]: A little feedback there.

158
00:15:16,946 --> 00:15:24,452
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam Mayor, you should know that they got a real kick out of seeing you in your element because they knew you when they were younger and they were like, wow, it's really fun to see her now as the mayor.

159
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:26,574
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was cool to be part of.

160
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:28,395
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you everyone.

161
00:15:29,816 --> 00:15:32,719
[SPEAKER_00]: I am here tonight to talk about the new regulations.

162
00:15:33,687 --> 00:15:39,536
[SPEAKER_00]: that will be in effect for this school year regarding a lottery for admissions into career technical schools across the state.

163
00:15:40,577 --> 00:15:45,244
[SPEAKER_00]: So in May, the Board of Education did vote to adopt a lottery

164
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:55,815
[SPEAKER_00]: for admissions, I guess I don't need to stand that close, for admission into CTE schools, regional vocational technical high schools and for programs.

165
00:15:56,476 --> 00:16:06,624
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do want to share some information with you tonight specifically about that and share our thoughts on where we think we want to move in the direction for this school year because the regulations do begin this year.

166
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:09,228
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to walk you through a few things tonight.

167
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:16,674
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to frame it, an admissions lottery is necessary in programs or in schools when you have more applicants than you have seats.

168
00:16:17,455 --> 00:16:24,300
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember over the last three years, we've had about anywhere from 30 to 50 students on wait lists here in Medford alone.

169
00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:30,165
[SPEAKER_00]: And about 30 to 40 of them are students who didn't get any of their programs.

170
00:16:30,725 --> 00:16:36,750
[SPEAKER_00]: Another 20 to 30 are students who didn't get their first or second choice and maybe were placed in one of their other choices.

171
00:16:38,467 --> 00:16:48,471
[SPEAKER_00]: The Department of Education is also looking that we reinvest our time and energy to work with middle school students to provide them information on pathways and access for high school.

172
00:16:49,452 --> 00:16:57,415
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that the policy that you may read out there now is really geared more towards the regional vocational high schools that have sending communities.

173
00:16:58,275 --> 00:16:59,296
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have that issue here.

174
00:16:59,376 --> 00:17:02,537
[SPEAKER_00]: We are welcomed in the middle schools and we have a great partnership.

175
00:17:02,597 --> 00:17:05,378
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really don't need to have an extensive plan.

176
00:17:05,398 --> 00:17:06,759
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plan will really just outline

177
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:13,753
[SPEAKER_00]: the open houses that we do, and the work that we're gonna do in the middle schools beginning in seventh grade, and some course selection information.

178
00:17:17,715 --> 00:17:33,342
[SPEAKER_00]: So beginning in this school year, for the 25-26 school year, we are proposing that students at the conclusion of the CTE exploratory rotation, which will be in January, that they're gonna still continue to rank their top three choices,

179
00:17:34,435 --> 00:17:39,482
[SPEAKER_00]: but that for programs that have more student interest than seats available, we will employ a lottery.

180
00:17:40,744 --> 00:17:50,939
[SPEAKER_00]: Students will still be placed on wait lists or we'll have the option to choose a program that has space available and students will be selected from the wait list up until the end of first quarter and sophomore year.

181
00:17:52,932 --> 00:18:01,858
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing to keep in mind, if we have programs that do not fill on the first time around, students can opt into that program as well.

182
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:06,081
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're only gonna have to institute wait lists on programs that fill up.

183
00:18:06,602 --> 00:18:11,665
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's a program that has 20 seats and there's 18 students who sign up, then that program will not be on a wait list.

184
00:18:11,765 --> 00:18:13,486
[SPEAKER_00]: All 18 students would get that program.

185
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:20,031
[SPEAKER_00]: The state gives a few options with this and

186
00:18:22,845 --> 00:18:30,735
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't feel it best to do an admission in grade nine before they came in because a lot of reasons, mainly because of the work we've done to integrate both schools.

187
00:18:30,795 --> 00:18:35,641
[SPEAKER_00]: We really didn't feel it was appropriate to have an application or an admissions policy for grade nine for kids to enter.

188
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:41,608
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're choosing the option of program placement, which is right in line with our neighboring communities.

189
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:44,971
[SPEAKER_00]: Somerville, Peabody, Quincy, Cambridge.

190
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:47,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's doing pretty much a straight lottery.

191
00:18:47,773 --> 00:18:51,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may decide to do a weighted lottery, which is also an option.

192
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:55,558
[SPEAKER_00]: We have decided or are proposing to not do a weighted lottery.

193
00:18:55,578 --> 00:19:00,021
[SPEAKER_00]: We feel like a straight lottery would probably be the most beneficial and fair process.

194
00:19:03,957 --> 00:19:06,619
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned a little bit about the middle school exploration policy.

195
00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:09,401
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a document that I have drafted and we will share.

196
00:19:09,921 --> 00:19:12,323
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been shared with you and we'll share with the state.

197
00:19:12,363 --> 00:19:18,707
[SPEAKER_00]: It really just outlines the work that we're going to continue to do in middle school to help kids understand the programs that are available to them in Medford.

198
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:23,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick enrollment update to give you an idea of where we're at today.

199
00:19:24,874 --> 00:19:27,296
[SPEAKER_00]: We have just about 280 freshmen.

200
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:32,120
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about 318 in the freshman class, about 280 of them are in exploratory now.

201
00:19:33,221 --> 00:19:37,004
[SPEAKER_00]: The high school enrollment right now is at about 763 and 469 students in grades 10 through 12 are in a CTE pathway.

202
00:19:37,024 --> 00:19:39,005
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes up the 1,200 students in the school right now.

203
00:19:46,555 --> 00:19:50,798
[SPEAKER_00]: The number to keep in mind here for grade 10, we have 181 seats.

204
00:19:52,920 --> 00:20:07,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years ago, that would have been 145, but because of the additional seats we were able to add last year, hiring a fourth teacher, a third teacher in culinary, a third teacher in auto tech, we've been able to expand some access for students in those programs.

205
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:23,651
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next steps are to hopefully get an approval of our admissions policy that's been shared with you, or time to have me come back and speak more if there's questions, an approval of the middle school exploration policy.

206
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:28,696
[SPEAKER_00]: And both of those documents will need to be sent to the Department of Ed after we have your seal of approval.

207
00:20:29,998 --> 00:20:39,661
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next step after we decide which option we're going to move forward with, with your blessing, really the communication plan will begin.

208
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:46,983
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll begin reaching out to the community, speaking to parents, speaking to seventh and eighth grade students to make sure everyone understands what this is gonna look like moving forward.

209
00:20:47,783 --> 00:20:53,685
[SPEAKER_00]: More importantly, working with families of grade nine students right now to let them know what is on the horizon for this school year.

210
00:21:00,242 --> 00:21:00,662
[SPEAKER_11]: questions.

211
00:21:11,628 --> 00:21:11,989
[SPEAKER_04]: We can share.

212
00:21:18,988 --> 00:21:19,748
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for this.

213
00:21:20,469 --> 00:21:33,954
[SPEAKER_14]: I, I think, overall, this plan makes sense and I think there's a lot of complications with weighted admissions that have been talked about in the

214
00:21:35,434 --> 00:21:38,716
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm supportive of these policies.

215
00:21:39,236 --> 00:21:49,101
[SPEAKER_14]: I would ask that we really think carefully about the communication plan because I do think it has left lots of questions over time with families.

216
00:21:49,221 --> 00:21:54,223
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think what we heard from students is I didn't know you could go to the book and go to college.

217
00:21:54,644 --> 00:21:56,024
[SPEAKER_14]: And I have heard in, you know,

218
00:22:00,246 --> 00:22:06,588
[SPEAKER_14]: meetings, like, that may have been what was true when you were in school, but it's not true anymore.

219
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:09,870
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's the end of the sentence and the end of the statement.

220
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:14,031
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think parents leave going, well, why isn't it true?

221
00:22:14,111 --> 00:22:15,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, what does that mean?

222
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:16,712
[SPEAKER_14]: What what are my choices?

223
00:22:16,812 --> 00:22:24,235
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think there's an opportunity to enhance the communication so people can really understand what the programs have to offer.

224
00:22:24,935 --> 00:22:27,016
[SPEAKER_14]: And like, what

225
00:22:27,436 --> 00:22:31,399
[SPEAKER_14]: typical pathways look like in and out of the programs.

226
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:39,746
[SPEAKER_14]: And the other thing I would ask is that we think about carefully about the ninth grade decision, like it's happening earlier in the year than two years ago.

227
00:22:39,766 --> 00:22:51,835
[SPEAKER_14]: I would personally like to see us spend more time exploring before we ask ninth graders to sort of pick a track forever, but we can talk about that in future years.

228
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:56,079
[SPEAKER_14]: But what I would like to make sure that we do is really think carefully about

229
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:23,397
[SPEAKER_14]: how we inform families about this decision because I think that has I think it has always come from a place of people who know a lot about the process and one you know a lot about a process you tend to skip over the like really basic questions that people have that then they don't get answers to and they wonder about so I think there's just an opportunity to tighten up some of the language that we use so that people who only think about the VOC in terms of like how they

230
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:36,848
[SPEAKER_14]: saw it or experienced it or didn't experience it when they were kids themselves can like really help their students think and evaluate the decision so that students can go to school prepared to like make those choices for themselves.

231
00:23:36,908 --> 00:23:48,478
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think they're just some communication opportunities for us to clear up and I'm like really excited to see the like intentional ask about helping middle school families understand that because I think

232
00:23:49,399 --> 00:24:04,649
[SPEAKER_14]: The vocational programs have so much to offer that when parents are thinking about high school and where they want to send their children to high school, there is no other place where you can go and learn 18 different

233
00:24:05,718 --> 00:24:09,922
[SPEAKER_14]: things, right, that is available to most of our students.

234
00:24:10,002 --> 00:24:28,261
[SPEAKER_14]: So understanding what that could look like and doing a good job communicating that I think just has huge potential to help people understand like why they should really seriously consider sending their kids to Medford High if they want their kids to have lots of exposure to that kind of opportunity.

235
00:24:29,546 --> 00:24:42,055
[SPEAKER_14]: So I can connect with you offline, but I just think talking to some parents who haven't been through the process would probably be very helpful in like sort of driving out those questions that seem to like linger for people.

236
00:24:45,758 --> 00:24:46,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, member Graham.

237
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:48,419
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna go one mic at a time.

238
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,001
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me turn yours back on.

239
00:24:50,421 --> 00:24:50,801
[SPEAKER_05]: One second.

240
00:24:50,821 --> 00:24:51,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, you gotta press the button.

241
00:24:52,983 --> 00:24:57,126
[SPEAKER_05]: This is... Mr. Fallon.

242
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:58,880
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

243
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,161
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to respond.

244
00:25:00,181 --> 00:25:02,421
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've shared with Dr. Galusi some plans.

245
00:25:03,422 --> 00:25:14,766
[SPEAKER_00]: The good thing about this year, especially given that this lottery is new, the way the calendar works now, knock on wood, no snow days until January or February at least, the last rotation ends the day before winter break.

246
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:21,328
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have an opportunity where when students are leaving before the vacation, they're gonna be going home with a lot of information.

247
00:25:22,008 --> 00:25:28,050
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff will be sent from me, it'll be sent, parents will have information, and then we have some time, we don't have

248
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,971
[SPEAKER_00]: to place students right away in January.

249
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:41,656
[SPEAKER_00]: We could extend exploratory for a week or for 10 days to do some activities that I did just share with Dr. Glusi about really what you said, career planning and understanding what this decision means.

250
00:25:41,716 --> 00:25:50,480
[SPEAKER_00]: Because my goal, while it's to have kids pick a program that they truly enjoy, it's also to help kids who aren't sure that they don't pick the wrong program.

251
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,883
[SPEAKER_00]: Because essentially this could get difficult and we're gonna have people who don't get into programs that desperately want them.

252
00:25:56,812 --> 00:26:03,157
[SPEAKER_00]: My job and our job at the school is to really help kids understand what you want and what you may not want.

253
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:10,062
[SPEAKER_00]: And to help them understand, don't pick a program because your friends pick it because that, you know, you may have 14 other people waiting to get in.

254
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:15,786
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hear you and I'd be interested to meet with you and others to figure out what the best plan is.

255
00:26:15,846 --> 00:26:20,309
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dr. Galusi knows we've been kind of waiting for some decisions and then the communication will start.

256
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:21,650
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.

257
00:26:24,245 --> 00:26:25,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it okay if I expand upon that?

258
00:26:26,746 --> 00:26:42,690
[SPEAKER_06]: So I did just want to note, and I think that's why it was so important too, to hear this perspective from some of the students who didn't, the rotations had you realize that you thought you were going in and maybe were going to want to

259
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:56,454
[SPEAKER_06]: wind up in one shop and then the rotations had you realize that oh wait a minute I'm really aligned to the work that's going on here and I want to explore this a little bit more and this is you know where my interests lie.

260
00:26:56,494 --> 00:26:59,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that is part of the reason why we're so

261
00:27:00,321 --> 00:27:13,955
[SPEAKER_06]: purposeful in wanting to make sure that this lottery is in grade nine after the rotations, so that there's some context in the decision making and that we're not creating any sort of barrier to opportunity for our students.

262
00:27:14,395 --> 00:27:15,416
[SPEAKER_06]: And the second piece is,

263
00:27:16,572 --> 00:27:17,252
[SPEAKER_06]: to make sure that we're doing this.

264
00:27:17,273 --> 00:27:18,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Um for the communication.

265
00:27:18,413 --> 00:27:30,262
[SPEAKER_06]: We do want to make sure 100% and we also want to make sure that we're doing this in varied modalities, so there will be mailings and newsletters and emails and we'll use our district wide.

266
00:27:31,262 --> 00:27:32,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Platforms to do so.

267
00:27:32,523 --> 00:27:32,563
[SPEAKER_06]: So

268
00:27:42,148 --> 00:27:50,933
[SPEAKER_06]: and via Zoom informational sessions so that we're also providing that opportunity to come and listen, ask your questions.

269
00:27:51,607 --> 00:28:05,911
[SPEAKER_06]: hear about the programs, and to your point, learn all of the specific details of what it means to make the decision to go into CTE for the rest of ninth grade, grades 10, 11, and 12.

270
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:07,051
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a big commitment.

271
00:28:07,671 --> 00:28:08,512
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a big decision.

272
00:28:09,232 --> 00:28:14,353
[SPEAKER_06]: And students as well as caregivers 100% need to know what that entails.

273
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:16,034
[SPEAKER_06]: And we,

274
00:28:16,934 --> 00:28:21,716
[SPEAKER_06]: we want to make sure that we're providing a little bit more detailed information moving forward.

275
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:29,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

276
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Reinfeld and then member and Topper.

277
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:36,043
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we I think we have a student who would like to speak to defer to a student.

278
00:28:37,824 --> 00:28:38,425
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

279
00:28:38,505 --> 00:28:40,026
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep trying to defer and you're not letting me.

280
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:41,266
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

281
00:28:41,446 --> 00:28:50,692
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've, can you say a little bit about how the rankings and the lottery interface, is it a lottery for everyone's first choice?

282
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:58,537
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, cause I see a lot of codependencies here on how that works and we don't have to get into the exact combinatorics of it all, but.

283
00:29:01,952 --> 00:29:11,546
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, I think, something at least that needs to be addressed with students in saying, if I'm ranking it this way, how does that preference work?

284
00:29:11,626 --> 00:29:13,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the dimension is challenging.

285
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:22,655
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of a platform, I need to figure out what we will be using.

286
00:29:23,035 --> 00:29:25,017
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different things we can use.

287
00:29:25,357 --> 00:29:31,200
[SPEAKER_00]: The good news is all of us comprehensive high schools meet together a couple of times a month, so we'll be sharing best practice.

288
00:29:32,281 --> 00:29:39,525
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, the plan is that we'll still have students rank, but let's use electrical for an example, a program that always fills up.

289
00:29:40,006 --> 00:29:43,268
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have 20 seats and there are 40 students and that's their first choice,

290
00:29:43,688 --> 00:29:47,595
[SPEAKER_00]: a lottery will be based on those 40 students for that program.

291
00:29:48,557 --> 00:29:52,664
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll go and order first choice for every program and see where we end up.

292
00:29:53,386 --> 00:29:56,611
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we need to go to a second choice lottery, we'll go there.

293
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:58,816
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could give you more.

294
00:29:59,216 --> 00:30:01,178
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually what I was looking for.

295
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:01,858
[SPEAKER_00]: This is new.

296
00:30:01,918 --> 00:30:02,919
[SPEAKER_00]: This is new for me, too.

297
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:07,542
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to be calling on Will to help me with the lottery because he's been through this at the middle school.

298
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:08,323
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

299
00:30:09,444 --> 00:30:09,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

300
00:30:09,744 --> 00:30:25,595
[SPEAKER_07]: I was also hoping you could speak briefly about why the weighted system, why a weighted lottery doesn't feel like the right choice, because one of the things that I have heard around this is, well, should we be prioritizing career intent over

301
00:30:27,683 --> 00:30:34,671
[SPEAKER_07]: doing this for fun, I agree, not because our friends are doing it, but so what led to that decision?

302
00:30:34,711 --> 00:30:39,417
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there are pros and cons of each and I'd like to hear more about why you're making this recommendation.

303
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:51,812
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason I believe that the state has made this decision is because selective criteria doesn't always work and it's not fair.

304
00:30:51,832 --> 00:30:58,817
[SPEAKER_00]: I always hated, I was director of admissions at a school prior to this and we would receive a thousand applications for 500 seats.

305
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:06,943
[SPEAKER_00]: If a student made a mistake in 7th grade and had one suspension, that could limit their chances from ever being part of a vocational program.

306
00:31:07,263 --> 00:31:13,088
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar with attendance, if they look at 7th and 8th grade data, that doesn't necessarily represent the same child in grade 9.

307
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:30,084
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we looked at the weighted option, attendance and discipline, any suspensions, I think I can safely say that kind of around like-minded people, we were talking about it and we just didn't like the idea of a selective criteria.

308
00:31:30,204 --> 00:31:37,006
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought that this, in a situation where no one is ever gonna be 100% happy, this felt like the best option right now.

309
00:31:37,106 --> 00:31:38,066
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, we can change it.

310
00:31:38,107 --> 00:31:41,768
[SPEAKER_00]: If we decide year one, we don't like it, we're gonna have to update this yearly with the Department of Education.

311
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:44,349
[SPEAKER_00]: we may decide that we want to change it.

312
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:55,193
[SPEAKER_00]: For right now, you know, kind of the people around the table, we all, I think, had a common feeling that we didn't want to use selective criteria such as attendance for something like this.

313
00:31:57,915 --> 00:32:05,038
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm finding is that most schools, like even, you know, one of the biggest regional vocationals around, they're also doing a straight lottery.

314
00:32:05,078 --> 00:32:05,498
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think

315
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:12,911
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're all feeling like this is the best way to go because it feels the most fair.

316
00:32:13,856 --> 00:32:22,023
[SPEAKER_07]: And I appreciate that because it wasn't necessarily clear what the weighting factors would be, whether it was a positive factor or a disqualifying factor.

317
00:32:22,043 --> 00:32:22,603
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

318
00:32:22,963 --> 00:32:23,824
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have explained it better.

319
00:32:23,864 --> 00:32:29,268
[SPEAKER_00]: So attendance, they're looking at the year previous to application.

320
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:34,192
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything less than 27 days out would allow you another chance in the lottery.

321
00:32:34,993 --> 00:32:37,895
[SPEAKER_00]: Discipline would be a 37 H and a half in fraction.

322
00:32:38,295 --> 00:32:41,018
[SPEAKER_00]: That would, if you didn't have one of those, you would have another weight in the lottery.

323
00:32:41,698 --> 00:32:41,958
[SPEAKER_00]: And then,

324
00:32:42,879 --> 00:33:01,695
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the Department of Ed gave this kind of other option that if we wanted to have an interview or a recommendation from a guidance Councilor or something other like interest, did this student attend an open house or did they, you know, we felt like it was a little bit out there.

325
00:33:02,275 --> 00:33:04,898
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't really know that that was the best way to move forward.

326
00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:06,862
[SPEAKER_00]: So that those are the qualifiers.

327
00:33:07,103 --> 00:33:08,827
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that background.

328
00:33:09,449 --> 00:33:12,256
[SPEAKER_07]: And then how are we doing on our wait lists?

329
00:33:12,316 --> 00:33:12,938
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess we don't.

330
00:33:13,886 --> 00:33:17,148
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know what this year's exploratory will lead to.

331
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:25,174
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't, but I can tell you our, so when I mentioned about, you know, 50 students on a wait list, we're down to 15 right now, which is kind of what we anticipated happening.

332
00:33:25,554 --> 00:33:27,556
[SPEAKER_00]: I have students coming off the wait list tomorrow.

333
00:33:28,376 --> 00:33:30,798
[SPEAKER_00]: Things change, people move, people change their minds.

334
00:33:30,918 --> 00:33:35,862
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been able to bring kids in right up until still, you know, we'll have some more starting tomorrow.

335
00:33:35,902 --> 00:33:38,003
[SPEAKER_00]: So the wait list is much better.

336
00:33:38,023 --> 00:33:40,865
[SPEAKER_00]: And can I share a little something with the crew?

337
00:33:41,826 --> 00:33:43,327
[SPEAKER_00]: We did, what's that?

338
00:33:44,284 --> 00:33:45,466
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that was intentional, really.

339
00:33:46,747 --> 00:33:50,653
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, I got the acknowledgement today.

340
00:33:50,853 --> 00:33:52,375
[SPEAKER_00]: We've applied for two new programs.

341
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:57,562
[SPEAKER_00]: We have decided to open plumbing sooner than anticipated because the need is there.

342
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:12,548
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the Department of Ed has recognized my intent and they are inviting us to go to part A of the four-part process for plumbing and information systems and support services for the FY 26-27 school year.

343
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:14,290
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned for that.

344
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:20,015
[SPEAKER_00]: So inevitably, we're looking at a wait list like we have every year, but we now know we're gonna have

345
00:34:20,335 --> 00:34:22,816
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, maybe 30 additional seats available.

346
00:34:22,856 --> 00:34:26,356
[SPEAKER_00]: So the time is now, Dr. Galussi and I sat, Ms.

347
00:34:26,376 --> 00:34:30,017
[SPEAKER_00]: Freitas-Haley, we all put our heads together and said, how can we make this happen sooner than later?

348
00:34:30,417 --> 00:34:31,397
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the plan.

349
00:34:31,597 --> 00:34:32,018
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned.

350
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:34,358
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fantastic news.

351
00:34:35,058 --> 00:34:43,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there any way to preview it for the people currently in rotation to experience some presentation?

352
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,501
[SPEAKER_07]: I get that we can't get in there into a shop because it's not up and running, but

353
00:34:48,901 --> 00:34:52,664
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really, because the process will really end in June with the Department of Education.

354
00:34:52,704 --> 00:34:57,427
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to think that we're going to be approved, but I've had to find some space in a very old building.

355
00:34:57,527 --> 00:34:58,748
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned for that.

356
00:34:59,688 --> 00:35:00,769
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we did find some space.

357
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:04,672
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, anywhere that there was running water.

358
00:35:07,093 --> 00:35:16,259
[SPEAKER_00]: So my goal would be for next year to have an exploratory, and then the year after take in another group of exploratory.

359
00:35:16,299 --> 00:35:17,240
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll add each year.

360
00:35:18,419 --> 00:35:19,301
[SPEAKER_00]: in a perfect world.

361
00:35:19,481 --> 00:35:22,348
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you remember, through MSBA, we applied for plumbing and HVAC.

362
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:29,213
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we're ready for HVAC, but plumbing, we definitely, you know, we know the students that go to Minuteman right now are going for plumbing.

363
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:30,633
[SPEAKER_00]: We know this, we know it's been for years.

364
00:35:31,634 --> 00:35:46,339
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of waiting for the new building, we decided to just do plumbing, hold off on HVAC, and when we're in the new space, hopefully in five years or so, that we'll have four to five years of plumbers under our belt that we can now have a thriving program to bring in HVAC.

365
00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:52,021
[SPEAKER_00]: So if all works out and we're in some new space, you know, five or six years, we'll already have a headstart on the program.

366
00:35:52,761 --> 00:35:52,841
[SPEAKER_00]: that.

367
00:35:52,861 --> 00:35:53,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Finding a teacher.

368
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:54,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Another story.

369
00:35:55,704 --> 00:35:56,405
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're hopeful.

370
00:35:57,046 --> 00:35:57,346
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

371
00:35:57,626 --> 00:35:57,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

372
00:36:14,013 --> 00:36:15,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for the really good news.

373
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:25,879
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually I was actually just at an event, talking with a parent about why don't we have plumbing and what are the differences and what's what's the deal with that so that's really cool to hear that we have pulling this away.

374
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,921
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a lot, and we have the means to hopefully support that.

375
00:36:31,562 --> 00:36:39,405
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really happy to see that we have chosen to go instead of the sort of eighth grade rotation and looking at stuff, we're actually going to the ninth grade.

376
00:36:40,525 --> 00:36:48,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, I was just going to really reiterate the importance of going through the rotation and seeing you know what your options are and what everything happens you know there's this difference between.

377
00:36:49,568 --> 00:37:00,375
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, theoretical career paths and applied career paths and folks going through it and saying, well, actually, I really, I really liked the problem solving of culinary more than I ever thought I'd like, you know, this and that.

378
00:37:00,475 --> 00:37:07,160
[SPEAKER_08]: So seeing that, that this, that's the driving factor behind that is awesome.

379
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:13,905
[SPEAKER_08]: I also love the ideology behind the thought of not doing a weighted weightless lottery system.

380
00:37:15,711 --> 00:37:18,414
[SPEAKER_08]: that, sorry, the ringing is insane.

381
00:37:19,776 --> 00:37:27,344
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we talk a lot about, you know, we've heard from students and we've heard from other folks that the vote brings a sense of belonging that actually increases retention among students.

382
00:37:27,364 --> 00:37:32,951
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, once students are doing the things that they love and doing that sort of, you know, it's kind of what the CCSR pushes.

383
00:37:32,971 --> 00:37:34,012
[SPEAKER_08]: It is what the CCR pushes.

384
00:37:34,092 --> 00:37:38,916
[SPEAKER_08]: project-based learning, and when you learn the thing that you wanna learn, your retention goes, and that drives student success.

385
00:37:38,976 --> 00:37:50,985
[SPEAKER_08]: And so for students who maybe don't feel that sense of belonging in school, didn't feel that sense of belonging in middle school because academia, like straight path academia wasn't for them, why put that against them to be admitted into the VOC?

386
00:37:51,045 --> 00:37:57,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the VOC hopefully is what will help fix that and help fix the lack of that sense of belonging.

387
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:01,733
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we also, part of Member Graham's point of,

388
00:38:02,988 --> 00:38:06,649
[SPEAKER_08]: talking about what a modern day vocational school looks like.

389
00:38:06,729 --> 00:38:11,330
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, the whole thing of my graduation speaker said the same thing, you know, they said, I go to the voc, I won't go to college.

390
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:12,970
[SPEAKER_08]: I said, I won't go to voc, I won't go to college.

391
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:22,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I've been accepted to all nine colleges that I applied to and was accepted in, you know, with huge financial aid packages, because the voc isn't just an end part for people.

392
00:38:22,452 --> 00:38:24,973
[SPEAKER_08]: It is oftentimes a stepping stone into another career path.

393
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:26,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they're going to go into something else.

394
00:38:26,953 --> 00:38:37,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they learn, hey, culinary is where, how I got myself through high school, because high school, the four years of my life, and now I'm going to go pursue something else that we don't have as a program, like criminal justice, like psychology, like whatever.

395
00:38:38,521 --> 00:38:47,027
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think we also have to do an important part of advertising our programs that are maybe lesser enrolled, you know, looking at, I'm

396
00:38:47,828 --> 00:39:03,679
[SPEAKER_08]: very happy to see an increase in, uh, no surprise to, you know, graphic design and talking about how we need to look at, you know, for maybe the programs that maybe have a lesser wait list or have lesser enrollment, you know, talking about the advantages of what graphic design is, you know, we're doing the whole way finding study in the city.

397
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,740
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what a big part of wayfinding is?

398
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:13,223
[SPEAKER_08]: It's how it's designed and how people read through things and how people understand information, informational hierarchy, everything, zoning, everything.

399
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:18,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything is determined by how you design the language and the graphics to do it.

400
00:39:19,246 --> 00:39:22,908
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know if we're there yet, but I'd love to see that happening.

401
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:26,029
[SPEAKER_08]: And business marketing being a stepping stone for any career path.

402
00:39:26,049 --> 00:39:28,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever you decide to go to, you want to open your own business?

403
00:39:28,431 --> 00:39:30,912
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't do that if you don't know how to market yourself or run a business.

404
00:39:31,863 --> 00:39:45,415
[SPEAKER_08]: know, we have two people in there now six, nine, you know, it's going down a little bit, but these are the things that we need to be doing to push, you know, as that stepping stone, maybe the vote is sort of like an associate's degree, pushing up whatever bachelors you go to, but if you don't do that, and that's fine.

405
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:46,516
[SPEAKER_08]: One or the other.

406
00:39:46,576 --> 00:39:51,821
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's sort of the ramp that I had in terms of this, but I'm really happy to see where this is.

407
00:39:52,001 --> 00:39:53,042
[SPEAKER_08]: This is moving forward.

408
00:39:54,523 --> 00:39:58,386
[SPEAKER_08]: and what we're doing transforming the vocational program in-house.

409
00:39:58,426 --> 00:40:04,271
[SPEAKER_08]: So really appreciate all the efforts that you and your staff and faculty are all, and students are all doing today.

410
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:04,791
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

411
00:40:06,052 --> 00:40:07,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, member Atapa.

412
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:11,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you mind passing the mic back to our student, Alachi?

413
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:17,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, one second.

414
00:40:17,969 --> 00:40:21,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me, that's member Graham's mic on.

415
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:23,550
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, apologies.

416
00:40:24,431 --> 00:40:26,751
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Reinfeld graciously answered our question.

417
00:40:27,311 --> 00:40:29,572
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for your time.

418
00:40:29,832 --> 00:40:30,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

419
00:40:32,453 --> 00:40:34,533
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, thank you very much for the presentation.

420
00:40:34,553 --> 00:40:36,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we, oh, member Olapade.

421
00:40:37,194 --> 00:40:38,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, member Olapade.

422
00:40:40,584 --> 00:40:40,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

423
00:40:41,004 --> 00:40:44,308
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a quick question about the eligibility in the draft you provided us.

424
00:40:44,888 --> 00:40:54,157
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know that you mentioned that students that are promoted into the program is conditional based off of their ability to seek the following grade.

425
00:40:54,558 --> 00:40:57,981
[SPEAKER_09]: For students that, for example, aren't able to seek the following grade and they need to

426
00:40:59,362 --> 00:41:10,189
[SPEAKER_09]: repeat a year, does that remove their eligibility to reapply to the program, as well as how does that impact the, I know for eighth grade, at the very least, it's March is when the selection process begins in the lottery.

427
00:41:10,689 --> 00:41:18,713
[SPEAKER_09]: How does that, does that impact the rest of the lottery system at all if a student is not determined to be unable to seek the next grade yet, but they will be eventually?

428
00:41:18,814 --> 00:41:19,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that question make sense?

429
00:41:35,432 --> 00:41:36,860
[SPEAKER_00]: it would not impact their chances.

430
00:41:38,353 --> 00:41:42,956
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year there might be a student or two who needs to do some more work.

431
00:41:43,176 --> 00:41:47,860
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we let them either go through exploratory again, or we let them pursue different programs up until now.

432
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,963
[SPEAKER_00]: Things will be different with the lottery, but I don't ever see us saying no to somebody, you know.

433
00:41:52,223 --> 00:41:54,224
[SPEAKER_00]: We do the same thing for students who come into the district late.

434
00:41:54,324 --> 00:41:57,687
[SPEAKER_00]: If they haven't had a chance to explore the programs, we let them do it again up until they're ready.

435
00:41:58,107 --> 00:42:06,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now it's a little different because we don't have a lottery, but I would never, if somebody needs that extra time, I would absolutely open them back up to the process.

436
00:42:06,213 --> 00:42:06,453
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.

437
00:42:06,553 --> 00:42:07,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

438
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,261
[SPEAKER_05]: have a question?

439
00:42:18,144 --> 00:42:20,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to approve the first reading of policy.

440
00:42:20,706 --> 00:42:25,670
[SPEAKER_11]: J. F. A. A. Chapter 74 program emissions policy.

441
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:30,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Before the rolls called.

442
00:42:30,374 --> 00:42:32,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like to say something, Dr Lucy?

443
00:42:32,636 --> 00:42:32,856
[SPEAKER_06]: I can.

444
00:42:34,117 --> 00:42:34,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

445
00:42:34,657 --> 00:42:35,258
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that.

446
00:42:35,298 --> 00:42:35,618
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want.

447
00:42:35,858 --> 00:42:37,480
[SPEAKER_06]: I certainly don't want to derail the vote.

448
00:42:38,732 --> 00:42:46,774
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to first thank Mr. Fallon, but I also wanted to just comment on some of the pieces that the members were commenting on.

449
00:42:46,794 --> 00:43:02,458
[SPEAKER_06]: I think one of the key pieces here is just in the way that we decided to make decisions about the lottery is our instructional vision that guides our work for the district does have an equity statement in there about making sure that we are

450
00:43:03,678 --> 00:43:24,416
[SPEAKER_06]: opening up opportunities for students and we're providing them access so that they can reach their full potential and for some of our students that is through the CTE pathway and so we feel that the best way to make sure we're doing that and not creating barriers and making sure that we're holding up our instructional vision for the district is to make sure that we're doing the lottery

451
00:43:25,813 --> 00:43:34,375
[SPEAKER_06]: in the ninth grade so that we're giving that opportunity for students to explore the electives and then go through the lottery piece.

452
00:43:36,695 --> 00:43:41,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, I thank you very much, and I appreciate your partnership in this very important matter.

453
00:43:46,037 --> 00:43:46,757
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Branley.

454
00:43:50,058 --> 00:43:52,078
[SPEAKER_15]: The Bistro opens tomorrow to the public, correct?

455
00:43:55,047 --> 00:43:58,389
[SPEAKER_15]: The Bistro opens tomorrow to the public, 8 a.m.

456
00:43:58,409 --> 00:43:58,449
[SPEAKER_15]: to 12.45.

457
00:43:58,789 --> 00:44:00,870
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, go.

458
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:01,790
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody go.

459
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:02,591
[SPEAKER_15]: It's good.

460
00:44:02,871 --> 00:44:04,832
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, it's good, it's fun, it's great.

461
00:44:05,032 --> 00:44:06,192
[SPEAKER_15]: So, okay, that was it.

462
00:44:06,532 --> 00:44:07,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, didn't mean to steal your thunder.

463
00:44:09,254 --> 00:44:10,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Member Brindley.

464
00:44:10,254 --> 00:44:11,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Fallon.

465
00:44:11,535 --> 00:44:16,277
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna move approval by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Reinfeld.

466
00:44:16,297 --> 00:44:17,637
[SPEAKER_05]: You want a roll call?

467
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:18,778
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

468
00:44:19,118 --> 00:44:19,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

469
00:44:19,558 --> 00:44:20,379
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

470
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:21,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

471
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:22,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful.

472
00:44:26,489 --> 00:44:29,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up, we have member Graham.

473
00:44:31,473 --> 00:44:39,220
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we motion to waive the second reading so that we can pass this and move forward?

474
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:44,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to waive the second reading by member Graham, seconded by member Reinfeld.

475
00:44:45,885 --> 00:44:46,706
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

476
00:44:47,666 --> 00:44:48,487
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

477
00:44:49,428 --> 00:44:51,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Second reading has been waived.

478
00:44:51,069 --> 00:44:53,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

479
00:44:54,533 --> 00:44:54,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

480
00:44:55,334 --> 00:44:57,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's keep the plumbers in house.

481
00:44:59,257 --> 00:44:59,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

482
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:02,360
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope my son follows that path in a few years.

483
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,220
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's great news.

484
00:45:04,681 --> 00:45:14,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up, we have an update to CCSR donation from the Cummings Foundation, Mr. Richard Trotta, director of the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

485
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:16,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome.

486
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:20,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

487
00:45:20,755 --> 00:45:21,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Great job.

488
00:45:27,573 --> 00:45:30,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for allowing me to give an update on the program.

489
00:45:33,757 --> 00:45:38,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I do that, I want to thank the funders for the program.

490
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:42,702
[SPEAKER_01]: The major funders, number one is Cummings Foundation.

491
00:45:43,062 --> 00:45:52,988
[SPEAKER_01]: They've given us a commitment of $460,000 that has basically supported the program most of the years we've been in existence.

492
00:45:54,313 --> 00:46:05,139
[SPEAKER_01]: The Crystal Campbell Community Benefit Project donated $165,000 for us to support the program.

493
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:13,363
[SPEAKER_01]: In one year, in fact, there was a gap between the Cummings money, the three-year grant, and the 10-year grant, and they funded the program for a year.

494
00:46:13,703 --> 00:46:17,785
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave us to continue the program without missing a beat.

495
00:46:19,786 --> 00:46:19,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Since 2013,

496
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:32,662
[SPEAKER_01]: These generous contributors enabled over 3,000 students to create over, let's see how many, 300 projects, basically.

497
00:46:32,762 --> 00:46:51,367
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an estimate over the time we've been doing this, but the impact clearly has been very broad, and in some cases, there have been situations where the students actually have excelled and actually become civic leaders in Medford.

498
00:46:53,324 --> 00:47:13,757
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to thank the school committee for the continual support over the years, particularly the central office people, Noel, Jerry, and Suzanne, and the superintendent, who's always been a supporter and has been very helpful in maintaining the program and advising us on how to maneuver through the system.

499
00:47:15,058 --> 00:47:20,722
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank our advisors and the staff in the program who actually make things happen.

500
00:47:21,162 --> 00:47:22,743
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the years, they've been a great

501
00:47:23,107 --> 00:47:30,012
[SPEAKER_01]: a tremendous group, and have been mentors to the students that have allowed them to do these great projects.

502
00:47:32,314 --> 00:47:35,836
[SPEAKER_01]: And most importantly, I wanna thank the students for their work over the years.

503
00:47:36,136 --> 00:47:44,843
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a lot of students go through, and their work is inspirational, and I believe they make the world a better place, which is our mantra.

504
00:47:45,483 --> 00:47:48,125
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanna make the world a better place, one student at a time.

505
00:47:55,185 --> 00:47:58,008
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to just clarify my role as grant manager.

506
00:47:58,028 --> 00:48:04,072
[SPEAKER_01]: I am in charge of creating and implementing the budget.

507
00:48:04,553 --> 00:48:12,779
[SPEAKER_01]: My role is to adhere to the guidelines of the grant and answer to the foundation for how the grant operates and how the money is spent.

508
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,542
[SPEAKER_01]: I maintain records and prepare annual reports.

509
00:48:17,743 --> 00:48:20,145
[SPEAKER_01]: I supervise the faculty and staff in the program.

510
00:48:20,165 --> 00:48:23,988
[SPEAKER_01]: I coordinate operations for all activities.

511
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:27,611
[SPEAKER_01]: and grant objectives and support student success.

512
00:48:30,392 --> 00:48:34,294
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are the main kinds of activities that grant manager does.

513
00:48:35,394 --> 00:48:43,277
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also meet, we have a visit every year to evaluate the program by a representative from the Cummings Foundation.

514
00:48:44,118 --> 00:48:49,880
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time we do this, they've always been very happy with the way things are operating.

515
00:48:52,861 --> 00:48:54,562
[SPEAKER_01]: So the budget, the proposed budget

516
00:48:55,467 --> 00:48:56,187
[SPEAKER_01]: is flexible.

517
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:58,868
[SPEAKER_01]: It's designed to adapt to student needs.

518
00:49:00,068 --> 00:49:08,790
[SPEAKER_01]: Faculty staff stipends remain the top priority as they sustain high quality after school programming and student engagement.

519
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:18,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Once school rosters are finalized and we know how many students we have, we can then decide, determine how many people we need on staff.

520
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:22,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Once that's done, then we can go to other areas and

521
00:49:23,182 --> 00:49:26,424
[SPEAKER_01]: fund those areas based on what money's left.

522
00:49:28,885 --> 00:49:39,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like mini grants, instructional materials, enrichment activities, professional development, guest speakers, field trips, are all subject to what happens with the staff.

523
00:49:40,831 --> 00:49:51,337
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my job, my responsibility to determine the best way to handle this in terms of money, what's best for the students, and what's the most effective way of

524
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:59,338
[SPEAKER_01]: promoting and offering students a truly enriching experience in this program.

525
00:50:00,678 --> 00:50:07,180
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a multi-year grant, which means that this grant we received this year is one of 10.

526
00:50:07,361 --> 00:50:11,262
[SPEAKER_01]: And the grant budget stays stable.

527
00:50:11,862 --> 00:50:14,403
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't close out end of the school year, it's open.

528
00:50:14,743 --> 00:50:15,824
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a multi-year grant.

529
00:50:16,124 --> 00:50:18,905
[SPEAKER_01]: So most years we have, almost every year we have a surplus.

530
00:50:19,862 --> 00:50:44,963
[SPEAKER_01]: which goes to the next year, which allows us flexibility to do things that may be not considered at first, but now because we have the fines and some interest has been provided that some students want to do something grandiose, a district-wide program, a principal has worked with an advisor and has a project that requires some extra money here and there, that's what happens.

531
00:50:47,305 --> 00:50:47,786
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of,

532
00:50:53,688 --> 00:51:13,776
[SPEAKER_01]: The closing point I want to make before I go through the budget is that what we promote is project-based learning, which is a methodology that allows students to make decisions about themselves, that allow them to select what they want to work on as a project.

533
00:51:14,618 --> 00:51:30,665
[SPEAKER_01]: and the advisors help them, they're advisors, they're not teachers in the sense they don't teach them, they let students design with their help the project, implement the project, and then complete the project and have some kind of demonstration of that project.

534
00:51:31,206 --> 00:51:32,806
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the school year,

535
00:51:34,437 --> 00:51:44,583
[SPEAKER_01]: provide you with a portfolio of all the projects and all the work the students have done so that it shows you that it indicates what benefit is to the students.

536
00:51:44,943 --> 00:51:47,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Truly can be life-changing events.

537
00:51:49,885 --> 00:51:51,706
[SPEAKER_01]: I have anecdotes, but I won't go through them now.

538
00:51:53,627 --> 00:52:01,672
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I want to point out is that by doing project-based learning, students develop leadership skills.

539
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:09,623
[SPEAKER_01]: They become compassionate leaders, because through and by helping other people, they learn to be more compassionate and more empathetic.

540
00:52:10,684 --> 00:52:21,846
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also stress that they are leaders, and we call them leaders, because they're going out into the world, into the schools, the district, making changes that can help other people.

541
00:52:22,826 --> 00:52:26,027
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes them feel good, and it helps them, and it also helps the community.

542
00:52:26,547 --> 00:52:31,648
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a really important point, that that kind of experience is life-changing sometimes.

543
00:52:32,172 --> 00:52:40,695
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're doing is we're creating students who, in the future, will do things to help other people and not just for self-interest.

544
00:52:41,516 --> 00:52:44,357
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's really the heart and soul of this program.

545
00:52:46,938 --> 00:52:52,680
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my overview, and I can go through the budget, but do I have any questions?

546
00:52:56,262 --> 00:52:56,982
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm so sorry.

547
00:52:57,002 --> 00:52:58,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you just say you were going to go?

548
00:52:58,303 --> 00:53:01,424
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to make sure that I'm just clarifying so that the,

549
00:53:02,564 --> 00:53:09,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Membership is aware that I just want to make sure we're going through what the budget is so that, is that what we're doing next?

550
00:53:09,647 --> 00:53:10,508
[SPEAKER_01]: That's next.

551
00:53:12,029 --> 00:53:12,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

552
00:53:13,829 --> 00:53:19,012
[SPEAKER_01]: So this projected budget is founded on this kind of thing.

553
00:53:19,032 --> 00:53:27,056
[SPEAKER_01]: So every, this year, the teachers, advisors, we call them advisors, they get $2,500 for the school year.

554
00:53:28,536 --> 00:53:31,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Each school has one full-time advisor this year.

555
00:53:33,237 --> 00:53:35,198
[SPEAKER_01]: There is money for an assistant advisor.

556
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:39,781
[SPEAKER_01]: If the number of the students exceeds 25 or 30 students, we hire an assistant.

557
00:53:43,163 --> 00:53:52,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, on average, we've been hiring sometimes three, sometimes four, but not every school requires an assistant.

558
00:53:53,249 --> 00:53:54,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it depends on numbers.

559
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:55,530
[SPEAKER_01]: We recruit.

560
00:53:55,791 --> 00:54:00,914
[SPEAKER_01]: We want all the students we can get, but we can't make them select us.

561
00:54:01,274 --> 00:54:02,795
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what they desire to do.

562
00:54:04,637 --> 00:54:05,778
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a list of advisors.

563
00:54:06,698 --> 00:54:08,159
[SPEAKER_01]: For the high school, it's Jen Silver.

564
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,020
[SPEAKER_01]: For the Andrews Middle, it's Melanie North.

565
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,322
[SPEAKER_01]: McGlynn Middle, Grace Turnbull-Barr.

566
00:54:16,062 --> 00:54:18,523
[SPEAKER_01]: Roberts, Janelle Garland-McKenzie.

567
00:54:19,463 --> 00:54:21,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Misutuk, Connor Hemel.

568
00:54:22,945 --> 00:54:25,106
[SPEAKER_01]: McGlynn Elementary, Nicola Napitano.

569
00:54:26,626 --> 00:54:27,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Brooks Lee Chasen.

570
00:54:29,162 --> 00:54:33,285
[SPEAKER_01]: And this year, the career staffs, which is really a wonderful thing.

571
00:54:33,325 --> 00:54:34,565
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had trouble getting advisors.

572
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:37,587
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an advisor at the career staffs, Colin Flynn.

573
00:54:38,228 --> 00:54:47,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, because it's a small school, the stepping is gonna be 1,500, but if it gets to 10 students or more, we bump it up to 2,500 students.

574
00:54:48,174 --> 00:54:55,238
[SPEAKER_01]: And so every school is covered, and we have what I think is an excellent staff this year, and I'm really looking forward to working with them.

575
00:54:57,579 --> 00:54:58,240
[SPEAKER_01]: So advisors,

576
00:54:59,603 --> 00:55:04,006
[SPEAKER_01]: category with what I just gave you without the assistance is $20,000.

577
00:55:04,506 --> 00:55:08,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have 35,000, at least 15,000 as a balance.

578
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:16,075
[SPEAKER_01]: I expect we might have a couple of advisors, assistant advisors added, but we won't know until we get the numbers.

579
00:55:18,937 --> 00:55:21,779
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have staff that support the program.

580
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:27,603
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a district coordinator, project coordinator, do you know, Garland McKenzie?

581
00:55:28,152 --> 00:55:47,728
[SPEAKER_01]: who works as the liaison for all the projects and serves as a support person, holds meetings, Zoom meetings once a month, and coordinates all the projects and helps them with the advisors with their projects and supporting them.

582
00:55:47,808 --> 00:55:56,815
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, she allows them to meet together to work as a team on projects outside of their school building.

583
00:55:58,767 --> 00:56:05,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Administrative system does all the purchase orders and purchasing is Mary Lorton.

584
00:56:05,772 --> 00:56:06,832
[SPEAKER_01]: She gets $1,200.

585
00:56:07,953 --> 00:56:10,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Memorial Gardens maintenance is Rebecca McGinnis.

586
00:56:10,995 --> 00:56:14,518
[SPEAKER_01]: She supports the vocational Memorial Garden and the high school Memorial Garden.

587
00:56:15,118 --> 00:56:19,281
[SPEAKER_01]: The one in front of the school with the plaque for Crystal Kimball.

588
00:56:29,657 --> 00:56:31,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, we have mini grants.

589
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:38,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, mini grants are grants given to classroom teachers to work with their students if they have a project after school.

590
00:56:38,585 --> 00:56:48,114
[SPEAKER_01]: They apply for that, they submit a proposal, and if I approve it, they get to do the mini grant after school on their own time, and they get a stipend.

591
00:56:48,234 --> 00:56:50,637
[SPEAKER_01]: It ranges from, depending on the project, it ranges from $500 to $1,000.

592
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:58,361
[SPEAKER_01]: We've allocated 2,000, but we don't know exactly that number yet.

593
00:56:58,581 --> 00:56:59,641
[SPEAKER_01]: We will determine later.

594
00:57:01,282 --> 00:57:05,383
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a web hosting service fee for Bluehost.

595
00:57:05,503 --> 00:57:09,503
[SPEAKER_01]: We have our own web page, which is what the foundation would like.

596
00:57:10,284 --> 00:57:10,944
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do that.

597
00:57:11,604 --> 00:57:15,325
[SPEAKER_01]: But the good news is, on the other side, it's student-managed.

598
00:57:15,425 --> 00:57:16,485
[SPEAKER_01]: We have students managing it.

599
00:57:16,505 --> 00:57:24,287
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a student project to manage the web page that gives them great experience and an opportunity to be the creator.

600
00:57:27,738 --> 00:57:31,960
[SPEAKER_01]: We allot $200 per school for some incidental supplies.

601
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:35,902
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be art supplies, paint.

602
00:57:36,463 --> 00:57:37,163
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be cups.

603
00:57:37,403 --> 00:57:39,224
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on whatever they need it for.

604
00:57:39,724 --> 00:57:40,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that money is allotted.

605
00:57:41,085 --> 00:57:42,906
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean it's used.

606
00:57:43,586 --> 00:57:46,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes it's not used, but it's there if they need it.

607
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:55,553
[SPEAKER_01]: As for operational supplies, things like toner for the printer, paper.

608
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,115
[SPEAKER_01]: folders, envelopes, things like that.

609
00:58:00,056 --> 00:58:12,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Subtotal, when you add all these up, is $30,000, which leaves $5,000 allotted to what we need for possibly and probably some assistance.

610
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:21,717
[SPEAKER_01]: If we stay within that budget, it ends up being $35,000, which is the projected budget for the school year.

611
00:58:23,952 --> 00:58:25,713
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my report.

612
00:58:26,034 --> 00:58:27,655
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be happy to answer any questions.

613
00:58:29,476 --> 00:58:29,997
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

614
00:58:30,377 --> 00:58:32,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for the update.

615
00:58:32,279 --> 00:58:33,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Well detailed budget.

616
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:34,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any questions?

617
00:58:35,021 --> 00:58:36,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham?

618
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:38,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, press it one more time.

619
00:58:38,543 --> 00:58:38,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

620
00:58:38,824 --> 00:58:41,346
Good.

621
00:58:41,426 --> 00:58:43,908
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm good.

622
00:58:47,962 --> 00:58:49,604
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll stand way back here because it's very loud.

623
00:58:50,524 --> 00:58:51,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Two things.

624
00:58:52,246 --> 00:59:06,498
[SPEAKER_14]: One, when you do the annual report at the end of the year, can you please include the actual spending against the budget so that at the end of the year, we can see what we plan to do versus what we did that's not been included previously?

625
00:59:06,518 --> 00:59:13,444
[SPEAKER_14]: And then my other question is whether, is can you send the committee a copy of the original

626
00:59:14,124 --> 00:59:18,327
[SPEAKER_14]: grant award and whatever contract language there is that we've agreed to.

627
00:59:18,407 --> 00:59:22,209
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it just this one active grant or do we have two active grants right now?

628
00:59:24,971 --> 00:59:26,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there another one besides Cummings?

629
00:59:31,175 --> 00:59:34,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Tartoff, you could just press your mic button and I'll put you back on.

630
00:59:34,478 --> 00:59:35,138
[SPEAKER_05]: You can stay on.

631
00:59:35,198 --> 00:59:38,040
[SPEAKER_05]: It just seems like it's a little more in control.

632
00:59:38,861 --> 00:59:39,281
[SPEAKER_05]: One second.

633
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:41,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

634
00:59:42,411 --> 00:59:44,052
[SPEAKER_01]: We have one grant the Cummings Foundation.

635
00:59:44,192 --> 00:59:44,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

636
00:59:44,692 --> 00:59:46,553
[SPEAKER_01]: The Crystal Campbell funds were donated.

637
00:59:47,934 --> 00:59:51,635
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Bloomberg funds we got years ago, they were donated.

638
00:59:51,976 --> 00:59:53,176
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no budget around that.

639
00:59:53,476 --> 00:59:56,057
[SPEAKER_01]: The money is used to support the program as needed.

640
00:59:56,578 --> 00:59:56,818
[SPEAKER_14]: Perfect.

641
00:59:56,858 --> 01:00:00,619
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, if you could send us a copy of the grant award from Cummings, that would be great.

642
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:01,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

643
01:00:04,121 --> 01:00:04,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

644
01:00:04,781 --> 01:00:05,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Reinfeld.

645
01:00:07,482 --> 01:00:09,985
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to thank you for this detailed information.

646
01:00:10,005 --> 01:00:11,266
[SPEAKER_07]: This is very helpful.

647
01:00:11,866 --> 01:00:26,058
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to urge you in the when future budgets are being prepared to make sure that the stipends kind of stay aligned with the work of within the teacher's contract.

648
01:00:26,078 --> 01:00:28,300
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a lot of work done during the negotiations to

649
01:00:29,301 --> 01:00:31,002
[SPEAKER_07]: make the stipends proportional.

650
01:00:31,543 --> 01:00:34,404
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not part of that contract, and they seem consistent.

651
01:00:34,444 --> 01:00:46,352
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been trying to go back and forth, and so I appreciate it, and I just want to have that on the radar because lots of our clubs do lots of good work, and the advisors, and making sure that that's fair and equitable.

652
01:00:49,975 --> 01:00:50,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Member Reinfeld.

653
01:00:53,697 --> 01:00:55,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Any comments, further questions?

654
01:00:55,238 --> 01:00:56,679
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, I'm going to move on to number four.

655
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:57,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Trotter.

656
01:00:59,347 --> 01:01:00,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we need an approval, though.

657
01:01:02,068 --> 01:01:05,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion for approval by Member Intoppa, seconded by Member Branley.

658
01:01:06,309 --> 01:01:07,169
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

659
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:21,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call, please.

660
01:01:25,535 --> 01:01:26,115

[SPEAKER_11]: and Tapa.

665
01:01:29,685 --> 01:01:29,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

666
01:01:30,026 --> 01:01:30,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember all the potting?

667
01:01:30,766 --> 01:01:31,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

668
01:01:31,206 --> 01:01:31,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Reinfeld.

669
01:01:31,907 --> 01:01:32,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember?

670
01:01:32,527 --> 01:01:33,387
[SPEAKER_11]: So yes, Maryland.

671
01:01:33,407 --> 01:01:33,628
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

672
01:01:33,668 --> 01:01:33,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

673
01:01:34,048 --> 01:01:36,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven in the affirmative zero in the negative motion passes.

674
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:37,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

675
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:38,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

676
01:01:39,811 --> 01:01:40,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Number four.

677
01:01:40,251 --> 01:01:41,612
[SPEAKER_05]: We have bus monitor reports.

678
01:01:41,692 --> 01:01:44,114
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna turn it over to our superintendent, Dr Lucy.

679
01:01:44,494 --> 01:01:45,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

680
01:01:53,159 --> 01:01:53,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

681
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:56,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your patience.

682
01:01:57,310 --> 01:01:58,911
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the dance of the microphones.

683
01:02:02,712 --> 01:02:19,497
[SPEAKER_06]: So briefly, last year, as part of our ongoing conversations with the community, there was a hope to have some bus monitors implemented on some of the bus routes that we have across the city.

684
01:02:21,791 --> 01:02:38,285
[SPEAKER_06]: In that ongoing conversation as part of the supplemental budget, which was presented on January 13th to this board, we reviewed the possibility at that time of incorporating bus monitors in areas of need.

685
01:02:39,386 --> 01:02:47,433
[SPEAKER_06]: So as a result of that conversation, there have been lots of internal conversations that have been had between central office

686
01:02:48,532 --> 01:03:14,057
[SPEAKER_06]: which has included multiple people, but because transportation is all encompassing and does require a lot of people at the table, but I mean, Joan Bowen and Dr. Talbot, Megan Fidler-Carey, myself, Noel, lots of people, Mr. Pippicelli, have been on the central office side engaged in conversations with principals and assistant principals, as well as Easton Bus itself.

687
01:03:14,077 --> 01:03:18,318
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of those conversations have included a review of bus routes per school,

688
01:03:19,299 --> 01:03:21,461
[SPEAKER_06]: that was part of the contract that they gave us.

689
01:03:21,981 --> 01:03:22,341
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a

690
01:03:37,317 --> 01:03:46,304
[SPEAKER_06]: A review of the assignments of paraprofessional duties through their new CBA and Schedule A capacity to assist in that nature.

691
01:03:47,245 --> 01:03:52,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Some contingency planning, because we always need to have contingency planning, all well-laid plans.

692
01:03:53,570 --> 01:04:02,518
[SPEAKER_06]: And then to monitor, we wanna make sure we are creating a mechanism to monitor reports, concerns, questions, and coverages across the district.

693
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:18,091
[SPEAKER_06]: So in order to assess the need for bus monitors, this conversation involved the creation of a tiered approach to allocating resource.

694
01:04:19,092 --> 01:04:24,516
[SPEAKER_06]: So that work, as mentioned, was collaborative with school leaders, Eastern Bus and Central Office.

695
01:04:25,718 --> 01:04:27,039
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked at student need,

696
01:04:28,441 --> 01:04:32,845
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked at enrollment or possible areas of overcrowding on buses.

697
01:04:33,625 --> 01:04:35,206
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked at safety concerns.

698
01:04:35,987 --> 01:04:45,134
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked at reports from either caregivers, bus drivers, Eastern Bus itself, community members, and the like.

699
01:04:45,694 --> 01:04:55,282
[SPEAKER_06]: And so taking all of those pieces of data into account, we came up with a tiered system, which was tier one is an immediate priority.

700
01:04:56,127 --> 01:05:04,849
[SPEAKER_06]: So more than one of these areas as highlighted above was brought up in reference to a particular bus at a particular school.

701
01:05:05,409 --> 01:05:07,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Tier two was an emerging priority.

702
01:05:07,989 --> 01:05:14,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't maybe require a bus monitor at this very moment, but we're keeping a close eye on it.

703
01:05:14,711 --> 01:05:19,412
[SPEAKER_06]: If we had a genie in a bottle and funding was not an issue,

704
01:05:20,835 --> 01:05:28,078
[SPEAKER_06]: and this might be a place that we would put a bus monitor if the need arises.

705
01:05:29,538 --> 01:05:38,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Tier three was just to monitor ongoing, something that we're doing with all of our buses, but this is classified as we're keeping an eye on this bus.

706
01:05:38,961 --> 01:05:40,762
[SPEAKER_06]: And tier four, currently stable.

707
01:05:43,003 --> 01:05:48,905
[SPEAKER_06]: As we take these tiers into account, the next slide highlights for you

708
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:52,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Pippa, Sally, do you mind moving?

709
01:05:52,821 --> 01:05:53,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

710
01:05:53,822 --> 01:05:56,643
[SPEAKER_06]: This next slide highlights all the buses.

711
01:05:56,723 --> 01:06:01,406
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have 17 buses across the city from elementary to middle to high school.

712
01:06:02,227 --> 01:06:06,549
[SPEAKER_06]: And this prioritizes the tiers for every bus in the city.

713
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:11,572
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see based on our approach, tier one, there are four buses.

714
01:06:12,492 --> 01:06:15,954
[SPEAKER_06]: There's pretty much one at each elementary school and one at the middle school.

715
01:06:17,142 --> 01:06:33,447
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, areas for the reasons why these buses are in tier one range from, um, student need and support to dismissal issues around dropping off at after school programs.

716
01:06:34,127 --> 01:06:34,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Middle school.

717
01:06:34,687 --> 01:06:41,289
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a popular bus for a lot of students to kind of hop on, go downtown to the library, visit their friends.

718
01:06:41,788 --> 01:06:48,811
[SPEAKER_06]: there could be overcrowding issues, or just a little bit of shifting around buses, let's just say.

719
01:06:49,431 --> 01:06:52,452
[SPEAKER_06]: You will note, I do not have the high school bus on here.

720
01:06:52,512 --> 01:06:57,494
[SPEAKER_06]: The high school only has one yellow school bus that goes to North Medford.

721
01:06:57,975 --> 01:07:02,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone from the school leaders to Eastern Bus, that bus is stable.

722
01:07:03,617 --> 01:07:07,058
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is the bus that's not on here, which is bus 17.

723
01:07:09,179 --> 01:07:10,600
[SPEAKER_06]: There are no reports of a need,

724
01:07:11,987 --> 01:07:12,870
[SPEAKER_06]: in any capacity.

725
01:07:14,817 --> 01:07:16,322
[SPEAKER_06]: If we move to the next slide.

726
01:07:17,853 --> 01:07:25,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to refresh everyone's memories if people at home have not seen this, or just to make sure we say it one more time to the committee.

727
01:07:26,496 --> 01:07:36,059
[SPEAKER_06]: As part of the bid contract for Eastern Bus last year, when the contract was up, they did give us a quote because we wanted to know.

728
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:42,300
[SPEAKER_06]: And for the record, it was our only bid, so we did not get a bid from any other bus company.

729
01:07:42,781 --> 01:07:45,001
[SPEAKER_06]: But their bid for bus monitors was $250 per day.

730
01:07:48,583 --> 01:07:48,803
[SPEAKER_06]: bus service.

731
01:07:48,843 --> 01:07:49,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Per bus.

732
01:07:50,824 --> 01:08:03,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Now when I engaged this year in conversation with them, and I can understand where they're coming from, but they gave the example of districts that they are with that have bus monitors on their buses.

733
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:05,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Cambridge and

734
01:08:11,047 --> 01:08:17,310
[SPEAKER_06]: because it's very difficult for them to find a bus monitor that's only going to work an hour to two hours a day.

735
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:31,277
[SPEAKER_06]: So bus monitors in other districts where they have found success are riding the bus for the morning, for the afternoon, and for the late bus transport for students home.

736
01:08:32,855 --> 01:08:37,817
[SPEAKER_06]: In converse, so you can see here from this, we have 17 total buses.

737
01:08:37,877 --> 01:08:45,020
[SPEAKER_06]: If we were to take $250 a day times 180 school days, that's $765,000 for bus monitors.

738
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:54,064
[SPEAKER_06]: If we were, and then all the way down, so if we were to look at just tiers one, two, and three, and remove the buses that are stable, that gets us down to $675,000.

739
01:08:56,933 --> 01:09:06,060
[SPEAKER_06]: if we were to look at just tiers one and two, which knowing that these tiers will fluctuate through the year, but if we were just going to look at tiers one and two, right now that rate would be $405,000.

740
01:09:06,941 --> 01:09:20,712
[SPEAKER_06]: I did subtract two buses from this total because if you go back to the chart before, there are two buses that overlap from the elementary run to the middle school run.

741
01:09:20,772 --> 01:09:23,814
[SPEAKER_06]: So I removed the cost of two buses to that total.

742
01:09:24,715 --> 01:09:28,342
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we just look at the four buses, which is tier one, it's $180,000.

743
01:09:28,382 --> 01:09:28,422
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

744
01:09:33,535 --> 01:09:48,802
[SPEAKER_06]: I do think for us right now at this point, it's not very fiscally responsible right now to say that we would be going with Eastern Bus to supply our bus monitor staffing.

745
01:09:49,383 --> 01:09:55,626
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say that also part of that rationale is that engaged in conversation with school leaders and Eastern Bus

746
01:09:57,746 --> 01:10:03,854
[SPEAKER_06]: We there is no report of a need for morning bus monitors.

747
01:10:04,595 --> 01:10:09,181
[SPEAKER_06]: The only need from the stakeholders right now is for the afternoon runs.

748
01:10:10,322 --> 01:10:14,968
[SPEAKER_06]: And so fiscally, it wouldn't be that prudent to do.

749
01:10:17,393 --> 01:10:19,115
[SPEAKER_06]: if we go to the next slide.

750
01:10:19,575 --> 01:10:40,733
[SPEAKER_06]: So the next part of the conversation is to provide some context a little bit for other ways that we can maybe look to provide some support on buses that are tier one to start and maybe looking at what we can handle for anything additional as need arises.

751
01:10:41,872 --> 01:10:51,705
[SPEAKER_06]: So as part of the recently negotiated and ratified contract with the paraprofessionals, there are two levels of paraprofessionals.

752
01:10:52,105 --> 01:10:57,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Some are Schedule B and some are Schedule A. Schedule A have additional hours of pay that

753
01:11:00,535 --> 01:11:07,217
[SPEAKER_06]: they need at the discretion of principals to provide to the school in which they work in.

754
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,538
[SPEAKER_06]: And so right here you can see an outline.

755
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:22,801
[SPEAKER_06]: If elementary paraprofessionals schedule A owe the district 29.83 hours of coverage throughout the year, that's each para of schedule A.

756
01:11:23,991 --> 01:11:31,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, the average of elementary school paras that are schedule A is about four to five paras.

757
01:11:32,961 --> 01:11:40,109
[SPEAKER_06]: There are situations, there are two schools in which there may be more paras, but one works the afterschool.

758
01:11:40,350 --> 01:11:44,614
[SPEAKER_06]: So that still brings us down to four to five right now at each elementary school.

759
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:53,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Middle school paraprofessionals do not owe any time based on the nature of the new schedule and the support that they provide in the morning.

760
01:11:54,330 --> 01:12:00,997
[SPEAKER_06]: And high school paraprofessionals on schedule A owe 19.53 hours to the district.

761
01:12:02,179 --> 01:12:05,622
[SPEAKER_06]: So keeping all of this in mind, we are proposing

762
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:14,420
[SPEAKER_06]: we look at the two levels right now that are of need, we have elementary schools and middle schools.

763
01:12:15,361 --> 01:12:20,503
[SPEAKER_06]: We are proposing using a rotating use of Schedule A paraprofessionals.

764
01:12:23,184 --> 01:12:26,766
[SPEAKER_06]: That may be consistent, or that also may be intermittent.

765
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:30,908
[SPEAKER_06]: In conversations with principals and with Eastern Bus,

766
01:12:32,879 --> 01:12:36,161
[SPEAKER_06]: of course, situations in need are different from school to school.

767
01:12:36,441 --> 01:12:59,873
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are some schools where right now they feel like an intermittent need would be the most effective so that, let's say for a week or two weeks, you have a bus monitor, they're reviewing expectations, they're modeling to the students how they should be at when they're on the bus, when they're riding the bus, sometimes also how they should be

768
01:13:00,813 --> 01:13:09,717
[SPEAKER_06]: getting off the bus, when their stop is, making sure that if there's certain grade, the bus driver's checking tags, all of those things.

769
01:13:10,297 --> 01:13:11,798
[SPEAKER_06]: And we may not need it consistently.

770
01:13:12,018 --> 01:13:14,159
[SPEAKER_06]: We can roll that back, see how that goes.

771
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:17,100
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's a need, reinstall it again.

772
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:23,803
[SPEAKER_06]: So this rotating use of paraprofessionals would be supportive.

773
01:13:24,783 --> 01:13:28,585
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have talked about the possible incorporation of a small stipend.

774
01:13:29,857 --> 01:13:35,003
[SPEAKER_06]: for a tier two bus or a stipend to staff members to cover tier one supports and.

775
01:13:36,204 --> 01:13:39,828
[SPEAKER_06]: If the need arises for a tier two bus.

776
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:43,413
[SPEAKER_06]: That would also serve in that

777
01:13:50,530 --> 01:14:02,099
[SPEAKER_06]: As said before, we are maintaining records internally so that we are keeping track of documenting reports, needs, and coverages across the district.

778
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:06,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Middle school, because paraprofessionals don't have the time,

779
01:14:07,905 --> 01:14:14,009
[SPEAKER_06]: the pieces that we looked at there are the stipend option, and we are in conversations with City Air.

780
01:14:14,089 --> 01:14:27,918
[SPEAKER_06]: I have not gotten a direct answer yet, but that's a possible talking point because we do have middle school core members and the middle school buses are all merged.

781
01:14:28,398 --> 01:14:35,102
[SPEAKER_06]: So the McGlynn students, for people that may not be aware, even at home, the McGlynn students walk to the Andrews.

782
01:14:35,202 --> 01:14:36,362
[SPEAKER_06]: There are 12 buses.

783
01:14:37,303 --> 01:14:44,346
[SPEAKER_06]: And school leadership from both schools are there and present with Jessica from Eastern Bus assisting with boarding.

784
01:14:44,666 --> 01:14:50,570
[SPEAKER_06]: The biggest takeaway from Eastern Bus was the support they need for middle school level is on boarding.

785
01:14:51,690 --> 01:15:18,100
[SPEAKER_06]: and the four buses that are tier one, they did feel that an intermittent approach would be best because if there is an adult or a staff member on those four tier one buses every day for boarding, setting the expectation, making sure students are seated, that it makes the ride a little bit more seamless.

786
01:15:20,772 --> 01:15:26,576
[SPEAKER_06]: So at this point, I open the floor if there are any questions or pieces of feedback or comments for me.

787
01:15:31,859 --> 01:15:32,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham?

788
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:39,321
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

789
01:15:40,162 --> 01:15:40,903
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for this.

790
01:15:41,444 --> 01:15:49,254
[SPEAKER_14]: I really appreciate that we are solving problems that we have known about for a really long time.

791
01:15:49,274 --> 01:15:52,980
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've, you know,

792
01:15:53,958 --> 01:15:56,820
[SPEAKER_14]: for a whole variety of reasons not done this before.

793
01:15:56,920 --> 01:16:14,869
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you for doing that and for doing it really thoughtfully, because I think it's not a good use of funds to just assume that support is needed on every bus every day for 180 days, because what we really want is to be modeling behavior that teaches kids how to ride the bus responsibly.

794
01:16:14,889 --> 01:16:21,132
[SPEAKER_14]: And the goal would be that you don't have tier one buses, but that there's a plan to respond when something happens.

795
01:16:21,172 --> 01:16:22,393
[SPEAKER_14]: So I really appreciate

796
01:16:22,993 --> 01:16:38,941
[SPEAKER_14]: the work that went into this and the collaboration between the Eastern Bus and your office and the principals, because I think that's how we actually start solving problems in the district.

797
01:16:38,961 --> 01:16:39,821
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you for that.

798
01:16:40,641 --> 01:16:44,783
[SPEAKER_14]: And the only question I had is, if parents are seeing

799
01:16:46,084 --> 01:16:53,066
[SPEAKER_14]: some need for uh to like sort of raise some awareness about a bus issue that they're observing in some way?

800
01:16:53,086 --> 01:16:55,347
[SPEAKER_14]: Do they contact the principal?

801
01:16:55,387 --> 01:16:56,248
[SPEAKER_14]: Who do they contact?

802
01:16:57,828 --> 01:17:02,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Well I actually have some fantastic news to answer that question.

803
01:17:03,090 --> 01:17:10,533
[SPEAKER_06]: So we we have just hired a transportation manager position for the district.

804
01:17:10,833 --> 01:17:11,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

805
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:19,204
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a non-unit position, and so this person, Mr. Evan Schwartz, his first day is next Tuesday.

806
01:17:19,865 --> 01:17:23,914
[SPEAKER_06]: He is coming to us with experience in this role.

807
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:33,523
[SPEAKER_06]: most recently for Brookline Public Schools, in which Eastern Bus has had experience, because Brookline is one of their districts.

808
01:17:33,923 --> 01:17:40,025
[SPEAKER_06]: So they actually have worked with Mr. Schwartz before, spoke very highly of his skillset, his professionalism.

809
01:17:40,765 --> 01:17:41,906
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm very excited.

810
01:17:42,106 --> 01:17:45,947
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to bombard Mr. Schwartz.

811
01:17:46,947 --> 01:17:53,830
[SPEAKER_06]: The minute he comes in, we will make sure that we are introducing him to the community, to this membership, if you so like.

812
01:17:54,770 --> 01:18:01,313
[SPEAKER_06]: we will make sure we send to parents and put on the website under the transportation, his contact information.

813
01:18:02,513 --> 01:18:05,715
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would say first and foremost, it's the principals for sure.

814
01:18:06,295 --> 01:18:11,237
[SPEAKER_06]: And then once Mr. Schwartz gets going, he is going to be all things transportation.

815
01:18:13,018 --> 01:18:13,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for that.

816
01:18:14,058 --> 01:18:14,979
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very important question.

817
01:18:21,401 --> 01:18:22,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Reinfeld and Member Ruseau.

818
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:25,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

819
01:18:26,261 --> 01:18:30,283
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to ask what conversation had happened with City Year, but that got answered.

820
01:18:30,924 --> 01:18:44,032
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also, I think the intermittent is a very useful model, because what we don't want is we've kind of identified with the paraprofessionals contract that there are a lot of ways to support students with those hours.

821
01:18:44,152 --> 01:18:51,616
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would, as urgent as bus monitoring is, I would hate for that to be the only extra support paras are providing.

822
01:18:51,897 --> 01:18:53,698
[SPEAKER_07]: But my question is around training.

823
01:18:55,199 --> 01:19:03,906
[SPEAKER_07]: and who these bus monitors are reporting to in terms of how they're being trained, what's the supervisory, and what's the liability?

824
01:19:03,986 --> 01:19:09,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know drivers are employed by Eastern Bus, and that's the contract.

825
01:19:09,551 --> 01:19:17,938
[SPEAKER_07]: So how does that work, kind of logistically, managerially, and liability-wise?

826
01:19:18,478 --> 01:19:19,659
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a fabulous question.

827
01:19:22,241 --> 01:19:35,775
[SPEAKER_06]: In conversation with Eastern Bus, we did discuss the use of monitors that would be supplied by the district rather than supplied by Eastern Bus, so we are in conversation with them.

828
01:19:36,275 --> 01:19:41,260
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of training, I would say that the bus monitors report to the principal.

829
01:19:42,584 --> 01:19:45,145
[SPEAKER_06]: just to keep that chain of communication solid.

830
01:19:45,745 --> 01:19:55,328
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's the principals that are hearing the reports or the concerns, mostly from caregivers, definitely from bus drivers, definitely from Eastern Bus.

831
01:19:56,428 --> 01:20:01,350
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's important to note that all the buses do have video surveillance.

832
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:13,875
[SPEAKER_06]: so oftentimes when reports are given to the district, depending on what the report is, school leaders are working with Eastern Bus to review the tapes.

833
01:20:15,555 --> 01:20:23,058
[SPEAKER_06]: There's, Mr. Lord, I'm sorry I'm looking at you, I'm not quite sure, but I know it's video, is it also sound?

834
01:20:24,779 --> 01:20:26,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Like is it audio recording as well?

835
01:20:28,788 --> 01:20:30,029
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have to look into that.

836
01:20:30,209 --> 01:20:33,770
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's video, but I would just have to look into that one.

837
01:20:34,411 --> 01:20:46,536
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the training, Mr. Schwartz is starting on Tuesday, so that is part of the conversation that we're having with Eastern Bus and Mr. Schwartz as he arrives.

838
01:20:50,118 --> 01:20:50,919
[SPEAKER_06]: So are we.

839
01:20:55,201 --> 01:20:55,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

840
01:20:58,212 --> 01:20:58,532
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

841
01:20:58,592 --> 01:21:02,213
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to acknowledge how fast you turned this around.

842
01:21:02,233 --> 01:21:05,255
[SPEAKER_11]: We did just do the pair of contract.

843
01:21:05,635 --> 01:21:11,937
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems like last week it wasn't, but I wasn't really expecting all that to happen quite so fast.

844
01:21:11,997 --> 01:21:13,017
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm thrilled.

845
01:21:13,298 --> 01:21:13,878
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

846
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:19,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Olapade.

847
01:21:20,327 --> 01:21:20,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

848
01:21:20,707 --> 01:21:22,348
[SPEAKER_09]: I had two quick questions.

849
01:21:22,689 --> 01:21:31,594
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know that the to comprise the actual tiered system to a prioritization, you know, you implement a couple different ways to the criteria or metrics.

850
01:21:32,274 --> 01:21:37,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a metric that we're working on to determine like the actual reduction of incidents and success of this as well as

851
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:50,483
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever that may look like, are we able to kind of implement some type of mid-year report to kind of see how this is progressing so that hopefully we're seeing the numbers continue to go down so that for ourselves and the district, and I think families understand like why we're doing this.

852
01:21:51,384 --> 01:22:05,868
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the absolute goal, which is why that's part of our action steps in the internal documentation that we are keeping so that we are tracking reports when we've used coverages and how we've used those coverages and

853
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:09,441
[SPEAKER_06]: That's our goal, and that's what we're hoping to see.

854
01:22:10,182 --> 01:22:16,265
[SPEAKER_06]: And to the members' input before, I think there is a key piece around modeling.

855
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:18,006
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will say just one of

856
01:22:21,933 --> 01:22:40,388
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that I also want to make sure that I haven't really, in full transparency, done yet, but also to keep the conversation going with Medford Police on the city side, the Roberts bus that is tier one, that's the bus that goes to the Boys and Girls Club.

857
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:52,859
[SPEAKER_06]: and I've had lots of conversations with Dr. Talbot, who has gone to every elementary school, seen dismissal procedures, lots of conversations with Megan Fidlicari.

858
01:22:53,819 --> 01:23:03,687
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are a lot of reports about all four elementary school buses kind of converging in a really compressed area of the city.

859
01:23:04,388 --> 01:23:10,312
[SPEAKER_06]: And what is happening is there's a large amount, there's a lot of students on that bus.

860
01:23:11,313 --> 01:23:16,436
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can also get you the ridership numbers, which vary dramatically from school to school.

861
01:23:16,976 --> 01:23:22,320
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that also factors into the tiered system, which is really why the McGlynn didn't have a tier one.

862
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:25,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Their ridership numbers are much lower.

863
01:23:25,581 --> 01:23:39,510
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I look at that bus at the Roberts, the ridership numbers are high and there were more than one instance of students getting confused because so many students get off the bus for that afterschool program.

864
01:23:40,410 --> 01:23:43,511
[SPEAKER_06]: that some students are getting off that bus and it's not their stop.

865
01:23:44,632 --> 01:23:52,435
[SPEAKER_06]: And so some of the after-school programs have a dedicated person that boards the bus, makes sure they have the right students, they get off the bus.

866
01:23:52,455 --> 01:23:57,858
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think part of this conversation too, which is why I'm very grateful for Mrs. Schwartz to be here,

867
01:23:58,378 --> 01:24:05,540
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think part of this is also ongoing conversations with Eastern Bus, but with some of the afterschool programs.

868
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:10,641
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if there's a possibility to put a crossing guard down there.

869
01:24:10,661 --> 01:24:14,101
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something that I would like to look into.

870
01:24:15,642 --> 01:24:22,903
[SPEAKER_06]: And I haven't heard that there's necessarily as big of a problem with the other elementary schools as there was with the Roberts.

871
01:24:24,203 --> 01:24:26,404
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot of little nuanced pieces there, yeah.

872
01:24:26,604 --> 01:24:26,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

873
01:24:28,677 --> 01:24:28,857
[SPEAKER_05]: great.

874
01:24:28,997 --> 01:24:30,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you need a vote of any sort or you?

875
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:33,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not believe so.

876
01:24:33,841 --> 01:24:34,741
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's okay.

877
01:24:35,382 --> 01:24:37,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

878
01:24:37,944 --> 01:24:40,526
[SPEAKER_05]: We do not have any presentations of the public.

879
01:24:40,806 --> 01:24:42,287
[SPEAKER_04]: May I make one comment before we go on?

880
01:24:42,347 --> 01:24:42,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, sure.

881
01:24:44,529 --> 01:24:50,633
[SPEAKER_06]: I did just want to make sure as where, I know we're going to move on to some resolutions, but I did just want to say this week,

882
01:24:53,431 --> 01:24:53,972
[SPEAKER_06]: to make sure that.

883
01:24:53,992 --> 01:24:55,013
[SPEAKER_06]: At the elementary level.

884
01:24:55,053 --> 01:24:57,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Caregivers will be receiving the devil's.

885
01:24:58,937 --> 01:25:01,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Early screeners sent home.

886
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:06,887
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the first time we've done this in this manner and not during report card conferences.

887
01:25:07,708 --> 01:25:08,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Um and I wanted to just make

888
01:25:14,255 --> 01:25:14,415
[SPEAKER_06]: school.

889
01:25:14,435 --> 01:25:21,659
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not going to read the principal emails the Friday memo, but just wanted to say it here so that parents are aware that it is coming home this week.

890
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:24,701
[SPEAKER_06]: And so please be checking your child's backpack.

891
01:25:25,482 --> 01:25:25,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

892
01:25:26,462 --> 01:25:27,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

893
01:25:27,983 --> 01:25:29,044
[SPEAKER_05]: No continued business.

894
01:25:29,144 --> 01:25:32,686
[SPEAKER_05]: New business offered by member Reinfeld 20 25-32.

895
01:25:33,366 --> 01:25:37,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas the Medford School Committee unanimously accepted the ad hoc resolution that the design firm

896
01:25:43,172 --> 01:25:45,515
[SPEAKER_05]: commencing work on the feasibility study in January 2026.

897
01:25:45,795 --> 01:26:00,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it now resolved that the seven individuals elected on November 4th, 2025 to serve on the Medford City Council for the term beginning January 1, 2026 shall be invited to attend this meeting of the Medford School Committee, wherein the presentation is made.

898
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:02,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you like to speak or you want a motion for approval?

899
01:26:04,036 --> 01:26:04,816
[SPEAKER_05]: member Reinfeld.

900
01:26:05,657 --> 01:26:06,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to approve.

901
01:26:06,677 --> 01:26:07,998
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this speaks for itself.

902
01:26:08,038 --> 01:26:08,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

903
01:26:08,578 --> 01:26:11,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion for approval by member Reinfeld, seconded by member Graham.

904
01:26:11,619 --> 01:26:12,440
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

905
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:13,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

906
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:14,341
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

907
01:26:15,021 --> 01:26:15,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

908
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:19,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the resolution and also offered by member Reinfeld.

909
01:26:20,023 --> 01:26:35,653
[SPEAKER_05]: 2025-32, whereas the Medford School Committee desires to take student experience into account in its decision making and understanding the impact of those decisions, whereas student councils meet regularly in the schools to discuss issues relevant to the student experience,

910
01:26:36,393 --> 01:26:52,343
[SPEAKER_05]: be it therefore resolved that the regular school committee meeting agenda shall include a designated block for presentations by student representatives, and be it resolved that these presentations shall not preclude additional contributions by student representatives during the rest of the meeting.

911
01:26:54,081 --> 01:27:16,965
[SPEAKER_05]: and be it resolved that the superintendent shall work with the student council leaders to encourage cross school communication to inform presentations of student representatives and be it further resolved that the school committee shall designate one member each season whom the high school student council may invite to attend their meeting on a monthly basis and be resolved that the school committee member in attendance at the school students council meetings shall act

912
01:27:19,726 --> 01:27:30,852
[SPEAKER_05]: as an engaged observer and shall not speak in any official capacity for the elected body in these meetings and be it finally resolved that the rules of the member school committee and policy B. E. D. B.

913
01:27:33,038 --> 01:27:39,923
[SPEAKER_05]: the school committee shall be updated to include these provisions.

914
01:27:40,363 --> 01:27:41,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Reinfeld.

915
01:27:42,084 --> 01:27:42,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

916
01:27:42,744 --> 01:27:49,849
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is this resolution is meant to formalize the student involvement, given that we've had, um, consistent student.

917
01:27:50,809 --> 01:27:56,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Representatives and we would like to really give them a place to speak, not mandatory, but the

918
01:28:00,675 --> 01:28:18,527
[SPEAKER_07]: school committee to members to attend meetings at the invitation of and figure out how to do that without breaking open meeting law and with and acknowledging that many members of the committee are unable to commit to regular meetings and also that students deserve a space to be

919
01:28:19,447 --> 01:28:21,448
[SPEAKER_07]: with students without the committee present.

920
01:28:21,788 --> 01:28:23,169
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is designed to do that.

921
01:28:23,889 --> 01:28:28,012
[SPEAKER_07]: If my colleagues have questions, I would actually ask that they defer and let the students respond first.

922
01:28:28,352 --> 01:28:34,635
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't go back and forth on this just because of the timing for submission of agenda items and their meetings.

923
01:28:35,075 --> 01:28:40,118
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would request that the students get to speak first and then I'm happy to take questions from my colleagues.

924
01:28:41,138 --> 01:28:41,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

925
01:28:41,478 --> 01:28:42,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Member Reinfeld.

926
01:28:42,579 --> 01:28:44,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to speak there or do you want to go up to the podium?

927
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:45,881
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you feel more comfortable?

928
01:28:47,235 --> 01:28:47,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right there.

929
01:28:48,756 --> 01:28:50,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so you can face us.

930
01:29:01,904 --> 01:29:07,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Just remind us of your name and then please let us know what your thoughts are.

931
01:29:07,647 --> 01:29:09,849
[SPEAKER_05]: And you need to activate memory.

932
01:29:10,649 --> 01:29:11,009
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.

933
01:29:13,948 --> 01:29:20,532
[SPEAKER_13]: The Student Advisory Committee, on behalf of the Greater Student Advisory Organization, would like to express approval for this resolution.

934
01:29:21,673 --> 01:29:32,359
[SPEAKER_13]: The impact of student input, we believe, is invaluable as a guiding beacon for those that administer policy, which is ultimately meant to service those very same students.

935
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:41,585
[SPEAKER_13]: Conversely, those who create legislation have unique wisdom on the transformation from the dimensions of problems and evidence to that of quantifiable statutes.

936
01:29:43,137 --> 01:29:54,536
[SPEAKER_13]: As described by Machiavelli, those who draw landscapes place themselves below in the plane to contemplate the nature of the mountains and of lofty places in order to contemplate the planes place themselves upon high mountains.

937
01:29:54,717 --> 01:29:55,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Furthermore,

938
01:29:56,718 --> 01:30:03,399
[SPEAKER_13]: As affirmed in clause seven, we believe that both of these groups should serve not as the speaker through the mouthpiece, but as the one who advises the speaker.

939
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:09,480
[SPEAKER_13]: We believe that this resolution is one that will prove invaluable in the continued cooperation between the school committee and the student body.

940
01:30:10,121 --> 01:30:10,481
Thank you.

941
01:30:11,701 --> 01:30:12,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

942
01:30:12,901 --> 01:30:14,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

943
01:30:14,301 --> 01:30:14,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Questions?

944
01:30:15,102 --> 01:30:17,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Intoppa and then Member Reinfeld.

945
01:30:17,722 --> 01:30:18,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's take this.

946
01:30:24,526 --> 01:30:25,527
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you for being here.

947
01:30:25,567 --> 01:30:31,074
[SPEAKER_05]: It's wonderful to have four student representatives from the school council member in Tapa and then member Reinfeld.

948
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:35,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mayor.

949
01:30:36,842 --> 01:30:39,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a few questions in terms of

950
01:30:40,672 --> 01:30:42,653
[SPEAKER_08]: actually go with some language questions first.

951
01:30:42,713 --> 01:30:47,376
[SPEAKER_08]: When you remember, Reinfeld, when you say designate one member each season, what determines the sea?

952
01:30:47,456 --> 01:30:48,717
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew that was going to come up.

953
01:30:49,017 --> 01:30:53,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I would actually like to ask the students what makes sense.

954
01:30:53,801 --> 01:30:55,922
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm recognizing the fact that, um,

955
01:30:58,566 --> 01:31:02,268
[SPEAKER_07]: I had originally said semester, and then I realized we're in trimesters.

956
01:31:03,148 --> 01:31:05,809
[SPEAKER_07]: So that felt like the right, but then I realized there's a- In quarters?

957
01:31:05,829 --> 01:31:06,270
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

958
01:31:06,290 --> 01:31:07,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Quarters, sorry, we're in quarters.

959
01:31:07,410 --> 01:31:08,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was gonna say we're in quarters.

960
01:31:08,571 --> 01:31:13,293
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, elementary school is trimesters, and that's the last progress report I looked at.

961
01:31:14,574 --> 01:31:18,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I'm happy to do it by quarter if that makes sense.

962
01:31:18,696 --> 01:31:27,640
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the most important thing is that there be a break in that January for any term changeover in perpetuity, but...

963
01:31:31,071 --> 01:31:32,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Is quarterly correct?

964
01:31:34,753 --> 01:31:37,854
[SPEAKER_07]: My preference would be fall and spring.

965
01:31:37,975 --> 01:31:38,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I agree.

966
01:31:39,095 --> 01:31:40,096
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I was going to add.

967
01:31:42,537 --> 01:31:42,777
Yeah.

968
01:31:43,457 --> 01:31:43,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Half year?

969
01:31:44,338 --> 01:31:45,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Quarter?

970
01:31:45,699 --> 01:31:46,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Half year.

971
01:31:46,219 --> 01:31:49,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Students, half year, September to December, and then January to?

972
01:31:49,961 --> 01:31:53,403
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just saying there's a lot of January to June.

973
01:31:53,623 --> 01:31:55,764
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lot longer than September to December.

974
01:32:04,412 --> 01:32:06,773
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to get to that actually.

975
01:32:07,033 --> 01:32:07,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

976
01:32:08,234 --> 01:32:08,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

977
01:32:08,534 --> 01:32:13,916
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we give four people a term the opportunity, so it's up to you.

978
01:32:13,936 --> 01:32:15,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to do by quarters?

979
01:32:17,497 --> 01:32:18,298
[SPEAKER_08]: By quarters.

980
01:32:18,318 --> 01:32:19,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Or just quarters.

981
01:32:19,478 --> 01:32:20,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just do quarters.

982
01:32:20,578 --> 01:32:22,059
[SPEAKER_08]: If it stays the same, it stays the same.

983
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:23,520
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't mean it has to change.

984
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:27,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Each quarter.

985
01:32:27,181 --> 01:32:27,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

986
01:32:27,861 --> 01:32:28,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so.

987
01:32:28,722 --> 01:32:31,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because I have another amendment.

988
01:32:33,077 --> 01:32:36,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, season quarter and then, um.

989
01:32:37,779 --> 01:32:42,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously this is sort of like our policy on public engagement presentations.

990
01:32:42,941 --> 01:32:54,805
[SPEAKER_08]: The public where if they don't have anything or if they don't like they're not being expected to prepare everything every, you know, by week to make sure that they have they want if they have a presentation to make, there is a designated place in the agenda for that to happen.

991
01:32:55,165 --> 01:32:57,806
[SPEAKER_08]: And they are so because they're behind you right now.

992
01:32:57,867 --> 01:32:59,107
[SPEAKER_08]: The best way for them to do this.

993
01:32:59,327 --> 01:33:00,287
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm assuming email.

994
01:33:02,968 --> 01:33:04,529
[SPEAKER_05]: the chair, I believe.

995
01:33:05,449 --> 01:33:10,752
[SPEAKER_05]: The chair and the superintendent is how people put resolutions on along with Lisa or Joanne.

996
01:33:10,772 --> 01:33:11,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

997
01:33:14,221 --> 01:33:28,352
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the last thing, so I guess, so I will, if there's no other questions from my colleagues, I'll motion to approve and also with the amendment of changing season to quarter and also adding, which you can sever this if you want, one alternate elected.

998
01:33:28,392 --> 01:33:37,319
[SPEAKER_08]: So for the result that the school committee shall designate one member each quarter and one alternate whom the high school student council may invite to attend their meetings on a monthly basis.

999
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:41,503
[SPEAKER_08]: That way, if someone can't make it, we're still as informed as we possibly can be.

1000
01:33:41,523 --> 01:33:43,104
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great, yeah, that's a good amendment.

1001
01:33:43,424 --> 01:33:51,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, a motion for approval as amended, accepted by Member Reinfeld, made by Member Intoppa, seconded by Member Olapade.

1002
01:33:51,607 --> 01:33:52,527
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1003
01:33:53,367 --> 01:33:54,228
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1004
01:33:54,288 --> 01:33:55,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

1005
01:33:55,688 --> 01:34:04,651
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I would like to motion that the rules of the school committee, oh no, just lost it, hold on, that item 34 be updated

1006
01:34:08,115 --> 01:34:12,077
[SPEAKER_07]: It currently reads, student representatives serve as non-voting members of the school committee.

1007
01:34:12,137 --> 01:34:15,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Student representatives will be encouraged to participate in school committee meetings.

1008
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:18,801
[SPEAKER_07]: In the rules, sorry.

1009
01:34:21,142 --> 01:34:22,122
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't what?

1010
01:34:22,142 --> 01:34:23,423
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't amend the rules now?

1011
01:34:24,204 --> 01:34:26,505
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not on the agenda, but you can put it on for our next meeting.

1012
01:34:26,545 --> 01:34:29,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, it was in the resolution of be it resolved that this will be updated.

1013
01:34:30,047 --> 01:34:31,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Then can I update the policy?

1014
01:34:34,253 --> 01:34:51,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, then I will update the policy so that, so this is policy B-E-B-D, sorry, B-E-D-B to insert item six, presentations of student representatives in between report of the superintendent and presentations of the public.

1015
01:34:51,944 --> 01:35:02,230
[SPEAKER_07]: And accordingly, presentations of the public, continued business, new business, reports requested, condolences, and next meetings will all bump up a Roman numeral.

1016
01:35:03,742 --> 01:35:08,945
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to, I can share this on Zoom if that's helpful.

1017
01:35:09,025 --> 01:35:09,966
[SPEAKER_07]: I can send it to the, yeah.

1018
01:35:10,526 --> 01:35:17,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if you could just, if you could share where on the agenda it would be one more time, because we want to make sure it's after the Mustang Minute.

1019
01:35:18,551 --> 01:35:19,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's the before?

1020
01:35:20,052 --> 01:35:28,937
[SPEAKER_07]: So I had suggested that this go after the report of the superintendent before presentations of the public, basically where it is.

1021
01:35:30,402 --> 01:35:35,645
[SPEAKER_07]: right now, but before new business.

1022
01:35:35,925 --> 01:35:36,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, policy.

1023
01:35:36,886 --> 01:35:40,468
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so you'll update that and put it on the next agenda for us to approve.

1024
01:35:40,668 --> 01:35:41,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, wonderful.

1025
01:35:43,850 --> 01:35:46,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Presentations of student representatives.

1026
01:35:51,975 --> 01:35:59,339
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought I could get away with reading it since it's in the resolution, but happy to submit it separately.

1027
01:36:00,882 --> 01:36:05,323
[SPEAKER_05]: We have no reports requested, so we'll move to, we do have one condolence.

1028
01:36:05,544 --> 01:36:22,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Members of the Medford School Committee express their sincerest condolences to the family of Richard Dowd, husband of Maureen Dowd, a Medford public school educated for over 30 years, serving as a fourth grade teacher at the Lincoln, Kennedy, and Roberts Elementary Schools, and uncle Andrew O'Brien, principal of the McGlynn Elementary School.

1029
01:36:22,509 --> 01:36:24,730
[SPEAKER_05]: If we all may rise for a moment of silence, please.

1030
01:36:41,918 --> 01:36:46,639
