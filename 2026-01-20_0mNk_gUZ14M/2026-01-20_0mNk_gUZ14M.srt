00:16:43,925 --> 00:16:51,310
[SPEAKER_09]: He was someone who fought steadfastly for equal rights and equal opportunities for all people.

00:22:58,316 --> 00:23:08,558
[SPEAKER_11]: is hereby granted a common Vixler's license in city of Medford at a place only and expires sooner suspended or revoke the violations of the law, Commonwealth respecting the licensing of common Vixlers.

160
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:09,819
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the draft.

161
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:14,800
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to take a vote on that after we hear from the presenter.

162
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:20,521
[SPEAKER_11]: So first I will recognize Councilor Scarpelli, who's our chair of the subcommittee on licensing, permitting and signs.

163
00:23:21,021 --> 00:23:25,622
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we will recognize a representative from the company, Councilor Scarpelli.

164
00:23:26,643 --> 00:23:27,563
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Baez.

165
00:23:27,964 --> 00:23:33,508
[SPEAKER_18]: I see everything in order, so I'd move to the representative at the podium to give us a synopsis.

166
00:23:33,568 --> 00:23:33,889
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

167
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:36,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

168
00:23:36,091 --> 00:23:38,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you give your name and address for the record, please?

169
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, board members and license commission.

170
00:23:41,435 --> 00:23:45,118
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Niles Welch, 136 Prospect Avenue in Revere, Mass.

171
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:46,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

172
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:46,960
[SPEAKER_11]: We are the City Council.

173
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:48,652
[SPEAKER_02]: City Council, I apologize.

174
00:23:48,832 --> 00:24:01,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I stand before you today on behalf of KNC Made, LLC, in support of its application for a Type 2 common victor license for Annie's Pizzeria, 213 Middlesex Ave.

175
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:02,002
[SPEAKER_02]: in Medford.

176
00:24:02,923 --> 00:24:05,705
[SPEAKER_02]: This application reflects a change in ownership only.

177
00:24:06,426 --> 00:24:09,348
[SPEAKER_02]: My clients purchased the existing business in its entirety.

178
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:12,370
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no change in use from the prior operation.

179
00:24:13,311 --> 00:24:15,913
[SPEAKER_02]: The footprint layout service model remains the same.

180
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:38,498
[SPEAKER_02]: The only meaningful updates are some enhancements to the menu, which now includes not only a pizza menu, but a dynamic mix of some traditional Mexican-infused dishes as well, as well as we did apply for the hours of operation previously were Monday through Saturday, but we had requested and wished to grant on Sunday as well.

181
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:42,759
[SPEAKER_02]: So the hours proposed are Sunday through Saturday, 11 a.m.

182
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:44,380
[SPEAKER_02]: to 11 p.m.

183
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:53,683
[SPEAKER_02]: The restaurant itself is built in a small neighborhood scale establishment with very limited in restaurant dining.

184
00:24:54,183 --> 00:25:01,046
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just two tables that are positioned to the left and the right of the entrance and the service counter.

185
00:25:03,886 --> 00:25:07,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Maximum seating capacity inside would be about eight patrons.

186
00:25:09,135 --> 00:25:14,338
[SPEAKER_02]: The principal owner, Christian Torres, I believe he's also on the Zoom today in support of the application.

187
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:26,104
[SPEAKER_02]: The manager on record's name is Kenny Morales, who has all of his food safe certifications to ensure compliance with all food handling and safety requirements.

188
00:25:26,884 --> 00:25:33,508
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also my understanding that all required inspections that were associated with this license have been completed at this time.

189
00:25:34,197 --> 00:25:40,685
[SPEAKER_02]: So for these reasons, we respectfully request the approval of the Type 2 Victual License and open it to any questions.

190
00:25:41,526 --> 00:25:42,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much for the presentation.

191
00:25:42,767 --> 00:25:44,209
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have any questions for the applicant?

192
00:25:44,249 --> 00:25:45,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli.

193
00:25:46,058 --> 00:25:47,179
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

194
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:48,420
[SPEAKER_18]: I see everything is in order.

195
00:25:49,361 --> 00:25:52,943
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't see the hours of operations fall within our guidelines.

196
00:25:53,704 --> 00:25:59,568
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't see any special notice to come forth later in a special meeting or anything.

197
00:25:59,628 --> 00:26:06,373
[SPEAKER_18]: So I move forward with everything for approval, pending any of my colleagues' questions.

198
00:26:08,194 --> 00:26:10,436
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there any questions or comments from members of the Council?

199
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:19,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Seeing none, on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve, seconded by.

00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:52,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Leming?

[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to motion to take papers, to suspend the rules and take papers 26020 and 26021 out of order.

220

[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Lazzaro.

225
00:27:22,794 --> 00:27:23,014
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

226
00:27:26,616 --> 00:27:27,296
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Leming.

227
00:27:27,836 --> 00:27:27,956
Yes.

228
00:27:28,817 --> 00:27:29,397
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Malauulu.

229
00:27:29,437 --> 00:27:29,497
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

230
00:27:31,298 --> 00:27:32,298

[SPEAKER_17]: President Beard.

235
00:27:37,728 --> 00:27:41,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, 60 affirmative, 1 in the negative, the motion passes.

236
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:45,072
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to take two procedural matters relatively quickly.

237
00:27:45,492 --> 00:27:48,894
[SPEAKER_11]: We know there's a lot of interest on Zoom and some folks in the room as well for 26017.

238
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:56,438
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're just going to try to get two things out of the way before we go into that discussion.

239
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:07,921
[SPEAKER_11]: 26-020, litigation settlement to Silva versus City of Medford, request to enter executive session per Mass General Law, Chapter 30A, Section 21A-3.

240
00:28:07,941 --> 00:28:08,562
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have

241
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:28,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Here, dear members of the city council, I respect the request and recommend your honorable body enter executive session pursuant to general law chapter 30A section 21A3 to discuss strategy with respect to litigation concerning the matter of De Silva v. City of Medford.

242
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:32,614
[SPEAKER_11]: I also recommend that the council's agenda state in the executive session notice that the votes may be taken.

243
00:28:32,634 --> 00:28:37,376
[SPEAKER_11]: Attorney Parada from KP Law will be present to provide the council with guidance on this matter.

244
00:28:37,436 --> 00:28:38,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

245
00:28:38,976 --> 00:28:40,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Sincerely, Brianna Leocurne, Mayor.

246
00:28:41,597 --> 00:28:48,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a motion to enter Executive Session pursuant to Section 21, Chapter 38, Section 21A3?

247
00:28:49,082 --> 00:28:53,064
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

248
00:28:53,104 --> 00:28:54,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

249
00:28:55,806 --> 00:28:56,646
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Callahan.

250
00:28:58,107 --> 00:28:59,208
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Lazzaro.

251
00:28:59,728 --> 00:29:00,369
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

252
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,210
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Leming.

253
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:03,290
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

254
00:29:04,611 --> 00:29:05,252
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Malayne.

255
00:29:05,272 --> 00:29:05,332
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

256
00:29:06,852 --> 00:29:07,833
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli.

257
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:08,654
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

258
00:29:10,134 --> 00:29:10,815
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Tseng.

259
00:29:12,489 --> 00:29:13,210
[SPEAKER_17]: President Bears.

260
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:15,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I have an affirmative and a negative.

261
00:29:15,872 --> 00:29:16,833
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion passes.

262
00:29:16,973 --> 00:29:25,941
[SPEAKER_11]: We will be in executive session for a short time and then we will be coming back to discuss the remaining matters on our agenda.

263
00:36:42,488 --> 00:36:42,868
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

264
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:44,049
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you everyone.

265
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:54,879
[SPEAKER_11]: We are reconvening here an open session from our executive session.

266
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:05,428
[SPEAKER_11]: We have paper 26 0 2 1 submitted by Mayor Brianna Lugo Kern Capital Stabilization Fund appropriation request Roberts Elementary MSBA accelerated repair feasibility study.

267
00:37:07,368 --> 00:37:28,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Dear President Bears and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body approves the following appropriation from the Capital Stabilization Fund that the City of Medford, the City, hereby appropriates the amount of $300,000 for the purpose of paying feasibility study and schematic design costs related to a potential accelerated repair project involving a potential roof and heat pump conversion replacement project at Roberts Elementary School.

268
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:47,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Including the payment of all costs incidental or related thereto, the project, which proposed repair project would materially extend the useful life of the school and preserve an asset that is otherwise capable of supporting the required educational program and for which the city has applied for a grant from the Massachusetts School Building Authority, the MSBA, said amount to be expended on the direction of the Medford School Committee.

269
00:37:47,744 --> 00:37:53,348
[SPEAKER_11]: To meet this appropriation, the mayor, with the approval of the city council, is authorized to use funds from the capital stabilization account in said amount.

270
00:37:53,848 --> 00:37:55,789
[SPEAKER_11]: The city acknowledges that the MSBA's grant program

271
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:00,251
[SPEAKER_11]: is a non-entitlement discretionary program based on need as determined by the MSBA.

272
00:38:00,371 --> 00:38:12,473
[SPEAKER_11]: And if the MSBA's Board of Directors wants to invite the city to collaborate with the MSBA on this proposed repair project, any project costs the city incurs in excess of any grant that may be approved by and received from the MSBA shall be the sole responsibility of the city.

273
00:38:13,314 --> 00:38:15,374
[SPEAKER_11]: The Capital Stabilization Fund currently has a balance of $10,531,346.

274
00:38:15,434 --> 00:38:17,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter, respectfully submitted, Brianna Lingo Kern, Mayor.

275
00:38:24,544 --> 00:38:29,786
[SPEAKER_11]: I did receive communications from the mayor regarding this paper, as well as from our school committee chair, Graham.

276
00:38:30,486 --> 00:38:43,711
[SPEAKER_11]: The MSBA is looking for the city to have started the feasibility study by, I believe, early February in order to maintain our part in the accelerated repair program.

277
00:38:44,631 --> 00:38:46,232
[SPEAKER_11]: I will recognize Vice President Lazzaro.

278
00:38:49,658 --> 00:38:50,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

279
00:38:51,479 --> 00:39:02,645
[SPEAKER_06]: This seems like a very reasonable thing for us to spend money, especially on stabilization funds, since we have quite a significant amount of money available there.

280
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:10,990
[SPEAKER_06]: My question is around how the MSBA's grant program

281
00:39:11,929 --> 00:39:26,384
[SPEAKER_06]: works, how they determine, I'm sure that the school committee understands this and they've probably had these conversations, and I can go back and watch the school committee meetings if this has been discussed, but how the MSBA determines

282
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:37,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they use this feasibility study to determine which of the programs they want to move forward with.

283
00:39:39,031 --> 00:39:47,058
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think it's interesting that they say it's based on need and based on whether they want to vote to invite the city to collaborate with the MSBA.

284
00:39:48,139 --> 00:39:54,504
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we would do this project if the MSBA did not assist us, I'm curious about that as well.

285
00:39:56,959 --> 00:39:58,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Vice President Lazzaro.

286
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:07,502
[SPEAKER_11]: I will note that this is the same language that we used for the Andrews and McGlynn projects and for the Medford High School project.

287
00:40:07,622 --> 00:40:11,364
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's like a standard template language for MSBA.

288
00:40:12,164 --> 00:40:15,505
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not seeing a representative from the administration here right now.

289
00:40:15,725 --> 00:40:19,986
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we wanna table this until we get more answers.

290
00:40:20,787 --> 00:40:22,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, if I may.

291
00:40:23,828 --> 00:40:24,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Lazzaro.

292
00:40:26,067 --> 00:40:26,589
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fine.

293
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:27,412
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fine.

294
00:40:27,552 --> 00:40:29,319
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm comfortable moving forward.

295
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,965
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I'm just curious about.

296
00:40:33,606 --> 00:40:43,392
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be nice to have a representative from the mayor's administration when there are papers for us to approve, but it's fine to move forward if this is just the same standard language.

297
00:40:43,412 --> 00:40:48,115
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't memorize it from the previous two or the previous projects that we've approved.

298
00:40:49,676 --> 00:40:59,443
[SPEAKER_06]: And if this is just the next step towards doing a project that's necessary, I know that our schools, our buildings, since they were all

299
00:41:00,136 --> 00:41:03,506
[SPEAKER_06]: built at the same time since improvements were.

300
00:41:05,191 --> 00:41:06,492
[SPEAKER_06]: routinely delayed.

301
00:41:06,512 --> 00:41:10,174
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to see a lot of these going forward.

302
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:22,341
[SPEAKER_06]: And it seems like, yes, we always have another big project that we have to appropriate a bunch of money to first study, if it'll be fixed, and then fix it.

303
00:41:23,021 --> 00:41:24,502
[SPEAKER_06]: And it runs really quickly.

304
00:41:25,102 --> 00:41:29,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Or it feels like it's quick on our end, though I know the school committee is talking about these on an ongoing basis.

305
00:41:31,045 --> 00:41:32,826
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not in our interest to delay them.

306
00:41:32,886 --> 00:41:35,186
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's important that we move forward.

307
00:41:35,266 --> 00:41:47,370
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't mean to imply that we should delay it, but it is nice to have somebody to just bounce questions off of and get reminders about how this process works as we move forward.

308
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:51,391
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would be comfortable moving to approve this now.

309
00:41:52,771 --> 00:41:53,512
[SPEAKER_06]: So I motion to approve.

310
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:55,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Vice President Lazzaro.

311
00:41:55,992 --> 00:41:58,353
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think, you know, I can't make a motion,

312
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:06,924
[SPEAKER_11]: It might be helpful to maybe put forward a B paper for a meeting later in February or in early March on all of the school projects.

313
00:42:06,964 --> 00:42:10,026
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have McGlynn and Andrews currently.

314
00:42:11,007 --> 00:42:12,688
[SPEAKER_11]: You know they had expended some funds.

315
00:42:12,848 --> 00:42:14,769
[SPEAKER_11]: The Bedford High project obviously is the big.

316
00:42:15,402 --> 00:42:20,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Big outstanding question, I know you could talk more about that as a member of our comprehensive high school school building committee.

317
00:42:22,187 --> 00:42:30,914
[SPEAKER_11]: And then also, this is the first of three, I believe, Roberts, Brooks, and Missituk were all invited into this.

318
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,616
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's why the language is a little confusing.

319
00:42:33,976 --> 00:42:38,058
[SPEAKER_11]: We are in the accelerator repair in the early stages for all three schools.

320
00:42:38,478 --> 00:42:48,582
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think there's a point after the feasibility study stage or maybe even during that stage when the board of the MSBA formally moves the process forward.

321
00:42:48,602 --> 00:42:50,723
[SPEAKER_11]: I was saying this to Jenny the other day.

322
00:42:50,743 --> 00:42:55,886
[SPEAKER_11]: They really are big on flow charts over at the MSBA.

323
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:58,367
[SPEAKER_11]: There's about 10 steps for every project.

324
00:42:59,587 --> 00:43:14,319
[SPEAKER_11]: So if someone wanted to put forward a B paper that we hold a committee of the whole, invite our representatives from the administration and the Medford Public Schools to talk about all of the really important building projects that are going on in our schools, I think that would be great as well.

325
00:43:16,181 --> 00:43:17,662
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng.

326
00:43:19,724 --> 00:43:20,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Second, I would second that.

327
00:43:20,804 --> 00:43:24,788
[SPEAKER_06]: If Councilor Tseng is gonna make that motion for the B paper, I would absolutely second it.

328
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:38,198
[SPEAKER_06]: I do think it would be really helpful for the city council to have our building projects laid out with estimates for the costs, just so that we, even if we can put it on a timeline.

329
00:43:38,338 --> 00:43:46,263
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that the high school building committee that I meet with on a regular basis, the timeline is so,

330
00:43:49,095 --> 00:44:05,423
[SPEAKER_06]: complicated and dense and involves so many different elements that the other schools also having, you know, a new layer to it can be, it can be, it's very involved, but it's nice for us to see it laid out.

331
00:44:05,903 --> 00:44:10,205
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it would be useful as long as it didn't feel like it was too many redundant meetings.

332
00:44:10,765 --> 00:44:17,969
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe it's just a matter of the school committee holding something similar to that, or, or they, maybe they have a like,

333
00:44:18,737 --> 00:44:27,842
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe they have a building subcommittee that we could attend just to see what their plans are or what the needs are.

334
00:44:28,823 --> 00:44:46,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know a lot of us have talked about at different points funding the schools as one of our first priorities and making sure that that's something we don't lose track of in the course of governing, that funding the schools needs to be a high priority for Medford.

335
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:50,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Vice President Lazzaro.

336
00:44:50,491 --> 00:45:09,021
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Vice President Lazzaro to hold a committee of the whole meeting and invite representatives from the city administration and our Medford Public Schools to discuss the several school building projects that are either in progress or on track to begin.

337
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:11,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

338
00:45:13,704 --> 00:45:14,585
[SPEAKER_11]: This is on the B paper.

339
00:45:17,566 --> 00:45:18,387
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Callahan.

340
00:45:20,787 --> 00:45:21,988
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Lazzaro?

341
00:45:22,468 --> 00:45:22,748
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

342
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:24,929
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Leming?

343
00:45:24,949 --> 00:45:25,009
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

344
00:45:26,569 --> 00:45:27,270
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Mullane?

345
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:27,370
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

346
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:29,631
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli?

347
00:45:30,231 --> 00:45:30,511
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

348
00:45:31,672 --> 00:45:32,412
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Tseng?

349
00:45:34,133 --> 00:45:34,193
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

350
00:45:34,233 --> 00:45:34,893
[SPEAKER_17]: President Villescaz?

351
00:45:34,993 --> 00:45:35,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

352
00:45:35,193 --> 00:45:36,454
[SPEAKER_11]: I have the affirmative and the negative.

353
00:45:36,474 --> 00:45:37,414
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion passes.

354
00:45:38,214 --> 00:45:42,036
[SPEAKER_11]: On the main paper, Vice President Lazzaro's motion to approve, seconded by?

355
00:45:43,617 --> 00:45:45,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by Councilor Leming.

356
00:45:45,397 --> 00:45:46,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

357
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:48,859
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Callahan?

358
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,421
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Lazzaro.

359
00:45:51,981 --> 00:45:52,241
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

360
00:45:53,642 --> 00:45:54,423
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Leming.

361
00:45:54,443 --> 00:45:55,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

362
00:45:55,964 --> 00:45:56,624
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Malayne.

363
00:45:56,644 --> 00:45:56,704
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

364
00:45:58,326 --> 00:45:59,286
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli.

365
00:46:00,167 --> 00:46:00,447
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

366
00:46:01,948 --> 00:46:02,689
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Tseng.

367
00:46:02,709 --> 00:46:03,929
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

368
00:46:03,949 --> 00:46:04,650
[SPEAKER_17]: President Bears.

369
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:05,731
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

370
00:46:05,911 --> 00:46:08,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Having the affirmative, none the negative, the motion passes.

371
00:46:08,953 --> 00:46:14,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Motions, orders and resolutions 26017 offered by Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Callahan and Councilor Tseng.

372
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:24,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Resolution to condemn the killing of Renee Nicole, Nicole Renee, Renee Nicole Goode by ICE and reaffirm constitutional rights of residents.

373
00:46:24,494 --> 00:46:34,902
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas on January 7th, 2026, Renee Nicole Goode was a bystander to an action by Immigrations and Custom Enforcement, ICE in Minneapolis, tried to leave the scene and was shot in her car by ICE officer Jonathan Ross.

374
00:46:35,182 --> 00:46:41,347
[SPEAKER_11]: And whereas mentored residents have observed and recorded ICE operations as they have a right to under the laws of this country, commonwealth, and city.

375
00:46:42,067 --> 00:46:47,374
[SPEAKER_11]: And whereas it is the duty of Medford local government and law enforcement to protect the safety and well-being of Medford residents.

376
00:46:48,035 --> 00:46:59,790
[SPEAKER_11]: And whereas there is no legal code or precedent known to the Medford City Council that prohibits local law enforcement from intervening against agents, be they local, state, or federal, engaged in unlawful behaviors, especially those which put residents in danger.

377
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:14,338
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Medford City Council condemns the killing of Renee Nicole Goode by an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis on January 7th, 2026, and expresses its deep concern over the loss of life and the circumstances surrounding this incident.

378
00:47:14,919 --> 00:47:21,803
[SPEAKER_11]: And be it further resolved that the Medford City Council reaffirms the fundamental rights of residents to peacefully protest and to observe and document law enforcement activity

379
00:47:22,283 --> 00:47:28,629
[SPEAKER_11]: including the conduct of federal immigration officers consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States and Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

380
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:44,244
[SPEAKER_11]: And be it further resolved that the Committee on Public Health and Community Safety is directed to work with city administration and local law enforcement to review and develop strategies, protocols, and responses that protect residents' rights to peaceful protest and lawful observation and preserve public safety and community trust.

381
00:47:44,825 --> 00:48:05,155
[SPEAKER_11]: be it further resolved that the committee on public health and community safety is directed to work with the city administration and local law enforcement to develop and articulate to the public a clear policy governing responses to active ICE actions within the city of Medford that prioritizes resident safety, security, and rights over untested, unsupported, or otherwise ambiguous and uncertain interpretations of law.

382
00:48:05,795 --> 00:48:18,960
[SPEAKER_11]: And be it further resolved that the Committee on Public Health and Community Safety is further directed to engage with community groups, residents, and relevant advocacy organizations to identify best practices and preventative measures to reduce the risk of similar incidents occurring in the city of Medford.

383
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,001
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Tseng.

384
00:48:22,061 --> 00:48:24,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for reading that, President Bears.

385
00:48:25,743 --> 00:48:29,644
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a city councilor here in Medford, and that is a profound honor for me.

386
00:48:30,104 --> 00:48:31,545
[SPEAKER_09]: But another profound honor

387
00:48:32,365 --> 00:48:40,847
[SPEAKER_09]: one that I've carried with me every day of my life, is that, like many of you, like many of the people watching this meeting, I'm the child of immigrants.

388
00:48:41,787 --> 00:48:52,590
[SPEAKER_09]: I've always called Medford home, and what made it home was not just the place on the map, but the people who filled it, the people who call it home, the diversity that we are blessed with.

389
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:58,451
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't matter what color someone's skin was when we were putting on the spring show at Spotlight Productions.

390
00:48:59,294 --> 00:49:03,116
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't matter what color someone's skin was on the basketball court during recess.

391
00:49:04,076 --> 00:49:08,679
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't matter where someone's parents came from when you walked into their corner shop after school.

392
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:20,545
[SPEAKER_09]: And that quiet, everyday belonging, that belonging that's lived out in classrooms and playgrounds and sidewalks is the fabric of America, and it's the fabric of our home.

393
00:49:21,565 --> 00:49:24,427
[SPEAKER_09]: And Medford has been that kind of home for a long time.

394
00:49:25,849 --> 00:49:45,583
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a place where Irish and Italian families put down roots, where Jewish families built synagogues and small businesses, where Haitian, Brazilian, Latin American, Asian American families have arrived seeking the same things that generations before them sought, safety, dignity, opportunity, and a chance to belong.

395
00:49:47,724 --> 00:49:50,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Different languages, different traditions, different journeys,

396
00:49:51,837 --> 00:49:57,099
[SPEAKER_09]: but the same hope, the same belief that this city could be a place to build a life.

397
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,321
[SPEAKER_09]: And today we see that that diverse fabric is under strain.

398
00:50:03,682 --> 00:50:10,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Across our country, masked federal agents are showing up not as guardians of safety, but as instruments of fear.

399
00:50:11,297 --> 00:50:26,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Despite national politicians telling us to ignore the evidence of our eyes and ears, we've all seen the video of Jonathan Ross, an ICE agent, shooting Renee Nicole Goode, an innocent bystander, while she was simply trying to leave the scene and get home.

400
00:50:27,513 --> 00:50:35,200
[SPEAKER_09]: We've seen images of ICE agents threatening and beating people who stand in their way, or who they think stand in their way.

401
00:50:37,051 --> 00:50:40,973
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is not something happening somewhere else to someone else.

402
00:50:41,934 --> 00:50:48,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Even here in Medford, residents have watched members of our own community taken off our streets in broad daylight.

403
00:50:49,298 --> 00:50:54,081
[SPEAKER_09]: For too many of our neighbors, fear has become a constant companion.

404
00:50:55,241 --> 00:50:56,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Kids are afraid to go to school.

405
00:50:56,982 --> 00:50:58,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Parents are afraid to drop them off.

406
00:50:59,238 --> 00:51:07,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Immigrants are afraid to reach out for help from police, from city staff, because they fear that asking for help could lead to deportation.

407
00:51:08,988 --> 00:51:14,434
[SPEAKER_09]: And ordinary residents worry that a routine drive home could turn into something unthinkable.

408
00:51:16,096 --> 00:51:18,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking personally, I worry about my parents.

409
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,741
[SPEAKER_09]: I carry my passport card with me.

410
00:51:21,702 --> 00:51:33,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Because in moments like these, we're reminded that when power is exercised without restraint, without accountability, simply looking different can be treated as grounds for suspicion.

411
00:51:34,693 --> 00:51:37,996
[SPEAKER_09]: But Medford has never been a city that surrenders to fear.

412
00:51:39,177 --> 00:51:43,040
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have to accept a world where hate defines our future.

413
00:51:43,861 --> 00:51:48,765
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have to accept a world where violence is normalized and accountability is optional.

414
00:51:49,624 --> 00:51:56,692
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have to accept a world where our neighbors live with a constant fear of being disappeared from their own community.

415
00:51:57,513 --> 00:51:59,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead, we can choose something better.

416
00:52:00,877 --> 00:52:10,047
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been deeply moved as a son of immigrants by the way that this community has responded, by the way that you all have shown up for one another.

417
00:52:11,649 --> 00:52:26,075
[SPEAKER_09]: The vigil held before tonight's meeting is a reminder that Medford, the birthplace of the American Revolution more than 250 years ago, still understands what it means to stand for liberty, not just in word, but in deed.

418
00:52:26,956 --> 00:52:31,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Because liberty, justice, and hope are not self-executing.

419
00:52:32,518 --> 00:52:33,199
[SPEAKER_09]: They're choices.

420
00:52:33,959 --> 00:52:36,000
[SPEAKER_09]: They're choices that we make together.

421
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:49,224
[SPEAKER_09]: This city has taught me something powerful, that when we stand together, when we imagine and dream boldly, when we act bravely, we can build a place where no one has to live in fear.

422
00:52:50,705 --> 00:53:00,968
[SPEAKER_09]: That when local communities like ours lead, when we refuse to look away, we reclaim a measure of power that can never be taken away from us.

423
00:53:02,769 --> 00:53:04,990
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the work that this city council has been doing.

424
00:53:06,493 --> 00:53:21,598
[SPEAKER_09]: We know that real safety grows from trust, and we know that trust grows from partnership between this council, City Hall, our delegation on Beacon Hill, and the people who live in our communities and walk our streets every single day.

425
00:53:23,118 --> 00:53:25,979
[SPEAKER_09]: We aren't powerless, and we aren't bystanders.

426
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,720
[SPEAKER_09]: We can do better, and we must do better.

427
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:35,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight's resolution is about turning grief into responsibility and fear into resolve.

428
00:53:36,607 --> 00:53:45,451
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about making clear to our residents and our community that Medford will lead with humanity, will lead with courage, and will lead with care.

429
00:53:46,231 --> 00:53:54,895
[SPEAKER_09]: That we will protect the right to protest, the right to bear witness, and the right of every resident to feel safe in their own community.

430
00:53:56,416 --> 00:54:04,600
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about building upon our work, passing a welcoming city ordinance and reforming our Human Rights Commission, and making sure that work is followed.

431
00:54:06,362 --> 00:54:17,966
[SPEAKER_09]: History tells us that progress has never come from silence or complacency, but from ordinary people deciding that this moment, this moment demands action.

432
00:54:18,926 --> 00:54:27,249
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm proud to be part of a council that understands that, and I'm grateful to be part of a community that's ready to meet this moment together.

433
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:32,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

434
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:34,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Lazzaro, then Councilor Callahan.

435
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:46,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

436
00:54:46,248 --> 00:54:47,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

437
00:54:47,128 --> 00:54:50,349
[SPEAKER_06]: You put that really, really well.

438
00:54:50,369 --> 00:54:56,651
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to work on this resolution because it felt important to say something.

439
00:54:57,492 --> 00:55:10,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Many of our residents have witnessed ICE arrests, and one of our residents witnessed an ICE arrest most recently while walking outside with his

440
00:55:13,106 --> 00:55:14,847
[SPEAKER_06]: very young toddler in a stroller.

441
00:55:16,667 --> 00:55:42,315
[SPEAKER_06]: And it makes me feel very nervous about what it must feel like for people who live in Medford to see things that are happening across the country and to reach out to us as their representatives in local government and ask us what

442
00:55:44,092 --> 00:55:47,654
[SPEAKER_06]: what we can do to help make sure that they feel safe.

443
00:55:48,635 --> 00:56:05,685
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we can do as their representatives in local government, as the people that they can talk to, that we can then talk to the mayor's administration and other arms of local government, what we can do is we can say, this is what we're able to do for you.

444
00:56:05,745 --> 00:56:10,428
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how we can help you feel like you can be safe in the city.

445
00:56:12,698 --> 00:56:17,080
[SPEAKER_06]: we can activate different levers of local government.

446
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:29,524
[SPEAKER_06]: There are things that are happening in Medford under the radar and that's not what we can do.

447
00:56:29,824 --> 00:56:33,585
[SPEAKER_06]: What we can do as your representative in your government is we can say,

448
00:56:35,419 --> 00:56:38,581
[SPEAKER_06]: To the mayor's administration, we're asking for a little bit more.

449
00:56:38,601 --> 00:56:43,724
[SPEAKER_06]: We're asking for a little bit more safety, a little bit more security for the people who live here and work here and visit here.

450
00:56:44,845 --> 00:56:57,173
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can say to the Medford Police Department, can you please help the people who observe ICE arrests to feel a little bit more safe?

451
00:56:57,353 --> 00:56:58,734
[SPEAKER_06]: You're trained in de-escalation.

452
00:56:58,814 --> 00:57:02,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you come help de-escalate if something happens?

453
00:57:03,091 --> 00:57:14,882
[SPEAKER_06]: can you be helpful and make residents feel safe when something terrifying is happening before their eyes?

454
00:57:14,902 --> 00:57:26,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Our job as representatives in Medford is to hear the voices of our residents and to, you know,

455
00:57:29,229 --> 00:57:30,930
[SPEAKER_06]: answer their calls.

456
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:32,631
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what we did here.

457
00:57:32,791 --> 00:57:34,812
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we wrote this resolution.

458
00:57:37,113 --> 00:57:40,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like we talk about these things when something horrible happens a lot.

459
00:57:41,095 --> 00:57:54,543
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm starting to get tired of repeating myself about why it's un-American, why it's against all of our values to have

460
00:57:58,317 --> 00:58:05,038
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, rogue agents from the federal government picking up our neighbors and taking them away for no reason.

461
00:58:05,418 --> 00:58:10,319
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, now it's so much, it feels, it feels worse and worse every week.

462
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:16,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but we are just going to keep showing up.

463
00:58:17,121 --> 00:58:27,783
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to keep trying to do the things that we can do, um, to the best of our ability and within reason.

464
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:35,254
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to keep trying to do the most good we can do to protect our neighbors and protect our friends and protect our families.

465
00:58:36,355 --> 00:58:48,645
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to ask the Medford Police Department to keep us safe because they are the law enforcement department for Medford and

466
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:51,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford wants to feel safer.

467
00:58:52,051 --> 00:58:58,835
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm so delighted to chair, to continue to chair this term, the Public Health and Community Safety Committee.

468
00:58:59,795 --> 00:59:19,166
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will happily hold as many of those committee meetings as anybody wants to attend, where we can talk about how best to go about this, how we can make everybody who passes through Medford, lives in Medford, works in Medford,

469
00:59:19,892 --> 00:59:49,087
[SPEAKER_06]: visits Medford for any reason, how we can make everybody in Medford feel safe and secure, how we can make sure that all of the trainings that Medford police officers go through on de-escalation and public safety and how our incredibly well-trained police officers can use their powerful training to de-escalate situations where things have gotten out of hand

470
00:59:50,106 --> 00:59:51,968
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to see that put into practice.

471
00:59:52,829 --> 00:59:54,651
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's use that budget.

472
00:59:54,731 --> 00:59:56,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's use our police department.

473
00:59:58,235 --> 01:00:00,658
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're the good guys with the guns, let's have them be the good guys.

474
01:00:00,718 --> 01:00:02,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's come keep us safe.

475
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:07,405
[SPEAKER_06]: I would really, really love to see that in action.

476
01:00:09,603 --> 01:00:11,563
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would love to hold meetings where we talk more about it.

477
01:00:12,284 --> 01:00:15,104
[SPEAKER_06]: So I appreciate the opportunity to talk about this.

478
01:00:15,144 --> 01:00:22,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate all the people that reached out and asked us to put this resolution on and who supported it.

479
01:00:22,746 --> 01:00:25,666
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm happy to continue the conversation anytime.

480
01:00:26,286 --> 01:00:26,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

481
01:00:31,207 --> 01:00:33,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan, then Councilor Scarpelli.

482
01:00:37,209 --> 01:00:37,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

483
01:00:40,912 --> 01:01:03,974
[SPEAKER_05]: In 2000, 25 years ago, I was living in Los Angeles, and I attended the shadow convention of the DNC, the Democratic National Convention, because I felt that the Democratic Party at that time had moved too far toward corporate interests and away from working people.

484
01:01:05,767 --> 01:01:21,158
[SPEAKER_05]: And while I was there, I also went on a joint bike ride, which, by the way, in the charter of the city of Los Angeles, it is expressly condoned and encouraged for people to go on joint bike rides.

485
01:01:22,519 --> 01:01:25,641
[SPEAKER_05]: During that bicycle ride, we were escorted by the police.

486
01:01:26,002 --> 01:01:27,923
[SPEAKER_05]: We were escorted underneath the 10 freeway.

487
01:01:28,583 --> 01:01:29,864
[SPEAKER_05]: They blocked it off at the front.

488
01:01:30,045 --> 01:01:32,967
[SPEAKER_05]: They shoved us all in at the back, and they arrested everyone that they could.

489
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:35,614
[SPEAKER_05]: They threw us in jail for three days.

490
01:01:38,255 --> 01:01:41,695
[SPEAKER_05]: The women, and only the women, were illegally strip searched twice.

491
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:45,756
[SPEAKER_05]: They paraded us in front of the general population of men over and over.

492
01:01:50,817 --> 01:01:57,878
[SPEAKER_05]: They refused to give people who needed medicine, like a woman who had epilepsy, they refused to give her her medication.

493
01:01:59,798 --> 01:02:02,919
[SPEAKER_05]: They had put us up against chain link fences,

494
01:02:04,777 --> 01:02:08,760
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were covered in oil from these fences.

495
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:13,283
[SPEAKER_05]: We were all in our biking gear in the summertime.

496
01:02:15,544 --> 01:02:18,126
[SPEAKER_05]: It was freezing cold inside the jail.

497
01:02:18,766 --> 01:02:20,347
[SPEAKER_05]: They would not allow us to wash.

498
01:02:27,289 --> 01:02:31,052
[SPEAKER_05]: During the night time, during the two nights, they turned the lights on and off.

499
01:02:31,192 --> 01:02:31,912
[SPEAKER_05]: They would wake us up.

500
01:02:32,232 --> 01:02:34,294
[SPEAKER_05]: They would tell us they had to count us, that it was morning.

501
01:02:34,714 --> 01:02:37,336
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they would turn the lights off again and tell us to go back to sleep.

502
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:46,122
[SPEAKER_05]: When we got up on the third day to go to the court, they put us on buses.

503
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:56,882
[SPEAKER_05]: They drove us around for two hours, and then they dropped us off at the courthouse, which was across the street from the jail.

504
01:02:56,942 --> 01:02:57,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.

505
01:02:57,722 --> 01:03:06,325
[SPEAKER_05]: They chained us with chains that handcuffed our hands and our feet, and then had to chain from between the hands and the feet.

506
01:03:08,306 --> 01:03:12,127
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they drove us around for two hours to drop us off across the street from the courthouse.

507
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:28,258
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the women, her handcuffs that had been on her when she was first arrested were so tight that she ended up completely losing the feeling in three of her fingers on one hand, permanently.

508
01:03:33,541 --> 01:03:35,342
[SPEAKER_05]: And two of the people that were with us,

509
01:03:37,988 --> 01:03:39,809
[SPEAKER_05]: had not even been on the bike ride.

510
01:03:40,270 --> 01:03:47,594
[SPEAKER_05]: They had been, they were a professor couple, they were both professors at one of the local colleges, and they had been bicycling to work.

511
01:03:50,075 --> 01:03:55,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Their experience was, oh gosh, there's a lot of bicyclists on our bike ride today.

512
01:03:56,339 --> 01:03:57,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that strange?

513
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:00,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh gosh, there are a lot of police on our bike ride today.

514
01:04:00,562 --> 01:04:01,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that strange?

515
01:04:01,982 --> 01:04:03,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh gosh, we're being arrested.

516
01:04:03,463 --> 01:04:06,285
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they were thrown in jail for three days.

517
01:04:13,303 --> 01:04:28,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how many people remember the Rampart scandal, but around that time period, the Rampart District in Los Angeles, the police department there, was basically completely lawless.

518
01:04:30,156 --> 01:04:40,705
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were eventually, a judge determined that they were going to allow them to be charged under the RICO,

519
01:04:41,665 --> 01:04:46,489
[SPEAKER_05]: statute, which is for criminal mafia organizations.

520
01:04:48,131 --> 01:04:58,780
[SPEAKER_05]: They ended up being convicted of many things, including planting evidence, illegal detentions, arresting people who were completely innocent, robbing banks.

521
01:04:59,421 --> 01:05:01,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was complete lawlessness.

522
01:05:05,806 --> 01:05:08,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I mention this experience because

523
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:15,917
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been receiving emails from residents.

524
01:05:17,718 --> 01:05:38,067
[SPEAKER_05]: And these emails are from people who are saying to me, I am not an immigrant, I have never broken the law, I have never been afraid of law enforcement in my life.

525
01:05:38,087 --> 01:05:39,828
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was my experience in 2002.

526
01:05:39,948 --> 01:05:41,129
[SPEAKER_05]: I believed in officer-friendly.

527
01:05:42,435 --> 01:05:43,096
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a shock.

528
01:05:43,236 --> 01:05:47,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Every hour that I was there, I couldn't believe what was happening.

529
01:05:49,240 --> 01:06:05,213
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I am seeing happen now is people in our city are genuinely afraid that this is going to happen to them, that they might be shot in the face and killed.

530
01:06:09,054 --> 01:06:25,525
[SPEAKER_05]: that what people are seeing is that ICE agents around the country are lawless, and that nothing can prevent them from killing completely innocent people.

531
01:06:31,386 --> 01:06:36,232
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do hope that the administration will take this seriously.

532
01:06:36,933 --> 01:06:39,737
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it is important that we can protect our residents.

533
01:06:39,897 --> 01:06:50,210
[SPEAKER_05]: I unfortunately believe that there is some real possibility that the current administration will target the Boston area.

534
01:06:54,059 --> 01:07:00,542
[SPEAKER_05]: And as people who know me may know, I do really like to engage people in the political process.

535
01:07:00,722 --> 01:07:05,985
[SPEAKER_05]: And I invite anyone who is interested to reach out to me.

536
01:07:07,226 --> 01:07:10,188
[SPEAKER_05]: I will be writing a motion or an ordinance.

537
01:07:10,208 --> 01:07:12,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be working with Councilor Tseng on this.

538
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:19,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe we should have something that at least puts in writing

539
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:27,385
[SPEAKER_05]: what law enforcement agencies are allowed and not allowed to do within the city limits of Medford.

540
01:07:27,445 --> 01:07:44,369
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will be putting forward something that states both that they need to follow the constitution in the case of search and seizure laws, but also that law enforcement agencies need to, they cannot mask themselves.

541
01:07:46,712 --> 01:07:50,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Our local Medford police, they take pride in their work.

542
01:07:50,556 --> 01:07:51,537
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a badge.

543
01:07:51,797 --> 01:07:52,698
[SPEAKER_05]: It has their name.

544
01:07:52,718 --> 01:07:53,779
[SPEAKER_05]: They show their face.

545
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:57,563
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how law enforcement agents should operate.

546
01:07:59,525 --> 01:08:06,112
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also invite people who are listening to this, people who care about this, people who have reached out to us and are concerned,

547
01:08:07,466 --> 01:08:14,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Please, I've said this before, please let us know anything that we can do, anything that we can do to help.

548
01:08:14,452 --> 01:08:23,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I will say, it is a very frightening time, and we are searching for ways that we can help.

549
01:08:23,139 --> 01:08:24,820
[SPEAKER_05]: We are doing everything that we can.

550
01:08:25,981 --> 01:08:27,862
[SPEAKER_05]: So I encourage people to reach out to us.

551
01:08:28,762 --> 01:08:37,146
[SPEAKER_05]: We will do everything we can think of, but if you have ideas, please do let us know, and let me know if you'd like to help in writing the ordinance that I spoke about.

552
01:08:38,847 --> 01:08:43,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think this is a pressing issue that we need to deal with.

553
01:08:44,189 --> 01:08:44,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

554
01:08:52,172 --> 01:08:53,213
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

555
01:08:53,233 --> 01:08:55,154
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to go to Councilor Scarpelli.

556
01:08:56,554 --> 01:08:57,655
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Villescaz.

557
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:08,807
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I start with sharing my concerns that doesn't follow.

558
01:09:08,827 --> 01:09:13,190
[SPEAKER_18]: I know people looking at this and saying, oh, is this the other side?

559
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:16,092
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think this is something that doesn't have a side.

560
01:09:16,112 --> 01:09:25,358
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a situation that I've been dealing with for many, many years with the kids that I've coached and taught.

561
01:09:28,141 --> 01:09:47,006
[SPEAKER_18]: and watched them when they lost their option through DACA and lost that legal right to become citizens and coming full circle now, I'm dealing with their younger brothers and sisters and I'm dealing with those individuals that are failing the fair.

562
01:09:48,407 --> 01:09:52,148
[SPEAKER_18]: No different than when I presented how I felt and

563
01:09:52,708 --> 01:10:11,505
[SPEAKER_18]: how the community wanted me to share their input and the importance with the way our Jewish community felt with how they felt in fear of walking the streets of Medford during some past conflicts we've had on this council and some motions we put forth.

564
01:10:14,007 --> 01:10:17,188
[SPEAKER_18]: But when we look at the situation, this is real.

565
01:10:17,208 --> 01:10:20,509
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, we could say it's not happening, but unfortunately it is.

566
01:10:22,290 --> 01:10:31,073
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm trying to work with the family right now here in Medford and their children were supposed to participate in an event that

567
01:10:34,194 --> 01:10:39,735
[SPEAKER_18]: that they should be celebrating, but out of fear, they stayed home and they lost that opportunity.

568
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:41,716
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's not right.

569
01:10:41,916 --> 01:11:01,141
[SPEAKER_18]: And I look at, I know it's easy to point at the police and maybe blame them and say they can do more, but they've come before us time after time explaining their situation, their limitations or their knowledge of what's happening on the federal side.

570
01:11:03,624 --> 01:11:16,913
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I one person that we haven't heard yet, the leader of our community, um, I think needs to stand up and play her role.

571
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:21,276
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think, um, whatever, whatever she decides,

572
01:11:22,747 --> 01:11:24,448
[SPEAKER_18]: I think our community is looking for a leader.

573
01:11:24,529 --> 01:11:39,521
[SPEAKER_18]: Our community is looking for the mayor to stand up and say, this is what we need to do with more of a stance, more of a belief in what we should be doing and at least guide our neighbors that are in fear that they need support.

574
01:11:41,643 --> 01:11:45,326
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, this doesn't matter what side you're on or how you feel.

575
01:11:45,386 --> 01:11:48,429
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think my colleagues have said it best that

576
01:11:49,311 --> 01:11:52,615
[SPEAKER_18]: Medford's a very diverse community, and we love Medford for its diversity.

577
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:56,118
[SPEAKER_18]: And I've been a beneficiary of it.

578
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:02,425
[SPEAKER_18]: There was an article back when I was coaching the high school soccer team that called my team the United Nations team.

579
01:12:03,246 --> 01:12:07,530
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe we had 16 different nationalities with 16 different languages.

580
01:12:08,235 --> 01:12:09,778
[SPEAKER_18]: And we had so much pride with that.

581
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:13,965
[SPEAKER_18]: And the kids were so, so proud to be Mephit Mustangs.

582
01:12:14,345 --> 01:12:21,077
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want to bring this full circle because I know we talk about it's not in our neighborhood today.

583
01:12:22,478 --> 01:12:25,600
[SPEAKER_18]: but our neighbors are telling us that's how they feel.

584
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:28,882
[SPEAKER_18]: And they need us to stand up and be accountable.

585
01:12:29,202 --> 01:12:38,128
[SPEAKER_18]: And I asked my colleagues to implore the mayor to stand up and really help us guide us.

586
01:12:38,208 --> 01:12:50,816
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think my colleagues have put it best when they said, share the guidelines that our residents know, that communication level that we've been lacking so much of lately in this community.

587
01:12:52,877 --> 01:12:54,137
[SPEAKER_18]: find an avenue to help.

588
01:12:55,918 --> 01:13:15,106
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been working very hard in my neighboring community where we have identified avenues that I can work with as a program developer in Parks and Recreation to guide families to SOIA, where they're working directly to find attorneys to make sure that families are protected.

589
01:13:15,606 --> 01:13:17,867
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I think that's all people are looking for.

590
01:13:17,927 --> 01:13:18,888
[SPEAKER_18]: They want to make sure that

591
01:13:19,488 --> 01:13:23,191
[SPEAKER_18]: The people that empower and believe it or not, um.

592
01:13:24,792 --> 01:13:29,775
[SPEAKER_18]: There are a lot of people that just come to this country or weren't born in this country.

593
01:13:29,835 --> 01:13:30,896
[SPEAKER_18]: Look at our body.

594
01:13:31,756 --> 01:13:36,760
[SPEAKER_18]: And look at us with much respect and honor, and they look at us for that guidance and that leadership.

595
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,301
[SPEAKER_18]: And the least we can do is.

596
01:13:41,499 --> 01:13:46,702
[SPEAKER_18]: Give them the opportunity or give them the knowledge of what they can do and where they can go for support.

597
01:13:47,403 --> 01:13:47,983
[SPEAKER_18]: And, um.

598
01:13:48,744 --> 01:13:59,190
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I, I, again, this is this is like, we've talked about it's difficult because the police have told us what they can do and their limitations and what they are mandated to do.

599
01:13:59,831 --> 01:14:01,672
[SPEAKER_18]: And they do have pride in what they do every day.

600
01:14:02,732 --> 01:14:19,180
[SPEAKER_18]: But at the same time, I think the mayor has to come out as a leader of our community and be more on the forefront of this, this, this concern when you see the emails and the questions and the fear that are coming to us in emails and phone calls.

601
01:14:21,342 --> 01:14:21,782
[SPEAKER_18]: So, again,

602
01:14:24,452 --> 01:14:33,415
[SPEAKER_18]: stand up, um, be a leader and let's put something together that we can all be proud of so we can support our neighbors that aren't fair.

603
01:14:34,135 --> 01:14:39,617
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, it's easy to say that we have neighbors that feel like this isn't happening.

604
01:14:39,677 --> 01:14:45,439
[SPEAKER_18]: And the truth of the matter is a lot of people aren't seeing it and they don't see it in Medford, but it is happening.

605
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:46,899
[SPEAKER_18]: I can, I can attest to that.

606
01:14:47,599 --> 01:14:49,900
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and, um,

607
01:14:51,794 --> 01:15:11,731
[SPEAKER_18]: We need the power of the mayor's office to stand up and put a plan in place that would give those residents that are in fear a specific location where they can go for support and know that their leaders are standing with them and they have support.

608
01:15:12,732 --> 01:15:15,735
[SPEAKER_18]: So I can go on and on, Mr. President, but

609
01:15:17,552 --> 01:15:28,656
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate the point that we need to really stand up and make sure all of our neighbors feel safe, whether it's, um, uh, issues in the past that we battled with, you know, across the aisle.

610
01:15:29,237 --> 01:15:37,080
[SPEAKER_18]: But, uh, for this situation, I think we all stand together and saying that, um, uh, our neighbors need us to be leaders.

611
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:38,060
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you.

612
01:15:40,221 --> 01:15:40,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

613
01:15:40,521 --> 01:15:41,381
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli.

614
01:15:44,683 --> 01:15:45,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Mullane.

615
01:15:46,851 --> 01:15:47,211
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

616
01:15:48,693 --> 01:15:52,816
[SPEAKER_28]: I wanted to thank my fellow Councilors for putting this resolution forward.

617
01:15:53,797 --> 01:15:57,461
[SPEAKER_28]: But most importantly, I wanted to thank the residents of Medford.

618
01:15:58,382 --> 01:16:10,473
[SPEAKER_28]: So many of you have reached out and sent emails wanting to make sure that this was a pressing issue for us, for the administration, for everyone to take notice.

619
01:16:11,754 --> 01:16:15,999
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm proud to be here with all of you in this and in support of it.

620
01:16:17,581 --> 01:16:27,413
[SPEAKER_28]: Even in the short turnaround time on January 11th when there was about 100 residents of Medford that very quickly got pulled together to make a statement.

621
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:38,280
[SPEAKER_28]: I was proud to be there and stand with everyone, and I was so impressed with those of you that put all of this together and to ensure that our voices were starting to be heard.

622
01:16:39,081 --> 01:16:42,704
[SPEAKER_28]: And I want to continue to say, please keep doing that.

623
01:16:42,804 --> 01:16:44,205
[SPEAKER_28]: Please keep pushing that forward.

624
01:16:44,745 --> 01:16:47,227
[SPEAKER_28]: You have, obviously, the support of many of us here.

625
01:16:48,248 --> 01:16:50,290
[SPEAKER_28]: This is an incredibly important issue.

626
01:16:51,571 --> 01:17:10,386
[SPEAKER_28]: It's unbelievable that we're facing this, but I have to say, seeing how quickly and how supportive so many Medford residents have been to get something done and to protect our neighbors, I'm just so impressed, and I want to thank all of you for that as well.

627
01:17:10,886 --> 01:17:11,347
[SPEAKER_28]: So thank you.

628
01:17:13,831 --> 01:17:14,792
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Millan.

629
01:17:14,892 --> 01:17:15,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Leming.

630
01:17:18,816 --> 01:17:22,520
[SPEAKER_16]: Nothing to fear, but fear itself.

631
01:17:23,441 --> 01:17:34,772
[SPEAKER_16]: Thinking about that quote a lot the past few days, FDR, which isn't entirely true in these circumstances, but there are important elements to it.

632
01:17:36,173 --> 01:17:42,235
[SPEAKER_16]: You see your country slowly descending into authoritarianism.

633
01:17:42,295 --> 01:17:47,996
[SPEAKER_16]: It's important to understand that fear is a major element of that.

634
01:17:48,896 --> 01:17:51,637
[SPEAKER_16]: When people are scared, they're more complicit.

635
01:17:51,697 --> 01:17:52,897
[SPEAKER_16]: It's easier to control them.

636
01:17:54,718 --> 01:17:59,499
[SPEAKER_16]: Showing an example from our elected officials that we're not afraid, statements.

637
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:08,310
[SPEAKER_16]: do a lot to ease that fear, does a lot to make the populace a lot harder to control.

638
01:18:08,451 --> 01:18:11,592
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a very important element to understand here.

639
01:18:12,713 --> 01:18:19,617
[SPEAKER_16]: When folks are out front, events like that, vigils like that, help people to be less afraid.

640
01:18:21,398 --> 01:18:27,506
[SPEAKER_16]: So the psychological aspect, everybody needs to remember.

641
01:18:28,327 --> 01:18:31,070
[SPEAKER_16]: If you're afraid, you're losing the battle.

642
01:18:31,911 --> 01:18:37,598
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you see your neighbors are afraid, you need to connect them, network them.

643
01:18:37,758 --> 01:18:40,181
[SPEAKER_16]: The more people you know, the less afraid you're gonna be.

644
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:59,029
[SPEAKER_16]: I was standing outside with the vigil in the cold with everybody else as I saw people freezing their fingers off as they listened to their neighbors talk about what's happening, as they listened to folks say what needed to be said.

645
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:05,012
[SPEAKER_16]: But I also knew a lot of people outside.

646
01:19:06,633 --> 01:19:11,178
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, the people that come to City Hall, the people that come to these vigils, often they already know each other.

647
01:19:11,239 --> 01:19:13,861
[SPEAKER_16]: Often they're already networked with each other.

648
01:19:13,942 --> 01:19:16,004
[SPEAKER_16]: Often we know about the loose hotlines.

649
01:19:16,064 --> 01:19:26,195
[SPEAKER_16]: We know where to go, who to connect with if somebody is, if one of our friends gets abducted.

650
01:19:28,348 --> 01:19:39,017
[SPEAKER_16]: The folks, the reason that they're going after non-citizens, the reason they're going after immigrants is because those are the people who are most vulnerable.

651
01:19:39,517 --> 01:19:41,679
[SPEAKER_16]: Those are the folks who are most susceptible to fear.

652
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:50,867
[SPEAKER_16]: Those are the folks who try to keep their, try to lay low, keep their heads down, are afraid of being detained and deported.

653
01:19:52,088 --> 01:19:56,912
[SPEAKER_16]: And just as important as it is to connect with each other, it's important to try to connect with them.

654
01:19:57,968 --> 01:20:19,626
[SPEAKER_16]: to try to find the folks you may know, even if not very well, and see if they're aware of the resources available to them, if they're aware of lawyers, if they're aware of hotlines, if they're aware of alerts about where ICE is going to be, and connect them with folks in the community who know about ICE.

655
01:20:20,849 --> 01:20:23,471
[SPEAKER_16]: these resources, you know about these opportunities.

656
01:20:23,551 --> 01:20:29,695
[SPEAKER_16]: So yes, it is important for the city to act.

657
01:20:29,755 --> 01:20:40,001
[SPEAKER_16]: We have done a lot of the legislative actions that we can, and it is important for elected officials, leaders in the community to step up.

658
01:20:40,922 --> 01:20:48,627
[SPEAKER_16]: It's also important to make sure that folks who are the most vulnerable are connected, and that often requires

659
01:20:49,267 --> 01:20:59,271
[SPEAKER_16]: breaking out of our own circles, talking to people who we're not used to talking to, and making sure that we really have a very widely connected community.

660
01:21:03,493 --> 01:21:10,055
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what I wanted to say tonight, and I look forward to hearing other folks talk as well.

661
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:11,936
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you very much for coming out here.

662
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:17,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

663
01:21:33,028 --> 01:21:52,178
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we are in an incredibly dangerous time, and as everyone here has said tonight, I mean, I think you hear the unity that it's not about sides, it's not about

664
01:21:54,793 --> 01:21:59,936
[SPEAKER_11]: who supports what party or who supports what person.

665
01:21:59,956 --> 01:22:03,658
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about right and it's about right and wrong.

666
01:22:05,459 --> 01:22:11,662
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's about what leadership looks like.

667
01:22:12,142 --> 01:22:17,525
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we need to ask ourselves, what does leadership look like in this moment?

668
01:22:18,006 --> 01:22:20,447
[SPEAKER_11]: What do leaders look like in this moment?

669
01:22:22,593 --> 01:22:33,097
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not about individual leaders or someone's gonna come down from upon high and save us, whether that's a mayor or a governor or a congressman or a senator.

670
01:22:33,117 --> 01:22:46,162
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we see in Minneapolis and in Medford that it's about what each of us looks inside to find, the leadership within us.

671
01:22:47,582 --> 01:22:49,283
[SPEAKER_11]: We saw hundreds of people

672
01:22:50,659 --> 01:22:54,582
[SPEAKER_11]: standing in the cold tonight here in Medford, saying this is wrong.

673
01:22:54,762 --> 01:22:58,185
[SPEAKER_11]: We saw city councilors and school committee members.

674
01:22:59,126 --> 01:23:01,167
[SPEAKER_11]: We saw poet laureates.

675
01:23:01,268 --> 01:23:17,200
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we saw just regular people, kids, parents, grandparents, moms, dads, sisters, brothers, people who've lived here for a few months, people who've lived here for 50 years.

676
01:23:19,586 --> 01:23:28,911
[SPEAKER_11]: all coming together in the cold because they're scared, but they know that things can be better and they should be better.

677
01:23:29,871 --> 01:23:48,981
[SPEAKER_11]: I was really inspired by what our poet laureate, Max Heinig said tonight, not just calling this what it is, a police state rising authoritarianism, what Councilor Callahan described her experience we're seeing

678
01:23:51,115 --> 01:23:53,077
[SPEAKER_11]: in multiplicity in Minneapolis.

679
01:23:53,137 --> 01:24:19,939
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, just the stories that you hear, the fear on the streets, the thousands of people, ice at every corner, jackboot-masked men acting with quote-unquote absolute immunity in the name of their dear leader, not in the name of the Constitution, certainly targeting the most vulnerable, but more and more and more with impunity, targeting anyone who stands in their way, not only abducting them,

680
01:24:21,048 --> 01:24:28,350
[SPEAKER_11]: and imprisoning them, and dehumanizing them, and stripping them of their basic human rights and decency, but shooting them.

681
01:24:31,090 --> 01:24:39,572
[SPEAKER_11]: And there are words for that, words like brown shirts, and Gestapo, and martial law.

682
01:24:40,512 --> 01:24:42,793
[SPEAKER_11]: And today, we saw, um,

683
01:24:45,973 --> 01:24:54,178
[SPEAKER_11]: that the elected leaders in Minneapolis and in Minnesota are being investigated and subpoenas are being pulled upon them and they're being prosecuted.

684
01:24:54,718 --> 01:25:08,926
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's because at this point, whether it's ICE or the prosecutors who are left in the Justice Department, because all the ones who knew this was illegal have resigned, don't care about the law.

685
01:25:10,026 --> 01:25:12,808
[SPEAKER_11]: And when we talk about what leadership looks like

686
01:25:13,908 --> 01:25:19,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's important that we pass a welcoming city ordinance to put our non-cooperation policy into the law.

687
01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:21,651
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, it's important that we believe in the rule of law.

688
01:25:21,691 --> 01:25:38,038
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think we also have to recognize in this moment that the people at the highest levels of power who are using public money to create militarized police force to suppress dissent and take away our rights to free speech and assembly, they don't really care about the law very much.

689
01:25:39,517 --> 01:25:56,200
[SPEAKER_11]: And so if we say, and we stand by, whether that's this group on the city council or the leadership in city hall, and we say, well, the law says that we can't do anything, then they're gonna come here and they're gonna do what they wanna do because they don't care about the law.

690
01:25:56,660 --> 01:26:07,703
[SPEAKER_11]: And when they don't care about the law, and we do care about the law, and they don't care about the law to do whatever they want, and we do care about the law to stop ourselves from fighting back, that is when

691
01:26:09,835 --> 01:26:12,317
[SPEAKER_11]: what Matt said, wins, right?

692
01:26:12,357 --> 01:26:14,259
[SPEAKER_11]: That's when authoritarianism wins.

693
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:26,370
[SPEAKER_11]: Whether it's complete ignorance of the law or manipulation of the law or passing a law that says we can do whatever we want, that's when authoritarianism wins.

694
01:26:27,171 --> 01:26:32,216
[SPEAKER_11]: So I understand and I respect that it's a difficult moment and a difficult position.

695
01:26:35,505 --> 01:26:51,697
[SPEAKER_11]: for people who have spent their lives devoted to the rule of law and believing that the law will eventually uphold justice to come to grips with the reality that that may not be true right now.

696
01:26:53,078 --> 01:27:00,203
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't think we're gonna solve that problem here tonight, but I think we need to start having the conversation about what it means when a lawless

697
01:27:02,097 --> 01:27:10,241
[SPEAKER_11]: militarized police force starts coming into communities and throwing people into vans and beating them up and shooting them.

698
01:27:11,282 --> 01:27:23,068
[SPEAKER_11]: And that maybe the law will not be... Our devotion to the law may not stop that from happening.

699
01:27:24,809 --> 01:27:25,910
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that's important.

700
01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:30,492
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we've entered a new phase of that conversation as a country and here in Medford.

701
01:27:32,853 --> 01:27:40,487
[SPEAKER_11]: And my hopes are, you know, I know our state delegation has filed some bills at the statehouse, and I think that's great, you know.

702
01:27:41,645 --> 01:27:42,986
[SPEAKER_11]: How long will it take to pass them?

703
01:27:43,366 --> 01:27:52,874
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that our, you know, the mayors in the region, including our mayor and Mayor Wu are talking about what does a response look like?

704
01:27:52,954 --> 01:27:56,456
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's an important conversation and I'm glad it's happening.

705
01:27:56,977 --> 01:28:05,083
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think the other thing is what Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Tseng were talking about, which is just what does leadership look like in this moment?

706
01:28:05,543 --> 01:28:07,665
[SPEAKER_11]: When do we just decide that it's enough?

707
01:28:08,065 --> 01:28:25,497
[SPEAKER_11]: and we're gonna say no, and that good people with good hearts, which I think are the vast majority of people in this city, the vast majority of people who work for this city, the vast majority of people in our police department, that when they see something that's wrong, they're just gonna say, we're not gonna let that happen.

708
01:28:27,358 --> 01:28:32,522
[SPEAKER_11]: And more and more and more, I fear that is where we are headed.

709
01:28:33,390 --> 01:28:41,138
[SPEAKER_11]: and we're seeing it in Minneapolis, and we're seeing it here, too, more and more.

710
01:28:41,718 --> 01:28:57,013
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's, I think, the new phase of this conversation that this resolution starts to have, which is, yes, what can we do within the bounds of the law and work our hardest to make sure that the law holds, but also what do we do when the law doesn't hold?

711
01:28:58,712 --> 01:29:05,596
[SPEAKER_11]: And the city can only do so much, and I think Minneapolis has shown this with incredible courage.

712
01:29:06,937 --> 01:29:12,761
[SPEAKER_11]: Just regular people coming together in mutual aid, in non-cooperation, in non-violence.

713
01:29:13,361 --> 01:29:24,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Something I read the other day was, you know, when they first sent the few thousand people here, you know, it was really easy for them to abduct people, but now we know how they do it, and we made it a lot harder for them to do it.

714
01:29:24,828 --> 01:29:25,909
[SPEAKER_11]: They can't do it as fast.

715
01:29:27,963 --> 01:29:29,524
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's just regular people.

716
01:29:31,504 --> 01:29:36,526
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the leaders within each and every one of us standing up and saying that we're not gonna let this happen.

717
01:29:39,107 --> 01:29:52,811
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, yes, we need to have this conversation about how can the city do more, but we also need to start having the conversations with our friends and our families and our neighbors, conversations that I know are happening here in Medford about what we're gonna do when the law doesn't hold.

718
01:29:54,063 --> 01:30:07,707
[SPEAKER_11]: when the state or the city can't protect us, and when we know that what someone with some ICE label on their shirt says is legal just isn't legal and absolutely isn't right.

719
01:30:09,368 --> 01:30:12,409
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's what I am hoping.

720
01:30:15,353 --> 01:30:32,244
[SPEAKER_11]: I so deeply hope that these things do not come here to this place that we love, but we can't act like that isn't going to happen because I think that's what everyone in Minneapolis said, and that's what everyone in Los Angeles said, and Chicago, and Washington, and New York, and Boston last spring.

721
01:30:32,304 --> 01:30:33,124
[SPEAKER_11]: We were one of the first.

722
01:30:33,384 --> 01:30:34,285
[SPEAKER_11]: They started it here.

723
01:30:35,225 --> 01:30:42,190
[SPEAKER_11]: We were an experiment, and they've been tweaking, and turning, and iterating, and figuring out just how to be

724
01:30:43,592 --> 01:30:48,795
[SPEAKER_11]: how awful they can be, and now we see it's come to fruition.

725
01:30:51,317 --> 01:31:04,506
[SPEAKER_11]: And we just can't, you know, one of the biggest and most dangerous things is the idea that it can't happen here, and we know that's not true.

726
01:31:05,471 --> 01:31:14,234
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm very thankful to my colleagues for putting this forward for the people who have been coming out in force to stand up for what's right.

727
01:31:15,774 --> 01:31:21,876
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm gonna just read it from our Poet Laureate earlier tonight.

728
01:31:23,217 --> 01:31:24,557
[SPEAKER_11]: Renee Goode was our neighbor.

729
01:31:24,957 --> 01:31:33,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Let our presence here tonight be a statement of peace, of resolve, of human dignity, and of neighborly love.

730
01:31:34,372 --> 01:31:38,033
[SPEAKER_11]: Be the bravery you want to see and that we need so clearly.

731
01:31:38,274 --> 01:31:38,614
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

732
01:31:49,418 --> 01:31:52,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there any other comments from the city council at this time?

733
01:31:56,805 --> 01:32:00,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Seeing none, we can open this up to public participation.

734
01:32:00,767 --> 01:32:06,350
[SPEAKER_11]: I know there were a number of people who wanted to speak on this matter, either in person or on Zoom.

735
01:32:06,470 --> 01:32:12,254
[SPEAKER_11]: I also have two items that I will read at the end of the public participation.

736
01:32:12,294 --> 01:32:15,595
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you'd like to speak on this resolution, you can.

737
01:32:16,883 --> 01:32:19,944
[SPEAKER_11]: make a line at the podium, or you can raise your hand on Zoom.

738
01:32:20,544 --> 01:32:26,725
[SPEAKER_11]: We will alternate between in-person and on Zoom, and each person will get three minutes.

739
01:32:29,165 --> 01:32:31,286
[SPEAKER_11]: We have someone at the podium, and we'll take you first.

740
01:32:31,306 --> 01:32:32,086
[SPEAKER_11]: And, Micah, that's you.

741
01:32:33,046 --> 01:32:34,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please.

742
01:32:34,206 --> 01:32:34,827
[SPEAKER_11]: You have three minutes.

743
01:32:40,108 --> 01:32:41,488
[SPEAKER_26]: Micah Shalom-Kesselman, 499 Main Street.

744
01:32:47,381 --> 01:33:01,534
[SPEAKER_26]: 130 years ago, when unaccountable, often-masked paramilitary secret policing forces were inflicting pogroms and programs of removal on Jewish communities across Eastern Europe, the Bund rallied around a simple cry.

745
01:33:02,454 --> 01:33:04,837
[SPEAKER_26]: Dort, wo wir leben, dort ist unser Land.

746
01:33:05,617 --> 01:33:07,879
[SPEAKER_26]: There, where we live, there is our country.

747
01:33:08,646 --> 01:33:16,829
[SPEAKER_26]: Despite tumultuous history and changes in mission, politics, size, everything else, this continued as a through line and became the concept of doykite.

748
01:33:17,650 --> 01:33:25,453
[SPEAKER_26]: The idea that where we are, no matter who we are or where it is, is our home and our neighbor's home and our community's home.

749
01:33:26,213 --> 01:33:35,957
[SPEAKER_26]: We now live in a time where unaccountable, masked thugs are violently inflicting a program of removal of people from where they have made a home for themselves.

750
01:33:36,769 --> 01:33:48,779
[SPEAKER_26]: a brutal and cruel expression of hate inflicted on our communities and our neighbors, our friends and our families, at the quivering behest of would-be autocrats, authoritarians, and yes, even fascists.

751
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:58,506
[SPEAKER_26]: We, each and every single one of us, have a duty to fight this craven and heinous violation with every single tool at our disposal.

752
01:33:59,267 --> 01:34:02,770
[SPEAKER_26]: This resolution tonight is one such tool, and I applaud it.

753
01:34:04,482 --> 01:34:06,804
[SPEAKER_26]: But there are more things that can be done.

754
01:34:07,685 --> 01:34:11,628
[SPEAKER_26]: And here are some ways in which we can all practice stoikite at different levels of here-ness.

755
01:34:12,388 --> 01:34:27,441
[SPEAKER_26]: The city can pass ordinances that may be challengeable, but in the meantime are going, and going forward if they survive challenge, lean towards resident safety and security first and facilitate enforcement against federal bad actors like ICE, a general LEO face mask ban.

756
01:34:28,026 --> 01:34:35,776
[SPEAKER_26]: and an ordinance restricting ice to limited specific spaces and or creating ice-free zones as suggested recently by Representative Connolly.

757
01:34:36,817 --> 01:34:40,182
[SPEAKER_26]: I also see no reason the city cannot consider other uncertain ordinances.

758
01:34:40,854 --> 01:35:10,220
[SPEAKER_26]: like a presumption of unlawfulness for ICE and arrest activities based on their clearly unconstitutional and illegal pattern of behavior here and across the country that shifts the immediate burden to show lawful compliance to ICE with further definition of what constitutes an articulable and reasonable fear that the subject is both present without authorization and likely, not at mere risk, to flee if not apprehended immediately, which is the only way ICE can arrest people when they don't have a warrant or orders.

759
01:35:10,885 --> 01:35:11,485
[SPEAKER_26]: very limited.

760
01:35:12,545 --> 01:35:21,948
[SPEAKER_26]: At the state, we can push for rapid voting on many of the bills that are sitting idle and are notoriously and completely unnecessarily slow state legislature.

761
01:35:22,488 --> 01:35:34,252
[SPEAKER_26]: We can demand passage of the numerous bills, many of which are very own state representative sponsored or authored in whole or in part, but seek to build resilience and resistance to federal overreach and lawlessness.

762
01:35:34,752 --> 01:35:36,412
[SPEAKER_26]: These bills include H-1588, Dignity Not Deportations Act, H-250,

763
01:35:40,207 --> 01:35:54,337
[SPEAKER_26]: slash S1681, the Safe Communities Act, H1954, Immigrant Legal Defense Act, SD3574, and that might be wrong, so double check it, an act ensuring law enforcement identification for public safety and more.

764
01:35:55,598 --> 01:35:58,981
[SPEAKER_26]: You can also push the state house to leverage the tax code.

765
01:35:59,061 --> 01:36:02,303
[SPEAKER_26]: Federal employees are still subject to state income tax after all.

766
01:36:02,763 --> 01:36:09,148
[SPEAKER_26]: And maybe we could even recoup some portion of that federal funds stolen from our state by this lawless administration.

767
01:36:10,420 --> 01:36:25,891
[SPEAKER_26]: Personally, in our neighborhoods and circles, on our streets and over our backyard fences, we can get to know each other, care about each other and learn each other's names, and be willing to stand between your neighbor and a federal thug trying to disappear them into a vicious and deadly system.

768
01:36:26,772 --> 01:36:32,376
[SPEAKER_26]: Sign up with organizations and mutual aid groups and be willing to have perhaps hard and scary conversations.

769
01:36:33,217 --> 01:36:35,679
[SPEAKER_26]: Ultimately, we can all patrol and protect our neighborhoods.

770
01:36:35,919 --> 01:36:39,442
[SPEAKER_26]: Come and grab a whistle from me and alert your neighbors to danger in their community.

771
01:36:39,722 --> 01:36:41,183
[SPEAKER_26]: I will be handing them out in the back.

772
01:36:43,284 --> 01:36:48,648
[SPEAKER_26]: And we live in a country where violent aggression may be countered and reciprocated with equal force.

773
01:36:49,309 --> 01:36:57,174
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll just say that if anyone wants to acquire their rightful license to a firearm and do not know where to go or how to go about it, you can reach out to me.

774
01:36:57,194 --> 01:36:58,235
[SPEAKER_26]: I can be

775
01:36:58,837 --> 01:37:00,378
[SPEAKER_26]: and have a private conversation.

776
01:37:00,398 --> 01:37:13,707
[SPEAKER_26]: I can direct you to local resources here in Medford, or I can direct you to regional resources that prioritize BIPOC, LGBTQ, and other at-risk and marginalized groups for licensure ahead of others.

777
01:37:14,187 --> 01:37:15,668
[SPEAKER_26]: We are communities.

778
01:37:16,008 --> 01:37:19,450
[SPEAKER_26]: Each and every one of us are the final backstop to protecting our communities.

779
01:37:20,291 --> 01:37:20,591
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

780
01:37:23,053 --> 01:37:23,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

781
01:37:24,845 --> 01:37:28,346
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll go to Steve on Zoom, and then we'll come back to the podium.

782
01:37:29,507 --> 01:37:32,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Steve, and you should be able to start video now.

783
01:37:32,227 --> 01:37:34,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Steve, name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

784
01:37:42,611 --> 01:37:43,611
[SPEAKER_24]: My name is Steve Schnapp.

785
01:37:43,671 --> 01:37:45,672
[SPEAKER_24]: I live at 36 Hillside Ave.

786
01:37:45,812 --> 01:37:46,692
[SPEAKER_24]: in Medford Square.

787
01:37:46,712 --> 01:37:49,233
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm in support of this resolution.

788
01:37:51,278 --> 01:38:00,149
[SPEAKER_24]: I recently was given a doorknob hanger by someone who works in Somerville with immigrants.

789
01:38:01,330 --> 01:38:09,181
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a sort of a know-your-rights card that is intended to be placed on the inside of someone's outer door.

790
01:38:10,652 --> 01:38:20,501
[SPEAKER_24]: as basic know your rights information, but it also contains, under a section called important phone numbers, this sentence.

791
01:38:21,142 --> 01:38:22,623
[SPEAKER_24]: This is from Somerville.

792
01:38:23,624 --> 01:38:27,908
[SPEAKER_24]: Call 911 if ICE comes to your door.

793
01:38:28,869 --> 01:38:33,633
[SPEAKER_24]: Somerville police will verify if they have a real warrant.

794
01:38:36,064 --> 01:38:52,944
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm hoping that this council would support the city administration in doing something similar and the Medford Police Department acting in the interest of the safety and well-being of Medford residents.

795
01:38:54,047 --> 01:39:02,731
[SPEAKER_24]: by verifying the legality of these ICE raids.

796
01:39:03,852 --> 01:39:06,833
[SPEAKER_24]: If Somerville is doing it, there's no reason why Medford can't.

797
01:39:07,714 --> 01:39:08,454
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

798
01:39:12,916 --> 01:39:13,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Steve.

799
01:39:15,397 --> 01:39:18,059
[SPEAKER_11]: We will go to the podium.

800
01:39:18,559 --> 01:39:20,700
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

801
01:39:24,247 --> 01:39:24,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

802
01:39:26,008 --> 01:39:26,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

803
01:39:26,548 --> 01:39:26,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

804
01:39:27,548 --> 01:39:28,549
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Nihit Trivedi.

805
01:39:28,589 --> 01:39:30,889
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually a resident of Cambridge.

806
01:39:32,150 --> 01:39:35,311
[SPEAKER_10]: But I appreciate you having me here today.

807
01:39:35,691 --> 01:39:40,853
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to say, first, inspired by what you all are doing here.

808
01:39:41,113 --> 01:39:43,694
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think this is an important resolution.

809
01:39:44,575 --> 01:39:49,476
[SPEAKER_10]: And I appreciate the work that you're doing to put it forward.

810
01:39:52,037 --> 01:39:53,258
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just inspired by,

811
01:39:55,128 --> 01:40:16,253
[SPEAKER_10]: what you all are doing to just share one tidbit, I guess, which is I had an experience where a good friend of mine was recently taken by ICE and deported.

812
01:40:18,482 --> 01:40:29,811
[SPEAKER_10]: He described it, when I finally was able to speak to him four months later, when he arrived back in Brazil, was that it was like being in a horror movie, his only words that he described.

813
01:40:29,831 --> 01:40:36,296
[SPEAKER_10]: And he said he was with his mother, and he would not talk about it in front of her and ask that we talk about it later.

814
01:40:37,377 --> 01:40:40,219
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's obviously a lot that

815
01:40:42,708 --> 01:40:49,893
[SPEAKER_10]: you've all spoken about here about what folks can do, what the city can do, and what folks can do as these agents are descending on our communities in the state.

816
01:40:51,594 --> 01:40:56,357
[SPEAKER_10]: But I just also have been asking myself, what are the things that I can do in the day-to-day?

817
01:40:56,597 --> 01:40:59,879
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think all of you are speaking about some of your experiences and folks here, too.

818
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:11,527
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just want to mention one organization that I've recently started volunteering with called Bijan, which is the Boston Immigrant Justice Accompaniment Network.

819
01:41:12,167 --> 01:41:13,608
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm just mentioning it for two reasons.

820
01:41:13,768 --> 01:41:37,902
[SPEAKER_10]: One is for folks who are detained for their families, the organization, and I'm a volunteer there, can provide accompaniment to hearings, support with finding a lawyer, bond, as well as resources to the families to pay for rent and other things in the immediate aftermath of a family member being detained.

821
01:41:40,427 --> 01:41:44,954
[SPEAKER_10]: And two, the organization is, you know, the.

822
01:41:46,312 --> 01:41:47,292
[SPEAKER_10]: is a network of volunteers.

823
01:41:47,652 --> 01:41:51,953
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I understand there are people publicly who are listening.

824
01:41:51,993 --> 01:41:59,675
[SPEAKER_10]: So if folks are interested, I just encourage them to Google Bijan, Massachusetts and check it out.

825
01:41:59,715 --> 01:42:05,937
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also a phone number there that people can call if their family members or others have been detained.

826
01:42:06,997 --> 01:42:08,777
[SPEAKER_10]: There are volunteers who speak different languages.

827
01:42:09,377 --> 01:42:11,878
[SPEAKER_10]: I work with those who speak Portuguese, but there are others as well.

828
01:42:12,338 --> 01:42:14,939
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to share that because I always ask myself,

829
01:42:16,088 --> 01:42:16,629
[SPEAKER_10]: What can I do?

830
01:42:17,049 --> 01:42:21,454
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's one thing that I just want to share with the community and is also, once again, it's a resource.

831
01:42:22,315 --> 01:42:31,425
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just appreciate the important work you all are all doing in this difficult time.

832
01:42:31,706 --> 01:42:32,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

833
01:42:32,486 --> 01:42:33,488
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry about that noise.

834
01:42:40,850 --> 01:42:42,371
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you so much for bringing up Bijan.

835
01:42:42,411 --> 01:42:48,553
[SPEAKER_11]: They're a really, really important organization that I've been lucky to help support myself.

836
01:42:48,693 --> 01:42:49,913
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for bringing that up.

837
01:42:49,973 --> 01:42:54,395
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's something that folks should focus on.

838
01:42:56,056 --> 01:42:57,756
[SPEAKER_11]: We will go back to Zoom.

839
01:42:57,796 --> 01:42:58,937
[SPEAKER_11]: We have Jason on Zoom.

840
01:42:58,957 --> 01:43:01,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Jason, name and address for the record, please.

841
01:43:01,538 --> 01:43:02,558
[SPEAKER_11]: And you'll have three minutes.

842
01:43:06,039 --> 01:43:06,440
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

843
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:07,820
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Jason Rabin.

844
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:09,261
[SPEAKER_13]: I live at 592 Main Street.

845
01:43:11,106 --> 01:43:13,188
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate the chance to talk.

846
01:43:13,948 --> 01:43:18,813
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank you all for passing this resolution and for all the words you guys spoke today.

847
01:43:18,833 --> 01:43:20,154
[SPEAKER_13]: I really appreciate it.

848
01:43:21,575 --> 01:43:27,020
[SPEAKER_13]: As well as just being a concerned resident and neighbor, I work for a refugee resettlement agency.

849
01:43:28,182 --> 01:43:33,567
[SPEAKER_13]: And I wanted to add to the conversation, the folks that I work with are here on

850
01:43:34,462 --> 01:43:37,043
[SPEAKER_13]: humanitarian immigration statuses.

851
01:43:38,184 --> 01:43:45,448
[SPEAKER_13]: I know we have at least a couple of hundred clients in Medford and there are many, many more Medford residences who are here under humanitarian protections.

852
01:43:46,209 --> 01:43:52,232
[SPEAKER_13]: And that means that the federal government promised them safety and protection here for a number of reasons.

853
01:43:54,153 --> 01:43:55,854
[SPEAKER_13]: In some cases, they helped the U.S.

854
01:43:55,894 --> 01:43:56,674
[SPEAKER_13]: government and the U.S.

855
01:43:56,714 --> 01:43:57,575
[SPEAKER_13]: military abroad.

856
01:43:58,269 --> 01:44:04,073
[SPEAKER_13]: In some cases, they come from countries that were destabilized by foreign policy, including ours.

857
01:44:05,254 --> 01:44:10,898
[SPEAKER_13]: And in many cases, there's been violence or natural disasters that have made their homes unsafe to live.

858
01:44:10,978 --> 01:44:14,140
[SPEAKER_13]: And the United States has promised them safety and protection here.

859
01:44:15,321 --> 01:44:27,270
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've seen something really, really unprecedented recently, which is a lot of these humanitarian statuses being restricted, revoked, or simply not honored or flouted when

860
01:44:28,422 --> 01:44:36,385
[SPEAKER_13]: The federal government has chosen a population that they didn't want to be here anymore, you know, who they wanted to inflict collective punishment on.

861
01:44:37,765 --> 01:44:39,626
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a really, really terrifying development.

862
01:44:39,946 --> 01:44:50,549
[SPEAKER_13]: I can tell you from working with refugees and other folks with humanitarian statuses that, you know, they are truly amongst the most patriotic Americans you'll meet.

863
01:44:50,589 --> 01:44:51,770
[SPEAKER_13]: They love this country.

864
01:44:51,830 --> 01:44:52,810
[SPEAKER_13]: They'll do anything for it.

865
01:44:53,455 --> 01:44:57,079
[SPEAKER_13]: proud to be able to work here, raise their families here, and start new beginnings here.

866
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:12,476
[SPEAKER_13]: And in Minneapolis, we're seeing ICE with mandates to identify people of certain nationalities regardless of their status, sometimes because of their humanitarian protectives that, you know, they were promised by their government.

867
01:45:13,391 --> 01:45:17,674
[SPEAKER_13]: And they have quotas and are promised bonuses if they round them up, even if they're later released.

868
01:45:18,675 --> 01:45:24,919
[SPEAKER_13]: And if these, a lot of these folks, if they end up being deported, they will face death.

869
01:45:25,380 --> 01:45:29,222
[SPEAKER_13]: They will face horrible, unimaginable retaliation against them and their families.

870
01:45:31,964 --> 01:45:41,791
[SPEAKER_13]: I think a lot of these folks also are being threatened with being, having their statuses up for re-adjudication unfairly, which re-traumatizes people who have undergone

871
01:45:42,287 --> 01:45:45,908
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, recovered from incredible hardships to contribute to this country.

872
01:45:46,968 --> 01:45:48,369
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, I could go on and on about this.

873
01:45:48,389 --> 01:45:59,452
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, but I think the point I really wanted to make was these are people that the federal government has broken faith with broken contracts with that thought that they had legal protection that no longer do.

874
01:45:59,952 --> 01:46:06,674
[SPEAKER_13]: We've seen that that's now the case for American citizens, including people who were born here and are bearing witness and are protesting.

875
01:46:07,955 --> 01:46:08,035
[SPEAKER_13]: Um,

876
01:46:09,334 --> 01:46:14,416
[SPEAKER_13]: I had more to say, but I'll leave it there and just, I think we need to be, you can finish it out.

877
01:46:15,877 --> 01:46:25,781
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to say that I've watched this government take an all of government, very, very creative, all of government approach to persecuting immigrants that they didn't want to be here.

878
01:46:25,821 --> 01:46:27,362
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think on the other side,

879
01:46:28,345 --> 01:46:34,627
[SPEAKER_13]: We need the same kind of very creative all of government approach to protecting people that we have promised safety to.

880
01:46:35,727 --> 01:46:55,132
[SPEAKER_13]: And that includes looking at not just the things that we've already talked about, but things like people being surveilled, things like information sharing, making sure that people understand the protections that they have, making sure that we do not share information that we don't have to share with the federal government if they're targeting people unfairly.

881
01:46:55,842 --> 01:47:01,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Things like Steve mentioned with asking the police to verify warrants.

882
01:47:02,295 --> 01:47:07,686
[SPEAKER_13]: I just also wanted to mention really quickly that people, there are many, many Haitians living in Medford.

883
01:47:08,093 --> 01:47:17,036
[SPEAKER_13]: their temporary protected status is going to be prematurely terminated at the beginning of February if the government does not act to protect them.

884
01:47:17,536 --> 01:47:19,477
[SPEAKER_13]: In Boston, there was a field hearing about this.

885
01:47:19,557 --> 01:47:31,322
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be wonderful if the city council could pass a resolution opposing the premature termination of TPS in support of the efforts that are happening in Boston.

886
01:47:31,562 --> 01:47:31,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

887
01:47:34,283 --> 01:47:34,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Jason.

888
01:47:41,272 --> 01:47:43,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in person at this time?

889
01:47:52,296 --> 01:47:52,616
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

890
01:47:52,996 --> 01:47:53,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address record, please.

891
01:47:54,116 --> 01:47:55,857
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Claire Sheridan.

892
01:47:55,917 --> 01:47:58,958
[SPEAKER_08]: I live at 190 High Street in Medford.

893
01:48:02,419 --> 01:48:05,900
[SPEAKER_08]: My Haitian neighbors across the hall from me disappeared.

894
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:07,701
[SPEAKER_08]: They were here legally.

895
01:48:09,291 --> 01:48:13,313
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know whether they self-deported or not, but they're gone.

896
01:48:17,135 --> 01:48:21,797
[SPEAKER_08]: My nephew lives in Minneapolis where Ms.

897
01:48:21,837 --> 01:48:24,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Goode was murdered.

898
01:48:26,239 --> 01:48:27,119
[SPEAKER_08]: They're frightened.

899
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:30,721
[SPEAKER_08]: The schools are closed.

900
01:48:30,981 --> 01:48:32,442
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a school teacher.

901
01:48:32,522 --> 01:48:34,243
[SPEAKER_08]: They're teaching on Zoom now.

902
01:48:37,067 --> 01:48:45,334
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm an old white lady, so I don't have anything technically to be frightened of, but I am frightened.

903
01:48:49,238 --> 01:48:59,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Mayor, I would like you to be a leader and show some leadership and lead us out of this nightmare.

904
01:49:01,157 --> 01:49:08,802
[SPEAKER_08]: I know the police are in an awkward position, but I want you to help them to do the right thing.

905
01:49:11,043 --> 01:49:11,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

906
01:49:14,685 --> 01:49:15,146
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

907
01:49:15,166 --> 01:49:24,051
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to go to Zoom.

908
01:49:24,211 --> 01:49:25,312
[SPEAKER_11]: We have Prabita.

909
01:49:25,852 --> 01:49:28,234
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

910
01:49:33,876 --> 01:49:34,856
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello.

911
01:49:35,296 --> 01:49:37,857
[SPEAKER_21]: I am curious if I have to turn on the camera.

912
01:49:39,758 --> 01:49:43,179
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to if you don't want to.

913
01:49:43,199 --> 01:49:44,259
[SPEAKER_21]: Sounds good.

914
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:45,120
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you so much.

915
01:49:45,340 --> 01:49:45,640
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks.

916
01:49:45,940 --> 01:49:47,861
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks for the opportunity to talk.

917
01:49:47,941 --> 01:49:49,321
[SPEAKER_21]: I live in West Medford.

918
01:49:50,842 --> 01:49:55,863
[SPEAKER_21]: I am very grateful for this proposal from the city council.

919
01:49:56,824 --> 01:49:58,684
[SPEAKER_21]: Definitely very supportive of this.

920
01:49:59,184 --> 01:50:02,325
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been a resident in Medford from 2019.

921
01:50:04,287 --> 01:50:09,252
[SPEAKER_21]: And we have a lot of friends and community support here.

922
01:50:09,713 --> 01:50:13,277
[SPEAKER_21]: We love living here, love the neighborhood, love the community.

923
01:50:15,887 --> 01:50:17,168
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, we've definitely enjoyed.

924
01:50:17,188 --> 01:50:19,009
[SPEAKER_21]: We lived in Cambridge before.

925
01:50:20,029 --> 01:50:25,252
[SPEAKER_21]: However, we have faced several racist encounters before.

926
01:50:26,293 --> 01:50:33,596
[SPEAKER_21]: But sadly, those encounters seem like nothing compared to what we are feeling now.

927
01:50:35,237 --> 01:50:42,241
[SPEAKER_21]: When all of the ICE raids began, my husband and I were, you know, we weren't that shaken up.

928
01:50:42,581 --> 01:50:43,782
[SPEAKER_21]: We were definitely very

929
01:50:44,342 --> 01:50:58,894
[SPEAKER_21]: empathetic and sad for the situation and the plight of our other, you know, fellow people all over America, but we thought personally we were okay because we are legal, but given

930
01:51:00,315 --> 01:51:03,679
[SPEAKER_21]: how things are shaping around us.

931
01:51:03,860 --> 01:51:17,736
[SPEAKER_21]: We are not feeling very safe or settled right now, especially given some increased activity in our neighboring town Burlington to be specific where

932
01:51:18,237 --> 01:51:19,518
[SPEAKER_21]: we frequently visit.

933
01:51:19,618 --> 01:51:29,321
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know, just sharing some of our personal kind of considerations that we are going through should we both walk together.

934
01:51:29,341 --> 01:51:38,665
[SPEAKER_21]: If my husband, who's famously been targeted by, been the target of several racist incidents, I was like, if he goes

935
01:51:39,425 --> 01:51:41,306
[SPEAKER_21]: away by himself, is he going to come back?

936
01:51:41,366 --> 01:51:44,528
[SPEAKER_21]: So those types of fears are something that we're dealing with right now.

937
01:51:44,668 --> 01:51:56,835
[SPEAKER_21]: And we would really hope and appreciate that the mayor, like everyone else more qualified than I have said before to lead us in the right direction.

938
01:51:57,215 --> 01:51:57,535
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

939
01:51:59,837 --> 01:52:00,157
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

940
01:52:04,981 --> 01:52:06,741
[SPEAKER_11]: We will go back to the podium.

941
01:52:07,142 --> 01:52:09,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

942
01:52:13,543 --> 01:52:15,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Patrick Clerkin, 14 Bennett Place.

943
01:52:16,844 --> 01:52:29,747
[SPEAKER_04]: As Councilor Callahan was mentioning before, sometimes within law enforcement, there is an anarchy that pervades, ironically, kind of a lawlessness within law and order, supposedly.

944
01:52:31,745 --> 01:52:42,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, what we're dealing with is, on the one hand, the sense that lawlessness pervades within law enforcement, and on the other hand, the sense that lawlessness pervades in our immigration system.

945
01:52:43,852 --> 01:52:45,593
[SPEAKER_04]: And those two things feed off of each other.

946
01:52:46,974 --> 01:52:48,315
[SPEAKER_04]: We're seeing examples of both.

947
01:52:49,495 --> 01:52:51,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of people have been impacted by both.

948
01:52:52,257 --> 01:53:01,202
[SPEAKER_04]: And I understand and don't blame people for the degree of forcefulness that they think is necessary to confront the other side.

949
01:53:02,518 --> 01:53:28,146
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I also think it's important that we maintain in Medford some forums, perhaps outside of this city council, this biweekly city council meeting, and outside of something that Medford residents might set up themselves, a forum that would allow those two sides of the issue to engage with each other in a way that they might not currently be doing.

950
01:53:28,806 --> 01:53:30,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I think particularly at a time where

951
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:39,483
[SPEAKER_04]: our social media algorithms pump more and more of what we fear and what we find emotionally resonant at us.

952
01:53:40,663 --> 01:53:53,568
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think if some of those forums were properly advertised, that would be an additional help to this situation.

953
01:53:55,069 --> 01:53:58,330
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll also add that

954
01:54:00,743 --> 01:54:08,748
[SPEAKER_04]: To the degree to which we don't do that, I think it will only accelerate the worst outcomes and will only accelerate the mutual fear.

955
01:54:09,469 --> 01:54:17,234
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think if we're not talking about the pros and cons of both sides, and there are pros and cons of both sides, I'm not talking about in the extreme cases.

956
01:54:18,611 --> 01:54:24,815
[SPEAKER_04]: then we become propagandists and we become complicit in that fear economy.

957
01:54:25,415 --> 01:54:38,123
[SPEAKER_04]: And as Councilor Leming mentioned before, in reference to fear itself, I want to remind people that even within that administration of the very man that said that, there was

958
01:54:39,536 --> 01:54:46,340
[SPEAKER_04]: mass deportations of Japanese, or I should say, encampments of Japanese.

959
01:54:46,861 --> 01:55:05,693
[SPEAKER_04]: There was the adoption of aspects of dictatorships into our democracy, and there was deals made with the Deep South senators who that administration needed the approval of for the programs that prolonged Jim Crow itself.

960
01:55:09,050 --> 01:55:23,738
[SPEAKER_04]: All throughout history, there are difficult situations and complex situations, and I think we should fight the good fight, but keep in mind that there are other sides to the story, and we have to engage with those.

961
01:55:24,278 --> 01:55:24,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

962
01:55:25,839 --> 01:55:26,219
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

963
01:55:31,222 --> 01:55:33,102
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll go to Muneer Jimenez.

964
01:55:33,403 --> 01:55:35,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

965
01:55:42,427 --> 01:55:44,568
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Munir Germanus.

966
01:55:46,248 --> 01:55:48,249
[SPEAKER_25]: I live at 3 Summit Road in Medford.

967
01:55:49,709 --> 01:55:54,390
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm here to add my wholehearted support for this resolution.

968
01:55:55,790 --> 01:56:07,613
[SPEAKER_25]: We've heard that our own Medford Police Department are powerless to stop these attacks and that ICE does not let them know when they're coming to arrest or kidnap someone in Medford.

969
01:56:08,768 --> 01:56:33,004
[SPEAKER_25]: But what I would like to add is I would like to ask the Medford Police Department to accept 911 calls when such incidents are happening and to rapidly respond by sending an officer to at least witness what is happening and show that the Medford Police Department is in support of our community.

970
01:56:33,685 --> 01:56:34,405
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you very much.

971
01:56:37,487 --> 01:56:37,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

972
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:45,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Seeing no one here at the podium right now, we'll stay on Zoom.

973
01:56:45,863 --> 01:56:46,804
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll go to Megan.

974
01:56:47,684 --> 01:56:50,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Megan, name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

975
01:56:54,068 --> 01:56:54,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, can you hear me?

976
01:56:55,869 --> 01:56:56,069
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

977
01:56:56,790 --> 01:56:57,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

978
01:56:57,430 --> 01:56:58,471
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Megan Searle.

979
01:56:58,511 --> 01:57:00,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I live at 100 Station Landing.

980
01:57:01,238 --> 01:57:08,701
[SPEAKER_03]: First, I'm grateful to the city council for acknowledging the urgent need to devise a plan for addressing an ice surge in Medford.

981
01:57:09,341 --> 01:57:12,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of us already know that we are at imminent risk.

982
01:57:12,762 --> 01:57:15,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Mayor Michelle Wu has already been planning for a surge in Boston.

983
01:57:16,503 --> 01:57:23,525
[SPEAKER_03]: DHS is directing the kind of state-sponsored violence in Minnesota to other areas of the country, including Lewiston, Maine.

984
01:57:24,146 --> 01:57:30,228
[SPEAKER_03]: And witnesses saw a raft of new ice vehicles delivered to the Boston field office in Burlington a few weeks ago.

985
01:57:31,248 --> 01:57:35,852
[SPEAKER_03]: What I wanna focus on though is the aspect of this resolution that is about our constitutional rights.

986
01:57:36,672 --> 01:57:44,659
[SPEAKER_03]: The resolution demonstrates the council's insight into the current state of the country and what it means for our community going forward.

987
01:57:45,559 --> 01:57:57,168
[SPEAKER_03]: In reaffirming our constitutional rights to protest peacefully and to observe and document the activity of federal agents, it is saying that in no uncertain terms that Medford residents have these rights.

988
01:57:58,049 --> 01:58:10,877
[SPEAKER_03]: This might not feel critical now, just as we were protesting peacefully in front of City Hall earlier, and just recently, Medford residents were called to verify ICE activity, freely observing and documenting agents as they carried out their work.

989
01:58:11,718 --> 01:58:13,579
[SPEAKER_03]: So why do we need this part of the resolution?

990
01:58:14,300 --> 01:58:23,786
[SPEAKER_03]: We need it because we are now living under competitive authoritarianism, where there is a facade of democracy, but underneath, democratic institutions are collapsing.

991
01:58:24,546 --> 01:58:35,659
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are moving at breakneck speed toward authoritarian consolidation, a process that would solidify the permanent power of the Trump administration, turning us into an autocracy or dictatorship.

992
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:39,784
[SPEAKER_03]: We will join the ranks of Russia, China, North Korea, and Saudi Arabia.

993
01:58:40,645 --> 01:58:43,387
[SPEAKER_03]: The best case scenario would be that we might be more like Hungary.

994
01:58:43,767 --> 01:58:45,768
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is life like in Hungary?

995
01:58:45,788 --> 01:58:48,069
[SPEAKER_03]: The government's message is everywhere.

996
01:58:48,569 --> 01:58:51,571
[SPEAKER_03]: It spends billions on propaganda instead of schools and hospitals.

997
01:58:52,151 --> 01:58:56,014
[SPEAKER_03]: The Justice Department can investigate anyone who says the wrong thing.

998
01:58:57,027 --> 01:59:01,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Women are pressured to stay home and raise large families, and there is no same-sex marriage, and I could go on.

999
01:59:03,110 --> 01:59:09,934
[SPEAKER_03]: If what I'm describing feels like an unlikely possibility, know that experts in authoritarianism say that this is where we are in no uncertain terms.

1000
01:59:10,755 --> 01:59:19,560
[SPEAKER_03]: And with regard to believing or not believing this is the case, well, if you're in the path of a bullet train, it doesn't really matter whether you believe it's true or not.

1001
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:20,921
[SPEAKER_03]: It will run you over either way.

1002
01:59:22,161 --> 01:59:27,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Our country has a short window to turn us around, something that experts in authoritarianism call a democratic U-turn.

1003
01:59:28,529 --> 01:59:41,524
[SPEAKER_03]: But if the upcoming midterms are hijacked such that we cannot prove and enforce our democratic wins, our chance of recovering our democracy plunges, and the length of time it will take us to get it back, if we can at all, multiplies.

1004
01:59:42,837 --> 01:59:55,102
[SPEAKER_03]: So when City Council affirms our constitutional right to protest and to document the actions of federal agents, they are empowering us to do what we need to do to slow down and hopefully stop authoritarian consolidation.

1005
01:59:56,143 --> 02:00:03,146
[SPEAKER_03]: It has become evident that we, the people, are the ones who have to turn this country around, and it's crucial that these rights are protected.

1006
02:00:03,846 --> 02:00:12,868
[SPEAKER_03]: While it's unusual for the activity of the Medford City Council to have implications for the future of this country, and I would even say the future of the world, this is the case now.

1007
02:00:13,488 --> 02:00:19,450
[SPEAKER_03]: The hope for the future of the American democratic experiment rests on communities like Medford and the actions of their leaders.

1008
02:00:20,030 --> 02:00:28,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the country is made up of hundreds and thousands of Medfords, it is up to us, community by community, to ensure the survival of our democracy.

1009
02:00:28,952 --> 02:00:29,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1010
02:00:33,132 --> 02:00:33,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1011
02:00:33,672 --> 02:00:42,597
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1012
02:00:42,958 --> 02:00:44,799
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, we have someone in person.

1013
02:00:45,719 --> 02:00:47,040
[SPEAKER_11]: We will go back to the podium.

1014
02:00:48,741 --> 02:00:51,683
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

1015
02:00:52,595 --> 02:00:58,459
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Asya Ricarte and I live in South Medford, 111 Princeton Street.

1016
02:00:58,479 --> 02:01:10,427
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to say I'm in full support of this resolution because I feel that as young people in our community, we need to feel safe.

1017
02:01:10,707 --> 02:01:13,149
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of all, our families are doing what they can.

1018
02:01:15,042 --> 02:01:25,327
[SPEAKER_12]: But we need the support of the local government, of the Medford police, and the people who are in power, the people who are supposed to be our leaders to look up to.

1019
02:01:27,788 --> 02:01:36,813
[SPEAKER_12]: This resolution may be the start of that change, the thing that makes Medford stand apart from the other communities who are staying silent.

1020
02:01:39,995 --> 02:01:43,656
[SPEAKER_12]: In support of this resolution, I think

1021
02:01:46,712 --> 02:02:05,559
[SPEAKER_12]: recognizing the murder of Mr. Nay Good is a good first step, but we also need to recognize the people in our own community that are being taken, the people in other communities, the regular, ordinary people in Minneapolis, and across the entire country.

1022
02:02:07,980 --> 02:02:13,342
[SPEAKER_12]: So, as a young person of the community, I am looking out to the leaders

1023
02:02:14,282 --> 02:02:25,106
[SPEAKER_12]: to speak up, to stand up, to say something, to vote, vote with all our voices and ensure that democracy in Medford stays the way that it is.

1024
02:02:28,867 --> 02:02:29,308
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1025
02:02:30,568 --> 02:02:31,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much.

1026
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:38,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1027
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:41,541
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to go to Zoom.

1028
02:02:41,561 --> 02:02:44,802
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to go to Mr. Castagnetti on Zoom.

1029
02:02:44,842 --> 02:02:46,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please.

1030
02:02:53,465 --> 02:02:55,366
[SPEAKER_11]: Andy, I've requested to unmute you.

1031
02:02:59,067 --> 02:02:59,387
[SPEAKER_27]: Right.

1032
02:03:01,048 --> 02:03:03,849
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Mr. Beers, for your attention.

1033
02:03:04,949 --> 02:03:07,510
[SPEAKER_27]: Can you put my Zoom on camera?

1034
02:03:10,922 --> 02:03:13,604
[SPEAKER_11]: I can ask to start your video, but you have to press the button.

1035
02:03:14,964 --> 02:03:16,645
[SPEAKER_27]: There we go.

1036
02:03:16,806 --> 02:03:17,766
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, sir.

1037
02:03:21,949 --> 02:03:25,591
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, I agree with you 99% for sure.

1038
02:03:26,631 --> 02:03:29,413
[SPEAKER_27]: I also condemn the killing of Ms.

1039
02:03:29,773 --> 02:03:29,993
[SPEAKER_27]: Good.

1040
02:03:30,434 --> 02:03:31,594
[SPEAKER_27]: It's terrible.

1041
02:03:33,375 --> 02:03:39,139
[SPEAKER_27]: Even if it was in self-defense,

1042
02:03:41,314 --> 02:03:48,419
[SPEAKER_27]: But in hindsight, if she got out of her truck on the cop order, she'd still be alive today.

1043
02:03:50,701 --> 02:03:54,144
[SPEAKER_27]: Very, very sad thing, especially for her three kids.

1044
02:03:54,984 --> 02:03:57,626
[SPEAKER_27]: Unnecessary death, totally unavoidable.

1045
02:03:59,107 --> 02:04:04,031
[SPEAKER_27]: By the way, nobody prayed tonight.

1046
02:04:05,452 --> 02:04:09,295
[SPEAKER_27]: I'd like to say my prayer for her three kids, her,

1047
02:04:10,335 --> 02:04:13,738
[SPEAKER_27]: and her father-in-law, who will probably have three children.

1048
02:04:14,979 --> 02:04:31,953
[SPEAKER_27]: Almighty God, creator of heaven and earth, all sentient beings and more, please get me and all of us to be, do the best that we can, now, always, forever and ever, in our quest for eternal, blissful peace.

1049
02:04:32,773 --> 02:04:33,194
[SPEAKER_27]: Amen.

1050
02:04:33,694 --> 02:04:35,075
[SPEAKER_27]: God bless us all.

1051
02:04:35,776 --> 02:04:36,156
[SPEAKER_27]: Good night.

1052
02:04:41,076 --> 02:04:41,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1053
02:04:41,596 --> 02:04:48,503
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to stay on Zoom.

1054
02:04:49,564 --> 02:04:55,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless there's someone who hasn't spoken already who wants to speak in person, we'll go to Ellery Klein.

1055
02:04:55,349 --> 02:04:58,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Ellery, name and address for the record, please.

1056
02:04:58,792 --> 02:04:59,473
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll have three minutes.

1057
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:01,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

1058
02:05:01,201 --> 02:05:02,662
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Ellery Klein.

1059
02:05:03,583 --> 02:05:05,965
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm at 37 Fells Avenue in Medford.

1060
02:05:07,366 --> 02:05:09,067
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in support of this resolution.

1061
02:05:09,948 --> 02:05:25,641
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd also like to add just, I don't know if anything can be added to address this situation, but you know, the same day that Renee Good was murdered by ICE in Minnesota, they also went to Roosevelt High School.

1062
02:05:26,715 --> 02:05:55,818
[SPEAKER_01]: in Minnesota and at the dismissal time and ended up either pepper spraying or tear gassing students, it's unconfirmed which, pepper gunning students, causing mayhem, traumatizing students, with the result that, you know, school has been closed in Minnesota for days following that incident and the murderer

1063
02:05:57,222 --> 02:06:24,651
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to point out, especially to those out there that are trying to tell us that we're overreacting, that schools in Minnesota, in Minneapolis, were closed last week for days because the administration of the school was worried that the federal government was going to shoot, injure, or abduct their students.

1064
02:06:27,347 --> 02:06:29,269
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an unacceptable situation.

1065
02:06:29,589 --> 02:06:36,737
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that we here in the city of Medford in the state of Massachusetts should be thinking proactively.

1066
02:06:36,757 --> 02:06:45,686
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that our school administration is doing a lot to support our families, unfortunately, many of whom have already left or are hiding.

1067
02:06:47,573 --> 02:06:54,096
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, post COVID, our students are still suffering the effects of the pandemic.

1068
02:06:54,756 --> 02:07:01,819
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're dealing with a situation where the federal government is really ruining children's lives, traumatizing children.

1069
02:07:02,539 --> 02:07:10,783
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just here tonight to speak out for the children and the students of Medford as a music teacher and a parent and a citizen.

1070
02:07:11,543 --> 02:07:19,148
[SPEAKER_01]: who has watched our children bear the brunt of our government's bad decision making and cruelty for over a decade now.

1071
02:07:21,450 --> 02:07:32,698
[SPEAKER_01]: The police maybe do not have the authority to interfere with federal acts, but when these acts are illegal,

1072
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:38,661
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should make sure that the Medford police are not going to cooperate with ICE.

1073
02:07:39,041 --> 02:07:41,402
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not going to do crowd control for ICE.

1074
02:07:42,062 --> 02:07:45,663
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not going to hold people down for ICE.

1075
02:07:46,023 --> 02:07:49,103
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would like to make sure that this sort of thing is confirmed with them.

1076
02:07:49,123 --> 02:07:56,685
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to see, I echo what other people say, that I would like to see the Medford police be a voice of reason.

1077
02:07:58,105 --> 02:08:05,989
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen again and again on videos that ICE tend to respond to men who are out there calling them out.

1078
02:08:06,609 --> 02:08:13,452
[SPEAKER_01]: I think our police have a valuable role as witnesses, as voices of calm, and also as checks.

1079
02:08:14,112 --> 02:08:24,277
[SPEAKER_01]: If a police officer is doing something illegal in the course of duty, I'm not sure what the role of his fellow officer is and how he can react in that moment, but

1080
02:08:25,607 --> 02:08:29,688
[SPEAKER_01]: just letting ICE know that the police here in Medford will be watching.

1081
02:08:30,208 --> 02:08:31,309
[SPEAKER_01]: They will be recording.

1082
02:08:31,929 --> 02:08:35,930
[SPEAKER_01]: They will be testifying against them in a court of law.

1083
02:08:36,790 --> 02:08:38,691
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's important to send that message.

1084
02:08:39,031 --> 02:08:43,652
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do way more than say we can't do anything.

1085
02:08:44,452 --> 02:08:46,933
[SPEAKER_01]: We can let them know that we are watching them.

1086
02:08:47,525 --> 02:09:05,975
[SPEAKER_01]: and that we care for our citizens, we care for our immigrant neighbors, we care for all our neighbors, and that we especially care for our children and our students who have been asked to endure learning loss and trauma again and again and again, and it is unacceptable.

1087
02:09:06,155 --> 02:09:14,099
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would just, I appreciate the statement and I would love something about the school system or our students to be added to this resolution.

1088
02:09:14,459 --> 02:09:15,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

1089
02:09:16,675 --> 02:09:17,175
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1090
02:09:23,701 --> 02:09:25,542
[SPEAKER_11]: We will stay on Zoom.

1091
02:09:27,344 --> 02:09:29,765
[SPEAKER_11]: Simon, I'll unmute you.

1092
02:09:29,825 --> 02:09:31,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please.

1093
02:09:31,307 --> 02:09:32,388
[SPEAKER_11]: And you have three minutes.

1094
02:09:34,209 --> 02:09:37,051
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, thank you, Simon Elsendor, 44 Tainter Street.

1095
02:09:39,454 --> 02:09:52,586
[SPEAKER_07]: I just sort of actually similar to what was just said, I wanted to uplift the work of students at Somerville High School and Cambridge Regional Latin School who today walked out in support of the general ICE protests.

1096
02:09:53,326 --> 02:09:59,011
[SPEAKER_07]: And I particularly wanted to note something that was mentioned, I was just at the rally down here in Boston, that

1097
02:10:00,296 --> 02:10:18,345
[SPEAKER_07]: that administrators at Cambridge Ridge Latin explicitly try to intimidate and harass students to not protest, including attempting to threaten students with various, with punishment if they proceed with their protest, which they of course did.

1098
02:10:20,052 --> 02:10:34,535
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would certainly hope to see in the near future something to prevent such a situation from happening at Medford public schools, whether it is through the most likely a collaboration with the school committee.

1099
02:10:34,815 --> 02:10:45,677
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think generally, like making sure that we are protecting people when they are protesting or they are monitoring ICE agents is

1100
02:10:46,898 --> 02:10:48,979
[SPEAKER_07]: highly important when we are talking about the subject.

1101
02:10:49,119 --> 02:10:54,683
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hope that is incorporated at least into future actions of the council.

1102
02:10:54,983 --> 02:10:55,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1103
02:10:58,025 --> 02:10:58,685
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Simon.

1104
02:10:58,705 --> 02:11:05,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Going to stay on Zoom.

1105
02:11:05,370 --> 02:11:06,510
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll go to Eileen Lerner.

1106
02:11:06,530 --> 02:11:09,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Eileen, name and address for the record, please.

1107
02:11:09,372 --> 02:11:10,393
[SPEAKER_11]: And you'll have three minutes.

1108
02:11:17,375 --> 02:11:22,817
[SPEAKER_23]: My name is Eileen Lerner and I live at 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1109
02:11:23,598 --> 02:11:26,859
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm strongly in support of this resolution.

1110
02:11:27,700 --> 02:11:31,161
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm very grateful to the city council for taking it up.

1111
02:11:32,962 --> 02:11:37,284
[SPEAKER_23]: Everybody who has spoken has brought up very important issues.

1112
02:11:38,297 --> 02:11:40,178
[SPEAKER_23]: that I certainly agree with.

1113
02:11:41,078 --> 02:11:47,960
[SPEAKER_23]: But I want to talk about another aspect of living in this environment of fear, which is this.

1114
02:11:49,301 --> 02:11:51,421
[SPEAKER_23]: People are self-deported.

1115
02:11:52,982 --> 02:12:03,005
[SPEAKER_23]: I myself have acquired some foster family members from India.

1116
02:12:03,606 --> 02:12:07,207
[SPEAKER_23]: Both of the parents are here because they have

1117
02:12:08,135 --> 02:12:11,277
[SPEAKER_23]: work visa because of their skills in IT.

1118
02:12:12,498 --> 02:12:25,065
[SPEAKER_23]: However, the father has not had his visa renewed and the family is frightened by what's going on and prefers to move back to India.

1119
02:12:26,966 --> 02:12:34,411
[SPEAKER_23]: This is a horrible loss to me and other people who care about this family, but also

1120
02:12:35,328 --> 02:12:44,232
[SPEAKER_23]: They're deporting many people who have valuable skills and will no longer be available to work in those fields.

1121
02:12:45,512 --> 02:13:03,300
[SPEAKER_23]: Not only that, but even lower skilled people who work in nursing homes and assisted living and hospitals, these people are leaving or being deported and our workforce is being depleted.

1122
02:13:04,257 --> 02:13:10,145
[SPEAKER_23]: And many people will be left without care, without people to care for them.

1123
02:13:10,165 --> 02:13:15,312
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's just a very sad situation.

1124
02:13:15,332 --> 02:13:19,598
[SPEAKER_23]: And as far as there being two sides,

1125
02:13:20,525 --> 02:13:21,245
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, right.

1126
02:13:21,405 --> 02:13:22,586
[SPEAKER_23]: There's two sides.

1127
02:13:22,786 --> 02:13:24,966
[SPEAKER_23]: There's good and there's evil.

1128
02:13:25,607 --> 02:13:28,788
[SPEAKER_23]: And what's going on now is definitely evil.

1129
02:13:29,028 --> 02:13:32,829
[SPEAKER_23]: And I applaud you all for being willing to stand up for it.

1130
02:13:33,649 --> 02:13:41,832
[SPEAKER_23]: If more people had stood up for the right thing before the Holocaust, perhaps that would not have happened.

1131
02:13:42,112 --> 02:13:46,133
[SPEAKER_23]: But at least here in the United States, we are standing up.

1132
02:13:46,974 --> 02:13:47,934
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you very much.

1133
02:13:51,910 --> 02:13:52,730
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Eileen.

1134
02:13:52,750 --> 02:13:57,452
[SPEAKER_11]: We have Radhika.

1135
02:13:57,472 --> 02:13:59,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Radhika, name and address for the record, please.

1136
02:13:59,653 --> 02:14:01,133
[SPEAKER_11]: And you'll have three minutes.

1137
02:14:05,154 --> 02:14:06,715
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello, my name is Radhika.

1138
02:14:06,815 --> 02:14:08,976
[SPEAKER_22]: I live at 12 Walden Road in Medford.

1139
02:14:08,996 --> 02:14:11,316
[SPEAKER_22]: I moved here last year with my family.

1140
02:14:13,395 --> 02:14:16,075
[SPEAKER_22]: want to voice my support for this resolution.

1141
02:14:16,296 --> 02:14:26,277
[SPEAKER_22]: And I echo a lot of the sentiments that have been spoken today by the council members, as well as all the individuals who are standing up and speaking out.

1142
02:14:27,558 --> 02:14:30,678
[SPEAKER_22]: I just wanted to offer two additional things to consider.

1143
02:14:32,158 --> 02:14:40,900
[SPEAKER_22]: One, you know, the folks in Minneapolis are in Minnesota are going through this, as well as our community members.

1144
02:14:41,590 --> 02:14:47,053
[SPEAKER_22]: And I could talk about the fear that I have as a brown person living here, regardless of the fact that I'm a citizen.

1145
02:14:49,374 --> 02:14:58,258
[SPEAKER_22]: But I think something that we should all be doing are taking lessons learned from our fellow Americans in Minnesota.

1146
02:14:58,678 --> 02:15:03,560
[SPEAKER_22]: There are things that they're doing that we can echo here in our own communities.

1147
02:15:04,240 --> 02:15:09,143
[SPEAKER_22]: And I would like to see a consolidated effort

1148
02:15:10,233 --> 02:15:14,855
[SPEAKER_22]: to really understand what works and what doesn't and try to apply those things here.

1149
02:15:15,255 --> 02:15:33,101
[SPEAKER_22]: And then secondly, I see a lot of folks in my own echo chamber, I guess, talk about economic resistance, things that we can do like boycotting institutions and corporations that support ICE.

1150
02:15:33,941 --> 02:15:35,722
[SPEAKER_22]: And if we can, as a community,

1151
02:15:37,101 --> 02:15:43,712
[SPEAKER_22]: identify those institutions and corporations and come up with an economic resistance plan, I think that would also send a really loud message.

1152
02:15:44,053 --> 02:15:44,434
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1153
02:15:47,358 --> 02:15:48,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Radhika.

1154
02:15:53,322 --> 02:15:56,324
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, I do have a couple of comments that I want to read.

1155
02:15:57,185 --> 02:16:02,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Dear Council President Bears, I regret that I'm unable to attend Tuesday night's City Council meeting, either in person or by Zoom.

1156
02:16:03,449 --> 02:16:09,933
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm in full support of the resolution before the Council tonight that condemns the murderous actions of ICE agents in Minneapolis and elsewhere.

1157
02:16:09,953 --> 02:16:15,897
[SPEAKER_11]: I join the call for our Mayor and Police Chief to be boldly proactive in the face of this lawlessness.

1158
02:16:16,398 --> 02:16:17,679
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to be prepared.

1159
02:16:18,299 --> 02:16:21,181
[SPEAKER_11]: Proud of our council for speaking up loudly for justice and safety.

1160
02:16:21,341 --> 02:16:24,284
[SPEAKER_11]: Ellen Epstein, Grove Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

1161
02:16:27,666 --> 02:16:28,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, Councilors.

1162
02:16:28,667 --> 02:16:31,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I'm unable to attend in person tonight, I'd like to submit the following.

1163
02:16:32,370 --> 02:16:33,431
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Mike Denton.

1164
02:16:33,531 --> 02:16:36,013
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a business owner in Medford, and I'm a Medford resident.

1165
02:16:37,374 --> 02:16:40,236
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone, every human deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.

1166
02:16:40,777 --> 02:16:46,661
[SPEAKER_11]: Where matters of immigration policy and enforcement are concerned, everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.

1167
02:16:47,557 --> 02:16:50,979
[SPEAKER_11]: It is beyond dispute that ICE is not treating people with dignity or respect.

1168
02:16:51,479 --> 02:16:52,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Quite the opposite, in fact.

1169
02:16:53,079 --> 02:16:58,402
[SPEAKER_11]: ICE is a domestic terror squad, brutalizing and terrorizing people who are undeserving of such treatment.

1170
02:16:59,002 --> 02:17:08,366
[SPEAKER_11]: Moreover, given the frequency of, quote, detentions that occur without ICE agents presenting identification or a judicial warrant, ICE represents a federal agency that is acting outside of the law.

1171
02:17:09,086 --> 02:17:14,449
[SPEAKER_11]: ICE's behavior represents a gross abuse of power that demands exceptional actions in response from our elected officials.

1172
02:17:15,089 --> 02:17:16,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Innocent bystanders have been murdered.

1173
02:17:17,290 --> 02:17:19,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Innocent people have died in detention centers.

1174
02:17:19,811 --> 02:17:31,816
[SPEAKER_11]: American citizens have been assaulted and kidnapped solely because of how they look, and because ICE agents have either refused to accept the ID people have presented, or as would be totally reasonable, because people were not carrying their passports with them at the time.

1175
02:17:32,436 --> 02:17:38,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Or in the case of three Oglala Lakota tribal members who were kidnapped recently, they didn't have their tribal IDs on them.

1176
02:17:39,394 --> 02:17:40,875
[SPEAKER_11]: I mentioned that I am a Medford resident.

1177
02:17:41,135 --> 02:17:43,816
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm originally from Canada and I am a legal permanent resident.

1178
02:17:44,336 --> 02:17:45,457
[SPEAKER_11]: I also happen to be white.

1179
02:17:45,997 --> 02:17:51,980
[SPEAKER_11]: I mention this because we must be clear that white immigrants are not being hunted down in the streets and in our schools and in stores and businesses.

1180
02:17:52,520 --> 02:17:57,222
[SPEAKER_11]: It is exclusively people of color and we must acknowledge the reality that this is an ethnic cleansing mission.

1181
02:17:57,843 --> 02:18:02,525
[SPEAKER_11]: We have brute squads with carte blanche from the president and his administration to terrorize the public.

1182
02:18:03,165 --> 02:18:08,848
[SPEAKER_11]: This is authoritarianism and we are living in a time that calls for exceptional actions from those in positions of power and authority.

1183
02:18:09,542 --> 02:18:14,487
[SPEAKER_11]: In Medford, that means the mayor, the chief of police, the entire police department, and the city council.

1184
02:18:14,947 --> 02:18:22,194
[SPEAKER_11]: For the sake of being as clear as I can be, what I'm looking for from Medford is an insurance that the Medford police will arrest any ICE agents found breaking the law.

1185
02:18:22,655 --> 02:18:27,459
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking for the mayor to come out as a vocal supporter of arresting and charging ICE agents for criminal behavior.

1186
02:18:28,100 --> 02:18:32,844
[SPEAKER_11]: Ultimately, we, the residents of Medford, are looking for action from our elected officials now.

1187
02:18:33,205 --> 02:18:33,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1188
02:18:40,232 --> 02:18:53,459
[SPEAKER_11]: I also have two things I'd like to read from two people in Minneapolis, and there are many other stories that I think are more than worth reading.

1189
02:18:53,479 --> 02:18:58,962
[SPEAKER_11]: And mind you, some of these are now days or even a week old, and things have gotten worse.

1190
02:19:00,722 --> 02:19:03,504
[SPEAKER_11]: from a daycare and early childhood educator in Minneapolis.

1191
02:19:03,944 --> 02:19:05,425
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Tuesday, January 13th.

1192
02:19:06,025 --> 02:19:10,708
[SPEAKER_11]: I spent the morning rewriting my program's lockdown plans and training staff in our updated protocols.

1193
02:19:11,489 --> 02:19:14,510
[SPEAKER_11]: ICE's presence has expanded now to 3,500 officers.

1194
02:19:15,031 --> 02:19:18,253
[SPEAKER_11]: We have more ICE officers in the Twin Cities than actual police officers.

1195
02:19:19,176 --> 02:19:21,537
[SPEAKER_11]: On my way to work today, I turned on the radio.

1196
02:19:21,777 --> 02:19:26,118
[SPEAKER_11]: For a moment, I couldn't tell if the news being broadcast was about Iran or Minneapolis.

1197
02:19:26,778 --> 02:19:31,780
[SPEAKER_11]: The line was that, quote, masked officers, arms with guns, are removing people from the streets.

1198
02:19:32,740 --> 02:19:33,920
[SPEAKER_11]: What a strange time this is.

1199
02:19:34,641 --> 02:19:38,942
[SPEAKER_11]: My staff have begun driving kids to and from the center when parents don't feel safe leaving their homes.

1200
02:19:39,750 --> 02:19:45,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Our local school district has started, quote, patrol parades at pick-up and drop-off time to make sure children get home safely.

1201
02:19:46,651 --> 02:19:50,632
[SPEAKER_11]: There is no adherence to constitutional rights or local laws by the ICE officers.

1202
02:19:51,252 --> 02:19:54,153
[SPEAKER_11]: Peaceful protesters and observers are being beaten and arrested.

1203
02:19:54,833 --> 02:20:01,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Yesterday, a few blocks from the shooting, ICE officers ran into the back of a US citizen's car, totaling it, then demanded his paperwork.

1204
02:20:01,974 --> 02:20:03,394
[SPEAKER_11]: He was Latino and refused.

1205
02:20:04,014 --> 02:20:07,755
[SPEAKER_11]: They bailed quickly after tear-gassing his wife, who is also a US citizen.

1206
02:20:08,748 --> 02:20:15,513
[SPEAKER_11]: This weekend, they went onto the only Minneapolis reservation, Little Earth, located in South Minneapolis, and arrested Native Americans.

1207
02:20:16,253 --> 02:20:19,916
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going door-to-door in select neighborhoods using battering rams to break down doors.

1208
02:20:20,856 --> 02:20:25,179
[SPEAKER_11]: Yesterday, ICE approached several health clinics in Minneapolis that refused entry without a warrant.

1209
02:20:25,719 --> 02:20:32,064
[SPEAKER_11]: The situation appeared to diffuse until an hour later, when an anonymous bomb threat was called in, causing the building to evacuate.

1210
02:20:32,644 --> 02:20:34,966
[SPEAKER_11]: At that time, ICE agents arrested people of color.

1211
02:20:35,704 --> 02:20:43,346
[SPEAKER_11]: At a Chick-fil-A in the cities, two agents came in and told the manager that they had accidentally hit two cars in the parking lot and needed to meet the owners to pay for damage.

1212
02:20:43,846 --> 02:20:46,707
[SPEAKER_11]: When the two employees went outside to look at the damage, there was none.

1213
02:20:47,027 --> 02:20:48,167
[SPEAKER_11]: They were both abducted.

1214
02:20:49,207 --> 02:20:54,109
[SPEAKER_11]: SNAP, WIC, and CACFP funding has been temporarily frozen to the state by the federal government.

1215
02:20:54,629 --> 02:20:58,830
[SPEAKER_11]: These are all programs that provide funds for low-income individuals and families to afford food.

1216
02:21:00,113 --> 02:21:03,974
[SPEAKER_11]: While I was writing this, I got a text from a child care center that partners with Head Start in St.

1217
02:21:04,014 --> 02:21:06,535
[SPEAKER_11]: Paul that ICE had arrived in their parking lot.

1218
02:21:07,115 --> 02:21:08,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Agents are going door to door along their block.

1219
02:21:09,276 --> 02:21:10,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Their center is on lockdown.

1220
02:21:11,217 --> 02:21:14,178
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gutted for the families who have to explain this to their children tonight.

1221
02:21:18,507 --> 02:21:20,008
[SPEAKER_11]: From a rabbi in Minneapolis.

1222
02:21:20,489 --> 02:21:20,909
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi all.

1223
02:21:21,109 --> 02:21:22,450
[SPEAKER_11]: What's happening in Minneapolis?

1224
02:21:23,191 --> 02:21:27,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Federal forces with many guns and very little training are hunting and kidnapping my neighbors.

1225
02:21:28,154 --> 02:21:34,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Not just immigrant neighbors, literally every black and brown person in the Twin Cities because racial profiling is real and rampant.

1226
02:21:34,860 --> 02:21:38,122
[SPEAKER_11]: They point guns and shoot guns and eagerly deploy pepper spray.

1227
02:21:38,342 --> 02:21:39,683
[SPEAKER_11]: They ram cars into people.

1228
02:21:39,944 --> 02:21:45,108
[SPEAKER_11]: They're openly racist, misogynistic, homophobic, and transphobic to everyone they come into contact with.

1229
02:21:46,025 --> 02:21:49,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone, literally everyone, single person I know is showing up in countless ways.

1230
02:21:50,587 --> 02:21:54,148
[SPEAKER_11]: People doing ice watch patrols in cars, on bikes, on foot, and from home.

1231
02:21:54,728 --> 02:21:58,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Pre-dawn until late at night to provide warning, witness, documentation, and support.

1232
02:21:59,409 --> 02:22:01,090
[SPEAKER_11]: They're trying their hardest to intimidate us.

1233
02:22:01,170 --> 02:22:05,452
[SPEAKER_11]: They've shown us again and again that they can and will hurt us, and everyone continues to show up.

1234
02:22:06,212 --> 02:22:12,054
[SPEAKER_11]: School patrols every morning, and at recess if the students, the ones safe enough to go to school, are allowed to be outside.

1235
02:22:12,694 --> 02:22:15,275
[SPEAKER_11]: If tear gas hasn't been deployed within a few blocks from their school.

1236
02:22:16,057 --> 02:22:17,518
[SPEAKER_11]: and at dismissal in the afternoon.

1237
02:22:18,278 --> 02:22:42,713
[SPEAKER_11]: The students are organizing walkouts, rides to and from work and the laundromat, grocery deliveries, organizing food and diaper drives, protesting and organizing and offering free acupuncture and helping elders get on signal and nightly noise demos outside their hotel and in 1020 on ice rink sidewalks, 10 to 20 degree weather on ice rink sidewalks.

1238
02:22:43,593 --> 02:22:45,313
[SPEAKER_11]: What can you do for Minneapolis right now?

1239
02:22:45,654 --> 02:22:47,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Donate to neighborhood funds.

1240
02:22:48,394 --> 02:22:50,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Wherever you are, gather with your block or neighborhood.

1241
02:22:50,815 --> 02:22:53,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Talk about what is happening here and make a plan for when it happens there.

1242
02:22:54,376 --> 02:22:57,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Organize for an eviction moratorium and talk about non-cooperation.

1243
02:22:57,857 --> 02:23:01,358
[SPEAKER_11]: And please try to talk to everyone on your block in whistles and mutual aid.

1244
02:23:02,098 --> 02:23:03,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Because your mayor saying F.I.C.E.

1245
02:23:03,699 --> 02:23:12,025
[SPEAKER_11]: and your AG suing ICE and your governor putting the National Guard on alert, all of those things will be largely meaningless while you watch your neighbors get kidnapped in the blink of an eye.

1246
02:23:12,646 --> 02:23:13,106
[SPEAKER_11]: I love you.

1247
02:23:13,226 --> 02:23:17,829
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm praying for the day when our signal threads are repurposed to plan the biggest block party imaginable.

1248
02:23:17,849 --> 02:23:24,694
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1249
02:23:24,874 --> 02:23:27,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for letting me read that.

1250
02:23:30,300 --> 02:23:36,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there anyone else who hasn't had a chance to speak yet who would like to speak at this time?

1251
02:23:40,265 --> 02:23:43,407
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Claire, we'll come back to you and then we'll go to Micah.

1252
02:23:44,127 --> 02:23:45,448
[SPEAKER_11]: If you'd just like to share one more thing.

1253
02:23:47,209 --> 02:23:48,930
[SPEAKER_11]: You gotta come to the microphone, sorry Claire.

1254
02:23:56,739 --> 02:24:01,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever happened to those monthly meetings we used to have with the police department?

1255
02:24:04,304 --> 02:24:05,165
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure.

1256
02:24:05,185 --> 02:24:06,446
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think they've happened since about 2020.

1257
02:24:06,486 --> 02:24:08,847
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't hear you.

1258
02:24:09,087 --> 02:24:11,689
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think they've happened in about five or six years.

1259
02:24:13,530 --> 02:24:14,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's what I'm asking.

1260
02:24:15,071 --> 02:24:16,012
[SPEAKER_08]: What happened to them?

1261
02:24:18,333 --> 02:24:19,514
[SPEAKER_11]: I asked the same question.

1262
02:24:23,177 --> 02:24:23,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Micah?

1263
02:24:27,456 --> 02:24:27,956
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks.

1264
02:24:28,056 --> 02:24:29,497
[SPEAKER_26]: Mikey Kesselman, 499 Main Street.

1265
02:24:30,117 --> 02:24:35,878
[SPEAKER_26]: I just really quickly wanted to respond to something that I've heard repeated here multiple times tonight.

1266
02:24:37,519 --> 02:24:50,942
[SPEAKER_26]: And I understand there's an instinct to defer to law enforcement and to what our local cops state is the situation legally speaking.

1267
02:24:52,062 --> 02:24:54,943
[SPEAKER_26]: But there is no legal precedent

1268
02:24:55,840 --> 02:25:03,245
[SPEAKER_26]: that says local cops cannot enforce criminal code against federal agents.

1269
02:25:04,105 --> 02:25:08,568
[SPEAKER_26]: If they are breaking the law, they can be arrested.

1270
02:25:09,268 --> 02:25:19,855
[SPEAKER_26]: Moreover, it is actually illegal for DHS and any other federal law enforcement agent to

1271
02:25:21,349 --> 02:25:34,735
[SPEAKER_26]: knowingly be bystander to a fellow LEO's breach of constitutional rights that is actually under federal code, that is itself a crime.

1272
02:25:36,395 --> 02:25:46,740
[SPEAKER_26]: So there's many reasons that MPD could actually do something with their

1273
02:25:49,349 --> 02:25:51,530
[SPEAKER_26]: state-condoned use of force and violence.

1274
02:25:53,090 --> 02:25:59,453
[SPEAKER_26]: And the only reason that they're not has nothing to do with law or precedent.

1275
02:26:01,274 --> 02:26:07,556
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't even think it has to necessarily do with them being afraid to confront ICE officers.

1276
02:26:08,096 --> 02:26:12,198
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it's because the police union,

1277
02:26:12,867 --> 02:26:14,048
[SPEAKER_26]: is in support of this garbage.

1278
02:26:14,989 --> 02:26:22,414
[SPEAKER_26]: And they're more loyal to their union than they are to the city that they are meant to serve and protect.

1279
02:26:23,435 --> 02:26:35,203
[SPEAKER_26]: We saw in Minneapolis where the cops union came out in support of Jonathan Ross, who murdered, executed a woman in broad daylight.

1280
02:26:35,944 --> 02:26:39,967
[SPEAKER_26]: Now Jonathan Ross will get what's his at some point, I am sure.

1281
02:26:41,193 --> 02:26:52,081
[SPEAKER_26]: But it's crazy that the cops came out trying to protect a murderer.

1282
02:26:52,481 --> 02:26:53,422
[SPEAKER_26]: We all saw it.

1283
02:26:54,963 --> 02:27:01,808
[SPEAKER_26]: So to the local cops, to the MPD, protect the citizens.

1284
02:27:02,669 --> 02:27:07,152
[SPEAKER_26]: At the end of the day, you're not the only one who has a state mandate to use force in self-defense.

1285
02:27:08,113 --> 02:27:09,294
[SPEAKER_26]: So do your goddamn job.

1286
02:27:13,087 --> 02:27:13,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1287
02:27:17,029 --> 02:27:20,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Not seeing any further comment in person or on Zoom.

1288
02:27:23,513 --> 02:27:29,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there anything, any further comment from members of the council or motions from the council at this time?

1289
02:27:32,017 --> 02:27:33,578
[SPEAKER_11]: Council Vice President Lazzaro.

1290
02:27:33,598 --> 02:27:35,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1291
02:27:35,659 --> 02:27:41,082
[SPEAKER_06]: I would motion to send this paper to the Public Health and Community Safety Committee

1292
02:27:46,247 --> 02:27:47,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Tseng.

1293
02:27:48,949 --> 02:27:49,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1294
02:27:50,730 --> 02:27:56,313
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to thank my fellow councillors for their support and their words today.

1295
02:27:58,374 --> 02:28:00,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Even just sitting here, I've learned a lot.

1296
02:28:01,596 --> 02:28:04,758
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's what the council is about, right?

1297
02:28:05,079 --> 02:28:15,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if we agree on an issue, there's so much conversation to be had about what we can do better, what angles we can take, what perspectives

1298
02:28:16,250 --> 02:28:21,674
[SPEAKER_09]: we need to hear from and I think tonight I have learned a lot from all of you guys too.

1299
02:28:24,316 --> 02:28:28,440
[SPEAKER_09]: I also want to thank all the residents who spoke tonight for their comments.

1300
02:28:31,042 --> 02:28:38,488
[SPEAKER_09]: The last few months as a person of color, as an immigrant, have often felt pretty isolating.

1301
02:28:39,420 --> 02:28:59,088
[SPEAKER_09]: But today has been especially moving seeing our community really come together, affirm their support for people of color, for immigrant neighbors, and for the rule of law, justice, liberty in the city.

1302
02:28:59,608 --> 02:29:00,429
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's for everyone.

1303
02:29:01,269 --> 02:29:04,310
[SPEAKER_09]: We all win when we stand up for each other.

1304
02:29:05,751 --> 02:29:08,092
[SPEAKER_09]: I think tonight really represents the best of us.

1305
02:29:09,629 --> 02:29:20,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Not only are we reaffirming those values and standing up for each other and saying those things, but our residents have put together real steps forward that we can all take.

1306
02:29:22,715 --> 02:29:27,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Good suggestions for what more we can do, things we need to look at, things we should be looking at.

1307
02:29:29,839 --> 02:29:36,222
[SPEAKER_09]: And the truth is the council and the school committee have been working really, really hard to do everything we can.

1308
02:29:36,868 --> 02:29:38,389
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'm sure there's a lot more we can do.

1309
02:29:39,309 --> 02:29:50,595
[SPEAKER_09]: And tonight's ideas I think give us a lot of fodder for future conversation, a lot of thoughts for us to chew on.

1310
02:29:54,257 --> 02:30:01,961
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think my fellow Councilors and residents are right that we need to see more leadership at different levels as well.

1311
02:30:04,345 --> 02:30:10,191
[SPEAKER_09]: There's only so much that we can do as city councilors and as school committee members.

1312
02:30:10,911 --> 02:30:13,734
[SPEAKER_09]: We do need the mayor to do everything she can.

1313
02:30:14,355 --> 02:30:17,297
[SPEAKER_09]: We need the police to stand by our community too.

1314
02:30:18,579 --> 02:30:29,109
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to continue those conversations and really push them to answer the questions that residents have raised tonight and to let residents know.

1315
02:30:31,084 --> 02:30:34,105
[SPEAKER_09]: what is the most that we can do to protect our neighborhoods.

1316
02:30:36,226 --> 02:30:46,529
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a suggestion about amending this resolution, so I would like to offer an amendment to just add something about the schools.

1317
02:30:47,710 --> 02:30:58,053
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to add, be it further resolved that the Committee on Public Health and Community Safety work with school administration and school community members to protect our students' safety and their right to protest.

1318
02:30:59,080 --> 02:30:59,980
[SPEAKER_09]: just to add that at the end.

1319
02:31:00,661 --> 02:31:01,101
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you all.

1320
02:31:01,521 --> 02:31:02,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1321
02:31:02,341 --> 02:31:04,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you email that to me and the clerk?

1322
02:31:04,602 --> 02:31:16,046
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, would it be possible for us to sever the

1323
02:31:23,049 --> 02:31:29,055
[SPEAKER_11]: last three clauses plus your amended clause and refer those to committee and just approve the first two clauses?

1324
02:31:29,315 --> 02:31:29,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, 100%.

1325
02:31:30,516 --> 02:31:40,785
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

1326
02:31:40,825 --> 02:31:43,148
[SPEAKER_06]: President Perez, could you repeat what you just said about severing?

1327
02:31:45,290 --> 02:31:46,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, could you say that again?

1328
02:31:46,811 --> 02:31:48,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you repeat what you just said about the severing?

1329
02:31:50,029 --> 02:32:01,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, just the basically taking the things that reference the Public Health and Community Safety Committee and referring them there, but just approving the first two resolutions.

1330
02:32:02,281 --> 02:32:02,601
[SPEAKER_20]: Got it.

1331
02:32:02,741 --> 02:32:03,042
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

1332
02:32:05,744 --> 02:32:06,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Leming.

1333
02:32:11,020 --> 02:32:15,649
[SPEAKER_16]: I agree with all the amendments and motions to sever.

1334
02:32:15,890 --> 02:32:20,900
[SPEAKER_16]: Just did want to make just some small follow-up points, which is that

1335
02:32:23,100 --> 02:32:26,102
[SPEAKER_16]: These conversations propaganda always plays a big part of it.

1336
02:32:26,122 --> 02:32:34,986
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean if you go to the DHS's official website or The web the news coverage that ice itself is putting out.

1337
02:32:35,026 --> 02:32:47,652
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just it's pure propaganda the news environment these days is is absolutely terrible, it's like I've had conversations with with my own parents where I'm I'm

1338
02:32:49,293 --> 02:33:04,420
[SPEAKER_16]: appalled at some of the stuff they're reading where they're not really understanding the extent of what's going on just because their news consumption is very different.

1339
02:33:04,500 --> 02:33:12,124
[SPEAKER_16]: But details about what happens when people are imprisoned and deported is out there.

1340
02:33:12,144 --> 02:33:13,505
[SPEAKER_16]: The New Yorker did a pretty

1341
02:33:14,125 --> 02:33:31,519
[SPEAKER_16]: good story back in November called Disappeared to a Foreign Prison, which is a very nice investigative journalism piece about what actually happens to people when they're detained and the months-long process of sort of what goes on behind closed doors.

1342
02:33:33,600 --> 02:33:54,770
[SPEAKER_16]: But I've also talked with, I've also had plenty of conversations with residents who go down their own social media rabbit holes and their beliefs are still that, you know, it's only criminals that are being detained or whatever.

1343
02:33:54,790 --> 02:33:57,771
[SPEAKER_16]: So that, so it's,

1344
02:34:00,152 --> 02:34:09,850
[SPEAKER_16]: When talking to neighbors, when talking to relatives, try to find out what they're looking at, because propaganda is in a...

1345
02:34:11,523 --> 02:34:13,705
[SPEAKER_16]: very, very bad spot in this country.

1346
02:34:16,028 --> 02:34:27,939
[SPEAKER_16]: Personally, I've been... the more that I see, the more that I've been having less patience on a personal level with centrist takes whenever I see them, because when times are...

1347
02:34:32,143 --> 02:34:38,545
[SPEAKER_16]: It's usually the more, the centrist take is usually not the right one.

1348
02:34:38,725 --> 02:34:40,445
[SPEAKER_16]: This is not a both sides argument.

1349
02:34:43,746 --> 02:34:45,066
[SPEAKER_16]: Times are really bad right now.

1350
02:34:47,367 --> 02:34:51,788
[SPEAKER_16]: When the ICE surge does happen, just remember that it's okay to make their jobs as difficult as possible.

1351
02:34:52,208 --> 02:34:52,568
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1352
02:34:55,549 --> 02:34:56,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

1353
02:34:57,548 --> 02:35:20,013
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a motion from Councilor Tseng to amend the paper to add the clause that he read out and to sever the paper with the first two resolutions being approved and the

1354
02:35:23,860 --> 02:35:29,361
[SPEAKER_11]: third, fourth, fifth, and sixth resolutions being referred to the Public Health and Community Safety Committee.

1355
02:35:30,802 --> 02:35:32,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that motion have a second?

1356
02:35:34,942 --> 02:35:36,443
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1357
02:35:37,203 --> 02:35:38,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Any further discussion by members of the Council?

1358
02:35:42,644 --> 02:35:44,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1359
02:35:50,126 --> 02:35:50,726
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on the whole thing.

1360
02:35:58,217 --> 02:35:59,157
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Callahan?

1361
02:36:00,338 --> 02:36:00,678
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1362
02:36:00,698 --> 02:36:01,918
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Lazzaro?

1363
02:36:02,378 --> 02:36:02,738
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1364
02:36:04,439 --> 02:36:05,099
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Leming?

1365
02:36:05,119 --> 02:36:05,179
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1366
02:36:06,600 --> 02:36:07,200
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Mulley?

1367
02:36:07,220 --> 02:36:07,280
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1368
02:36:08,680 --> 02:36:09,620
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1369
02:36:10,261 --> 02:36:10,541
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1370
02:36:11,921 --> 02:36:12,541
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Tseng?

1371
02:36:12,561 --> 02:36:12,621
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1372
02:36:13,922 --> 02:36:14,562
[SPEAKER_17]: President Bears?

1373
02:36:15,022 --> 02:36:15,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1374
02:36:15,362 --> 02:36:16,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1375
02:36:16,983 --> 02:36:17,863
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion passes.

1376
02:36:20,603 --> 02:36:24,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you everyone who joined us tonight to talk about this important issue.

1377
02:36:24,369 --> 02:36:34,524
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to continue the work that we've been doing over the past year and really the past six years to protect our community.

1378
02:36:38,145 --> 02:36:57,750
[SPEAKER_11]: 26-018, resolution to increase the vacation time for the employees of the City of Medford, whereas employees of the City of Medford receive only two weeks of vacation per year for their first five years, which is lower than surrounding municipalities, and whereas this makes Medford less competitive when attempting to attract new employees, and surrounding municipalities such as Boston and Summerville have longer vacation policies.

1379
02:36:58,310 --> 02:37:05,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, therefore, be it resolved that Chapter 66, Article 3, Section 66-64 of Medford's Code of Ordinances be amended as followed,

1380
02:37:06,813 --> 02:37:11,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Subject to the provisions of subsection A of the section, vacation shall be computed in the following manner.

1381
02:37:11,615 --> 02:37:14,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Four weeks vacation for employees who have served up to and not more than five years.

1382
02:37:15,577 --> 02:37:19,439
[SPEAKER_11]: Five weeks vacation for employees who have served not less than five years nor more than 10 years.

1383
02:37:19,999 --> 02:37:22,701
[SPEAKER_11]: Six weeks vacation for employees who have served not less than 10 years.

1384
02:37:23,361 --> 02:37:25,822
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it for the resolve of this be effective immediately upon passage.

1385
02:37:25,842 --> 02:37:28,904
[SPEAKER_11]: This was offered by Councilor Leming and I will recognize Councilor Leming.

1386
02:37:30,087 --> 02:37:32,108
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Council President Bears.

1387
02:37:32,429 --> 02:37:49,999
[SPEAKER_16]: This came up because I was talking to some early employees that I know within City Hall, and they said that a big part, a very difficult part of the new employees package was the fact that during your first five years here, you only get two weeks of vacation time per year.

1388
02:37:50,739 --> 02:37:52,280
[SPEAKER_16]: which is very low.

1389
02:37:53,882 --> 02:38:08,133
[SPEAKER_16]: By ordinance, it increases slightly after five years and then 10 years, but even so, for your first five years, you only get a total of two weeks of vacation.

1390
02:38:08,193 --> 02:38:16,640
[SPEAKER_16]: Furthermore, there's a six month long probationary period, which is unusually long, in which time they can't have any vacation.

1391
02:38:17,961 --> 02:38:23,428
[SPEAKER_16]: I talked with HR Director Lisa Crowley about this in a little more detail.

1392
02:38:23,448 --> 02:38:32,158
[SPEAKER_16]: And this likely should be referred to the Admin and Finance Committee just to talk about

1393
02:38:33,879 --> 02:38:43,125
[SPEAKER_16]: just to talk about how this intersects with union contracts, as well as the city's ability to pay for the extra PTO.

1394
02:38:43,425 --> 02:38:53,292
[SPEAKER_16]: But I do think that the reduction from six months to three months probationary period is fairly uncontroversial.

1395
02:38:54,653 --> 02:39:16,993
[SPEAKER_16]: one part of our current ordinance that all parties involved seem to think should be changed, but she did want some extra time for discussion on what would be a better vacation day policy than we have right now, as well as

1396
02:39:18,494 --> 02:39:27,259
[SPEAKER_16]: some other discussions about how this impacts union and non-union employees and how this affects city budget.

1397
02:39:27,319 --> 02:39:40,148
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would motion to refer this to the Admin and Finance Committee and to invite HR Director Crowley to talk about it in a meeting.

1398
02:39:44,465 --> 02:39:50,207
[SPEAKER_11]: on the motion of Councilor Leming to refer this to the Administration and Finance Committee, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1399
02:39:50,267 --> 02:39:52,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there any further discussion by members of the Council?

1400
02:39:55,610 --> 02:39:57,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1401
02:40:01,472 --> 02:40:02,232
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Callahan?

1402
02:40:02,252 --> 02:40:02,332
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1403
02:40:04,133 --> 02:40:05,233
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Lazzaro?

1404
02:40:05,834 --> 02:40:06,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1405
02:40:07,754 --> 02:40:08,475
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Leming?

1406
02:40:08,795 --> 02:40:09,015
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1407
02:40:09,835 --> 02:40:10,436
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Malay?

1408
02:40:10,456 --> 02:40:10,516
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1409
02:40:12,096 --> 02:40:13,057
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1410
02:40:13,637 --> 02:40:13,877
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1411
02:40:15,372 --> 02:40:16,072
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Tseng.

1412
02:40:17,133 --> 02:40:17,753
[SPEAKER_17]: President Pierce.

1413
02:40:17,953 --> 02:40:19,234
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I have an affirmative and a negative.

1414
02:40:19,254 --> 02:40:20,215
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion passes.

1415
02:40:21,275 --> 02:40:23,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Tseng, could you take the chair?

1416
02:40:23,056 --> 02:40:29,100
[SPEAKER_11]: Our vice president and our longest serving councillor are both not present right now.

1417
02:40:45,632 --> 02:40:46,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Rare day.

1418
02:40:46,652 --> 02:40:48,472
[SPEAKER_09]: I realize you took it.

1419
02:40:48,553 --> 02:41:01,475
[SPEAKER_09]: I left it at the chair.

1420
02:41:15,575 --> 02:41:15,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1421
02:41:17,137 --> 02:41:17,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1422
02:41:20,640 --> 02:41:26,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Resolution 26-019 offered by Council President Bears.

1423
02:41:27,747 --> 02:41:33,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Proposed ordinance banning face surveillance technology and amendment to Chapter 50, Article 4.

1424
02:41:34,113 --> 02:41:34,593
[SPEAKER_09]: President Bears?

1425
02:41:44,785 --> 02:41:45,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, there we go.

1426
02:41:45,466 --> 02:41:45,907
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.

1427
02:41:45,987 --> 02:41:46,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1428
02:41:48,150 --> 02:41:53,698
[SPEAKER_11]: You might want to turn me down maybe to see the volume on the, yeah.

1429
02:41:54,920 --> 02:41:58,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Always got to be adjusting those volume levels for everybody.

1430
02:41:58,825 --> 02:42:00,448
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not an easy job up there.

1431
02:42:02,068 --> 02:42:14,532
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is a draft ordinance banning face surveillance technology as residents are likely aware and certainly Councilors are aware we have an ordinance called the Community Control over Public Surveillance Ordinance.

1432
02:42:15,192 --> 02:42:28,616
[SPEAKER_11]: That ordinance requires the city council to review use policies and approve them for the use of any type of surveillance technology that falls into the criteria of the CCOPS ordinance right now.

1433
02:42:29,516 --> 02:42:37,600
[SPEAKER_11]: There's only, I think, one significant exemption, which is until January 2028, body-worn cameras do not have to have a use policy.

1434
02:42:38,761 --> 02:42:46,225
[SPEAKER_11]: This is kind of going a little bit beyond that for one specific type of technology, and that technology is face surveillance.

1435
02:42:46,865 --> 02:42:58,431
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is really an apt conversation to be having on the night that we also just had a conversation about the lawlessness of ICE, one of the,

1436
02:42:59,832 --> 02:43:01,953
[SPEAKER_11]: main tools that they are using.

1437
02:43:02,033 --> 02:43:23,225
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the reasons, if there are any reasons, that there are all of these arrests of people is that they're basically using bunk face surveillance technology and constantly trying to use phones and apps and cameras to scan people's faces and dump them into a federal database and, you know, use that for whatever enforcement or

1438
02:43:23,965 --> 02:43:27,748
[SPEAKER_11]: You know other word you want to use for what they're doing purposes.

1439
02:43:28,949 --> 02:43:37,516
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been really clear that face surveillance technology is something that can be pretty easily abused and.

1440
02:43:39,856 --> 02:43:42,357
[SPEAKER_11]: that we don't want our government to be using.

1441
02:43:42,557 --> 02:43:44,178
[SPEAKER_11]: We've just seen the abuses so clearly.

1442
02:43:44,198 --> 02:43:50,081
[SPEAKER_11]: This ordinance, you know, I can, I won't read word for word, but it's actually pretty simple.

1443
02:43:50,821 --> 02:43:56,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of, you know, under this currency cops where the, you know, the city could come forward and say,

1444
02:43:57,251 --> 02:43:59,572
[SPEAKER_11]: here's face surveillance and here's how we plan to use it.

1445
02:44:00,052 --> 02:44:14,960
[SPEAKER_11]: This would just say we're not going to use it to obtain, retain, possess, access, or use any face surveillance system, or enter into agreement with a third party for that same purpose, or issue a permit for any authority on behalf of Medford or a Medford official to use those systems.

1446
02:44:16,121 --> 02:44:25,545
[SPEAKER_11]: There is state law here, Section 220 of Chapter 6 of the Mass General Laws, which does authorize and would still authorize our

1447
02:44:27,146 --> 02:44:41,535
[SPEAKER_11]: police department to obtain or possess an electronic device for evidentiary purposes, use face recognition on an electronic device and social media and automated reduction software.

1448
02:44:41,575 --> 02:44:50,221
[SPEAKER_11]: That's because from time to time, essentially there's a facial recognition exemption in the state law.

1449
02:44:50,748 --> 02:45:06,978
[SPEAKER_11]: where if there is an active criminal investigation, if there's like, you're trying to find someone who's committed a violent crime, the state law says that Medford Police or other agencies could use the state system for that.

1450
02:45:07,959 --> 02:45:11,301
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure there are folks who could speak to that in more detail.

1451
02:45:12,021 --> 02:45:15,944
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, this does allow the other things like the use of

1452
02:45:17,815 --> 02:45:23,339
[SPEAKER_11]: your face ID on your phone for logging in to a device.

1453
02:45:23,679 --> 02:45:47,217
[SPEAKER_11]: So there are some very clear and plain use exemptions to this, but it's mainly that the city is not going to buy or license or authorize someone else on behalf of the city to collect facial recognition data and then use that for

1454
02:45:48,824 --> 02:45:50,324
[SPEAKER_11]: whatever purposes that may be used for.

1455
02:45:51,345 --> 02:45:51,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1456
02:45:53,865 --> 02:46:02,107
[SPEAKER_11]: And actually, before I finish, I do want to thank Medford People Power, ACLU of Massachusetts as well for working with me on this.

1457
02:46:03,127 --> 02:46:03,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Bears.

1458
02:46:03,948 --> 02:46:06,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any comments from other Councilors?

1459
02:46:12,790 --> 02:46:17,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, do we have any comments from any motions on the floor?

1460
02:46:23,310 --> 02:46:23,810
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Beres?

1461
02:46:24,151 --> 02:46:25,512
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd move to approve for first reading.

1462
02:46:26,352 --> 02:46:28,133
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a motion to approve for the first reading.

1463
02:46:28,153 --> 02:46:29,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have a second on that motion?

1464
02:46:32,056 --> 02:46:34,137
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a second from Councilor Mullane.

1465
02:46:35,258 --> 02:46:37,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any comments from the public?

1466
02:46:41,883 --> 02:46:45,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none in person, seeing none on Zoom.

1467
02:46:46,206 --> 02:46:47,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Micah.

1468
02:46:50,552 --> 02:46:53,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Just request to speak on the thing.

1469
02:46:54,253 --> 02:46:54,693
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not on.

1470
02:46:57,854 --> 02:46:58,314
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.

1471
02:46:58,574 --> 02:46:59,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Give me a sec.

1472
02:46:59,934 --> 02:47:00,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1473
02:47:03,395 --> 02:47:03,775
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.

1474
02:47:03,895 --> 02:47:04,175
[SPEAKER_09]: You're on.

1475
02:47:06,335 --> 02:47:07,776
[SPEAKER_26]: Mikey Kussman, 499 Main Street.

1476
02:47:09,316 --> 02:47:12,176
[SPEAKER_26]: I just want to have white support for this ordinance.

1477
02:47:12,576 --> 02:47:14,757
[SPEAKER_26]: It's not a big thing.

1478
02:47:14,937 --> 02:47:19,698
[SPEAKER_26]: It's small, admittedly, but it's, you know,

1479
02:47:21,265 --> 02:47:22,867
[SPEAKER_26]: still important within the city.

1480
02:47:23,207 --> 02:47:31,795
[SPEAKER_26]: We know that facial recognition technology is being abused egregiously across the country and across different layers and levels of government.

1481
02:47:32,916 --> 02:47:44,867
[SPEAKER_26]: I would love to see an amendment or an extension that sort of also includes a blanket ban on any LEO use, which probably wouldn't be

1482
02:47:46,323 --> 02:47:51,406
[SPEAKER_26]: probably wouldn't be enforceable, but it also has a severability clause, so if it's not enforceable, then whatever.

1483
02:47:52,746 --> 02:47:56,689
[SPEAKER_26]: But yeah, this is good.

1484
02:47:57,589 --> 02:47:58,169
[SPEAKER_26]: Got my support.

1485
02:47:58,630 --> 02:47:58,990
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1486
02:47:59,710 --> 02:48:05,233
[SPEAKER_26]: Say that on behalf of a bunch of us who were looking forward to this ordinance, this amendment very much.

1487
02:48:06,434 --> 02:48:06,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1488
02:48:06,754 --> 02:48:09,896
[SPEAKER_09]: I see one more comment in person.

1489
02:48:10,096 --> 02:48:11,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any more comments on Zoom?

1490
02:48:12,597 --> 02:48:13,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none.

1491
02:48:16,805 --> 02:48:18,506
[SPEAKER_00]: Barry Ingbern, 9 Draper Street.

1492
02:48:19,387 --> 02:48:35,256
[SPEAKER_00]: And just on behalf of Medford People Power, I'd like to thank President Bears for putting this resolution forward, and hope you all will support it.

1493
02:48:35,336 --> 02:48:36,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

1494
02:48:37,537 --> 02:48:37,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1495
02:48:37,917 --> 02:48:41,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any more comments from the public, either on Zoom or in person?

1496
02:48:45,171 --> 02:48:50,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, we have a motion on the floor from President Bears, seconded by Councilor Mullane.

1497
02:48:51,296 --> 02:48:52,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready.

1498
02:48:57,100 --> 02:48:57,821
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Callahan?

1499
02:48:57,841 --> 02:48:57,941
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1500
02:48:59,702 --> 02:49:00,823
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Lazzaro?

1501
02:49:01,424 --> 02:49:01,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1502
02:49:03,245 --> 02:49:03,965
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Leming?

1503
02:49:03,985 --> 02:49:05,467
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1504
02:49:05,487 --> 02:49:06,227
