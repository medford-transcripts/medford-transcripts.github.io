00:00:01,972 --> 00:00:03,373

This time I ask everyone to please rise to salute the flag.

21
00:00:33,136 --> 00:00:44,680
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

22
00:00:51,502 --> 00:00:51,822
Thank you.

23
00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:12,971

29
00:02:00,535 --> 00:02:10,882
20-420, offered by Vice President Caviello.

30
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:15,245
Whereas the City of Medford is in a fiscal budget emergency,

31
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:25,308
Be it resolved that the mayor be requested to appropriate with the city council approval the necessary amount of free cash to address the municipal in-school budget deficits.

32
00:02:25,628 --> 00:02:34,052
Be it further that the mayor be requested to replenish this account with any budget aid that it receives from the federal government or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

33
00:02:34,492 --> 00:02:39,735
Be it further resolved that the mayor respond to this request by next Tuesday's city council meeting.

34
00:02:42,206 --> 00:02:43,267
Thank you, Mr. President.

35
00:02:43,327 --> 00:02:55,156
Mr. President, I know this is a request that should be coming from the mayor, but I thought that it was appropriate that I put it out there this week in order to maybe speed the process up for the mayor.

36
00:02:56,137 --> 00:02:59,099
I was informed today that 130 teachers were let go.

37
00:03:02,412 --> 00:03:06,834
They were non-professionals, and these are difficult times.

38
00:03:07,614 --> 00:03:11,576
We do have a decent amount in free cash.

39
00:03:11,616 --> 00:03:30,503
I'm not recommending that you use the whole amount, but use an amount that she's deemed necessary in order to maybe save the jobs of some teachers and guidance counselors, because I think we've all started getting the emails from people about the layoffs of the children.

40
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:38,915
So Mr. President, and I also like to make one more statement for the viewing public.

41
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:43,182
The city council does not do the school committee budget.

42
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:53,551
Uh, the the budget is done by them only we've i've been getting emails from people saying that the city council has cut the jobs of teachers We do not do that.

43
00:03:54,031 --> 00:04:10,142
The budget comes from the school committee, uh that we haven't even seen yet So please understand the process to the people that are sending out emails school committee does their budget and submits it to us At which point we do not have the ability to add any funds to it.

44
00:04:10,502 --> 00:04:11,523
We can make suggestions

45
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:15,240
ability to cut funds out of the budget.

46
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:23,583
So I wanted people to understand that because the emails are starting to pour in, thinking that it's the city council that cut all these people's jobs and it wasn't.

47
00:04:24,124 --> 00:04:32,547
So, but again, I opened this up for discussion with my fellow councillors and maybe this will speed the process up for the mayor a little bit.

48
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,108
Thank you, Mr. President.

49
00:04:34,428 --> 00:04:35,588
Thank you, Vice President Carvajal.

50
00:04:35,628 --> 00:04:39,550
We have Councilor Scott Kelly, Councilor Morrell, Councilor Beers, Councilor Scott Kelly.

51
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:44,456
Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Councilor Carviello for bringing this forward.

52
00:04:44,476 --> 00:05:00,085
I know that to jump to my second piece, I did receive a bunch of emails that a school committee member sent out stating this year we are facing a $3.5 million budget

53
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:10,944
that the cuts are right now, the school committee and superintendent cannot direct city funding, only the mayor and the city council.

54
00:05:11,405 --> 00:05:22,873
So what's happening is people taking that comment, whichever way that school member meant to put that out there, the way that it's going out to the public is again, it's starting that divide.

55
00:05:23,974 --> 00:05:25,755
It's what's wrong with the city council?

56
00:05:26,196 --> 00:05:27,637
Why are you not funding these people?

57
00:05:28,543 --> 00:05:29,964
Why, what are you doing?

58
00:05:30,304 --> 00:05:30,964
We need this.

59
00:05:31,744 --> 00:05:39,788
So again, it's been a very difficult last couple of weeks, but I tell you what, this is where we do not have to go as a community.

60
00:05:40,728 --> 00:05:41,909
This is so disheartening.

61
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:47,431
I'm sorry, Councilor Falco, the One Medford, it's so farthest from the truth right now.

62
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:48,531
It's so disheartening.

63
00:05:48,872 --> 00:05:51,673
That's what I've heard for the last three nights especially.

64
00:05:52,293 --> 00:05:56,355
I'm telling you that please, maybe the city solicitor,

65
00:05:57,143 --> 00:06:10,388
can reach out to the mayor with a highlight of what the role of the city council is during the budget in comparison to the school department.

66
00:06:11,148 --> 00:06:18,031
Because I know when we were on the school committee, we were given a tutorial and we understood exactly what the process was.

67
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,152
Brings me to my first point.

68
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:26,194
In the late 1990s, early 2000s, I was given my pink slip as a teacher in the city of Medford.

69
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:31,098
It's probably the most devastating feeling you'll ever, ever feel.

70
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:33,059
It's a helpless feeling.

71
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,381
And I, too, are getting all the emails.

72
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:43,525
I have former colleagues calling me and relatives calling me and saying, George, what are we doing?

73
00:06:45,566 --> 00:06:51,150
We'll know more as soon as we start our process on Saturday, I believe.

74
00:06:52,027 --> 00:06:56,990
if you correct me from wrong, I believe we're starting our process on Saturday on the city side.

75
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:58,170
Correct.

76
00:06:58,691 --> 00:07:10,497
But I want people to understand, we as a council will do everything we can to make sure that we're supporting our colleagues in city government.

77
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:18,421
I think that as myself, I'm speaking for myself, but I have skin in the game like most of our councils here.

78
00:07:19,408 --> 00:07:23,171
We have children that are in the school system.

79
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:25,632
My son's a senior.

80
00:07:25,652 --> 00:07:31,656
When I found out today, one of the cuts is we do not have a head of guidance at Medford High School.

81
00:07:32,457 --> 00:07:33,417
To me, that's appalling.

82
00:07:34,498 --> 00:07:41,303
I think that's terrible, especially what we're seeing, what's going to happen as kids return back to school.

83
00:07:43,152 --> 00:07:53,139
with the COVID crisis and not having someone in that position to lead what needs to be led is to me a very, very slippery slope.

84
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:03,547
But again, again, I have to sit back as a counselor and look at this objectively and say, this is very difficult.

85
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:07,850
We're asking the school system to cut three and a half million dollars from a budget.

86
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:23,770
So everybody's, I've also gotten contact that, you know, I got one email saying that we drastically underfund the school system for years while the city gets fatter and fatter.

87
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:27,413
I don't know if it was meant literally, but I'm going to tell you something.

88
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:34,137
We haven't been, we are on, we are on a thin line when it comes to fire, police, DPW.

89
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:39,361
But we also will be looking at the same difficulties

90
00:08:40,344 --> 00:08:41,225
in the next few weeks.

91
00:08:42,586 --> 00:08:49,633
So I caution everybody to be alarmed, because I'm alarmed as a parent.

92
00:08:50,414 --> 00:08:54,158
As my former colleagues and friends, they're alarmed as teachers.

93
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,882
The word gets out to the children, they're alarmed.

94
00:08:57,922 --> 00:09:00,825
My children are alarmed from what they've heard some of the teachers that were cut.

95
00:09:01,685 --> 00:09:02,606
So what I'm saying is,

96
00:09:03,621 --> 00:09:04,723
Let's stay focused.

97
00:09:05,063 --> 00:09:19,203
Let's try to get through the next couple of weeks the best we can, not pitting each other against each other, and try to find a way that we can all work together and try to do the best we can in these trying, trying times.

98
00:09:20,098 --> 00:09:24,181
We're no different than Brookline or Winchester or Somerville.

99
00:09:24,422 --> 00:09:26,503
Everybody's cutting, everybody.

100
00:09:27,304 --> 00:09:38,353
And I know we're all waiting for the governor to come down and say, if the federal government's not gonna do it, I'm gonna pull a billion dollars out of the rainy day account, and I'm gonna fund education.

101
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:43,958
I'm gonna send funding right down to the cities and towns to bring them back.

102
00:09:44,378 --> 00:09:45,960
We can only hope, we can wish,

103
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,411
but that's a possibility.

104
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:59,519
But again, I'm gonna say it again, please, we've often had school commembers on this meeting in these falls.

105
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,923
I hope somebody's here so they can bring it back to their colleagues.

106
00:10:04,523 --> 00:10:09,787
Please do not scream the sky is falling and point fingers.

107
00:10:10,628 --> 00:10:13,590
Let's take a deep breath as a community

108
00:10:15,357 --> 00:10:21,318
find a way to bring it all together, working together to do what's best for our whole community.

109
00:10:22,218 --> 00:10:23,118
Thank you, Mr. President.

110
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:25,339
Thank you, Councilor Scott Kelly.

111
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,159
Councilor Morrell.

112
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:29,320
Thank you, Mr. President.

113
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,420
So I thank Vice President Caravella for bringing this forward, but I just have one concern with this.

114
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:43,162
So it was my understanding that at our most recent budget update, our independent auditor suggested that we use the free cash a certain amount, I think,

115
00:10:43,865 --> 00:10:46,265
$6 million or somewhere around there was referenced.

116
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:55,027
Obviously that's up to the mayor, but because we could get enough local receipts back to bring us back to the level we're at now and maintain our bond rating.

117
00:10:55,667 --> 00:11:11,770
So considering cuts are already being made that have been referenced and the fact that school will be much more expensive to run, it doesn't seem to me to be in the best interest of our city and our schools to then take any money we might get from a bailout and put that back into free cash.

118
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:35,250
I feel like because the independent auditor said we're able to get back up to a good level with the receipts coming in, that money that, you know, again, we don't know if this money is ever coming, but if it does come, that be put back in to make up for those cuts that are already happening and bring people on and secure people's jobs and make sure our school is prepared and our city services are prepared for this coming fall.

119
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:40,814
So unless it's amended, I can't vote for this at this point, just because I don't think

120
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:46,562
that taking that money and not applying it where it's most needed is the most prudent decision.

121
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:47,703
So thank you.

122
00:11:48,804 --> 00:11:49,764
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

123
00:11:50,885 --> 00:11:51,726
Councilor Beers.

124
00:11:52,626 --> 00:11:53,527
Thank you, Mr. President.

125
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,830
I thank everyone who's spoken so far.

126
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:03,934
I agree with Councilor Morrell's concern around that this money might be better used.

127
00:12:04,494 --> 00:12:05,955
I think one of the big concerns right now

128
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:13,466
is the average estimate for a school district to go back to school with all the COVID stuff is over a million and a half dollars.

129
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:15,206
I think that stands for Medford as well.

130
00:12:15,826 --> 00:12:19,348
So, we're in a bad place.

131
00:12:19,868 --> 00:12:22,409
We're cutting significant amounts from the budget.

132
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:31,072
I mean, as Councilor Morrell said, and I think as Councilor Carviella's motion is intended, the plan is already to cover the deficit with free cash.

133
00:12:31,713 --> 00:12:42,801
even with that in place, we're seeing big cuts and layoffs and positions that won't get filled and, you know, seniors who won't have guidance counselors, you know, head of guidance, I should say.

134
00:12:42,921 --> 00:12:46,864
So that's, you know, the free cash won't get us out of this.

135
00:12:47,444 --> 00:12:53,729
It's not enough to stop cuts on the school side or the city side, which are already in a desperate place.

136
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:57,011
So yeah, it's certainly, you know,

137
00:12:57,387 --> 00:12:59,328
We can't be making cuts like this right now.

138
00:12:59,388 --> 00:13:09,934
I know that we're in a difficult budget situation, but these are essential services and, you know, students are gonna need more, the city's gonna need more, and we're gonna be asking people to do more with less.

139
00:13:10,014 --> 00:13:12,775
And we know how that turns out and how that's turned out historically.

140
00:13:13,055 --> 00:13:16,897
So, you know, there's not enough free cash to fix this problem is my understanding.

141
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:17,718
I hope that changes.

142
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:20,759
Thank you, Councilor Piers.

143
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:22,180
Vice President Carvill.

144
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:27,294
You know, Mr. President, you know, Councillor Baird and Councillor Murdoch make good points.

145
00:13:27,654 --> 00:13:31,335
There's not enough money here to fix this problem.

146
00:13:31,675 --> 00:13:36,656
But again, we've already done our major borrowing for the City of Bedford.

147
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:45,559
So, I mean, the library's been funded, the police station's been funded, so there's no big borrowing projects currently on the horizon right now.

148
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:49,980
So, and let's say, money is at its lowest point ever.

149
00:13:53,168 --> 00:13:58,312
If this be the case, the mayor is only going to have to come to us and ask us for this money anyways.

150
00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:07,739
I'm trying to give her the leverage so she doesn't have to come to us at budget time.

151
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:14,485
I know she's talked about spending $6.5 million, but again, you're going to have to vote on this coming down the line.

152
00:14:15,837 --> 00:14:21,258
And if you say you're not going to vote for her because you don't have enough money, then I'm a little confused.

153
00:14:21,298 --> 00:14:24,599
But I'm looking to save as many jobs as I can.

154
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:28,320
And let me tell you, this is something I haven't supported in the past.

155
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,941
I voted against this myself in the past.

156
00:14:32,901 --> 00:14:35,522
But again, these are difficult times.

157
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:41,103
And I think we're doing the prudent thing going forward.

158
00:14:42,887 --> 00:14:43,508
for the time being.

159
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:46,971
And let's say any money comes in, should be replenished back into free cash.

160
00:14:48,051 --> 00:14:49,913
And the word free, it's the people's money.

161
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:51,034
It's not free.

162
00:14:51,114 --> 00:14:52,255
Nothing in this world is free.

163
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:59,821
So please don't, I don't know where that term ever came from, but it belongs to the residents of Medford and we should use it as we see fit.

164
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:02,403
So that's all I have to say, Mr. President, at the moment.

165
00:15:02,824 --> 00:15:04,005
Thank you, Vice President Carviello.

166
00:15:04,025 --> 00:15:05,886
We have Councilor Morrell and then Councilor Marks.

167
00:15:06,286 --> 00:15:06,827
Councilor Morrell.

168
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:08,244
Thank you, Mr. President.

169
00:15:08,264 --> 00:15:09,805
Yeah, I just wanted to clarify what I was saying.

170
00:15:09,845 --> 00:15:12,647
I'm not saying I'm going to vote against the mayor using free cash.

171
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:29,955
What I'm saying is the way this current resolution is written, the second part I do disagree with because I think if a federal bailout or a state level bailout or something comes down, that money should then be applied to the cuts that have already been made and to secure positions within the schools in the city.

172
00:15:30,015 --> 00:15:31,616
So that's where my level of disagreement is.

173
00:15:31,676 --> 00:15:32,937
I'm not going to vote against

174
00:15:33,424 --> 00:15:37,827
free cash, but just the way this resolution is written, I don't agree with the second part.

175
00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:39,128
So I just want to clarify that.

176
00:15:39,348 --> 00:15:39,848
So thank you.

177
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:41,309
Thank you, Councilor Merrill.

178
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:41,990
Councilor Marks.

179
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:59,141
Mr. President, also to clarify, the 6 point whatever it was, 2 or 3 million that the mayor did say she was going to take out of free cash does not change any of the circumstances which are currently taking place right now, which are the cuts within the city.

180
00:16:00,101 --> 00:16:00,921
and the school side.

181
00:16:01,481 --> 00:16:04,262
So anything else that happens would be in addition to that.

182
00:16:05,342 --> 00:16:09,403
So I think we've got to be mindful that six million brings us to where we are right now.

183
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:12,544
And many of us want to go further than that.

184
00:16:13,064 --> 00:16:16,425
But, you know, we're going to have to wait and see.

185
00:16:16,485 --> 00:16:18,166
I think it is a wait and see game right now.

186
00:16:18,506 --> 00:16:27,848
And I've been saying that for the last month and a half regarding local receipts and regarding, you know, hopefully some type of bailout and so forth.

187
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:30,108
So that's my hope, Mr. President.

188
00:16:30,469 --> 00:16:30,829
Thank you.

189
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:32,569
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

190
00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:35,490
Anybody else like to speak on this issue?

191
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:40,851
Okay, Clerk Cernovich, have you received any emails on this?

192
00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:45,852
I have not, Mr. President.

193
00:16:47,293 --> 00:16:49,933
Any other comments from the public?

194
00:16:50,894 --> 00:16:51,934
I have a comment, Mr. President.

195
00:16:52,194 --> 00:16:52,734
Oh, okay.

196
00:16:52,894 --> 00:16:53,814
I'm sorry, Councilor Knight?

197
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,115
I haven't heard anything for the last 20 minutes.

198
00:16:58,062 --> 00:17:00,463
All right, I'm having significant technical difficulties.

199
00:17:00,523 --> 00:17:02,243
I'm just sitting here looking at frozen screens.

200
00:17:02,303 --> 00:17:05,804
So again, I ask for your leadership moving forward to get us back into council chambers.

201
00:17:06,224 --> 00:17:06,945
I'm trying my best.

202
00:17:07,565 --> 00:17:09,565
So hopefully we'll have an update for you tomorrow.

203
00:17:13,486 --> 00:17:14,047
Can you hear us?

204
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:17,527
Somewhat, Mr. President, somewhat.

205
00:17:18,348 --> 00:17:19,028
Let's move to the question.

206
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:26,310
OK, on the motion of Vice President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

207
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:29,338
I got nothing to say.

208
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:30,959
Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

209
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:36,861
Seconded by... Does this resolution have a second?

210
00:17:38,382 --> 00:17:44,144
Mr. President, I'm uncomfortable seconding it, Mr. President, because I missed the whole entire presentation.

211
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:44,564
Mr. President.

212
00:17:48,386 --> 00:17:49,567
Councilor Marks.

213
00:17:50,047 --> 00:17:56,829
If I could, Mr. President, I know where Councilor Caviello, Vice President Caviello is coming from with this.

214
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:04,813
We were told a couple of weeks ago that the mayor was committing, I think it was 6.2 or 6.5 million from free cash.

215
00:18:05,393 --> 00:18:07,934
So I'm not quite sure what this resolution does.

216
00:18:09,094 --> 00:18:10,735
Only the mayor can appropriate

217
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:22,442
The council could not appropriate we can make recommendations So i'm not quite sure if this is just a feel-good type thing Um, and even then it doesn't feel good because the cuts are still taking place.

218
00:18:22,462 --> 00:18:26,705
Um, so I'm not i'm not quite sure what this actually does.

219
00:18:27,586 --> 00:18:39,854
Um, Vice president carriell, mr. President again, uh at some point the mayor will have to come to us for this money uh, but I I think that uh,

220
00:18:40,557 --> 00:18:47,426
If I'm hearing correctly, I don't know when she comes to us if we're going to support it.

221
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:57,198
Well, I think what Councilor Mark said, I mean, to me, the responsibility is of the mayor to come to us.

222
00:18:58,574 --> 00:18:59,494
I understand that.

223
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:00,495
I understand that.

224
00:19:01,195 --> 00:19:03,096
I understand what you're trying to do.

225
00:19:03,116 --> 00:19:04,416
You're trying to reach out.

226
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:12,819
But I mean, I think that the request has to come from the administration as to how they want to kind of bridge the gap.

227
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,140
Counselor Scarpelli would like to make a comment.

228
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,920
Counselor Scarpelli.

229
00:19:16,081 --> 00:19:20,402
If I can, I thank you, Mr. President and Vice President Caviello.

230
00:19:20,422 --> 00:19:25,244
I understand what you're saying, but I would, after we go through our process,

231
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:35,532
I would also support the mayor in looking at free cash to assist us in this financial dilemma.

232
00:19:35,552 --> 00:19:44,355
But I think right now, not knowing what's happening and to take from

233
00:19:45,032 --> 00:19:50,474
ask her to come back and take more with the negative ramifications, especially with our bond rating.

234
00:19:51,414 --> 00:19:52,275
I can't support this.

235
00:19:52,335 --> 00:20:00,078
I think that, you know, I at least want to sit through Saturday's meeting to see how bad, you know, how bad things look on the city side.

236
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:13,703
So that's the reason why I, not to say that I wouldn't support it moving forward, but right now, like I said, it's, we need to take a deep breath and hear all the sides and then figure this out.

237
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:14,862
Thank you.

238
00:20:15,323 --> 00:20:16,423
Thank you, Councilor Scott Pelley.

239
00:20:16,443 --> 00:20:17,144
Councilor Piers.

240
00:20:18,865 --> 00:20:20,546
Just a question for you, actually, Mr. President.

241
00:20:21,507 --> 00:20:22,587
What is the plan schedule?

242
00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:23,908
Just, you know, public's watching.

243
00:20:23,928 --> 00:20:24,989
We're talking about the debate.

244
00:20:25,009 --> 00:20:26,470
We're talking about our meeting Saturday.

245
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,651
What's our plan there?

246
00:20:27,671 --> 00:20:28,952
What's the schedule for those meetings?

247
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:33,495
So I did hear back from the chief of staff today.

248
00:20:34,055 --> 00:20:43,141
So I believe what we're going to do is meet on Saturday with, I think it's going to be police, fire, DPW, and then

249
00:20:45,274 --> 00:20:54,118
The next meeting will probably be probably next Monday and probably do committee on Tuesday and maybe next Wednesday.

250
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:57,840
I haven't kind of got that far yet as far as the scheduling piece goes.

251
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:02,854
As far as getting it to City Hall, I'm working on that as well.

252
00:21:03,254 --> 00:21:11,601
And as far as budget books, I've been told we should receive a budget book Thursday afternoon.

253
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:15,604
One of my concerns is if we don't get a budget book,

254
00:21:16,215 --> 00:21:26,624
until Thursday night, is that going to give the council enough time to review to take up police fire in DPW, which is kind of like the big three on Saturday.

255
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:28,365
So that's my concern.

256
00:21:28,385 --> 00:21:40,295
I'm kind of wrestling with whether or not, you know, if we don't get that budget book, I mean, I want to make sure to me, the way I look at it is this, especially if we're going to be looking at a budget, we want to make sure that the council has enough time

257
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:51,413
to look at the budget for those departments that we're going to meet with on Saturday to process the information and ask, you know, good questions and have a good, you know, truthful discussion.

258
00:21:51,994 --> 00:21:58,362
You know, if we get the budget book, you know, late, that's not going to be beneficial to anyone that's involved in this process.

259
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,203
Point of information, Mr. President.

260
00:22:00,223 --> 00:22:01,283
Point of information.

261
00:22:01,644 --> 00:22:06,206
Just so you know, to some of us, Thursday afternoon is the same as Thursday night.

262
00:22:06,766 --> 00:22:08,407
That happened to be working.

263
00:22:09,988 --> 00:22:11,789
So it's not much of a difference to me.

264
00:22:12,129 --> 00:22:14,170
That's still late in the game.

265
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:28,057
I appreciate you've been, of all people, you've been pushing for this for so long, but it really gives us very little time and such a pressing budget to take a look at it Thursday night and then Saturday morning, early Saturday morning.

266
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:29,519
And that's my concern.

267
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:33,080
So I, to be, to be honest with you, I apologize for interrupting.

268
00:22:33,721 --> 00:22:43,166
I don't know yet if that Saturday is going to be police fire and DPW that I think needs to probably be juggled around because of the, uh, the timing of the book.

269
00:22:43,366 --> 00:22:49,269
It doesn't really make sense to have three big departments, you know, and we have minimal time to review.

270
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:53,491
So, so I completely hear what you're saying.

271
00:22:53,511 --> 00:22:53,851
Thank you.

272
00:22:54,452 --> 00:22:56,393
Just, just for the folks watching.

273
00:22:56,453 --> 00:22:56,553
So.

274
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:04,982
keep an eye out that, you know, at least as early as Saturday and certainly next week, they're going to be multiple budget meetings held by the council.

275
00:23:05,883 --> 00:23:12,385
And, um, is the Saturday up in the air still maybe, maybe not, or should people really be preparing for that?

276
00:23:12,785 --> 00:23:13,805
All right.

277
00:23:14,806 --> 00:23:14,986
Good.

278
00:23:15,206 --> 00:23:15,746
And just, yeah.

279
00:23:15,846 --> 00:23:20,988
And will that be, that'll be public online as well on, on the team.

280
00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:22,208
It's all public all the time.

281
00:23:22,648 --> 00:23:22,808
Yeah.

282
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:27,530
Just wanted to make sure Saturday, Saturday morning cartoons.

283
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,263
So when will the budget book be available for the general public?

284
00:23:31,283 --> 00:23:32,124
That's another good question.

285
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:35,408
I assume when we get it on Thursday, that an electronic copy would go as well.

286
00:23:52,525 --> 00:24:08,845
If it's not the case, Mr. President, it's incumbent upon us not to have the meeting on Saturday because I don't think it's fair if we're the only ones that have access to a budget book and then we're inviting the general public to participate and they have no access to the budget.

287
00:24:10,386 --> 00:24:11,427
So that's not fair either.

288
00:24:11,467 --> 00:24:21,616
So I would say this should be a wait and see, Mr. President, before we set up the date, because that budget book has to be available to everyone in the community, as well as the council.

289
00:24:22,197 --> 00:24:22,697
Correct.

290
00:24:23,718 --> 00:24:25,299
Let's see, we get a number of questions.

291
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:25,520
Yes.

292
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,963
So we have Councilor Knight, Vice President Caviello, Councilor Knight.

293
00:24:30,127 --> 00:24:34,132
Yes, Mr. President, I think we've taken the wait-and-see approach for quite a bit of time.

294
00:24:34,813 --> 00:24:40,280
We have 14 days left before our budget expires, before the close of the fiscal year.

295
00:24:41,101 --> 00:24:42,042
We've been very patient.

296
00:24:42,182 --> 00:24:46,207
We've been calling for this budget now for the better part of six months.

297
00:24:46,888 --> 00:24:48,390
We had a commitment that we were going to get it.

298
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,450
We haven't gotten it.

299
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,011
I don't understand why.

300
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,431
We have a consultant that's given us forecasted revenues.

301
00:24:55,432 --> 00:24:59,393
The consultant we're paying money for to do this is the advice that we should be listening to.

302
00:25:00,093 --> 00:25:04,554
So with that being said, Mr. President, I'm very disappointed that we haven't been able to get this budget book.

303
00:25:04,594 --> 00:25:06,895
I know it's no reflection of your leadership, Mr. President.

304
00:25:06,915 --> 00:25:08,035
It's a reflection of the corner office.

305
00:25:09,015 --> 00:25:12,176
And I'm very concerned about the direction this community is going in financially.

306
00:25:12,976 --> 00:25:16,097
I echo some of the concerns that my colleagues have made relative to

307
00:25:16,737 --> 00:25:20,479
the lack of understanding of the school budget process that's going on by some of our elected officials.

308
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:27,043
So with that being said, Mr. President, it's going to be very important that we get in there and sit down in a room where we can all work this out.

309
00:25:27,723 --> 00:25:33,166
So with that being said, I echo some of the sentiments of my council colleagues, but we need to get this thing moving.

310
00:25:33,267 --> 00:25:35,488
And if the administration doesn't want to participate, that's sad.

311
00:25:36,088 --> 00:25:43,892
But we need to start calling department heads in and start talking to them about what their needs are, whether or not the administration's ready to provide us with money or not, numbers or not.

312
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,333
It's time, Mr. President.

313
00:25:45,353 --> 00:25:47,013
It's time to address the elephant in the room.

314
00:25:48,334 --> 00:25:49,154
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

315
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,155
Vice President Caviello?

316
00:25:50,655 --> 00:25:54,517
Mr. President, I make a motion to withdraw my resolution this evening.

317
00:25:54,957 --> 00:25:55,237
Okay.

318
00:25:57,158 --> 00:25:58,459
So the, let's see.

319
00:25:58,479 --> 00:26:00,180
So, Clerk Arnabis?

320
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,761
It has to be disposed of.

321
00:26:02,301 --> 00:26:03,281
It's been introduced.

322
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:04,402
Yeah, it's been introduced.

323
00:26:05,348 --> 00:26:09,712
Okay, so it's been introduced, so we want to receive it and place it on file?

324
00:26:10,893 --> 00:26:11,113
Fine.

325
00:26:12,775 --> 00:26:13,155
That's fine.

326
00:26:14,236 --> 00:26:14,496
Okay.

327
00:26:15,317 --> 00:26:16,738
Thank you.

328
00:26:17,219 --> 00:26:24,605
On the motion of Vice President Cardiello, seconded by Councilor Beas, to receive and place on file.

329
00:26:27,748 --> 00:26:28,709
You ready for the roll call?

00:26:29,149 --> 00:26:30,030

00:26:55,913 --> 00:26:56,233

349
00:26:56,894 --> 00:26:58,655
Councilor Marks, Clerk Urnaby, please call the roll.

350
00:26:59,556 --> 00:27:02,238
The purpose being Mr. President, no, I'm sorry, I didn't know.

00:27:02,258 --> 00:27:03,859
Go ahead.

352
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:09,984
The purpose being to call paper 20435 and 20436 out of order, financial papers, communications from the mayor.

353
00:27:11,245 --> 00:27:11,685
Okay.

354
00:27:11,726 --> 00:27:13,667
Councilor Behrs?

355
00:27:14,147 --> 00:27:14,388
Yes.

356
00:27:15,168 --> 00:27:16,029

00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:18,691
Yes.

360
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:19,872
Councilor Marks?

361
00:27:20,512 --> 00:27:20,792

369
00:27:35,623 --> 00:27:39,846

370
00:27:40,146 --> 00:27:53,274
Dear Mr. President and City Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body approve a recommendation of the Community Preservation Committee, the Community Preservation Fund Revenues in the amount of $1,746,400.

371
00:27:53,535 --> 00:27:58,158
In addition, I respectfully request that your Honorable Body approve our recommendation

372
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:09,723
On recommendation of the Community Preservation Committee, the Community Preservation Fund expenditures in the amount of $1,746,400 as follows.

373
00:28:09,743 --> 00:28:10,103
Open space, $174,640.

374
00:28:10,143 --> 00:28:10,543
Community housing, $174,640.

375
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:11,364
Historic preservation, $174,640.

376
00:28:11,404 --> 00:28:12,164
Administration, $87,320.

377
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:32,778
remainder $1,135,160 for a total of $1,746,400.

378
00:28:32,938 --> 00:28:34,198
Sincerely, Brianna Longo, current mayor.

379
00:28:34,218 --> 00:28:35,179
Let's see, Councilor Knight.

380
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:57,453
Yes, Mr. President, we do have our – Danielle Evans from the Office of Community Development here this evening.

381
00:28:57,873 --> 00:29:12,301
It might be helpful if she provided us with a breakdown of the paper, but it's my understanding that annually we need to appropriate no less than 10 percent of the total CPA revenues to the appropriate category for which they're dedicated, and I do believe that this paper is

382
00:29:14,407 --> 00:29:19,470
The goal of this paper is to comply with that, but I'd like to hear from Danielle from OCD, please.

383
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,291
Motion for approval, Mr. President.

384
00:29:21,311 --> 00:29:28,654
Okay, we're gonna hear from Danielle first, and then we'll approve the paper.

385
00:29:28,674 --> 00:29:30,415
Danielle Evans, let's see.

386
00:29:30,816 --> 00:29:32,076
I'm going to unmute you.

387
00:29:32,096 --> 00:29:35,298
Danielle.

388
00:29:35,985 --> 00:29:39,226
Good evening, Danielle Evans, community preservation coordinator.

389
00:29:40,606 --> 00:29:45,828
I believe that Alicia is the one that submitted this, but I can definitely speak on behalf of it.

390
00:29:46,428 --> 00:30:00,452
Yes, this is the statutory minimums, the 10% to the three program categories, 5% that can go to admin, and then the rest goes to the general reserve.

391
00:30:03,974 --> 00:30:07,277
actually get to the funding round where decisions are made on projects.

392
00:30:08,138 --> 00:30:23,811
That gives us the most flexibility to fund projects that might not necessarily be even split, or just having to move from the different categories.

393
00:30:23,851 --> 00:30:28,074
We never know what kind of projects we're gonna get.

394
00:30:28,094 --> 00:30:29,796
Second Councilor Muck's motion, Mr. President.

395
00:30:30,297 --> 00:30:30,919
Thank you, Daniel.

396
00:30:30,939 --> 00:30:34,247
On the motion of Councilor Harris, seconded by Councilor Knight.

397
00:30:36,353 --> 00:30:37,416
Roberta Cameron.

398
00:30:37,817 --> 00:30:38,158
Roberta.

399
00:30:39,878 --> 00:30:40,278
Thank you.

400
00:30:41,459 --> 00:31:01,907
As you mentioned, this is just the annual appropriation that needs to be made, but I also wanted to let the council know that we have prepared an annual report that reports on our activities from the past year and projects what we have learned that our community needs are for the coming year.

401
00:31:02,447 --> 00:31:09,771
So I would invite the council to find that report or people watching this to find that report on the Community Preservation Committee's website.

402
00:31:10,192 --> 00:31:15,475
And I would also be happy to send a copy to the councilors if you would appreciate that.

403
00:31:16,155 --> 00:31:20,798
And to let people know that the funding round is open for the coming year.

404
00:31:22,263 --> 00:31:37,187
So for people who would like to apply for CPA funds using the 2020 funds, that application can now be accessed by the Community Preservation Committee's website, and they can contact Danielle Evans for more information.

405
00:31:38,547 --> 00:31:38,988
Thank you.

406
00:31:39,408 --> 00:31:40,108
Thank you, Roberta.

407
00:31:40,888 --> 00:31:43,509
On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight.

408
00:31:44,489 --> 00:31:45,929
Clerk, please call the roll.

409
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,350
Councilor Behrs.

410
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:48,582
Yes.

411
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:50,284
Vice President Caraballo?

412
00:31:50,404 --> 00:31:50,644
Yes.

413
00:31:51,144 --> 00:31:51,665
Councilor Knight?

414
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:52,405
Yes.

415
00:31:52,946 --> 00:31:53,546
Councilor Marks?

416
00:31:53,986 --> 00:31:54,287
Yes.

417
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:55,408
Councilor Morrell?

418
00:31:56,008 --> 00:31:56,288
Yes.

419
00:31:56,829 --> 00:31:57,589
Councilor Scarpelli?

420
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:58,270
Yes.

421
00:31:58,690 --> 00:31:59,451
President Falco?

422
00:32:00,011 --> 00:32:02,113
Yes, Senator, the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

423
00:32:04,203 --> 00:32:10,128
20-436 to the Honorable President and members of the Memphis City Council, City Hall, Memphis, Massachusetts, 02155.

424
00:32:10,348 --> 00:32:21,617
Dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves a supplemental appropriation in the amount of $9,050.35 from premium reserved account 124-145-5971

425
00:32:33,303 --> 00:32:39,824
0000000904 to the General Fund Debt Service Account 010-710-5910.

426
00:32:39,944 --> 00:32:48,226
Alicia Nunleaf Benjamin, Finance Director, is present to answer any of the councilor's questions regarding this matter.

427
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:50,586
Sincerely, Brianna Longo, current mayor.

428
00:32:52,907 --> 00:32:53,947
Let's see.

429
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:57,308
Alicia.

430
00:32:58,996 --> 00:33:00,057
Good evening, counselors.

431
00:33:00,977 --> 00:33:05,481
I submitted this paper because we have some interest due on a band.

432
00:33:06,341 --> 00:33:08,383
And that band actually sold at a premium of that $9,050.35.

433
00:33:08,943 --> 00:33:19,011
And the Massachusetts Municipal Modernization Act that was passed back in 2016 allows for that premium to be used to pay against the debt service.

434
00:33:19,051 --> 00:33:28,298
So what I do is I take the premium, I put it in a receipt, and then whenever I have debt service to pay off, I'm going to come before your honorable body to use any premium to pay the debt service down.

435
00:33:31,723 --> 00:33:32,824
Any questions from the council?

436
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:34,865
Move approval, Mr. President.

437
00:33:35,345 --> 00:33:35,986
Second.

438
00:33:36,486 --> 00:33:37,406
Question, Mr. President?

439
00:33:37,607 --> 00:33:38,607
Yes, Councilor Marks.

440
00:33:40,368 --> 00:33:42,389
This is kind of new to me.

441
00:33:42,469 --> 00:33:43,790
Have we done this in the past?

442
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:50,014
In the past, what they used to do was just apply it and just do it themselves without bringing it before you.

443
00:33:50,114 --> 00:33:54,877
But I'm putting it in receipts reserved for account and coming before you to keep it in a transparent manner.

444
00:33:56,482 --> 00:34:00,765
So it does sound unique, and that's why, because it was never presented to us.

445
00:34:01,265 --> 00:34:03,006
Yeah, this is a new fund I just created.

446
00:34:03,026 --> 00:34:06,088
I second the motion, Mr. President.

447
00:34:06,849 --> 00:34:07,850
All right, let's see.

448
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:15,235
So on the motion of Councilor Knight, I believe Vice President Cabrillo originally seconded it.

449
00:34:16,055 --> 00:34:17,756
I third it.

450
00:34:17,896 --> 00:34:20,818
Okay, thirded by Councilor Muntz.

451
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,380
Any questions from the Council?

452
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,501
Any questions from the public?

453
00:34:26,907 --> 00:34:28,288
Okay, seeing and hearing none.

454
00:34:28,648 --> 00:34:29,788
Clerk, please call the roll.

455
00:34:31,189 --> 00:34:31,749
Councilor Behrs?

456
00:34:32,509 --> 00:34:32,789
Yes.

457
00:34:33,289 --> 00:34:34,270
Vice President Caravaglia?

458
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:34,830
Yes.

459
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:35,810
Councilor Knight?

460
00:34:38,891 --> 00:34:40,412
He's having troubles, I believe, again.

461
00:34:40,432 --> 00:34:42,193
Okay.

462
00:34:42,273 --> 00:34:42,833
Councilor Marks?

463
00:34:43,473 --> 00:34:43,693
Yes.

464
00:34:44,353 --> 00:34:44,994
Councilor Morrell?

465
00:34:45,594 --> 00:34:45,854
Yes.

466
00:34:47,214 --> 00:34:48,035
Councilor Scarpelli?

467
00:34:49,235 --> 00:34:49,615
Yes.

468
00:34:52,536 --> 00:34:53,317
President Falco?

469
00:34:53,897 --> 00:34:54,077
Yes.

470
00:34:54,795 --> 00:34:56,937
And I've got Councilor Nye, I can see him, can you?

471
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:00,561
You sound like you're underwater, but it's a yes vote.

472
00:35:00,982 --> 00:35:01,742
Thank you.

473
00:35:02,864 --> 00:35:05,647
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

474
00:35:06,728 --> 00:35:08,009
Thank you.

475
00:35:08,029 --> 00:35:08,670
Thank you, councilors.

476
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,314
Is there a motion to revert?

477
00:35:12,334 --> 00:35:13,835
Before we do that, Mr. President.

478
00:35:18,468 --> 00:35:19,689
That's all, Marks.

479
00:35:19,769 --> 00:35:20,409
Thank you, Mr. Pruitt.

480
00:35:20,429 --> 00:35:23,131
While we're under suspension, I just want to give my colleagues an update.

481
00:35:24,031 --> 00:35:32,636
About four or five weeks ago, I presented to the council, which was unanimously supported regarding the intersection of Salton Main Street.

482
00:35:33,296 --> 00:35:36,378
And during my presentation, I mentioned that I was waiting to get

483
00:35:37,238 --> 00:35:41,500
feedback from Chief Buckley regarding the number of accidents at that location.

484
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:49,563
And if you would indulge me for about 30 seconds, I just want to give you the update to the members of the council.

485
00:35:50,743 --> 00:36:00,667
Chief Buckley looked at two areas of significance that was shown on the accident map, one being Maine and Salt Street.

486
00:36:01,247 --> 00:36:05,431
and the other being the surrounding area around Wellington Circle.

487
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:10,675
Between the year of 2017 and 2020, there were 139 accidents reported at the area of Main and Salt Street.

488
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:14,138
And at Wellington Circle, between that same period, there were 202 accidents, Mr. President.

489
00:36:24,487 --> 00:36:51,972
Um, and as you can imagine wellington has many feeder roads that go into wellington circle as well as several routes that run through wellington circle And if you notice the number of accidents, uh, very close in nature, mr President and I think it uh speaks volumes to what we need to do at the corner of salt and maine um, and I just wanted to Uh present that information to my colleagues and I appreciate for you indulging me

490
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:54,460
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

491
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,101
Motion to revert back to the regular business, Mr. President.

492
00:36:57,201 --> 00:36:58,462
We're under suspension, Mr. President.

493
00:36:59,142 --> 00:37:03,244
Motion to revert back to the regular business, seconded by Councilor Knight.

494
00:37:03,624 --> 00:37:04,485
Oh, Councilor Knight.

495
00:37:05,605 --> 00:37:15,010
I actually, Mr. President, I'm having a difficult time, so I just wanted to table papers 2-0-4-2-1, 2-0-4-2-3, and 2-0-4-2-5.

496
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:21,053
Because of my connection, you know, I don't want to present a paper that you guys can hear me or that I can't hear you.

497
00:37:21,613 --> 00:37:22,974
So I'd like to table those till next week.

498
00:37:25,464 --> 00:37:29,547
So 20421, 20423, and 20425?

499
00:37:30,968 --> 00:37:31,869
That's correct, Mr. President.

500
00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:39,835
Okay, on the motion of Councilor Knight, to table 20421, 20423, and 20425, seconded by?

Councilor Behrs, Clerk, please call the roll.

504
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,500
Councilor Behrs.

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,982
These will be tabled till next week.

506
00:37:50,323 --> 00:37:50,483
Yes.

507
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:54,979
It's certain I'll put them back on the agenda for next week if you tabled them tonight.

508
00:37:55,919 --> 00:37:56,800
Yes, thank you.

509
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,200
That's a bears.

510
00:37:58,921 --> 00:37:59,201
Yes.

511
00:37:59,721 --> 00:38:00,861
Mr. President carry yellow.

512
00:38:01,061 --> 00:38:01,301
Yes.

513
00:38:01,942 --> 00:38:02,422
That's a night.

514
00:38:03,102 --> 00:38:03,502
Yes.

515
00:38:04,163 --> 00:38:04,743
That's a marks.

516
00:38:05,623 --> 00:38:05,963
Yes.

517
00:38:06,603 --> 00:38:07,264
That's a morale.

518
00:38:07,844 --> 00:38:08,104
Yes.

519
00:38:08,684 --> 00:38:09,504
That's a scrap belly.

520
00:38:09,945 --> 00:38:10,165
Yes.

521
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:12,966
Wasn't a Falco motion passes and those suspension Mr. President.

522
00:38:13,006 --> 00:38:14,326
Confidentiality suspension.

523
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:23,247
At this moment, Mr. President, I'd like to withdraw paper 20424 and paper 20427.

524
00:38:24,328 --> 00:38:26,510
Both questions have been asked and answered by the administration.

525
00:38:30,552 --> 00:38:35,895
Okay, 20424 and 20427 are both withdrawn.

526
00:38:36,336 --> 00:38:39,098
Okay.

527
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,099
Thank you, Councilor Layton.

528
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:45,942
On the motion of Vice President Carviello, seconded by

529
00:38:48,115 --> 00:38:51,276
Councilor Scarpelli to revert back to the regular order of business.

530
00:38:51,556 --> 00:38:52,636
Clerk, please call the roll.

531
00:38:57,878 --> 00:38:58,398
Councilor Behrs?

532
00:38:59,138 --> 00:38:59,418
Yes.

533
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:00,858
Vice President Caravaglia?

534
00:39:01,118 --> 00:39:01,359
Yes.

535
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:03,759
Councilor Knight?

536
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,100
Yes.

537
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:07,700
Councilor Marks?

538
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:08,500
Yes.

539
00:39:08,941 --> 00:39:09,621
Councilor Morrell?

540
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:10,421
Yes.

541
00:39:11,621 --> 00:39:12,461
Councilor Scarpelli?

542
00:39:12,882 --> 00:39:13,142
Yes.

543
00:39:13,542 --> 00:39:14,202
President Falco?

544
00:39:14,788 --> 00:39:16,749
Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

545
00:39:16,769 --> 00:39:18,630
We will now revert to the regular order of business.

546
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:20,571
Let's see.

547
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:34,440
2-0-422 offered by Councilor Knight be it resolved that the Memphis City Council hold a moment of silence for those service members of our greatest generation who made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of freedom on June 6th, 1944.

548
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:34,980
Councilor Knight.

549
00:39:41,242 --> 00:39:42,802
Mr. President, thank you very much.

550
00:39:43,903 --> 00:39:59,747
As we all know, June 6th is the anniversary of D-Day, where many of the young children of the Greatest Generation stormed beaches over in France and fought against the axis of evil to

551
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:06,293
make a commitment to freedom, Mr. President.

552
00:40:06,974 --> 00:40:26,245
So with that being said, I think it's very important that we recognize the sacrifices that were made by the young men and women during the D-Day invasion and during World War II, and also recognize the fact that the Greatest Generation is something that we should emulate and try to model ourselves upon, especially now during these difficult and trying times that we're facing.

553
00:40:26,802 --> 00:40:35,346
So with that being said, I asked my council colleagues to support the resolution and offering a moment of silence for those that were involved in the D-Day invasions.

554
00:40:36,607 --> 00:40:37,467
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

555
00:40:39,288 --> 00:40:42,970
Any other comments on this resolution?

556
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:47,012
Okay, on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by?

557
00:40:47,472 --> 00:40:48,312
Second, Mr. President.

558
00:40:48,792 --> 00:40:50,653
Seconded by Vice President Carvillo.

559
00:40:50,733 --> 00:40:51,774
Clerk Urbis, please call the roll.

560
00:40:55,436 --> 00:40:55,976
Councilor Bares.

561
00:40:57,172 --> 00:40:57,412
Yes.

562
00:40:58,033 --> 00:40:58,954
Vice President Caravaglia?

563
00:40:59,234 --> 00:40:59,474
Yes.

564
00:41:03,057 --> 00:41:04,078
Councilor Neill?

565
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:06,540
Yes.

566
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:07,420
Thank you.

567
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:08,401
Councilor Marks?

568
00:41:09,042 --> 00:41:09,362
Yes.

569
00:41:09,903 --> 00:41:10,523
Councilor Morrell?

570
00:41:11,244 --> 00:41:11,504
Yes.

571
00:41:11,924 --> 00:41:12,725
Councilor Scarpelli?

572
00:41:13,265 --> 00:41:13,505
Yes.

573
00:41:13,886 --> 00:41:14,646
President Falco?

574
00:41:15,547 --> 00:41:17,469
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

575
00:41:17,489 --> 00:41:19,110
The motion passes at this point in time.

576
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:22,173
I'd ask everyone to please rise for a brief moment of silence.

577
00:41:29,741 --> 00:41:30,001
Thank you.

578
00:42:02,279 --> 00:42:06,380
20-426 offered by Vice President Carviello and Councilor Knight.

579
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:14,122
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council extends its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Brian Rabbitt on his recent passing.

580
00:42:15,203 --> 00:42:16,183
Vice President Carviello.

581
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,483
Thank you, Mr. President.

582
00:42:19,744 --> 00:42:21,584
Another sad passing in our city.

583
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:31,147
I knew the Rabbitt family for many, many years, and it was a shame to watch him suffer over the last few years the way he had.

584
00:42:31,993 --> 00:42:38,601
I just wanted to offer my condolences to the Roberts family and his children on his passing.

585
00:42:38,702 --> 00:42:40,223
I refer you to Councillor NAICC.

586
00:42:48,798 --> 00:42:50,720
Mr. President, thank you very much.

587
00:42:51,560 --> 00:43:02,590
I had the great opportunity of meeting Brian Rabbitt back when I was playing Pop Warner for his father, Jack Rabbitt, and his brother, Jimmy, as my coaches on the A squad as a young kid.

588
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:09,335
And I also had the pleasure of representing him as his business agent and union rep when I worked for the union.

589
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:11,717
And over the years, we've been able to develop a great friendship.

590
00:43:12,237 --> 00:43:17,121
And I think it's very important, Mr. President, that we point out, any time

591
00:43:18,045 --> 00:43:21,407
that you turn on the water in your house, you should thank Brian Rabbit.

592
00:43:21,447 --> 00:43:22,368
Think of Brian Rabbit.

593
00:43:22,968 --> 00:43:30,293
Every time that you run the dishwasher, every time that you take a shower, every time that you get a drink of water, you should think of Brian Rabbit.

594
00:43:31,014 --> 00:43:37,438
Every time you see a fire department, attach a hose to that fire hydrant outside your house, you should thank Brian Rabbit.

595
00:43:37,558 --> 00:43:44,744
because he spent the better part of the last three decades, Mr. President, in the trenches doing the dirty work, the stuff that people don't get credit for.

596
00:43:45,445 --> 00:43:51,130
Brian was one hell of a worker, probably the hottest working man in show business when it came to DPW staff.

597
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:56,995
There wasn't never a time that I saw him that he wasn't either going to or coming from work.

598
00:43:57,455 --> 00:44:03,422
The guy was constantly working, constantly covered in mud and dust and dirt from being in those trenches.

599
00:44:03,662 --> 00:44:05,744
And he's going to be sadly missed, Mr. President.

600
00:44:05,804 --> 00:44:09,308
Not only was he a good friend, but he was a great asset and a great public servant.

601
00:44:09,848 --> 00:44:11,770
And I offer my condolences to the family.

602
00:44:12,851 --> 00:44:15,174
Thank you, Counselor Knight.

603
00:44:16,355 --> 00:44:16,976
Counselor Marks.

604
00:44:17,853 --> 00:44:18,854
Thank you, Mr. President.

605
00:44:18,874 --> 00:44:20,955
I want to thank my colleagues for putting this on.

606
00:44:21,715 --> 00:44:24,476
What Councilor Knight just mentioned about Brian sums it up.

607
00:44:25,477 --> 00:44:27,138
He kept our infrastructure going.

608
00:44:28,018 --> 00:44:37,663
Think about it, a system that's 150 years old with pipes that are actually made out of wood, some of our old water pipes, Mr. President.

609
00:44:38,763 --> 00:44:43,946
He was a man that kept the infrastructure going, never questioned his job.

610
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,187
When there was a leak at two in the morning, three in the

611
00:44:48,404 --> 00:44:52,665
You'd see Brian Rabbit's head hanging out of the hole in the middle of the street, Mr. President.

612
00:44:53,025 --> 00:44:55,366
That was the type of dedication he had.

613
00:44:56,266 --> 00:45:09,090
And then, Mr. President, you had someone that fought an illness, a devastating illness, for many years and never said, woe is me, always had a smile, a good word to say, and he will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

614
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:11,551
I thank my colleagues for putting this on.

615
00:45:12,031 --> 00:45:13,111
Thank you, Counselor Marks.

616
00:45:14,352 --> 00:45:15,172
Counselor Scott Kelly.

617
00:45:18,717 --> 00:45:19,878
Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

618
00:45:20,098 --> 00:45:22,138
Um, just to follow up.

619
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:31,002
I know that my fellow counselors talked about, uh, Mr. Rabbit and glowing terms, but again, I, I'd have to share those same sentiments.

620
00:45:31,202 --> 00:45:45,128
Um, he was someone who kept the city going and people want to know if everything's so difficult and numbers are so, so limited employment here, DPW, how do they make it work?

621
00:45:45,985 --> 00:45:48,346
people like Mr. Rabbit is the reason why it works.

622
00:45:48,366 --> 00:45:54,728
Like Councilor Knight and Councilor Mox said, he's the guy in the hole.

623
00:45:56,448 --> 00:46:02,070
And he's the one that's always coming out dirty, making sure that everything works properly.

624
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:07,892
I saw him a few months back here right on Butler Street and he was, you know,

625
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:14,193
digging right in there and going to work and making sure my neighbors had their water, just had a newborn.

626
00:46:14,253 --> 00:46:19,514
And he worked diligently to make sure that everybody was happy.

627
00:46:19,594 --> 00:46:21,715
So it's a sad day.

628
00:46:21,815 --> 00:46:28,976
It's a sad day because, you know, I remember going to his time and the amount of people that were there and the impact he made on people.

629
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,557
And I know, Mayor,

630
00:46:33,308 --> 00:46:42,532
I believe Mayor Burke named the date after him in his honor, so he deserves everything he gets.

631
00:46:42,572 --> 00:46:53,857
He fought the battle hard, and his family should be proud in that he taught them how to live with dignity in this very difficult time.

632
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:57,299
So God bless him and wish his family luck.

633
00:46:57,319 --> 00:46:58,019
So thank you.

634
00:46:58,619 --> 00:46:59,940
Thank you, Councilor Scott Kelly.

635
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:05,643
And if I may, I had only met Brian a few times, and he's a very nice guy.

636
00:47:06,904 --> 00:47:14,268
But the things that I always heard about him was how he was so dedicated to what he did, his work, and to our community for so many years.

637
00:47:14,948 --> 00:47:17,650
And he was just an all-around great guy.

638
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:25,855
So our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and his friends, and we thank him for his many years of service to our community.

639
00:47:28,548 --> 00:47:32,030
who was someone who had a hand up, he thought that wanted to speak, maybe, maybe not.

640
00:47:34,532 --> 00:47:40,676
Okay, on the motion of, let's see, Councilor, Vice President Caviello and Councilor Knight.

641
00:47:40,696 --> 00:47:45,960
Mr. President, if we could dedicate this meeting in the memory of Brian Rabbit.

642
00:47:46,821 --> 00:47:47,341
Absolutely.

643
00:47:47,621 --> 00:47:48,181
Thank you.

644
00:47:48,642 --> 00:47:49,102
Thank you.

645
00:47:49,903 --> 00:47:55,647
On the motion of, let's see, Vice President Caviello and Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks.

646
00:47:57,013 --> 00:48:00,656
and also that we dedicate this meeting in Brian Rappaport's honor.

647
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:02,478
Clerk, please call the roll.

648
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:04,260
Councilor Behrs?

649
00:48:05,381 --> 00:48:05,601
Yes.

650
00:48:06,642 --> 00:48:07,523
Vice President Caraballo?

651
00:48:07,823 --> 00:48:08,043
Yes.

652
00:48:08,864 --> 00:48:09,364
Councilor Knight?

653
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:12,187
Yes.

654
00:48:12,948 --> 00:48:13,528
Councilor Marks?

655
00:48:13,909 --> 00:48:14,209
Yes.

656
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:15,490
Councilor Morrell?

657
00:48:16,051 --> 00:48:16,291
Yes.

658
00:48:17,392 --> 00:48:18,213
Councilor Scarpelli?

659
00:48:18,693 --> 00:48:18,914
Yes.

660
00:48:19,414 --> 00:48:20,055
President Falco?

661
00:48:21,016 --> 00:48:22,537
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

662
00:48:22,937 --> 00:48:24,298
The motion passes at this point.

663
00:48:24,378 --> 00:48:27,119
I'm gonna ask everyone to please rise for a brief moment of silence.

664
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:48,810
Thank you.

665
00:48:57,152 --> 00:49:18,725
Okay, 20-428 offered by Councilor Knight, be it so resolved that the City Clerk issue a report to the Council providing a list of all Board and Commission appointments under the purview of the Council, including, but not limited to, name of the Council appointee, date of appointment, length of term, and expiration date of current Council appointees in these positions.

666
00:49:19,266 --> 00:49:19,786
Councilor Knight.

667
00:49:25,343 --> 00:49:27,743
Mr. President, thank you very much.

668
00:49:28,043 --> 00:49:30,864
I think this resolution is rather self-explanatory.

669
00:49:31,644 --> 00:49:53,488
What it is is a request for the city clerk to just chronicle who it is that's been appointed to city council appointments, when they were appointed, what their expiration date is, and whether or not we need to move forward with renewals or an open application process to solicit new applicants, or maybe offer some opportunity to create some new voices in the community.

670
00:49:54,048 --> 00:50:00,589
So with that being said, Mr. President, I thank you for entertaining this resolution.

671
00:50:01,389 --> 00:50:03,990
Again, I do apologize for the technical difficulties.

672
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:08,591
So with that being said, I'd ask for a council colleague to second the motion.

673
00:50:08,611 --> 00:50:09,351
I second the motion.

674
00:50:09,951 --> 00:50:13,032
On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

675
00:50:13,072 --> 00:50:14,392
Clerk Bernabeu, please call the roll.

676
00:50:14,772 --> 00:50:19,813
Actually, if I may, before you call the roll, are there any questions from the council or the public on this motion?

677
00:50:21,998 --> 00:50:23,819
I have no emails on this topic, Mr. President.

678
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:24,679
Thank you.

679
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:26,940
We have a hand up here.

680
00:50:28,501 --> 00:50:28,981
Let's see.

681
00:50:35,863 --> 00:50:37,804
Bruce Dickinson, did you want to comment on this?

682
00:50:37,944 --> 00:50:44,707
It becomes necessary for one people.

683
00:50:46,309 --> 00:51:05,957
to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and... Are we still having technical difficulties or not, Mr. President?

684
00:51:07,258 --> 00:51:09,059
That sounded like the Declaration of Independence to me.

685
00:51:09,079 --> 00:51:10,439
Mr. Kerenbese, please call the roll.

686
00:51:10,499 --> 00:51:11,100
Councilor Beres.

687
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:15,435
Yes.

688
00:51:16,015 --> 00:51:17,036
Vice President Caravaglia.

689
00:51:17,076 --> 00:51:17,376
Yes.

690
00:51:17,936 --> 00:51:18,496
Councilor Knight.

691
00:51:19,357 --> 00:51:19,677
Yes.

692
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:20,677
Councilor Marks.

693
00:51:21,197 --> 00:51:21,538
Yes.

694
00:51:21,898 --> 00:51:22,578
Councilor Morrell.

695
00:51:23,158 --> 00:51:23,438
Yes.

696
00:51:23,818 --> 00:51:24,639
Councilor Scarpelli.

697
00:51:25,699 --> 00:51:28,580
Sorry, the airplanes are so low, but yes, yes.

698
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:29,321
I didn't hear.

699
00:51:29,841 --> 00:51:30,221
Thank you.

700
00:51:30,601 --> 00:51:31,581
President Falco.

701
00:51:32,362 --> 00:51:32,642
Yes.

702
00:51:32,662 --> 00:51:34,783
70 affirmative, zero negative.

703
00:51:34,983 --> 00:51:35,923
The motion passes.

704
00:51:36,203 --> 00:51:37,544
Michael, you'll be hearing that in a minute.

705
00:51:41,925 --> 00:51:46,528
Move down the bottom of the hill and the highway drowns it out, let me tell you.

706
00:51:46,548 --> 00:51:51,932
20-429 offered by Vice President Carviello.

707
00:51:52,592 --> 00:52:05,220
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council receive an answer from the Historical Commission on the status of 421 High Street, 421 High Street, regarding a Cincinnati funeral home as the property has fallen into disrepair.

708
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,741
Vice President Carviello.

709
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:08,193
Thank you, Mr. President.

710
00:52:08,233 --> 00:52:18,562
Mr. President, this is, I think, a property that's come before the Historical Commission for demolition, and I don't know where it was gone after that.

711
00:52:18,622 --> 00:52:27,090
I know there was a board placed in front of the property that's since fallen down, and the paper that was on it is gone.

712
00:52:27,763 --> 00:52:35,346
And it could be cleaned up and residents of the business community have been asking what the status of that property is.

713
00:52:35,366 --> 00:52:43,609
So if we can get an answer from the historical commission on the status of that demolition or non demolition and what's going on there, it'd be appreciated.

714
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:47,831
Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

715
00:52:49,292 --> 00:52:49,812
That's all night.

716
00:52:53,755 --> 00:52:58,798
Yes, Mr. President, thank you very much, and I thank Councillor Caviello for bringing this up.

717
00:53:00,098 --> 00:53:08,983
Ultimately, we have a demolition delay ordinance that calls for an 18-month period for demolition delay.

718
00:53:09,623 --> 00:53:23,090
And it was a measure that was put forth with good intentions, but I think this is one of the areas that we need to look at going forward, is the negative impact that an 18-month demolition delay will have.

719
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:37,519
Um, if a person buys a property and they have to wait 18 months, uh, to demolish it, then, um, there could be the potential where the circumstances that we're in right now happen where, uh, you know, they let the property fall into disrepair for a period of a year and a half.

720
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:41,262
Um, let that demolition delay window pass and then.

721
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,508
That's all right.

722
00:53:49,528 --> 00:53:50,048
We lost you.

723
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:58,201
Councilor Knight.

724
00:53:59,081 --> 00:54:02,382
Get deemed as a historically significant building.

725
00:54:02,562 --> 00:54:08,923
I mean, the only thing historically significant about Pacelli's is the curtains on the third floor apartment.

726
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:12,803
So I think it's really something that we need to look at, Mr. President.

727
00:54:13,163 --> 00:54:16,624
As I sit here and speak and look at the screen, everybody is frozen.

728
00:54:16,644 --> 00:54:18,924
It looks like I'm in a museum, so I'm going to rest my case.

729
00:54:19,284 --> 00:54:20,145
But thank you very much.

730
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:22,625
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

731
00:54:24,098 --> 00:54:25,179
Vice President Caviello.

732
00:54:25,479 --> 00:54:32,522
And I say, Mr. President, this isn't a business district and it doesn't bode well for the other businesses that are in that area.

733
00:54:32,542 --> 00:54:36,564
So if we can get an answer, that'd be greatly appreciated.

734
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:38,345
Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

735
00:54:38,986 --> 00:54:42,007
On the motion, actually, are there any questions from the council on this issue?

736
00:54:46,189 --> 00:54:48,210
Any questions from the public?

737
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:51,192
Okay, seeing and hearing none.

738
00:54:52,573 --> 00:54:53,133
Clerk Arnabis.

739
00:54:54,723 --> 00:54:55,223
Please call the roll.

740
00:54:55,604 --> 00:54:56,204
Is there a second?

741
00:54:56,224 --> 00:54:57,565
I'm sorry, I missed the second.

742
00:54:57,705 --> 00:55:00,167
Is there a second on the Vice President Caravello's resolution?

743
00:55:00,207 --> 00:55:00,888
Yes, second.

744
00:55:01,348 --> 00:55:01,808
Second.

745
00:55:01,848 --> 00:55:02,849
Councilor Scott Kelly.

746
00:55:03,269 --> 00:55:03,590
Second.

747
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:05,671
Here comes the roll call.

748
00:55:05,871 --> 00:55:06,512
Councilor Behrs.

749
00:55:07,412 --> 00:55:07,693
Yes.

750
00:55:08,153 --> 00:55:09,154
Vice President Caravello.

751
00:55:09,434 --> 00:55:09,654
Yes.

752
00:55:10,195 --> 00:55:11,015
Councilor Knight.

753
00:55:11,075 --> 00:55:18,000
Councilor Knight, are you there?

754
00:55:21,563 --> 00:55:23,164
We're gonna skip him, go to Councilor Marks.

755
00:55:23,604 --> 00:55:23,865
Yes.

756
00:55:24,878 --> 00:55:25,558
Councilor Morrell?

757
00:55:26,158 --> 00:55:26,418
Yes.

758
00:55:26,879 --> 00:55:27,719
Councilor Scarpelli?

759
00:55:28,379 --> 00:55:28,639
Yes.

760
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:29,999
President Falco?

761
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:31,380
Yes.

762
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,740
All right, I've got Councilor Knight.

763
00:55:34,821 --> 00:55:36,221
We're still waiting on a vote from Councilor Knight.

764
00:55:37,161 --> 00:55:38,482
He sent a message in the chat.

765
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:40,242
Oh, let's see.

766
00:55:40,262 --> 00:55:41,863
Let me look at the chat here.

767
00:55:44,523 --> 00:55:45,564
He says he has no audio.

768
00:55:45,824 --> 00:55:46,644
He has no audio.

769
00:55:46,984 --> 00:55:47,284
Okay.

770
00:55:48,584 --> 00:55:51,825
Do you want me to try and get his vote out of the chat?

771
00:55:52,605 --> 00:55:53,866
Let's see if we can get it from there.

772
00:56:08,888 --> 00:56:09,168
Hang on.

773
00:56:11,689 --> 00:56:12,590
I can't get him in the chat.

774
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:13,230
Hang on a second.

775
00:56:34,179 --> 00:56:35,179
He's gone from the chat, hang on.

776
00:56:35,499 --> 00:56:37,660
Can we table it until he comes back, Mr. President?

777
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:38,920
I mean- He's in the waiting room.

778
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,081
Hang on, I'm letting him back in.

779
00:56:42,562 --> 00:56:42,902
He's in.

780
00:56:44,923 --> 00:56:45,283
He's in.

781
00:56:46,683 --> 00:56:51,985
Anybody, all the counselors are co-hosts, so if you see him, if you actually see him come into the room, just unmute him, please.

782
00:56:52,005 --> 00:56:54,486
There you are.

783
00:57:02,503 --> 00:57:06,084
Council, if you can hear us we're still waiting on your vote on this on this one.

784
00:57:06,724 --> 00:57:07,024
Yes.

785
00:57:07,664 --> 00:57:08,124
Thank you.

786
00:57:08,144 --> 00:57:12,185
It's on the consulate consulate copy all those paper.

787
00:57:12,745 --> 00:57:13,205
That's correct.

788
00:57:13,245 --> 00:57:15,045
We haven't gotten any other any other papers yet.

789
00:57:15,905 --> 00:57:16,225
Thank you.

790
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:20,346
Zero the negative the motion passes.

791
00:57:24,867 --> 00:57:29,508
President copy all what can you please take the chair for the next several resolutions.

792
00:57:29,948 --> 00:57:30,708
Thank you, Mr. President.

793
00:57:32,653 --> 00:57:41,744
20430 offered by President Falco, be it resolved that the street sign at the intersection of Spring Street Extension and Lambert Street be replaced.

794
00:57:42,165 --> 00:57:42,946
President Falco.

795
00:57:45,237 --> 00:57:46,518
Thank you, President Carvajal.

796
00:57:47,138 --> 00:57:49,060
I bring this forward tonight.

797
00:57:49,340 --> 00:58:03,010
I've spent a lot of time in the Salem Street Business District over the past few months during the COVID-19 outbreak, giving out meals to part of the grab-and-go program, giving out meals, lunches on a daily basis.

798
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:06,652
And as you sit around, of course, you see different things in the neighborhood.

799
00:58:06,772 --> 00:58:13,957
And it's one of those, you know, Salem Street and that Salem Street business area is really a gateway to our community.

800
00:58:13,977 --> 00:58:14,678
And we really need to

801
00:58:15,138 --> 00:58:17,122
take a look at that and hopefully, you know.

802
00:58:18,897 --> 00:58:20,538
you know, beautify it in some way.

803
00:58:20,578 --> 00:58:22,800
And I noticed they've done some flowers, which is nice.

804
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:26,483
The MBTA finally cut the lawn last week, which is nice as well.

805
00:58:26,543 --> 00:58:28,504
It was probably about two and a half feet tall.

806
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:36,470
But the street sign at the intersection of Spring Street Extension and Lambert Street, I'm asking that to be replaced.

807
00:58:37,191 --> 00:58:41,294
The pole is practically bent in half and you can barely read the sign.

808
00:58:41,314 --> 00:58:45,177
So if we could just have those street signs replaced, I'd greatly appreciate it.

809
00:58:46,487 --> 00:58:47,527
Any questions from the council?

810
00:58:47,988 --> 00:58:53,710
Mr. President, just to follow up, I want to thank President Falco for putting this on.

811
00:58:54,771 --> 00:59:02,534
I just want to reiterate, Mr. President, there is $50,000 currently available in a city account.

812
00:59:03,834 --> 00:59:05,335
for each business district.

813
00:59:06,136 --> 00:59:18,002
The only business district that has gotten together and put together a full plan and is now realizing some of the benefits to the 50,000 is the West Meffitt Business Association.

814
00:59:18,463 --> 00:59:28,188
So I would ask Mr. President that all the other business associations get together, put together a plan, and Mayor Lungo Kern wants to make sure that this

815
00:59:28,628 --> 00:59:37,238
money that's been available for, I think, close to four years now, gets dispersed so we can do some of the improvements that President Falco just spoke about.

816
00:59:38,479 --> 00:59:47,789
Councilor Moxley, from what I'm told, the West Medford improvements were donated from the generosity of the East Cambridge Savings Bank.

817
00:59:50,269 --> 00:59:51,369
I've been told otherwise.

818
00:59:52,370 --> 01:00:01,371
That may have been part of it, but I've been told that they used their portion of their money from the parking program.

819
01:00:01,451 --> 01:00:05,692
All right, on the motion of President Falco, seconded by?

820
01:00:07,093 --> 01:00:07,433
Second.

821
01:00:08,033 --> 01:00:09,013
Seconded by Councilor Behrs.

822
01:00:09,853 --> 01:00:10,893
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

823
01:00:14,234 --> 01:00:14,834
Councilor Behrs.

824
01:00:15,694 --> 01:00:15,974
Yes.

825
01:00:16,434 --> 01:00:17,495
Vice President Carabiello.

826
01:00:17,795 --> 01:00:17,995
Yes.

827
01:00:18,515 --> 01:00:18,975
Councilor Knight.

828
01:00:23,066 --> 01:00:23,526
Councilor Knight?

829
01:00:30,272 --> 01:00:31,493
Councilor Knight has no audio again.

830
01:00:31,513 --> 01:00:32,073
Hang on just a second.

831
01:00:32,554 --> 01:00:33,154
Councilor Marks?

832
01:00:33,735 --> 01:00:34,015
Yes.

833
01:00:35,016 --> 01:00:35,636
Councilor Morrell?

834
01:00:36,577 --> 01:00:36,837
Yes.

835
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:38,659
Councilor Scarpelli?

836
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:40,140
Yes.

837
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:41,481
President Falco?

838
01:00:42,482 --> 01:00:42,722
Yes.

839
01:00:43,202 --> 01:00:45,104
I was supposed to call Vice President Caraballo at the end.

840
01:00:45,144 --> 01:00:45,884
I called him second.

841
01:00:45,904 --> 01:00:46,825
I apologize for that.

842
01:00:47,165 --> 01:00:48,827
Let me see if I can reach Councilor Knight for his vote.

843
01:00:51,952 --> 01:00:56,153
Mr. Clerk, that would be a yes, and I sent you a text message as well.

844
01:00:56,614 --> 01:00:57,054
I got it.

845
01:00:57,074 --> 01:00:57,714
Thank you very much.

846
01:00:57,754 --> 01:00:58,474
Just got the text.

847
01:00:58,494 --> 01:00:58,914
Thank you.

848
01:00:58,934 --> 01:01:01,995
That's a yes.

849
01:01:02,015 --> 01:01:02,055
7-0.

850
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:02,776
7 in the affirmative.

851
01:01:03,416 --> 01:01:04,216
Motion passes.

852
01:01:04,236 --> 01:01:07,257
2-0-4-3-1, offered by President Falco.

853
01:01:07,837 --> 01:01:15,160
Be it resolved that the tree stump in front of the MBTA building on Salem Street be removed in the interest of public safety.

854
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:15,960
President Falco.

855
01:01:16,843 --> 01:01:18,464
Thank you, President Carviello.

856
01:01:18,964 --> 01:01:21,965
This is similar to the last one, last resolution.

857
01:01:23,125 --> 01:01:26,626
Just that there's this tree stump that looks like it's been there forever.

858
01:01:27,227 --> 01:01:28,307
It needs to be removed.

859
01:01:28,567 --> 01:01:30,448
That's a sidewalk that is heavily traversed.

860
01:01:31,008 --> 01:01:34,429
A lot of people going in between Salem Street and the shopping plaza there.

861
01:01:34,869 --> 01:01:38,651
So if we could just have that removed in the interest of public safety, we'd greatly appreciate that.

862
01:01:39,031 --> 01:01:39,671
Thank you, Mr. President.

863
01:01:39,691 --> 01:01:40,111
Move approval.

864
01:01:41,311 --> 01:01:44,072
On the motion by President Falco, seconded by Councilor Marks.

865
01:01:44,613 --> 01:01:45,533
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

866
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:48,220
Councilor Behrs.

867
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:49,620
Yes.

868
01:01:50,521 --> 01:01:51,421
Vice President Caraballo.

869
01:01:51,661 --> 01:01:51,881
Yes.

870
01:01:52,621 --> 01:01:53,181
Councilor Knight.

871
01:01:55,682 --> 01:01:57,242
Councilor Knight has texted me a yes.

872
01:02:00,043 --> 01:02:00,643
Councilor Marks.

873
01:02:01,243 --> 01:02:01,523
Yes.

874
01:02:02,883 --> 01:02:03,543
Councilor Morrell.

875
01:02:04,123 --> 01:02:04,383
Yes.

876
01:02:04,904 --> 01:02:05,744
Councilor Scarpelli.

877
01:02:06,224 --> 01:02:06,464
Yes.

878
01:02:06,484 --> 01:02:07,684
Vice President Falco.

879
01:02:08,204 --> 01:02:08,444
Yes.

880
01:02:10,085 --> 01:02:11,645
The affirmative motion passes.

881
01:02:13,752 --> 01:02:18,194
2-0-4-3-2, offered by President Falco, be it resolved that the crosswalks in Haines Square be repainted.

882
01:02:18,214 --> 01:02:18,674
President Carriello.

883
01:02:19,074 --> 01:02:19,315
Yes.

884
01:02:19,775 --> 01:02:24,937
If I wouldn't mind, I'm not sure if Councilor Marks is agreeable, but would you like to join these last two resolutions?

885
01:02:25,537 --> 01:02:27,518
We're doing the crosswalk first.

886
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:28,619
Oh, okay.

887
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:29,899
Perfect.

888
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:30,740
I'm ahead of myself.

889
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:31,500
I apologize.

890
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:36,543
Be it resolved that the crosswalks in Haines Square be repainted in the interest of public safety.

891
01:02:36,603 --> 01:02:37,283
President Falco.

892
01:02:38,637 --> 01:02:40,358
Thank you, President Carviello.

893
01:02:40,998 --> 01:02:46,341
I just wanted to see if we could get the crosswalks in Haines Square repainted in the interest of public safety.

894
01:02:46,821 --> 01:02:49,442
A lot of the crosswalks in that area have faded.

895
01:02:49,882 --> 01:02:59,226
It's a high-traffic area, and a lot of people that cross from Spring over to Modern Highway are in that area there.

896
01:02:59,286 --> 01:03:05,109
So if we could just have all those crosswalks just repainted in the interest of public safety, I'd greatly appreciate it.

897
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:06,970
Any other questions?

898
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:11,031
The motion by President Falco, seconded by?

899
01:03:12,111 --> 01:03:12,431
Second.

900
01:03:12,451 --> 01:03:14,371
Seconded by Councilor Marks.

901
01:03:14,872 --> 01:03:16,092
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

902
01:03:17,992 --> 01:03:18,632
Councilor Bears?

903
01:03:19,473 --> 01:03:19,733
Yes.

904
01:03:20,853 --> 01:03:21,413
Councilor Knight?

905
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:28,555
Councilor Knight has texted me a yes vote and he's nodding his head yes on the screen.

906
01:03:31,438 --> 01:03:32,018
Councilor Marks?

907
01:03:32,479 --> 01:03:32,819
Yes.

908
01:03:33,319 --> 01:03:34,020
Councilor Morrell?

909
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:34,820
Yes.

910
01:03:35,301 --> 01:03:36,101
Councilor Scarpelli?

911
01:03:36,442 --> 01:03:36,682
Yes.

912
01:03:37,362 --> 01:03:38,183
President Falco?

913
01:03:38,923 --> 01:03:39,163
Yes.

914
01:03:39,684 --> 01:03:40,665
Vice President Caravaglia?

915
01:03:41,045 --> 01:03:41,265
Yes.

916
01:03:41,545 --> 01:03:45,268
Seven in the affirmative, motion passes.

917
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:48,710
20433 and 20434 by Councilor Marks.

918
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:50,832
The same, if we could do them together.

919
01:03:51,112 --> 01:03:52,053
Councilors, is that okay?

920
01:03:52,853 --> 01:03:53,193
I would make.

921
01:03:53,694 --> 01:03:54,034
Okay.

922
01:03:54,474 --> 01:03:56,496
Offered by President Falco and Councilor Marks.

923
01:03:56,596 --> 01:03:59,278
Technically you need to vote to join that.

924
01:04:00,383 --> 01:04:02,544
Okay, do we have a motion to join 2-0-4-3-3?

925
01:04:02,864 --> 01:04:04,986
Motion to join.

926
01:04:05,786 --> 01:04:06,246
Second.

927
01:04:06,786 --> 01:04:10,588
Motion by Council President Falco, seconded by Councilor Behrs.

928
01:04:10,628 --> 01:04:11,809
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

929
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:15,311
Councilor Behrs?

930
01:04:15,991 --> 01:04:16,311
Yes.

931
01:04:18,832 --> 01:04:19,413
Councilor Knight?

932
01:04:25,276 --> 01:04:26,516
Councilor Knight is nodding his head yes.

933
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:27,857
I'm taking that as a yes.

934
01:04:30,059 --> 01:04:30,859
He has no audio.

935
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:31,800
Councilor Marks?

936
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:32,640
Yes.

937
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:33,820
Councilor Morrell?

938
01:04:35,101 --> 01:04:35,421
Yes.

939
01:04:35,921 --> 01:04:36,761
Councilor Scarpelli?

940
01:04:37,122 --> 01:04:37,402
Yes.

941
01:04:38,502 --> 01:04:39,302
President Falco?

942
01:04:39,843 --> 01:04:40,083
Yes.

943
01:04:42,584 --> 01:04:43,764
And then Vice President Caravello?

944
01:04:44,364 --> 01:04:45,765
Yes.

945
01:04:45,805 --> 01:04:51,847
And just for the record, I also received a text from Councilor Knight with a yes vote to join these motions.

946
01:04:52,267 --> 01:04:55,849
So he has indicated a yes by text and by nodding his head.

947
01:04:59,390 --> 01:04:59,650
Okay.

948
01:05:01,572 --> 01:05:04,753
20433 and 20434 offered by President Falco and Councilor Marks.

949
01:05:05,314 --> 01:05:13,178
Be it resolved that the MBTA representative be asked to appear before the Method City Council to explain why the 325, 326 bus routes are being eliminated.

950
01:05:13,198 --> 01:05:13,919
President Falco.

951
01:05:13,939 --> 01:05:14,339
Thank you.

952
01:05:21,511 --> 01:05:22,472
Thank you, President Cabrillo.

953
01:05:23,172 --> 01:05:30,496
I bring this resolution tonight because I have received numerous emails regarding the 325 and 326 bus routes.

954
01:05:31,837 --> 01:05:36,940
This is a, it's actually also a bus route that I take on a daily basis when I'm working.

955
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:48,727
And I know Councilor Mark says too, we're longtime riders and there are many, many people that depend on these bus routes on a daily basis to get to and from

956
01:05:49,635 --> 01:05:53,217
Boston, and they're very convenient to the people in our community.

957
01:05:53,817 --> 01:06:00,080
And there are many members of our community that depend on these bus routes on a daily basis.

958
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:03,721
Now, I've received messages that they're being eliminated.

959
01:06:04,141 --> 01:06:10,624
I also received a phone call today from Representative Donato, who told me they were being temporarily taken out of service.

960
01:06:11,665 --> 01:06:14,666
He did tell me, actually he assured me that

961
01:06:15,467 --> 01:06:22,995
that they would be reinstated in mid-July, which to me, it felt better about it.

962
01:06:23,496 --> 01:06:32,165
But still with that being said, I know the MBTA has been trying to eliminate these bus routes for a number of years.

963
01:06:32,606 --> 01:06:36,210
I know they tried to eliminate them twice before.

964
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:40,232
And we fought back actually at one point with the help of the clerk.

965
01:06:40,992 --> 01:06:50,998
He helped us out with it and we were able to maintain those bus routes and keep them servicing West Medford and North Medford.

966
01:06:52,478 --> 01:06:54,219
And like I said, these are important bus routes.

967
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:58,822
I just wanted to make sure that they're not eliminated completely.

968
01:06:59,274 --> 01:07:01,695
I know the MBTA has been trying to eliminate them.

969
01:07:02,175 --> 01:07:04,556
I know Representative Donato says it's temporary.

970
01:07:04,997 --> 01:07:07,018
But to me, I still have concerns.

971
01:07:07,098 --> 01:07:07,958
It's the MBTA.

972
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:09,519
I know they're trying to save money.

973
01:07:09,539 --> 01:07:11,160
I just want to make sure they're here for us.

974
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:18,483
And that's why I wanted to hear from a representative from the MBTA that could explain further.

975
01:07:18,883 --> 01:07:22,265
I know that ridership has been down during COVID-19.

976
01:07:22,765 --> 01:07:26,707
But I still have concerns that they're going to be eliminated.

977
01:07:27,608 --> 01:07:30,576
So that's why I bring this forward tonight.

978
01:07:31,979 --> 01:07:32,280
Thank you.

979
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:32,841
Councilor Marks.

980
01:07:33,921 --> 01:07:35,002
Thank you, Mr. President.

981
01:07:35,462 --> 01:07:37,183
I want to thank President Falco.

982
01:07:37,203 --> 01:07:39,024
He did an excellent job explaining that.

983
01:07:39,824 --> 01:07:57,732
I, too, want to thank Representative Donato, who immediately got on the phone and talked to representatives of the MBTA, who did assure him, I was told, within the next two or three weeks that it would be fully reinstalled, the bus routes.

984
01:07:58,753 --> 01:08:02,935
As President Falco mentioned, that has been a bone of contention with

985
01:08:03,615 --> 01:08:07,717
area residents that take the express bus, Mr. President, into town.

986
01:08:08,337 --> 01:08:19,741
And I think we all can remember when they try to cut back a few of the routes and the bus was filled to capacity, over which is a requirement

987
01:08:20,101 --> 01:08:35,585
that the MBTA has for safety concerns, and they still allowed it to exist until the members of the Memphis City Council got involved, Mr. President, and we were able to reinstitute some of the cut routes for the 325 and 326.

988
01:08:36,165 --> 01:08:44,087
So I'm hoping within the next two or three weeks, according to Rep Donato, this will be reinstituted.

989
01:08:44,527 --> 01:08:46,329
because there's a need, Mr. President.

990
01:08:47,009 --> 01:08:55,616
And it clearly shows that there is a need in this community to use both the 325 and the 326.

991
01:08:57,077 --> 01:09:00,359
And I want to thank President Falco for offering this as well.

992
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:01,020
Thank you.

993
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:01,880
Thank you, Councilor Bax.

994
01:09:02,481 --> 01:09:05,083
Councilor Baez, did you have your hand up?

995
01:09:05,803 --> 01:09:06,084
I did.

996
01:09:06,144 --> 01:09:07,725
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

997
01:09:08,926 --> 01:09:11,528
I just wanted to add that, you know,

998
01:09:12,718 --> 01:09:14,339
President Falco takes the bus every day.

999
01:09:14,379 --> 01:09:21,121
I couldn't say it better than him, but you know, this is a time when we need more bus service, when we want to have fewer people packed into buses and trains.

1000
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:26,183
I mean, the, the, the emails I got were, you know, obviously inconvenience.

1001
01:09:26,223 --> 01:09:34,186
I need to get to work, but it was, you know, now I'm going to have to put myself in more danger transfer between multiple trains just to get to the same location that I would buy the bus.

1002
01:09:34,246 --> 01:09:39,567
So, you know, it's an important transit issue and we need more bus service, but it's a health issue for people during this pandemic.

1003
01:09:40,528 --> 01:09:40,868
Thank you.

1004
01:09:42,683 --> 01:09:43,904
Any other questions by the council?

1005
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:52,326

Sorry, I was supposed to call you last, I apologize.

1012
01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:07,550
That's all right.

1013
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:11,151
Councilor Knight texted me that he's a yes on this.

1014

Yes.

1022
01:10:25,959 --> 01:10:27,481
I called that totally out of order.

1023
01:10:27,521 --> 01:10:28,101
Sorry about that.

1024
01:10:28,922 --> 01:10:30,203
The motion passes.

1025
01:10:30,664 --> 01:10:32,746
I revert the chair back to President Falco.

1026
01:10:33,465 --> 01:10:35,507

1073
01:12:58,763 --> 01:13:04,890
The purpose of this meeting was to discuss the brewery and tasting room ordinances.

1074
01:13:05,571 --> 01:13:08,074
I'm sorry, brewery and tasting room ordinance.

1075
01:13:09,185 --> 01:13:17,510
We conclude the meeting by sending the paper to City Solicitor Scanlon, where she's going to make updates to that and send it back to us.

1076
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:21,152

1094
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:00,769
President Falco?

1095
01:14:01,329 --> 01:14:01,569

1096
01:14:02,289 --> 01:14:05,231

1097
01:14:06,597 --> 01:14:07,538
The report is approved.

1098
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:11,462
Next item is public participation.

1099
01:14:11,482 --> 01:14:14,105
Let's see, 20-437, and I apologize if I get this wrong.

1100
01:14:14,125 --> 01:14:19,351
374 Winthrop Street, Metro Massachusetts, 02155, to discuss police training and reform.

1101
01:14:30,539 --> 01:14:31,619
Thank you, President Falco.

1102
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,941
I appreciate you giving me the chance to speak and address all of you.

1103
01:14:37,582 --> 01:14:47,347
So I'd like to take a second to talk to everyone about the need for police reform in the context of what we're seeing nationwide and locally here in the greater Boston area with protests.

1104
01:14:49,047 --> 01:14:51,969
I think everyone would agree that police are very important.

1105
01:14:52,329 --> 01:14:58,632
They have a dangerous job, and they have to go out and deal with many of kind of the worst

1106
01:14:59,624 --> 01:15:00,345
of our community.

1107
01:15:00,385 --> 01:15:03,367
When there's a problem, when there's a crime, they're the ones that get sent in.

1108
01:15:03,407 --> 01:15:05,349
They're the ones that have to go and deal with that.

1109
01:15:05,889 --> 01:15:12,855
And as a result, we give them a lot of leeway, and we cut them a lot of slack when it comes to how they interact with people.

1110
01:15:13,115 --> 01:15:16,638
They get licensed to use force that other people wouldn't be able to use.

1111
01:15:17,538 --> 01:15:22,682
And we give them the benefit of the doubt, so when something goes wrong, we tend to believe them.

1112
01:15:23,323 --> 01:15:28,167
But then things sometimes do go wrong, and sometimes they go wrong horribly, as we've seen multiple times

1113
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:30,661
the nation with people getting killed.

1114
01:15:30,681 --> 01:15:38,167
We've seen George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, more recently, um, um, Brooks, I'm going to get his last, his first name wrong.

1115
01:15:38,588 --> 01:15:44,092
They were, they were killed at the hands of police and they, you know, these deaths didn't need to happen.

1116
01:15:44,973 --> 01:15:55,621
Um, and so there are protests that are happening nationwide that are protesting, not just these deaths, but kind of this system of violence and racism that seems to be targeting minorities in our community.

1117
01:15:56,404 --> 01:16:04,649
And so when we see these things, it's really easy to kind of look at that and think, well, those are other police forces.

1118
01:16:04,689 --> 01:16:05,990
Those are other parts of America.

1119
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:08,731
It's not here in our community that we face these problems.

1120
01:16:09,312 --> 01:16:12,814
And I believe that these problems do exist in our community as well.

1121
01:16:13,314 --> 01:16:20,538
And the easiest evidence of this that we can see is the overtime scandal that happened recently that I'm sure everyone here is familiar with.

1122
01:16:20,989 --> 01:16:27,054
where multiple police officers were going and they were effectively stealing taxpayer money.

1123
01:16:27,735 --> 01:16:33,079
And the resolution of that was that none of these police officers were held accountable.

1124
01:16:33,119 --> 01:16:34,040
None of them were fired.

1125
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:35,481
So they're all still on the force.

1126
01:16:35,521 --> 01:16:40,185
And in fact, I believe roughly a quarter of the police force now is on the Brady list.

1127
01:16:40,722 --> 01:16:51,509
which is a list of untrustworthy police officers that are not allowed to testify in a court of law because they're seen as untrustworthy actors.

1128
01:16:51,889 --> 01:16:53,911
And so their testimony isn't useful.

1129
01:16:53,991 --> 01:16:59,694
So a quarter of the police department can't even go to court to testify in the cases that they might be involved in.

1130
01:17:00,955 --> 01:17:08,760
And so in that context, I think it's important to think about what we're doing to reform police and maybe move things within Medford and within our own community.

1131
01:17:09,994 --> 01:17:15,998
The mayor recently sent out an open letter with Chief Buckley about how they're going to be doing more police training.

1132
01:17:16,359 --> 01:17:17,379
And I welcome that.

1133
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:18,140
It's a good start.

1134
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:18,980
It's not sufficient.

1135
01:17:19,581 --> 01:17:23,604
I've actually communicated with the mayor a bit more, and I believe that there are more things happening.

1136
01:17:24,204 --> 01:17:32,350
Chief Buckley is going to be going and reviewing policies and posting them publicly on the police website so there's greater transparency, and I greatly applaud that.

1137
01:17:33,010 --> 01:17:39,395
And I believe that the mayor is also going to go and declare racism to be a public health emergency.

1138
01:17:39,889 --> 01:17:44,893
And I'm not totally sure what the fallout of that is, but it certainly sounds good.

1139
01:17:45,334 --> 01:17:46,755
I think we need to go further, though.

1140
01:17:47,223 --> 01:17:49,985
And in particular, there are two things that I'm advocating for.

1141
01:17:50,005 --> 01:17:54,047
One is kind of on the prevention side, and one is on the accountability side.

1142
01:17:54,508 --> 01:18:00,792
On the prevention side, we should implement the policies that you can see at the aidcantwait.org website.

1143
01:18:01,132 --> 01:18:04,254
I'm going to quickly run through those right now, just so people know what they are.

1144
01:18:04,534 --> 01:18:07,856
These were just implemented in Somerville, so they work locally.

1145
01:18:08,076 --> 01:18:09,998
And we should be implementing all of them here.

1146
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:14,881
And those policies specifically are a ban on chokeholds and strangleholds.

1147
01:18:15,512 --> 01:18:19,176
A requirement that police must try to deescalate the situation.

1148
01:18:19,196 --> 01:18:23,021
A requirement that the police must warn before firing shots.

1149
01:18:24,483 --> 01:18:28,267
A requirement that the police must exhaust all alternatives before shooting.

1150
01:18:28,287 --> 01:18:30,189
A duty to intervene.

1151
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:34,755
So if a police officer sees another police officer doing something wrong, they have a duty to intervene.

1152
01:18:35,425 --> 01:18:44,413
a ban at shooting at moving vehicles, requiring the police to do a use of force continuum, and finally, require comprehensive reporting from the police.

1153
01:18:44,833 --> 01:18:46,855
These are all things that should be on the books already.

1154
01:18:47,095 --> 01:18:48,996
I honestly don't know how many of them are on the books.

1155
01:18:49,056 --> 01:18:51,458
I believe that's why Chief Buckley's looking at that and he's gonna post about it.

1156
01:18:51,859 --> 01:18:53,480
We should pass all of these immediately.

1157
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:55,262
There's no reason not to do any of them.

1158
01:18:55,302 --> 01:18:57,584
They'll make community policing stronger.

1159
01:18:58,224 --> 01:19:03,649
And then the other thing that we should be doing is we need to have a system to hold police accountable when something goes wrong.

1160
01:19:04,288 --> 01:19:04,895
When you see...

1161
01:19:06,027 --> 01:19:07,828
people getting killed by police officers.

1162
01:19:07,968 --> 01:19:20,577
Inevitably, it comes up that the police officers that killed the person was a bad apple, that they had a history of past complaints against them, that there were many reports about things they did wrong.

1163
01:19:20,917 --> 01:19:25,160
And for one reason or another, the police force was unable to get rid of these actors.

1164
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:27,922
And we seem to have the same problem.

1165
01:19:27,962 --> 01:19:31,044
Again, none of these officers were held accountable with the overtime scandal.

1166
01:19:31,304 --> 01:19:34,046
So we do seem to have a number of bad apples within our own

1167
01:19:34,842 --> 01:19:35,442
police force.

1168
01:19:35,842 --> 01:19:43,785
And so what we need is an independent civilian oversight of our police department that has the ability to hold people accountable.

1169
01:19:43,825 --> 01:19:45,906
And I know that's very difficult with the police union.

1170
01:19:46,326 --> 01:19:57,811
I know it may be hard to get rid of people, but we need to think about how we can go about making these changes to kind of make things better because protecting the bad actors with complaints against them, they're protecting the ones that are stealing taxpayer money.

1171
01:19:58,311 --> 01:20:03,393
These just make our police force weaker and it makes the good cop's job harder to actually go and help people.

1172
01:20:04,663 --> 01:20:07,165
I just want to say that the opinions that I'm saying are popular.

1173
01:20:07,205 --> 01:20:08,406
It's not just me saying this.

1174
01:20:08,746 --> 01:20:23,737
I posted on Nextdoor, and it's not the most scientific of things, but many, many, many people were posting when we spoke about this, and I would say around two-thirds of the population that posted did seem to support police reform.

1175
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:25,518
So this is a popular thing that we should be doing.

1176
01:20:26,122 --> 01:20:31,563
And finally, I know a lot of the focus right now is on the budget shortfall that we're facing.

1177
01:20:32,363 --> 01:20:37,584
We had a good conversation before about how our school system has a huge shortfall and they need more money.

1178
01:20:38,004 --> 01:20:49,726
Perhaps it's time to reexamine maybe putting more resources towards our schools and other community services and less towards our police department because we have a budget shortfall and we have to make cuts somewhere.

1179
01:20:50,046 --> 01:20:51,246
That's everything I wanted to say.

1180
01:20:51,466 --> 01:20:53,407
Thank you so much for taking the time to listen.

1181
01:20:54,807 --> 01:20:55,027
That's it.

1182
01:20:55,663 --> 01:20:58,926
Thank you, thank you very much for participating today.

1183
01:20:58,966 --> 01:21:00,507
We appreciate it.

1184
01:21:00,547 --> 01:21:03,930
Let's see, we have Vice President Carviello.

1185
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:04,951
Thank you, Mr. President.

1186
01:21:04,971 --> 01:21:13,398
Mr. President, does the gentleman have any instances of police brutality or police shootings that he wants to bring to the council's attention?

1187
01:21:14,613 --> 01:21:18,216
Oh, no, I absolutely don't have any information about that.

1188
01:21:18,536 --> 01:21:21,338
What I'm saying is that we need to have some system of accountability.

1189
01:21:21,358 --> 01:21:24,340
So that way, if there, I don't think anything like that's happened to be clear.

1190
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:26,761
I'm saying that we should have some sort of system in place.

1191
01:21:26,801 --> 01:21:36,288
So if we identify bad actors who have multiple complaints against them, who have, you know, use of force problems before that, we have a system to move them out of the police force.

1192
01:21:37,008 --> 01:21:40,931
I think, I think chief Buckley is, uh, is got a handle on most of these, uh,

1193
01:21:41,459 --> 01:21:42,540
these situations.

1194
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:48,227
And again, if you know of any bad actors in our police department, please bring them to our attention.

1195
01:21:48,928 --> 01:21:51,170
And so the chief can be aware of this.

1196
01:21:54,374 --> 01:21:55,035
Thank you, Mr. President.

1197
01:21:55,255 --> 01:21:56,457
Thank you, Counselor Marks.

1198
01:21:57,362 --> 01:22:03,404
Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank the previous speaker for coming and giving his opinion.

1199
01:22:04,684 --> 01:22:18,108
Mr. President, I think as I stated, I think it was last week, we have more in common than we do when it comes to what we believe needs to be done in regards to police reform.

1200
01:22:18,808 --> 01:22:24,653
I've had the opportunity over the last two weeks, actually, maybe even longer, to speak with some of the police officers.

1201
01:22:25,454 --> 01:22:30,938
And a few things that they mentioned to me, I think most people may even find a little surprising.

1202
01:22:31,939 --> 01:22:37,824
I think there's a lot of support among police officers regarding civilian review boards, Mr. President.

1203
01:22:38,484 --> 01:22:43,969
And with the one caveat that if you do set up a board that it be

1204
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:53,252
manned with people that have a working knowledge of how a police department operates, the role of a police department.

1205
01:22:53,692 --> 01:22:56,373
So they are open to that, Mr. President.

1206
01:22:57,073 --> 01:23:04,595
The union, according to Harold McGillivray, has met with the administration and wants to implement cameras.

1207
01:23:05,375 --> 01:23:09,538
for not only the safety of the general public, but for the safety of the officers.

1208
01:23:10,038 --> 01:23:18,384
So that's another thing, Mr. President, I think that if we start talking reform, that I think we have more in common, Mr. President.

1209
01:23:18,864 --> 01:23:25,609
The last point I'd like to make, and I said this last week, and I think there's a lot of support for it.

1210
01:23:26,610 --> 01:23:29,772
We rely on our police department for almost everything.

1211
01:23:30,332 --> 01:23:35,535
You know, they're the only department open seven days a week, 24 hours a day.

1212
01:23:36,196 --> 01:23:44,021
So when something happens in the community, Mr. President, you know, and it's after five o'clock, we just don't say, well, you know what, we'll handle it tomorrow.

1213
01:23:44,481 --> 01:23:46,703
It's the police department that responds.

1214
01:23:47,303 --> 01:23:54,308
And we're asking the men and women of our police department, Mr. President, to respond to issues of domestic violence.

1215
01:23:54,868 --> 01:23:59,351
We're asking them to respond to drug issues and people that are ODing.

1216
01:23:59,671 --> 01:24:02,613
We're asking them to respond to mental health issues.

1217
01:24:02,953 --> 01:24:06,416
We're asking them to respond to social issues, Mr. President.

1218
01:24:07,016 --> 01:24:21,486
And in my opinion, we're asking them to do a lot in addition to what their main responsibility is, is to keep public order and to prevent crimes and to protect the life and liberty of property.

1219
01:24:24,164 --> 01:24:26,285
They have a lot on their plate, Mr. President.

1220
01:24:26,805 --> 01:24:37,371
And from what I'm hearing from people when they talk about cutting the police department or defunding the police department, I think it has very many meanings.

1221
01:24:38,131 --> 01:24:42,373
And from what I'm hearing from a lot of people is they don't necessarily want to cut the police.

1222
01:24:42,994 --> 01:24:47,216
They want to give the assistance they believe the police officers should have.

1223
01:24:47,816 --> 01:24:51,138
So if there's a call, Mr. President, regarding domestic violence,

1224
01:24:51,858 --> 01:25:02,146
Why not have someone that's a domestic violence specialist, Mr. President, on hand that can go to calls, Mr. President, that can attend calls, that can assist?

1225
01:25:02,546 --> 01:25:08,130
Why not have someone that's a social worker that can attend calls, Mr. President, that may require that?

1226
01:25:08,510 --> 01:25:10,812
Or someone that has a mental health background

1227
01:25:11,172 --> 01:25:14,113
if the issue requires mental health, Mr. President.

1228
01:25:14,513 --> 01:25:20,414
There's a lot of ways we can assist the police department, Mr. President, and provide the safety, which I agree.

1229
01:25:21,154 --> 01:25:26,475
You know, we may have issues that are happening in the community that require other expertise.

1230
01:25:26,995 --> 01:25:34,316
And why not have the availability, Mr. President, and the availability to de-escalate situations?

1231
01:25:35,016 --> 01:25:39,437
And so I think there's a lot more in common than we realize

1232
01:25:39,957 --> 01:25:44,881
I think there would be a lot more support out there, Mr. President, once these discussions are had.

1233
01:25:45,341 --> 01:25:51,285
And I think we're going to move towards police reform that's going to be acceptable to everyone, Mr. President.

1234
01:25:51,586 --> 01:25:52,546
It'll be a win-win.

1235
01:25:53,167 --> 01:26:04,535
And I think that will not only improve communications within our community, but it'll also assist the brave men and women in our police department, Mr. President, to do their very taxing job.

1236
01:26:05,273 --> 01:26:13,338
And, you know, I think we all want to arrive at the same results, Mr. President, and that is to provide a safe community.

1237
01:26:13,658 --> 01:26:19,461
That's the number one job of the Meffitt City Council, is to provide a safe community, Mr. President.

1238
01:26:19,861 --> 01:26:23,383
And without public safety, we have nothing else in the community.

1239
01:26:24,124 --> 01:26:25,064
Thank you, Mr. President.

1240
01:26:25,565 --> 01:26:26,505
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1241
01:26:26,545 --> 01:26:29,047
Councilor Scarpelli.

1242
01:26:29,087 --> 01:26:29,927
Thank you, Mr. President.

1243
01:26:29,967 --> 01:26:32,649
Thank you for the speaker for bringing this forward.

1244
01:26:33,825 --> 01:26:39,446
Councilor Marks hit the nail on the head as I've been following, working in some of them, following what's going on in Cambridge.

1245
01:26:39,966 --> 01:26:46,387
And I think it was Councilor Simmons in Cambridge stated that it's a little different in Cambridge.

1246
01:26:46,447 --> 01:26:51,388
He feels that looking at different police departments, you have different levels.

1247
01:26:51,468 --> 01:27:02,610
So I'm confident and I'm excited that talking with Chief Buckley, he is willing and ready to listen and move forward some of these important

1248
01:27:03,518 --> 01:27:10,783
important issues, and I think we're going to be pleased, and I'm excited to see the changes.

1249
01:27:10,843 --> 01:27:14,806
Again, I asked for a forum a couple of weeks ago.

1250
01:27:14,846 --> 01:27:18,128
I'm still waiting for the city administration to get back to me.

1251
01:27:18,608 --> 01:27:28,115
I think it's important that we bring the community members to the table and sit with our administration to make sure we find best practices.

1252
01:27:29,475 --> 01:27:33,898
On a side note, I want to thank our men and women of the police force.

1253
01:27:34,358 --> 01:27:48,385
Just this past Sunday, we had a shooting over on Salt and Salt Road, and talking to neighbors and family members that live in that area, the response from both the Memphis police and state police were amazing.

1254
01:27:50,951 --> 01:28:12,052
I know they have a good handle on what happened and who's doing it, who did that, and they're gonna work quickly, but I wanna give them a round of applause because, again, I don't think anybody, a speaker who brought this forward, I don't think anybody is saying that, is not saying that,

1255
01:28:12,913 --> 01:28:25,862
Thank you for being the first ones in the fire, per se, and sticking your neck out in the hopes of saving lives here in Medford.

1256
01:28:25,882 --> 01:28:29,344
And I think that we can't look past that.

1257
01:28:29,384 --> 01:28:36,088
I think that this is a bigger piece, both on the police department side and what's happening in our society.

1258
01:28:36,148 --> 01:28:38,670
So I thank you for the time and thank you for bringing this forward.

1259
01:28:47,134 --> 01:28:48,454
Thank you, Councilor Scott Kelly.

1260
01:28:49,115 --> 01:28:51,896
We have a number of, any other comments from the council?

1261
01:28:52,776 --> 01:28:54,917
We have a number of residents that would like to speak on this issue.

1262
01:28:55,277 --> 01:28:57,878
The first would be Steve Harris.

1263
01:28:57,918 --> 01:29:00,779
If we could please have your name and address for the record, please.

1264
01:29:00,799 --> 01:29:10,222
Steve Harris, name and address for the record.

1265
01:29:11,662 --> 01:29:14,704
President Falco takes the bus every day.

1266
01:29:14,744 --> 01:29:15,804
I couldn't say a better name,

1267
01:29:18,976 --> 01:29:20,017
I will come back to Steve.

1268
01:29:20,117 --> 01:29:22,678
Nate Merritt, name and address for the record, please.

1269
01:29:24,939 --> 01:29:27,140
Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave in Medford.

1270
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:31,102
Thank you all for taking my comments.

1271
01:29:31,602 --> 01:29:36,904
Just for a point of information for Councilor Martz, last time I checked, the fire department also runs 24-7, 365.

1272
01:29:37,164 --> 01:29:42,187
So that would be two departments minimum in your city, not just the police department.

1273
01:29:42,447 --> 01:29:44,087
But just wanted to give credit where it's due.

1274
01:29:45,862 --> 01:29:50,610
I actually have a very personal story and I know some of you on the council have known me for a number of years.

1275
01:29:51,451 --> 01:29:54,937
Last Wednesday, someone decided to break into my home.

1276
01:29:55,798 --> 01:29:57,801
I have a wife, I have a baby on the way.

1277
01:29:58,965 --> 01:30:08,708
And I will tell you that the Medford police responded very quickly, very professionally, and we couldn't thank them enough for being available as quick as they were.

1278
01:30:09,408 --> 01:30:11,508
I'm from a small town in Western Massachusetts.

1279
01:30:12,209 --> 01:30:18,910
I'm very familiar with, you know, how it can be where you live in a town where it can take 10 minutes, right?

1280
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:20,971
10 minutes for help to arrive.

1281
01:30:21,809 --> 01:30:23,070
And it's just sheer distance.

1282
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:26,992
It's not because there's, you know, it's a lack of budget, but it's also sheer distance.

1283
01:30:27,032 --> 01:30:34,115
And if someone's on the wrong side of town or the opposite side of town, it's just sheer distance versus time versus how fast can they go down the road.

1284
01:30:35,596 --> 01:30:41,579
People in the Eastern Massachusetts area should be very thankful for the fact that they have the resources they do.

1285
01:30:41,659 --> 01:30:45,101
You don't have volunteer fire departments in the greater Boston area.

1286
01:30:45,501 --> 01:30:47,722
You do up on the North shore, you do in Western Mass.

1287
01:30:48,162 --> 01:30:49,283
When I lived in Syracuse,

1288
01:30:50,573 --> 01:30:54,814
I know what it's like to have sheriffs respond because you don't have a local police force.

1289
01:30:55,654 --> 01:31:00,516
And when someone needs your help, it, you know, minutes seem like hours.

1290
01:31:01,136 --> 01:31:02,536
I'm a public servant myself.

1291
01:31:02,616 --> 01:31:03,657
I'm an EMT basic.

1292
01:31:03,697 --> 01:31:05,297
I've been one for over 20 years.

1293
01:31:05,937 --> 01:31:08,698
There are probably people, you know, that have been helped trained by me.

1294
01:31:10,608 --> 01:31:21,021
I just want to say that I would take very much a bit of caution when we start talking about removing funding or reappropriating funding from your public services here.

1295
01:31:21,041 --> 01:31:23,564
I'm a taxpayer just like everyone else.

1296
01:31:24,285 --> 01:31:25,807
I want to use money efficiently.

1297
01:31:27,052 --> 01:31:40,257
and put it in the right spot, but we shouldn't be having knee-jerk reactions because when you want the help, there is nothing that you will want to stand in your way to enable them to come help you.

1298
01:31:40,357 --> 01:31:47,780
So before we say we're going to reappropriate funding and reduce funding, instead, let's try to look at problems that need to be solved.

1299
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:55,042
I don't disagree with anyone that's talking about, lack of better term, cleaning up the act when there's bad behavior.

1300
01:31:57,678 --> 01:32:02,421
the police that we have here, in my opinion, are already overtaxed to begin with.

1301
01:32:03,001 --> 01:32:07,663
And when seconds are counting, you're gonna want the help when you can get it.

1302
01:32:07,924 --> 01:32:11,005
So again, thank you.

1303
01:32:11,385 --> 01:32:17,249
My personal thanks to Medford PD for responding as quickly as they did, being professional as they were.

1304
01:32:17,909 --> 01:32:24,712
And to Councilor Scarpelli's point, I'd actually like to be very much part of that public discussion that occurs,

1305
01:32:27,034 --> 01:32:28,575
the police department and whatnot.

1306
01:32:29,656 --> 01:32:38,400
And also, just a note for counselor Knight, you can use the dialing number for Zoom and it might be a good alternative.

1307
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:42,602
I know being a person that used it myself a lot for meetings, that's a good alternative.

1308
01:32:42,622 --> 01:32:46,564
You can call in on your cell phone and sometimes you have a much more reliable connection.

1309
01:32:46,945 --> 01:32:51,067
You can still keep the video up on internet, but at least you can get your audio through without having a text message.

1310
01:32:51,767 --> 01:32:52,327
Thank you very much.

1311
01:32:57,731 --> 01:32:59,052
Okay, any other questions in the council?

1312
01:33:02,093 --> 01:33:07,496
Mr. Kleiner, we thank you for bringing this issue forward tonight and talking about this.

1313
01:33:08,056 --> 01:33:11,798
And we appreciate you weighing in and appreciate the comments from the councilors as well.

1314
01:33:12,619 --> 01:33:12,979
Thank you.

1315
01:33:16,641 --> 01:33:19,082
Mr. Clerk, are the records the...

1316
01:33:23,952 --> 01:33:24,493
Mr. President?

1317
01:33:25,073 --> 01:33:25,293
Yes.

1318
01:33:26,474 --> 01:33:27,935
You asked about the records?

1319
01:33:28,816 --> 01:33:29,036
Yes.

1320
01:33:29,096 --> 01:33:31,218
Is that the next thing left on the agenda?

1321
01:33:31,338 --> 01:33:39,244
Yeah, unless there's anybody else who wants to speak in the public participation part of the records of the next... I didn't see anyone else, but if there is, they're more than welcome to.

1322
01:33:39,364 --> 01:33:40,185
Let's check again.

1323
01:33:40,205 --> 01:33:42,206
Does anybody else want to speak on that last issue?

1324
01:33:44,248 --> 01:33:44,988
I don't see anybody else.

1325
01:33:45,049 --> 01:33:46,089
I don't see any other hands raised.

1326
01:33:46,650 --> 01:33:47,550
Hearing and seeing none.

1327
01:33:48,151 --> 01:33:48,611
Records.

1328
01:33:48,731 --> 01:33:50,613
The records from the meeting of

1329
01:33:52,058 --> 01:33:56,900
The table records from the meeting of June 2nd, 2020 were passed to Councilor Knight.

1330
01:33:57,140 --> 01:33:58,860
Councilor Knight, how did you find those records?

1331
01:34:00,621 --> 01:34:04,602
Councilor Falco, Councilor Knight has no, I think he's out.

1332
01:34:05,142 --> 01:34:07,463
I'm good, I have audio.

1333
01:34:07,963 --> 01:34:09,764
If I turn on my video, I have no audio.

1334
01:34:09,824 --> 01:34:12,105
And if I turn on my audio, my video gets messed up.

1335
01:34:12,425 --> 01:34:14,445
But I find the records in order to move for approval.

1336
01:34:15,426 --> 01:34:18,167
On the motion of Councilor Knight to approve the record, seconded by?

1337
01:34:18,687 --> 01:34:18,967
Second.

1338
01:34:19,067 --> 01:34:19,347
Second.

1339
01:34:20,162 --> 01:34:22,003
Councilor Scarpelli, Clerk Caterby, please call the roll.

1340
01:34:23,043 --> 01:34:23,624
Councilor Behrs?

1341
01:34:24,584 --> 01:34:24,824
Yes.

1342
01:34:25,505 --> 01:34:26,425
Vice President Caravaglia?

1343
01:34:26,805 --> 01:34:27,025
Yes.

1344
01:34:27,826 --> 01:34:28,366
Councilor Knight?

1345
01:34:32,468 --> 01:34:34,369
Councilor Knight did text me earlier to say yes.

1346
01:34:36,690 --> 01:34:37,330
Councilor Morrell?

1347
01:34:38,131 --> 01:34:38,391
Yes.

1348
01:34:38,911 --> 01:34:39,712
Councilor Scarpelli?

1349
01:34:40,012 --> 01:34:40,312
Yes.

1350
01:34:41,633 --> 01:34:42,333
President Falco?

1351
01:34:42,825 --> 01:34:45,527
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1352
01:34:45,567 --> 01:34:47,248
You may have skipped over me, Mr. Clerk.

1353
01:34:47,468 --> 01:34:48,969
I apologize, Councilor Marks.

1354
01:34:49,610 --> 01:34:51,091
I did skip over you.

1355
01:34:51,111 --> 01:34:51,811
Councilor Marks.

1356
01:34:52,732 --> 01:34:53,312
What would you like?

1357
01:34:53,653 --> 01:34:55,874
You should vote no just because on that one.

1358
01:34:57,295 --> 01:34:57,715
Yes.

1359
01:34:57,735 --> 01:35:03,920
Motion to adjourn.

1360
01:35:04,937 --> 01:35:06,979
There's another set of records.

1361
01:35:07,339 --> 01:35:10,141
We're in the negative, the motion passes, the records are approved.

1362
01:35:10,762 --> 01:35:13,704
The records of the meeting of June 9th were passed to Council of Marks.

1363
01:35:13,764 --> 01:35:15,685
Council of Marks, how did you find those records?

1364
01:35:16,546 --> 01:35:18,568
Mr. President, I didn't have a chance to review.

1365
01:35:18,648 --> 01:35:20,649
I would ask that they lay on the table.

1366
01:35:21,430 --> 01:35:25,773
Okay, on the motion of Council of Marks to table the records to next week, seconded by?

1367
01:35:26,273 --> 01:35:26,754
Second.

1368
01:35:27,454 --> 01:35:28,415
That's Oscar Pelley.

1369
01:35:28,455 --> 01:35:29,656
Clerk Hernandez, please call the roll.

1370
01:35:33,683 --> 01:35:34,263
Councilor Behrs?

1371
01:35:35,244 --> 01:35:35,504
Yes.

1372
01:35:36,044 --> 01:35:37,025
Vice President Carabiello?

1373
01:35:37,265 --> 01:35:37,505
Yes.

1374
01:35:38,145 --> 01:35:38,666
Councilor Knight?

1375
01:35:43,508 --> 01:35:44,129
Councilor Marks?

1376
01:35:44,649 --> 01:35:44,949
Yes.

1377
01:35:45,529 --> 01:35:46,150
Councilor Morrell?

1378
01:35:46,770 --> 01:35:47,030
Yes.

1379
01:35:47,651 --> 01:35:48,471
Councilor Scarpelli?

1380
01:35:48,671 --> 01:35:48,931
Yes.

1381
01:35:49,572 --> 01:35:50,372
President Falco?

1382
01:35:51,072 --> 01:35:51,313
Yes.

1383
01:35:51,973 --> 01:36:00,417
Just in case I don't have a... Oh, we're getting from Councilor Knight to table.

1384
01:36:02,819 --> 01:36:03,159
Is that him?

1385
01:36:08,263 --> 01:36:12,985
He was indicating approval before the motion to table, but there's a different motion.

1386
01:36:13,025 --> 01:36:16,367
So mark him as because of an internet connection.

1387
01:36:17,308 --> 01:36:17,768
Oh, hang on.

1388
01:36:18,108 --> 01:36:18,748
Yes, table.

1389
01:36:18,788 --> 01:36:19,149
There we go.

1390
01:36:19,169 --> 01:36:19,689
I got a text.

1391
01:36:20,469 --> 01:36:21,190
Yes.

1392
01:36:22,370 --> 01:36:24,851
Seven, the affirmative, zero, the negative.

1393
01:36:24,931 --> 01:36:28,653
The records are tabled from the meeting of June 9th.

1394
01:36:34,007 --> 01:36:35,568
That's the last item on the agenda, Mr. President.

1395
01:36:35,828 --> 01:36:36,368
That is everything.

1396
01:36:36,428 --> 01:36:40,549
Okay, is there a motion to adjourn?

1397
01:36:40,569 --> 01:36:41,289
Motion to adjourn.

1398
01:36:41,930 --> 01:36:45,951
On the motion of Councilor Behrs to adjourn the meeting seconded by Vice President Caravaglio.

1399
01:36:46,951 --> 01:36:48,012
Clerk Cunningham, please call the roll.

1400
01:36:51,493 --> 01:36:52,033
Councilor Behrs?

1401
01:36:52,913 --> 01:36:53,193
Yes.

1402
01:36:53,794 --> 01:36:54,674
Vice President Caravaglio?

1403
01:36:55,094 --> 01:36:55,354
Yes.

1404
01:36:56,154 --> 01:36:57,855
I have a text from Councilor Knight saying yes.

1405
01:37:00,002 --> 01:37:00,603
Councilor Marks?

1406
01:37:00,963 --> 01:37:01,263
Yes.

1407
01:37:02,024 --> 01:37:02,725
Councilor Morrell?

1408
01:37:03,445 --> 01:37:03,706
Yes.

1409
01:37:04,206 --> 01:37:05,027
Councilor Scarpelli?

1410
01:37:05,728 --> 01:37:06,048
Yes.

1411
01:37:06,448 --> 01:37:07,209
President Falco?

1412
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:10,292
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

1413
01:37:10,332 --> 01:37:11,213
The motion passes.

1414
01:37:11,253 --> 01:37:12,675
The meeting is adjourned.

1415
01:37:13,415 --> 01:37:17,439
Stay tuned for the budget schedule, which will hopefully come out within the next day or so.

1416
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:19,762
I thank everyone for tuning in tonight.

1417
01:37:20,462 --> 01:37:21,223
Thank you and good night.

1418
01:37:21,403 --> 01:37:21,784
Stay safe.

1419
01:37:21,804 --> 01:37:22,184
Thank you.

1420
01:37:22,464 --> 01:37:23,125
Healthy, thank you.
