[SPEAKER_06]: 20-420, offered by Vice President Caraviello.

30
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:15,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas the City of Medford is in a fiscal budget emergency,

31
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:25,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the mayor be requested to appropriate with the city council approval the necessary amount of free cash to address the municipal in-school budget deficits.

32
00:02:25,628 --> 00:02:34,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it further that the mayor be requested to replenish this account with any budget aid that it receives from the federal government or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

33
00:02:34,492 --> 00:02:39,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it further resolved that the mayor respond to this request by next Tuesday's city council meeting.

34
00:02:42,206 --> 00:02:43,267
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

35
00:02:43,327 --> 00:02:55,156
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I know this is a request that should be coming from the mayor, but I thought that it was appropriate that I put it out there this week in order to maybe speed the process up for the mayor.

36
00:02:56,137 --> 00:02:59,099
[SPEAKER_18]: I was informed today that 130 teachers were let go.

37
00:03:02,412 --> 00:03:06,834
[SPEAKER_18]: They were non-professionals, and these are difficult times.

38
00:03:07,614 --> 00:03:11,576
[SPEAKER_18]: We do have a decent amount in free cash.

39
00:03:11,616 --> 00:03:30,503
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not recommending that you use the whole amount, but use an amount that she's deemed necessary in order to maybe save the jobs of some teachers and guidance Councilors, because I think we've all started getting the emails from people about the layoffs of the children.

40
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:38,915
[SPEAKER_18]: So Mr. President, and I also like to make one more statement for the viewing public.

41
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:43,182
[SPEAKER_18]: The city council does not do the school committee budget.

42
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:53,551
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, the the budget is done by them only we've i've been getting emails from people saying that the city council has cut the jobs of teachers We do not do that.

43
00:03:54,031 --> 00:04:10,142
[SPEAKER_18]: The budget comes from the school committee, uh that we haven't even seen yet So please understand the process to the people that are sending out emails school committee does their budget and submits it to us At which point we do not have the ability to add any funds to it.

44
00:04:10,502 --> 00:04:11,523
[SPEAKER_18]: We can make suggestions

45
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:15,240
[SPEAKER_18]: ability to cut funds out of the budget.

46
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:23,583
[SPEAKER_18]: So I wanted people to understand that because the emails are starting to pour in, thinking that it's the city council that cut all these people's jobs and it wasn't.

47
00:04:24,124 --> 00:04:32,547
[SPEAKER_18]: So, but again, I opened this up for discussion with my fellow councillors and maybe this will speed the process up for the mayor a little bit.

48
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,108
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

49
00:04:34,428 --> 00:04:35,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

50
00:04:35,628 --> 00:04:39,550
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Morell, Councilor Bears, Councilor Scarpelli.

51
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:44,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Councilor Caraviello for bringing this forward.

52
00:04:44,476 --> 00:05:00,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that to jump to my second piece, I did receive a bunch of emails that a school committee member sent out stating this year we are facing a $3.5 million budget

53
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:10,944
[SPEAKER_07]: that the cuts are right now, the school committee and superintendent cannot direct city funding, only the mayor and the city council.

54
00:05:11,405 --> 00:05:22,873
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's happening is people taking that comment, whichever way that school member meant to put that out there, the way that it's going out to the public is again, it's starting that divide.

55
00:05:23,974 --> 00:05:25,755
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what's wrong with the city council?

56
00:05:26,196 --> 00:05:27,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are you not funding these people?

57
00:05:28,543 --> 00:05:29,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Why, what are you doing?

58
00:05:30,304 --> 00:05:30,964
[SPEAKER_07]: We need this.

59
00:05:31,744 --> 00:05:39,788
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, it's been a very difficult last couple of weeks, but I tell you what, this is where we do not have to go as a community.

60
00:05:40,728 --> 00:05:41,909
[SPEAKER_07]: This is so disheartening.

61
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:47,431
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, Councilor Falco, the One Medford, it's so farthest from the truth right now.

62
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:48,531
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so disheartening.

63
00:05:48,872 --> 00:05:51,673
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I've heard for the last three nights especially.

64
00:05:52,293 --> 00:05:56,355
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm telling you that please, maybe the city solicitor,

65
00:05:57,143 --> 00:06:10,388
[SPEAKER_07]: can reach out to the mayor with a highlight of what the role of the city council is during the budget in comparison to the school department.

66
00:06:11,148 --> 00:06:18,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know when we were on the school committee, we were given a tutorial and we understood exactly what the process was.

67
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Brings me to my first point.

68
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:26,194
[SPEAKER_07]: In the late 1990s, early 2000s, I was given my pink slip as a teacher in the city of Medford.

69
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:31,098
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably the most devastating feeling you'll ever, ever feel.

70
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:33,059
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a helpless feeling.

71
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,381
[SPEAKER_07]: And I, too, are getting all the emails.

72
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:43,525
[SPEAKER_07]: I have former colleagues calling me and relatives calling me and saying, George, what are we doing?

73
00:06:45,566 --> 00:06:51,150
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll know more as soon as we start our process on Saturday, I believe.

74
00:06:52,027 --> 00:06:56,990
[SPEAKER_07]: if you correct me from wrong, I believe we're starting our process on Saturday on the city side.

75
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:58,170
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

76
00:06:58,691 --> 00:07:10,497
[SPEAKER_07]: But I want people to understand, we as a council will do everything we can to make sure that we're supporting our colleagues in city government.

77
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:18,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that as myself, I'm speaking for myself, but I have skin in the game like most of our councils here.

78
00:07:19,408 --> 00:07:23,171
[SPEAKER_07]: We have children that are in the school system.

79
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:25,632
[SPEAKER_07]: My son's a senior.

80
00:07:25,652 --> 00:07:31,656
[SPEAKER_07]: When I found out today, one of the cuts is we do not have a head of guidance at Medford High School.

81
00:07:32,457 --> 00:07:33,417
[SPEAKER_07]: To me, that's appalling.

82
00:07:34,498 --> 00:07:41,303
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's terrible, especially what we're seeing, what's going to happen as kids return back to school.

83
00:07:43,152 --> 00:07:53,139
[SPEAKER_07]: with the COVID crisis and not having someone in that position to lead what needs to be led is to me a very, very slippery slope.

84
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:03,547
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, again, I have to sit back as a Councilor and look at this objectively and say, this is very difficult.

85
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:07,850
[SPEAKER_07]: We're asking the school system to cut three and a half million dollars from a budget.

86
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:23,770
[SPEAKER_07]: So everybody's, I've also gotten contact that, you know, I got one email saying that we drastically underfund the school system for years while the city gets fatter and fatter.

87
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:27,413
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it was meant literally, but I'm going to tell you something.

88
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:34,137
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't been, we are on, we are on a thin line when it comes to fire, police, DPW.

89
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:39,361
[SPEAKER_07]: But we also will be looking at the same difficulties

90
00:08:40,344 --> 00:08:41,225
[SPEAKER_07]: in the next few weeks.

91
00:08:42,586 --> 00:08:49,633
[SPEAKER_07]: So I caution everybody to be alarmed, because I'm alarmed as a parent.

92
00:08:50,414 --> 00:08:54,158
[SPEAKER_07]: As my former colleagues and friends, they're alarmed as teachers.

93
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,882
[SPEAKER_07]: The word gets out to the children, they're alarmed.

94
00:08:57,922 --> 00:09:00,825
[SPEAKER_07]: My children are alarmed from what they've heard some of the teachers that were cut.

95
00:09:01,685 --> 00:09:02,606
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I'm saying is,

96
00:09:03,621 --> 00:09:04,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's stay focused.

97
00:09:05,063 --> 00:09:19,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's try to get through the next couple of weeks the best we can, not pitting each other against each other, and try to find a way that we can all work together and try to do the best we can in these trying, trying times.

98
00:09:20,098 --> 00:09:24,181
[SPEAKER_07]: We're no different than Brookline or Winchester or Somerville.

99
00:09:24,422 --> 00:09:26,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's cutting, everybody.

100
00:09:27,304 --> 00:09:38,353
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know we're all waiting for the governor to come down and say, if the federal government's not gonna do it, I'm gonna pull a billion dollars out of the rainy day account, and I'm gonna fund education.

101
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:43,958
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna send funding right down to the cities and towns to bring them back.

102
00:09:44,378 --> 00:09:45,960
[SPEAKER_07]: We can only hope, we can wish,

103
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,411
[SPEAKER_07]: but that's a possibility.

104
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:59,519
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, I'm gonna say it again, please, we've often had school commembers on this meeting in these falls.

105
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,923
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope somebody's here so they can bring it back to their colleagues.

106
00:10:04,523 --> 00:10:09,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Please do not scream the sky is falling and point fingers.

107
00:10:10,628 --> 00:10:13,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's take a deep breath as a community

108
00:10:15,357 --> 00:10:21,318
[SPEAKER_07]: find a way to bring it all together, working together to do what's best for our whole community.

109
00:10:22,218 --> 00:10:23,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

110
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:25,339
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

111
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,159
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Morell.

112
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:29,320
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

113
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,420
[SPEAKER_17]: So I thank Vice President Caraviello for bringing this forward, but I just have one concern with this.

114
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:43,162
[SPEAKER_17]: So it was my understanding that at our most recent budget update, our independent auditor suggested that we use the free cash a certain amount, I think,

115
00:10:43,865 --> 00:10:46,265
[SPEAKER_17]: $6 million or somewhere around there was referenced.

116
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:55,027
[SPEAKER_17]: Obviously that's up to the mayor, but because we could get enough local receipts back to bring us back to the level we're at now and maintain our bond rating.

117
00:10:55,667 --> 00:11:11,770
[SPEAKER_17]: So considering cuts are already being made that have been referenced and the fact that school will be much more expensive to run, it doesn't seem to me to be in the best interest of our city and our schools to then take any money we might get from a bailout and put that back into free cash.

118
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:35,250
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel like because the independent auditor said we're able to get back up to a good level with the receipts coming in, that money that, you know, again, we don't know if this money is ever coming, but if it does come, that be put back in to make up for those cuts that are already happening and bring people on and secure people's jobs and make sure our school is prepared and our city services are prepared for this coming fall.

119
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:40,814
[SPEAKER_17]: So unless it's amended, I can't vote for this at this point, just because I don't think

120
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:46,562
[SPEAKER_17]: that taking that money and not applying it where it's most needed is the most prudent decision.

121
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:47,703
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

122
00:11:48,804 --> 00:11:49,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

123
00:11:50,885 --> 00:11:51,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears.

124
00:11:52,626 --> 00:11:53,527
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

125
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,830
[SPEAKER_15]: I thank everyone who's spoken so far.

126
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:03,934
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree with Councilor Morell's concern around that this money might be better used.

127
00:12:04,494 --> 00:12:05,955
[SPEAKER_15]: I think one of the big concerns right now

128
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:13,466
[SPEAKER_15]: is the average estimate for a school district to go back to school with all the COVID stuff is over a million and a half dollars.

129
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:15,206
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that stands for Medford as well.

130
00:12:15,826 --> 00:12:19,348
[SPEAKER_15]: So, we're in a bad place.

131
00:12:19,868 --> 00:12:22,409
[SPEAKER_15]: We're cutting significant amounts from the budget.

132
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:31,072
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, as Councilor Morell said, and I think as Councilor Caraviellola's motion is intended, the plan is already to cover the deficit with free cash.

133
00:12:31,713 --> 00:12:42,801
[SPEAKER_15]: even with that in place, we're seeing big cuts and layoffs and positions that won't get filled and, you know, seniors who won't have guidance Councilors, you know, head of guidance, I should say.

134
00:12:42,921 --> 00:12:46,864
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's, you know, the free cash won't get us out of this.

135
00:12:47,444 --> 00:12:53,729
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not enough to stop cuts on the school side or the city side, which are already in a desperate place.

136
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:57,011
[SPEAKER_15]: So yeah, it's certainly, you know,

137
00:12:57,387 --> 00:12:59,328
[SPEAKER_15]: We can't be making cuts like this right now.

138
00:12:59,388 --> 00:13:09,934
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that we're in a difficult budget situation, but these are essential services and, you know, students are gonna need more, the city's gonna need more, and we're gonna be asking people to do more with less.

139
00:13:10,014 --> 00:13:12,775
[SPEAKER_15]: And we know how that turns out and how that's turned out historically.

140
00:13:13,055 --> 00:13:16,897
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, there's not enough free cash to fix this problem is my understanding.

141
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:17,718
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope that changes.

142
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:20,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

143
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:22,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Carvill.

144
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:27,294
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, Mr. President, you know, Councilor Bears and Councilor Murdoch make good points.

145
00:13:27,654 --> 00:13:31,335
[SPEAKER_18]: There's not enough money here to fix this problem.

146
00:13:31,675 --> 00:13:36,656
[SPEAKER_18]: But again, we've already done our major borrowing for the City of Bedford.

147
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:45,559
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I mean, the library's been funded, the police station's been funded, so there's no big borrowing projects currently on the horizon right now.

148
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:49,980
[SPEAKER_18]: So, and let's say, money is at its lowest point ever.

149
00:13:53,168 --> 00:13:58,312
[SPEAKER_18]: If this be the case, the mayor is only going to have to come to us and ask us for this money anyways.

150
00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:07,739
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm trying to give her the leverage so she doesn't have to come to us at budget time.

151
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:14,485
[SPEAKER_18]: I know she's talked about spending $6.5 million, but again, you're going to have to vote on this coming down the line.

152
00:14:15,837 --> 00:14:21,258
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you say you're not going to vote for her because you don't have enough money, then I'm a little confused.

153
00:14:21,298 --> 00:14:24,599
[SPEAKER_18]: But I'm looking to save as many jobs as I can.

154
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:28,320
[SPEAKER_18]: And let me tell you, this is something I haven't supported in the past.

155
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,941
[SPEAKER_18]: I voted against this myself in the past.

156
00:14:32,901 --> 00:14:35,522
[SPEAKER_18]: But again, these are difficult times.

157
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:41,103
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think we're doing the prudent thing going forward.

158
00:14:42,887 --> 00:14:43,508
[SPEAKER_18]: for the time being.

159
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:46,971
[SPEAKER_18]: And let's say any money comes in, should be replenished back into free cash.

160
00:14:48,051 --> 00:14:49,913
[SPEAKER_18]: And the word free, it's the people's money.

161
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:51,034
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not free.

162
00:14:51,114 --> 00:14:52,255
[SPEAKER_18]: Nothing in this world is free.

163
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:59,821
[SPEAKER_18]: So please don't, I don't know where that term ever came from, but it belongs to the residents of Medford and we should use it as we see fit.

164
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:02,403
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's all I have to say, Mr. President, at the moment.

165
00:15:02,824 --> 00:15:04,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

166
00:15:04,025 --> 00:15:05,886
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Councilor Morell and then Councilor Marks.

167
00:15:06,286 --> 00:15:06,827
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Morell.

168
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:08,244
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

169
00:15:08,264 --> 00:15:09,805
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I just wanted to clarify what I was saying.

170
00:15:09,845 --> 00:15:12,647
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not saying I'm going to vote against the mayor using free cash.

171
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:29,955
[SPEAKER_17]: What I'm saying is the way this current resolution is written, the second part I do disagree with because I think if a federal bailout or a state level bailout or something comes down, that money should then be applied to the cuts that have already been made and to secure positions within the schools in the city.

172
00:15:30,015 --> 00:15:31,616
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's where my level of disagreement is.

173
00:15:31,676 --> 00:15:32,937
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to vote against

174
00:15:33,424 --> 00:15:37,827
[SPEAKER_17]: free cash, but just the way this resolution is written, I don't agree with the second part.

175
00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:39,128
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just want to clarify that.

176
00:15:39,348 --> 00:15:39,848
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

177
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:41,309
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

178
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:41,990
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Marks.

179
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:59,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, also to clarify, the 6 point whatever it was, 2 or 3 million that the mayor did say she was going to take out of free cash does not change any of the circumstances which are currently taking place right now, which are the cuts within the city.

180
00:16:00,101 --> 00:16:00,921
[SPEAKER_05]: and the school side.

181
00:16:01,481 --> 00:16:04,262
[SPEAKER_05]: So anything else that happens would be in addition to that.

182
00:16:05,342 --> 00:16:09,403
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we've got to be mindful that six million brings us to where we are right now.

183
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:12,544
[SPEAKER_05]: And many of us want to go further than that.

184
00:16:13,064 --> 00:16:16,425
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, we're going to have to wait and see.

185
00:16:16,485 --> 00:16:18,166
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it is a wait and see game right now.

186
00:16:18,506 --> 00:16:27,848
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been saying that for the last month and a half regarding local receipts and regarding, you know, hopefully some type of bailout and so forth.

187
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:30,108
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my hope, Mr. President.

188
00:16:30,469 --> 00:16:30,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

189
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:32,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

190
00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:35,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody else like to speak on this issue?

191
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:40,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Clerk Cernovich, have you received any emails on this?

192
00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:45,852
[SPEAKER_09]: I have not, Mr. President.

193
00:16:47,293 --> 00:16:49,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other comments from the public?

194
00:16:50,894 --> 00:16:51,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a comment, Mr. President.

195
00:16:52,194 --> 00:16:52,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

196
00:16:52,894 --> 00:16:53,814
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, Councilor Knight?

197
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard anything for the last 20 minutes.

198
00:16:58,062 --> 00:17:00,463
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm having significant technical difficulties.

199
00:17:00,523 --> 00:17:02,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just sitting here looking at frozen screens.

200
00:17:02,303 --> 00:17:05,804
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I ask for your leadership moving forward to get us back into council chambers.

201
00:17:06,224 --> 00:17:06,945
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying my best.

202
00:17:07,565 --> 00:17:09,565
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully we'll have an update for you tomorrow.

203
00:17:13,486 --> 00:17:14,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you hear us?

204
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:17,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Somewhat, Mr. President, somewhat.

205
00:17:18,348 --> 00:17:19,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move to the question.

206
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:26,310
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, on the motion of Vice President Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

207
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:29,338
[SPEAKER_10]: I got nothing to say.

208
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:30,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

209
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:36,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by... Does this resolution have a second?

210
00:17:38,382 --> 00:17:44,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I'm uncomfortable seconding it, Mr. President, because I missed the whole entire presentation.

211
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:44,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President.

212
00:17:48,386 --> 00:17:49,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

213
00:17:50,047 --> 00:17:56,829
[SPEAKER_05]: If I could, Mr. President, I know where Councilor Caraviello, Vice President Caraviello is coming from with this.

214
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:04,813
[SPEAKER_05]: We were told a couple of weeks ago that the mayor was committing, I think it was 6.2 or 6.5 million from free cash.

215
00:18:05,393 --> 00:18:07,934
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not quite sure what this resolution does.

216
00:18:09,094 --> 00:18:10,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Only the mayor can appropriate

217
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:22,442
[SPEAKER_05]: The council could not appropriate we can make recommendations So i'm not quite sure if this is just a feel-good type thing Um, and even then it doesn't feel good because the cuts are still taking place.

218
00:18:22,462 --> 00:18:26,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I'm not i'm not quite sure what this actually does.

219
00:18:27,586 --> 00:18:39,854
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, Vice president carriell, mr. President again, uh at some point the mayor will have to come to us for this money uh, but I I think that uh,

220
00:18:40,557 --> 00:18:47,426
[SPEAKER_18]: If I'm hearing correctly, I don't know when she comes to us if we're going to support it.

221
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:57,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think what Councilor Mark said, I mean, to me, the responsibility is of the mayor to come to us.

222
00:18:58,574 --> 00:18:59,494
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that.

223
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:00,495
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that.

224
00:19:01,195 --> 00:19:03,096
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand what you're trying to do.

225
00:19:03,116 --> 00:19:04,416
[SPEAKER_06]: You're trying to reach out.

226
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:12,819
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, I think that the request has to come from the administration as to how they want to kind of bridge the gap.

227
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli would like to make a comment.

228
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

229
00:19:16,081 --> 00:19:20,402
[SPEAKER_07]: If I can, I thank you, Mr. President and Vice President Caraviello.

230
00:19:20,422 --> 00:19:25,244
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand what you're saying, but I would, after we go through our process,

231
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:35,532
[SPEAKER_07]: I would also support the mayor in looking at free cash to assist us in this financial dilemma.

232
00:19:35,552 --> 00:19:44,355
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think right now, not knowing what's happening and to take from

233
00:19:45,032 --> 00:19:50,474
[SPEAKER_07]: ask her to come back and take more with the negative ramifications, especially with our bond rating.

234
00:19:51,414 --> 00:19:52,275
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't support this.

235
00:19:52,335 --> 00:20:00,078
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that, you know, I at least want to sit through Saturday's meeting to see how bad, you know, how bad things look on the city side.

236
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:13,703
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the reason why I, not to say that I wouldn't support it moving forward, but right now, like I said, it's, we need to take a deep breath and hear all the sides and then figure this out.

237
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:14,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

238
00:20:15,323 --> 00:20:16,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

239
00:20:16,443 --> 00:20:17,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears.

240
00:20:18,865 --> 00:20:20,546
[SPEAKER_15]: Just a question for you, actually, Mr. President.

241
00:20:21,507 --> 00:20:22,587
[SPEAKER_15]: What is the plan schedule?

242
00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:23,908
[SPEAKER_15]: Just, you know, public's watching.

243
00:20:23,928 --> 00:20:24,989
[SPEAKER_15]: We're talking about the debate.

244
00:20:25,009 --> 00:20:26,470
[SPEAKER_15]: We're talking about our meeting Saturday.

245
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,651
[SPEAKER_15]: What's our plan there?

246
00:20:27,671 --> 00:20:28,952
[SPEAKER_15]: What's the schedule for those meetings?

247
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:33,495
[SPEAKER_06]: So I did hear back from the chief of staff today.

248
00:20:34,055 --> 00:20:43,141
[SPEAKER_06]: So I believe what we're going to do is meet on Saturday with, I think it's going to be police, fire, DPW, and then

249
00:20:45,274 --> 00:20:54,118
[SPEAKER_06]: The next meeting will probably be probably next Monday and probably do committee on Tuesday and maybe next Wednesday.

250
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:57,840
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't kind of got that far yet as far as the scheduling piece goes.

251
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:02,854
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as getting it to City Hall, I'm working on that as well.

252
00:21:03,254 --> 00:21:11,601
[SPEAKER_06]: And as far as budget books, I've been told we should receive a budget book Thursday afternoon.

253
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:15,604
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my concerns is if we don't get a budget book,

254
00:21:16,215 --> 00:21:26,624
[SPEAKER_06]: until Thursday night, is that going to give the council enough time to review to take up police fire in DPW, which is kind of like the big three on Saturday.

255
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:28,365
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's my concern.

256
00:21:28,385 --> 00:21:40,295
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of wrestling with whether or not, you know, if we don't get that budget book, I mean, I want to make sure to me, the way I look at it is this, especially if we're going to be looking at a budget, we want to make sure that the council has enough time

257
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:51,413
[SPEAKER_06]: to look at the budget for those departments that we're going to meet with on Saturday to process the information and ask, you know, good questions and have a good, you know, truthful discussion.

258
00:21:51,994 --> 00:21:58,362
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if we get the budget book, you know, late, that's not going to be beneficial to anyone that's involved in this process.

259
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Mr. President.

260
00:22:00,223 --> 00:22:01,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information.

261
00:22:01,644 --> 00:22:06,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so you know, to some of us, Thursday afternoon is the same as Thursday night.

262
00:22:06,766 --> 00:22:08,407
[SPEAKER_05]: That happened to be working.

263
00:22:09,988 --> 00:22:11,789
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not much of a difference to me.

264
00:22:12,129 --> 00:22:14,170
[SPEAKER_05]: That's still late in the game.

265
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:28,057
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate you've been, of all people, you've been pushing for this for so long, but it really gives us very little time and such a pressing budget to take a look at it Thursday night and then Saturday morning, early Saturday morning.

266
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:29,519
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's my concern.

267
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:33,080
[SPEAKER_06]: So I, to be, to be honest with you, I apologize for interrupting.

268
00:22:33,721 --> 00:22:43,166
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know yet if that Saturday is going to be police fire and DPW that I think needs to probably be juggled around because of the, uh, the timing of the book.

269
00:22:43,366 --> 00:22:49,269
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't really make sense to have three big departments, you know, and we have minimal time to review.

270
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:53,491
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so I completely hear what you're saying.

271
00:22:53,511 --> 00:22:53,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

272
00:22:54,452 --> 00:22:56,393
[SPEAKER_15]: Just, just for the folks watching.

273
00:22:56,453 --> 00:22:56,553
[SPEAKER_15]: So.

274
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:04,982
[SPEAKER_15]: keep an eye out that, you know, at least as early as Saturday and certainly next week, they're going to be multiple budget meetings held by the council.

275
00:23:05,883 --> 00:23:12,385
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, is the Saturday up in the air still maybe, maybe not, or should people really be preparing for that?

276
00:23:12,785 --> 00:23:13,805
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

277
00:23:14,806 --> 00:23:14,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Good.

278
00:23:15,206 --> 00:23:15,746
[SPEAKER_15]: And just, yeah.

279
00:23:15,846 --> 00:23:20,988
[SPEAKER_15]: And will that be, that'll be public online as well on, on the team.

280
00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:22,208
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all public all the time.

281
00:23:22,648 --> 00:23:22,808
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

282
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:27,530
[SPEAKER_15]: Just wanted to make sure Saturday, Saturday morning cartoons.

283
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,263
[SPEAKER_05]: So when will the budget book be available for the general public?

284
00:23:31,283 --> 00:23:32,124
[SPEAKER_05]: That's another good question.

285
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:35,408
[SPEAKER_05]: I assume when we get it on Thursday, that an electronic copy would go as well.

286
00:23:52,525 --> 00:24:08,845
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's not the case, Mr. President, it's incumbent upon us not to have the meeting on Saturday because I don't think it's fair if we're the only ones that have access to a budget book and then we're inviting the general public to participate and they have no access to the budget.

287
00:24:10,386 --> 00:24:11,427
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's not fair either.

288
00:24:11,467 --> 00:24:21,616
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would say this should be a wait and see, Mr. President, before we set up the date, because that budget book has to be available to everyone in the community, as well as the council.

289
00:24:22,197 --> 00:24:22,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

290
00:24:23,718 --> 00:24:25,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, we get a number of questions.

291
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:25,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

292
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,963
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have Councilor Knight, Vice President Caraviello, Councilor Knight.

293
00:24:30,127 --> 00:24:34,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Mr. President, I think we've taken the wait-and-see approach for quite a bit of time.

294
00:24:34,813 --> 00:24:40,280
[SPEAKER_02]: We have 14 days left before our budget expires, before the close of the fiscal year.

295
00:24:41,101 --> 00:24:42,042
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been very patient.

296
00:24:42,182 --> 00:24:46,207
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been calling for this budget now for the better part of six months.

297
00:24:46,888 --> 00:24:48,390
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a commitment that we were going to get it.

298
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,450
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't gotten it.

299
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,011
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand why.

300
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,431
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a consultant that's given us forecasted revenues.

301
00:24:55,432 --> 00:24:59,393
[SPEAKER_02]: The consultant we're paying money for to do this is the advice that we should be listening to.

302
00:25:00,093 --> 00:25:04,554
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'm very disappointed that we haven't been able to get this budget book.

303
00:25:04,594 --> 00:25:06,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's no reflection of your leadership, Mr. President.

304
00:25:06,915 --> 00:25:08,035
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a reflection of the corner office.

305
00:25:09,015 --> 00:25:12,176
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm very concerned about the direction this community is going in financially.

306
00:25:12,976 --> 00:25:16,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I echo some of the concerns that my colleagues have made relative to

307
00:25:16,737 --> 00:25:20,479
[SPEAKER_02]: the lack of understanding of the school budget process that's going on by some of our elected officials.

308
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:27,043
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, Mr. President, it's going to be very important that we get in there and sit down in a room where we can all work this out.

309
00:25:27,723 --> 00:25:33,166
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, I echo some of the sentiments of my council colleagues, but we need to get this thing moving.

310
00:25:33,267 --> 00:25:35,488
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the administration doesn't want to participate, that's sad.

311
00:25:36,088 --> 00:25:43,892
[SPEAKER_02]: But we need to start calling department heads in and start talking to them about what their needs are, whether or not the administration's ready to provide us with money or not, numbers or not.

312
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,333
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time, Mr. President.

313
00:25:45,353 --> 00:25:47,013
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to address the elephant in the room.

314
00:25:48,334 --> 00:25:49,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

315
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Caraviello?

316
00:25:50,655 --> 00:25:54,517
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I make a motion to withdraw my resolution this evening.

317
00:25:54,957 --> 00:25:55,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

318

[SPEAKER_06]: So the, let's see.

319

[SPEAKER_06]: So, Clerk Hurtubise?

320
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,761
[SPEAKER_15]: It has to be disposed of.

321
00:26:02,301 --> 00:26:03,281
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been introduced.

322
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:04,402
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's been introduced.

323
00:26:05,348 --> 00:26:09,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so it's been introduced, so we want to receive it and place it on file?

324
00:26:10,893 --> 00:26:11,113
[SPEAKER_16]: Fine.

325
00:26:12,775 --> 00:26:13,155
[SPEAKER_16]: That's fine.

326

381
00:28:57,873 --> 00:29:12,301
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be helpful if she provided us with a breakdown of the paper, but it's my understanding that annually we need to appropriate no less than 10 percent of the total CPA revenues to the appropriate category for which they're dedicated, and I do believe that this paper is

382
00:29:14,407 --> 00:29:19,470
[SPEAKER_02]: The goal of this paper is to comply with that, but I'd like to hear from Danielle from OCD, please.

383
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for approval, Mr. President.

384
00:29:21,311 --> 00:29:28,654

388
00:29:35,985 --> 00:29:39,226
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, Danielle Evans, community preservation coordinator.

389
00:29:40,606 --> 00:29:45,828
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe that Alicia is the one that submitted this, but I can definitely speak on behalf of it.

390
00:29:46,428 --> 00:30:00,452
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, this is the statutory minimums, the 10% to the three program categories, 5% that can go to admin, and then the rest goes to the general reserve.

391
00:30:03,974 --> 00:30:07,277
[SPEAKER_12]: actually get to the funding round where decisions are made on projects.

392
00:30:08,138 --> 00:30:23,811
[SPEAKER_12]: That gives us the most flexibility to fund projects that might not necessarily be even split, or just having to move from the different categories.

393
00:30:23,851 --> 00:30:28,074
[SPEAKER_12]: We never know what kind of projects we're gonna get.

[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

400
00:30:41,459 --> 00:31:01,907
[SPEAKER_11]: As you mentioned, this is just the annual appropriation that needs to be made, but I also wanted to let the council know that we have prepared an annual report that reports on our activities from the past year and projects what we have learned that our community needs are for the coming year.

401
00:31:02,447 --> 00:31:09,771
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would invite the council to find that report or people watching this to find that report on the Community Preservation Committee's website.

402
00:31:10,192 --> 00:31:15,475
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would also be happy to send a copy to the councilors if you would appreciate that.

403
00:31:16,155 --> 00:31:20,798
[SPEAKER_11]: And to let people know that the funding round is open for the coming year.

404
00:31:22,263 --> 00:31:37,187
[SPEAKER_11]: So for people who would like to apply for CPA funds using the 2020 funds, that application can now be accessed by the Community Preservation Committee's website, and they can contact Danielle Evans for more information.

405
00:31:38,547 --> 00:31:38,988

[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

421
00:31:58,690 --> 00:31:59,451
[SPEAKER_08]: President Falco?

422
00:32:00,011 --> 00:32:02,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Senator, the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

423
00:32:04,203 --> 00:32:10,128
[SPEAKER_06]: 20-436 to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155.

424
00:32:10,348 --> 00:32:21,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves a supplemental appropriation in the amount of $9,050.35 from premium reserved account 124-145-5971

425
00:32:33,303 --> 00:32:39,824
[SPEAKER_06]: 0000000904 to the General Fund Debt Service Account 010-710-5910.

426
00:32:39,944 --> 00:32:48,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Alicia Nunleaf Benjamin, Finance Director, is present to answer any of the councilor's questions regarding this matter.

427
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:50,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Sincerely, Breanna Lungo-Koehn mayor.

428
00:32:52,907 --> 00:32:53,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

429
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:57,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Alicia.

430
00:32:58,996 --> 00:33:00,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, Councilors.

431
00:33:00,977 --> 00:33:05,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I submitted this paper because we have some interest due on a band.

432
00:33:06,341 --> 00:33:08,383
[SPEAKER_04]: And that band actually sold at a premium of that $9,050.35.

433
00:33:08,943 --> 00:33:19,011
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Massachusetts Municipal Modernization Act that was passed back in 2016 allows for that premium to be used to pay against the debt service.

434
00:33:19,051 --> 00:33:28,298
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I do is I take the premium, I put it in a receipt, and then whenever I have debt service to pay off, I'm going to come before your honorable body to use any premium to pay the debt service down.

435
00:33:31,723 --> 00:33:32,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions from the council?

436
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:34,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Move approval, Mr. President.

437
00:33:35,345 --> 00:33:35,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

438
00:33:36,486 --> 00:33:37,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Question, Mr. President?

439
00:33:37,607 --> 00:33:38,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Councilor Marks.

440
00:33:40,368 --> 00:33:42,389
[SPEAKER_05]: This is kind of new to me.

441
00:33:42,469 --> 00:33:43,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Have we done this in the past?

442
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:50,014
[SPEAKER_04]: In the past, what they used to do was just apply it and just do it themselves without bringing it before you.

443
00:33:50,114 --> 00:33:54,877
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm putting it in receipts reserved for account and coming before you to keep it in a transparent manner.

444
00:33:56,482 --> 00:34:00,765
[SPEAKER_05]: So it does sound unique, and that's why, because it was never presented to us.

445
00:34:01,265 --> 00:34:03,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is a new fund I just created.

446
00:34:03,026 --> 00:34:06,088
[SPEAKER_06]: I second the motion, Mr. President.

447
00:34:06,849 --> 00:34:07,850
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's see.

448
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:15,235
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight, I believe Vice President Caraviello originally seconded it.

449
00:34:16,055 --> 00:34:17,756
[SPEAKER_06]: I third it.

00:34:17,896 --> 00:34:20,818

[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight?

460
00:34:38,891 --> 00:34:40,412
[SPEAKER_08]: He's having troubles, I believe, again.

[SPEAKER_08]: And I've got Councilor Knight, I can see him, can you?

471
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:00,561
[SPEAKER_08]: You sound like you're underwater, but it's a yes vote.

472
00:35:00,982 --> 00:35:01,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

473

480
00:35:20,429 --> 00:35:23,131
[SPEAKER_05]: While we're under suspension, I just want to give my colleagues an update.

481
00:35:24,031 --> 00:35:32,636
[SPEAKER_05]: About four or five weeks ago, I presented to the council, which was unanimously supported regarding the intersection of Salton Main Street.

482
00:35:33,296 --> 00:35:36,378
[SPEAKER_05]: And during my presentation, I mentioned that I was waiting to get

483
00:35:37,238 --> 00:35:41,500
[SPEAKER_05]: feedback from Chief Buckley regarding the number of accidents at that location.

484
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:49,563
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you would indulge me for about 30 seconds, I just want to give you the update to the members of the council.

485
00:35:50,743 --> 00:36:00,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief Buckley looked at two areas of significance that was shown on the accident map, one being Maine and Salt Street.

486
00:36:01,247 --> 00:36:05,431
[SPEAKER_05]: and the other being the surrounding area around Wellington Circle.

487
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:10,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Between the year of 2017 and 2020, there were 139 accidents reported at the area of Main and Salt Street.

488
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:14,138
[SPEAKER_05]: And at Wellington Circle, between that same period, there were 202 accidents, Mr. President.

489
00:36:24,487 --> 00:36:51,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and as you can imagine wellington has many feeder roads that go into wellington circle as well as several routes that run through wellington circle And if you notice the number of accidents, uh, very close in nature, mr President and I think it uh speaks volumes to what we need to do at the corner of salt and maine um, and I just wanted to Uh present that information to my colleagues and I appreciate for you indulging me

490
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:54,460

[SPEAKER_02]: I actually, Mr. President, I'm having a difficult time, so I just wanted to table papers 2-0-4-2-1, 2-0-4-2-3, and 2-0-4-2-5.

496
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:21,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of my connection, you know, I don't want to present a paper that you guys can hear me or that I can't hear you.

497
00:37:21,613 --> 00:37:22,974

[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

549
00:39:41,242 --> 00:39:42,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

550
00:39:43,903 --> 00:39:59,747
[SPEAKER_02]: As we all know, June 6th is the anniversary of D-Day, where many of the young children of the Greatest Generation stormed beaches over in France and fought against the axis of evil to

551
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:06,293
[SPEAKER_02]: make a commitment to freedom, Mr. President.

552
00:40:06,974 --> 00:40:26,245
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, I think it's very important that we recognize the sacrifices that were made by the young men and women during the D-Day invasion and during World War II, and also recognize the fact that the Greatest Generation is something that we should emulate and try to model ourselves upon, especially now during these difficult and trying times that we're facing.

553
00:40:26,802 --> 00:40:35,346
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, I asked my council colleagues to support the resolution and offering a moment of silence for those that were involved in the D-Day invasions.

554
00:40:36,607 --> 00:40:37,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

00:41:09,903 --> 00:41:10,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Morell?

570
00:41:11,244 --> 00:41:11,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

571
00:41:11,924 --> 00:41:12,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli?

572
00:41:13,265 --> 00:41:13,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

573
00:41:13,886 --> 00:41:14,646
[SPEAKER_08]: President Falco?

574
00:41:15,547 --> 00:41:17,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

575
00:41:17,489 --> 00:41:19,110
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion passes at this point in time.

576
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:22,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd ask everyone to please rise for a brief moment of silence.

577
00:41:29,741 --> 00:41:30,001
Thank you.

578
00:42:02,279 --> 00:42:06,380
[SPEAKER_06]: 20-426 offered by Vice President Caraviello and Councilor Knight.

579
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:14,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council extends its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Brian Rabbitt on his recent passing.

580
00:42:15,203 --> 00:42:16,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Caraviello.

581
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,483
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

582
00:42:19,744 --> 00:42:21,584
[SPEAKER_18]: Another sad passing in our city.

583
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:31,147
[SPEAKER_18]: I knew the Rabbitt family for many, many years, and it was a shame to watch him suffer over the last few years the way he had.

584
00:42:31,993 --> 00:42:38,601
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to offer my condolences to the Roberts family and his children on his passing.

585
00:42:38,702 --> 00:42:40,223
[SPEAKER_18]: I refer you to Councilor NAICC.

586
00:42:48,798 --> 00:42:50,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

587
00:42:51,560 --> 00:43:02,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the great opportunity of meeting Brian Rabbitt back when I was playing Pop Warner for his father, Jack Rabbitt, and his brother, Jimmy, as my coaches on the A squad as a young kid.

588
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:09,335
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also had the pleasure of representing him as his business agent and union rep when I worked for the union.

589
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:11,717
[SPEAKER_02]: And over the years, we've been able to develop a great friendship.

590
00:43:12,237 --> 00:43:17,121
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's very important, Mr. President, that we point out, any time

591
00:43:18,045 --> 00:43:21,407
[SPEAKER_02]: that you turn on the water in your house, you should thank Brian Rabbit.

592
00:43:21,447 --> 00:43:22,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Think of Brian Rabbit.

593
00:43:22,968 --> 00:43:30,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time that you run the dishwasher, every time that you take a shower, every time that you get a drink of water, you should think of Brian Rabbit.

594
00:43:31,014 --> 00:43:37,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time you see a fire department, attach a hose to that fire hydrant outside your house, you should thank Brian Rabbit.

595
00:43:37,558 --> 00:43:44,744
[SPEAKER_02]: because he spent the better part of the last three decades, Mr. President, in the trenches doing the dirty work, the stuff that people don't get credit for.

596
00:43:45,445 --> 00:43:51,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian was one hell of a worker, probably the hottest working man in show business when it came to DPW staff.

597
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:56,995
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't never a time that I saw him that he wasn't either going to or coming from work.

598
00:43:57,455 --> 00:44:03,422
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy was constantly working, constantly covered in mud and dust and dirt from being in those trenches.

599
00:44:03,662 --> 00:44:05,744
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's going to be sadly missed, Mr. President.

600
00:44:05,804 --> 00:44:09,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only was he a good friend, but he was a great asset and a great public servant.

601
00:44:09,848 --> 00:44:11,770
[SPEAKER_02]: And I offer my condolences to the family.

602
00:44:12,851 --> 00:44:15,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

603
00:44:16,355 --> 00:44:16,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

604
00:44:17,853 --> 00:44:18,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

605
00:44:18,874 --> 00:44:20,955
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank my colleagues for putting this on.

606
00:44:21,715 --> 00:44:24,476
[SPEAKER_05]: What Councilor Knight just mentioned about Brian sums it up.

607
00:44:25,477 --> 00:44:27,138
[SPEAKER_05]: He kept our infrastructure going.

608
00:44:28,018 --> 00:44:37,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about it, a system that's 150 years old with pipes that are actually made out of wood, some of our old water pipes, Mr. President.

609
00:44:38,763 --> 00:44:43,946
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a man that kept the infrastructure going, never questioned his job.

610
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,187
[SPEAKER_05]: When there was a leak at two in the morning, three in the

611
00:44:48,404 --> 00:44:52,665
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd see Brian Rabbit's head hanging out of the hole in the middle of the street, Mr. President.

612
00:44:53,025 --> 00:44:55,366
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the type of dedication he had.

613
00:44:56,266 --> 00:45:09,090
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, Mr. President, you had someone that fought an illness, a devastating illness, for many years and never said, woe is me, always had a smile, a good word to say, and he will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

614
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:11,551
[SPEAKER_05]: I thank my colleagues for putting this on.

615
00:45:12,031 --> 00:45:13,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

616
00:45:14,352 --> 00:45:15,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

617
00:45:18,717 --> 00:45:19,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

618
00:45:20,098 --> 00:45:22,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, just to follow up.

619
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:31,002
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that my fellow Councilors talked about, uh, Mr. Rabbit and glowing terms, but again, I, I'd have to share those same sentiments.

620
00:45:31,202 --> 00:45:45,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, he was someone who kept the city going and people want to know if everything's so difficult and numbers are so, so limited employment here, DPW, how do they make it work?

621
00:45:45,985 --> 00:45:48,346
[SPEAKER_07]: people like Mr. Rabbit is the reason why it works.

622
00:45:48,366 --> 00:45:54,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Councilor Knight and Councilor Marks said, he's the guy in the hole.

623
00:45:56,448 --> 00:46:02,070
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's the one that's always coming out dirty, making sure that everything works properly.

624
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:07,892
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw him a few months back here right on Butler Street and he was, you know,

625
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:14,193
[SPEAKER_07]: digging right in there and going to work and making sure my neighbors had their water, just had a newborn.

626
00:46:14,253 --> 00:46:19,514
[SPEAKER_07]: And he worked diligently to make sure that everybody was happy.

627
00:46:19,594 --> 00:46:21,715
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a sad day.

628
00:46:21,815 --> 00:46:28,976
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a sad day because, you know, I remember going to his time and the amount of people that were there and the impact he made on people.

629
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,557
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know, Mayor,

630
00:46:33,308 --> 00:46:42,532
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe Mayor Burke named the date after him in his honor, so he deserves everything he gets.

631
00:46:42,572 --> 00:46:53,857
[SPEAKER_07]: He fought the battle hard, and his family should be proud in that he taught them how to live with dignity in this very difficult time.

632
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:57,299
[SPEAKER_07]: So God bless him and wish his family luck.

633
00:46:57,319 --> 00:46:58,019
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

634
00:46:58,619 --> 00:46:59,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

635
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:05,643
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I may, I had only met Brian a few times, and he's a very nice guy.

636
00:47:06,904 --> 00:47:14,268
[SPEAKER_06]: But the things that I always heard about him was how he was so dedicated to what he did, his work, and to our community for so many years.

637
00:47:14,948 --> 00:47:17,650
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was just an all-around great guy.

638
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:25,855
[SPEAKER_06]: So our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and his friends, and we thank him for his many years of service to our community.

639
00:47:28,548 --> 00:47:32,030
[SPEAKER_06]: who was someone who had a hand up, he thought that wanted to speak, maybe, maybe not.

640
00:47:34,532 --> 00:47:40,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, on the motion of, let's see, Councilor, Vice President Caraviello and Councilor Knight.

641
00:47:40,696 --> 00:47:45,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, if we could dedicate this meeting in the memory of Brian Rabbit.

642
00:47:46,821 --> 00:47:47,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

643
00:47:47,621 --> 00:47:48,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

644
00:47:48,642 --> 00:47:49,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

645
00:47:49,903 --> 00:47:55,647
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of, let's see, Vice President Caraviello and Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks.

646
00:47:57,013 --> 00:48:00,656
[SPEAKER_06]: and also that we dedicate this meeting in Brian Rappaport's honor.

647
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:02,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk, please call the roll.

648
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:04,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Bears?

649
00:48:05,381 --> 00:48:05,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

650
00:48:06,642 --> 00:48:07,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Caraviello?

651
00:48:07,823 --> 00:48:08,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

652
00:48:08,864 --> 00:48:09,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight?

653
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:12,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

654
00:48:12,948 --> 00:48:13,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Marks?

655
00:48:13,909 --> 00:48:14,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

656
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:15,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Morell?

657
00:48:16,051 --> 00:48:16,291
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

658
00:48:17,392 --> 00:48:18,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli?

659
00:48:18,693 --> 00:48:18,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

660
00:48:19,414 --> 00:48:20,055
[SPEAKER_08]: President Falco?

661
00:48:21,016 --> 00:48:22,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

662
00:48:22,937 --> 00:48:24,298
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion passes at this point.

663
00:48:24,378 --> 00:48:27,119
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna ask everyone to please rise for a brief moment of silence.

664
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:48,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

665
00:48:57,152 --> 00:49:18,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, 20-428 offered by Councilor Knight, be it so resolved that the City Clerk issue a report to the Council providing a list of all Board and Commission appointments under the purview of the Council, including, but not limited to, name of the Council appointee, date of appointment, length of term, and expiration date of current Council appointees in these positions.

666
00:49:19,266 --> 00:49:19,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

667
00:49:25,343 --> 00:49:27,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

668
00:49:28,043 --> 00:49:30,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this resolution is rather self-explanatory.

669
00:49:31,644 --> 00:49:53,488
[SPEAKER_02]: What it is is a request for the city clerk to just chronicle who it is that's been appointed to city council appointments, when they were appointed, what their expiration date is, and whether or not we need to move forward with renewals or an open application process to solicit new applicants, or maybe offer some opportunity to create some new voices in the community.

670
00:49:54,048 --> 00:50:00,589
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I thank you for entertaining this resolution.

671
00:50:01,389 --> 00:50:03,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I do apologize for the technical difficulties.

672
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:08,591
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, I'd ask for a council colleague to second the motion.

673
00:50:08,611 --> 00:50:09,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I second the motion.

674
00:50:09,951 --> 00:50:13,032
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

675
00:50:13,072 --> 00:50:14,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk Bernabeu, please call the roll.

676
00:50:14,772 --> 00:50:19,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, if I may, before you call the roll, are there any questions from the council or the public on this motion?

677
00:50:21,998 --> 00:50:23,819
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no emails on this topic, Mr. President.

678
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:24,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

679
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:26,940
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a hand up here.

680
00:50:28,501 --> 00:50:28,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

681
00:50:35,863 --> 00:50:37,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Bruce Dickinson, did you want to comment on this?

682
00:50:37,944 --> 00:50:44,707
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes necessary for one people.

683
00:50:46,309 --> 00:51:05,957
[SPEAKER_00]: to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and... Are we still having technical difficulties or not, Mr. President?

684
00:51:07,258 --> 00:51:09,059
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounded like the Declaration of Independence to me.

685
00:51:09,079 --> 00:51:10,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Kerenbese, please call the roll.

686
00:51:10,499 --> 00:51:11,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Beres.

687
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:15,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

688
00:51:16,015 --> 00:51:17,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Caraviello.

689
00:51:17,076 --> 00:51:17,376
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

690
00:51:17,936 --> 00:51:18,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

691
00:51:19,357 --> 00:51:19,677
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

692
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:20,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Marks.

693
00:51:21,197 --> 00:51:21,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

694
00:51:21,898 --> 00:51:22,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Morell.

695
00:51:23,158 --> 00:51:23,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

696
00:51:23,818 --> 00:51:24,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

697
00:51:25,699 --> 00:51:28,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, the airplanes are so low, but yes, yes.

698
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:29,321
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't hear.

699
00:51:29,841 --> 00:51:30,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

700
00:51:30,601 --> 00:51:31,581
[SPEAKER_07]: President Falco.

701
00:51:32,362 --> 00:51:32,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

702
00:51:32,662 --> 00:51:34,783
[SPEAKER_06]: 70 affirmative, zero negative.

703
00:51:34,983 --> 00:51:35,923
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion passes.

704
00:51:36,203 --> 00:51:37,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Michael, you'll be hearing that in a minute.

705
00:51:41,925 --> 00:51:46,528
[SPEAKER_15]: Move down the bottom of the hill and the highway drowns it out, let me tell you.

706
00:51:46,548 --> 00:51:51,932
[SPEAKER_06]: 20-429 offered by Vice President Caraviello.

707
00:51:52,592 --> 00:52:05,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council receive an answer from the Historical Commission on the status of 421 High Street, 421 High Street, regarding a Cincinnati funeral home as the property has fallen into disrepair.

708
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Caraviello.

709
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:08,193
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

710
00:52:08,233 --> 00:52:18,562
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, this is, I think, a property that's come before the Historical Commission for demolition, and I don't know where it was gone after that.

711
00:52:18,622 --> 00:52:27,090
[SPEAKER_18]: I know there was a board placed in front of the property that's since fallen down, and the paper that was on it is gone.

712
00:52:27,763 --> 00:52:35,346
[SPEAKER_18]: And it could be cleaned up and residents of the business community have been asking what the status of that property is.

713
00:52:35,366 --> 00:52:43,609
[SPEAKER_18]: So if we can get an answer from the historical commission on the status of that demolition or non demolition and what's going on there, it'd be appreciated.

714
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:47,831
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

715
00:52:49,292 --> 00:52:49,812
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all night.

716
00:52:53,755 --> 00:52:58,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Mr. President, thank you very much, and I thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up.

717
00:53:00,098 --> 00:53:08,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, we have a demolition delay ordinance that calls for an 18-month period for demolition delay.

718
00:53:09,623 --> 00:53:23,090
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a measure that was put forth with good intentions, but I think this is one of the areas that we need to look at going forward, is the negative impact that an 18-month demolition delay will have.

719
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:37,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if a person buys a property and they have to wait 18 months, uh, to demolish it, then, um, there could be the potential where the circumstances that we're in right now happen where, uh, you know, they let the property fall into disrepair for a period of a year and a half.

720
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:41,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let that demolition delay window pass and then.

721
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,508
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right.

722
00:53:49,528 --> 00:53:50,048
[SPEAKER_09]: We lost you.

723
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:58,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

724
00:53:59,081 --> 00:54:02,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Get deemed as a historically significant building.

725
00:54:02,562 --> 00:54:08,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the only thing historically significant about Pacelli's is the curtains on the third floor apartment.

726
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:12,803
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's really something that we need to look at, Mr. President.

727
00:54:13,163 --> 00:54:16,624
[SPEAKER_02]: As I sit here and speak and look at the screen, everybody is frozen.

728
00:54:16,644 --> 00:54:18,924
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like I'm in a museum, so I'm going to rest my case.

729
00:54:19,284 --> 00:54:20,145
[SPEAKER_02]: But thank you very much.

730
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:22,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

731
00:54:24,098 --> 00:54:25,179
[SPEAKER_18]: Vice President Caraviello.

732
00:54:25,479 --> 00:54:32,522
[SPEAKER_18]: And I say, Mr. President, this isn't a business district and it doesn't bode well for the other businesses that are in that area.

733
00:54:32,542 --> 00:54:36,564
[SPEAKER_18]: So if we can get an answer, that'd be greatly appreciated.

734
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:38,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

735
00:54:38,986 --> 00:54:42,007
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion, actually, are there any questions from the council on this issue?

736
00:54:46,189 --> 00:54:48,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions from the public?

737
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:51,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, seeing and hearing none.

738
00:54:52,573 --> 00:54:53,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk Hurtubise.

739
00:54:54,723 --> 00:54:55,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Please call the roll.

740
00:54:55,604 --> 00:54:56,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a second?

741
00:54:56,224 --> 00:54:57,565
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, I missed the second.

742
00:54:57,705 --> 00:55:00,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a second on the Vice President Caraviello's resolution?

743
00:55:00,207 --> 00:55:00,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, second.

744
00:55:01,348 --> 00:55:01,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

745
00:55:01,848 --> 00:55:02,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

746
00:55:03,269 --> 00:55:03,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

747
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:05,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Here comes the roll call.

748
00:55:05,871 --> 00:55:06,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Bears.

749
00:55:07,412 --> 00:55:07,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

750
00:55:08,153 --> 00:55:09,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Caraviello.

751
00:55:09,434 --> 00:55:09,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

752
00:55:10,195 --> 00:55:11,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

753
00:55:11,075 --> 00:55:18,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight, are you there?

754
00:55:21,563 --> 00:55:23,164
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gonna skip him, go to Councilor Marks.

755
00:55:23,604 --> 00:55:23,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

756
00:55:24,878 --> 00:55:25,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Morell?

757
00:55:26,158 --> 00:55:26,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

758
00:55:26,879 --> 00:55:27,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli?

759
00:55:28,379 --> 00:55:28,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

760
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:29,999
[SPEAKER_08]: President Falco?

761
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:31,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

762
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,740
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, I've got Councilor Knight.

763
00:55:34,821 --> 00:55:36,221
[SPEAKER_08]: We're still waiting on a vote from Councilor Knight.

764
00:55:37,161 --> 00:55:38,482
[SPEAKER_17]: He sent a message in the chat.

765
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:40,242
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, let's see.

766
00:55:40,262 --> 00:55:41,863
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me look at the chat here.

767
00:55:44,523 --> 00:55:45,564
[SPEAKER_08]: He says he has no audio.

768
00:55:45,824 --> 00:55:46,644
[SPEAKER_06]: He has no audio.

769
00:55:46,984 --> 00:55:47,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

770
00:55:48,584 --> 00:55:51,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want me to try and get his vote out of the chat?

771
00:55:52,605 --> 00:55:53,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see if we can get it from there.

772
00:56:08,888 --> 00:56:09,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Hang on.

773
00:56:11,689 --> 00:56:12,590
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't get him in the chat.

774
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:13,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Hang on a second.

775
00:56:34,179 --> 00:56:35,179
[SPEAKER_05]: He's gone from the chat, hang on.

776
00:56:35,499 --> 00:56:37,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we table it until he comes back, Mr. President?

777
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:38,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean- He's in the waiting room.

778
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Hang on, I'm letting him back in.

779
00:56:42,562 --> 00:56:42,902
[SPEAKER_08]: He's in.

780
00:56:44,923 --> 00:56:45,283
[SPEAKER_08]: He's in.

781
00:56:46,683 --> 00:56:51,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody, all the Councilors are co-hosts, so if you see him, if you actually see him come into the room, just unmute him, please.

782
00:56:52,005 --> 00:56:54,486
[SPEAKER_09]: There you are.

783
00:57:02,503 --> 00:57:06,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Council, if you can hear us we're still waiting on your vote on this on this one.

784
00:57:06,724 --> 00:57:07,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

785
00:57:07,664 --> 00:57:08,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

786
00:57:08,144 --> 00:57:12,185
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the consulate consulate copy all those paper.

787
00:57:12,745 --> 00:57:13,205
[SPEAKER_02]: That's correct.

788
00:57:13,245 --> 00:57:15,045
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't gotten any other any other papers yet.

789
00:57:15,905 --> 00:57:16,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

790
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:20,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Zero the negative the motion passes.

791
00:57:24,867 --> 00:57:29,508
[SPEAKER_06]: President copy all what can you please take the chair for the next several resolutions.

792
00:57:29,948 --> 00:57:30,708
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

793
00:57:32,653 --> 00:57:41,744
[SPEAKER_18]: 20430 offered by President Falco, be it resolved that the street sign at the intersection of Spring Street Extension and Lambert Street be replaced.

794
00:57:42,165 --> 00:57:42,946
[SPEAKER_18]: President Falco.

795
00:57:45,237 --> 00:57:46,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

796
00:57:47,138 --> 00:57:49,060
[SPEAKER_06]: I bring this forward tonight.

797
00:57:49,340 --> 00:58:03,010
[SPEAKER_06]: I've spent a lot of time in the Salem Street Business District over the past few months during the COVID-19 outbreak, giving out meals to part of the grab-and-go program, giving out meals, lunches on a daily basis.

798
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:06,652
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you sit around, of course, you see different things in the neighborhood.

799
00:58:06,772 --> 00:58:13,957
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's one of those, you know, Salem Street and that Salem Street business area is really a gateway to our community.

800
00:58:13,977 --> 00:58:14,678
[SPEAKER_06]: And we really need to

801
00:58:15,138 --> 00:58:17,122
[SPEAKER_06]: take a look at that and hopefully, you know.

802
00:58:18,897 --> 00:58:20,538
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, beautify it in some way.

803
00:58:20,578 --> 00:58:22,800
[SPEAKER_06]: And I noticed they've done some flowers, which is nice.

804
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:26,483
[SPEAKER_06]: The MBTA finally cut the lawn last week, which is nice as well.

805
00:58:26,543 --> 00:58:28,504
[SPEAKER_06]: It was probably about two and a half feet tall.

806
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:36,470
[SPEAKER_06]: But the street sign at the intersection of Spring Street Extension and Lambert Street, I'm asking that to be replaced.

807
00:58:37,191 --> 00:58:41,294
[SPEAKER_06]: The pole is practically bent in half and you can barely read the sign.

808
00:58:41,314 --> 00:58:45,177
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we could just have those street signs replaced, I'd greatly appreciate it.

809
00:58:46,487 --> 00:58:47,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions from the council?

810
00:58:47,988 --> 00:58:53,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, just to follow up, I want to thank President Falco for putting this on.

811
00:58:54,771 --> 00:59:02,534
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to reiterate, Mr. President, there is $50,000 currently available in a city account.

812
00:59:03,834 --> 00:59:05,335
[SPEAKER_05]: for each business district.

813
00:59:06,136 --> 00:59:18,002
[SPEAKER_05]: The only business district that has gotten together and put together a full plan and is now realizing some of the benefits to the 50,000 is the West Medford Business Association.

814
00:59:18,463 --> 00:59:28,188
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would ask Mr. President that all the other business associations get together, put together a plan, and Mayor Lungo-Koehn wants to make sure that this

815
00:59:28,628 --> 00:59:37,238
[SPEAKER_05]: money that's been available for, I think, close to four years now, gets dispersed so we can do some of the improvements that President Falco just spoke about.

816
00:59:38,479 --> 00:59:47,789
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Marksley, from what I'm told, the West Medford improvements were donated from the generosity of the East Cambridge Savings Bank.

817
00:59:50,269 --> 00:59:51,369
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been told otherwise.

818
00:59:52,370 --> 01:00:01,371
[SPEAKER_05]: That may have been part of it, but I've been told that they used their portion of their money from the parking program.

819
01:00:01,451 --> 01:00:05,692
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, on the motion of President Falco, seconded by?

820
01:00:07,093 --> 01:00:07,433
[SPEAKER_18]: Second.

821
01:00:08,033 --> 01:00:09,013
[SPEAKER_18]: Seconded by Councilor Bears.

822
01:00:09,853 --> 01:00:10,893
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

823
01:00:14,234 --> 01:00:14,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears.

824
01:00:15,694 --> 01:00:15,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

825
01:00:16,434 --> 01:00:17,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Caraviello.

826
01:00:17,795 --> 01:00:17,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

827
01:00:18,515 --> 01:00:18,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

828
01:00:23,066 --> 01:00:23,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight?

829
01:00:30,272 --> 01:00:31,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight has no audio again.

830
01:00:31,513 --> 01:00:32,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Hang on just a second.

831
01:00:32,554 --> 01:00:33,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Marks?

832
01:00:33,735 --> 01:00:34,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

833
01:00:35,016 --> 01:00:35,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Morell?

834
01:00:36,577 --> 01:00:36,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

835
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:38,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli?

836
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:40,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

837
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:41,481
[SPEAKER_08]: President Falco?

838
01:00:42,482 --> 01:00:42,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

839
01:00:43,202 --> 01:00:45,104
[SPEAKER_08]: I was supposed to call Vice President Caraviello at the end.

840
01:00:45,144 --> 01:00:45,884
[SPEAKER_08]: I called him second.

841
01:00:45,904 --> 01:00:46,825
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize for that.

842
01:00:47,165 --> 01:00:48,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see if I can reach Councilor Knight for his vote.

843
01:00:51,952 --> 01:00:56,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, that would be a yes, and I sent you a text message as well.

844
01:00:56,614 --> 01:00:57,054
[SPEAKER_08]: I got it.

845
01:00:57,074 --> 01:00:57,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

846
01:00:57,754 --> 01:00:58,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Just got the text.

847
01:00:58,494 --> 01:00:58,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

848
01:00:58,934 --> 01:01:01,995
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a yes.

849
01:01:02,015 --> 01:01:02,055
[SPEAKER_18]: 7-0.

850
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:02,776
[SPEAKER_18]: 7 in the affirmative.

851
01:01:03,416 --> 01:01:04,216
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes.

852
01:01:04,236 --> 01:01:07,257
[SPEAKER_18]: 2-0-4-3-1, offered by President Falco.

853
01:01:07,837 --> 01:01:15,160
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it resolved that the tree stump in front of the MBTA building on Salem Street be removed in the interest of public safety.

854
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:15,960
[SPEAKER_18]: President Falco.

855
01:01:16,843 --> 01:01:18,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

856
01:01:18,964 --> 01:01:21,965
[SPEAKER_06]: This is similar to the last one, last resolution.

857
01:01:23,125 --> 01:01:26,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Just that there's this tree stump that looks like it's been there forever.

858
01:01:27,227 --> 01:01:28,307
[SPEAKER_06]: It needs to be removed.

859
01:01:28,567 --> 01:01:30,448
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a sidewalk that is heavily traversed.

860
01:01:31,008 --> 01:01:34,429
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people going in between Salem Street and the shopping plaza there.

861
01:01:34,869 --> 01:01:38,651
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we could just have that removed in the interest of public safety, we'd greatly appreciate that.

862
01:01:39,031 --> 01:01:39,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

873
01:02:01,243 --> 01:02:01,523

[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

876
01:02:04,904 --> 01:02:05,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

877
01:02:06,224 --> 01:02:06,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

878
01:02:06,484 --> 01:02:07,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Falco.

879
01:02:08,204 --> 01:02:08,444
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

880
01:02:10,085 --> 01:02:11,645
[SPEAKER_18]: The affirmative motion passes.

881
01:02:13,752 --> 01:02:18,194
[SPEAKER_18]: 2-0-4-3-2, offered by President Falco, be it resolved that the crosswalks in Haines Square be repainted.

882
01:02:18,214 --> 01:02:18,674
[SPEAKER_06]: President Caraviello.

883
01:02:19,074 --> 01:02:19,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

884
01:02:19,775 --> 01:02:24,937
[SPEAKER_06]: If I wouldn't mind, I'm not sure if Councilor Marks is agreeable, but would you like to join these last two resolutions?

885
01:02:25,537 --> 01:02:27,518
[SPEAKER_06]: We're doing the crosswalk first.

886
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:28,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

887
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:29,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.

888
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:30,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm ahead of myself.

889
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:31,500
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.

890
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:36,543
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it resolved that the crosswalks in Haines Square be repainted in the interest of public safety.

891
01:02:36,603 --> 01:02:37,283
[SPEAKER_18]: President Falco.

892
01:02:38,637 --> 01:02:40,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

893
01:02:40,998 --> 01:02:46,341
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to see if we could get the crosswalks in Haines Square repainted in the interest of public safety.

894
01:02:46,821 --> 01:02:49,442
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the crosswalks in that area have faded.

895
01:02:49,882 --> 01:02:59,226
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a high-traffic area, and a lot of people that cross from Spring over to Modern Highway are in that area there.

896
01:02:59,286 --> 01:03:05,109
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we could just have all those crosswalks just repainted in the interest of public safety, I'd greatly appreciate it.

897
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:06,970
[SPEAKER_18]: Any other questions?

898
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:11,031
[SPEAKER_18]: The motion by President Falco, seconded by?

899
01:03:12,111 --> 01:03:12,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

01:03:12,451 --> 01:03:14,371
[SPEAKER_18]: Seconded by Councilor Marks.

901
01:03:14,872 --> 01:03:16,092
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

01:03:17,992 --> 01:03:18,632

903
01:03:19,473 --> 01:03:19,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

904
01:03:20,853 --> 01:03:21,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight?

905
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:28,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight has texted me a yes vote and he's nodding his head yes on the screen.

906
01:03:31,438 --> 01:03:32,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Marks?

907
01:03:32,479 --> 01:03:32,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

908
01:03:33,319 --> 01:03:34,020

[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

912
01:03:37,362 --> 01:03:38,183
[SPEAKER_08]: President Falco?

913
01:03:38,923 --> 01:03:39,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

914
01:03:39,684 --> 01:03:40,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Caraviello?

915
01:03:41,045 --> 01:03:41,265
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

916
01:03:41,545 --> 01:03:45,268
[SPEAKER_18]: Seven in the affirmative, motion passes.

917
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:48,710
[SPEAKER_18]: 20433 and 20434 by Councilor Marks.

918
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:50,832
[SPEAKER_18]: The same, if we could do them together.

919
01:03:51,112 --> 01:03:52,053
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilors, is that okay?

920
01:03:52,853 --> 01:03:53,193
[SPEAKER_18]: I would make.

921
01:03:53,694 --> 01:03:54,034
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

922
01:03:54,474 --> 01:03:56,496
[SPEAKER_18]: Offered by President Falco and Councilor Marks.

923
01:03:56,596 --> 01:03:59,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Technically you need to vote to join that.

924
01:04:00,383 --> 01:04:02,544
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, do we have a motion to join 2-0-4-3-3?

925
01:04:02,864 --> 01:04:04,986
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion to join.

926
01:04:05,786 --> 01:04:06,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

927
01:04:06,786 --> 01:04:10,588
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion by Council President Falco, seconded by Councilor Bears.

928
01:04:10,628 --> 01:04:11,809
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

929
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:15,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Bears?

930
01:04:15,991 --> 01:04:16,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

931
01:04:18,832 --> 01:04:19,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight?

932
01:04:25,276 --> 01:04:26,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight is nodding his head yes.

933
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:27,857
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm taking that as a yes.

934
01:04:30,059 --> 01:04:30,859
[SPEAKER_08]: He has no audio.

935
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:31,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Marks?

936
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:32,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

937
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:33,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Morell?

938
01:04:35,101 --> 01:04:35,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

939
01:04:35,921 --> 01:04:36,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli?

940
01:04:37,122 --> 01:04:37,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

941
01:04:38,502 --> 01:04:39,302
[SPEAKER_08]: President Falco?

942
01:04:39,843 --> 01:04:40,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

943
01:04:42,584 --> 01:04:43,764
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Vice President Caraviello?

944
01:04:44,364 --> 01:04:45,765
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

945
01:04:45,805 --> 01:04:51,847
[SPEAKER_08]: And just for the record, I also received a text from Councilor Knight with a yes vote to join these motions.

946
01:04:52,267 --> 01:04:55,849
[SPEAKER_08]: So he has indicated a yes by text and by nodding his head.

947
01:04:59,390 --> 01:04:59,650
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

948
01:05:01,572 --> 01:05:04,753
[SPEAKER_18]: 20433 and 20434 offered by President Falco and Councilor Marks.

949
01:05:05,314 --> 01:05:13,178
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it resolved that the MBTA representative be asked to appear before the Method City Council to explain why the 325, 326 bus routes are being eliminated.

950
01:05:13,198 --> 01:05:13,919
[SPEAKER_18]: President Falco.

951
01:05:13,939 --> 01:05:14,339
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

952
01:05:21,511 --> 01:05:22,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

953
01:05:23,172 --> 01:05:30,496
[SPEAKER_06]: I bring this resolution tonight because I have received numerous emails regarding the 325 and 326 bus routes.

954
01:05:31,837 --> 01:05:36,940
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a, it's actually also a bus route that I take on a daily basis when I'm working.

955
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:48,727
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know Councilor Mark says too, we're longtime riders and there are many, many people that depend on these bus routes on a daily basis to get to and from

956
01:05:49,635 --> 01:05:53,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Boston, and they're very convenient to the people in our community.

957
01:05:53,817 --> 01:06:00,080
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are many members of our community that depend on these bus routes on a daily basis.

958
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:03,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I've received messages that they're being eliminated.

959
01:06:04,141 --> 01:06:10,624
[SPEAKER_06]: I also received a phone call today from Representative Donato, who told me they were being temporarily taken out of service.

960
01:06:11,665 --> 01:06:14,666
[SPEAKER_06]: He did tell me, actually he assured me that

961
01:06:15,467 --> 01:06:22,995
[SPEAKER_06]: that they would be reinstated in mid-July, which to me, it felt better about it.

962
01:06:23,496 --> 01:06:32,165
[SPEAKER_06]: But still with that being said, I know the MBTA has been trying to eliminate these bus routes for a number of years.

963
01:06:32,606 --> 01:06:36,210
[SPEAKER_06]: I know they tried to eliminate them twice before.

964
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:40,232
[SPEAKER_06]: And we fought back actually at one point with the help of the clerk.

965
01:06:40,992 --> 01:06:50,998
[SPEAKER_06]: He helped us out with it and we were able to maintain those bus routes and keep them servicing West Medford and North Medford.

966
01:06:52,478 --> 01:06:54,219
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I said, these are important bus routes.

967
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:58,822
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to make sure that they're not eliminated completely.

968
01:06:59,274 --> 01:07:01,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the MBTA has been trying to eliminate them.

969
01:07:02,175 --> 01:07:04,556
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Representative Donato says it's temporary.

970
01:07:04,997 --> 01:07:07,018
[SPEAKER_06]: But to me, I still have concerns.

971
01:07:07,098 --> 01:07:07,958
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the MBTA.

972
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:09,519
[SPEAKER_06]: I know they're trying to save money.

973
01:07:09,539 --> 01:07:11,160
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to make sure they're here for us.

974
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:18,483
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why I wanted to hear from a representative from the MBTA that could explain further.

975
01:07:18,883 --> 01:07:22,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that ridership has been down during COVID-19.

976
01:07:22,765 --> 01:07:26,707
[SPEAKER_06]: But I still have concerns that they're going to be eliminated.

977
01:07:27,608 --> 01:07:30,576
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why I bring this forward tonight.

978
01:07:31,979 --> 01:07:32,280
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

979
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:32,841
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Marks.

980
01:07:33,921 --> 01:07:35,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

981
01:07:35,462 --> 01:07:37,183
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank President Falco.

982
01:07:37,203 --> 01:07:39,024
[SPEAKER_05]: He did an excellent job explaining that.

983
01:07:39,824 --> 01:07:57,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I, too, want to thank Representative Donato, who immediately got on the phone and talked to representatives of the MBTA, who did assure him, I was told, within the next two or three weeks that it would be fully reinstalled, the bus routes.

984
01:07:58,753 --> 01:08:02,935
[SPEAKER_05]: As President Falco mentioned, that has been a bone of contention with

985
01:08:03,615 --> 01:08:07,717
[SPEAKER_05]: area residents that take the express bus, Mr. President, into town.

986
01:08:08,337 --> 01:08:19,741
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we all can remember when they try to cut back a few of the routes and the bus was filled to capacity, over which is a requirement

987
01:08:20,101 --> 01:08:35,585
[SPEAKER_05]: that the MBTA has for safety concerns, and they still allowed it to exist until the members of the Medford City Council got involved, Mr. President, and we were able to reinstitute some of the cut routes for the 325 and 326.

988
01:08:36,165 --> 01:08:44,087
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm hoping within the next two or three weeks, according to Rep Donato, this will be reinstituted.

989
01:08:44,527 --> 01:08:46,329
[SPEAKER_05]: because there's a need, Mr. President.

990
01:08:47,009 --> 01:08:55,616
[SPEAKER_05]: And it clearly shows that there is a need in this community to use both the 325 and the 326.

991
01:08:57,077 --> 01:09:00,359
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to thank President Falco for offering this as well.

992
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:01,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

993
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:01,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Bax.

994
01:09:02,481 --> 01:09:05,083
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Bears, did you have your hand up?

995
01:09:05,803 --> 01:09:06,084
[SPEAKER_15]: I did.

996
01:09:06,144 --> 01:09:07,725
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

997
01:09:08,926 --> 01:09:11,528
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to add that, you know,

998
01:09:12,718 --> 01:09:14,339
[SPEAKER_15]: President Falco takes the bus every day.

999
01:09:14,379 --> 01:09:21,121
[SPEAKER_15]: I couldn't say it better than him, but you know, this is a time when we need more bus service, when we want to have fewer people packed into buses and trains.

1000
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:26,183
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, the, the, the emails I got were, you know, obviously inconvenience.

1001
01:09:26,223 --> 01:09:34,186
[SPEAKER_15]: I need to get to work, but it was, you know, now I'm going to have to put myself in more danger transfer between multiple trains just to get to the same location that I would buy the bus.

1002
01:09:34,246 --> 01:09:39,567
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, it's an important transit issue and we need more bus service, but it's a health issue for people during this pandemic.

1003
01:09:40,528 --> 01:09:40,868
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1004
01:09:42,683 --> 01:09:43,904
[SPEAKER_18]: Any other questions by the council?

1005
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:52,326
[SPEAKER_18]: The motion by President Falco and Councilor Mark, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1006
01:09:52,366 --> 01:09:53,486
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1007
01:09:57,107 --> 01:09:57,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears.

1008
01:09:58,948 --> 01:09:59,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1009
01:10:00,428 --> 01:10:01,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Caraviello.

1010
01:10:01,648 --> 01:10:01,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1011
01:10:04,489 --> 01:10:06,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I was supposed to call you last, I apologize.

1012
01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:07,550
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all right.

1013
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:11,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight texted me that he's a yes on this.

[SPEAKER_06]: The report is approved.

[SPEAKER_06]: Next item is public participation.

1099
01:14:11,482 --> 01:14:14,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, 20-437, and I apologize if I get this wrong.

1100
01:14:14,125 --> 01:14:19,351
[SPEAKER_06]: 374 Winthrop Street, Metro Massachusetts, 02155, to discuss police training and reform.

1101
01:14:30,539 --> 01:14:31,619
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Falco.

1102
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,941
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate you giving me the chance to speak and address all of you.

1103
01:14:37,582 --> 01:14:47,347
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd like to take a second to talk to everyone about the need for police reform in the context of what we're seeing nationwide and locally here in the greater Boston area with protests.

1104
01:14:49,047 --> 01:14:51,969
[SPEAKER_14]: I think everyone would agree that police are very important.

1105
01:14:52,329 --> 01:14:58,632
[SPEAKER_14]: They have a dangerous job, and they have to go out and deal with many of kind of the worst

1106
01:14:59,624 --> 01:15:00,345
[SPEAKER_14]: of our community.

1107
01:15:00,385 --> 01:15:03,367
[SPEAKER_14]: When there's a problem, when there's a crime, they're the ones that get sent in.

1108
01:15:03,407 --> 01:15:05,349
[SPEAKER_14]: They're the ones that have to go and deal with that.

1109
01:15:05,889 --> 01:15:12,855
[SPEAKER_14]: And as a result, we give them a lot of leeway, and we cut them a lot of slack when it comes to how they interact with people.

1110
01:15:13,115 --> 01:15:16,638
[SPEAKER_14]: They get licensed to use force that other people wouldn't be able to use.

1111
01:15:17,538 --> 01:15:22,682
[SPEAKER_14]: And we give them the benefit of the doubt, so when something goes wrong, we tend to believe them.

1112
01:15:23,323 --> 01:15:28,167
[SPEAKER_14]: But then things sometimes do go wrong, and sometimes they go wrong horribly, as we've seen multiple times

1113
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:30,661
[SPEAKER_14]: the nation with people getting killed.

1114
01:15:30,681 --> 01:15:38,167
[SPEAKER_14]: We've seen George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, more recently, um, um, Brooks, I'm going to get his last, his first name wrong.

1115
01:15:38,588 --> 01:15:44,092
[SPEAKER_14]: They were, they were killed at the hands of police and they, you know, these deaths didn't need to happen.

1116
01:15:44,973 --> 01:15:55,621
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and so there are protests that are happening nationwide that are protesting, not just these deaths, but kind of this system of violence and racism that seems to be targeting minorities in our community.

1117
01:15:56,404 --> 01:16:04,649
[SPEAKER_14]: And so when we see these things, it's really easy to kind of look at that and think, well, those are other police forces.

1118
01:16:04,689 --> 01:16:05,990
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are other parts of America.

1119
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:08,731
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not here in our community that we face these problems.

1120
01:16:09,312 --> 01:16:12,814
[SPEAKER_14]: And I believe that these problems do exist in our community as well.

1121
01:16:13,314 --> 01:16:20,538
[SPEAKER_14]: And the easiest evidence of this that we can see is the overtime scandal that happened recently that I'm sure everyone here is familiar with.

1122
01:16:20,989 --> 01:16:27,054
[SPEAKER_14]: where multiple police officers were going and they were effectively stealing taxpayer money.

1123
01:16:27,735 --> 01:16:33,079
[SPEAKER_14]: And the resolution of that was that none of these police officers were held accountable.

1124
01:16:33,119 --> 01:16:34,040
[SPEAKER_14]: None of them were fired.

1125
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:35,481
[SPEAKER_14]: So they're all still on the force.

1126
01:16:35,521 --> 01:16:40,185
[SPEAKER_14]: And in fact, I believe roughly a quarter of the police force now is on the Brady list.

1127
01:16:40,722 --> 01:16:51,509
[SPEAKER_14]: which is a list of untrustworthy police officers that are not allowed to testify in a court of law because they're seen as untrustworthy actors.

1128
01:16:51,889 --> 01:16:53,911
[SPEAKER_14]: And so their testimony isn't useful.

1129
01:16:53,991 --> 01:16:59,694
[SPEAKER_14]: So a quarter of the police department can't even go to court to testify in the cases that they might be involved in.

1130
01:17:00,955 --> 01:17:08,760
[SPEAKER_14]: And so in that context, I think it's important to think about what we're doing to reform police and maybe move things within Medford and within our own community.

1131
01:17:09,994 --> 01:17:15,998
[SPEAKER_14]: The mayor recently sent out an open letter with Chief Buckley about how they're going to be doing more police training.

1132
01:17:16,359 --> 01:17:17,379
[SPEAKER_14]: And I welcome that.

1133
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:18,140
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a good start.

1134
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:18,980
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not sufficient.

1135
01:17:19,581 --> 01:17:23,604
[SPEAKER_14]: I've actually communicated with the mayor a bit more, and I believe that there are more things happening.

1136
01:17:24,204 --> 01:17:32,350
[SPEAKER_14]: Chief Buckley is going to be going and reviewing policies and posting them publicly on the police website so there's greater transparency, and I greatly applaud that.

1137
01:17:33,010 --> 01:17:39,395
[SPEAKER_14]: And I believe that the mayor is also going to go and declare racism to be a public health emergency.

1138
01:17:39,889 --> 01:17:44,893
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not totally sure what the fallout of that is, but it certainly sounds good.

1139
01:17:45,334 --> 01:17:46,755
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we need to go further, though.

1140
01:17:47,223 --> 01:17:49,985
[SPEAKER_14]: And in particular, there are two things that I'm advocating for.

1141
01:17:50,005 --> 01:17:54,047
[SPEAKER_14]: One is kind of on the prevention side, and one is on the accountability side.

1142
01:17:54,508 --> 01:18:00,792
[SPEAKER_14]: On the prevention side, we should implement the policies that you can see at the aidcantwait.org website.

1143
01:18:01,132 --> 01:18:04,254
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to quickly run through those right now, just so people know what they are.

1144
01:18:04,534 --> 01:18:07,856
[SPEAKER_14]: These were just implemented in Somerville, so they work locally.

1145
01:18:08,076 --> 01:18:09,998
[SPEAKER_14]: And we should be implementing all of them here.

1146
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:14,881
[SPEAKER_14]: And those policies specifically are a ban on chokeholds and strangleholds.

1147
01:18:15,512 --> 01:18:19,176
[SPEAKER_14]: A requirement that police must try to deescalate the situation.

1148
01:18:19,196 --> 01:18:23,021
[SPEAKER_14]: A requirement that the police must warn before firing shots.

1149
01:18:24,483 --> 01:18:28,267
[SPEAKER_14]: A requirement that the police must exhaust all alternatives before shooting.

1150
01:18:28,287 --> 01:18:30,189
[SPEAKER_14]: A duty to intervene.

1151
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:34,755
[SPEAKER_14]: So if a police officer sees another police officer doing something wrong, they have a duty to intervene.

1152
01:18:35,425 --> 01:18:44,413
[SPEAKER_14]: a ban at shooting at moving vehicles, requiring the police to do a use of force continuum, and finally, require comprehensive reporting from the police.

1153
01:18:44,833 --> 01:18:46,855
[SPEAKER_14]: These are all things that should be on the books already.

1154
01:18:47,095 --> 01:18:48,996
[SPEAKER_14]: I honestly don't know how many of them are on the books.

1155
01:18:49,056 --> 01:18:51,458
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe that's why Chief Buckley's looking at that and he's gonna post about it.

1156
01:18:51,859 --> 01:18:53,480
[SPEAKER_14]: We should pass all of these immediately.

1157
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:55,262
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no reason not to do any of them.

1158
01:18:55,302 --> 01:18:57,584
[SPEAKER_14]: They'll make community policing stronger.

1159
01:18:58,224 --> 01:19:03,649
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the other thing that we should be doing is we need to have a system to hold police accountable when something goes wrong.

1160
01:19:04,288 --> 01:19:04,895
[SPEAKER_14]: When you see...

1161
01:19:06,027 --> 01:19:07,828
[SPEAKER_14]: people getting killed by police officers.

1162
01:19:07,968 --> 01:19:20,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Inevitably, it comes up that the police officers that killed the person was a bad apple, that they had a history of past complaints against them, that there were many reports about things they did wrong.

1163
01:19:20,917 --> 01:19:25,160
[SPEAKER_14]: And for one reason or another, the police force was unable to get rid of these actors.

1164
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:27,922
[SPEAKER_14]: And we seem to have the same problem.

1165
01:19:27,962 --> 01:19:31,044
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, none of these officers were held accountable with the overtime scandal.

1166
01:19:31,304 --> 01:19:34,046
[SPEAKER_14]: So we do seem to have a number of bad apples within our own

1167
01:19:34,842 --> 01:19:35,442
[SPEAKER_14]: police force.

1168
01:19:35,842 --> 01:19:43,785
[SPEAKER_14]: And so what we need is an independent civilian oversight of our police department that has the ability to hold people accountable.

1169
01:19:43,825 --> 01:19:45,906
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know that's very difficult with the police union.

1170
01:19:46,326 --> 01:19:57,811
[SPEAKER_14]: I know it may be hard to get rid of people, but we need to think about how we can go about making these changes to kind of make things better because protecting the bad actors with complaints against them, they're protecting the ones that are stealing taxpayer money.

1171
01:19:58,311 --> 01:20:03,393
[SPEAKER_14]: These just make our police force weaker and it makes the good cop's job harder to actually go and help people.

1172
01:20:04,663 --> 01:20:07,165
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to say that the opinions that I'm saying are popular.

1173
01:20:07,205 --> 01:20:08,406
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not just me saying this.

1174
01:20:08,746 --> 01:20:23,737
[SPEAKER_14]: I posted on Nextdoor, and it's not the most scientific of things, but many, many, many people were posting when we spoke about this, and I would say around two-thirds of the population that posted did seem to support police reform.

1175
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:25,518
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is a popular thing that we should be doing.

1176
01:20:26,122 --> 01:20:31,563
[SPEAKER_14]: And finally, I know a lot of the focus right now is on the budget shortfall that we're facing.

1177
01:20:32,363 --> 01:20:37,584
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a good conversation before about how our school system has a huge shortfall and they need more money.

1178
01:20:38,004 --> 01:20:49,726
[SPEAKER_14]: Perhaps it's time to reexamine maybe putting more resources towards our schools and other community services and less towards our police department because we have a budget shortfall and we have to make cuts somewhere.

1179
01:20:50,046 --> 01:20:51,246
[SPEAKER_14]: That's everything I wanted to say.

1180
01:20:51,466 --> 01:20:53,407
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much for taking the time to listen.

1181
01:20:54,807 --> 01:20:55,027
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

1182
01:20:55,663 --> 01:20:58,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, thank you very much for participating today.

1183
01:20:58,966 --> 01:21:00,507
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

1184
01:21:00,547 --> 01:21:03,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, we have Vice President Caraviello.

1185
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:04,951
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1186
01:21:04,971 --> 01:21:13,398
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, does the gentleman have any instances of police brutality or police shootings that he wants to bring to the council's attention?

1187
01:21:14,613 --> 01:21:18,216
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, no, I absolutely don't have any information about that.

1188
01:21:18,536 --> 01:21:21,338
[SPEAKER_14]: What I'm saying is that we need to have some system of accountability.

1189
01:21:21,358 --> 01:21:24,340
[SPEAKER_14]: So that way, if there, I don't think anything like that's happened to be clear.

1190
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:26,761
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm saying that we should have some sort of system in place.

1191
01:21:26,801 --> 01:21:36,288
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we identify bad actors who have multiple complaints against them, who have, you know, use of force problems before that, we have a system to move them out of the police force.

1192
01:21:37,008 --> 01:21:40,931
[SPEAKER_18]: I think, I think chief Buckley is, uh, is got a handle on most of these, uh,

1193
01:21:41,459 --> 01:21:42,540
[SPEAKER_18]: these situations.

1194
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:48,227
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, if you know of any bad actors in our police department, please bring them to our attention.

1195
01:21:48,928 --> 01:21:51,170
[SPEAKER_18]: And so the chief can be aware of this.

1196
01:21:54,374 --> 01:21:55,035
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1197
01:21:55,255 --> 01:21:56,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1198
01:21:57,362 --> 01:22:03,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank the previous speaker for coming and giving his opinion.

1199
01:22:04,684 --> 01:22:18,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I think as I stated, I think it was last week, we have more in common than we do when it comes to what we believe needs to be done in regards to police reform.

1200
01:22:18,808 --> 01:22:24,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had the opportunity over the last two weeks, actually, maybe even longer, to speak with some of the police officers.

1201
01:22:25,454 --> 01:22:30,938
[SPEAKER_05]: And a few things that they mentioned to me, I think most people may even find a little surprising.

1202
01:22:31,939 --> 01:22:37,824
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a lot of support among police officers regarding civilian review boards, Mr. President.

1203
01:22:38,484 --> 01:22:43,969
[SPEAKER_05]: And with the one caveat that if you do set up a board that it be

1204
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:53,252
[SPEAKER_05]: manned with people that have a working knowledge of how a police department operates, the role of a police department.

1205
01:22:53,692 --> 01:22:56,373
[SPEAKER_05]: So they are open to that, Mr. President.

1206
01:22:57,073 --> 01:23:04,595
[SPEAKER_05]: The union, according to Harold McGillivray, has met with the administration and wants to implement cameras.

1207
01:23:05,375 --> 01:23:09,538
[SPEAKER_05]: for not only the safety of the general public, but for the safety of the officers.

1208
01:23:10,038 --> 01:23:18,384
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's another thing, Mr. President, I think that if we start talking reform, that I think we have more in common, Mr. President.

1209
01:23:18,864 --> 01:23:25,609
[SPEAKER_05]: The last point I'd like to make, and I said this last week, and I think there's a lot of support for it.

1210
01:23:26,610 --> 01:23:29,772
[SPEAKER_05]: We rely on our police department for almost everything.

1211
01:23:30,332 --> 01:23:35,535
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they're the only department open seven days a week, 24 hours a day.

1212
01:23:36,196 --> 01:23:44,021
[SPEAKER_05]: So when something happens in the community, Mr. President, you know, and it's after five o'clock, we just don't say, well, you know what, we'll handle it tomorrow.

1213
01:23:44,481 --> 01:23:46,703
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the police department that responds.

1214
01:23:47,303 --> 01:23:54,308
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're asking the men and women of our police department, Mr. President, to respond to issues of domestic violence.

1215
01:23:54,868 --> 01:23:59,351
[SPEAKER_05]: We're asking them to respond to drug issues and people that are ODing.

1216
01:23:59,671 --> 01:24:02,613
[SPEAKER_05]: We're asking them to respond to mental health issues.

1217
01:24:02,953 --> 01:24:06,416
[SPEAKER_05]: We're asking them to respond to social issues, Mr. President.

1218
01:24:07,016 --> 01:24:21,486
[SPEAKER_05]: And in my opinion, we're asking them to do a lot in addition to what their main responsibility is, is to keep public order and to prevent crimes and to protect the life and liberty of property.

1219
01:24:24,164 --> 01:24:26,285
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a lot on their plate, Mr. President.

1220
01:24:26,805 --> 01:24:37,371
[SPEAKER_05]: And from what I'm hearing from people when they talk about cutting the police department or defunding the police department, I think it has very many meanings.

1221
01:24:38,131 --> 01:24:42,373
[SPEAKER_05]: And from what I'm hearing from a lot of people is they don't necessarily want to cut the police.

1222
01:24:42,994 --> 01:24:47,216
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to give the assistance they believe the police officers should have.

1223
01:24:47,816 --> 01:24:51,138
[SPEAKER_05]: So if there's a call, Mr. President, regarding domestic violence,

1224
01:24:51,858 --> 01:25:02,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not have someone that's a domestic violence specialist, Mr. President, on hand that can go to calls, Mr. President, that can attend calls, that can assist?

1225
01:25:02,546 --> 01:25:08,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not have someone that's a social worker that can attend calls, Mr. President, that may require that?

1226
01:25:08,510 --> 01:25:10,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Or someone that has a mental health background

1227
01:25:11,172 --> 01:25:14,113
[SPEAKER_05]: if the issue requires mental health, Mr. President.

1228
01:25:14,513 --> 01:25:20,414
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of ways we can assist the police department, Mr. President, and provide the safety, which I agree.

1229
01:25:21,154 --> 01:25:26,475
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we may have issues that are happening in the community that require other expertise.

1230
01:25:26,995 --> 01:25:34,316
[SPEAKER_05]: And why not have the availability, Mr. President, and the availability to de-escalate situations?

1231
01:25:35,016 --> 01:25:39,437
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think there's a lot more in common than we realize

1232
01:25:39,957 --> 01:25:44,881
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there would be a lot more support out there, Mr. President, once these discussions are had.

1233
01:25:45,341 --> 01:25:51,285
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we're going to move towards police reform that's going to be acceptable to everyone, Mr. President.

1234
01:25:51,586 --> 01:25:52,546
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be a win-win.

1235
01:25:53,167 --> 01:26:04,535
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that will not only improve communications within our community, but it'll also assist the brave men and women in our police department, Mr. President, to do their very taxing job.

1236
01:26:05,273 --> 01:26:13,338
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I think we all want to arrive at the same results, Mr. President, and that is to provide a safe community.

1237
01:26:13,658 --> 01:26:19,461
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the number one job of the Medford City Council, is to provide a safe community, Mr. President.

1238
01:26:19,861 --> 01:26:23,383
[SPEAKER_05]: And without public safety, we have nothing else in the community.

1239
01:26:24,124 --> 01:26:25,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1240
01:26:25,565 --> 01:26:26,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1241
01:26:26,545 --> 01:26:29,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1242
01:26:29,087 --> 01:26:29,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1243
01:26:29,967 --> 01:26:32,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the speaker for bringing this forward.

1244
01:26:33,825 --> 01:26:39,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks hit the nail on the head as I've been following, working in some of them, following what's going on in Cambridge.

1245
01:26:39,966 --> 01:26:46,387
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it was Councilor Simmons in Cambridge stated that it's a little different in Cambridge.

1246
01:26:46,447 --> 01:26:51,388
[SPEAKER_07]: He feels that looking at different police departments, you have different levels.

1247
01:26:51,468 --> 01:27:02,610
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm confident and I'm excited that talking with Chief Buckley, he is willing and ready to listen and move forward some of these important

1248
01:27:03,518 --> 01:27:10,783
[SPEAKER_07]: important issues, and I think we're going to be pleased, and I'm excited to see the changes.

1249
01:27:10,843 --> 01:27:14,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I asked for a forum a couple of weeks ago.

1250
01:27:14,846 --> 01:27:18,128
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still waiting for the city administration to get back to me.

1251
01:27:18,608 --> 01:27:28,115
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's important that we bring the community members to the table and sit with our administration to make sure we find best practices.

1252
01:27:29,475 --> 01:27:33,898
[SPEAKER_07]: On a side note, I want to thank our men and women of the police force.

1253
01:27:34,358 --> 01:27:48,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Just this past Sunday, we had a shooting over on Salt and Salt Road, and talking to neighbors and family members that live in that area, the response from both the Medford police and state police were amazing.

1254
01:27:50,951 --> 01:28:12,052
[SPEAKER_07]: I know they have a good handle on what happened and who's doing it, who did that, and they're gonna work quickly, but I wanna give them a round of applause because, again, I don't think anybody, a speaker who brought this forward, I don't think anybody is saying that, is not saying that,

1255
01:28:12,913 --> 01:28:25,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for being the first ones in the fire, per se, and sticking your neck out in the hopes of saving lives here in Medford.

1256
01:28:25,882 --> 01:28:29,344
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that we can't look past that.

1257
01:28:29,384 --> 01:28:36,088
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that this is a bigger piece, both on the police department side and what's happening in our society.

1258
01:28:36,148 --> 01:28:38,670
[SPEAKER_09]: So I thank you for the time and thank you for bringing this forward.

1259
01:28:47,134 --> 01:28:48,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1260
01:28:49,115 --> 01:28:51,896
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a number of, any other comments from the council?

1261
01:28:52,776 --> 01:28:54,917
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a number of residents that would like to speak on this issue.

1262
01:28:55,277 --> 01:28:57,878
[SPEAKER_06]: The first would be Steve Harris.

1263
01:28:57,918 --> 01:29:00,779
[SPEAKER_09]: If we could please have your name and address for the record, please.

1264
01:29:00,799 --> 01:29:10,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Steve Harris, name and address for the record.

1265
01:29:11,662 --> 01:29:14,704
[SPEAKER_10]: President Falco takes the bus every day.

1266
01:29:14,744 --> 01:29:15,804
[SPEAKER_10]: I couldn't say a better name,

1267
01:29:18,976 --> 01:29:20,017
[SPEAKER_06]: I will come back to Steve.

1268
01:29:20,117 --> 01:29:22,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Nate Merritt, name and address for the record, please.

1269
01:29:24,939 --> 01:29:27,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave in Medford.

1270
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:31,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all for taking my comments.

1271
01:29:31,602 --> 01:29:36,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for a point of information for Councilor Martz, last time I checked, the fire department also runs 24-7, 365.

1272
01:29:37,164 --> 01:29:42,187
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be two departments minimum in your city, not just the police department.

1273
01:29:42,447 --> 01:29:44,087
[SPEAKER_01]: But just wanted to give credit where it's due.

1274
01:29:45,862 --> 01:29:50,610
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a very personal story and I know some of you on the council have known me for a number of years.

1275
01:29:51,451 --> 01:29:54,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Last Wednesday, someone decided to break into my home.

1276
01:29:55,798 --> 01:29:57,801
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a wife, I have a baby on the way.

1277
01:29:58,965 --> 01:30:08,708
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will tell you that the Medford police responded very quickly, very professionally, and we couldn't thank them enough for being available as quick as they were.

1278
01:30:09,408 --> 01:30:11,508
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from a small town in Western Massachusetts.

1279
01:30:12,209 --> 01:30:18,910
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very familiar with, you know, how it can be where you live in a town where it can take 10 minutes, right?

1280
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:20,971
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 minutes for help to arrive.

1281
01:30:21,809 --> 01:30:23,070
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just sheer distance.

1282
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:26,992
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not because there's, you know, it's a lack of budget, but it's also sheer distance.

1283
01:30:27,032 --> 01:30:34,115
[SPEAKER_01]: And if someone's on the wrong side of town or the opposite side of town, it's just sheer distance versus time versus how fast can they go down the road.

1284
01:30:35,596 --> 01:30:41,579
[SPEAKER_01]: People in the Eastern Massachusetts area should be very thankful for the fact that they have the resources they do.

1285
01:30:41,659 --> 01:30:45,101
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have volunteer fire departments in the greater Boston area.

1286
01:30:45,501 --> 01:30:47,722
[SPEAKER_01]: You do up on the North shore, you do in Western Mass.

1287
01:30:48,162 --> 01:30:49,283
[SPEAKER_01]: When I lived in Syracuse,

1288
01:30:50,573 --> 01:30:54,814
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what it's like to have sheriffs respond because you don't have a local police force.

1289
01:30:55,654 --> 01:31:00,516
[SPEAKER_01]: And when someone needs your help, it, you know, minutes seem like hours.

1290
01:31:01,136 --> 01:31:02,536
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a public servant myself.

1291
01:31:02,616 --> 01:31:03,657
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an EMT basic.

1292
01:31:03,697 --> 01:31:05,297
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been one for over 20 years.

1293
01:31:05,937 --> 01:31:08,698
[SPEAKER_01]: There are probably people, you know, that have been helped trained by me.

1294
01:31:10,608 --> 01:31:21,021
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say that I would take very much a bit of caution when we start talking about removing funding or reappropriating funding from your public services here.

1295
01:31:21,041 --> 01:31:23,564
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a taxpayer just like everyone else.

1296
01:31:24,285 --> 01:31:25,807
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to use money efficiently.

1297
01:31:27,052 --> 01:31:40,257
[SPEAKER_01]: and put it in the right spot, but we shouldn't be having knee-jerk reactions because when you want the help, there is nothing that you will want to stand in your way to enable them to come help you.

1298
01:31:40,357 --> 01:31:47,780
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we say we're going to reappropriate funding and reduce funding, instead, let's try to look at problems that need to be solved.

1299
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:55,042
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't disagree with anyone that's talking about, lack of better term, cleaning up the act when there's bad behavior.

1300
01:31:57,678 --> 01:32:02,421
[SPEAKER_01]: the police that we have here, in my opinion, are already overtaxed to begin with.

1301
01:32:03,001 --> 01:32:07,663
[SPEAKER_01]: And when seconds are counting, you're gonna want the help when you can get it.

1302
01:32:07,924 --> 01:32:11,005
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, thank you.

1303
01:32:11,385 --> 01:32:17,249
[SPEAKER_01]: My personal thanks to Medford PD for responding as quickly as they did, being professional as they were.

1304
01:32:17,909 --> 01:32:24,712
[SPEAKER_01]: And to Councilor Scarpelli's point, I'd actually like to be very much part of that public discussion that occurs,

1305
01:32:27,034 --> 01:32:28,575
[SPEAKER_01]: the police department and whatnot.

1306
01:32:29,656 --> 01:32:38,400
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, just a note for Councilor Knight, you can use the dialing number for Zoom and it might be a good alternative.

1307
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:42,602
[SPEAKER_01]: I know being a person that used it myself a lot for meetings, that's a good alternative.

1308
01:32:42,622 --> 01:32:46,564
[SPEAKER_01]: You can call in on your cell phone and sometimes you have a much more reliable connection.

1309
01:32:46,945 --> 01:32:51,067
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still keep the video up on internet, but at least you can get your audio through without having a text message.

1310
01:32:51,767 --> 01:32:52,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

1311
01:32:57,731 --> 01:32:59,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, any other questions in the council?

1312
01:33:02,093 --> 01:33:07,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Kleiner, we thank you for bringing this issue forward tonight and talking about this.

1313
01:33:08,056 --> 01:33:11,798
[SPEAKER_06]: And we appreciate you weighing in and appreciate the comments from the councilors as well.

1314
01:33:12,619 --> 01:33:12,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1315
01:33:16,641 --> 01:33:19,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, are the records the...

1316
01:33:23,952 --> 01:33:24,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President?

1317
01:33:25,073 --> 01:33:25,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1318
01:33:26,474 --> 01:33:27,935
[SPEAKER_08]: You asked about the records?

1319
01:33:28,816 --> 01:33:29,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1320
01:33:29,096 --> 01:33:31,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the next thing left on the agenda?

1321
01:33:31,338 --> 01:33:39,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, unless there's anybody else who wants to speak in the public participation part of the records of the next... I didn't see anyone else, but if there is, they're more than welcome to.

1322
01:33:39,364 --> 01:33:40,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's check again.

1323
01:33:40,205 --> 01:33:42,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anybody else want to speak on that last issue?

1324
01:33:44,248 --> 01:33:44,988
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see anybody else.

1325
01:33:45,049 --> 01:33:46,089
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see any other hands raised.

1326
01:33:46,650 --> 01:33:47,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing and seeing none.

1327
01:33:48,151 --> 01:33:48,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Records.

1328
01:33:48,731 --> 01:33:50,613
[SPEAKER_06]: The records from the meeting of

1329
01:33:52,058 --> 01:33:56,900
[SPEAKER_06]: The table records from the meeting of June 2nd, 2020 were passed to Councilor Knight.

1330
01:33:57,140 --> 01:33:58,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight, how did you find those records?

1331
01:34:00,621 --> 01:34:04,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco, Councilor Knight has no, I think he's out.

1332
01:34:05,142 --> 01:34:07,463
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good, I have audio.

1333
01:34:07,963 --> 01:34:09,764
[SPEAKER_02]: If I turn on my video, I have no audio.

1334
01:34:09,824 --> 01:34:12,105
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I turn on my audio, my video gets messed up.

1335
01:34:12,425 --> 01:34:14,445
[SPEAKER_02]: But I find the records in order to move for approval.

1336
01:34:15,426 --> 01:34:18,167
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to approve the record, seconded by?

[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize, Councilor Marks.

1354

[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Marks.

1356
01:34:52,732 --> 01:34:53,312
[SPEAKER_08]: What would you like?

1357
01:34:53,653 --> 01:34:55,874
[SPEAKER_08]: You should vote no just because on that one.

1358
01:34:57,295 --> 01:34:57,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1359
01:34:57,735 --> 01:35:03,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to adjourn.

01:35:04,937 --> 01:35:06,979
[SPEAKER_08]: There's another set of records.

1361
01:35:07,339 --> 01:35:10,141
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in the negative, the motion passes, the records are approved.

1362
01:35:10,762 --> 01:35:13,704
[SPEAKER_06]: The records of the meeting of June 9th were passed to Council of Marks.

1363
01:35:13,764 --> 01:35:15,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Council of Marks, how did you find those records?

1364
01:35:16,546 --> 01:35:18,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I didn't have a chance to review.

1365
01:35:18,648 --> 01:35:20,649
[SPEAKER_05]: I would ask that they lay on the table.

1366
01:35:21,430 --> 01:35:25,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, on the motion of Council of Marks to table the records to next week, seconded by?

1384
01:36:02,819 --> 01:36:03,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that him?

1385
01:36:08,263 --> 01:36:12,985
[SPEAKER_08]: He was indicating approval before the motion to table, but there's a different motion.

1386
01:36:13,025 --> 01:36:16,367
[SPEAKER_08]: So mark him as because of an internet connection.

1387
01:36:17,308 --> 01:36:17,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hang on.
