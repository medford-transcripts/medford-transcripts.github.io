1
00:00:00,387 --> 00:00:02,448
Councilor Ney?

2
00:00:02,608 --> 00:00:02,889
Present.

3
00:00:03,329 --> 00:00:03,969
Councilor Kerr?

4
00:00:03,989 --> 00:00:04,189
Present.

5
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:05,570
Councilor Mox?

6
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:06,351
Present.

7
00:00:06,791 --> 00:00:07,492
Councilor Penta?

8
00:00:08,512 --> 00:00:08,852
Present.

9
00:00:09,013 --> 00:00:09,553
President Camuso?

10
00:00:09,693 --> 00:00:10,053
Present.

11
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,634
Six members present, one absent.

12
00:00:11,734 --> 00:00:13,195
Please rise to salute our flag.

13
00:00:14,396 --> 00:00:25,383
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,961
Item 14-762, offered by Councilor Knight.

15
00:00:30,561 --> 00:00:38,784
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Michael Ryan on his retirement from the position of Executive Director for the Friends of the Middlesex Fells Reservation.

16
00:00:39,404 --> 00:00:47,287
Be it further resolved the Medford City Council thank him for his many years of service toward protecting, preserving, and advocating for the Middlesex Fells Reservation.

17
00:00:47,887 --> 00:00:48,407
Councilor Knight.

18
00:00:48,847 --> 00:00:50,228
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

19
00:00:50,288 --> 00:00:54,549
I believe if my facts and figures are correct that Mr. Ryan served

20
00:00:55,551 --> 00:00:59,853
14 years as the executive director with the Friends of the Middlesex Fells, and at the end of November, he retired.

21
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:03,755
And I'd like the council to join me in wishing him a very fond farewell.

22
00:01:04,135 --> 00:01:09,597
He did a great job down there, and I think the fruits of his labor proved to be rather bountiful.

23
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:19,762
The Department of Conservation and Recreation just recently released a master plan for a recreation plan for the Middlesex Fells, and a lot of that had to do with the work that Mr. Ryan did.

24
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:20,770
Mr. President.

25
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,813
So I'd ask that my council colleagues join me in congratulating him on his retirement and wishing him the best.

26
00:01:24,893 --> 00:01:25,693
Thank you for his service.

27
00:01:25,713 --> 00:01:26,433
Thank you.

28
00:01:26,473 --> 00:01:27,954
Counsel on the motion of council on night.

29
00:01:28,094 --> 00:01:30,015
All those in favor, all those opposed.

30
00:01:30,035 --> 00:01:30,616
The ayes have it.

31
00:01:32,177 --> 00:01:35,338
Item 14 dash seven 63 offered by counselor night.

32
00:01:35,658 --> 00:01:36,259
Be it resolved.

33
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:42,482
The Medford city council extends its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Irene platty on her recent passing.

34
00:01:42,942 --> 00:01:43,463
Counselor night.

35
00:01:44,423 --> 00:01:45,884
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

36
00:01:45,904 --> 00:01:47,745
The platties have been longtime family friends.

37
00:01:48,363 --> 00:01:54,386
I had the pleasure of meeting Irene and her son Joe during my time as an aide to Charlie Shannon in the state Senate.

38
00:01:54,506 --> 00:01:56,307
Since that time we developed a great friendship.

39
00:01:57,067 --> 00:02:00,969
Irene was a dedicated public service, a dedicated public servant.

40
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:07,992
She spent a number of years as a cafeteria worker here in the city of Medford and we offer our deepest condolences to the family.

41
00:02:08,993 --> 00:02:09,313
Thank you.

42
00:02:09,353 --> 00:02:11,114
Counsel, please rise for a moment of silence.

43
00:02:17,807 --> 00:02:19,048
On the motion, all those in favor?

44
00:02:19,528 --> 00:02:22,831
All those opposed?

45
00:02:23,091 --> 00:02:24,132
The ayes have it.

46
00:02:24,152 --> 00:02:24,512
Item 14-764.

47
00:02:25,493 --> 00:02:28,755
Petition for a secondhand article licensed by Nyan Group, Inc.

48
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,878
Doing business as Cache Point, 32 Riverside Avenue, Medford, Mass.

49
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:41,064
Marat Hananyan, President, 36 Owen Street, Hyannis, Mass.

50
00:02:41,084 --> 00:02:44,347
And the Chair recognizes Vice President Caraviello, Chair of Personal Licensing.

51
00:02:44,807 --> 00:02:45,608
Thank you, Mr. President.

52
00:02:47,262 --> 00:02:51,385
President, I reviewed the papers and I find them everything in order.

53
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:52,786
Mr. President, I have one question.

54
00:02:54,508 --> 00:03:01,454
We still have that something on our calendar for the other business that was on Salem Street?

55
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,416
Has that issue ever been resolved?

56
00:03:05,036 --> 00:03:10,361
The Chief of Police will notify us through the city solicitor and the clerk when he is ready to proceed.

57
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:13,804
It's still pending in the Middlesex court.

58
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:15,725
Thank you.

59
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:20,759
Everything seems to be in order Mr. President and a motion for approval.

60
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:22,299
On the motion of approval.

61
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,760
All those in favor.

62
00:03:24,721 --> 00:03:25,521
All those opposed.

63
00:03:26,602 --> 00:03:28,283
Counselor Penta on the motion.

64
00:03:28,303 --> 00:03:34,546
Could you explain to the people who might be watching, have no idea, location, hours of operation and what you intend to do?

65
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:35,567
Yes.

66
00:03:35,627 --> 00:03:36,107
Counselor.

67
00:03:36,427 --> 00:03:38,468
Mr. President, counsel is Richard Villiardi.

68
00:03:38,488 --> 00:03:40,350
I'm the attorney representing the applicant.

69
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,532
Uh, property location is 32 Riverside Ave.

70
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,042
It's approximately a storefront of 1,900 square feet.

71
00:03:49,722 --> 00:03:52,003
The hours of operation will be 9 a.m.

72
00:03:52,043 --> 00:03:53,223
to 7 p.m.

73
00:03:54,164 --> 00:03:55,304
closed on Sunday.

74
00:03:55,964 --> 00:04:04,568
The applicant, the president of the corporation, Merak Hunanian, will be a hands-on owner of the store.

75
00:04:04,988 --> 00:04:12,711
He intends to work the store himself for the first year to get the premises established, the store established,

76
00:04:13,307 --> 00:04:16,288
and then at the end of the year, hire someone to run it.

77
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:32,514
He also has stores in Revere and two stores on Cape Cod, one in Hyannis, one in Falmouth, and has a tremendous amount of experience as a secondhand goods dealer.

78
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,596
No complaints at any of the other stores.

79
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:40,518
And we ask that the council request

80
00:04:42,184 --> 00:04:44,325
Council, grant the license favorably.

81
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:48,526
Could you, again, what's at the present location?

82
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:50,987
The location is 32.

83
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:52,248
What's there right now, sir?

84
00:04:53,108 --> 00:04:54,789
I believe it's vacant at the present time.

85
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:56,029
What's on either side?

86
00:04:56,049 --> 00:05:00,071
There's a restaurant next door.

87
00:05:01,231 --> 00:05:06,053
I think there's a Mexican restaurant on one side and a diner on the other side.

88
00:05:07,193 --> 00:05:08,634
Councilor, I think it's the old VIP.

89
00:05:08,654 --> 00:05:09,994
The old TV3, it's one of the others.

90
00:05:11,832 --> 00:05:14,955
Yes, yes, yes, VIP is actually, yes, vacant.

91
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:18,238
And again, could you just repeat your hours of operation?

92
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:19,459
I'm sorry?

93
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:22,161
Hours of operation again, one more time.

94
00:05:22,181 --> 00:05:22,442
9 to 7.

95
00:05:22,562 --> 00:05:22,762
9 to 7.

96
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,043
7 days a week?

97
00:05:24,063 --> 00:05:25,965
6 days.

98
00:05:25,985 --> 00:05:26,766
6, Monday through Friday.

99
00:05:27,746 --> 00:05:29,848
Monday through Saturday, closed on Sunday.

100
00:05:35,442 --> 00:05:36,743
On the motion, all those in favor?

101
00:05:37,924 --> 00:05:38,564
All those opposed?

102
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:39,565
The ayes have it, good luck.

103
00:05:40,285 --> 00:05:43,627
And you will be meeting with Detective LeBert, it says, prior to opening, correct?

104
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:45,408
Thank you very much.

105
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:58,376
Item 14-765, petition for a taxi operator licensed by Albert T. Morenci, 92 Dever Street, Malden, Mass., driving for Citywide Taxi, 40 Canal Street.

106
00:05:59,596 --> 00:06:00,677
Name and address for the record.

107
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:09,171
My name is Albert Morenci, I live in 92 Davis Street, Morden, apartment 203.

108
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:13,612
Chair recognizes Vice President Caraviello.

109
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:14,532
Thank you, Mr. President.

110
00:06:14,732 --> 00:06:17,452
I reviewed everything that seems to be in order here.

111
00:06:17,532 --> 00:06:18,733
I have a couple of questions.

112
00:06:19,173 --> 00:06:23,554
I see you hold a license in another city, assuming that's Boston?

113
00:06:24,034 --> 00:06:24,214
Yes.

114
00:06:24,954 --> 00:06:26,594
Why are you not driving in Boston anymore?

115
00:06:27,294 --> 00:06:29,455
Because the Uber situation take me out of business.

116
00:06:30,193 --> 00:06:31,313
The Ubers put you out of business?

117
00:06:31,854 --> 00:06:33,114
Yes.

118
00:06:33,174 --> 00:06:34,594
And then I live in Mordor.

119
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:37,055
And you feel you can make more money in Medford than you can in Boston?

120
00:06:38,496 --> 00:06:38,896
Excuse me?

121
00:06:38,936 --> 00:06:39,216
Pardon me?

122
00:06:39,436 --> 00:06:43,837
You feel you can make more money in Medford than you can in the city of Boston?

123
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:44,658
Yes, I believe so.

124
00:06:44,818 --> 00:06:49,619
You know that your license in Medford is only you cannot go to Boston to pick up people.

125
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:49,999
You know that?

126
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:51,020
Yes, sir.

127
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:58,262
And you also understand that you cannot deny anyone a ride because you feel that the job is too short.

128
00:06:59,010 --> 00:06:59,470
Definitely.

129
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,131
You understand that also, correct?

130
00:07:01,151 --> 00:07:01,271
Yes.

131
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:01,731
Yes.

132
00:07:01,771 --> 00:07:03,231
So you'll take all jobs.

133
00:07:03,251 --> 00:07:05,892
You won't be denying anybody because it's only a short job.

134
00:07:06,832 --> 00:07:06,992
Yes.

135
00:07:07,012 --> 00:07:07,252
Correct?

136
00:07:07,472 --> 00:07:08,033
Yes, correct.

137
00:07:09,073 --> 00:07:13,414
Mr. President, I find the papers in order and motion for approval.

138
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:14,354
Okay.

139
00:07:14,394 --> 00:07:16,435
On the motion of approval, Councilor Marks.

140
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:19,016
Thank you, Mr. President.

141
00:07:19,216 --> 00:07:26,818
Uh, if you can record me in opposition, uh, until we come up with, uh, an ordinance to cover the taxi licenses, Mr. President,

142
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,689
As well as Councilor Penta, certainly will do.

143
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,271
On the motion, all those in favor?

144
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:33,731
Aye.

145
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:34,932
All those opposed?

146
00:07:34,972 --> 00:07:35,552
The ayes have it.

147
00:07:35,592 --> 00:07:35,933
Good luck.

148
00:07:36,313 --> 00:07:36,693
Thank you.

149
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:46,581
Item 14-766, petition by Joseph Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, to discuss West Medford Hillside Little League and non-profit finances.

150
00:07:56,938 --> 00:07:57,799
Thank you very much.

151
00:07:58,299 --> 00:07:59,319
May I use this mic?

152
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:00,420
Is that working, that mic?

153
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:01,821
Is it?

154
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:02,922
Okay.

155
00:08:04,122 --> 00:08:06,884
Joseph Filion, 59 Garfield Ave., Medford, Mass.

156
00:08:10,346 --> 00:08:11,767
Good evening, city council.

157
00:08:12,327 --> 00:08:14,369
Happy holidays and Merry Christmas.

158
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:26,149
West Medford Hillside Little League, Stanley and Stephen Comins were sentenced, and the question today is, how can the public utilizing resources of these nonprofits be protected in the future?

159
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:34,211
Going forward, what mechanisms are in place to safeguard the community's investments of time, money, and resources?

160
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:39,493
Didn't West Medford Hillside's Little League use the city's ballparks to operate?

161
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:47,455
shouldn't the school committee and the city council have a right to look into the inner workings of private corporations that are involved with the students?

162
00:08:47,976 --> 00:09:07,551
My point is, if you're using something that has to do with the city of Medford, be it a ballpark, a skating rink, the Chevalier Theater, our elected officials, city council, school committee, Senator Jalen, State Rep Donato, Sean Garbali, anyone elected

163
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:17,722
should be able to look at the books or anything or don't allow these people to utilize the city resources.

164
00:09:17,782 --> 00:09:18,483
That's my point.

165
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:28,209
If the mayor or the city doesn't have an appointee to these boards, they should have no right to a skating rink or a ball field or a swimming pool that the city owns.

166
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:33,452
Mayor McGlynn met with me in October of 2006 about one of these corporations.

167
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:39,832
The mayor has the ability to put an appointee on the boards of the Medford Housing Authority or the Access TV station.

168
00:09:40,712 --> 00:09:52,677
Shouldn't City Hall be able to have an appointee to any corporation, for-profit or non-profit, utilizing any city resources, from land to stadiums, to television equipment, or to public safety equipment and personnel?

169
00:09:53,797 --> 00:09:55,778
Let's investigate the issue further.

170
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,201
And I apologize, I was collating the material which I had just

171
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:18,305
put together, I have handed out to the city council a public records request that I am going to request this city council look at, consider, and bring to Mark Rumley.

172
00:10:19,905 --> 00:10:26,448
In July of this year, Mark Rumley told the Meffert Transcript that he wanted the books of one of these nonprofits.

173
00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:28,988
To this date, he has not received them.

174
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,069
Now, Mr. Rumley has been very nice to me about this.

175
00:10:31,109 --> 00:10:33,030
He said I'll be the first person he calls.

176
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,111
when he gets the information.

177
00:10:36,372 --> 00:10:39,393
Now, he's awaiting information from the Attorney General's office.

178
00:10:41,235 --> 00:10:45,217
I have the Secretary of State asking the Attorney General's office to get me that information.

179
00:10:46,218 --> 00:10:47,298
Mr. Rumley is waiting for that.

180
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:49,080
This is separate.

181
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:55,183
The Attorney General's information on this nonprofit and method is separate from what Mark Rumley is asking for.

182
00:10:55,844 --> 00:11:02,088
So I'm asking the Council President and the six other councilors to look at this public records request and consider

183
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:16,181
that we just go to City Hall and say, hey, you know, for elections, for a co-host of mine who does a sports show, he's been begging me to do something for him if I can.

184
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:20,223
And I think he talked to one of the city councilors this week, who's absent tonight.

185
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:24,264
But he said he spoke to him and he said, I want my sports show.

186
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:26,924
So that's my talk here tonight.

187
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:28,745
In light of the sentencing,

188
00:11:30,392 --> 00:11:54,460
of one of the non-profits, we finally see, oh, and a further point, that individual was in for 30 years, the mayor's only been in for 27 years, so the mayor could have at some point in time said, hey, Pop Warner, TV, Little League, maybe I should be a little proactive and say, hey, you're using my land, or our land, let's see, let's see what's going on here.

189
00:11:59,665 --> 00:12:00,385
movement on this.

190
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:02,927
Any questions?

191
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:04,028
Vice President Caravaglia.

192
00:12:04,748 --> 00:12:05,409
Thank you, Mr. President.

193
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:08,051
Mr. Bigelow, thank you for bringing this forward.

194
00:12:09,392 --> 00:12:10,132
I agree with you on this.

195
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:16,236
I myself have been involved with many youth organizations over the years and president of one of them.

196
00:12:17,097 --> 00:12:26,583
Unfortunately, it's not up to the city to go over the little leagues and it's up to the Attorney General's office to stay on top of these things.

197
00:12:27,424 --> 00:12:28,945
And the parents, I think this was

198
00:12:29,858 --> 00:12:32,079
A big wake-up call for a lot of the parents in the community.

199
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,021
Many people knew it had been going on for many years.

200
00:12:35,081 --> 00:12:42,285
And I would hope that people now will, there's a new group running West Buffalo now.

201
00:12:42,305 --> 00:12:44,586
They're doing a good job and they've consolidated.

202
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:49,849
I mean, all the other teams in the other cities, they only use our parks.

203
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:57,273
But in the years that I've been involved, we used to try to explain to people, do not pay cash to anybody.

204
00:12:57,913 --> 00:12:59,114
Pay check, pay by check.

205
00:13:01,462 --> 00:13:05,044
When people have cash in their hands, cash makes us bad things.

206
00:13:05,864 --> 00:13:13,807
And I say it's a shame that this had to happen, and I hope it's a wake-up call to the other leagues in this city and other cities around.

207
00:13:18,076 --> 00:13:20,998
Council Vice President, I know you do a good job for the youth in this city.

208
00:13:21,498 --> 00:13:26,501
I did meet with a government official by accident at the old Outback, someone from the Department of Revenue.

209
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,202
And I explained the situation.

210
00:13:28,262 --> 00:13:29,183
He said, we're overwhelmed.

211
00:13:29,663 --> 00:13:30,864
We don't have the manpower.

212
00:13:31,164 --> 00:13:36,587
And therein lies the problem when you go to the AG's office and Department of Revenue, they don't have the manpower.

213
00:13:36,687 --> 00:13:39,869
And that's how some of these people walk between the raindrops.

214
00:13:40,249 --> 00:13:43,471
Well, there's enough parents out there that are involved with these that should ask.

215
00:13:44,912 --> 00:13:45,873
We'd like to see the records.

216
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:51,783
Most organizations have an annual meeting where the records are supposed to be out there for everybody to look at.

217
00:13:52,824 --> 00:14:00,347
So I don't know if they're still doing that, but that's how we did it when I was involved with youth sports, but that's the normal procedure of how that's supposed to work.

218
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:02,788
Thank you.

219
00:14:03,388 --> 00:14:03,709
Thank you.

220
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:05,009
Councilor Penner.

221
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:06,170
Mr. Viglione.

222
00:14:09,311 --> 00:14:13,913
If I understood what you said correctly from reading, what you're basically asking is for our city solicitor

223
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:17,751
to respond back or report back on this public records request.

224
00:14:18,412 --> 00:14:20,676
And if nobody responds to them, so be it.

225
00:14:20,956 --> 00:14:25,523
At least the council is apprised as compared to the solicitors still waiting.

226
00:14:25,893 --> 00:14:27,474
to get information, correct?

227
00:14:27,554 --> 00:14:28,314
Is that what I understand?

228
00:14:28,474 --> 00:14:28,774
Correct.

229
00:14:28,814 --> 00:14:34,937
And from what I understand in talking to Mr. Rumley, he's asking for something separate from what the AG's office is asking.

230
00:14:34,977 --> 00:14:40,540
And I know it works kind of together, but his request is financial.

231
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,263
The AG's office might be financial as well, but there are different aspects to it that the city solicitor needs.

232
00:14:47,003 --> 00:14:54,347
If I understand 501c3 correctly between the federal IRS and the Commonwealth of Mass, Department of Revenue, there are certain requirements

233
00:14:54,845 --> 00:14:57,507
that are implicit in any one of these 501c3s.

234
00:14:57,887 --> 00:14:58,327
Absolutely.

235
00:14:58,827 --> 00:15:07,493
And there's requiring, there's time restrictions, a regulation basically talking about who the corporate officers might be, if any change of offices, elections, whatever it might be.

236
00:15:07,793 --> 00:15:11,075
Some of them are on an annual basis, and some of them are just when needs to be.

237
00:15:11,835 --> 00:15:24,423
The part that I, Councilor Caviello, the part that I think is a little perplexing here, when you say that, you know, parents have been involved for a long period of time, and maybe a long period of time they knew something was going on, they did nothing about it.

238
00:15:25,603 --> 00:15:27,724
Shame on them for allowing that to happen, okay?

239
00:15:28,624 --> 00:15:32,085
And there's no one to blame on that situation except them.

240
00:15:32,645 --> 00:15:36,586
Even if they had an iota, that something might smell wrong, they should have done that.

241
00:15:42,168 --> 00:15:44,669
Been asking is one thing and acting is another, okay?

242
00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:45,469
That's number one.

243
00:15:45,489 --> 00:15:51,531
Number two, just making a quick reflection back on cable television and Channel 3.

244
00:15:53,171 --> 00:16:01,977
The difference here, if I understand you correctly, Joe, is the West Memphis Little League is not the same as Memphis Community Access Television.

245
00:16:01,997 --> 00:16:07,101
The city has a direct person on community access.

246
00:16:07,141 --> 00:16:08,842
It's the mayor's appointment, as a matter of fact.

247
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:16,407
And having the mayor's appointment and not getting the information that is supposed to be given and retrieved, and not on an annual basis, there is something wrong.

248
00:16:16,447 --> 00:16:20,010
And I think it's as clearly defined with Judge Jackson's report that she wrote in

249
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:24,653
I believe it was December of 2011 or 12 or whatever it was.

250
00:16:24,673 --> 00:16:24,653
2009.

251
00:16:24,913 --> 00:16:25,373
2009, excuse me.

252
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:29,016
But with that, I've got no problem making this request.

253
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:45,990
And I don't think Mr. Remley will have any problem responding to it, too, because if he gets no response, that just puts more fodder into the argument with the AG and the Secretary of State's office that not only is our city solicitor waiting for information who's played somewhat of a role.

254
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,653
I don't know how deep we can say a role is because, unfortunately, he doesn't have the information.

255
00:16:50,187 --> 00:16:53,769
now to go forward and continue on what he needs to do.

256
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,290
But there is definitely something wrong.

257
00:16:56,171 --> 00:17:06,298
When you have a tax-exempt nonprofit sitting on, or the city sitting on, it's over $303,000 in the city's coffers downstairs right now, if not more.

258
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:14,143
And knowing that by, I think it's April 30th, a new contract has to come forward as it relates to Comcast, Verizon is still ongoing.

259
00:17:14,883 --> 00:17:17,165
The fact of the matter is this, that there is a time sequence.

260
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:19,027
that a public hearing needs to take place.

261
00:17:19,047 --> 00:17:20,187
And we've got no notification.

262
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:22,248
Ratepayers have received no notification.

263
00:17:22,348 --> 00:17:23,769
Nobody's received any notification.

264
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:28,570
And neither has the mayor responded to our request when and if the public hearing is going to take place.

265
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:32,092
So I see the analogy that you're trying to draw.

266
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:33,673
It's a shame that it took place.

267
00:17:33,693 --> 00:17:34,913
But you're right, Councilor Caviello.

268
00:17:35,453 --> 00:17:40,675
The parents on this one here in the West Memphis community, in the West Memphis Little League, the onus was on them.

269
00:17:40,775 --> 00:17:43,416
If they had an idea that something was wrong, they should have pursued it.

270
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:43,897
And they didn't.

271
00:17:44,457 --> 00:17:47,058
Thankfully, it got caught up to the people who were the perpetrators.

272
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,141
Channel 3, an entirely different story.

273
00:17:50,341 --> 00:17:53,322
I think that just escalates the situation right into the corner office.

274
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:54,923
It's his responsibility.

275
00:17:55,223 --> 00:17:56,263
He knew what was going on.

276
00:17:56,523 --> 00:17:57,804
We've asked for information.

277
00:17:57,844 --> 00:17:58,684
It hasn't come forward.

278
00:17:59,004 --> 00:18:06,307
The proper documentation has yet to be filed, to the best of my knowledge, with the AG's Office of the Secretary of State, maybe partially, not totally.

279
00:18:06,747 --> 00:18:17,812
And for the sake of having any kind of an argument, Channel 3 could still be legitimately an operating functional business here in the city of Medford, because they're alleging that they filed disillusion.

280
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,557
has never been accepted and recorded and duly noted.

281
00:18:20,577 --> 00:18:38,732
And if I remember correctly, I believe it was Candidate Coakley, who lives in Medford, who at some point in time, I think it was January of last year, indicated that she was going to look into this cable access and the public access area in the city of Medford because it's huge.

282
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:39,833
It's a big thing.

283
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:43,475
And I'm just going to detour real quick, Mr. President, on this.

284
00:18:44,016 --> 00:18:45,277
It'll come up under my suspension.

285
00:18:46,423 --> 00:18:57,011
But I have spoken to so many people since this Thanksgiving Day football game that are so upset that they couldn't watch it on their local access that they've had for years, as other cities and towns have it.

286
00:18:57,812 --> 00:19:05,738
One lady went out of her way, and she made a remark as it relates to one of the candidates running for governor, who happens to come from Medford.

287
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:06,639
I won't mention the name.

288
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:15,166
Totally disappointed that that individual did not pursue the fact that public access was not made available, not only for her, but every other candidate running.

289
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:26,161
And with that being said, there's a true concern here about not only money being misspent and misappropriated, but money being held in abeyance and no action taking place.

290
00:19:27,141 --> 00:19:29,042
And it just continues to go on.

291
00:19:29,623 --> 00:19:35,446
And unfortunately, ratepayers, each and every month when you get your bill, you're going to see the money that's going to be going there for public access TV.

292
00:19:35,746 --> 00:19:36,867
There's no public access TV.

293
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:39,768
I don't know what it's going to take to cause a storm.

294
00:19:40,229 --> 00:19:41,309
Same thing with your water bills.

295
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,231
It just keeps going up and up and up, and nobody says nothing about it.

296
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:47,695
So with that being said, Mr. President, I have no problem moving this forward.

297
00:19:47,715 --> 00:19:56,100
I don't think the city solicitor has any problem accepting it because if in fact he gets no response back as duly requested, at least we'll know and we'll all be on the same page.

298
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,461
And at least I think we can take the next step to go forward.

299
00:19:58,621 --> 00:19:59,382
That's how I'm viewing it.

300
00:19:59,502 --> 00:20:01,303
I could be wrong, but that's the way I'm looking at it.

301
00:20:01,643 --> 00:20:02,223
Councilor Marks.

302
00:20:03,424 --> 00:20:04,284
Thank you, Mr. President.

303
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:08,987
And the way I read this is that you're looking for financial data.

304
00:20:11,629 --> 00:20:13,730
Does this also include any inventory?

305
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:17,277
that the City of Method is now in receipt of.

306
00:20:18,238 --> 00:20:22,482
Have we ever received an itemized list of any inventory from Channel 3?

307
00:20:30,142 --> 00:20:32,403
Um, Mr. Romley has been very forthright with me.

308
00:20:32,923 --> 00:20:39,965
So, uh, he has that data, but I would like the city council, you people as elected officials should have that data as well.

309
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:45,047
But Mr. Romley, I believe has that data and the equipment is somewhere secure in Medford.

310
00:20:46,007 --> 00:20:47,628
I would like to use a camera this weekend.

311
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:51,689
I would like to be able to take a camera from somewhere and bring it back on Monday.

312
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:59,392
So, so Mr. President, if we could, and I have no problem asking for the financial data, I think that's appropriate.

313
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:13,328
but also if we can get an itemized list of the inventory that was received, and I know Mr. Rumley said that he has a number of items, and I believe he has a list, I just never, I've never seen it yet.

314
00:21:13,688 --> 00:21:16,750
So if we can add that to this resolution, I would be in full support.

315
00:21:17,211 --> 00:21:22,814
On the main motion, and amended by Councilor Marks for the itemized list, Councilor Lungo-Kern.

316
00:21:23,054 --> 00:21:24,815
Thank you, President Camuso.

317
00:21:25,055 --> 00:21:27,697
I think I have a number of questions too, but it's probably because

318
00:21:28,764 --> 00:21:40,212
The administration went and set up a three-person committee, and I'm not sure any of us behind the reel or in the audience know, whatever happened with the committee, what kind of outcome did they have?

319
00:21:40,572 --> 00:21:45,756
What is the mayor doing with the money, $303,000, that are sitting?

320
00:21:45,776 --> 00:21:50,159
There are taxpayers, cable ratepayers' monies that are just sitting.

321
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:51,920
We have no idea.

322
00:21:53,836 --> 00:21:57,157
what they're going to be used for, when they're going to be used, and when we're going to have a new station.

323
00:21:57,237 --> 00:22:08,522
So I'd like to also ask the administration, the mayor's office, I know we've asked before, but when are we going to have a station for the community, for the city of Medford?

324
00:22:09,542 --> 00:22:15,864
And if we're not going to do it anytime soon, if that's not the plan, then why are we taking from our cable ratepayers?

325
00:22:16,265 --> 00:22:22,147
Why am I, why am you, why are you paying every month a percentage

326
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,929
to just sit in the city's bank account.

327
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,490
It's the wrong thing to do.

328
00:22:28,551 --> 00:22:30,391
It's the wrong thing for the city to do.

329
00:22:30,471 --> 00:22:42,538
And as we spoke about it, I believe last week and the week before, there are cities and towns out there that have filed suit against their actual administration due to the fact that this is going on.

330
00:22:43,338 --> 00:22:44,459
We have a serious problem.

331
00:22:44,499 --> 00:22:48,741
TV3 has been a problem for the city of Medford for years and years and years.

332
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:53,103
Finally, something was done about it, and now we're back to having problems again.

333
00:22:53,443 --> 00:22:55,364
I don't understand what the holdup is.

334
00:22:55,384 --> 00:22:59,427
So I just wanna voice my frustration with the whole process.

335
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:01,529
You're right, you should be able to go get a camera.

336
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:09,915
So shouldn't a 15-year-old, 16-year-old high school student who wants to maybe get into communications, but we don't have that in the city of Medford right now, and that's unfortunate.

337
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,737
what Councilor Penta brought up about the football game.

338
00:23:13,378 --> 00:23:21,866
I was brought in about three, four years ago for Winthrop and we taped the Revere-Winthrop game and it was a joint effort by Winthrop Cable and Revere and they edited for us.

339
00:23:22,347 --> 00:23:23,287
I was one of the cameramen.

340
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:24,669
It is stunning.

341
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:29,694
Speaker DeLeo is on it because he's behind me so I go and get a comment from him on the show.

342
00:23:30,054 --> 00:23:43,261
You have this amazing show that the parents, the athletes, their friends, the cheerleaders, everyone enjoyed it, but we in Medford, the citizens aren't even aware of this because they don't have it, but they're paying for it.

343
00:23:43,802 --> 00:23:49,165
The football game, Councilor Penta, thank you, the Thanksgiving game is so key for our history.

344
00:23:50,545 --> 00:23:51,926
You know I'm a music historian.

345
00:23:52,046 --> 00:24:05,155
I would love to see, and I talked to Mr. Poleri about this in the good old days when we got along, putting a monthly review of the city, what we had on cable TV, in the library, so anyone could see January 2010, January 2002.

346
00:24:05,355 --> 00:24:13,100
Oh, highlights of the football game, highlights of the city council meeting, highlights of the, is tomorrow the tree lighting?

347
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:13,960
Yes.

348
00:24:14,321 --> 00:24:15,922
I went out and taped it for TV3.

349
00:24:15,942 --> 00:24:17,944
They asked me to go in the freezing cold in 2000.

350
00:24:18,644 --> 00:24:19,265
I was out there.

351
00:24:19,645 --> 00:24:20,866
Mayor McGuinn shook my hand.

352
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:21,687
He was smiling.

353
00:24:22,107 --> 00:24:23,208
Everything, everyone was happy.

354
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,490
It was a love fest, and I got it on tape for the city.

355
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,431
I volunteered when I lived in Woburn.

356
00:24:28,072 --> 00:24:30,294
I volunteered for this city, and it was freezing cold.

357
00:24:30,314 --> 00:24:33,076
I had to go across the street and get a scarf to put around my hand.

358
00:24:33,797 --> 00:24:37,460
That's how cold it was, and I volunteered for this city, and look where it got me.

359
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,860
Honest efforts and hard work.

360
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,781
But I thank the City Council, because this is important to me.

361
00:24:43,101 --> 00:24:44,742
It's important to John, the sports host.

362
00:24:46,362 --> 00:24:52,163
I think everyone knows the sports in this city could be documented, could be at the library, I don't care if it's soccer, basketball.

363
00:24:52,763 --> 00:24:55,044
We don't have that and other cities and towns do.

364
00:24:57,425 --> 00:25:02,346
On the motion of Councilor Penta, amended by Councilor Marks and Councilor Longo-Kern.

365
00:25:02,366 --> 00:25:03,086
All those in favor?

366
00:25:03,106 --> 00:25:03,586
Roll call.

367
00:25:03,846 --> 00:25:06,067
Roll call has been requested by Councilor Penta.

368
00:25:06,107 --> 00:25:07,087
Name and address for the record.

369
00:25:07,687 --> 00:25:12,830
Hi, Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street, and I'd just like to echo what Joe has to say about nonprofits and oversight.

370
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:16,392
And I totally agree with him if it has the name Medford in it.

371
00:25:17,801 --> 00:25:29,384
It should be open for anyone in this city, whether it's the Brooks Estates, the Royal House, literally anything that has to do with Medford absolutely should have oversight.

372
00:25:30,204 --> 00:25:35,965
And it should be, and I want to know, because I belong to the DAB, you all know, and the DAB does meet in a firehouse.

373
00:25:36,025 --> 00:25:38,926
It meets on a Medford property, and it does wonderful things.

374
00:25:38,966 --> 00:25:45,748
And we have strict rules about how the checks go out and come in, and there are spend-down requirements, and a whole host of things.

375
00:25:45,808 --> 00:25:47,628
I write down every check in six different places.

376
00:25:48,068 --> 00:25:58,380
including the meeting minutes, I scan them in, I have an electronic set of them, I have the receipts, and the state tells me to keep all receipts for seven years.

377
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,404
I don't know if the requirement is more than that, but that's what the state DAB told me to do.

378
00:26:02,905 --> 00:26:07,230
So I have no problem, if they are working in good faith,

379
00:26:08,153 --> 00:26:13,678
as an organization, they should not be afraid to show you their books, whatever the organization is.

380
00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:15,359
And I have no problem doing that.

381
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:26,710
So I just want to reiterate that anything that has to do with the properties of Medfit, because there's a lawsuit, you have a problem on a playground, you know, Medfit's on the hook for it.

382
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:33,956
So there is, you know, a private partnership, private-public partnership that has to happen more and more

383
00:26:35,225 --> 00:26:35,865
I hope that it does.

384
00:26:36,206 --> 00:26:37,086
So thank you for listening.

385
00:26:37,126 --> 00:26:39,868
And I just want to echo what he had to say about nonprofits and oversight.

386
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:40,568
Thank you.

387
00:26:41,129 --> 00:26:41,809
Thank you very much.

388
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:44,031
Roll call has been requested by Councilor Pinto.

389
00:26:44,051 --> 00:26:44,911

401
00:27:00,461 --> 00:27:00,701
No.

402
00:27:00,821 --> 00:27:02,222
For the affirmative, two in the negative.

403
00:27:02,282 --> 00:27:03,163
The motion passes.

404

407
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:17,848
To the President and members of the Honorable Medford City Council, from Michael J. McGlynn, Mayor.

408
00:27:18,308 --> 00:27:20,230

Uh, the amount of the request is $3,246.59.

412
00:27:32,832 --> 00:27:51,703
The claimant, Patricia DeJesus, 49 Chetwin Road, Somerville Mass, 02144, seeks compensation for damage to DeJesus's vehicle, which was allegedly struck by Medford Fire Department Engine 7, as Engine 7 was in the process of pulling out of a parking space in Hill Hall parking lot at Tufts University.

413
00:27:52,183 --> 00:27:53,984
The accident occurred on May 8th, 2014.

414
00:27:54,524 --> 00:27:56,125
The case was settled prior to trial.

415
00:27:56,703 --> 00:28:01,265
Necessary releases have been obtained from the claimant, and the total settlement is $3,246.59.

Thank you, Mr. President.

418
00:28:08,968 --> 00:28:12,270
Kimberly Scanlon, assistant city solicitor, 75 Ashcroft Road.

419
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,251
Any questions for the city solicitor or a motion?

420
00:28:15,751 --> 00:28:16,732
Motion for approval.

421
00:28:16,912 --> 00:28:18,932
Motion for approval by Vice President Caraviello.

422
00:28:19,012 --> 00:28:19,633
Councilor Penta.

423
00:28:19,813 --> 00:28:20,433
One quick question.

424
00:28:20,793 --> 00:28:24,115
The settlement is just for property damage, if I understand this correctly.

425
00:28:24,435 --> 00:28:24,835
Correct, yes.

426
00:28:25,053 --> 00:28:25,213
Right.

427
00:28:25,373 --> 00:28:26,694
Was there any damage to the firetruck?

428
00:28:27,495 --> 00:28:27,675
No.

429
00:28:29,516 --> 00:28:32,118

Yes.

432
00:28:38,662 --> 00:28:38,902
Yes.

433
00:28:39,983 --> 00:28:41,504
Yes.

434
00:28:41,524 --> 00:28:41,764
Yes.

437
00:28:44,226 --> 00:28:44,786

The claim has been approved.

439
00:28:48,249 --> 00:28:48,809
Merry Christmas.

440

Thank you.

441
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:49,990
Merry Christmas.

442
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:51,398
All right.

443
00:28:51,858 --> 00:28:55,719
On the motion of Councilor Henta for papers in the hands of the clerk.

444
00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:56,379
All those in favor?

445
00:28:56,739 --> 00:28:56,839
Aye.

446
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:57,719
All those opposed?

447
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,260
The ayes have it.

448
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:08,122
Offered by Councilor Mox, be it resolved that the shelter located at the corner of River Street and Riverside Ave next to the Harvard Van Guide Garage be discussed for potential community use.

449
00:29:08,682 --> 00:29:09,242
Councilor Mox.

450
00:29:10,262 --> 00:29:11,262
Thank you, Mr. President.

451
00:29:11,402 --> 00:29:13,763
Anyone familiar with this particular shelter?

452
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:23,100
Uh, it's across from the CVS on Riverside Ave, uh, right, uh, adjacent to the Harvard van God parking garage.

453
00:29:23,941 --> 00:29:32,743
And, uh, I had the opportunity just recently to, uh, actually go and sit underneath the shelter and just look around and see the condition of it.

454
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:41,846
And I was, uh, really, uh, taken back by, uh, the lack of, uh, maintenance, uh, for this particular shelter.

455
00:29:41,866 --> 00:29:43,046
The paint is,

456
00:29:43,674 --> 00:29:46,656
peeling off the side of the shelter itself.

457
00:29:47,096 --> 00:29:49,558
There are gutters that are missing and hanging off.

458
00:29:50,699 --> 00:29:53,520
Inside was in very dirty condition.

459
00:29:55,301 --> 00:30:04,347
I don't believe, I think the intention originally was to use this particular shelter for people waiting to catch the bus on the opposite side of Riverside Ave.

460
00:30:05,148 --> 00:30:10,551
And I for one have never seen anyone waiting for a bus in that particular shelter.

461
00:30:11,011 --> 00:30:11,592
I do see

462
00:30:12,607 --> 00:30:41,656
people hanging around in the shelter, which I'm not opposed to, but it crossed me when I was in it, Mr. President, that this would be an ideal location in the middle of Meffitt Square to possibly have some type of wall put around the perimeter, maybe three sides of it, and maybe for eight to 10 months a year, have an art gallery or some type of arts

463
00:30:42,209 --> 00:30:45,530
uh, located right in the smack of a method square.

464
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:52,611
Uh, you could also have a portion of it cause it's a good size, um, uh, coverage.

465
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:58,032
Uh, maybe you could put a portion as a fruit slash vegetable, uh, stand.

466
00:30:58,392 --> 00:31:11,715
There's so many different repurposes of that particular, um, uh, shelter that really is, in my opinion, an eyesore and not being used to its full potential.

467
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:13,759
And it's been like that for years.

468
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:14,720
It's not recent.

469
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,921
It's not the last week, month, year.

470
00:31:17,262 --> 00:31:19,103
It's been like that for years, Mr. President.

471
00:31:19,624 --> 00:31:31,673
And I would hope that the mayor takes this council vote, because I'm gonna ask for a vote that the city of Meffitt look at repurposing that particular shelter for other community uses.

472
00:31:32,514 --> 00:31:33,835
And I just throw out a couple.

473
00:31:33,895 --> 00:31:40,720
I'm sure there may be 20 or 30 other uses that residents or committee might have envisioned

474
00:31:41,467 --> 00:32:10,582
for that particular property, but it's a prime piece of property that right now is an eyesore and could have so many potential uses, and if you wanted to put a little heat inside of it and close it off and make it a glassed-in area, I mean, the potential is endless, and you could use it year-round, and you could provide more lighting in that particular area, because at night, if you ever walk down there, it's very dark on that side behind the cemetery, the Salem Street,

475
00:32:11,022 --> 00:32:13,523
uh, burial, uh, uh, cemetery.

476
00:32:14,184 --> 00:32:19,126
And, um, I would ask that, uh, we take a vote on this tonight to repurpose it.

477
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:29,791
Mr. President asked the mayor if, uh, he is too busy with a lot of other issues, maybe this council could take the ball and run with it and, uh, find a use for it.

478
00:32:30,171 --> 00:32:39,095
But I would like to start off with the administration, um, to repurpose that particular, uh, shelter on the motion of council of marks to council of Penta.

479
00:32:39,647 --> 00:32:41,388
On that motion, you jogged my memory.

480
00:32:41,408 --> 00:32:50,711
It goes back some years ago when former Councilor Mayorko introduced a resolution similar to that on buses, advertising for buses in the city of Medford.

481
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:55,153
I think the city generated something like 30, $35,000 a year by doing that.

482
00:32:55,593 --> 00:33:03,396
So maybe the advertising of outside vendors on that as a particular part of repurposing can bring in a few dollars, whatever it might be worth.

483
00:33:03,776 --> 00:33:05,537
And at the same time, you've accomplished two things.

484
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:07,717
Councilor Langelke.

485
00:33:08,338 --> 00:33:08,638
Thank you.

486
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,482
President Camuso, I think it's a good idea.

487
00:33:12,522 --> 00:33:17,965
I just would really recommend what you said after that, Council Member Marks, with regards to the lighting.

488
00:33:18,145 --> 00:33:30,292
I just wouldn't want it to turn into anything that we have in West Medford where the residents down in West Medford and those who take the commuter rail want to close off the nook part of, it's almost like a little shelter down there.

489
00:33:30,352 --> 00:33:35,115
They want to close it out because it brings such a bad element to that area.

490
00:33:35,175 --> 00:33:38,377
So I just would want to make sure there's enough lighting and make sure we don't,

491
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:42,422
to create that situation that we have in West Medford.

492
00:33:42,722 --> 00:33:44,683
But otherwise, you know, it's a good idea.

493
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:45,923
Councilor Knight.

494
00:33:46,844 --> 00:33:48,164
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

495
00:33:48,224 --> 00:33:50,465
Thank you, Councilor Mox, for bringing this resolution forward.

496
00:33:50,485 --> 00:33:51,686
I think this is a great idea.

497
00:33:51,746 --> 00:33:55,247
It's a great proactive approach to revitalizing our downtown business area.

498
00:33:56,087 --> 00:34:01,649
One of the things that I've seen in a lot of other communities is almost like a wall that would speak to the history of the area.

499
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:08,032
And I think when we look at, you know, the Salem Street Burial Ground and the history that Memphis Square has, that would be a perfect purpose for it.

500
00:34:08,828 --> 00:34:18,650
You know, if you see some of the things that we've done in our community here in Medford, we have a library that they opened up in West Medford Square, and it's just an open-air library, a box.

501
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:20,530
Simple, put a book in, take a book out.

502
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,150
Something like that would be a great idea down there as well.

503
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:30,132
I'm really impressed with Councilor Mark's foresight in bringing this matter to the table, and I'm wholeheartedly in support of it, Mr. President.

504
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:31,232
I think this is a great idea.

505
00:34:32,212 --> 00:34:32,852
On the motion.

506
00:34:32,992 --> 00:34:33,692
All those in favor?

507
00:34:33,712 --> 00:34:35,093
All those opposed?

508
00:34:35,133 --> 00:34:35,513
Roll call.

509
00:34:35,693 --> 00:34:37,513
Roll call has been requested by Councilor Marks.

510
00:34:40,964 --> 00:34:48,110
amended to include extra lighting to not have the behaviour that happens in the West Medford train depot lot, correct?

511
00:34:51,092 --> 00:34:51,572
Mr. Clerk.

512
00:34:55,615 --> 00:34:57,056
Vice-President Caviello.

513
00:34:57,076 --> 00:34:57,337
Yes.

514
00:34:57,937 --> 00:34:58,878
Councillor DelaRusso.

515
00:34:59,118 --> 00:34:59,658
Councillor Knight.

516
00:34:59,719 --> 00:34:59,939
Yes.

517
00:35:00,419 --> 00:35:01,180
Councillor O'Kerr.

518
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:01,640
Yes.

519
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,541
Councillor Marks.

520
00:35:02,781 --> 00:35:03,061
Yes.

521
00:35:03,241 --> 00:35:03,862
Councillor Penta.

522
00:35:03,882 --> 00:35:04,042
Yes.

523
00:35:04,572 --> 00:35:05,192
President Crusoe.

524
00:35:05,272 --> 00:35:06,913
Yes, six in the affirmative, one absent.

525
00:35:06,953 --> 00:35:07,993
The motion passes.

526
00:35:08,513 --> 00:35:13,115
Also, while we're under suspension, offered by Councilor Penta, 14-768.

527
00:35:13,435 --> 00:35:20,257
Be it resolved that the Medford High football team be congratulated on their well-earned football victory over Malden High this Thanksgiving day.

528
00:35:20,798 --> 00:35:21,418
Councilor Penta.

529
00:35:21,658 --> 00:35:30,701
Mr. President, this past Thursday, it was absolutely fabulous to see our Medford youngsters not only win, but win in a huge fashion.

530
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:33,002
I've been attending these games for the last,

531
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:34,607
56 years.

532
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:38,689
I only missed twice, and I believe both of them were called off because of inclement weather.

533
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:48,576
And as a result of that, I think I can speak with some sense of knowledge as it relates to what takes place during these particular games.

534
00:35:48,616 --> 00:35:51,117
These boys absolutely went out of their game.

535
00:35:51,618 --> 00:36:00,564
And as their coach, Jason Nascimento, indicated, I think they played over and beyond that for which anybody expected in this day.

536
00:36:00,824 --> 00:36:02,625
It's the second oldest rivalry in the country.

537
00:36:03,247 --> 00:36:06,408
Latin and English is the oldest one, and Malden and Medford is the second one.

538
00:36:07,008 --> 00:36:16,290
And, you know, I think it's a true testament to the fellas and the coaches that they prepared the kids for the game, and they played with a tremendous amount of excitement.

539
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:23,552
But something took place at that game that jogged my mind, and it's a disturbing fact, and I think it goes like this.

540
00:36:24,312 --> 00:36:26,372
When first attending the game, I noticed the field.

541
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,433
The field was not at all cleared.

542
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:30,013
The snow was on the field.

543
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:34,786
And with the snow being on the field, my first thought was, wow, these kids are going to play on this field.

544
00:36:35,546 --> 00:36:38,888
You know, anybody could get hurt at any time, either side, Mauldin or Medford.

545
00:36:39,848 --> 00:36:51,674
And when I was watching the news at the end of the day, recapping all the local games and all the local teams that took place, every one of the games that they did and they showed on TV, the recaps, the snow was all put to the side or to the ends of the end zone.

546
00:36:52,274 --> 00:36:54,815
And these kids were playing on a decent field.

547
00:36:54,835 --> 00:36:58,777
It may not have been the best field, but at least the snow was cleared off of the field.

548
00:36:59,805 --> 00:37:08,454
And then I want to thank a fellow by the name of Michael Nestor, because he brought to my attention something that he found written in the local press and in the Boston press.

549
00:37:08,475 --> 00:37:10,417
It talks about the Malden coach.

550
00:37:10,457 --> 00:37:12,038
The coach's name was Joe Papagallo.

551
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:21,429
And he said, I feel in my heart of hearts, if I had a regular playing field that we could have played on, our regular game, we would have come out on top.

552
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,071
What is he saying?

553
00:37:25,131 --> 00:37:26,332
The game was in Malden.

554
00:37:27,072 --> 00:37:28,473
It's your home turf.

555
00:37:29,314 --> 00:37:36,539
It was your place to make sure that the field was cleared out through the superintendent or your director of operations, whoever it might be.

556
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:46,847
And then to add further insult to injury, our Metfed marching band was not allowed to go on the field because Malden did not have a band.

557
00:37:47,821 --> 00:37:56,945
So the kids that prepared all for the period of time for the Medford-Malden game were not given the privilege to go out in that field and do their halftime show.

558
00:37:58,586 --> 00:37:59,987
What do they have for a halftime show?

559
00:38:01,347 --> 00:38:03,648
Someone throwing Frisbees into the net.

560
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:10,631
That was a complete insult to the people who were there, both Medford and Malden, but whoever put this together.

561
00:38:11,692 --> 00:38:16,154
And I don't know where the principal of our school at Medford High or the principal, Mr. Brown,

562
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:19,402
at the Malden School was on this.

563
00:38:20,183 --> 00:38:21,305
But it's just impossible.

564
00:38:21,626 --> 00:38:22,587
Spoke to many parents.

565
00:38:23,549 --> 00:38:24,791
Spoke to school committee personnel.

566
00:38:25,938 --> 00:38:28,179
They just don't understand how and why this could have happened.

567
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:29,799
We were the guest team.

568
00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:30,960
We weren't the home field.

569
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:44,604
And to insult the guest team by saying, your band, we're asking your band not to go on there because we don't have a band to go on there, and then to put a Frisbee thing out there at midterm, at midfield, I mean at halftime, excuse me.

570
00:38:45,424 --> 00:38:47,465
Just complete, total insult.

571
00:38:48,445 --> 00:38:52,446
But the best part of the whole day is that Medved won 36 to 12.

572
00:38:53,847 --> 00:38:54,787
They not only beat them,

573
00:38:55,537 --> 00:39:12,126
they proved their point, that they don't need a field in good condition because, quote, he indicated that his fellas, the Malden coach says that his fellas on the team couldn't get their traction, their grip on the ground.

574
00:39:12,986 --> 00:39:16,148
Well, what made the difference between Malden and Medford being able to do it?

575
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:23,312
But more important, the bottom line to all of this is a public safety issue of the kids playing on that particular field.

576
00:39:24,286 --> 00:39:31,273
There was no other field that was shown on television on that day on highlights that talked about teams playing on a frozen field.

577
00:39:32,294 --> 00:39:34,857
They had plenty of time to go out there and clear off that field.

578
00:39:35,397 --> 00:39:38,340
And if they had to delay the game to do it, they should have done it.

579
00:39:38,701 --> 00:39:39,361
But they didn't do it.

580
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:45,768
And then to add insult to injury, to have the coach turn around and say, if I had a regular field,

581
00:39:47,573 --> 00:39:50,635
that we could have had a regular game and they would have come out on top.

582
00:39:51,316 --> 00:39:54,919
Then at the end, he throws a kudo, but the Medford kids did a good job and they won.

583
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,221
That's BS in plain English.

584
00:39:58,582 --> 00:40:02,004
Both sides, both kids go there to play a game on that particular day.

585
00:40:02,425 --> 00:40:04,867
Win, lose, or draw, because that's what sports are supposed to be all about.

586
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:11,452
But it didn't turn out to be that way because of one coach's remarks, which were quite inflammatory as far as I'm concerned.

587
00:40:11,711 --> 00:40:20,573
And then to add insult to injury, to have our Medford High School marching band not be allowed to go out there because Malden didn't have one, that's an insult.

588
00:40:20,813 --> 00:40:22,514
That's an insult to the whole program.

589
00:40:22,914 --> 00:40:26,555
And you talk about a program, if you went there, they passed you out a program.

590
00:40:27,115 --> 00:40:28,875
Every program had Medford and Malden in it.

591
00:40:29,116 --> 00:40:30,776
This year, they only had the Malden players.

592
00:40:31,136 --> 00:40:32,957
Medford players were not found on the program.

593
00:40:34,277 --> 00:40:35,977
So I don't know who put this whole thing together.

594
00:40:36,457 --> 00:40:38,318
It's obvious it came on the Malden side.

595
00:40:39,197 --> 00:40:52,802
But their superintendent, their principal of the high school, their coach, and whoever takes care of their grounds should all be held accountable and be told it's a shame that they allowed that game to be played with all the conditions that are surrounding it.

596
00:40:53,722 --> 00:40:57,464
But the highlight of the game was the fact that Medford won, and they won convincingly.

597
00:40:58,884 --> 00:41:03,106
And they should be so proud under the conditions that took place, not only did they won,

598
00:41:04,263 --> 00:41:14,836
I'm so proud of them for taking a picture with their band people after the game to let people know that they appreciated the fact that the band was just as much a part of the Medford-Malden game as anybody else.

599
00:41:15,276 --> 00:41:21,464
Mr. President, I've seen a lot of games, I've been to a lot of games, but this is the first that I've ever seen come out like this.

600
00:41:22,203 --> 00:41:33,349
and the stupidity, and I'll call it that, of going out there and tossing Frisbees into a net for a halftime show is the most insulting thing you can do when you have a band ready, willing, and able to play.

601
00:41:33,369 --> 00:41:34,950
It didn't make any sense.

602
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,531
I think you made your point very clear.

603
00:41:36,751 --> 00:41:37,512
Oh, it is clear.

604
00:41:37,632 --> 00:41:40,934
And the motion is to congratulate the Medford High Mustang team.

605
00:41:40,974 --> 00:41:41,234
It is.

606
00:41:41,714 --> 00:41:44,856
And I also want to, again, I want to thank Mr. Nesta for bringing this

607
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:53,776
to the attention to a lot of people, it highlighted, and then upon reading it and seeing it and reviewing other comments from other people, you know, it's interesting.

608
00:41:54,017 --> 00:42:00,482
You know, I believe it was 1992 or 1994, yeah, because I think the announcement was 20 years on that day.

609
00:42:02,029 --> 00:42:05,872
Medford beat Malden six to nothing, and he was the only one that scored the touchdown on that day for Medford.

610
00:42:06,152 --> 00:42:08,854
Yeah, he still breaks my chucks, because I get the offensive player of the game.

611
00:42:08,874 --> 00:42:09,774
That's beside the point.

612
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:11,315
I'm glad somebody does.

613
00:42:11,555 --> 00:42:12,516
But that's beside the point.

614
00:42:13,016 --> 00:42:14,958
The fact of the matter is simply this.

615
00:42:15,578 --> 00:42:17,039
Medford played an outstanding game.

616
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:21,202
And as their senior quarterback said, it'll be the greatest thrill.

617
00:42:21,362 --> 00:42:22,603
It's been a long time coming.

618
00:42:23,043 --> 00:42:27,146
And it was a great day for the citizens and the city of Medford.

619
00:42:27,546 --> 00:42:30,428
And shame on Malden for doing what they did.

620
00:42:31,003 --> 00:42:33,744
but congratulations with high honors and high praise.

621
00:42:34,024 --> 00:42:49,368
Mr. President, I'd like to have the Method High football team come and appear before the city council so they could duly receive an award for their outstanding victory in that particular day because it was, they just did things that were totally spectacular and the coach as well.

622
00:42:50,348 --> 00:42:50,588
The what?

623
00:42:51,848 --> 00:42:52,068
Nothing.

624
00:42:52,088 --> 00:42:53,069
We'll take a vote on your motion.

625
00:42:54,329 --> 00:42:54,889
On the motion.

626
00:42:54,929 --> 00:42:55,609
All those in favor?

627
00:42:56,009 --> 00:42:56,109
Aye.

628
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:57,330
All those opposed?

629
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,350
The ayes have it.

630
00:42:59,737 --> 00:43:01,598
Reckage, we're passed to Councilor Penta.

631
00:43:01,758 --> 00:43:13,104
Mr. President, there are a couple of, I don't want to hold up all the records, but there's a couple of typos in there and I think, I think that's, yeah, yeah, just, I can either that or correct it, yeah.

632
00:43:13,545 --> 00:43:14,125
Hang on one second.

633
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:30,434
uh, records at, uh, the motion of council Penta to table and he will bring a revisions to the clerk and there will be, there's just, there's just two minor revisions, two minor revisions and the records.

634
00:43:30,454 --> 00:43:31,875
We back before the council next week.

635
00:43:32,035 --> 00:43:36,417
All those in favor, all those opposed, the ayes have it on the motion of adjournment.

636
00:43:36,457 --> 00:43:46,242
Mr. President, we got a copy tonight here of a, um, of a notice of a public meeting that's going to take place next Wednesday evening.

637
00:43:46,302 --> 00:43:47,142
I believe it's six 30.

638
00:43:47,242 --> 00:43:47,342
Um,

639
00:43:51,856 --> 00:43:54,217
Well, anyway, checking into it further, oh, thank you.

640
00:43:54,497 --> 00:44:01,662
Checking into this thing further, it talks about the reason why MassDOT, the reason, and it's not explained, I have no idea why it's not explained.

641
00:44:02,042 --> 00:44:06,484
The reason why MassDOT is having this is because of a federal, there is a federal inclusion.

642
00:44:06,924 --> 00:44:17,030
Because of the money I believe that the city is applying for under the, with the waterway taxi that the mayor has under consideration, I believe 200 and somewhat thousand of that 475,

643
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,681
is particularly earmarked for this particular location.

644
00:44:21,721 --> 00:44:28,525
And because of that earmark, the MassDOT, or the State Department of Transportation, has to call the hearing.

645
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:36,189
But in essence, it's really as it relates to explaining the whole idea as it relates to the federal money being used for this particular project.

646
00:44:36,729 --> 00:44:39,811
The right of way, it's just language, from what I understand.

647
00:44:40,191 --> 00:44:45,234
It's just language that's thrown in there if, in fact, temporary or permanent easements are needed.

648
00:44:45,814 --> 00:44:47,415
I believe that the easements that are needed

649
00:44:48,015 --> 00:44:48,915
One of them already exists.

650
00:44:48,955 --> 00:44:50,255
And I think it's just a reaffirming it.

651
00:44:50,656 --> 00:44:57,677
And that's the walkway that's between the senior center and the, and the, um, and the one 21 Riverside Avenue.

652
00:44:57,697 --> 00:45:00,778
And then there's another one that allows for a, for an easement coming in.

653
00:45:01,238 --> 00:45:05,999
Um, so with that being said, Mr. President, I would like to, um, and I think it should have been clear.

654
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:10,340
I, is this Mr. Clark, a notification of a public hearing?

655
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,740
Is this the document that went out?

656
00:45:14,937 --> 00:45:17,958
notice of a public hearing that they sent out for, for who is it for?

657
00:45:18,278 --> 00:45:20,819
It's just it's a DOT department of transportation.

658
00:45:20,839 --> 00:45:25,561
It's being held here in the council chamber for the, for the peace hosted by Frank DiPaolo.

659
00:45:25,802 --> 00:45:27,482
We got that from a ministry.

660
00:45:27,542 --> 00:45:37,686
Could we have, um, could we have, um, either from the chief engineer or the administrator and upgrading, um, an upgraded letter as to, because it's confusing.

661
00:45:37,726 --> 00:45:38,827
It isn't really DOT.

662
00:45:38,887 --> 00:45:42,268
It's the feds that are going through the state department of transportation.

663
00:45:42,308 --> 00:45:43,869
That's the reason why this hearing is being called.

664
00:45:44,371 --> 00:45:47,873
So could we have an explanation either from Lauren's office, DeLorenzo, or?

665
00:45:47,893 --> 00:45:50,495
Lauren sent us the document in the mail, so.

666
00:45:51,235 --> 00:45:51,836
Who do you want to ask?

667
00:45:52,436 --> 00:45:52,616
Both.

668
00:45:52,736 --> 00:45:54,597
All right, to OCD and the engineer.

669
00:45:54,797 --> 00:45:54,957
Right.

670
00:45:55,438 --> 00:45:56,618
On the December 10th.

671
00:45:56,798 --> 00:45:57,539
I got it.

672
00:45:57,579 --> 00:45:58,920
Meeting at 6.30 PM.

673
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:00,140
Here in the council chamber.

674
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,041
Here in the council chamber.

675
00:46:01,401 --> 00:46:03,522
On the motion of Councilor Penta, all those in favor?

676
00:46:04,743 --> 00:46:05,424
All those opposed?

677
00:46:05,444 --> 00:46:06,024
The ayes have it.

678
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:07,945
Councilor Monks.

679
00:46:08,305 --> 00:46:12,668
Before we adjourn, several weeks back this council took a vote

680
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:16,233
on sending a couple of issues to the Traffic Commission.

681
00:46:17,093 --> 00:46:28,724
One was the closing off of the corner of Main and Yale Street, and the other one was to add bollards to the Harvard and Main Street corner.

682
00:46:29,444 --> 00:46:37,071
And I was wondering if we can get an update if the Traffic Commission received it, and when will that appear on the Traffic Commission agenda.

683
00:46:37,751 --> 00:46:39,333
Also, the second point, Mr. President,

684
00:46:39,887 --> 00:46:48,450
I believe we voted for a Committee of the Whole meeting to discuss moving the bus stop on Main Street, you know, 20 or 30 feet down.

685
00:46:48,851 --> 00:46:53,412
And if you can set that up, maybe sometime after the holidays or... We're trying and we get two upcoming meetings.

686
00:46:53,493 --> 00:47:06,638
The Office of Community Development requested a meeting, not next week, the week after, and next week we have the tax rate, but I think it's a very important issue and either myself or Vice President-elect De La Russo will be scheduling something.

687
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:13,453
The OCD meeting is something to do with the grant and forthcoming.

688
00:47:14,113 --> 00:47:19,994
We'll be on the agenda next week or the week after the 12th.

689
00:47:20,134 --> 00:47:33,497
I believe, Mr. President, this is something new that OCD meeting is going to be setting an agenda as it relates to community development, as it relates to certain portions of the community development block grant hearing.

690
00:47:34,057 --> 00:47:35,137
So no, no.

691
00:47:35,357 --> 00:47:35,577
Yes.

692
00:47:35,697 --> 00:47:38,438
For my information, the one the one that Lauren called myself on

693
00:47:38,943 --> 00:47:40,324
was something to do with the park grant.

694
00:47:42,004 --> 00:47:43,345
So it might be another different meeting.

695
00:47:43,365 --> 00:47:45,846
Well, there's another one then that's scheduled as it relates to that.

696
00:47:46,227 --> 00:47:50,669
I think it's a preliminary meeting as it relates to setting an agenda that's going to handle the fiscal.

697
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:51,429
Possibly?

698
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:53,190
Yeah.

699
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:58,653
At this point, the only request that has officially come from the OCD to have a meeting is regarding a park grant.

700
00:47:59,433 --> 00:48:02,795
And the city clerk was checking the schedule, and it will appear on our agenda.

701
00:48:03,315 --> 00:48:04,215
Mr. President.

702
00:48:07,988 --> 00:48:09,529
Is this park grant the one where.

703
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:11,271
I'm not sure.

704
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:12,052
All I know is.

705
00:48:12,452 --> 00:48:12,772
Oh, wait a minute.

706
00:48:12,812 --> 00:48:30,587
If it's, if there was a park grant notice that went out a little while ago, is this, is this the park grant where the mayor, um, Lauren de Lorenzo, and I forget who the third person was, took a picture saying that the city is going forward and voted for this money for a park grant.

707
00:48:31,307 --> 00:48:36,351
And this never came before the city council and the law and the law requires the city council to take a vote.

708
00:48:36,391 --> 00:48:37,152
And how can the mayor,

709
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,240
Go forward.

710
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:45,183
The pot grant was before this honorable body earlier this year and she's looking for another meeting.

711
00:48:45,563 --> 00:48:52,947
Other than that, counselor, no, we've, we voted for the pot grant earlier in the year for Webster street park.

712
00:48:53,007 --> 00:48:53,927
I believe it was one of them.

713
00:48:54,987 --> 00:48:58,589
Um, as Logan Park, exactly.

714
00:48:58,609 --> 00:49:01,190
There was several, we have voted on this previously.

715
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:04,211
Some of those monies, I'm going to beg you to differ with you.

716
00:49:04,271 --> 00:49:05,672
Some of those monies were used.

717
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:09,021
Not to be confused, this is the P-A-R-C-C grant.

718
00:49:09,121 --> 00:49:09,321
Right.

719
00:49:09,421 --> 00:49:10,722
Not a park P-A-R-K.

720
00:49:12,223 --> 00:49:12,463
Okay.

721
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,884
Then we're talking about two separate issues if that's the case.

722
00:49:14,924 --> 00:49:28,390
And the issue that I'm talking about is the one where the mayor took a picture and after speaking with the lady in Boston who was in charge of the program, the only reason that the city is not getting its portion of the money, they do not have yet a recorded roll call vote from the city.

723
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:30,130
That could be it, council.

724
00:49:30,711 --> 00:49:33,512
I hope you pick up the phone tomorrow and call Lauren because I plan on doing it as well.

725
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:45,377
All those in favour of Councillor Marks's main motion for the Traffic Commission to give us an update on when the bollards are going to appear on the Traffic Commission meeting.

726
00:49:45,577 --> 00:49:46,298
All those in favour?

727
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:49,341
Both.

728
00:49:50,262 --> 00:49:52,184
The traffic calming approach is on several different streets.

729
00:49:53,044 --> 00:49:53,865
Councillor Lungo-Kerr.

730
00:49:54,526 --> 00:49:54,826
Thank you.

731
00:49:56,315 --> 00:50:00,056
Ed O'Neill, you said his next week tax, set in the tax rate.

732
00:50:00,776 --> 00:50:06,818
If he could give us, I know we always ask him the week he comes to give us a couple of different breakdowns.

733
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:11,239
If we could ask him prior to the meeting, ask him tonight, send a motion.

734
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:13,760
Can we take a vote on Councilor Moxley?

735
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:14,460
Yes, yes.

736
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,780
On the motion of Councilor Moxley, all those in favor?

737
00:50:17,421 --> 00:50:17,981
All those opposed?

738
00:50:18,021 --> 00:50:18,581
The ayes have it.

739
00:50:19,201 --> 00:50:20,541
Councilor Lungo-Kern has the floor.

740
00:50:20,781 --> 00:50:21,022
Thank you.

741
00:50:21,042 --> 00:50:21,522
If we can ask,

742
00:50:23,288 --> 00:50:28,192
I'm going to ask Chief Assessor Ed O'Neill to break down the tax rate two or three different ways.

743
00:50:28,472 --> 00:50:48,449
One, obviously the mayor wants to probably tax to the maximum, the 2.5%, if he could break it down, how we'd set the tax rate if we were going to give our taxpayers some relief at the 2%, possibly the 1.5%, just to make sure he brings the numbers for a few different options for the council.

744
00:50:50,795 --> 00:50:55,437
Do you want to ask for that or do you give us the numbers because he's not going to be clear on it?

745
00:50:55,497 --> 00:51:00,318
I think he's going to know what I'm talking about.

746
00:51:00,498 --> 00:51:01,759
No, that's why I'm asking you.

747
00:51:01,819 --> 00:51:03,520
Previous fiscal year tax rate sentence?

748
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,380
We've got to vote on something.

749
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,921
They're going to come back and say it's ambiguous.

750
00:51:08,181 --> 00:51:10,342
We've got the meeting next week.

751
00:51:10,742 --> 00:51:12,023
I'd rather put the percentages on it.

752
00:51:13,343 --> 00:51:13,583
Yes.

753
00:51:13,883 --> 00:51:17,284
You all set, Councillor?

754
00:51:19,094 --> 00:51:22,736
referring to residential exemptions, whether it's 15, 20, 25, 30%, whatever it might be.

755
00:51:22,756 --> 00:51:24,417
He brought us the breakdown of each one.

756
00:51:24,437 --> 00:51:29,680
And he also brought down the number of homes that would be affected and what the dollar range was.

757
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,481
So if he could do that, that would be great.

758
00:51:31,581 --> 00:51:38,745
So why don't we go back, ask him for the same data that we asked at last year's tax hearing, we wanted ahead of time this year for this meeting.

759
00:51:39,225 --> 00:51:41,887
Yeah, I'm trying to recall.

760
00:51:41,947 --> 00:51:43,307
Because it was several different options.

761
00:51:43,327 --> 00:51:47,370
Because it was the residential tax rate, it was also the tax levy,

762
00:51:49,475 --> 00:51:53,477
It was the one too that affected like Cape Cod towns and not up here.

763
00:51:54,158 --> 00:51:55,438
There were several different issues going on.

764
00:51:55,458 --> 00:51:57,699
So why don't we ask for all the documents we asked for last year.

765
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,461
I know, I think this is, I have an idea where she's going.

766
00:52:00,481 --> 00:52:06,844
If it's 10, 15, 20, 25, 30%, and then how does that reflect upon 2.5, 2% or whatever it might be?

767
00:52:07,684 --> 00:52:09,765
How many homes over a certain value?

768
00:52:09,805 --> 00:52:10,406
No, no, no.

769
00:52:10,426 --> 00:52:13,047
How does that affect not hitting the max of 2.5?

770
00:52:13,567 --> 00:52:18,590
And I'd like to add to that the breakdown of the break even point that last year,

771
00:52:19,172 --> 00:52:22,513
houses based at a certain value would have went up significantly.

772
00:52:23,533 --> 00:52:26,173
And, I mean, that's the data we asked for last year.

773
00:52:26,773 --> 00:52:28,294
So I think we're all on the same page.

774
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:34,275
As far as the real estate values go, that's an unfair comment to make, Mr. President.

775
00:52:34,295 --> 00:52:35,655
No, there's a break-even point.

776
00:52:35,895 --> 00:52:36,875
No, no, I understand that.

777
00:52:37,575 --> 00:52:40,456
But real estate values have jumped dramatically in this city.

778
00:52:40,476 --> 00:52:41,616
But there's a break-even point.

779
00:52:41,636 --> 00:52:42,116
It's a dollar amount.

780
00:52:42,396 --> 00:52:43,217
That's what I'm referring to.

781
00:52:43,237 --> 00:52:45,397
No, but folks in this community,

782
00:52:46,282 --> 00:52:53,166
It's either the fifth or the sixth hottest market in real estate for people living in the city or selling real estate.

783
00:52:53,186 --> 00:52:54,807
I don't know about living here, but selling it.

784
00:52:55,447 --> 00:53:04,612
And with that being said, I think the breakdown that the Councilor Lungelkern is alluding to, it makes a lot of sense because I think we're threading pretty close to now getting to an exemption.

785
00:53:04,632 --> 00:53:09,275
Somerville just had theirs up to 35% for residential tax exemptions.

786
00:53:09,608 --> 00:53:17,814
They have it all broken down, and as it relates to business, new business, two, a single, double, and a triple family home, and they're doing pretty well.

787
00:53:17,834 --> 00:53:20,356
And look at the development that they have over there.

788
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:23,118
Another thing, Mr. President, I'd like to add an amendment to that.

789
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:24,919
How much?

790
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:30,724
Mr. President, I'd like to add an amendment, an addendum to Councilor Lengelkern's thing.

791
00:53:31,544 --> 00:53:37,909
I'd like to know the new revenue that was brought in taxes last year as compared to the new revenue brought into taxes this year.

792
00:53:39,534 --> 00:53:39,974
New growth?

793
00:53:40,835 --> 00:53:41,255
New revenue.

794
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:42,035
New tax revenue.

795
00:53:42,075 --> 00:53:42,655
New tax revenue?

796
00:53:42,675 --> 00:53:42,755
Yep.

797
00:53:42,815 --> 00:53:48,098
Because that speaks volumes as to ongoing.

798
00:53:48,718 --> 00:53:58,722
If we, for example, took in a million dollars last year and this year it's projected to go out another $2 million or a million dollars again, that's $2 million extra in each year in the coffers.

799
00:53:59,542 --> 00:54:01,903
And once again, the ratepayers aren't seeing that.

800
00:54:04,564 --> 00:54:06,045
Councillor Longo-Kurt and then Councillor Knight.

801
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:07,986
If I may finish, yeah, thank you.

802
00:54:08,418 --> 00:54:20,181
If we could get as much documentation in our packet for Friday so that we can have it before the weekend, rather than just being brought it Tuesday night at 5.30, 6 p.m., and asked to vote on it at 7, that would be helpful.

803
00:54:21,461 --> 00:54:23,821
On that motion, Councillor Knight.

804
00:54:24,402 --> 00:54:26,582
I think it would also be helpful, Mr. President.

805
00:54:26,982 --> 00:54:34,704
I remember, I think back in January, the city began doing a real property inspection and valuation program.

806
00:54:35,409 --> 00:54:38,511
And it said it was going to take about 24 months to complete the program.

807
00:54:38,551 --> 00:54:47,256
I'd like to know where we are in terms of the reevaluation of the properties that have been inspected, how many houses have been done, how many houses need to be done before we move forward on the tax rate.

808
00:54:52,298 --> 00:54:54,800
All those in favor?

809
00:54:57,834 --> 00:54:58,415
All those opposed?

810
00:54:58,435 --> 00:54:58,996
The ayes have it.

811
00:54:59,658 --> 00:55:03,104
The records have been tabled on the motion of Vice President Carviello for adjournment.

812
00:55:03,385 --> 00:55:04,066
All those in favor?

813
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:04,487
Aye.

814
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:05,489
All those opposed?

815
00:55:05,509 --> 00:55:06,070
The ayes have it.
