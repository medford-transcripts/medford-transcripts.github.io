00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:21,266
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me begin by saying before we call them up, we're pleased to report that the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, NEASC,

74
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:33,301
[SPEAKER_18]: acting on behalf of the Commission on Secondary Schools, has awarded Medford High School, Medford Vocational Technical High School, full reaccreditation for a 10-year period.

75
00:02:34,022 --> 00:02:38,164
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the best possible rating under the NESC system.

76
00:02:38,184 --> 00:02:47,069
[SPEAKER_18]: A round of applause for that.

77
00:02:47,089 --> 00:02:48,350
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of credit to a lot of people.

78
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:52,469
[SPEAKER_18]: The high school accreditation process, as you know, is a major undertaking.

79
00:02:53,210 --> 00:03:08,180
[SPEAKER_18]: Congratulations and credit for the preparation of our self-study and evidentiary submission, as well as the confidence on the on-site visit belongs to the leadership of both the high school and the vocational school, and Heidi's here also, the steering committee, faculty, staff, and students.

80
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:15,785
[SPEAKER_18]: There are many significant findings, but I'm gonna cite a few of them here before we call up our leadership.

81
00:03:17,286 --> 00:03:27,232
[SPEAKER_18]: The school board, that's you, superintendent and principal are collaborative, reflective, and constructive in achieving the school's 21st century learning expectations.

82
00:03:27,812 --> 00:03:33,935
[SPEAKER_18]: In talking to the various people who come in, they don't always find that to be true, that people talk to each other.

83
00:03:33,995 --> 00:03:34,756
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm surprised.

84
00:03:35,896 --> 00:03:42,220
[SPEAKER_18]: The school is a safe and respectful environment that responds to the diversity of the school community.

85
00:03:43,341 --> 00:03:47,184
[SPEAKER_18]: The school has made significant capital improvements and technology investments.

86
00:03:48,164 --> 00:03:53,628
[SPEAKER_18]: There is a strong collaboration between the principal of Medford High School and the director of the vocational school.

87
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:58,892
[SPEAKER_18]: Teachers who personalize instruction help meet the needs of a majority of students.

88
00:03:59,953 --> 00:04:04,536
[SPEAKER_18]: The use of formative and summative assessments in the classroom for the purpose of informing instruction.

89
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:09,079
[SPEAKER_18]: The teacher's practice of giving timely feedback to students.

90
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,762
[SPEAKER_18]: The students who feel supported and cared for by their teachers.

91
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:14,853
[SPEAKER_18]: All powerful statements.

92
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:24,215
[SPEAKER_18]: The personalized care and attention that is given to the various wellness needs of the school community, the topic that we addressed the other evening.

93
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:31,876
[SPEAKER_18]: The active and effective site council and parent-teacher organization, and the cultivation of many productive partnerships.

94
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:38,877
[SPEAKER_18]: These above commendations that I'm reading are only a sampling of the findings by the visiting committee and the commission.

95
00:04:39,817 --> 00:04:42,878
[SPEAKER_18]: Naturally, there are recommendations for improvement as well.

96
00:04:43,638 --> 00:04:49,823
[SPEAKER_18]: However, when taken in context, the overall picture of our high school and vocational school is excellent.

97
00:04:51,305 --> 00:04:52,846
[SPEAKER_18]: The report is in front of you.

98
00:04:53,867 --> 00:05:00,453
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to give you time to read it and digest it, and then we will schedule a committee in the hall to go over any aspect of it in detail.

99
00:05:01,216 --> 00:05:03,318
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think, you know, we take a little time to reflect on it.

100
00:05:04,218 --> 00:05:09,482
[SPEAKER_18]: That will give us a better opportunity to pick those areas that we want to concentrate on, especially as we go into budget.

101
00:05:09,922 --> 00:05:26,074
[SPEAKER_18]: So, Mr. Chairman, without further ado, I'd like to bring up the leadership of the high school, Dr. John Corrella, Assistant Principal Nick Tucci, Director of the Vocational School, Heidi Riccio, and Steering Committee Co-Chair, Andy Margulies,

102
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:34,192
[SPEAKER_18]: accept your congratulations and at the same time answer any questions you may have and to make whatever statements they want to make.

103
00:05:34,212 --> 00:05:34,712
[SPEAKER_18]: Mrs. Vanderkloof.

104
00:05:36,132 --> 00:05:37,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, first congratulations.

105
00:05:38,253 --> 00:05:43,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it was, and is always a lot of work, but we are so appreciative, um, for that work.

106
00:05:44,334 --> 00:05:51,336
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that as I read through this report, um, that the things that really struck me was when we got to that part about school culture.

107
00:05:51,796 --> 00:05:54,317
[SPEAKER_07]: And that just made me feel so proud.

108
00:05:54,677 --> 00:06:03,062
[SPEAKER_07]: That what, you know, when we say, you know, we have the best students and that we appreciate all of them and we celebrate their diversity and that they feel cared for.

109
00:06:03,482 --> 00:06:11,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Those were just golden nuggets to hear that somebody else walking in who's never been to our school before so quickly picked it up.

110
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:17,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's certainly what we as school committee members and I for all these years, that's what we want.

111
00:06:18,251 --> 00:06:19,691
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are so appreciative.

112
00:06:20,152 --> 00:06:22,113
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's great that notice,

113
00:06:22,653 --> 00:06:26,175
[SPEAKER_07]: The collaboration now between the two schools have so much added to that.

114
00:06:27,396 --> 00:06:38,302
[SPEAKER_07]: We want each of our students to be recognized for their individuality, celebrated for their diversity, felt that they are cared for and that there are people who care for them every day.

115
00:06:38,642 --> 00:06:47,026
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's, as I was looking through this, and I know there's many recommendations and other things that we could talk about or whatever, but that's what came through so strongly and I really appreciate that.

116
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:48,607
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

117
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:49,668
[SPEAKER_16]: If I could say a few words.

118
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:53,449
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, the four of us are standing up here tonight receiving this.

119
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:54,390
[SPEAKER_16]: Congratulations.

120
00:06:54,470 --> 00:07:00,912
[SPEAKER_16]: But really, this is a full package of celebration for everyone in the community.

121
00:07:01,312 --> 00:07:05,914
[SPEAKER_16]: From the superintendent, to the school committee, to all the teachers, and to the students themselves.

122
00:07:06,655 --> 00:07:14,538
[SPEAKER_16]: So we are very proud of the collaboration that we all have and of the successes that the students have brought to shine in this report.

123
00:07:14,998 --> 00:07:21,947
[SPEAKER_16]: So, again, we're very happy and proud to be up here, but obviously this is something that should be spread to everyone in the school community.

124
00:07:22,128 --> 00:07:22,828
[SPEAKER_16]: But thank you very much.

125
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:23,189
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

126
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,953
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. Cunha.

127
00:07:26,593 --> 00:07:29,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, everything that my colleague has said.

128
00:07:29,077 --> 00:07:31,460
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to congratulate everyone I do know.

129
00:07:31,947 --> 00:07:38,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Perrella, as you mentioned, there's a lot of people behind you, and it could only be as successful as the hard work that everybody put in.

130
00:07:39,074 --> 00:07:41,737
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do know that there were a lot of people involved in this.

131
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:48,203
[SPEAKER_11]: And as a parent, we're always trying to push and bring the level of the bar always higher.

132
00:07:48,824 --> 00:07:54,810
[SPEAKER_11]: But one thing as a parent I really feel good about is knowing that my children will go to a school.

133
00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:02,479
[SPEAKER_11]: and really have that atmosphere of, you know, they could go speak to someone and it's a great atmosphere to be in.

134
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,045
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I thank all of you for all your work and for everyone else who was involved.

135
00:08:07,065 --> 00:08:07,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

136
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:09,823
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. D. Benedetto.

137
00:08:10,984 --> 00:08:11,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

138
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for coming.

139
00:08:13,144 --> 00:08:21,486
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know that I hold you accountable when things don't go well, and I also want to hold you accountable for when things are going well.

140
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:25,047
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a very big achievement for our school system.

141
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:35,870
[SPEAKER_06]: I read through what the recommendations are, and there are a few building things which will get budgeted for and fixed now because they were in black and white from the department.

142
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:43,641
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a couple collaboration things that we still need to work on throughout the thing, but we're doing wonderful work.

143
00:08:44,242 --> 00:08:45,362
[SPEAKER_06]: You're doing wonderful work.

144
00:08:45,782 --> 00:08:47,543
[SPEAKER_06]: This is years of work.

145
00:08:47,983 --> 00:08:57,367
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a moment in time of how the school is on the day that they came, but it's a year in prepping and a year after.

146
00:08:57,747 --> 00:08:59,007
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're at the midpoint now.

147
00:08:59,528 --> 00:09:01,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Take a breath, enjoy your victory.

148
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:03,169
[SPEAKER_06]: You did a great job.

149
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:06,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm proud of all of you, and I'm proud to be part of this community.

150
00:09:07,117 --> 00:09:07,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for all the work.

151
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:09,911
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Scarpelli.

152
00:09:10,311 --> 00:09:12,633
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, I echo my colleagues.

153
00:09:14,214 --> 00:09:15,615
[SPEAKER_19]: Pat's on the back so y'all deserve it.

154
00:09:15,635 --> 00:09:26,644
[SPEAKER_19]: The one thing that we need is as you walk the streets and you talk to people and it's coming down to picking their high schools and parents are talking to us, geez, you know what?

155
00:09:26,664 --> 00:09:28,645
[SPEAKER_19]: I wish the high school was, was newer.

156
00:09:29,146 --> 00:09:34,530
[SPEAKER_19]: I wish it was, um, you know, I wish, I wish we had a different color for the front or something silly.

157
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,672
[SPEAKER_19]: When I tell them that, that it's not the,

158
00:09:37,754 --> 00:09:39,256
[SPEAKER_19]: the exterior, that's the heartbeat.

159
00:09:39,556 --> 00:09:46,302
[SPEAKER_19]: And what you do every day just reinforces what we're trying to do by showing everybody that this is a great place to learn.

160
00:09:46,882 --> 00:09:50,786
[SPEAKER_19]: And, um, again, I commend you and that's, that's, that's impressive.

161
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:51,606
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you very much.

162
00:09:51,907 --> 00:09:52,767
[SPEAKER_19]: You make us look great.

163
00:09:52,787 --> 00:10:02,976
[SPEAKER_14]: So Mr. Scarecrow, I've read a few, a few of these reports during my brief tenure here in the board, but it's my goal is again, thank you for your help.

164
00:10:03,096 --> 00:10:05,038
[SPEAKER_14]: And Nick, John, Heidi,

165
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,635
[SPEAKER_14]: It was great to see that the teachers came forth.

166
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:11,657
[SPEAKER_14]: As in years past, trying to get any information on them was like pulling nails.

167
00:10:12,337 --> 00:10:18,579
[SPEAKER_14]: But with the leadership that we have in place, I hope you will go back to your faculty and let them know that, hey, they did really a super job.

168
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:22,641
[SPEAKER_14]: It just reflects on what we have in Medford and our leadership team.

169
00:10:22,901 --> 00:10:30,044
[SPEAKER_14]: And I, as one person and a taxpayer, thank you very much and just wish that we can keep up the good work and carry on.

170
00:10:32,603 --> 00:10:36,827
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm wondering, this has not yet been announced to the students, correct?

171
00:10:37,707 --> 00:10:38,268
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it has not.

172
00:10:38,628 --> 00:10:48,496
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm wondering, and maybe there's a few dollars that could go towards this, whether we could do something fun to celebrate it at the high school with all the teachers and administrators and the kids.

173
00:10:49,157 --> 00:10:55,382
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have anything off the top of my head, but it seems like this would be worthy to

174
00:10:56,845 --> 00:11:15,579
[SPEAKER_07]: I would request that the superintendent be find some perhaps there's a few extra dollars here or there that might go for having some sort of recognition at the high school that everybody can share in.

175
00:11:17,624 --> 00:11:33,744
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just going to say, I mean, the day, I know it already happened, but I don't know if there's another day that's coming up, but usually the kids will have like a spirit day or a fun day or something like that.

176
00:11:34,725 --> 00:11:39,792
[SPEAKER_11]: While all the students are in that atmosphere, maybe we could have something a little bit special for them.

177
00:11:40,773 --> 00:11:41,634
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to throw it out there.

178
00:11:41,954 --> 00:11:45,779
[SPEAKER_11]: But I also want to say, I just want to piggyback on what George mentioned.

179
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,385
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have to say that this year it's been really a lot of fun already.

180
00:11:50,906 --> 00:11:52,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Going out and listening to parents.

181
00:11:53,128 --> 00:11:57,350
[SPEAKER_11]: that usually I'll have parents say to me, what are you going to do with that vocational school?

182
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:03,212
[SPEAKER_11]: You know all these students are going here, and we're going to lose them here, and why don't you try this program?

183
00:12:03,632 --> 00:12:06,153
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can honestly tell you, I was out a lot this weekend.

184
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:14,376
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was really nice to hear parents say, you know, my son's going to the Volk, or my daughter's going to the Volk, and they're freshmen this year.

185
00:12:14,796 --> 00:12:22,039
[SPEAKER_11]: And I had no idea how wonderful it is and how things are moving, because you have all these rumors out there of,

186
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:30,082
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we're trying to destroy the vocational, or we're trying to get rid of the vocational, and they're finally, everyone is finally understanding.

187
00:12:30,122 --> 00:12:36,464
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not trying to get rid of anything, but really to make it better, and to give the students the best opportunity possible.

188
00:12:36,644 --> 00:12:45,987
[SPEAKER_11]: So, when I throw in now that, you know, our vocational students are taking languages, rather than taking night courses at night, because a lot of them go off to colleges, people are like,

189
00:12:46,607 --> 00:12:48,028
[SPEAKER_11]: standing back now saying, really?

190
00:12:48,048 --> 00:12:49,268
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't know that.

191
00:12:49,388 --> 00:13:02,512
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, this is all the hard work that, as my colleague Erin had said, it's years of building, but it's finally coming together, and I couldn't be prouder, so thank you.

192
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:04,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Falco.

193
00:13:05,194 --> 00:13:11,979
[SPEAKER_07]: I was also just wanted to mention that we're supposed to have a meeting of the public relations subcommittee.

194
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:15,522
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that because this is a piece of it, this is a piece of that.

195
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:21,286
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to make sure that the whole community understands some of the things that have been said in here.

196
00:13:22,307 --> 00:13:25,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we have a tentative date of May 14th.

197
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that true?

198
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,611
[SPEAKER_18]: May 14th?

199
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:27,231
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

200
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:33,878
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, so what's, you know, we've got a lot going on, but I've got some suggested dates as we move into the evening tonight.

201
00:13:34,118 --> 00:13:34,398
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

202
00:13:34,418 --> 00:13:37,483
[SPEAKER_18]: Go over a whole list of dates and you can pick.

203
00:13:37,503 --> 00:13:39,126
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to make sure we get better.

204
00:13:39,146 --> 00:13:39,326
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

205
00:13:39,466 --> 00:13:39,827
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

206
00:13:39,867 --> 00:13:41,009
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll get better.

207
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:44,153
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a couple of dates a month in May that are open that hopefully everyone can.

208
00:13:46,234 --> 00:13:47,635
[SPEAKER_16]: I could add a few things to it.

209
00:13:48,135 --> 00:13:50,396
[SPEAKER_16]: I love the idea of celebrating with the students.

210
00:13:50,476 --> 00:13:53,758
[SPEAKER_16]: Primarily because the students are really what make this report.

211
00:13:53,838 --> 00:14:00,541
[SPEAKER_16]: And when you get a chance to really dig deep into it, what you'll find is that the students really make us what we are.

212
00:14:01,242 --> 00:14:03,163
[SPEAKER_16]: It's kind of a cliche in many ways.

213
00:14:04,123 --> 00:14:13,228
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, when you get deep into that report, you'll find that they were raving about how the students perceived what we did, how they reacted to the teachers, and how they interacted with each other.

214
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:19,152
[SPEAKER_16]: So the cultural pieces to that, that's because we have some of the greatest students, probably, I think we have the greatest students in the state.

215
00:14:19,232 --> 00:14:22,133
[SPEAKER_16]: And I also agree that we have the greatest teachers in the state.

216
00:14:22,513 --> 00:14:26,876
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think this school committee really embraced us and made this all possible.

217
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,817
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, it's a full collaboration.

218
00:14:30,072 --> 00:14:30,412
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

219
00:14:30,852 --> 00:14:33,873
[SPEAKER_18]: In fact, as a reward for all of you, you're invited to the junior prom.

220
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:36,213
[SPEAKER_18]: All you have to do is get a date.

221
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,674
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll let you get it at 12 to six.

222
00:14:39,874 --> 00:14:44,795
[SPEAKER_15]: If I may add really quick, congratulations to all of you and to the whole team that was involved.

223
00:14:45,315 --> 00:14:46,516
[SPEAKER_15]: Great job, fabulous.

224
00:14:46,536 --> 00:14:50,857
[SPEAKER_15]: There are a lot of great things happening in the Memphis Public Schools, and this is one of them.

225
00:14:50,897 --> 00:14:52,817
[SPEAKER_15]: So great job, fabulous.

226
00:14:53,097 --> 00:14:57,118
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree with what all my colleagues said, so just fabulous job.

227
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,455
[SPEAKER_19]: Heidi's getting tired of all this.

228
00:15:08,535 --> 00:15:17,179
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, on the motion of Mrs. DiBenedetto that the report be accepted and placed on file.

229
00:15:17,219 --> 00:15:17,899
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

230
00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:18,499
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

231
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:20,600
[SPEAKER_15]: The report is accepted and placed on file.

232
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:27,551
[SPEAKER_15]: Next item is the recommendation to accept gift to Medford High School from Silvio Sella Foundation.

233
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:28,652
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Superintendent.

234
00:15:28,672 --> 00:15:33,355
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Chairman, our football coach is here, Jason Nascimento.

235
00:15:33,895 --> 00:15:36,056
[SPEAKER_18]: Up here, Jason, come on up and let everybody see you.

236
00:15:37,017 --> 00:15:39,239
[SPEAKER_18]: Promising an undefeated season next year, by the way.

237
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:44,842
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the chairperson of the football associates, okay?

238
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,904
[SPEAKER_18]: So the other day,

239
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:55,403
[SPEAKER_18]: received a check from the Sylvia Occella Foundation in the amount of $3,000 to enhance our football program.

240
00:15:56,303 --> 00:16:04,366
[SPEAKER_18]: Sylvia Occella was an outstanding educator and athletic director and coach at Revere for many, many years.

241
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:09,508
[SPEAKER_18]: And his family has put together this foundation in his honor and memory.

242
00:16:10,128 --> 00:16:12,169
[SPEAKER_18]: And Medford was the recipient this year.

243
00:16:12,189 --> 00:16:13,229
[SPEAKER_18]: He was a 49-year veteran.

244
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,851
[SPEAKER_18]: as a football coach, athletic director of Revere High School.

245
00:16:19,951 --> 00:16:30,915
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I'm going to let Jason and Chris talk a little bit about what they're going to do with the money, and then we can take a vote to receive it, and we'll send a thank you note to the Chavo Foundation.

246
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,846
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, first off, I'd like to thank everyone for having us here.

247
00:16:34,946 --> 00:16:37,627
[SPEAKER_12]: This is an amazing opportunity for us.

248
00:16:38,547 --> 00:16:41,308
[SPEAKER_12]: I originally didn't even know this specific opportunity existed.

249
00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:46,290
[SPEAKER_12]: And when an email came across my desk and Mr. Maloney's desk, I was thrilled.

250
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:49,311
[SPEAKER_12]: We went down to Gillette to accept the award.

251
00:16:51,476 --> 00:16:56,958
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's fantastic for this opportunity to give back to the kids that work so hard.

252
00:16:57,838 --> 00:17:03,961
[SPEAKER_12]: Even now, in the off season weight training and attending camps and clinics and stuff, they really do a fantastic job.

253
00:17:04,321 --> 00:17:09,963
[SPEAKER_12]: And even in times when the season doesn't go the way that you'd love it to go, and it pains me and the other coaches to see it that way.

254
00:17:10,023 --> 00:17:15,985
[SPEAKER_12]: But just to have this in the budget now, and it's gonna go towards, we talked about,

255
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:27,719
[SPEAKER_12]: getting some new uniforms, attend some more clinics and camps for the kids to go to that can get super expensive, and some equipment that we'll need during the season as well, which is super exciting.

256
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:33,603
[SPEAKER_12]: And Silvio Cello Family Foundation does a great job year in and year out with this grant.

257
00:17:33,904 --> 00:17:38,487
[SPEAKER_12]: They give it out to four different teams who are in need and who can apply to it.

258
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:44,332
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just a great way to continue on his legacy to give back to young people, which is what we're all here for.

259
00:17:44,352 --> 00:17:45,373
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you, Chris.

260
00:17:48,511 --> 00:17:50,211
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to piggyback on what he said.

261
00:17:50,492 --> 00:17:55,714
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been part of the booster board for about six years now.

262
00:17:56,014 --> 00:17:57,634
[SPEAKER_20]: I just took over as the president this year.

263
00:17:58,895 --> 00:18:04,997
[SPEAKER_20]: I know most of you have kids and you fundraise for your kids' sports teams and activities.

264
00:18:05,037 --> 00:18:10,099
[SPEAKER_20]: You know how hard it is to get donations and to get a grant of this size.

265
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:11,440
[SPEAKER_20]: It really is going to really help us.

266
00:18:12,673 --> 00:18:15,696
[SPEAKER_20]: We've had uniforms we've had, we've had them for six years now.

267
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,317
[SPEAKER_20]: The booster clubs bought those.

268
00:18:17,858 --> 00:18:20,260
[SPEAKER_20]: The average life of a uniform is like four to five years.

269
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,623
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's going to be good to make a dent in that.

270
00:18:24,444 --> 00:18:28,468
[SPEAKER_20]: It's also, you know, get some things to help, you know,

271
00:18:29,148 --> 00:18:30,608
[SPEAKER_20]: take our program to the next level.

272
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:36,190
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're really excited as a board to receive this.

273
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:42,371
[SPEAKER_20]: It was great news when I got the email from Bobby saying that we received this great honor.

274
00:18:42,651 --> 00:18:45,732
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you.

275
00:18:45,812 --> 00:18:48,793
[SPEAKER_20]: And I hope you guys will approve it.

276
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:49,653
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, we'll approve it.

277
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:50,213
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll approve it.

278
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:51,613
[SPEAKER_15]: This is Cuno.

279
00:18:51,653 --> 00:18:53,694
[SPEAKER_15]: The way she dealt in the room, though.

280
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:56,434
[SPEAKER_15]: Chairman, will you accept the donation?

281
00:18:56,614 --> 00:18:56,835
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

282
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,275
[SPEAKER_15]: This is Cuno.

283
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:04,560
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to say thank you, and also if we could send a letter.

284
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, a letter of thanking.

285
00:19:07,621 --> 00:19:10,141
[SPEAKER_11]: And there was one more thing I was going to say.

286
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:24,565
[SPEAKER_11]: To Mr. Nascimento, not only do I want to say thank you to you for being the high school football coach, and the team has done a great job, and I don't think I'll forget the last Thanksgiving game ever, but I also want to commend you on

287
00:19:25,045 --> 00:19:26,528
[SPEAKER_11]: the academic side of what you're doing.

288
00:19:26,989 --> 00:19:31,879
[SPEAKER_11]: You've done a terrific job and I hear the students all the time speaking about coming down.

289
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,424
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to say thank you to you on that.

290
00:19:35,126 --> 00:19:35,426
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

291
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:52,464
[SPEAKER_07]: I just also want to say, great job, and it's wonderful to hear part of the previous report when our students also are being recognized for being good athletes.

292
00:19:52,584 --> 00:20:01,926
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to do our part, too, because we're going to make sure that your line item is not cut in any way, shape, or form because of this excellent donation.

293
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:06,387
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll make sure that it is a plus, as it's meant to be.

294
00:20:07,087 --> 00:20:08,268
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

295
00:20:08,288 --> 00:20:09,068
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. DiBenedetta.

296
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,029
[SPEAKER_07]: So did you apply for this grant?

297
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:13,590
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, Mr. Maloney applied for it.

298
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,291
[SPEAKER_12]: And I wasn't aware of it.

299
00:20:16,311 --> 00:20:17,612
[SPEAKER_12]: And all of a sudden, it came across.

300
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:20,533
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was a surprise to you that he had done that?

301
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:20,993
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a surprise.

302
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:21,713
[SPEAKER_12]: It was amazing, yeah.

303
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:30,617
[SPEAKER_06]: And today, with how tight our budget has been, and the program has really run well,

304
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,452
[SPEAKER_06]: And we all appreciate that.

305
00:20:34,852 --> 00:20:46,946
[SPEAKER_06]: But these type of situations, when teachers and administrators go out and go above and beyond to bring money back into the community and to our students, I just want to say thank you to you and to Ms.

306
00:20:46,966 --> 00:20:51,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Maloney for taking these opportunities and to be proactive.

307
00:20:52,654 --> 00:20:54,195
[SPEAKER_06]: and on our students' behalf.

308
00:20:54,615 --> 00:21:06,361
[SPEAKER_06]: So I hope you tell Mr. Maloney, and I'm telling you directly, that I love to see this in the teachers and the care and the effort that you put forth for our students.

309
00:21:06,821 --> 00:21:07,482
[SPEAKER_06]: It's appreciated.

310
00:21:07,562 --> 00:21:07,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

311
00:21:08,102 --> 00:21:08,442
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

312
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:10,563
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Murphy, you're next.

313
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,345
[SPEAKER_20]: While I have you all here, I just want to invite you all.

314
00:21:14,365 --> 00:21:17,467
[SPEAKER_20]: June 18, we're going to have our big fundraiser we do every year.

315
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:19,188
[SPEAKER_20]: It's 12th year we've done it, the Push-Up-A-Thon.

316
00:21:19,972 --> 00:21:21,532
[SPEAKER_20]: It's going to be at 3 o'clock at the high school.

317
00:21:21,992 --> 00:21:26,373
[SPEAKER_20]: You guys are all more than welcome to come down, time some push-ups that the kids do.

318
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:29,534
[SPEAKER_20]: It's one of our biggest fundraisers, and the kids have a lot of fun.

319
00:21:29,654 --> 00:21:30,194
[SPEAKER_20]: I can do two.

320
00:21:30,294 --> 00:21:31,274
[SPEAKER_20]: Are we doing push-ups?

321
00:21:32,055 --> 00:21:33,175
[SPEAKER_20]: You guys, if you want to.

322
00:21:33,615 --> 00:21:35,355
[SPEAKER_20]: I know George can do like five push-ups.

323
00:21:35,415 --> 00:21:35,855
[SPEAKER_20]: I can do two.

324
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:36,176
[SPEAKER_20]: No, no, no.

325
00:21:36,196 --> 00:21:36,356
[SPEAKER_20]: Two.

326
00:21:36,376 --> 00:21:37,176
[SPEAKER_20]: So what time is this?

327
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:37,976
[SPEAKER_20]: On the 18th?

328
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:41,037
[SPEAKER_20]: It's at 3 o'clock, June 18th, at the gymnasium.

329
00:21:41,437 --> 00:21:41,717
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

330
00:21:42,257 --> 00:21:42,537
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

331
00:21:43,563 --> 00:21:45,746
[SPEAKER_15]: Coach Nassimather, good luck in the upcoming season.

332
00:21:46,446 --> 00:21:47,427
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for being here tonight.

333
00:21:47,948 --> 00:21:52,233
[SPEAKER_15]: Chris Murphy, congratulations on being named president of the Football Associates.

334
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:55,196
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you to Athletic Director Ms.

335
00:21:55,236 --> 00:21:57,219
[SPEAKER_15]: Maloney for obtaining the grant.

336
00:21:57,699 --> 00:21:58,380
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other questions?

337
00:21:59,221 --> 00:22:01,744
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, on the motion, Mr. Skerry to approve.

338
00:22:01,764 --> 00:22:03,225
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Skerry, could you please call the roll?

339
00:22:04,694 --> 00:22:07,997
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion to accept the $3,000 grant.

340
00:22:08,178 --> 00:22:08,278
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

341
00:22:08,978 --> 00:22:13,903
[SPEAKER_14]: Cuno, Mr. Benedetto, Mr. Falco, Mr. Scarpelli, Ms.

342
00:22:13,943 --> 00:22:14,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Vanderbilt.

343
00:22:14,384 --> 00:22:14,864
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

344
00:22:16,926 --> 00:22:18,168
[SPEAKER_15]: Six in favor, one absent.

345
00:22:18,188 --> 00:22:20,590
[SPEAKER_15]: The grant is accepted.

346
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:21,691
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

347
00:22:29,324 --> 00:22:34,186
[SPEAKER_18]: Just like Belichick, we won our version of the Super Bowl against Malden last year.

348
00:22:34,206 --> 00:22:35,886
[SPEAKER_18]: We're ready.

349
00:22:37,927 --> 00:22:44,969
[SPEAKER_15]: Next item is the recommendation to approve extended year, day, and evening programs at Medford Vocational Technical High School.

350
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:45,649
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Superintendent.

351
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:50,211
[SPEAKER_18]: Chairman and members of the committee, our director of vocational school, Heidi Riggio, is here.

352
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:58,234
[SPEAKER_18]: And she's going to begin by telling you a little bit about this program to extend the day and also to recognize one of our outstanding students who

353
00:22:59,494 --> 00:23:01,938
[SPEAKER_18]: really came up with something special along with his teacher.

354
00:23:01,978 --> 00:23:04,661
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm going to turn it over to our director, Heidi Richie.

355
00:23:09,228 --> 00:23:13,073
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Superintendent Belson and school committee.

356
00:23:13,233 --> 00:23:15,336
[SPEAKER_22]: I appreciate you having me come here.

357
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:21,353
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like I don't know if that was true or not, but it is so true.

358
00:23:21,374 --> 00:23:23,775
[SPEAKER_22]: So true, I promise.

359
00:23:24,856 --> 00:23:25,737
[SPEAKER_22]: It's all good stuff.

360
00:23:25,857 --> 00:23:30,600
[SPEAKER_22]: So in your packets today, you have a couple points of interest.

361
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,182
[SPEAKER_22]: The first point of interest is

362
00:23:32,862 --> 00:23:38,024
[SPEAKER_22]: extending or reconnecting with our evening school program at the vocational school.

363
00:23:38,764 --> 00:23:55,409
[SPEAKER_22]: As you know, in the past, we have had a very successful evening program, and I'm not sure when it ended, but it did end at some point, and we believe that our students deserve continuing education at a value price.

364
00:23:55,729 --> 00:24:01,651
[SPEAKER_22]: So instead of going to a proprietary school, there should be no reason why our students are not continuing

365
00:24:02,124 --> 00:24:04,926
[SPEAKER_22]: their education at Medford Vocational School in the evening.

366
00:24:05,426 --> 00:24:20,478
[SPEAKER_22]: In addition to that, that serves the community at large as well, because there are plenty of tradesmen out there within the Medford community that would benefit from continuing education units, which is required in order for them to maintain their license.

367
00:24:21,178 --> 00:24:25,321
[SPEAKER_22]: So there are a variety of classes that we're starting with for next year.

368
00:24:25,421 --> 00:24:27,543
[SPEAKER_22]: We are keeping it limited.

369
00:24:28,107 --> 00:24:29,709
[SPEAKER_22]: so that we can grow the program.

370
00:24:29,789 --> 00:24:36,657
[SPEAKER_22]: As you know, whenever you start programs, you need to slow and steady and make sure you get all of the bugs out.

371
00:24:37,177 --> 00:24:46,788
[SPEAKER_22]: We have had a successful electrical program using Gould Institute last year, but they removed the contract and is using another vocational school.

372
00:24:48,170 --> 00:25:04,900
[SPEAKER_22]: down north, and so we would like to have our own electrical school at Medford Vocational School, as well as cosmetology, which would be a full 1,000-hour cosmetology licensure course, as well as a 100-hour nail technician course.

373
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:11,323
[SPEAKER_22]: There are also a variety of other classes that we are investigating, including welding and metal fabrication.

374
00:25:11,464 --> 00:25:21,289
[SPEAKER_22]: As we know, sheet metal is a requirement for all industries within the construction industry that they are certified in sheet metal and have so many hours towards that license.

375
00:25:21,329 --> 00:25:22,970
[SPEAKER_22]: So we'd like to continue that as well.

376
00:25:24,952 --> 00:25:26,272
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's for the evening school.

377
00:25:27,053 --> 00:25:29,574
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't know if you have any questions related to evening school.

378
00:25:29,614 --> 00:25:29,734
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

379
00:25:32,345 --> 00:25:32,745
[SPEAKER_19]: Well done.

380
00:25:33,346 --> 00:25:33,486
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

381
00:25:33,546 --> 00:25:57,128
[SPEAKER_19]: Riccio, I think this is something that I've been talking about when a friend of mine who was working at Lawrence Vocational Tech and now who's at neighboring community talked about how schools would open up their vocational school and offer programs like this to our eighth grade students to see and get interested in vocational education.

382
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:03,886
[SPEAKER_19]: And also, just for the novice to explore some of programming, getting more involved.

383
00:26:04,707 --> 00:26:13,475
[SPEAKER_19]: The nominal cost is something that will cover the teacher's pay, the equipment that's needed, and any upkeep for the building, correct?

384
00:26:14,252 --> 00:26:14,632
[SPEAKER_22]: Correct.

385
00:26:14,732 --> 00:26:28,559
[SPEAKER_22]: Typically when you re-engage in an evening school program, there may be a small incremental loss in the first three years, but it's really an investment that you're making for a long-term commitment for evening school.

386
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:34,422
[SPEAKER_22]: So there may be an incremental loss, which obviously would be recorded, but the intention is for it to be self-sustaining.

387
00:26:34,782 --> 00:26:42,865
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, if you look at the top notch vocational schools in the region, I think they are, not only do they have a great high school program, but then an evening school too.

388
00:26:42,925 --> 00:26:48,427
[SPEAKER_19]: So I applaud you and congratulate you again on moving us forward.

389
00:26:48,447 --> 00:26:48,987
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you.

390
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:50,808
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. Cuno.

391
00:26:52,869 --> 00:26:54,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Just basically, thank you.

392
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:55,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

393
00:26:56,291 --> 00:26:56,932
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you.

394
00:26:57,953 --> 00:27:01,796
[SPEAKER_11]: This has been something that we've been pushing for for a very long time.

395
00:27:01,816 --> 00:27:04,038
[SPEAKER_11]: I am totally excited about this.

396
00:27:04,058 --> 00:27:06,661
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been a long time coming.

397
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:13,527
[SPEAKER_11]: And the way it's presented, the way it's set up, I can't really express how happy I am about this.

398
00:27:14,128 --> 00:27:18,211
[SPEAKER_11]: I will ask, I know that this is for after school, more at night.

399
00:27:20,053 --> 00:27:30,420
[SPEAKER_11]: Just again, I know we've had the discussion of maybe something in the summer for maybe students that might be interested, or even something during the school year, like after school, if that's possible.

400
00:27:31,181 --> 00:27:37,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Totally understandable that this was never, I know that when we brought it up in the past, it was never to make money.

401
00:27:38,005 --> 00:27:48,728
[SPEAKER_11]: It was really to get a foundation started up to bring more eyes and ears to the vocational side of our school, to give all students the opportunity to see what we were offering.

402
00:27:49,388 --> 00:27:58,090
[SPEAKER_11]: And I really commend you all and all the teachers that were involved in this because this is a long time coming and I can't be more happier than this.

403
00:27:58,231 --> 00:27:58,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much.

404
00:28:00,091 --> 00:28:01,052
[SPEAKER_15]: This is D Benedetto.

405
00:28:01,332 --> 00:28:13,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to clarify, this is just the evening classes for children that have graduated from Most Method Vocational High School and other graduated high school people that want to continue their

406
00:28:15,738 --> 00:28:19,419
[SPEAKER_06]: their licensure or complete a program.

407
00:28:19,459 --> 00:28:20,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I correct?

408
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:20,699
[SPEAKER_22]: Correct.

409
00:28:20,739 --> 00:28:40,642
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's for recent vocational high school students in Medford and beyond, but also for the existing workforce who have to continue their education or often what we will hear from students that maybe they graduated two years ago and to go to a proprietary school, they don't actually get financial aid.

410
00:28:40,682 --> 00:28:45,183
[SPEAKER_22]: They get loans, but they don't get financial aid because a degree isn't offered.

411
00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:53,615
[SPEAKER_22]: So because of that, it becomes very expensive for them to be able to support and to be able to pay for this coursework.

412
00:28:53,735 --> 00:29:03,445
[SPEAKER_22]: So typically, when a vocational school offers that evening program, it is anywhere from 50 to 75% of the cost compared to a proprietary school.

413
00:29:03,485 --> 00:29:05,447
[SPEAKER_22]: So this is actually twofold.

414
00:29:05,527 --> 00:29:08,250
[SPEAKER_22]: So we have that evening school program for the continuing ed.

415
00:29:08,912 --> 00:29:21,337
[SPEAKER_22]: which we are hoping to get off the ground so that in January we're able to offer those enrichment type courses for whether they're existing high school students or even just the community at large.

416
00:29:21,397 --> 00:29:30,541
[SPEAKER_22]: Kind of like the fun classes, you know, maybe a knitting class and, but it's really getting this, the focus is to get the training that these students need at a reasonable cost.

417
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:36,624
[SPEAKER_22]: The second part of this program is a summer exploration program for incoming eighth grade students.

418
00:29:37,324 --> 00:29:40,185
[SPEAKER_22]: And you have been given the registration form for that.

419
00:29:40,285 --> 00:29:45,086
[SPEAKER_22]: And we've selected 30 students at each of the two middle schools in Medford.

420
00:29:45,126 --> 00:29:47,547
[SPEAKER_22]: And we've already received multiple phone calls.

421
00:29:49,027 --> 00:29:51,688
[SPEAKER_22]: They wanted to take credit cards, so I said, not yet.

422
00:29:52,548 --> 00:29:56,069
[SPEAKER_22]: But any help on that would be greatly appreciated.

423
00:29:56,109 --> 00:29:57,910
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I know everybody uses credit cards now.

424
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:01,571
[SPEAKER_22]: But we are offering five to six different programs.

425
00:30:02,766 --> 00:30:16,400
[SPEAKER_22]: for incoming eighth graders to explore the vocational school, knowing that we are collaborating with the high school and their academic coursework would actually be already integrated with the high school, but yet they can opt and select.

426
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,843
[SPEAKER_22]: And we're using this as a promotional means for our programs.

427
00:30:20,364 --> 00:30:24,648
[SPEAKER_15]: If I may add really quick, um, I know that, uh, Pat is working on the piece.

428
00:30:25,788 --> 00:30:26,949
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully that will be coming soon.

429
00:30:26,969 --> 00:30:27,610
[SPEAKER_15]: So it is in the works.

430
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:27,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

431
00:30:28,671 --> 00:30:31,413
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've been working on it, so that should be coming soon.

432
00:30:31,433 --> 00:30:32,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

433
00:30:32,254 --> 00:30:33,815
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. Van de Kloot, you had a question?

434
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:34,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

435
00:30:34,436 --> 00:30:36,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Heidi, could you explain that a little bit more?

436
00:30:36,277 --> 00:30:41,802
[SPEAKER_07]: You said we selected 30 students from each school, which is to say they were sent this information specifically?

437
00:30:42,723 --> 00:30:50,491
[SPEAKER_22]: I actually did not select only because I do not obviously know these students, and we didn't necessarily hand select the students.

438
00:30:50,911 --> 00:30:58,719
[SPEAKER_22]: What we did was to keep it equitable between the two middle schools is that there are 30 slots from each of the two middle schools.

439
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,562
[SPEAKER_07]: So was it sent out to the entire student body?

440
00:31:03,118 --> 00:31:10,981
[SPEAKER_22]: I would, I know that it was posted, I know Paul DeLeva had posted it on his Facebook page and Twitter account, so I know that it was posted publicly.

441
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:17,084
[SPEAKER_22]: And then the interest would actually go to the guidance counselor directly at that middle school.

442
00:31:17,824 --> 00:31:21,045
[SPEAKER_22]: Parents would need to sign off on it because there is a cost to this.

443
00:31:21,705 --> 00:31:28,128
[SPEAKER_22]: In addition to that, they cannot have, I mean there's a disciplinary and attendance piece to it.

444
00:31:28,755 --> 00:31:34,299
[SPEAKER_22]: because we would want to make sure that that child is obviously safe working with equipment.

445
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,001
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

446
00:31:37,421 --> 00:31:38,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for explaining that a little bit more.

447
00:31:39,102 --> 00:31:39,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

448
00:31:40,423 --> 00:31:43,585
[SPEAKER_07]: So 60 is the maximum number of students you expect to be able to take?

449
00:31:43,805 --> 00:31:44,405
[SPEAKER_07]: For this year, yes.

450
00:31:44,425 --> 00:31:44,886
[SPEAKER_00]: For this year.

451
00:31:45,366 --> 00:31:52,551
[SPEAKER_07]: And these courses, and I'm speaking specifically about one-grade graders, they will be taught by our current staff.

452
00:31:53,986 --> 00:32:01,149
[SPEAKER_22]: We would post it, much like we would post any other positions, and the hope is that our existing staff would apply.

453
00:32:01,869 --> 00:32:08,311
[SPEAKER_22]: If not, we would obviously reach out to the existing staff within Medford Public Schools.

454
00:32:08,911 --> 00:32:09,211
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

455
00:32:09,852 --> 00:32:13,193
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was my same question with the evening offerings.

456
00:32:14,053 --> 00:32:22,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you anticipate that that would be our staff, or are you thinking that it would be a staff that we hire specifically to run the evening program?

457
00:32:23,453 --> 00:32:32,325
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a combination of both because when you are a Chapter 74 teacher's license is not equivalent to an adult education license.

458
00:32:32,782 --> 00:32:35,685
[SPEAKER_22]: So they would need to be dual certified in that particular piece.

459
00:32:35,925 --> 00:32:48,297
[SPEAKER_22]: So if they are, we would certainly want to employ our existing workforce because we know them and they know the community, but we would have to post making sure that they meet the requirements.

460
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:53,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, it seems when I've been up at the vocational school in the evening, I see many cars.

461
00:32:54,282 --> 00:32:57,203
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, I'm somewhat surprised that Gould has pulled out.

462
00:32:58,383 --> 00:33:05,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that because of a lack of students or, well, can you give us any better understanding of that?

463
00:33:05,745 --> 00:33:14,007
[SPEAKER_22]: They were using another vocational school for three other programs, so it made sense for them from a business perspective.

464
00:33:15,628 --> 00:33:18,029
[SPEAKER_22]: to have one contract under one house.

465
00:33:18,069 --> 00:33:22,732
[SPEAKER_22]: So there wasn't necessarily any reason other than them streamlining into one location.

466
00:33:23,052 --> 00:33:28,855
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's at a greater distance so that us offering it here will have enough potential.

467
00:33:29,596 --> 00:33:29,996
[SPEAKER_22]: Correct.

468
00:33:30,076 --> 00:33:37,300
[SPEAKER_22]: We definitely have enough existing workforce within this community in order to sustain, we believe, the program.

469
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,241
[SPEAKER_15]: That's great.

470
00:33:38,281 --> 00:33:38,621
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

471
00:33:39,401 --> 00:33:40,162
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. DiBenedetta.

472
00:33:41,214 --> 00:33:45,586
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of my questions were about staffing, who's going to staff the evening program.

473
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:49,388
[SPEAKER_06]: And my other question is, how do you figure out the cost?

474
00:33:50,169 --> 00:34:01,133
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to make sure that the maintenance of our equipment for our students is upgraded a little bit because of those costs and because of the usage.

475
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:04,955
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to see some of that money go back if there is any profit.

476
00:34:04,995 --> 00:34:12,958
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there might not be profit in the beginning, but when there is profit, that we reinvest those dollars into the vocational school to keep

477
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:20,085
[SPEAKER_06]: things up to date and if they're being used more, we need to make sure that they're maintained more.

478
00:34:20,265 --> 00:34:21,226
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a concern I have.

479
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:24,110
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, that's a legitimate concern, actually.

480
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:37,013
[SPEAKER_22]: Most other vocational schools that have a Gould will actually enforce that they have an employee of that program on site at all times because of that very thing.

481
00:34:37,073 --> 00:34:39,313
[SPEAKER_22]: If there is a maintenance issue or a maintenance concern.

482
00:34:39,353 --> 00:34:41,273
[SPEAKER_22]: At my former district, that was the case.

483
00:34:41,853 --> 00:34:50,235
[SPEAKER_22]: Where we are operating it under our own and not having an outside vendor come in to teach it, we do definitely have more control.

484
00:34:50,915 --> 00:34:54,077
[SPEAKER_22]: over who's teaching it, as well as the maintenance of the equipment.

485
00:34:54,658 --> 00:35:00,681
[SPEAKER_22]: And obviously, we would want any funds to be rolled back into the program to support the day students.

486
00:35:00,721 --> 00:35:06,925
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, that's the intention, is that our students during the day certainly come first, because that's our main purpose.

487
00:35:07,366 --> 00:35:11,648
[SPEAKER_22]: But for the equipment to sit idle isn't good either.

488
00:35:11,768 --> 00:35:18,533
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, a lot of this equipment, they want it to be operable more frequently than it currently is.

489
00:35:19,968 --> 00:35:42,837
[SPEAKER_06]: So through you to the superintendent, when we figure out this funding piece in the income from these programs, can we please set aside a good maintenance, a good amount of this money to go back into our vocational school, not only the maintenance of the programs that it is existing, but the advancement of other programs through this.

490
00:35:43,177 --> 00:35:45,538
[SPEAKER_18]: The vocational school has revolving accounts.

491
00:35:46,223 --> 00:35:47,124
[SPEAKER_18]: It's already been set up.

492
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:54,147
[SPEAKER_18]: The goal will be to take any tuition in and put it back into those accounts, and when there are surpluses in there, to reinvest it.

493
00:35:54,727 --> 00:36:04,212
[SPEAKER_18]: In addition to our own budgetary allocations that we may make, or capital improvements that we may make, that may be beyond the ability of this particular type of fundraising.

494
00:36:04,633 --> 00:36:05,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

495
00:36:06,514 --> 00:36:07,934
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. Cunha, did you have a question?

496
00:36:08,034 --> 00:36:08,915
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm all set, thank you.

497
00:36:10,021 --> 00:36:11,081
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Riccio, thank you very much.

498
00:36:11,101 --> 00:36:12,922
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a great initiative.

499
00:36:13,002 --> 00:36:14,843
[SPEAKER_15]: I know it's something we've been looking at for a while.

500
00:36:14,943 --> 00:36:16,964
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's good to see that it's here.

501
00:36:17,004 --> 00:36:18,405
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you very much.

502
00:36:18,925 --> 00:36:24,667
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Mrs. Scarapelli to approve extended year day and evening programs at Meffitt Vocational Technical High School.

503
00:36:25,147 --> 00:36:25,888
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

504
00:36:25,908 --> 00:36:27,168
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

505
00:36:27,828 --> 00:36:28,409
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

506
00:36:30,209 --> 00:36:34,951
[SPEAKER_15]: Next item is the report on robotics project at Meffitt Vocational Technical High School.

507
00:36:34,971 --> 00:36:35,412
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. Riccio.

508
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:37,271
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

509
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:44,615
[SPEAKER_22]: I would also like to call up Rich Cormio, our electrical instructor, and Hunter Raymond, a senior in the electrical program.

510
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:55,480
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just actually going to read the script, because it's pretty important that I'm going to let them talk, because they know more about it than I am, because they've lived it.

511
00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:03,484
[SPEAKER_22]: So Hunter Raymond was recently included in the April edition of Tech Directions magazine, which I believe you all received a copy of.

512
00:37:05,037 --> 00:37:06,498
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a national publication.

513
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:17,446
[SPEAKER_22]: Hunter is a senior in the electrical program at Medford Vocational Technical High School, who began taking an elective coding class with volunteer software engineers in the fall.

514
00:37:18,627 --> 00:37:28,375
[SPEAKER_22]: As a result, he began to seek better ways to communicate to Rich Cormier, an instructor in the electrical program who was on medical leave from a rare form of cancer.

515
00:37:29,607 --> 00:37:46,432
[SPEAKER_22]: Hunter, working with the software engineers and our new engineering instructor, Mr. Sam Christie, learned how to code and develop a software application that can control an Android tablet remotely from MVTHS to Rich Cormier's computer at his house.

516
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:58,995
[SPEAKER_22]: He then built a device with the assistance of the metal fabrication program that moves and is able to navigate through rows of desks so that Mr. Cormio could teach his electrical students from home.

517
00:38:00,116 --> 00:38:10,084
[SPEAKER_22]: Since then, Hunter has competed at SkillsUSA state competition, was on boston.com, and will be visiting iRobot in May.

518
00:38:12,126 --> 00:38:15,428
[SPEAKER_22]: Hunter will also be seen in the near future on Channel 7 News.

519
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:29,161
[SPEAKER_22]: Because of the partnership with the TEALS organization, a Microsoft company whose purpose is to teach computer science to students in the new engineering program, Hunter is interested in majoring in robotics next year.

520
00:38:30,122 --> 00:38:34,826
[SPEAKER_22]: His knowledge of electricity will assist him greatly in his future educational purposes.

521
00:38:36,033 --> 00:38:39,715
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I have attached the article so far that he has.

522
00:38:40,595 --> 00:38:48,419
[SPEAKER_22]: He was also contacted by the Donahue Institute, which is a research institute that organizes the STEM Summit.

523
00:38:48,479 --> 00:38:52,942
[SPEAKER_22]: It's an annual national conference of STEM professionals.

524
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:59,045
[SPEAKER_22]: And they were so impressed with the work of Rich Cormier and Hunter Raymond that they asked if they could be

525
00:38:59,605 --> 00:39:09,030
[SPEAKER_22]: the keynote speaker, and so they will be speaking in November, their story, sharing their story in front of 1,300 people this coming November.

526
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,872
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm going to let them speak.

527
00:39:12,932 --> 00:39:13,272
[SPEAKER_22]: Hunter.

528
00:39:15,697 --> 00:39:22,606
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just like to thank you guys all for letting me speak here tonight, and also, we've all had a great afternoon so far.

529
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:32,559
[SPEAKER_00]: So, at the beginning of the year, I learned about the new program that they just added to the vocational school, Robotics Engineering, and I've always had a thing for technology.

530
00:39:34,042 --> 00:39:41,284
[SPEAKER_00]: But before this year, the only thing I've really done with building technology was I worked on my own computer, and I built it.

531
00:39:42,025 --> 00:39:46,666
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I did that, I knew that this is kind of what I wanted to do in life.

532
00:39:46,866 --> 00:39:57,410
[SPEAKER_00]: And so seeing the new shop come into the vocational school, I knew that I had to work with the teachers somehow and feed my love and passion.

533
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:03,432
[SPEAKER_00]: So with Mr. Cormier being out for the past year and a half,

534
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:07,623
[SPEAKER_00]: and his love for teaching, I knew that he wanted to be back in the classroom.

535
00:40:08,764 --> 00:40:17,133
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea was brought up to me about basically holding a webcam and controlling it somehow.

536
00:40:17,673 --> 00:40:27,343
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't really know how yet, but at the time, just controlling it so he could look left and right and see the classroom from his home, so he could teach us and still feel like he was a part of the classroom.

537
00:40:29,283 --> 00:40:33,167
[SPEAKER_00]: So, at the time, I really did not think that much of it.

538
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:38,492
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved the idea, I was very intrigued by it, but I didn't really know if I could do it, to be honest.

539
00:40:40,394 --> 00:40:47,779
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went down to the robotics shop, I asked the teacher for help, and he assured me that this project could be done.

540
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:54,324
[SPEAKER_00]: So over the next eight weeks, I tested it and built this RichBot 3000.

541
00:40:54,404 --> 00:40:57,646
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a lot of trial and error.

542
00:41:01,752 --> 00:41:19,377
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I needed any other help from any of the shops in the vocational school, for instance, this robot, as you can see in the picture on the front of the magazine, the right picture, that pole that raised it up to eye-level height wasn't there at the beginning.

543
00:41:19,457 --> 00:41:26,099
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was driving around looking at people's shins, and it really wasn't very productive.

544
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:30,000
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went over to the HVAC shop and asked them,

545
00:41:30,979 --> 00:41:34,646
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a weld me some sort of pole or at the time.

546
00:41:34,686 --> 00:41:42,501
[SPEAKER_00]: I really didn't know what we could use to raise it up but a few days passed they came back to me with this this pole and

547
00:41:43,832 --> 00:41:50,656
[SPEAKER_00]: It just goes to show that I can go to any other shops that I need help from, and within the next day or two, they'll have exactly what I need.

548
00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:53,417
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was so helpful trying to build this thing.

549
00:41:53,937 --> 00:41:59,600
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely could not have done this without the robotics and engineering shop.

550
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:07,004
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the first year here, and that was the first major thing that we did in that shop.

551
00:42:10,022 --> 00:42:14,606
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't have done it without the robotics shop, without the help of the teacher Sam Christie.

552
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,963
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely my parents, they kept pushing me.

553
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:22,445
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day, they would tell me to just, you know.

554
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:26,628
[SPEAKER_00]: I would come home, I was so excited to tell them what I added on to the robot.

555
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:31,092
[SPEAKER_00]: And every day, they would just keep telling me to keep trying.

556
00:42:31,212 --> 00:42:36,557
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said before, it just goes to show what can be accomplished in the vocational school.

557
00:42:37,337 --> 00:42:41,281
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Rich has some words to say.

558
00:42:46,277 --> 00:42:52,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening and thanks for having us here tonight.

559
00:42:52,402 --> 00:42:58,766
[SPEAKER_17]: I would first like to start by thanking the school department for keeping my job for me while I was out.

560
00:42:58,786 --> 00:43:04,591
[SPEAKER_17]: I originally thought that I'd be back in September and then I had a little setback and I was able to come back the first of January.

561
00:43:05,932 --> 00:43:08,073
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been an incredible experience.

562
00:43:09,391 --> 00:43:14,093
[SPEAKER_17]: When I first went out, I spoke to Mr. Nelson, and I said, I'd like to try something different.

563
00:43:14,173 --> 00:43:15,754
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's try teaching from home.

564
00:43:16,114 --> 00:43:18,855
[SPEAKER_17]: And his words to me were, just go home and get better.

565
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:26,479
[SPEAKER_17]: And I appreciate that very much, because that first part of the year before June last year, I couldn't have done what I did afterwards.

566
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:31,921
[SPEAKER_17]: In September, I did have a setback back in August, which kept me out of school again.

567
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:41,955
[SPEAKER_17]: So I spoke to Adam Burns, the other electrical teacher, and I asked him if it would be OK with him if I taught via Skype.

568
00:43:42,775 --> 00:43:44,136
[SPEAKER_17]: And we cleared it with Ms.

569
00:43:44,156 --> 00:43:45,917
[SPEAKER_17]: Riggio, and we did that.

570
00:43:45,997 --> 00:43:46,878
[SPEAKER_17]: We did that for a little while.

571
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:48,539
[SPEAKER_17]: But it was difficult, like they said.

572
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:55,423
[SPEAKER_17]: If somebody asked a question, I'd say, Adam, can you turn the iPad, and we'd look around and see where everybody was.

573
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:00,515
[SPEAKER_17]: And then one night I got a call from Hunter saying that, you know, we're going to try this new thing out.

574
00:44:00,595 --> 00:44:01,116
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was.

575
00:44:01,136 --> 00:44:02,757
[SPEAKER_17]: It was down low and I'm driving it around.

576
00:44:02,798 --> 00:44:03,418
[SPEAKER_17]: There was nobody around.

577
00:44:03,438 --> 00:44:04,339
[SPEAKER_17]: It was wonderful.

578
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,943
[SPEAKER_17]: And by the time we got it perfected, I really screwed up.

579
00:44:07,003 --> 00:44:07,844
[SPEAKER_17]: I came back to school.

580
00:44:08,464 --> 00:44:10,387
[SPEAKER_17]: So we only really used it a couple of times.

581
00:44:10,467 --> 00:44:11,448
[SPEAKER_17]: But it was great to use it.

582
00:44:11,588 --> 00:44:15,353
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a phenomenal thing for Hunter to even think about doing.

583
00:44:16,049 --> 00:44:19,232
[SPEAKER_17]: And I have to thank him because it really helped my recovery.

584
00:44:19,292 --> 00:44:25,177
[SPEAKER_17]: As soon as I started teaching from home, my wife mentioned how my attitude and everything had changed.

585
00:44:25,658 --> 00:44:27,239
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I was getting a little dry at home.

586
00:44:27,299 --> 00:44:29,621
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not that easy to do.

587
00:44:29,641 --> 00:44:31,743
[SPEAKER_17]: Some people say, oh hey, you had a year and a half off.

588
00:44:31,783 --> 00:44:32,464
[SPEAKER_17]: That's great.

589
00:44:32,504 --> 00:44:34,326
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't really want it, and that's not the way you want to do it.

590
00:44:35,931 --> 00:44:39,753
[SPEAKER_17]: So I do want to thank you all for your support throughout my illness.

591
00:44:39,913 --> 00:44:41,074
[SPEAKER_17]: And I feel like I'm back 100%.

592
00:44:41,514 --> 00:44:42,634
[SPEAKER_17]: I teach every day.

593
00:44:42,694 --> 00:44:46,296
[SPEAKER_17]: And I thank God every day that I'm back doing what I love to do.

594
00:44:46,336 --> 00:44:46,916
[SPEAKER_17]: And thank you.

595
00:44:47,616 --> 00:44:48,617
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

596
00:44:48,657 --> 00:44:49,077
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

597
00:44:49,257 --> 00:44:50,057
[SPEAKER_17]: Mrs. Van.

598
00:44:51,058 --> 00:44:54,019
[SPEAKER_07]: So first, Mr. Cormier, I have to say it's delightful to see you here again.

599
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:54,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

600
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:58,081
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're very happy that you're back.

601
00:44:58,101 --> 00:45:00,182
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, now, if you take a day off,

602
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:02,692
[SPEAKER_07]: or two, there's no safe place, there's no hiding.

603
00:45:04,433 --> 00:45:10,358
[SPEAKER_07]: And this gives us sort of a new perspective to, you know, they say, so teachers somehow know it's like they have eyes behind their head.

604
00:45:10,819 --> 00:45:12,700
[SPEAKER_07]: And now you've got them all over.

605
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,542
[SPEAKER_07]: So a great project.

606
00:45:14,582 --> 00:45:16,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Hunter, thank you for taking the initiative.

607
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:25,231
[SPEAKER_07]: And because I actually think, you know, I mean, if you think about it, we've talked about, you know, students being home and I've read some articles, but this is now

608
00:45:25,872 --> 00:45:28,536
[SPEAKER_07]: when a teacher has to be out, what a great potential here.

609
00:45:28,716 --> 00:45:31,240
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you so much and it's great to see you.

610
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:43,036
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank God that you're with us and I appreciate everything that you're fighting to be back in the classroom, so thank you.

611
00:45:43,517 --> 00:45:47,682
[SPEAKER_19]: But Hunter, you are an unbelievable role model.

612
00:45:47,782 --> 00:45:57,392
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to make sure that your presence here today, it just again, again with the vocational school when you talk about greatness in Medford.

613
00:45:59,093 --> 00:46:05,475
[SPEAKER_19]: So I want to commend you, because this is something that should be screamed from the rooftops.

614
00:46:06,356 --> 00:46:13,038
[SPEAKER_19]: To have that incentive and have that dream and drive not to stop in what you believe in.

615
00:46:13,078 --> 00:46:17,919
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a story that I'm going to go home and talk to my 12 year old son about, because that's very impressive.

616
00:46:17,939 --> 00:46:19,980
[SPEAKER_19]: So I congratulate you, nice job.

617
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,260
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you so much.

618
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:21,641
[SPEAKER_19]: Mrs. Cunha.

619
00:46:22,361 --> 00:46:24,681
[SPEAKER_11]: I echo what everyone else has said tonight.

620
00:46:24,722 --> 00:46:25,942
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, Mr. Cormier.

621
00:46:26,522 --> 00:46:27,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank God that you are here.

622
00:46:27,842 --> 00:46:32,864
[SPEAKER_11]: I know when you had told us a year and a half ago, it was devastating, you know, and the way it was.

623
00:46:32,984 --> 00:46:36,665
[SPEAKER_11]: But you're here, and sometimes, you know, who knows?

624
00:46:36,905 --> 00:46:40,166
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, this was such a wonderful thing that Hunter has done.

625
00:46:41,846 --> 00:46:49,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Hunter, like Mr. Scarpelli, you know, and everybody else, he is a clean cut, articulate,

626
00:46:50,658 --> 00:46:52,379
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice kid in front of us.

627
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:55,502
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a vocational high school student.

628
00:46:55,862 --> 00:46:57,183
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't be any prouder.

629
00:46:57,483 --> 00:47:07,951
[SPEAKER_11]: And your parents must be beaming, because you have no idea how you have changed the stereotypical vocational student tonight.

630
00:47:09,071 --> 00:47:10,813
[SPEAKER_11]: And you've made us extremely proud.

631
00:47:10,973 --> 00:47:16,517
[SPEAKER_11]: And as I said, and I know we've talked about it so many times, there are so many wonderful stories.

632
00:47:17,057 --> 00:47:19,438
[SPEAKER_11]: And yours tonight is just the topper.

633
00:47:20,059 --> 00:47:22,300
[SPEAKER_11]: And these are the stories that need to go out.

634
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,021
[SPEAKER_11]: These are the stories that our community and everyone else around us have to hear.

635
00:47:26,502 --> 00:47:33,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I am so tired of hearing about the bad kid or the bad person or something horrible happening.

636
00:47:33,065 --> 00:47:37,827
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have so many jewels in this city that put us to shame.

637
00:47:38,447 --> 00:47:41,269
[SPEAKER_11]: And you guys are the ones that are really the ones that are shining.

638
00:47:41,329 --> 00:47:43,770
[SPEAKER_11]: So we really need to make these kids shine.

639
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:45,991
[SPEAKER_11]: And we really need to promote that.

640
00:47:47,417 --> 00:47:48,237
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. DiBenedetto.

641
00:47:48,257 --> 00:47:48,297
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi.

642
00:47:49,097 --> 00:47:51,318
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad to see you here.

643
00:47:51,338 --> 00:47:51,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

644
00:47:52,478 --> 00:47:57,340
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also want to take this moment to commend our administration and our superintendent.

645
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:07,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Because not only have I seen him support you and the need that you had, I've seen him do it repeatedly throughout a district to many of our teachers.

646
00:48:08,443 --> 00:48:16,665
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of people don't realize how much of a big heart that administrative team have for all employees within our district.

647
00:48:17,487 --> 00:48:25,693
[SPEAKER_06]: And I see it not only in the superintendent, but his whole administrative team, repeatedly.

648
00:48:26,013 --> 00:48:27,935
[SPEAKER_06]: And the community needs to know that.

649
00:48:29,296 --> 00:48:32,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Secondly, I wanted to talk more about this.

650
00:48:32,218 --> 00:48:36,681
[SPEAKER_06]: I was speaking to my sister about this before I came tonight, as I was reviewing the paperwork.

651
00:48:37,461 --> 00:48:46,428
[SPEAKER_06]: And the bond that MedFit teachers have with their students, and the students, and the commitment that the students have to our teachers as well.

652
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:55,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Now your teacher was gone for a year and a half, so you must have had a strong bond with him for you to not give up when things got tough.

653
00:48:56,512 --> 00:48:58,993
[SPEAKER_06]: and keep trying until you got it right.

654
00:48:59,554 --> 00:49:04,396
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he was the first electrical teacher that I had at the vocational school.

655
00:49:04,916 --> 00:49:09,579
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had him for, I'd say around a year and a half before he had to leave.

656
00:49:10,139 --> 00:49:15,302
[SPEAKER_00]: So throughout that year and a half, obviously, we've built a very strong relationship.

657
00:49:15,982 --> 00:49:20,805
[SPEAKER_00]: And seeing him not be able to teach and knowing how much he's taught me,

658
00:49:22,547 --> 00:49:26,672
[SPEAKER_00]: I love having him teaching me, so it just kept driving me to get him back in the classroom.

659
00:49:27,313 --> 00:49:29,356
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a dream of every teacher?

660
00:49:31,118 --> 00:49:33,342
[SPEAKER_06]: To motivate children to

661
00:49:34,225 --> 00:49:43,408
[SPEAKER_06]: to figure out problems, to be self-driven, to figure things out, to work really hard, and to inspire them in a love for learning.

662
00:49:43,729 --> 00:49:47,950
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have that, and you represented that, and you gave it back to him.

663
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:52,052
[SPEAKER_06]: So that, to me, is commendable throughout this.

664
00:49:52,432 --> 00:49:55,293
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to comment, and I'd like mom and dad to stand up.

665
00:50:04,703 --> 00:50:08,264
[SPEAKER_06]: is talking about the struggles and how he came home and spoke to you.

666
00:50:08,784 --> 00:50:14,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Dad's over there shaking his head, like how he didn't give up and how you guys encouraged him.

667
00:50:14,686 --> 00:50:18,828
[SPEAKER_06]: So it takes a community to raise our children.

668
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:20,909
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm seeing that tonight.

669
00:50:20,969 --> 00:50:24,830
[SPEAKER_06]: We have parents, we have teachers, and we have students that really care.

670
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:27,631
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm really feeling very happy to be here.

671
00:50:28,071 --> 00:50:30,972
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm looking forward to see what you do in your future.

672
00:50:30,992 --> 00:50:31,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, me too.

673
00:50:31,972 --> 00:50:32,933
Thank you very much.

674
00:50:34,486 --> 00:50:35,768
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm amazed at his presence.

675
00:50:36,869 --> 00:50:37,751
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Skerry.

676
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:41,636
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Cormier, I'm glad to have you back, and thank you for your tutelage.

677
00:50:41,716 --> 00:50:49,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Hunter, you took the bull by the horns, and you've done possibly what no other student has done at Medford by

678
00:50:50,345 --> 00:50:54,531
[SPEAKER_14]: doing your thing with the robotics, getting that program off the ground.

679
00:50:54,911 --> 00:50:57,455
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're not only a student, but you're an innovator.

680
00:50:58,075 --> 00:51:01,240
[SPEAKER_14]: My next question to both of you is, I hope you've seen a patent attorney.

681
00:51:03,443 --> 00:51:06,347
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for your hard work, and Hunter, keep up the good work.

682
00:51:07,535 --> 00:51:09,277
[SPEAKER_14]: We're kind of afraid that that's what our robot wants.

683
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:15,824
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to say that Hunter definitely embraces the vocational spirit.

684
00:51:17,046 --> 00:51:20,249
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a saying around the school that we don't really see problems, we see solutions.

685
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:24,214
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's exactly what we do, what we try to teach them day in and day out.

686
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,676
[SPEAKER_15]: It's nice to know somebody was listening.

687
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:30,379
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Cormier, great to see you tonight after a fabulous job.

688
00:51:30,479 --> 00:51:36,603
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember actually you showing me this during the vocational school open house in the fall, and I was amazed then.

689
00:51:36,623 --> 00:51:38,664
[SPEAKER_15]: This is just a fabulous story.

690
00:51:38,924 --> 00:51:44,067
[SPEAKER_15]: This is another great story that's happening in the Memphis Public Schools, and it continues to happen more and more.

691
00:51:44,348 --> 00:51:45,188
[SPEAKER_15]: We love to see it.

692
00:51:45,708 --> 00:51:46,949
[SPEAKER_15]: I know myself, I'm so proud of you.

693
00:51:52,095 --> 00:51:55,219
[SPEAKER_15]: It's great to see the initiative.

694
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:56,581
[SPEAKER_15]: It's great to see that you wanted to do this.

695
00:51:56,942 --> 00:51:58,484
[SPEAKER_15]: It's great to have the support from your parents.

696
00:51:58,584 --> 00:51:59,185
[SPEAKER_15]: Great job.

697
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:01,247
[SPEAKER_15]: This is just a great story.

698
00:52:01,428 --> 00:52:02,128
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much.

699
00:52:09,695 --> 00:52:19,021
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just collecting my papers, but I think that this is a really great story to kick off our week-long festivities of Teacher Appreciation Week.

700
00:52:19,061 --> 00:52:30,749
[SPEAKER_22]: So I just want you to know that it is a wonderful story, because it's really about what the teachers do every day that's part of their daily world that changes these kids' lives.

701
00:52:30,829 --> 00:52:33,971
[SPEAKER_22]: So we appreciate all of the teachers.

702
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:35,772
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

703
00:52:40,313 --> 00:52:44,654
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to spell one false rumor that seems to be making its way around the city.

704
00:52:45,474 --> 00:52:51,816
[SPEAKER_18]: Hunter is not working on a robot that will be running the school district.

705
00:52:52,036 --> 00:52:54,977
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Mrs. Van de Kloet to accept the report and place on file.

706
00:52:54,997 --> 00:52:55,657
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

707
00:52:55,677 --> 00:52:55,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

708
00:52:55,957 --> 00:52:56,617
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

709
00:52:56,637 --> 00:52:58,078
[SPEAKER_15]: Report is accepted and placed on file.

710
00:52:58,138 --> 00:52:58,458
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

711
00:53:00,165 --> 00:53:06,127
[SPEAKER_15]: Next item, recommendation to approve school lunch price increase for school year 2015-2016.

712
00:53:06,387 --> 00:53:07,248
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Superintendent.

713
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:18,172
[SPEAKER_18]: Chairman and members of the committee, I'm going to call upon our Director of Finance and Administration, Pat Feely, to come up and deliver this report and tell you a little bit about why this is necessary at this time.

714
00:53:22,373 --> 00:53:23,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, school committee.

715
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:27,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Jewel Bradley was going to be here with me, but she is not feeling well.

716
00:53:28,992 --> 00:53:36,314
[SPEAKER_08]: The Medford Public Schools Breakfast and Lunch Program serves a large portion of the school population and is currently at a financial break-even point.

717
00:53:36,334 --> 00:53:42,635
[SPEAKER_08]: We're serving in the 40s, probably mid-point 40s on an average daily basis.

718
00:53:43,275 --> 00:53:52,777
[SPEAKER_08]: However, the food service program must ask at this time that a price increase be approved for both the breakfast and lunch services due to federal regulations and inherent cost increases.

719
00:53:53,497 --> 00:53:57,199
[SPEAKER_08]: The requested price increases are federally and financially necessary.

720
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:16,027
[SPEAKER_08]: At the federal level, the price increase assists the district in meeting a regulation requiring school food authorities participating in the National School Lunch Program to ensure sufficient funds are provided to the non-profit school food service account for meals served to students who are not eligible for free or reduced price meals.

721
00:54:17,597 --> 00:54:23,307
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole logic behind that is that free and reduced cannot support the lunch program.

722
00:54:24,669 --> 00:54:28,055
[SPEAKER_08]: They want to make sure that it's an equal amount of money coming from all avenues.

723
00:54:29,302 --> 00:54:38,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Currently, the FBS lunch prices average $2.65 per lunch, which is a combined calculation of current pricing weighted by free, reduced, and paid meals.

724
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:45,476
[SPEAKER_08]: To meet the USDA regulation, meals should have been $2.70 for the current FY15 fiscal year.

725
00:54:45,896 --> 00:54:48,258
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are a nickel behind as of this time.

726
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:54,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Financially, the food service program is breaking even with the current revenue stream and the current expenses.

727
00:54:55,268 --> 00:55:00,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Food costs have been increasing and reducing any reserves for maintenance and replacement of aging equipment.

728
00:55:01,015 --> 00:55:04,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Additional increased costs can be expected due to undetermined collective bargaining.

729
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:07,183
[SPEAKER_08]: The current price of breakfast is $1.

730
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:14,045
[SPEAKER_08]: The food service program is asking for an increase of $0.50, resulting in a breakfast price of $1.50.

731
00:55:14,886 --> 00:55:18,147
[SPEAKER_08]: The request for the lunch increase is $0.25 per lunch.

732
00:55:18,707 --> 00:55:31,232
[SPEAKER_08]: The current price of lunch is $2.50 at the elementary and $2.85 at the middle school and high school, resulting in $2.75 for elementary level and $3.10 at the middle school and high school, making our average weighted meal $2.90 a meal.

733
00:55:33,773 --> 00:55:42,881
[SPEAKER_08]: The requested price increase should align the food service program with the USDA regulations for the next three years, barring any extreme food or labor cost increases.

734
00:55:43,541 --> 00:55:50,067
[SPEAKER_08]: The last food service price increase occurred about a decade ago, according to what records that we could locate.

735
00:55:50,808 --> 00:55:59,055
[SPEAKER_08]: The school committee is asked to approve the price increase at this time in order to provide ample notification for our families who will be using this essential program next year.

736
00:56:01,628 --> 00:56:12,076
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Pat, what I'm understanding is that this is basically the federal government is moving this and saying we need to change our price.

737
00:56:12,477 --> 00:56:15,819
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to tell you, when I got to this paper, I was shocked at $1 to $1.50.

738
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:22,926
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they don't, they don't, you know, they don't, you know, they don't, you know,

739
00:56:33,977 --> 00:56:34,838
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't qualify.

740
00:56:35,899 --> 00:56:38,741
[SPEAKER_07]: And that just seemed like a lot.

741
00:56:39,962 --> 00:56:41,243
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was surprised at that.

742
00:56:41,683 --> 00:56:46,327
[SPEAKER_07]: When I got to the second part, I thought, 310, what an odd number.

743
00:56:46,387 --> 00:56:48,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Couldn't we just do $3?

744
00:56:48,248 --> 00:56:52,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we really need to do that dime?

745
00:56:52,672 --> 00:56:55,834
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to tell you, it is a long time, because I was thinking about it.

746
00:56:55,974 --> 00:56:57,155
[SPEAKER_07]: It has been a long time.

747
00:56:57,776 --> 00:56:58,656
[SPEAKER_07]: But it sure did.

748
00:57:01,118 --> 00:57:03,879
[SPEAKER_07]: I laughed at where it was, because we had all this good news.

749
00:57:04,499 --> 00:57:09,140
[SPEAKER_07]: And sometimes, you know, the superintendent mentioned something to us that's coming up or whatever.

750
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,560
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't mention this thing at all.

751
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:18,242
[SPEAKER_07]: And so all of a sudden, we got to this paper, and she was like, whoa, shocker here, trying to slide it in, thinking we wouldn't notice.

752
00:57:18,262 --> 00:57:19,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we noticed.

753
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:25,244
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to let you know that we did do a survey of all the surrounding communities in preparation for this.

754
00:57:25,404 --> 00:57:26,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because you knew we'd ask.

755
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:27,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we knew you would ask.

756
00:57:27,304 --> 00:57:28,064
[SPEAKER_08]: We knew you cared.

757
00:57:28,184 --> 00:57:30,285
[SPEAKER_08]: And we knew that it would be, you know,

758
00:57:31,025 --> 00:57:33,187
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something to think about, quite hardly.

759
00:57:33,267 --> 00:57:36,790
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we did a survey, and we surveyed all the local communities.

760
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:42,314
[SPEAKER_08]: And we tried to survey hitting the demographically similar districts to ours.

761
00:57:42,994 --> 00:57:44,516
[SPEAKER_08]: And breakfast in most communities is $2.

762
00:57:44,576 --> 00:57:47,938
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information, Mr. Chairman.

763
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:50,040
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information, Mr. Chairman.

764
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:50,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

765
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,462
[SPEAKER_14]: Selle, would you make a copy of the

766
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:57,732
[SPEAKER_14]: communities that were researched and get that to us, please.

767
00:57:57,792 --> 00:58:00,293
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that'll make the decision a lot easier.

768
00:58:00,313 --> 00:58:02,194
[SPEAKER_14]: Compare and contrast.

769
00:58:02,414 --> 00:58:04,295
[SPEAKER_08]: What was lunch?

770
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:07,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Lunch can be anywhere up to $4, depending on where you are.

771
00:58:08,077 --> 00:58:10,258
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are actually still one of the lowest ones.

772
00:58:11,299 --> 00:58:16,761
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is kind of an odd dollar amount, as you said, but the goal was not to reach a round number.

773
00:58:17,061 --> 00:58:23,305
[SPEAKER_08]: The goal was to do only what was necessary to get us through the next three years so that we didn't have to come back the next three years.

774
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:25,199
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Scarpone.

775
00:58:25,219 --> 00:58:25,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I?

776
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,180
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Vandenbroucke.

777
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:31,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this going to improve lunch options at all?

778
00:58:33,123 --> 00:58:34,784
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't say that for sure.

779
00:58:34,804 --> 00:58:42,787
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I walk through the building every morning, and I go through when the kids are eating breakfast, and they seem very happy with what's being offered.

780
00:58:43,408 --> 00:58:51,111
[SPEAKER_08]: I do know that Juul does an excellent job of using our commodity options, and that has helped keep our food costs down.

781
00:58:53,415 --> 00:58:56,538
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, you walk around the building and I don't hear a lot of complaining.

782
00:58:56,558 --> 00:58:59,642
[SPEAKER_08]: I see kids eating lunch, so I'm not sure.

783
00:59:00,122 --> 00:59:00,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

784
00:59:00,883 --> 00:59:01,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Scott.

785
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:08,872
[SPEAKER_19]: If I can, I, I don't, I don't, I'd like to table this, move this along because I think there's some information.

786
00:59:09,919 --> 00:59:13,381
[SPEAKER_19]: We haven't seen the actual breakdown with the food services.

787
00:59:14,982 --> 00:59:17,544
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, a breakdown has been for the last couple of years.

788
00:59:17,624 --> 00:59:22,547
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we as a school community, before we raise it a nickel, have to look at that, those options.

789
00:59:22,587 --> 00:59:27,090
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that maybe looking at other increases.

790
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:35,435
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that at some of the schools, the PTG run their, you know, their little, the little snack bar that kids,

791
00:59:36,626 --> 00:59:44,893
[SPEAKER_19]: come in and invest a lot of money that can afford to go in and buy the extra cookies and buy the extra ice cream and do all that and so forth and so on.

792
00:59:45,434 --> 00:59:50,438
[SPEAKER_19]: If we're at a point where we're looking to raise, because I didn't take this as this is the federal government.

793
00:59:50,458 --> 00:59:51,880
[SPEAKER_19]: The federal government numbers are one way.

794
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,601
[SPEAKER_19]: This isn't pushed by the federal government.

795
00:59:53,621 --> 00:59:54,081
[SPEAKER_19]: This is us.

796
00:59:54,782 --> 00:59:56,283
[SPEAKER_19]: This is our initiative.

797
00:59:56,363 --> 00:59:57,705
[SPEAKER_08]: We're a nickel behind right now.

798
00:59:58,212 --> 00:59:58,372
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

799
00:59:58,392 --> 01:00:01,394
[SPEAKER_19]: But this isn't coming from the federal government telling us we need to push anything.

800
01:00:01,814 --> 01:00:02,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

801
01:00:02,595 --> 01:00:02,915
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

802
01:00:02,935 --> 01:00:24,028
[SPEAKER_19]: So what I'd like to do is maybe look at some other, you know, look at our numbers first before we do anything and then look at what we're doing in that other piece where I know the high school has the different, um, different areas to purchase different types of foods that maybe we can capture funding that way instead of, um,

803
01:00:24,632 --> 01:00:29,115
[SPEAKER_19]: instead of doing this, because again, the free and reduced lunch, those kids are going to eat.

804
01:00:29,195 --> 01:00:29,675
[SPEAKER_19]: We know that.

805
01:00:31,376 --> 01:00:32,517
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the kids that are right in the middle.

806
01:00:33,397 --> 01:00:35,378
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, that might be the difference.

807
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:41,382
[SPEAKER_19]: Fifty cents a day might be the difference of not having a meal one of those days and whatnot.

808
01:00:42,683 --> 01:00:46,687
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like to look at it, and I make a motion that we table this until we get some more information.

809
01:00:46,707 --> 01:00:50,672
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, on the motion to table by Mr. Skarapelli, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

810
01:00:50,692 --> 01:00:51,653
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

811
01:00:51,673 --> 01:00:52,073
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

812
01:00:52,253 --> 01:00:53,114
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

813
01:00:53,675 --> 01:00:54,956
[SPEAKER_15]: This agenda item is tabled.

814
01:00:55,036 --> 01:00:57,499
[SPEAKER_15]: I just have one other point of information.

815
01:00:57,579 --> 01:00:58,760
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information, Mr. Skerry?

816
01:00:59,561 --> 01:00:59,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

817
01:00:59,801 --> 01:01:02,404
[SPEAKER_14]: Folley, could you have the lunch director put together a

818
01:01:03,913 --> 01:01:16,597
[SPEAKER_14]: An explanation of the USDA's program where to see what we're entitled to receive commodities and to what extent we really use what is offered.

819
01:01:16,617 --> 01:01:21,459
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe we can increase our participation to sort of stabilize the lunch prices.

820
01:01:21,539 --> 01:01:22,579
[SPEAKER_19]: My information is to-.

821
01:01:22,659 --> 01:01:24,180
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the information is to Scott Kelly.

822
01:01:25,194 --> 01:01:31,277
[SPEAKER_19]: If we have Jules presenting part of the budget, we wrap that with that, I think that would be very helpful.

823
01:01:31,317 --> 01:01:34,139
[SPEAKER_19]: We can set up being redundant of what we're doing with them.

824
01:01:34,839 --> 01:01:39,842
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, and if we could have the cost from the surrounding district before we vote on this, that'd be great.

825
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:44,745
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a few more, I believe Mrs. Cunha had a question, and Mrs. DiBenedetto, Mrs. Cunha.

826
01:01:45,705 --> 01:01:55,331
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to ask, I know that there are also students that will come and they've got their money or they don't have their money.

827
01:01:55,691 --> 01:01:57,593
[SPEAKER_11]: By law, we still need to feed these children.

828
01:01:58,133 --> 01:02:05,738
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that in the past, cafeteria workers have taken their name down and they kind of keep a tally.

829
01:02:06,758 --> 01:02:07,939
[SPEAKER_11]: of how much they owe.

830
01:02:08,059 --> 01:02:12,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Some children come back to school with the money, some children don't come back to school with the money.

831
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:25,485
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to find out if possible, like, if they're children that really should be on the free and reduced, but maybe because we haven't caught, you know, we haven't received an application, or we're not sure.

832
01:02:25,925 --> 01:02:32,328
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have those students that are repeating themselves daily, but belong on the free and reduced lunch plan.

833
01:02:32,788 --> 01:02:42,530
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe that's also a different way of seeing some money come back in because if they're not applying and they really are supposed to be on that, we're losing some money there.

834
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:56,174
[SPEAKER_11]: And because I remember like when I was in the cafeterias and stuff in the past, as I said, you know, students would forget or they wouldn't have the money on them and some would come back and some wouldn't, but I always used to wonder like, how much money are we not getting back?

835
01:02:56,874 --> 01:03:01,975
[SPEAKER_11]: So, and is it, you know, is it from a student who can't afford it or is it from a student who

836
01:03:02,975 --> 01:03:04,176
[SPEAKER_11]: the application number went through.

837
01:03:04,376 --> 01:03:06,677
[SPEAKER_11]: So if there's some way of trying to figure that out too.

838
01:03:07,057 --> 01:03:10,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, and I think that Jill Bradley would have the answers for that.

839
01:03:10,779 --> 01:03:11,479
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, thank you.

840
01:03:11,499 --> 01:03:13,100
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. DiBenedetto.

841
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:24,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I too was going to ask for a budget for the last few years to go over what we've done, how much money's come in, because I know we've put a new program in how parents pay in the last few years.

842
01:03:24,665 --> 01:03:27,727
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wanted to know, I know now that you can track things a little.

843
01:03:29,387 --> 01:03:38,329
[SPEAKER_06]: easier electronically, and we can see where the money's gone in and where the money's gone out, and if there are any surplus funds, and what equipment needs to be updated as well.

844
01:03:38,689 --> 01:03:48,671
[SPEAKER_06]: If we knew that, you know, as well, and what other big expenditures for this program we need to pay for in the near future, that would also be helpful.

845
01:03:49,191 --> 01:03:52,792
[SPEAKER_06]: So any information and all information would be helpful.

846
01:03:52,932 --> 01:03:53,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

847
01:03:53,932 --> 01:04:03,482
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not saying, the price of food has gone up, and I understand that we may need to do this at some point, but we just want to make sure we do our due diligence as a committee.

848
01:04:04,163 --> 01:04:04,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

849
01:04:04,744 --> 01:04:05,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Scarry.

850
01:04:05,405 --> 01:04:15,535
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, just to follow up with Mr. Benedetto said, would it be possible to get a report on what machinery or things that have been misplaced or unaccounted for?

851
01:04:16,882 --> 01:04:25,050
[SPEAKER_14]: I know years past we were always short of meat slicer, or pots and pans, or what have you.

852
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:29,254
[SPEAKER_14]: We could get a report what's not been accounted for in the last couple of years.

853
01:04:32,324 --> 01:04:35,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Falco, I think they're pretty strict about that now.

854
01:04:35,586 --> 01:04:40,268
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, one day I had to take home a bowl, and I think that was like on Saturday.

855
01:04:40,508 --> 01:04:43,470
[SPEAKER_07]: And by Monday I had a call saying, Paulette, remember to bring the bowl back.

856
01:04:44,651 --> 01:04:45,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I did, of course.

857
01:04:45,851 --> 01:04:47,592
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think they've got it down.

858
01:04:49,773 --> 01:04:51,374
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for your report.

859
01:04:51,514 --> 01:04:53,896
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've tabled this report here.

860
01:04:53,936 --> 01:04:56,217
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll take it up during our budget sessions.

861
01:04:59,721 --> 01:05:05,465
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, next item is a recommendation to reject the school choice program for school year 2015-2016.

862
01:05:06,126 --> 01:05:06,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Superintendent.

863
01:05:07,007 --> 01:05:07,607
[SPEAKER_18]: Move approval.

864
01:05:07,627 --> 01:05:11,410
[SPEAKER_18]: Chair and members of the committee, this is a standard thing we do every year.

865
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:15,973
[SPEAKER_18]: I have to report to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education by June 1st.

866
01:05:16,313 --> 01:05:17,935
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm asking that you take the vote this evening.

867
01:05:18,475 --> 01:05:30,320
[SPEAKER_18]: The choice program is a program in which if we were to participate, we would have to take students from anywhere that wanted to come to Medford for available seats at approximately $5,000.

868
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:36,382
[SPEAKER_18]: It really doesn't work for us, so we recommend the school committee take the vote to reject school choice for the school year 2015-2016.

869
01:05:41,523 --> 01:05:45,488
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a motion of Mr. Scarpelli, seconded by Mrs. Van de Kloet.

870
01:05:46,009 --> 01:05:47,511
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Secretary, would you please call the roll?

871
01:05:47,531 --> 01:05:47,751
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

872
01:05:47,771 --> 01:05:48,372
[SPEAKER_14]: Cuno?

873
01:05:48,652 --> 01:05:48,892
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

874
01:05:48,973 --> 01:05:49,854
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Benedetto?

875
01:05:50,014 --> 01:05:50,815
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Falco?

876
01:05:50,995 --> 01:05:51,255
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

877
01:05:51,376 --> 01:05:52,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Scarpelli?

878
01:05:52,137 --> 01:05:52,317
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

879
01:05:52,337 --> 01:05:52,757
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Scariot?

880
01:05:52,797 --> 01:05:53,038
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

881
01:05:53,078 --> 01:05:53,879
[SPEAKER_14]: Mrs. Van de Kloet?

882
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

883
01:05:54,279 --> 01:05:56,562
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, six in the affirmative, one absent.

884
01:05:57,043 --> 01:05:58,384
[SPEAKER_15]: School choice has been rejected.

885
01:06:01,221 --> 01:06:04,162
[SPEAKER_15]: Next item, uh, pre-budget report mathematics.

886
01:06:04,242 --> 01:06:05,022
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Superintendent.

887
01:06:05,042 --> 01:06:11,304
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I call upon our deputy superintendent to begin the process of introducing the departments.

888
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:14,085
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be presenting pre-budget reports in this evening.

889
01:06:15,485 --> 01:06:16,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

890
01:06:16,066 --> 01:06:19,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, tonight we continue with our pre-budget reports.

891
01:06:20,167 --> 01:06:23,548
[SPEAKER_02]: We have three departments that are going to present tonight.

892
01:06:24,068 --> 01:06:29,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Mathematics, English language learners, and the health and physical education department.

893
01:06:30,643 --> 01:06:40,486
[SPEAKER_02]: And the individuals who oversee those departments have prepared their reports, and they'll be giving highlights from those reports, as well as answering your questions.

894
01:06:40,586 --> 01:06:44,107
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Carolyn Joy, our Director of Mathematics, is here tonight.

895
01:06:44,847 --> 01:06:48,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Leslie Trotter, our Coordinator for English Language Learner Department.

896
01:06:48,969 --> 01:06:49,329
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ms.

897
01:06:49,389 --> 01:06:52,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Rachel Perry, who's our lead teacher for Health Phys Ed.

898
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:57,334
[SPEAKER_02]: With Dr. Riccadeli, we'll be presenting our reports tonight.

899
01:06:58,295 --> 01:07:01,638
[SPEAKER_02]: We've organized all our reports into different categories, which you have.

900
01:07:02,338 --> 01:07:06,562
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, each report has the previous year's budget.

901
01:07:07,104 --> 01:07:09,806
[SPEAKER_02]: There is one correction on the bottom of this report.

902
01:07:09,846 --> 01:07:16,850
[SPEAKER_02]: We have changed our meeting of the whole for the principals and school improvement plans from the 11th to the 13th.

903
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:25,556
[SPEAKER_02]: So Wednesday the 13th we will have a meeting of the whole at Medford high school at which time the principals will be there to answer questions.

904
01:07:25,996 --> 01:07:29,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe you received those school improvement plans this evening.

905
01:07:29,936 --> 01:07:35,040
[SPEAKER_02]: We ask that you do read them over so that we can use our time efficiently that evening.

906
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:40,124
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, having a lot of questions for principals rather than a lengthy presentation.

907
01:07:40,164 --> 01:07:41,405
[SPEAKER_02]: So that will be on the 13th.

908
01:07:42,166 --> 01:07:44,268
[SPEAKER_02]: We will also have two other departments.

909
01:07:44,348 --> 01:07:49,892
[SPEAKER_02]: We hope to have another meeting of the whole to discuss technology as well as special education.

910
01:07:50,293 --> 01:07:54,796
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't believe we have a definite date for that at this particular point.

911
01:07:55,417 --> 01:07:59,080
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, I think we'll start with Mrs. Joy in mathematics.

912
01:08:08,225 --> 01:08:09,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, everyone.

913
01:08:09,266 --> 01:08:18,333
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to start today by giving you a little bit of a description of the program and for those people outside watching.

914
01:08:19,194 --> 01:08:27,581
[SPEAKER_05]: The mathematics program in the district supports teaching and learning of mathematics in grades kindergarten through grade 12.

915
01:08:29,042 --> 01:08:40,289
[SPEAKER_05]: The support includes supervision and evaluation of instruction across grade levels, analysis of student data, and review of the effectiveness of program materials.

916
01:08:40,889 --> 01:08:50,735
[SPEAKER_05]: The curriculum document is aligned to the 2011 Massachusetts Mathematics Curriculum Framework that is based on the Common Core State Standards.

917
01:08:51,875 --> 01:08:54,597
[SPEAKER_05]: The mathematics curriculum is standards-based.

918
01:08:55,033 --> 01:08:59,238
[SPEAKER_05]: with a shared emphasis on mathematical practice and content.

919
01:08:59,898 --> 01:09:05,684
[SPEAKER_05]: The new K-5 curriculum materials and revised report cards reflect the shift.

920
01:09:06,964 --> 01:09:16,354
[SPEAKER_05]: The middle school program has an accelerated option with a compacted grade 7 pre-algebra, followed by algebra 1 in grade 8.

921
01:09:16,994 --> 01:09:29,427
[SPEAKER_05]: And the high school program offers 11 five-credit courses at the standard college preparatory and honors levels, three advanced placement courses, and five two-credit courses.

922
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:39,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Mathematics electives include three five-credit courses in computer programming and five two-credit support and test prep courses.

923
01:09:40,658 --> 01:09:45,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Mathematics courses for special populations are aligned to the district's curriculum.

924
01:09:45,982 --> 01:09:53,528
[SPEAKER_05]: High school students are required to take and pass four years of mathematics to include a course beyond Algebra II.

925
01:09:54,509 --> 01:10:00,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Students can choose from six senior year mathematics courses to meet this new requirement.

926
01:10:00,851 --> 01:10:10,475
[SPEAKER_05]: And a proficiency score of 240 or better, as determined by the MCAS testing, is required for the attainment of a diploma.

927
01:10:11,631 --> 01:10:35,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Our primary instructional materials is the new EnVision program at the elementary schools, Connected Math Project and Big Ideas Math is in the middle schools, and Prentice Hall's program, Tools for a Changing World, and a variety of other texts for all our courses post-Algebra II.

928
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:44,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Teachers are encouraged to use supplemental resources for curriculum alignment, remediation, and enrichment.

929
01:10:45,412 --> 01:10:51,158
[SPEAKER_05]: So over the past year, we've had a lot going on, especially at the

930
01:10:52,195 --> 01:10:56,857
[SPEAKER_05]: K-5 level with the adoption of the new Envision Mathematics program.

931
01:10:57,577 --> 01:11:06,561
[SPEAKER_05]: The elementary teachers, specialists, and administrators, we all participated in year-long professional development with Pearson trainers and consultants.

932
01:11:07,181 --> 01:11:15,465
[SPEAKER_05]: The teachers are now in the process of benchmarking student learning using the Envision Math program materials.

933
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:31,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Families gain insights to the mathematic offerings and engaged in conversation at the presentation Middle School Mathematics Programs and Pathways to High School Mathematics, which we held recently.

934
01:11:31,812 --> 01:11:33,813
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a great night that we had.

935
01:11:34,934 --> 01:11:42,217
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a lot of clarification and we even had fifth grade parents wanting to know more about what's happening at the high school.

936
01:11:42,577 --> 01:11:47,520
[SPEAKER_05]: So as was said earlier, people are looking ahead to high school programs.

937
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:53,109
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be celebrating the final cohort of middle and high school teachers.

938
01:11:53,589 --> 01:12:07,614
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be graduating from the NSF grant-funded research project offered by the Poincaré Institute at Tufts University, and preliminary data shows a positive impact on student learning.

939
01:12:07,994 --> 01:12:11,015
[SPEAKER_05]: When this report comes out, I'll be able to share it with you.

940
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:17,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I've just received pieces of it, and they are showing positive trends

941
01:12:17,477 --> 01:12:31,913
[SPEAKER_05]: with students who have been taught by teachers who have gone through the program and also those schools where it exists as compared to other schools across the state because the teachers do collaborate with non-institute teachers.

942
01:12:34,756 --> 01:12:45,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Our department meetings this year focused on district and departmental goals to include social-emotional learning, student assessment, curriculum, and instruction.

943
01:12:46,183 --> 01:13:02,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Our collaboration among the mathematics, special education, and English language learning faculties is strong and includes development of common assessments at the secondary level, sharing of resources and teaching strategies.

944
01:13:03,775 --> 01:13:10,080
[SPEAKER_05]: We had common midterms developed and end-of-year assessments that are constantly in revision.

945
01:13:11,001 --> 01:13:18,228
[SPEAKER_05]: New assessments have been developed and piloted to meet the DESE's requirement for district-determined measures.

946
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:25,833
[SPEAKER_05]: And Kathy McDaglio presents her report to the committee.

947
01:13:25,853 --> 01:13:30,555
[SPEAKER_05]: She's going to talk a little bit more about how there was a great collaboration.

948
01:13:30,575 --> 01:13:36,298
[SPEAKER_05]: We had the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, their conference.

949
01:13:36,958 --> 01:13:52,071
[SPEAKER_05]: just came to Boston, it comes every six or seven years, and she was able to find a group of teachers to go out, gen ed and special ed math teachers, and they're in the process now of putting together a presentation to share with the rest of the faculty.

950
01:13:53,759 --> 01:14:01,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Our teachers are participating in training for SEI endorsement, and they implement best practices for teaching and learning.

951
01:14:02,064 --> 01:14:08,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Our Algebra I class is integrated with the vocational, technical, and high school students.

952
01:14:08,407 --> 01:14:16,511
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was a first this year where the teachers shared students from both schools, and it's working well.

953
01:14:17,151 --> 01:14:21,554
[SPEAKER_05]: And the plan is to continue next year with the geometry classes.

954
01:14:23,416 --> 01:14:29,784
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't, kids got there on time and did what they needed to do and it worked well both ways.

955
01:14:30,665 --> 01:14:38,456
[SPEAKER_05]: So two new courses, Advanced Placement Computer Science and Mathematics Decision Making were launched at the high school.

956
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:54,636
[SPEAKER_05]: We're growing that computer pathway, and it's going to be slow, but we see the excitement starting at the younger grades, so we hope to increase the participation there.

957
01:14:55,176 --> 01:14:57,619
[SPEAKER_05]: And the mathematical decision-making course

958
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:01,461
[SPEAKER_05]: has met with rave reviews.

959
01:15:01,541 --> 01:15:06,582
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got positive feedback from the students about this course.

960
01:15:06,622 --> 01:15:08,483
[SPEAKER_05]: The pedagogy is a little bit different.

961
01:15:08,543 --> 01:15:17,325
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a senior level course where the students do come in, facilitated by a teacher, and work together to solve problems.

962
01:15:17,745 --> 01:15:26,007
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's been a great program to have, and we hope that will be expanded for next year.

963
01:15:26,747 --> 01:15:38,540
[SPEAKER_05]: The high school robotics teams received continuous support from E-Day of Medford and takes the second place in the New England vault ball robotics competition.

964
01:15:39,281 --> 01:15:44,948
[SPEAKER_05]: The department collaborates with the district technology department, the vocational tech school,

965
01:15:45,568 --> 01:16:01,198
[SPEAKER_05]: community and university partners on grant-funded initiatives in coding and robotics for the middle and high school students, and courses and activities are in place to create that pipeline to the AP Computer Science.

966
01:16:02,438 --> 01:16:09,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Tufts University's new STEM Ambassadors Program comes to Medford High School.

967
01:16:09,103 --> 01:16:14,968
[SPEAKER_05]: We've already done some preliminary planning to extend that program for next year.

968
01:16:15,028 --> 01:16:16,289
[SPEAKER_05]: It's worked really well.

969
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:23,635
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was led by one of our former Medford High School graduates, which was nice.

970
01:16:25,156 --> 01:16:38,348
[SPEAKER_05]: We also had a group that participated at the university's annual presidential summit, and here we made some more connections and collaborated with university and community leaders.

971
01:16:38,828 --> 01:16:42,592
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll be hearing more next year that will be growing out of that.

972
01:16:42,632 --> 01:16:44,774
[SPEAKER_05]: We've applied for some grants together.

973
01:16:46,475 --> 01:17:06,590
[SPEAKER_05]: 17 new high school science labs open with the oversight of the physical space, the furnishings and equipment, planning for transition into the new space, professional development for safety, technology and systems, and relocating mathematics teachers back to their previous classrooms.

974
01:17:08,017 --> 01:17:17,522
[SPEAKER_05]: And our current staffing, we have 28 and a half positions in mathematics for grades six through 12.

975
01:17:17,822 --> 01:17:26,847
[SPEAKER_05]: And of the 29 teachers, 23 teachers have professional status in district and six are pre-professional teachers.

976
01:17:27,367 --> 01:17:31,309
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have the breakdown of the faculty there.

977
01:17:32,464 --> 01:17:37,626
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, these positions at the high school and vocational technical high school, they're shared.

978
01:17:38,026 --> 01:17:42,447
[SPEAKER_05]: So like we said, we have the students going back and forth between the two buildings.

979
01:17:43,347 --> 01:17:51,030
[SPEAKER_05]: And for next year, the department will make staffing projections when the enrollment figures are available.

980
01:17:51,810 --> 01:17:57,192
[SPEAKER_05]: And we will make all efforts to utilize the existing level of staffing at the high school.

981
01:17:59,322 --> 01:18:08,049
[SPEAKER_05]: The four-year mathematics graduation requirement, that began with this current graduating class.

982
01:18:09,069 --> 01:18:15,194
[SPEAKER_05]: And as we go on, we might see a need for more increased staffing as a result.

983
01:18:15,894 --> 01:18:26,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Re-instituting mathematics coaches at the elementary and middle school levels is recommended as the district implements new standards and programs.

984
01:18:27,122 --> 01:18:32,104
[SPEAKER_05]: The programs that are coming into the schools are quite different from what we had before.

985
01:18:32,844 --> 01:18:39,047
[SPEAKER_05]: And any extra training or support that we can have for the elementary teachers is welcome.

986
01:18:41,176 --> 01:18:50,061
[SPEAKER_05]: The funding that was given this past year went to textbooks, instructional supplies, and office supplies.

987
01:18:50,081 --> 01:19:02,009
[SPEAKER_05]: As you can see, as you read through, we did need to fund the new AB computer science and more mathematics courses to meet that four-year requirement.

988
01:19:07,712 --> 01:19:15,201
[SPEAKER_05]: And what becomes a continued expense is purchase of calculators and batteries every year.

989
01:19:15,881 --> 01:19:24,551
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just that now we're looking at generations and what the life is of these calculators.

990
01:19:25,471 --> 01:19:45,097
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're looking at like 15 year marks, so now we're starting to replace, as well as we're making sure that everybody at the secondary level, especially grades eight on up, have graphing calculators, whether they're in gen ed, special ed, and ELL.

991
01:19:48,018 --> 01:19:55,144
[SPEAKER_05]: So that we continue to purchase those supplies, and with that comes the need for the batteries.

992
01:19:56,565 --> 01:20:10,895
[SPEAKER_05]: So for next year, our non-salary funding needs for the textbooks, what I would like to do is be able to purchase one classroom set of the new Envision program for each grade level.

993
01:20:11,456 --> 01:20:16,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the numbers of students at each grade, it fluctuates.

994
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:20,123
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't have any spare kits.

995
01:20:20,684 --> 01:20:27,891
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would be like outfitting a classroom for 20 to 25 students and one teacher at each grade level.

996
01:20:27,931 --> 01:20:30,613
[SPEAKER_05]: That would come to approximately $6,000 or $1,000 per grade.

997
01:20:35,352 --> 01:20:41,498
[SPEAKER_05]: And then funded as last year would be reminding of books.

998
01:20:41,959 --> 01:20:46,323
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have old textbooks, especially at the high school level.

999
01:20:46,343 --> 01:20:49,847
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not ready to do a purchase just yet.

1000
01:20:51,669 --> 01:20:57,275
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, we might need to because of the fluctuations in enrollments.

1001
01:20:57,899 --> 01:21:10,264
[SPEAKER_05]: and the kinds of programs that we're offering outside of the general ed population and also for the vocational school, we want to be able to support any of their programming needs.

1002
01:21:11,144 --> 01:21:23,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Instructional supplies, again, level funded as funded this year for those typical supplies as the calculators and also the teaching supplies.

1003
01:21:24,450 --> 01:21:27,151
[SPEAKER_05]: But of us that we purchase,

1004
01:21:27,992 --> 01:21:33,399
[SPEAKER_05]: some document cameras for the classrooms.

1005
01:21:33,519 --> 01:21:38,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Some teachers have gone out and purchased them on their own for their classroom because it's such a useful tool.

1006
01:21:39,105 --> 01:21:41,929
[SPEAKER_05]: At Andrews Middle School,

1007
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:49,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Principal DeLava, he has purchased them for a good number of the mathematics classrooms.

1008
01:21:49,657 --> 01:21:55,318
[SPEAKER_05]: They're very, very useful, not for just only the teacher, but for the students.

1009
01:21:55,798 --> 01:21:58,399
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a way for them to project student work.

1010
01:21:59,499 --> 01:22:08,081
[SPEAKER_05]: It's invaluable for special educators when you want a model in 3D, you can actually put a 3D model under the camera.

1011
01:22:08,581 --> 01:22:11,423
[SPEAKER_05]: and use the projection system that we have in place.

1012
01:22:12,064 --> 01:22:22,952
[SPEAKER_05]: So this will not be the quality as those that we purchased for the science labs, but it should be something that we would be able to maintain for years to come.

1013
01:22:23,753 --> 01:22:32,500
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'd like you to consider that change and then the office supplies funded as in prior years.

1014
01:22:33,970 --> 01:22:54,586
[SPEAKER_05]: So the vision for the department is that all students be college and career ready through the implementation of a well-articulated mathematics curriculum and for the community to provide support for the tools and the professional development necessary to fulfill that vision.

1015
01:22:55,446 --> 01:22:59,812
[SPEAKER_05]: So, some of the examples of long-term activities.

1016
01:23:00,452 --> 01:23:06,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, our curriculum committee will be working to develop model curriculum units.

1017
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:08,342
[SPEAKER_05]: They've already started that.

1018
01:23:08,402 --> 01:23:10,805
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been many teachers' goals to do that.

1019
01:23:11,305 --> 01:23:13,548
[SPEAKER_05]: as part of the evaluation process.

1020
01:23:14,028 --> 01:23:21,817
[SPEAKER_05]: They did piloting of district-determined measures that they developed this year, and that will be ongoing.

1021
01:23:22,177 --> 01:23:29,345
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're beginning to develop a new scope and sequence based on the Common Core curriculum, which is our new framework.

1022
01:23:30,978 --> 01:23:37,043
[SPEAKER_05]: We're looking for support restructuring at the elementary level to strengthen mathematics instruction.

1023
01:23:37,083 --> 01:23:49,194
[SPEAKER_05]: And that support could come from outside programs, after school, summer, and also in school with the coaching piece.

1024
01:23:50,094 --> 01:23:58,181
[SPEAKER_05]: A commitment by the school committee, I look to you for a new program in grade six through algebra two.

1025
01:23:59,382 --> 01:24:02,065
[SPEAKER_05]: And this will come at a substantial cost.

1026
01:24:02,685 --> 01:24:10,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now we have a segment of the middle school using new materials, piloting programs.

1027
01:24:10,592 --> 01:24:20,761
[SPEAKER_05]: We have textbook committees now developing again, where rather than piloting, publishers have sent me some examination copies.

1028
01:24:21,321 --> 01:24:35,350
[SPEAKER_05]: and we're actually going to go through them starting in June and through the summer and hopefully by February we'll have some titles for you to look at and consider for purchase.

1029
01:24:36,455 --> 01:24:57,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, mathematics coaches at the elementary and middle schools to provide ongoing professional development in implementing these new standards and participate in developing a K through 12 science and technology engineering curriculum that aligns to the mathematics program.

1030
01:24:59,236 --> 01:25:15,721
[SPEAKER_05]: The new standards have not been adopted yet, but once they are, we will be seeing the connections between the two, because the preliminary documents do articulate what students need to know in mathematics to be able to do science.

1031
01:25:17,422 --> 01:25:20,383
[SPEAKER_05]: And here is a list of some of the goals.

1032
01:25:20,983 --> 01:25:26,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, go along with those long-term plans for the department.

1033
01:25:28,141 --> 01:25:30,843
[SPEAKER_07]: I have two questions.

1034
01:25:30,863 --> 01:25:33,405
[SPEAKER_07]: One, the document camera, I don't exactly understand what that is.

1035
01:25:33,445 --> 01:25:33,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1036
01:25:33,605 --> 01:25:36,767
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a freestanding device that can be put on a table that hooks up to the computer.

1037
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:57,804
[SPEAKER_05]: And also your LCD projector.

1038
01:25:58,204 --> 01:26:01,649
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can put an item underneath and it will project.

1039
01:26:02,029 --> 01:26:12,463
[SPEAKER_05]: So the students could actually, if they're working together in group work, and they have something that they want to present to the class, they can just put a piece of paper underneath this camera.

1040
01:26:13,003 --> 01:26:15,105
[SPEAKER_05]: And it will project the student work.

1041
01:26:15,485 --> 01:26:24,451
[SPEAKER_05]: So we find that it works well with those students who are not confident to go up to a board and write, that they might feel more comfortable bringing a piece of paper up.

1042
01:26:25,051 --> 01:26:28,293
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also, it helps with the modeling.

1043
01:26:29,014 --> 01:26:32,216
[SPEAKER_05]: And the teachers find that it saves a lot of time.

1044
01:26:32,636 --> 01:26:35,378
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of these programs, you really need

1045
01:26:36,018 --> 01:26:37,919
[SPEAKER_05]: an hour to implement that.

1046
01:26:37,979 --> 01:26:42,362
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you have the right tools, it's going to help you cut corners in time.

1047
01:26:42,942 --> 01:26:56,409
[SPEAKER_05]: So that piece of technology and seeing the teachers use it at the Andrews Middle School and a couple of teachers who bought their own at the high school, I think would be a worthwhile investment.

1048
01:26:56,709 --> 01:27:00,453
[SPEAKER_05]: And are they, how many of them, how much do they cost?

1049
01:27:00,673 --> 01:27:01,875
[SPEAKER_05]: They're about $300 a piece.

1050
01:27:01,995 --> 01:27:02,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1051
01:27:03,536 --> 01:27:17,051
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, but I would work with the vendor to see how many we could get so that I would start with the higher grades first because the elementary program have a lot of pieces right now that are online.

1052
01:27:17,731 --> 01:27:22,515
[SPEAKER_05]: So through their program, it's a little bit different from what the middle and the high school have.

1053
01:27:22,715 --> 01:27:24,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Do many different companies make them?

1054
01:27:24,496 --> 01:27:24,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1055
01:27:24,796 --> 01:27:25,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1056
01:27:25,937 --> 01:27:37,125
[SPEAKER_07]: The second just comment I wanted to make, and this is totally about my places right now, okay, but down in your goals, one of your goals is increase MCAS performance by three percentage points.

1057
01:27:37,725 --> 01:27:40,867
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be much more comfortable if you identified

1058
01:27:42,288 --> 01:27:53,874
[SPEAKER_07]: increase the geometry strand or pick out two or three different strands and say further students' knowledge of these particular stands rather than saying increase it overall by three points.

1059
01:27:54,034 --> 01:27:58,196
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is about my feeling about the testing and if we change, whatever.

1060
01:27:58,216 --> 01:28:03,959
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't want people looking at our paperwork and saying, well, you know, we're driven by the test.

1061
01:28:04,459 --> 01:28:06,660
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to be driven by the subject.

1062
01:28:07,081 --> 01:28:07,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1063
01:28:07,921 --> 01:28:11,383
[SPEAKER_05]: What happens is every year after the data is released,

1064
01:28:11,843 --> 01:28:15,526
[SPEAKER_05]: We meet as a department and we go over the data.

1065
01:28:16,007 --> 01:28:23,853
[SPEAKER_05]: The elementary principals go over their data for their school, I go over with the middle, and the high school teachers, we actually go through the item analysis.

1066
01:28:24,514 --> 01:28:31,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just for their building or grade, but they all walk away with the item analysis for the students they teach.

1067
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:35,262
[SPEAKER_05]: So they drill down what they need to focus on.

1068
01:28:35,422 --> 01:28:37,304
[SPEAKER_07]: So I understand that this is a shorthand.

1069
01:28:37,324 --> 01:28:37,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.

1070
01:28:38,004 --> 01:28:40,806
[SPEAKER_07]: But unfortunately, it's an uncomfortable shorthand.

1071
01:28:40,866 --> 01:28:42,947
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the overall piece of it, sure.

1072
01:28:42,967 --> 01:28:43,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1073
01:28:43,708 --> 01:28:45,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to approve.

1074
01:28:45,909 --> 01:28:46,390
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other questions?

1075
01:28:48,211 --> 01:28:48,651
[SPEAKER_15]: If I may.

1076
01:28:48,851 --> 01:28:50,733
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to accept the paper, please, on file.

1077
01:28:50,773 --> 01:28:50,953
[SPEAKER_15]: Second.

1078
01:28:50,993 --> 01:28:54,615
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, on the motion of Mrs. Carey to accept the paper, please, on file.

1079
01:28:55,616 --> 01:28:56,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Mrs. D. Benedetto.

1080
01:28:57,137 --> 01:28:58,198
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a couple of quick questions.

1081
01:28:58,258 --> 01:28:58,738
[SPEAKER_15]: Two.

1082
01:28:58,858 --> 01:28:59,779
[SPEAKER_15]: In Visions.

1083
01:29:00,459 --> 01:29:00,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1084
01:29:02,368 --> 01:29:05,531
[SPEAKER_15]: Has every teacher been trained that's in the K-5?

1085
01:29:06,411 --> 01:29:06,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1086
01:29:06,772 --> 01:29:17,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody who's in the K-5 have received the training along with a lot of the principals participated in the training, assistant principals.

1087
01:29:18,261 --> 01:29:27,869
[SPEAKER_05]: I know our assistant superintendent, Diane Caldwell, attended many of the trainings as I did so that we're all pretty well versed in it.

1088
01:29:28,490 --> 01:29:30,812
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the first year of implementation.

1089
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:43,074
[SPEAKER_05]: So it will take teachers a little while getting used to how to use the materials to the best, but they had three separate trainings during the school year.

1090
01:29:43,134 --> 01:29:50,896
[SPEAKER_05]: They had one during the summer that was optional for teachers who wanted to come in, but those other three had different focuses.

1091
01:29:51,996 --> 01:30:00,938
[SPEAKER_05]: One was on seeing lessons modeled for the grade level, but all the way down to how to use the technology that goes with the program.

1092
01:30:01,778 --> 01:30:02,659
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's my next question.

1093
01:30:02,699 --> 01:30:09,264
[SPEAKER_15]: The technology that goes with the program, from what I remember, there was an online component that you could use at home.

1094
01:30:09,284 --> 01:30:10,325
[SPEAKER_15]: Am I correct?

1095
01:30:10,505 --> 01:30:10,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1096
01:30:10,825 --> 01:30:15,609
[SPEAKER_15]: So do the parents or have the students been given all of their login information to use that?

1097
01:30:16,149 --> 01:30:18,211
[SPEAKER_05]: All the students should have their login.

1098
01:30:18,251 --> 01:30:23,334
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was done, and it was centralized here at the high school with the data team.

1099
01:30:23,775 --> 01:30:27,898
[SPEAKER_05]: They were able to work with Pearson so that this

1100
01:30:29,158 --> 01:30:33,421
[SPEAKER_05]: The passwords that they have, they can use year after year.

1101
01:30:34,021 --> 01:30:37,283
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll just move with them as they move up through the grade.

1102
01:30:37,303 --> 01:30:39,324
[SPEAKER_05]: So once they're in the system, they're there.

1103
01:30:39,805 --> 01:30:43,927
[SPEAKER_15]: If a parent needs login information, do they contact the classroom teacher?

1104
01:30:44,467 --> 01:30:44,708
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1105
01:30:46,429 --> 01:30:53,755
[SPEAKER_15]: Last but not least, you had mentioned under textbooks about funding one classroom, set up K-5 divisions.

1106
01:30:54,235 --> 01:30:56,397
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that for a particular school or is that spread?

1107
01:30:56,678 --> 01:31:01,562
[SPEAKER_05]: That's spread out just so that as the enrollments change,

1108
01:31:02,042 --> 01:31:13,246
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, some year you might need an extra third grade because they've moved up and we have that second grade set sitting there because maybe the second grade is smaller.

1109
01:31:13,266 --> 01:31:16,707
[SPEAKER_21]: Diane might speak a little bit more to the enrollment piece.

1110
01:31:16,967 --> 01:31:20,568
[SPEAKER_21]: So currently over at the Roberts, excuse me, elementary school, we have

1111
01:31:21,308 --> 01:31:24,511
[SPEAKER_21]: 5 grade 1s who will be going into 5 grade 2s.

1112
01:31:25,272 --> 01:31:29,756
[SPEAKER_21]: If we look at the Columbus, we are looking at a possible extra 3rd or 5th grade.

1113
01:31:30,296 --> 01:31:31,397
[SPEAKER_21]: The Brooks, a 4th.

1114
01:31:31,938 --> 01:31:35,080
[SPEAKER_21]: And at the McGlynn, we have 5 Ks that will go into 5 1s.

1115
01:31:36,201 --> 01:31:40,285
[SPEAKER_21]: So we don't yet have all the materials yet, so that's what Carolyn is referring to.

1116
01:31:40,305 --> 01:31:40,985
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, perfect.

1117
01:31:41,005 --> 01:31:42,407
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1118
01:31:42,427 --> 01:31:43,027
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other questions?

1119
01:31:45,070 --> 01:31:45,911
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. Cuno.

1120
01:31:46,652 --> 01:31:47,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1121
01:31:47,633 --> 01:31:53,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to go back to the goals of raising 3%, are we going to

1122
01:31:59,127 --> 01:32:03,468
[SPEAKER_11]: provide maybe more tutoring after school next year for students?

1123
01:32:05,189 --> 01:32:16,312
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, not only stay after their particular teacher, but actual programs after school that students could take, not necessarily just students that are not doing well in math, but in general?

1124
01:32:17,333 --> 01:32:20,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, the funding that we have, it's grant funded.

1125
01:32:21,174 --> 01:32:23,635
[SPEAKER_05]: And students have to meet certain criteria.

1126
01:32:24,855 --> 01:32:31,217
[SPEAKER_05]: for that program, and it's at the high school where it's the high stakes testing for grade 10.

1127
01:32:32,377 --> 01:32:37,379
[SPEAKER_05]: We offer other programs during the year.

1128
01:32:37,479 --> 01:32:40,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them are after school programs.

1129
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:43,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Some are almost like a camp-like atmosphere.

1130
01:32:43,721 --> 01:32:47,202
[SPEAKER_05]: We had one teacher who's, she's currently now teaching

1131
01:32:48,242 --> 01:32:57,408
[SPEAKER_05]: some MCAS review on Saturdays for students, but those are students who are identified and meet the criteria of the grant.

1132
01:32:58,048 --> 01:33:02,451
[SPEAKER_05]: So we try to do as much as we can through the classroom teachers.

1133
01:33:03,071 --> 01:33:08,675
[SPEAKER_05]: I did have a parent inquiry and asked, is there a teacher who was doing anything?

1134
01:33:09,635 --> 01:33:15,600
[SPEAKER_05]: That name will be passed on to the parents of the student if they want to go there.

1135
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:26,188
[SPEAKER_05]: But a lot of the teachers use the questions as openers every day that you'll see the MCAS or MCAS-like questions being posed.

1136
01:33:26,849 --> 01:33:34,375
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are no definite plans of having anything structured because the funding isn't there for it.

1137
01:33:34,875 --> 01:33:45,799
[SPEAKER_11]: What about if, I mean, I haven't gotten a statistic or anything, but I do hear parents say that sometimes they've taken their middle school students to a private tutor.

1138
01:33:46,319 --> 01:33:58,024
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was just thinking, is it possible maybe to do something in the middle school, target middle school students that parents are willing to pay, but instead of going all over the place, dropping off, picking up.

1139
01:33:58,924 --> 01:34:03,426
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we utilize the students at Tufts University, and we have a great program there.

1140
01:34:03,806 --> 01:34:10,728
[SPEAKER_11]: But I also do know that parents are willing to pay for tutors, but I don't know if we ever offer those types of services.

1141
01:34:11,748 --> 01:34:23,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we want to avoid any conflict of interest where the teachers are getting paid for what they're contracted to do anyway, with the extra classes.

1142
01:34:25,231 --> 01:34:30,874
[SPEAKER_05]: meetings that they have with students contractually for the extra support after school.

1143
01:34:31,314 --> 01:34:41,539
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not unusual for a teacher to take on students that are not their own and that just come in and want to sit in on a test prep situation.

1144
01:34:42,019 --> 01:34:47,662
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have at the middle school, again built into the program,

1145
01:34:48,502 --> 01:35:05,917
[SPEAKER_05]: We have, at the Andrews, we have a math lab set up, and all the students go through there, and it's more intense for those students who have been identified with the testing piece that Mr. DeLaver has put in place.

1146
01:35:06,518 --> 01:35:11,002
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at the high school, we offer mini courses in MCAS prep.

1147
01:35:11,742 --> 01:35:22,149
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do have quite a bit out there, but sometimes the students overschedule themselves, and it's just not the right time or the right place for it.

1148
01:35:22,630 --> 01:35:27,433
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would be happy to investigate further if that's something we could do.

1149
01:35:28,554 --> 01:35:29,614
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just for the students.

1150
01:35:29,634 --> 01:35:32,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, like I said, it's not necessarily just for always targeting the MCAS.

1151
01:35:32,836 --> 01:35:33,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1152
01:35:33,157 --> 01:35:37,540
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just to get more information on the mathematics itself.

1153
01:35:38,981 --> 01:35:40,321
[SPEAKER_11]: But you brought up a point.

1154
01:35:41,587 --> 01:35:49,130
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I know that, I'm not just saying Medford teachers, but I know teachers in general, no matter what city you work, some teachers have part-time jobs.

1155
01:35:49,150 --> 01:36:02,816
[SPEAKER_11]: So are you saying that if a teacher in Medford has a Medford, not necessarily their student, but has a Medford student, and they're tutoring like after school or something, that's conflict of interest?

1156
01:36:03,076 --> 01:36:04,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I would just be careful.

1157
01:36:04,297 --> 01:36:06,778
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be careful.

1158
01:36:06,858 --> 01:36:08,519
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's for a paid position.

1159
01:36:10,998 --> 01:36:14,520
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never encouraged teachers to do something like that for pay.

1160
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:18,742
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's OK for them to do it, let's say, for a student that's outside of the city.

1161
01:36:18,762 --> 01:36:19,683
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be better?

1162
01:36:19,703 --> 01:36:21,844
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, because then I'd pull the check.

1163
01:36:21,904 --> 01:36:24,005
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just curious in the conflict of interest thing.

1164
01:36:24,085 --> 01:36:25,825
[SPEAKER_11]: I hadn't heard that one before.

1165
01:36:25,886 --> 01:36:29,027
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, thank you.

1166
01:36:29,167 --> 01:36:32,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other questions?

1167
01:36:33,849 --> 01:36:33,969
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1168
01:36:34,009 --> 01:36:34,970
[SPEAKER_15]: And the motion was too scary.

1169
01:36:34,990 --> 01:36:40,115
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Mrs D Benedetto that the pre-budget report on mathematics be accepted in place on file.

1170
01:36:40,135 --> 01:36:40,936
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor.

1171
01:36:40,976 --> 01:36:41,617
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed.

1172
01:36:42,197 --> 01:36:43,899
[SPEAKER_15]: The report is accepted in place on file.

1173
01:36:43,919 --> 01:36:44,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1174
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:44,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1175
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:45,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1176
01:36:47,623 --> 01:36:49,084
[SPEAKER_15]: Next item is the health.

1177
01:36:49,365 --> 01:36:49,785
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

1178
01:36:49,805 --> 01:36:53,229
[SPEAKER_15]: The pre-budget report on health and physical education.

1179
01:36:53,249 --> 01:36:57,293
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Superintendent bring up Rachel Berry to make that motion.

1180
01:36:59,401 --> 01:37:06,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to say before Rachel speaks that she's just been doing a tremendous job as our lead teacher, also teaching full time.

1181
01:37:07,410 --> 01:37:11,034
[SPEAKER_02]: So she has a lot on her plate and she's just stepped right up and done a wonderful job.

1182
01:37:11,415 --> 01:37:11,875
[SPEAKER_02]: So Rachel.

1183
01:37:14,558 --> 01:37:16,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, Superintendent Belson, members of the school committee.

1184
01:37:21,013 --> 01:37:32,555
[SPEAKER_03]: The goal of the Physical Education and Health Department of Method Public Schools is to enhance the well-being of the school community by creating a culture that integrates and balances the six dimensions of wellness.

1185
01:37:33,355 --> 01:37:38,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Social, physical, intellectual, occupational, emotional, and spiritual.

1186
01:37:38,756 --> 01:37:45,517
[SPEAKER_03]: The department strives to encourage an active, healthy lifestyle, healthy decision-making, and lifelong commitment to wellness.

1187
01:37:46,999 --> 01:37:48,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the department is in really two parts.

1188
01:37:48,841 --> 01:37:51,224
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the physical education and the health education.

1189
01:37:51,944 --> 01:38:04,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting with physical education in elementary schools, our goal is to teach basic skills and concepts that will enable students to participate in a wide variety of physical activities with success and enjoyment.

1190
01:38:04,937 --> 01:38:10,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Basic skills are learned and then applied to a wide variety of games, dance, gymnastics, and fitness activities.

1191
01:38:11,486 --> 01:38:16,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on from elementary physical education, our students move on to middle school physical education.

1192
01:38:18,069 --> 01:38:28,239
[SPEAKER_03]: In the middle school physical education program, built upon the knowledge and skills that they learned in elementary school, we make it a little bit more advanced so they're learning more advanced skills and concepts.

1193
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:35,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving from middle school to high school, the high school program continues to build on these concepts and knowledge and skills.

1194
01:38:36,787 --> 01:38:40,131
[SPEAKER_03]: In freshman and sophomore physical education,

1195
01:38:41,289 --> 01:38:51,518
[SPEAKER_03]: is fitness-based and allows students to learn about the five components of fitness, fitness testing, how to improve our fitness, and how to set up their own fitness routines.

1196
01:38:52,278 --> 01:39:00,045
[SPEAKER_03]: As juniors and seniors, the physical education program is a choice-based program, and our students choose their classes based on their interests.

1197
01:39:00,646 --> 01:39:06,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the classes that we have for our juniors and seniors are first aid and CPR class, and that is for certification in both.

1198
01:39:07,745 --> 01:39:13,930
[SPEAKER_03]: net games, dance, team sports, fitness, wellness activities, and yoga.

1199
01:39:15,251 --> 01:39:24,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on to the health education, at our elementaries, we have a second step health curriculum at the elementary level, and that is taught by classroom teachers.

1200
01:39:24,698 --> 01:39:26,880
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have dedicated health teachers at that level.

1201
01:39:28,081 --> 01:39:30,723
[SPEAKER_03]: At the middle school, for many years we used second step.

1202
01:39:31,873 --> 01:39:32,913
[SPEAKER_03]: as our health curriculum.

1203
01:39:33,394 --> 01:39:44,877
[SPEAKER_03]: And many teachers and administrators thought that second step is developmentally appropriate, but that it's not addressing the health issues that we're seeing today for our students.

1204
01:39:45,778 --> 01:39:52,280
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we did is we started to pilot the Michigan model at the middle schools at both the McGlynn and at the Andrews.

1205
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:56,301
[SPEAKER_03]: The Michigan model is its second year of use at the high school.

1206
01:39:56,441 --> 01:40:01,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Having it at the middle school will help add continuity to the health education program.

1207
01:40:02,323 --> 01:40:08,644
[SPEAKER_03]: In the middle school, the guidance counselors and the physical education health teachers are covering the curriculum there.

1208
01:40:10,925 --> 01:40:16,345
[SPEAKER_03]: At the high school level, we are also using the Michigan model for 9th through 12th grade students.

1209
01:40:16,766 --> 01:40:20,226
[SPEAKER_03]: They have health for half the year and they have physical education for half the year.

1210
01:40:21,086 --> 01:40:23,887
[SPEAKER_03]: The Michigan model is the skills-based curriculum.

1211
01:40:25,567 --> 01:40:30,448
[SPEAKER_03]: It's student-centered and it gives students skills needed to help make healthy decisions.

1212
01:40:31,368 --> 01:40:34,410
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have two teachers teaching health at the high school right now.

1213
01:40:35,970 --> 01:40:38,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on to the highlights for this year.

1214
01:40:39,432 --> 01:40:50,758
[SPEAKER_03]: I've collaborated with the guidance department in the alignment of the guidance and health curriculum to the Michigan model, because the guidance councils and the health or physical education teachers will be teaching the Michigan model.

1215
01:40:51,159 --> 01:40:53,880
[SPEAKER_03]: We've piloted the Michigan model at the middle schools.

1216
01:40:55,441 --> 01:40:59,163
[SPEAKER_03]: We received the Department of Conservation and Recreation grant at Medford High School.

1217
01:40:59,795 --> 01:41:12,621
[SPEAKER_03]: And Matt Galussi actually received that grant, where they're going into the woods and setting up paths in the woods, and they're marking the paths so that we can use them for hiking during our physical education classes.

1218
01:41:12,801 --> 01:41:17,543
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are also a number of classroom teachers that are going out and using those paths as well.

1219
01:41:19,911 --> 01:41:25,492
[SPEAKER_03]: We have successfully integrated vocational freshman students into our high school physical education classes.

1220
01:41:26,012 --> 01:41:27,613
[SPEAKER_03]: In the past, they have been separated.

1221
01:41:28,093 --> 01:41:29,813
[SPEAKER_03]: This year, we integrated the freshmen.

1222
01:41:30,253 --> 01:41:32,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Next year, we will be integrating the sophomores.

1223
01:41:35,035 --> 01:41:43,256
[SPEAKER_03]: We have collaborated with the guidance department in scheduling the 2015-2016 junior and senior choice classes via I-PASS.

1224
01:41:43,276 --> 01:41:45,637
[SPEAKER_03]: In the past, I've had to do it by hand.

1225
01:41:46,279 --> 01:41:54,864
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would have our juniors and seniors choose what classes they wanted when they were in their health classes, and then I'd have to go through them and place them based on what they chose.

1226
01:41:55,644 --> 01:42:00,067
[SPEAKER_03]: So this year we were actually able to do that via I-PASS when they were choosing their classes.

1227
01:42:01,187 --> 01:42:06,370
[SPEAKER_03]: We collaborated with Tufts University students in presenting health and wellness workshops to our high school students.

1228
01:42:06,911 --> 01:42:10,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of those workshops included nutrition, fitness, and stress management.

1229
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:21,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Collaborated with Team Medfit in ordering drug and alcohol educational videos for the middle school and the high school that will actually help complement the Michigan model materials.

1230
01:42:21,809 --> 01:42:26,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of those videos also include some of the things that we're seeing coming up.

1231
01:42:26,593 --> 01:42:30,416
[SPEAKER_03]: For instance, the vaping issue that we're seeing, we did get a video on that.

1232
01:42:30,617 --> 01:42:36,342
[SPEAKER_03]: We also got a really good video, educational video on the teen brain and what happens when they are using drugs and alcohol.

1233
01:42:37,995 --> 01:42:44,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Two members of the physical education and health department attended the MIAA drug and alcohol education workshop in March.

1234
01:42:44,748 --> 01:42:50,118
[SPEAKER_03]: We were able to take away some really good information that will help us and add to our program.

1235
01:42:52,495 --> 01:43:01,760
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually participated in the design and delivery of the workshop related to the social emotional initiative for the November professional development day for teachers.

1236
01:43:02,481 --> 01:43:04,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Two of our health teachers did as well.

1237
01:43:05,062 --> 01:43:15,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Ashley McDonald and Dan Georgette actually did some team building activities with the teachers to help them learn about problem solving, things like that, things that they could actually bring back to their students.

1238
01:43:16,789 --> 01:43:20,351
[SPEAKER_03]: I presented yoga, where we did some breathing exercises.

1239
01:43:20,811 --> 01:43:21,992
[SPEAKER_03]: I presented with Liz Dineu.

1240
01:43:22,697 --> 01:43:28,264
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a few yoga poses and we did a progressive muscle relaxation and a visualization.

1241
01:43:29,005 --> 01:43:34,612
[SPEAKER_03]: So that actually, we brought the teachers in in three different portions and they were able to experience that.

1242
01:43:36,057 --> 01:43:42,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing that we did is we did a yoga video, and that was myself, Liz Dineu, and Lisa Dunphy.

1243
01:43:43,798 --> 01:43:49,899
[SPEAKER_03]: And we shot the video, and then we were able to actually show it in advisory for all of our junior students.

1244
01:43:49,919 --> 01:43:51,820
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were able to participate in yoga.

1245
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:59,041
[SPEAKER_03]: It was relaxation breathing and another relaxation portion at the end with some more poses.

1246
01:43:59,581 --> 01:44:03,982
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was about 10 minutes long, and a lot of students did that before school.

1247
01:44:04,842 --> 01:44:10,184
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were so many students that came back to us and said, I had the best day after we did that.

1248
01:44:10,484 --> 01:44:11,744
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was really successful.

1249
01:44:13,325 --> 01:44:23,108
[SPEAKER_03]: In 2014 and 15 expenditures in physical education, we purchased office supplies, we maintained equipment, and purchased instructional supplies.

1250
01:44:24,769 --> 01:44:33,592
[SPEAKER_03]: The health expenditures, we purchased office supplies, we purchased the Michigan model curriculum for middle schools, and we did professional development conferences.

1251
01:44:34,752 --> 01:44:39,401
[SPEAKER_03]: of fitness center expenditures included the after school fitness center supervision.

1252
01:44:41,605 --> 01:44:43,810
[SPEAKER_03]: We presently have 16.5 positions in the department.

1253
01:44:46,835 --> 01:44:57,417
[SPEAKER_03]: For next year anticipated staffing needs, we are in need of a 1.0 adaptive physical education teacher to meet the needs of the special education students across the district.

1254
01:44:58,317 --> 01:45:08,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I've met with Kathy Medaglio, and she advised me that there are students in need of special adaptive physical education.

1255
01:45:08,459 --> 01:45:15,860
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have some students that can go into the general education, physical education classes, but we do have a number that need adaptive

1256
01:45:16,893 --> 01:45:18,727
[SPEAKER_03]: classes and that number is growing.

1257
01:45:21,018 --> 01:45:29,725
[SPEAKER_03]: We also need a 0.5 middle school physical education health teacher at the Andrews Middle School to help align the physical education and health schedules of both middle schools.

1258
01:45:30,506 --> 01:45:32,828
[SPEAKER_03]: We piloted the Michigan model this year.

1259
01:45:32,848 --> 01:45:38,893
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we saw is the McGlynn had 2.5 teachers and the Andrews only two.

1260
01:45:39,333 --> 01:45:44,778
[SPEAKER_03]: So what was happening is the McGlynn was able to cover more of the Michigan model where the Andrews could not.

1261
01:45:45,098 --> 01:45:49,502
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'd like to add another 0.5 there so that we have really both middle schools

1262
01:45:50,202 --> 01:45:50,863
[SPEAKER_03]: on the same ground.

1263
01:45:52,124 --> 01:46:02,071
[SPEAKER_03]: The last one there is 1.0 health education teacher to assist the teachers with implementation of the health curriculum at the elementary level.

1264
01:46:02,512 --> 01:46:09,377
[SPEAKER_03]: They're presently teaching second step, but we're seeing a lot of anxiety and emotional issues at the elementary school.

1265
01:46:09,657 --> 01:46:17,223
[SPEAKER_03]: We're looking to add one teacher that could possibly help our classroom teachers with presenting the health curriculum

1266
01:46:17,690 --> 01:46:20,091
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe model some lessons and help them out on that.

1267
01:46:21,572 --> 01:46:23,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Long-term development needs and direction.

1268
01:46:24,794 --> 01:46:29,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Continue to add electives to the junior and senior physical education choice program.

1269
01:46:29,577 --> 01:46:34,940
[SPEAKER_03]: That will include swimming, so we can utilize the beautiful swimming pool that just recently opened this year.

1270
01:46:35,681 --> 01:46:38,002
[SPEAKER_03]: I would also like to add a yoga two.

1271
01:46:38,182 --> 01:46:44,906
[SPEAKER_03]: We have yoga one, and kids really do enjoy it, so really build on that to make it a little bit more advanced.

1272
01:46:46,097 --> 01:47:03,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I also would like to add some courses like Introduction to Teaching Physical Education, where our students can actually come in, learn how to teach, learn how to write lessons, and then use that and teach to our preschool children at the high school.

1273
01:47:04,258 --> 01:47:10,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I would also like to incorporate introduction to coaching, introduction to athletic training, and introduction to fitness.

1274
01:47:10,781 --> 01:47:13,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would give our students a really good basis.

1275
01:47:13,362 --> 01:47:21,586
[SPEAKER_03]: They might be thinking of going to college for one of those things and they can get some of that experience at the high school level and move on from there.

1276
01:47:21,606 --> 01:47:24,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to increase the

1277
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:35,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Health education staffing by 2.5 to incorporate the Michigan model at each elementary school, increase instruction at the middle school, and provide support for our special education students.

1278
01:47:36,824 --> 01:47:44,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Provide professional development in physical education and health content for K-12 physical education and health teachers.

1279
01:47:45,047 --> 01:47:50,469
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things I'd like to incorporate is professional development for adaptive physical education.

1280
01:47:50,889 --> 01:47:53,230
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one thing when we're in our

1281
01:47:54,173 --> 01:47:57,735
[SPEAKER_03]: degree programs, you might have a class, but that's all you get.

1282
01:47:57,795 --> 01:47:59,235
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get anything in between.

1283
01:47:59,255 --> 01:48:08,039
[SPEAKER_03]: I really think that for all of our teachers, we need to really take a look at that adaptive physical education and take some more courses on that.

1284
01:48:08,059 --> 01:48:16,703
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to complete piloting of the Michigan model at the middle school and explore its use at the elementary level.

1285
01:48:18,077 --> 01:48:27,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Continue to update physical education instructional equipment, purchasing basketballs, footballs, different things that we need to be able to teach our classes.

1286
01:48:27,561 --> 01:48:31,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Those things do wear out yearly, so we do need to continue to replace those.

1287
01:48:33,503 --> 01:48:42,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Continue to keep up to date on physical education and health education standards to keep up with what's going on in the field.

1288
01:48:43,588 --> 01:48:53,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Continue to collaborate the guidance department on the Michigan model health curriculum to make any changes that we need to make sure that we're working together and we're covering all aspects of the Michigan model.

1289
01:48:54,837 --> 01:49:02,142
[SPEAKER_03]: And the last one, improve the middle school schedule to afford all students the same amount of time in physical education and health.

1290
01:49:02,182 --> 01:49:08,727
[SPEAKER_03]: We really want to make sure that both middle schools are getting equal amount of time and I'd like to work with both principals on doing that.

1291
01:49:18,483 --> 01:49:21,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Goals and objectives for 2015 and 16.

1292
01:49:22,046 --> 01:49:35,635
[SPEAKER_03]: By June 2016, the Medford Public Schools Physical Education and Health website pages will be updated to include curriculum and teacher information so that our parents know exactly what's being taught in physical education and in the health courses.

1293
01:49:37,115 --> 01:49:54,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting in September of 2015, the Michigan model health curriculum will be reviewed for use at all elementary schools during the 2016-2017 school year by putting a committee together of administrators and teachers so that we can review that and talk about the best way to roll that new model out if possible.

1294
01:49:55,945 --> 01:50:04,970
[SPEAKER_03]: By January 2016, the high school physical education program will include swimming courses as electives for juniors and seniors in the course selection handbook.

1295
01:50:06,485 --> 01:50:12,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at the non-salary funding needs for maintenance of equipment, that does stay the same.

1296
01:50:12,409 --> 01:50:14,290
[SPEAKER_03]: We continue to maintain our equipment.

1297
01:50:14,990 --> 01:50:20,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Travel stays the same at 500 so that we can go out to professional development opportunities.

1298
01:50:21,754 --> 01:50:23,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Office supplies stays the same as well.

1299
01:50:24,556 --> 01:50:26,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Under textbooks, you'll see an increase there from 3,000.

1300
01:50:27,677 --> 01:50:29,619
[SPEAKER_03]: It does go to 23,000.

1301
01:50:30,059 --> 01:50:33,981
[SPEAKER_03]: That includes the purchase of the Michigan model curriculum for the elementary schools.

1302
01:50:36,573 --> 01:50:38,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Educational supplies, again, stays the same at 6,000.

1303
01:50:39,314 --> 01:50:42,696
[SPEAKER_03]: And the last one, the fitness center supervision.

1304
01:50:42,716 --> 01:50:44,796
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just like a line item added.

1305
01:50:45,397 --> 01:50:48,638
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't have anything allocated for it, but it was coming out of our budget.

1306
01:50:48,758 --> 01:50:54,700
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's $6,000 to actually staff the fitness center after school for our students.

1307
01:50:56,701 --> 01:50:57,362
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Scarpella.

1308
01:50:59,302 --> 01:50:59,783
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice job.

1309
01:51:00,063 --> 01:51:02,264
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much for your report.

1310
01:51:02,284 --> 01:51:02,484
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1311
01:51:03,670 --> 01:51:07,652
[SPEAKER_19]: As a former phys ed teacher, I have a few questions.

1312
01:51:07,832 --> 01:51:09,832
[SPEAKER_19]: How are the numbers in the health class at the high school?

1313
01:51:09,852 --> 01:51:12,333
[SPEAKER_19]: I know in the past, they've been pretty astronomical.

1314
01:51:13,534 --> 01:51:21,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, our health students go from health to phys ed and then phys ed to health for half the year.

1315
01:51:21,677 --> 01:51:23,518
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have them capped at 30.

1316
01:51:25,675 --> 01:51:38,999
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes students do get put in, and we've really done a great job with the guidance department to make sure that's not happening, or trying to figure out a way to place that student somewhere else so that the classes aren't really over 30.

1317
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:42,000
[SPEAKER_19]: Does that fill all their requirements?

1318
01:51:42,941 --> 01:51:46,002
[SPEAKER_19]: If they move to still everybody's safe place?

1319
01:51:46,422 --> 01:51:48,862
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll move to another health class, I mean, so that they're used.

1320
01:51:48,902 --> 01:51:49,183
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1321
01:51:50,978 --> 01:52:00,686
[SPEAKER_19]: Now I know that you're working a full teaching schedule and now this role, who's doing the evaluations of the teachers for?

1322
01:52:01,687 --> 01:52:03,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Administrators are doing the evaluations.

1323
01:52:03,288 --> 01:52:04,549
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so are you doing those?

1324
01:52:04,589 --> 01:52:04,709
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

1325
01:52:04,789 --> 01:52:05,650
[SPEAKER_19]: No, so you're not yet.

1326
01:52:05,910 --> 01:52:06,231
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1327
01:52:06,731 --> 01:52:07,472
[SPEAKER_19]: But who is, do you know?

1328
01:52:07,492 --> 01:52:11,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's different evaluators for different teachers.

1329
01:52:11,515 --> 01:52:12,516
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know exactly.

1330
01:52:12,556 --> 01:52:17,640
[SPEAKER_18]: We've actually distributed them among the principals, assistant principals and others, but

1331
01:52:20,681 --> 01:52:25,724
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be at the high school level, the assistant principals.

1332
01:52:26,364 --> 01:52:29,245
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Bernadette, you picked up some of the department too.

1333
01:52:29,986 --> 01:52:30,366
[SPEAKER_10]: I did.

1334
01:52:30,426 --> 01:52:33,747
[SPEAKER_10]: So I do one middle school teacher.

1335
01:52:34,088 --> 01:52:35,268
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was split.

1336
01:52:35,308 --> 01:52:41,731
[SPEAKER_10]: We took, we took the Phys Ed teachers and we split them between principals and myself, director.

1337
01:52:42,872 --> 01:52:45,793
[SPEAKER_10]: So Rachel is not, she is in the teachers association.

1338
01:52:47,487 --> 01:52:57,575
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just saying, as a former phys ed teacher, it'd be nice to have an administrator with a background in physical education doing those evaluations.

1339
01:52:57,635 --> 01:53:01,978
[SPEAKER_19]: Not to disrespect anybody here, I think it's a great job, but I think it's important.

1340
01:53:02,378 --> 01:53:05,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if we make her an administrator tonight, she can pick right up tomorrow.

1341
01:53:05,821 --> 01:53:09,564
[SPEAKER_19]: We'd have to evaluate that, but I don't disagree.

1342
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:16,522
[SPEAKER_19]: The equipment, I know the equipment, we keep talking about the equipment at the high school.

1343
01:53:16,782 --> 01:53:21,765
[SPEAKER_19]: It's being used for school, uh, for classes and for afterschool.

1344
01:53:22,365 --> 01:53:36,454
[SPEAKER_19]: We see, we see different groups in there on the weekends, um, through community schools and it is $6,000 enough or are you talking about fitness center maintenance equipment?

1345
01:53:36,474 --> 01:53:36,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me?

1346
01:53:36,674 --> 01:53:36,914
[SPEAKER_03]: $5,000 that yes.

1347
01:53:36,994 --> 01:53:37,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

1348
01:53:42,026 --> 01:53:49,008
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, equipment for the other schools, how is it broken down for their budget for equipment?

1349
01:53:49,549 --> 01:53:55,871
[SPEAKER_03]: I usually break it down between all the schools, so it's about $500 to $600 per school that they're allowed to purchase each year.

1350
01:53:56,451 --> 01:53:56,551
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.

1351
01:53:59,012 --> 01:54:04,874
[SPEAKER_19]: And with the addition of the adaptive physical education teacher, is that needed under

1352
01:54:07,071 --> 01:54:10,274
[SPEAKER_19]: that we fall compliant to special education, or is that just?

1353
01:54:10,294 --> 01:54:11,195
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a must.

1354
01:54:11,215 --> 01:54:14,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, when I met with Captain McDougall, yes.

1355
01:54:14,177 --> 01:54:19,422
[SPEAKER_03]: When she does come to speak on her pre-budget, she's going to speak a little bit more about that as well.

1356
01:54:19,482 --> 01:54:22,685
[SPEAKER_19]: That's going to be interesting to hear, the breakdown of how many children.

1357
01:54:22,705 --> 01:54:31,592
[SPEAKER_19]: Because that might be something you can use hiring a split and adapted physical education teacher, and then looking to fill some of the other gaps that you have.

1358
01:54:31,632 --> 01:54:33,574
[SPEAKER_19]: So that might be something that we need to do.

1359
01:54:36,597 --> 01:54:40,721
[SPEAKER_19]: Then the other number, obviously, that sticks out is the $23,000 for the textbooks.

1360
01:54:42,382 --> 01:54:48,927
[SPEAKER_19]: As we move down, has it been, it's been piloted at the high school level?

1361
01:54:49,688 --> 01:54:51,489
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in the second year at the high school level.

1362
01:54:51,830 --> 01:54:53,691
[SPEAKER_03]: This year it was piloted at the middle schools.

1363
01:54:54,392 --> 01:54:57,975
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're moving down to the pilot, this is what's going to be used to pilot the elementary level?

1364
01:54:58,055 --> 01:54:59,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, at all four elementary schools.

1365
01:54:59,776 --> 01:55:00,197
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, thank you.

1366
01:55:00,877 --> 01:55:01,197
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1367
01:55:01,798 --> 01:55:02,418
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. DiBenedetto.

1368
01:55:03,462 --> 01:55:08,404
[SPEAKER_06]: I thank you for your report, it was very thorough, and I appreciate how you worked everything out.

1369
01:55:08,884 --> 01:55:10,244
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have a question.

1370
01:55:11,545 --> 01:55:17,387
[SPEAKER_06]: You asked for another health education teacher to assist teachers.

1371
01:55:19,255 --> 01:55:40,583
[SPEAKER_06]: to help them implement the curriculum due to the social emotional issues of children in the classroom and I want to address that but I want to address that as a whole district and we talked about possibly having a meeting because we have many departments requesting staff to help this both

1372
01:55:42,263 --> 01:55:51,448
[SPEAKER_06]: A few people have come through, the guidance department has come through to help us with this, to make requests for additional staff members to help with this.

1373
01:55:51,468 --> 01:55:54,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Other department heads have come through.

1374
01:55:54,610 --> 01:55:57,992
[SPEAKER_06]: And we did talk about a few weeks ago or a few meetings ago,

1375
01:55:58,472 --> 01:56:26,841
[SPEAKER_06]: having a meeting to discuss this and how we were going to address this, rather than each department coming and asking the committee for additional supports, but in this manner, as to which is the best way to support our educators in this realm and where those positions should be placed, whether they should be more nurses or more guidance people or more, you know, rather than each department.

1376
01:56:27,932 --> 01:56:35,414
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could I just take for a second because we obviously know there's a need and we know there's a need for more personnel.

1377
01:56:35,514 --> 01:56:43,896
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as people are doing their pre-budget, we've asked them to put it in because obviously we can't get an extra person in each department.

1378
01:56:43,916 --> 01:56:51,438
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hoping that we get one or two extra people, whether it's a health dedicated person or a person guidance dedicated.

1379
01:56:52,238 --> 01:56:55,440
[SPEAKER_02]: because they all work together, but we know there's a need for more.

1380
01:56:55,520 --> 01:57:03,326
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're putting it in their budgets independently, knowing that we're not going to get the full complement of what we're asking, but we're hoping to get more.

1381
01:57:03,646 --> 01:57:12,952
[SPEAKER_02]: With the case of the health, the classroom, elementary classroom teachers have a tremendous burden already teaching all the subjects, and they're the dedicated health teachers.

1382
01:57:13,413 --> 01:57:19,857
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're really with the phys ed, but it's not the high school and the middle school have more people dedicated to the teaching.

1383
01:57:20,422 --> 01:57:26,125
[SPEAKER_02]: The elementary teachers, some of them really, especially the new ones can need some, need some assistance with this.

1384
01:57:26,205 --> 01:57:35,509
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, between the guidance, the health, the nursing, we're hoping to emphasize the need for more people to work on the same topic.

1385
01:57:36,029 --> 01:57:39,891
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't have to be multiple people, but hoping at least one or two.

1386
01:57:40,399 --> 01:57:41,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that that's my point.

1387
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,701
[SPEAKER_06]: We keep discussing this as it keeps coming forward.

1388
01:57:44,741 --> 01:57:55,505
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's great that each department is bringing that, but we did discuss meeting to see which is the best way to move forward to supporting our students needs as well as our staffing needs.

1389
01:57:55,845 --> 01:57:57,126
[SPEAKER_06]: So we talked about that.

1390
01:57:57,166 --> 01:58:00,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you've set up a time for that, Mr. Nelson.

1391
01:58:00,467 --> 01:58:04,329
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, first of all, as you know, we have, and I'm going to talk about more meetings coming up.

1392
01:58:04,905 --> 01:58:07,909
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, we have multiple meetings and, you know, we're already in May.

1393
01:58:08,590 --> 01:58:14,377
[SPEAKER_18]: And so one of the things we're going to be doing is we're going to be, you've got to look at this as a two or three year plan.

1394
01:58:14,938 --> 01:58:17,441
[SPEAKER_18]: People come up and say, I want this, I want that, I want that.

1395
01:58:18,030 --> 01:58:21,993
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, and we're going to triage it for you and give you some recommendations, and then we can discuss it.

1396
01:58:22,013 --> 01:58:25,495
[SPEAKER_18]: It'll be part of our, an active, you know, discussion that we have.

1397
01:58:26,376 --> 01:58:28,257
[SPEAKER_18]: And we'll set up a time to do it.

1398
01:58:28,858 --> 01:58:35,062
[SPEAKER_18]: But obviously, this is, when people come up and they tell you they need this and they need that, in probably over two, three years, we can probably do it.

1399
01:58:35,382 --> 01:58:42,027
[SPEAKER_18]: Just as we replaced assistant principals, just as we put other things in place, you're going to see this move over two, three years.

1400
01:58:42,147 --> 01:58:46,190
[SPEAKER_18]: And now, if the revenue is good, you move a little faster.

1401
01:58:46,808 --> 01:58:51,690
[SPEAKER_18]: But the reality is, is that we're asking people to tell you what they really would like to have, so you see that.

1402
01:58:52,611 --> 01:58:56,653
[SPEAKER_18]: But from our standpoint, we're going to have to triage it over two, three years.

1403
01:58:56,713 --> 01:59:07,698
[SPEAKER_06]: My concern is that we don't just put bodies in certain departments, that we as a committee determine where that need can be best.

1404
01:59:08,419 --> 01:59:11,161
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we'll certainly go over it with you.

1405
01:59:11,181 --> 01:59:20,046
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we've got to look at it from a holistic standpoint because the other thing, too, is that certain departments have people who can do more than one thing.

1406
01:59:20,086 --> 01:59:22,767
[SPEAKER_18]: Some departments don't have that possibility.

1407
01:59:23,247 --> 01:59:25,308
[SPEAKER_18]: We know of certain possible retirements.

1408
01:59:26,049 --> 01:59:29,491
[SPEAKER_18]: That opens the door for replacing people in certain ways.

1409
01:59:29,531 --> 01:59:31,352
[SPEAKER_18]: So, for example, a senior person retires.

1410
01:59:31,792 --> 01:59:35,978
[SPEAKER_18]: You might be able to get two positions for that senior person because of their salary level.

1411
01:59:36,379 --> 01:59:40,324
[SPEAKER_18]: All these things factor in, so we're just going to have to look at it intelligently.

1412
01:59:40,344 --> 01:59:43,748
[SPEAKER_18]: But first thing, we'll get it together, and then we'll have that good discussion that you're looking for.

1413
01:59:44,069 --> 01:59:44,429
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1414
01:59:45,050 --> 01:59:45,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1415
01:59:45,992 --> 01:59:46,532
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. Cunha.

1416
01:59:49,559 --> 01:59:49,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh.

1417
01:59:50,319 --> 01:59:51,799
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Rachel, for your report.

1418
01:59:51,879 --> 01:59:52,699
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really thorough.

1419
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a couple of questions, actually.

1420
01:59:55,260 --> 02:00:03,402
[SPEAKER_11]: When you said you capped your classes at 30, I was just curious in knowing, is the contractual, are we going against any contractual numbers?

1421
02:00:03,442 --> 02:00:07,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I know at the high school level for teachers, it's no more than 23 to 25.

1422
02:00:07,463 --> 02:00:09,584
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for the core content.

1423
02:00:09,864 --> 02:00:12,105
[SPEAKER_02]: So the physical education, we're within the contractual.

1424
02:00:12,705 --> 02:00:13,005
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1425
02:00:13,645 --> 02:00:16,146
[SPEAKER_11]: And Rachel, how many classes are you teaching during the day?

1426
02:00:17,086 --> 02:00:19,848
[SPEAKER_11]: I have three to four a day, depending on the day.

1427
02:00:19,868 --> 02:00:20,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Three to four?

1428
02:00:23,010 --> 02:00:24,251
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're all at the high school?

1429
02:00:24,491 --> 02:00:24,611
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1430
02:00:26,453 --> 02:00:31,936
[SPEAKER_11]: And you had mentioned, you know, that one of the goals is 2016, hopefully we could use the pool.

1431
02:00:32,957 --> 02:00:41,023
[SPEAKER_11]: I was wondering if we could look into maybe some type of intro to lifeguard certification or, I know that's a long

1432
02:00:43,404 --> 02:00:46,585
[SPEAKER_11]: but some type of like introduction as you were mentioning before.

1433
02:00:47,045 --> 02:00:55,289
[SPEAKER_11]: I love your idea about having students maybe come and help out and introduce them to like sports medicine and things like that.

1434
02:00:57,530 --> 02:00:59,972
[SPEAKER_11]: looking at colleges lately, not for one, but for two.

1435
02:01:01,093 --> 02:01:04,255
[SPEAKER_11]: And sports medicine has increased.

1436
02:01:04,335 --> 02:01:14,722
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I can't get over the amount of students now that are looking for sports medicine or, oh my gosh, I just went blank and that's all I've been doing.

1437
02:01:14,742 --> 02:01:17,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Sports medicine, what was the other one?

1438
02:01:17,164 --> 02:01:19,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Sports management and things like that.

1439
02:01:19,185 --> 02:01:20,206
[SPEAKER_11]: So I love that idea.

1440
02:01:20,266 --> 02:01:22,428
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, the Michigan Model Health.

1441
02:01:24,342 --> 02:01:30,566
[SPEAKER_11]: When parents have like open house, has anybody explained the Michigan model health to them?

1442
02:01:30,646 --> 02:01:34,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there any presentation to parents of what it actually encompasses?

1443
02:01:34,207 --> 02:01:45,253
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I know you've spoke about it here, you spoke about it the other night when we had the meeting of the whole, but I was just curious in knowing when we have open houses, do any of the principals speak about it?

1444
02:01:45,513 --> 02:01:47,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Does anybody talk about what we're offering?

1445
02:01:48,054 --> 02:01:48,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1446
02:01:48,374 --> 02:01:52,895
[SPEAKER_03]: When we had the 8th grade night at the high school, I was there and I spoke to parents about the Michigan model.

1447
02:01:53,275 --> 02:02:01,777
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one of the reasons I really want to redo our website so that parents can go on and see exactly what we're offering for health and for physical education.

1448
02:02:02,097 --> 02:02:02,857
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the ideas.

1449
02:02:02,917 --> 02:02:06,878
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the idea of the website.

1450
02:02:06,958 --> 02:02:12,059
[SPEAKER_11]: I just love the inspiration of new eyes, new ears, and new programs.

1451
02:02:12,139 --> 02:02:13,340
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

1452
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:13,980
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for this.

1453
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:14,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1454
02:02:15,660 --> 02:02:17,082
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Scaramucci.

1455
02:02:17,182 --> 02:02:18,204
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Scaramucci.

1456
02:02:18,484 --> 02:02:19,025
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Scaramucci.

1457
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:39,642
[SPEAKER_14]: see if we can put together a professional day, some type of training, adaptive phys ed for our phys ed teachers.

1458
02:02:40,462 --> 02:02:43,423
[SPEAKER_14]: So we can probably begin that beginning in the next school year.

1459
02:02:43,503 --> 02:02:44,263
[SPEAKER_14]: On the Michigan model?

1460
02:02:44,623 --> 02:02:46,943
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, on adaptive phys ed for the kids.

1461
02:02:47,063 --> 02:02:47,864
[SPEAKER_14]: Adaptive, okay.

1462
02:02:47,944 --> 02:02:53,665
[SPEAKER_14]: She needed a need, and I think that's probably one of the first things that we should attend to.

1463
02:02:54,805 --> 02:02:57,766
[SPEAKER_14]: And we get that going, and at least they'll be able to plan for September.

1464
02:02:59,488 --> 02:03:00,749
[SPEAKER_07]: This is very good.

1465
02:03:00,809 --> 02:03:01,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Rachel, thanks for your report.

1466
02:03:01,970 --> 02:03:04,271
[SPEAKER_07]: There were so many interesting things that you touched upon.

1467
02:03:04,972 --> 02:03:09,535
[SPEAKER_07]: One of them, though, I just want to ask you, you mentioned making a 10-minute video that the kids could watch.

1468
02:03:09,935 --> 02:03:10,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it posted someplace?

1469
02:03:12,237 --> 02:03:13,958
[SPEAKER_07]: It is not, but I can get you a copy of it.

1470
02:03:14,018 --> 02:03:27,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I just was thinking that it could also be a nice introduction for other teachers at the elementary level and whatever, because I'm thinking so much that we're going to need to incorporate this somehow into our curriculum.

1471
02:03:28,287 --> 02:03:35,152
[SPEAKER_07]: ways to help kids relax and teachers relax, but I'm thinking about the anxiety that we talked about.

1472
02:03:35,592 --> 02:03:37,554
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, if it's possible, I'd love to see it.

1473
02:03:37,794 --> 02:03:41,236
[SPEAKER_03]: We could also probably put it on the Memphis Public Schools website.

1474
02:03:41,276 --> 02:03:43,298
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a great option.

1475
02:03:43,538 --> 02:03:44,078
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Scariot.

1476
02:03:44,098 --> 02:03:48,041
[SPEAKER_14]: How about giving Mr. Dempsey to put it on the high school channel?

1477
02:03:48,701 --> 02:03:49,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we could do that as well.

1478
02:03:49,702 --> 02:03:50,583
[SPEAKER_14]: A couple of mornings a week.

1479
02:03:50,603 --> 02:03:50,683
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1480
02:03:52,892 --> 02:03:53,653
[SPEAKER_14]: and Mrs. Cuno.

1481
02:03:53,673 --> 02:04:03,198
[SPEAKER_11]: I had one more question, and that was, you have down here that you'd like to improve the middle school schedule to afford all students the same amount of time in physical education and health.

1482
02:04:03,598 --> 02:04:05,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you elaborate a little bit more on that?

1483
02:04:05,479 --> 02:04:13,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, what's happening is, like I said, at the McGlynn, we have 2.5 teachers, and at the Anders, we only have two.

1484
02:04:13,744 --> 02:04:18,347
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're not covering as much of the curriculum as the McGlynn is.

1485
02:04:19,007 --> 02:04:24,769
[SPEAKER_03]: So adding another 0.5 would actually help afford and make that a little bit more even on both sides.

1486
02:04:25,649 --> 02:04:34,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so it's not necessarily then, because I've heard in the past, you know, well, if you're selecting an instrument, then you lose out on the Phys Ed, but you're not saying that.

1487
02:04:34,651 --> 02:04:37,992
[SPEAKER_11]: You're saying that it's more because of a 0.5 teacher.

1488
02:04:38,072 --> 02:04:40,133
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what we're saying for health and Phys Ed, yes.

1489
02:04:40,773 --> 02:04:41,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

1490
02:04:43,012 --> 02:04:44,833
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, thank you for your report, very thorough.

1491
02:04:44,853 --> 02:04:47,155
[SPEAKER_15]: I just had a quick question, well, statement.

1492
02:04:47,575 --> 02:04:51,497
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, I'm really happy to see that in your goals and objectives that you're incorporating the pool.

1493
02:04:52,138 --> 02:04:54,079
[SPEAKER_15]: It's fabulous, I mean, it's a great facility.

1494
02:04:54,519 --> 02:04:59,162
[SPEAKER_15]: Not all cities and towns have a facility like this, and it's great to see that we're using it.

1495
02:04:59,723 --> 02:05:07,268
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the things I was wondering is, have we ever done any type of poll, got to the high school students, and how many kids know how to swim?

1496
02:05:08,208 --> 02:05:14,135
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we actually haven't had a pool in a while, so I'm thinking, you know, there could be a group of people out there that just don't know how to swim.

1497
02:05:14,155 --> 02:05:21,463
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's something that should look into just a swimming class in general, how to swim, especially because you hear each year how so many kids...

1498
02:05:22,733 --> 02:05:24,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, that's definitely a great idea.

1499
02:05:24,253 --> 02:05:40,336
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things I was looking at doing is when we do have the swimming electives for juniors and seniors, that we would do one introduction to swimming for those students that cannot swim, and one more of water games for the students that can swim, where they can learn different water games.

1500
02:05:42,337 --> 02:05:44,757
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Scott probably touched on it earlier, the maintenance of equipment.

1501
02:05:45,177 --> 02:05:47,758
[SPEAKER_15]: So with regard to that budget line item, is that

1502
02:05:48,953 --> 02:05:53,101
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that inclusive of the fitness center or is that just equipment outside of the fitness center?

1503
02:05:53,442 --> 02:05:54,043
[SPEAKER_15]: It's both.

1504
02:05:54,284 --> 02:05:55,065
[SPEAKER_15]: It's both.

1505
02:05:55,145 --> 02:05:56,428
[SPEAKER_15]: And with regard to that.

1506
02:05:57,257 --> 02:06:00,258
[SPEAKER_15]: The fitness center in general, is the equipment in kind of shape?

1507
02:06:00,278 --> 02:06:01,419
[SPEAKER_15]: Are we in pretty good shape still?

1508
02:06:01,479 --> 02:06:01,759
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

1509
02:06:01,819 --> 02:06:04,980
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a maintenance company that's coming in to look at the equipment.

1510
02:06:05,240 --> 02:06:08,101
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few things that do need to be tightened, things like that.

1511
02:06:08,141 --> 02:06:10,222
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't had anything major break down.

1512
02:06:10,882 --> 02:06:24,087
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things when we did order the equipment, I used to manage fitness centers, so one of the things that I advised not to get was treadmills, because that's where you're really putting a lot of money in flipping the decks and putting on new belts and things like that.

1513
02:06:24,367 --> 02:06:30,809
[SPEAKER_03]: So the equipment we have is in really good shape and just little things that need to be repaired.

1514
02:06:32,149 --> 02:06:33,329
[SPEAKER_11]: I just thought about the pool again.

1515
02:06:33,769 --> 02:06:34,190
[SPEAKER_11]: The pool.

1516
02:06:34,350 --> 02:06:41,591
[SPEAKER_11]: If students are taking swimming, is there a proper bathing suit that we're asking students to be wearing?

1517
02:06:42,232 --> 02:06:44,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are some things that we do need to go over as a staff.

1518
02:06:44,572 --> 02:06:46,213
[SPEAKER_03]: That is definitely going to be incorporated.

1519
02:06:46,913 --> 02:06:48,333
[SPEAKER_03]: That's definitely something we need to do.

1520
02:06:48,573 --> 02:06:48,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

1521
02:06:54,942 --> 02:07:00,524
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, on the motion of Mr. Skerry to approve the pre-budget report on health and PE in place on file, all those in favor?

1522
02:07:00,564 --> 02:07:01,885
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, opposed?

1523
02:07:01,945 --> 02:07:03,365
[SPEAKER_15]: The report is accepted.

1524
02:07:03,485 --> 02:07:04,025
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

1525
02:07:04,145 --> 02:07:04,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1526
02:07:04,606 --> 02:07:10,968
[SPEAKER_15]: Next item is the pre-budget report on ELL, Mr. Superintendent.

1527
02:07:12,248 --> 02:07:13,909
[SPEAKER_15]: Last but not, certainly not least.

1528
02:07:15,430 --> 02:07:19,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, by the time I get to this time in NIDA, it probably least.

1529
02:07:19,071 --> 02:07:21,432
[SPEAKER_18]: This report will be delivered in five languages.

1530
02:07:23,372 --> 02:07:38,341
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the pool discussion, I just want you to all know that one of the high school teachers is actually sending out an email to see if there will be a faculty interest in having a swim club for faculty in the mornings.

1531
02:07:38,861 --> 02:07:39,581
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of cool.

1532
02:07:39,621 --> 02:07:41,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian Murnoff, one of the chemistry teachers.

1533
02:07:44,204 --> 02:07:56,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well first I would like to thank you all and the superintendent and central office for your continued support of the very important work we do in the ELL department.

1534
02:07:56,411 --> 02:08:03,635
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also really want to publicly thank my dedicated and talented ELL staff for all that they do each and every day.

1535
02:08:03,715 --> 02:08:05,476
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really amazing.

1536
02:08:07,743 --> 02:08:17,969
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see from the breakdown of ELLs in each school and the languages represented by our current ELL population, we service an extremely diverse group of students.

1537
02:08:18,229 --> 02:08:23,753
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did include a sheet with all the languages and the numbers at each school.

1538
02:08:24,713 --> 02:08:25,994
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really pretty remarkable.

1539
02:08:26,034 --> 02:08:35,820
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford is unusual in the number of languages that we have for, you know, we don't have a gigantic program like a Boston or whatever.

1540
02:08:36,160 --> 02:08:39,401
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have a very, very diverse program.

1541
02:08:42,342 --> 02:08:50,523
[SPEAKER_01]: So in addition to the many countries of origin and languages spoken, this year we have registered a number of incoming students with disrupted schooling.

1542
02:08:51,164 --> 02:09:00,466
[SPEAKER_01]: This has posed an additional challenge for my staff in terms of course needs, curriculum, materials, and differentiation.

1543
02:09:01,346 --> 02:09:09,630
[SPEAKER_01]: We have registered approximately 85 students over the course of the 2014-15 school year, and more continue to come.

1544
02:09:10,491 --> 02:09:15,293
[SPEAKER_01]: My assessment specialist and lead teacher, Loretta Tusa, has been very, very busy.

1545
02:09:18,195 --> 02:09:34,446
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the funding we received this year, we were able to purchase much needed science textbooks for the middle school, National Geographic ELL language arts textbooks for MHS, and ELL world history textbooks for MHS.

1546
02:09:35,187 --> 02:09:39,329
[SPEAKER_01]: We also got two computers per newcomers class, a huge help.

1547
02:09:40,230 --> 02:09:44,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that we have the computers, it is critical to fund software.

1548
02:09:46,011 --> 02:09:59,805
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my teachers last summer did a research project on best software for ELLs, and the chosen program was BrainPOP, which is actually a great program for the entire system, not just ELLs.

1549
02:10:00,906 --> 02:10:07,473
[SPEAKER_01]: And my wonderful secretary, Gislaine Pinto, was able to get a one month free trial for it.

1550
02:10:08,794 --> 02:10:14,339
[SPEAKER_01]: In your packets you have testimonials written by the students and one of the teachers.

1551
02:10:14,940 --> 02:10:19,925
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't able to get a chance to poll everybody, but some of them did send out some.

1552
02:10:20,845 --> 02:10:24,809
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some testimonials from the newcomer students and teachers at the Roberts.

1553
02:10:26,591 --> 02:10:30,255
[SPEAKER_01]: The software program was highly regarded across the city in ELL classrooms.

1554
02:10:30,335 --> 02:10:31,596
[SPEAKER_01]: It really made a big difference.

1555
02:10:32,297 --> 02:10:36,180
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be a tremendous tool, not only for us, but for mainstream teachers as well.

1556
02:10:37,580 --> 02:10:46,124
[SPEAKER_01]: We also need some science books for the Newcomers Elementary Program and updated assessment tests for the placement of entering ELLs.

1557
02:10:47,145 --> 02:10:50,106
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be in order to be aligned with the WIDA standards.

1558
02:10:51,887 --> 02:10:57,990
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, one more teacher for the Elementary Newcomers Program would go a long way in meeting the needs of the ELL students.

1559
02:10:58,791 --> 02:11:00,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry to ask for another staff member.

1560
02:11:02,161 --> 02:11:06,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently our grade four or five class is overflowing over at the Roberts.

1561
02:11:07,787 --> 02:11:12,672
[SPEAKER_01]: More details on funding are in the ELL pre-budget report, should you have any questions.

1562
02:11:15,875 --> 02:11:23,323
[SPEAKER_01]: So already, having already presented many of the highlights from this year in March, I'll only touch upon new information.

1563
02:11:24,576 --> 02:11:28,079
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are many things that went on this year that were great.

1564
02:11:28,199 --> 02:11:42,750
[SPEAKER_01]: So members of the ELL staff, including Xia Lin, Melissa McIntyre, Lisa Bolio, Emily Polini, Ami Sanye, Tanya Bogaty, Matt McKenna, Teresa Castagnetti, Sarah Dion, and Katie Rockwell.

1565
02:11:43,390 --> 02:11:48,592
[SPEAKER_01]: are working on ELL curriculum K through 12, and then that includes math and science as well.

1566
02:11:49,633 --> 02:11:54,514
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a long-term project projected to be mostly completed by July 2016.

1567
02:11:55,075 --> 02:11:58,756
[SPEAKER_01]: DESE originally said they wanted it done by then.

1568
02:11:59,496 --> 02:12:07,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they offered to do some, a framework themselves and realized how difficult it was, so my guess is we'll probably have an extension.

1569
02:12:10,618 --> 02:12:20,965
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as retail news, my survey monkeys kept failing when I tried to figure out exactly how many people had taken the courses, what was still needed.

1570
02:12:21,765 --> 02:12:29,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Really only DESE has that exact information because I don't have anything to do with teachers who take courses outside of Medford.

1571
02:12:30,271 --> 02:12:36,475
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would guess that probably close to 300 of our teachers have gotten their endorsement.

1572
02:12:37,155 --> 02:12:40,038
[SPEAKER_01]: That leaves approximately 100 who still need to.

1573
02:12:42,020 --> 02:12:50,549
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave all that information to DESE so they are aware of the courses that we need and what numbers we still have for each kind of course.

1574
02:12:51,530 --> 02:12:55,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost all of the administrators have completed the SEI endorsement requirements.

1575
02:12:56,295 --> 02:12:59,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of us, most of us, took a course this spring.

1576
02:12:59,857 --> 02:13:07,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Diane Guarino and I audited it just so that we would know what was going on, because anyone who has ESL certification does not have to take those courses.

1577
02:13:10,518 --> 02:13:20,325
[SPEAKER_01]: We provided professional development within my department for the interface between ELLs and special education, which keeps coming up over and over again.

1578
02:13:21,085 --> 02:13:30,552
[SPEAKER_01]: And this coming summer, we're going to offer a workshop for my teachers targeting the WIDA standards, which is a very, very involved piece for them.

1579
02:13:33,117 --> 02:13:42,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of our ELL teachers, Lisa Bolio and Melissa McIntyre, have also offered to provide training for our staff in regard to the retail initiative.

1580
02:13:43,521 --> 02:13:48,923
[SPEAKER_01]: This will give the ELL staff an understanding of the expectations for mainstream teachers in these courses.

1581
02:13:49,743 --> 02:13:54,425
[SPEAKER_01]: And Miss Bolio is actually a DESE trained retail instructor and taught a course this spring.

1582
02:13:57,178 --> 02:14:08,645
[SPEAKER_01]: We provided language enrichment programs at every school where there is an ELL program this year after school, mostly taught by my teachers.

1583
02:14:08,665 --> 02:14:13,528
[SPEAKER_01]: A few other staff members who are ESL certified also taught them.

1584
02:14:15,622 --> 02:14:18,763
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some very exciting news that we just found out about.

1585
02:14:18,863 --> 02:14:27,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Our ELL summer program will get free lunches this summer, sponsored by Project Bread and the Food Services Department.

1586
02:14:28,146 --> 02:14:29,567
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really thrilled about that.

1587
02:14:31,888 --> 02:14:40,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Tanya Bogaty, an ELL teacher at the McGlynn Middle School, provided professional development for mainstream teachers to prepare for the SEIM TEL.

1588
02:14:42,717 --> 02:14:56,663
[SPEAKER_01]: At the McGlynn Middle, Matt McKenna, Tanya Bogarty, and Elaine Oggett presented the world of ESL and ELL's PowerPoint presentation to the McGlynn Middle School staff, and I think I included a copy of that for you.

1589
02:15:01,508 --> 02:15:09,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Melissa McIntyre, an ELL teacher at Medford High, organized and ran a multicultural night at Medford High in March.

1590
02:15:10,658 --> 02:15:20,570
[SPEAKER_01]: And Emily Polini, also an ELL teacher at the high school, presented at the symposium on Chapter 22 Discipline and Best Practices this past Saturday.

1591
02:15:21,505 --> 02:15:25,129
[SPEAKER_01]: So my teachers are really, I'm not just saying that they're great, they truly are.

1592
02:15:25,609 --> 02:15:26,550
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very involved.

1593
02:15:28,051 --> 02:15:38,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Ami Sanye and Tanya Bogaty have administered and taught adult ELL evening classes this year, a very important component for the families in Medford.

1594
02:15:40,580 --> 02:16:00,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Another very interesting thing that happened this year, a young woman named, I hope I get this right, Hawasata Dombuya, who is a Medford High graduate and former ELL student, currently a PhD candidate in molecular pharmacology and physiology at Brown University.

1595
02:16:01,645 --> 02:16:02,366
[SPEAKER_01]: really amazing.

1596
02:16:02,446 --> 02:16:05,147
[SPEAKER_01]: She's implemented the science career program.

1597
02:16:05,947 --> 02:16:11,791
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she was written up in a Brown University publication about our

1598
02:16:13,468 --> 02:16:17,331
[SPEAKER_01]: She's presented at Medford High over the course of the year, which I gave you a copy of.

1599
02:16:18,011 --> 02:16:28,478
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would like to invite any of you who would like to attend to the next panel discussion, which is at the high school on Monday, May 11th at approximately 1230.

1600
02:16:29,299 --> 02:16:34,742
[SPEAKER_01]: She'll be having former Medford High ELL students present and talk about what they're currently doing.

1601
02:16:36,564 --> 02:16:37,624
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's been wonderful.

1602
02:16:38,525 --> 02:16:39,586
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a great role model.

1603
02:16:40,993 --> 02:16:53,483
[SPEAKER_01]: And another really great thing that just recently happened, Teresa Castagnetti, one of our ELL teachers at the McGlynn Elementary School, won Teacher of the Year award from MatSol.

1604
02:16:54,264 --> 02:17:01,069
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was nominated by Sarah Dionne, a second year ELL teacher whom she mentored last year.

1605
02:17:02,511 --> 02:17:07,575
[SPEAKER_01]: She will be recognized at the MatSol conference this Thursday evening, so that's really exciting.

1606
02:17:08,751 --> 02:17:23,897
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, I would like to publicly thank Nelida Lepore, the high school Spanish teacher extraordinaire, for organizing the educational tour to Cuba that many of us were able to experience during April vacation.

1607
02:17:23,937 --> 02:17:28,039
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a remarkable trip, and she did a tremendous job.

1608
02:17:29,880 --> 02:17:31,443
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you all for your attention.

1609
02:17:32,124 --> 02:17:41,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Our work with the English language learners is an extremely important piece in the scope of the many functions of our schools and I'd be happy to try to answer any of your questions.

1610
02:17:49,009 --> 02:17:53,912
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to comment on one of our teachers becoming the Matisol Teacher of the Year award.

1611
02:17:54,812 --> 02:18:02,375
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Teresa very well and she's been a long standing, dedicated teacher throughout our community for a very long time.

1612
02:18:02,776 --> 02:18:06,557
[SPEAKER_06]: And I personally want to congratulate her as well as a member of the school committee.

1613
02:18:07,037 --> 02:18:10,259
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the type of thing that we hope all of our teachers,

1614
02:18:11,045 --> 02:18:15,248
[SPEAKER_06]: become and I look at her as a master teacher.

1615
02:18:15,408 --> 02:18:16,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

1616
02:18:16,029 --> 02:18:16,830
[SPEAKER_06]: She's incredible.

1617
02:18:17,190 --> 02:18:23,775
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a huge, this is throughout all of the United States.

1618
02:18:23,835 --> 02:18:25,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts.

1619
02:18:25,436 --> 02:18:26,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1620
02:18:26,357 --> 02:18:28,579
[SPEAKER_01]: That's outstanding work.

1621
02:18:28,639 --> 02:18:29,480
[SPEAKER_01]: She's wonderful.

1622
02:18:29,560 --> 02:18:32,482
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the other teachers look to Teresa for answers.

1623
02:18:32,542 --> 02:18:34,023
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, she's really terrific.

1624
02:18:34,744 --> 02:18:35,004
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1625
02:18:37,220 --> 02:18:41,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Following up on that is I thought that we should at least invite her to school.

1626
02:18:41,186 --> 02:18:41,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1627
02:18:41,967 --> 02:18:43,349
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's in the plans.

1628
02:18:43,849 --> 02:18:45,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, perfect.

1629
02:18:48,454 --> 02:18:48,934
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Felton.

1630
02:18:49,495 --> 02:18:50,355
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Scott Felton.

1631
02:18:50,475 --> 02:18:54,257
[SPEAKER_19]: If I can, as a former colleague of Ms.

1632
02:18:54,297 --> 02:19:00,620
[SPEAKER_19]: Castaneda, she was a great role model, not only for just the ELL teachers, but all of our teachers.

1633
02:19:00,660 --> 02:19:04,382
[SPEAKER_19]: So we applaud her and thank her.

1634
02:19:04,622 --> 02:19:09,704
[SPEAKER_19]: One question I just had to have, I know in the past, it's a question we've always asked.

1635
02:19:09,824 --> 02:19:17,008
[SPEAKER_19]: We're in compliance with the Department of Education with all of our numbers and teaching teachers.

1636
02:19:17,915 --> 02:19:19,936
[SPEAKER_19]: across the board.

1637
02:19:20,697 --> 02:19:23,058
[SPEAKER_09]: For retail are you referring to?

1638
02:19:23,098 --> 02:19:26,460
[SPEAKER_19]: For all of our coverages that we have.

1639
02:19:27,781 --> 02:19:29,282
[SPEAKER_19]: There are no issues, no additions.

1640
02:19:31,523 --> 02:19:33,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Class sizes.

1641
02:19:33,244 --> 02:19:34,805
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a problem at the Roberts.

1642
02:19:35,225 --> 02:19:37,386
[SPEAKER_01]: The newcomers grade four or five classes.

1643
02:19:37,486 --> 02:19:39,648
[SPEAKER_19]: Right, so the Roberts is, this is,

1644
02:19:40,779 --> 02:19:43,481
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the one we're asking for the increased consent.

1645
02:19:43,521 --> 02:19:47,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's so hard to judge with ESL because the kids come and go.

1646
02:19:47,523 --> 02:19:52,146
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, we've registered close to 85 kids this year who entered.

1647
02:19:52,486 --> 02:19:53,787
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also had some exit.

1648
02:19:54,168 --> 02:19:59,891
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that's a tough part, especially as years end in different countries and they move.

1649
02:20:00,331 --> 02:20:00,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1650
02:20:01,132 --> 02:20:03,594
[SPEAKER_19]: They might be done in their countries, then move here.

1651
02:20:03,614 --> 02:20:03,774
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

1652
02:20:03,794 --> 02:20:06,395
[SPEAKER_19]: And they're right in the middle of ours, so I know how difficult it is.

1653
02:20:06,655 --> 02:20:08,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so currently,

1654
02:20:09,317 --> 02:20:14,803
[SPEAKER_01]: The Roberts Newcomers Grade 4-5 class has been a very large class all year long.

1655
02:20:15,224 --> 02:20:16,004
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1656
02:20:18,359 --> 02:20:27,344
[SPEAKER_06]: So I see what your wish list is for 2016, and I see a large increase in software.

1657
02:20:27,744 --> 02:20:30,105
[SPEAKER_06]: What type of software would that be?

1658
02:20:30,646 --> 02:20:41,712
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's for BrainPOP across the city, and hopefully RAS Kids, although a lot of the elementary teachers have collected a little bit of money from each student for RAS Kids.

1659
02:20:42,733 --> 02:20:50,754
[SPEAKER_01]: But the BrainPop, I believe, is close to a little over $14,000 if we bought it system-wide.

1660
02:20:51,571 --> 02:20:54,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, and my other question is about your assessment tools.

1661
02:20:54,534 --> 02:20:54,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1662
02:20:55,054 --> 02:20:58,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Are those to keep up with regulations that have come forth?

1663
02:20:59,339 --> 02:21:12,312
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we've used the same assessment tools for placement of incoming students for many, many years, and Loretta is in the process of going to different cities and calling different places to see what people use.

1664
02:21:12,852 --> 02:21:22,678
[SPEAKER_01]: The state allows us to use a free test from WIDA, which isn't necessarily the best test, but we have used it.

1665
02:21:23,359 --> 02:21:29,843
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're looking to try to come up with the very best thing we can do so that we do place kids accurately.

1666
02:21:29,863 --> 02:21:30,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1667
02:21:31,824 --> 02:21:32,464
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. Cuno.

1668
02:21:33,565 --> 02:21:34,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Leslie, for the report.

1669
02:21:36,106 --> 02:21:40,129
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking at your pie chart, the one from Massachusetts and the one from Medford.

1670
02:21:41,517 --> 02:21:48,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Because English is not on these pies at all, I'm assuming that these pies are just based on ELL students, correct?

1671
02:21:48,365 --> 02:21:50,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1672
02:21:50,507 --> 02:21:54,672
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the PowerPoint that Matt McKenna put together for the middle school teachers, yes.

1673
02:21:55,814 --> 02:21:56,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1674
02:21:59,916 --> 02:22:03,877
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to comment, I mean, I sort of got lost in some of the handouts you gave us.

1675
02:22:03,897 --> 02:22:07,559
[SPEAKER_07]: They're great, very much like the PowerPoint that you'd mentioned.

1676
02:22:08,099 --> 02:22:11,040
[SPEAKER_07]: And reading the kids bring up very cute.

1677
02:22:11,180 --> 02:22:11,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Aren't they cute?

1678
02:22:11,760 --> 02:22:12,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.

1679
02:22:12,541 --> 02:22:18,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I definitely, it would be very, very nice to be able to provide that because clearly that's something that they enjoy.

1680
02:22:18,703 --> 02:22:18,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1681
02:22:21,990 --> 02:22:28,336
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, on the motion of Mr. Secretary and seconded by Mrs. DiBenedetto to accept the pre-budget report on ELL and place on file.

1682
02:22:28,396 --> 02:22:29,116
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1683
02:22:29,497 --> 02:22:29,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1684
02:22:29,777 --> 02:22:30,137
[SPEAKER_15]: Opposed?

1685
02:22:30,157 --> 02:22:31,719
[SPEAKER_15]: The report is accepted and placed on file.

1686
02:22:31,919 --> 02:22:32,439
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

1687
02:22:32,459 --> 02:22:33,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1688
02:22:33,100 --> 02:22:33,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1689
02:22:34,061 --> 02:22:36,263
[SPEAKER_15]: Next item, report on summer programs.

1690
02:22:36,363 --> 02:22:37,204
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Superintendent.

1691
02:22:37,724 --> 02:22:45,231
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, we call upon our curriculum director, Dr. Bernadette Riccobelli, to tell us about what's going to happen this summer quite a bit.

1692
02:22:47,151 --> 02:22:47,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

1693
02:22:47,611 --> 02:22:54,475
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm here tonight to tell you about our summer 2015 programs for students.

1694
02:22:55,015 --> 02:23:00,338
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand you have read this report, so I'll try to keep it brief and leave plenty of time for questions.

1695
02:23:01,259 --> 02:23:04,981
[SPEAKER_10]: So this year, there are seven programs, two of which are new.

1696
02:23:05,001 --> 02:23:07,242
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll spend most time talking about those two new programs.

1697
02:23:07,842 --> 02:23:17,427
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have our regular summer school program, and as you know, this program is designed to meet the needs of students in grades 6 to 12 who have failed one to two of their major courses.

1698
02:23:18,107 --> 02:23:23,710
[SPEAKER_10]: This year, summer school takes place at Medford High School between July 1st and August 11th.

1699
02:23:24,150 --> 02:23:26,531
[SPEAKER_10]: The cost is $250 for Medford students and $300 for students outside of Medford.

1700
02:23:31,535 --> 02:23:34,877
[SPEAKER_10]: We also have an English Language Learner Summer Program.

1701
02:23:35,557 --> 02:23:46,004
[SPEAKER_10]: So this program is intended to help ELL students master the important skills so that they can be successful when they come back to school in the fall and then beyond.

1702
02:23:46,664 --> 02:23:49,266
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's an elementary and a middle school program.

1703
02:23:49,286 --> 02:23:51,848
[SPEAKER_10]: That program runs from July 6 to July 30.

1704
02:23:52,988 --> 02:23:56,290
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there is a high school program, and it is a short program.

1705
02:23:56,330 --> 02:23:57,291
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a few days.

1706
02:23:57,351 --> 02:23:59,092
[SPEAKER_10]: It's June 30 to Friday, July 3.

1707
02:24:00,933 --> 02:24:04,854
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason for that short time frame is because many of the ELL students work.

1708
02:24:05,855 --> 02:24:12,217
[SPEAKER_10]: So under the advisement of the ELL director, that program was created to be just for a few days.

1709
02:24:13,597 --> 02:24:19,539
[SPEAKER_10]: As Leslie mentioned, breakfast will be included in the cost, and the cost of the program is free to the students.

1710
02:24:19,599 --> 02:24:20,960
[SPEAKER_10]: It is supported by the grant.

1711
02:24:22,754 --> 02:24:25,857
[SPEAKER_10]: The third program is the Summer Fun Program.

1712
02:24:26,217 --> 02:24:37,167
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a recreational program offered through Medford Community Schools that will take place this year at the high school and not the Columbus, and that's due to the availability of the high school pool.

1713
02:24:37,828 --> 02:24:42,912
[SPEAKER_10]: So that will run from July 6th to August 21st for students in grades K through 6.

1714
02:24:43,873 --> 02:24:51,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Students will have an opportunity to participate in a number of activities and sports and swimming and many more activities.

1715
02:24:51,437 --> 02:24:56,399
[SPEAKER_10]: So parents can sign up on a weekly basis for their child, children.

1716
02:24:56,799 --> 02:25:00,481
[SPEAKER_10]: The cost is $145 per week and includes breakfast every day and pizza Friday.

1717
02:25:05,613 --> 02:25:11,757
[SPEAKER_10]: The next program is a new program, and it was organized by Molly Leighton.

1718
02:25:12,017 --> 02:25:14,599
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the Middle School Computer Science Camp.

1719
02:25:15,400 --> 02:25:23,045
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is, I think, an innovative program that's going to provide middle school students with the opportunity to explore the field of computer science.

1720
02:25:23,085 --> 02:25:26,847
[SPEAKER_10]: And they'll be developing a working mobile app.

1721
02:25:27,328 --> 02:25:29,489
[SPEAKER_10]: So they'll develop a community-focused app.

1722
02:25:29,789 --> 02:25:32,571
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's really a social justice

1723
02:25:34,260 --> 02:25:40,841
[SPEAKER_10]: slant to this, and they will collaborate with other students to further their problem solving and programming skills.

1724
02:25:41,381 --> 02:25:50,083
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's available to our district through the Middle School Pathways and Computer Science Grant, which is through the National Science Foundation.

1725
02:25:50,863 --> 02:25:58,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Lunch is provided daily, and the dates for this camp, again, it's a short one, it is one week, it's July 6th to July 10th from 8.30 to 3.30 p.m.

1726
02:26:02,732 --> 02:26:04,935
[SPEAKER_10]: The next camp is also a new one.

1727
02:26:06,116 --> 02:26:08,018
[SPEAKER_10]: The next program, I should say, is also a new program.

1728
02:26:08,679 --> 02:26:11,582
[SPEAKER_10]: It's at the Vocational Technical High School.

1729
02:26:11,822 --> 02:26:13,745
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is an idea from Heidi Riccio.

1730
02:26:14,726 --> 02:26:21,373
[SPEAKER_10]: This program has been developed to provide grade seven students with an opportunity to explore the various offerings at the vocational school.

1731
02:26:22,194 --> 02:26:32,998
[SPEAKER_10]: And some of these programs include culinary arts, cosmetology, robotics and engineering, metal fabrication, babysitting certification, biotechnology and environmental science.

1732
02:26:34,338 --> 02:26:39,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Each one of these programs will also include one hour swimming at the Medford High School pool.

1733
02:26:40,200 --> 02:26:46,466
[SPEAKER_10]: The course runs Monday to Thursday from July 13th to July 30th from 8 a.m.

1734
02:26:46,566 --> 02:26:47,587
[SPEAKER_10]: to 12 noon.

1735
02:26:48,548 --> 02:26:49,949
[SPEAKER_10]: The cost is $150 and that price includes a snack.

1736
02:26:53,999 --> 02:26:58,464
[SPEAKER_10]: We anticipate that we're going to have a number of students apply for this program.

1737
02:26:59,125 --> 02:26:59,886
[SPEAKER_10]: It is limited.

1738
02:26:59,906 --> 02:27:00,927
[SPEAKER_10]: This is our first year.

1739
02:27:00,967 --> 02:27:01,868
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying it out.

1740
02:27:02,129 --> 02:27:03,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps in the future it will grow.

1741
02:27:04,852 --> 02:27:12,462
[SPEAKER_10]: So students will be enrolled on a first-come, first-served basis, and seats will be divided equally between the two middle schools.

1742
02:27:14,690 --> 02:27:34,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Our next program is the High School 101 program, which has been running for a number of, I'd say three or four years now, and from all accounts has been enormously successful in providing our incoming ninth grade students with an orientation, a physical orientation of Medford High School campus, and an academic orientation.

1743
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:38,562
[SPEAKER_10]: The teachers prepare them for their summer reading assignments.

1744
02:27:38,622 --> 02:27:43,305
[SPEAKER_10]: They go over what they need to be successful in their first days in their algebra class.

1745
02:27:45,575 --> 02:27:50,400
[SPEAKER_10]: So that program will run in late August, and it runs for a week.

1746
02:27:51,001 --> 02:27:54,384
[SPEAKER_10]: In previous years, it had been funded through the academic support grant.

1747
02:27:55,786 --> 02:28:02,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Since the allocation for this grant has been significantly reduced recently, we are now funding it through our regular budget.

1748
02:28:04,670 --> 02:28:08,631
[SPEAKER_10]: And lastly, for summer programs, we have our special ed programs.

1749
02:28:09,411 --> 02:28:13,492
[SPEAKER_10]: These programs are designed to meet the various needs of our special ed students.

1750
02:28:14,012 --> 02:28:19,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Many of the students have IEPs that specify that they need to have 11-month services.

1751
02:28:20,273 --> 02:28:23,034
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've designed these programs with this in mind.

1752
02:28:23,434 --> 02:28:27,795
[SPEAKER_10]: So there are six-week programs that run from July 6 to the 14th.

1753
02:28:29,642 --> 02:28:34,208
[SPEAKER_10]: and four-week programs that run from July 13th to August 7th.

1754
02:28:34,729 --> 02:28:41,197
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there are also some tutoring and related service programs depending on the individual needs of students.

1755
02:28:42,218 --> 02:28:43,800
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're in the process right now of

1756
02:28:45,525 --> 02:28:53,092
[SPEAKER_10]: creating job descriptions for our instructors for these various programs, and we will be recruiting students very soon.

1757
02:28:53,172 --> 02:28:54,813
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm seeing now that we're at the beginning of May.

1758
02:28:58,256 --> 02:28:58,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you Bernadette.

1759
02:28:59,077 --> 02:29:04,182
[SPEAKER_07]: How many students can be included in the middle school computer science camp?

1760
02:29:05,162 --> 02:29:07,404
[SPEAKER_10]: That is Molly's program.

1761
02:29:07,845 --> 02:29:09,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I don't have a number on that.

1762
02:29:10,367 --> 02:29:18,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Originally, that program was designed to take students who were already in the middle school computer science program.

1763
02:29:18,514 --> 02:29:23,178
[SPEAKER_10]: When I talked to Molly last, she anticipated there probably would be about 15 students.

1764
02:29:24,279 --> 02:29:27,221
[SPEAKER_10]: About 15, 1-5, about 15 students.

1765
02:29:27,261 --> 02:29:28,942
[SPEAKER_10]: That's her anticipated number.

1766
02:29:30,881 --> 02:29:36,548
[SPEAKER_07]: I just note, because it's free, that parents looking... Right, it's free.

1767
02:29:36,608 --> 02:29:44,699
[SPEAKER_10]: And when we talked about it, I guess the one drawback is that when parents are looking to place their students in a program, they're looking for a longer duration.

1768
02:29:45,320 --> 02:29:46,521
[SPEAKER_10]: This is just one week.

1769
02:29:48,227 --> 02:29:49,107
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a great program.

1770
02:29:49,167 --> 02:29:50,268
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to take away from it.

1771
02:29:50,308 --> 02:29:51,088
[SPEAKER_10]: It's wonderful.

1772
02:29:51,108 --> 02:29:57,771
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some concern about our parents going to want to place their students in camp for just one week.

1773
02:29:57,791 --> 02:29:58,331
[SPEAKER_10]: We hope they do.

1774
02:29:58,351 --> 02:30:01,653
[SPEAKER_07]: But they do that for one week and then go to the camp.

1775
02:30:01,833 --> 02:30:06,695
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying that because it's free, it definitely stands out.

1776
02:30:07,756 --> 02:30:10,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, thank you for providing us with all this information.

1777
02:30:11,317 --> 02:30:12,338
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

1778
02:30:12,358 --> 02:30:12,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Mrs. DiBenedetto.

1779
02:30:13,869 --> 02:30:19,635
[SPEAKER_06]: So I noticed that you're moving the summer fund program from the Columbus School to the high school.

1780
02:30:19,795 --> 02:30:20,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1781
02:30:20,856 --> 02:30:24,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that going to affect the program in any way?

1782
02:30:26,785 --> 02:30:30,609
[SPEAKER_10]: So the reason behind that is accessibility to the pool.

1783
02:30:31,289 --> 02:30:32,951
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's the only school with a pool.

1784
02:30:33,171 --> 02:30:36,434
[SPEAKER_10]: And now that we have a pool, we want to use it.

1785
02:30:36,454 --> 02:30:37,174
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's the summer.

1786
02:30:37,275 --> 02:30:39,557
[SPEAKER_10]: And we thought that would be the best place.

1787
02:30:40,177 --> 02:30:42,319
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've talked about the summer programs.

1788
02:30:42,399 --> 02:30:43,720
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't see any drawbacks.

1789
02:30:44,021 --> 02:30:46,763
[SPEAKER_10]: There are going to be a lot of people at Medford High School.

1790
02:30:46,863 --> 02:30:51,307
[SPEAKER_10]: But we've coordinated these programs so that they don't interfere with each other.

1791
02:30:52,208 --> 02:30:53,489
[SPEAKER_10]: We see an upside to this.

1792
02:30:53,509 --> 02:31:03,458
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, we'll evaluate it and if there is a downside and we determine that it doesn't work at Medford High School, then next year it would be at another location.

1793
02:31:03,858 --> 02:31:08,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I know that the students have walked in the past from the Columbus to Tufts pool.

1794
02:31:09,063 --> 02:31:12,045
[SPEAKER_06]: So for safety reasons, that's always great.

1795
02:31:12,185 --> 02:31:19,971
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as the children still get enough outside time, because I know the tough school, it was weather related because it was an outside pool.

1796
02:31:20,311 --> 02:31:28,457
[SPEAKER_06]: So they might get more exercise and more swim time, but as long as they get outside and use the fields and stuff like that, that's really important as well.

1797
02:31:29,018 --> 02:31:29,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1798
02:31:29,398 --> 02:31:30,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information.

1799
02:31:30,439 --> 02:31:32,660
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information, Mrs. Cuno.

1800
02:31:32,780 --> 02:31:36,183
[SPEAKER_11]: They will still have the same type of curriculum because they'll be using the field.

1801
02:31:38,163 --> 02:31:45,945
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess my concern was also just the change because I really kind of like the idea of being on the Tufts pool outside.

1802
02:31:45,965 --> 02:31:48,725
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess there's always pros and cons to everything.

1803
02:31:50,005 --> 02:31:54,306
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, you know, at the elementary school there was a playground and stuff like that.

1804
02:31:54,406 --> 02:32:00,568
[SPEAKER_07]: So it changes the nature, again, whether it's a positive or negative, I'm not quite sure.

1805
02:32:02,435 --> 02:32:08,900
[SPEAKER_10]: So we will, we will evaluate that and we will see how it goes and get feedback from the parents.

1806
02:32:08,920 --> 02:32:11,182
[SPEAKER_19]: Anthony Petrellis.

1807
02:32:11,602 --> 02:32:20,049
[SPEAKER_19]: I've talked to Mr. Mr. Petrellis, the director of the program, and you know, he, he, he reached out to me with my background in recreation.

1808
02:32:20,189 --> 02:32:31,378
[SPEAKER_19]: And when we founded it years ago, his, his philosophies using what's there, even if we have the playground apparatus, if there were younger kids at the, um,

1809
02:32:32,318 --> 02:32:35,881
[SPEAKER_19]: at the high school, but he didn't think that was an issue.

1810
02:32:35,921 --> 02:32:52,753
[SPEAKER_19]: He says having them in a safer area, not doing the walk, having the pool open, the fields accessible to them, the gym space being larger, I think it all falls into

1811
02:32:54,096 --> 02:32:57,957
[SPEAKER_19]: to what we're looking for, for a safe environment for our kids.

1812
02:32:58,037 --> 02:33:07,801
[SPEAKER_15]: And also, if I could just mention really quick too, it gives, I think, by moving up to the high school, it also gives the Columbus the opportunity to be properly maintained during the summer.

1813
02:33:07,841 --> 02:33:16,203
[SPEAKER_15]: Because if it's not, I mean, if you have the program at the Columbus, you really, there's minimal time to get that school back in shape before it's online again for the school year.

1814
02:33:16,303 --> 02:33:19,745
[SPEAKER_19]: And I believe in the promotion of the pool, having over 150 kids there.

1815
02:33:21,405 --> 02:33:28,652
[SPEAKER_19]: We're using that pool with no limitations in the sense that now they can see what we have and more kids will go to that area.

1816
02:33:28,692 --> 02:33:28,732
[SPEAKER_19]: So.

1817
02:33:29,293 --> 02:33:29,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1818
02:33:29,974 --> 02:33:30,674
[SPEAKER_19]: Very curious.

1819
02:33:31,335 --> 02:33:33,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, I just, I appreciate the conversation.

1820
02:33:33,737 --> 02:33:35,599
[SPEAKER_07]: That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

1821
02:33:35,639 --> 02:33:35,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and.

1822
02:33:36,460 --> 02:33:51,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a point of information again, I know that in the past years because the, you know, our summers have had a lot of days that it's been raining, students do lose out on actually taking advantage of going out because they can't go out in the rain.

1823
02:33:51,366 --> 02:33:54,467
[SPEAKER_11]: So, sorry, but they can't not only go out in the rain,

1824
02:33:55,630 --> 02:34:00,175
[SPEAKER_11]: to the park but they can't get to the pool either because it is, you know, it is out there.

1825
02:34:00,476 --> 02:34:10,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas we have the indoor pool and it's better so that way they're not getting sunburned if we, you know, if it's really hot and they're not losing out on the activity because of the weather.

1826
02:34:11,408 --> 02:34:11,688
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1827
02:34:11,708 --> 02:34:12,489
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. DiBenedetto.

1828
02:34:13,730 --> 02:34:17,793
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted, well, first thing I was going to talk about is the maintenance at the Columbus.

1829
02:34:17,833 --> 02:34:20,075
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm glad that school is getting a little bit of a break.

1830
02:34:20,115 --> 02:34:30,543
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there are other programs being run out of that, out of that school, the special education programs are still going to be, I'm assuming in that program.

1831
02:34:31,743 --> 02:34:34,025
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but it does deserve a break.

1832
02:34:34,105 --> 02:34:37,428
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's been used, you know, quite often in,

1833
02:34:38,068 --> 02:34:41,531
[SPEAKER_06]: quite a bit, and this does give it the chance it needs.

1834
02:34:42,612 --> 02:34:47,555
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, I just wanted to comment on the Summer Fund program in general.

1835
02:34:48,316 --> 02:34:49,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's an excellent program.

1836
02:34:50,357 --> 02:35:04,968
[SPEAKER_06]: It's priced extremely affordable, and I think it has a really important need within our community that really helps our parents that have to go to work to have a safe place for their children.

1837
02:35:05,340 --> 02:35:17,949
[SPEAKER_06]: and that they're really, they're learning swimming, they're outside, they're well cared for, and it's $145 a week, which is well below what other camps cost our families.

1838
02:35:18,330 --> 02:35:22,673
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm really grateful to have this for our families in our community.

1839
02:35:23,173 --> 02:35:23,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1840
02:35:24,214 --> 02:35:26,316
[SPEAKER_10]: If I could just, um, just clarify something.

1841
02:35:26,336 --> 02:35:30,720
[SPEAKER_10]: The special ed cam program this year is taking place at the Roberts elementary school.

1842
02:35:31,080 --> 02:35:32,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's being moved as well.

1843
02:35:32,181 --> 02:35:34,023
[SPEAKER_10]: So the Roberts is getting a big break.

1844
02:35:34,464 --> 02:35:34,904
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yes.

1845
02:35:35,044 --> 02:35:36,606
[SPEAKER_10]: So I, so I just wanted to clarify that.

1846
02:35:38,950 --> 02:35:39,470
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Scott Pellett.

1847
02:35:39,690 --> 02:35:42,491
[SPEAKER_19]: No, just again, just clarification.

1848
02:35:42,631 --> 02:35:46,972
[SPEAKER_19]: Are there any special ed programs that are working together with the summer program?

1849
02:35:46,992 --> 02:35:53,994
[SPEAKER_19]: I know we did a lot of that and it really helped financially for both outside placement offering that type of program.

1850
02:35:54,554 --> 02:35:55,094
[SPEAKER_19]: How does that look?

1851
02:35:55,114 --> 02:35:56,814
[SPEAKER_10]: You mean through the community schools program?

1852
02:35:56,994 --> 02:35:58,215
[SPEAKER_19]: Through the summertime program.

1853
02:35:58,255 --> 02:36:07,797
[SPEAKER_19]: I know we had a lot of the special needs programs, uh, working conjunction with the summertime to, to offset any of the, um, you know,

1854
02:36:08,999 --> 02:36:12,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Not to my knowledge, but I certainly will follow up on that.

1855
02:36:13,502 --> 02:36:18,605
[SPEAKER_10]: So my understanding is that the special ed students are, that they're in that special ed program.

1856
02:36:18,645 --> 02:36:27,390
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's not to say that special ed students, that special ed program is for students whose IEP specifies that they need to have that 11 month placement.

1857
02:36:27,430 --> 02:36:31,212
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're going to have special ed students that are in the regular summer program.

1858
02:36:32,373 --> 02:36:34,474
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe that's where the disconnect is.

1859
02:36:34,494 --> 02:36:38,935
[SPEAKER_10]: So yes, there will be special ed students in the summer fund program.

1860
02:36:38,955 --> 02:36:41,616
[SPEAKER_19]: They will automatically be enrolled in that program.

1861
02:36:41,676 --> 02:36:42,336
[SPEAKER_10]: If they choose.

1862
02:36:42,496 --> 02:36:43,516
[SPEAKER_19]: If they need to, right?

1863
02:36:43,616 --> 02:36:43,976
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1864
02:36:44,136 --> 02:36:44,396
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.

1865
02:36:44,796 --> 02:36:56,320
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the other piece of this is you don't say it enough, because I know my colleague, Mr. Benedetto, has talked about the promotion of who we have.

1866
02:36:56,940 --> 02:36:59,641
[SPEAKER_19]: When you're talking about the teacher of the year, Anthony Petrellis,

1867
02:37:02,345 --> 02:37:05,048
[SPEAKER_19]: I had the opportunity to mentor him years ago.

1868
02:37:05,789 --> 02:37:14,718
[SPEAKER_19]: And we often talk now with recreational interactions with what we're doing with my full-time position.

1869
02:37:14,939 --> 02:37:18,402
[SPEAKER_19]: And I will tell you, he is a jewel.

1870
02:37:18,763 --> 02:37:22,246
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that sometimes you overlook

1871
02:37:23,594 --> 02:37:25,096
[SPEAKER_19]: What he does in the classroom is amazing.

1872
02:37:25,216 --> 02:37:30,040
[SPEAKER_19]: What he does for that program is one of the reasons why we get the numbers.

1873
02:37:30,220 --> 02:37:36,607
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I think people, myself included as a parent, who had Mr. Petrellis, the comfort level is so high.

1874
02:37:37,921 --> 02:37:42,125
[SPEAKER_19]: It's such a high level that it's easy just to bring him in no matter what the price was.

1875
02:37:42,165 --> 02:37:47,670
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, people have to know the people that are running these programs are who they are.

1876
02:37:47,751 --> 02:37:51,694
[SPEAKER_19]: They're pretty amazing, as well as our special ed programs.

1877
02:37:51,774 --> 02:37:57,140
[SPEAKER_19]: I know our other summer programs, our vocational programs, this is amazing.

1878
02:37:57,720 --> 02:37:58,401
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think this is

1879
02:37:59,802 --> 02:38:00,703
[SPEAKER_19]: Well done.

1880
02:38:00,983 --> 02:38:04,606
[SPEAKER_10]: So Anthony Petrella's name is not in the report, and it probably should be.

1881
02:38:04,626 --> 02:38:11,591
[SPEAKER_10]: However, his name is on the website, so that the flyer that is posted does identify him as the director of the summer program for him.

1882
02:38:11,931 --> 02:38:13,392
[SPEAKER_19]: So we have to champion this.

1883
02:38:13,852 --> 02:38:17,715
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'd like to get, if we can, to the superintendent having a conversation.

1884
02:38:17,735 --> 02:38:21,017
[SPEAKER_19]: I know he's not too... He's very...

1885
02:38:22,703 --> 02:38:52,030
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm embarrassed if I brought this up, but the change in his life and what he's being asked across the state and what they're asking him to do because of this award, I think has to be championed from this committee, because that just shows one of our teachers, where he's being asked to teach at the collegiate level now in higher education and where he's going for different conferences, and again, that's

1886
02:38:53,251 --> 02:38:57,535
[SPEAKER_19]: He didn't just win the Teacher of the Year and get a check and then go to a basketball game.

1887
02:38:57,575 --> 02:39:00,819
[SPEAKER_19]: He's doing so much more in education because of that award.

1888
02:39:01,179 --> 02:39:04,523
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we need to get more information so people can know what he's doing.

1889
02:39:04,563 --> 02:39:05,524
[SPEAKER_19]: So, thank you.

1890
02:39:06,445 --> 02:39:07,246
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. Cuno.

1891
02:39:08,547 --> 02:39:13,372
[SPEAKER_11]: What my colleagues have said is absolutely, I mean, true.

1892
02:39:14,905 --> 02:39:27,602
[SPEAKER_11]: The summertime program was something that, it was like a baby when I first started, and I know myself and Brianna Longo and George, but no matter what programs we bring,

1893
02:39:28,839 --> 02:39:35,588
[SPEAKER_11]: forward, if it's not for the people that are actually working in those programs, they would never be as successful as they are.

1894
02:39:36,129 --> 02:39:46,923
[SPEAKER_11]: And it is very important to know, you know, when you have Teacher of the Year or you have different opportunities, it's just wonderful to know that when they have those opportunities and they are going to the conferences,

1895
02:39:47,323 --> 02:39:48,884
[SPEAKER_11]: you bring Medford to the table.

1896
02:39:49,644 --> 02:39:56,847
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a difference of just talking about it than rather than just sitting at the table and representing your city.

1897
02:39:57,187 --> 02:40:04,610
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, to Anthony and to everyone for that particular program, it was near and dear to my heart.

1898
02:40:04,770 --> 02:40:10,392
[SPEAKER_11]: So not that the other ones aren't, but this one here, I rolled up my sleeves and walked.

1899
02:40:12,413 --> 02:40:14,034
[SPEAKER_11]: it's been very, very successful.

1900
02:40:14,354 --> 02:40:24,897
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, like talking about the programs that Heidi was talking about tonight, those were the piggyback programs that we were talking about because we had seen how successful these were.

1901
02:40:25,437 --> 02:40:29,578
[SPEAKER_11]: We have seen what the community is asking for and what we really need.

1902
02:40:30,098 --> 02:40:41,022
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm hoping that these programs that we have, we've added a couple this year, and I'm hoping that by next year we'll add even more because it is something that our community is looking for.

1903
02:40:41,482 --> 02:40:41,882
[SPEAKER_11]: And again,

1904
02:40:42,382 --> 02:40:46,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Our community is not asking for everything to be free, but affordable.

1905
02:40:46,445 --> 02:40:53,509
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we could provide those programs, especially in the summertime, and we have a place for our students to go, there's nothing better than that.

1906
02:40:54,850 --> 02:40:56,991
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1907
02:40:58,112 --> 02:41:02,195
[SPEAKER_19]: I think a lot of credit, I had a conversation with Mr. Belson about eight years ago.

1908
02:41:03,055 --> 02:41:10,882
[SPEAKER_19]: And Mr. Belson said, one of the things he said to me was that he's done, in our eyes, he's done so much in this field.

1909
02:41:11,042 --> 02:41:20,610
[SPEAKER_19]: And he said, really looking at the community school piece and getting education, bringing it out, and making that a success is a big piece of his plan.

1910
02:41:21,070 --> 02:41:22,611
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to commend you, Roy, because you know what?

1911
02:41:23,812 --> 02:41:27,573
[SPEAKER_19]: Unfortunately, our city doesn't have a full time recreation program.

1912
02:41:28,213 --> 02:41:39,455
[SPEAKER_19]: And the work that you put in this and the opportunity that you've given to our coaches, our teachers, our vocational school to do what we're doing now is for our children.

1913
02:41:39,915 --> 02:41:45,416
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's something that I've heard over and over next door, but now they're coming back.

1914
02:41:45,596 --> 02:41:47,177
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's a lot to do with that.

1915
02:41:47,257 --> 02:41:53,278
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just want to commend you as what you do completely is impressive, so thank you.

1916
02:41:55,059 --> 02:42:04,125
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to, actually, I can tell you it's a fine program.

1917
02:42:04,165 --> 02:42:06,126
[SPEAKER_15]: My kids actually go to the summertime fun program.

1918
02:42:06,146 --> 02:42:07,707
[SPEAKER_15]: They have a great time every year.

1919
02:42:07,727 --> 02:42:08,668
[SPEAKER_15]: They really enjoy it.

1920
02:42:08,928 --> 02:42:09,988
[SPEAKER_15]: Can't beat the cost.

1921
02:42:10,028 --> 02:42:11,309
[SPEAKER_15]: And they have a lot of fun.

1922
02:42:11,509 --> 02:42:13,070
[SPEAKER_15]: And they've met a lot of friends through it as well.

1923
02:42:13,931 --> 02:42:19,414
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as, so at the end of the summer, do we do any type of,

1924
02:42:20,912 --> 02:42:25,619
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you do any type of communication with parents just to get their evaluation of how they felt the camp was?

1925
02:42:25,639 --> 02:42:28,884
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that would be interesting to see if there's anything that we can add, anything we can do differently.

1926
02:42:28,904 --> 02:42:33,572
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know that we do, but it certainly can be done.

1927
02:42:36,008 --> 02:42:39,752
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it'd be nice to reach out to the parents to actually see if there are ways to improve.

1928
02:42:59,073 --> 02:43:01,495
[SPEAKER_15]: It's already a great program, but it's good to see.

1929
02:43:01,615 --> 02:43:14,689
[SPEAKER_15]: And actually, would it be possible at the end of the summer, actually probably in September, just to get like a follow-up report on each of these programs, just to see, just update us on the good things or if there's anything that needs to be addressed?

1930
02:43:14,709 --> 02:43:16,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, we'll do it.

1931
02:43:16,691 --> 02:43:17,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1932
02:43:17,612 --> 02:43:18,593
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other questions from the committee?

1933
02:43:19,853 --> 02:43:20,793
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much.

1934
02:43:20,813 --> 02:43:21,354

[SPEAKER_15]: You're welcome.

1937
02:43:22,434 --> 02:43:27,676
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Mr. Scarpelli that the report on summer programs be accepted and placed on file.

1938
02:43:27,696 --> 02:43:28,376
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1939
02:43:28,396 --> 02:43:28,456
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1940
02:43:28,536 --> 02:43:29,036

1942
02:43:31,077 --> 02:43:33,738

1956
02:44:26,014 --> 02:44:27,576
[SPEAKER_15]: We all please rise for a moment of silence.

1957
02:44:46,458 --> 02:44:48,200
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Superintendent, I believe you have a few announcements?

1958
02:44:48,400 --> 02:44:53,606
[SPEAKER_18]: There are a few items that I just want to cover with you, just so we're aware of them.

1959
02:44:53,766 --> 02:44:58,350
[SPEAKER_18]: I've given you some papers, just for your information, on the hot water heater at Columbus.

1960
02:44:59,151 --> 02:45:01,473
[SPEAKER_18]: We have it basically.

1961
02:45:02,467 --> 02:45:05,848
[SPEAKER_18]: We did do some repairs on that, but the repairs are not holding.

1962
02:45:06,428 --> 02:45:10,990
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're going to have to work with the procurement officer to replace that as soon as possible.

1963
02:45:11,010 --> 02:45:17,933
[SPEAKER_18]: But in the next few days, there may be some need to use sanitizer and other things of that type until we can get it actually done.

1964
02:45:19,953 --> 02:45:24,955
[SPEAKER_18]: You have a paper in hand with regard to an investigation that we're underway.

1965

[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not going to talk about it, but you've got the paper there.

1966
02:45:30,107 --> 02:45:38,697
[SPEAKER_18]: The indicated minutes from the other night will be forthcoming very quickly, but we wanted to make sure I get back to each of you so that you can be properly recorded as to what your positions were.

1967
02:45:38,717 --> 02:45:43,162
[SPEAKER_18]: There was so much going on that evening that I took notes, but I'm not sure I got everybody's.

02:45:44,278 --> 02:45:50,979

1974
02:46:27,169 --> 02:46:28,450
[SPEAKER_07]: May 7th, do you have it?

1975
02:46:28,771 --> 02:46:30,252
[SPEAKER_07]: No, May 8th.

1976
02:46:30,292 --> 02:46:30,893

02:46:31,313 --> 02:46:33,455
[SPEAKER_14]: Thursday night at 7 PM.

1978
02:46:33,515 --> 02:46:36,358
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what was in our packet the last time.

1979
02:46:36,778 --> 02:46:37,679
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was changed.

1980
02:46:38,079 --> 02:46:38,960
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, it's changed again?

1981
02:46:39,200 --> 02:46:39,401
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1982
02:46:39,661 --> 02:46:45,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, no, Roy, that's what was in our packet when you gave it to us at our last school committee meeting.

1983
02:46:45,987 --> 02:46:49,009
[SPEAKER_07]: We each had a letter, and it said Thursday, May 8th.

1984
02:46:50,378 --> 02:46:50,979
[SPEAKER_07]: And the 11th.

1985
02:46:51,019 --> 02:46:53,461
[SPEAKER_18]: I will check that out and get back to you.

1986
02:46:53,501 --> 02:46:53,981

[SPEAKER_07]: Thursday.

1990
02:46:57,324 --> 02:46:57,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Thursday.

1991
02:46:57,725 --> 02:46:57,825
[SPEAKER_07]: 7th.

1992
02:46:57,845 --> 02:46:57,925
[SPEAKER_07]: 7th.

1993
02:46:57,945 --> 02:47:02,729
[SPEAKER_11]: May 7th is National Honor Society.

1994
02:47:02,990 --> 02:47:03,210
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1995
02:47:03,610 --> 02:47:04,711
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what we're saying.

1996
02:47:04,871 --> 02:47:06,313
[SPEAKER_15]: I will check that out and be sure.

1997
02:47:06,898 --> 02:47:08,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1998
02:47:08,678 --> 02:47:13,320
[SPEAKER_07]: So Roy, in terms of dates, you had the school council reports on the 11th.

1999
02:47:13,360 --> 02:47:14,560
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to clarify that now.

2000
02:47:14,860 --> 02:47:15,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2001
02:47:15,200 --> 02:47:15,640
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2002
02:47:15,980 --> 02:47:19,201
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, so I get to get the national on site because I have a different date in my book.

2003
02:47:19,221 --> 02:47:22,282
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm going to get that out.

2004
02:47:22,302 --> 02:47:22,522
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2005
02:47:22,542 --> 02:47:24,682
[SPEAKER_18]: May 13th school council reports.

2006
02:47:25,783 --> 02:47:26,383
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a meeting.

2007
02:47:27,983 --> 02:47:28,523
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't schedule.

2008
02:47:28,543 --> 02:47:29,283
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no dates.

2009
02:47:29,323 --> 02:47:31,284
[SPEAKER_07]: But you changed it from the 11th, which was fine.

2010
02:47:32,484 --> 02:47:33,424
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's continue.

2011
02:47:33,504 --> 02:47:34,605
[SPEAKER_18]: I had other conflicts.

2012
02:47:34,765 --> 02:47:35,905
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's continue.

2013
02:47:37,483 --> 02:47:40,864
[SPEAKER_18]: May 20th, we're looking at before school programs.

2014
02:47:40,884 --> 02:47:43,945
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be talking about our initiative of before school programs.

2015
02:47:43,985 --> 02:47:45,125
[SPEAKER_18]: Diane's been working on that.

2016
02:47:47,026 --> 02:47:52,328
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm looking at May 25th and May 26th for meetings, committee of the halls.

2017
02:47:53,768 --> 02:47:55,228
[SPEAKER_18]: One to deal with tech and SPED.

2018
02:47:55,248 --> 02:47:56,309
[SPEAKER_13]: May 25th you said?

2019
02:47:56,329 --> 02:47:56,549
[SPEAKER_13]: May 25th.

2020
02:47:56,569 --> 02:47:56,889
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.

2021
02:48:02,845 --> 02:48:03,545
[SPEAKER_18]: Isn't that what?

2022
02:48:03,645 --> 02:48:04,605
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't that Memorial Day?

2023
02:48:04,865 --> 02:48:05,926
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, not May 26th.

2024
02:48:05,966 --> 02:48:07,626
[SPEAKER_18]: May 26th and 27th, I'm sorry.

2025
02:48:08,326 --> 02:48:09,306
[SPEAKER_18]: We're working fast.

2026
02:48:09,466 --> 02:48:10,567
[SPEAKER_13]: So, 26th and 27th?

2027
02:48:10,607 --> 02:48:11,767
[SPEAKER_18]: 26th and 27th, yeah.

2028
02:48:11,787 --> 02:48:13,027
[SPEAKER_13]: What are you thinking of doing?

2029
02:48:13,367 --> 02:48:18,709
[SPEAKER_18]: One, having a committee of the whole on technology and sped together, you know, different things like that.

2030
02:48:18,729 --> 02:48:23,790
[SPEAKER_18]: So, instead of being in here, because those things are a little bit more complicated and a little more give and take.

2031
02:48:25,967 --> 02:48:32,632
[SPEAKER_18]: And then maybe that week also having one on the public relations issue that you want to talk about.

2032
02:48:32,712 --> 02:48:33,392
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't work.

2033
02:48:33,412 --> 02:48:35,454
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why I'm putting dates out and I want to get feedback.

2034
02:48:35,494 --> 02:48:36,815
[SPEAKER_11]: So what do you have for the 27th?

2035
02:48:37,195 --> 02:48:37,395
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

2036
02:48:37,775 --> 02:48:39,036
[SPEAKER_15]: No, is there a meeting on the 27th?

2037
02:48:39,176 --> 02:48:40,757
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you say the 27th also?

2038
02:48:41,017 --> 02:48:41,238
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2039
02:48:41,258 --> 02:48:43,039
[SPEAKER_15]: So what are we doing on the 27th?

2040
02:48:44,444 --> 02:48:50,108
[SPEAKER_15]: If I may really quick, so with regard to technology and spending, is that one meeting or two?

2041
02:48:50,428 --> 02:48:51,309
[SPEAKER_15]: That's one meeting.

2042
02:48:51,389 --> 02:48:52,610
[SPEAKER_18]: On the 26th.

2043
02:48:52,790 --> 02:48:53,510
[SPEAKER_18]: 26th, I think.

2044
02:48:53,830 --> 02:48:56,492
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, it could flip either way, whatever works.

2045
02:48:56,532 --> 02:48:59,774
[SPEAKER_18]: Public relations would be on the other day if we can do it.

2046
02:48:59,835 --> 02:49:05,939
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, again, I'm asking you about data because I've got to try and work it all in because there's a million things going on that we're

2047
02:49:06,779 --> 02:49:07,959
[SPEAKER_18]: involved in as well.

2048
02:49:07,979 --> 02:49:09,960
[SPEAKER_18]: If I can.

2049
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:11,241
[SPEAKER_19]: Could you send us those?

2050
02:49:11,681 --> 02:49:11,861
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

2051
02:49:11,881 --> 02:49:14,862
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, and just, and just then we can get back to you.

2052
02:49:15,102 --> 02:49:16,802
[SPEAKER_19]: Those should be actually stolen, what I'm just saying.

2053
02:49:16,822 --> 02:49:18,583
[SPEAKER_19]: Just send us those and then that's it.

2054
02:49:18,623 --> 02:49:21,864
[SPEAKER_18]: The Curtis Tufts graduation is coming in here.

2055
02:49:22,004 --> 02:49:24,645
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure what the date on that yet.

2056
02:49:24,705 --> 02:49:25,945
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll get you that date as well.

2057
02:49:26,325 --> 02:49:27,786
[SPEAKER_18]: High school graduation is June 4th.

2058
02:49:29,024 --> 02:49:30,104
[SPEAKER_18]: We got that, okay?

2059
02:49:30,224 --> 02:49:34,765
[SPEAKER_18]: Our next meeting is May 18th, the next formal meeting in here.

2060
02:49:34,965 --> 02:49:42,507
[SPEAKER_18]: And at that time, or next week, I'll be sending you materials on my evaluation and contract negotiations.

2061
02:49:43,307 --> 02:49:45,887
[SPEAKER_18]: So you'll have a chance to look at that and you'll be able to respond to that.

2062
02:49:45,947 --> 02:49:48,608
[SPEAKER_18]: Because of that evening, I would think we have some discussion on that.

2063
02:49:49,328 --> 02:49:53,229
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we meeting, all the meetings as a whole, are we all starting that at 7 o'clock?

2064
02:49:54,829 --> 02:49:56,730
[SPEAKER_18]: Most of them start at 7 unless you want to change the time.

2065
02:49:56,750 --> 02:49:57,830
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm just double checking.

2066
02:49:59,094 --> 02:50:01,735
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, you may know the state budget.

2067
02:50:02,535 --> 02:50:08,298
[SPEAKER_18]: It's being heard at the state house by different groups now.

2068
02:50:08,318 --> 02:50:11,799
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a lot of committee meetings and testimonies and hearing going on.

2069
02:50:12,319 --> 02:50:13,880
[SPEAKER_18]: The house has passed a budget.

2070
02:50:14,420 --> 02:50:18,441
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a little bit better for us than the governor's budget.

2071
02:50:18,601 --> 02:50:21,403
[SPEAKER_18]: The senate will be producing one in the next couple weeks.

2072
02:50:21,423 --> 02:50:24,964
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be watching that to see how those things play out.

2073
02:50:26,016 --> 02:50:30,011
[SPEAKER_18]: There were park forums all over the place, you know, there was four of those statewide.

2074
02:50:30,834 --> 02:50:31,697
[SPEAKER_18]: We're tracking those.

2075
02:50:33,005 --> 02:50:39,110
[SPEAKER_18]: This week there's also a GBL meeting with the athletic directors talking about possible new league configurations.

2076
02:50:39,130 --> 02:50:40,652
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's a lot of things going on.

2077
02:50:40,672 --> 02:50:45,576
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, that's why I'm saying every day we settle something, there's something else happening.

2078
02:50:45,976 --> 02:50:52,922
[SPEAKER_18]: And of course, we're negotiating with our teachers and all our bargaining units, and they're clamoring for dates to be available to talk.

2079
02:50:52,962 --> 02:50:54,823
[SPEAKER_18]: We had a meeting with the teachers today.

2080
02:50:54,943 --> 02:50:58,286
[SPEAKER_18]: So all those things will be in front of us, but

2081
02:50:59,642 --> 02:51:01,123
[SPEAKER_18]: Some bad dates here, you're going to let me know.

2082
02:51:01,183 --> 02:51:04,406
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll put them out tomorrow again and just let me know.

2083
02:51:04,907 --> 02:51:05,908
[SPEAKER_18]: Our schedule is pretty tight.

2084
02:51:06,788 --> 02:51:19,880
[SPEAKER_18]: And I would think that sometime in June before budget, before the full budget, again, I'm waiting on the mayor to give me some guidance on when he's going to be prepared to go forward with the budget.

2085
02:51:23,233 --> 02:51:30,195
[SPEAKER_18]: But I would think that we would then have a meeting in the US with regard to priorities sometime in early June.

2086
02:51:30,835 --> 02:51:35,016
[SPEAKER_18]: Plus, there's any number of retirement parties and things like that that are going on that are hard.

2087
02:51:35,636 --> 02:51:43,898
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Mr. Belson, can I just clarify that there's no possibility to hold any meeting on Monday?

2088
02:51:44,838 --> 02:51:47,060
[SPEAKER_07]: It was that because you thought it was the National Honor Society?

2089
02:51:47,120 --> 02:51:49,441
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, it conflicts with some other things that are going on.

2090
02:51:49,461 --> 02:51:52,403
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just, I thought it was possible that we would conflict it.

2091
02:51:53,304 --> 02:51:53,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

2092
02:51:53,524 --> 02:51:56,105
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just wondering if we could have this subcommittee at PR on Monday.

2093
02:51:57,746 --> 02:51:58,727
[SPEAKER_18]: Subcommittee on Monday?

2094
02:51:58,967 --> 02:51:59,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2095
02:51:59,588 --> 02:52:00,208
[SPEAKER_18]: On the 11th?

2096
02:52:01,049 --> 02:52:01,289
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

2097
02:52:01,309 --> 02:52:01,949
[SPEAKER_15]: On the 11th you said?

2098
02:52:02,209 --> 02:52:02,690
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 11th.

2099
02:52:03,130 --> 02:52:04,291
[SPEAKER_07]: The only reason I asked-

2100
02:52:05,208 --> 02:52:06,669
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

2101
02:52:07,710 --> 02:52:21,520
[SPEAKER_07]: The only reason I'm asking is we had that date set aside and now, and I asked for that meeting months ago and now it would be thrown into a week where we already would have multiple meetings.

2102
02:52:22,020 --> 02:52:26,643
[SPEAKER_07]: It would make more sense if there is no other conflict to do it on Monday.

2103
02:52:27,764 --> 02:52:29,686
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll be happy to do it if you're prepared to do it.

2104
02:52:29,726 --> 02:52:30,186
[SPEAKER_18]: That works for me.

2105
02:52:31,033 --> 02:52:35,835
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll schedule a subcommittee meeting of PR on the 11th, okay?

2106
02:52:40,497 --> 02:52:44,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now there's nothing on the 27th.

2107
02:52:45,479 --> 02:52:49,860
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we can hold it in reserve just to be sure there's something else you want to do.

2108
02:52:49,920 --> 02:52:53,762
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, there's so many things you want to do, as you can see from all the good things going on.

2109
02:52:55,297 --> 02:52:56,097
[SPEAKER_18]: When do we schedule it?

2110
02:52:56,137 --> 02:53:00,999
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, we certainly want to schedule a night sometime down the road to talk about the high school and the accreditation.

2111
02:53:01,179 --> 02:53:03,239
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, you may have other things you want to talk about, too.

2112
02:53:03,279 --> 02:53:08,601
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, I'm just trying to work it all in, but I want to be respectful of your calendars because you've got a lot of things, too.

2113
02:53:09,561 --> 02:53:11,802
[SPEAKER_18]: But every day there's a bump on something, you know.

2114
02:53:12,582 --> 02:53:21,444
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, the other thing I was going to talk about, we talked about it briefly, Beverly mentioned it briefly, which was the issue with regard to the council reports, okay?

2115
02:53:22,345 --> 02:53:23,285
[SPEAKER_18]: School council reports.

2116
02:53:24,380 --> 02:53:25,744
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to try a format.

2117
02:53:25,885 --> 02:53:27,691
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to cooperate to try a format.

2118
02:53:27,951 --> 02:53:30,821
[SPEAKER_18]: The format is that you read these reports carefully.

2119
02:53:31,632 --> 02:53:37,674
[SPEAKER_18]: list whatever questions you want to list instead of having a principal come in and read you everything that you can read yourself.

2120
02:53:38,755 --> 02:53:45,257
[SPEAKER_18]: And then, you know, we'll go around the room and we'll take 10, 15 minutes on the report, but you ask the questions and we'll get it.

2121
02:53:45,277 --> 02:53:54,381
[SPEAKER_18]: And then at the end of those reports or those questions, we'll then take like 15, 20 minutes to go over any kind of common threads or half an hour to go over common threads.

2122
02:53:54,781 --> 02:53:56,982
[SPEAKER_18]: That way we'll get through the meeting in a couple of hours.

2123
02:53:57,825 --> 02:54:02,709
[SPEAKER_18]: rather than be there for four hours, as people read you everything you could read yourself.

2124
02:54:03,430 --> 02:54:06,092
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's the idea behind it, to try it as a format.

2125
02:54:06,132 --> 02:54:08,073
[SPEAKER_18]: If it works, that's a good way to go.

2126
02:54:09,174 --> 02:54:13,538
[SPEAKER_18]: If you find something that's really pressing, that you really feel you have to talk about, well, that's a different matter.

2127
02:54:13,918 --> 02:54:14,179
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay?

2128
02:54:15,460 --> 02:54:16,020
[SPEAKER_14]: That work?

2129
02:54:16,400 --> 02:54:16,721
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds good.

2130
02:54:16,741 --> 02:54:18,082
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2131
02:54:18,302 --> 02:54:20,484
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to adjourn, Mr. Chairman.

2132
02:54:20,644 --> 02:54:23,746
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Mr. Skerry to adjourn, seconded by Mrs. Di Benedetto.

2133
02:54:23,806 --> 02:54:24,547
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

2134
02:54:24,627 --> 02:54:24,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

2135
02:54:24,947 --> 02:54:25,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Opposed?

2136
02:54:25,968 --> 02:54:26,589
[SPEAKER_15]: Meeting adjourned.
