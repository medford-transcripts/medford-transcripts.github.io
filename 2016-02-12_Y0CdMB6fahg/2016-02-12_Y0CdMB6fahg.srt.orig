1
00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:04,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, I'm Jocelyn McCarthy with the Mustang Report, here with the left shark, who just moved back to Medford.

2
00:00:05,095 --> 00:00:06,856
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you think the Super Bowl went this year?

3
00:00:06,876 --> 00:00:08,097
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was pretty good.

4
00:00:08,117 --> 00:00:12,000
[SPEAKER_08]: It was, um, Beyonce killed it, of course, but I think it was missing some sharks.

5
00:00:13,101 --> 00:00:15,503
[SPEAKER_08]: How's your new home at the MHS pool?

6
00:00:16,023 --> 00:00:17,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it's nice and warm.

7
00:00:17,524 --> 00:00:28,693
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really nice, but, you know, I don't like, I don't know, the swim, the swim team, they're all really skinny, so it doesn't really help me, so I'm hoping that, like, um, some more people come swimming so I can have some more food.

8
00:00:30,247 --> 00:00:32,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember MHS, fish are friends, not food.

9
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:34,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the Mustang Report.

10
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:37,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, I'm Joss McCarthy with the Mustang Report.

11
00:00:37,713 --> 00:00:41,756
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here with Frank D'Alessio talking about his role at Meffitt High School.

12
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:44,300
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:53,245
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the district technology specialist for Meffitt High School, and my role here is to take care of all of the PCs that are in the district.

14
00:00:53,265 --> 00:01:06,553
[SPEAKER_00]: There's currently about 1,100 of them in the district, so there's a help desk, and when a call comes in the help desk, I take it, I look at what the problem is, and I go to the teachers or to the school, and then I repair that.

15
00:01:07,414 --> 00:01:09,655
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we put it back into its normal operation.

16
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:12,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

17
00:01:12,081 --> 00:01:14,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you tell me one of your hobbies you like to do?

18
00:01:15,544 --> 00:01:17,906
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, one of the hobbies is I'm a professional bowler.

19
00:01:17,986 --> 00:01:20,508
[SPEAKER_00]: So I average between 200 and 190 and 200.

20
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:25,972
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bowl a couple of nights a week, Sundays and Thursdays.

21
00:01:26,432 --> 00:01:29,314
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing that for probably 57 years.

22
00:01:31,076 --> 00:01:37,561
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now I instruct people on how to bowl, how to hold the ball, because there is a science to holding the ball.

23
00:01:37,621 --> 00:01:40,423
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't want any space between the ball and your fingers or thumb.

24
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you been with the same team for your whole life?

25
00:01:46,494 --> 00:01:48,636
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's different teams.

26
00:01:48,716 --> 00:01:53,100
[SPEAKER_00]: The team I'm on now on Sunday is, well, let's see, is Infinite Power.

27
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:54,942
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one team.

28
00:01:55,242 --> 00:01:56,383
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a group of guys.

29
00:01:56,403 --> 00:01:57,585
[SPEAKER_00]: There's four men on a team.

30
00:01:57,865 --> 00:01:58,946
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be females too.

31
00:01:58,966 --> 00:02:00,107
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mixed league.

32
00:02:01,048 --> 00:02:05,992
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Mustangs, the answer to the question of the week, my middle name is Lee.

33
00:02:06,353 --> 00:02:06,973
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck.

34
00:02:07,154 --> 00:02:08,495
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope somebody got it.

35
00:02:13,093 --> 00:02:16,915
[SPEAKER_07]: The question of the week on the Mustang Report is... What game show has Ms.

36
00:02:16,975 --> 00:02:17,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfoni been on?

37
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:39,319
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm Victoria, the meteorologist here with a Mustang report to let you know it's snowing and it's cold.

38
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:41,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't go outside, this well is for the penguins.

39
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:44,300
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you do go outside, beware of snowballs.

40
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I'm already here at the bar.

41
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:54,312
[SPEAKER_09]: How long are you guys going to be here?

42
00:03:55,553 --> 00:03:55,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Ten minutes?

43
00:03:55,993 --> 00:03:56,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, sounds good.

44
00:03:56,774 --> 00:03:57,795
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll start ordering drinks then.

45
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:58,635
[SPEAKER_09]: See you soon.

46
00:04:01,577 --> 00:04:02,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, how's it going?

47
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:04,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, good, how are you?

48
00:04:04,147 --> 00:04:04,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Good.

49
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:05,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you here alone?

50
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:07,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, yeah, I'm here waiting for my friends.

51
00:04:07,411 --> 00:04:07,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Your friends?

52
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:08,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

53
00:04:08,131 --> 00:04:09,052
[SPEAKER_05]: So, what's your name?

54
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:10,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Gigi.

55
00:04:10,454 --> 00:04:11,335
[SPEAKER_09]: And yours?

56
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:11,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Antonio.

57
00:04:11,955 --> 00:04:12,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, nice.

58
00:04:12,356 --> 00:04:16,621
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, I was thinking, uh, do you want to get a drink?

59
00:04:16,681 --> 00:04:18,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, yeah, that's fine.

60
00:04:18,563 --> 00:04:20,104
[SPEAKER_09]: So, what's your poison?

61
00:04:20,124 --> 00:04:23,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, can I get a gin martini straight up, please?

62
00:04:23,528 --> 00:04:24,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too, me too.

63
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:24,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too.

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:27,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning, straight up.

00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:28,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you go, sir.

66
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

67
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

68
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,221
[SPEAKER_05]: I think your friend's over there.

69
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:34,201
[SPEAKER_09]: My friend's?

70
00:04:36,441 --> 00:04:37,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just check over there, see?

71
00:04:38,002 --> 00:04:39,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I don't think I see them.

72
00:04:39,202 --> 00:04:40,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm mistaken, I'm mistaken.

73
00:04:40,202 --> 00:04:40,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

74
00:04:40,603 --> 00:04:40,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

75
00:04:40,783 --> 00:04:42,323
[SPEAKER_05]: So, bathroom, bathroom, bathroom?

76
00:04:42,363 --> 00:04:45,224
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

77
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:47,324
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I need to go to the bathroom, alright?

78
00:04:47,344 --> 00:04:47,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

79
00:04:47,444 --> 00:04:54,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to notify you to put something in your drink, I'm just going to switch it out for you, alright?

80
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:55,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

81
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:56,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

82
00:04:57,648 --> 00:05:00,489
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna call the cops and by the time he gets back, he'll be arrested.

83
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:01,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, sounds good.

84
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

85
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:03,151
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

86
00:05:03,171 --> 00:05:03,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry about that.

87
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:06,112
[SPEAKER_05]: So, how's the drink?

88
00:05:06,132 --> 00:05:10,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I haven't really tried it yet, you know.

89
00:05:10,995 --> 00:05:11,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

90
00:05:11,215 --> 00:05:13,576
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just waiting for my friends to show up.

91
00:05:13,876 --> 00:05:14,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay, okay.

92
00:05:16,838 --> 00:05:17,338
[SPEAKER_06]: It's alright.

93
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:19,219
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the problem here?

94
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,522
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is, this guy put a suspicious tablet into his drink.

95
00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:28,739
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's going to arrest him because he put drugs in here?

96
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Sir, can you stand up?

97
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:32,681
[SPEAKER_05]: You are under the arrest for drug possession.

98
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:33,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, what?

99
00:05:33,421 --> 00:05:34,502
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you talking about?

100
00:05:34,962 --> 00:05:36,302
[SPEAKER_05]: You have the right to remain silent.

101
00:05:36,463 --> 00:05:39,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything you say or do will be brought against you in the court of law.

102
00:05:40,044 --> 00:05:41,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, residents of Medford.

106
00:05:56,064 --> 00:06:01,968
[SPEAKER_04]: The Elks has been kind enough to donate $2,000 toward a scholarship that will be awarded this spring.

00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:08,994
[SPEAKER_04]: And we want to thank Mary on behalf of all of the students here today for being a member of our community and doing such wonderful things.

[SPEAKER_02]: Carpentry too?

147
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:11,782
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the first carpentry.

148
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:12,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Very impressive.

149
00:08:13,704 --> 00:08:15,126
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to do this weekend?

150
00:08:15,146 --> 00:08:16,727
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to do about this celebration?

151
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,609
[SPEAKER_02]: You going to go up to eat or something?

152
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:19,390
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure.

153
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,972
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't really expect that.

154
00:08:21,012 --> 00:08:21,693
