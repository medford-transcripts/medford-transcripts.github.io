or some other post-secondary opportunities that they may pursue. Medford provides a unique opportunity to pursue a pathway in one of 15 career and technical programs. Our freshman exploratory program is designed to provide students with a sampling of each program before making a choice for grades 10 through 12. As a junior and senior, students will be spending 50% of their time in their program of choice.
