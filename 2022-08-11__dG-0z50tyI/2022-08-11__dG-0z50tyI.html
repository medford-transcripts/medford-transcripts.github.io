    <a href="https://youtu.be/_dG-0z50tyI&t=1.533s">[Fallon]</a>:  Welcome to Medford Vocational Technical High School, a caring group of educators who have a passion for their craft.
 Essentially, Medford Vocational Technical High School is a school within a school at the Medford High School complex.
 Medford Vocational Technical High School is a safe learning environment where we embrace diversity and work together as a learning community to enable students to grow and learn as they prepare for college, a career,
 or some other post-secondary opportunities that they may pursue.
 Medford provides a unique opportunity to pursue a pathway in one of 15 career and technical programs.
 Our freshman exploratory program is designed to provide students with a sampling of each program before making a choice for grades 10 through 12.
 As a junior and senior, students will be spending 50% of their time in their program of choice.
 while also completing all academic requirements for graduation.
 As a senior, students are eligible to participate in our cooperative education program, which enables students to work while in school and earn money as they sharpen their skills with on-the-job training.
 I encourage you to learn more about our programs through our website and reach out if you have any questions or want to learn more about a specific program.
 As you may have seen from some of the many projects in our community, students at Medford Vocational Technical High School have great pride in the work we complete.
 If I can be of any assistance to potential students or parents, I welcome you to reach out directly to me.
 Thank you and welcome to Medford.
