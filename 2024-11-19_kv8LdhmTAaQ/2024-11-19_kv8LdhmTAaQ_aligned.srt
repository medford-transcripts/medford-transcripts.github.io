Good evening, councilmen.

7
00:12:02,494 --> 00:12:03,996
My name is Moses Okokoro.

8
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:06,378
I'm from National Grid Electricity.

9
00:12:06,938 --> 00:12:10,041
My address is 117 Medford Street, Malden.

10
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:19,949
So the purpose for petitioning, signing this petition in, is to provide an electric service to a customer at 87 Medford Street.

11
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:29,077
Basically, we'll be running two four-inch conduit from an existing pole across the sidewalk, heading towards the property, approximately about six feet

12
00:12:30,007 --> 00:12:31,088
You know, caught on the sidewalk.

13
00:12:31,848 --> 00:12:32,548
Yeah, thank you.

14
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:34,910
Thank you.

15
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:35,570
You're welcome.

16
00:12:36,951 --> 00:12:39,792
At this point, I declare the public hearing open.

00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:42,974
Open to all those in favor of the petition.

00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:58,273
Yeah, Moses Okokoro, 170 Medford Street, Malden, from National Grid.

21
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:58,633
Thank you.

22
00:12:58,713 --> 00:13:00,014
And you are in favor of the petition?

23
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:00,574
Yes, I am.

24
00:13:00,794 --> 00:13:01,154
Thank you.

25
00:13:01,174 --> 00:13:01,754
You're welcome.

26
00:13:02,054 --> 00:13:03,095
Anyone else in favor?

27
00:13:03,815 --> 00:13:04,515
Please come forward.

28
00:13:06,196 --> 00:13:08,816
Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

29
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,418
Anyone in opposition of the petition?

30
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:14,798
Anyone in opposition?

31
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,660
Anyone in opposition?

32
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:32,070
Seeing and hearing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

33
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,411
If you could please come forward again.

34
00:13:34,171 --> 00:13:34,531
Thank you.

35
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:39,894
Are there any questions from the council at this point?

36
00:13:45,778 --> 00:13:46,198
Councilor Knight.

37
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:47,905
Mr. President, thank you very much.

38
00:13:48,085 --> 00:13:49,166
Thank you, sir, for being here this evening.

39
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:54,908
Did I hear you correctly when you said that the disruption was going to be along the sidewalk and not on the street?

40
00:13:55,428 --> 00:13:56,628
Yeah, on the sidewalk, yes, sir.

41
00:13:56,688 --> 00:13:57,428
All sidewalk work.

42
00:13:57,448 --> 00:13:57,788
Yes, sir.

43
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:58,709
Thank you very much.

44
00:13:58,989 --> 00:13:59,429
You're welcome.

45
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,910
Councilor Scarpelli.

46
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,251
Simple question to follow up with that.

47
00:14:07,331 --> 00:14:12,853
Again, the sidewalks would be repaired and repaved to

48
00:14:13,828 --> 00:14:15,670
the existing OBETA condition, correct?

49
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,150
Yes, sir.

50
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:16,671
Okay.

51
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:17,972
The contractor will take care of that.

52
00:14:18,432 --> 00:14:18,732
Okay.

53
00:14:18,812 --> 00:14:31,804
And one thing we did have in the past, I think that making sure they follow in the proper timeline, in the past we've had different contractors that have worked for National Grid, not National Grid's fault, but had their

54
00:14:34,601 --> 00:14:40,712
Companies come out at odd hours and one night at 10 o'clock at night we had an issue with this.

55
00:14:40,772 --> 00:14:43,578
Make sure they follow the proper protocol of times.

56
00:14:44,018 --> 00:14:45,100
That would be appreciated.

57
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,643
Okay, thank you.

58
00:14:46,663 --> 00:14:47,164
Okay, thank you.

59
00:14:47,912 --> 00:14:49,133
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

60
00:14:49,433 --> 00:15:04,704
And I just want to make a quick note, and that is that the engineering division did review this application in a, if I'm just going to read further, just that the engineer division recommends that this grant of location be approved with the following conditions.

61
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:10,628
The grant of location is limited to 60, uh, two foot, uh,

62
00:15:11,088 --> 00:15:14,330
Duck Bank is described in the GOL documents as follows.

63
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:27,017
National grid to install beginning at a point approximately 190 feet southeast of the central line of the intersection of Winter Hill Road and continuing approximately two feet in a southwest direction.

64
00:15:27,197 --> 00:15:35,482
National grid to install two to four inches of conduit to riser pole 590, that's 590, to pad 87 located inside the customer's property.

65
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:49,032
Number two, before starting work, the contractor shall notify dig safe and shall obtain all applicable permits from the engineering division.

66
00:15:49,492 --> 00:15:55,758
The project must obtain a street opening permit pursuant to section 74-141 of the city ordinances prior to commencing work.

67
00:16:01,021 --> 00:16:12,104
Number three, no other utility structures, conduits, duct banks, pipes, or any other apparatances are adversely impacted.

68
00:16:12,624 --> 00:16:19,206
National Grid shall ensure that all sewer, water, and drain lines are marked prior to any excavation.

69
00:16:19,806 --> 00:16:23,747
Any disturbed concrete sidewalk panels shall be replaced in kind.

70
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:26,668
Asphalt must be replaced with asphalt.

71
00:16:27,913 --> 00:16:33,666
Number four, installing the proposed conduit will disturb the existing driveway apron for 87 Medford Street.

72
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:41,986
The existing apron has hairline cracking which will worsen with this installation.

73
00:16:42,026 --> 00:16:47,148
The engineering division recommends that the entire driveway apron be removed and replaced.

74
00:16:47,609 --> 00:16:53,092
The new apron shall be six inch depth of concrete and be installed per city standard.

75
00:16:53,852 --> 00:16:58,114
So those are the recommendations from the engineering division.

76
00:16:58,635 --> 00:17:00,856
At this point, I'd recognize Councilor Knight.

77
00:17:01,236 --> 00:17:04,518
Mr. President, motion to adopt the conditions requested by the city engineer.

78
00:17:07,134 --> 00:17:12,056
On the motion of Council Knight, seconded by Councilor Beers, Councilor Scarpelli.

79
00:17:12,176 --> 00:17:13,217
If I can, again, I'm sorry.

80
00:17:13,437 --> 00:17:14,397
How long is this process?

81
00:17:14,477 --> 00:17:16,538
How long is the project gonna take?

82
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:20,060
Well, the process of digging usually is just about a day.

83
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:20,941
They'll open the site.

84
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:21,381
Just one day?

85
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,062
Yes, and then cover, you know, the same day.

86
00:17:23,082 --> 00:17:25,603
Okay, and the neighbors will be informed.

87
00:17:25,843 --> 00:17:26,283
Exactly.

88
00:17:26,303 --> 00:17:27,083
Okay, thank you.

89
00:17:28,364 --> 00:17:28,684
Thank you.

90
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:29,525
You're welcome, sir.

91
00:17:29,545 --> 00:17:30,045
Move approval.

92
00:17:30,245 --> 00:17:30,705
Second that.

93
00:17:33,346 --> 00:17:34,407
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

94
00:17:37,367 --> 00:17:49,131
On the motion of Consulate Knight, seconded by Consulate Beers to approve the paper as adopted, as amended, with the conditions by the Engineering Division.

95
00:17:50,592 --> 00:17:52,512
On that motion, Clerk Urneby, please call the roll.

96
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:53,913
Consulate Beers.

97
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,921
Yes.

98
00:17:56,161 --> 00:17:56,401
Yes.

99
00:17:57,582 --> 00:18:02,447
Yes.

100
00:18:03,848 --> 00:18:04,089
Yes.

101
00:18:04,229 --> 00:18:04,569
Yes.

102
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:05,890
70 affirmative zero in the negative.

103
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:07,272
The paper passes.

104
00:18:07,312 --> 00:18:07,992
Thank you very much.

105
00:18:08,052 --> 00:18:08,413
Thank you.

106
00:18:08,953 --> 00:18:10,134
Have a good night.

107
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,962
Motions, orders and resolutions.

108
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:32,120
Offered by council tonight, be it 20-064, be it resolved that the city administration provide the council with a list of vacant positions funded in the current fiscal year budget.

109
00:18:32,781 --> 00:18:43,328
And be it further resolved that the council be provided with an organizational chart reflecting transitional roles and responsibilities until the aforementioned vacancies are filed.

110
00:18:43,768 --> 00:18:44,668
Councilor Knight.

111
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,889
Mr. President, thank you very much.

112
00:18:47,979 --> 00:18:53,940
We've had much discussion about pre-budget meetings that are going to be coming up, much anticipated pre-budget meetings, I may say.

113
00:18:55,061 --> 00:18:59,722
The question comes to whether or not we have some vacant positions that are available here in the city.

114
00:18:59,782 --> 00:19:02,343
I know the council's been talking about its priorities.

115
00:19:02,383 --> 00:19:03,763
We have a priority meeting tomorrow.

116
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:07,724
One of our number one priorities is getting legal counsel for the city council.

117
00:19:08,544 --> 00:19:11,965
So in an effort to better understand the financial picture here in the community,

118
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,586
and also better prepare ourselves for the budget.

119
00:19:14,826 --> 00:19:28,851
I'm requesting that the city administration provide us with a list of vacant positions that they're looking to fill, as well as a list of the transitional roles and responsibilities that are being covered by whatever department head in the present until such time as those vacancies are filled, Mr. President.

120
00:19:28,871 --> 00:19:42,095
So it's just an effort to gather information so that we can better prepare ourselves for these pre-budget hearings and also make a better case for ourselves to – a better case in terms of what our financial standing is in order to attain legal counsel here for the city council.

121
00:19:42,803 --> 00:19:43,665
Thank you, Consul Knight.

122
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,816
On the motion of Consul Knight, seconded by Consul Scott Pelley.

123
00:19:49,996 --> 00:19:50,838
All those in favor?

124
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:52,160
All those opposed?

125
00:19:54,064 --> 00:19:54,705
The motion passes.

126
00:20:00,905 --> 00:20:15,248
20-065, offered by Vice President Carviello, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request that the DCR install sound devices on the traffic signals at Whole Foods in efforts to help those with sight issues cross the street in a safe way.

127
00:20:15,828 --> 00:20:21,089
Be it further resolved that this be sent to the Office of Diversity and Disability.

128
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,230
Vice President.

129
00:20:25,365 --> 00:20:25,786
Carviello.

130
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:26,747
Thank you Mr. President.

131
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:35,417
Mr. President, this was brought to my attention by someone in the community that has sight disabilities.

132
00:20:35,878 --> 00:20:38,641
And I don't realize, but we have

133
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:48,872
Two housing complexes, both on Walking Court and on Austin Street, that have many disabled people.

134
00:20:49,532 --> 00:20:54,979
And Whole Foods is their place where they go shopping and do most of their work, most of their food things.

135
00:20:56,958 --> 00:21:09,823
I would think that we request that DCR install the sound devices for people that are blind, so they hear when the lights turn, similar to what we have in Method Square.

136
00:21:10,483 --> 00:21:24,508
So, and I also ask that this also be sent to the officer, diversity and disability, and have them also make the request to DCR and Representative Garbally, so we can get this done in the interest of public safety.

137
00:21:25,437 --> 00:21:26,818
Thank you, Vice President Carvello.

138
00:21:27,738 --> 00:21:28,338
Councilor Beers.

139
00:21:28,878 --> 00:21:29,759
Thank you, Mr. President.

140
00:21:29,939 --> 00:21:33,540
And maybe Councilor Carvello can answer.

141
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,721
It says traffic signals at Whole Foods.

142
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:41,163
Do you mean the entire South Street, Auburn Street, Mystic Valley Parkway intersection?

143
00:21:44,964 --> 00:21:45,164
Yeah.

144
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:49,806
I'd just like to amend the paper to name the streets on the intersection, if that's all right.

145
00:21:51,747 --> 00:21:51,847
Yeah.

146
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,602
And also to capitalize Whole Foods if possible.

147
00:21:58,263 --> 00:21:58,543
Okay.

148
00:21:58,563 --> 00:22:03,166
So Councilor Beers would like the streets to be mentioned in the resolution.

149
00:22:06,608 --> 00:22:13,271
In Whole Foods to be capitalized.

150
00:22:13,411 --> 00:22:15,172
Auburn Street in Mystic Valley Parkway.

151
00:22:17,013 --> 00:22:19,655
Is that Auburn on the south side of Mystic Valley as well?

152
00:22:20,425 --> 00:22:21,865
It's Auburn on both sides.

153
00:22:22,145 --> 00:22:22,385
Correct.

154
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:22,805
Yes.

155
00:22:24,946 --> 00:22:25,486
Counselor Knight.

156
00:22:26,426 --> 00:22:31,107
Mr. President, I'd just also like to amend the paper to request that it be sent to the city engineer and traffic engineer.

157
00:22:31,807 --> 00:22:38,948
As we're all well aware, there are various times the state will come to the city to request certain rights away, permits and the like, to get work done.

158
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:43,989
And we can sometimes get mitigation from the contractors that are performing work in our community.

159
00:22:44,389 --> 00:22:47,150
And this might be an aspect where we can negotiate mitigation.

160
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,290
So I'd request that we make those two entities aware.

161
00:22:49,753 --> 00:22:58,697
of the council's request as well, so that in the instance that an opportunity comes up, we can possibly negotiate some mitigation that this can be something that they can ask for.

162
00:22:59,157 --> 00:23:00,057
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

163
00:23:01,618 --> 00:23:03,939
We have a resident that would like to speak on this issue.

164
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:05,720
Thank you for coming down tonight.

165
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,920
If we could please have your name and address for the record.

166
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:12,822
Rosemary Tehan, T-E-E-H-A-N.

167
00:23:13,743 --> 00:23:17,124
And I live at 19 Brooks Street in Medford.

168
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:18,925
Thank you.

169
00:23:23,192 --> 00:23:31,739
And let's see, I'm requesting this because there is not an audible signal there right now.

170
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:38,304
And to cross it, there's a flat island in the middle.

171
00:23:38,764 --> 00:23:43,368
So I don't think I would cross the street without

172
00:23:44,915 --> 00:23:53,242
If I use the cane for mobility, I don't think I would cross the street the way it is now by myself, because it would be too easy to veer.

173
00:23:57,246 --> 00:24:05,532
And the other problem with having no audible signal there is I have to guess when the light changes.

174
00:24:05,772 --> 00:24:07,754
And so sometimes,

175
00:24:10,602 --> 00:24:12,522
there's just a pause in traffic.

176
00:24:12,762 --> 00:24:17,503
And so I'll start to go and, you know, the cars start to come.

177
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:27,245
So, and, you know, of course, Macy will stop when she does see that happening, but it has happened a couple of times.

178
00:24:27,485 --> 00:24:34,787
And so it's a little nerve wracking to cross the street and especially on the way back because

179
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:40,431
There is, you can't even press a button until you get to the middle of the island.

180
00:24:40,991 --> 00:24:45,672
And so I'm crossing, again, at my best guess.

181
00:24:48,052 --> 00:24:53,373
And actually, when I hit the island, I figure I'm probably all right, so Macy just goes.

182
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:57,374
But again, it is my best guess when I go.

183
00:25:00,614 --> 00:25:01,875
Thank you.

184
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:03,455
Thank you.

185
00:25:07,393 --> 00:25:07,974
Councilor Cavill.

186
00:25:07,994 --> 00:25:09,736
Do you have any further comments?

187
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:14,710
Thank you.

188
00:25:15,751 --> 00:25:23,516
As the young lady mentioned, that's a very dangerous intersection with it, because you've got cars going, traversing on all different ways.

189
00:25:24,076 --> 00:25:34,683
And at one point, there's like a four-way intersection there, from the cars turning in and out of Whole Foods, going in and out onto Auburn Street.

190
00:25:34,703 --> 00:25:39,366
So it is a safety issue, and people just drive like maniacs in that road anyway, so.

191
00:25:39,827 --> 00:25:40,067
Correct.

192
00:25:40,767 --> 00:25:41,388
Good, thank you.

193
00:25:42,468 --> 00:25:43,109
Counsel Marks.

194
00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:44,839
Thank you, Mr. President.

195
00:25:44,859 --> 00:25:48,480
I want to thank Councilor Caviello for bringing up this very important subject.

196
00:25:49,020 --> 00:26:11,485
I would request, as maybe a B paper, if we could send this to the Traffic Commission as well as our Human Diversity and Disabilities Commission regarding other street signalization throughout the community to see where upgrades for sound devices are needed throughout the entire community.

197
00:26:12,105 --> 00:26:12,945
Thank you, Councilor Martins.

198
00:26:12,965 --> 00:26:13,245
Thank you.

199
00:26:16,162 --> 00:26:17,882
Okay, we'll take the B paper first.

200
00:26:18,263 --> 00:26:22,083
On the motion of Council Marks, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

201
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,384
All those in favor?

202
00:26:23,404 --> 00:26:23,484
Aye.

203
00:26:24,144 --> 00:26:24,804
All those opposed?

204
00:26:25,444 --> 00:26:26,204
The motion passes.

205
00:26:27,225 --> 00:26:36,567
On the main motion offered by Councilor Carviello, as amended by Councilor Beers and Councilor Knight.

206
00:26:38,727 --> 00:26:40,128
Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

207
00:26:40,988 --> 00:26:41,568
All those in favor?

208
00:26:41,588 --> 00:26:41,668
Aye.

209
00:26:42,548 --> 00:26:43,169
All those opposed?

210
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:44,749
The motion passes.

211
00:26:53,925 --> 00:26:58,447
On the motion of Councilor Knight to take papers in the hands of the clerk, seconded by Councilor Beers.

212
00:26:58,487 --> 00:26:59,327
All those in favor?

213
00:26:59,747 --> 00:27:00,527
All those opposed?

214
00:27:00,547 --> 00:27:01,588
The motion passes.

215
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:16,232
Offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that a no parking here to corner at the intersection of New Bern and Memphis Street be installed.

216
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:20,874
Councilor Marks.

217
00:27:21,777 --> 00:27:22,817
Thank you, Mr. President.

218
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:32,600
I was contacted by a resident on New Bern Ave, New Bern Street, I'm sorry, regarding this particular intersection onto Meffitt Street.

219
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:39,862
If this car's parked at the corner, it makes it increasingly difficult to pull out into traffic.

220
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:44,363
And they are very concerned regarding public safety.

221
00:27:45,203 --> 00:27:49,304
So they've asked that a sign go up on New Bern,

222
00:27:50,004 --> 00:27:55,349
that says no parking from here to corner at the intersection of New Bern Street and Meffitt Street.

223
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:57,611
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

224
00:27:57,631 --> 00:27:57,991
Thank you.

225
00:27:58,511 --> 00:27:59,172
Councilor Beers.

226
00:27:59,532 --> 00:28:09,701
I'm not sure if it should be an amendment or a B paper, but I think a B paper to at least if we're sending this over to also review similar conditions at Bradshaw and Spring Street.

227
00:28:10,982 --> 00:28:15,266
I don't actually know if the residents want to sign, but I think it's similar conditions, dangerous to turn.

228
00:28:16,206 --> 00:28:18,028
So if the traffic engineer could review that.

229
00:28:19,147 --> 00:28:21,649
So on the BP, Bradshaw and?

230
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:21,969
Spring.

231
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:23,790
Bradshaw and Spring Streets.

232
00:28:24,651 --> 00:28:30,815
So we'll take a, yes, Councilor Marks.

233
00:28:33,056 --> 00:28:46,885
Mr. President, I think part of the concern is naturally the public safety concern, but there are many residents in this community that are not familiar with the parking rules and regulations, and one of them is no parking 20 feet within an intersection.

234
00:28:46,905 --> 00:28:48,006
Correct.

235
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:56,033
And many residents think they're far enough back or may not be quite familiar and say, hey, I'm a good distance.

236
00:28:56,073 --> 00:28:58,995
I'm a car length away from this intersection.

237
00:28:59,476 --> 00:29:01,057
And they're getting tagged, Mr. President.

238
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:03,880
So we know Park Method is doing their job.

239
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:13,688
But I'd like to at least be able to get notification out to residents that there is no parking at any intersection within 20 feet of that intersection.

240
00:29:14,069 --> 00:29:15,390
And that's throughout the entire city.

241
00:29:16,462 --> 00:29:19,243
I actually didn't know that, so that's helpful.

242
00:29:19,283 --> 00:29:22,604
And I think part of the review should be yellow paint, right?

243
00:29:22,624 --> 00:29:23,984
There should be a marking of some kind.

244
00:29:24,044 --> 00:29:24,404
Something.

245
00:29:24,504 --> 00:29:29,946
Signage, yellow paint, just to notify residents, as well as keep the streets safe.

246
00:29:30,466 --> 00:29:32,987
Would you like to make that as an amendment to your resolution, Councilman?

247
00:29:33,509 --> 00:29:46,153
I'd like to make an amendment, but I'd also, I don't know how we do it as a council, but I think it would be great to notify the public on some of these issues that I'm hearing around the community.

248
00:29:46,633 --> 00:29:50,514
And one of them is parking within 20 feet of an intersection.

249
00:29:51,074 --> 00:29:55,336
And again, as we probably all hear, parking too close to the apron of a driveway.

250
00:29:56,016 --> 00:30:05,984
I get a lot of calls regarding cars that are parking right up in thickly settled neighborhoods, right up to a driveway, and it makes it increasingly difficult to get into your own driveway.

251
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:13,351
And I believe you have to park, I think it's two or three feet, I can't recall, I think it's three feet from the apron of a driveway.

252
00:30:14,211 --> 00:30:18,313
And that's seldom enforced, but it's also an issue too, Mr. President.

253
00:30:18,633 --> 00:30:27,696
And I think these reminders to the public to let them know that these are rules and regulations that are out there to benefit everyone are helpful.

254
00:30:28,616 --> 00:30:29,116
Absolutely.

255
00:30:30,297 --> 00:30:33,678
So I'm not sure how we get that out other than me just mentioning it now.

256
00:30:34,218 --> 00:30:36,579
But I'm not sure how we get that out.

257
00:30:38,499 --> 00:30:40,120
Point of information, Councilor Scarpelli.

258
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:50,192
communications director, I'm sorry, have they followed through yet with the implementation of communication director?

259
00:30:50,292 --> 00:30:52,873
I believe they're actually hiring for that position.

260
00:30:52,893 --> 00:31:05,622
Because that's a great, that's one of the avenues that I think most communities use and they go out through social media, city website, maybe if there's someone now that's doing that, we could recommend that.

261
00:31:06,507 --> 00:31:31,757
I mean, it'd be nice, just if I may, it'd be nice maybe to even put something, or maybe send a copy of this paper to the police chief, maybe they can put something on the police website, like Councilor Scarapelli said, the city website, if there's like, it's always good to have like an FAQ type page, you know, frequently asked questions, but maybe that's something that comes up, or actually even Park Medford, so, I mean, there's a number of venues where this resolution probably could be sent if you wanted to.

262
00:31:31,797 --> 00:31:33,938
I'd take all those suggestions, that's great.

263
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:34,218
Okay.

264
00:31:34,718 --> 00:31:35,038
Thank you.

265
00:31:35,699 --> 00:31:37,080
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

266
00:31:38,761 --> 00:31:39,922
And thank you, Councilor Scott Pelley.

267
00:31:41,723 --> 00:31:42,324
Councilor Morrell.

268
00:31:42,924 --> 00:31:43,565
Thank you, Mr. President.

269
00:31:43,585 --> 00:31:46,587
I was basically going to say everything that was just said as a communications professional.

270
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,651
There's a number of avenues we can take.

271
00:31:49,871 --> 00:31:56,334
But also, I know, not that I've ever gotten a ticket, but I know when you're trying to figure out how to deal with that ticket, you end up on the Park Medford website.

272
00:31:56,354 --> 00:32:07,739
So if there was a place to kind of explain, here's a number of reasons you, and I know it says it on the ticket, but while you're here looking at your ticket issue, let's see some other things that you should probably be aware of parking in Medford.

273
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:14,902
So I think just easy access to this information in addition to signs, in lieu of signs and painting that we can't have everywhere.

274
00:32:16,589 --> 00:32:17,410
Thank you, Councilor Murray.

275
00:32:18,551 --> 00:32:20,813
Mr. President, also, it's New Bern Ave.

276
00:32:20,834 --> 00:32:23,016
I was correct originally, and then I corrected myself.

277
00:32:23,757 --> 00:32:24,457
New Bern Ave.

278
00:32:24,678 --> 00:32:25,839
On New Bern Street.

279
00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:26,600
OK, New Bern Ave.

280
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,943
New Bern Ave at the street.

281
00:32:29,963 --> 00:32:30,003
OK.

282
00:32:30,023 --> 00:32:31,345
We will correct that in the resolution.

283
00:32:31,385 --> 00:32:32,766
Thank you for letting us know.

284
00:32:34,088 --> 00:32:34,888
Councilor Caviello.

285
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:35,729
Thank you, Mr. President.

286
00:32:37,011 --> 00:32:49,646
With what Councilman Marks brought up, I've received calls from people that Park Method does occasionally go around and do that, and they also, they tag people who park in front of their own driveways.

287
00:32:51,462 --> 00:32:53,023
And I've gotten a lot of calls from that.

288
00:32:53,043 --> 00:32:55,864
People say, I'm blocking my own driveway, why are they doing that?

289
00:32:56,224 --> 00:33:01,967
But they do on occasion go by and they tag cars that are in driveways and the ones that are too close.

290
00:33:01,987 --> 00:33:03,127
I don't know how often they do it.

291
00:33:03,428 --> 00:33:10,111
Maybe there's something we should maybe direct the people to watch a little closer, especially at night time.

292
00:33:11,751 --> 00:33:12,612
Thank you, Councilor Caviello.

293
00:33:12,632 --> 00:33:14,453
Mr. President, if I could?

294
00:33:14,473 --> 00:33:15,113
You absolutely can.

295
00:33:15,133 --> 00:33:15,833
One minute, please.

296
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:17,194
Councilor Marks.

297
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:23,811
The one stipulation with Park Method, they only enforce streets that have resident permit parking.

298
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:29,533
So the other several hundred streets in the city that don't have it, don't get that type of enforcement.

299
00:33:30,413 --> 00:33:37,915
So I think we have to have a consistent policy, whether you're on a resident permit parking street or not, where these infractions are enforced.

300
00:33:38,703 --> 00:33:39,323
Thank you, Mr. President.

301
00:33:39,343 --> 00:33:40,444
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

302
00:33:41,324 --> 00:33:43,326
So we have a B paper offered by Councilor Beers.

303
00:33:44,206 --> 00:33:47,448
On that B paper, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

304
00:33:47,508 --> 00:33:48,168
All those in favor?

305
00:33:48,188 --> 00:33:48,268
Aye.

306
00:33:48,789 --> 00:33:49,469
All those opposed?

307
00:33:49,589 --> 00:33:50,370
The motion passes.

308
00:33:50,830 --> 00:34:04,458
On the main motion offered by Councilor Marks, as amended by Councilor Marks, to send the paper to the mayor's office, the chief of police, it's a park method, to post,

309
00:34:08,432 --> 00:34:11,374
to post notifications with a guide to parking near street corners.

310
00:34:13,556 --> 00:34:15,978
Into the future communication director.

311
00:34:16,258 --> 00:34:17,539
Seconded by Councilor Caviello.

312
00:34:17,759 --> 00:34:18,620
All those in favor?

313
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:19,860
All those opposed?

314
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,681
The motion passes.

315
00:34:29,908 --> 00:34:30,248
Records.

316
00:34:31,309 --> 00:34:34,812
The records of the meeting of February 4th were passed to Councilor Behrs.

317
00:34:35,811 --> 00:34:36,591
Council of Beers?

318
00:34:39,153 --> 00:34:40,193
How did you find those records?

319
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:45,015
I am incredibly disappointed to say that I found them pristine.

320
00:34:46,056 --> 00:34:49,798
You want to move approval of those?

321
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:50,578
I move approval.

322
00:34:50,778 --> 00:34:51,138
Thank you.

323
00:34:51,178 --> 00:34:56,801
