    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=125.715s">President</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=128.696s">Present.</a>  <a href="../resolutions/24-475.pdf"><font color="green">24-475</font></a> offered by Councilor Scarpelli.
 <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=132.691s">be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council hold a question and answer session to discuss the definitions and terminology regarding the proposed Proposition 2.5 overrides and the proposed debt exclusion measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=143.871s">To</a>  that resolution, the following amendments were added. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=145.993s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli asked that the administration and Council on Aging do outreach to seniors about this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=151.277s">Councilor</a>  Callahan requested outreach to parents of school-aged children, not just teachers, and specifically requested outreach to the PTOs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=157.722s">Councilor</a>  Tseng requested general outreach and specifically requested that the community liaisons translate into other languages the information that is on the city website about the overrides and the debt exclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=167.469s">To</a>  ensure that the council is able to answer questions in a timely manner and that decorum is maintained, the council president, myself, will be enforcing the following rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=175.016s">One,</a>  members of the public will have one minute to ask one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=178.58s">Members</a>  of the public will not be able to ask a second question until all who seek to ask a question have had the chance to ask their first question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=185.286s">The</a>  president will verbally request that residents not ask duplicative or largely similar questions to questions that have already been answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=191.621s">and</a>  may move to the next question if a duplicative or similar question is asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=195.763s">Each</a>  Councilor will have up to two minutes to answer per question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=199.045s">The</a>  president will verbally request the Councilors not answer if a duplicative or largely similar answer has been given by another Councilor and may move to the next question if a duplicative or similar answer is given. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=209.851s">After</a>  members of the public have had the chance to ask their first question, the president will open the floor to either a second question or a short public comment by members of the public in attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=218.615s">And</a>  before we start, I just want to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=221.0s">that</a>  the council itself is in mourning today. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=224.602s">Last</a>  night, we lost our city messenger, Larry Lepore, who has served us for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=229.844s">We</a>  will be having some condolence remarks made at our regular meeting that will begin after our committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=237.108s">So</a>  I hope that folks will stick around if you knew Larry or otherwise to say a kind word or story that you may have shared with him during his many years serving the city behind this rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=248.018s">With</a>  that, I do want to invite our city assessor, Ted Costigan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=251.439s">The</a>  council had requested some answers and updates from him, and I know that he's here to share some information that his office has been working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=259.182s">So</a>  with that, I will go to our assessor, Ted Costigan.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=262.524s">Before</a>  we go on, can I just address my original question? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=268.686s">resolution.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=269.406s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=269.847s">And</a>  then we'll go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=271.007s">Pete,</a>  there are questions, um, that I know that, um, there were some questions about council rules, about limitations when it comes to, to, uh, meetings minutes and how long we could speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=283.232s">And</a>  if there are follow up questions, and if there's one question, I believe council bears explain the process that we're using. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=290.135s">And,</a>  uh, as council president, I think he wants to move this meeting along, but I just, there were some senior citizens that mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=298.635s">if</a>  there's some confusion, I hope we have a little leeway when it comes to maybe asking the same question twice because of maybe not understanding it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=306.163s">So</a>  I hope we would do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=308.465s">The</a>  other question that Councilor Bears did read, did speak about is that we all asked for information to be sent out to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=318.655s">The</a>  mayor's response, I believe, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=322.947s">The</a>  chief of staff did respond that legally the city couldn't inform or given, I'll just read if I can just so people understand, cause it's a little confusing to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=337.859s">Sending</a>  this information request, so it's, we sent this email to legal on today to guide us on what we can do, should avoid doing before we can assist given the OCPF guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=350.484s">One</a>  specific question in mind is whether we can intentionally direct notification advertisement to subset of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=358.988s">So</a>  the following is up on my email below, per council, we can't send unsolicited information <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=365.791s">to</a>  all voters or a portion of voters of the city, whether by mail or by email. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=374.127s">We</a>  got that, that response was today, correct, Councilor Bears? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=376.808s">It</a>  was 10 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=378.068s">today.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=378.828s">If</a>  we knew that and we needed to change wording, I think sending out an all call that we were having a meeting that would, it's open to the public, that just read the resolution, I think that that wouldn't have been an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=392.212s">So</a>  I just wanted to share that with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=394.533s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=394.933s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=395.233s">And</a>  per council, you mean legal council? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=397.114s">I</a>  don't know that I was on that email.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=398.834s">Oh,</a>  you are.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=399.614s">Was</a>  I on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=400.374s">I</a>  believe it was.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=404.246s">Council</a>  Adam, did you forward this to everybody?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=407.247s">You</a>  know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=408.388s">I</a>  don't think I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=409.168s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=410.009s">I</a>  don't think I did forward that to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=411.45s">I</a>  thought it was, I thought it went to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=412.87s">I</a>  think it only went to the, to the three who had amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=415.592s">I</a>  don't think I did for that area.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=417.092s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=417.913s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=418.213s">She</a>  means legal counsel, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=419.574s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=420.174s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=420.814s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=421.194s">I</a>  didn't want her to think about this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=424.056s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=425.857s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=426.657s">Um,</a>  with that, I'll go to our city assessor and let me know when you want me to put slides up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=443.479s">The</a>  new mics are coming on Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=450.024s">Shane's</a>  going to come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=451.365s">He's</a>  going to fix it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=452.005s">I</a>  hear the chair moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=454.947s">Thanks,</a>  Shane.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=486.812s">testing.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=487.453s">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=488.353s">Thank</a>  you, shane.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=494.718s">pretty</a>  big guy, so sorry about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=497.86s">Yeah,</a>  but if we could go to the slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=501.262s">Just</a>  out of a point of information, the Department of Revenue received our valuations for fiscal year 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=509.648s">They</a>  approved it actually this morning, so I'm able to share with you our evaluation changes for fiscal year 25 as a reminder to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=519.514s">On</a>  a yearly basis, the Department of Revenue and the state mandates that <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=523.917s">We</a>  the assessing office update valuations to full and fair cash value. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=528.88s">Again</a>  on that fiscal year basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=530.982s">We</a>  share those valuations in January, but we worked really hard in the office this year to get them done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=535.805s">And</a>  as of this morning they were approved so just sharing this information, because it will apply to the override. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=542.609s">in</a>  those override options. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=544.35s">So</a>  residential valuations went up approximately 4% this year and the commercial industrial personal property which is our commercial base went up about 3% in value this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=555.773s">Our</a>  new growth which is when you think of like new single family homes <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=559.534s">new</a>  condo conversions, any exempt property that goes to taxable, that's a $2.5 million in new growth, which adds to our levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=568.701s">And</a>  then I just wanted to point out that, you know, absent any override vote, the average tax bill would go up approximately $175 on our median single family this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=581.831s">That's</a>  sort of the effects of Prop 2 1⁄2. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=586.537s">Next</a>  page, so we obviously have our override votes just as a reminder to people, questions, just as a note, question six, whether it passes or not will not have an effect on fiscal year 25 tax bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=598.504s">That's</a>  because the debt service payment would have to be paid in fiscal year 25, which would not be possible given the time it takes to issue the debt and obviously the six month period before the first debt payment would be due. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=610.911s">so</a>  we're looking at questions seven and eight tonight which would have an effect were they to pass on the fiscal year 25 tax bills and just next slide I don't want to <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=623.829s">people</a>  to death, so I just took one example, which is our median single family tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=630.292s">I</a>  know the numbers might be a little small, but again, the way we arrive at your tax bill is multiplying your valuation by the tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=641.756s">And</a>  what, you know, our tax rate is in a lot of ways, determined by how much we can levy on taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=649.322s">So</a>  the levy the last year was about 139.9 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=654.178s">We</a>  have Prop 2.5, which pushed up the levy by 3.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=658.882s">The</a>  new growth, which is 2.5, which gives us our fiscal year 25 levy at $146 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=664.526s">That's</a>  the amount of money that the city can collect in real estate, personal property taxation from its residents, taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=672.933s">Our</a>  estimated tax rate, given all this, and we do have a split rate between the commercial and the residential, we'll focus on the residential is $8.37. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=679.995s">On</a>  the median single-family home, that would mean a tax bill of $6,519 for the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=687.696s">Again,</a>  that's a year-on-year difference from last year of $195. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=692.317s">Now,</a>  the next two columns contemplate the passage of question seven and eight, respectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=699.644s">As</a>  you can see, the year on year differences, and then I'll just go move on to the last column. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=705.249s">If</a>  they were both passed, instead of a median single family home in Medford having $195 a year on year increase, the increase would be $529, giving us a net effect if both questions were passed of approximately $334 to the, again, median single family in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=725.945s">I</a>  did a, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=726.986s">run</a>  the calculations for the median condo, which would be a year-on-year change of $345, and the two families would be $873. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=733.814s">That's</a>  again the median. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=742.003s">What</a>  I will pledge to do, and I'm working with the mayor's communications office to get this done on our website, now that as of this morning I have the approval from the Department of Revenue, I will publish all our addresses and values of residential properties on our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=760.712s">with</a>  these contemplated tax rates which could change slightly and I'll get that in the next slide so that every resident in Medford that would like to can go on to our website as they can normally you could go right now and find your 24 value but in advance get their fiscal year 25 value and the contemplated tax bill that would be associated with that value. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=782.987s">So</a>  just go real quick to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=784.608s">Just</a>  a caveat that we, those tax rates are dependent on councils tax rate hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=793.093s">They</a>  are dependent on the department of revenue, uh, approving our tax rate recap. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=798.196s">And</a>  there is a rounding issue that comes in because we split the rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=801.438s">So</a>  I can't go all the way past the levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=803.559s">So</a>  occasionally the tax rate will be off by a penny that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=807.602s">So</a>  that's to say, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=810.103s">We're</a>  done with evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=811.224s">We</a>  want to be as transparent as possible as people are starting early voting on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=815.907s">So</a>  I believe this weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=818.449s">So</a>  we will commit this week to as long as the mayor's office communications team can help me do it, get all the values and the impact of these overrides on our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=829.377s">Any</a>  questions from the council?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=834.517s">Yeah,</a>  sure, and just thanks, Ted, I wanna appreciate your hard work getting this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=839.361s">In</a>  October, it usually gets done in January, so it's appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=842.223s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>
