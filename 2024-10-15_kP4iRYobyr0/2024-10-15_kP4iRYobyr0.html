    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=125.715s">President</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=128.696s">Present.</a>  <a href="../resolutions/24-475.pdf"><font color="green">24-475</font></a> offered by Councilor Scarpelli.
 <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=132.691s">be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council hold a question and answer session to discuss the definitions and terminology regarding the proposed Proposition 2.5 overrides and the proposed debt exclusion measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=143.871s">To</a>  that resolution, the following amendments were added. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=145.993s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli asked that the administration and Council on Aging do outreach to seniors about this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=151.277s">Councilor</a>  Callahan requested outreach to parents of school-aged children, not just teachers, and specifically requested outreach to the PTOs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=157.722s">Councilor</a>  Tseng requested general outreach and specifically requested that the community liaisons translate into other languages the information that is on the city website about the overrides and the debt exclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=167.469s">To</a>  ensure that the council is able to answer questions in a timely manner and that decorum is maintained, the council president, myself, will be enforcing the following rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=175.016s">One,</a>  members of the public will have one minute to ask one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=178.58s">Members</a>  of the public will not be able to ask a second question until all who seek to ask a question have had the chance to ask their first question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=185.286s">The</a>  president will verbally request that residents not ask duplicative or largely similar questions to questions that have already been answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=191.621s">and</a>  may move to the next question if a duplicative or similar question is asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=195.763s">Each</a>  Councilor will have up to two minutes to answer per question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=199.045s">The</a>  president will verbally request the Councilors not answer if a duplicative or largely similar answer has been given by another Councilor and may move to the next question if a duplicative or similar answer is given. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=209.851s">After</a>  members of the public have had the chance to ask their first question, the president will open the floor to either a second question or a short public comment by members of the public in attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=218.615s">And</a>  before we start, I just want to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=221.0s">that</a>  the council itself is in mourning today. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=224.602s">Last</a>  night, we lost our city messenger, Larry Lepore, who has served us for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=229.844s">We</a>  will be having some condolence remarks made at our regular meeting that will begin after our committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=237.108s">So</a>  I hope that folks will stick around if you knew Larry or otherwise to say a kind word or story that you may have shared with him during his many years serving the city behind this rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=248.018s">With</a>  that, I do want to invite our city assessor, Ted Costigan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=251.439s">The</a>  council had requested some answers and updates from him, and I know that he's here to share some information that his office has been working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=259.182s">So</a>  with that, I will go to our assessor, Ted Costigan.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=262.524s">Before</a>  we go on, can I just address my original question? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=268.686s">resolution.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=269.406s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=269.847s">And</a>  then we'll go ahead.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=271.007s">Pete,</a>  there are questions, um, that I know that, um, there were some questions about council rules, about limitations when it comes to, to, uh, meetings minutes and how long we could speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=283.232s">And</a>  if there are follow up questions, and if there's one question, I believe council bears explain the process that we're using. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=290.135s">And,</a>  uh, as council president, I think he wants to move this meeting along, but I just, there were some senior citizens that mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=298.635s">if</a>  there's some confusion, I hope we have a little leeway when it comes to maybe asking the same question twice because of maybe not understanding it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=306.163s">So</a>  I hope we would do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=308.465s">The</a>  other question that Councilor Bears did read, did speak about is that we all asked for information to be sent out to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=318.655s">The</a>  mayor's response, I believe, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=322.947s">The</a>  chief of staff did respond that legally the city couldn't inform or given, I'll just read if I can just so people understand, cause it's a little confusing to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=337.859s">Sending</a>  this information request, so it's, we sent this email to legal on today to guide us on what we can do, should avoid doing before we can assist given the OCPF guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=350.484s">One</a>  specific question in mind is whether we can intentionally direct notification advertisement to subset of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=358.988s">So</a>  the following is up on my email below, per council, we can't send unsolicited information <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=365.791s">to</a>  all voters or a portion of voters of the city, whether by mail or by email. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=374.127s">We</a>  got that, that response was today, correct, Councilor Bears? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=376.808s">It</a>  was 10 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=378.068s">today.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=378.828s">If</a>  we knew that and we needed to change wording, I think sending out an all call that we were having a meeting that would, it's open to the public, that just read the resolution, I think that that wouldn't have been an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=392.212s">So</a>  I just wanted to share that with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=394.533s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=394.933s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=395.233s">And</a>  per council, you mean legal council? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=397.114s">I</a>  don't know that I was on that email.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=398.834s">Oh,</a>  you are.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=399.614s">Was</a>  I on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=400.374s">I</a>  believe it was.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=404.246s">Council</a>  Adam, did you forward this to everybody?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=407.247s">You</a>  know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=408.388s">I</a>  don't think I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=409.168s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=410.009s">I</a>  don't think I did forward that to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=411.45s">I</a>  thought it was, I thought it went to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=412.87s">I</a>  think it only went to the, to the three who had amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=415.592s">I</a>  don't think I did for that area.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=417.092s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=417.913s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=418.213s">She</a>  means legal counsel, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=419.574s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=420.174s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=420.814s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=421.194s">I</a>  didn't want her to think about this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=424.056s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=425.857s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=426.657s">Um,</a>  with that, I'll go to our city assessor and let me know when you want me to put slides up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=443.479s">The</a>  new mics are coming on Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=450.024s">Shane's</a>  going to come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=451.365s">He's</a>  going to fix it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=452.005s">I</a>  hear the chair moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=454.947s">Thanks,</a>  Shane.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=486.812s">testing.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=487.453s">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=488.353s">Thank</a>  you, shane.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=494.718s">pretty</a>  big guy, so sorry about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=497.86s">Yeah,</a>  but if we could go to the slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=501.262s">Just</a>  out of a point of information, the Department of Revenue received our valuations for fiscal year 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=509.648s">They</a>  approved it actually this morning, so I'm able to share with you our evaluation changes for fiscal year 25 as a reminder to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=519.514s">On</a>  a yearly basis, the Department of Revenue and the state mandates that <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=523.917s">We</a>  the assessing office update valuations to full and fair cash value. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=528.88s">Again</a>  on that fiscal year basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=530.982s">We</a>  share those valuations in January, but we worked really hard in the office this year to get them done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=535.805s">And</a>  as of this morning they were approved so just sharing this information, because it will apply to the override. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=542.609s">in</a>  those override options. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=544.35s">So</a>  residential valuations went up approximately 4% this year and the commercial industrial personal property which is our commercial base went up about 3% in value this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=555.773s">Our</a>  new growth which is when you think of like new single family homes <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=559.534s">new</a>  condo conversions, any exempt property that goes to taxable, that's a $2.5 million in new growth, which adds to our levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=568.701s">And</a>  then I just wanted to point out that, you know, absent any override vote, the average tax bill would go up approximately $175 on our median single family this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=581.831s">That's</a>  sort of the effects of Prop 2 1⁄2. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=586.537s">Next</a>  page, so we obviously have our override votes just as a reminder to people, questions, just as a note, question six, whether it passes or not will not have an effect on fiscal year 25 tax bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=598.504s">That's</a>  because the debt service payment would have to be paid in fiscal year 25, which would not be possible given the time it takes to issue the debt and obviously the six month period before the first debt payment would be due. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=610.911s">so</a>  we're looking at questions seven and eight tonight which would have an effect were they to pass on the fiscal year 25 tax bills and just next slide I don't want to <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=623.829s">people</a>  to death, so I just took one example, which is our median single family tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=630.292s">I</a>  know the numbers might be a little small, but again, the way we arrive at your tax bill is multiplying your valuation by the tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=641.756s">And</a>  what, you know, our tax rate is in a lot of ways, determined by how much we can levy on taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=649.322s">So</a>  the levy the last year was about 139.9 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=654.178s">We</a>  have Prop 2.5, which pushed up the levy by 3.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=658.882s">The</a>  new growth, which is 2.5, which gives us our fiscal year 25 levy at $146 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=664.526s">That's</a>  the amount of money that the city can collect in real estate, personal property taxation from its residents, taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=672.933s">Our</a>  estimated tax rate, given all this, and we do have a split rate between the commercial and the residential, we'll focus on the residential is $8.37. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=679.995s">On</a>  the median single-family home, that would mean a tax bill of $6,519 for the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=687.696s">Again,</a>  that's a year-on-year difference from last year of $195. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=692.317s">Now,</a>  the next two columns contemplate the passage of question seven and eight, respectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=699.644s">As</a>  you can see, the year on year differences, and then I'll just go move on to the last column. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=705.249s">If</a>  they were both passed, instead of a median single family home in Medford having $195 a year on year increase, the increase would be $529, giving us a net effect if both questions were passed of approximately $334 to the, again, median single family in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=725.945s">I</a>  did a, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=726.986s">run</a>  the calculations for the median condo, which would be a year-on-year change of $345, and the two families would be $873. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=733.814s">That's</a>  again the median. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=742.003s">What</a>  I will pledge to do, and I'm working with the mayor's communications office to get this done on our website, now that as of this morning I have the approval from the Department of Revenue, I will publish all our addresses and values of residential properties on our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=760.712s">with</a>  these contemplated tax rates which could change slightly and I'll get that in the next slide so that every resident in Medford that would like to can go on to our website as they can normally you could go right now and find your 24 value but in advance get their fiscal year 25 value and the contemplated tax bill that would be associated with that value. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=782.987s">So</a>  just go real quick to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=784.608s">Just</a>  a caveat that we, those tax rates are dependent on councils tax rate hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=793.093s">They</a>  are dependent on the department of revenue, uh, approving our tax rate recap. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=798.196s">And</a>  there is a rounding issue that comes in because we split the rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=801.438s">So</a>  I can't go all the way past the levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=803.559s">So</a>  occasionally the tax rate will be off by a penny that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=807.602s">So</a>  that's to say, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=810.103s">We're</a>  done with evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=811.224s">We</a>  want to be as transparent as possible as people are starting early voting on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=815.907s">So</a>  I believe this weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=818.449s">So</a>  we will commit this week to as long as the mayor's office communications team can help me do it, get all the values and the impact of these overrides on our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=829.377s">Any</a>  questions from the council?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=834.517s">Yeah,</a>  sure, and just thanks, Ted, I wanna appreciate your hard work getting this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=839.361s">In</a>  October, it usually gets done in January, so it's appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=842.223s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=843.944s">So</a>  I know that the word transparent gets thrown around, Ted, and I hate for you to get dragged into this, but you weren't part of any financial task force for the override, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=856.374s">No,</a>  I was not. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=856.834s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=859.557s">Normally,</a>  when communities put this into place, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=863.908s">I'm</a>  told from different communities, different assessors, finance directors, that they usually line this up prior to any budget meetings, so we can help our most vulnerable people in our community understand what any impact it would make. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=878.678s">So</a>  having this calculation that you're doing for us, and thank you so much for doing it, because I know there were so many questions with the calculations that have been public on the side that you had nothing to do with. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=888.785s">I</a>  know it came out of a state website, but it didn't truly <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=894.108s">calculate</a>  the newer assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=896.809s">So</a>  that's correct, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=898.17s">Yep,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=898.81s">So</a>  when we look at this and now we're doing it on the 11th hour, the question was normally in your experience, other professionals in your field, this is done usually during budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=913.976s">So</a>  we can prepare our residents that if there was an increase of 373 median price, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=922.694s">They're</a>  prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=923.394s">I</a>  know it sounds minimal to some people because it's only, that's all we keep hearing, it's only, but is it odd that we're doing this so late?</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=934.3s">Councilor,</a>  I think you described the typical circumstance where the vote, you know, as we know, we look at the votes online are done in April or May.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=945.605s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=947.106s">Appreciate</a>  that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=950.067s">Any</a>  other questions?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=954.303s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=955.624s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=956.325s">Thank</a>  you so much for being with us here tonight and for all the legwork that you've been doing to get the FY 25 estimated valuations online months earlier than you otherwise would. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=965.791s">Really</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=966.671s">And</a>  I appreciate that it helps folks get a clearer picture of what precisely their bills might look like in the future based on various <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=977.478s">how</a>  the votes go in various directions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=979.52s">So</a>  just to make sure that I understand the information that's available, and it would be, is it on the Assessor's Department page or the Finance Department page on the city website?</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=987.087s">Yeah,</a>  so I just got the values done today. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=989.829s">I</a>  just prepared the PowerPoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=991.091s">I'm</a>  working with the, going to have to work with the Mayoral Communications Office to get it onto our assessing page. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=999.658s">We</a>  will also have anyone who doesn't <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1002.481s">you</a>  know, they can call the assessing office and we can look it up very quickly for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1005.964s">So</a>  they want to call in, or if they want to access our website, either way.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1010.909s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1011.19s">So</a>  up until today, people can call your office or look on the assessor's department website webpage and find the webpage is going to be dependent on like, I'm going to try to get it up this week, but like, it's just however fast we can do it.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1022.461s">So</a>  probably let's say by Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1024.963s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1025.423s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1026.26s">We</a>  have the FY 24 based calculations and now you're expediting getting the FY 25 based valuations so that people can have even more clarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1036.485s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1036.765s">Well,</a>  thank you so much for updating that ahead of schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1038.686s">Appreciate</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1040.627s">Thanks</a>  Ted. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1041.247s">Just</a>  two more questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1042.888s">One,</a>  given your estimates, if neither of the overrides pass based on your estimates, the tax rate would once again be going down.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1050.492s">That's</a>  correct.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1051.553s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1052.314s">And</a>  before today, when you had the approved fiscal 25 values, would it have been possible for anyone to provide an update using anything other than the fiscal 24 values or an estimate? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1063.985s">Anyone</a>  from the public, not from your office.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1066.92s">I</a>  mean, you know, it's possible they might have gotten close, but it's kind of hard to, you know, drill down and get it accurately presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1073.786s">So,</a>  yeah, I would say no.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1076.007s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1077.308s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1077.729s">Any</a>  further questions from members of council? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1079.15s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1080.391s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1081.532s">I</a>  understand, you know, one of the council's main priorities going in before <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1086.736s">Knowing</a>  that this might be an option in the coming years was to maximize this senior circuit breaker for the tax deferrals and to push for the senior work-off program to get more of that done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1102.431s">It's</a>  my understanding that folks can find out more about the senior tax deferral from the assessor's office, is that correct?</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1109.008s">Yes,</a>  so there's, as you mentioned, our senior work-off program is staffed, I believe over at least 20 senior work-off participants this year across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1119.918s">The</a>  senior deferral applications are available as well as the personal exemptions for low-income seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1126.884s">So</a>  it's kind of two different programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1129.246s">They</a>  have both asset and income limits.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1134.332s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1135.213s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1136.354s">With</a>  just a couple more questions, I know that you mentioned that this doesn't have any impact on question six, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1143.439s">It's</a>  not in fiscal year 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1145.381s">Because</a>  it's not enough time to put everything in, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1148.683s">We</a>  don't know the actual numbers, correct?</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1151.986s">Yeah,</a>  I haven't calculated that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1153.487s">Obviously,</a>  interest rates could change drastically.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1155.748s">Okay,</a>  but we still don't know how much for question six. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1158.971s">It's</a>  an open-ended, as it said in the question, there's nothing there.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1162.549s">It's</a>  I, you know, I can't really tell you what the market's going to do right on the on the bond market.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1169.038s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1170.5s">And</a>  I realize the exemptions are great. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1173.424s">but</a>  I know that there are options when you do this ahead of time is to really prepare your seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1179.446s">I</a>  know the exemptions sound good, but when you read them and you talk to actual people, there are a lot of senior citizens that really don't fit in that category. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1187.748s">So</a>  there are no other options. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1190.068s">So</a>  I know the buzzwords easy to say, we do have exemptions, but when you put it apples to apples and you sit with the senior citizen and you go through their situation, I'm sure you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1200.171s">Mrs.</a>  Jones bought her house with her husband 55 years ago for 50,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1204.593s">Now</a>  the house is appraised at a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1208.055s">You</a>  know, it really doesn't help what we're offering. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1211.357s">So</a>  it's a funny number and there could be something done more if we had time for an exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1218.621s">That's</a>  all I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1219.241s">I</a>  know that if we had time, this is something we could petition to see if we can really truly <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1224.804s">support</a>  our senior citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1226.525s">I</a>  think that must be said. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1227.625s">And</a>  I think the, the last piece to this, I think that when they look at this and because one question I have Ted is that a lot of people have asked, not just seniors, um, that the, this is like a one time tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1240.371s">This</a>  isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1241.411s">So</a>  when you see that 4% above your two and a half percent increase, that's going to be compounded year after year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1249.255s">This</a>  isn't something that's going to go away like debt exclusion, correct?</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1253.159s">Correct,</a>  the levy is set at the new limit and the two and a half is on that new levy.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1257.141s">Right,</a>  so that'll grow forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1259.482s">And</a>  I think the other piece that people have to understand too, and it's a tough office. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1264.524s">So</a>  I just, when you hear the misconceptions, I just need your input to educate our residents and understanding that, again, I believe the mayor said her house is only $13. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1275.248s">Some</a>  others here said their house is $40 a month or whatever, and we can handle that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1281.61s">That</a>  might be the first year, but again, we were told, I think someone from your office emailed us and said that we'll be reassessing again in 2025 for 2026 using the data for 2023, correct?</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1296.932s">Um,</a>  so the 25 values used calendar year, 23 sales. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1301.538s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1302.419s">So</a>  next year we're going to see a 26 using calendar year, 24, uh, sales.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1307.286s">So</a>  we're going to say that happens every year.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1309.489s">That's</a>  a every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1310.45s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1310.63s">So</a>  that's good. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1311.591s">So</a>  it happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1312.132s">Thank</a>  you for helping with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1313.033s">So</a>  it increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1313.935s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1314.679s">Again,</a>  when this tax goes in, it's now assessed again, the homes will be assessed again.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1318.683s">Yeah,</a>  so I can't predict what the final 24 numbers are going to be, but it could go up, could go down, depends on the market, right?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1323.909s">Right,</a>  but we're seeing that most assessments, because I could tell you, I'm dealing with my own family members that are looking at a $400 increase per month for his new assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1336.583s">It's</a>  real. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1337.183s">So</a>  I think that what people also have to understand is that it's not just the home tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1342.147s">You've</a>  seen their cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1347.05s">Motor</a>  vehicle excise. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1348.491s">Vehicle</a>  excise tax is going to go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1350.713s">You're</a>  going to see the CPA tax because your homes are going to be assessed higher now, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1354.816s">So</a>  now the CPA tax will also be taxed higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1357.838s">You're</a>  going to see that a little bit higher, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1360.18s">Okay,</a>  that's yeah, that's generally correct.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1362.581s">Generally,</a>  the CPA was included in the calculations presented.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1366.421s">Okay,</a>  so thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1367.222s">So</a>  what you're seeing is, it's not just it's not just an override tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1374.243s">It's</a>  an override tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1375.263s">It's</a>  compounded year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1377.204s">It's</a>  a tax that increases in the CPA as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1380.084s">It's</a>  the excise tax that increases as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1383.084s">It's</a>  so much more than just 13. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1385.426s">That's</a>  my point I'm trying to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1387.327s">I</a>  know it's easy to look at a site that wasn't put forth by our office because we know that although it's correct, the numbers that my colleagues did put out there on a page, it does give the numbers that are true and factual, but <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1403.342s">That</a>  didn't include the assessments that residents had, and I'll use my brother's example, because his house was appraised at, on the calculations, at $800,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1413.053s">His</a>  house is now appraised at $1.2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1415.856s">So</a>  that's why we're seeing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1417.958s">And</a>  that's not odd. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1419.179s">This</a>  is family-owned homes that <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1422.643s">that</a>  we passed on to generation to generation, just like most people in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1426.068s">So,</a>  but thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1427.75s">I</a>  know I'm monopolizing the time because I think it's important, because these are the questions the people that are sitting in this in this room right now and their friends have contacted me and said, we're very confused, Mr. Scappelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1438.163s">Because</a>  even something simple as, Mr. Scarpelli, why are we fighting for $7.5 million for a new high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1445.13s">And</a>  I'm like, no, no, this has nothing to do with the new high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1447.493s">That's</a>  down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1448.774s">And</a>  people understanding that, well, this is a fight between schools and kids and senior citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1455.481s">That's</a>  not true at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1456.702s">We</a>  just want to make sure all the information's out so every resident understands the impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1462.998s">that,</a>  and we could talk about solutions as we go, because there are solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1466.22s">There</a>  were solutions back in April, but thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1470.643s">Thanks,</a>  Ted. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1471.663s">Really</a>  appreciate the hard work of your office. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1473.904s">Just</a>  want to note, certainly this council, and you've shared some recently, has taken several votes to maximize the exemptions allowed by state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1482.249s">If</a>  you see anything more that we could do on that front, I believe in 2022, we voted to tie it to the law so that we wouldn't have to constantly be updating it as the state did. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1491.852s">If</a>  you see anything, please let us know. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1493.994s">Certainly</a>  our intent is to be maximizing everything, and I believe we have.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1497.717s">Yeah,</a>  just the HEROES Act that just was passed allows us to tie the veteran personal exemption to cost of living. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1504.242s">So</a>  that just passed, so it would be a new action by council.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1509.407s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1509.847s">We</a>  will do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1510.648s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1511.048s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1512.229s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1513.73s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1514.09s">I'm</a>  going to read off the rules one more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1515.592s">We're</a>  going to move to question and answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1522.0s">All</a>  right, so we're gonna follow the following rules for this part of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1527.244s">Members</a>  of the public will have one minute to ask one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1530.186s">Members</a>  of the public will not be able to ask a second question until everyone has had a chance to ask their first. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1535.83s">I'm</a>  gonna verbally request that we not ask duplicative or largely similar questions and may move on to the next question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1542.154s">If</a>  a duplicative or similar question is asked, Councilors will have up to two minutes per Councilor to answer each question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1549.653s">I'm</a>  requesting the Councilors not provide duplicative or largely similar answers to answers that have been already provided by other Councilors and may move on to the next Councilor for an answer if that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1560.801s">And</a>  after members of the public have had the chance to ask their first question, we'll open the floor to a second question or a short public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1567.885s">And</a>  I'm going to be alternating between the chamber and Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1571.588s">So</a>  we will start at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1573.509s">Mr.</a>  Castagnetti, you'll have one minute to ask a question and then we'll go to Zoom after answers from Councilors.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1579.65s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears, Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street, East Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1588.037s">I'm</a>  very devastated that we lost Larry Lepore. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1590.319s">He's</a>  a wonderful man. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1591.42s">He's</a>  a good friend.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1593.802s">Is</a>  the microphone on? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1597.645s">Andrew,</a>  is the mic, turn the mic down.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1600.448s">Yeah,</a>  there you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1601.289s">I'm</a>  sorry we lost Larry Lepore. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1604.932s">The</a>  minutes.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1605.913s">You</a>  got your minutes.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1607.094s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1609.047s">I</a>  hope you all had a good Columbus Day yesterday, because he is the greatest world naval explorer in history. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1616.111s">He</a>  said the world is round, not flat. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1618.432s">He</a>  had more courage than all of us combined. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1622.314s">He</a>  is also a hero to me and others. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1625.175s">Also</a>  hope you had a good Indigenous People's Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1628.957s">I</a>  also hope the same for the Jews. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1631.363s">in</a>  the Mideast because they've been there more than 2000 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1635.266s">Now</a>  let's talk prop two and a half overwrites. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1639.61s">As</a>  I told you all before method never had a prop two and a half overwrite. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1643.573s">We're</a>  not Winchester, we are all method here, a working class town city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1648.538s">Our</a>  problem is fiscal management and lack of building maintenance period, full stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1655.123s">My</a>  ask is for you honorable city councils to stop this real estate tax assault on we the homeowners and leave the people alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1664.385s">Stop</a>  the bleeding. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1665.725s">We're</a>  already having trouble with all this Biden inflation.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1672.747s">Go</a>  ahead and say the sentence minutes up.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1677.087s">I</a>  mean, it's up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1678.028s">You</a>  can say the sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1678.828s">Andy</a>  is a minute up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1679.788s">Yes,</a>  sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1680.148s">It</a>  is up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1680.628s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1680.908s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1681.568s">My</a>  motto was this no, no further taxation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1685.694s">He's</a>  allowing me to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1686.755s">Do</a>  you want to interrupt me? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1687.755s">Do</a>  you want to interrupt me?</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1694.58s">This</a>  is crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1696.181s">Stop</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1697.062s">My</a>  motto was this, no more further taxation without proper representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1701.385s">The</a>  end. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1702.485s">Andrew</a>  said that dark call.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1705.948s">Thank</a>  you, Andy. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1706.728s">Does</a>  anyone have a response? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1707.969s">Your</a>  time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1708.97s">Anyone</a>  want to answer the question? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1711.811s">Councilor</a>  Lemke, you have two minutes.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1714.838s">I'm</a>  going to try to respond to one thing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1716.578s">I</a>  didn't hear a specific question, but you did say that Medford's not like our surrounding towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1724.02s">No,</a>  I said Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1725.081s">Yeah,</a>  we're not like Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1726.521s">90%</a>  of cities in the state of Massachusetts have had an override. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1732.203s">Medford</a>  has one of the lowest operating budgets per capita of any city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1741.625s">midsize</a>  city in the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1744.446s">And</a>  that is in large part because we are one of the 10% of cities that has never had an override. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1751.749s">So</a>  you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1752.409s">We</a>  are not like our neighbors that have had overrides and we have less money for it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1758.291s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1760.752s">We'll</a>  move on to the next question, unless anyone else has an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1765.387s">Thank</a>  you, Andy. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1766.187s">We'll</a>  go to Michelle B on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1768.909s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1770.389s">And</a>  you'll have one minute to ask your question.</p>

    <p>[Michelle Barkson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1774.451s">Hi,</a>  my name is Michelle Barkson. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1775.732s">I</a>  live at 23 Diane Road in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1779.134s">Thank</a>  you everyone for your work with this important progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1784.656s">My</a>  question is, can you please speak to the ramifications of what will happen if questions seven and eight do not pass specifically to the school budget and how that will affect our students <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1794.801s">learning</a>  environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1795.722s">I</a>  just want to remind everyone listening that teacher working conditions are student learning conditions, and those two things cannot be separated. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1804.488s">As</a>  a public school teacher in another town, I can speak to that being very true. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1808.791s">So</a>  I would love to hear, or I would not love to hear, but I want to hear what might happen if these don't pass so we can highlight the importance of them passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1815.856s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1817.317s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1817.777s">I'll</a>  go to Vice President Collins, then</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1823.786s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1824.529s">Thank</a>  you for the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1828.319s">I</a>  want to add a disclaimer that I obviously sitting behind this rail on this date, I'm not a school committee member. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1834.8s">I</a>  don't have that level of granular knowledge of the school department and the school department makes its own budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1840.641s">The</a>  city council does not. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1842.102s">That</a>  being said, I have discussed this matter extensively with people in the community, with people involved in the schools, with school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1852.524s">I</a>  understand that <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1854.224s">you</a>  know, what we stand to lose if these questions do not pass includes, you know, some of the stuff that people involved in the schools may remember from when we had to cut the school's budget during the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1867.679s">And</a>  that includes eliminating positions, including teachers, nurses, behavioral specialists, literary coaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1875.568s">We</a>  lose the opportunity to add programming within the schools that supplement the curriculum that is state mandated. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1883.713s">So,</a>  some programming that is really beloved by students and their families, such as arts and musical curricula. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1892.297s">We</a>  lose the opportunity to augment the student experience with those types of classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1897.44s">We</a>  lose the opportunity to augment the student experience with more people in supportive roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1905.625s">such</a>  as therapists, nurses, people outside of the classroom who are nevertheless there to make sure that students can thrive in our schools and achieve the best learning that they can? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1919.275s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1921.256s">These</a>  two questions combined also limit our ability to offer competitive and living wages to the many, many people who work in our schools and offer <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1931.823s">students</a>  the experience that they really deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1935.005s">We</a>  know that we need to be offering living wages to our teachers and paras and all school staff because it's the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1940.446s">We</a>  also know that we need to be able to do that in order to keep these people in our school system so that our students are served in the way that they deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1949.118s">This</a>  will also have impacts on building maintenance.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1951.16s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1952.182s">Sorry,</a>  Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1953.924s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1955.285s">Councilor</a>  Collins, I think, touched on a list of positions that, subject to the school committee talks, might be at stake. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1961.532s">Literacy</a>  specialists, school nurses, guidance, mental health specialists, increased class sizes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1966.558s">You</a>  know, it's not fear-mongering when a lot of this stuff has already happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1969.261s">happening</a>  in our school districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1970.322s">We've</a>  already had to make a lot of these cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1972.343s">We've</a>  already found it hard to retain our long-term teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1977.166s">We</a>  also need to take a step back and look at this big picture-wise. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1979.767s">We</a>  know when we invest in our schools, your investment and your value of your property goes up as well, that your public safety around you, crime goes down and public safety goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1990.673s">And</a>  so we, I think there are longer, bigger picture benefits to everyone, even if you don't have kids in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1996.737s">Touching</a>  on the roads real quick, because that's also a part of question seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2001.579s">I</a>  think we need to look at the opportunity we lose. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2004.721s">Now,</a>  the basic role of government, of local government is to fix your potholes and to send your kids to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2010.384s">And</a>  if we're not, if we can't do either of those, then we're not, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2014.406s">we're</a>  not doing our jobs, but we were asking the voters to give us the tools to do our jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2018.727s">And</a>  something about question seven with the roads and sidewalks is that it would give us a crew that would work full time on fixing our potholes and sidewalks in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2028.07s">That's</a>  something that we don't have right now because our resources are too constrained. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2031.471s">And</a>  that's something that I believe if passed, will show, will give our residents a real benefit, a real benefit that you can see and live in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2041.616s">Thank</a>  you for the question.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2045.197s">Let</a>  me start off by first saying that unfortunately this administration has divided this community for the children in the schools and the seniors or the homeowners or renters. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2057.222s">And</a>  I say shame on this administration, shame on this council, shame on the financial task force, because the bottom line is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2065.069s">This</a>  group knew that we were heading in some tough waters back in June 20th of 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2072.072s">And</a>  you could see that in a city council budget meeting when council beers met with the mayor behind closed doors to set up some sort of deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2081.616s">We</a>  didn't know what that deal was, but they created a financial task force and that financial task force put together a plan of an override without anybody's knowledge, anybody's input or any, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2094.026s">or</a>  any community participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2097.747s">There</a>  are no issues with our school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2101.989s">This</a>  is a fair tactic and fair tactic only for the fact that we should remember this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2107.29s">Back</a>  in April, back in May, back in June, when the city had $25 million in free cash, it was my responsibility to bring forth that we take that $5 million <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2119.324s">levy</a>  that budget, make sure there were no cuts, understand the process, and then move forward to see if we truly need an override, which I never said that should never be an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2130.832s">But</a>  to hear parents and teachers and friends and family say, George, explain this to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2138.257s">Councilor</a>  Villes knew that this was gonna be a devastating situation, but it could have been solved and still could be solved with free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2147.565s">We</a>  have plenty of free cash in the system not to turn the city upside down or divide the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2153.27s">Now,</a>  remember, I'll leave you with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2156.513s">What</a>  we're asking for in the budget <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2159.338s">in</a>  this override doesn't mean you'll get exactly what you think you're gonna get. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2165.002s">Because</a>  all these cuts were made to set up this override as a fair tactic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2169.146s">So</a>  please. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2169.866s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2170.887s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli is not against the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2173.649s">We</a>  just hope that people understand that this could be soft.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2177.192s">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2177.952s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2178.793s">Appreciate</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2182.996s">Just</a>  gonna say a few things really quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2189.281s">The</a>  council, oh, I'll go to, okay, I'll wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2192.867s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro, Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2194.751s">Two</a>  minutes.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2195.993s">One</a>  thing that I wanna mention about to answer the Zoom question, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2202.814s">of</a>  residents question, Michelle. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2206.659s">One</a>  thing that we would lose if this question, question seven in particular, does not pass, it's a very specific, I believe it's question seven, it's a very specific thing about the high school schedule, which right now does not allow <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2220.875s">some</a>  of the students who are taking specific classes, I believe it's in the vocational school, to take certain art classes, theater classes, visual arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2232.303s">It</a>  limits our students in being the fully well-rounded students that we want them to be able to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2239.068s">When</a>  you're in high school, you want to be able to explore <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2242.63s">figure</a>  out who you are, what you're interested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2244.812s">And</a>  we want to give all of our students the best opportunity to be everything that they can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2249.756s">And</a>  we don't want to limit them because we haven't had the opportunity to expand the schedule to really experiment with what that can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2257.722s">I</a>  will also say that in 2019, I worked for the school district and I knew then that we were underfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2265.027s">And</a>  I started thinking about running for city council to make something like this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2268.51s">This</a>  has been happening for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2270.071s">We</a>  have had underfunded <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2271.992s">schools</a>  for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2273.073s">And</a>  this has been in the works for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2274.694s">This</a>  has needed to happen for quite a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2277.435s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2279.596s">Councilor</a>  Leming, two minutes.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2282.138s">Saying</a>  that we can address the budgetary problems of the Medford public school system with free cash is like me saying the government gave me a $1,200 check from COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2295.965s">So</a>  I don't have to look for a job right now because that check is going to last me another <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2301.493s">another</a>  two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2303.313s">It's</a>  the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2304.153s">The</a>  government gave us, the government gave the city of Medford some money. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2308.554s">It</a>  was a one-time thing from COVID and the proposal that we can plug ongoing costs from free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2315.175s">All</a>  that would do is drain our reserves and we'd be back at square one in five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2323.137s">If</a>  these overrides don't pass straight up, there will be layoffs in the school system and the roads will continue to be in disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2330.538s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2332.756s">Thank</a>  you, nope, one time, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2335.838s">It's</a>  question eight, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2338.62s">And</a>  any other councilors wanna go? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2341.322s">I'll</a>  be quick, give myself two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2345.203s">I</a>  just want to list it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2347.647s">Two</a>  literacy interventionists, two behavior specialists, one nurse, four teachers, and four department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2352.873s">Those</a>  were cuts that were postponed because we used one-time funds this year to plug the hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2358.3s">There's</a>  another 25 positions, two school Councilors, four classroom teachers, two security monitors, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2363.587s">One</a>  attendance and re-engagement officer, five paraprofessionals, and 12.2 additional staff members that are on one-time federal funds this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2372.612s">So</a>  it's about 35 to 45 staff in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2375.933s">We</a>  would not have a <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2379.363s">permanent</a>  dedicated street and sidewalk crew to use the machines that we already own. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2382.765s">We</a>  don't have enough staff in the DPW to actually run those machines four times a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2387.849s">And</a>  there would not be significant room for looking at additional compensation for educators, paraprofessionals, and staff in our schools, whether that's just to raise their pay, because it's a contract year, or whether that is when we're talking about extending potentially 10 to 15 minutes to school day to align vocational with the comprehensive high school schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2409.643s">or</a>  just to address any issues on time on learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2412.084s">So</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2414.045s">That's</a>  what we would lose. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2415.906s">We</a>  will go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2417.707s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2419.148s">And</a>  you have one minute to ask one question.</p>

    <p>[McGonigal]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2423.61s">John</a>  McGonigal, 20 Ross Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2427.972s">Question</a>  is the residential <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2433.624s">Override</a>  not override the assessments on each house that are going around now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2437.927s">They're</a>  roughly around $60,000 for each house for the last three years So if you take the $60,000 and you multiply it by your nine dollars a thousand You're coming up to five hundred forty dollars a house every single year so Multiply that by your twenty six thousand seven hundred houses that are in Medford which is <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2463.148s">$13,857,000.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2463.168s">My</a>  question is, where does that go?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2471.129s">So</a>  that's not actually how the tax rates calculated. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2474.451s">The</a>  assessor just presented the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2476.232s">The</a>  levy changes based on the two and a half and new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2481.095s">So</a>  it's only about 6 million this year, not 13 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2484.298s">And</a>  generally that amount is only going towards fixed costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2489.341s">So</a>  we have union contracts, increasing health insurance costs, increasing retirement pension costs, increased costs of materials and pavement. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2497.826s">So</a>  that's generally what the normal two and a half new growth increase goes towards.</p>

    <p>[McGonigal]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2501.688s">And</a>  with that assessment, one thing you didn't put in as a cost increase to the citizens of Medford is your homeowner's insurance, your homeowner's insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2511.434s">If</a>  your residential area goes up 160,000 over three years, that's going to be probably another three, $400 a year that I don't think anyone's talked about yet.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2525.102s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[McGonigal]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2525.522s">So</a>  that was my question.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2527.093s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2527.994s">Does</a>  anyone else want to answer that question?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2530.155s">I</a>  think if I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2532.817s">I</a>  think I heard some similar situations with, I know what the assessor came up and gave us medium price homes, but we're seeing real people have told me that this is what we're seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2544.284s">We're</a>  seeing the increase close to $60,000, most homes that you're seeing an increase at a higher percentage rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2551.409s">And</a>  again, on top of all of what we talked about, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2554.591s">with</a>  this, so it's not the $13 a month, the $40 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2557.993s">It's</a>  the pieces that this gentleman just said is the understanding that I never thought that our home insurance now will now increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2568.259s">So</a>  again, this isn't them against us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2572.861s">This</a>  is understanding that we have viable options right now to fix this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2579.645s">with</a>  free cash and then work together to see how we can have an open process to really include all the stakeholders to make sure that, uh, that no one is hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2590.13s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2592.491s">Any</a>  other questions from answers from members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2597.633s">Seeing</a>  none, we'll go to the next question on zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2599.914s">We'll</a>  go to Lizzie Charbonneau. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2601.955s">Lizzie,</a>  you have one minute to ask one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2604.896s">Please</a>  provide your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Lizzie Charbonneau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2607.677s">Yes,</a>  my name is Lizzy Sharpener. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2609.018s">I</a>  live at 18 Stickney Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2611.2s">So</a>  my question is, why do we need to do the override now? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2615.443s">And</a>  in particular, I'm curious to hear you speak to the rising inflation the last few years that has exceeded the rate that the levee limit has been able to increase as well as which costs increase even faster than inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2629.132s">My</a>  understanding is that insurance and pensions and other fixed costs that the city has to <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2634.465s">that</a>  we pay for are rising faster than inflation and faster than those levy increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2639.507s">I</a>  would also like to hear you speak to the increased costs in schools that are exceeding inflation rates and our inability as a city to provide some basic infrastructure like maintenance of roads due to our low budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2653.131s">So</a>  if you could speak to why we need this override now, especially in relation to those items, I would like to hear that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2665.643s">Go</a>  to Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2668.185s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2669.727s">So,</a>  I think this is a basic question why do we need these overrides. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2674.631s">And</a>  as Councilor Leming stated, we, we actually I will say we rank 320th out of 351 Massachusetts cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2685.001s">in</a>  the amount of budget we have per person. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2687.623s">So</a>  we have less budget per person than every other city in Massachusetts and we have less budget per person than 90% of towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2695.39s">All</a>  of the others that spend less per person than we do are much smaller than we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2700.154s">Our</a>  budget is too small to provide the services that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2704.477s">I</a>  want to go ahead, I don't know, this is probably gonna be too small for people to see, but this is a chart of our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2710.661s">And</a>  this large blue area here is the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2715.664s">That</a>  is what we are looking for more money for, so we cannot cut that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2719.987s">The</a>  next one is insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2723.369s">Insurance</a>  is something that we are required to have by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2726.791s">We</a>  cannot cut that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2728.132s">The</a>  next one is pensions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2730.155s">Those</a>  are contractual. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2731.737s">We</a>  cannot cut pensions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2733.74s">The</a>  next two are our fire department and our police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2737.845s">My</a>  feeling is that no one on either side of the Prop 2.5 debate wants to drastically cut our police and fire departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2746.016s">The</a>  next one after police and fire is our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2749.461s">And</a>  I appreciate your question about the roads, because underfunding of our roads has caused us to have $67 million in essentially road debt it's called the road backlog 30 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2761.857s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2763.338s">After</a>  that, our bonds, which we are also required to pay, and then we get down to smaller things, the library facilities, many other small departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2774.121s">None</a>  of these, if we even cut the entire department, could possibly fix the $3 million to $5 million that we need for the school budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2782.624s">Our</a>  budget is simply too small. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2784.225s">I'll</a>  let someone else talk about which of these increases more than inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2786.985s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2787.766s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2790.54s">Go</a>  to Councilor Leming, two minutes.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2792.681s">So</a>  adding on to what Councilor Callahan said, partially this is due to the lingering costs of COVID, which resulted in both decreased funding going to the school system, partially that was just because you have fewer students going into public schools, and partially because <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2812.608s">there</a>  was a lot of activity in the healthcare system from COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2815.793s">So</a>  there is a sort of a, so the cost of health insurance, which we have to pay ended up rising. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2821.504s">Those</a>  are some of the more short term reasons why we need this now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2824.809s">Longer</a>  term, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2826.321s">The</a>  way that Prop 2 NAP is designed is the total amount of money that the city can take in basically can't go up by more than 2.5% every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2836.11s">While</a>  inflation has averaged for the past 44 years at 3.1% over time, that compounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2842.436s">So</a>  the budget today <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2844.137s">is</a>  only a fraction, well, it's only about 78% as valuable today as it was back in 1980. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2852.464s">So</a>  Prop 2.5 has this effect long-term on municipal budget where it squeezes resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2858.929s">Most</a>  cities in Massachusetts have addressed this with the intended mechanism for overcoming this, which is periodic elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2867.675s">This</a>  is just the first time we're doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2869.677s">That's</a>  part of the reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2871.318s">the</a>  fact that we're so late to the game there is part of the reason that again we are 320 out of 351 cities in terms of our per capita budget and that is the reason why our schools could definitely be doing <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2887.594s">better.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2888.174s">That</a>  is the reason why you see so many potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2890.435s">This</a>  is one step in addressing that situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2894.918s">Once</a>  again, free cash, one time funding is not an actual longer term solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2902.141s">If</a>  we just went with free cash, that would be drained in a couple of years, even shorter than the four to five year span I put, I said earlier, and then that's time.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2913.346s">So</a>  let me thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2915.202s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2916.083s">Go</a>  to Councilor Scarpelli of two minutes.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2917.625s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2918.345s">So,</a>  I think my council is not understanding the free cash should be used now to fix a problem now, which we have, and I appreciate the clarification it's only $3 million accounts accounting and just said to fix the school budget, but the key issue isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2933.644s">isn't</a>  the process of getting this fixed now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2936.745s">The</a>  problem that we've had, and we could use the pandemic and use the pandemic over and over again, but what neighboring communities are doing during the pandemic with the infrastructure money that was given through ARPA, that wasn't intended for, for the roads and sidewalks that you're asking for right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2951.248s">Our</a>  mayor didn't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2952.848s">Our</a>  mayor had to balance our budget through ESSER and ARPA funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2957.449s">That's</a>  the easy way out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2958.649s">That's</a>  like paying your mortgage with a credit card. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2961.49s">And</a>  I'll tell you why. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2962.371s">This</a>  is the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2963.091s">Everybody</a>  hasn't said it, but the difference between why we're here and we're in trouble is because of new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2970.053s">New</a>  growth is what pushes <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2973.254s">our</a>  value, our income up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2975.516s">It</a>  gives us more tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2977.397s">It</a>  brings more money so we can do all the things we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2980.239s">This</a>  mayor has done nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2982.06s">We</a>  haven't had shovel in the ground in five and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2985.343s">We're</a>  talking about, I know my council friends have gone out and told people that Massachusetts is the number one, Medford is the number one community new growth in permitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2995.47s">Wrong,</a>  I sat with the commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2997.611s">Permitting</a>  their fine, the biggest concerns we're having, look at the process that she lost fighting 40B projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3005.715s">One</a>  project alone was $3 to $5 million in permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3010.878s">And</a>  then an additional $7 to $9 million that would have come in as new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3015.04s">And</a>  one job that she fought in court, lost and appealed it, and this group had to leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3021.224s">The</a>  problem isn't our tax base, because our assessments are up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3025.786s">And</a>  we're paying more than anybody else in neighboring communities because our assessments are so high. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3031.047s">I</a>  will share my last point. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3034.348s">Neighbor</a>  communities per child, Malden, Arlington, Winchester, between 15 and 17,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3042.59s">Medford,</a>  we pay $22,000 per student. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3045.771s">Is</a>  it a management issue or is it really we don't have enough money? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3049.172s">Think</a>  about it because it's public. $22,000.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3055.202s">Go</a>  to Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3058.063s">Councilor</a>  Tseng, and then Councilor Collins.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3061.704s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3062.004s">Councilor</a>  Tseng, two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3062.924s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3063.944s">Touching</a>  very quickly on the topic of new growth, I think our council is very aware that new growth is the priority for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3069.466s">And</a>  so when we look at the last three years of new growth, so the last two years plus the estimates that we have right in front of us presented by the assessor, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3080.629s">It</a>  actually shows that our first round of zoning reform, which was the first round in almost 50 years of zoning reform, actually has led to the most new growth our city has seen in decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3090.612s">We</a>  are currently working on round two of zoning reform and we are very, very optimistic that that new growth will help us achieve more financial stability going into the future as long as these questions pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3103.755s">I</a>  think <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3104.935s">I</a>  also have this chart right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3109.239s">I'll</a>  do what Councilor Callahan does. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3111.301s">It's</a>  not really easy to see, but you can see that the new growth is growing throughout the last few years with the reforms that we've instituted. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3121.429s">We</a>  are permitting more units as Councilor- Could you put that chart back up?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3124.732s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3125.112s">The</a>  train's gonna zoom in on it.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3127.214s">We're</a>  also permitting more new, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3130.194s">new</a>  units than ever before, as Councilor Scarpellioli states. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3135.748s">Here's</a>  the thing, because on the topic of new growth, we're getting a little bit away from the why now question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3144.271s">We</a>  have a plan, that plan is being implemented, and the results are already bearing fruit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3149.112s">We</a>  fell behind decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3151.293s">I</a>  mean, that's just the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3152.513s">We</a>  fell behind decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3153.854s">And</a>  I don't agree with every decision that the mayors previous have taken, but we are in a situation now where we need <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3161.596s">to</a>  face the facts as they are now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3163.438s">High</a>  inflation, lack of new growth over the last few decades means that we need to do a short-term plan, which is these three questions, and then a long-term plan, which is investing in new growth, which is what our zoning efforts are. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3179.075s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3179.495s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3181.923s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3183.224s">I</a>  appreciate the discussion from my fellow councilors on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3186.525s">I</a>  won't go into the topic of new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3189.146s">My</a>  fellow councilors have covered that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3190.947s">We</a>  are very optimistic about how the council's current work on zoning and permitting, which we've been keeping up for two terms, will continue to accelerate new growth and augment the city's operating budget to the greatest extent possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3204.334s">I</a>  do just want to note that on the issue of free cash, just to, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3208.359s">Different</a>  ways of framing the issue are helpful for me, maybe for other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3215.22s">It's</a>  no secret that we accrued free cash over several years, and that was not dispersed into savings accounts where it could be used and spent on capital expenditures because our city, unlike almost every other city and town in Massachusetts, before this year did not have any stabilization accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3233.504s">Now</a>  we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3234.204s">That</a>  means that that money can go to the purposes that I think <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3237.225s">City</a>  staff and many residents really wanted it to be going to expected it to be going to all along. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3242.548s">Things</a>  like capital expenses and also repairing our infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3246.49s">Putting</a>  aside some of that money that's already been allocated to things that people can see out on the street, helping our DPW and other departments improve life and do basic maintenance in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3255.474s">Even</a>  if you say, okay, let's forget some of those capital expenditures. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3258.476s">Let's</a>  pretend that we still have $25 million in free cash, just using an easy number. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3263.29s">That's</a>  one-eighth of the city's annual operating budget, which means, you know, if it's one-eighth, you can understand how quickly we would run through that if we were using that as things to plug the hole in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3273.975s">And</a>  I do want to emphasize that doesn't include any capital expenses whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3279.618s">Going</a>  back to the resident's question on why now, I think it comes down to we know that free cash is not sustainable. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3287.581s">We</a>  know that we're already full steam on new growth, but we need more and better funding and services for our residents now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3294.686s">And</a>  I think the question is, do we want to punish residents and students for past shortcomings by failing to invest now, or do we want to take this opportunity to start making Medford better for all residents and students in the public schools?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3307.334s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3310.814s">I</a>  think everybody went on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3312.855s">I'd</a>  like to avoid everybody answering every question if we can at all possible, but everyone did give a different answer, which is appreciated context. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3321.76s">I'm</a>  just going to be brief myself to ignore my own advice and say, light poles are falling down. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3328.284s">We</a>  had a meeting two weeks ago where a light pole fell on a public way, and luckily it happened at night, so it didn't hit a car or a person and hurt them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3335.949s">I</a>  mean, that's the situation that we're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3338.79s">We</a>  have finally, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3340.106s">appropriated</a>  some funds to a capital stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3342.787s">We</a>  have a paper on the meeting at seven o'clock to look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3346.588s">We</a>  are in a historic multi-decade deficit where we have massive needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3353.79s">The</a>  free cash that is being spoken of is spoken for. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3357.079s">It</a>  is spoken for, it needs to go to our roads, it needs to go to our schools, it needs to go to fix things that are already broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3364.464s">And</a>  thank you, please stop, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3367.286s">And</a>  that's just reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3370.408s">If</a>  we use that to plug operating budget holes, we'll have to plug those holes with new revenue in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3376.192s">We</a>  can't wait for the new growth from our new zoning, which will take five to 10 years to propagate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3381.796s">And</a>  I don't think any of us want more light posts falling in the sink, we certainly <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3386.579s">should</a>  be grateful that so far they've only been falling at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3390.221s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3390.542s">We'll</a>  go to the podium for the next question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3392.863s">You</a>  have one minute to ask one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3394.284s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Tardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3396.045s">My</a>  name is Maureen Tardelli, 11 Chester Avenue, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3400.848s">And</a>  this is my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3403.322s">where</a>  financial professionals, business owners, residents, firefighters, school administrators, teachers, parents, the chief assessor, and the DPW commissioner, part of the financial task force.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3420.235s">Thank</a>  you for your question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3421.056s">Would</a>  anyone like to answer the question? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3426.24s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3427.807s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3429.108s">The</a>  financial task force was a group explicitly made up of elected to consider the question of what we would put before our elected bodies to deal with solutions around this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3441.258s">However,</a>  I feel really comfortable in saying that all of the. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3445.622s">above</a>  types of people, city staff, members of the community, were consulted in various ways, formally and informally, throughout this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3454.393s">Some</a>  that people talked to, some that members of the financial task force talked to while we were considering these matters that were discussed in our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3462.183s">Some</a>  of that were explicitly consulted. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3464.705s">And</a>  others that have just been part of this greater conversation around what should we do with about what should we do about chronic underfunding in Medford over the course of months and months and years and years of challenges that have led up to this year in which we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3479.477s">Working</a>  together to try to solve these issues once and for all, instead of having budget season after budget season, where the school budget is essentially held hostage by our inability to raise enough money to add to provide the services that residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3494.785s">students</a>  and teachers expect and deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3497.567s">And</a>  I also just want to underline, again, that these ballot questions, every single resident, every single voter in Medford, whether you're a parent, a teacher, a union member, somebody who works for the city, who also lives in the city, you get to use your voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3511.436s">You</a>  get to cast your vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3512.557s">You</a>  can vote yes on all three. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3513.738s">You</a>  can vote no on all three. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3515.019s">You</a>  can choose which ones you feel comfortable voting yes and voting no on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3518.141s">You</a>  are a part of this conversation because every single person who votes gets a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3523.324s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3528.134s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3528.874s">Any</a>  other one? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3529.615s">No,</a>  that's all I have.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3530.295s">Yeah,</a>  I can, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3531.856s">Two</a>  minutes.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3532.456s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3532.916s">So</a>  again, this financial task force was put together without any individual involved in that comment that a young lady put forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3542.981s">This</a>  was done in a bubble. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3544.302s">This</a>  was done behind closed doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3546.503s">It</a>  wasn't planned to educate our seniors, educate our residents, educate our renters, educate our landlords, so they could prepare themselves for what's being asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3557.048s">within</a>  a vote that was presented, a discussion was presented on a Thursday, voted on a Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3564.266s">not</a>  one community meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3565.627s">And</a>  as a matter of fact, I will share this with everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3569.208s">There</a>  was a FOIA request put out by a resident that asked a simple question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3575.551s">They</a>  asked for all of the information, minutes for the meetings, any information, letters, any emails, any text messages, with this financial task force, with any building or any entity within the city to figure out if this is needed or how it will be used and how it can work. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3593.66s">150</a>  pages later, all the information that was in that FOIA request were information about when we can meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3600.703s">Nothing</a>  that's solid. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3602.384s">I</a>  would also share with these parents that are so concerned about what's happening, we were <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3608.527s">saw</a>  the information back from the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3612.251s">The</a>  school department communications director answered by saying, thank you for the FOIA request. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3617.736s">We</a>  apologize for the tardy response. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3620.039s">But</a>  after investigating, there was no school department employee or member of the school department involved in any financial task force <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3630.028s">dealing</a>  with these overrides. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3631.409s">So</a>  what again, what we're saying is we don't know if an override is needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3636.331s">We</a>  know one thing, we know we could fix this issue right now with free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3641.413s">So</a>  our students and teachers and families are fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3644.734s">And</a>  then we go back to the drawing board as a community together to see what we really need. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3650.137s">If</a>  the mayor isn't gonna put new growth out there, she's not gonna work to bring in creatively, bring in funding for the city, then maybe we can look at it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3657.18s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3660.8s">Councilor</a>  Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3663.781s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3697.702s">Yeah,</a>  we'll go back to two minutes.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3699.043s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3700.763s">Free</a>  cash is the term that the state uses for the money that is left over after your budget season has ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3709.968s">So</a>  it's the difference between what you budget, which, let's say, is $180 million, and the amount you spent, which, let's say, is $172 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3714.69s">That</a>  $8 million, which is the difference, is called free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3722.313s">Now,</a>  the state of Massachusetts has a group called the Division of Local Services, and their job is to help cities and towns become financially responsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3732.523s">They</a>  highly recommend that cities and towns in Massachusetts have 3 to 5% of their budget left over in free cash every single year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3742.867s">In</a>  Medford, that amount would be between $5 million and $9 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3747.329s">If</a>  you don't have between 3 and 5% of your budget left over in free cash, you are considered financially irresponsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3753.932s">by</a>  credit agencies and your bond rating goes down. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3757.514s">Now</a>  that is very bad because it changes, just like if your credit rating is bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3761.715s">It</a>  changes the amount that you have to spend anytime you borrow money. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3765.397s">So</a>  we want to be a financially responsible city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3768.698s">So</a>  having money left over in free cash, and I'm going to <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3773.02s">I</a>  have another chart here because I think it's important for people to understand that this city was in the past very financially irresponsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3782.868s">If</a>  you notice that before 2012, we couldn't even meet our budget many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3788.472s">We</a>  definitely never reached that 3% in free cash and our bond rating was terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3794.697s">So</a>  it's only in recent years that we have begun to have anywhere close to the required 3%. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3801.162s">in</a>  free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3802.342s">Now</a>  free cash according to the state of Massachusetts should never be used for an operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3808.284s">It</a>  needs to be used for capital projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3810.444s">We</a>  currently because of underfunding of our roads have $67 million in road debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3815.586s">We</a>  have $79 million in our capital improvement plan for things that need to be done only in the next <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3821.274s">Three</a>  to five years.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3822.995s">So</a>  we cannot use free cash for something like our school budget that is absolutely verboten according to financially responsible people in the state of Massachusetts.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3835.643s">Wrong.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3835.843s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3837.084s">Tell</a>  them the truth, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3838.224s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3841.294s">As</a>  a member of the financial task force, it was very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3845.955s">We</a>  actually had a lot of public meetings called fiscal 23 budget process, fiscal 24 budget process, fiscal 25 budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3854.118s">I</a>  think a lot of folks remember if you're watching those meetings, me sitting in that chair in 2022 and being pretty hard on this mayor because we didn't have the information that we needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3867.503s">and</a>  working to establish a task force, working to establish a budget ordinance, working to establish a flow of information, and hear from stakeholders, all the stakeholders that were mentioned in the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3880.017s">What</a>  do we need? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3881.178s">What</a>  are we not seeing happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3882.659s">Why</a>  are we in the situation that we're in? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3884.82s">That</a>  resulted this year in the earliest budget process we've had with meetings before we got the budget, input from the council and the public before the mayor presented a budget, and a full and accounting of what our serious structural deficit is for our schools and for this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3905.193s">We</a>  know that we need more money to do what people want the city to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3909.517s">We're</a>  asking the voters to do that, and that's what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3913.818s">If</a>  the voters say no, then we will have to make cuts, and we will do that, because that is what the voters decided. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3919.259s">If</a>  the voters choose to vote yes, then we will have the financial resources that we need to do our jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3925.8s">That</a>  is essentially what happened, and that is essentially the choice before us as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3930.741s">When</a>  we want to talk about the financial task force, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3933.402s">was</a>  announced in a public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3935.183s">There</a>  are a bunch of public releases from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3937.585s">Every</a>  step of the way, we're starting to meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3940.327s">Here's</a>  what we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3941.829s">Here's</a>  what we're considering for the framework. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3943.71s">Here</a>  is the final framework. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3945.251s">The</a>  specifics were discussed extensively in council meetings and school committee meetings for a year, that these were our budget needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3953.578s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3957.432s">We'll</a>  go to the podium for the next question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3959.493s">Mr.</a>  Jones, name and address the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3961.033s">You</a>  have a minute for your question.</p>

    <p>[Bob Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3962.614s">Yes,</a>  sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3963.114s">Bob</a>  Jones, 5 St. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3964.355s">Mary</a>  Street, Medford Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3965.615s">I'd</a>  like to start with expressing my condolences for Larry Lepore, the city messenger. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3970.297s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3970.998s">Great</a>  guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3971.758s">Probably</a>  one of the longest serving city employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3974.679s">He's</a>  always there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3975.419s">He's</a>  been a staple there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3976.32s">He's</a>  always done a great job.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3977.48s">And</a>  I'm going to give you another 15 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3979.081s">I</a>  just want to say for folks who have joined since I started the meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3982.282s">We're</a>  going to be talking about Larry at our meeting after this, and I hope folks have something they want to share. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3986.444s">We'll</a>  stick around. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3987.104s">We</a>  want to hear.</p>

    <p>[Bob Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3987.604s">He</a>  will be missed.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3988.885s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bob Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3989.345s">And</a>  I thank you for this format as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3992.706s">There</a>  are so many things I'd like to ask, and I have to keep it in one, but it's regarding the financial task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3998.108s">So</a>  the financial task, correct me if I go wrong here, was Councilor Bears, Councilor Collins, school committee person, Jenny Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4007.403s">Mayor</a>  Lungo-Koehn, and Nina Nazarian, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4009.825s">Yes,</a>  yes.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4010.526s">Okay,</a>  so there was no- It was Councilor Morell before January. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4013.349s">Councilor</a>  Morell, okay.</p>

    <p>[Bob Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4014.07s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4014.61s">So</a>  the auditor of the city was not present, was not part of the force, the task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4018.774s">The</a>  assessor was not part of the task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4021.037s">The</a>  school finance director was not part of the task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4024.4s">And</a>  let's see, one other person.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4026.021s">Financial</a>  director.</p>

    <p>[Bob Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4027.083s">Financial</a>  director, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4030.472s">Bob</a>  Dixon, he was not part of the task force, correct, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4033.654s">So</a>  now, understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4036.095s">Where</a>  can I find the documents, any data, calculations, discussions, any sort of metrics that were used from the financial task force to show how the numbers of 30 million for the debt exclusion and a prop two and a half of seven and a half million <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4058.137s">and</a>  how was that determined? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4059.538s">The</a>  30 million was not stated in the debt exclusion, which is, no, it's never stated in a debt exclusion, I believe, amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4067.624s">So</a>  I'm just wondering where that came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4070.106s">I'm</a>  hearing from the administration, 30 million and not a dime more. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4074.209s">So</a>  that's something I've heard offhand. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4077.232s">So</a>  that's my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4078.012s">Where</a>  can I find documents from the Financial Task Force showing how these discussions, numbers, and figures were determined?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4085.731s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4086.331s">I'll</a>  go to Vice President Collins, two minutes.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4089.914s">Thank</a>  you for the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4091.856s">Again,</a>  speaking as a member of the financial task force, I want to try to put this a different way because maybe I wasn't, I want to try putting this differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4101.403s">The</a>  financial task force, this group of electeds, tasked with- And the chief of staff.</p>

    <p>[Bob Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4108.809s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4109.109s">Electeds</a>  and the chief of staff.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4110.911s">As</a>  the mayor's staff.</p>

    <p>[Bob Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4112.232s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4114.189s">If</a>  I had a staff person, I probably want them with me taking notes as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4120.114s">Our</a>  assignment was to create a proposal for a political solution to a community-wide problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4126.18s">And</a>  that is why this task force was made up of electeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4129.242s">I</a>  think folks who are asking the question, rightfully so, of why did you come up with what you came up with should <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4139.801s">look</a>  to the hours and hours of tape that we have the public meetings that we've had in this chambers between the city council and the school committee where we discussed that question in terms of why seven and a half million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4154.619s">Gosh,</a>  there's a lot of school committee meetings enumerating exactly what we cut in various different budget scenarios to back up why we think that this is the number that is at the nexus of what we know that we need and what we think that we can reasonably ask of the residents to strike that sweet spot between <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4171.044s">trying</a>  to maintain an equitable and deserved school experience for Medford Public School students with something that the community can be comfortable with and can say yes to. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4182.393s">It</a>  is our job as people who run for offices, instead of going to planning school and trying to get a job in City Hall, to try to come up with, for lack of a better word, political solutions to real life community-wide problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4195.804s">That</a>  is what the task force sought to do, and now everybody gets the chance to vote on it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4201.323s">Thank</a>  you, anyone else? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4202.163s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4203.044s">Sure,</a>  let me help you, Mr. Jones. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4206.545s">This</a>  financial task force was a farce. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4208.905s">There</a>  was a lack of transparency throughout. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4211.126s">When</a>  you speak on, I speak to this in where I worked in 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4216.988s">When</a>  we met in a possible override in a neighboring community, we talked about three things. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4221.449s">It</a>  was how do we get here? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4223.009s">What</a>  do we do to fix it? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4224.55s">And</a>  how does this happen again? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4226.25s">And</a>  those people brought in <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4228.991s">mines</a>  from Tufts, Harvard, MIT, Medford, not one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4233.534s">They</a>  brought in their financial team, Medford, not one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4237.077s">They</a>  had their assessor set the rate so people can understand, assessor was never involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4241.906s">When</a>  you look at how this was done, this was done in a bubble, this was presented on a Thursday, and then voted for in the budget meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4249.273s">If</a>  you look at the budget meetings, when I brought up the way to fix it, which is free cash, and I'll disagree with my fellow Councilor, because she's wrong 1,000%. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4261.284s">Free</a>  cash for divisional local services, it's not recommended, but not against the law to use free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4269.182s">3</a>  to 5% annual budget, FY24 method generated $9 million to add to a $25 million estimate, which means the city had around 16% of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4281.831s">But</a>  again, the solution was very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4284.732s">Let's</a>  have this financial task force present this to the community, because that's what I asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4289.616s">I</a>  asked my colleagues, when are we going to present what the findings were? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4293.198s">There</a>  were no findings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4294.479s">It</a>  was just given, we're going to do an override. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4296.42s">People</a>  came up, shared, the mayor was happy, and it was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4299.382s">The</a>  truth of the matter is, you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4302.405s">There</a>  was no one involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4304.066s">This</a>  was done in a bubble to scare people, to come out and say, the schools, the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4310.472s">And</a>  I'll say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4311.252s">I</a>  said this in April. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4312.133s">I</a>  said it in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4312.714s">I'll</a>  say it today again. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4314.996s">We</a>  might need an override, but if we do it right, with open and transparent government, we could do something great. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4321.361s">Now</a>  remember, with one override in every other community, there's two, three to follow, and don't forget, this council's gonna ask for a 200 to $400 million debt exclusion from New High School, which we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4332.611s">So</a>  this is fear. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4334.954s">Please</a>  don't be confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4336.555s">We're</a>  not telling you the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4337.736s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4338.136s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4339.257s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bob Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4345.883s">There's</a>  no follow-up, sorry, Bob. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4348.225s">I'm</a>  trying to clarify something that was just spoken about by the two councils here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4352.347s">Okay,</a>  is this about free cash? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4354.088s">It's</a>  about free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4355.029s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4355.269s">Three</a>  to five percent is a total, an aggregate total, not every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4360.352s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4361.193s">So</a>  that's where that figure comes from.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4363.074s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4363.554s">Just,</a>  I wanted to answer your question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4365.256s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4365.656s">I</a>  think you heard a good story, but the fact of the matter is, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4371.971s">There</a>  were five members of the financial task force, the council president, the council vice president, the chair of the school committee, who's the mayor, the vice chair of the school committee, and the chief of staff for the mayor, who administratively runs city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4383.54s">Those</a>  were the members of the task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4386.943s">Those</a>  were the members of the task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4389.158s">Did</a>  we talk to other people? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4390.719s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4391.98s">The</a>  $3 million number comes from the school finance director from the fiscal 25 budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4397.705s">$500,000</a>  number for the DPW street and sidewalk group comes from the DPW commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4402.349s">The</a>  $4 million number for the question eight, that comes also from the fiscal 25 and 24 school budget process from the finance director, from many of the administrators in the Medford public schools talking about, this is what we need to do the things that people are asking us to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4417.462s">And</a>  the $30 million bond number for the fire headquarters came from the mayor, the chief of staff, and the fire chief based on the design process for the new headquarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4427.19s">That's</a>  where it came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4428.692s">It's</a>  not a bubble. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4429.953s">It's</a>  not we didn't talk to anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4431.334s">It's</a>  not we made things up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4433.075s">There</a>  have been documented meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4434.777s">We</a>  talked to other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4436.098s">We</a>  engaged the <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4437.799s">folks</a>  who have the information in the city and said, if we're trying to address these problems, what would it cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4443.805s">And</a>  that's what the proposals are. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4445.426s">I</a>  mean, it's plain as day. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4447.288s">We</a>  have, again, public statements and documents for a year talking about the process, the membership, the framework, and the final result. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4456.076s">We</a>  have budget meetings and documents for over <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4460.103s">two</a>  and a half, three years, dozens of recordings of this body and the school committee talking about these needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4467.89s">So</a>  I encourage folks to look at the last three budget processes, because they'll pretty much get you exactly the numbers that you'll see on the ballot on November 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4475.916s">And</a>  that's why we're asking voters to vote yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4477.918s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4480.58s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4482.151s">I'm</a>  sorry, just to go back on that 3 to 5% thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4484.993s">It's</a>  not 3 to 5% in totality. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4486.713s">It</a>  actually is recommended to generate 3 to 5% in free cash every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4491.036s">So</a>  that is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4492.717s">I'm</a>  not sure where you're getting.</p>

    <p>[Bob Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4494.358s">I'm</a>  going to agree with this view on that.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4497.639s">You</a>  can Google it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4498.64s">You</a>  can look it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4499.32s">I</a>  encourage you to. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4501.161s">But</a>  the point is, you generate three to 5% in free cash, and then it goes that can aggregate over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4506.984s">And</a>  then that can go towards one time capital expenditures, like for instance, two new fire trucks for the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4513.427s">That's</a>  how these big, that's how these sort of, I'd say, midsize expenses are accounted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4520.003s">Again,</a>  if I have a savings account and I'm living above my means, then eventually the savings account would run out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4531.491s">So</a>  you're not supposed to plug the school budget every single year with free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4537.594s">because</a>  it would run out eventually. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4540.115s">We</a>  did that with $1.75 million this past year with the understanding that we would then do an override to try to fix the problem in the long term. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4549.658s">Free</a>  cash is not a long-term solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4552.459s">That</a>  keeps getting repeated, and I really just want to drive the point home. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4556.04s">It</a>  is not actually an answer to this problem.</p>

    <p>[Bob Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4559.285s">It</a>  is a choice that can be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4562.11s">I</a>  believe the bond rating is based on the total free cash.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4565.855s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Jones. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4566.636s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4567.097s">We'll</a>  go to Zoom for the next question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4569.26s">We'll</a>  go to Zoe Moutsos. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4571.063s">One</a>  minute to ask your question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4572.345s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Zoe Moutsos]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4575.323s">Hi</a>  Zoe Muzo's 33 Johnson Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4579.204s">I'm</a>  really appreciative that the city after 40 years has decided to allow the voters to decide on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4585.886s">I</a>  have taken my time to educate myself by listening to school committee meetings and <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4591.368s">which</a>  were heartbreaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4592.47s">I've</a>  listened to these city council meetings, and I feel confident and not afraid, or like I'm being scared, about how we got here, how we're gonna fix it, and how we make sure it happens again. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4603.645s">My</a>  question does revolve around free cash, because as I understand it, we... <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4607.691s">have</a>  allocated some of that money that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4610.612s">Like</a>  I've heard things like we, well, we plugged the city school budget, but also potentially fixing HVAC at the middle schools, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4622.356s">So</a>  I'd like to know what's been used up, how much is left, and in the event that the override doesn't pass and we use free cash again, what are the rim of using it up and not having that rainy day fund, which I think have already been answered.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4636.803s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4637.384s">Go</a>  to members of the council to answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4644.076s">Councilor</a>  Leming, two minutes.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4645.897s">So</a>  in terms of how much free cash we actually have left, I don't have the numbers right in front of me, but I'm just remembering the expenditures off the top of my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4656.42s">I</a>  believe after it was certified this past June, the number was 34 million, but I believe enough of that has been earmarked for various one-time expenditures at this point so that the actual number is, correct me if I'm wrong, would be about <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4671.222s">10</a>  to 11 million in reserves right now just because I see so much I can see someone shaking their head in the audience but I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4682.905s">So</a>  again, this is ballpark numbers because we did allocate free cash first for the stabilization funds, which recently went to things like those light posts that were falling over, that were, you know, rusted. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4698.65s">They</a>  went to $3 million for the MSBA study. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4703.732s">It</a>  went to pay for HVAC systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4707.833s">It</a>  went to pay for, there was a, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4713.5s">Yeah,</a>  there's a long list of items that were in some memos from a couple of months ago that I think some of my colleagues could help me out.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4724.48s">We'll</a>  go to Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4727.182s">two</a>  minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4727.942s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4728.402s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4729.183s">Um,</a>  I mean, continuing off of Councilor Leming's points, those conversations are ones that we're having in public. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4735.704s">I</a>  believe that there's an upcoming City Committee of the Whole meeting at some point that we're going to talk about some of how free cash is going to be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4744.286s">I</a>  know the mayor submitted a paper to us with her proposal and asking us for feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4749.467s">That's</a>  all in the council records. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4750.888s">It's</a>  all online for folks to find as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4755.809s">Here's</a>  the thing about free cash, right, because it's a one time fund, we should be using it on one time expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4762.219s">And</a>  that's why we're using it on things like roads on the light poles that President Bears was talking about on HVAC systems and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4772.233s">We</a>  all know that these are real things that affect how we experience living in our city, affects our kids in our public buildings, and so they are very important expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4781.242s">Now,</a>  added on top of that is the conversation we would have if we didn't spend that money right now, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4787.649s">Because</a>  if we defer maintenance, which I think everyone in the audience today <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4792.398s">acknowledges</a>  this has been happening in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4795.14s">If</a>  we defer maintenance, those costs go up as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4797.902s">And</a>  so we need to basically map out all of our uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4801.464s">And</a>  that's why our city has been implementing our capital improvement plans, why we've started to take registries of everything that <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4809.97s">that</a>  we're falling behind on maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4812.874s">Our</a>  buildings director is really good with that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4815.838s">And</a>  so that's why those funds should be allocated to things like that rather than being used one time on recurring expenses that we can't afford in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4826.092s">So</a>  I feel very strongly about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4828.113s">The</a>  bond agencies feel very strongly about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4830.953s">And</a>  in fact, if we take the free cash and use that free cash on recurring expenses, it's widely known that the bond agencies would lower our credit rating, as Councilor Callahan mentioned, and our costs for borrowing to do that maintenance work in the future would actually go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4845.618s">And</a>  so that's something that would be an increased cost on all of us as taxpayers in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4852.336s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4854.458s">Another</a>  fair tactic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4855.559s">So</a>  people should understand the mayor came out just the other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4858.401s">We</a>  had 34 million, 34.5 million as of July 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4863.284s">The</a>  mayor, just so you know, what free cash is, it's your money. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4866.847s">So</a>  when we say we're going to fund 50 teachers and we don't pay those 50 teachers because they don't hire them, that money goes into free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4875.414s">That's</a>  our money, that's your tax money. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4877.415s">and</a>  then it could be used for what it needs to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4879.836s">So</a>  it's truly mismanagement of funds from our leadership team. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4884.939s">It's</a>  taking what we sign off on our budget and not use correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4889.461s">So</a>  what we have right now, I believe I've said this, Councilor Leming said it over and over again, I'm not saying use free cash every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4897.385s">We</a>  have a deficit right now, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4900.606s">that</a>  we can correct right now and not put the schools and kids and teachers in fear and say let's level fund that budget using one time free cash one time and then look into what options we have later but let's listen to the mayor what she said 34.5 million <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4916.394s">Now</a>  she knows the override's gonna be a fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4918.476s">What</a>  does she do? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4919.476s">Boom,</a>  she starts putting all these different monies in different accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4923.139s">So</a>  from her words exactly in her video the other day, we have 18.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4928.944s">With</a>  that said, we can still take funding to level the school budget and still have 14, $15 million, which still leaves enough in there that would appease any bond rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4940.553s">So</a>  again, let's not get scared because that's a scare tactic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4944.356s">Let's</a>  see the bond rating so we can move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4946.938s">Now,</a>  when we look at this situation, council, different communities, free cash, Arlington is 18 million, Framingham 14 million, bigger budget, Quincy 1.2 million, bigger budget, Andover 14 million, Newton, these communities are bigger than ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4964.739s">We</a>  have this budget, they function with lower funding and free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4971.183s">So</a>  understand this, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4972.724s">We</a>  can do this one-time cost to save the fare from our schools, take care of our seniors, our renters, our homeowners, so we can stop the fare in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4982.489s">So</a>  please, vote no on these overrides.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5033.681s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5035.001s">Not</a>  to put too fine a point on it, but I think we've all acknowledged behind the rail <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5040.879s">that</a>  we have problems this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5042.6s">And</a>  let's say hypothetically that our free cash was not already allocated to capital funds that our department heads have been advocating for in many cases for years and years and years and being pushed off because we didn't have the money to allocate towards those capital expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5057.472s">And</a>  now we're finally able to start chipping away at that very, very long list of projects on our capital improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5064.338s">Let's</a>  just put aside that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5067.637s">and</a>  say, hypothetically, what if we still had unallocated free cash that we could use on an operating budget, which we don't because it's allocated to capital projects? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5077.041s">I</a>  think that there's a shared acknowledgment behind this rail that that does put us back at square one, and we have to revisit this conversation again in May for fiscal 26 with no better solutions than we do now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5089.566s">So</a>  I've asked myself, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5091.852s">What</a>  would I cut if we then approaching fiscal 26 with no better off because new growth takes five to 10 years to really flourish into that robustly improved commercial tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5105.555s">And</a>  we haven't taken advantage of accelerating our tax levy so that we can try to get in fighting distance of where inflation has put us as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5118.092s">And</a>  now we don't have the cash reserves that again are hypothetical at this point because we already know that we need them for capital expenses and we have to balance the budget for fiscal 26. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5127.715s">What</a>  would I cut?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5128.295s">30</a>  seconds.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5130.016s">There's</a>  nothing to cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5131.176s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5132.097s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5134.237s">Anyone</a>  else from the council want to go on this question? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5138.854s">Just</a>  to Councilor Leming's point, there was the $34 million certified balance at the end of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5143.497s">$6</a>  million went to a stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5147.018s">$5</a>  million went to a capital stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5150.06s">$1</a>  million of that has already been spent on emergency capital repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5153.422s">$3</a>  million went to the MSBA feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5157.364s">The</a>  mayor also outlined an additional $9.5 million, $2.5 million for fire department fleet replacements, $2 million for the pension liability, which we have to fund by 2034. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5169.008s">$2</a>  million per year for fiscal year 25 capital improvements, $2 million for fiscal year 26 capital improvements, $1 million to match federal and state money to renovate the Hegner Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5179.474s">We</a>  also have the estimated $15 million that we heard the other week from Assistant Superintendent Cushing to fix the HVAC at the Andrews Middle School and McGlynn K-8 school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5190.3s">Councilor</a>  Callahan has noted the $67 million in road debt, $35 million in sidewalk debt, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5196.301s">People</a>  have noted the school water issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5200.405s">As</a>  Mr. Belson said, we made money on those schools, but apparently we did it because we didn't put the right stuff in for water. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5206.369s">So</a>  I just spent all 35 million right there on things that are urgent, right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5213.275s">We're</a>  still gonna have to prioritize these urgent capital needs with that free cash and stabilization fund money.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5219.039s">There's</a>  18.5 left.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5221.221s">Yeah,</a>  that's plus there's the money in the stabilization funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5224.824s">Yeah,</a>  I just went beyond that though.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5226.826s">It's</a>  called scare tactics.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5228.027s">It's</a>  not a scare tactic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5229.068s">It's</a>  just math. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5230.989s">It's</a>  just math. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5231.75s">That</a>  is the need of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5233.271s">I</a>  could not name you a community in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5235.413s">Is</a>  that the math that the task force has? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5236.854s">Councilor</a>  Scavalli, please don't interrupt me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5238.876s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5239.316s">I</a>  don't interrupt you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5239.977s">Please</a>  don't interrupt me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5241.158s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5243.199s">Those</a>  are the figures. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5244.1s">Those</a>  are our needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5246.442s">Those</a>  are the capital needs of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5248.484s">So</a>  I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5250.902s">The</a>  math is pretty clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5254.384s">Go</a>  to the podium for our next question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5256.045s">One</a>  minute, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Nick Giurleo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5259.927s">Good</a>  evening, Nick Giurleo, G-I-U-R-L-E-O, 40 Robinson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5264.409s">So</a>  on the subject of the math, my question relates to essentially, you know, these overrides and so-called consequences of not passing them, of not approving them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5276.153s">So</a>  we're hearing kind of these expressions of certainty described what will happen if the overrides don't pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5281.494s">We've</a>  heard from Councilor Bears, there will be cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5284.534s">We've</a>  heard from Councilor Leming, the roads won't be repaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5287.875s">So</a>  my question is, you know, where is this math? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5289.875s">I</a>  mean, where is, for the average citizen who's not a mathematician, you know, where are we going to see this data that shows that these consequences will actually result if these overrides don't pass? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5301.617s">I've</a>  looked and I haven't really been able to find anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5303.878s">So</a>  where do I go?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5308.393s">Anyone</a>  wanna go for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5309.433s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5310.994s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5311.274s">I'm</a>  sure that my fellow councilors will add to this list, but just to reference some of the data points that have been coming up multiple times in this meeting in particular, I'd guide you to the pavement management plan that was put out by the DPW some years ago, and that's a few years out of date now, but it details the- It was actually updated last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5328.939s">Oh,</a>  nevermind. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5329.819s">Updated</a>  last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5331.219s">That</a>  details the $200 million in <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5337.401s">backlog</a>  of road repairs that are needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5340.123s">For</a>  more detail on the needs in the schools, I would direct you to really any of the budget cycles, the recent budget cycles, school committee meetings, FY23 or FY24, which I think go into the level of detail that folks are really curious about when it comes to what is at stake, what actually does go on the chopping block each year, and that is brought back depending on ESSER funding, when that was available, or other one-time funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5362.429s">And</a>  I think that the capital improvement plan is also a really interesting augment to those operating costs that show how much money really needs to be funded to on the infrastructural and maintenance side that we are really waiting to have the funding for.</p>

    <p>[Nick Giurleo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5376.181s">Yeah,</a>  but data on- We're not doing follow-ups.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5378.642s">It's</a>  just a clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5379.742s">It's</a>  not a follow-up, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5381.443s">What's</a>  the question?</p>

    <p>[Nick Giurleo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5382.383s">To</a>  her response.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5383.384s">Well,</a>  we're not doing that, so I'd appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5385.424s">What?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5385.865s">We're</a>  just asking one question.</p>

    <p>[Nick Giurleo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5387.585s">Okay,</a>  just clarifying her answer, because I'm not quite understanding.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5391.247s">We'll</a>  go, we'll think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5393.347s">Who's</a>  next? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5395.548s">Councilor</a>  Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5397.429s">I'm</a>  just trying to enforce the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5400.25s">Let</a>  me rephrase that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5401.19s">I'll</a>  think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5402.111s">Councilor</a>  Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5405.444s">Oh,</a>  we're giving the answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5407.205s">Councilor</a>  Leming, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5408.745s">Councilor</a>  Leming, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5412.126s">I'd</a>  just like to really emphasize that if you're interested in learning more about the shortfalls in the school, in the Medford Public Schools budget, then the videos and the presentations that were given during the budget season at the Medford School Committee meetings, I believe around June, would be where you want to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5432.612s">So</a>  those are on YouTube. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5433.752s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5435.424s">Thank</a>  you, anyone else wanna answer the question? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5437.005s">Sure,</a>  Mr. President, thank you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5438.685s">So</a>  again, Mr. Giglio, these are all scare tactics. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5443.667s">Again,</a>  the financial task force didn't have the FOIA requests that shows that there were no documentations, no minutes, no information given. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5453.85s">We</a>  heard the assessor, we know all the major parties, the school department, the assessor, the finance director, weren't involved in these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5462.333s">This</a>  is, it's not a lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5464.594s">We</a>  just said it, you heard it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5466.314s">Put</a>  30 seconds back on for interrupting me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5468.735s">We</a>  have the understanding that the sky is falling. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5474.177s">All</a>  of these projects that we need to fix, we need to fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5477.498s">In</a>  normal communities, what we do is we bond these projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5481.079s">When</a>  we look at situations that we talked about earlier, when it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5486.181s">What</a>  we're trying, what we're seeing here right now, Mr. Joyo, it's the underfunding of local revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5496.209s">One</a>  second, I'll just, it's the focus of what we're seeing that our community has done for years here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5502.673s">And</a>  that's show lower meals tax and hotel tax and excise tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5507.997s">So</a>  then when it comes higher, you can put that and use it for whatever you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5511.279s">Let</a>  that be known, the understanding what you're asking for, there are no numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5515.542s">The</a>  problem we hear right now, why the city's divided, why our seniors are scared, why our landlords are scared, why our homeowners and renters are afraid right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5523.607s">Why</a>  our students and parents and teachers are afraid is because this group did something. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5529.193s">They</a>  put it out there without any true information. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5531.956s">So</a>  we don't know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5533.337s">We</a>  haven't been educated. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5534.699s">That's</a>  why there's so much fear. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5536.36s">The</a>  firefighters aren't supporting a $30 million fire station, because again, there was no transparency there when it came to the final decision that had to be made for 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5544.449s">And</a>  they've decided to go public. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5546.471s">They</a>  decided to go public to say, let's not hurt our taxpayers with whatever, how many it's going to be, because we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5553.656s">It</a>  could be a $50 million fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5555.758s">But</a>  the design was never put forth to the firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5559.601s">So</a>  when you say totality, six, seven, and eight, we haven't been involved, Mr. Gileo. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5564.445s">There</a>  are no numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5565.465s">There</a>  is no information. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5566.826s">Because</a>  this group did it in the financial task force that presented it on a Thursday, voted on it on a Tuesday, and then <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5574.352s">We</a>  find $9 million in free cash after that, that the man knew was certified.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5579.356s">30</a>  seconds? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5579.777s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5581.078s">What</a>  is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5581.738s">You're</a>  over by 20 seconds.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5583.059s">Oh,</a>  can I say one more thing?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5584.841s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5587.723s">You'll</a>  get it on the next round, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5589.525s">I'm</a>  sure you'll get it on the next round. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5590.626s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5591.867s">Anyone</a>  else want to comment here from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5593.928s">You</a>  already went, Vice President Collins, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5597.912s">No</a>  one gets mad when I don't let Councilor Collins talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5602.261s">I'm</a>  just trying to enforce the rules here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5603.881s">If</a>  you have a quick clarification on the kind of data you're asking for, I'd be interested to hear it.</p>

    <p>[Nick Giurleo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5609.182s">I'm</a>  just, the clarification I'm requesting here is, are we saying that various reports and data showing that there are certain needs are the same thing as saying that if we don't pass this overrides, that this X or Y will happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5624.765s">Are</a>  those two exactly equivalent? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5626.146s">They</a>  don't seem exactly equivalent to me.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5628.527s">I</a>  can answer that and I'll put my clock on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5632.85s">So</a>  for much of it, for the school budget, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5637.432s">The</a>  school budget director outlined in the budget meetings in April and May and June, this is what would be cut if we didn't have these funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5645.157s">And</a>  this is what would have to be cut if we don't have these funds in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5647.858s">So</a>  in that case, it is an exact one-to-one. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5650.46s">And</a>  that's true for all of question seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5652.661s">When</a>  we talk about the DPW, the director said, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5656.704s">to</a>  run the machines four days a week instead of two or four days a month, I need this much staff, this is how much that crew would cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5664.249s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5665.33s">For</a>  the debt exclusion for the fire station, Councilor Scarpelli already noted, right, we have bond capacity, we're maxed on our bond capacity, we have a library on the bond capacity, we have a police station on the bond capacity, we have school, MHS labs on the bond capacity, we're pretty much maxed on the bond capacity here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5681.08s">And,</a>  okay, well,</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5685.903s">We</a>  wouldn't know that because it's literally in the budget.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5688.785s">You're</a>  wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5689.605s">It's</a>  in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5690.546s">You're</a>  wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5691.066s">I'm</a>  not wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5691.767s">I</a>  read the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5694.088s">So</a>  when we talk about the information that's available to the public, there's information from the school budget process, from the city budget process that outlines these needs very clearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5705.695s">There</a>  have been charts and tables and narratives and <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5711.098s">whatever</a>  other form of data analysis you want has likely been presented at these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5714.824s">So</a>  there is information out there, there is data out there, and when we talk about the decisions made by the financial task force, while other members of the city staff were not members of the financial task force, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5726.721s">they</a>  were consulted, these issues were discussed with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5729.925s">So</a>  that is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5733.389s">And</a>  we can continue to try to present the math and information in a different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5736.913s">And</a>  I'm sure that we will continue to try to get that information out there as best as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5741.738s">But</a>  the city has incredible needs, significant needs, and funding is needed to meet them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5749.923s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5750.343s">I</a>  only have one hand raised on Zoom, but it's iPhone 109. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5755.049s">If</a>  you would please rename yourself so that we know that you're a person, I'll then recognize you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5760.936s">Until</a>  then, I'll go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5762.257s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5763.458s">You</a>  have one minute for your questions.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5765.461s">Ron</a>  Giovino, 326 East Border Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5767.823s">My</a>  question has to do with the financial task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5771.038s">As</a>  a proud member of both the Columbus Renaming Committee and the newly ending Charter Committee, we had rules of agenda reporting, minute reporting, public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5783.205s">I</a>  would like somebody to answer the question, what makes this task force exempt from that? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5787.668s">And</a>  my final comment is nobody in this room thinks the school system or the city services are fully funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5793.994s">Trust</a>  me, nobody does. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5795.435s">The</a>  question we have in front of us is, is this the Band-Aid that is gonna get us through until the next time we convene for the next two and a half proposal or the ominous 200 million plus renovation of the school? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5809.408s">That's</a>  what we're voting on today. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5810.989s">Appreciate</a>  your answers.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5812.03s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5815.478s">Anyone</a>  wanna go for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5817.539s">I</a>  can do the financial task force part. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5820.601s">Anyone</a>  wanna talk about the sufficiency of the size of the override? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5826.545s">Councilor</a>  Leming, two minutes.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5828.308s">So</a>  for the size of the override, what I'll say is that we got, we went 44 years without an override, and this is the first time that we're asking the voters to do an override, which has become very commonplace in other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5846.658s">And</a>  so, yeah, if we, you know, there potentially is, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5853.301s">a</a>  debt exclusion in the future for the high school as a capital project, but just in terms of level expenses, the overrides are a mechanism to undo, to overcome the effects of inflation long-term. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5869.773s">So</a>  I will just point out that we've gone this long without an override, and this is the first time that we're asking for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5877.867s">We've</a>  survived pretty long so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5881.669s">And</a>  we're pretty late to the game, to be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5886.753s">Will</a>  another override be needed in another 44 years? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5890.635s">Maybe,</a>  because inflation will keep going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5894.017s">But</a>  right now, we know that we need this, or else, again, the roads will continue to be in the state that they're in, and we will have to have <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5904.376s">a</a>  lot of layoffs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5905.357s">That's</a>  not a scare tactic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5906.457s">That's</a>  just the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5907.798s">It's</a>  just math. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5908.739s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5912.34s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5914.181s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro, two minutes.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5917.923s">We</a>  are, I would paraphrase Councilor Leming and say that we aren't all even asking for an override. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5926.588s">We</a>  are giving the voters of Medford the opportunity to <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5931.724s">raise</a>  their own taxes if they would like. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5934.027s">You</a>  can vote now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5934.988s">You're</a>  allowed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5935.589s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5936.63s">We're</a>  here to answer questions about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5941.457s">not</a>  to convince anybody to do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5943.358s">We're</a>  just telling you what we know and what we have the luxury of knowing from having this job. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5950.624s">Another</a>  thing I will say is that historic underfunding has led to, and having never passed an override before, has led to such scenarios as me receiving an email that there is lead in the water at the Brooks Elementary School where my kids go because of fixtures <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5970.129s">in</a>  the building in a school that was built after the year 2000 because corners were cut because money was tried. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5978.315s">They</a>  were trying to save money when they built the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5980.677s">That's</a>  what happens when you don't fund your city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5984.7s">So</a>  we can keep trying to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5987.022s">We</a>  can keep trying to not fund our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5990.168s">That's</a>  a choice that the voters have. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5992.949s">And</a>  everybody, that's democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5995.251s">So</a>  we all have the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5997.292s">Everybody</a>  has the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5998.872s">So</a>  we're here to answer your questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6000.433s">We're</a>  not trying to say you're good or you're bad or you're doing whatever, but I really hope, I hope that we are making decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6011.439s">They</a>  might be hard decisions, but we're making decisions that are taking care of each other, that are prioritizing the people that we care about. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6021.184s">understanding</a>  the fiscal responsibility that we have towards each other.</p>
