[SPEAKER_04]: 24475 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

15
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:22,922
[SPEAKER_04]: be it resolved that the Medford City Council hold a question and answer session to discuss the definitions and terminology regarding the proposed Proposition 2.5 overrides and the proposed debt exclusion measure.

16
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:25,873
[SPEAKER_04]: To that resolution, the following amendments were added.

17
00:02:25,993 --> 00:02:30,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli asked that the administration and Council on Aging do outreach to seniors about this meeting.

18
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:36,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan requested outreach to parents of school-aged children, not just teachers, and specifically requested outreach to the PTOs.

19
00:02:37,722 --> 00:02:46,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng requested general outreach and specifically requested that the community liaisons translate into other languages the information that is on the city website about the overrides and the debt exclusion.

20
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:54,996
[SPEAKER_04]: To ensure that the council is able to answer questions in a timely manner and that decorum is maintained, the council president, myself, will be enforcing the following rules.

21
00:02:55,016 --> 00:02:57,759
[SPEAKER_04]: One, members of the public will have one minute to ask one question.

22
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:04,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Members of the public will not be able to ask a second question until all who seek to ask a question have had the chance to ask their first question.

23
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:11,072
[SPEAKER_04]: The president will verbally request that residents not ask duplicative or largely similar questions to questions that have already been answered.

24
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:14,983
[SPEAKER_04]: and may move to the next question if a duplicative or similar question is asked.

25
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:18,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Each Councilor will have up to two minutes to answer per question.

26
00:03:19,045 --> 00:03:29,030
[SPEAKER_04]: The president will verbally request the Councilors not answer if a duplicative or largely similar answer has been given by another Councilor and may move to the next question if a duplicative or similar answer is given.

27
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:37,435
[SPEAKER_04]: After members of the public have had the chance to ask their first question, the president will open the floor to either a second question or a short public comment by members of the public in attendance.

28
00:03:38,615 --> 00:03:40,016
[SPEAKER_04]: And before we start, I just want to say,

29
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,282
[SPEAKER_04]: that the council itself is in mourning today.

30
00:03:44,602 --> 00:03:48,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Last night, we lost our city messenger, Larry Lepore, who has served us for many years.

31
00:03:49,844 --> 00:03:56,167
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be having some condolence remarks made at our regular meeting that will begin after our committee of the whole meeting.

32
00:03:57,108 --> 00:04:06,552
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope that folks will stick around if you knew Larry or otherwise to say a kind word or story that you may have shared with him during his many years serving the city behind this rail.

33
00:04:08,018 --> 00:04:11,419
[SPEAKER_04]: With that, I do want to invite our city assessor, Ted Costigan.

34
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:19,042
[SPEAKER_04]: The council had requested some answers and updates from him, and I know that he's here to share some information that his office has been working on.

35
00:04:19,182 --> 00:04:22,484
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that, I will go to our assessor, Ted Costigan.

36
00:04:22,524 --> 00:04:27,986
[SPEAKER_40]: Before we go on, can I just address my original question?

37
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:29,186
[SPEAKER_40]: resolution.

38
00:04:29,406 --> 00:04:29,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

39
00:04:29,847 --> 00:04:30,587
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll go ahead.

40
00:04:31,007 --> 00:04:42,612
[SPEAKER_40]: Pete, there are questions, um, that I know that, um, there were some questions about council rules, about limitations when it comes to, to, uh, meetings minutes and how long we could speak.

41
00:04:43,232 --> 00:04:50,095
[SPEAKER_40]: And if there are follow up questions, and if there's one question, I believe council bears explain the process that we're using.

42
00:04:50,135 --> 00:04:58,119
[SPEAKER_40]: And, uh, as council president, I think he wants to move this meeting along, but I just, there were some senior citizens that mentioned,

43
00:04:58,635 --> 00:05:06,102
[SPEAKER_40]: if there's some confusion, I hope we have a little leeway when it comes to maybe asking the same question twice because of maybe not understanding it.

44
00:05:06,163 --> 00:05:07,604
[SPEAKER_40]: So I hope we would do that.

45
00:05:08,465 --> 00:05:17,914
[SPEAKER_40]: The other question that Councilor Bears did read, did speak about is that we all asked for information to be sent out to the community.

46
00:05:18,655 --> 00:05:20,377
[SPEAKER_40]: The mayor's response, I believe,

47
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:35,614
[SPEAKER_40]: The chief of staff did respond that legally the city couldn't inform or given, I'll just read if I can just so people understand, cause it's a little confusing to people.

48
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:49,984
[SPEAKER_40]: Sending this information request, so it's, we sent this email to legal on today to guide us on what we can do, should avoid doing before we can assist given the OCPF guidelines.

49
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:58,148
[SPEAKER_40]: One specific question in mind is whether we can intentionally direct notification advertisement to subset of residents.

50
00:05:58,988 --> 00:06:05,331
[SPEAKER_40]: So the following is up on my email below, per council, we can't send unsolicited information

51
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:11,404
[SPEAKER_40]: to all voters or a portion of voters of the city, whether by mail or by email.

52
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:16,768
[SPEAKER_40]: We got that, that response was today, correct, Council Beers?

53
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:18,028
[SPEAKER_40]: It was 10 a.m.

54
00:06:18,068 --> 00:06:18,308
[SPEAKER_40]: today.

55
00:06:18,828 --> 00:06:32,132
[SPEAKER_40]: If we knew that and we needed to change wording, I think sending out an all call that we were having a meeting that would, it's open to the public, that just read the resolution, I think that that wouldn't have been an issue.

56
00:06:32,212 --> 00:06:34,513
[SPEAKER_40]: So I just wanted to share that with you.

57
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:34,913
[SPEAKER_40]: So thank you.

58
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:35,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

59
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:37,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And per council, you mean legal council?

60
00:06:37,114 --> 00:06:38,154
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know that I was on that email.

61
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:39,174
[SPEAKER_39]: Oh, you are.

62
00:06:39,614 --> 00:06:40,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Was I on that?

63
00:06:40,374 --> 00:06:40,975
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it was.

64
00:06:44,246 --> 00:06:47,067
[SPEAKER_39]: Council Adam, did you forward this to everybody?

65
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:47,588
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

66
00:06:48,388 --> 00:06:49,148
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think I did.

67
00:06:49,168 --> 00:06:49,989
[SPEAKER_14]: I apologize.

68
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,109
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think I did forward that to everybody.

69
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,850
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought it was, I thought it went to everybody.

70
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,111
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it only went to the, to the three who had amendments.

71
00:06:55,592 --> 00:06:56,992
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think I did for that area.

72
00:06:57,092 --> 00:06:57,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

73
00:06:57,913 --> 00:06:58,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

74
00:06:58,213 --> 00:06:59,373
[SPEAKER_04]: She means legal counsel, right?

75
00:06:59,574 --> 00:06:59,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

76
00:07:00,174 --> 00:07:00,774
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

77
00:07:00,814 --> 00:07:00,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

78
00:07:01,194 --> 00:07:03,876
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't want her to think about this council.

79
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,556
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

80
00:07:05,857 --> 00:07:06,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

81
00:07:06,657 --> 00:07:10,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, with that, I'll go to our city assessor and let me know when you want me to put slides up.

82
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:25,000
[SPEAKER_04]: The new mics are coming on Thursday.

83
00:07:30,024 --> 00:07:31,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Shane's going to come out.

84
00:07:31,365 --> 00:07:31,985
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to fix it.

85
00:07:32,005 --> 00:07:33,146
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear the chair moving.

86
00:07:34,947 --> 00:07:35,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Shane.

87
00:08:06,812 --> 00:08:07,192
[SPEAKER_08]: testing.

88
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:08,213
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.

89
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:08,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, shane.

90
00:08:14,718 --> 00:08:17,240
[SPEAKER_08]: pretty big guy, so sorry about that.

91
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but if we could go to the slides.

92
00:08:21,262 --> 00:08:29,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Just out of a point of information, the Department of Revenue received our valuations for fiscal year 25.

93
00:08:29,648 --> 00:08:38,714
[SPEAKER_08]: They approved it actually this morning, so I'm able to share with you our evaluation changes for fiscal year 25 as a reminder to everyone.

94
00:08:39,514 --> 00:08:43,177
[SPEAKER_08]: On a yearly basis, the Department of Revenue and the state mandates that

95
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:47,960
[SPEAKER_08]: We the assessing office update valuations to full and fair cash value.

96
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Again on that fiscal year basis.

97
00:08:50,982 --> 00:08:55,785
[SPEAKER_08]: We share those valuations in January, but we worked really hard in the office this year to get them done.

98
00:08:55,805 --> 00:09:01,829
[SPEAKER_08]: And as of this morning they were approved so just sharing this information, because it will apply to the override.

99
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:03,809
[SPEAKER_08]: in those override options.

100
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:14,593
[SPEAKER_08]: So residential valuations went up approximately 4% this year and the commercial industrial personal property which is our commercial base went up about 3% in value this year.

101
00:09:15,773 --> 00:09:18,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Our new growth which is when you think of like new single family homes

102
00:09:19,534 --> 00:09:28,401
[SPEAKER_08]: new condo conversions, any exempt property that goes to taxable, that's a $2.5 million in new growth, which adds to our levy.

103
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:41,591
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I just wanted to point out that, you know, absent any override vote, the average tax bill would go up approximately $175 on our median single family this year.

104
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,292
[SPEAKER_08]: That's sort of the effects of Prop 2 1⁄2.

105
00:09:46,537 --> 00:09:58,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Next page, so we obviously have our override votes just as a reminder to people, questions, just as a note, question six, whether it passes or not will not have an effect on fiscal year 25 tax bills.

106
00:09:58,504 --> 00:10:10,431
[SPEAKER_08]: That's because the debt service payment would have to be paid in fiscal year 25, which would not be possible given the time it takes to issue the debt and obviously the six month period before the first debt payment would be due.

107
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:22,323
[SPEAKER_08]: so we're looking at questions seven and eight tonight which would have an effect were they to pass on the fiscal year 25 tax bills and just next slide I don't want to

108
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:29,651
[SPEAKER_08]: people to death, so I just took one example, which is our median single family tax bill.

109
00:10:30,292 --> 00:10:40,616
[SPEAKER_08]: I know the numbers might be a little small, but again, the way we arrive at your tax bill is multiplying your valuation by the tax rate.

110
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:48,761
[SPEAKER_08]: And what, you know, our tax rate is in a lot of ways, determined by how much we can levy on taxpayers.

111
00:10:49,322 --> 00:10:51,323
[SPEAKER_08]: So the levy the last year was about 139.9 million.

112
00:10:54,178 --> 00:10:58,341
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Prop 2.5, which pushed up the levy by 3.5 million.

113
00:10:58,882 --> 00:11:04,226
[SPEAKER_08]: The new growth, which is 2.5, which gives us our fiscal year 25 levy at $146 million.

114
00:11:04,526 --> 00:11:11,472
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the amount of money that the city can collect in real estate, personal property taxation from its residents, taxpayers.

115
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:19,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Our estimated tax rate, given all this, and we do have a split rate between the commercial and the residential, we'll focus on the residential is $8.37.

116
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:27,116
[SPEAKER_08]: On the median single-family home, that would mean a tax bill of $6,519 for the year.

117
00:11:27,696 --> 00:11:30,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, that's a year-on-year difference from last year of $195.

118
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:38,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the next two columns contemplate the passage of question seven and eight, respectively.

119
00:11:39,644 --> 00:11:44,768
[SPEAKER_08]: As you can see, the year on year differences, and then I'll just go move on to the last column.

120
00:11:45,249 --> 00:12:05,905
[SPEAKER_08]: If they were both passed, instead of a median single family home in Medford having $195 a year on year increase, the increase would be $529, giving us a net effect if both questions were passed of approximately $334 to the, again, median single family in Medford.

121
00:12:05,945 --> 00:12:06,266
[SPEAKER_08]: I did a,

122
00:12:06,986 --> 00:12:13,754
[SPEAKER_08]: run the calculations for the median condo, which would be a year-on-year change of $345, and the two families would be $873.

123
00:12:13,814 --> 00:12:15,155
[SPEAKER_08]: That's again the median.

124
00:12:22,003 --> 00:12:39,712
[SPEAKER_08]: What I will pledge to do, and I'm working with the mayor's communications office to get this done on our website, now that as of this morning I have the approval from the Department of Revenue, I will publish all our addresses and values of residential properties on our website.

125
00:12:40,712 --> 00:13:02,099
[SPEAKER_08]: with these contemplated tax rates which could change slightly and I'll get that in the next slide so that every resident in Medford that would like to can go on to our website as they can normally you could go right now and find your 24 value but in advance get their fiscal year 25 value and the contemplated tax bill that would be associated with that value.

126
00:13:02,987 --> 00:13:04,588
[SPEAKER_08]: So just go real quick to the next slide.

127
00:13:04,608 --> 00:13:12,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a caveat that we, those tax rates are dependent on councils tax rate hearing.

128
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:17,896
[SPEAKER_08]: They are dependent on the department of revenue, uh, approving our tax rate recap.

129
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:21,358
[SPEAKER_08]: And there is a rounding issue that comes in because we split the rate.

130
00:13:21,438 --> 00:13:23,219
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can't go all the way past the levy.

131
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:27,121
[SPEAKER_08]: So occasionally the tax rate will be off by a penny that way.

132
00:13:27,602 --> 00:13:29,323
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's to say, um,

133
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:31,044
[SPEAKER_08]: We're done with evaluation.

134
00:13:31,224 --> 00:13:35,547
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to be as transparent as possible as people are starting early voting on this issue.

135
00:13:35,907 --> 00:13:37,809
[SPEAKER_08]: So I believe this weekend.

136
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:48,517
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will commit this week to as long as the mayor's office communications team can help me do it, get all the values and the impact of these overrides on our website.

137
00:13:49,377 --> 00:13:50,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions from the council?

138
00:13:54,517 --> 00:13:59,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure, and just thanks, Ted, I wanna appreciate your hard work getting this done.

139
00:13:59,361 --> 00:14:01,763
[SPEAKER_04]: In October, it usually gets done in January, so it's appreciated.

140
00:14:02,223 --> 00:14:02,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

141
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:16,294
[SPEAKER_40]: So I know that the word transparent gets thrown around, Ted, and I hate for you to get dragged into this, but you weren't part of any financial task force for the override, correct?

142
00:14:16,374 --> 00:14:16,794
[SPEAKER_40]: No, I was not.

143
00:14:16,834 --> 00:14:17,135
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

144
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:22,499
[SPEAKER_40]: Normally, when communities put this into place,

145
00:14:23,908 --> 00:14:38,218
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm told from different communities, different assessors, finance directors, that they usually line this up prior to any budget meetings, so we can help our most vulnerable people in our community understand what any impact it would make.

146
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:48,725
[SPEAKER_40]: So having this calculation that you're doing for us, and thank you so much for doing it, because I know there were so many questions with the calculations that have been public on the side that you had nothing to do with.

147
00:14:48,785 --> 00:14:52,367
[SPEAKER_40]: I know it came out of a state website, but it didn't truly

148
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:56,769
[SPEAKER_40]: calculate the newer assessment.

149
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:58,090
[SPEAKER_40]: So that's correct, right?

150
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:58,730
[SPEAKER_40]: Yep, right.

151
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:13,936
[SPEAKER_40]: So when we look at this and now we're doing it on the 11th hour, the question was normally in your experience, other professionals in your field, this is done usually during budget season.

152
00:15:13,976 --> 00:15:20,959
[SPEAKER_40]: So we can prepare our residents that if there was an increase of 373 median price,

153
00:15:22,694 --> 00:15:23,374
[SPEAKER_40]: They're prepared.

154
00:15:23,394 --> 00:15:31,238
[SPEAKER_40]: I know it sounds minimal to some people because it's only, that's all we keep hearing, it's only, but is it odd that we're doing this so late?

155
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:45,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor, I think you described the typical circumstance where the vote, you know, as we know, we look at the votes online are done in April or May.

156
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:46,286
[SPEAKER_39]: Okay, thank you.

157
00:15:47,106 --> 00:15:47,686
[SPEAKER_39]: Appreciate that.

158
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:50,988
[SPEAKER_39]: Any other questions?

159
00:15:54,303 --> 00:15:54,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins.

160
00:15:55,624 --> 00:15:56,305
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, President Barras.

161
00:15:56,325 --> 00:16:05,751
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you so much for being with us here tonight and for all the legwork that you've been doing to get the FY 25 estimated valuations online months earlier than you otherwise would.

162
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:06,611
[SPEAKER_24]: Really appreciate that.

163
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:15,977
[SPEAKER_24]: And I appreciate that it helps folks get a clearer picture of what precisely their bills might look like in the future based on various

164
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:18,819
[SPEAKER_24]: how the votes go in various directions.

165
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:26,967
[SPEAKER_24]: So just to make sure that I understand the information that's available, and it would be, is it on the Assessor's Department page or the Finance Department page on the city website?

166
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:29,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so I just got the values done today.

167
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:31,051
[SPEAKER_08]: I just prepared the PowerPoint.

168
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:38,818
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm working with the, going to have to work with the Mayoral Communications Office to get it onto our assessing page.

169
00:16:39,658 --> 00:16:41,660
[SPEAKER_08]: We will also have anyone who doesn't

170
00:16:42,481 --> 00:16:45,864
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, they can call the assessing office and we can look it up very quickly for them.

171
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:50,329
[SPEAKER_22]: So they want to call in, or if they want to access our website, either way.

172
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:51,130
[SPEAKER_24]: Great.

173
00:16:51,190 --> 00:17:02,421
[SPEAKER_24]: So up until today, people can call your office or look on the assessor's department website webpage and find the webpage is going to be dependent on like, I'm going to try to get it up this week, but like, it's just however fast we can do it.

174
00:17:02,461 --> 00:17:04,563
[SPEAKER_22]: So probably let's say by Friday.

175
00:17:04,963 --> 00:17:05,203
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure.

176
00:17:05,423 --> 00:17:05,564
[SPEAKER_24]: But

177
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:16,085
[SPEAKER_24]: We have the FY 24 based calculations and now you're expediting getting the FY 25 based valuations so that people can have even more clarity.

178
00:17:16,485 --> 00:17:16,685
[SPEAKER_24]: Great.

179
00:17:16,765 --> 00:17:18,626
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, thank you so much for updating that ahead of schedule.

180
00:17:18,686 --> 00:17:19,306
[SPEAKER_24]: Appreciate it.

181
00:17:20,627 --> 00:17:21,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks Ted.

182
00:17:21,247 --> 00:17:22,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Just two more questions.

183
00:17:22,888 --> 00:17:30,011
[SPEAKER_04]: One, given your estimates, if neither of the overrides pass based on your estimates, the tax rate would once again be going down.

184
00:17:30,492 --> 00:17:30,912
[SPEAKER_08]: That's correct.

185
00:17:31,553 --> 00:17:32,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

186
00:17:32,314 --> 00:17:41,803
[SPEAKER_04]: And before today, when you had the approved fiscal 25 values, would it have been possible for anyone to provide an update using anything other than the fiscal 24 values or an estimate?

187
00:17:43,985 --> 00:17:45,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone from the public, not from your office.

188
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:53,706
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you know, it's possible they might have gotten close, but it's kind of hard to, you know, drill down and get it accurately presented.

189
00:17:53,786 --> 00:17:55,227
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, I would say no.

190
00:17:56,007 --> 00:17:56,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

191
00:17:57,308 --> 00:17:57,589
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

192
00:17:57,729 --> 00:17:59,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further questions from members of council?

193
00:17:59,150 --> 00:17:59,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng.

194
00:18:00,391 --> 00:18:00,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

195
00:18:01,532 --> 00:18:05,975
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand, you know, one of the council's main priorities going in before

196
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:20,909
[SPEAKER_11]: Knowing that this might be an option in the coming years was to maximize this senior circuit breaker for the tax deferrals and to push for the senior work-off program to get more of that done.

197
00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:28,096
[SPEAKER_11]: It's my understanding that folks can find out more about the senior tax deferral from the assessor's office, is that correct?

198
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:39,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, so there's, as you mentioned, our senior work-off program is staffed, I believe over at least 20 senior work-off participants this year across the city.

199
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:46,203
[SPEAKER_08]: The senior deferral applications are available as well as the personal exemptions for low-income seniors.

200
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:48,806
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of two different programs.

201
00:18:49,246 --> 00:18:51,148
[SPEAKER_08]: They have both asset and income limits.

202
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:55,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

203
00:18:55,213 --> 00:18:55,533
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

204
00:18:56,354 --> 00:19:02,678
[SPEAKER_40]: With just a couple more questions, I know that you mentioned that this doesn't have any impact on question six, correct?

205
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:05,320
[SPEAKER_40]: It's not in fiscal year 25.

206
00:19:05,381 --> 00:19:08,243
[SPEAKER_40]: Because it's not enough time to put everything in, correct?

207
00:19:08,683 --> 00:19:10,585
[SPEAKER_40]: We don't know the actual numbers, correct?

208
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:13,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I haven't calculated that.

209
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, interest rates could change drastically.

210
00:19:15,748 --> 00:19:18,591
[SPEAKER_40]: Okay, but we still don't know how much for question six.

211
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:21,453
[SPEAKER_40]: It's an open-ended, as it said in the question, there's nothing there.

212
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:28,637
[SPEAKER_08]: It's I, you know, I can't really tell you what the market's going to do right on the on the bond market.

213
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:29,819
[SPEAKER_40]: All right.

214
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,723
[SPEAKER_40]: And I realize the exemptions are great.

215
00:19:33,424 --> 00:19:39,406
[SPEAKER_40]: but I know that there are options when you do this ahead of time is to really prepare your seniors.

216
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:47,268
[SPEAKER_40]: I know the exemptions sound good, but when you read them and you talk to actual people, there are a lot of senior citizens that really don't fit in that category.

217
00:19:47,748 --> 00:19:50,028
[SPEAKER_40]: So there are no other options.

218
00:19:50,068 --> 00:19:59,491
[SPEAKER_40]: So I know the buzzwords easy to say, we do have exemptions, but when you put it apples to apples and you sit with the senior citizen and you go through their situation, I'm sure you know,

219
00:20:00,171 --> 00:20:03,913
[SPEAKER_40]: Mrs. Jones bought her house with her husband 55 years ago for 50,000.

220
00:20:04,593 --> 00:20:07,495
[SPEAKER_40]: Now the house is appraised at a million dollars.

221
00:20:08,055 --> 00:20:10,657
[SPEAKER_40]: You know, it really doesn't help what we're offering.

222
00:20:11,357 --> 00:20:18,521
[SPEAKER_40]: So it's a funny number and there could be something done more if we had time for an exemption.

223
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:19,201
[SPEAKER_40]: That's all I'm saying.

224
00:20:19,241 --> 00:20:24,264
[SPEAKER_40]: I know that if we had time, this is something we could petition to see if we can really truly

225
00:20:24,804 --> 00:20:26,485
[SPEAKER_40]: support our senior citizens.

226
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:27,605
[SPEAKER_40]: I think that must be said.

227
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:40,311
[SPEAKER_40]: And I think the, the last piece to this, I think that when they look at this and because one question I have Ted is that a lot of people have asked, not just seniors, um, that the, this is like a one time tax.

228
00:20:40,371 --> 00:20:40,811
[SPEAKER_40]: This isn't.

229
00:20:41,411 --> 00:20:48,975
[SPEAKER_40]: So when you see that 4% above your two and a half percent increase, that's going to be compounded year after year after year.

230
00:20:49,255 --> 00:20:51,456
[SPEAKER_40]: This isn't something that's going to go away like debt exclusion, correct?

231
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:57,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct, the levy is set at the new limit and the two and a half is on that new levy.

232
00:20:57,141 --> 00:20:58,821
[SPEAKER_40]: Right, so that'll grow forever.

233
00:20:59,482 --> 00:21:03,903
[SPEAKER_40]: And I think the other piece that people have to understand too, and it's a tough office.

234
00:21:04,524 --> 00:21:14,588
[SPEAKER_40]: So I just, when you hear the misconceptions, I just need your input to educate our residents and understanding that, again, I believe the mayor said her house is only $13.

235
00:21:15,248 --> 00:21:19,930
[SPEAKER_40]: Some others here said their house is $40 a month or whatever, and we can handle that.

236
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:31,568
[SPEAKER_40]: That might be the first year, but again, we were told, I think someone from your office emailed us and said that we'll be reassessing again in 2025 for 2026 using the data for 2023, correct?

237
00:21:36,932 --> 00:21:41,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so the 25 values used calendar year, 23 sales.

238
00:21:41,538 --> 00:21:42,039
[SPEAKER_08]: That's correct.

239
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:46,945
[SPEAKER_08]: So next year we're going to see a 26 using calendar year, 24, uh, sales.

240
00:21:47,286 --> 00:21:49,308
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to say that happens every year.

241
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:50,310
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a every year.

242
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:50,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

243
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,571
[SPEAKER_40]: So that's good.

244
00:21:51,591 --> 00:21:52,112
[SPEAKER_40]: So it happened.

245
00:21:52,132 --> 00:21:53,013
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you for helping with that.

246
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:53,895
[SPEAKER_40]: So it increases.

247
00:21:53,935 --> 00:21:54,015
[SPEAKER_40]: So

248
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:58,643
[SPEAKER_40]: Again, when this tax goes in, it's now assessed again, the homes will be assessed again.

249
00:21:58,683 --> 00:22:03,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so I can't predict what the final 24 numbers are going to be, but it could go up, could go down, depends on the market, right?

250
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:15,361
[SPEAKER_40]: Right, but we're seeing that most assessments, because I could tell you, I'm dealing with my own family members that are looking at a $400 increase per month for his new assessment.

251
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:17,003
[SPEAKER_40]: It's real.

252
00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:22,127
[SPEAKER_40]: So I think that what people also have to understand is that it's not just the home tax.

253
00:22:22,147 --> 00:22:26,290
[SPEAKER_40]: You've seen their cars.

254
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:27,911
[SPEAKER_40]: Motor vehicle excise.

255
00:22:28,491 --> 00:22:30,153
[SPEAKER_40]: Vehicle excise tax is going to go up.

256
00:22:30,713 --> 00:22:34,396
[SPEAKER_40]: You're going to see the CPA tax because your homes are going to be assessed higher now, right?

257
00:22:34,816 --> 00:22:37,818
[SPEAKER_40]: So now the CPA tax will also be taxed higher.

258
00:22:37,838 --> 00:22:39,520
[SPEAKER_40]: You're going to see that a little bit higher, correct?

259
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,561
[SPEAKER_40]: Okay, that's yeah, that's generally correct.

260
00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:46,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Generally, the CPA was included in the calculations presented.

261
00:22:46,421 --> 00:22:47,202
[SPEAKER_40]: Okay, so thank you.

262
00:22:47,222 --> 00:22:53,703
[SPEAKER_40]: So what you're seeing is, it's not just it's not just an override tax.

263
00:22:54,243 --> 00:22:55,183
[SPEAKER_40]: It's an override tax.

264
00:22:55,263 --> 00:22:56,604
[SPEAKER_40]: It's compounded year after year.

265
00:22:57,204 --> 00:22:59,544
[SPEAKER_40]: It's a tax that increases in the CPA as well.

266
00:23:00,084 --> 00:23:02,025
[SPEAKER_40]: It's the excise tax that increases as well.

267
00:23:03,084 --> 00:23:05,346
[SPEAKER_40]: It's so much more than just 13.

268
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:06,847
[SPEAKER_40]: That's my point I'm trying to say.

269
00:23:07,327 --> 00:23:22,318
[SPEAKER_40]: I know it's easy to look at a site that wasn't put forth by our office because we know that although it's correct, the numbers that my colleagues did put out there on a page, it does give the numbers that are true and factual, but

270
00:23:23,342 --> 00:23:32,452
[SPEAKER_40]: That didn't include the assessments that residents had, and I'll use my brother's example, because his house was appraised at, on the calculations, at $800,000.

271
00:23:33,053 --> 00:23:35,215
[SPEAKER_40]: His house is now appraised at $1.2 million.

272
00:23:35,856 --> 00:23:37,578
[SPEAKER_40]: So that's why we're seeing that.

273
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:38,999
[SPEAKER_40]: And that's not odd.

274
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:41,582
[SPEAKER_40]: This is family-owned homes that

275
00:23:42,643 --> 00:23:45,627
[SPEAKER_40]: that we passed on to generation to generation, just like most people in this room.

276
00:23:46,068 --> 00:23:47,109
[SPEAKER_40]: So, but thank you.

277
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:57,743
[SPEAKER_40]: I know I'm monopolizing the time because I think it's important, because these are the questions the people that are sitting in this in this room right now and their friends have contacted me and said, we're very confused, Mr. Scappelli.

278
00:23:58,163 --> 00:24:04,550
[SPEAKER_40]: Because even something simple as, Mr. Scarpelli, why are we fighting for $7.5 million for a new high school?

279
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,473
[SPEAKER_40]: And I'm like, no, no, this has nothing to do with the new high school.

280
00:24:07,493 --> 00:24:08,193
[SPEAKER_40]: That's down the line.

281
00:24:08,774 --> 00:24:14,560
[SPEAKER_40]: And people understanding that, well, this is a fight between schools and kids and senior citizens.

282
00:24:15,481 --> 00:24:16,322
[SPEAKER_40]: That's not true at all.

283
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:21,387
[SPEAKER_40]: We just want to make sure all the information's out so every resident understands the impact.

284
00:24:22,998 --> 00:24:26,200
[SPEAKER_40]: that, and we could talk about solutions as we go, because there are solutions.

285
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,902
[SPEAKER_40]: There were solutions back in April, but thank you.

286
00:24:30,643 --> 00:24:31,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Ted.

287
00:24:31,663 --> 00:24:33,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Really appreciate the hard work of your office.

288
00:24:33,904 --> 00:24:42,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Just want to note, certainly this council, and you've shared some recently, has taken several votes to maximize the exemptions allowed by state law.

289
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:51,155
[SPEAKER_04]: If you see anything more that we could do on that front, I believe in 2022, we voted to tie it to the law so that we wouldn't have to constantly be updating it as the state did.

290
00:24:51,852 --> 00:24:53,754
[SPEAKER_04]: If you see anything, please let us know.

291
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:57,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly our intent is to be maximizing everything, and I believe we have.

292
00:24:57,717 --> 00:25:04,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just the HEROES Act that just was passed allows us to tie the veteran personal exemption to cost of living.

293
00:25:04,242 --> 00:25:08,886
[SPEAKER_08]: So that just passed, so it would be a new action by council.

294
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:09,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

295
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:10,387
[SPEAKER_04]: We will do that.

296
00:25:10,648 --> 00:25:10,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

297
00:25:11,048 --> 00:25:11,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

298
00:25:12,229 --> 00:25:12,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

299
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:14,010
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

300
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,572
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to read off the rules one more time.

301
00:25:15,592 --> 00:25:16,913
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to move to question and answer.

302
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,763
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so we're gonna follow the following rules for this part of the meeting.

303
00:25:27,244 --> 00:25:29,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Members of the public will have one minute to ask one question.

304
00:25:30,186 --> 00:25:34,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Members of the public will not be able to ask a second question until everyone has had a chance to ask their first.

305
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:41,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna verbally request that we not ask duplicative or largely similar questions and may move on to the next question.

306
00:25:42,154 --> 00:25:48,278
[SPEAKER_04]: If a duplicative or similar question is asked, Councilors will have up to two minutes per Councilor to answer each question.

307
00:25:49,653 --> 00:26:00,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm requesting the Councilors not provide duplicative or largely similar answers to answers that have been already provided by other Councilors and may move on to the next Councilor for an answer if that happens.

308
00:26:00,801 --> 00:26:07,305
[SPEAKER_04]: And after members of the public have had the chance to ask their first question, we'll open the floor to a second question or a short public comment.

309
00:26:07,885 --> 00:26:10,988
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to be alternating between the chamber and Zoom.

310
00:26:11,588 --> 00:26:12,909
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will start at the podium.

311
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:18,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Castagnetti, you'll have one minute to ask a question and then we'll go to Zoom after answers from Councilors.

312
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:26,756
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Bears, Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street, East Medford, Massachusetts.

313
00:26:28,037 --> 00:26:30,279
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm very devastated that we lost Larry Lepore.

314
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,400
[SPEAKER_17]: He's a wonderful man.

315
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,061
[SPEAKER_17]: He's a good friend.

316
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:35,784
[SPEAKER_40]: Is the microphone on?

317
00:26:37,645 --> 00:26:39,667
[SPEAKER_40]: Andrew, is the mic, turn the mic down.

318
00:26:40,448 --> 00:26:41,249
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, there you go.

319
00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:42,770
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry we lost Larry Lepore.

320
00:26:44,932 --> 00:26:45,412
[SPEAKER_17]: The minutes.

321
00:26:45,913 --> 00:26:46,453
[SPEAKER_07]: You got your minutes.

322
00:26:47,094 --> 00:26:47,434
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

323
00:26:49,047 --> 00:26:55,350
[SPEAKER_17]: I hope you all had a good Columbus Day yesterday, because he is the greatest world naval explorer in history.

324
00:26:56,111 --> 00:26:58,132
[SPEAKER_17]: He said the world is round, not flat.

325
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:01,813
[SPEAKER_17]: He had more courage than all of us combined.

326
00:27:02,314 --> 00:27:04,375
[SPEAKER_17]: He is also a hero to me and others.

327
00:27:05,175 --> 00:27:08,137
[SPEAKER_17]: Also hope you had a good Indigenous People's Day.

328
00:27:08,957 --> 00:27:10,578
[SPEAKER_17]: I also hope the same for the Jews.

329
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:14,846
[SPEAKER_17]: in the Mideast because they've been there more than 2000 years.

330
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:18,089
[SPEAKER_17]: Now let's talk prop two and a half overwrites.

331
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:23,353
[SPEAKER_17]: As I told you all before method never had a prop two and a half overwrite.

332
00:27:23,573 --> 00:27:28,137
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not Winchester, we are all method here, a working class town city.

333
00:27:28,538 --> 00:27:34,162
[SPEAKER_17]: Our problem is fiscal management and lack of building maintenance period, full stop.

334
00:27:35,123 --> 00:27:44,225
[SPEAKER_17]: My ask is for you honorable city councils to stop this real estate tax assault on we the homeowners and leave the people alone.

335
00:27:44,385 --> 00:27:45,385
[SPEAKER_17]: Stop the bleeding.

336
00:27:45,725 --> 00:27:48,906
[SPEAKER_17]: We're already having trouble with all this Biden inflation.

337
00:27:49,406 --> 00:27:49,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Andy, thank you.

338
00:27:49,986 --> 00:27:50,546
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a minute.

339
00:27:50,846 --> 00:27:52,366
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, does it have one sentence?

340
00:27:52,747 --> 00:27:55,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead and say the sentence minutes up.

341
00:27:57,087 --> 00:27:57,568
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's up.

342
00:27:58,028 --> 00:27:58,768
[SPEAKER_17]: You can say the sentence.

343
00:27:58,828 --> 00:27:59,748
[SPEAKER_17]: Andy is a minute up.

344
00:27:59,788 --> 00:28:00,128
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, sir.

345
00:28:00,148 --> 00:28:00,588
[SPEAKER_17]: It is up.

346
00:28:00,628 --> 00:28:00,808
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

347
00:28:00,908 --> 00:28:01,128
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

348
00:28:01,568 --> 00:28:04,669
[SPEAKER_17]: My motto was this no, no further taxation.

349
00:28:05,694 --> 00:28:06,735
[SPEAKER_17]: He's allowing me to speak.

350
00:28:06,755 --> 00:28:07,715
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you want to interrupt me?

351
00:28:07,755 --> 00:28:10,958
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you want to interrupt me?

352
00:28:10,998 --> 00:28:12,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just hold on here, guys.

353
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I can't believe we're doing this on the first question.

354
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,140
[SPEAKER_17]: This is crazy.

355
00:28:16,181 --> 00:28:16,621
[SPEAKER_17]: Stop it.

356
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:21,365
[SPEAKER_17]: My motto was this, no more further taxation without proper representation.

357
00:28:21,385 --> 00:28:21,865
[SPEAKER_17]: The end.

358
00:28:22,485 --> 00:28:25,427
[SPEAKER_17]: Andrew said that dark call.

359
00:28:25,948 --> 00:28:26,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Andy.

360
00:28:26,728 --> 00:28:27,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anyone have a response?

361
00:28:27,969 --> 00:28:28,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Your time.

362
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone want to answer the question?

363
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:33,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lemke, you have two minutes.

364
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,538
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to try to respond to one thing there.

365
00:28:36,578 --> 00:28:43,980
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't hear a specific question, but you did say that Medford's not like our surrounding towns.

366
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:44,781
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I said Winchester.

367
00:28:45,081 --> 00:28:46,501
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we're not like Winchester.

368
00:28:46,521 --> 00:28:52,143
[SPEAKER_13]: 90% of cities in the state of Massachusetts have had an override.

369
00:28:52,203 --> 00:29:00,965
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford has one of the lowest operating budgets per capita of any city.

370
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:03,866
[SPEAKER_13]: midsize city in the state of Massachusetts.

371
00:29:04,446 --> 00:29:11,729
[SPEAKER_13]: And that is in large part because we are one of the 10% of cities that has never had an override.

372
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:12,369
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're right.

373
00:29:12,409 --> 00:29:18,271
[SPEAKER_13]: We are not like our neighbors that have had overrides and we have less money for it.

374
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:20,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

375
00:29:20,752 --> 00:29:24,474
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll move on to the next question, unless anyone else has an answer.

376
00:29:25,387 --> 00:29:26,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Andy.

377
00:29:26,187 --> 00:29:28,288
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to Michelle B on Zoom.

378
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:30,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

379
00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:32,130
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll have one minute to ask your question.

380
00:29:34,451 --> 00:29:35,692
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, my name is Michelle Barkson.

381
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,753
[SPEAKER_19]: I live at 23 Diane Road in Medford.

382
00:29:39,134 --> 00:29:43,836
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you everyone for your work with this important progress.

383
00:29:44,656 --> 00:29:54,141
[SPEAKER_19]: My question is, can you please speak to the ramifications of what will happen if questions seven and eight do not pass specifically to the school budget and how that will affect our students

384
00:29:54,801 --> 00:29:55,682
[SPEAKER_19]: learning environment.

385
00:29:55,722 --> 00:30:03,547
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to remind everyone listening that teacher working conditions are student learning conditions, and those two things cannot be separated.

386
00:30:04,488 --> 00:30:08,731
[SPEAKER_19]: As a public school teacher in another town, I can speak to that being very true.

387
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:15,776
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would love to hear, or I would not love to hear, but I want to hear what might happen if these don't pass so we can highlight the importance of them passing.

388
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:16,176
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

389
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:17,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

390
00:30:17,777 --> 00:30:20,939
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go to Vice President Collins, then

391
00:30:23,786 --> 00:30:24,508
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, President Bears.

392
00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:26,013
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for the question.

393
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:34,060
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to add a disclaimer that I obviously sitting behind this rail on this date, I'm not a school committee member.

394
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:40,401
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't have that level of granular knowledge of the school department and the school department makes its own budget.

395
00:30:40,641 --> 00:30:41,602
[SPEAKER_24]: The city council does not.

396
00:30:42,102 --> 00:30:50,783
[SPEAKER_24]: That being said, I have discussed this matter extensively with people in the community, with people involved in the schools, with school committee members.

397
00:30:52,524 --> 00:30:53,404
[SPEAKER_24]: I understand that

398
00:30:54,224 --> 00:31:06,198
[SPEAKER_24]: you know, what we stand to lose if these questions do not pass includes, you know, some of the stuff that people involved in the schools may remember from when we had to cut the school's budget during the pandemic.

399
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:14,187
[SPEAKER_24]: And that includes eliminating positions, including teachers, nurses, behavioral specialists, literary coaches.

400
00:31:15,568 --> 00:31:23,593
[SPEAKER_24]: We lose the opportunity to add programming within the schools that supplement the curriculum that is state mandated.

401
00:31:23,713 --> 00:31:32,077
[SPEAKER_24]: So, some programming that is really beloved by students and their families, such as arts and musical curricula.

402
00:31:32,297 --> 00:31:36,980
[SPEAKER_24]: We lose the opportunity to augment the student experience with those types of classes.

403
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:44,384
[SPEAKER_24]: We lose the opportunity to augment the student experience with more people in supportive roles.

404
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:59,115
[SPEAKER_24]: such as therapists, nurses, people outside of the classroom who are nevertheless there to make sure that students can thrive in our schools and achieve the best learning that they can?

405
00:31:59,275 --> 00:31:59,635
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

406
00:32:01,256 --> 00:32:10,223
[SPEAKER_24]: These two questions combined also limit our ability to offer competitive and living wages to the many, many people who work in our schools and offer

407
00:32:11,823 --> 00:32:14,004
[SPEAKER_24]: students the experience that they really deserve.

408
00:32:15,005 --> 00:32:20,346
[SPEAKER_24]: We know that we need to be offering living wages to our teachers and paras and all school staff because it's the right thing to do.

409
00:32:20,446 --> 00:32:27,269
[SPEAKER_24]: We also know that we need to be able to do that in order to keep these people in our school system so that our students are served in the way that they deserve.

410
00:32:29,118 --> 00:32:31,140
[SPEAKER_24]: This will also have impacts on building maintenance.

411
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,061
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

412
00:32:32,182 --> 00:32:33,543
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, Councilor Tseng.

413
00:32:33,924 --> 00:32:34,284
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

414
00:32:35,285 --> 00:32:41,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Collins, I think, touched on a list of positions that, subject to the school committee talks, might be at stake.

415
00:32:41,532 --> 00:32:46,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Literacy specialists, school nurses, guidance, mental health specialists, increased class sizes.

416
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:49,241
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's not fear-mongering when a lot of this stuff has already happened.

417
00:32:49,261 --> 00:32:50,282
[SPEAKER_11]: happening in our school districts.

418
00:32:50,322 --> 00:32:51,963
[SPEAKER_11]: We've already had to make a lot of these cuts.

419
00:32:52,343 --> 00:32:56,505
[SPEAKER_11]: We've already found it hard to retain our long-term teachers.

420
00:32:57,166 --> 00:32:59,747
[SPEAKER_11]: We also need to take a step back and look at this big picture-wise.

421
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:09,753
[SPEAKER_11]: We know when we invest in our schools, your investment and your value of your property goes up as well, that your public safety around you, crime goes down and public safety goes up.

422
00:33:10,673 --> 00:33:15,876
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we, I think there are longer, bigger picture benefits to everyone, even if you don't have kids in the schools.

423
00:33:16,737 --> 00:33:20,178
[SPEAKER_11]: Touching on the roads real quick, because that's also a part of question seven.

424
00:33:21,579 --> 00:33:24,241
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we need to look at the opportunity we lose.

425
00:33:24,721 --> 00:33:29,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, the basic role of government, of local government is to fix your potholes and to send your kids to school.

426
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:34,046
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we're not, if we can't do either of those, then we're not, you know,

427
00:33:34,406 --> 00:33:38,547
[SPEAKER_11]: we're not doing our jobs, but we were asking the voters to give us the tools to do our jobs.

428
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:47,730
[SPEAKER_11]: And something about question seven with the roads and sidewalks is that it would give us a crew that would work full time on fixing our potholes and sidewalks in the city.

429
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:51,051
[SPEAKER_11]: That's something that we don't have right now because our resources are too constrained.

430
00:33:51,471 --> 00:34:00,354
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's something that I believe if passed, will show, will give our residents a real benefit, a real benefit that you can see and live in our city.

431
00:34:01,616 --> 00:34:05,177
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the question.

432
00:34:05,197 --> 00:34:16,822
[SPEAKER_40]: Let me start off by first saying that unfortunately this administration has divided this community for the children in the schools and the seniors or the homeowners or renters.

433
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:23,665
[SPEAKER_40]: And I say shame on this administration, shame on this council, shame on the financial task force, because the bottom line is this.

434
00:34:25,069 --> 00:34:30,631
[SPEAKER_40]: This group knew that we were heading in some tough waters back in June 20th of 2023.

435
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:40,776
[SPEAKER_40]: And you could see that in a city council budget meeting when council beers met with the mayor behind closed doors to set up some sort of deal.

436
00:34:41,616 --> 00:34:52,281
[SPEAKER_40]: We didn't know what that deal was, but they created a financial task force and that financial task force put together a plan of an override without anybody's knowledge, anybody's input or any,

437
00:34:54,026 --> 00:34:55,767
[SPEAKER_40]: or any community participation.

438
00:34:57,747 --> 00:35:01,949
[SPEAKER_40]: There are no issues with our school department.

439
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:06,590
[SPEAKER_40]: This is a fair tactic and fair tactic only for the fact that we should remember this.

440
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:17,754
[SPEAKER_40]: Back in April, back in May, back in June, when the city had $25 million in free cash, it was my responsibility to bring forth that we take that $5 million

441
00:35:19,324 --> 00:35:30,052
[SPEAKER_40]: levy that budget, make sure there were no cuts, understand the process, and then move forward to see if we truly need an override, which I never said that should never be an option.

442
00:35:30,832 --> 00:35:37,117
[SPEAKER_40]: But to hear parents and teachers and friends and family say, George, explain this to me.

443
00:35:38,257 --> 00:35:46,945
[SPEAKER_40]: Councilor Villes knew that this was gonna be a devastating situation, but it could have been solved and still could be solved with free cash.

444
00:35:47,565 --> 00:35:52,810
[SPEAKER_40]: We have plenty of free cash in the system not to turn the city upside down or divide the city.

445
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,431
[SPEAKER_40]: Now, remember, I'll leave you with this.

446
00:35:56,513 --> 00:35:58,414
[SPEAKER_40]: What we're asking for in the budget

447
00:35:59,338 --> 00:36:04,122
[SPEAKER_40]: in this override doesn't mean you'll get exactly what you think you're gonna get.

448
00:36:05,002 --> 00:36:09,126
[SPEAKER_40]: Because all these cuts were made to set up this override as a fair tactic.

449
00:36:09,146 --> 00:36:09,666
[SPEAKER_40]: So please.

450
00:36:09,866 --> 00:36:10,787
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

451
00:36:10,887 --> 00:36:13,369
[SPEAKER_40]: Councilor Scarpelli is not against the children.

452
00:36:13,649 --> 00:36:17,112
[SPEAKER_40]: We just hope that people understand that this could be soft.

453
00:36:17,192 --> 00:36:17,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Council President.

454
00:36:17,952 --> 00:36:18,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

455
00:36:18,793 --> 00:36:20,414
[SPEAKER_40]: Appreciate it.

456
00:36:22,996 --> 00:36:24,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Just gonna say a few things really quick.

457
00:36:29,281 --> 00:36:32,246
[SPEAKER_04]: The council, oh, I'll go to, okay, I'll wait.

458
00:36:32,867 --> 00:36:33,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Leming.

459
00:36:34,751 --> 00:36:35,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Two minutes.

460
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:41,863
[SPEAKER_29]: One thing that I wanna mention about to answer the Zoom question,

461
00:36:42,814 --> 00:36:44,716
[SPEAKER_29]: of residents question, Michelle.

462
00:36:46,659 --> 00:36:59,554
[SPEAKER_29]: One thing that we would lose if this question, question seven in particular, does not pass, it's a very specific, I believe it's question seven, it's a very specific thing about the high school schedule, which right now does not allow

463
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:12,083
[SPEAKER_29]: some of the students who are taking specific classes, I believe it's in the vocational school, to take certain art classes, theater classes, visual arts.

464
00:37:12,303 --> 00:37:18,087
[SPEAKER_29]: It limits our students in being the fully well-rounded students that we want them to be able to be.

465
00:37:19,068 --> 00:37:21,630
[SPEAKER_29]: When you're in high school, you want to be able to explore

466
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,632
[SPEAKER_29]: figure out who you are, what you're interested in.

467
00:37:24,812 --> 00:37:29,676
[SPEAKER_29]: And we want to give all of our students the best opportunity to be everything that they can be.

468
00:37:29,756 --> 00:37:37,581
[SPEAKER_29]: And we don't want to limit them because we haven't had the opportunity to expand the schedule to really experiment with what that can be.

469
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:44,487
[SPEAKER_29]: I will also say that in 2019, I worked for the school district and I knew then that we were underfunded.

470
00:37:45,027 --> 00:37:48,469
[SPEAKER_29]: And I started thinking about running for city council to make something like this happen.

471
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,011
[SPEAKER_29]: This has been happening for a long time.

472
00:37:50,071 --> 00:37:51,492
[SPEAKER_29]: We have had underfunded

473
00:37:51,992 --> 00:37:53,013
[SPEAKER_29]: schools for a long time.

474
00:37:53,073 --> 00:37:54,674
[SPEAKER_29]: And this has been in the works for a long time.

475
00:37:54,694 --> 00:37:56,795
[SPEAKER_29]: This has needed to happen for quite a long time.

476
00:37:57,435 --> 00:37:57,795
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

477
00:37:59,596 --> 00:38:00,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Leming, two minutes.

478
00:38:02,138 --> 00:38:15,445
[SPEAKER_13]: Saying that we can address the budgetary problems of the Medford public school system with free cash is like me saying the government gave me a $1,200 check from COVID.

479
00:38:15,965 --> 00:38:20,468
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't have to look for a job right now because that check is going to last me another

480
00:38:21,493 --> 00:38:22,433
[SPEAKER_13]: another two weeks.

481
00:38:23,313 --> 00:38:24,093
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the same thing.

482
00:38:24,153 --> 00:38:28,534
[SPEAKER_13]: The government gave us, the government gave the city of Medford some money.

483
00:38:28,554 --> 00:38:34,595
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a one-time thing from COVID and the proposal that we can plug ongoing costs from free cash.

484
00:38:35,175 --> 00:38:41,716
[SPEAKER_13]: All that would do is drain our reserves and we'd be back at square one in five years.

485
00:38:43,137 --> 00:38:50,438
[SPEAKER_13]: If these overrides don't pass straight up, there will be layoffs in the school system and the roads will continue to be in disrepair.

486
00:38:50,538 --> 00:38:50,858
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

487
00:38:52,756 --> 00:38:54,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, nope, one time, sorry.

488
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:57,940
[SPEAKER_04]: It's question eight, yeah.

489
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,081
[SPEAKER_04]: And any other councilors wanna go?

490
00:39:01,322 --> 00:39:03,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be quick, give myself two minutes.

491
00:39:05,203 --> 00:39:06,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to list it out.

492
00:39:07,647 --> 00:39:12,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Two literacy interventionists, two behavior specialists, one nurse, four teachers, and four department heads.

493
00:39:12,873 --> 00:39:16,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were cuts that were postponed because we used one-time funds this year to plug the hole.

494
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:22,886
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another 25 positions, two school Councilors, four classroom teachers, two security monitors,

495
00:39:23,587 --> 00:39:31,891
[SPEAKER_04]: One attendance and re-engagement officer, five paraprofessionals, and 12.2 additional staff members that are on one-time federal funds this year.

496
00:39:32,612 --> 00:39:35,353
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's about 35 to 45 staff in the schools.

497
00:39:35,933 --> 00:39:36,874
[SPEAKER_04]: We would not have a

498
00:39:39,363 --> 00:39:42,725
[SPEAKER_04]: permanent dedicated street and sidewalk crew to use the machines that we already own.

499
00:39:42,765 --> 00:39:46,808
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have enough staff in the DPW to actually run those machines four times a week.

500
00:39:47,849 --> 00:40:09,003
[SPEAKER_04]: And there would not be significant room for looking at additional compensation for educators, paraprofessionals, and staff in our schools, whether that's just to raise their pay, because it's a contract year, or whether that is when we're talking about extending potentially 10 to 15 minutes to school day to align vocational with the comprehensive high school schedule.

501
00:40:09,643 --> 00:40:11,804
[SPEAKER_04]: or just to address any issues on time on learning.

502
00:40:12,084 --> 00:40:12,965
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks.

503
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:14,746
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we would lose.

504
00:40:15,906 --> 00:40:17,267
[SPEAKER_04]: We will go to the podium.

505
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

506
00:40:19,148 --> 00:40:21,089
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have one minute to ask one question.

507
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,851
[SPEAKER_45]: John McGonigal, 20 Ross Street, Medford.

508
00:40:27,972 --> 00:40:32,334
[SPEAKER_45]: Question is the residential

509
00:40:33,624 --> 00:40:37,326
[SPEAKER_45]: Override not override the assessments on each house that are going around now.

510
00:40:37,927 --> 00:41:02,021
[SPEAKER_45]: They're roughly around $60,000 for each house for the last three years So if you take the $60,000 and you multiply it by your nine dollars a thousand You're coming up to five hundred forty dollars a house every single year so Multiply that by your twenty six thousand seven hundred houses that are in Medford which is

511
00:41:03,148 --> 00:41:04,970
[SPEAKER_45]: $13,857,000.

512
00:41:03,168 --> 00:41:04,970
[SPEAKER_45]: My question is, where does that go?

513
00:41:11,129 --> 00:41:13,491
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's not actually how the tax rates calculated.

514
00:41:14,451 --> 00:41:16,212
[SPEAKER_04]: The assessor just presented the information.

515
00:41:16,232 --> 00:41:21,015
[SPEAKER_04]: The levy changes based on the two and a half and new growth.

516
00:41:21,095 --> 00:41:24,278
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's only about 6 million this year, not 13 million.

517
00:41:24,298 --> 00:41:29,321
[SPEAKER_04]: And generally that amount is only going towards fixed costs.

518
00:41:29,341 --> 00:41:37,086
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have union contracts, increasing health insurance costs, increasing retirement pension costs, increased costs of materials and pavement.

519
00:41:37,826 --> 00:41:41,388
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's generally what the normal two and a half new growth increase goes towards.

520
00:41:41,688 --> 00:41:51,034
[SPEAKER_45]: And with that assessment, one thing you didn't put in as a cost increase to the citizens of Medford is your homeowner's insurance, your homeowner's insurance.

521
00:41:51,434 --> 00:42:03,461
[SPEAKER_45]: If your residential area goes up 160,000 over three years, that's going to be probably another three, $400 a year that I don't think anyone's talked about yet.

522
00:42:05,102 --> 00:42:05,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

523
00:42:05,522 --> 00:42:06,583
[SPEAKER_45]: So that was my question.

524
00:42:07,093 --> 00:42:07,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

525
00:42:07,994 --> 00:42:09,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anyone else want to answer that question?

526
00:42:10,155 --> 00:42:11,316
[SPEAKER_40]: I think if I can.

527
00:42:12,817 --> 00:42:24,244
[SPEAKER_40]: I think I heard some similar situations with, I know what the assessor came up and gave us medium price homes, but we're seeing real people have told me that this is what we're seeing.

528
00:42:24,284 --> 00:42:31,349
[SPEAKER_40]: We're seeing the increase close to $60,000, most homes that you're seeing an increase at a higher percentage rate.

529
00:42:31,409 --> 00:42:34,151
[SPEAKER_40]: And again, on top of all of what we talked about,

530
00:42:34,591 --> 00:42:37,553
[SPEAKER_40]: with this, so it's not the $13 a month, the $40 a month.

531
00:42:37,993 --> 00:42:48,219
[SPEAKER_40]: It's the pieces that this gentleman just said is the understanding that I never thought that our home insurance now will now increase.

532
00:42:48,259 --> 00:42:52,701
[SPEAKER_40]: So again, this isn't them against us.

533
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:58,865
[SPEAKER_40]: This is understanding that we have viable options right now to fix this.

534
00:42:59,645 --> 00:43:10,090
[SPEAKER_40]: with free cash and then work together to see how we can have an open process to really include all the stakeholders to make sure that, uh, that no one is hurt.

535
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:10,610
[SPEAKER_40]: So thank you.

536
00:43:12,491 --> 00:43:15,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions from answers from members of the council?

537
00:43:17,633 --> 00:43:19,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, we'll go to the next question on zoom.

538
00:43:19,914 --> 00:43:21,815
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to Lizzie Charbonneau.

539
00:43:21,955 --> 00:43:24,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Lizzie, you have one minute to ask one question.

540
00:43:24,896 --> 00:43:26,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Please provide your name and address for the record.

541
00:43:27,677 --> 00:43:28,998
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, my name is Lizzy Sharpener.

542
00:43:29,018 --> 00:43:30,479
[SPEAKER_12]: I live at 18 Stickney Road.

543
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,102
[SPEAKER_12]: So my question is, why do we need to do the override now?

544
00:43:35,443 --> 00:43:49,072
[SPEAKER_12]: And in particular, I'm curious to hear you speak to the rising inflation the last few years that has exceeded the rate that the levee limit has been able to increase as well as which costs increase even faster than inflation.

545
00:43:49,132 --> 00:43:53,876
[SPEAKER_12]: My understanding is that insurance and pensions and other fixed costs that the city has to

546
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:58,606
[SPEAKER_12]: that we pay for are rising faster than inflation and faster than those levy increases.

547
00:43:59,507 --> 00:44:13,071
[SPEAKER_12]: I would also like to hear you speak to the increased costs in schools that are exceeding inflation rates and our inability as a city to provide some basic infrastructure like maintenance of roads due to our low budget.

548
00:44:13,131 --> 00:44:20,693
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you could speak to why we need this override now, especially in relation to those items, I would like to hear that.

549
00:44:25,643 --> 00:44:26,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to Councilor Callahan.

550
00:44:28,185 --> 00:44:28,486
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

551
00:44:29,727 --> 00:44:33,651
[SPEAKER_26]: So, I think this is a basic question why do we need these overrides.

552
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:41,798
[SPEAKER_26]: And as Councilor Leming stated, we, we actually I will say we rank 320th out of 351 Massachusetts cities and towns.

553
00:44:45,001 --> 00:44:47,103
[SPEAKER_26]: in the amount of budget we have per person.

554
00:44:47,623 --> 00:44:54,689
[SPEAKER_26]: So we have less budget per person than every other city in Massachusetts and we have less budget per person than 90% of towns.

555
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:59,434
[SPEAKER_26]: All of the others that spend less per person than we do are much smaller than we are.

556
00:45:00,154 --> 00:45:03,556
[SPEAKER_26]: Our budget is too small to provide the services that we need.

557
00:45:04,477 --> 00:45:10,241
[SPEAKER_26]: I want to go ahead, I don't know, this is probably gonna be too small for people to see, but this is a chart of our budget.

558
00:45:10,661 --> 00:45:14,663
[SPEAKER_26]: And this large blue area here is the schools.

559
00:45:15,664 --> 00:45:19,406
[SPEAKER_26]: That is what we are looking for more money for, so we cannot cut that.

560
00:45:19,987 --> 00:45:22,989
[SPEAKER_26]: The next one is insurance.

561
00:45:23,369 --> 00:45:26,271
[SPEAKER_26]: Insurance is something that we are required to have by law.

562
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:27,692
[SPEAKER_26]: We cannot cut that.

563
00:45:28,132 --> 00:45:30,055
[SPEAKER_26]: The next one is pensions.

564
00:45:30,155 --> 00:45:31,356
[SPEAKER_26]: Those are contractual.

565
00:45:31,737 --> 00:45:33,139
[SPEAKER_26]: We cannot cut pensions.

566
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:37,204
[SPEAKER_26]: The next two are our fire department and our police department.

567
00:45:37,845 --> 00:45:45,495
[SPEAKER_26]: My feeling is that no one on either side of the Prop 2.5 debate wants to drastically cut our police and fire departments.

568
00:45:46,016 --> 00:45:48,720
[SPEAKER_26]: The next one after police and fire is our roads.

569
00:45:49,461 --> 00:46:01,557
[SPEAKER_26]: And I appreciate your question about the roads, because underfunding of our roads has caused us to have $67 million in essentially road debt it's called the road backlog 30 seconds.

570
00:46:01,857 --> 00:46:02,197
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

571
00:46:03,338 --> 00:46:13,741
[SPEAKER_26]: After that, our bonds, which we are also required to pay, and then we get down to smaller things, the library facilities, many other small departments.

572
00:46:14,121 --> 00:46:22,224
[SPEAKER_26]: None of these, if we even cut the entire department, could possibly fix the $3 million to $5 million that we need for the school budget.

573
00:46:22,624 --> 00:46:24,165
[SPEAKER_26]: Our budget is simply too small.

574
00:46:24,225 --> 00:46:26,965
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll let someone else talk about which of these increases more than inflation.

575
00:46:26,985 --> 00:46:27,306
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

576
00:46:27,766 --> 00:46:28,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

577
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to Councilor Leming, two minutes.

578
00:46:32,681 --> 00:46:51,227
[SPEAKER_13]: So adding on to what Councilor Callahan said, partially this is due to the lingering costs of COVID, which resulted in both decreased funding going to the school system, partially that was just because you have fewer students going into public schools, and partially because

579
00:46:52,608 --> 00:46:55,713
[SPEAKER_13]: there was a lot of activity in the healthcare system from COVID.

580
00:46:55,793 --> 00:47:01,163
[SPEAKER_13]: So there is a sort of a, so the cost of health insurance, which we have to pay ended up rising.

581
00:47:01,504 --> 00:47:04,669
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are some of the more short term reasons why we need this now.

582
00:47:04,809 --> 00:47:05,551
[SPEAKER_13]: Longer term,

583
00:47:06,321 --> 00:47:15,469
[SPEAKER_13]: The way that Prop 2 NAP is designed is the total amount of money that the city can take in basically can't go up by more than 2.5% every year.

584
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:22,376
[SPEAKER_13]: While inflation has averaged for the past 44 years at 3.1% over time, that compounds.

585
00:47:22,436 --> 00:47:23,517
[SPEAKER_13]: So the budget today

586
00:47:24,137 --> 00:47:32,143
[SPEAKER_13]: is only a fraction, well, it's only about 78% as valuable today as it was back in 1980.

587
00:47:32,464 --> 00:47:38,288
[SPEAKER_13]: So Prop 2.5 has this effect long-term on municipal budget where it squeezes resources.

588
00:47:38,929 --> 00:47:47,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Most cities in Massachusetts have addressed this with the intended mechanism for overcoming this, which is periodic elections.

589
00:47:47,675 --> 00:47:49,397
[SPEAKER_13]: This is just the first time we're doing that.

590
00:47:49,677 --> 00:47:50,858
[SPEAKER_13]: That's part of the reason.

591
00:47:51,318 --> 00:48:07,514
[SPEAKER_13]: the fact that we're so late to the game there is part of the reason that again we are 320 out of 351 cities in terms of our per capita budget and that is the reason why our schools could definitely be doing

592
00:48:07,594 --> 00:48:07,854
[SPEAKER_13]: better.

593
00:48:08,174 --> 00:48:10,135
[SPEAKER_13]: That is the reason why you see so many potholes.

594
00:48:10,435 --> 00:48:14,497
[SPEAKER_13]: This is one step in addressing that situation.

595
00:48:14,918 --> 00:48:21,941
[SPEAKER_13]: Once again, free cash, one time funding is not an actual longer term solution.

596
00:48:22,141 --> 00:48:33,286
[SPEAKER_13]: If we just went with free cash, that would be drained in a couple of years, even shorter than the four to five year span I put, I said earlier, and then that's time.

597
00:48:33,346 --> 00:48:34,207
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me thank you.

598
00:48:35,202 --> 00:48:35,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

599
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:37,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to Councilor Scarpelli of two minutes.

600
00:48:37,625 --> 00:48:37,925
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

601
00:48:38,345 --> 00:48:52,901
[SPEAKER_40]: So, I think my council is not understanding the free cash should be used now to fix a problem now, which we have, and I appreciate the clarification it's only $3 million accounts accounting and just said to fix the school budget, but the key issue isn't.

602
00:48:53,644 --> 00:48:56,685
[SPEAKER_40]: isn't the process of getting this fixed now.

603
00:48:56,745 --> 00:49:11,228
[SPEAKER_40]: The problem that we've had, and we could use the pandemic and use the pandemic over and over again, but what neighboring communities are doing during the pandemic with the infrastructure money that was given through ARPA, that wasn't intended for, for the roads and sidewalks that you're asking for right now.

604
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:12,588
[SPEAKER_40]: Our mayor didn't do that.

605
00:49:12,848 --> 00:49:16,609
[SPEAKER_40]: Our mayor had to balance our budget through ESSER and ARPA funding.

606
00:49:17,449 --> 00:49:18,609
[SPEAKER_40]: That's the easy way out.

607
00:49:18,649 --> 00:49:20,830
[SPEAKER_40]: That's like paying your mortgage with a credit card.

608
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:22,311
[SPEAKER_40]: And I'll tell you why.

609
00:49:22,371 --> 00:49:23,051
[SPEAKER_40]: This is the difference.

610
00:49:23,091 --> 00:49:29,473
[SPEAKER_40]: Everybody hasn't said it, but the difference between why we're here and we're in trouble is because of new growth.

611
00:49:30,053 --> 00:49:31,294
[SPEAKER_40]: New growth is what pushes

612
00:49:33,254 --> 00:49:35,096
[SPEAKER_40]: our value, our income up.

613
00:49:35,516 --> 00:49:37,097
[SPEAKER_40]: It gives us more tax base.

614
00:49:37,397 --> 00:49:39,819
[SPEAKER_40]: It brings more money so we can do all the things we're talking about.

615
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:41,660
[SPEAKER_40]: This mayor has done nothing.

616
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,902
[SPEAKER_40]: We haven't had shovel in the ground in five and a half years.

617
00:49:45,343 --> 00:49:55,349
[SPEAKER_40]: We're talking about, I know my council friends have gone out and told people that Massachusetts is the number one, Medford is the number one community new growth in permitting.

618
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:56,931
[SPEAKER_40]: Wrong, I sat with the commissioner.

619
00:49:57,611 --> 00:50:05,115
[SPEAKER_40]: Permitting their fine, the biggest concerns we're having, look at the process that she lost fighting 40B projects.

620
00:50:05,715 --> 00:50:10,838
[SPEAKER_40]: One project alone was $3 to $5 million in permits.

621
00:50:10,878 --> 00:50:14,980
[SPEAKER_40]: And then an additional $7 to $9 million that would have come in as new growth.

622
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:20,743
[SPEAKER_40]: And one job that she fought in court, lost and appealed it, and this group had to leave.

623
00:50:21,224 --> 00:50:24,706
[SPEAKER_40]: The problem isn't our tax base, because our assessments are up.

624
00:50:25,786 --> 00:50:30,867
[SPEAKER_40]: And we're paying more than anybody else in neighboring communities because our assessments are so high.

625
00:50:31,047 --> 00:50:33,468
[SPEAKER_40]: I will share my last point.

626
00:50:34,348 --> 00:50:41,310
[SPEAKER_40]: Neighbor communities per child, Malden, Arlington, Winchester, between 15 and 17,000.

627
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:45,411
[SPEAKER_40]: Medford, we pay $22,000 per student.

628
00:50:45,771 --> 00:50:49,132
[SPEAKER_40]: Is it a management issue or is it really we don't have enough money?

629
00:50:49,172 --> 00:50:51,953
[SPEAKER_40]: Think about it because it's public. $22,000.

630
00:50:55,202 --> 00:50:56,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to Councilor Tseng.

631
00:50:58,063 --> 00:51:00,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Tseng, and then Councilor Collins.

632
00:51:01,704 --> 00:51:01,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

633
00:51:02,004 --> 00:51:02,744
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Tseng, two minutes.

634
00:51:02,924 --> 00:51:03,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

635
00:51:03,944 --> 00:51:09,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Touching very quickly on the topic of new growth, I think our council is very aware that new growth is the priority for Medford.

636
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:19,229
[SPEAKER_11]: And so when we look at the last three years of new growth, so the last two years plus the estimates that we have right in front of us presented by the assessor,

637
00:51:20,629 --> 00:51:30,151
[SPEAKER_11]: It actually shows that our first round of zoning reform, which was the first round in almost 50 years of zoning reform, actually has led to the most new growth our city has seen in decades.

638
00:51:30,612 --> 00:51:42,634
[SPEAKER_11]: We are currently working on round two of zoning reform and we are very, very optimistic that that new growth will help us achieve more financial stability going into the future as long as these questions pass.

639
00:51:43,755 --> 00:51:44,015
[SPEAKER_11]: I think

640
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,637
[SPEAKER_11]: I also have this chart right here.

641
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:51,140
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll do what Councilor Callahan does.

642
00:51:51,301 --> 00:52:00,769
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not really easy to see, but you can see that the new growth is growing throughout the last few years with the reforms that we've instituted.

643
00:52:01,429 --> 00:52:04,512
[SPEAKER_11]: We are permitting more units as Councilor- Could you put that chart back up?

644
00:52:04,732 --> 00:52:05,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, thank you.

645
00:52:05,112 --> 00:52:05,973
[SPEAKER_04]: The train's gonna zoom in on it.

646
00:52:07,214 --> 00:52:08,595
[SPEAKER_11]: We're also permitting more new,

647
00:52:10,194 --> 00:52:14,702
[SPEAKER_11]: new units than ever before, as Councilor Scarpaoli states.

648
00:52:15,748 --> 00:52:23,410
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing, because on the topic of new growth, we're getting a little bit away from the why now question.

649
00:52:24,271 --> 00:52:28,612
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a plan, that plan is being implemented, and the results are already bearing fruit.

650
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:31,173
[SPEAKER_11]: We fell behind decades.

651
00:52:31,293 --> 00:52:32,453
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's just the truth.

652
00:52:32,513 --> 00:52:33,554
[SPEAKER_11]: We fell behind decades.

653
00:52:33,854 --> 00:52:40,736
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't agree with every decision that the mayors previous have taken, but we are in a situation now where we need

654
00:52:41,596 --> 00:52:43,278
[SPEAKER_11]: to face the facts as they are now.

655
00:52:43,438 --> 00:52:57,113
[SPEAKER_11]: High inflation, lack of new growth over the last few decades means that we need to do a short-term plan, which is these three questions, and then a long-term plan, which is investing in new growth, which is what our zoning efforts are.

656
00:52:59,075 --> 00:52:59,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

657
00:52:59,495 --> 00:53:00,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Collins.

658
00:53:01,923 --> 00:53:02,823
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, President Bears.

659
00:53:03,224 --> 00:53:05,745
[SPEAKER_24]: I appreciate the discussion from my fellow councilors on this topic.

660
00:53:06,525 --> 00:53:09,106
[SPEAKER_24]: I won't go into the topic of new growth.

661
00:53:09,146 --> 00:53:10,867
[SPEAKER_24]: My fellow councilors have covered that.

662
00:53:10,947 --> 00:53:23,073
[SPEAKER_24]: We are very optimistic about how the council's current work on zoning and permitting, which we've been keeping up for two terms, will continue to accelerate new growth and augment the city's operating budget to the greatest extent possible.

663
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:27,115
[SPEAKER_24]: I do just want to note that on the issue of free cash, just to, I think,

664
00:53:28,359 --> 00:53:31,600
[SPEAKER_24]: Different ways of framing the issue are helpful for me, maybe for other people.

665
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:53,064
[SPEAKER_24]: It's no secret that we accrued free cash over several years, and that was not dispersed into savings accounts where it could be used and spent on capital expenditures because our city, unlike almost every other city and town in Massachusetts, before this year did not have any stabilization accounts.

666
00:53:53,504 --> 00:53:54,024
[SPEAKER_24]: Now we do.

667
00:53:54,204 --> 00:53:56,705
[SPEAKER_24]: That means that that money can go to the purposes that I think

668
00:53:57,225 --> 00:54:02,068
[SPEAKER_24]: City staff and many residents really wanted it to be going to expected it to be going to all along.

669
00:54:02,548 --> 00:54:05,469
[SPEAKER_24]: Things like capital expenses and also repairing our infrastructure.

670
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:14,874
[SPEAKER_24]: Putting aside some of that money that's already been allocated to things that people can see out on the street, helping our DPW and other departments improve life and do basic maintenance in the city.

671
00:54:15,474 --> 00:54:18,456
[SPEAKER_24]: Even if you say, okay, let's forget some of those capital expenditures.

672
00:54:18,476 --> 00:54:22,198
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's pretend that we still have $25 million in free cash, just using an easy number.

673
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:33,155
[SPEAKER_24]: That's one-eighth of the city's annual operating budget, which means, you know, if it's one-eighth, you can understand how quickly we would run through that if we were using that as things to plug the hole in the budget.

674
00:54:33,975 --> 00:54:38,357
[SPEAKER_24]: And I do want to emphasize that doesn't include any capital expenses whatsoever.

675
00:54:39,618 --> 00:54:46,741
[SPEAKER_24]: Going back to the resident's question on why now, I think it comes down to we know that free cash is not sustainable.

676
00:54:47,581 --> 00:54:54,005
[SPEAKER_24]: We know that we're already full steam on new growth, but we need more and better funding and services for our residents now.

677
00:54:54,686 --> 00:55:06,974
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think the question is, do we want to punish residents and students for past shortcomings by failing to invest now, or do we want to take this opportunity to start making Medford better for all residents and students in the public schools?

678
00:55:07,334 --> 00:55:08,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

679
00:55:10,814 --> 00:55:11,975
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everybody went on that.

680
00:55:12,855 --> 00:55:19,819
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to avoid everybody answering every question if we can at all possible, but everyone did give a different answer, which is appreciated context.

681
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:27,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to be brief myself to ignore my own advice and say, light poles are falling down.

682
00:55:28,284 --> 00:55:35,929
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a meeting two weeks ago where a light pole fell on a public way, and luckily it happened at night, so it didn't hit a car or a person and hurt them.

683
00:55:35,949 --> 00:55:38,270
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's the situation that we're in.

684
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:39,471
[SPEAKER_04]: We have finally,

685
00:55:40,106 --> 00:55:42,767
[SPEAKER_04]: appropriated some funds to a capital stabilization fund.

686
00:55:42,787 --> 00:55:45,988
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a paper on the meeting at seven o'clock to look at that.

687
00:55:46,588 --> 00:55:52,530
[SPEAKER_04]: We are in a historic multi-decade deficit where we have massive needs.

688
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:56,151
[SPEAKER_04]: The free cash that is being spoken of is spoken for.

689
00:55:57,079 --> 00:56:02,463
[SPEAKER_04]: It is spoken for, it needs to go to our roads, it needs to go to our schools, it needs to go to fix things that are already broken.

690
00:56:04,464 --> 00:56:06,465
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you, please stop, thank you.

691
00:56:07,286 --> 00:56:09,688
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just reality.

692
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:15,652
[SPEAKER_04]: If we use that to plug operating budget holes, we'll have to plug those holes with new revenue in the future.

693
00:56:16,192 --> 00:56:20,395
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't wait for the new growth from our new zoning, which will take five to 10 years to propagate.

694
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:25,879
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think any of us want more light posts falling in the sink, we certainly

695
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:28,941
[SPEAKER_04]: should be grateful that so far they've only been falling at night.

696
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:30,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

697
00:56:30,542 --> 00:56:32,843
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to the podium for the next question.

698
00:56:32,863 --> 00:56:34,264
[SPEAKER_04]: You have one minute to ask one question.

699
00:56:34,284 --> 00:56:35,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

700
00:56:36,045 --> 00:56:40,047
[SPEAKER_30]: My name is Maureen Tardelli, 11 Chester Avenue, Medford.

701
00:56:40,848 --> 00:56:42,149
[SPEAKER_30]: And this is my question.

702
00:56:43,322 --> 00:56:58,634
[SPEAKER_30]: where financial professionals, business owners, residents, firefighters, school administrators, teachers, parents, the chief assessor, and the DPW commissioner, part of the financial task force.

703
00:57:00,235 --> 00:57:01,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your question.

704
00:57:01,056 --> 00:57:02,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Would anyone like to answer the question?

705
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Collins.

706
00:57:07,807 --> 00:57:08,147
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

707
00:57:09,108 --> 00:57:20,377
[SPEAKER_24]: The financial task force was a group explicitly made up of elected to consider the question of what we would put before our elected bodies to deal with solutions around this problem.

708
00:57:21,258 --> 00:57:24,060
[SPEAKER_24]: However, I feel really comfortable in saying that all of the.

709
00:57:25,622 --> 00:57:33,892
[SPEAKER_24]: above types of people, city staff, members of the community, were consulted in various ways, formally and informally, throughout this process.

710
00:57:34,393 --> 00:57:41,762
[SPEAKER_24]: Some that people talked to, some that members of the financial task force talked to while we were considering these matters that were discussed in our meetings.

711
00:57:42,183 --> 00:57:43,605
[SPEAKER_24]: Some of that were explicitly consulted.

712
00:57:44,705 --> 00:57:57,332
[SPEAKER_24]: And others that have just been part of this greater conversation around what should we do with about what should we do about chronic underfunding in Medford over the course of months and months and years and years of challenges that have led up to this year in which we are.

713
00:57:59,477 --> 00:58:14,245
[SPEAKER_24]: Working together to try to solve these issues once and for all, instead of having budget season after budget season, where the school budget is essentially held hostage by our inability to raise enough money to add to provide the services that residents.

714
00:58:14,785 --> 00:58:16,947
[SPEAKER_24]: students and teachers expect and deserve.

715
00:58:17,567 --> 00:58:31,156
[SPEAKER_24]: And I also just want to underline, again, that these ballot questions, every single resident, every single voter in Medford, whether you're a parent, a teacher, a union member, somebody who works for the city, who also lives in the city, you get to use your voice.

716
00:58:31,436 --> 00:58:32,537
[SPEAKER_24]: You get to cast your vote.

717
00:58:32,557 --> 00:58:33,698
[SPEAKER_24]: You can vote yes on all three.

718
00:58:33,738 --> 00:58:34,979
[SPEAKER_24]: You can vote no on all three.

719
00:58:35,019 --> 00:58:37,741
[SPEAKER_24]: You can choose which ones you feel comfortable voting yes and voting no on.

720
00:58:38,141 --> 00:58:43,004
[SPEAKER_24]: You are a part of this conversation because every single person who votes gets a vote.

721
00:58:43,324 --> 00:58:43,584
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

722
00:58:48,134 --> 00:58:48,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

723
00:58:48,874 --> 00:58:49,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other one?

724
00:58:49,615 --> 00:58:50,235
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's all I have.

725
00:58:50,295 --> 00:58:51,816
[SPEAKER_40]: Yeah, I can, Mr. President.

726
00:58:51,856 --> 00:58:52,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Two minutes.

727
00:58:52,456 --> 00:58:52,836
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

728
00:58:52,916 --> 00:59:02,401
[SPEAKER_40]: So again, this financial task force was put together without any individual involved in that comment that a young lady put forth.

729
00:59:02,981 --> 00:59:03,962
[SPEAKER_40]: This was done in a bubble.

730
00:59:04,302 --> 00:59:05,863
[SPEAKER_40]: This was done behind closed doors.

731
00:59:06,503 --> 00:59:16,328
[SPEAKER_40]: It wasn't planned to educate our seniors, educate our residents, educate our renters, educate our landlords, so they could prepare themselves for what's being asked for.

732
00:59:17,048 --> 00:59:22,534
[SPEAKER_40]: within a vote that was presented, a discussion was presented on a Thursday, voted on a Tuesday.

733
00:59:24,266 --> 00:59:25,607
[SPEAKER_40]: not one community meeting.

734
00:59:25,627 --> 00:59:28,788
[SPEAKER_40]: And as a matter of fact, I will share this with everybody.

735
00:59:29,208 --> 00:59:35,011
[SPEAKER_40]: There was a FOIA request put out by a resident that asked a simple question.

736
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:52,278
[SPEAKER_40]: They asked for all of the information, minutes for the meetings, any information, letters, any emails, any text messages, with this financial task force, with any building or any entity within the city to figure out if this is needed or how it will be used and how it can work.

737
00:59:53,660 --> 01:00:00,443
[SPEAKER_40]: 150 pages later, all the information that was in that FOIA request were information about when we can meet.

738
01:00:00,703 --> 01:00:01,984
[SPEAKER_40]: Nothing that's solid.

739
01:00:02,384 --> 01:00:07,687
[SPEAKER_40]: I would also share with these parents that are so concerned about what's happening, we were

740
01:00:08,527 --> 01:00:11,830
[SPEAKER_40]: saw the information back from the school department.

741
01:00:12,251 --> 01:00:17,696
[SPEAKER_40]: The school department communications director answered by saying, thank you for the FOIA request.

742
01:00:17,736 --> 01:00:19,618
[SPEAKER_40]: We apologize for the tardy response.

743
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:28,847
[SPEAKER_40]: But after investigating, there was no school department employee or member of the school department involved in any financial task force

744
01:00:30,028 --> 01:00:31,389
[SPEAKER_40]: dealing with these overrides.

745
01:00:31,409 --> 01:00:35,831
[SPEAKER_40]: So what again, what we're saying is we don't know if an override is needed.

746
01:00:36,331 --> 01:00:41,393
[SPEAKER_40]: We know one thing, we know we could fix this issue right now with free cash.

747
01:00:41,413 --> 01:00:44,354
[SPEAKER_40]: So our students and teachers and families are fine.

748
01:00:44,734 --> 01:00:49,817
[SPEAKER_40]: And then we go back to the drawing board as a community together to see what we really need.

749
01:00:50,137 --> 01:00:57,160
[SPEAKER_40]: If the mayor isn't gonna put new growth out there, she's not gonna work to bring in creatively, bring in funding for the city, then maybe we can look at it.

750
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:57,700
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

751
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Callahan.

752
01:01:03,781 --> 01:01:04,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Callahan.

753
01:01:05,382 --> 01:01:05,682
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

754
01:01:06,483 --> 01:01:09,444
[SPEAKER_26]: I hear a lot of people asking about free cash.

755
01:01:09,484 --> 01:01:11,205
[SPEAKER_26]: I think misunderstanding what free cash is.

756
01:01:12,005 --> 01:01:15,927
[SPEAKER_26]: First thing I'd like to say is, free cash, dumb name, it's not free, it's not cash, okay?

757
01:01:15,947 --> 01:01:17,988
[SPEAKER_26]: So, free cash, sorry?

758
01:01:18,828 --> 01:01:19,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Rick, Rick, come on, Rick.

759
01:01:20,349 --> 01:01:21,149
[SPEAKER_26]: Free, free cash.

760
01:01:21,169 --> 01:01:22,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't shout in this room.

761
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:25,891
[SPEAKER_04]: You know better and you wouldn't take it if you were, you wouldn't take it if you were sitting up here, Rick.

762
01:01:25,911 --> 01:01:27,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't, let's not go down this road.

763
01:01:28,083 --> 01:01:28,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, everyone, stop.

764
01:01:28,825 --> 01:01:30,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's not go down this road, guys.

765
01:01:30,468 --> 01:01:31,470
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really not needed.

766
01:01:32,112 --> 01:01:33,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan, you have the floor.

767
01:01:33,575 --> 01:01:34,376
[SPEAKER_26]: May I get my two minutes?

768
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:37,142
[SPEAKER_26]: Will I get my two minutes?

769
01:01:37,702 --> 01:01:38,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we'll go back to two minutes.

770
01:01:39,043 --> 01:01:40,003
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

771
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:49,787
[SPEAKER_26]: Free cash is the term that the state uses for the money that is left over after your budget season has ended.

772
01:01:49,968 --> 01:01:54,670
[SPEAKER_26]: So it's the difference between what you budget, which, let's say, is $180 million, and the amount you spent, which, let's say, is $172 million.

773
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:56,150
[SPEAKER_26]: That $8 million, which is the difference, is called free cash.

774
01:02:02,313 --> 01:02:11,499
[SPEAKER_26]: Now, the state of Massachusetts has a group called the Division of Local Services, and their job is to help cities and towns become financially responsible.

775
01:02:12,523 --> 01:02:22,307
[SPEAKER_26]: They highly recommend that cities and towns in Massachusetts have 3 to 5% of their budget left over in free cash every single year.

776
01:02:22,867 --> 01:02:26,449
[SPEAKER_26]: In Medford, that amount would be between $5 million and $9 million.

777
01:02:27,329 --> 01:02:33,612
[SPEAKER_26]: If you don't have between 3 and 5% of your budget left over in free cash, you are considered financially irresponsible.

778
01:02:33,932 --> 01:02:36,993
[SPEAKER_26]: by credit agencies and your bond rating goes down.

779
01:02:37,514 --> 01:02:41,235
[SPEAKER_26]: Now that is very bad because it changes, just like if your credit rating is bad.

780
01:02:41,715 --> 01:02:44,877
[SPEAKER_26]: It changes the amount that you have to spend anytime you borrow money.

781
01:02:45,397 --> 01:02:48,298
[SPEAKER_26]: So we want to be a financially responsible city.

782
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:52,160
[SPEAKER_26]: So having money left over in free cash, and I'm going to

783
01:02:53,020 --> 01:03:02,488
[SPEAKER_26]: I have another chart here because I think it's important for people to understand that this city was in the past very financially irresponsible.

784
01:03:02,868 --> 01:03:07,872
[SPEAKER_26]: If you notice that before 2012, we couldn't even meet our budget many years.

785
01:03:08,472 --> 01:03:14,197
[SPEAKER_26]: We definitely never reached that 3% in free cash and our bond rating was terrible.

786
01:03:14,697 --> 01:03:19,781
[SPEAKER_26]: So it's only in recent years that we have begun to have anywhere close to the required 3%.

787
01:03:21,162 --> 01:03:21,942
[SPEAKER_26]: in free cash.

788
01:03:22,342 --> 01:03:27,924
[SPEAKER_26]: Now free cash according to the state of Massachusetts should never be used for an operating budget.

789
01:03:28,284 --> 01:03:30,124
[SPEAKER_26]: It needs to be used for capital projects.

790
01:03:30,444 --> 01:03:35,246
[SPEAKER_26]: We currently because of underfunding of our roads have $67 million in road debt.

791
01:03:35,586 --> 01:03:40,507
[SPEAKER_26]: We have $79 million in our capital improvement plan for things that need to be done only in the next

792
01:03:41,274 --> 01:03:42,095
[SPEAKER_26]: Three to five years.

793
01:03:42,115 --> 01:03:42,735
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 seconds.

794
01:03:42,995 --> 01:03:55,483
[SPEAKER_26]: So we cannot use free cash for something like our school budget that is absolutely verboten according to financially responsible people in the state of Massachusetts.

795
01:03:55,643 --> 01:03:55,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Wrong.

796
01:03:55,843 --> 01:03:56,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

797
01:03:57,084 --> 01:03:58,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell them the truth, Councilor.

798
01:03:58,224 --> 01:03:59,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

799
01:04:01,294 --> 01:04:04,775
[SPEAKER_04]: As a member of the financial task force, it was very clear.

800
01:04:05,955 --> 01:04:13,557
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually had a lot of public meetings called fiscal 23 budget process, fiscal 24 budget process, fiscal 25 budget process.

801
01:04:14,118 --> 01:04:26,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of folks remember if you're watching those meetings, me sitting in that chair in 2022 and being pretty hard on this mayor because we didn't have the information that we needed.

802
01:04:27,503 --> 01:04:39,086
[SPEAKER_04]: and working to establish a task force, working to establish a budget ordinance, working to establish a flow of information, and hear from stakeholders, all the stakeholders that were mentioned in the question.

803
01:04:40,017 --> 01:04:40,998
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we need?

804
01:04:41,178 --> 01:04:42,579
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we not seeing happen?

805
01:04:42,659 --> 01:04:44,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are we in the situation that we're in?

806
01:04:44,820 --> 01:05:03,893
[SPEAKER_04]: That resulted this year in the earliest budget process we've had with meetings before we got the budget, input from the council and the public before the mayor presented a budget, and a full and accounting of what our serious structural deficit is for our schools and for this city.

807
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:08,496
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that we need more money to do what people want the city to do.

808
01:05:09,517 --> 01:05:13,698
[SPEAKER_04]: We're asking the voters to do that, and that's what it is.

809
01:05:13,818 --> 01:05:18,719
[SPEAKER_04]: If the voters say no, then we will have to make cuts, and we will do that, because that is what the voters decided.

810
01:05:19,259 --> 01:05:24,920
[SPEAKER_04]: If the voters choose to vote yes, then we will have the financial resources that we need to do our jobs.

811
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:30,721
[SPEAKER_04]: That is essentially what happened, and that is essentially the choice before us as a community.

812
01:05:30,741 --> 01:05:32,582
[SPEAKER_04]: When we want to talk about the financial task force,

813
01:05:33,402 --> 01:05:34,743
[SPEAKER_04]: was announced in a public meeting.

814
01:05:35,183 --> 01:05:37,125
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a bunch of public releases from that.

815
01:05:37,585 --> 01:05:39,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Every step of the way, we're starting to meet.

816
01:05:40,327 --> 01:05:41,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what we're talking about.

817
01:05:41,829 --> 01:05:43,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what we're considering for the framework.

818
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:44,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Here is the final framework.

819
01:05:45,251 --> 01:05:53,037
[SPEAKER_04]: The specifics were discussed extensively in council meetings and school committee meetings for a year, that these were our budget needs.

820
01:05:53,578 --> 01:05:53,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

821
01:05:57,432 --> 01:05:59,193
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll go to the podium for the next question.

822
01:05:59,493 --> 01:06:01,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Jones, name and address the record.

823
01:06:01,033 --> 01:06:02,294
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a minute for your question.

824
01:06:02,614 --> 01:06:03,014
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes, sir.

825
01:06:03,114 --> 01:06:04,315
[SPEAKER_38]: Bob Jones, 5 St.

826
01:06:04,355 --> 01:06:05,555
[SPEAKER_38]: Mary Street, Medford Mass.

827
01:06:05,615 --> 01:06:10,237
[SPEAKER_38]: I'd like to start with expressing my condolences for Larry Lepore, the city messenger.

828
01:06:10,297 --> 01:06:10,677
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

829
01:06:10,998 --> 01:06:11,538
[SPEAKER_38]: Great guy.

830
01:06:11,758 --> 01:06:14,419
[SPEAKER_38]: Probably one of the longest serving city employees.

831
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:15,399
[SPEAKER_38]: He's always there.

832
01:06:15,419 --> 01:06:16,300
[SPEAKER_38]: He's been a staple there.

833
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:17,360
[SPEAKER_38]: He's always done a great job.

834
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,041
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to give you another 15 seconds.

835
01:06:19,081 --> 01:06:21,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to say for folks who have joined since I started the meeting,

836
01:06:22,282 --> 01:06:26,043
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be talking about Larry at our meeting after this, and I hope folks have something they want to share.

837
01:06:26,444 --> 01:06:27,064
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll stick around.

838
01:06:27,104 --> 01:06:27,584
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to hear.

839
01:06:27,604 --> 01:06:28,644
[SPEAKER_38]: He will be missed.

840
01:06:28,885 --> 01:06:29,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

841
01:06:29,345 --> 01:06:32,046
[SPEAKER_38]: And I thank you for this format as well.

842
01:06:32,706 --> 01:06:37,788
[SPEAKER_38]: There are so many things I'd like to ask, and I have to keep it in one, but it's regarding the financial task force.

843
01:06:38,108 --> 01:06:45,951
[SPEAKER_38]: So the financial task, correct me if I go wrong here, was Councilor Bears, Councilor Collins, school committee person, Jenny Graham.

844
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:49,805
[SPEAKER_38]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn, and Nina Nazarian, correct?

845
01:06:49,825 --> 01:06:50,446
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes, yes.

846
01:06:50,526 --> 01:06:53,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so there was no- It was Councilor Morell before January.

847
01:06:53,349 --> 01:06:54,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morell, okay.

848
01:06:54,070 --> 01:06:54,210
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah.

849
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:58,734
[SPEAKER_38]: So the auditor of the city was not present, was not part of the force, the task force.

850
01:06:58,774 --> 01:07:00,436
[SPEAKER_38]: The assessor was not part of the task force.

851
01:07:01,037 --> 01:07:03,379
[SPEAKER_38]: The school finance director was not part of the task force.

852
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,981
[SPEAKER_38]: And let's see, one other person.

853
01:07:06,021 --> 01:07:06,722
[SPEAKER_40]: Financial director.

854
01:07:07,083 --> 01:07:08,304
[SPEAKER_38]: Financial director, I'm sorry.

855
01:07:10,472 --> 01:07:13,194
[SPEAKER_38]: Bob Dixon, he was not part of the task force, correct, okay.

856
01:07:13,654 --> 01:07:15,755
[SPEAKER_38]: So now, understood.

857
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:36,708
[SPEAKER_38]: Where can I find the documents, any data, calculations, discussions, any sort of metrics that were used from the financial task force to show how the numbers of 30 million for the debt exclusion and a prop two and a half of seven and a half million

858
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:39,258
[SPEAKER_38]: and how was that determined?

859
01:07:39,538 --> 01:07:46,824
[SPEAKER_38]: The 30 million was not stated in the debt exclusion, which is, no, it's never stated in a debt exclusion, I believe, amount.

860
01:07:47,624 --> 01:07:49,486
[SPEAKER_38]: So I'm just wondering where that came from.

861
01:07:50,106 --> 01:07:53,849
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm hearing from the administration, 30 million and not a dime more.

862
01:07:54,209 --> 01:07:56,591
[SPEAKER_38]: So that's something I've heard offhand.

863
01:07:57,232 --> 01:07:57,992
[SPEAKER_38]: So that's my question.

864
01:07:58,012 --> 01:08:05,278
[SPEAKER_38]: Where can I find documents from the Financial Task Force showing how these discussions, numbers, and figures were determined?

865
01:08:05,731 --> 01:08:06,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

866
01:08:06,331 --> 01:08:08,493
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go to Vice President Collins, two minutes.

867
01:08:09,914 --> 01:08:10,635
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for the question.

868
01:08:11,856 --> 01:08:19,382
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, speaking as a member of the financial task force, I want to try to put this a different way because maybe I wasn't, I want to try putting this differently.

869
01:08:21,403 --> 01:08:28,168
[SPEAKER_24]: The financial task force, this group of electeds, tasked with- And the chief of staff.

870
01:08:28,809 --> 01:08:28,969
[SPEAKER_38]: Right.

871
01:08:29,109 --> 01:08:30,770
[SPEAKER_38]: Electeds and the chief of staff.

872
01:08:30,911 --> 01:08:32,051
[SPEAKER_24]: As the mayor's staff.

873
01:08:32,232 --> 01:08:32,392
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

874
01:08:34,189 --> 01:08:37,352
[SPEAKER_24]: If I had a staff person, I probably want them with me taking notes as well.

875
01:08:40,114 --> 01:08:45,979
[SPEAKER_24]: Our assignment was to create a proposal for a political solution to a community-wide problem.

876
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:48,762
[SPEAKER_24]: And that is why this task force was made up of electeds.

877
01:08:49,242 --> 01:08:58,751
[SPEAKER_24]: I think folks who are asking the question, rightfully so, of why did you come up with what you came up with should

878
01:08:59,801 --> 01:09:11,815
[SPEAKER_24]: look to the hours and hours of tape that we have the public meetings that we've had in this chambers between the city council and the school committee where we discussed that question in terms of why seven and a half million dollars.

879
01:09:14,619 --> 01:09:30,548
[SPEAKER_24]: Gosh, there's a lot of school committee meetings enumerating exactly what we cut in various different budget scenarios to back up why we think that this is the number that is at the nexus of what we know that we need and what we think that we can reasonably ask of the residents to strike that sweet spot between

880
01:09:31,044 --> 01:09:41,292
[SPEAKER_24]: trying to maintain an equitable and deserved school experience for Medford Public School students with something that the community can be comfortable with and can say yes to.

881
01:09:42,393 --> 01:09:55,564
[SPEAKER_24]: It is our job as people who run for offices, instead of going to planning school and trying to get a job in City Hall, to try to come up with, for lack of a better word, political solutions to real life community-wide problems.

882
01:09:55,804 --> 01:09:59,647
[SPEAKER_24]: That is what the task force sought to do, and now everybody gets the chance to vote on it.

883
01:10:01,323 --> 01:10:02,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, anyone else?

884
01:10:02,163 --> 01:10:02,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

885
01:10:03,044 --> 01:10:04,804
[SPEAKER_40]: Sure, let me help you, Mr. Jones.

886
01:10:06,545 --> 01:10:08,365
[SPEAKER_40]: This financial task force was a farce.

887
01:10:08,905 --> 01:10:10,706
[SPEAKER_40]: There was a lack of transparency throughout.

888
01:10:11,126 --> 01:10:16,427
[SPEAKER_40]: When you speak on, I speak to this in where I worked in 2009.

889
01:10:16,988 --> 01:10:21,349
[SPEAKER_40]: When we met in a possible override in a neighboring community, we talked about three things.

890
01:10:21,449 --> 01:10:22,289
[SPEAKER_40]: It was how do we get here?

891
01:10:23,009 --> 01:10:23,930
[SPEAKER_40]: What do we do to fix it?

892
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:26,230
[SPEAKER_40]: And how does this happen again?

893
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:27,971
[SPEAKER_40]: And those people brought in

894
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:33,014
[SPEAKER_40]: mines from Tufts, Harvard, MIT, Medford, not one person.

895
01:10:33,534 --> 01:10:36,737
[SPEAKER_40]: They brought in their financial team, Medford, not one person.

896
01:10:37,077 --> 01:10:40,920
[SPEAKER_40]: They had their assessor set the rate so people can understand, assessor was never involved.

897
01:10:41,906 --> 01:10:49,173
[SPEAKER_40]: When you look at how this was done, this was done in a bubble, this was presented on a Thursday, and then voted for in the budget meetings.

898
01:10:49,273 --> 01:10:58,381
[SPEAKER_40]: If you look at the budget meetings, when I brought up the way to fix it, which is free cash, and I'll disagree with my fellow Councilor, because she's wrong 1,000%.

899
01:11:01,284 --> 01:11:07,530
[SPEAKER_40]: Free cash for divisional local services, it's not recommended, but not against the law to use free cash.

900
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:21,090
[SPEAKER_40]: 3 to 5% annual budget, FY24 method generated $9 million to add to a $25 million estimate, which means the city had around 16% of free cash.

901
01:11:21,831 --> 01:11:24,132
[SPEAKER_40]: But again, the solution was very simple.

902
01:11:24,732 --> 01:11:29,596
[SPEAKER_40]: Let's have this financial task force present this to the community, because that's what I asked for.

903
01:11:29,616 --> 01:11:32,978
[SPEAKER_40]: I asked my colleagues, when are we going to present what the findings were?

904
01:11:33,198 --> 01:11:34,059
[SPEAKER_40]: There were no findings.

905
01:11:34,479 --> 01:11:36,120
[SPEAKER_40]: It was just given, we're going to do an override.

906
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:38,782
[SPEAKER_40]: People came up, shared, the mayor was happy, and it was done.

907
01:11:39,382 --> 01:11:41,584
[SPEAKER_40]: The truth of the matter is, you're right.

908
01:11:42,405 --> 01:11:43,846
[SPEAKER_40]: There was no one involved.

909
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:49,951
[SPEAKER_40]: This was done in a bubble to scare people, to come out and say, the schools, the kids.

910
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:51,212
[SPEAKER_40]: And I'll say it again.

911
01:11:51,252 --> 01:11:52,113
[SPEAKER_40]: I said this in April.

912
01:11:52,133 --> 01:11:52,694
[SPEAKER_40]: I said it in May.

913
01:11:52,714 --> 01:11:53,514
[SPEAKER_40]: I'll say it today again.

914
01:11:54,996 --> 01:12:00,981
[SPEAKER_40]: We might need an override, but if we do it right, with open and transparent government, we could do something great.

915
01:12:01,361 --> 01:12:12,591
[SPEAKER_40]: Now remember, with one override in every other community, there's two, three to follow, and don't forget, this council's gonna ask for a 200 to $400 million debt exclusion from New High School, which we need.

916
01:12:12,611 --> 01:12:14,673
[SPEAKER_40]: So this is fear.

917
01:12:14,954 --> 01:12:16,315
[SPEAKER_40]: Please don't be confused.

918
01:12:16,555 --> 01:12:17,716
[SPEAKER_40]: We're not telling you the truth.

919
01:12:17,736 --> 01:12:18,116
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

920
01:12:18,136 --> 01:12:19,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

921
01:12:19,257 --> 01:12:19,558
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

922
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:28,185
[SPEAKER_38]: There's no follow-up, sorry, Bob.

923
01:12:28,225 --> 01:12:32,227
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm trying to clarify something that was just spoken about by the two councils here.

924
01:12:32,347 --> 01:12:33,728
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, is this about free cash?

925
01:12:34,088 --> 01:12:34,989
[SPEAKER_38]: It's about free cash.

926
01:12:35,029 --> 01:12:35,229
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

927
01:12:35,269 --> 01:12:40,112
[SPEAKER_38]: Three to five percent is a total, an aggregate total, not every year.

928
01:12:40,352 --> 01:12:40,553
[SPEAKER_38]: Right.

929
01:12:41,193 --> 01:12:42,894
[SPEAKER_38]: So that's where that figure comes from.

930
01:12:43,074 --> 01:12:43,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

931
01:12:43,554 --> 01:12:44,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, I wanted to answer your question.

932
01:12:45,256 --> 01:12:45,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

933
01:12:45,656 --> 01:12:50,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you heard a good story, but the fact of the matter is,

934
01:12:51,971 --> 01:13:02,940
[SPEAKER_04]: There were five members of the financial task force, the council president, the council vice president, the chair of the school committee, who's the mayor, the vice chair of the school committee, and the chief of staff for the mayor, who administratively runs city hall.

935
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:06,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were the members of the task force.

936
01:13:06,943 --> 01:13:08,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were the members of the task force.

937
01:13:09,158 --> 01:13:10,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Did we talk to other people?

938
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:11,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

939
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:17,225
[SPEAKER_04]: The $3 million number comes from the school finance director from the fiscal 25 budget process.

940
01:13:17,705 --> 01:13:21,749
[SPEAKER_04]: $500,000 number for the DPW street and sidewalk group comes from the DPW commissioner.

941
01:13:22,349 --> 01:13:36,802
[SPEAKER_04]: The $4 million number for the question eight, that comes also from the fiscal 25 and 24 school budget process from the finance director, from many of the administrators in the Medford public schools talking about, this is what we need to do the things that people are asking us to do.

942
01:13:37,462 --> 01:13:46,610
[SPEAKER_04]: And the $30 million bond number for the fire headquarters came from the mayor, the chief of staff, and the fire chief based on the design process for the new headquarters.

943
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:47,951
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where it came from.

944
01:13:48,692 --> 01:13:49,532
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a bubble.

945
01:13:49,953 --> 01:13:51,274
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not we didn't talk to anybody.

946
01:13:51,334 --> 01:13:52,355
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not we made things up.

947
01:13:53,075 --> 01:13:54,556
[SPEAKER_04]: There have been documented meetings.

948
01:13:54,777 --> 01:13:56,018
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked to other people.

949
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:57,099
[SPEAKER_04]: We engaged the

950
01:13:57,799 --> 01:14:03,084
[SPEAKER_04]: folks who have the information in the city and said, if we're trying to address these problems, what would it cost?

951
01:14:03,805 --> 01:14:04,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what the proposals are.

952
01:14:05,426 --> 01:14:06,587
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's plain as day.

953
01:14:07,288 --> 01:14:15,556
[SPEAKER_04]: We have, again, public statements and documents for a year talking about the process, the membership, the framework, and the final result.

954
01:14:16,076 --> 01:14:18,579
[SPEAKER_04]: We have budget meetings and documents for over

955
01:14:20,103 --> 01:14:26,669
[SPEAKER_04]: two and a half, three years, dozens of recordings of this body and the school committee talking about these needs.

956
01:14:27,890 --> 01:14:35,476
[SPEAKER_04]: So I encourage folks to look at the last three budget processes, because they'll pretty much get you exactly the numbers that you'll see on the ballot on November 5th.

957
01:14:35,916 --> 01:14:37,598
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why we're asking voters to vote yes.

958
01:14:37,918 --> 01:14:38,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

959
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:41,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Leming.

960
01:14:42,151 --> 01:14:44,893
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, just to go back on that 3 to 5% thing.

961
01:14:44,993 --> 01:14:46,673
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not 3 to 5% in totality.

962
01:14:46,713 --> 01:14:50,656
[SPEAKER_13]: It actually is recommended to generate 3 to 5% in free cash every year.

963
01:14:51,036 --> 01:14:52,677
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is correct.

964
01:14:52,717 --> 01:14:54,338
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure where you're getting.

965
01:14:54,358 --> 01:14:57,219
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm going to agree with this view on that.

966
01:14:57,639 --> 01:14:58,620
[SPEAKER_13]: You can Google it.

967
01:14:58,640 --> 01:14:59,220
[SPEAKER_13]: You can look it up.

968
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,041
[SPEAKER_13]: I encourage you to.

969
01:15:01,161 --> 01:15:06,964
[SPEAKER_13]: But the point is, you generate three to 5% in free cash, and then it goes that can aggregate over time.

970
01:15:06,984 --> 01:15:13,407
[SPEAKER_13]: And then that can go towards one time capital expenditures, like for instance, two new fire trucks for the fire department.

971
01:15:13,427 --> 01:15:19,530
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how these big, that's how these sort of, I'd say, midsize expenses are accounted for.

972
01:15:20,003 --> 01:15:30,930
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, if I have a savings account and I'm living above my means, then eventually the savings account would run out.

973
01:15:31,491 --> 01:15:36,614
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're not supposed to plug the school budget every single year with free cash.

974
01:15:37,594 --> 01:15:39,755
[SPEAKER_13]: because it would run out eventually.

975
01:15:40,115 --> 01:15:49,318
[SPEAKER_13]: We did that with $1.75 million this past year with the understanding that we would then do an override to try to fix the problem in the long term.

976
01:15:49,658 --> 01:15:52,339
[SPEAKER_13]: Free cash is not a long-term solution.

977
01:15:52,459 --> 01:15:55,580
[SPEAKER_13]: That keeps getting repeated, and I really just want to drive the point home.

978
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:58,221
[SPEAKER_13]: It is not actually an answer to this problem.

979
01:15:59,285 --> 01:16:01,108
[SPEAKER_38]: It is a choice that can be used.

980
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:05,455
[SPEAKER_38]: I believe the bond rating is based on the total free cash.

981
01:16:05,855 --> 01:16:06,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Jones.

982
01:16:06,636 --> 01:16:06,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

983
01:16:07,097 --> 01:16:09,240
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to Zoom for the next question.

984
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:10,342
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to Zoe Moutsos.

985
01:16:11,063 --> 01:16:12,285
[SPEAKER_04]: One minute to ask your question.

986
01:16:12,345 --> 01:16:14,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

987
01:16:15,323 --> 01:16:19,184
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi Zoe Muzo's 33 Johnson Avenue.

988
01:16:19,204 --> 01:16:25,866
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm really appreciative that the city after 40 years has decided to allow the voters to decide on this matter.

989
01:16:25,886 --> 01:16:30,868
[SPEAKER_20]: I have taken my time to educate myself by listening to school committee meetings and

990
01:16:31,368 --> 01:16:32,370
[SPEAKER_20]: which were heartbreaking.

991
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:43,225
[SPEAKER_20]: I've listened to these city council meetings, and I feel confident and not afraid, or like I'm being scared, about how we got here, how we're gonna fix it, and how we make sure it happens again.

992
01:16:43,645 --> 01:16:47,371
[SPEAKER_20]: My question does revolve around free cash, because as I understand it, we...

993
01:16:47,691 --> 01:16:50,172
[SPEAKER_20]: have allocated some of that money that we had.

994
01:16:50,612 --> 01:17:02,256
[SPEAKER_20]: Like I've heard things like we, well, we plugged the city school budget, but also potentially fixing HVAC at the middle schools, et cetera.

995
01:17:02,356 --> 01:17:16,100
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'd like to know what's been used up, how much is left, and in the event that the override doesn't pass and we use free cash again, what are the rim of using it up and not having that rainy day fund, which I think have already been answered.

996
01:17:16,803 --> 01:17:17,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

997
01:17:17,384 --> 01:17:22,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to members of the council to answer that question.

998
01:17:24,076 --> 01:17:25,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Leming, two minutes.

999
01:17:25,897 --> 01:17:35,620
[SPEAKER_13]: So in terms of how much free cash we actually have left, I don't have the numbers right in front of me, but I'm just remembering the expenditures off the top of my head.

1000
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:49,945
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe after it was certified this past June, the number was 34 million, but I believe enough of that has been earmarked for various one-time expenditures at this point so that the actual number is, correct me if I'm wrong, would be about

1001
01:17:51,222 --> 01:17:58,729
[SPEAKER_13]: 10 to 11 million in reserves right now just because I see so much I can see someone shaking their head in the audience but I believe.

1002
01:18:02,905 --> 01:18:17,570
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, this is ballpark numbers because we did allocate free cash first for the stabilization funds, which recently went to things like those light posts that were falling over, that were, you know, rusted.

1003
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:23,371
[SPEAKER_13]: They went to $3 million for the MSBA study.

1004
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:27,753
[SPEAKER_13]: It went to pay for HVAC systems.

1005
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:31,534
[SPEAKER_13]: It went to pay for, there was a,

1006
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:40,813
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, there's a long list of items that were in some memos from a couple of months ago that I think some of my colleagues could help me out.

1007
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:45,502
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go to Councilor Tseng.

1008
01:18:47,182 --> 01:18:47,582
[SPEAKER_11]: two minutes.

1009
01:18:47,942 --> 01:18:48,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1010
01:18:48,402 --> 01:18:48,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1011
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:55,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I mean, continuing off of Councilor Leming's points, those conversations are ones that we're having in public.

1012
01:18:55,704 --> 01:19:04,226
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe that there's an upcoming City Committee of the Whole meeting at some point that we're going to talk about some of how free cash is going to be used.

1013
01:19:04,286 --> 01:19:09,147
[SPEAKER_11]: I know the mayor submitted a paper to us with her proposal and asking us for feedback.

1014
01:19:09,467 --> 01:19:10,748
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all in the council records.

1015
01:19:10,888 --> 01:19:13,889
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all online for folks to find as well.

1016
01:19:15,809 --> 01:19:21,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing about free cash, right, because it's a one time fund, we should be using it on one time expenses.

1017
01:19:22,219 --> 01:19:32,053
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why we're using it on things like roads on the light poles that President Barrett was talking about on HVAC systems and whatnot.

1018
01:19:32,233 --> 01:19:40,882
[SPEAKER_11]: We all know that these are real things that affect how we experience living in our city, affects our kids in our public buildings, and so they are very important expenses.

1019
01:19:41,242 --> 01:19:47,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, added on top of that is the conversation we would have if we didn't spend that money right now, right?

1020
01:19:47,649 --> 01:19:51,072
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if we defer maintenance, which I think everyone in the audience today

1021
01:19:52,398 --> 01:19:54,920
[SPEAKER_11]: acknowledges this has been happening in Medford.

1022
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:57,842
[SPEAKER_11]: If we defer maintenance, those costs go up as well.

1023
01:19:57,902 --> 01:20:01,424
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we need to basically map out all of our uses.

1024
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:09,210
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why our city has been implementing our capital improvement plans, why we've started to take registries of everything that

1025
01:20:09,970 --> 01:20:12,854
[SPEAKER_11]: that we're falling behind on maintenance.

1026
01:20:12,874 --> 01:20:15,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Our buildings director is really good with that work.

1027
01:20:15,838 --> 01:20:25,171
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that's why those funds should be allocated to things like that rather than being used one time on recurring expenses that we can't afford in the future.

1028
01:20:26,092 --> 01:20:28,053
[SPEAKER_11]: So I feel very strongly about that.

1029
01:20:28,113 --> 01:20:30,873
[SPEAKER_11]: The bond agencies feel very strongly about that.

1030
01:20:30,953 --> 01:20:45,217
[SPEAKER_11]: And in fact, if we take the free cash and use that free cash on recurring expenses, it's widely known that the bond agencies would lower our credit rating, as Councilor Callahan mentioned, and our costs for borrowing to do that maintenance work in the future would actually go up.

1031
01:20:45,618 --> 01:20:50,519
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that's something that would be an increased cost on all of us as taxpayers in the city.

1032
01:20:52,336 --> 01:20:53,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

1033
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:55,338
[SPEAKER_40]: Another fair tactic.

1034
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:58,381
[SPEAKER_40]: So people should understand the mayor came out just the other day.

1035
01:20:58,401 --> 01:21:02,624
[SPEAKER_40]: We had 34 million, 34.5 million as of July 1st.

1036
01:21:03,284 --> 01:21:06,407
[SPEAKER_40]: The mayor, just so you know, what free cash is, it's your money.

1037
01:21:06,847 --> 01:21:15,374
[SPEAKER_40]: So when we say we're going to fund 50 teachers and we don't pay those 50 teachers because they don't hire them, that money goes into free cash.

1038
01:21:15,414 --> 01:21:16,935
[SPEAKER_40]: That's our money, that's your tax money.

1039
01:21:17,415 --> 01:21:19,796
[SPEAKER_40]: and then it could be used for what it needs to be.

1040
01:21:19,836 --> 01:21:24,618
[SPEAKER_40]: So it's truly mismanagement of funds from our leadership team.

1041
01:21:24,939 --> 01:21:28,700
[SPEAKER_40]: It's taking what we sign off on our budget and not use correctly.

1042
01:21:29,461 --> 01:21:36,644
[SPEAKER_40]: So what we have right now, I believe I've said this, Councilor Leming said it over and over again, I'm not saying use free cash every year.

1043
01:21:37,385 --> 01:21:39,626
[SPEAKER_40]: We have a deficit right now, correct?

1044
01:21:40,606 --> 01:21:54,433
[SPEAKER_40]: that we can correct right now and not put the schools and kids and teachers in fear and say let's level fund that budget using one time free cash one time and then look into what options we have later but let's listen to the mayor what she said 34.5 million

1045
01:21:56,394 --> 01:21:58,256
[SPEAKER_40]: Now she knows the override's gonna be a fight.

1046
01:21:58,476 --> 01:21:59,036
[SPEAKER_40]: What does she do?

1047
01:21:59,476 --> 01:22:02,599
[SPEAKER_40]: Boom, she starts putting all these different monies in different accounts.

1048
01:22:03,139 --> 01:22:08,343
[SPEAKER_40]: So from her words exactly in her video the other day, we have 18.5 million.

1049
01:22:08,944 --> 01:22:20,252
[SPEAKER_40]: With that said, we can still take funding to level the school budget and still have 14, $15 million, which still leaves enough in there that would appease any bond rating.

1050
01:22:20,553 --> 01:22:23,955
[SPEAKER_40]: So again, let's not get scared because that's a scare tactic.

1051
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,237
[SPEAKER_40]: Let's see the bond rating so we can move forward.

1052
01:22:26,938 --> 01:22:43,778
[SPEAKER_40]: Now, when we look at this situation, council, different communities, free cash, Arlington is 18 million, Framingham 14 million, bigger budget, Quincy 1.2 million, bigger budget, Andover 14 million, Newton, these communities are bigger than ours.

1053
01:22:44,739 --> 01:22:51,163
[SPEAKER_40]: We have this budget, they function with lower funding and free cash.

1054
01:22:51,183 --> 01:22:52,343
[SPEAKER_40]: So understand this, everyone.

1055
01:22:52,724 --> 01:23:02,449
[SPEAKER_40]: We can do this one-time cost to save the fare from our schools, take care of our seniors, our renters, our homeowners, so we can stop the fare in this community.

1056
01:23:02,489 --> 01:23:05,951
[SPEAKER_40]: So please, vote no on these overrides.

1057
01:23:05,971 --> 01:23:07,332
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not needed right now.

1058
01:23:07,612 --> 01:23:08,593
[SPEAKER_40]: It was done in a bubble.

1059
01:23:08,613 --> 01:23:10,033
[SPEAKER_40]: It wasn't transparent.

1060
01:23:10,053 --> 01:23:10,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1061
01:23:10,614 --> 01:23:11,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1062
01:23:11,074 --> 01:23:12,355
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to Councilor Calihan.

1063
01:23:14,605 --> 01:23:30,094
[SPEAKER_26]: two minutes councilor calvin and then councilor collins very quickly the reason that those other cities don't have as much money in free cash is because they weren't last to the table in getting a stabilization fund having a stabilization fund again is considered financially responsible

1064
01:23:30,774 --> 01:23:31,714
[SPEAKER_26]: Medford didn't have one.

1065
01:23:32,755 --> 01:23:36,496
[SPEAKER_26]: There are 451 cities and towns in Massachusetts.

1066
01:23:36,896 --> 01:23:38,596
[SPEAKER_26]: We are one of the last five.

1067
01:23:39,317 --> 01:23:42,818
[SPEAKER_26]: Only five remained this year that did not have a stabilization fund.

1068
01:23:43,038 --> 01:23:46,479
[SPEAKER_26]: That's why we have all this free cash, because we didn't have any stabilization funds.

1069
01:23:47,799 --> 01:23:48,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1070
01:23:48,359 --> 01:23:49,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to Councilor Collins.

1071
01:23:52,901 --> 01:23:53,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Two minutes.

1072
01:23:53,681 --> 01:23:53,961
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1073
01:23:55,001 --> 01:24:00,243
[SPEAKER_24]: Not to put too fine a point on it, but I think we've all acknowledged behind the rail

1074
01:24:00,879 --> 01:24:02,020
[SPEAKER_24]: that we have problems this year.

1075
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:17,452
[SPEAKER_24]: And let's say hypothetically that our free cash was not already allocated to capital funds that our department heads have been advocating for in many cases for years and years and years and being pushed off because we didn't have the money to allocate towards those capital expenses.

1076
01:24:17,472 --> 01:24:23,918
[SPEAKER_24]: And now we're finally able to start chipping away at that very, very long list of projects on our capital improvement plan.

1077
01:24:24,338 --> 01:24:26,820
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's just put aside that point.

1078
01:24:27,637 --> 01:24:35,921
[SPEAKER_24]: and say, hypothetically, what if we still had unallocated free cash that we could use on an operating budget, which we don't because it's allocated to capital projects?

1079
01:24:37,041 --> 01:24:49,146
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that there's a shared acknowledgment behind this rail that that does put us back at square one, and we have to revisit this conversation again in May for fiscal 26 with no better solutions than we do now.

1080
01:24:49,566 --> 01:24:50,407
[SPEAKER_24]: So I've asked myself,

1081
01:24:51,852 --> 01:25:04,455
[SPEAKER_24]: What would I cut if we then approaching fiscal 26 with no better off because new growth takes five to 10 years to really flourish into that robustly improved commercial tax base.

1082
01:25:05,555 --> 01:25:16,697
[SPEAKER_24]: And we haven't taken advantage of accelerating our tax levy so that we can try to get in fighting distance of where inflation has put us as a community.

1083
01:25:18,092 --> 01:25:26,815
[SPEAKER_24]: And now we don't have the cash reserves that again are hypothetical at this point because we already know that we need them for capital expenses and we have to balance the budget for fiscal 26.

1084
01:25:27,715 --> 01:25:28,275
[SPEAKER_24]: What would I cut?

1085
01:25:28,295 --> 01:25:29,996
[SPEAKER_05]: 30 seconds.

1086
01:25:30,016 --> 01:25:30,676
[SPEAKER_24]: There's nothing to cut.

1087
01:25:31,176 --> 01:25:31,476
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1088
01:25:32,097 --> 01:25:32,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1089
01:25:34,237 --> 01:25:35,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else from the council want to go on this question?

1090
01:25:38,854 --> 01:25:43,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to Councilor Leming's point, there was the $34 million certified balance at the end of June.

1091
01:25:43,497 --> 01:25:46,158
[SPEAKER_04]: $6 million went to a stabilization fund.

1092
01:25:47,018 --> 01:25:49,400
[SPEAKER_04]: $5 million went to a capital stabilization fund.

1093
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:53,402
[SPEAKER_04]: $1 million of that has already been spent on emergency capital repairs.

1094
01:25:53,422 --> 01:25:56,764
[SPEAKER_04]: $3 million went to the MSBA feasibility study.

1095
01:25:57,364 --> 01:26:07,450
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor also outlined an additional $9.5 million, $2.5 million for fire department fleet replacements, $2 million for the pension liability, which we have to fund by 2034.

1096
01:26:09,008 --> 01:26:18,634
[SPEAKER_04]: $2 million per year for fiscal year 25 capital improvements, $2 million for fiscal year 26 capital improvements, $1 million to match federal and state money to renovate the Hegner Center.

1097
01:26:19,474 --> 01:26:29,720
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have the estimated $15 million that we heard the other week from Assistant Superintendent Cushing to fix the HVAC at the Andrews Middle School and McGlynn K-8 school.

1098
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:33,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan has noted the $67 million in road debt, $35 million in sidewalk debt,

1099
01:26:36,301 --> 01:26:40,124
[SPEAKER_04]: People have noted the school water issue.

1100
01:26:40,405 --> 01:26:45,729
[SPEAKER_04]: As Mr. Belson said, we made money on those schools, but apparently we did it because we didn't put the right stuff in for water.

1101
01:26:46,369 --> 01:26:52,774
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just spent all 35 million right there on things that are urgent, right there.

1102
01:26:53,275 --> 01:26:58,899
[SPEAKER_04]: We're still gonna have to prioritize these urgent capital needs with that free cash and stabilization fund money.

1103
01:26:59,039 --> 01:26:59,440
[SPEAKER_40]: There's 18.5 left.

1104
01:27:01,221 --> 01:27:04,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's plus there's the money in the stabilization funds.

1105
01:27:04,824 --> 01:27:06,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just went beyond that though.

1106
01:27:06,826 --> 01:27:07,967
[SPEAKER_40]: It's called scare tactics.

1107
01:27:08,027 --> 01:27:09,008
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a scare tactic.

1108
01:27:09,068 --> 01:27:09,728
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just math.

1109
01:27:10,989 --> 01:27:11,570
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just math.

1110
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:13,131
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the need of the community.

1111
01:27:13,271 --> 01:27:15,353
[SPEAKER_04]: I could not name you a community in the state.

1112
01:27:15,413 --> 01:27:16,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the math that the task force has?

1113
01:27:16,854 --> 01:27:18,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scavalli, please don't interrupt me.

1114
01:27:18,876 --> 01:27:19,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1115
01:27:19,316 --> 01:27:19,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't interrupt you.

1116
01:27:19,977 --> 01:27:20,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't interrupt me.

1117
01:27:21,158 --> 01:27:21,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1118
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:23,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the figures.

1119
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:24,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are our needs.

1120
01:27:26,442 --> 01:27:27,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the capital needs of the community.

1121
01:27:28,484 --> 01:27:29,965
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think,

1122
01:27:30,902 --> 01:27:31,883
[SPEAKER_04]: The math is pretty clear.

1123
01:27:34,384 --> 01:27:35,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to the podium for our next question.

1124
01:27:36,045 --> 01:27:38,106
[SPEAKER_04]: One minute, name and address for the record, please.

1125
01:27:39,927 --> 01:27:43,689
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening, Nick Giurleo, G-I-U-R-L-E-O, 40 Robinson Road.

1126
01:27:44,409 --> 01:27:55,375
[SPEAKER_21]: So on the subject of the math, my question relates to essentially, you know, these overrides and so-called consequences of not passing them, of not approving them.

1127
01:27:56,153 --> 01:28:01,474
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're hearing kind of these expressions of certainty described what will happen if the overrides don't pass.

1128
01:28:01,494 --> 01:28:04,054
[SPEAKER_21]: We've heard from Councilor Bears, there will be cuts.

1129
01:28:04,534 --> 01:28:07,555
[SPEAKER_21]: We've heard from Councilor Leming, the roads won't be repaired.

1130
01:28:07,875 --> 01:28:09,735
[SPEAKER_21]: So my question is, you know, where is this math?

1131
01:28:09,875 --> 01:28:21,317
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, where is, for the average citizen who's not a mathematician, you know, where are we going to see this data that shows that these consequences will actually result if these overrides don't pass?

1132
01:28:21,617 --> 01:28:23,818
[SPEAKER_21]: I've looked and I haven't really been able to find anything.

1133
01:28:23,878 --> 01:28:24,618
[SPEAKER_21]: So where do I go?

1134
01:28:28,393 --> 01:28:29,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone wanna go for that?

1135
01:28:29,433 --> 01:28:30,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins.

1136
01:28:30,994 --> 01:28:31,254
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1137
01:28:31,274 --> 01:28:48,719
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sure that my fellow councilors will add to this list, but just to reference some of the data points that have been coming up multiple times in this meeting in particular, I'd guide you to the pavement management plan that was put out by the DPW some years ago, and that's a few years out of date now, but it details the- It was actually updated last year.

1138
01:28:48,939 --> 01:28:49,699
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, nevermind.

1139
01:28:49,819 --> 01:28:50,499
[SPEAKER_24]: Updated last year.

1140
01:28:51,219 --> 01:28:54,040
[SPEAKER_24]: That details the $200 million in

1141
01:28:57,401 --> 01:28:58,902
[SPEAKER_24]: backlog of road repairs that are needed.

1142
01:29:00,123 --> 01:29:21,438
[SPEAKER_24]: For more detail on the needs in the schools, I would direct you to really any of the budget cycles, the recent budget cycles, school committee meetings, FY23 or FY24, which I think go into the level of detail that folks are really curious about when it comes to what is at stake, what actually does go on the chopping block each year, and that is brought back depending on ESSER funding, when that was available, or other one-time funds.

1143
01:29:22,429 --> 01:29:35,329
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think that the capital improvement plan is also a really interesting augment to those operating costs that show how much money really needs to be funded to on the infrastructural and maintenance side that we are really waiting to have the funding for.

1144
01:29:36,181 --> 01:29:38,562
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, but data on- We're not doing follow-ups.

1145
01:29:38,642 --> 01:29:39,682
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a clarification.

1146
01:29:39,742 --> 01:29:41,263
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a follow-up, thank you.

1147
01:29:41,443 --> 01:29:42,323
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the question?

1148
01:29:42,383 --> 01:29:43,104
[SPEAKER_21]: To her response.

1149
01:29:43,384 --> 01:29:45,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're not doing that, so I'd appreciate it.

1150
01:29:45,424 --> 01:29:45,625
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1151
01:29:45,865 --> 01:29:47,485
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just asking one question.

1152
01:29:47,585 --> 01:29:51,207
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, just clarifying her answer, because I'm not quite understanding.

1153
01:29:51,247 --> 01:29:52,687
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go, we'll think about it.

1154
01:29:53,347 --> 01:29:53,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's next?

1155
01:29:55,548 --> 01:29:56,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Leming.

1156
01:29:57,429 --> 01:29:58,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just trying to enforce the rules.

1157
01:30:00,250 --> 01:30:00,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me rephrase that.

1158
01:30:01,190 --> 01:30:01,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll think about it.

1159
01:30:02,111 --> 01:30:02,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Leming.

1160
01:30:05,444 --> 01:30:06,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we're giving the answers.

1161
01:30:07,205 --> 01:30:08,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Leming, thank you.

1162
01:30:08,745 --> 01:30:10,966
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Leming, thank you.

1163
01:30:12,126 --> 01:30:32,572
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd just like to really emphasize that if you're interested in learning more about the shortfalls in the school, in the Medford Public Schools budget, then the videos and the presentations that were given during the budget season at the Medford School Committee meetings, I believe around June, would be where you want to go.

1164
01:30:32,612 --> 01:30:33,492
[SPEAKER_13]: So those are on YouTube.

1165
01:30:33,752 --> 01:30:33,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1166
01:30:35,424 --> 01:30:36,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, anyone else wanna answer the question?

1167
01:30:37,005 --> 01:30:38,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, Mr. President, thank you.

1168
01:30:38,685 --> 01:30:43,187
[SPEAKER_40]: So again, Mr. Giglio, these are all scare tactics.

1169
01:30:43,667 --> 01:30:53,810
[SPEAKER_40]: Again, the financial task force didn't have the FOIA requests that shows that there were no documentations, no minutes, no information given.

1170
01:30:53,850 --> 01:31:01,613
[SPEAKER_40]: We heard the assessor, we know all the major parties, the school department, the assessor, the finance director, weren't involved in these issues.

1171
01:31:02,333 --> 01:31:04,074
[SPEAKER_40]: This is, it's not a lie.

1172
01:31:04,594 --> 01:31:05,834
[SPEAKER_40]: We just said it, you heard it.

1173
01:31:06,314 --> 01:31:08,295
[SPEAKER_40]: Put 30 seconds back on for interrupting me.

1174
01:31:08,735 --> 01:31:13,817
[SPEAKER_40]: We have the understanding that the sky is falling.

1175
01:31:14,177 --> 01:31:16,858
[SPEAKER_40]: All of these projects that we need to fix, we need to fund.

1176
01:31:17,498 --> 01:31:20,679
[SPEAKER_40]: In normal communities, what we do is we bond these projects.

1177
01:31:21,079 --> 01:31:24,921
[SPEAKER_40]: When we look at situations that we talked about earlier, when it's,

1178
01:31:26,181 --> 01:31:32,455
[SPEAKER_40]: What we're trying, what we're seeing here right now, Mr. Joyo, it's the underfunding of local revenues.

1179
01:31:36,209 --> 01:31:42,333
[SPEAKER_40]: One second, I'll just, it's the focus of what we're seeing that our community has done for years here.

1180
01:31:42,673 --> 01:31:47,677
[SPEAKER_40]: And that's show lower meals tax and hotel tax and excise tax.

1181
01:31:47,997 --> 01:31:50,939
[SPEAKER_40]: So then when it comes higher, you can put that and use it for whatever you want.

1182
01:31:51,279 --> 01:31:55,462
[SPEAKER_40]: Let that be known, the understanding what you're asking for, there are no numbers.

1183
01:31:55,542 --> 01:32:03,147
[SPEAKER_40]: The problem we hear right now, why the city's divided, why our seniors are scared, why our landlords are scared, why our homeowners and renters are afraid right now,

1184
01:32:03,607 --> 01:32:08,933
[SPEAKER_40]: Why our students and parents and teachers are afraid is because this group did something.

1185
01:32:09,193 --> 01:32:11,435
[SPEAKER_40]: They put it out there without any true information.

1186
01:32:11,956 --> 01:32:13,277
[SPEAKER_40]: So we don't know what's going on.

1187
01:32:13,337 --> 01:32:14,438
[SPEAKER_40]: We haven't been educated.

1188
01:32:14,699 --> 01:32:15,960
[SPEAKER_40]: That's why there's so much fear.

1189
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:24,409
[SPEAKER_40]: The firefighters aren't supporting a $30 million fire station, because again, there was no transparency there when it came to the final decision that had to be made for 30.

1190
01:32:24,449 --> 01:32:25,870
[SPEAKER_40]: And they've decided to go public.

1191
01:32:26,471 --> 01:32:33,616
[SPEAKER_40]: They decided to go public to say, let's not hurt our taxpayers with whatever, how many it's going to be, because we don't know.

1192
01:32:33,656 --> 01:32:35,338
[SPEAKER_40]: It could be a $50 million fire station.

1193
01:32:35,758 --> 01:32:39,581
[SPEAKER_40]: But the design was never put forth to the firefighters.

1194
01:32:39,601 --> 01:32:44,244
[SPEAKER_40]: So when you say totality, six, seven, and eight, we haven't been involved, Mr. Gileo.

1195
01:32:44,445 --> 01:32:45,425
[SPEAKER_40]: There are no numbers.

1196
01:32:45,465 --> 01:32:46,526
[SPEAKER_40]: There is no information.

1197
01:32:46,826 --> 01:32:53,532
[SPEAKER_40]: Because this group did it in the financial task force that presented it on a Thursday, voted on it on a Tuesday, and then

1198
01:32:54,352 --> 01:32:59,336
[SPEAKER_40]: We find $9 million in free cash after that, that the man knew was certified.

1199
01:32:59,356 --> 01:32:59,577
[SPEAKER_04]: 30 seconds?

1200
01:32:59,777 --> 01:33:00,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1201
01:33:01,078 --> 01:33:01,378
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it?

1202
01:33:01,738 --> 01:33:02,859
[SPEAKER_04]: You're over by 20 seconds.

1203
01:33:03,059 --> 01:33:04,300
[SPEAKER_40]: Oh, can I say one more thing?

1204
01:33:04,841 --> 01:33:05,061
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1205
01:33:07,723 --> 01:33:09,285
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll get it on the next round, I'm sure.

1206
01:33:09,525 --> 01:33:10,606
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you'll get it on the next round.

1207
01:33:10,626 --> 01:33:11,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.

1208
01:33:11,867 --> 01:33:13,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else want to comment here from the council?

1209
01:33:13,928 --> 01:33:15,510
[SPEAKER_04]: You already went, Vice President Collins, sorry.

1210
01:33:17,912 --> 01:33:19,994
[SPEAKER_04]: No one gets mad when I don't let Councilor Collins talk.

1211
01:33:22,261 --> 01:33:23,861
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just trying to enforce the rules here.

1212
01:33:23,881 --> 01:33:29,002
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a quick clarification on the kind of data you're asking for, I'd be interested to hear it.

1213
01:33:29,182 --> 01:33:44,585
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just, the clarification I'm requesting here is, are we saying that various reports and data showing that there are certain needs are the same thing as saying that if we don't pass this overrides, that this X or Y will happen?

1214
01:33:44,765 --> 01:33:46,126
[SPEAKER_21]: Are those two exactly equivalent?

1215
01:33:46,146 --> 01:33:47,826
[SPEAKER_21]: They don't seem exactly equivalent to me.

1216
01:33:48,527 --> 01:33:51,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I can answer that and I'll put my clock on.

1217
01:33:52,850 --> 01:33:56,872
[SPEAKER_04]: So for much of it, for the school budget, yes.

1218
01:33:57,432 --> 01:34:04,696
[SPEAKER_04]: The school budget director outlined in the budget meetings in April and May and June, this is what would be cut if we didn't have these funds.

1219
01:34:05,157 --> 01:34:07,558
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what would have to be cut if we don't have these funds in the future.

1220
01:34:07,858 --> 01:34:09,719
[SPEAKER_04]: So in that case, it is an exact one-to-one.

1221
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:12,121
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's true for all of question seven.

1222
01:34:12,661 --> 01:34:16,003
[SPEAKER_04]: When we talk about the DPW, the director said,

1223
01:34:16,704 --> 01:34:23,088
[SPEAKER_04]: to run the machines four days a week instead of two or four days a month, I need this much staff, this is how much that crew would cost.

1224
01:34:24,249 --> 01:34:24,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

1225
01:34:25,330 --> 01:34:41,060
[SPEAKER_04]: For the debt exclusion for the fire station, Councilor Scarpelli already noted, right, we have bond capacity, we're maxed on our bond capacity, we have a library on the bond capacity, we have a police station on the bond capacity, we have school, MHS labs on the bond capacity, we're pretty much maxed on the bond capacity here.

1226
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:44,963
[SPEAKER_04]: And, okay, well,

1227
01:34:45,903 --> 01:34:48,685
[SPEAKER_40]: We wouldn't know that because it's literally in the budget.

1228
01:34:48,785 --> 01:34:49,565
[SPEAKER_04]: You're wrong.

1229
01:34:49,605 --> 01:34:50,326
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in the budget.

1230
01:34:50,546 --> 01:34:51,046
[SPEAKER_04]: You're wrong.

1231
01:34:51,066 --> 01:34:51,747
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not wrong.

1232
01:34:51,767 --> 01:34:52,587
[SPEAKER_04]: I read the thing.

1233
01:34:54,088 --> 01:35:05,175
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we talk about the information that's available to the public, there's information from the school budget process, from the city budget process that outlines these needs very clearly.

1234
01:35:05,695 --> 01:35:10,198
[SPEAKER_04]: There have been charts and tables and narratives and

1235
01:35:11,098 --> 01:35:14,684
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever other form of data analysis you want has likely been presented at these meetings.

1236
01:35:14,824 --> 01:35:25,442
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is information out there, there is data out there, and when we talk about the decisions made by the financial task force, while other members of the city staff were not members of the financial task force,

1237
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:29,664
[SPEAKER_04]: they were consulted, these issues were discussed with them.

1238
01:35:29,925 --> 01:35:32,968
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is what it is.

1239
01:35:33,389 --> 01:35:36,893
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can continue to try to present the math and information in a different way.

1240
01:35:36,913 --> 01:35:41,678
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure that we will continue to try to get that information out there as best as possible.

1241
01:35:41,738 --> 01:35:46,464
[SPEAKER_04]: But the city has incredible needs, significant needs, and funding is needed to meet them.

1242
01:35:49,923 --> 01:35:50,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1243
01:35:50,343 --> 01:35:54,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I only have one hand raised on Zoom, but it's iPhone 109.

1244
01:35:55,049 --> 01:36:00,315
[SPEAKER_04]: If you would please rename yourself so that we know that you're a person, I'll then recognize you.

1245
01:36:00,936 --> 01:36:02,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Until then, I'll go to the podium.

1246
01:36:02,257 --> 01:36:03,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

1247
01:36:03,458 --> 01:36:05,000
[SPEAKER_04]: You have one minute for your questions.

1248
01:36:05,461 --> 01:36:07,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Ron Giovino, 326 East Border Road.

1249
01:36:07,823 --> 01:36:09,866
[SPEAKER_10]: My question has to do with the financial task force.

1250
01:36:11,038 --> 01:36:23,185
[SPEAKER_10]: As a proud member of both the Columbus Renaming Committee and the newly ending Charter Committee, we had rules of agenda reporting, minute reporting, public participation.

1251
01:36:23,205 --> 01:36:27,008
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like somebody to answer the question, what makes this task force exempt from that?

1252
01:36:27,668 --> 01:36:33,653
[SPEAKER_10]: And my final comment is nobody in this room thinks the school system or the city services are fully funded.

1253
01:36:33,994 --> 01:36:35,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Trust me, nobody does.

1254
01:36:35,435 --> 01:36:49,328
[SPEAKER_10]: The question we have in front of us is, is this the Band-Aid that is gonna get us through until the next time we convene for the next two and a half proposal or the ominous 200 million plus renovation of the school?

1255
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:50,589
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what we're voting on today.

1256
01:36:50,989 --> 01:36:51,770
[SPEAKER_10]: Appreciate your answers.

1257
01:36:52,030 --> 01:36:52,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1258
01:36:55,478 --> 01:36:56,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone wanna go for it?

1259
01:36:57,539 --> 01:36:58,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do the financial task force part.

1260
01:37:00,601 --> 01:37:04,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone wanna talk about the sufficiency of the size of the override?

1261
01:37:06,545 --> 01:37:07,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Leming, two minutes.

1262
01:37:08,308 --> 01:37:26,558
[SPEAKER_13]: So for the size of the override, what I'll say is that we got, we went 44 years without an override, and this is the first time that we're asking the voters to do an override, which has become very commonplace in other communities.

1263
01:37:26,658 --> 01:37:31,980
[SPEAKER_13]: And so, yeah, if we, you know, there potentially is,

1264
01:37:33,301 --> 01:37:49,733
[SPEAKER_13]: a debt exclusion in the future for the high school as a capital project, but just in terms of level expenses, the overrides are a mechanism to undo, to overcome the effects of inflation long-term.

1265
01:37:49,773 --> 01:37:56,037
[SPEAKER_13]: So I will just point out that we've gone this long without an override, and this is the first time that we're asking for it.

1266
01:37:57,867 --> 01:38:00,208
[SPEAKER_13]: We've survived pretty long so far.

1267
01:38:01,669 --> 01:38:04,951
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're pretty late to the game, to be honest.

1268
01:38:06,753 --> 01:38:09,854
[SPEAKER_13]: Will another override be needed in another 44 years?

1269
01:38:10,635 --> 01:38:13,357
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe, because inflation will keep going up.

1270
01:38:14,017 --> 01:38:23,563
[SPEAKER_13]: But right now, we know that we need this, or else, again, the roads will continue to be in the state that they're in, and we will have to have

1271
01:38:24,376 --> 01:38:25,157
[SPEAKER_13]: a lot of layoffs.

1272
01:38:25,357 --> 01:38:26,417
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not a scare tactic.

1273
01:38:26,457 --> 01:38:27,778
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just the truth.

1274
01:38:27,798 --> 01:38:28,438
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just math.

1275
01:38:28,739 --> 01:38:29,779
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

1276
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:32,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1277
01:38:34,181 --> 01:38:36,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazzaro, two minutes.

1278
01:38:37,923 --> 01:38:46,568
[SPEAKER_29]: We are, I would paraphrase Councilor Leming and say that we aren't all even asking for an override.

1279
01:38:46,588 --> 01:38:49,129
[SPEAKER_29]: We are giving the voters of Medford the opportunity to

1280
01:38:51,724 --> 01:38:53,306
[SPEAKER_29]: raise their own taxes if they would like.

1281
01:38:54,027 --> 01:38:54,688
[SPEAKER_29]: You can vote now.

1282
01:38:54,988 --> 01:38:55,569
[SPEAKER_29]: You're allowed to.

1283
01:38:55,589 --> 01:38:56,210
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1284
01:38:56,630 --> 01:39:00,335
[SPEAKER_29]: We're here to answer questions about it.

1285
01:39:01,457 --> 01:39:03,198
[SPEAKER_29]: not to convince anybody to do anything.

1286
01:39:03,358 --> 01:39:08,882
[SPEAKER_29]: We're just telling you what we know and what we have the luxury of knowing from having this job.

1287
01:39:10,624 --> 01:39:29,379
[SPEAKER_29]: Another thing I will say is that historic underfunding has led to, and having never passed an override before, has led to such scenarios as me receiving an email that there is lead in the water at the Brooks Elementary School where my kids go because of fixtures

1288
01:39:30,129 --> 01:39:37,935
[SPEAKER_29]: in the building in a school that was built after the year 2000 because corners were cut because money was tried.

1289
01:39:38,315 --> 01:39:40,617
[SPEAKER_29]: They were trying to save money when they built the schools.

1290
01:39:40,677 --> 01:39:44,020
[SPEAKER_29]: That's what happens when you don't fund your city.

1291
01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:46,722
[SPEAKER_29]: So we can keep trying to do that.

1292
01:39:47,022 --> 01:39:49,584
[SPEAKER_29]: We can keep trying to not fund our city.

1293
01:39:50,168 --> 01:39:52,249
[SPEAKER_29]: That's a choice that the voters have.

1294
01:39:52,949 --> 01:39:54,710
[SPEAKER_29]: And everybody, that's democracy.

1295
01:39:55,251 --> 01:39:57,192
[SPEAKER_29]: So we all have the opportunity.

1296
01:39:57,292 --> 01:39:58,452
[SPEAKER_29]: Everybody has the opportunity.

1297
01:39:58,872 --> 01:40:00,393
[SPEAKER_29]: So we're here to answer your questions.

1298
01:40:00,433 --> 01:40:08,817
[SPEAKER_29]: We're not trying to say you're good or you're bad or you're doing whatever, but I really hope, I hope that we are making decisions.

1299
01:40:11,439 --> 01:40:18,862
[SPEAKER_29]: They might be hard decisions, but we're making decisions that are taking care of each other, that are prioritizing the people that we care about.

1300
01:40:21,184 --> 01:40:23,845
[SPEAKER_29]: understanding the fiscal responsibility that we have towards each other.

1301
01:40:24,965 --> 01:40:25,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1302
01:40:25,685 --> 01:40:26,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else want to go on this?

1303
01:40:27,786 --> 01:40:28,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli, anyone else?

1304
01:40:29,307 --> 01:40:30,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli, two minutes.

1305
01:40:37,009 --> 01:40:38,690
[SPEAKER_40]: With the fair tactics, right?

1306
01:40:38,790 --> 01:40:40,590
[SPEAKER_40]: It's the schools, right?

1307
01:40:41,330 --> 01:40:43,811
[SPEAKER_40]: It's Councilor Leming said it over and over again.

1308
01:40:44,391 --> 01:40:46,632
[SPEAKER_40]: Well, we haven't done it, so let's do it, right?

1309
01:40:47,392 --> 01:40:48,893
[SPEAKER_40]: Just because we haven't done it, let's do it.

1310
01:40:49,813 --> 01:40:53,437
[SPEAKER_40]: Now the roads, now we hear the schools were built bad.

1311
01:40:54,017 --> 01:40:55,619
[SPEAKER_40]: So it's all fair, this is all fair.

1312
01:40:56,400 --> 01:41:03,587
[SPEAKER_40]: But here's the thing, we're not saying that, let's not look at this properly and do it together.

1313
01:41:04,068 --> 01:41:04,969
[SPEAKER_40]: This is the problem.

1314
01:41:05,329 --> 01:41:07,011
[SPEAKER_40]: We're doing it in a bubble.

1315
01:41:07,051 --> 01:41:08,452
[SPEAKER_40]: We're doing it so privately.

1316
01:41:08,753 --> 01:41:11,515
[SPEAKER_40]: We're doing it where it's gonna hurt so many people.

1317
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:21,501
[SPEAKER_40]: You know, the finger-pointing between teachers and finger-pointing between seniors and kids, and it's a shame what you're doing.

1318
01:41:22,361 --> 01:41:25,061
[SPEAKER_40]: We can correct this right now with the free cash.

1319
01:41:25,081 --> 01:41:32,282
[SPEAKER_40]: No matter what they say, the truth of the matter is we have free cash to make sure that seven and eight are correctable.

1320
01:41:32,742 --> 01:41:41,104
[SPEAKER_40]: We know question six is correctable by listening to our firefighters, who will tell you straightforward that the mayor's not telling the truth.

1321
01:41:42,385 --> 01:41:47,772
[SPEAKER_40]: What they're building there is insufficient, and it's going to put us 30 years behind in five years.

1322
01:41:48,693 --> 01:41:54,361
[SPEAKER_40]: So please understand this, Mr. Gervino, when you say all this information and how it gets out, we haven't done that.

1323
01:41:54,841 --> 01:41:57,004
[SPEAKER_40]: Even though councils want to say we did, we haven't.

1324
01:41:57,645 --> 01:42:02,187
[SPEAKER_40]: We haven't prepared our seniors for what's going to happen on January 1st of 2025.

1325
01:42:02,607 --> 01:42:05,969
[SPEAKER_40]: Once the new assessment, once the new tax bills come out, we haven't done that.

1326
01:42:06,289 --> 01:42:12,672
[SPEAKER_40]: We haven't prepared up our, our, our landlords to how they're going to handle single parent, uh, renters in their home.

1327
01:42:12,972 --> 01:42:15,614
[SPEAKER_40]: We haven't prepared our renters when increase goes up.

1328
01:42:15,654 --> 01:42:16,354
[SPEAKER_40]: And here's another one.

1329
01:42:16,894 --> 01:42:20,116
[SPEAKER_40]: Somebody called me when I put a post out about a woman that called me.

1330
01:42:20,856 --> 01:42:26,982
[SPEAKER_40]: She has two children, and the landlord said, I'm not going to hit you with the assessment raise, but I'm going to be honest with you.

1331
01:42:27,323 --> 01:42:30,706
[SPEAKER_40]: I got to tell you, I'm going to have to raise your rent.

1332
01:42:31,467 --> 01:42:34,330
[SPEAKER_40]: And someone asked me, well, are you going to support rent control?

1333
01:42:34,550 --> 01:42:36,372
[SPEAKER_40]: Well, there's another wrong that doesn't make a right.

1334
01:42:37,413 --> 01:42:43,679
[SPEAKER_40]: Again, there's a system in place with this group that's telling you what you should do out of fear.

1335
01:42:43,759 --> 01:42:47,362
[SPEAKER_40]: So please, again, we have the funds to fix it.

1336
01:42:47,402 --> 01:42:52,306
[SPEAKER_40]: No matter what they're saying, it's absolutely above board to do that.

1337
01:42:52,527 --> 01:42:57,471
[SPEAKER_40]: I understand it was done with mismanagement throughout the process.

1338
01:42:57,491 --> 01:42:58,352
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1339
01:43:08,220 --> 01:43:09,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, one second.

1340
01:43:09,121 --> 01:43:10,963
[SPEAKER_04]: We're still answering the question from Mr. Givino.

1341
01:43:12,625 --> 01:43:17,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw Councilor Saint and Councilor Collins, and I have an answer about the financial task force.

1342
01:43:17,770 --> 01:43:18,932
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be very brief.

1343
01:43:19,492 --> 01:43:26,280
[SPEAKER_11]: There's been only one Councilor here tonight that's asked the voters in the room to vote a certain way, and it's not me.

1344
01:43:27,401 --> 01:43:28,942
[SPEAKER_11]: not a certain number of other Councilors.

1345
01:43:29,002 --> 01:43:31,344
[SPEAKER_11]: So I did say that we approve these because we saw that voting.

1346
01:43:31,364 --> 01:43:31,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1347
01:43:31,544 --> 01:43:33,326
[SPEAKER_11]: So two Councilors, but pay attention.

1348
01:43:47,634 --> 01:43:48,454
[SPEAKER_11]: I am paying attention.

1349
01:43:48,895 --> 01:43:50,676
[SPEAKER_11]: You didn't read the budget, but anyways.

1350
01:43:50,876 --> 01:43:52,957
[SPEAKER_11]: It's embarrassing, man.

1351
01:43:53,537 --> 01:43:55,958
[SPEAKER_11]: I apologize for letting this get off the track.

1352
01:43:56,018 --> 01:43:59,140
[SPEAKER_11]: The question was about, I think- It's not your fault.

1353
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:08,185
[SPEAKER_11]: There was one aspect of the question about the new growth and coming back to ask, the voters to ask for another override.

1354
01:44:08,305 --> 01:44:13,568
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe the financial task force has been pretty open in saying that we believe that with new growth coming in,

1355
01:44:14,644 --> 01:44:26,557
[SPEAKER_11]: in talking to the developers who are looking to develop on the properties that we're rezoning for and looking at the projects that are coming into our city, we believe that we won't need to ask for another override until that exclusion for that school.

1356
01:44:27,337 --> 01:44:37,288
[SPEAKER_11]: That's something that we, you know, are very open in conversations that we have with our planning department staff, with our assessing staff here in the city council chambers and in their offices as well.

1357
01:44:38,429 --> 01:44:47,094
[SPEAKER_11]: And to the point of us, the fear tactic of us coming back next year, right?

1358
01:44:47,594 --> 01:45:00,281
[SPEAKER_11]: There is one opportunity offered tonight where we do come back next year, and that's kicking the can down the road by using free cash this year, which would guarantee that we come back to this exact same position next year as well.

1359
01:45:01,662 --> 01:45:02,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1360
01:45:02,543 --> 01:45:04,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I got it on the task force.

1361
01:45:06,869 --> 01:45:08,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks Mr. Gimeno for the question.

1362
01:45:09,791 --> 01:45:23,539
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we talk about sufficiency of the override, in the public documents that have been repeatedly asserted don't exist, but are of course public and on the website, the financial task force has said that we believe that this override and debt exclusion is sufficient.

1363
01:45:24,727 --> 01:45:39,130
[SPEAKER_04]: along with whatever needs to be done for the high school, which we all knew always was going to be an independent question to allow the city's planning and development work based on the comprehensive plan and the zoning recodification and ongoing zoning work to take effect to begin to raise the funds.

1364
01:45:39,210 --> 01:45:47,611
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, right now in the public documents that have been released, I think both the March document and the June document talk about that question.

1365
01:45:47,671 --> 01:45:51,032
[SPEAKER_04]: We believe that not only is this the best path forward for the city's financial health,

1366
01:45:51,412 --> 01:45:59,882
[SPEAKER_04]: but that the amounts are sufficient that we would not be coming back in the next five to 10 years outside of a Medford High School question to address the city's financial health and challenges.

1367
01:46:00,463 --> 01:46:08,913
[SPEAKER_04]: When it comes to the Financial Task Force question, Financial Task Force was not a public body, did not include, for example, members of the public, appointed citizens, etc.

1368
01:46:09,033 --> 01:46:11,456
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an internal body to City Hall.

1369
01:46:12,034 --> 01:46:20,059
[SPEAKER_04]: similar to project meetings in different departments, interdepartmental groups designed for different projects.

1370
01:46:20,079 --> 01:46:25,562
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is why it was held internally and not in publicly posted meetings and public meetings.

1371
01:46:29,024 --> 01:46:30,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna go to Zoom.

1372
01:46:31,145 --> 01:46:35,087
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Deanne I. You have one minute for a question.

1373
01:46:35,107 --> 01:46:36,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

1374
01:46:38,369 --> 01:46:39,730
[SPEAKER_23]: Deanne Androsano, 23 Emerald Street.

1375
01:46:42,086 --> 01:46:50,247
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, my question is, if these overrides pass, where does this money go into?

1376
01:46:50,707 --> 01:46:55,188
[SPEAKER_23]: Does it go into the general fund, then to be dispersed?

1377
01:46:55,748 --> 01:46:56,649
[SPEAKER_23]: How does that work?

1378
01:46:57,829 --> 01:47:04,230
[SPEAKER_23]: And the other thing is Council Callahan, there is 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts, not 451.

1379
01:47:04,270 --> 01:47:04,410
[SPEAKER_23]: Wow.

1380
01:47:04,490 --> 01:47:05,150
[SPEAKER_23]: Sounds like, um,

1381
01:47:11,638 --> 01:47:15,781
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you said 451, but it sounds like you got the 51 right, so it may have been a misspeak.

1382
01:47:17,822 --> 01:47:21,065
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you so much for your correction, because I do know it's 351.

1383
01:47:21,105 --> 01:47:24,567
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm surprised that I said that, but thank you so much.

1384
01:47:24,727 --> 01:47:26,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sometimes we just have a little misspeak.

1385
01:47:29,671 --> 01:47:31,692
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyone wanna answer those questions?

1386
01:47:33,133 --> 01:47:35,915
[SPEAKER_04]: I can get money where the money goes, but if anyone else wants to go for it.

1387
01:47:39,281 --> 01:47:56,794
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, in terms of where the money goes, $3 million from Question 7 goes to Medford Public Schools to replace $1.7 million in one-time funds that were used for Fiscal 25 to cover positions to address the inclusion of federally funded

1388
01:47:57,174 --> 01:48:15,192
[SPEAKER_04]: pandemic aid positions and to address maintenance costs, $500,000 would go to DDPW to hire staff to have a permanent in-house road and sidewalk repair crew, and $4 million would go to the school to address a number of issues, mainly collectively bargained issues around pay for

1389
01:48:15,852 --> 01:48:28,861
[SPEAKER_04]: teachers, paraprofessionals, staff, addressing the issue of the school day, and potentially also addressing issues such as coaches, stipends, and transportation, depending on what is prioritized during the next budget process.

1390
01:48:29,502 --> 01:48:33,465
[SPEAKER_04]: And for question six, that is dedicated to a new fire station.

1391
01:48:34,986 --> 01:48:35,806
[SPEAKER_40]: If I can, Mr. President.

1392
01:48:35,846 --> 01:48:37,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go to Councilor Scarpa and then Councilor Callahan.

1393
01:48:38,048 --> 01:48:38,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Two minutes.

1394
01:48:44,833 --> 01:48:45,934
[SPEAKER_40]: It goes into general fund.

1395
01:48:47,275 --> 01:48:47,916
[SPEAKER_40]: That's the answer.

1396
01:48:48,036 --> 01:48:49,257
[SPEAKER_40]: It goes into general fund.

1397
01:48:49,697 --> 01:48:58,825
[SPEAKER_40]: And by law, you're supposed to take the letter of what the questions are and use those funding as closely as you can to that.

1398
01:48:58,905 --> 01:49:02,248
[SPEAKER_40]: But the questions as they're read are very vague.

1399
01:49:02,988 --> 01:49:05,770
[SPEAKER_40]: So it really doesn't mean it's gonna go directly to that.

1400
01:49:06,551 --> 01:49:07,952
[SPEAKER_40]: It could be portions of that or not.

1401
01:49:08,632 --> 01:49:19,717
[SPEAKER_40]: Again, I'll bring us back to the budget meeting when school committee member Jenny Graham was asked a question, if we were given $5 million, would everybody go back to those positions?

1402
01:49:19,837 --> 01:49:20,958
[SPEAKER_40]: And the answer was yes.

1403
01:49:21,578 --> 01:49:30,382
[SPEAKER_40]: The next evening, the school's financial director and the school superintendent, when I asked that question from the evening before, she said, absolutely not.

1404
01:49:31,023 --> 01:49:35,885
[SPEAKER_40]: The money would go back into their fund and they would distribute it to what they think is best for them.

1405
01:49:37,335 --> 01:49:39,837
[SPEAKER_40]: So it's a little, it's not true.

1406
01:49:40,277 --> 01:49:40,998
[SPEAKER_40]: And I'll give you an example.

1407
01:49:41,018 --> 01:49:42,659
[SPEAKER_40]: We talk about all these different cuts.

1408
01:49:43,239 --> 01:49:48,083
[SPEAKER_40]: We haven't filled, I believe now 29 teachers in the Medford public schools.

1409
01:49:49,124 --> 01:49:51,025
[SPEAKER_40]: That's funding we haven't, we paid for.

1410
01:49:51,566 --> 01:49:56,449
[SPEAKER_40]: We have so many dire issues, so many, the fiscal crisis we've been hearing.

1411
01:49:57,150 --> 01:50:03,555
[SPEAKER_40]: But at the same breath, we're asking to bring in shiny new programs that are new, that are costing the school department $200,000.

1412
01:50:06,872 --> 01:50:12,754
[SPEAKER_40]: We're talking about a city council that during this financial crisis talked about, did what?

1413
01:50:12,974 --> 01:50:16,015
[SPEAKER_40]: We found $9 million of free cash when they looked at the override.

1414
01:50:16,035 --> 01:50:16,776
[SPEAKER_40]: And then what happened?

1415
01:50:17,656 --> 01:50:19,157
[SPEAKER_40]: They voted themselves a raise.

1416
01:50:19,837 --> 01:50:22,498
[SPEAKER_40]: So the SIKU committee now goes from $10,000 to $12,000 up to $22,000, $24,000.

1417
01:50:26,194 --> 01:50:29,615
[SPEAKER_40]: The mayor gets an increase three times, three different ways.

1418
01:50:30,436 --> 01:50:38,258
[SPEAKER_40]: So again, I implore all of you who are open-minded thinkers, are you sure we're in a fiscal crisis or are we in a problem with this fiscal mismanagement?

1419
01:50:38,558 --> 01:50:39,859
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I ask all of you.

1420
01:50:39,999 --> 01:50:40,739
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

1421
01:50:40,959 --> 01:50:41,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate it.

1422
01:50:43,482 --> 01:50:48,744
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I just wanted to speak to the question, which is, where is the money going to go?

1423
01:50:48,825 --> 01:50:57,288
[SPEAKER_26]: So my understanding is that in that first year is when that strong encouragement to spend it on what was mentioned in the- It's a legal requirement.

1424
01:50:57,368 --> 01:50:58,189
[SPEAKER_26]: A legal requirement.

1425
01:50:58,209 --> 01:50:58,769
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much.

1426
01:50:59,069 --> 01:51:03,011
[SPEAKER_26]: A legal requirement to spend it on what was talked about in the ballot question.

1427
01:51:03,451 --> 01:51:07,773
[SPEAKER_26]: But what happens over time, because Prop 2.5 overrides

1428
01:51:10,282 --> 01:51:11,042
[SPEAKER_26]: don't end, right?

1429
01:51:11,082 --> 01:51:17,606
[SPEAKER_26]: They sort of just mean that the total amount of the budget is increased and that will continue.

1430
01:51:17,626 --> 01:51:19,547
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a sustainable source of revenue.

1431
01:51:19,567 --> 01:51:21,027
[SPEAKER_26]: It is a sustainable source of revenue.

1432
01:51:21,688 --> 01:51:35,674
[SPEAKER_26]: And what that means is that over time, there may be, you know, like 10 years later, 15, 20, 30 years later, it may be that that budget needs, you know, the city council should be able to spend that budget in the way that makes the most sense.

1433
01:51:36,655 --> 01:51:38,296
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's the reason why

1434
01:51:39,036 --> 01:51:43,257
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a legal requirement at the beginning, but it does go into the general fund, right?

1435
01:51:45,377 --> 01:51:51,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, specifically it would be appropriated if they were passed, there would be an appropriation in the first year.

1436
01:51:51,798 --> 01:51:59,880
[SPEAKER_04]: The appropriation would be as outlined in the ballot questions in future years, budgets would have to be cut in order to reappropriate those funds.

1437
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:05,861
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, and I don't think anyone behind this rail has ever supported cutting teachers or the school budget.

1438
01:52:06,701 --> 01:52:07,301
[SPEAKER_39]: That's what happened.

1439
01:52:10,655 --> 01:52:11,939
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to the podium.

1440
01:52:11,959 --> 01:52:13,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

1441
01:52:13,043 --> 01:52:14,869
[SPEAKER_04]: You have one minute to ask your question.

1442
01:52:15,738 --> 01:52:19,659
[SPEAKER_34]: Joan Consolmagno, 55 Gaston Street here in Medford.

1443
01:52:20,319 --> 01:52:36,284
[SPEAKER_34]: According to the general laws of Massachusetts in regards to Proposition 2 1⁄2, debt exclusions and overrides enable the community either to permanently increase its levy limit or temporarily levy above its levy limit or levy ceiling.

1444
01:52:36,784 --> 01:52:41,025
[SPEAKER_34]: The two key words here are permanently or temporarily.

1445
01:52:42,242 --> 01:52:55,631
[SPEAKER_34]: On question six, we have a non-contingent appropriation, this is for the fire headquarters, of $2 million per year in overrides with a bond of $30 million.

1446
01:52:55,831 --> 01:53:02,056
[SPEAKER_34]: On questions seven and eight, my question is this.

1447
01:53:03,183 --> 01:53:06,644
[SPEAKER_34]: Question six has a bond capacity of $30 million.

1448
01:53:07,524 --> 01:53:20,726
[SPEAKER_34]: But on everything that I have read, questions seven and eight have the contingency appropriation for question seven, I believe it's three and a half million per year override.

1449
01:53:21,287 --> 01:53:25,207
[SPEAKER_34]: And for question eight, $4 million per year override.

1450
01:53:25,768 --> 01:53:26,428
[SPEAKER_34]: But there is no,

1451
01:53:28,928 --> 01:53:32,490
[SPEAKER_34]: contingent appropriation for those two questions, seven and eight.

1452
01:53:33,410 --> 01:53:36,372
[SPEAKER_34]: Is there a bond capacity for those two questions?

1453
01:53:37,112 --> 01:53:47,457
[SPEAKER_34]: And will there be a graphics or database detailing these overrides, much like Councilman Beers just presented?

1454
01:53:48,057 --> 01:53:53,063
[SPEAKER_34]: like the $3 million for the Medford Public Schools, $500,000 for DPW, et cetera.

1455
01:53:53,083 --> 01:53:59,930
[SPEAKER_34]: So we know the line items and how they're being distributed throughout the community.

1456
01:54:01,314 --> 01:54:02,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the question.

1457
01:54:03,415 --> 01:54:07,437
[SPEAKER_04]: I can go to other folks, but I do have the answer, I think.

1458
01:54:07,537 --> 01:54:13,020
[SPEAKER_04]: So in terms of the temporary versus permanent, question six is a debt exclusion.

1459
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:17,903
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's temporary in the sense that there's the $30 million amount for the bond.

1460
01:54:18,783 --> 01:54:23,226
[SPEAKER_04]: The $2 billion that you cited is an estimate for the annual debt service cost.

1461
01:54:23,686 --> 01:54:30,390
[SPEAKER_04]: That estimate was created to try to give folks an understanding of what that might look like on an annual basis on their tax impact.

1462
01:54:31,751 --> 01:54:34,033
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a temporary until the bond is paid off.

1463
01:54:34,574 --> 01:54:39,879
[SPEAKER_04]: For question seven and eight, those would be permanent.

1464
01:54:39,899 --> 01:54:45,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are overrides intended to be permanent increases to the levy limit to fund ongoing operations.

1465
01:54:46,686 --> 01:54:54,313
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of the line items, I believe there is a page on the city website right now that does outline the specifics that I just said in terms of the

1466
01:54:55,413 --> 01:55:01,959
[SPEAKER_04]: 3 million for the MPS and 500,000 for the DPW in question seven and the 4 million in question eight.

1467
01:55:03,540 --> 01:55:20,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I can look at seeing if the city might be able to also add a graphic there, but I believe if you go to medfordma.org, there's a button right on the front page that says override information, and it does outline the line items for each specific question to the greatest extent possible.

1468
01:55:21,892 --> 01:55:23,552
[SPEAKER_34]: May I just ask another question?

1469
01:55:23,572 --> 01:55:24,993
[SPEAKER_34]: Okay.

1470
01:55:25,893 --> 01:55:27,033
[SPEAKER_34]: You said levy limits.

1471
01:55:28,333 --> 01:55:32,214
[SPEAKER_34]: We don't know what the levy limits would be on question seven and eight as yet.

1472
01:55:33,074 --> 01:55:37,475
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do, it would be 3.5 million for question seven and 4 million for question eight.

1473
01:55:37,495 --> 01:55:38,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

1474
01:55:38,455 --> 01:55:38,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1475
01:55:39,195 --> 01:55:42,116
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the max, it can't go higher than that.

1476
01:55:42,496 --> 01:55:45,676
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are not funding any sort of bonds or debt exclusions.

1477
01:55:45,716 --> 01:55:47,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are for the override.

1478
01:55:48,297 --> 01:55:48,697
Thank you.

1479
01:55:48,917 --> 01:55:49,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1480
01:55:51,940 --> 01:56:02,644
[SPEAKER_40]: If I can, Councilor Bielsa, in question six, I think we have a firefighters union here that have been involved in the negotiation because there is no limit on question six, truly is no limit.

1481
01:56:02,744 --> 01:56:03,705
[SPEAKER_40]: That's not true.

1482
01:56:04,150 --> 01:56:04,931
[SPEAKER_40]: No, there isn't.

1483
01:56:05,031 --> 01:56:05,812
[SPEAKER_40]: It's wide open.

1484
01:56:05,872 --> 01:56:18,885
[SPEAKER_40]: So I know that if we can maybe have a fire fighters that have been working on this, just to give us an idea of what the process was, the beginning, what we were looking at for a number and how, how much it's dropped.

1485
01:56:18,905 --> 01:56:20,587
[SPEAKER_40]: So we can understand truly.

1486
01:56:21,208 --> 01:56:22,249
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not the format here.

1487
01:56:22,269 --> 01:56:23,470
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll take public comment at the end.

1488
01:56:24,931 --> 01:56:25,372
[SPEAKER_40]: Oh, okay.

1489
01:56:25,894 --> 01:56:42,922
[SPEAKER_40]: So I'm sorry, hopefully the firefighters can have an opportunity to express why they want to vote no on this debt exclusion because I think what you asked, there is such fluctuation and what's true, what they needed and what was agreed upon

1490
01:56:43,682 --> 01:56:48,244
[SPEAKER_40]: before the mayor became very angry with the firefighters and then started cutting and cutting.

1491
01:56:48,604 --> 01:57:00,248
[SPEAKER_40]: And now we're left with an inferior product that our firemen and women, firefighter men and women said over and over again, that please do not hurt the residents of this community with an inferior station.

1492
01:57:00,288 --> 01:57:00,768
[SPEAKER_40]: Don't do it.

1493
01:57:01,428 --> 01:57:05,574
[SPEAKER_40]: Wait, maybe down the line, we could rethink this and refocus on what we could do.

1494
01:57:05,615 --> 01:57:08,158
[SPEAKER_40]: But for now, we're saying, let's not hurt.

1495
01:57:08,178 --> 01:57:08,679
[SPEAKER_40]: So here we go.

1496
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:11,944
[SPEAKER_40]: We have teachers that are saying, let's not hurt our community.

1497
01:57:11,964 --> 01:57:13,987
[SPEAKER_40]: You have firefighters saying, let's not hurt the community.

1498
01:57:14,929 --> 01:57:22,339
[SPEAKER_40]: The questions you're asking should have been out there for you, Joan, months and months ago, so you could truly understand the impact that you're going to feel.

1499
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:32,892
[SPEAKER_40]: And again, this is where we talk about the lack of transparency and why this should be taken off the table and people should vote no, because the bottom line is,

1500
01:57:33,533 --> 01:57:37,637
[SPEAKER_40]: The fear of children, that should be fixed with the $3 million from free cash.

1501
01:57:37,677 --> 01:57:39,298
[SPEAKER_40]: The mayor said it, we have 18.5.

1502
01:57:39,639 --> 01:57:41,520
[SPEAKER_40]: We could still take 3 million out and do that.

1503
01:57:41,901 --> 01:57:46,064
[SPEAKER_40]: We'll still have enough to keep our bond rating up and look to bond other projects.

1504
01:57:46,885 --> 01:57:54,412
[SPEAKER_40]: Or maybe we sit together again as a true financial working group, a task force, and say, how do we do this together as a community?

1505
01:57:54,432 --> 01:57:59,797
[SPEAKER_40]: So we're not gonna look later because there's no guarantees that there won't be another override next year, I promise you that.

1506
01:58:00,157 --> 01:58:03,920
[SPEAKER_40]: because every other community that's gone that way have asked for two and three.

1507
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:06,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1508
01:58:06,361 --> 01:58:12,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Just on the point about question six, Department of Revenue guidelines, it can be for the bonded amount.

1509
01:58:12,706 --> 01:58:13,826
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not written into the question.

1510
01:58:13,846 --> 01:58:15,968
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because of how the Proposition 2.5 law is written.

1511
01:58:16,633 --> 01:58:20,656
[SPEAKER_04]: but it is for the $30 million plus minor project changes.

1512
01:58:20,936 --> 01:58:22,097
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not a blank check.

1513
01:58:22,337 --> 01:58:23,598
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not just an open thing.

1514
01:58:23,738 --> 01:58:28,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Department of Revenue has extent, the State Department of Revenue has extensive guidelines on this.

1515
01:58:28,962 --> 01:58:36,188
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there are minor project changes or construction related inflation adjustments, those could be included, but they have to be minor.

1516
01:58:36,588 --> 01:58:45,715
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's a significant increase to the budget, it would have to either be going out for another bond funded by another revenue source or funded by an additional debt exclusion vote of the people.

1517
01:58:46,843 --> 01:58:47,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1518
01:58:47,243 --> 01:58:48,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go to Zoom.

1519
01:58:49,384 --> 01:58:50,904
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Christina Roberts.

1520
01:58:51,004 --> 01:58:53,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Christina, you have one minute to ask your question.

1521
01:58:53,944 --> 01:58:55,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

1522
01:58:57,005 --> 01:58:57,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

1523
01:58:57,605 --> 01:59:00,306
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Christina Roberts at 21 Brook Street.

1524
01:59:00,326 --> 01:59:06,287
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to take a minute to thank you guys for doing the hard work to get this question before the voters.

1525
01:59:07,407 --> 01:59:14,829
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can tell from the tone of many public meetings and discussions on Facebook, it is not an easy thing for a politician to do.

1526
01:59:15,789 --> 01:59:26,334
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm coming here tonight as an enthusiastic supporter of these initiatives, not because of fear, but because I'd like to live in a city that invests in their public schools.

1527
01:59:26,994 --> 01:59:40,340
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy relatively low property tax rates compared to surrounding towns, and I would love to see our teachers get paid at rates that are aligned with our surrounding communities.

1528
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:44,864
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd just love to see our town have a flourishing, strong public school system.

1529
01:59:44,924 --> 01:59:47,527
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you so much.

1530
01:59:47,587 --> 01:59:54,073
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm just here to say thanks for doing the hard work and for getting the information into the hands of the voters.

1531
01:59:56,336 --> 01:59:59,399
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to the podium, name and address for the record.

1532
01:59:59,739 --> 02:00:01,541
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a minute to ask your questions.

1533
02:00:01,974 --> 02:00:05,137
[SPEAKER_42]: Good evening, Claudia Fennelly, 36 Farragut Avenue.

1534
02:00:05,157 --> 02:00:16,829
[SPEAKER_42]: I want to mention that as a taxpayer, I cannot vote for these resolutions because the monies that you're requesting specifically for question number six and eight do not appear to have a plan.

1535
02:00:17,430 --> 02:00:22,755
[SPEAKER_42]: And after hearing tonight the concerns, financial budgetary concerns of the council,

1536
02:00:23,516 --> 02:00:43,583
[SPEAKER_42]: I'd like to ask how could you possibly present a request from taxpayers on question six when there is no formal approved fire headquarter plan that specifically addresses the union concerns because they're the ones that are out there doing the fighting on our behalf.

1537
02:00:44,163 --> 02:00:48,845
[SPEAKER_42]: And as a citizen, we don't want to be under shortchanged at all because of

1538
02:00:49,585 --> 02:00:53,228
[SPEAKER_42]: Oversight regardless of the personal matter.

1539
02:00:53,248 --> 02:01:04,596
[SPEAKER_42]: So my question be to the council in Business this would not even pass or fly you need to present plans and

1540
02:01:04,836 --> 02:01:14,383
[SPEAKER_42]: If you had presented tonight a plan for an approved fire headquarters that everyone was said, this is going to meet our needs.

1541
02:01:14,904 --> 02:01:17,446
[SPEAKER_42]: Then I could say I would vote for number six, but right.

1542
02:01:17,506 --> 02:01:29,115
[SPEAKER_42]: I mean, yes, number six, but I cannot do that because I'm not convinced that you are giving us the necessary information or are even approving of a fire headquarters.

1543
02:01:29,475 --> 02:01:33,318
[SPEAKER_42]: That's going to be something that will meet our needs in five years.

1544
02:01:33,618 --> 02:01:34,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the question.

1545
02:01:35,063 --> 02:01:36,307
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to members of the Council.

1546
02:01:36,328 --> 02:01:37,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lazzaro, two minutes.

1547
02:01:40,319 --> 02:01:53,646
[SPEAKER_29]: I would offer that another Councilor might be better equipped to answer the question about the way that debt exclusions are structured legally, the ramifications of how you estimate the dollar amount that it's going to cost.

1548
02:01:53,766 --> 02:02:03,711
[SPEAKER_29]: But I will say that the firehouse is a property of the city, which means it's owned by the residents of Medford, not the firefighters.

1549
02:02:04,231 --> 02:02:19,357
[SPEAKER_29]: So even if the union is not in agreement with the mayor, the property is owned by the city and if it's not in good working order and we need to maintain the building, it's important that the building be maintained.

1550
02:02:21,411 --> 02:02:23,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Leming, two minutes.

1551
02:02:23,632 --> 02:02:23,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1552
02:02:24,352 --> 02:02:46,799
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would like to point out that in asking for specifics for these things, there is a bit of a kind of a circular logic that goes in because if hypothetically we were to put forward to the voters the exact pay scale of each teacher in each line item, that's not really possible because union contracts haven't actually been negotiated, haven't been negotiated yet.

1553
02:02:46,819 --> 02:02:48,339
[SPEAKER_13]: So that would be premature.

1554
02:02:50,060 --> 02:02:51,821
[SPEAKER_42]: This wasn't regarding the contract.

1555
02:02:51,861 --> 02:02:52,622
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no, no.

1556
02:02:52,742 --> 02:02:55,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just getting there if we could just maintain decorum.

1557
02:02:55,644 --> 02:02:56,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1558
02:02:56,284 --> 02:03:00,087
[SPEAKER_13]: And so, I mean, it goes for a lot of things.

1559
02:03:00,147 --> 02:03:05,010
[SPEAKER_13]: It goes for the development of the plans for a fire station as well.

1560
02:03:05,030 --> 02:03:17,138
[SPEAKER_13]: So you don't have to have the plans completely finalized and approved, but you can have a estimate for the full cost of the station from the people that are developing the plans beforehand.

1561
02:03:17,218 --> 02:03:17,518
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now,

1562
02:03:18,178 --> 02:03:20,080
[SPEAKER_13]: estimate is $30 million.

1563
02:03:20,480 --> 02:03:24,202
[SPEAKER_13]: And it goes, I mean, it goes for the salaries as well.

1564
02:03:24,282 --> 02:03:33,469
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, we are, we put in the ballot questions, the areas where it would go to, but we can't say it will go to 10 teachers.

1565
02:03:33,529 --> 02:03:38,272
[SPEAKER_13]: It will go to 15 parents, et cetera, because those need to be negotiated after the fact.

1566
02:03:38,632 --> 02:03:40,714
[SPEAKER_13]: On the other hand, if, on the other hand, if we do

1567
02:03:41,574 --> 02:03:48,921
[SPEAKER_13]: I've also heard people say, OK, how can you promise higher wages, for instance, if those contracts haven't been negotiated?

1568
02:03:48,961 --> 02:03:56,289
[SPEAKER_13]: So this becomes a bit of a chicken and egg problem when asking for specifics versus not being specific enough on these valid questions.

1569
02:03:56,549 --> 02:03:58,631
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd just like to make that general point, so thank you.

1570
02:04:00,438 --> 02:04:04,923
[SPEAKER_42]: didn't hear the question answered about the proposed building design.

1571
02:04:05,444 --> 02:04:09,208
[SPEAKER_42]: But you mentioned salaries, and I do agree salaries have to be met.

1572
02:04:09,468 --> 02:04:09,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1573
02:04:09,789 --> 02:04:11,030
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to Councilor Tseng.

1574
02:04:11,050 --> 02:04:12,372
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be very brief.

1575
02:04:13,253 --> 02:04:18,799
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in state procurement law, and I believe that this is the process moving forward that we

1576
02:04:19,580 --> 02:04:27,524
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, we can plan to a certain threshold, but then we need to find the source of revenue that we have to pay for that project before we move on that much further.

1577
02:04:27,904 --> 02:04:35,688
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that's where we are in the process is where at this, uh, at the step in the process where we're identifying that source of revenue for the project moving on.

1578
02:04:36,128 --> 02:04:36,888
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's premature.

1579
02:04:37,408 --> 02:04:37,729
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1580
02:04:38,069 --> 02:04:44,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I mean, I can answer the question more specifically or vice president Collins, but, um, if you don't mind, mine is on a different part of the question.

1581
02:04:45,333 --> 02:04:45,913
[SPEAKER_04]: This what?

1582
02:04:46,193 --> 02:04:47,614
[SPEAKER_24]: Mine is related to a different part of the question.

1583
02:04:47,834 --> 02:04:48,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1584
02:04:48,774 --> 02:05:05,080
[SPEAKER_04]: On this specific question, when we were looking at the financial state of the city, we said, what is the biggest capital obligation that the city is going to have over the next five to 10 years, other than a high school, which we've excluded from everyone acknowledges is such a big project needs to be handled on its own.

1585
02:05:05,740 --> 02:05:06,941
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a new fire headquarters.

1586
02:05:07,981 --> 02:05:11,602
[SPEAKER_04]: We can get into the back and forth dispute over should there have been a combined headquarters?

1587
02:05:11,622 --> 02:05:12,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Should this have been 10, 10 years ago?

1588
02:05:14,008 --> 02:05:18,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Those, quite frankly, were decisions that were made before I was even thinking about running for office.

1589
02:05:19,817 --> 02:05:22,861
[SPEAKER_04]: When we looked at that, we said, that's the biggest expense.

1590
02:05:23,342 --> 02:05:28,870
[SPEAKER_04]: If we ask the voters to do that as a debt exclusion, it means that bond capacity is available for many of the other things that we've talked about.

1591
02:05:30,390 --> 02:05:31,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we looked at that.

1592
02:05:32,172 --> 02:05:34,614
[SPEAKER_04]: There has been an owner's project manager hired by the mayor.

1593
02:05:34,935 --> 02:05:47,648
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor has controlled the design process, has included, my understanding, chiefs, has not included the union or firefighters to the level that they've wanted to be included, and has never included this council in the design process.

1594
02:05:47,668 --> 02:05:49,890
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not part of the design process for the fire station.

1595
02:05:50,811 --> 02:06:00,916
[SPEAKER_04]: We made a decision based on the financial health of the community, based on the estimates provided by the designer, the mayor, and the fire chief, that a $30 million fire station is what they think will need to be built.

1596
02:06:01,556 --> 02:06:03,177
[SPEAKER_04]: The design is not finalized.

1597
02:06:04,057 --> 02:06:07,779
[SPEAKER_04]: My understanding is that changes can and are being made.

1598
02:06:09,380 --> 02:06:11,321
[SPEAKER_04]: But to us, it was a separate question.

1599
02:06:11,381 --> 02:06:15,123
[SPEAKER_04]: The design process is not something that this council has been involved in.

1600
02:06:16,104 --> 02:06:21,189
[SPEAKER_04]: But the financial health of the community is obviously something that we work on during the budget process.

1601
02:06:21,469 --> 02:06:28,956
[SPEAKER_04]: And so identifying this project as what should be funded by a debt exclusion was how we made that decision.

1602
02:06:29,637 --> 02:06:29,877
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1603
02:06:30,138 --> 02:06:30,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1604
02:06:31,139 --> 02:06:32,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Collins, two minutes.

1605
02:06:32,861 --> 02:07:01,697
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, and just quickly to follow up on that, I'll note that, again, to echo what President Bears said, it's not within the purview of this council to have any input on the design of the fire headquarters, but I will note for folks who might be interested, on the city website under the fire department webpage, there are links to six of the concept plans that were published this year, which I think is interesting for folks, for residents who want a little bit more detail, because it actually enumerates what's different in each design from the one preceding it.

1606
02:07:05,592 --> 02:07:06,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1607
02:07:06,713 --> 02:07:07,374
[SPEAKER_40]: Mr. President.

1608
02:07:07,434 --> 02:07:08,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli, two minutes.

1609
02:07:09,015 --> 02:07:12,578
[SPEAKER_40]: Isn't this a total microcosm of what we're saying?

1610
02:07:13,939 --> 02:07:15,541
[SPEAKER_40]: This is what 678 is about.

1611
02:07:15,701 --> 02:07:16,822
[SPEAKER_40]: There's so much confusion.

1612
02:07:18,083 --> 02:07:24,648
[SPEAKER_40]: First of all, we have to understand the feasibility study that was done is what gets us the funding for through procurement.

1613
02:07:25,089 --> 02:07:26,050
[SPEAKER_40]: So we know the numbers.

1614
02:07:27,110 --> 02:07:33,656
[SPEAKER_40]: When my fellow council said that this is a city building and firefighters, I don't know what the comment was, that is so irresponsible.

1615
02:07:34,437 --> 02:07:44,086
[SPEAKER_40]: To understand that this fire department's gonna stand up and say, no, we don't want a new headquarters because it's insufficient and it will hurt our community funding-wise.

1616
02:07:45,151 --> 02:07:57,497
[SPEAKER_40]: When we say the needs of the community, we mean proper safe staffing and department and ability to add technical rescue specialist services to our emergency response, which will bring better services to the citizens in every call.

1617
02:07:58,197 --> 02:07:59,538
[SPEAKER_40]: That's wrong what they're asking for.

1618
02:07:59,558 --> 02:08:03,260
[SPEAKER_40]: They're asking for a fire stations adequate to help our community grow.

1619
02:08:05,060 --> 02:08:16,686
[SPEAKER_40]: The proposed design does not adequately address the health and safety issues of the fire service regarding cancer exposure mitigations, the privacy concerns which have never been addressed properly by our department.

1620
02:08:17,206 --> 02:08:19,848
[SPEAKER_40]: Adults deserve privacy regardless of the gender.

1621
02:08:20,328 --> 02:08:23,210
[SPEAKER_40]: This isn't an issue which is female and men.

1622
02:08:23,850 --> 02:08:29,093
[SPEAKER_40]: Do you understand the design that was presented has firefighters after a fire showering downstairs

1623
02:08:29,833 --> 02:08:35,838
[SPEAKER_40]: walking upstairs in a towel or a bathrobe, walking down a community hallway to get to their quarters.

1624
02:08:36,278 --> 02:08:39,801
[SPEAKER_40]: By the way, their quarters did not consist of a locker room.

1625
02:08:41,522 --> 02:08:42,583
[SPEAKER_40]: This is what we're saying.

1626
02:08:42,683 --> 02:08:47,967
[SPEAKER_40]: These are issues that I can't even believe that we would entertain this with so many questions.

1627
02:08:48,508 --> 02:08:50,589
[SPEAKER_40]: This is how six, seven, and eight were all done.

1628
02:08:50,990 --> 02:08:58,456
[SPEAKER_40]: They were all done in a bubble that we're supposedly battled over on social media by a leader of our community.

1629
02:08:59,116 --> 02:09:12,520
[SPEAKER_40]: We have the former fire chief here, we have the leaders of our fire department that have openly said, we don't want to hurt our citizenry and putting $30 million, let alone $3 into this because we don't know what we need.

1630
02:09:12,980 --> 02:09:14,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1631
02:09:15,901 --> 02:09:17,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for this question.

1632
02:09:20,402 --> 02:09:21,863
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we'll go to

1633
02:09:24,275 --> 02:09:25,016
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little wary.

1634
02:09:25,497 --> 02:09:29,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Bill on Zoom, if you could provide a last name or a last initial, we'll go to the podium.

1635
02:09:30,825 --> 02:09:32,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Damon, address record, you have a minute to ask your question.

1636
02:09:34,530 --> 02:09:36,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Richard Orlando, Winford Way.

1637
02:09:37,739 --> 02:09:39,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Council President here's my question in my minute.

1638
02:09:40,663 --> 02:09:48,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Before I get to that, I want to comment on a statement you made about the project school project, maybe not being done correctly.

1639
02:09:48,594 --> 02:09:54,902
[SPEAKER_09]: And then a more egregious comment from the Councilor to my right, that that work was done in a shoddy manner.

1640
02:09:55,603 --> 02:10:05,091
[SPEAKER_09]: That project called building the future was identified as the premier project for schools in the Commonwealth 20 years ago.

1641
02:10:05,611 --> 02:10:13,018
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can speak wholeheartedly for the professionalism of the citizens and professionals that put that together.

1642
02:10:13,358 --> 02:10:16,841
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm very disappointed to hear those kinds of comments.

1643
02:10:17,622 --> 02:10:17,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

1644
02:10:18,002 --> 02:10:19,183
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I will give you

1645
02:10:19,713 --> 02:10:21,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't expecting you to go around the rules here.

1646
02:10:22,455 --> 02:10:24,977
[SPEAKER_04]: My point was not that the people involved did a bad job.

1647
02:10:25,037 --> 02:10:27,800
[SPEAKER_04]: My point was clearly this was an issue that was missed.

1648
02:10:28,260 --> 02:10:34,565
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was a comment made by someone very involved in those projects at a political event, quote, we made money.

1649
02:10:36,487 --> 02:10:42,892
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that's just something that should be entertained as maybe also maybe not representing the work or the goals of that committee.

1650
02:10:44,994 --> 02:10:45,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1651
02:10:45,794 --> 02:10:46,875
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can have your question.

1652
02:10:46,935 --> 02:10:55,660
[SPEAKER_09]: I would just ask if anybody on this committee or any of these transparent committees want to understand citizen engagement, sit down with a few of the building, the future committee.

1653
02:10:55,800 --> 02:10:58,001
[SPEAKER_05]: I've sat down with some people who are on that committee.

1654
02:10:58,021 --> 02:10:58,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1655
02:10:59,622 --> 02:11:00,662
[SPEAKER_09]: I would question that.

1656
02:11:00,682 --> 02:11:00,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1657
02:11:01,202 --> 02:11:01,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

1658
02:11:03,339 --> 02:11:04,520
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a minute to ask your question.

1659
02:11:04,540 --> 02:11:07,641
[SPEAKER_09]: The claim is that these overrides are for the children and teachers.

1660
02:11:08,422 --> 02:11:18,227
[SPEAKER_09]: The school superintendent stated at a city council meeting that if the override passes, these funds would not necessarily be used to secure the teacher positions.

1661
02:11:19,028 --> 02:11:20,869
[SPEAKER_09]: I was at that meeting and heard that statement.

1662
02:11:21,469 --> 02:11:23,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Recently, the use of the funds has been changing.

1663
02:11:24,190 --> 02:11:26,912
[SPEAKER_09]: We are now hearing that busing costs will be included.

1664
02:11:27,512 --> 02:11:32,655
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems very unlikely that the funds will make it into the children's classrooms.

1665
02:11:33,871 --> 02:11:38,255
[SPEAKER_09]: The father children argument is more sounding like an emotional distraction.

1666
02:11:39,116 --> 02:11:44,020
[SPEAKER_09]: What are the assurances that Medford children will actually benefit from these overlaps?

1667
02:11:45,021 --> 02:11:45,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1668
02:11:45,822 --> 02:11:46,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1669
02:11:46,162 --> 02:11:48,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I'm going to go for that two minutes.

1670
02:11:48,884 --> 02:11:50,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Council vice president Collins.

1671
02:11:50,986 --> 02:11:51,727
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for the question.

1672
02:11:52,047 --> 02:11:59,794
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, again, as a city council member, not involved in the school's department budgeting process, but I would just say, considering these questions,

1673
02:12:03,373 --> 02:12:10,101
[SPEAKER_24]: thinking about the motives behind them in terms of the motives for community, the motives politically for putting these forward.

1674
02:12:11,682 --> 02:12:19,171
[SPEAKER_24]: It's hard for me to imagine, even putting on my cynical hat, what our gain could possibly be in putting forward

1675
02:12:20,677 --> 02:12:40,472
[SPEAKER_24]: a question that asks residents to pay more in taxes to then spend it on spurious things in the schools department when we know, because we hear from residents all the time, all year long in school department meetings, in school committee meetings and in city council meetings, the adverse effects on students and teachers and staff because of underfunding.

1676
02:12:42,072 --> 02:12:47,775
[SPEAKER_24]: And the ways that we want to see the school experience be better for students that we can't yet afford.

1677
02:12:48,415 --> 02:12:49,035
[SPEAKER_24]: It's it's hard.

1678
02:12:49,735 --> 02:13:01,140
[SPEAKER_24]: We have no motivation to raise this money and then spend it on things that are not the things that the community has already been in some cases really begging city leadership to spend it on.

1679
02:13:04,265 --> 02:13:21,433
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not involved in the weeds of the school's department budgeting process the way that the school committee is in the way that the school's department is, but there is, it's just impossible for me to imagine a scenario where this money will be spent on 30 seconds.

1680
02:13:21,633 --> 02:13:21,933
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1681
02:13:24,821 --> 02:13:36,804
[SPEAKER_24]: The goal of doing this very difficult thing, which indeed is causing a lot of difficult conversations in the community, is to improve life for Medford public school students, life and conditions for Medford residents.

1682
02:13:38,344 --> 02:13:40,885
[SPEAKER_24]: It would be... 10 seconds.

1683
02:13:41,585 --> 02:13:48,247
[SPEAKER_24]: It would be bizarre for us to spend it away on various things that weren't directly related to improving quality of life for residents and students.

1684
02:13:48,907 --> 02:13:49,467
[SPEAKER_09]: In the classroom.

1685
02:13:51,820 --> 02:13:52,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1686
02:13:52,260 --> 02:13:53,401
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going back and forth.

1687
02:13:53,481 --> 02:13:54,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else want to go on this question?

1688
02:13:54,762 --> 02:13:55,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lazzaro.

1689
02:13:59,024 --> 02:14:05,288
[SPEAKER_29]: I used to work for the superintendent of schools, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, and I believe

1690
02:14:06,739 --> 02:14:12,242
[SPEAKER_29]: I've never worked for somebody who has had so much integrity and led from such a place of integrity.

1691
02:14:12,302 --> 02:14:33,593
[SPEAKER_29]: And I believe that she, when she answered Councilor Scarpelli, who I think asked her that question a number of times over and over again, in order to try to get her to say something off or make a mistake, but she was trying to not lie.

1692
02:14:33,793 --> 02:14:35,073
[SPEAKER_29]: And what she doesn't wanna do is,

1693
02:14:36,567 --> 02:14:46,318
[SPEAKER_29]: be caught up in having to make a decision that doesn't put the best scenario for the students first.

1694
02:14:46,639 --> 02:14:51,284
[SPEAKER_29]: So my guess is that that was where that was coming from.

1695
02:14:52,045 --> 02:14:54,548
[SPEAKER_29]: Also, that things shift in schools all the time.

1696
02:14:54,608 --> 02:14:56,470
[SPEAKER_29]: People leave districts for various reasons.

1697
02:14:56,834 --> 02:15:03,298
[SPEAKER_29]: If you can't reinforce or if you can't reappoint somebody to something because they got another job, these things happen all the time.

1698
02:15:03,338 --> 02:15:08,421
[SPEAKER_29]: You can't always put somebody back in a position because they've gotten another position somewhere else.

1699
02:15:08,521 --> 02:15:09,381
[SPEAKER_29]: It's not always possible.

1700
02:15:10,462 --> 02:15:13,484
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that was, I think she was trying to be truthful to the best of her ability.

1701
02:15:14,844 --> 02:15:22,829
[SPEAKER_29]: The other thing I will say is I'm sorry to have hurt anybody's feelings, but I really did not appreciate getting an email saying that the fixtures inside the school

1702
02:15:24,104 --> 02:15:25,805
[SPEAKER_29]: cause there to be lead in the water.

1703
02:15:25,926 --> 02:15:30,228
[SPEAKER_29]: I am not saying it as it was somebody else's fault, but my kids go to school there.

1704
02:15:31,129 --> 02:15:31,969
[SPEAKER_29]: There's lead in the water.

1705
02:15:34,030 --> 02:15:34,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1706
02:15:34,831 --> 02:15:35,791
[SPEAKER_29]: That's the facts.

1707
02:15:38,153 --> 02:15:38,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1708
02:15:39,434 --> 02:15:39,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1709
02:15:39,734 --> 02:15:44,457
[SPEAKER_04]: We, we can talk about water sewer infrastructure for another couple hours if we want.

1710
02:15:45,277 --> 02:15:46,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's a big problem.

1711
02:15:47,078 --> 02:15:48,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else have a answer?

1712
02:15:48,499 --> 02:15:49,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Lenders question.

1713
02:15:49,800 --> 02:15:50,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1714
02:15:50,260 --> 02:15:51,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli two minutes.

1715
02:15:51,977 --> 02:16:01,840
[SPEAKER_40]: So I appreciate my fellow Councilor being in my mind to understand what my plan was, was to get the superintendent to say something she didn't wanna say.

1716
02:16:02,461 --> 02:16:14,845
[SPEAKER_40]: Again, I appreciate the resident who put all of the meetings out on social media because you could say whatever you want about George Scarpelli.

1717
02:16:14,885 --> 02:16:21,147
[SPEAKER_40]: You could say that he's a liar, but when there are video and documentations with it, simple question to the superintendent was,

1718
02:16:22,188 --> 02:16:27,310
[SPEAKER_40]: Will this money, will it be made whole like Councilor, School Committee Woman Graham mentioned?

1719
02:16:27,670 --> 02:16:29,531
[SPEAKER_40]: Her simple answer was no.

1720
02:16:29,931 --> 02:16:31,692
[SPEAKER_40]: I wasn't trying to have her say anything any different.

1721
02:16:31,932 --> 02:16:40,055
[SPEAKER_40]: And as a matter of fact, what we're seeing in the school system after that vote, there were many teachers and many programs that were dismissed and cut.

1722
02:16:40,135 --> 02:16:43,977
[SPEAKER_40]: We had the band leader who left right away because there were promised things.

1723
02:16:44,037 --> 02:16:49,579
[SPEAKER_40]: We had, we had to believe a $200,000 line put in place for City Year, which is a great program,

1724
02:16:50,399 --> 02:16:57,304
[SPEAKER_40]: It's a great program, but when you have so many fiscal crises in the city, why are we funding something that's just a shiny nickel right now?

1725
02:16:57,844 --> 02:17:00,025
[SPEAKER_40]: There are so many issues with this, my friends.

1726
02:17:00,646 --> 02:17:03,508
[SPEAKER_40]: I implore you just to listen to the common sense.

1727
02:17:04,248 --> 02:17:07,030
[SPEAKER_40]: Listen to the understanding that you can use free cash.

1728
02:17:07,670 --> 02:17:14,775
[SPEAKER_40]: As a former teacher, and a parent of public school kids, and a coach, I understand, I lived it.

1729
02:17:15,816 --> 02:17:16,977
[SPEAKER_40]: I lived the process.

1730
02:17:17,981 --> 02:17:26,523
[SPEAKER_40]: but I also understand and how to move forward without hurting our whole community or without dividing our whole community, because this is what we're doing.

1731
02:17:27,203 --> 02:17:29,723
[SPEAKER_40]: These override questions are hurting our community.

1732
02:17:30,944 --> 02:17:33,084
[SPEAKER_40]: We don't have the information that's out there.

1733
02:17:33,384 --> 02:17:34,845
[SPEAKER_40]: It's not spelled out correctly.

1734
02:17:35,145 --> 02:17:39,746
[SPEAKER_40]: We don't truly know, although like Councilor Kelly had said, yeah, it goes to the general fund.

1735
02:17:40,106 --> 02:17:41,546
[SPEAKER_40]: We don't know where that money's going.

1736
02:17:43,439 --> 02:17:45,922
[SPEAKER_40]: So we have teachers positions open with money in there.

1737
02:17:45,942 --> 02:17:50,989
[SPEAKER_40]: Remember, there's a lot of money that hasn't been used to date that we can still use, but thank you.

1738
02:17:51,309 --> 02:17:51,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1739
02:17:53,973 --> 02:17:54,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan, two minutes.

1740
02:17:56,116 --> 02:18:23,406
[SPEAKER_26]: Sure, I think it's important to understand that the money from both seven and eight will go to the schools, obviously not the 500,000 for the roads, but the rest of it, and that it is the job of the school committee with the mayor and with the school superintendent and the financial people and the whole administration of the schools to figure out how best to serve children with that budget.

1741
02:18:25,484 --> 02:18:37,876
[SPEAKER_26]: It's possible that a tiny percentage of that may be necessary to boost our busing so that young kids are not walking across dangerous intersections.

1742
02:18:38,456 --> 02:18:40,819
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm not going to be making that decision.

1743
02:18:41,059 --> 02:18:45,023
[SPEAKER_26]: That's simply a tiny example since people have mentioned busing.

1744
02:18:47,725 --> 02:18:52,108
[SPEAKER_26]: a zillion different decisions that can be made when you're talking about the school budget.

1745
02:18:53,008 --> 02:19:09,378
[SPEAKER_26]: And it's the job of that part of the electeds and administration, the school committee, as well as the administration of the school system to make the best decisions each year, given what is happening that year with the budget that they have.

1746
02:19:09,859 --> 02:19:14,402
[SPEAKER_26]: And of course, as always, with the best interests of the students in mind.

1747
02:19:16,223 --> 02:19:16,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1748
02:19:19,690 --> 02:19:29,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to get specific, when we talk about the needs in the classroom, 85% of the school budget is salaries and staff, 15% is non-salary and staff expenses.

1749
02:19:29,958 --> 02:19:37,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Likely the vast majority of both of these questions through collective bargaining will end up going to either hiring more staff or paying existing staff more.

1750
02:19:38,181 --> 02:19:49,286
[SPEAKER_04]: The specifics outlined in the fiscal 25 budget process by the schools are eight classroom teachers, five paraprofessionals, two literacy interventionists, two behavior specialists.

1751
02:19:49,346 --> 02:19:51,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I think those are all significant impact on the students in the room.

1752
02:19:52,928 --> 02:20:01,432
[SPEAKER_04]: A nurse, a school administrative assistant at the McGlynn, which right now is operating with one administrative assistant instead of two for a complex of over 1,000 kids.

1753
02:20:02,392 --> 02:20:04,733
[SPEAKER_04]: We could say those aren't in the classroom, but I think we know those would help.

1754
02:20:05,188 --> 02:20:06,669
[SPEAKER_04]: in the classroom and help kids as well.

1755
02:20:07,309 --> 02:20:22,838
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are the real life impacts of what this would go to fund, nevermind the idea of paying paraprofessionals a living wage, hiring more staff to reduce class sizes or other things that would be possible through the collective bargaining process with the teachers union and the paraprofessionals union.

1756
02:20:25,680 --> 02:20:28,121
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to Zoom.

1757
02:20:28,862 --> 02:20:31,463
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Bill O'Brien, name and address for the record.

1758
02:20:31,503 --> 02:20:32,824
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a minute to ask your question.

1759
02:20:33,610 --> 02:20:35,191
[SPEAKER_44]: Bill O'Brien, 194 Central Lab.

1760
02:20:35,211 --> 02:20:37,413
[SPEAKER_44]: Yeah, I have a couple of questions and a couple of comments.

1761
02:20:38,013 --> 02:20:40,295
[SPEAKER_44]: First of all, there's nothing wrong with a low tax rate.

1762
02:20:40,895 --> 02:20:43,777
[SPEAKER_44]: I don't understand why politicians think we always should be paying more.

1763
02:20:44,378 --> 02:20:44,978
[SPEAKER_44]: That's number one.

1764
02:20:45,038 --> 02:20:52,303
[SPEAKER_44]: Number two, on a Councilor comment, this $30 million doesn't contain any firefighter salary.

1765
02:20:52,323 --> 02:21:00,229
[SPEAKER_44]: The firefighters negotiated a salary and settled it way back in October, just like the teachers negotiated a salary way back in October.

1766
02:21:00,993 --> 02:21:14,679
[SPEAKER_44]: So I don't understand why the city council would pass a budget if these salaries in these negotiations that were bargained in good faith by the unions in the city, if you couldn't find them, then why did you pass a budget?

1767
02:21:16,020 --> 02:21:16,840
[SPEAKER_44]: That's one question.

1768
02:21:17,101 --> 02:21:20,622
[SPEAKER_44]: My other question is why, where do the teachers feel about this?

1769
02:21:20,682 --> 02:21:24,724
[SPEAKER_44]: Is there any, I haven't seen any teachers commented about how they feel about this issue.

1770
02:21:25,184 --> 02:21:25,505
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

1771
02:21:28,026 --> 02:21:28,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1772
02:21:30,871 --> 02:21:33,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone have questions or answers on that?

1773
02:21:33,573 --> 02:21:34,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Leming, two minutes.

1774
02:21:35,515 --> 02:21:49,606
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, just to make the point that if you have a, you know, we, this is a request to pay slightly more property taxes, but it also goes along with the general point of, yeah, $37 a month.

1775
02:21:49,626 --> 02:21:59,214
[SPEAKER_13]: That's, that is slightly more, you know, with the, to go along with the general point of you get what you pay for,

1776
02:21:59,887 --> 02:22:02,050
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, we are a very underfunded city.

1777
02:22:04,112 --> 02:22:07,156
[SPEAKER_13]: And we would like that to not be the case.

1778
02:22:07,216 --> 02:22:10,159
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is a step in the right direction.

1779
02:22:10,960 --> 02:22:11,261
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all.

1780
02:22:13,271 --> 02:22:14,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, anyone else?

1781
02:22:14,952 --> 02:22:16,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, Mr. President, if I can.

1782
02:22:16,072 --> 02:22:17,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli, two minutes.

1783
02:22:17,872 --> 02:22:23,454
[SPEAKER_40]: Again, we went over this again, just to reiterate to people that are new to the room, $37, that's all it is.

1784
02:22:24,194 --> 02:22:31,657
[SPEAKER_40]: Coming from people that truly don't understand the impact, because a lot of people here, imagine just $37 a month, what that would do to people sitting in here.

1785
02:22:32,217 --> 02:22:34,918
[SPEAKER_40]: Imagine the impact, because that's been overlooked.

1786
02:22:35,598 --> 02:22:36,399
[SPEAKER_40]: but it's not 37.

1787
02:22:36,759 --> 02:22:38,881
[SPEAKER_40]: We talked about the CPA increase.

1788
02:22:38,901 --> 02:22:40,102
[SPEAKER_40]: We talked about the assessment.

1789
02:22:40,422 --> 02:22:42,043
[SPEAKER_40]: We talked about the excise tax.

1790
02:22:42,384 --> 02:22:43,144
[SPEAKER_40]: It's everything.

1791
02:22:43,204 --> 02:22:43,625
[SPEAKER_40]: It's not 37.

1792
02:22:43,685 --> 02:22:47,248
[SPEAKER_40]: The dialogue of fear spins it easily.

1793
02:22:47,828 --> 02:22:48,949
[SPEAKER_40]: Now, again, I'm gonna say this.

1794
02:22:49,890 --> 02:22:59,558
[SPEAKER_40]: The dialogue of fear, we talked about busing now, lead in the water, teacher cuts, roads and sidewalks, because $500,000 is gonna fix road and sidewalks.

1795
02:23:00,499 --> 02:23:03,702
[SPEAKER_40]: But the most important thing I wanna talk about is what's happening in our community.

1796
02:23:04,940 --> 02:23:17,615
[SPEAKER_40]: Because if you watch what's happening in social media, the teachers union, the MTA, has never ever, as one person that was on the negotiating team and a former member, has never ever

1797
02:23:19,119 --> 02:23:31,227
[SPEAKER_40]: ruled on or endorsed a candidate or a question, because we knew as union members that our impact's not gonna hurt just, it's not gonna help us, but it's gonna hurt other unions.

1798
02:23:31,908 --> 02:23:34,830
[SPEAKER_40]: So they did the right thing by staying neutral.

1799
02:23:36,050 --> 02:23:39,593
[SPEAKER_40]: And maybe they believe in it, maybe they don't, but they said, let's be, let's stay neutral.

1800
02:23:40,013 --> 02:23:46,798
[SPEAKER_40]: And shame on this community that have turned their backs on teachers saying, the comments I've been seeing, like this is the teacher's fault?

1801
02:23:48,151 --> 02:23:55,853
[SPEAKER_40]: This isn't the teacher's fault, this is the administration's fault to set up this fear tactic and set up this negativity to divide us.

1802
02:23:56,853 --> 02:23:58,254
[SPEAKER_40]: It's dividing our community.

1803
02:23:59,654 --> 02:24:02,415
[SPEAKER_40]: Listen, I want everything we can get for our children.

1804
02:24:02,655 --> 02:24:05,535
[SPEAKER_40]: I want everything we need for our students and parents.

1805
02:24:06,075 --> 02:24:07,956
[SPEAKER_40]: I want everything we need for our firefighters.

1806
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:18,942
[SPEAKER_40]: And there's options with new growth as we come down the line, but we can correct it right now without hurting renters, landlords, senior citizens, our people that are most vulnerable.

1807
02:24:19,642 --> 02:24:23,783
[SPEAKER_40]: We can use that free cash, make it whole and move forward.

1808
02:24:25,124 --> 02:24:29,145
[SPEAKER_40]: So I implore you, please, think about what you've been hearing.

1809
02:24:29,645 --> 02:24:32,405
[SPEAKER_40]: It's concrete, common sense information.

1810
02:24:32,565 --> 02:24:33,166
[SPEAKER_40]: So thank you.

1811
02:24:33,226 --> 02:24:33,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1812
02:24:35,766 --> 02:24:38,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Collins, two minutes.

1813
02:24:41,817 --> 02:24:42,117
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1814
02:24:44,560 --> 02:24:56,773
[SPEAKER_24]: Obviously, there's been a lot said in this Q&A forum, and I just think that with everything else that we've been hearing, I also want to put on the record that we talked about the costs if the overrides should pass.

1815
02:24:57,174 --> 02:24:59,336
[SPEAKER_24]: The assessor gave a great presentation earlier about

1816
02:25:00,356 --> 02:25:07,602
[SPEAKER_24]: how costs will go up regardless, how costs will go up if seven passes, how costs will go up if both pass, et cetera.

1817
02:25:08,463 --> 02:25:09,383
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's significant.

1818
02:25:09,824 --> 02:25:10,664
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that is significant.

1819
02:25:10,704 --> 02:25:14,888
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that people should take it seriously and decide how they feel about it and if they think that they can afford it.

1820
02:25:15,108 --> 02:25:19,251
[SPEAKER_24]: And what if any exemptions apply to them and how those will work with them and call the assessor if they have questions.

1821
02:25:20,032 --> 02:25:39,938
[SPEAKER_24]: I also think that what also deserves a serious and honest discussion is how households and individuals end up paying out of pocket if we continue to not fund our public sector, if we continue to let our roads and sidewalks get worse and worse and worse, which is something to be taken seriously.

1822
02:25:40,018 --> 02:25:41,018
[SPEAKER_24]: It is a safety issue.

1823
02:25:41,519 --> 02:25:42,759
[SPEAKER_24]: It is an accessibility issue.

1824
02:25:43,179 --> 02:25:49,181
[SPEAKER_24]: If we continue to let our schools get worse and keep missing every opportunity to make them get better,

1825
02:25:53,203 --> 02:26:03,725
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it is frankly condescending to build this discussion as nothing more than trying to scare people into voting a certain way.

1826
02:26:04,205 --> 02:26:11,046
[SPEAKER_24]: For the people who think, wow, what if the schools are no longer an environment where my student can learn or thrive?

1827
02:26:11,246 --> 02:26:12,787
[SPEAKER_24]: I cannot pay for a tutor.

1828
02:26:13,187 --> 02:26:15,367
[SPEAKER_24]: I cannot pay for five-day school tuition.

1829
02:26:15,467 --> 02:26:16,247
[SPEAKER_24]: I am concerned.

1830
02:26:18,388 --> 02:26:19,988
[SPEAKER_24]: We should not be belittling that emotion.

1831
02:26:20,575 --> 02:26:34,590
[SPEAKER_24]: We should not be belittling people who are having to pay out of pocket every year for car repairs, because we can't take care of the most basic thing in our city in a way that makes it not quite so obvious when you drive from Winchester into Medford.

1832
02:26:37,645 --> 02:26:44,949
[SPEAKER_24]: The format of this discussion was supposed to be a Q&A session where residents can ask questions and Councilors could give answers to the best of their ability.

1833
02:26:45,530 --> 02:26:53,074
[SPEAKER_24]: I am pretty disappointed that it's turned into an event where certain Councilors are telling residents not how they should vote, but how they should feel.

1834
02:26:53,194 --> 02:26:54,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1835
02:26:54,895 --> 02:26:55,336
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll leave it there.

1836
02:26:55,636 --> 02:26:56,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1837
02:27:01,800 --> 02:27:03,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one, I appreciate your comments, Councilor Collins.

1838
02:27:04,741 --> 02:27:08,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two, I wanna say very clearly to the question, why did we pass the budget?

1839
02:27:09,224 --> 02:27:14,849
[SPEAKER_04]: When I'm talking about, someone have their phone on, someone watching in the room?

1840
02:27:17,310 --> 02:27:18,831
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could take that out of the room, please.

1841
02:27:21,253 --> 02:27:26,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you gotta, just don't wanna have it backlogging in the, thank you.

1842
02:27:28,364 --> 02:27:35,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to be clear, to answer the question, when we're talking about collective bargaining agreements, we're talking about future contracts, not current contracts.

1843
02:27:36,109 --> 02:27:43,574
[SPEAKER_04]: As was noted, that's not recommended by, I think, councilors who disagree on the substance, it's not recommended to use free cash for operating budget issues.

1844
02:27:44,135 --> 02:27:48,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly it's not recommended to use free cash to negotiate contracts.

1845
02:27:49,018 --> 02:27:53,021
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're talking about the capacity of the city to negotiate future contracts.

1846
02:27:53,441 --> 02:27:57,004
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was the question asked by Mr. O'Brien.

1847
02:27:58,390 --> 02:28:01,031
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to the podium, name and address the record.

1848
02:28:01,051 --> 02:28:02,351
[SPEAKER_04]: You have one minute to ask your question.

1849
02:28:02,872 --> 02:28:05,112
[SPEAKER_25]: Patricia Ciappelli, 53 Garfield.

1850
02:28:06,833 --> 02:28:17,477
[SPEAKER_25]: So one of the comments was last to the table, and I would say that's about right for Medford because nowhere did we apply for any road grants, which the federal government granted to Everett.

1851
02:28:17,947 --> 02:28:23,390
[SPEAKER_25]: They granted it to Somerville, and Springfield got $15 million in road grants.

1852
02:28:23,470 --> 02:28:24,771
[SPEAKER_25]: So what are we doing about that?

1853
02:28:25,411 --> 02:28:28,173
[SPEAKER_25]: Grants for the water and sewer are up and available now.

1854
02:28:28,253 --> 02:28:29,234
[SPEAKER_25]: What are we doing about that?

1855
02:28:29,334 --> 02:28:32,616
[SPEAKER_25]: Yet we're told, oh, you have to come up with the $200 million for that.

1856
02:28:32,636 --> 02:28:36,398
[SPEAKER_25]: $9 million sat in a checking account.

1857
02:28:37,515 --> 02:28:46,984
[SPEAKER_25]: In the highest interest rate times, in something conservative with a decent interest rate, you lost us $450,000 in one year's time.

1858
02:28:47,285 --> 02:28:47,685
[SPEAKER_25]: How long?

1859
02:28:47,765 --> 02:28:48,306
[SPEAKER_25]: In two years?

1860
02:28:48,906 --> 02:28:49,427
[SPEAKER_25]: You tell me.

1861
02:28:50,067 --> 02:29:00,878
[SPEAKER_25]: So we still haven't learned our lesson because I chased down Ted to say, why am I on the DLS website and it's showing me something different for the rate that our taxes would be coming up?

1862
02:29:01,318 --> 02:29:05,002
[SPEAKER_25]: And he said, oh, you added in the fire station.

1863
02:29:05,062 --> 02:29:06,343
[SPEAKER_25]: I said, well, of course I did.

1864
02:29:06,623 --> 02:29:08,024
[SPEAKER_25]: That's coming up next year.

1865
02:29:08,305 --> 02:29:09,706
[SPEAKER_25]: So people need to plan.

1866
02:29:10,046 --> 02:29:13,770
[SPEAKER_25]: So again, we haven't planned like we should three years, five years.

1867
02:29:13,830 --> 02:29:15,271
[SPEAKER_25]: We're just looking one year ahead.

1868
02:29:15,331 --> 02:29:16,792
[SPEAKER_25]: What do we need for one year?

1869
02:29:17,173 --> 02:29:23,799
[SPEAKER_25]: When the fact is, people who live on budgets actually do have to plan three and five years ahead.

1870
02:29:23,979 --> 02:29:24,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1871
02:29:24,459 --> 02:29:26,601
[SPEAKER_07]: We're over by about 20 seconds.

1872
02:29:26,701 --> 02:29:31,625
[SPEAKER_25]: We can only do expenses we can afford, but we can do an electric street sweeper.

1873
02:29:31,845 --> 02:29:39,331
[SPEAKER_25]: So my question to you is, why would I trust this administration with another dime of my money?

1874
02:29:39,391 --> 02:29:40,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your question.

1875
02:29:41,732 --> 02:29:46,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone want to take it?

1876
02:29:49,698 --> 02:29:51,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Callahan, two minutes.

1877
02:29:52,506 --> 02:29:54,027
[SPEAKER_26]: That's a tough question to answer.

1878
02:29:54,047 --> 02:30:02,469
[SPEAKER_26]: I simply want to say that chronic underfunding, unfortunately, causes people to mistrust their government.

1879
02:30:02,709 --> 02:30:10,132
[SPEAKER_26]: So, you know, half of our roads are in the worst two road conditions, and that's from chronic underfunding.

1880
02:30:11,692 --> 02:30:21,535
[SPEAKER_26]: It costs between 30 and 50 times as much to fix a road in condition five, that's the worst one, as it does to fix a road in condition two,

1881
02:30:22,864 --> 02:30:34,953
[SPEAKER_26]: And, you know, we would be able to pay every year for all of our roads to get repaired with chapter 90 funding if we never let them fall into that kind of disrepair, but through underfunding.

1882
02:30:35,970 --> 02:30:43,495
[SPEAKER_26]: chronic decades long underfunding, we have created a city that cannot service basic, basic needs.

1883
02:30:43,576 --> 02:30:46,538
[SPEAKER_26]: And that does make people mistrust the government, unfortunately.

1884
02:30:46,918 --> 02:30:56,545
[SPEAKER_26]: But the fix is, and someone here mentioned, you know, that what other communities do when they're in these situations is bonds and other things.

1885
02:30:56,905 --> 02:31:00,588
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that what other communities do in this situation is they pass a prop two and a half override.

1886
02:31:01,479 --> 02:31:02,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1887
02:31:02,600 --> 02:31:04,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

1888
02:31:05,021 --> 02:31:05,321
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1889
02:31:05,821 --> 02:31:07,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Please stop interrupting the proceedings.

1890
02:31:07,862 --> 02:31:08,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1891
02:31:09,063 --> 02:31:10,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Leving, two minutes.

1892
02:31:11,544 --> 02:31:14,925
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, where is the woman who asked the question?

1893
02:31:15,165 --> 02:31:15,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1894
02:31:15,465 --> 02:31:16,246
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like she left.

1895
02:31:17,526 --> 02:31:18,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry.

1896
02:31:18,627 --> 02:31:18,927
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1897
02:31:18,967 --> 02:31:19,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

1898
02:31:19,227 --> 02:31:20,008
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1899
02:31:20,028 --> 02:31:20,588
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

1900
02:31:21,208 --> 02:31:22,269
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I just wanted to point out.

1901
02:31:22,309 --> 02:31:24,590
[SPEAKER_13]: So there was, so I've seen this, um,

1902
02:31:25,566 --> 02:31:45,736
[SPEAKER_13]: error that people have been doing with the DLS calculator the past week or so, where they're taking the $7.5 million that comes from questions seven and eight combined, and then they're just adding that to the $30 million and then saying... I think she just added the $2 million for the estimated... Yeah, that is actually...

1903
02:31:55,952 --> 02:31:57,618
[SPEAKER_06]: except for older ones, right?

1904
02:31:58,020 --> 02:31:59,967
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, things are a lot harder on the men.

1905
02:32:19,485 --> 02:32:42,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking with the assessor's office, their estimate is that given declining interest rates for municipal bonds, given the contingency already in the project, and also the DLS, sorry, DOR, State Department of Revenue guidelines around debt exclusions, that it would essentially stay around the $30 million total cost for the debt service, for the bond, yeah.

1906
02:32:47,540 --> 02:32:48,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but the interest rate would be,

1907
02:32:49,617 --> 02:32:51,138
[SPEAKER_04]: set when the debt is issued.

1908
02:32:52,878 --> 02:32:56,480
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to Zoom, Sharon Diesso.

1909
02:32:57,040 --> 02:33:00,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry, you wanna go?

1910
02:33:00,041 --> 02:33:01,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I didn't see your hand.

1911
02:33:01,662 --> 02:33:02,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, Councilor Scarpa.

1912
02:33:02,862 --> 02:33:03,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Sharon, you have to wait a minute.

1913
02:33:04,263 --> 02:33:18,008
[SPEAKER_40]: I think that, Councilor, to clarify a little something, I think that what I've heard from residents is the chronic misrepresentation and the lack of true transparency

1914
02:33:18,840 --> 02:33:22,523
[SPEAKER_40]: is what causes the community to distrust.

1915
02:33:23,303 --> 02:33:24,424
[SPEAKER_40]: That's what we're seeing right now.

1916
02:33:25,304 --> 02:33:26,645
[SPEAKER_40]: That's truly what we're seeing right now.

1917
02:33:27,306 --> 02:33:34,030
[SPEAKER_40]: When you hear and see how we got to this point, this is what caused it.

1918
02:33:34,611 --> 02:33:43,176
[SPEAKER_40]: The misinformation, the confusion, the uncertainty for the people that are most vulnerable, our children, our seniors.

1919
02:33:46,138 --> 02:33:48,200
[SPEAKER_40]: That's the issue that we should be focusing on.

1920
02:33:49,144 --> 02:33:56,389
[SPEAKER_40]: and thinking that an override is the answer, or, ready for this one, $500,000 are gonna fix our streets.

1921
02:33:57,089 --> 02:33:57,489
[SPEAKER_40]: Come on.

1922
02:33:57,509 --> 02:33:59,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anyone's saying that.

1923
02:33:59,030 --> 02:34:03,814
[SPEAKER_40]: So let's look at, now I've heard that 20 times tonight, that $500,000 is gonna fix our streets.

1924
02:34:04,514 --> 02:34:06,155
[SPEAKER_40]: Let's look at the big picture of what's happening.

1925
02:34:06,876 --> 02:34:11,619
[SPEAKER_40]: DPW, the mayor is firing DPW workers hand over fist.

1926
02:34:12,438 --> 02:34:20,641
[SPEAKER_40]: We have equipment at DPW that we have members that haven't been trained because they don't know how to be trained on new equipment.

1927
02:34:21,722 --> 02:34:29,205
[SPEAKER_40]: We have a mayor that's spending so much money on legal fees and legal settlements.

1928
02:34:29,905 --> 02:34:41,890
[SPEAKER_40]: We're using, the mismanagement of funds in this community has hurt us to the point that here we are, that some council is saying, hey, since we haven't done it ever, let's do it, which is wrong.

1929
02:34:43,345 --> 02:34:50,211
[SPEAKER_40]: So again, I'd love to see us do this the right way from the schools with free cash.

1930
02:34:50,511 --> 02:34:58,758
[SPEAKER_40]: Let's go to the table and see what we truly need with a true financial team open to the public that it's shared with everybody's input.

1931
02:34:59,018 --> 02:34:59,358
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

1932
02:34:59,379 --> 02:35:06,785
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go to Sharon or Vice President Collins.

1933
02:35:07,898 --> 02:35:08,218
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1934
02:35:08,258 --> 02:35:08,718
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll be quick.

1935
02:35:09,139 --> 02:35:15,923
[SPEAKER_24]: Just a quick point of information because I know it's been said a few times tonight that the $500,000 would quote, fix the roads.

1936
02:35:16,463 --> 02:35:26,849
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that as the published pavement management plan on the city website establishes that we have $200 million in a backlog of road repairs in the city, I think we're all very aware

1937
02:35:27,529 --> 02:35:30,190
[SPEAKER_24]: that half a million dollars is not going to fix the roads.

1938
02:35:30,790 --> 02:35:44,176
[SPEAKER_24]: As it says in the text of the question, what this would do is enable the DPW to establish, as it reads, additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repair, which relates to the in-house hot top crew that Councilor Scarpelli has been advocating for for years.

1939
02:35:44,216 --> 02:35:46,798
[SPEAKER_24]: So Councilor, I'm sad to hear that you've reversed your position on that.

1940
02:35:48,618 --> 02:35:49,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1941
02:35:49,139 --> 02:35:50,759
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to Zoom.

1942
02:35:51,380 --> 02:35:52,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Sharon Diesso.

1943
02:35:52,140 --> 02:35:54,361
[SPEAKER_04]: You have one minute.

1944
02:35:54,401 --> 02:35:55,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

1945
02:35:55,701 --> 02:35:56,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Please ask your one question.

1946
02:35:58,157 --> 02:36:02,946
[SPEAKER_32]: Karen Andy, so circuit road in Mass Ave in Medford, longtime resident.

1947
02:36:03,327 --> 02:36:04,369
[SPEAKER_32]: Good evening, everyone.

1948
02:36:06,333 --> 02:36:10,201
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm sorry that this time is being heated to tonight.

1949
02:36:11,207 --> 02:36:16,111
[SPEAKER_32]: so close to the election that all of these topics are being addressed.

1950
02:36:17,251 --> 02:36:20,554
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't think anyone, even in the audience, is like, well, I agree with her.

1951
02:36:20,654 --> 02:36:21,374
[SPEAKER_32]: I agree with him.

1952
02:36:22,155 --> 02:36:22,815
[SPEAKER_32]: I heard much.

1953
02:36:23,496 --> 02:36:25,117
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not kind of happening like that.

1954
02:36:25,217 --> 02:36:30,301
[SPEAKER_32]: I have neighbors who have children in school, and they were asking me about it because they don't understand it.

1955
02:36:30,701 --> 02:36:33,283
[SPEAKER_32]: One of my neighbors didn't even know it was going to be on the table.

1956
02:36:33,923 --> 02:36:39,626
[SPEAKER_32]: So I think on the grounds of timing, Mr. Schiappelli, thank you very much.

1957
02:36:40,186 --> 02:36:44,888
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not favoring one councilman over the other, but it seems to be that you followed.

1958
02:36:44,908 --> 02:36:46,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a question, Sharon?

1959
02:36:46,448 --> 02:36:47,009
[SPEAKER_04]: You have 10 seconds.

1960
02:36:47,109 --> 02:36:48,209
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, yes, I do.

1961
02:36:48,449 --> 02:36:48,950
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, I do.

1962
02:36:49,410 --> 02:36:52,931
[SPEAKER_32]: That you've been following a time frame on this.

1963
02:36:53,111 --> 02:36:54,372
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, we were kind of shocked.

1964
02:36:55,412 --> 02:36:59,274
[SPEAKER_32]: During the time that you knew about some of these things,

1965
02:37:00,274 --> 02:37:04,737
[SPEAKER_32]: you know, coming about, this is the only answer that you could come up with?

1966
02:37:05,697 --> 02:37:09,159
[SPEAKER_32]: What do other communities do, Mr. President or Mr. Schiappelli?

1967
02:37:09,659 --> 02:37:11,780
[SPEAKER_32]: What if they turn to for alternatives?

1968
02:37:12,121 --> 02:37:17,323
[SPEAKER_32]: This is not acceptable, especially in Medford, because we haven't had one in 44 years.

1969
02:37:17,343 --> 02:37:18,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Sharon.

1970
02:37:21,706 --> 02:37:23,107
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just following the rules, guys.

1971
02:37:23,187 --> 02:37:25,488
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everyone needs to take a deep breath before groaning.

1972
02:37:31,172 --> 02:37:31,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone wanna go?

1973
02:37:31,793 --> 02:37:35,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli, anybody?

1974
02:37:36,278 --> 02:37:37,199
[SPEAKER_40]: I didn't understand her.

1975
02:37:37,419 --> 02:37:38,300
[SPEAKER_40]: I didn't hear her question.

1976
02:37:38,340 --> 02:37:44,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Her question was, what were the alternatives that could have been found that are not the overrides and debt exclusions?

1977
02:37:46,411 --> 02:37:47,712
[SPEAKER_40]: Well, it's very simple.

1978
02:37:47,732 --> 02:37:48,372
[SPEAKER_40]: I'll say it again.

1979
02:37:48,392 --> 02:38:02,923
[SPEAKER_40]: I think that when we sat and talked at the meeting in April, May, and June, I came forth with the proposal of a resolution of using free cash of the $25 million that we had.

1980
02:38:03,363 --> 02:38:09,047
[SPEAKER_40]: And I believe it was Councilor, when I brought it forth, it was Councilor Leming that used Rule 21, which froze

1981
02:38:11,007 --> 02:38:13,449
[SPEAKER_40]: the future discussions of that proposal.

1982
02:38:14,589 --> 02:38:26,638
[SPEAKER_40]: And then as it went through and you could see in the videos, as we went through that process, they kept using tactics where we couldn't speak or have open forums before we went to a vote in the budget.

1983
02:38:26,998 --> 02:38:29,259
[SPEAKER_40]: So again, these are issues that when I say

1984
02:38:31,291 --> 02:38:32,472
[SPEAKER_40]: That's what we need to eliminate.

1985
02:38:32,772 --> 02:38:43,681
[SPEAKER_40]: We need to sit together as a community and say, okay, what do we work with the state and work with our assessor and say, hey, let's understand the impact at an early enough stage so we can be prepared for that.

1986
02:38:44,021 --> 02:38:49,165
[SPEAKER_40]: Let's see if we can look at true exemptions that would help our landlords or senior citizens

1987
02:38:49,585 --> 02:38:59,013
[SPEAKER_40]: or our most vulnerable community members, then let's look at it and say, what do we really need and make sure that our children in our schools have everything that they're asking for?

1988
02:38:59,373 --> 02:39:13,966
[SPEAKER_40]: So I think that with that process being open, I don't think we wouldn't be able to deny anything, but the way the process has come out and the way that's been spun saying, Councilor Scarpelling wants no because he doesn't want that, that's not true.

1989
02:39:15,014 --> 02:39:23,297
[SPEAKER_40]: The truth of the matter is the way this process has gone about from 2023 in June till today has been a total farce.

1990
02:39:23,357 --> 02:39:24,197
[SPEAKER_40]: It's been a nightmare.

1991
02:39:24,658 --> 02:39:26,378
[SPEAKER_40]: It's been disingenuine.

1992
02:39:26,898 --> 02:39:28,799
[SPEAKER_40]: And this council can say what they want.

1993
02:39:28,839 --> 02:39:30,680
[SPEAKER_40]: These fair tactics are out there.

1994
02:39:30,720 --> 02:39:31,480
[SPEAKER_40]: You've heard them.

1995
02:39:31,520 --> 02:39:32,300
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm not making it up.

1996
02:39:32,680 --> 02:39:33,681
[SPEAKER_40]: You've heard them all say it.

1997
02:39:34,321 --> 02:39:38,444
[SPEAKER_40]: whether it's whether it's whether it's streets falling in.

1998
02:39:38,464 --> 02:39:44,528
[SPEAKER_40]: I mean, even the mayor said the other day was sitting on a 200 million dollar time bomb called our water system.

1999
02:39:44,728 --> 02:39:44,949
[SPEAKER_40]: Yeah.

2000
02:39:45,449 --> 02:39:49,772
[SPEAKER_40]: Well, if we did our job with ARPA, that's what that money was made for.

2001
02:39:50,232 --> 02:39:53,114
[SPEAKER_40]: Not to save your key, sir, because you had no new growth.

2002
02:39:53,535 --> 02:39:54,575
[SPEAKER_40]: This is why we're here.

2003
02:39:55,656 --> 02:39:56,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2004
02:39:56,076 --> 02:39:56,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2005
02:39:58,715 --> 02:40:00,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Leming, two minutes.

2006
02:40:00,659 --> 02:40:06,710
[SPEAKER_13]: So first, just to make the point that disagreeing doesn't mean it's a fear attack, it just means I disagree with you.

2007
02:40:07,391 --> 02:40:08,393
[SPEAKER_13]: Just want to put that out there.

2008
02:40:09,082 --> 02:40:32,740
[SPEAKER_13]: The actual answer to that is that the communities that haven't had to do Prop 2.5 overrides to keep a level budget are either the communities that have just much bigger budgets overall than we do, like Boston, or in cases like Cambridge, they invested in areas like Kendall Square years and years ago.

2009
02:40:33,961 --> 02:40:37,223
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford could have invested in that

2010
02:40:38,504 --> 02:40:40,025
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of development a long time ago.

2011
02:40:40,045 --> 02:40:41,827
[SPEAKER_13]: We just never did that.

2012
02:40:41,847 --> 02:40:46,851
[SPEAKER_13]: And smaller communities that don't really have the opportunity to do that sort of commercial development.

2013
02:40:46,891 --> 02:40:53,576
[SPEAKER_13]: Some towns are basically just residential properties and not a whole lot of commercial activity.

2014
02:40:53,596 --> 02:40:55,778
[SPEAKER_13]: They have to do these sorts of overrides regularly.

2015
02:40:56,258 --> 02:41:03,379
[SPEAKER_13]: So Medford kind of avoided this by just doing cuts and cuts and cuts until we became a very underfunded community.

2016
02:41:03,879 --> 02:41:22,082
[SPEAKER_13]: And now that we're at this point, there's really not much of a choice except for either kicking the can down the road more, which doesn't solve the problem, or doing one of these overrides like Our Neighbors, or we could get a time machine and do a lot more commercial development.

2017
02:41:22,142 --> 02:41:23,543
[SPEAKER_13]: But of course, that's not an option.

2018
02:41:23,603 --> 02:41:23,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2019
02:41:24,803 --> 02:41:25,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2020
02:41:26,670 --> 02:41:27,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else on these questions?

2021
02:41:31,432 --> 02:41:32,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Callahan?

2022
02:41:33,173 --> 02:41:33,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Sanz?

2023
02:41:35,194 --> 02:41:36,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2024
02:41:37,755 --> 02:41:45,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to be brief, you know, we have had for the last three years, the best three years of new growth in the city in the last 25 years.

2025
02:41:46,498 --> 02:41:47,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are just, again, the facts.

2026
02:41:47,959 --> 02:41:49,840
[SPEAKER_04]: They're on the DLS webpage.

2027
02:41:50,580 --> 02:41:52,822
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't disagree with data and mathematics.

2028
02:41:53,423 --> 02:41:55,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Data and mathematics are not fear tactics.

2029
02:41:56,085 --> 02:41:57,066
[SPEAKER_04]: They are just the facts.

2030
02:41:58,867 --> 02:42:11,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Alternatives, there was no way in the short to medium term to raise reliable, recurring, sustainable revenue to fund operating budget expenses, except for asking the voters to fund those expenses through an override.

2031
02:42:11,919 --> 02:42:15,562
[SPEAKER_04]: The property tax levy is the vast majority of the money that the city brings in.

2032
02:42:16,243 --> 02:42:19,106
[SPEAKER_04]: The state is not providing the city with significant new aid.

2033
02:42:19,687 --> 02:42:23,151
[SPEAKER_04]: The city departments go above and beyond finding federal and state grants.

2034
02:42:23,391 --> 02:42:25,594
[SPEAKER_04]: They are looking far and wide for them.

2035
02:42:26,495 --> 02:42:28,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because we don't receive them doesn't mean we didn't apply for them.

2036
02:42:30,399 --> 02:42:35,125
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be honest, a lot of the formulas and ways that those things are decided are not favoring places like Medford.

2037
02:42:36,065 --> 02:42:41,848
[SPEAKER_04]: because the state school formula looks at our city and they say, Oh, they should pay more in property taxes.

2038
02:42:41,888 --> 02:42:43,169
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to send them more state aid.

2039
02:42:43,589 --> 02:42:44,890
[SPEAKER_04]: That's literally how the formula is written.

2040
02:42:45,390 --> 02:42:48,151
[SPEAKER_04]: It's based on capacity for a city to do so.

2041
02:42:48,532 --> 02:42:57,036
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we are 93rd out of 97 for property tax revenue, when we are 94th out of 97 for per capita spending, we are where we are.

2042
02:42:57,056 --> 02:43:01,218
[SPEAKER_04]: The state's judges us based on that reality and says, we're not giving them more money.

2043
02:43:02,719 --> 02:43:02,899
[SPEAKER_04]: So,

2044
02:43:04,625 --> 02:43:18,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we came together over dozens of public meetings over three budget cycles addressing needs of the city and the school department and said, this is the best way to raise sustainable recurring revenue to fund city operating budget expenses.

2045
02:43:18,579 --> 02:43:21,142
[SPEAKER_04]: We believe this is the best path forward in the short to medium term.

2046
02:43:21,562 --> 02:43:23,464
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are going to ask the voters to make that decision.

2047
02:43:23,625 --> 02:43:25,767
[SPEAKER_04]: The voters are, the voters are going to vote.

2048
02:43:26,209 --> 02:43:27,029
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens.

2049
02:43:27,310 --> 02:43:29,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly hope they vote one way.

2050
02:43:29,191 --> 02:43:41,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Other Councilors may hope that they vote another way, but I don't envy anyone in any, I don't think any of us are going to be excited to do the budget if these funds are not available.

2051
02:43:43,422 --> 02:43:45,244
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to the podium, name and address record.

2052
02:43:45,264 --> 02:43:47,206
[SPEAKER_04]: You have one minute to ask your question, name and address.

2053
02:43:47,687 --> 02:43:49,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave.

2054
02:43:49,409 --> 02:43:50,250
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a parent of two.

2055
02:43:50,950 --> 02:43:53,173
[SPEAKER_03]: My little guys are at home and I'm here instead with you.

2056
02:43:53,994 --> 02:43:58,419
[SPEAKER_03]: So for anyone on the home gamers attacking me, well, I'm a white guy with Asian kids.

2057
02:43:58,519 --> 02:43:59,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's play identity politics.

2058
02:44:00,401 --> 02:44:04,486
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Councilor Leming, unsaid.

2059
02:44:05,609 --> 02:44:06,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Go look it up.

2060
02:44:06,630 --> 02:44:11,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what you would report to someone if someone offered you a contract and said, this is how much it's gonna cost me.

2061
02:44:11,893 --> 02:44:13,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Please address your questions through the chair.

2062
02:44:13,814 --> 02:44:18,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, through the chair, unsat, because that's not what a contractor would do.

2063
02:44:18,137 --> 02:44:19,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I have 10 seconds back for yours?

2064
02:44:19,497 --> 02:44:20,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

2065
02:44:20,378 --> 02:44:20,578
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2066
02:44:21,619 --> 02:44:21,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderful.

2067
02:44:22,379 --> 02:44:25,941
[SPEAKER_03]: So that said, question six is about the fire station.

2068
02:44:26,362 --> 02:44:28,303
[SPEAKER_03]: $30 million, I think is the estimate.

2069
02:44:28,323 --> 02:44:33,106
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of unclarity and we could publish the facts in your assumptions, interest rate, bond, period.

2070
02:44:34,127 --> 02:44:35,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Cambridge overran three times.

2071
02:44:36,588 --> 02:44:39,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Their fire station was 25 million in 2019, it's now 77.

2072
02:44:40,130 --> 02:44:43,351
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna knock down this firehouse, then what?

2073
02:44:43,811 --> 02:44:46,052
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your contingency plan when the costs go up?

2074
02:44:46,512 --> 02:44:48,333
[SPEAKER_03]: How many times are you gonna go back to the well?

2075
02:44:48,873 --> 02:44:51,074
[SPEAKER_03]: And what are you gonna do in the meantime when there's no firehouse?

2076
02:44:51,094 --> 02:44:52,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Merritt.

2077
02:44:54,396 --> 02:44:55,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone wanna go for that one?

2078
02:44:56,257 --> 02:45:01,159
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some answers on the Cambridge fire station, why it's not a good comparison, but go to Vice President Collins.

2079
02:45:02,296 --> 02:45:08,481
[SPEAKER_24]: No, I mean, if you have more detail to add on the Cambridge Fire Station example, I just think that we covered this question earlier.

2080
02:45:09,422 --> 02:45:15,607
[SPEAKER_04]: The Cambridge Fire Station was a historic renovation of a historic 125-year-old fire station.

2081
02:45:15,627 --> 02:45:17,949
[SPEAKER_04]: They were installing geothermal energy.

2082
02:45:19,310 --> 02:45:25,294
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just completely incomparable to the project that we're talking about in Medford Square, which is a knockdown.

2083
02:45:26,115 --> 02:45:29,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, the cost overruns were mainly due to historic preservation issues.

2084
02:45:30,118 --> 02:45:34,362
[SPEAKER_04]: and projects that they were trying to add in there that are not things that we're trying to add to our station.

2085
02:45:35,102 --> 02:45:36,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else on the question?

2086
02:45:39,305 --> 02:45:40,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Seat down, we'll go to Zoom.

2087
02:45:40,366 --> 02:45:41,527
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Micah Kesselman.

2088
02:45:41,607 --> 02:45:42,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Micah, you have one minute.

2089
02:45:42,708 --> 02:45:44,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

2090
02:45:45,390 --> 02:45:46,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Please ask one question.

2091
02:45:46,391 --> 02:45:48,052
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2092
02:45:48,112 --> 02:45:48,333
[SPEAKER_16]: Cool.

2093
02:45:48,373 --> 02:45:48,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks.

2094
02:45:48,613 --> 02:45:48,913
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

2095
02:45:48,973 --> 02:45:49,654
[SPEAKER_16]: Micah Kesselman.

2096
02:45:49,714 --> 02:45:50,995
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm at 499 Main Street.

2097
02:45:52,636 --> 02:45:58,881
[SPEAKER_16]: Guys, at the end of the day, we are one of the most underfunded per capita

2098
02:46:00,168 --> 02:46:07,658
[SPEAKER_16]: municipalities in the state, we money doesn't just frickin up here out of someone's ass, we have to get it somehow.

2099
02:46:08,099 --> 02:46:13,887
[SPEAKER_16]: The way we get it is sorry, the way we get it is via taxation.

2100
02:46:15,043 --> 02:46:24,510
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the sustainable way to produce revenues that could be spent by the municipality for the things that we need to have a happy and nice city to live in.

2101
02:46:25,371 --> 02:46:37,359
[SPEAKER_16]: So when people keep talking about this free cash, I would like some explanation about, I'm asking a question about where, how are you planning on making this free cash solution

2102
02:46:38,360 --> 02:46:45,109
[SPEAKER_16]: a sustainable ongoing method to solve our budgeting issue given that we are such an underfunded municipality.

2103
02:46:46,050 --> 02:46:46,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2104
02:46:46,591 --> 02:46:49,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone want to go for that?

2105
02:46:53,581 --> 02:46:56,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Leming, two minutes.

2106
02:46:57,063 --> 02:47:00,285
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I think we've already gone over the free cash issue quite a bit.

2107
02:47:00,306 --> 02:47:05,789
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the question was specifically, how would free cash become a sustainable solution for ongoing operating expenses?

2108
02:47:05,929 --> 02:47:07,170
[SPEAKER_13]: It wouldn't.

2109
02:47:07,690 --> 02:47:09,372
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the answer.

2110
02:47:09,412 --> 02:47:19,238
[SPEAKER_13]: We used $1.75 million in free cash to plug the budget with the understanding that we would have an override coming up on the ballot.

2111
02:47:20,379 --> 02:47:23,201
[SPEAKER_13]: I think what my colleague is saying is that we should do that

2112
02:47:24,041 --> 02:47:27,002
[SPEAKER_13]: another year and then do an override the next year or so.

2113
02:47:28,262 --> 02:47:35,545
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's, I'm honestly a bit confused why it keeps coming up as a solution to all of our problems.

2114
02:47:35,585 --> 02:47:41,446
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause it's not like you just can't use free cash year after year for salaries.

2115
02:47:41,486 --> 02:47:42,647
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not the way it works.

2116
02:47:43,087 --> 02:47:43,867
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

2117
02:47:44,514 --> 02:47:45,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

2118
02:47:45,174 --> 02:47:45,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2119
02:47:45,754 --> 02:47:49,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli, question is how would free cash be a sustainable solution?

2120
02:47:49,855 --> 02:47:50,535
[SPEAKER_40]: Let me say it again.

2121
02:47:50,555 --> 02:47:50,896
[SPEAKER_40]: Two minutes.

2122
02:47:51,516 --> 02:47:56,237
[SPEAKER_40]: This councilor has not said once that we should use free cash year after year.

2123
02:47:56,637 --> 02:48:06,279
[SPEAKER_40]: What I said right now is eliminate the fear for our senior citizens, our children, our teachers for one time to level fund this and look at other options.

2124
02:48:07,040 --> 02:48:07,720
[SPEAKER_40]: That's what I said.

2125
02:48:07,800 --> 02:48:12,501
[SPEAKER_40]: I don't know where this keeps coming back and forth and understand an override

2126
02:48:14,087 --> 02:48:24,953
[SPEAKER_40]: It was said by another financial director in another community, he said to me, George, remember, using an override to do what you're trying to do in Medford, it's like using your credit card to pay for your mortgage or pay for your rent.

2127
02:48:25,653 --> 02:48:26,894
[SPEAKER_40]: It's just not feasible.

2128
02:48:27,294 --> 02:48:29,075
[SPEAKER_40]: It's not a right way to go through the process.

2129
02:48:29,895 --> 02:48:41,201
[SPEAKER_40]: We look at the different situations that we talk about and we said, okay, you know, Medford has drastically underfunded so many processes when you look at our receipts.

2130
02:48:42,554 --> 02:48:43,715
[SPEAKER_40]: We're seeing that right now.

2131
02:48:43,795 --> 02:48:48,160
[SPEAKER_40]: We see that our circuit breaker has increased.

2132
02:48:48,660 --> 02:48:55,827
[SPEAKER_40]: We've seen that we use the Fair Amendment Act for Chapter 70, our increase of $4 million.

2133
02:48:56,808 --> 02:48:58,350
[SPEAKER_40]: There is a lot that's out there.

2134
02:48:58,390 --> 02:49:02,994
[SPEAKER_40]: There's a lot of money in the city that we're not using correctly.

2135
02:49:04,008 --> 02:49:05,669
[SPEAKER_40]: We have seen it over and over again.

2136
02:49:05,749 --> 02:49:18,734
[SPEAKER_40]: We've talked about, just to have the fact that you have $9 million of free cash at the end of the year, your budget season, to get certified, that just speaks volumes of mismanagement of fiscal funds.

2137
02:49:19,934 --> 02:49:31,999
[SPEAKER_40]: Remember, when you sit there and you set that budget, that budget is set, let's say 100 million, and then you only spend 90 million, that means you didn't do something right.

2138
02:49:33,072 --> 02:49:35,313
[SPEAKER_40]: That means you didn't use that money appropriately.

2139
02:49:36,673 --> 02:49:39,795
[SPEAKER_40]: It's the city's taxpayers' money.

2140
02:49:40,795 --> 02:49:43,236
[SPEAKER_40]: So when I say free cash, of course it's not free.

2141
02:49:43,736 --> 02:49:49,878
[SPEAKER_40]: It's our money that we've already paid the year before to balance our budget, to make our city run.

2142
02:49:53,500 --> 02:49:54,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Stroud.

2143
02:49:56,421 --> 02:49:57,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else on this question?

2144
02:49:59,682 --> 02:50:00,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, we'll go to the podium.

2145
02:50:02,748 --> 02:50:03,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it Simon?

2146
02:50:04,289 --> 02:50:06,730
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Simon, you might have to bend the microphone down a little bit.

2147
02:50:10,272 --> 02:50:11,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nevermind.

2148
02:50:11,313 --> 02:50:15,595
[SPEAKER_00]: What will happen to the teachers next year?

2149
02:50:18,657 --> 02:50:19,837
[SPEAKER_04]: A direct and simple question.

2150
02:50:20,117 --> 02:50:21,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone want to go on that?

2151
02:50:22,879 --> 02:50:23,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go.

2152
02:50:25,240 --> 02:50:26,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2153
02:50:26,866 --> 02:50:28,727
[SPEAKER_40]: Simon, thank you for coming up tonight.

2154
02:50:29,047 --> 02:50:35,371
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm so impressed with you coming to this podium, because there are so many scaredy cat adults, but you have the guts to come up.

2155
02:50:35,411 --> 02:50:37,432
[SPEAKER_40]: So I applaud you for that, okay?

2156
02:50:37,893 --> 02:50:40,774
[SPEAKER_40]: So I have family members that might be your teachers.

2157
02:50:41,575 --> 02:50:44,597
[SPEAKER_40]: I have children that went through the schools just like you did.

2158
02:50:45,157 --> 02:50:51,921
[SPEAKER_40]: And I know it's scary right now, because you're listening to grownups talk about, we're gonna cut positions, we're gonna hurt teachers.

2159
02:50:52,461 --> 02:50:53,702
[SPEAKER_40]: That's not the intent, my friend.

2160
02:50:54,810 --> 02:50:57,532
[SPEAKER_40]: We have a solution that's easy.

2161
02:50:57,912 --> 02:51:03,056
[SPEAKER_40]: We can use money that the city has saved, that can fix it right now, instead of going to a vote.

2162
02:51:03,096 --> 02:51:06,318
[SPEAKER_40]: That's something that Mr. Scarpelli asked for years, months and months ago.

2163
02:51:07,499 --> 02:51:16,285
[SPEAKER_40]: And when you come to this point, my friend, you have to understand, we wanna make sure that every single one of your teachers are back next year, because you know why?

2164
02:51:16,325 --> 02:51:16,925
[SPEAKER_40]: You deserve it.

2165
02:51:18,246 --> 02:51:19,347
[SPEAKER_40]: So thank you for coming up.

2166
02:51:20,347 --> 02:51:20,908
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

2167
02:51:22,210 --> 02:51:23,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2168
02:51:24,231 --> 02:51:25,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take this one, Simon.

2169
02:51:25,811 --> 02:51:27,812
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go to Anna, and then I'll go.

2170
02:51:27,832 --> 02:51:28,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Anna?

2171
02:51:30,473 --> 02:51:31,214
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks again.

2172
02:51:31,554 --> 02:51:36,876
[SPEAKER_26]: Always good to see young folks coming up here and asking these great questions.

2173
02:51:37,496 --> 02:51:44,759
[SPEAKER_26]: So I just want to talk a little bit about the difference between 7 and 8, Proposition 7, Proposition 8.

2174
02:51:46,040 --> 02:51:52,002
[SPEAKER_26]: And 7 is going to make sure that we provide the same resources and the same

2175
02:51:52,486 --> 02:51:56,129
[SPEAKER_26]: you know, budget, basically, that we have been providing.

2176
02:51:57,330 --> 02:52:14,785
[SPEAKER_26]: Prop eight is gonna be where we make sure that we can actually really do a little bit more, that we can take care of our teachers, that we can pay them better salaries, that we can pay paras better salaries, that we take care of them the way that they are taking care of you.

2177
02:52:16,086 --> 02:52:19,889
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's just a little bit about the difference between those two and why they're separate.

2178
02:52:21,854 --> 02:52:22,454
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Anna.

2179
02:52:23,295 --> 02:52:23,715
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2180
02:52:24,255 --> 02:52:24,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2181
02:52:24,795 --> 02:52:27,036
[SPEAKER_04]: And Simon, thank you for asking your question.

2182
02:52:27,056 --> 02:52:29,997
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you've been at a few of these meetings now and you've asked a few questions now.

2183
02:52:31,058 --> 02:52:44,843
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you remember some meetings from the springtime of the school committee where we were really worried about whether we were going to be able to keep all the teachers and the paraprofessionals and all the other people in your school who try to make your day a good day and make sure you learn something.

2184
02:52:45,743 --> 02:53:04,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we were able, uh, this year to keep most of those people by using the one-time funds that we're talking about, um, that the city had staved up, but in the long run, um, it's really difficult, uh, for us to keep that promise if we don't have the money to keep paying people.

2185
02:53:05,098 --> 02:53:12,804
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, question seven, as Anna noted, um, would allow us to make sure that we can keep everybody on, um,

2186
02:53:13,677 --> 02:53:18,321
[SPEAKER_04]: who's there now, we don't have to look at asking people to leave, firing people, laying people off.

2187
02:53:19,662 --> 02:53:32,332
[SPEAKER_04]: And question eight means that the city and the schools have a lot more opportunity to give our teachers and the people in your school the pay that they deserve to have more staff in the schools to help out in the classroom.

2188
02:53:33,633 --> 02:53:34,434
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we don't,

2189
02:53:34,870 --> 02:53:39,094
[SPEAKER_04]: see a yes vote on those two questions, it's going to be a lot harder for the city to do those things.

2190
02:53:39,214 --> 02:53:42,997
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, we're, we're going to do our best no matter what happens.

2191
02:53:43,118 --> 02:53:48,582
[SPEAKER_04]: And one hard thing about democracy that you might be learning pretty young is sometimes people don't agree with you.

2192
02:53:49,203 --> 02:53:51,745
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes people make a decision that you don't want them to make.

2193
02:53:51,905 --> 02:53:55,789
[SPEAKER_04]: And if that happens, we're going to do our very best to try to make sure that everything stays okay.

2194
02:53:56,470 --> 02:54:00,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but if people do say yes, it'll be easier for us to do that.

2195
02:54:01,014 --> 02:54:01,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2196
02:54:03,561 --> 02:54:04,041
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

2197
02:54:04,421 --> 02:54:04,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

2198
02:54:08,423 --> 02:54:08,723
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2199
02:54:10,584 --> 02:54:11,244
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to Zoom.

2200
02:54:11,805 --> 02:54:14,966
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Jess H. Name and address for the record.

2201
02:54:15,546 --> 02:54:17,447
[SPEAKER_04]: You have one minute to ask one question.

2202
02:54:19,708 --> 02:54:21,309
[SPEAKER_33]: Jess Gahalia, Four Lock Road.

2203
02:54:21,329 --> 02:54:28,272
[SPEAKER_33]: So what I'm hearing, if these go through, that there'll be more funding for the schools.

2204
02:54:29,753 --> 02:54:30,033
[SPEAKER_33]: Now,

2205
02:54:32,330 --> 02:54:38,193
[SPEAKER_33]: My son who started sixth grade this year still can't read, first grade reading level.

2206
02:54:38,873 --> 02:54:44,536
[SPEAKER_33]: The school denied meeting with me for a reading tutor for him one-on-one.

2207
02:54:45,116 --> 02:54:50,618
[SPEAKER_33]: He's in a class with 11 kids trying to learn to read, which doesn't work.

2208
02:54:51,559 --> 02:54:58,302
[SPEAKER_33]: So is this something that if this goes through, the schools will have more funding and maybe my son could get a tutor to learn how to read?

2209
02:54:59,295 --> 02:55:02,758
[SPEAKER_33]: He's been an IEP with the Medford School since he was three years old.

2210
02:55:05,281 --> 02:55:06,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your question.

2211
02:55:06,422 --> 02:55:12,087
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to Councilor Collins and Councilor Lazzaro.

2212
02:55:13,008 --> 02:55:13,348
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2213
02:55:13,408 --> 02:55:15,951
[SPEAKER_24]: Just in brief, obviously we know

2214
02:55:17,418 --> 02:55:17,939
[SPEAKER_24]: That's really tough.

2215
02:55:18,199 --> 02:55:22,764
[SPEAKER_24]: And we know that the student experience coming out of the pandemic when so much critical in classroom learning time was missed.

2216
02:55:23,184 --> 02:55:23,765
[SPEAKER_24]: That's really tough.

2217
02:55:23,985 --> 02:55:25,687
[SPEAKER_24]: It's really tough for a lot of students feel for you.

2218
02:55:28,089 --> 02:55:38,159
[SPEAKER_24]: I will just say that I know the topic of literacy coaches in classroom specifically came up a lot in school committee budget meetings and city council budget meetings.

2219
02:55:39,080 --> 02:55:45,884
[SPEAKER_24]: And as we were discussing, putting together these numbers for Proposition 7 and Proposition 8 specifically, because we know that that is such a need.

2220
02:55:47,184 --> 02:55:56,809
[SPEAKER_24]: One of my big concerns if the overrides don't pass is that we would not be able to bring online the literacy coaches that we know that students like your son really need more of in the schools.

2221
02:55:58,310 --> 02:56:07,935
[SPEAKER_24]: And if they do pass, we would be empowered to be able to have more of those coaches in the schools helping students make up for the time that they lost during the pandemic and just due to other factors.

2222
02:56:10,148 --> 02:56:10,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2223
02:56:10,708 --> 02:56:12,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lazzaro, two minutes.

2224
02:56:14,170 --> 02:56:17,853
[SPEAKER_29]: I just wanted to say that I'm sorry to hear about that situation.

2225
02:56:17,873 --> 02:56:30,400
[SPEAKER_29]: I actually know a lot of people who have kids with learning disabilities in the schools that struggle similarly, and I know it's a big hill to overcome.

2226
02:56:31,192 --> 02:56:34,394
[SPEAKER_29]: and it's a lot to grapple with and it's really frustrating.

2227
02:56:34,735 --> 02:56:36,476
[SPEAKER_29]: And I know we have a lot of work to do.

2228
02:56:36,976 --> 02:56:42,220
[SPEAKER_29]: And I also think this is a school committee question and it's not something that we on city council grapple with very much.

2229
02:56:43,661 --> 02:56:52,387
[SPEAKER_29]: And I don't think that we're equipped to answer it fully, but I feel for you and it's really hard.

2230
02:56:54,048 --> 02:56:57,431
[SPEAKER_29]: And I would recommend bringing it up

2231
02:56:57,799 --> 02:57:02,861
[SPEAKER_29]: to school committee asking if you could get something like that on the agenda or speaking to the school superintendent.

2232
02:57:02,981 --> 02:57:05,042
[SPEAKER_29]: I know it can be super, super frustrating.

2233
02:57:05,082 --> 02:57:06,663
[SPEAKER_29]: I have friends with advocates.

2234
02:57:06,783 --> 02:57:07,583
[SPEAKER_29]: It's really hard.

2235
02:57:07,603 --> 02:57:08,563
[SPEAKER_29]: It's really expensive.

2236
02:57:08,944 --> 02:57:16,226
[SPEAKER_29]: It's really unequitable because if you have money, you can hire somebody to either be a tutor or get an advocate.

2237
02:57:16,286 --> 02:57:17,727
[SPEAKER_29]: It's really horrible.

2238
02:57:17,847 --> 02:57:18,888
[SPEAKER_29]: It's a bad system.

2239
02:57:19,448 --> 02:57:21,629
[SPEAKER_29]: Literacy is so complicated and difficult.

2240
02:57:21,689 --> 02:57:23,249
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'm really sorry you're going through that.

2241
02:57:26,270 --> 02:57:27,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else on this question?

2242
02:57:31,384 --> 02:57:42,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I can just note quickly that the one-time funds used to avoid cuts this year that were postponed saved two literacy interventionists.

2243
02:57:42,851 --> 02:57:48,915
[SPEAKER_04]: I think two positions were eliminated and those could be restored.

2244
02:57:49,816 --> 02:57:56,180
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also talk about the curriculum around literacy and what that would take to implement.

2245
02:57:56,741 --> 02:57:58,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I do agree with Councilor Lazzaro that, you know,

2246
02:57:59,775 --> 02:58:03,638
[SPEAKER_04]: talking to school committee, school administration, they'd be able to provide more information and details.

2247
02:58:04,359 --> 02:58:15,729
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if either of those solutions would help your child or your specific situation, but I do know that paying our paraprofessionals more to reduce turnover, help students with disabilities.

2248
02:58:15,909 --> 02:58:24,156
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that investing more in interventionists and specialists helps our students with disabilities and the school having more resources to do that would help.

2249
02:58:25,658 --> 02:58:25,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2250
02:58:32,793 --> 02:58:35,199
[SPEAKER_04]: The person on Zoom is Micah Kesselman.

2251
02:58:36,162 --> 02:58:37,626
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll go back to the podium.

2252
02:58:38,047 --> 02:58:39,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record.

2253
02:58:39,130 --> 02:58:40,754
[SPEAKER_04]: You have one minute to ask one question.

2254
02:58:45,540 --> 02:58:48,402
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm a little taller than the one before me.

2255
02:58:49,262 --> 02:58:50,763
[SPEAKER_35]: Cheryl Rodriguez, Park Street.

2256
02:58:51,864 --> 02:58:54,445
[SPEAKER_35]: I just wanted a little info before my question.

2257
02:58:54,865 --> 02:58:57,327
[SPEAKER_35]: Medford's in the top third per people spend for the state.

2258
02:58:57,867 --> 02:59:03,910
[SPEAKER_35]: If you factor in the residential exemption, Medford is on the same level as Somerville and Malden for taxation.

2259
02:59:03,930 --> 02:59:05,911
[SPEAKER_35]: In 2022-23 school year, in March 1st of 2024,

2260
02:59:10,874 --> 02:59:16,878
[SPEAKER_35]: 103 ELL students were added, bringing our percentage of ELL students up from a stable 10% to 15%.

2261
02:59:17,099 --> 02:59:22,342
[SPEAKER_35]: These students are very costly to educate, probably contribute to the issues that you're speaking of.

2262
02:59:22,422 --> 02:59:24,123
[SPEAKER_35]: The state should be stepping in to help us.

2263
02:59:24,624 --> 02:59:28,847
[SPEAKER_35]: That is an enormous increase of students that are very expensive to educate.

2264
02:59:30,281 --> 02:59:34,424
[SPEAKER_35]: Two admins were added when the emergency free cash was added to our school budget.

2265
02:59:35,124 --> 02:59:42,209
[SPEAKER_35]: And the more money that we add to our school budget, the less state aid we'll get and our bill for the charter school will also increase.

2266
02:59:42,992 --> 02:59:55,941
[SPEAKER_35]: So my question is, if we can't pay for basics, why would we extend the school day and increase wages solely based on the extension of the school day, which is how question eight is written.

2267
02:59:56,701 --> 03:00:01,305
[SPEAKER_35]: When we can't pay raise the cover rate, because when the next contract comes up.

2268
03:00:02,318 --> 03:00:06,043
[SPEAKER_35]: we'll have to do the raises based on these inflated salaries that we can't afford.

2269
03:00:06,063 --> 03:00:13,554
[SPEAKER_35]: I got an answer from a school committee member today, and the answer was ultimately, the school committee will decide how this money is spent.

2270
03:00:14,696 --> 03:00:18,139
[SPEAKER_35]: So there's no guarantee that what's in the questions is actually even going to happen.

2271
03:00:19,440 --> 03:00:29,948
[SPEAKER_35]: Another one told me that the money that we will gain in the school department will be used to have conversations, and we can discuss wish list items.

2272
03:00:30,148 --> 03:00:35,112
[SPEAKER_35]: We're way over is the question about the question is, if we can't pay for basics.

2273
03:00:35,732 --> 03:00:44,522
[SPEAKER_35]: Why would we extend the school day and increase wages to reflect a longer working period when we can't pay the raises at current levels?

2274
03:00:44,802 --> 03:00:49,387
[SPEAKER_35]: This is, of course, contingent on if we're actually planning to follow the words and the questions.

2275
03:00:50,007 --> 03:00:50,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2276
03:00:51,869 --> 03:00:52,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone want to talk about that?

2277
03:00:54,872 --> 03:00:56,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan, two minutes.

2278
03:00:57,268 --> 03:00:57,548
[SPEAKER_26]: Sure.

2279
03:00:57,768 --> 03:01:01,069
[SPEAKER_26]: And again, these questions are better answered by school committee folks.

2280
03:01:01,129 --> 03:01:12,871
[SPEAKER_26]: My understanding is that you can't really compare what our entire school budget is to other cities very well, because other cities don't include a lot of the things that we include in the school budget.

2281
03:01:12,911 --> 03:01:14,191
[SPEAKER_26]: So it's not apples to apples.

2282
03:01:14,991 --> 03:01:18,732
[SPEAKER_26]: And I wish I could rattle off all the things that are included and not included.

2283
03:01:18,792 --> 03:01:22,773
[SPEAKER_26]: The ones that I recall are, I think, IT, and now because of

2284
03:01:23,661 --> 03:01:30,123
[SPEAKER_26]: post COVID, there's just a lot more, you know, Chromebooks required for students and other IT related things.

2285
03:01:30,563 --> 03:01:34,944
[SPEAKER_26]: IT is often not included in school budgets in other cities, but it is included in our school budget.

2286
03:01:35,544 --> 03:01:41,006
[SPEAKER_26]: I think there are parts of building maintenance that are included in our school budget that are not included in other city school budgets.

2287
03:01:41,326 --> 03:01:47,568
[SPEAKER_26]: So while it appears, if you just look at the number, it appears that we spend more per student,

2288
03:01:49,005 --> 03:01:53,930
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't believe that that is an accurate way of looking at it simply because of the things that are and aren't included.

2289
03:01:54,670 --> 03:01:56,992
[SPEAKER_26]: And then I just wanted to comment about the school day.

2290
03:01:58,253 --> 03:02:00,556
[SPEAKER_26]: Unless I'm mistaken, please correct me if I'm wrong.

2291
03:02:01,216 --> 03:02:14,208
[SPEAKER_26]: We have one of the shortest school days of anywhere in the entire state that we are barely like a minute or two above the state absolute minimum for the number of minutes that children have to spend in school across the entire year.

2292
03:02:18,801 --> 03:02:25,506
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that's based on time on learning statistics issued by the district.

2293
03:02:27,187 --> 03:02:29,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I believe that's where the information is coming from.

2294
03:02:29,048 --> 03:02:30,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpaletti, two minutes.

2295
03:02:30,449 --> 03:02:31,290
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2296
03:02:32,010 --> 03:02:38,875
[SPEAKER_40]: To your point, Mr. Rodriguez, I think that this is why question eight, again, this is why these questions are so vague, right?

2297
03:02:39,255 --> 03:02:40,216
[SPEAKER_40]: That people are confused.

2298
03:02:40,885 --> 03:02:54,291
[SPEAKER_40]: because the determination of this $4 million is so we can align the vocational school building with the high school building so we can increase the day, so we can provide programming for both levels, right?

2299
03:02:54,912 --> 03:02:56,673
[SPEAKER_40]: So here's something.

2300
03:02:57,393 --> 03:02:58,553
[SPEAKER_40]: It hasn't been negotiated.

2301
03:02:58,914 --> 03:02:59,934
[SPEAKER_40]: It hasn't been discussed.

2302
03:03:00,915 --> 03:03:05,177
[SPEAKER_40]: So where is the money gonna go when it's not even entertained?

2303
03:03:06,137 --> 03:03:07,718
[SPEAKER_40]: These are the questions people have.

2304
03:03:08,902 --> 03:03:30,348
[SPEAKER_40]: The question that's $4 million, the state expert and former superintendent of Medford, Roy Belson, stated, if during negotiations, that's what we're looking for is to line those bells, then it's negotiations for the high school and vocational school teachers to increase their rate.

2305
03:03:33,015 --> 03:03:38,017
[SPEAKER_40]: Realistically, you're looking at $600,000 when you're looking to do that group, right?

2306
03:03:38,037 --> 03:03:40,938
[SPEAKER_40]: $4 million for what?

2307
03:03:41,299 --> 03:03:44,060
[SPEAKER_40]: Like we've said, more arts programs.

2308
03:03:44,260 --> 03:03:45,561
[SPEAKER_40]: We have art programs.

2309
03:03:46,141 --> 03:03:47,601
[SPEAKER_40]: The issue is aligning the bell.

2310
03:03:48,382 --> 03:03:49,602
[SPEAKER_40]: In programming, we have it.

2311
03:03:49,862 --> 03:03:51,423
[SPEAKER_40]: We just gotta line the bell.

2312
03:03:52,303 --> 03:04:02,108
[SPEAKER_40]: So again, it's so wide open to say $4 million to do arts and to align this process with the vocational school and the high school.

2313
03:04:02,990 --> 03:04:10,296
[SPEAKER_40]: is so vague, how can we even entertain voting on it when we know the ramifications to the rest of the community?

2314
03:04:11,897 --> 03:04:12,298
[SPEAKER_40]: Again, please.

2315
03:04:15,734 --> 03:04:17,435
[SPEAKER_40]: hear what was being said tonight.

2316
03:04:17,556 --> 03:04:19,297
[SPEAKER_40]: There are so many open-ended questions.

2317
03:04:19,737 --> 03:04:22,980
[SPEAKER_40]: There are so many issues that people don't know how we got here.

2318
03:04:23,561 --> 03:04:29,405
[SPEAKER_40]: We have FOIA requests that show that there was no proper discussions with school department members.

2319
03:04:29,926 --> 03:04:37,092
[SPEAKER_40]: When the school department isn't part of this financial task force for an override, and then a question like question eight comes up, it's so vague.

2320
03:04:37,952 --> 03:04:38,773
[SPEAKER_40]: Are we sure?

2321
03:04:38,793 --> 03:04:40,955
[SPEAKER_40]: Are we sure that we need an override?

2322
03:04:41,215 --> 03:04:41,856
[SPEAKER_04]: That's two minutes.

2323
03:04:41,956 --> 03:04:42,616
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

2324
03:04:42,837 --> 03:04:43,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2325
03:04:43,397 --> 03:04:45,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you please, next time, give me that 10 seconds.

2326
03:04:45,199 --> 03:04:45,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

2327
03:04:45,739 --> 03:04:47,241
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I appreciate it a little bit.

2328
03:04:47,261 --> 03:04:47,661
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2329
03:04:47,701 --> 03:04:48,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2330
03:04:48,702 --> 03:04:51,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, Councilor Tseng two minutes.

2331
03:04:51,525 --> 03:04:52,526
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be extremely brief.

2332
03:04:52,946 --> 03:05:07,019
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, because I think a lot of this is, has been said before, um, the way I view it is there's a question out there about why are we doing it twice when, you know, we need to do the basics and I, you know, question seven gives us the, the,

2333
03:05:07,399 --> 03:05:08,640
[SPEAKER_11]: ability to do the basics.

2334
03:05:09,060 --> 03:05:19,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Question eight allows us to think bigger picture and think about how we can improve the school system, not merely just matching status quo, but to exceed status quo.

2335
03:05:19,746 --> 03:05:23,708
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there are a variety of different perspectives on that specific policy.

2336
03:05:23,728 --> 03:05:25,449
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why we're opposing it to the voters.

2337
03:05:25,469 --> 03:05:26,930
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why we're letting voters vote on it.

2338
03:05:27,431 --> 03:05:27,611
[SPEAKER_11]: But

2339
03:05:28,615 --> 03:05:38,658
[SPEAKER_11]: we do need the money first to be able to engage in a real comprehensive renegotiation of what that school day looks like, of what programs we can offer.

2340
03:05:39,239 --> 03:05:43,080
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is just the point of disagreement between me and my fellow Councilor.

2341
03:05:43,960 --> 03:05:49,162
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Medford parents and Medford students know that our schools don't offer the same programming the other school districts do.

2342
03:05:49,713 --> 03:05:56,454
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Medford parents, Medford students know that we're falling short and that we have a lot of programming that we need to catch up on.

2343
03:05:56,974 --> 03:06:02,835
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, you know, we have great teachers doing arts programs, sports programs, coaches doing sports programs, et cetera.

2344
03:06:03,316 --> 03:06:03,836
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great.

2345
03:06:04,396 --> 03:06:09,017
[SPEAKER_11]: But the question is, are we where we should be comprehensively?

2346
03:06:09,717 --> 03:06:14,858
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we've already had to merge drama classes to cut offerings in the arts in the last budget.

2347
03:06:15,598 --> 03:06:16,258
[SPEAKER_11]: The question is,

2348
03:06:17,925 --> 03:06:23,128
[SPEAKER_11]: do we stay there, do we keep with that, or do we expand our offerings for our children?

2349
03:06:24,149 --> 03:06:25,229
[SPEAKER_40]: Where does it say that though?

2350
03:06:25,249 --> 03:06:26,350
[SPEAKER_40]: Because that's eloquent.

2351
03:06:27,450 --> 03:06:29,872
[SPEAKER_40]: You would have to look at it if it was presented that way.

2352
03:06:30,312 --> 03:06:31,192
[SPEAKER_40]: Again, it wasn't.

2353
03:06:31,793 --> 03:06:32,113
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

2354
03:06:32,753 --> 03:06:33,073
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

2355
03:06:33,133 --> 03:06:41,298
[SPEAKER_35]: I'd just like to follow up, if she's done, about the question on the difference in the students and the cost per student per year.

2356
03:06:41,818 --> 03:06:42,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

2357
03:06:44,099 --> 03:06:49,541
[SPEAKER_35]: Councilor Callahan mentioned that the students' differences are calculated based on different amounts.

2358
03:06:50,121 --> 03:06:53,962
[SPEAKER_35]: But when I looked at the data, Medford appeared in the top third for the entire state.

2359
03:06:54,282 --> 03:06:59,724
[SPEAKER_35]: The schools that were below it were approximately $6,000 to $8,000 less per student.

2360
03:07:00,104 --> 03:07:07,206
[SPEAKER_35]: Even if we factored in the tech spend of $500,000 that the councilor mentioned, that only averages out to about $1,000 per student.

2361
03:07:09,227 --> 03:07:15,653
[SPEAKER_35]: So I haven't seen any evidence that Medford is spending significantly less than other schools, that we're not spending enough.

2362
03:07:15,773 --> 03:07:22,680
[SPEAKER_35]: I know no one answered about the whole increase in the ELL students, but these are factors that are actually impacting our budget.

2363
03:07:23,040 --> 03:07:25,263
[SPEAKER_35]: And if the council, we're not going to catch up.

2364
03:07:25,323 --> 03:07:28,145
[SPEAKER_35]: There's another 15 ELL students waiting to join those schools.

2365
03:07:28,566 --> 03:07:31,769
[SPEAKER_35]: And if we don't get more money from the state, this override is going to be nothing.

2366
03:07:32,119 --> 03:07:32,579
[SPEAKER_35]: It's good.

2367
03:07:32,639 --> 03:07:33,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2368
03:07:33,280 --> 03:07:34,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lazzaro, two minutes.

2369
03:07:35,542 --> 03:07:37,643
[SPEAKER_29]: I, I, I'm confused.

2370
03:07:37,804 --> 03:07:41,967
[SPEAKER_29]: Are you saying that we shouldn't be accepting English language learners into our schools?

2371
03:07:42,597 --> 03:07:45,899
[SPEAKER_35]: No, I literally said they are very expensive.

2372
03:07:45,939 --> 03:07:46,740
[SPEAKER_29]: They're expensive.

2373
03:07:46,760 --> 03:07:49,222
[SPEAKER_29]: We're not going to do back and forth.

2374
03:07:49,402 --> 03:07:50,483
[SPEAKER_29]: That's not what we're doing here.

2375
03:07:50,503 --> 03:07:51,904
[SPEAKER_29]: We're asking questions about the overage.

2376
03:07:51,924 --> 03:07:56,787
[SPEAKER_29]: We're not talking about how English language learners are expensive for our schools.

2377
03:07:56,827 --> 03:07:58,408
[SPEAKER_29]: This is a public school district.

2378
03:07:58,428 --> 03:07:59,649
[SPEAKER_29]: That is not something that we're doing.

2379
03:07:59,729 --> 03:08:00,770
[SPEAKER_29]: That's not acceptable.

2380
03:08:00,790 --> 03:08:02,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just take a pause here.

2381
03:08:04,153 --> 03:08:05,474
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been three hours.

2382
03:08:05,494 --> 03:08:07,295
[SPEAKER_35]: The state should be helping pay for those students.

2383
03:08:07,315 --> 03:08:08,156
[SPEAKER_04]: The state formula doesn't work.

2384
03:08:08,176 --> 03:08:09,096
[SPEAKER_35]: That's not what we do.

2385
03:08:09,136 --> 03:08:09,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, everyone.

2386
03:08:09,917 --> 03:08:10,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I speak, please?

2387
03:08:10,757 --> 03:08:11,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2388
03:08:12,637 --> 03:08:13,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you everyone.

2389
03:08:13,718 --> 03:08:15,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Three hours in, we've been pretty good.

2390
03:08:15,338 --> 03:08:17,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate everybody.

2391
03:08:17,459 --> 03:08:19,340
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had a difficult conversation.

2392
03:08:20,781 --> 03:08:23,542
[SPEAKER_35]: But council shouldn't be attacking residents.

2393
03:08:23,642 --> 03:08:26,964
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anyone, I think there's been a lot of back and forth.

2394
03:08:27,244 --> 03:08:29,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheryl, I don't want to talk about commenting on aggressiveness.

2395
03:08:30,505 --> 03:08:32,526
[SPEAKER_04]: We can interpret people's comments in many ways.

2396
03:08:32,726 --> 03:08:33,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you would agree.

2397
03:08:33,907 --> 03:08:36,708
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want unfavorable interpretation of your comments and neither does councilor Zara.

2398
03:08:36,728 --> 03:08:37,789
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we're going to leave it at that.

2399
03:08:38,547 --> 03:08:41,068
[SPEAKER_35]: So I hope that this council will advocate for more state money.

2400
03:08:41,088 --> 03:08:42,648
[SPEAKER_04]: To your point, we do.

2401
03:08:42,728 --> 03:08:44,569
[SPEAKER_04]: We constantly advocate for more state money.

2402
03:08:44,649 --> 03:08:49,931
[SPEAKER_04]: To your point, and I'm putting my two minutes on now, the state formula is not good for Medford.

2403
03:08:50,511 --> 03:08:57,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Even with the Student Opportunity Act, even with Chapter 70 money, given the charter formula, given the reimbursement formula, it's bad for Medford.

2404
03:08:57,513 --> 03:09:04,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Even with a 5% increase in ELL, which is one of the big sources of funding in the Chapter 70 formula, we're not getting a lot more.

2405
03:09:05,196 --> 03:09:07,957
[SPEAKER_04]: The main reason for that is because of our estimated

2406
03:09:08,410 --> 03:09:12,432
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, minimum contribution as a city, what the state plans to give us.

2407
03:09:12,572 --> 03:09:17,835
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of that is based on what is the city's capacity to pay for things itself versus the state.

2408
03:09:18,336 --> 03:09:22,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Malden gets $60 million a year in net aid for their schools.

2409
03:09:22,638 --> 03:09:23,039
[SPEAKER_04]: We get 11.

2410
03:09:26,359 --> 03:09:34,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, you know, I would, I would love to, I would love if the formula treated us better, but it doesn't because essentially because of our property values.

2411
03:09:34,549 --> 03:09:42,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to get to your point, um, specifically on these questions, question eight, it's not just for the high school schedule.

2412
03:09:43,740 --> 03:09:44,741
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that's one thing.

2413
03:09:45,131 --> 03:09:46,152
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of three things.

2414
03:09:46,232 --> 03:09:50,375
[SPEAKER_04]: It's high school schedule alignment so that vocational and arts kids can do both.

2415
03:09:51,036 --> 03:10:01,725
[SPEAKER_04]: It's expanding classroom instructional opportunities district-wide, whether that means more staff or more teachers, and it's classroom teacher and paraprofessional compensation, so paying existing staff more.

2416
03:10:03,070 --> 03:10:04,891
[SPEAKER_35]: I was told it was to extend the day.

2417
03:10:05,952 --> 03:10:06,993
[SPEAKER_04]: I can read you the question.

2418
03:10:07,113 --> 03:10:25,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Shall the city of Medford be allowed to assess an additional $4 million in real estate and personal property taxes for FY 25 general operations of the Medford Public Schools to create a high school schedule that increases access to arts and vacational programming, expand classroom instructional opportunities, and for classroom teacher and paraprofessional compensation for the fiscal year beginning July 1st, 2024?

2419
03:10:26,570 --> 03:10:27,591
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the whole question.

2420
03:10:28,032 --> 03:10:29,453
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for all three of those purposes.

2421
03:10:29,980 --> 03:10:32,682
[SPEAKER_04]: The district spends 85% of its budget on salaries.

2422
03:10:33,143 --> 03:10:37,326
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason it's not more specific is because to get more specific would be to violate collective bargaining laws.

2423
03:10:37,746 --> 03:10:38,907
[SPEAKER_04]: All of that has to be bargained.

2424
03:10:39,628 --> 03:10:42,750
[SPEAKER_04]: So it gives us the money to have that conversation with our educators.

2425
03:10:43,491 --> 03:10:45,092
[SPEAKER_04]: And these have been ongoing questions.

2426
03:10:45,172 --> 03:10:48,775
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm really hopeful it passes because I'd like to pay our teachers more.

2427
03:10:48,815 --> 03:10:50,416
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to pay our paraprofessionals more.

2428
03:10:50,857 --> 03:10:52,278
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd also like to fix the school day.

2429
03:10:53,686 --> 03:10:55,687
[SPEAKER_35]: Well, community is very convenient.

2430
03:10:55,848 --> 03:10:56,608
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's move on.

2431
03:10:56,628 --> 03:10:58,570
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to move to the next question.

2432
03:10:59,330 --> 03:11:01,272
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to...

2432
03:10:59,330 --> 03:11:01,272
[SPEAKER_13]: We still have a City Council meeting to go to.

2433
03:11:01,292 --> 03:11:03,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt, let me run the meeting today.

2434
03:11:03,073 --> 03:11:04,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

2435
03:11:05,975 --> 03:11:09,417
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to the podium because the person on Zoom has already asked a question.

2436
03:11:09,437 --> 03:11:10,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Name, address, record.

2437
03:11:10,158 --> 03:11:10,698
[SPEAKER_04]: You have one minute.

2438
03:11:10,919 --> 03:11:12,460
[SPEAKER_46]: Hi, Bill Giglio on Winthrop Street.

2439
03:11:13,921 --> 03:11:18,164
[SPEAKER_46]: Would you agree that within the budget, I mean, we're saying that the school budget isn't

2440
03:11:19,517 --> 03:11:23,761
[SPEAKER_46]: very shortfall, very dire need, we're in very bad shape.

2441
03:11:25,203 --> 03:11:31,729
[SPEAKER_46]: Would you agree that every penny, every dime, every nickel will help that, will help the budget?

2442
03:11:32,270 --> 03:11:33,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the whole question?

2443
03:11:33,111 --> 03:11:34,251
[SPEAKER_46]: No, it's not the whole question.

2444
03:11:34,351 --> 03:11:36,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I know the rest of the question.

2445
03:11:36,953 --> 03:11:39,175
[SPEAKER_46]: I mean, okay.

2446
03:11:39,255 --> 03:11:41,616
[SPEAKER_46]: I would imagine you would agree that every, every, every nickel.

2447
03:11:41,656 --> 03:11:42,457
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay.

2448
03:11:43,638 --> 03:11:54,885
[SPEAKER_46]: So, uh, you guys passed, um, a 146% raise for the school committee that no, it ended up being a little bit less than that in stretched out.

2449
03:11:55,566 --> 03:11:55,866
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay.

2450
03:11:56,746 --> 03:11:57,527
[SPEAKER_46]: And, um,

2451
03:11:59,554 --> 03:12:00,375
[SPEAKER_46]: What was I going to say?

2452
03:12:03,598 --> 03:12:04,479
[SPEAKER_46]: You threw me off here.

2453
03:12:05,621 --> 03:12:06,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you 10 more seconds.

2454
03:12:10,421 --> 03:12:17,606
[SPEAKER_46]: Did the financial task force during this whole thing, I mean, we've been hearing that the budget has been bad for a very, very long time.

2455
03:12:17,626 --> 03:12:28,954
[SPEAKER_46]: Did the financial task force step back and say, hey, listen guys, this probably isn't a good time right now because this money comes out of the school budget, which it does, correct?

2456
03:12:29,415 --> 03:12:30,516
[SPEAKER_46]: It comes out of the school budget.

2457
03:12:30,556 --> 03:12:32,177
[SPEAKER_46]: Those raises came out of the school budget.

2458
03:12:32,457 --> 03:12:35,119
[SPEAKER_46]: It was an enormous raise and

2459
03:12:35,765 --> 03:12:43,450
[SPEAKER_46]: Did anyone from the financial task force say now is probably not the best time to be giving school committee members raises?

2460
03:12:43,731 --> 03:12:44,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the question.

2461
03:12:44,651 --> 03:12:46,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anyone want to go for it?

2462
03:12:46,613 --> 03:12:48,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins, two minutes.

2463
03:12:48,814 --> 03:12:49,134
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2464
03:12:49,234 --> 03:12:50,035
[SPEAKER_24]: Appreciate the question.

2465
03:12:50,115 --> 03:12:50,455
[SPEAKER_46]: Absolutely.

2466
03:12:53,024 --> 03:13:04,350
[SPEAKER_24]: I am normally actually and every single penny every single nickel counts type of person in my household budget, certainly, you know, we take every penny very seriously and municipal budgeting because this is our collective wealth to do with.

2467
03:13:08,789 --> 03:13:18,631
[SPEAKER_24]: in all of the discussions in public meetings, city council meetings, school committee meetings, task force meetings around what is the number that we should put forward that we're asking people to vote for to invest in the schools.

2468
03:13:19,931 --> 03:13:29,673
[SPEAKER_24]: I spent a lot of those meetings advocating for a much, much, much higher number than just 7.5 to be spread around the DPW and the schools and other expenses, but mostly the schools, right?

2469
03:13:30,293 --> 03:13:36,134
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think when we're having those discussions that are essentially landing at this is the minimum amount that we can

2470
03:13:36,909 --> 03:13:44,271
[SPEAKER_24]: try to invest in our schools to have to at least hold the line and prime the pump for them then getting better in the future.

2471
03:13:44,331 --> 03:13:51,514
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe not even get better this year, but at least keep them from backsliding so we can hope to have them improve in future fiscal years.

2472
03:13:52,454 --> 03:13:58,236
[SPEAKER_24]: When $7 million is the scope of the investment, that is essentially the minimum for not backsliding.

2473
03:13:59,576 --> 03:14:03,498
[SPEAKER_24]: You put that against a 2% COLA for certain electeds.

2474
03:14:04,372 --> 03:14:08,693
[SPEAKER_24]: and bringing up other electeds to not even parity with that position.

2475
03:14:09,773 --> 03:14:14,074
[SPEAKER_24]: I think if we're having an honest discussion, we can all look at that and say apples and oranges.

2476
03:14:15,715 --> 03:14:17,615
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm not trying to be disrespectful.

2477
03:14:17,635 --> 03:14:18,555
[SPEAKER_24]: That's my honest opinion.

2478
03:14:18,775 --> 03:14:20,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else want to go on this question?

2479
03:14:24,257 --> 03:14:25,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else on the question?

2480
03:14:25,237 --> 03:14:26,917
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2481
03:14:28,278 --> 03:14:30,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just say for one bill, I'll go.

2482
03:14:30,998 --> 03:14:33,379
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's actually a symptom of the same problem.

2483
03:14:34,298 --> 03:14:44,233
[SPEAKER_04]: to go 25 years without addressing and correcting that issue is the same reason that we're talking about all the other deferred questions, deferred issues, deferred things in the scope of it.

2484
03:14:44,253 --> 03:14:45,816
[SPEAKER_46]: 25 years of what?

2485
03:14:45,996 --> 03:14:46,577
[SPEAKER_46]: 25 years.

2486
03:14:46,737 --> 03:14:49,061
[SPEAKER_04]: 25 years of not adjusting that compensation amount.

2487
03:14:49,426 --> 03:14:49,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

2488
03:14:49,747 --> 03:14:52,611
[SPEAKER_04]: It went from 2000 to 2024 without being adjusted.

2489
03:14:52,791 --> 03:14:52,991
[SPEAKER_46]: Right.

2490
03:14:53,452 --> 03:14:55,735
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think it's actually a symptom of the same problem.

2491
03:14:55,755 --> 03:14:58,079
[SPEAKER_46]: You still have four new members that are on that board.

2492
03:14:58,179 --> 03:14:58,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to discuss.

2493
03:14:59,701 --> 03:15:01,143
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking in the big picture, Bill.

2494
03:15:01,945 --> 03:15:04,689
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about on every single thing.

2495
03:15:06,425 --> 03:15:16,154
[SPEAKER_04]: basically every single thing in the city, water, sewer, school buildings, fire station, funding of the DPW staff, funding of paraprofessional pay, the school day, the vocational.

2496
03:15:16,255 --> 03:15:21,580
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I could give you a 30 point litany list of things that the city spent 20 or 30 or 40 years not fixing.

2497
03:15:23,837 --> 03:15:24,538
[SPEAKER_04]: This was one of them.

2498
03:15:24,658 --> 03:15:25,719
[SPEAKER_04]: It was within our authority.

2499
03:15:25,799 --> 03:15:27,421
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a symptom of that larger problem.

2500
03:15:27,922 --> 03:15:29,023
[SPEAKER_04]: We fixed that one thing.

2501
03:15:29,484 --> 03:15:32,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're asking the voters to fix a larger set of problems.

2502
03:15:32,587 --> 03:15:34,189
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think those things are incongruous.

2503
03:15:34,229 --> 03:15:35,090
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just my opinion.

2504
03:15:35,631 --> 03:15:36,652
[SPEAKER_04]: And I appreciate your question.

2505
03:15:37,112 --> 03:15:39,555
[SPEAKER_40]: If I can, Mr. President.

2506
03:15:41,059 --> 03:15:42,159
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

2507
03:15:43,000 --> 03:16:04,806
[SPEAKER_40]: I missed most of the question, Bill, but again, like we're saying, we're hearing a systemic issue that's been happening for years, but the way the process, and I'll say again, the way the process has come forth, the way the process has come full circle right now, it's putting so many people, so many residents in flux and fear, right?

2508
03:16:05,586 --> 03:16:07,388
[SPEAKER_40]: And I think that's the biggest concern.

2509
03:16:07,448 --> 03:16:16,315
[SPEAKER_40]: I think the way that we've moved forward, that this group has moved forward to present an out, that really isn't an out like they've said.

2510
03:16:16,735 --> 03:16:18,717
[SPEAKER_40]: It's not gonna really help, right?

2511
03:16:19,117 --> 03:16:20,358
[SPEAKER_40]: We don't know where the money's going.

2512
03:16:20,498 --> 03:16:22,560
[SPEAKER_40]: Things are still questioned for each question.

2513
03:16:23,521 --> 03:16:25,983
[SPEAKER_40]: It's not certainties, right?

2514
03:16:26,503 --> 03:16:29,185
[SPEAKER_40]: We've already heard from everybody that hasn't been part of the process.

2515
03:16:30,126 --> 03:16:33,189
[SPEAKER_40]: So again, why continue this?

2516
03:16:34,502 --> 03:16:37,364
[SPEAKER_40]: Why keep moving forward and understanding that we're hurting real people?

2517
03:16:37,985 --> 03:16:39,166
[SPEAKER_40]: We're hurting real residents.

2518
03:16:40,226 --> 03:16:43,409
[SPEAKER_40]: And when I said, I like, again, I'm talking about the children.

2519
03:16:43,489 --> 03:16:44,490
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm talking about the seniors.

2520
03:16:44,530 --> 03:16:45,611
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm talking about our renters.

2521
03:16:45,931 --> 03:16:47,232
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm talking about our homeowners.

2522
03:16:47,692 --> 03:16:52,416
[SPEAKER_40]: We're hurting a lot of people right now for something that quote unquote is so minimal.

2523
03:16:54,363 --> 03:16:58,827
[SPEAKER_40]: Because the truth of the matter is, this is so minimal and such cause such divide.

2524
03:16:59,327 --> 03:17:05,532
[SPEAKER_40]: What we're now seeing is, are we truly gonna look at the next question when we really need it properly?

2525
03:17:05,552 --> 03:17:12,117
[SPEAKER_40]: Or are we gonna look at it with caution and saying, I'm definitely gonna stand against it.

2526
03:17:13,818 --> 03:17:15,760
[SPEAKER_40]: I'll use a $200 million, $400 million high school down the line.

2527
03:17:18,163 --> 03:17:25,749
[SPEAKER_40]: Imagine if that process was done, how it would destroy homeowners right now, senior citizens, people on fixed incomes, it would destroy us.

2528
03:17:27,070 --> 03:17:29,472
[SPEAKER_40]: This is why this process has to be done in a better way.

2529
03:17:29,753 --> 03:17:30,874
[SPEAKER_40]: It shouldn't be done in a vacuum.

2530
03:17:32,495 --> 03:17:33,976
[SPEAKER_40]: So thank you, Mr. President.

2531
03:17:34,256 --> 03:17:34,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2532
03:17:35,077 --> 03:17:36,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else on this question?

2533
03:17:36,358 --> 03:17:38,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I see none.

2534
03:17:38,520 --> 03:17:40,261
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to the podium, name and address for the record.

2535
03:17:40,381 --> 03:17:42,303
[SPEAKER_04]: You have one minute to ask one question.

2536
03:17:43,010 --> 03:17:46,834
[SPEAKER_02]: My original question is ready to share, so I'll switch to another one.

2537
03:17:46,894 --> 03:17:55,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd just like to point out that, indeed, total expenditures per pupil in Medford are higher than in Stoneham, Everett, Arlington, Winchester, and Malden.

2538
03:17:55,922 --> 03:17:59,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Of our neighbors, only Somerville spends more per pupil than Medford.

2539
03:18:00,307 --> 03:18:07,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I just hope that the financial task force has focused on bureaucratic inefficiencies and inefficiencies in resource allocation.

2540
03:18:08,779 --> 03:18:14,404
[SPEAKER_02]: So my question is, the fiscal year 25 budget was approved at the June 11 City Council meeting.

2541
03:18:15,044 --> 03:18:20,829
[SPEAKER_02]: This means that there won't, there will not be any budget cuts to Medford Public Schools until at least July 2025.

2542
03:18:22,490 --> 03:18:28,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Moreover, Medford revenues are expected to be going up for fiscal year 26, that's without the overrides.

2543
03:18:28,034 --> 03:18:30,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, they will go up more with the overrides.

2544
03:18:32,238 --> 03:18:35,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Why should we then expect any budget cuts in the future?

2545
03:18:36,601 --> 03:18:36,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2546
03:18:38,086 --> 03:18:38,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone want to go on that?

2547
03:18:42,359 --> 03:18:43,542
[SPEAKER_04]: I really should be going last here.

2548
03:18:46,840 --> 03:18:57,966
[SPEAKER_40]: Well, I think if I can, Mr. President, I think when we've heard parents of the fear, right, that we're going to cut, I believe one school can remember saying it was 55 to 65 teachers.

2549
03:18:58,386 --> 03:19:04,429
[SPEAKER_40]: Then it was now 35 and the pain, the fear is going to be spread all over, right?

2550
03:19:05,089 --> 03:19:06,450
[SPEAKER_40]: Everybody's going to feel the pain.

2551
03:19:07,230 --> 03:19:09,732
[SPEAKER_40]: That was the comment that's gone out publicly by that school committee remember.

2552
03:19:10,432 --> 03:19:10,632
[SPEAKER_40]: Right.

2553
03:19:11,132 --> 03:19:14,034
[SPEAKER_40]: And I think what you're saying to this is saying that, you know,

2554
03:19:15,856 --> 03:19:22,759
[SPEAKER_40]: Are we gonna cut, a teacher's gonna be cut in January, January 2025, if the override fails in November?

2555
03:19:23,100 --> 03:19:24,100
[SPEAKER_40]: That's a question, I believe.

2556
03:19:24,860 --> 03:19:25,221
[SPEAKER_40]: I don't know.

2557
03:19:26,121 --> 03:19:37,226
[SPEAKER_40]: I don't know because in these questions, these override questions, you didn't say to cover the cost of 55 to 65 teachers that will be cut, not a question seven or question eight.

2558
03:19:37,326 --> 03:19:37,987
[SPEAKER_40]: I didn't see that.

2559
03:19:39,047 --> 03:19:44,310
[SPEAKER_40]: So that again leads to another example of

2560
03:19:45,660 --> 03:19:47,281
[SPEAKER_40]: Are we sure we know what we're voting on?

2561
03:19:47,301 --> 03:19:51,084
[SPEAKER_40]: And are we sure we need to move forward?

2562
03:19:51,344 --> 03:19:52,685
[SPEAKER_40]: And was this transparent enough?

2563
03:19:53,085 --> 03:19:58,829
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I might interrupt, so the fiscal year 2025 budget has already been passed.

2564
03:19:58,849 --> 03:20:01,911
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't, in general, there should be no cuts, even if it's over.

2565
03:20:01,971 --> 03:20:03,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, we're talking about the next budget.

2566
03:20:03,672 --> 03:20:04,733
[SPEAKER_40]: So clarity, thank you.

2567
03:20:04,793 --> 03:20:07,275
[SPEAKER_40]: So clarity, everyone, where's Simon?

2568
03:20:07,975 --> 03:20:11,176
[SPEAKER_40]: Your teachers aren't going to be cut this year, because that's the word going out.

2569
03:20:11,216 --> 03:20:12,776
[SPEAKER_40]: The word was at these meetings now, right?

2570
03:20:13,196 --> 03:20:13,937
[SPEAKER_40]: They will not be cut.

2571
03:20:13,957 --> 03:20:17,077
[SPEAKER_40]: There'll be no cuts until next fiscal year, next school year.

2572
03:20:17,097 --> 03:20:18,238
[SPEAKER_40]: But next fiscal year, we'll have more money.

2573
03:20:18,278 --> 03:20:18,998
[SPEAKER_40]: Next school year.

2574
03:20:19,618 --> 03:20:20,098
[SPEAKER_40]: Exactly.

2575
03:20:20,838 --> 03:20:23,499
[SPEAKER_40]: It'll give us time, because we had an opportunity, Gaston.

2576
03:20:23,539 --> 03:20:30,361
[SPEAKER_40]: We had an opportunity back in 2023, when we realized that we were using ARPA and ESSER funding

2577
03:20:31,101 --> 03:20:41,000
[SPEAKER_40]: to balance a budget of operations which you shouldn't that we know that but this council voted on a backroom deal that that's what happened and then they've moved forward with this financial task force so here we are right now 

2577
03:20:41,000 --> 03:20:42,000
[SPEAKER_02]: that was only 1.7  

2577
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:45,000
[SPEAKER_40]: 1.7 so all right so this is where we are right now 

2577
03:20:45,000 --> 03:20:47,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to not go back and forth guys 

2577
03:20:47,000 --> 03:20:50,000
[SPEAKER_40]: Oh I apologize... so this is... Thank you, I apologize 

2577
03:20:50,000 --> 03:20:55,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you um go to vice president Collins: two minutes 

2577
03:20:55,000 --> 03:21:00,881
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you and guess on I realize I may have misunderstood your question um with what fiscal year you were talking about but I know that

2578
03:21:02,916 --> 03:21:09,379
[SPEAKER_24]: Part of our discussion has been around the salaries that this year are currently on one-time funds that will expire.

2579
03:21:10,119 --> 03:21:18,922
[SPEAKER_24]: And putting forward the override questions as an on-ramp for those positions is, again, once that one-time funding that they're currently being funded by has been depleted.

2580
03:21:20,542 --> 03:21:28,245
[SPEAKER_24]: But in your clarification, I think that my point might have been usurped by something else that you were saying.

2581
03:21:28,265 --> 03:21:29,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you asking for a clarification?

2582
03:21:31,038 --> 03:21:31,558
[SPEAKER_24]: Only if you have one.

2583
03:21:31,578 --> 03:21:33,159
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're asking for a clarification, you can clarify.

2584
03:21:33,359 --> 03:21:34,179
[SPEAKER_24]: No, I'm good.

2585
03:21:34,599 --> 03:21:35,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, all right.

2586
03:21:37,281 --> 03:21:41,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to your point, to your question, yes, we're talking about fiscal 26.

2587
03:21:41,362 --> 03:21:44,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Teachers contract, Paris contract, both expired June 30, 2025.

2588
03:21:44,223 --> 03:21:49,506
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're talking about a new contract year and the increased pay for that would be on the new year.

2589
03:21:50,206 --> 03:21:53,847
[SPEAKER_04]: That's if there are no agreements or side agreements settled before then.

2590
03:21:53,867 --> 03:21:57,849
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're seeing significant costs, essentially,

2591
03:21:58,576 --> 03:22:10,228
[SPEAKER_04]: all of the two and a half increase and most of the new growth increase are being used to pay for fixed cost growth increases on things that we've already committed to do, either in contracts or where we have mandatory spending on health insurance and pensions.

2592
03:22:10,328 --> 03:22:13,111
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yes, this would be for fiscal 26.

2593
03:22:13,171 --> 03:22:20,659
[SPEAKER_04]: We're currently, once again, this year, we're doing basically what Councilor Scarpelli said, we're using one-time funds right now to cover the budget.

2594
03:22:21,144 --> 03:22:27,950
[SPEAKER_04]: to try to get us through to a point when we have reliable recurring revenue, which the financial task force has put forward in the form of these overrides.

2595
03:22:28,010 --> 03:22:35,176
[SPEAKER_04]: And if that is not available, that's when in the it's next year, but it's the budget process is going to happen from February to June upcoming.

2596
03:22:35,696 --> 03:22:36,817
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in the next few months.

2597
03:22:37,498 --> 03:22:38,939
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when those decisions will be made.

2598
03:22:38,959 --> 03:22:46,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And whether or not we know we have the reliable, sustainable revenue to pay for those things, or we don't is dependent on the override questions.

2599
03:22:47,967 --> 03:22:49,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan, two minutes.

2600
03:22:49,994 --> 03:23:01,498
[SPEAKER_26]: Just a super quick comment that teachers who are underpaid compared to how much they could make in other cities, they do think about whether the city is able to fund them the next year.

2601
03:23:02,738 --> 03:23:19,304
[SPEAKER_26]: So if we want people to stay, it's just healthier for us in terms of teacher morale and longevity to have, for them to know that the budget is there for their salaries for the next year, because people do try to think ahead

2602
03:23:20,057 --> 03:23:25,019
[SPEAKER_26]: you know, they're less, we'll just have more turnover, that's all, thanks.

2603
03:23:26,260 --> 03:23:26,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2604
03:23:27,721 --> 03:23:28,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else on the question?

2605
03:23:30,682 --> 03:23:32,323
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we'll go to another question.

2606
03:23:33,524 --> 03:23:37,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Still someone who's already asked on Zoom, so we'll go to first time question.

2607
03:23:38,946 --> 03:23:41,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Two minutes, or one minute, one question.

2608
03:23:41,487 --> 03:23:42,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address the record, please.

2609
03:23:42,637 --> 03:23:45,258
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm Paulette Vardabedian, 27 Central Ave., Medford.

2610
03:23:45,838 --> 03:23:58,561
[SPEAKER_28]: My understanding is that the Medford teachers' salaries are very competitive to surrounding cities, even Newton and Wellesley, and we have one of the best benefit packages in the state.

2611
03:23:59,602 --> 03:24:00,642
[SPEAKER_28]: Correct me if I'm wrong.

2612
03:24:01,263 --> 03:24:05,706
[SPEAKER_28]: not to say that we don't want to keep our good teachers, that's mandatory that we do do that.

2613
03:24:06,586 --> 03:24:23,798
[SPEAKER_28]: My question is that what have we done other than this 2.5% override, such as grants, growth, things like that, have we really expanded everything that we could do rather than having this 2.5% override?

2614
03:24:24,218 --> 03:24:29,982
[SPEAKER_28]: We've had, this override's gonna not only affect our taxes, it's gonna affect our excise taxes, our CP,

2615
03:24:31,681 --> 03:24:43,508
[SPEAKER_28]: CPA tax we've already had our water bills raised, how much can senior citizens, single person like me, put out the well is only so deep, and to top that off.

2616
03:24:43,808 --> 03:24:49,772
[SPEAKER_28]: This is a little off topic but how can you justify giving yourselves raises and the mayor giving herself a raise.

2617
03:24:50,325 --> 03:24:54,947
[SPEAKER_28]: when the taxpayers are doing nothing but give, give, give.

2618
03:24:55,467 --> 03:25:01,570
[SPEAKER_28]: Never in my life, in my career, have I ever said, I'm working so hard, I think I deserve a raise.

2619
03:25:01,930 --> 03:25:03,271
[SPEAKER_28]: It's just unconscionable.

2620
03:25:03,731 --> 03:25:14,697
[SPEAKER_28]: So my question is, what has the city council done to make it so we don't have to have this 2.5% override and still provide the city what it needs?

2621
03:25:15,197 --> 03:25:17,478
[SPEAKER_28]: And we need to do more.

2622
03:25:18,951 --> 03:25:19,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2623
03:25:19,471 --> 03:25:22,453
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go to Vice President Collins.

2624
03:25:22,473 --> 03:25:23,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Two minutes.

2625
03:25:24,554 --> 03:25:24,894
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2626
03:25:25,374 --> 03:25:26,174
[SPEAKER_24]: Really fair question.

2627
03:25:26,194 --> 03:25:27,315
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm glad that you asked it.

2628
03:25:27,775 --> 03:25:46,063
[SPEAKER_24]: In terms of what's directly within our purview as city councilors, I know for as long as I've been on the council, I'm in my second term now, we have been, I think, extremely focused on parts of our jurisdiction that relate directly to expanding commercial tax base, which is the ways that we can increase city revenue without going to residents.

2629
03:25:48,234 --> 03:25:51,054
[SPEAKER_24]: We've been talking a lot about our zoning project, especially recently.

2630
03:25:51,074 --> 03:25:52,635
[SPEAKER_24]: It didn't begin recently.

2631
03:25:52,655 --> 03:26:10,018
[SPEAKER_24]: We've been fighting for, I think, three terms, since longer than I've been on the council, to be able to work with a zoning consultant to do really smart, tailored zoning that will allow us to grow the parts of the city that people have been wanting to see growth in for years, so that we'll see what we wanna see there, and also be adding to our commercial tax base.

2632
03:26:10,078 --> 03:26:14,739
[SPEAKER_24]: And we've been starting to do that, and we're already starting to see the seeds of results on Mystic Ave.

2633
03:26:15,119 --> 03:26:17,439
[SPEAKER_24]: Of course, that revenue isn't gonna come online

2634
03:26:18,467 --> 03:26:32,236
[SPEAKER_24]: until like a longer timescale than we really, that's not, we don't see the rewards from that in one year, we see that in five, 10, 20 years, but that is directly within our jurisdiction, and we've been extremely focused on this council, on laying the groundwork for commercial tax-based growth.

2635
03:26:33,988 --> 03:26:52,778
[SPEAKER_24]: City Hall departments, I think, are really, one of the things that they're remarkable for is in grant-seeking, especially our Planning Development Sustainability Office, and I do know that every department in this city works really hard to get grant funding for some of its essential projects or other projects that we don't have to take those monies out of the operating budget.

2636
03:26:53,178 --> 03:26:55,879
[SPEAKER_24]: The City Council, whenever we can, we support those grants.

2637
03:26:57,080 --> 03:26:58,961
[SPEAKER_24]: We approve when that's within our jurisdiction.

2638
03:26:59,041 --> 03:26:59,761
[SPEAKER_24]: We try to support

2639
03:27:01,582 --> 03:27:07,785
[SPEAKER_24]: resources, funding for projects coming from not from residents, wallets, essentially.

2640
03:27:08,285 --> 03:27:13,207
[SPEAKER_24]: In addition, then there's the advocacy side and people bringing up, what is the state doing about this?

2641
03:27:13,267 --> 03:27:15,788
[SPEAKER_24]: What is the state paying and how are other players paying in?

2642
03:27:16,149 --> 03:27:22,992
[SPEAKER_24]: We constantly advocate for an increase in trying to remember what this UGGA actually stands for.

2643
03:27:23,012 --> 03:27:30,335
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it's unrestricted, like general aggregation, constantly advocating for the state to pay into cities like Medford

2644
03:27:30,755 --> 03:27:49,229
[SPEAKER_24]: more so that we can do more for our residents the way that the state would like us to do, constantly advocating for changes in the payment in lieu of tax agreement laws so that we can turn to institutions like Tufts and say, hey, you don't pay a lot of property tax, all of our other residents do, let's make this more fair, trying to pull what levers we can.

2645
03:27:49,249 --> 03:27:50,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins, I let you go way over, I'm sorry.

2646
03:27:50,910 --> 03:27:51,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2647
03:27:51,231 --> 03:27:52,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2648
03:27:52,912 --> 03:27:53,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2649
03:27:53,152 --> 03:27:53,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

2650
03:27:53,733 --> 03:27:57,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Leming, two minutes, then Councilor Lazzaro, then Councilor Tseng, then Councilor Scarpelli.

2651
03:27:58,720 --> 03:28:05,305
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, Councilor Collins said a lot of points that I was going to make, which is to get the bird's eye view.

2652
03:28:06,546 --> 03:28:09,448
[SPEAKER_13]: Most of this council is pretty, is fairly new.

2653
03:28:09,508 --> 03:28:11,289
[SPEAKER_13]: About half of us are in our first term.

2654
03:28:13,231 --> 03:28:20,296
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we are trying to lay the foundations for the further growth and development of the city.

2655
03:28:20,336 --> 03:28:24,599
[SPEAKER_13]: The most important thing, the most important component of that is the zoning overhaul.

2656
03:28:26,232 --> 03:28:41,804
[SPEAKER_13]: a couple of meetings ago, I brought up a linkage fee proposal which would essentially raise the fees that developers pay for the first time to the city for their developments for the first time in 30 years that passed this council six to one.

2657
03:28:41,824 --> 03:28:51,652
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that you'll find that we are intensely focused on the financials so that we will have growth for the next 10 years, for the next 20 years.

2658
03:28:52,312 --> 03:28:55,115
[SPEAKER_13]: In general, this city,

2659
03:28:56,278 --> 03:29:11,770
[SPEAKER_13]: a lot of the political history of this city has been sort of attempting to kick the can down the road or just say, oh, or just come up with like vague ways to say, oh, we should all come together and find solutions, but not actually ever backing anything.

2660
03:29:11,790 --> 03:29:21,798
[SPEAKER_13]: This council is actually laying the foundations and passing actual ordinances and legislation so that we won't have to worry about that in the future.

2661
03:29:23,379 --> 03:29:32,908
[SPEAKER_13]: So yes, we are building a foundation that should have been built a very long time ago, and these overrides are really meant to address more short-term concerns.

2662
03:29:33,108 --> 03:29:33,649
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

2663
03:29:34,710 --> 03:29:35,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2664
03:29:38,697 --> 03:29:39,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng, two minutes.

2665
03:29:40,137 --> 03:29:40,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Or did I get that?

2666
03:29:40,798 --> 03:29:41,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Or was it Councilor Lazzaro?

2667
03:29:42,058 --> 03:29:42,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lazzaro, two minutes.

2668
03:29:42,958 --> 03:29:47,459
[SPEAKER_29]: It was me, but I was just gonna mention Councilor Leming's linkage fees, which he mentioned, so.

2669
03:29:47,600 --> 03:29:48,920
[SPEAKER_11]: Great, Councilor Tseng, two minutes.

2670
03:29:49,080 --> 03:29:49,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2671
03:29:49,780 --> 03:29:51,661
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to speak to the grant part of things.

2672
03:29:51,861 --> 03:29:58,883
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, as President Baird said before, our city departments work very, very hard to apply to as many grants as possible.

2673
03:29:59,323 --> 03:30:04,944
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think when we think about applying to grants, which I'm totally behind, I think we should do, we should maximize it.

2674
03:30:05,245 --> 03:30:06,465
[SPEAKER_11]: We also have to keep in mind that

2675
03:30:07,125 --> 03:30:15,028
[SPEAKER_11]: it takes a team of grant writers and grant managers after we get that grant to put that grant into practice and do all the reporting and counting that we need for that.

2676
03:30:15,428 --> 03:30:23,452
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that actually takes a lot of staff capacity on the city hall end right now that we don't have that general fund capacity for either.

2677
03:30:23,792 --> 03:30:26,033
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's, you know, another, I think, reason why

2678
03:30:26,533 --> 03:30:41,345
[SPEAKER_11]: paying attention to like increasing the revenue for our city government is so, so important, because it allows us to eventually, eventually gives us the freedom to, to have people in place to be applying to those grants that make more money over, over time.

2679
03:30:41,365 --> 03:30:44,387
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's kind of like a stone rolling down a mountain collecting dirt.

2680
03:30:46,880 --> 03:31:03,087
[SPEAKER_11]: I, another thing about grants though, is that oftentimes they're not over a long enough period of time for us to be able to retain the staff that we want to, as Councilor Callahan mentioned, like if you're a teacher, you want to make sure that you can stay in that position next year, that you're, you're having that job or else you're, you're applying to other jobs.

2681
03:31:03,167 --> 03:31:03,367
[SPEAKER_11]: Right?

2682
03:31:03,928 --> 03:31:07,049
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's the case when we apply for grants as well.

2683
03:31:07,749 --> 03:31:13,372
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why, you know, we have great workers in city hall hired on grants, but a lot of them don't,

2684
03:31:14,512 --> 03:31:17,095
[SPEAKER_11]: are looking for other jobs because they don't have that stability.

2685
03:31:17,495 --> 03:31:21,558
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we need to give our city that financial, in my opinion, that financial stability.

2686
03:31:22,499 --> 03:31:35,570
[SPEAKER_11]: On the points of competitive salaries, I think it's really important to also consider that our teachers are competing or our school systems competing with private schools as well.

2687
03:31:36,051 --> 03:31:38,113
[SPEAKER_11]: And that there's this, there's a race to

2688
03:31:38,773 --> 03:31:47,079
[SPEAKER_11]: to pay teachers more, to pay for diversity, all of that is affecting how our ability to retain our staff and to hire new staff as well.

2689
03:31:47,579 --> 03:31:53,003
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not to mention the district-specific characteristics that come out in a union bargaining sessions.

2690
03:31:53,063 --> 03:31:54,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

2691
03:31:55,505 --> 03:31:56,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2692
03:31:56,445 --> 03:31:56,906
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

2693
03:31:57,446 --> 03:32:00,208
[SPEAKER_40]: First, let's start off by the teachers and compensation.

2694
03:32:00,688 --> 03:32:05,632
[SPEAKER_40]: A good way to make sure they go is scare them with layoffs

2695
03:32:06,752 --> 03:32:08,893
[SPEAKER_40]: when you have an avenue to save them.

2696
03:32:09,853 --> 03:32:13,695
[SPEAKER_40]: But with this question, the truth of the matter is, in most communities, it's growth.

2697
03:32:14,215 --> 03:32:15,536
[SPEAKER_40]: Growth, growth, growth.

2698
03:32:16,096 --> 03:32:17,397
[SPEAKER_40]: New growth, smart development.

2699
03:32:17,957 --> 03:32:18,637
[SPEAKER_40]: That's what happens.

2700
03:32:19,178 --> 03:32:21,098
[SPEAKER_40]: That's what happened in neighboring communities like Somerville.

2701
03:32:21,639 --> 03:32:25,921
[SPEAKER_40]: During the pandemic, what happened in Everett, what happened in Malden, you saw new growth.

2702
03:32:27,021 --> 03:32:30,723
[SPEAKER_40]: I've heard my council colleagues say that it'll take us five to seven years to see that wrong.

2703
03:32:31,513 --> 03:32:46,938
[SPEAKER_40]: We had three 40B projects that not only would bring in valuable funding through permits and fees, and then the new tax base, but also open up an opportunity for what we lack here is affordable housing.

2704
03:32:48,178 --> 03:32:49,559
[SPEAKER_40]: And this mayor has voided that.

2705
03:32:50,899 --> 03:32:55,420
[SPEAKER_40]: So like I said, just one project, and I'll say it over and over again, because we've talked to the owner of the building.

2706
03:32:56,501 --> 03:33:00,522
[SPEAKER_40]: He put in a place for 40B projects, 400 units at the old gold gym site.

2707
03:33:01,861 --> 03:33:07,466
[SPEAKER_40]: $3 to $5 million just in permits would have come right to us, right away, $3 to $5 million for one project.

2708
03:33:07,927 --> 03:33:09,248
[SPEAKER_40]: And then you would see an increase.

2709
03:33:09,488 --> 03:33:16,114
[SPEAKER_40]: Once that's built, you would then have a tax base of more to $6 to $9 million coming in.

2710
03:33:17,115 --> 03:33:19,017
[SPEAKER_40]: Now what you saw is the mayor fight that.

2711
03:33:20,267 --> 03:33:22,968
[SPEAKER_40]: which is a 40B project, which you can't fight and win in court.

2712
03:33:23,008 --> 03:33:23,968
[SPEAKER_40]: We know that by law.

2713
03:33:24,528 --> 03:33:25,888
[SPEAKER_40]: She takes it to court, they lost.

2714
03:33:26,169 --> 03:33:29,649
[SPEAKER_40]: Then she brings it back and she appeals it.

2715
03:33:30,370 --> 03:33:39,592
[SPEAKER_40]: While we're paying lawyers, we lose the appeal, but at the same time, we now have these developers that have walked away to Medford because now they're in Watertown.

2716
03:33:39,892 --> 03:33:40,892
[SPEAKER_40]: Now they're in other neighborhoods.

2717
03:33:41,172 --> 03:33:47,014
[SPEAKER_40]: And this gentleman just lost $5 million by sitting on a property, hoping he could develop Medford the right way.

2718
03:33:47,844 --> 03:33:50,806
[SPEAKER_40]: The other piece we have right now, the mayor is, did everybody hear this?

2719
03:33:50,826 --> 03:33:53,748
[SPEAKER_40]: There's an RFP for five spots in Method Square.

2720
03:33:54,909 --> 03:33:55,609
[SPEAKER_40]: What's the plan?

2721
03:33:56,490 --> 03:33:57,070
[SPEAKER_40]: We don't know.

2722
03:33:57,090 --> 03:34:00,532
[SPEAKER_40]: This is again, lack of transparency and openness in this community.

2723
03:34:00,793 --> 03:34:01,133
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

2724
03:34:01,433 --> 03:34:01,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2725
03:34:01,913 --> 03:34:03,034
[SPEAKER_26]: If I can, oh, sorry.

2726
03:34:03,054 --> 03:34:03,735
[SPEAKER_26]: Go ahead.

2727
03:34:04,395 --> 03:34:05,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan, two minutes.

2728
03:34:06,367 --> 03:34:17,136
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I just um, so my understanding is that there are some numbers going around comparing Medford salaries with communities like Arlington, but actually just have an accurate numbers.

2729
03:34:18,497 --> 03:34:25,763
[SPEAKER_26]: And, and those are all public so you can actually go on the web and like look up those numbers so I encourage you to do that just to make sure that the numbers that you're seeing are accurate.

2730
03:34:25,783 --> 03:34:25,983
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks.

2731
03:34:26,863 --> 03:34:36,718
[SPEAKER_28]: I can just say that whatever happens in this override whether it passes or it doesn't just, I could just please to the city council think of the elderly member my vintage 1954, last time.

2732
03:34:40,728 --> 03:34:42,069
[SPEAKER_28]: We have a limited income.

2733
03:34:42,309 --> 03:34:50,213
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, I'm lucky I get a pension and my social security, but I don't know how long I can continue to live in Medford if it's going to continue to do that.

2734
03:34:50,253 --> 03:34:51,674
[SPEAKER_28]: And I don't think I speak for myself.

2735
03:34:51,934 --> 03:34:53,455
[SPEAKER_28]: So thank you for the work you do.

2736
03:34:53,755 --> 03:34:56,776
[SPEAKER_28]: And again, just think of the long-term citizens that are here.

2737
03:34:57,117 --> 03:34:57,657
[SPEAKER_28]: And thank you.

2738
03:34:58,137 --> 03:34:58,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2739
03:34:58,677 --> 03:35:03,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to, I did have a couple quick answers to your question too.

2740
03:35:04,491 --> 03:35:04,991
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay.

2741
03:35:05,411 --> 03:35:10,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Bill keeps posting online something I posted, I think about five years ago where I said, I don't think we need an override right now.

2742
03:35:10,994 --> 03:35:12,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to explore all the other options first.

2743
03:35:13,314 --> 03:35:15,575
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we did, we explored short-term rentals.

2744
03:35:15,615 --> 03:35:16,956
[SPEAKER_04]: We explored marijuana revenue.

2745
03:35:17,076 --> 03:35:22,298
[SPEAKER_04]: We started on the zoning, which has borne some fruit and will bear more, but not fast enough.

2746
03:35:23,598 --> 03:35:27,280
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we maxed out the local fees and stuff like,

2747
03:35:27,987 --> 03:35:31,789
[SPEAKER_04]: the hotel meals and rooms, et cetera, to the most, the state will let us do it.

2748
03:35:32,970 --> 03:35:37,732
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to get the state to open up the home roll petition so we can update the linkage fees for the first time in 30 years.

2749
03:35:38,393 --> 03:35:48,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a resolution on for a fee schedule update to look at the whole city fee schedule to which many of them haven't been updated in many years.

2750
03:35:48,478 --> 03:35:50,119
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to get a response back on that.

2751
03:35:50,640 --> 03:35:54,322
[SPEAKER_04]: All of that does not generate a significant enough amount of revenue to address the needs.

2752
03:35:54,742 --> 03:35:56,723
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I feel that

2753
03:35:57,327 --> 03:36:06,389
[SPEAKER_04]: in all the six years of budgets that I've worked on and everything else, my answer to the question is, we've looked at all the other buckets that we have control over.

2754
03:36:06,849 --> 03:36:10,830
[SPEAKER_04]: They're no longer sufficient to address the need, and that's why I support these overrides.

2755
03:36:10,910 --> 03:36:13,190
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's just one piece of it.

2756
03:36:14,070 --> 03:36:19,651
[SPEAKER_04]: On the development, Somerville started its significant summer vision plans 20, 25 years ago.

2757
03:36:20,092 --> 03:36:23,832
[SPEAKER_04]: They started seeing the first fruits of that in significant way 15 years ago.

2758
03:36:24,292 --> 03:36:26,033
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really boomed the last five to 10 years.

2759
03:36:27,333 --> 03:36:30,035
[SPEAKER_04]: We're at the beginning of that process, not the middle, not the end.

2760
03:36:30,255 --> 03:36:32,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish we'd started that 25 years ago.

2761
03:36:32,196 --> 03:36:38,581
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'd be much happier during budget season if we started that 25 years ago, because the decisions would be a lot easier.

2762
03:36:39,561 --> 03:36:40,342
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing it now.

2763
03:36:40,542 --> 03:36:41,522
[SPEAKER_04]: It's starting to happen.

2764
03:36:41,542 --> 03:36:43,584
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with Councilor Scarpelli.

2765
03:36:43,644 --> 03:36:49,308
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't agree with some of the legal proceedings that happened around 40Bs, but it's not the wholesome question here.

2766
03:36:50,348 --> 03:36:52,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Last thing I'll say, you started out with the teacher's compensation.

2767
03:36:54,141 --> 03:37:02,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Having talked to our teachers, having heard from our teachers union, our paraprofessionals union in this space and in the school committee, I know they don't feel like their compensation is sufficient and competitive.

2768
03:37:02,946 --> 03:37:05,888
[SPEAKER_04]: I know many of them feel pressure to leave for other districts.

2769
03:37:06,388 --> 03:37:16,394
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also know when it comes to benefits that there's been ongoing negotiation issues around the healthcare benefit for all of our employees, police, fire, DPW, city hall and the schools.

2770
03:37:16,494 --> 03:37:18,835
[SPEAKER_04]: So just wanted to put that perspective out there.

2771
03:37:19,235 --> 03:37:19,556
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

2772
03:37:19,816 --> 03:37:20,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2773
03:37:22,534 --> 03:37:24,035
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to the podium.

2774
03:37:24,195 --> 03:37:25,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

2775
03:37:25,476 --> 03:37:26,656
[SPEAKER_04]: One minute for one question.

2776
03:37:27,177 --> 03:37:28,637
[SPEAKER_31]: Danielle Marcelino, 11 Spencer Road.

2777
03:37:28,678 --> 03:37:30,419
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm local 1032's union president.

2778
03:37:31,399 --> 03:37:35,782
[SPEAKER_31]: I would first like to thank everybody who wants to see improvements made to the living conditions of the fire department.

2779
03:37:36,802 --> 03:37:48,529
[SPEAKER_31]: President Baez, you mentioned financial health earlier, which made me want to ask all of you if you genuinely feel that it is fiscally responsible to fund a $30 million project with all of the functional shortfalls that it has.

2780
03:37:49,002 --> 03:37:52,445
[SPEAKER_31]: that will not support any fire department growth while our city keeps growing.

2781
03:37:52,966 --> 03:38:08,180
[SPEAKER_31]: And if the building plan does come to fruition, where do you propose that we house all the firefighters who will need to be hired in order to meet our NFPA and soon to be OSHA safe staffing requirements that are based off of our population and the type of homes that we have here in the city?

2782
03:38:09,281 --> 03:38:09,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the question.

2783
03:38:10,001 --> 03:38:10,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone want to go for it?

2784
03:38:14,830 --> 03:38:15,150
[SPEAKER_29]: Really?

2785
03:38:15,411 --> 03:38:21,096
[SPEAKER_40]: Well, if I can, I think there's more involved here.

2786
03:38:21,156 --> 03:38:23,238
[SPEAKER_40]: I think that it's very clear and cut.

2787
03:38:23,338 --> 03:38:36,170
[SPEAKER_40]: I think the communities can see that our firemen and women do not want this override or this debt exclusion because it hurts our citizenry because the design and the building that they're looking to build is not adequate for any of them.

2788
03:38:37,350 --> 03:38:45,353
[SPEAKER_40]: We also have a firefighter standing in front of us that, so we all understand why we're in fiscal crisis, why we're in fiscal issues, right?

2789
03:38:47,294 --> 03:38:51,075
[SPEAKER_40]: Firefighter Masolino wrote a grant for 11 firefighters

2790
03:38:51,957 --> 03:39:02,081
[SPEAKER_40]: through FEMA, so the FEMA would pay these 11 firefighters for three years, as long as you didn't vary from those 11 firefighters.

2791
03:39:02,802 --> 03:39:09,965
[SPEAKER_40]: The mayor came in and said, at the end, the only caveat is you have to sustain those 11 firefighters to be at minimal level.

2792
03:39:10,925 --> 03:39:13,707
[SPEAKER_40]: The mayor came in and said, no, we'll only fund five or seven.

2793
03:39:14,247 --> 03:39:16,008
[SPEAKER_40]: Just by doing that, guess what happened?

2794
03:39:16,508 --> 03:39:21,190
[SPEAKER_40]: It voided the 11 firefighters that would have been paid for FEMA for three years.

2795
03:39:22,259 --> 03:39:37,311
[SPEAKER_40]: Again, this council, the mayor had a outside member doing evaluation to come in, and we spent $10,000 to start with this firefighter evaluator to come in and look at the fire station.

2796
03:39:37,931 --> 03:39:39,112
[SPEAKER_40]: We have yet to hear anything.

2797
03:39:39,272 --> 03:39:41,314
[SPEAKER_40]: From what I hear, that person's been gone now.

2798
03:39:41,374 --> 03:39:42,395
[SPEAKER_40]: No report, no nothing.

2799
03:39:43,374 --> 03:39:46,476
[SPEAKER_40]: This is the problem we see, the mismanagement of our community.

2800
03:39:46,996 --> 03:39:50,158
[SPEAKER_40]: It's not that we don't have, in certain cases, enough funding.

2801
03:39:50,678 --> 03:39:52,239
[SPEAKER_40]: It's how you manage those funds.

2802
03:39:52,699 --> 03:40:04,985
[SPEAKER_40]: So again, I thank you for everything you do, and we should not vote support this override, because our firefighters are saying, let's not hurt our residents, especially if it's an inferior product.

2803
03:40:06,306 --> 03:40:09,327
[SPEAKER_40]: We'll stay where we are, even though it's disgusting.

2804
03:40:10,608 --> 03:40:10,948
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

2805
03:40:13,621 --> 03:40:13,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else?

2806
03:40:13,981 --> 03:40:15,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Collins, two minutes.

2807
03:40:15,882 --> 03:40:16,102
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2808
03:40:16,122 --> 03:40:17,482
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to thank you for being here tonight.

2809
03:40:17,862 --> 03:40:22,623
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for your advocacy on this issue, and thank you for advocating for firefighters in general in Medford all the time.

2810
03:40:26,184 --> 03:40:27,384
[SPEAKER_24]: I understand that this is complicated.

2811
03:40:27,404 --> 03:40:34,186
[SPEAKER_24]: I also know that as a city council, we approach this at different levels of distance from just the dollars and cents of the proposal.

2812
03:40:34,944 --> 03:40:45,871
[SPEAKER_24]: And from the specifics of the fire headquarters proposal that is being worked out between the fire department, maybe fire department leadership is more accurate to say.

2813
03:40:46,252 --> 03:40:48,833
[SPEAKER_24]: And principally the mayor's office, we're not involved in that process.

2814
03:40:49,794 --> 03:40:56,919
[SPEAKER_24]: I can say for myself as one Councilor that after hearing for so many months and years, this is an improved headquarters is urgently needed, urgently deserved.

2815
03:40:57,541 --> 03:40:58,262
[SPEAKER_24]: the fire department.

2816
03:40:59,163 --> 03:41:03,368
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, that that is trying to bring that about as expeditiously as possible.

2817
03:41:03,428 --> 03:41:05,130
[SPEAKER_24]: It's my priority as a city Councilor.

2818
03:41:05,830 --> 03:41:18,485
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, I know from, you know, just following the publications of the, you know, kind of continually updated concept drafts that's put out by the mayor's office that, um, you know, at least from what I from what I'm able to see, it seems like feedback is

2819
03:41:18,945 --> 03:41:20,806
[SPEAKER_24]: continuing to be incorporated and updated.

2820
03:41:20,846 --> 03:41:23,107
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, I'm just sharing what's visible on my side.

2821
03:41:23,147 --> 03:41:25,869
[SPEAKER_24]: I know that there's another perspective that you represent.

2822
03:41:27,570 --> 03:41:42,698
[SPEAKER_24]: It is my sincere hope from hearing that this is so urgently needed for so long that we are able to see a truly collaborative process that results in the fire headquarters that the fire department needs, deserves, expects.

2823
03:41:44,719 --> 03:41:46,840
[SPEAKER_24]: that we can move on with this urgency.

2824
03:41:47,740 --> 03:41:50,301
[SPEAKER_24]: And, you know, I think that that's just what the community needs.

2825
03:41:50,501 --> 03:41:51,922
[SPEAKER_24]: Certainly that's what the fire department needs.

2826
03:41:51,962 --> 03:41:56,244
[SPEAKER_24]: And I hope that we can do that on a timeframe that we can move on it this year.

2827
03:41:56,924 --> 03:41:57,204
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2828
03:41:59,545 --> 03:41:59,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2829
03:41:59,745 --> 03:42:00,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else?

2830
03:42:01,065 --> 03:42:02,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lazzaro, two minutes.

2831
03:42:03,546 --> 03:42:09,010
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm currently serving on the committee that is working on the new high school.

2832
03:42:09,331 --> 03:42:28,265
[SPEAKER_29]: And when the MSBA is going to ask us to request a debt exclusion for the new high school, that's gonna be significantly more expensive than what the firehouse will cost.

2833
03:42:29,486 --> 03:42:32,588
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't think that we will be able to come back and ask

2834
03:42:33,063 --> 03:42:37,685
[SPEAKER_29]: for another debt exclusion for a firehouse at that time.

2835
03:42:37,825 --> 03:42:38,825
[SPEAKER_29]: I think it will take longer.

2836
03:42:39,525 --> 03:42:47,228
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think that there's a possibility that there could be an approved fire station between the two parties.

2837
03:42:48,469 --> 03:43:00,053
[SPEAKER_29]: Once this debt exclusion, if it is approved, then I think the money will be available and a satisfactory firehouse can be built, or there's the opportunity for it to be built.

2838
03:43:01,383 --> 03:43:11,311
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think time is of the essence because of the limited nature of the timeline, given that we have an urgency of the high school coming down the pike as well.

2839
03:43:12,292 --> 03:43:25,422
[SPEAKER_29]: We have a lot of people in town vying for very large projects heading our direction, and I think we have to balance a lot of people's needs all at once.

2840
03:43:27,123 --> 03:43:27,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2841
03:43:27,964 --> 03:43:28,244
[SPEAKER_29]: May I?

2842
03:43:28,604 --> 03:43:29,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Leming.

2843
03:43:30,931 --> 03:43:46,098
[SPEAKER_13]: So speaking a bit more of a bird's eye view of this, I do wish that things were better between the fire union and the mayor and that that process had gone better for both parties.

2844
03:43:46,218 --> 03:43:49,420
[SPEAKER_13]: And I am sorry at how that has evolved.

2845
03:43:49,500 --> 03:43:51,541
[SPEAKER_13]: My view of this is that

2846
03:43:53,078 --> 03:44:02,265
[SPEAKER_13]: even is that the debt exclusion is about funding and it's not, I don't see it as necessarily being tied to whatever plans come out.

2847
03:44:03,166 --> 03:44:04,687
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just how I view it.

2848
03:44:06,849 --> 03:44:08,410
[SPEAKER_13]: So that.

2849
03:44:08,971 --> 03:44:15,977
[SPEAKER_31]: So we want to fund a $30 million project that's going to fall flat on many, many fronts.

2850
03:44:16,417 --> 03:44:22,542
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't like, I understand that you all were not involved in the planning and I do not at all,

2851
03:44:23,427 --> 03:44:27,608
[SPEAKER_31]: you know, think that anybody could, you know, here had any say in that.

2852
03:44:28,188 --> 03:44:37,651
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, like I'm not blaming anybody, but this plan that we have right now in front of us, we were told is a minor adjustments, like the president said, correct?

2853
03:44:38,551 --> 03:44:44,913
[SPEAKER_31]: I've been speaking a minute, but any, so you said earlier that they were minor adjustments that were going to be able to be, be made.

2854
03:44:45,853 --> 03:44:49,334
[SPEAKER_31]: We have major issues with this building as it stands right now.

2855
03:44:50,017 --> 03:44:53,180
[SPEAKER_31]: which means that it will be a huge waste of money.

2856
03:44:53,220 --> 03:44:59,985
[SPEAKER_31]: And we're asking taxpayers to do that, to spend all this money on this building that is immediately going to be obsolete.

2857
03:45:00,326 --> 03:45:04,069
[SPEAKER_31]: We won't be able to expand our department, be able to add services.

2858
03:45:04,469 --> 03:45:05,870
[SPEAKER_31]: It has privacy issues.

2859
03:45:06,571 --> 03:45:12,176
[SPEAKER_31]: Nobody here should be running across a hallway in front of a whole bunch of people like undressed.

2860
03:45:12,296 --> 03:45:13,517
[SPEAKER_31]: Like that's just the way it is.

2861
03:45:13,997 --> 03:45:17,280
[SPEAKER_31]: I would love to sit down with all of you and explain all of these things.

2862
03:45:17,907 --> 03:45:20,448
[SPEAKER_31]: like one-on-one and let you ask all the questions you want.

2863
03:45:21,049 --> 03:45:24,711
[SPEAKER_31]: I have drawings of the building, everything.

2864
03:45:25,371 --> 03:45:28,993
[SPEAKER_31]: And anytime anybody's available, I would love to talk about it.

2865
03:45:29,133 --> 03:45:35,477
[SPEAKER_31]: But this has nothing to do with the fact that the city didn't ask us to have input.

2866
03:45:35,497 --> 03:45:37,078
[SPEAKER_31]: Like, it's not that we're mad about it.

2867
03:45:37,218 --> 03:45:42,581
[SPEAKER_31]: It's that this building, as it stands as it is right now, will not work for our department.

2868
03:45:43,361 --> 03:45:46,123
[SPEAKER_31]: Our trucks, we're not even sure if our trucks can pull in and out of the building.

2869
03:45:46,758 --> 03:45:51,280
[SPEAKER_31]: if they can make the turn, or if the one of the truck can even take the left down and miss a gap to respond.

2870
03:45:51,781 --> 03:45:55,242
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, there's a lot of things that need to be addressed here.

2871
03:45:55,803 --> 03:46:05,988
[SPEAKER_31]: And when you have people trying to put together a building who aren't the actual professionals that need to operate in that building, it's not going to work.

2872
03:46:06,468 --> 03:46:16,353
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, we go, we'll put out cones, we'll pull the truck around, we'll do all the things to try to make sure that that building can fit in that arrangement on that lot at that size.

2873
03:46:17,003 --> 03:46:27,671
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, we're not asking for luxury issues like items, we're actually asking for like, if the building will be functional, and if it will serve the city for 50 some odd years as this building has stood for this long.

2874
03:46:28,611 --> 03:46:30,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Danielle, I'm going to put on my two minutes here.

2875
03:46:32,294 --> 03:46:41,921
[SPEAKER_04]: And just say, a when we were discussing this, the reason that I support this is that I believe a debt exclusion is the best mechanism to fund the construction of a new fire headquarters in the

2876
03:46:42,978 --> 03:46:48,261
[SPEAKER_04]: When we're having the conversations, we have had some of the discussions that we've had over the last two months since the question came out.

2877
03:46:50,103 --> 03:46:53,204
[SPEAKER_04]: As you've noted, we weren't involved deeply in the planning process.

2878
03:46:53,325 --> 03:46:57,027
[SPEAKER_04]: There was an OPM that said, this is going to be the estimated cost of the building.

2879
03:46:58,268 --> 03:46:59,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's this number.

2880
03:46:59,809 --> 03:47:04,232
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we looked at the capital spending for the next five or 10 years, that's the biggest item.

2881
03:47:04,292 --> 03:47:05,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I have a cold.

2882
03:47:05,873 --> 03:47:07,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I have something in my mouth, so it sounded a little funky.

2883
03:47:11,052 --> 03:47:16,515
[SPEAKER_04]: That is my rationale here, that this is the best way to fund a new headquarters in a timely manner and get it built.

2884
03:47:17,455 --> 03:47:18,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I tend to agree.

2885
03:47:18,796 --> 03:47:26,680
[SPEAKER_04]: I've read some of the stuff that has been put online when we're talking about the phased red, yellow, green, getting people out of that red zone.

2886
03:47:27,487 --> 03:47:45,301
[SPEAKER_04]: when we're talking about the arrangement on that second floor of the rooms and the showers and not being enough showers and bathrooms, I do believe that both of those would fall under the DOR regulations around minor project changes because they would be, you know, changes on the, essentially on the floor plan where things are, how many versions of things are.

2887
03:47:46,722 --> 03:47:48,744
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's something bigger than that, if we're talking about

2888
03:47:50,423 --> 03:47:55,107
[SPEAKER_04]: that would be something that would have to go further.

2889
03:47:55,227 --> 03:47:56,909
[SPEAKER_04]: There are options on that front.

2890
03:47:58,110 --> 03:48:06,657
[SPEAKER_04]: If it is a little bit over the 30 million, if we are talking about 35 instead of 30, you could go out to the bond capacity to do that.

2891
03:48:07,077 --> 03:48:08,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I would certainly be open to those.

2892
03:48:08,559 --> 03:48:10,761
[SPEAKER_04]: I have appreciated some of the dialogue that has been out there.

2893
03:48:10,781 --> 03:48:11,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with councilmember

2894
03:48:16,055 --> 03:48:24,701
[SPEAKER_04]: the mayor and you, the fire union could get to a better place and be at a more collaborative place and that people would feel like their voices are being heard and included.

2895
03:48:25,802 --> 03:48:28,464
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe that the plan that's out there right now is the final plan.

2896
03:48:28,484 --> 03:48:30,005
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it will be the final plan.

2897
03:48:30,045 --> 03:48:31,767
[SPEAKER_04]: I expect that things will be addressed.

2898
03:48:32,207 --> 03:48:39,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I certainly expect that this council, if some of those changes are significant, would be supportive of providing additional funding for those changes.

2899
03:48:39,112 --> 03:48:40,173
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's my position on it.

2900
03:48:40,713 --> 03:48:43,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I tend to agree with some of my fellow Councilors around the timing.

2901
03:48:43,615 --> 03:48:43,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

2902
03:48:45,461 --> 03:48:45,761
[SPEAKER_04]: as well.

2903
03:48:45,902 --> 03:48:54,270
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we put it in this package because we believe this package is the one thing we're going to have to ask for other than a new high school until we start seeing that new growth be enough.

2904
03:48:54,610 --> 03:48:55,632
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where I'm at.

2905
03:48:56,232 --> 03:48:56,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2906
03:49:00,436 --> 03:49:00,717
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2907
03:49:01,458 --> 03:49:02,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Danielle.

2908
03:49:02,098 --> 03:49:02,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Next question.

2909
03:49:02,759 --> 03:49:04,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record.

2910
03:49:04,501 --> 03:49:06,603
[SPEAKER_04]: You have one minute to ask one question.

2911
03:49:07,162 --> 03:49:09,323
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, I'm Michael von Korff, 44 Pitcher Avenue.

2912
03:49:10,203 --> 03:49:17,526
[SPEAKER_18]: Tonight's question session is emblematic of a really painful division within the community over how to handle Medford's problems.

2913
03:49:17,606 --> 03:49:23,148
[SPEAKER_18]: And my question for the council is, what is it that we can do to help heal that division?

2914
03:49:23,768 --> 03:49:24,449
[SPEAKER_18]: Speaking for myself,

2915
03:49:25,629 --> 03:49:41,659
[SPEAKER_18]: Everyone I know personally all my friends and family are strong supporters of these overrides like we really believe like I really believe in, and this is an investment in Medford's future but I see a lot of folks in this room are really frustrated and angry and concerned about the overrides.

2916
03:49:42,319 --> 03:49:43,780
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's sort of two Medfords.

2917
03:49:44,901 --> 03:49:46,421
[SPEAKER_18]: kind of opposed to each other here.

2918
03:49:46,521 --> 03:49:52,843
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know we can't all get along all the time, but it feels like these two groups are so disconnected.

2919
03:49:53,303 --> 03:49:56,304
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there anything we can do to help bring these two groups closer together?

2920
03:49:56,324 --> 03:49:59,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go to Vice President Collins.

2921
03:50:00,605 --> 03:50:01,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Two minutes.

2922
03:50:01,986 --> 03:50:02,286
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2923
03:50:02,326 --> 03:50:03,106
[SPEAKER_24]: Appreciate the question.

2924
03:50:03,146 --> 03:50:06,607
[SPEAKER_24]: Obviously, I'm going to give a highly subjective answer because this isn't really a policy question.

2925
03:50:07,947 --> 03:50:10,888
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, obviously, I'm really saddened to see

2926
03:50:12,759 --> 03:50:13,679
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, let me start here.

2927
03:50:14,359 --> 03:50:20,381
[SPEAKER_24]: I really understand why people are so concerned about these questions from both sides.

2928
03:50:20,461 --> 03:50:22,681
[SPEAKER_24]: I see people saying, wow, my bills are going to go up.

2929
03:50:22,701 --> 03:50:23,521
[SPEAKER_24]: That's really serious.

2930
03:50:24,181 --> 03:50:26,082
[SPEAKER_24]: And I need to understand why that's being proposed.

2931
03:50:26,482 --> 03:50:32,063
[SPEAKER_24]: I can also see people saying, wow, these things that these questions would pay for are really dire.

2932
03:50:32,123 --> 03:50:33,763
[SPEAKER_24]: We really need to make sure that these pass.

2933
03:50:33,823 --> 03:50:36,684
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think people know which camp I'm firmly in.

2934
03:50:39,173 --> 03:50:46,075
[SPEAKER_24]: What does sadden me is seeing these two viewpoints, which I think are two positions that we can converse from.

2935
03:50:46,215 --> 03:50:54,317
[SPEAKER_24]: We can have discussions from those two poles and not experience division and not experience a crevasse in our community.

2936
03:50:54,977 --> 03:51:07,141
[SPEAKER_24]: To me, I think that we start seeing division in our community when certain people start saying, those people who disagree with you, they are against you, or they are against them, or this is pitting X against Y.

2937
03:51:08,886 --> 03:51:10,690
[SPEAKER_24]: and convince people of that.

2938
03:51:14,011 --> 03:51:15,132
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think that that's helpful.

2939
03:51:15,673 --> 03:51:18,275
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think that that is where we are to be totally honest with you.

2940
03:51:18,315 --> 03:51:30,506
[SPEAKER_24]: I know that there's a lot of people who are deeply concerned and have had conversations that haven't been productive or have been offensive, but I actually do not believe at all that this community is divided over these questions.

2941
03:51:30,927 --> 03:51:39,395
[SPEAKER_24]: And I also just think it's worth noting that at the end of the day, we can have conversations and sometimes those conversations are unpleasant and sometimes those conversations unfortunately are hostile.

2942
03:51:40,536 --> 03:51:55,046
[SPEAKER_24]: But I just fundamentally for ever since we put these on the ballot in June, I am really confused why we are fighting about this because at the end of the day, these questions will be decided in November when we count up the number of people that voted yes and the number of people that voted no.

2943
03:51:55,506 --> 03:52:00,490
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think the people that are saying this is dividing you, they want you to feel divided.

2944
03:52:00,670 --> 03:52:02,792
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'd say, look at the motivations there.

2945
03:52:03,172 --> 03:52:03,472
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2946
03:52:04,533 --> 03:52:05,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2947
03:52:05,814 --> 03:52:06,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan, two minutes.

2948
03:52:08,305 --> 03:52:08,946
[SPEAKER_26]: I love that question.

2949
03:52:08,966 --> 03:52:10,268
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you so much for bringing it up.

2950
03:52:11,529 --> 03:52:14,713
[SPEAKER_26]: I think there are a few basic.

2951
03:52:15,354 --> 03:52:26,368
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't want to say rules of engagement, but just pieces of advice that people hopefully understand as like good for group dynamics healthy for a community healthy for a group.

2952
03:52:27,177 --> 03:52:30,722
[SPEAKER_26]: I hope that people in their conversations with neighbors can think about these things.

2953
03:52:31,123 --> 03:52:34,227
[SPEAKER_26]: I hope that we on the council can also do these things as well.

2954
03:52:34,247 --> 03:52:39,333
[SPEAKER_26]: They are things like treat other people with respect and dignity.

2955
03:52:40,815 --> 03:52:42,177
[SPEAKER_26]: Assume good intent.

2956
03:52:43,431 --> 03:52:46,552
[SPEAKER_26]: Don't assume that the other person means you ill.

2957
03:52:47,312 --> 03:52:48,752
[SPEAKER_26]: Just assume that they have good intent.

2958
03:52:49,992 --> 03:52:53,533
[SPEAKER_26]: Listen to what folks are actually saying.

2959
03:52:54,953 --> 03:52:58,454
[SPEAKER_26]: Don't use accusational language.

2960
03:52:58,754 --> 03:53:10,876
[SPEAKER_26]: Basic decorum, basic showing respect for other people is what I encourage for everyone in all of their discussions with the friends, family, neighbors, city councilors, and all of those folks.

2961
03:53:11,801 --> 03:53:26,582
[SPEAKER_26]: And I hope that if I am not following that, people will call me out, because I do hope that I can always treat everyone, no matter what their political position on a topic is, with respect.

2962
03:53:27,644 --> 03:53:27,824
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2963
03:53:29,551 --> 03:53:30,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, anyone else?

2964
03:53:31,172 --> 03:53:32,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli, two minutes.

2965
03:53:32,632 --> 03:53:54,240
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you, and I appreciate the question because I too have a stance on this and it's difficult when your kids are reading posts and saying, hey dad, why are they using you for supporting constituents and residents that feel like they're being not listened to, to racist or a member of KKK?

2966
03:53:54,320 --> 03:53:56,121
[SPEAKER_40]: It's pretty sad, right?

2967
03:53:56,921 --> 03:53:58,622
[SPEAKER_40]: So when you see these situations of division,

2968
03:53:59,881 --> 03:54:01,542
[SPEAKER_40]: It's because people feel they haven't been heard.

2969
03:54:03,242 --> 03:54:05,703
[SPEAKER_40]: And I welcome you to look at the videos from our meetings.

2970
03:54:06,624 --> 03:54:09,585
[SPEAKER_40]: I had viable questions in our meetings, and this is where the division started.

2971
03:54:10,886 --> 03:54:26,252
[SPEAKER_40]: When you try to bring these questions forward and this council actively shut you down, as a member of this community and a city councilor, to be disrespected like that, opened up so many people's eyes to say, is this something that's been, is it needed?

2972
03:54:27,403 --> 03:54:30,466
[SPEAKER_40]: Because there's a group of people, my friend, that aren't being heard.

2973
03:54:31,286 --> 03:54:33,628
[SPEAKER_40]: They're afraid that no one's listening to them.

2974
03:54:35,150 --> 03:54:46,620
[SPEAKER_40]: Something that could be corrected, I've said this a thousand times, I never said I didn't want a debt exclusion, or the side, even the All-Method group saying that they didn't want a debt exclusion, all they're saying is, let's have a more open and transparent process.

2975
03:54:47,000 --> 03:54:53,025
[SPEAKER_40]: You've heard so many questionable issues tonight, from the firefighters' designs, to question seven and eight, there's so many.

2976
03:54:54,008 --> 03:55:01,896
[SPEAKER_40]: So I think the problem right now is you have six councils that really look at something and an issue and they band together, but they leave a whole demographic out.

2977
03:55:02,917 --> 03:55:06,100
[SPEAKER_40]: They can say the fluffy words to say that, well, it's divisive.

2978
03:55:06,140 --> 03:55:07,001
[SPEAKER_40]: They're saying it's divisive.

2979
03:55:07,021 --> 03:55:08,462
[SPEAKER_40]: Words that some people use is divisive.

2980
03:55:09,083 --> 03:55:13,907
[SPEAKER_40]: The bottom line is if it's smell, if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, it's a duck.

2981
03:55:14,864 --> 03:55:16,324
[SPEAKER_40]: and people just watch and see it.

2982
03:55:16,705 --> 03:55:17,705
[SPEAKER_40]: I don't want division either.

2983
03:55:18,545 --> 03:55:20,846
[SPEAKER_40]: There's too much division in this whole country, in this whole world.

2984
03:55:21,586 --> 03:55:36,951
[SPEAKER_40]: I would love for us to sit together, but as a councilor, when you're trying to share an opinion for a group of constituents that feel that they're not being listened to, that they feel like they're not being listened to, then you bring that forward, and then they actively shut you down.

2985
03:55:37,651 --> 03:55:39,452
[SPEAKER_40]: They use council rules against you.

2986
03:55:39,492 --> 03:55:42,032
[SPEAKER_40]: They suspend council rules so you can't speak.

2987
03:55:42,493 --> 03:55:43,313
[SPEAKER_40]: That's what happened.

2988
03:55:44,213 --> 03:55:45,854
[SPEAKER_40]: And this is why the division started.

2989
03:55:46,895 --> 03:55:49,037
[SPEAKER_40]: Because people didn't feel like they were properly listened to.

2990
03:55:49,317 --> 03:55:52,720
[SPEAKER_40]: They didn't feel like this financial task force was actually transparent and open.

2991
03:55:52,900 --> 03:55:59,565
[SPEAKER_40]: Because if they were, and the mayor presented all the facts, maybe we'd be in a different place right now, but we're not.

2992
03:56:00,726 --> 03:56:02,728
[SPEAKER_40]: So we made a lot of mistakes on many sides.

2993
03:56:03,088 --> 03:56:03,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor.

2994
03:56:03,969 --> 03:56:04,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2995
03:56:05,230 --> 03:56:05,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else here?

2996
03:56:05,830 --> 03:56:07,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Levee, two minutes.

2997
03:56:09,056 --> 03:56:14,901
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to try to give more of a personal perspective of that.

2998
03:56:15,081 --> 03:56:18,965
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a good question, one that hasn't been directly addressed in these chambers too much.

2999
03:56:19,085 --> 03:56:25,510
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, honestly, what we're seeing here is a bit of a generational divide.

3000
03:56:25,650 --> 03:56:34,298
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that previous generations of politicians quite literally came from a different part of town.

3001
03:56:36,069 --> 03:56:37,490
[SPEAKER_13]: I've literally analyzed this myself.

3002
03:56:37,530 --> 03:56:38,791
[SPEAKER_13]: I put up a blog post about it.

3003
03:56:38,831 --> 03:56:48,897
[SPEAKER_13]: And so there's a lot of people in the city who are used to having this personal relationship with their elected officials, because they're literally the people that they grew up with.

3004
03:56:49,037 --> 03:56:53,740
[SPEAKER_13]: But over time, the demographics of Medford have shifted.

3005
03:56:54,960 --> 03:56:59,863
[SPEAKER_13]: You have a much younger generation of voters, a lot more people moving in.

3006
03:57:00,324 --> 03:57:01,584
[SPEAKER_13]: And so there's a,

3007
03:57:03,260 --> 03:57:10,310
[SPEAKER_13]: And so most, I mean, most of the city Councilors these days live in just literally a completely different geographical part of Medford.

3008
03:57:11,411 --> 03:57:18,581
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I've spoken to, you know, there's been a lot of angry meetings and there is like some folks who've come up and said, you know, very

3009
03:57:19,918 --> 03:57:27,405
[SPEAKER_13]: unpleasant things to me, who I've later had very good one-on-one conversations with, and they've said, well, Matt, people are scared.

3010
03:57:28,006 --> 03:57:43,400
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do think that in some cases that is the case, because they feel like they don't really know, at a personal level, some of the folks here, just because we do come

3011
03:57:44,611 --> 03:57:47,332
[SPEAKER_13]: we are like literally living in a different part of town.

3012
03:57:47,852 --> 03:57:53,973
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so I think that, I think that these sorts of things will heal, um, will heal over time.

3013
03:57:54,693 --> 03:58:04,175
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I think it's a matter of, I'm trying to figure out like who, uh, that comes to these meetings is willing to have a nice one-on-one conversation, develop those relationships.

3014
03:58:04,515 --> 03:58:09,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Not everybody is, but some people are, so it will heal with time is my take on that.

3015
03:58:09,596 --> 03:58:11,797
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

3016
03:58:12,489 --> 03:58:14,089
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go really quickly here.

3017
03:58:14,109 --> 03:58:18,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's some questions around division.

3018
03:58:20,430 --> 03:58:22,351
[SPEAKER_04]: We are at an inflection point as a community.

3019
03:58:22,631 --> 03:58:23,811
[SPEAKER_04]: The community is changing.

3020
03:58:24,811 --> 03:58:28,272
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking at new growth and development for the first time really seriously.

3021
03:58:28,752 --> 03:58:34,033
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about decades of deferred maintenance and underinvestment that are coming up now that we need to address.

3022
03:58:34,933 --> 03:58:38,474
[SPEAKER_04]: And I understand that paying more is a hard choice.

3023
03:58:38,894 --> 03:58:40,014
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a hard choice for everyone.

3024
03:58:40,034 --> 03:58:41,014
[SPEAKER_04]: I think some people feel

3025
03:58:41,775 --> 03:58:43,595
[SPEAKER_04]: that it's a choice that they can make.

3026
03:58:43,655 --> 03:58:45,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people feel like it's a choice that they can't make.

3027
03:58:47,296 --> 03:58:49,317
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have difficult decisions.

3028
03:58:49,357 --> 03:58:55,718
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of those difficult decisions is to ask people to pay for the things that the city needs to do.

3029
03:58:57,258 --> 03:58:58,539
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very difficult decision frame.

3030
03:58:58,559 --> 03:59:01,619
[SPEAKER_04]: We've talked about all the different things that the city needs to pay for.

3031
03:59:02,759 --> 03:59:05,440
[SPEAKER_04]: I firmly believe, and my approach has been that the best thing we can do

3032
03:59:06,241 --> 03:59:22,528
[SPEAKER_04]: is ask the questions, present the information, get the budget out there, and then ask the voters to either elect people to make choices, which is most of the decisions, or even to make the choice themselves, which is what we're talking about with this proposition with questions six, seven, and eight.

3033
03:59:24,849 --> 03:59:27,870
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I'll say is I don't call opposition talking points for your tactics.

3034
03:59:28,710 --> 03:59:29,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't do that.

3035
03:59:30,231 --> 03:59:33,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't say the opposition is dividing the city.

3036
03:59:33,232 --> 03:59:35,053
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just something I don't do.

3037
03:59:36,138 --> 03:59:41,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli talks about the meetings that we should all look at to see what's happened.

3038
03:59:41,839 --> 03:59:50,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pointing to people to those exact same meetings to watch those exact same meetings, because I think if they watch them, they'll see things from the perspective that I experienced those meetings from, right?

3039
03:59:51,262 --> 03:59:53,182
[SPEAKER_04]: At the end of the day, we're not perfect.

3040
03:59:54,563 --> 03:59:56,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes things get divisive.

3041
03:59:56,143 --> 04:00:04,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes certainly I react here or when I sat down there in a way that I'm not happy about, that's a little more divisive or a little more pointed than I wanted it to be.

3042
04:00:05,314 --> 04:00:06,995
[SPEAKER_04]: And I try to do better every time.

3043
04:00:07,275 --> 04:00:08,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to learn from those issues.

3044
04:00:09,795 --> 04:00:13,117
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think at the end of the day, there will always be outstanding questions.

3045
04:00:13,737 --> 04:00:22,119
[SPEAKER_04]: There will always be a process that could have been longer, that could have been better, that the rules could have been looked at differently, that people could have had more time.

3046
04:00:22,860 --> 04:00:28,121
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think you have to balance that against the priorities and the time that we need to make a choice, right?

3047
04:00:28,341 --> 04:00:29,562
[SPEAKER_04]: We could have a process for 10 years.

3048
04:00:31,458 --> 04:00:35,081
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's still be people with outstanding questions who aren't happy with the end of the process.

3049
04:00:35,601 --> 04:00:37,783
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the end of the day, I think that's what democracy is about.

3050
04:00:37,863 --> 04:00:46,169
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a four-hour discussion of major tensions that people have, answering questions, trying to get to a point of agreement and stay in respectful dialogue.

3051
04:00:46,630 --> 04:00:48,271
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's the best that we can do.

3052
04:00:49,592 --> 04:00:51,293
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the end of the day, the voters will decide.

3053
04:00:51,313 --> 04:00:54,735
[SPEAKER_04]: The voters will decide on November 5th if these questions are approved or denied.

3054
04:00:55,236 --> 04:00:56,697
[SPEAKER_04]: The voters will decide next November.

3055
04:00:57,489 --> 04:01:00,151
[SPEAKER_04]: serves on this council, who serves as the mayor, who serves as the school committee.

3056
04:01:01,191 --> 04:01:02,632
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's democracy.

3057
04:01:02,852 --> 04:01:04,013
[SPEAKER_04]: We aren't all going to agree with it.

3058
04:01:04,573 --> 04:01:07,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been on the losing end of quite a few votes in this room myself.

3059
04:01:08,115 --> 04:01:08,955
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

3060
04:01:15,059 --> 04:01:17,900
[SPEAKER_36]: Marian Tomaszczuk, 29 Garfield Avenue.

3061
04:01:18,581 --> 04:01:24,104
[SPEAKER_36]: I was trying to get your attention when the assessor was here because I'm not sure if you can answer me.

3062
04:01:25,603 --> 04:01:35,547
[SPEAKER_36]: I had gone to him before because he was saying that the average house taxes go up $195 a year, I believe.

3063
04:01:36,527 --> 04:01:43,509
[SPEAKER_36]: And I had gone to him because my house bill, my tax bill has been going up $850 a year.

3064
04:01:44,770 --> 04:01:52,512
[SPEAKER_36]: When I went to him about that, he told me he didn't know why I was complaining because it wasn't the first year that my house had gone up $850.

3065
04:01:55,292 --> 04:01:56,914
[SPEAKER_36]: So what was the problem?

3066
04:01:57,715 --> 04:02:05,782
[SPEAKER_36]: And I told him, well, I guess because it's been more than one year in a row that my house has been going up $850 a year.

3067
04:02:06,923 --> 04:02:10,026
[SPEAKER_36]: My home insurance went from 2000 to 4000.

3068
04:02:12,248 --> 04:02:21,336
[SPEAKER_36]: And the only he told me the only thing that I would qualify for, for an exemption as a senior is the CPA, except

3069
04:02:21,707 --> 04:02:34,937
[SPEAKER_36]: myself and many other seniors can't qualify for the CPA because we've been advised that at our age that we should put our homes in a trust so that our children won't have to pay inheritance tax when we die.

3070
04:02:34,957 --> 04:02:42,583
[SPEAKER_36]: And in the CPA, it says, if your home is in a trust, you're not qualified for the exemption for the CPA.

3071
04:02:43,364 --> 04:02:49,829
[SPEAKER_36]: So Medford is the only surrounding city that does not have a residential exemption.

3072
04:02:50,342 --> 04:02:51,642
[SPEAKER_36]: So we don't have that.

3073
04:02:52,503 --> 04:02:54,804
[SPEAKER_36]: And there are no exemptions.

3074
04:02:55,204 --> 04:02:58,105
[SPEAKER_36]: Unlike another senior that spoke, I do not have a pension.

3075
04:02:58,165 --> 04:03:00,926
[SPEAKER_36]: My husband passed and I just get Social Security.

3076
04:03:01,686 --> 04:03:11,509
[SPEAKER_36]: So I was wondering how we come up with this statement of getting only 40 when the average homeowners is supposed to be 195 when mine is 850.

3077
04:03:11,930 --> 04:03:14,310
[SPEAKER_36]: We've gone over a little bit on the question.

3078
04:03:19,435 --> 04:03:26,997
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the question is about why the property value is going up faster than the median or the average that the assessor presented.

3079
04:03:27,017 --> 04:03:33,940
[SPEAKER_04]: The assessor presented that just for this year, the estimated median single family tax bill would increase 195 year on year.

3080
04:03:34,000 --> 04:03:37,361
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, I'm just looking at the slide he presented.

3081
04:03:37,441 --> 04:03:39,741
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just for this change from fiscal 24 to fiscal 25.

3082
04:03:42,230 --> 04:03:45,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, quite frankly, a lot of those questions we'd have to talk to the assessor.

3083
04:03:45,413 --> 04:03:49,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be happy to try to set up a meeting with the three of us or the two of us if you don't want me involved.

3084
04:03:49,397 --> 04:03:50,077
[SPEAKER_36]: No, that's fine.

3085
04:03:50,878 --> 04:03:56,924
[SPEAKER_36]: That would make it clearer to me because he told me that he really didn't want to talk to me because he's tired of talking to seniors.

3086
04:03:57,985 --> 04:04:03,790
[SPEAKER_36]: Oh, that would surprise me, but... Well, he was... Yeah, he said he was just tired of talking to seniors.

3087
04:04:03,810 --> 04:04:04,691
[SPEAKER_04]: That surprises me.

3088
04:04:04,751 --> 04:04:05,732
[SPEAKER_36]: Because he said that you don't...

3089
04:04:08,427 --> 04:04:10,528
[SPEAKER_36]: Two and a half does not mean you pay two and a half.

3090
04:04:10,608 --> 04:04:12,148
[SPEAKER_36]: Somebody else might pay two and a half.

3091
04:04:12,568 --> 04:04:16,949
[SPEAKER_36]: You apparently pay a lot more, because houses in your neighborhood go for a lot.

3092
04:04:17,789 --> 04:04:20,230
[SPEAKER_36]: I questioned the items on my house.

3093
04:04:20,670 --> 04:04:22,110
[SPEAKER_36]: It said I had a modern kitchen.

3094
04:04:22,891 --> 04:04:26,391
[SPEAKER_36]: And I said, well, my house is in disrepair.

3095
04:04:26,952 --> 04:04:29,572
[SPEAKER_36]: And my kitchen has not been updated since the 60s.

3096
04:04:30,192 --> 04:04:33,613
[SPEAKER_36]: And he said, do you have electricity in your kitchen?

3097
04:04:34,633 --> 04:04:35,874
[SPEAKER_36]: And I said, well, yes.

3098
04:04:36,254 --> 04:04:36,754
[SPEAKER_36]: And he said,

3099
04:04:37,446 --> 04:04:42,911
[SPEAKER_36]: Anything past 1920, which means you have electricity, is a modern kitchen.

3100
04:04:43,371 --> 04:04:45,894
[SPEAKER_36]: That's why you're being taxed on a modern kitchen.

3101
04:04:46,314 --> 04:04:53,280
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't speak to what the state laws are around assessment and how they come up with their formulas, but I'd be happy to try to set up a meeting.

3102
04:04:53,300 --> 04:04:54,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love that.

3103
04:04:54,181 --> 04:04:55,943
[SPEAKER_04]: We've gone extensively over on the question.

3104
04:04:56,003 --> 04:04:59,186
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to give other Councilors a chance if any other Councilors want two minutes.

3105
04:04:59,306 --> 04:04:59,566
[SPEAKER_36]: Great.

3106
04:05:01,808 --> 04:05:02,468
[SPEAKER_36]: Anyone have any interest?

3107
04:05:04,184 --> 04:05:07,046
[SPEAKER_36]: Council Vice President Collins.

3108
04:05:07,066 --> 04:05:08,607
[SPEAKER_24]: I just echo what President Bears said.

3109
04:05:08,647 --> 04:05:14,650
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that these are questions that, you know, and we'd be happy to liaise as council leadership to set this up with the chief assessor.

3110
04:05:14,690 --> 04:05:17,752
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that he'd be able to give you much better information than we can on the council.

3111
04:05:17,772 --> 04:05:24,076
[SPEAKER_36]: Yeah, that's why I'm afraid of voting for this because they say, oh, these expenses are going so high.

3112
04:05:24,136 --> 04:05:26,678
[SPEAKER_36]: I can't fix the repairs in my house.

3113
04:05:27,978 --> 04:05:30,440
[SPEAKER_36]: So I'm afraid I can't pay this.

3114
04:05:30,831 --> 04:05:31,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

3115
04:05:31,372 --> 04:05:33,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I will coordinate, get the contact information.

3116
04:05:33,734 --> 04:05:35,696
[SPEAKER_04]: We can try to set up a meeting around the specific questions.

3117
04:05:35,716 --> 04:05:36,397
[SPEAKER_36]: I appreciate that.

3118
04:05:36,557 --> 04:05:36,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

3119
04:05:36,998 --> 04:05:37,418
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

3120
04:05:39,480 --> 04:05:41,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Just realizing I would have asked Larry to do it.

3121
04:05:41,583 --> 04:05:44,526
[SPEAKER_04]: So another sad thought.

3122
04:05:45,567 --> 04:05:46,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else on this question?

3123
04:05:47,729 --> 04:05:49,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, we'll go to the podium to our former chief.

3124
04:05:50,693 --> 04:05:51,754
[SPEAKER_04]: One minute for one question, chief.

3125
04:05:52,418 --> 04:05:52,838
[SPEAKER_43]: How you doing?

3126
04:05:53,318 --> 04:05:54,079
[SPEAKER_43]: John Friedman.

3127
04:05:54,999 --> 04:06:10,846
[SPEAKER_43]: My question to the council is how do you hand, how do you ask the voters to vote for $30 million and give that to the architect that hasn't demonstrated that he has the ability to solve some of these difficult problems?

3128
04:06:12,031 --> 04:06:13,573
[SPEAKER_43]: So, and I'll list them.

3129
04:06:14,374 --> 04:06:17,958
[SPEAKER_43]: The first one is, and it has to do with the design.

3130
04:06:17,998 --> 04:06:25,426
[SPEAKER_43]: I know you're not responsible for design, but the number one killer of firefighters in the United States today is cancer.

3131
04:06:26,126 --> 04:06:31,712
[SPEAKER_43]: That means that the design has to be centered around a thing called clean zone design.

3132
04:06:32,333 --> 04:06:42,471
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay, so they've had multiple, I've seen when I was chief, multiple different renditions of the design as it progressed when I was working on it with the architect.

3133
04:06:43,203 --> 04:06:51,226
[SPEAKER_43]: When I left, it's like that got thrown in the trash and now there's completely new, three or four different new designs, okay?

3134
04:06:51,766 --> 04:06:58,249
[SPEAKER_43]: And the last one that I see, it definitely does not address the cancer issue.

3135
04:06:58,569 --> 04:07:01,490
[SPEAKER_43]: They created what I call a decon closet, okay?

3136
04:07:02,010 --> 04:07:07,212
[SPEAKER_43]: No way to get in there and out of there without going through the hot zone, okay?

3137
04:07:07,853 --> 04:07:08,553
[SPEAKER_43]: So there's about,

3138
04:07:09,845 --> 04:07:13,086
[SPEAKER_43]: 10 other problems that I see with the design, I'm not going to list them all here.

3139
04:07:13,747 --> 04:07:21,190
[SPEAKER_43]: But how do you hand them $30 million and say, okay, you've had all this time to fix the design to make it correct.

3140
04:07:21,890 --> 04:07:22,250
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay.

3141
04:07:22,930 --> 04:07:25,671
[SPEAKER_43]: And it's still isn't there.

3142
04:07:25,691 --> 04:07:25,731
[SPEAKER_43]: So

3143
04:07:27,912 --> 04:07:37,680
[SPEAKER_43]: The union is simply asking to be involved, to have the ability to meet with the architect and help solve some of these issues.

3144
04:07:38,861 --> 04:07:40,423
[SPEAKER_43]: Everybody wants a new headquarters.

3145
04:07:40,483 --> 04:07:41,664
[SPEAKER_43]: They want a new headquarters.

3146
04:07:42,024 --> 04:07:42,985
[SPEAKER_43]: The city wants a new headquarters.

3147
04:07:43,225 --> 04:07:44,906
[SPEAKER_43]: The taxpayers want a new headquarters.

3148
04:07:45,467 --> 04:07:48,950
[SPEAKER_43]: So why would the firefighters not want it?

3149
04:07:49,110 --> 04:07:53,533
[SPEAKER_43]: And it's because we're looking at all these problems and we're not seeing a solution.

3150
04:07:53,974 --> 04:07:56,056
[SPEAKER_43]: And then when we ask them to have a seat at the table,

3151
04:07:57,116 --> 04:08:02,140
[SPEAKER_43]: It's not being given to them in a meaningful way that they can invoke change.

3152
04:08:02,640 --> 04:08:09,025
[SPEAKER_43]: The other last thing I'll leave you with, the design is so important because the square footage relates to the price.

3153
04:08:09,486 --> 04:08:13,349
[SPEAKER_43]: So they put a price on it in the beginning based on the square footage.

3154
04:08:13,809 --> 04:08:19,193
[SPEAKER_43]: That's where the 30,000 square foot facility related to 30 million.

3155
04:08:19,894 --> 04:08:22,095
[SPEAKER_43]: But there's other hidden costs, there's costs

3156
04:08:22,856 --> 04:08:26,259
[SPEAKER_43]: for when we tear down headquarters, we have to go somewhere.

3157
04:08:26,679 --> 04:08:27,680
[SPEAKER_43]: That's a huge cost.

3158
04:08:27,940 --> 04:08:29,441
[SPEAKER_43]: All the equipment has to be moved.

3159
04:08:29,701 --> 04:08:37,286
[SPEAKER_43]: The extractors, the, um, the SCBA filling station, all that stuff has to be recreated for us to run out of somewhere else.

3160
04:08:37,707 --> 04:08:38,027
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay.

3161
04:08:38,407 --> 04:08:39,348
[SPEAKER_43]: That's a huge cost.

3162
04:08:40,129 --> 04:08:42,770
[SPEAKER_43]: And then obviously there's other costs.

3163
04:08:42,790 --> 04:08:48,294
[SPEAKER_43]: When you go to move back into the new station, you've got to buy furniture, get it by equipment, all those things I was just talking.

3164
04:08:48,314 --> 04:08:49,856
[SPEAKER_43]: They don't take the old stuff and move it.

3165
04:08:49,876 --> 04:08:50,556
[SPEAKER_43]: They buy new.

3166
04:08:51,457 --> 04:08:51,637
[SPEAKER_43]: So,

3167
04:08:53,226 --> 04:08:58,691
[SPEAKER_43]: The 30 million could balloon up to 45 if it's done the way it's supposed to be.

3168
04:08:58,711 --> 04:09:12,542
[SPEAKER_43]: If the square footage is made so that you can have room for expansion, so that as the department grows, because the building's supposed to last 50 years, right now it's like everything is jammed into a little small area on the apparatus bay.

3169
04:09:12,942 --> 04:09:14,963
[SPEAKER_43]: And I don't see clean zone design in there.

3170
04:09:15,724 --> 04:09:21,449
[SPEAKER_43]: So my question to the council and to the taxpayers is how do you vote for something that

3171
04:09:22,682 --> 04:09:27,143
[SPEAKER_43]: ahead of time beforehand when you don't even know what the actual cost is going to be.

3172
04:09:27,243 --> 04:09:35,465
[SPEAKER_43]: I've seen no itemized budget that says, okay, we're going to spend this much on the building, this much on people.

3173
04:09:35,846 --> 04:09:36,066
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay.

3174
04:09:36,126 --> 04:09:36,906
[SPEAKER_43]: I'll stop right there.

3175
04:09:36,926 --> 04:09:42,267
[SPEAKER_43]: I just, I could not in good conscience leave here tonight without putting out some facts.

3176
04:09:42,807 --> 04:09:43,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

3177
04:09:43,608 --> 04:09:44,248
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.

3178
04:09:44,268 --> 04:09:48,569
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to go if I can first chief, we didn't have an opportunity.

3179
04:09:49,994 --> 04:09:55,399
[SPEAKER_40]: that when you left, no one could say this publicly, but we wanna thank you because we know how difficult your job is anyway.

3180
04:09:55,479 --> 04:10:00,824
[SPEAKER_40]: We understand becoming a chief is very difficult because you have been thrown into the realm of politics.

3181
04:10:01,204 --> 04:10:06,489
[SPEAKER_40]: And that's sad because I know who you are as a man and I know how much you love being a firefighter.

3182
04:10:06,869 --> 04:10:13,996
[SPEAKER_40]: So I'll be honest with you, I was sad to hear that you did step away because Medford is worse as a fire department because you're gone.

3183
04:10:14,036 --> 04:10:16,158
[SPEAKER_40]: So I wanna make sure publicly somebody said that to you.

3184
04:10:16,858 --> 04:10:32,402
[SPEAKER_40]: And I know Danielle doesn't want to say it, but I've heard it over and over again through public, through social media, our leader of the community, through social media, bashing on you, bashing on other fire chiefs, saying it's all them, that they've been part of the design.

3185
04:10:32,462 --> 04:10:41,005
[SPEAKER_40]: So I need to know, when you left, were our firefighters involved in that design that we have today?

3186
04:10:42,253 --> 04:10:55,302
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay, I'm gonna need a little time to answer that, please, because it's a complicated question, because when I took over and we started working on headquarters design, the architect asked for our help, for the firefighters' help and myself.

3187
04:10:55,522 --> 04:11:08,832
[SPEAKER_43]: We created program books, and I created a headquarters, I won't call it a tax force, it was a committee where I gave out the program books to my team, because you're always smarter and stronger as a team.

3188
04:11:09,052 --> 04:11:11,254
[SPEAKER_43]: I've learned that in the fire service in 30 years, right?

3189
04:11:12,054 --> 04:11:20,205
[SPEAKER_43]: even though I'm a pretty smart guy, I they're the ones that are going to basically, you know, work there for the next 30 years and live there.

3190
04:11:20,645 --> 04:11:22,628
[SPEAKER_43]: So their input is very valuable.

3191
04:11:23,369 --> 04:11:24,971
[SPEAKER_43]: And I put a huge amount of

3192
04:11:26,121 --> 04:11:27,423
[SPEAKER_43]: stalking that, okay?

3193
04:11:28,084 --> 04:11:41,961
[SPEAKER_43]: So once we got the, we had one meeting, we filled out the program books, gave it to the architect, and then what happened after that, and I'm not sure, because I've only been involved in one headquarters, the process, but at a certain point,

3194
04:11:43,243 --> 04:11:48,248
[SPEAKER_43]: It was taken up above my team, and then the architects and myself tweaked it.

3195
04:11:48,869 --> 04:11:52,613
[SPEAKER_43]: Now, this is going back to my design, which I don't see in those designs.

3196
04:11:52,693 --> 04:11:53,494
[SPEAKER_43]: My design's gone.

3197
04:11:53,954 --> 04:12:00,842
[SPEAKER_43]: So when I look at the new designs, it doesn't even come close to what I had on paper, okay, with the architect.

3198
04:12:01,502 --> 04:12:04,505
[SPEAKER_43]: Then at a certain point, it got taken up above myself.

3199
04:12:05,458 --> 04:12:06,738
[SPEAKER_43]: and it was gone for a little while.

3200
04:12:07,639 --> 04:12:10,359
[SPEAKER_43]: And that may be normal in the process, I don't know.

3201
04:12:11,460 --> 04:12:17,642
[SPEAKER_43]: But I kept asking, hey, when sometimes they would have a meeting and they'd show me something and I'd say, hey, can I share this with my team?

3202
04:12:18,962 --> 04:12:21,103
[SPEAKER_43]: Hold off on that, don't share it, okay?

3203
04:12:21,603 --> 04:12:24,784
[SPEAKER_43]: So they weren't involved as it went through the different phases.

3204
04:12:25,700 --> 04:12:36,687
[SPEAKER_43]: Then it got to the point where, okay, we had to make some really hard choices because they were setting limits on the amount of square footage, which relates to money.

3205
04:12:36,747 --> 04:12:37,567
[SPEAKER_43]: I understand that.

3206
04:12:37,607 --> 04:12:43,511
[SPEAKER_43]: So we tried using efficiency to try and make the design more efficient, which is healthy when you design.

3207
04:12:43,631 --> 04:12:48,054
[SPEAKER_43]: You're supposed to try and, you know, think outside the box, make things more efficient.

3208
04:12:49,326 --> 04:12:52,747
[SPEAKER_43]: But it got to a point where it's like, okay, it can't be any bigger than this.

3209
04:12:52,827 --> 04:12:57,368
[SPEAKER_43]: And we could not, even with the efficiency, get everything in there.

3210
04:12:58,149 --> 04:13:00,349
[SPEAKER_43]: And I was unable to share that with my team.

3211
04:13:00,990 --> 04:13:03,110
[SPEAKER_43]: I was told not to.

3212
04:13:03,770 --> 04:13:07,652
[SPEAKER_43]: So justifiably so, they're questioning me all the time.

3213
04:13:07,692 --> 04:13:09,032
[SPEAKER_43]: Hey, chief, what's going on, what's going on?

3214
04:13:09,622 --> 04:13:22,489
[SPEAKER_43]: Then at some point in the process, they were pulled into a meeting with the chief of staff, shown the design, and they came to my office very angry because it's the first time they saw it, and it didn't meet their needs.

3215
04:13:23,309 --> 04:13:24,970
[SPEAKER_43]: And I was like, where did you see that?

3216
04:13:25,330 --> 04:13:26,391
[SPEAKER_43]: They told me.

3217
04:13:27,131 --> 04:13:34,255
[SPEAKER_43]: So they felt, and I agree with them, that they weren't involved in the changes that were made.

3218
04:13:34,955 --> 04:13:54,000
[SPEAKER_43]: So, and then there was things that they noticed, again, as a team you're stronger, that I didn't notice, privacy issues, the size of the bedrooms, all sorts of issues that quite frankly, would have been healthy if they were involved in the process, they would have got sort of ironed out at that time.

3219
04:13:54,940 --> 04:13:59,381
[SPEAKER_43]: So they are correct and they feel jaded that they weren't involved in that process.

3220
04:14:00,438 --> 04:14:03,220
[SPEAKER_43]: All right, so I'm setting the record straight there.

3221
04:14:03,860 --> 04:14:07,243
[SPEAKER_43]: After I left, I can't tell you what happened after that.

3222
04:14:07,283 --> 04:14:14,387
[SPEAKER_43]: But at that point, headquarters was at a certain point, and we were sort of at a crossroads.

3223
04:14:14,428 --> 04:14:19,811
[SPEAKER_43]: It's like, OK, we need to make, the reason I'm saying the design, because it changes the square footage, which changes the amount of money.

3224
04:14:20,231 --> 04:14:22,993
[SPEAKER_43]: So how do you, the design's not finalized yet.

3225
04:14:23,033 --> 04:14:24,755
[SPEAKER_43]: They're asking for a fixed amount of money.

3226
04:14:25,875 --> 04:14:33,525
[SPEAKER_43]: And what happens if we do fix it and it ends up being bigger, which means could be another 15 million, I don't know.

3227
04:14:34,126 --> 04:14:37,670
[SPEAKER_43]: And for example, the apparatus base.

3228
04:14:38,516 --> 04:14:41,057
[SPEAKER_43]: The original design had five bays, right?

3229
04:14:41,717 --> 04:14:43,077
[SPEAKER_43]: Other cities and towns have six.

3230
04:14:43,137 --> 04:14:50,220
[SPEAKER_43]: Now headquarters is the, you know, it's where everybody comes to do, all the outside stations come there.

3231
04:14:50,300 --> 04:14:53,821
[SPEAKER_43]: After every fire, you have all your apparatus that respond there.

3232
04:14:54,321 --> 04:14:56,282
[SPEAKER_43]: This design is nowhere for them to park.

3233
04:14:56,402 --> 04:14:58,082
[SPEAKER_43]: Where do they park when they come to headquarters?

3234
04:14:58,122 --> 04:14:59,843
[SPEAKER_43]: Where do they park when they come to train?

3235
04:14:59,863 --> 04:15:00,923
[SPEAKER_43]: There's a classroom in there.

3236
04:15:01,703 --> 04:15:05,784
[SPEAKER_43]: All the trucks have to come down because you have to respond from headquarters if there's a fire.

3237
04:15:06,705 --> 04:15:06,865
[SPEAKER_43]: So,

3238
04:15:07,813 --> 04:15:10,454
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm looking at the design, I'm saying, okay, where does everybody park?

3239
04:15:11,194 --> 04:15:14,695
[SPEAKER_43]: Then I look at the ramp and I'm saying, I don't see the turn radius is on there.

3240
04:15:14,735 --> 04:15:15,595
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm looking at that ramp.

3241
04:15:15,715 --> 04:15:19,116
[SPEAKER_43]: I don't think a lot of one can get out of there the way that design is right now.

3242
04:15:19,756 --> 04:15:26,157
[SPEAKER_43]: If you put the turn radius is on there, how do they take a left and go up Mystic Ave with that current ramp?

3243
04:15:27,058 --> 04:15:30,418
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay, so those are all things that can be fixed.

3244
04:15:30,638 --> 04:15:33,299
[SPEAKER_43]: They can be fixed, but they relate to more money.

3245
04:15:34,079 --> 04:15:36,860
[SPEAKER_43]: So how do you vote for this?

3246
04:15:37,947 --> 04:15:39,429
[SPEAKER_43]: with a fixed dollar amount.

3247
04:15:39,609 --> 04:15:40,290
[SPEAKER_43]: That's all I'm saying.

3248
04:15:40,931 --> 04:15:41,432
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you, Chief.

3249
04:15:41,632 --> 04:15:43,435
[SPEAKER_40]: Again, if I can, Council President.

3250
04:15:44,016 --> 04:15:44,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

3251
04:15:46,058 --> 04:15:47,359
[SPEAKER_40]: Clarification, thank you with that.

3252
04:15:47,659 --> 04:15:51,282
[SPEAKER_40]: I also know that from what I've heard, it's 1,000 square feet smaller.

3253
04:15:52,022 --> 04:15:53,543
[SPEAKER_40]: I think you want to talk about unity.

3254
04:15:54,044 --> 04:15:56,346
[SPEAKER_40]: You want to talk about doing something correct as a team.

3255
04:15:56,786 --> 04:16:07,714
[SPEAKER_40]: When you're talking about firefighters, that their safety with carcinogens aren't being met, I think in unity, we should all say that we do not support this debt exclusion for a fire station.

3256
04:16:07,974 --> 04:16:10,276
[SPEAKER_40]: That's inadequate for our men and women in the fire station.

3257
04:16:10,936 --> 04:16:12,177
[SPEAKER_40]: That's what I think we should say.

3258
04:16:12,237 --> 04:16:13,778
[SPEAKER_40]: You want to start in that process?

3259
04:16:14,399 --> 04:16:15,119
[SPEAKER_40]: That would be great.

3260
04:16:15,499 --> 04:16:17,220
[SPEAKER_40]: But Chief, thank you so much for the clarity.

3261
04:16:17,861 --> 04:16:20,903
[SPEAKER_40]: And I apologize that our firefighters aren't being heard.

3262
04:16:20,943 --> 04:16:33,592
[SPEAKER_43]: And again, this is the issue when the mayor does things in bubbles and she tries to make things without... My hope coming here tonight and speaking tonight that it'll force them to the table and allow us to help them fix it.

3263
04:16:36,954 --> 04:16:43,659
[SPEAKER_43]: and then have an accurate number that they could go back before November, so that the people can actually see that it was solved.

3264
04:16:44,140 --> 04:16:45,761
[SPEAKER_43]: Then they can, we can all get behind it.

3265
04:16:45,801 --> 04:16:46,802
[SPEAKER_43]: The union will get behind it.

3266
04:16:47,542 --> 04:16:48,203
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm not dead.

3267
04:16:48,243 --> 04:16:48,904
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm still here.

3268
04:16:49,544 --> 04:16:50,725
[SPEAKER_43]: Anytime they want my help.

3269
04:16:51,546 --> 04:16:51,826
[SPEAKER_43]: All right.

3270
04:16:51,926 --> 04:16:52,727
[SPEAKER_43]: I live in the city.

3271
04:16:52,907 --> 04:16:54,568
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm very passionate about headquarters.

3272
04:16:54,608 --> 04:16:57,410
[SPEAKER_43]: I'd love to see it built, but I want it built right.

3273
04:16:57,751 --> 04:16:58,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

3274
04:16:58,331 --> 04:16:58,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Chief.

3275
04:16:59,451 --> 04:17:06,453
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just speak for myself to say I appreciate your service to the city, coming down here tonight, laying out this case.

3276
04:17:06,493 --> 04:17:12,475
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of what you've talked about has been coming out drips and drabs over the past couple of months.

3277
04:17:13,515 --> 04:17:21,357
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, to an extent, as best as I can say it, I think we are conflating two pieces of a question.

3278
04:17:22,079 --> 04:17:24,340
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the question of the design and the design process.

3279
04:17:24,720 --> 04:17:27,241
[SPEAKER_04]: From everything I've heard, it's not adequate.

3280
04:17:27,281 --> 04:17:28,281
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not at a final design.

3281
04:17:28,301 --> 04:17:30,562
[SPEAKER_04]: The final design needs to be improved, 100%.

3282
04:17:31,582 --> 04:17:50,949
[SPEAKER_04]: As I've read through letter from Danielle, things online, things like the clean zones and the space, and especially I know I've had some conversations with Todd Blake and the interim chief around how the design was changed relative to the MassDOT Mystic Ave Main Street project and how that's impacted things like turn radius and the apparatus bays.

3283
04:17:52,048 --> 04:17:53,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a lot of significant concerns about that.

3284
04:17:54,509 --> 04:17:58,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I still believe a debt exclusion is the best way to fund the fire station headquarters.

3285
04:17:58,930 --> 04:18:11,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if 30 million is only funding 75, 85, 95% of that, A, it's not just 30 million, it's 30 million plus inflationary adjustments and minor project changes.

3286
04:18:11,053 --> 04:18:13,173
[SPEAKER_04]: So that 30 million bond could really be 32 to 35.

3287
04:18:13,293 --> 04:18:15,874
[SPEAKER_04]: If the changes can be made within that,

3288
04:18:16,454 --> 04:18:19,636
[SPEAKER_04]: then this debt exclusion continues to pay for the fire station headquarters.

3289
04:18:19,936 --> 04:18:29,501
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's more than that, you've said a number 40, 45 million, you think, potentially, I'm 100% in to say we need to look at the bond capacity or we need to ask again.

3290
04:18:30,393 --> 04:18:30,753
[SPEAKER_04]: for more.

3291
04:18:31,213 --> 04:18:36,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that voting no on this debt exclusion will get us to eventually a yes.

3292
04:18:36,515 --> 04:18:37,636
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my position on it.

3293
04:18:38,216 --> 04:18:40,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I think voting yes to the financing.

3294
04:18:40,737 --> 04:18:41,817
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm not asking to vote no.

3295
04:18:41,857 --> 04:18:47,760
[SPEAKER_43]: What I'm asking for is a seat at the table for them so that they can get what they need before November.

3296
04:18:47,860 --> 04:18:48,980
[SPEAKER_43]: It's not that difficult.

3297
04:18:49,300 --> 04:18:50,421
[SPEAKER_43]: Sit down with the architect.

3298
04:18:50,761 --> 04:18:51,661
[SPEAKER_43]: Give them access.

3299
04:18:52,542 --> 04:18:53,622
[SPEAKER_43]: Let the chief be involved.

3300
04:18:53,682 --> 04:18:54,622
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm not chief anymore.

3301
04:18:54,642 --> 04:18:55,883
[SPEAKER_43]: Let the chief be involved with them.

3302
04:18:56,563 --> 04:18:59,004
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't mean to put words in your mouth that you're advocating for that.

3303
04:18:59,484 --> 04:19:06,685
[SPEAKER_04]: My personal position is voting yes funds most of this project, the way that I think it can best be funded, the fastest way it can be funded.

3304
04:19:07,745 --> 04:19:10,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have all this information when we released the plan.

3305
04:19:11,026 --> 04:19:17,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I wish that people had acted differently so it would be easier to talk to the residents and get them to support things like this?

3306
04:19:17,087 --> 04:19:17,067
100%.

3307
04:19:20,748 --> 04:19:23,989
[SPEAKER_04]: As you're aware, as other folks here are aware, there are things that are not within

3308
04:19:24,827 --> 04:19:26,550
[SPEAKER_04]: this council's control within my control.

3309
04:19:26,570 --> 04:19:31,257
[SPEAKER_43]: On balance, the financing question... One other thing you mentioned was MassDOT.

3310
04:19:31,658 --> 04:19:31,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

3311
04:19:32,799 --> 04:19:37,927
[SPEAKER_43]: Shouldn't MassDOT, shouldn't the headquarters be granted an exception where

3312
04:19:39,175 --> 04:19:40,636
[SPEAKER_43]: they take precedent over that.

3313
04:19:40,876 --> 04:19:45,838
[SPEAKER_43]: Like MassDOT should be changing their design, not headquarters changing their design for MassDOT.

3314
04:19:45,858 --> 04:19:47,178
[SPEAKER_43]: It should go the other way around.

3315
04:19:47,478 --> 04:19:49,739
[SPEAKER_43]: Because we're on a very tight site.

3316
04:19:49,939 --> 04:19:52,100
[SPEAKER_43]: That site that we have, it's very tight.

3317
04:19:52,120 --> 04:19:53,201
[SPEAKER_43]: It's the only site we have.

3318
04:19:53,321 --> 04:19:54,801
[SPEAKER_43]: So we have nowhere else to go.

3319
04:19:55,322 --> 04:19:56,122
[SPEAKER_43]: It's very tight.

3320
04:19:56,642 --> 04:20:03,645
[SPEAKER_43]: And they're going to have to try and give them some, I don't know if they're called variances or what they are, to allow headquarters to function properly.

3321
04:20:03,765 --> 04:20:05,466
[SPEAKER_43]: That's what I'm seeing is not happening.

3322
04:20:05,486 --> 04:20:07,166
[SPEAKER_43]: It seems like no communication.

3323
04:20:09,125 --> 04:20:11,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally agree that the communication needs to be better.

3324
04:20:11,407 --> 04:20:12,808
[SPEAKER_04]: It needs to be more of a seat at the table.

3325
04:20:13,668 --> 04:20:22,214
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still going to vote the way I'm going to vote, because I think it gets us a lot of the way there on the financing question, even if I personally have a lot of problems and issues with the design and the design process as it stands.

3326
04:20:22,234 --> 04:20:23,175
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's just where I'm at.

3327
04:20:23,475 --> 04:20:24,376
[SPEAKER_43]: Understood.

3328
04:20:24,716 --> 04:20:26,037
[SPEAKER_04]: And I appreciate you coming down.

3329
04:20:26,637 --> 04:20:30,900
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I think the other thing we've talked about a lot tonight is that the state is not doing us right in a lot of ways.

3330
04:20:31,241 --> 04:20:34,263
[SPEAKER_04]: That includes MassDOT and DCR on our streets and roads in general.

3331
04:20:34,443 --> 04:20:35,984
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know,

3332
04:20:36,431 --> 04:20:40,693
[SPEAKER_04]: they get to say, well, we're not going to spend the 6 million to redesign your intersection if you don't do it our way.

3333
04:20:40,973 --> 04:20:43,355
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't really have a lot of recourse, even though I wish we did.

3334
04:20:44,695 --> 04:20:46,997
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a tough situation.

3335
04:20:47,937 --> 04:20:49,118
[SPEAKER_43]: Well, we can work with them.

3336
04:20:49,478 --> 04:20:50,498
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm sure there's a solution.

3337
04:20:51,099 --> 04:21:02,064
[SPEAKER_43]: If we've met with them and the architect, there's got to be some sort of happy medium where they get what they want and we get some means of getting, I use ladder one because ladder one's 58 feet long.

3338
04:21:02,685 --> 04:21:03,665
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you've got a ramp that's 60,

3339
04:21:06,044 --> 04:21:07,445
[SPEAKER_43]: you barely make it out of the building.

3340
04:21:07,785 --> 04:21:09,727
[SPEAKER_43]: You can't turn till you're completely out of the building.

3341
04:21:09,787 --> 04:21:11,929
[SPEAKER_43]: So what happens is you've got a tiny ramp there.

3342
04:21:11,949 --> 04:21:13,170
[SPEAKER_43]: They're going to have to stop turning.

3343
04:21:13,610 --> 04:21:14,391
[SPEAKER_43]: Then you hit the building.

3344
04:21:14,411 --> 04:21:15,492
[SPEAKER_43]: You're setting them up for failure.

3345
04:21:15,672 --> 04:21:15,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

3346
04:21:16,252 --> 04:21:18,014
[SPEAKER_43]: So there's ways of doing it.

3347
04:21:18,574 --> 04:21:20,976
[SPEAKER_43]: And I'm sure MassDOT would see that if we showed it to them.

3348
04:21:21,577 --> 04:21:24,619
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like a lot of heads need to get together before a final design happens.

3349
04:21:27,181 --> 04:21:28,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else on this question?

3350
04:21:28,662 --> 04:21:30,184
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

3351
04:21:30,304 --> 04:21:31,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we are.

3352
04:21:31,325 --> 04:21:31,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Chief.

3353
04:21:35,196 --> 04:21:38,857
[SPEAKER_04]: We have someone who hasn't asked a question yet, and then we have a hand that has and someone in line that has.

3354
04:21:39,477 --> 04:21:46,239
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll go to the floor, name and address for the record, one minute to answer one question or ask one question.

3355
04:21:48,300 --> 04:21:48,880
[SPEAKER_27]: Is this on?

3356
04:21:48,980 --> 04:21:49,801
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on, you're good.

3357
04:21:49,841 --> 04:21:50,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

3358
04:21:50,081 --> 04:21:51,061
[SPEAKER_04]: And you shouldn't need to touch it.

3359
04:21:51,261 --> 04:21:54,602
[SPEAKER_27]: My name is Jennifer Yankel and I live at 16 Monument Street.

3360
04:21:55,022 --> 04:22:03,565
[SPEAKER_27]: And I just wanted to thank all of you councillors for taking all this time and providing all this information to us because

3361
04:22:04,315 --> 04:22:05,776
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, these are big questions.

3362
04:22:06,216 --> 04:22:07,857
[SPEAKER_27]: I am very much in support of them.

3363
04:22:08,258 --> 04:22:11,159
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll reveal.

3364
04:22:12,861 --> 04:22:15,983
[SPEAKER_27]: But all this information has been really helpful as I think about it.

3365
04:22:16,103 --> 04:22:24,408
[SPEAKER_27]: I do have a question, and that has to do with the establishment eventually at some point of a residential exemption.

3366
04:22:24,468 --> 04:22:28,210
[SPEAKER_27]: Is that something that, I mean, I don't know how that would happen.

3367
04:22:28,931 --> 04:22:33,554
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, obviously it's probably not gonna happen before November 5th, but is that something that,

3368
04:22:34,861 --> 04:22:46,066
[SPEAKER_27]: that is within the council's purview or is that the mayor or some other body that would make that decision?

3369
04:22:46,086 --> 04:22:51,088
[SPEAKER_27]: I think it might address a lot of the fears and concerns that residents do have.

3370
04:22:51,449 --> 04:22:51,849
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

3371
04:22:52,029 --> 04:22:54,390
[SPEAKER_27]: People who are on fixed incomes and so on.

3372
04:22:55,030 --> 04:22:55,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I can answer.

3373
04:22:55,631 --> 04:22:57,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anyone else want to go first on this question?

3374
04:22:57,631 --> 04:23:02,214
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Councilor Scarpelli and I have been in five tax setting meetings together.

3375
04:23:02,234 --> 04:23:02,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you want to

3376
04:23:04,116 --> 04:23:06,838
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, residential exemption.

3377
04:23:08,139 --> 04:23:20,368
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the panacea, it seems to be A. There is a breakeven point in the home valuations, where if you implement a residential exemption, if your value is above that, you actually start paying more.

3378
04:23:20,988 --> 04:23:28,374
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we implemented a residential exemption, I believe two years ago, that breakeven was almost exactly the average, around 768,000.

3379
04:23:29,315 --> 04:23:32,397
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're above that value, you actually start paying more.

3380
04:23:32,901 --> 04:23:34,342
[SPEAKER_04]: than you did without the exemption.

3381
04:23:34,362 --> 04:23:36,383
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're under that value, you pay less.

3382
04:23:36,584 --> 04:23:45,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the reason this happens is essentially to do this, A, the council would set it, but it would be in partnership with the assessor's office.

3383
04:23:45,130 --> 04:23:51,114
[SPEAKER_04]: The assessor's office has said they probably need to hire two more full-time staff in that office just to process the applications every year.

3384
04:23:52,755 --> 04:23:56,197
[SPEAKER_04]: But essentially, you take what is the flat tax rate,

3385
04:23:57,890 --> 04:24:02,912
[SPEAKER_04]: across all residential, your 8.51 per thousand, I think is our FY 24 rate.

3386
04:24:03,672 --> 04:24:10,374
[SPEAKER_04]: And you create a 30% exemption on the tax of the average home.

3387
04:24:10,414 --> 04:24:14,976
[SPEAKER_04]: So 30% of the tax bill for a $768,000 home, that becomes your exemption.

3388
04:24:15,016 --> 04:24:16,156
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a fixed dollar amount.

3389
04:24:16,176 --> 04:24:17,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say for just for

3390
04:24:18,709 --> 04:24:20,411
[SPEAKER_04]: efficiency sake, let's say that's $3,000.

3391
04:24:21,551 --> 04:24:27,136
[SPEAKER_04]: So if your tax bill is, uh, you know, $6,000, you get $3,000 off.

3392
04:24:27,877 --> 04:24:31,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but that has to be shifted, right?

3393
04:24:31,480 --> 04:24:33,782
[SPEAKER_04]: So the city's actual tax doesn't come down.

3394
04:24:33,802 --> 04:24:36,204
[SPEAKER_04]: The city still needs to raise all the revenue it's raising every year.

3395
04:24:36,824 --> 04:24:38,486
[SPEAKER_04]: So that, that fixed dollar about

3396
04:24:39,514 --> 04:24:41,737
[SPEAKER_04]: actually also means that you increase the tax rate.

3397
04:24:42,238 --> 04:24:45,221
[SPEAKER_04]: So instead of having an 8.51% rate, you might have a 12.5% rate, but then you get the $3,000 off if you're owner occupied.

3398
04:24:45,241 --> 04:24:46,223
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're getting a 30% rate increase,

3399
04:24:55,609 --> 04:24:59,371
[SPEAKER_04]: and you're getting a 30% exemption, if you're in a lower value home, you save money.

3400
04:24:59,411 --> 04:25:01,092
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in a condo, you probably save money.

3401
04:25:01,132 --> 04:25:03,753
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in an under low value single family, you save money.

3402
04:25:03,773 --> 04:25:12,778
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in a multifamily, a high value single family, certainly if you're in a large apartment building, you're actually paying more because the tax rate's going up significantly.

3403
04:25:13,345 --> 04:25:14,585
[SPEAKER_04]: to cover for that shift.

3404
04:25:15,826 --> 04:25:24,308
[SPEAKER_04]: So essentially, it benefits some people in the community, it benefits people who generally condo owners, people in single families below the breakeven point.

3405
04:25:24,948 --> 04:25:31,070
[SPEAKER_04]: And it actually would result in increased taxes for people who have very high valued single family homes.

3406
04:25:31,650 --> 04:25:38,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Most multifamily homes are over 750,000 valuation apartment buildings are so we could implement it.

3407
04:25:39,435 --> 04:25:44,198
[SPEAKER_04]: We would need six months to a year to do so before a tax rate hearing, which happens in December.

3408
04:25:44,258 --> 04:25:48,341
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'd probably need to make a decision by April or May of the prior year.

3409
04:25:48,905 --> 04:25:52,948
[SPEAKER_04]: The assessor's office was ready to be budgeted to hire more staff to process the applications.

3410
04:25:53,588 --> 04:25:57,971
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the end of the day, it doesn't, it's not a panacea for everyone.

3411
04:25:57,991 --> 04:25:59,712
[SPEAKER_04]: I tend to support it anyway.

3412
04:25:59,812 --> 04:26:09,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it turns a flat rate wealth tax into a progressive rate wealth tax, where the rate is actually lower on lower wealth properties and higher on higher wealth properties.

3413
04:26:10,618 --> 04:26:13,180
[SPEAKER_04]: But it doesn't help everyone.

3414
04:26:13,220 --> 04:26:15,982
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't mean, if you're a senior and you're above the break even, you might pay more.

3415
04:26:17,141 --> 04:26:18,241
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not, it doesn't help everyone.

3416
04:26:18,261 --> 04:26:20,082
[SPEAKER_27]: It is something that could be considered.

3417
04:26:20,482 --> 04:26:21,202
[SPEAKER_04]: It certainly is.

3418
04:26:21,362 --> 04:26:22,022
[SPEAKER_27]: And discussed.

3419
04:26:22,282 --> 04:26:24,062
[SPEAKER_04]: We consider it and discuss it every December.

3420
04:26:24,102 --> 04:26:29,963
[SPEAKER_04]: We basically have the conversation I just tried to summarize at our tax rate setting hearings.

3421
04:26:30,663 --> 04:26:32,204
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know there's been different perspectives on it.

3422
04:26:32,244 --> 04:26:38,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been a supporter because I generally tend to think that having that progressive rate system is a better approach than the flat rate.

3423
04:26:38,985 --> 04:26:44,786
[SPEAKER_04]: But similarly, I've heard arguments from my colleagues, Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Knight, who are not on the council, but they were,

3424
04:26:45,560 --> 04:26:53,183
[SPEAKER_04]: concerned about what if you're in a home value above the breakeven point and that's about basically about half of people who are owning properties.

3425
04:26:53,303 --> 04:26:54,823
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it goes either way.

3426
04:26:55,864 --> 04:26:56,124
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

3427
04:26:56,264 --> 04:26:56,624
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

3428
04:26:57,244 --> 04:26:57,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

3429
04:26:58,224 --> 04:26:59,405
[SPEAKER_27]: And thanks again to all of you.

3430
04:27:00,245 --> 04:27:00,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

3431
04:27:01,626 --> 04:27:03,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other stuff on the residential exemption?

3432
04:27:06,107 --> 04:27:06,487
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

3433
04:27:07,067 --> 04:27:07,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you wait?

3434
04:27:07,708 --> 04:27:08,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you wait?

3435
04:27:11,169 --> 04:27:11,489
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

3436
04:27:13,587 --> 04:27:17,732
[SPEAKER_04]: We are now, I think no one, has anyone who has, hold on one second, Andy.

3437
04:27:17,752 --> 04:27:18,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll make a brief though.

3438
04:27:18,733 --> 04:27:19,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Just one second.

3439
04:27:19,614 --> 04:27:19,975
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, sir.

3440
04:27:20,075 --> 04:27:22,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Has anyone not asked a question who wants to ask a question?

3441
04:27:25,060 --> 04:27:26,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, we'll go to public comment.

3442
04:27:26,922 --> 04:27:30,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take Andy, then I'll take Gaston for a second question, then we have Micah on Zoom.

3443
04:27:31,300 --> 04:27:31,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Castagnetti.

3444
04:27:32,041 --> 04:27:33,401
[SPEAKER_17]: All the information is hot.

3445
04:27:33,882 --> 04:27:40,106
[SPEAKER_17]: She's the first person that brought this owner-occupied residential exemption up at this podium.

3446
04:27:40,466 --> 04:27:48,251
[SPEAKER_17]: And as you don't know, I've been here at least 16 years in succession every December to ask for it.

3447
04:27:48,511 --> 04:27:51,413
[SPEAKER_17]: And every single time, it was knocked down.

3448
04:27:52,213 --> 04:27:58,297
[SPEAKER_17]: Basically, it's called Mass General Law, if you want to look it up, Chapter 40B, Section 5C.

3449
04:28:00,183 --> 04:28:05,784
[SPEAKER_17]: And at the maximum, it will be 30% shift of residential values.

3450
04:28:06,545 --> 04:28:13,326
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, as you said, Councilor, they'll come out to be a figure as a cutoff value.

3451
04:28:13,806 --> 04:28:18,468
[SPEAKER_17]: Anything below will receive discounts and real dollars, and above will go up.

3452
04:28:18,488 --> 04:28:20,388
[SPEAKER_17]: 30% is the maximum.

3453
04:28:24,502 --> 04:28:33,427
[SPEAKER_17]: and Somerville does that, and the average Somerville resident that is applicable for it is saving over $3,000, real cash.

3454
04:28:34,407 --> 04:28:37,389
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's more than half of their bill, some of these people.

3455
04:28:37,949 --> 04:28:44,713
[SPEAKER_17]: So anyways, the way I understand the law was my sixth grade education, I read it once, 16 years ago.

3456
04:28:46,102 --> 04:28:56,335
[SPEAKER_17]: The mayor has to ask and approve for it, and the majority of the city council, if that is done and sent to the state house, you get it right away.

3457
04:28:57,056 --> 04:28:57,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Andy.

3458
04:28:59,178 --> 04:29:05,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Gaston, either a question or a comment, and I'm gonna go up to two minutes for everybody for this last little section.

3459
04:29:06,152 --> 04:29:06,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3460
04:29:07,012 --> 04:29:08,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Gastón Fiore, 61 Stickney Road.

3461
04:29:08,713 --> 04:29:16,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to readdress something that I've already addressed, but I heard it here again today, several times actually.

3462
04:29:17,158 --> 04:29:31,325
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the myth, or maybe to use a term that is invoked these days, the misinformation that Proposition 2.5 does not allow a city to increase revenue at a pace that is fast enough to account for inflation.

3463
04:29:31,345 --> 04:29:32,446
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have the numbers here.

3464
04:29:33,568 --> 04:29:40,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first of all, let me say like Procision 2.5 excludes four cases from the limitation tax levy increases.

3465
04:29:40,733 --> 04:29:42,254
[SPEAKER_02]: And one such case is new growth.

3466
04:29:43,154 --> 04:29:48,818
[SPEAKER_02]: So in fiscal year 25, the amount of property taxes collected from new growth is estimated to be 2.5 million.

3467
04:29:48,878 --> 04:29:52,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I have the new number that the assessor gave earlier today.

3468
04:29:52,880 --> 04:29:56,823
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fiscal year 25 new growth, 2.525 million.

3469
04:29:56,863 --> 04:29:58,644
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's more towards my side.

3470
04:29:59,344 --> 04:29:59,644
[SPEAKER_02]: actually.

3471
04:30:00,605 --> 04:30:18,155
[SPEAKER_02]: So together with the statutory 2.5% increase, meaning like the limitation that the city can increase up to, the total fiscal year 2025 property tax revenue increase is approximately 4.3% compared to fiscal year 2024.

3472
04:30:18,936 --> 04:30:25,660
[SPEAKER_02]: So the August PCE, which again is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, was 2.2% on an annual basis.

3473
04:30:28,962 --> 04:30:38,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Hence, Medford is increasing property tax revenue in fiscal year 2025 by over 2% above inflation.

3474
04:30:38,450 --> 04:30:43,374
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are running above inflation by 2.1%.

3475
04:30:44,555 --> 04:30:53,382
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is misinformation that Proposition 2.5 does not allow Medford to increase its revenue faster than 2.5%.

3476
04:30:56,474 --> 04:30:57,775
[SPEAKER_02]: it just depends on new growth.

3477
04:30:58,335 --> 04:31:12,860
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm very happy to hear about the zoning changes to stimulate growth and everything the city can do, because as I always say, it should be relentless forward progress to increase economic growth in the city.

3478
04:31:13,040 --> 04:31:18,562
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you do that, you're gonna be able to fly much higher than the inflation rate.

3479
04:31:18,783 --> 04:31:19,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

3480
04:31:20,563 --> 04:31:21,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Gaston.

3481
04:31:22,364 --> 04:31:25,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else on that comment?

3482
04:31:29,397 --> 04:31:34,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanna note myself, and this is just me being an economics nerd, and I'm really sorry to do this at 10 p.m.

3483
04:31:35,960 --> 04:31:40,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to use the PCE price deflator for state and local government.

3484
04:31:41,563 --> 04:31:46,426
[SPEAKER_04]: It's line 24 on the BEA table of the GDP price deflators.

3485
04:31:46,446 --> 04:31:48,707
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look at that, it tells a little bit of a different story.

3486
04:31:48,767 --> 04:31:54,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Even when PCE for like the average person was 4%, for example, in 2021, for state and local government, it was 6.7.

3487
04:31:54,890 --> 04:31:55,310
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2021, it was,

3488
04:31:59,694 --> 04:32:04,076
[SPEAKER_04]: 7.1, 2022 for PCE, generally it's 8.0 for state and local.

3489
04:32:04,136 --> 04:32:08,358
[SPEAKER_04]: State and local price inflators tend to be higher than the PCE.

3490
04:32:09,158 --> 04:32:11,939
[SPEAKER_04]: It's PCE, but it's just PCE broken down for state and local.

3491
04:32:11,979 --> 04:32:12,919
[SPEAKER_04]: It tends to be higher.

3492
04:32:13,880 --> 04:32:15,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate your comment.

3493
04:32:15,020 --> 04:32:18,122
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree that the new growth element is a factor here, right?

3494
04:32:18,182 --> 04:32:27,025
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think Matt was saying over the last, since 1980, I can't remember the fact, it's not 2.5% that we've averaged, it's 3.1 or something like that because of the new growth.

3495
04:32:27,455 --> 04:32:29,676
[SPEAKER_04]: In the last couple of years, the new growth is significantly higher.

3496
04:32:29,796 --> 04:32:37,038
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we're at like four, but we're also talking about 4% when we're looking at a cost increase of eight, right?

3497
04:32:37,198 --> 04:32:38,978
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's still running behind.

3498
04:32:39,158 --> 04:32:39,518
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

3499
04:32:39,558 --> 04:32:49,961
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're using 2021 or 2022 data, I'm sure that we didn't, we weren't above inflation, but you were catching up where we're flying again, as I said, we're running 2% above.

3500
04:32:50,681 --> 04:32:53,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone put out a great chart where it was showing the real,

3501
04:32:54,765 --> 04:32:59,566
[SPEAKER_04]: a nominal dollar increase and then it also had a graph of the inflation adjusted real dollar increase.

3502
04:33:00,246 --> 04:33:04,687
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think personally we're catching up for 2020 to 2023 here with this override.

3503
04:33:04,967 --> 04:33:05,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

3504
04:33:06,008 --> 04:33:14,190
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but I just want to clarify that if we keep with new growth, we're going to be able to definitely account for what we lost in 2021, 2022.

3505
04:33:16,515 --> 04:33:19,736
[SPEAKER_04]: And to me, now we're going back and forth, and this is just because I- We're already gutting up.

3506
04:33:20,236 --> 04:33:20,816
[SPEAKER_04]: I enjoy this.

3507
04:33:20,956 --> 04:33:33,719
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think this override catches us up to where we need to be, where the new growth, it fits to me what I'm seeing as this is the one time we're going to have to ask for this outside of the high school, because the new growth will get us there in five to 10 years.

3508
04:33:33,779 --> 04:33:39,000
[SPEAKER_04]: And this catches us up from the inflation adjustments that we need over the past few years.

3509
04:33:39,340 --> 04:33:40,660
[SPEAKER_04]: So, thanks.

3510
04:33:43,100 --> 04:33:44,761
[SPEAKER_04]: I like arguing about PC with people.

3511
04:33:46,380 --> 04:33:49,163
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to Zoom, and then we'll go to the podium.

3512
04:33:49,223 --> 04:33:51,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Zoom, I have Mike name and address.

3513
04:33:51,425 --> 04:33:54,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Second question, you have two minutes if you want to ask a question and make a comment.

3514
04:33:55,486 --> 04:33:56,426
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure, yeah.

3515
04:33:56,466 --> 04:33:58,087
[SPEAKER_16]: Micah Kesselman, 499 Main Street.

3516
04:33:59,508 --> 04:34:03,790
[SPEAKER_16]: This is probably a good time to actually sort of bring this question back up again, because I don't think it was really fully answered.

3517
04:34:04,650 --> 04:34:09,693
[SPEAKER_16]: But maybe I didn't phrase it helpfully before.

3518
04:34:09,713 --> 04:34:24,360
[SPEAKER_16]: We've heard a lot of good reasons why we should vote for the override and try and catch up our woefully under-budgeted municipality as something that makes more sense.

3519
04:34:26,976 --> 04:34:40,147
[SPEAKER_16]: What I wanted to get at before and what I want to understand, and really I guess this is a question for Councilor Scapelli, can you articulate an actual actionable alternative plan

3520
04:34:41,280 --> 04:34:43,561
[SPEAKER_16]: to catch our budget up to where it needs to be.

3521
04:34:44,402 --> 04:34:47,844
[SPEAKER_16]: Because as far as I can tell, there is no alternative.

3522
04:34:47,924 --> 04:34:49,345
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't care about transparency.

3523
04:34:49,365 --> 04:34:51,827
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I do, but that's not what the question's about.

3524
04:34:52,947 --> 04:34:56,290
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't need to hear about divisiveness, transparency, or anything like that.

3525
04:34:56,310 --> 04:35:04,295
[SPEAKER_16]: I actually want to hear just, is there an articulable alternative that we could pursue that is actionable and realistic?

3526
04:35:04,935 --> 04:35:13,922
[SPEAKER_16]: And free money, free cash, frankly, is not an answer, because that free cash is a one-time band-aid that's not dependable, not sustainable.

3527
04:35:14,442 --> 04:35:16,604
[SPEAKER_16]: So what's the alternative to the override?

3528
04:35:17,004 --> 04:35:17,325
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

3529
04:35:19,847 --> 04:35:21,548
[SPEAKER_39]: So if I can, Mr. President.

3530
04:35:21,988 --> 04:35:31,235
[SPEAKER_40]: So very simply put is, I've been saying this for months now, is that it's a one-time correction with the free cash to eliminate any fear

3531
04:35:32,603 --> 04:35:35,606
[SPEAKER_40]: and disruption to our whole community.

3532
04:35:36,667 --> 04:35:41,831
[SPEAKER_40]: I've been saying for years that in the last five years, we've had zero new growth.

3533
04:35:42,712 --> 04:35:45,274
[SPEAKER_40]: When you talk about new growth, that is the solution.

3534
04:35:46,435 --> 04:35:52,480
[SPEAKER_40]: The solution to any community's investment in finances is their new growth.

3535
04:35:52,560 --> 04:35:58,605
[SPEAKER_40]: We've done nothing in the city of Medford to hang our hats on other than a beer hall.

3536
04:36:00,117 --> 04:36:04,803
[SPEAKER_40]: We haven't seen anything bring in true funding other than a beer haul.

3537
04:36:06,232 --> 04:36:18,863
[SPEAKER_40]: So, I mean, I've been pretty consistent with what I've been saying, but although you don't wanna look at transparency, I think that's the major issue right now is because the word, the information is not getting out there.

3538
04:36:19,543 --> 04:36:24,688
[SPEAKER_40]: We're voting on something that we've shown so many different reasons why we shouldn't.

3539
04:36:25,088 --> 04:36:26,669
[SPEAKER_40]: There are so many open questions.

3540
04:36:26,990 --> 04:36:30,333
[SPEAKER_40]: There are so many people, actual people that are gonna get hurt.

3541
04:36:31,451 --> 04:36:33,452
[SPEAKER_40]: that to have a solution is very simple.

3542
04:36:33,993 --> 04:36:35,674
[SPEAKER_40]: That's using free cash once.

3543
04:36:36,895 --> 04:36:40,477
[SPEAKER_40]: People keep saying that I'm saying that we do this all the time.

3544
04:36:40,838 --> 04:36:58,250
[SPEAKER_40]: We do this once because this community had over $35 million, over $34 million of free cash that we could have used and then sat together in an open process to see what we can do together as a total community to see what we needed.

3545
04:36:59,070 --> 04:36:59,691
[SPEAKER_40]: We didn't do that.

3546
04:37:00,919 --> 04:37:04,361
[SPEAKER_40]: So again, new growth and development is so important.

3547
04:37:05,002 --> 04:37:13,427
[SPEAKER_40]: We look at the way that our budget was underfunded in certain aspects, but underappreciated.

3548
04:37:13,627 --> 04:37:26,275
[SPEAKER_40]: I think we have to look at so many different options in the future, but what we lacked and the reason why we're here is because our mayor and our administration use one-time funding

3549
04:37:27,438 --> 04:37:31,122
[SPEAKER_40]: to carry her water for the last five and a half years.

3550
04:37:32,603 --> 04:37:34,185
[SPEAKER_40]: This is why we are where we are.

3551
04:37:37,548 --> 04:37:38,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

3552
04:37:39,630 --> 04:37:42,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further comments on that comment or question from members of the council?

3553
04:37:42,954 --> 04:37:44,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, we'll go to the podium.

3554
04:37:45,136 --> 04:37:48,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Our esteemed election commissioner and former school committee member.

3555
04:37:48,541 --> 04:37:49,001
[SPEAKER_37]: when we have.

3556
04:37:49,041 --> 04:37:51,502
[SPEAKER_37]: Attorney Bill O'Keefe, 18 Kilgore Avenue for Mass.

3557
04:37:52,023 --> 04:37:52,923
[SPEAKER_37]: I just wanted to follow up.

3558
04:37:53,003 --> 04:37:58,406
[SPEAKER_37]: I know it's always difficult when you're putting these presentations before the community.

3559
04:37:58,446 --> 04:38:00,567
[SPEAKER_37]: Is the school committee gonna do this as well?

3560
04:38:01,809 --> 04:38:02,209
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't know.

3561
04:38:02,489 --> 04:38:16,416
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, it should be recommended to the school committee, because I know a lot of these folks that talked issues, talked about the school committee issues, and they definitely need to get clarified so there's a clear understanding, so that everybody can understand and appreciate it.

3562
04:38:16,596 --> 04:38:19,858
[SPEAKER_37]: Like, I got a student up at the high school that's part of the vocational program.

3563
04:38:20,438 --> 04:38:26,341
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, I've had all my kids educated at the Medford Public Schools, and I'm happy with the education that's provided at the school system.

3564
04:38:26,621 --> 04:38:30,083
[SPEAKER_37]: I know there were some comments about, I mean, the teachers and where they stand.

3565
04:38:30,663 --> 04:38:33,744
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, it's all in how parents are involved and what the expectation is.

3566
04:38:34,184 --> 04:38:35,545
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, every kid learns differently.

3567
04:38:36,105 --> 04:38:46,928
[SPEAKER_37]: My other concern is with the MCAS also being on the voting block in November, how much money do we dedicate to the MCAS in order to basically prepare for the test?

3568
04:38:47,509 --> 04:38:53,031
[SPEAKER_37]: So there's other money that could be allocated towards whatever funding is needed to maintain a budget.

3569
04:38:53,411 --> 04:38:55,771
[SPEAKER_37]: I was part of the whole recession back in 2010, 2011,

3570
04:38:57,432 --> 04:38:59,953
[SPEAKER_37]: where everybody was getting laid off and everybody lost their job.

3571
04:39:00,373 --> 04:39:02,094
[SPEAKER_37]: It was the community that maintained everything.

3572
04:39:02,194 --> 04:39:02,634
[SPEAKER_37]: You know what I mean?

3573
04:39:02,654 --> 04:39:02,994
[SPEAKER_10]: My time.

3574
04:39:03,114 --> 04:39:04,035
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, you were a student there.

3575
04:39:04,055 --> 04:39:05,496
[SPEAKER_37]: So, you know what I mean?

3576
04:39:05,516 --> 04:39:08,377
[SPEAKER_37]: You got to understand how this gets presented to everybody.

3577
04:39:08,877 --> 04:39:12,599
[SPEAKER_37]: You're on 23 different community channels throughout Massachusetts.

3578
04:39:12,839 --> 04:39:13,439
[SPEAKER_37]: You know what I mean?

3579
04:39:13,459 --> 04:39:15,520
[SPEAKER_37]: Because we're on Comcast and you're on Verizon.

3580
04:39:15,880 --> 04:39:26,885
[SPEAKER_37]: So how you present yourself and what you talk about here gets presented to leaders of industry, to people that are looking to do development, to do projects, that build businesses.

3581
04:39:27,705 --> 04:39:35,065
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, so the decorum and how things get presented, you guys got to look at how that's being done and what messages is being presented.

3582
04:39:35,546 --> 04:39:36,548
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, just tonight alone.

3583
04:39:37,068 --> 04:39:43,433
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, the one thing I just haven't seen is a real plan or an understanding of a plan for six, seven, and eight.

3584
04:39:43,953 --> 04:39:45,795
[SPEAKER_37]: And I'm sure it'll come out and it'll get concise.

3585
04:39:46,195 --> 04:39:47,356
[SPEAKER_37]: You guys are working through it.

3586
04:39:47,656 --> 04:39:51,539
[SPEAKER_37]: There's a need to rip off the bandaid and figure out how money's going to get allocated and spent.

3587
04:39:52,100 --> 04:39:56,263
[SPEAKER_37]: But it's a presentation that you make not only to the community, but to everyone else in the commonwealth.

3588
04:39:56,904 --> 04:40:05,030
[SPEAKER_37]: And if I can, with your situation in terms of the lead paint, I mean, the lead in the water, did you get your child tested?

3589
04:40:08,046 --> 04:40:09,007
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we're going to go back.

3590
04:40:09,027 --> 04:40:10,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we're going to go direct on.

3591
04:40:10,628 --> 04:40:12,790
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm just asking because it's always a concern.

3592
04:40:12,810 --> 04:40:14,431
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, I know that was the biggest thing.

3593
04:40:14,771 --> 04:40:21,416
[SPEAKER_37]: I was just at a meeting today with Treasurer Goldberg, and they have money.

3594
04:40:21,476 --> 04:40:22,377
[SPEAKER_37]: It's called Swirl.

3595
04:40:22,437 --> 04:40:22,958
[SPEAKER_37]: It's an account.

3596
04:40:23,638 --> 04:40:28,061
[SPEAKER_37]: that they put in 170 schools in order to have water bubblers that are fresh water.

3597
04:40:28,081 --> 04:40:38,288
[SPEAKER_37]: And I'm not sure if that's been allocated or looked at as a resource, but she just presented that today at a community meeting for businesses and what she's doing with the schools.

3598
04:40:38,348 --> 04:40:40,249
[SPEAKER_37]: So that might be something you guys want to take a look at.

3599
04:40:40,970 --> 04:40:42,491
[SPEAKER_37]: My understanding of the acronym is SWIRL.

3600
04:40:43,772 --> 04:40:45,053
[SPEAKER_37]: And they have a lot of money for that.

3601
04:40:45,553 --> 04:40:48,095
[SPEAKER_37]: But if there's lead in the water and stuff like that,

3602
04:40:48,835 --> 04:40:53,898
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, should probably let the community and the kids know they should get tested just to make sure that they're not exposed to it.

3603
04:40:54,439 --> 04:40:55,519
[SPEAKER_37]: But I thank you for your time.

3604
04:40:56,740 --> 04:40:57,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

3605
04:40:58,701 --> 04:40:59,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Council Vice President Collins.

3606
04:41:00,213 --> 04:41:01,374
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, President Bears.

3607
04:41:01,454 --> 04:41:07,518
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't have a direct comment to that last question that was made, but I really appreciate it, appreciate the resources that were shared as well and the recommendations.

3608
04:41:09,320 --> 04:41:20,668
[SPEAKER_24]: I just wanted to note that it's quite a late hour and we actually have a second meeting to get to after this, so I would not motion, but request that we now proceed to public participation and then adjourn and take up the agenda items on our regular meeting agenda.

3609
04:41:21,569 --> 04:41:28,014
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion to adjourn the Committee of the Whole and move to our regular meeting agenda by Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Fleming.

3610
04:41:29,244 --> 04:41:33,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Matt saying we have been going for a while.

3611
04:41:33,327 --> 04:41:37,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I need a little bit of a break and it will take us about 10 minutes to get the zoom going for the regular meeting.

3612
04:41:39,111 --> 04:41:40,612
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have a number of items on.

3613
04:41:40,792 --> 04:41:45,295
[SPEAKER_04]: So on that motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll or on this motion.

3614
04:41:45,315 --> 04:41:45,956
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor.

3615
04:41:46,596 --> 04:41:47,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Opposed motion passes.
