[SPEAKER_03]: Present, seven present, none absent.

[SPEAKER_03]: All please rise and salute our flag.

15
00:12:48,830 --> 00:13:00,680
[SPEAKER_03]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

[SPEAKER_03]: April 3rd meeting?

22
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:14,388
Okay.

23
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:25,632
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just want to make sure everybody realizes that we voted to buy and purchase those.

24
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:29,534
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the ambulance company doesn't purchase them, who do we need them for this?

25
00:13:29,795 --> 00:13:30,655
[SPEAKER_03]: They have ordered them.

26
00:13:31,336 --> 00:13:32,917
[SPEAKER_03]: We just don't have a date of delivery yet.

27
00:13:33,037 --> 00:13:33,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, great.

28
00:13:33,817 --> 00:13:34,157

[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

50
00:14:02,268 --> 00:14:02,989

00:14:04,749 --> 00:14:05,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Report of the secretary.

53
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,590
[SPEAKER_13]: There is none.

54
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Report of committees.

55
00:14:08,451 --> 00:14:10,511
[SPEAKER_03]: None.

56
00:14:10,531 --> 00:14:11,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Community participation.

57
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:14,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Hearing and seeing none.

58
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Report of the superintendent, report on Connors Scholarship Program.

59
00:14:20,601 --> 00:14:21,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Superintendent.

60
00:14:21,981 --> 00:14:26,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor and members of the school committee, you have heard undoubtedly about the Connors Scholarship Program.

61
00:14:27,943 --> 00:14:33,445
[SPEAKER_08]: It was created through the generosity of James and Thelma Connors.

62
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,805
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got the information in front of you.

63
00:14:37,106 --> 00:14:43,908
[SPEAKER_08]: People of modest means or apparently of modest means until the very end when their investments became

64
00:14:45,283 --> 00:14:53,029
[SPEAKER_08]: available to the city and through the work of Attorney John Granara, former Mayor Mike McGlynn, and Stephen Andrew.

65
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:56,811
[SPEAKER_08]: It was put together into a scholarship program.

66
00:14:57,492 --> 00:15:05,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Amelia Jensen is here, our Director of Guidance, and she is reaching out to students to apply for this program.

67
00:15:06,418 --> 00:15:07,359
[SPEAKER_08]: The details are here.

68
00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:16,537
[SPEAKER_08]: rather than go through it, but it's obviously a very generous activity and we're pleased to have it.

69
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

70
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:17,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Johnson.

71
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, good evening, Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson, and members of the school committee.

72
00:15:22,281 --> 00:15:25,882
[SPEAKER_10]: We had a pretty successful turnout for students applying for the scholarship.

73
00:15:26,382 --> 00:15:39,004
[SPEAKER_10]: While we don't know exact final numbers, since we do not collect the scholarship applications, we've had between 50 to 60 students ask counselors for the recommendation forms to be filled out.

74
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:42,605
[SPEAKER_10]: So we expect at least 50 or 60 students to apply for the scholarship.

75
00:15:43,805 --> 00:15:45,346
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a wonderful scholarship.

76
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:52,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Like Mr. Bellson said, there are $33,000 scholarships that could go to Medford students.

77
00:15:53,295 --> 00:15:57,379
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're really hoping that many from Medford High School will be able to be awarded.

78
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:58,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.

79
00:16:00,202 --> 00:16:00,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

80
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:00,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Disceri?

81
00:16:05,034 --> 00:16:07,634
[SPEAKER_12]: This is such a wonderful thing.

82
00:16:07,674 --> 00:16:12,476
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like a dream come true for our Medford students.

83
00:16:13,696 --> 00:16:23,499
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, we can't express our appreciation to Jim and Thelma Connors, but we certainly owe them a huge debt of thanks for our students.

84
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:28,020
[SPEAKER_12]: And I appreciate all the people who are working on this to make sure that it is administered

85
00:16:29,176 --> 00:16:31,498
[SPEAKER_12]: correctly and that our students will benefit.

86
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,802
[SPEAKER_12]: I do hope that we receive a list of all the students who received them.

87
00:16:36,983 --> 00:16:37,663
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

88
00:16:38,104 --> 00:16:38,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

89
00:16:39,585 --> 00:16:40,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Benedetto.

90
00:16:40,386 --> 00:16:47,892
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to thank your office for taking on this responsibility and getting this information out to our students.

91
00:16:48,392 --> 00:16:52,836
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope it helps a lot of, you know,

92
00:16:54,899 --> 00:17:06,598
[SPEAKER_16]: students that normally wouldn't get a high end scholarship because the GPA is very reasonable and it's for the average working hard student and I'm really glad to see that.

93
00:17:07,214 --> 00:17:08,234
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the, yeah, I'm sorry.

94
00:17:08,254 --> 00:17:09,955
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for your office and your help.

95
00:17:09,975 --> 00:17:11,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you're welcome.

96
00:17:11,715 --> 00:17:25,558
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things that was really exciting about this scholarship is although they look at academic record and demonstrated leadership, they also look at work experience and any type of hardships that students have overcome, and they weigh those things somewhat equally.

97
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:34,320
[SPEAKER_10]: So some of our students who may have had to take a job to help support family or take care of their siblings aren't going to be ruled out for this scholarship.

98
00:17:35,381 --> 00:17:35,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

99
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing.

100
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:37,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

101
00:17:37,253 --> 00:17:37,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Kurtz.

102
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:38,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, hi.

103
00:17:38,714 --> 00:17:39,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ms.

104
00:17:39,494 --> 00:17:39,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Jensen.

105
00:17:39,894 --> 00:17:40,934
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a great report.

106
00:17:41,915 --> 00:17:56,580
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to duplicate what Erin said, but I was going to say that I thought it was a really fair grade point average, where it ranged from 2.3 to higher levels, which is good for some students who might not be at the same grade level as others.

107
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,682
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just a wonderful, generous opportunity for our students.

108
00:18:01,922 --> 00:18:03,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much for the report.

109
00:18:03,623 --> 00:18:03,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

110
00:18:05,522 --> 00:18:05,682
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

111
00:18:05,722 --> 00:18:06,102
[SPEAKER_15]: Cuno.

112
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:07,524
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Ms.

113
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:11,247
[SPEAKER_15]: Jensen, to you and to your staff for being involved in this.

114
00:18:12,087 --> 00:18:17,932
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope, though, that as the students are applying for this scholarship, they really understand how they're receiving this money.

115
00:18:18,632 --> 00:18:19,974
[SPEAKER_15]: I think there's a huge lesson here.

116
00:18:19,994 --> 00:18:22,836
[SPEAKER_15]: This is just, it's an incredible story.

117
00:18:23,256 --> 00:18:23,917
[SPEAKER_15]: It really is.

118
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:34,305
[SPEAKER_15]: And for people that are listening and maybe don't know the whole story, the bottom line is that we had two people in our own city that lived

119
00:18:34,873 --> 00:18:39,694
[SPEAKER_15]: very modestly, and have now given, you know, they were over what?

120
00:18:40,254 --> 00:18:42,535
[SPEAKER_15]: The modest life yields, $4 million.

121
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,415
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a huge lesson.

122
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:54,058
[SPEAKER_15]: And the lesson I hope that our students get from this, and for everyone actually that listens, is this is why you always treat everybody equally, because you just don't know what happens and what's underneath anything.

123
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,698
[SPEAKER_15]: And to read the story, it was just a fabulous story.

124
00:18:56,758 --> 00:19:00,059
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually shared it a little bit today with some people that I work with.

125
00:19:00,784 --> 00:19:16,834
[SPEAKER_15]: They said, I hope the city really promotes this story, because not only what they have done, but also to give the opportunity to all students, because sometimes students don't feel that they could apply for all scholarships.

126
00:19:17,214 --> 00:19:19,496
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is something really tremendous.

127
00:19:19,876 --> 00:19:20,556
[SPEAKER_15]: But I thank you.

128
00:19:20,876 --> 00:19:21,457
[SPEAKER_03]: It is wonderful.

129
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

130
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

131
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:26,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a motion to receive in place on file?

132
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:27,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to receive in place on file.

133
00:19:27,723 --> 00:19:28,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded by Ms.

134
00:19:28,404 --> 00:19:28,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Van de Kloot.

135
00:19:29,244 --> 00:19:29,965
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

136
00:19:30,465 --> 00:19:30,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

137
00:19:30,685 --> 00:19:31,406
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

138
00:19:31,486 --> 00:19:32,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

139
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:37,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Report on class of 2017 college university acceptances.

140
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:43,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Making a return appearance is Amelia Jensen to tell you about the college acceptances to date.

141
00:19:43,293 --> 00:19:47,596
[SPEAKER_08]: This is still preliminary, but we wanted to give you a sense of what was happening out there for the time being.

142
00:19:48,425 --> 00:19:50,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, so the students inform the guidance department.

143
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:52,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Their deadline is May 11th.

144
00:19:53,386 --> 00:20:00,508
[SPEAKER_10]: And they inform us of all of the places that they were accepted, as well as where they have chosen to go, and their post-secondary plans.

145
00:20:01,649 --> 00:20:11,592
[SPEAKER_10]: So right now, again, this is preliminary numbers, but we've had 220 students report that they have been accepted to over 225 different colleges and universities.

146
00:20:11,692 --> 00:20:16,013
[SPEAKER_10]: And there should be an attachment that lists all of the colleges and universities.

147
00:20:16,613 --> 00:20:19,556
[SPEAKER_10]: I did want to highlight a few because this was an exceptional year.

148
00:20:20,117 --> 00:20:32,129
[SPEAKER_10]: We have had a student get into Brown University, Duke University, Harvard, Tufts University, Wellesley College, Yale University, all of the UMass schools, and many, many state schools.

149
00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:36,873
[SPEAKER_10]: and many more schools that you can look at on the attached sheet.

150
00:20:37,273 --> 00:20:42,017
[SPEAKER_10]: We also have some students who are waitlisted at some pretty good schools, so we're still waiting to hear if they have been accepted.

151
00:20:43,218 --> 00:20:51,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Decision day is May 1st, so students will be making that decision or should have already made that decision, and again should be letting us know where they're going.

152
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:55,993
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's where we stand with colleges.

153
00:20:56,874 --> 00:21:00,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Many students also have received scholarships and awards already.

154
00:21:01,058 --> 00:21:04,021
[SPEAKER_10]: We had one student who became a national merit finalist.

155
00:21:04,962 --> 00:21:11,009
[SPEAKER_10]: One student won a Posse scholarship, which is a full-ride scholarship, and this student will be attending Bucknell University.

156
00:21:11,872 --> 00:21:20,006
[SPEAKER_10]: We had a student receive a Fulbright scholarship to Duke University because of soccer, one to Tufts University because of academics, and many more.

157
00:21:20,106 --> 00:21:23,472
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, that's also a list that we will be collecting.

158
00:21:25,277 --> 00:21:31,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Two Medford vocational technical students are currently enrolled in apprenticeship programs at night to become plumbers.

159
00:21:31,982 --> 00:21:37,586
[SPEAKER_10]: So what they're doing is they're already a year ahead of their peers, so they're going to school during the day and at night.

160
00:21:38,347 --> 00:21:39,948
[SPEAKER_10]: So that is also very exceptional.

161
00:21:41,109 --> 00:21:48,755
[SPEAKER_10]: And this was the first year that many students, I believe over 35 students, have chosen alternative post-secondary

162
00:21:49,815 --> 00:21:51,557
[SPEAKER_10]: plans and options for their future.

163
00:21:52,258 --> 00:22:06,190
[SPEAKER_10]: And by this, what I mean is these are students who have below a 2.5 GPA and historically would not have been accepted to a four-year school, so they would have gone to community college or they would have chosen some other route.

164
00:22:06,971 --> 00:22:11,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Instead of that, we were able to offer them other programs and opportunities

165
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:17,078
[SPEAKER_10]: through the Rockland Earn and Learn program, Year Up, Match Beyond, and many more.

166
00:22:17,298 --> 00:22:24,082
[SPEAKER_10]: And what these programs offer is work experience and scholarships to go to college.

167
00:22:25,342 --> 00:22:27,943
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can go into more detail if you have specific questions on this.

168
00:22:29,824 --> 00:22:30,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

169
00:22:31,165 --> 00:22:31,545
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

170
00:22:33,446 --> 00:22:33,606
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

171
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:34,026
[SPEAKER_15]: Cuno.

172
00:22:34,467 --> 00:22:34,867
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

173
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:35,767
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you again, Ms.

174
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:36,788
[SPEAKER_15]: Jensen, for this report.

175
00:22:37,308 --> 00:22:41,150
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, extremely proud of our students.

176
00:22:42,003 --> 00:22:49,417
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just encourage, I know that we did it last year for the graduation pamphlet, if we could add this on to the graduation pamphlet again.

177
00:22:49,437 --> 00:22:54,366
[SPEAKER_15]: And maybe even a little bit of the, you know, where the students

178
00:22:55,005 --> 00:22:58,228
[SPEAKER_15]: that received a couple of scholarships, just to give an idea.

179
00:22:58,248 --> 00:23:15,883
[SPEAKER_15]: And the reason I say that is that we had had this discussion, I was on the psych council for the high school and the vocational school for many years, and what happened is that our students do get accepted to great schools, but sometimes, because of financial reasons, they choose other schools.

180
00:23:16,904 --> 00:23:22,730
[SPEAKER_15]: I heard people in the audience that were saying, oh, our Meffitt students are all going to this school or that school.

181
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,872
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm not saying that one school is better than the other.

182
00:23:25,252 --> 00:23:29,977
[SPEAKER_15]: But they were leaving the graduation just thinking that our students were going to particular schools.

183
00:23:30,657 --> 00:23:35,342
[SPEAKER_15]: And when we approached it, we said, it's not fair to the students.

184
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:45,462
[SPEAKER_15]: Because parents or relatives that come or people that just come to the graduation or just see where our students end up going doesn't necessarily mean that's where they've only been accepted to.

185
00:23:45,742 --> 00:23:54,209
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it's very important for the school, but also for the students, to let people know how hard they've worked and where they've been accepted to.

186
00:23:54,469 --> 00:23:56,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we definitely plan on putting that on the graduation booklet.

187
00:23:57,031 --> 00:23:57,351
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.

188
00:23:57,391 --> 00:23:57,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

189
00:23:59,192 --> 00:23:59,953
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto.

190
00:24:00,713 --> 00:24:05,237
[SPEAKER_16]: Just out of curiosity, do you know how many students have been accepted to Tufts University this year?

191
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:07,256
[SPEAKER_03]: 7 to 9?

192
00:24:08,136 --> 00:24:08,556
[SPEAKER_03]: 7 or 9?

193
00:24:09,076 --> 00:24:10,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the last time I heard, I thought it was 7.

194
00:24:11,077 --> 00:24:13,198
[SPEAKER_10]: But it could have, there could be more.

195
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:17,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there was 7 accepted, and there were multiple wait lists.

196
00:24:18,001 --> 00:24:18,321
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

197
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:19,901
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're still waiting to hear on this.

198
00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:20,522
[SPEAKER_16]: Good to know.

199
00:24:20,882 --> 00:24:29,966
[SPEAKER_16]: I really, since we have one of the best colleges in the world here in our city, I really like that partnership.

200
00:24:30,474 --> 00:24:35,897
[SPEAKER_16]: with Tufts University, and I know that they look closely at taking both Method and some of those students.

201
00:24:35,957 --> 00:24:41,621
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm just always curious as to how many get accepted, and then how many can afford to go after that.

202
00:24:41,721 --> 00:24:48,124
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know that Tufts can be generous at times with our students, having a daughter who graduated from there.

203
00:24:50,206 --> 00:24:56,729
[SPEAKER_16]: But also because I want to keep that opportunity for our children in our community.

204
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:57,630
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it's a great

205
00:24:58,135 --> 00:25:00,356
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like a world-renowned school now.

206
00:25:00,557 --> 00:25:04,099
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's got people from all over the world coming.

207
00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:04,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

208
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:06,880
[SPEAKER_10]: They've been working very well with our department.

209
00:25:06,921 --> 00:25:10,082
[SPEAKER_10]: They reach out to us monthly.

210
00:25:10,663 --> 00:25:14,005
[SPEAKER_10]: They ask for names of students who are on the Honor Society.

211
00:25:14,565 --> 00:25:16,466
[SPEAKER_10]: And they do personal outreach to our students.

212
00:25:16,486 --> 00:25:19,688
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're very good with our population.

213
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:20,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

214
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Skerry.

215
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:28,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Has the guidance office been apprised of any students who received substantial scholarships to go to their schools?

216
00:25:29,123 --> 00:25:34,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Not yet, so they'll fill that information out when they get their graduation caps and gowns, which is mid-May.

217
00:25:35,165 --> 00:25:35,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

218
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:35,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

219
00:25:37,325 --> 00:25:37,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

220
00:25:37,505 --> 00:25:37,965
[SPEAKER_10]: van de Kloot.

221
00:25:38,606 --> 00:25:41,586
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I just, it's always nice to see the list.

222
00:25:41,626 --> 00:25:50,889
[SPEAKER_12]: It's particularly nice to see that we've got a student accepted into Yale this year, because that's a very difficult school to have an acceptance, so I was particularly happy to see

223
00:25:51,356 --> 00:25:53,016
[SPEAKER_12]: that a Medford student had made it to Yale.

224
00:25:53,356 --> 00:25:55,677
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think it's been a while since that's happened.

225
00:25:56,417 --> 00:25:56,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

226
00:25:56,877 --> 00:26:00,838
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a motion to receive and place on file by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

227
00:26:00,898 --> 00:26:01,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Cunha.

228
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:02,098
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

229
00:26:02,738 --> 00:26:03,418
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

230
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

231
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:05,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

232
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:06,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Ms.

233
00:26:06,219 --> 00:26:06,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Jensen.

234
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:08,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Report on opiate prevention grant.

235
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Superintendent.

236
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:15,261
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we all realize that the opiate issue is becoming very, very substantial.

237
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,161
[SPEAKER_08]: It has been very substantial.

238
00:26:17,181 --> 00:26:21,062
[SPEAKER_08]: The Massachusetts amount of opiate exceeds the national average.

239
00:26:22,021 --> 00:26:31,703
[SPEAKER_08]: So for opiate deaths and the like, and it affects marriages, it affects jobs, families, neighborhoods, and all kinds of things out there that are not good.

240
00:26:33,323 --> 00:26:38,504
[SPEAKER_08]: So through the work of Tony and Rachel, we have another grant.

241
00:26:39,144 --> 00:26:43,805
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll let them explain it because I think it's a really good item for us right now.

242
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:45,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

243
00:26:45,345 --> 00:26:45,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

244
00:26:45,485 --> 00:26:46,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Vento?

245
00:26:46,145 --> 00:26:49,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, Mayor Burke, Superintendent, and school committee members.

246
00:26:49,883 --> 00:26:53,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Rachel and I are here to talk about the Youth Opioid Prevention Grant.

247
00:26:54,187 --> 00:27:02,953
[SPEAKER_05]: This grant was funded by a settlement with CVS and Walgreen over fraudulent practices around opioid prescriptions.

248
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:10,719
[SPEAKER_05]: And Attorney General Maura Healey used $500,000 to fund the program.

249
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:18,626
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were looking for programs that would address the opioid addiction and dependence.

250
00:27:19,595 --> 00:27:21,135
[SPEAKER_05]: programs that would be sustainable.

251
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:33,298
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're very happy to announce that we were awarded $18,000 for our programs here to augment the many different things we've been doing.

252
00:27:33,358 --> 00:27:39,959
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're really focusing now on building skills, as Rachel will talk about, with our younger elementary students.

253
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:42,880
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

254
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,480
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking to use the grant funding kind of a four-prong approach.

255
00:27:47,641 --> 00:27:49,281
[SPEAKER_00]: First, education of our students.

256
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:55,373
[SPEAKER_00]: education of our faculty, education of our parents, and education of our community.

257
00:27:55,994 --> 00:27:59,417
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we're looking to do is purchase more Michigan model kits.

258
00:27:59,937 --> 00:28:04,661
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, we have kits at the elementary schools, but they are shared between the teachers.

259
00:28:05,221 --> 00:28:11,867
[SPEAKER_00]: By using this money, we can purchase one kit for every teacher so that they all have all of their own kits, all of their own information.

260
00:28:12,707 --> 00:28:19,393
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd also like to provide yearly parent education forums about substance use and prevention,

261
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:27,475
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd also like to do faculty training on identification of substance use, risky behaviors, and preventative strategies.

262
00:28:27,755 --> 00:28:29,736
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a yearly training that we would offer.

263
00:28:31,137 --> 00:28:42,726
[SPEAKER_00]: Increasing community awareness by having resources for education and student support actually posted on our school website, our health website, that will help people in the community that are looking for information.

264
00:28:43,567 --> 00:28:47,630
[SPEAKER_00]: And then strengthening our partnerships with community organizations.

265
00:28:47,967 --> 00:28:59,009
[SPEAKER_00]: the youth soccer leagues, the youth basketball leagues, working with their coaches to actually teach them some of the information within the Michigan model so they can share it with their athletes and with their parents as well.

266
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:02,530
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be assessing the program as well.

267
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:16,832
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to actually start to look at the survey results for the communities that care survey so we can make a comparison 2017 and 2019 to see what we have done, see if it has made a difference within the survey results.

268
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,431
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll also be assessing each program.

269
00:29:19,451 --> 00:29:25,255
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have surveys after each program is done to kind of assess how it went and where we're going from there.

270
00:29:26,876 --> 00:29:29,858
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll also be doing pre and post assessments of the Michigan model.

271
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:30,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

272
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:31,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent work.

273
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:32,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

274
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:32,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

275
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:35,202
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto.

276
00:29:35,342 --> 00:29:35,762
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

277
00:29:36,202 --> 00:29:37,003
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

278
00:29:37,023 --> 00:29:44,508
[SPEAKER_16]: $18,000 towards educational services regarding drug addiction in any way, shape, or form.

279
00:29:44,528 --> 00:29:46,329
[SPEAKER_16]: There's money coming in and we don't

280
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:54,670
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm really happy to see that they've allocated funds throughout the community, and we were recipient of such a large sum.

281
00:29:55,650 --> 00:30:02,452
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to talk to you a little bit about working with Penny from the city side, because she's amazing, and her department is amazing.

282
00:30:02,532 --> 00:30:04,453
[SPEAKER_03]: They do work very closely now.

283
00:30:04,693 --> 00:30:07,174
[SPEAKER_16]: So she might have some ideas.

284
00:30:07,674 --> 00:30:11,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Penny sat on the planning board when we wrote this grant.

285
00:30:11,916 --> 00:30:12,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

286
00:30:12,216 --> 00:30:15,557
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were able to listen to her.

287
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:21,611
[SPEAKER_05]: feedback about it and she was very helpful for us in putting together the application.

288
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:29,112
[SPEAKER_05]: They also funded our parent forum with Dr. Ruth Poteet that we had a couple weeks ago.

289
00:30:30,213 --> 00:30:34,113
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were very pleased to be able to do that for our community.

290
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:43,775
[SPEAKER_16]: My other only suggestion is as far as the community piece, we have a group in the community, Method Against Addiction, and it's really well run and well

291
00:30:44,995 --> 00:30:49,737
[SPEAKER_16]: developed, and they really have the hands on what's happening in that community.

292
00:30:50,797 --> 00:30:54,178
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would reach out to that group as well.

293
00:30:54,378 --> 00:30:57,599
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, they're phenomenal, and they're very receptive and very helpful.

294
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,740
[SPEAKER_16]: And my last piece is for the parents.

295
00:31:01,481 --> 00:31:06,122
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that Cheryl just received an award from the- Citizen of the Year.

296
00:31:06,622 --> 00:31:07,362
[SPEAKER_16]: Citizen of the Year.

297
00:31:07,422 --> 00:31:13,324
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've attended her, I've been to her group to observe what goes on there.

298
00:31:13,725 --> 00:31:14,765
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's for the parents.

299
00:31:15,453 --> 00:31:16,634
[SPEAKER_16]: of people who are addicted.

300
00:31:17,014 --> 00:31:18,514
[SPEAKER_16]: And everybody thinks it's the older.

301
00:31:18,995 --> 00:31:23,456
[SPEAKER_16]: It could also be students within our district.

302
00:31:24,077 --> 00:31:27,458
[SPEAKER_16]: And just get that perspective as well.

303
00:31:27,478 --> 00:31:38,603
[SPEAKER_16]: So you're getting both the school, the city side, the great program, Method Against Addiction, which brings people together, make them feel like a family.

304
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:43,425
[SPEAKER_16]: And you're also getting adults that are struggling with, how do I cope with this?

305
00:31:43,925 --> 00:31:44,485
[SPEAKER_16]: type of thing.

306
00:31:44,505 --> 00:31:51,087
[SPEAKER_16]: So we could really, you know, unite as one with, I know it's only 18,000, but that's, that's a good amount of money.

307
00:31:51,147 --> 00:31:52,448
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's just some different ideas.

308
00:31:52,528 --> 00:32:00,571
[SPEAKER_16]: Cause if you do an outreach, speak to the people that you're going to outreach to, the parents, the people in the sit-in street, et cetera.

309
00:32:01,411 --> 00:32:01,791
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

310
00:32:02,311 --> 00:32:05,752
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, just want to add a couple of comments that I just heard at the start.

311
00:32:05,852 --> 00:32:08,273
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's way beyond a start.

312
00:32:08,313 --> 00:32:13,515
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been spending a lot of money, a lot of commitment to this topic from the city perspective.

313
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:25,623
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that Penny and her team, there's quite a few that are part of her team now, and they do outreach, they do coaching, they connect people with beds if need be to get them in for treatment, and the post.

314
00:32:26,324 --> 00:32:31,908
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot going on, and I know you've been working closely with them as it is, so keep up the good work.

315
00:32:31,928 --> 00:32:32,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

316
00:32:32,248 --> 00:32:33,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

317
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:34,030
[SPEAKER_16]: Good grant.

318
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,411
[SPEAKER_16]: One more thing, ma'am.

319
00:32:36,111 --> 00:32:36,892
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, sorry.

320
00:32:37,512 --> 00:32:38,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Can she just finish?

321
00:32:38,513 --> 00:32:38,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

322
00:32:39,795 --> 00:33:01,674
[SPEAKER_16]: So I also, about two years ago, the governor had people come out to the community, and I went to a few of the meetings, they were in Somerville, and they were trying to figure out what the state needed to do as a team, and they were talking about mandates for schools and stuff, and I raised my hand, and I was like, are they gonna be funded mandates, or are they gonna be burdened to the cities?

323
00:33:02,194 --> 00:33:05,417
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was assured that, of course, they would be funded mandates.

324
00:33:05,803 --> 00:33:13,564
[SPEAKER_16]: But I haven't seen those mandates yet, and I was wondering if the superintendent had gotten any mandates yet from- Funded mandates.

325
00:33:13,584 --> 00:33:15,345
[SPEAKER_16]: Or unfunded.

326
00:33:15,745 --> 00:33:20,286
[SPEAKER_08]: The word fun is not really a good way to begin the word funded.

327
00:33:20,386 --> 00:33:21,266
[SPEAKER_16]: Or even unfunded.

328
00:33:21,326 --> 00:33:23,546
[SPEAKER_16]: Are there any new mandates within the school district?

329
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:24,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there'll be several.

330
00:33:24,686 --> 00:33:25,767
[SPEAKER_16]: But they haven't come out yet.

331
00:33:25,847 --> 00:33:32,768
[SPEAKER_08]: The governor was doing- They're starting to emerge right now, because I think the biggest thing you have to understand is a lot of things coming out, but they're always underfunded.

332
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:37,719
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, so there's a few dollars put to them, but then there's not enough to really carry them out.

333
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:40,721
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll see some of the budget report that we're going to talk about.

334
00:33:41,241 --> 00:33:41,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

335
00:33:41,642 --> 00:33:56,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, one of them recently was the SBIRT screening that the training was funded for, but we were able to conduct the screening at no cost to the district, just using our resources that we have in the health services and guidance counseling departments.

336
00:33:57,366 --> 00:34:00,707
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to thank you both for writing the grant.

337
00:34:00,827 --> 00:34:04,168
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to, since you mentioned her,

338
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:32,731
[SPEAKER_12]: Tony, that I know Mrs. Kretz and myself were able to attend Dr. Ruth Pote's talk, which was just exceptional.

339
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:38,612
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody in the audience who, and I've talked to people since, have said it was one of the best things that they've attended.

340
00:34:39,032 --> 00:34:42,113
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope that at some point we might be able to bring her back again.

341
00:34:42,733 --> 00:34:47,375
[SPEAKER_12]: She truly was... It was a wonderful event and I'm so glad that I was able to attend.

342
00:34:47,895 --> 00:34:48,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

343
00:34:48,275 --> 00:34:49,175
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad you enjoyed it.

344
00:34:50,396 --> 00:34:50,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

345
00:34:50,596 --> 00:34:50,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Kretz?

346
00:34:51,663 --> 00:34:56,446
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to mention that I went to the forum, you know, with Paulette Nye, and it was just amazing.

347
00:34:56,506 --> 00:34:57,927
[SPEAKER_09]: And she was a great, great speaker.

348
00:34:57,987 --> 00:34:59,789
[SPEAKER_09]: And everybody was so engaged.

349
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:00,569
[SPEAKER_09]: It was wonderful.

350
00:35:00,589 --> 00:35:02,370
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a great grant.

351
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,431
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just terrific.

352
00:35:04,092 --> 00:35:11,477
[SPEAKER_09]: And I love how there's going to be more parent forums and more facility training, increased community awareness.

353
00:35:12,097 --> 00:35:18,021
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just wanted to make sure, because I know when the original grant was written, the expenses added up to $20,000.

354
00:35:18,061 --> 00:35:19,282
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wanted to make sure that

355
00:35:21,002 --> 00:35:33,672
[SPEAKER_09]: there was going to be enough funding available, or if you had to add something to the budget this year, so that you could, you know, continue with the new teacher training and prevention, the presentations.

356
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:40,978
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't sure if, you know, was this like kind of a little bit of an estimate, or do you think you'll find out?

357
00:35:41,279 --> 00:35:49,225
[SPEAKER_05]: No, this is the grant, the total that we will receive, but we looked through and we were able to slim down on some administrative costs.

358
00:35:51,035 --> 00:35:56,317
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to make sure that you get to put through everything that you want to put through because it's so wonderful.

359
00:35:56,797 --> 00:36:03,780
[SPEAKER_05]: The most important piece of it, the Michigan model kits we kept because that really starts building the foundation at the kindergarten level.

360
00:36:05,742 --> 00:36:13,506
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to say again, as my colleagues have said, thank you for your hard work and for getting us this grant.

361
00:36:14,346 --> 00:36:17,708
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that you have collaborated with different organizations.

362
00:36:18,028 --> 00:36:30,693
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just curious in knowing, I know that the city council has their meetings once a month with the police chief and the police department, and they're going from one community, well, one part of our city to another.

363
00:36:31,093 --> 00:36:31,994
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was just curious if

364
00:36:32,534 --> 00:36:38,076
[SPEAKER_15]: If it was something that you guys have ever attended, maybe just to get the word out of when you're going to have a parent meeting?

365
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:46,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we attended and did a presentation a couple years ago at a city council meeting.

366
00:36:47,741 --> 00:36:57,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I also attend a monthly National Alliance of Mental Illness meeting that is held at the police station, so we share a lot of ideas at that monthly meeting.

367
00:36:58,726 --> 00:37:01,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Stacey Shulman also attends with me from the school side.

368
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:31,872
[SPEAKER_15]: This wasn't necessarily just to show it to the city council, but where they're having their meetings in the different sections of the city, I know your schedules are, you know, they're piled as it is, but just to like, you don't have to stay there the whole night, but just to get the word out maybe, when they do have their meetings, of giving them the information of what you're working on, maybe the next time you are having a parent meeting, or you know, when you're scheduling a yearly meeting, just to, even if you could bring a flyer, or just give it to the chief and have him bring it to those meetings.

369
00:37:32,242 --> 00:37:33,323
[SPEAKER_15]: Just to get the word out again.

370
00:37:33,343 --> 00:37:40,728
[SPEAKER_03]: The police chief has been having community meetings the first Wednesday of every month, ongoing for forever.

371
00:37:40,768 --> 00:37:42,689
[SPEAKER_03]: He's done differently now.

372
00:37:43,009 --> 00:37:45,050
[SPEAKER_03]: He's actually going into the neighborhoods to host them.

373
00:37:45,651 --> 00:37:51,335
[SPEAKER_03]: So people, a little more localized, but I believe it's Wednesday night at 6 at the senior center.

374
00:37:51,475 --> 00:37:53,316
[SPEAKER_15]: This week it's going to be tomorrow night.

375
00:37:53,336 --> 00:37:54,517
[SPEAKER_15]: Senior center at 6, Wednesday.

376
00:37:54,917 --> 00:37:55,297
[SPEAKER_15]: Wednesday.

377
00:37:55,317 --> 00:37:56,018
[SPEAKER_15]: Today's Tuesday.

378
00:37:56,038 --> 00:37:56,238
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

379
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:03,093
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, a motion to receive this report and place on file by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

380
00:38:03,113 --> 00:38:03,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Kretz.

381
00:38:03,454 --> 00:38:04,294
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

382
00:38:04,635 --> 00:38:04,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

383
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:05,615
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

384
00:38:05,856 --> 00:38:06,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

385
00:38:07,537 --> 00:38:11,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Recommendation to approve school committee meeting schedule for the school year 17-18.

386
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Superintendent.

387
00:38:14,122 --> 00:38:14,942
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in front of you.

388
00:38:15,022 --> 00:38:16,203
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a standard schedule.

389
00:38:17,304 --> 00:38:20,086
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a motion on the floor for approval, seconded by Ms.

390
00:38:20,106 --> 00:38:20,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Mustone.

391
00:38:21,948 --> 00:38:22,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call.

392
00:38:22,428 --> 00:38:22,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

393
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:24,930
Estrella?

394
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:25,891
Yes.

395
00:38:26,451 --> 00:38:26,851
Mr. Benedetto?

396
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:27,332
Yes.

397
00:38:33,318 --> 00:38:35,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

398
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

399
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Recommendation to reject school choice for year 17-18.

400
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:43,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion for approval by Ms.

401
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:44,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Vanden Heuvel, seconded by Ms.

402
00:38:44,468 --> 00:38:44,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuno.

403
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:46,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call.

404
00:38:47,551 --> 00:38:48,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call vote, please.

405
00:38:57,052 --> 00:39:04,157
[SPEAKER_03]: So this report we commissioned earlier this year to get us a robust look at our network and all the infrastructure that's necessary to support

406
00:39:15,443 --> 00:39:17,625
[SPEAKER_08]: the expanded use of technology in the schools.

407
00:39:17,685 --> 00:39:20,587
[SPEAKER_08]: And what you have is, I think, a very thorough report.

408
00:39:21,428 --> 00:39:27,873
[SPEAKER_08]: It gives us some pathways to pursue and strengthen our capacities to use technology efficiently.

409
00:39:28,553 --> 00:39:33,157
[SPEAKER_08]: It also enables us to access our tier two funding in support of upgrades.

410
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:37,500
[SPEAKER_08]: These reports, as I mentioned, are very technical and extensive.

411
00:39:38,521 --> 00:39:45,266
[SPEAKER_08]: But they're provided to you so that you can take your time to go through them and perhaps develop a deeper understanding of the complexity

412
00:39:45,768 --> 00:39:50,833
[SPEAKER_08]: that we'll take to integrate technology into our programs in the public schools.

413
00:39:51,814 --> 00:39:56,859
[SPEAKER_08]: The recommendation provides several key steps that we can take without a burdensome cost.

414
00:39:56,879 --> 00:39:58,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of these things are just doable.

415
00:39:58,481 --> 00:39:59,322
[SPEAKER_08]: We just have to do them.

416
00:40:00,144 --> 00:40:06,945
[SPEAKER_08]: And it still is important for us to recognize that there are heavy requirements of testing, state reporting, electronic data management.

417
00:40:07,186 --> 00:40:12,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Communication requires we have finely tuned, robust, and reliable capacity to meet our obligations.

418
00:40:12,507 --> 00:40:21,068
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, well, it's not part of this report, some staffing that has to be done so that we can maintain these systems the way we need to.

419
00:40:21,809 --> 00:40:23,069
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not a one-time thing.

420
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:24,309
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll do it.

421
00:40:24,329 --> 00:40:27,090
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be with us for a while in terms of the infrastructure.

422
00:40:28,698 --> 00:40:39,587
[SPEAKER_08]: There'll be many upgrades that'll always be required as more things are added and more people are trying to do things and more devices are played with, but this is a very, very good investment.

423
00:40:40,388 --> 00:40:48,134
[SPEAKER_08]: So I recommend, first of all, that you would read the executive summaries because that gives you enough of a background to understand what's being involved.

424
00:40:48,963 --> 00:40:54,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, you'll find some materials that talk about the category two E-rate funding estimates.

425
00:40:55,328 --> 00:41:03,335
[SPEAKER_08]: And under this program, we can access $398,100 of federal funds with a $265,000, $400 match.

426
00:41:05,377 --> 00:41:08,499
[SPEAKER_08]: We're currently soliciting bids and completing E-rate applications.

427
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,264
[SPEAKER_08]: We will seek capital funding to meet this infrastructure need in the weeks ahead.

428
00:41:16,463 --> 00:41:23,970
[SPEAKER_08]: It's clear that other things need to be done in terms of devices and equipment, but that's not part of this particular activity.

429
00:41:25,712 --> 00:41:36,182
[SPEAKER_08]: If we don't do it this year, I have a feeling some of this stuff may not be available to school systems or libraries next year because of some of the domestic cutbacks that are being considered in Washington.

430
00:41:37,098 --> 00:41:44,562
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd like to act on this now, and I'd like to let you know that we're working actively on this.

431
00:41:44,822 --> 00:41:52,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Kirstine is working closely on the financial part and on the technical part as well with Steve Kelly of TechEdge.

432
00:41:52,626 --> 00:41:55,328
[SPEAKER_08]: And I look forward to moving this forward.

433
00:41:55,868 --> 00:41:56,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy to take any questions.

434
00:41:57,009 --> 00:41:58,009
[SPEAKER_08]: And Kirstine's here as well.

435
00:41:58,589 --> 00:41:58,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

436
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:01,271
[SPEAKER_12]: Van De Kloot.

437
00:42:01,631 --> 00:42:01,811
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

438
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:30,675
[SPEAKER_12]: an opportunity to review this report in detail and I did look at all of the findings and although there was much that I didn't understand as a novice in this area, there were other parts that just make common sense as they were talking about, you know, areas where all of a sudden it would get too crowded, if you would, and somehow or another it just seemed one of the most comprehensive and clearly it's something we need to move ahead on.

439
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:34,913
[SPEAKER_12]: Is the next appropriate step to have a committee of the whole to review this?

440
00:42:36,077 --> 00:42:37,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we can do that if you want.

441
00:42:37,378 --> 00:42:38,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we need to?

442
00:42:38,258 --> 00:42:45,903
[SPEAKER_08]: We certainly want to move forward because we want to be able to file our applications and take advantage of bids that are out there.

443
00:42:45,943 --> 00:42:47,825
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you want to come into the hall, we can schedule it.

444
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:55,330
[SPEAKER_08]: We are going to have a very busy schedule in the month of May and early June because of a number of things, including school council reports and the like.

445
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:57,191
[SPEAKER_08]: But happy to schedule it if this is what you want to do.

446
00:42:57,411 --> 00:43:03,015
[SPEAKER_12]: Personally, I'm comfortable with just authorizing the administration to move ahead if my colleagues are.

447
00:43:04,795 --> 00:43:08,077
[SPEAKER_03]: We would still have to come back for a formal vote in any case.

448
00:43:09,398 --> 00:43:12,199
[SPEAKER_03]: And then send it for an appropriation paper to the city council.

449
00:43:14,221 --> 00:43:14,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a motion?

450
00:43:16,762 --> 00:43:17,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Benedetto.

451
00:43:18,303 --> 00:43:19,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

452
00:43:19,123 --> 00:43:25,507
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so this is the recommendation that we have to move forward.

453
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:29,229
[SPEAKER_16]: And if we move forward with this, we would need to receive $265,400 match.

454
00:43:32,574 --> 00:43:34,355
[SPEAKER_16]: and we would get close to $400,000.

455
00:43:34,515 --> 00:43:35,235
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

456
00:43:35,495 --> 00:43:35,676
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

457
00:43:37,196 --> 00:43:47,401
[SPEAKER_16]: I also would like to know what we're budgeting in addition to this on an annual basis to make sure that we're also making a commitment on a line item in our budget as well.

458
00:43:47,701 --> 00:43:56,866
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we did the $3 million bond a few years ago for technology, and then we had a few slow years, and then we're asking for more.

459
00:43:57,226 --> 00:44:00,868
[SPEAKER_16]: What I'd like to see is a commitment to technology throughout our system.

460
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:09,831
[SPEAKER_16]: throughout every year so that way we don't, you know, when these opportunities arise, it's for bonus stuff, not the everyday stuff.

461
00:44:10,612 --> 00:44:13,156
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you understand what I'm saying, superintendent?

462
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:21,987
[SPEAKER_08]: what our plans are internally because we're still refining them somewhat because we still have to figure out how much money is available to us operationally.

463
00:44:22,467 --> 00:44:33,369
[SPEAKER_08]: But we will plan to buy devices with the regular budget in addition to some of the other, you know, things we've typically done because in order to use the network, you have to have more devices.

464
00:44:34,009 --> 00:44:35,810
[SPEAKER_08]: And probably a lot of Chromebooks.

465
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:39,931
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll see this in the school council reports.

466
00:44:39,971 --> 00:44:41,071
[SPEAKER_08]: People are asking for these things.

467
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:41,971
[SPEAKER_08]: We need them for testing.

468
00:44:41,991 --> 00:44:42,932
[SPEAKER_08]: We need them for reporting.

469
00:44:42,952 --> 00:44:44,912
[SPEAKER_08]: There are a few other devices we will need.

470
00:44:45,569 --> 00:44:48,511
[SPEAKER_08]: But the infrastructure is something that we can bond.

471
00:44:48,992 --> 00:44:51,394
[SPEAKER_08]: And the infrastructure is something that we can get E-rate money for.

472
00:44:51,454 --> 00:44:54,036
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what we need to really go after right now.

473
00:44:54,116 --> 00:44:58,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's money that we wouldn't typically put in an operating budget.

474
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:03,203
[SPEAKER_08]: So yes, you'll see substantial dollars put to this.

475
00:45:03,243 --> 00:45:04,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus, there's also some staff needs.

476
00:45:05,224 --> 00:45:08,627
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to have to try and put that in place and work that around as well.

477
00:45:10,228 --> 00:45:10,449
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

478
00:45:10,469 --> 00:45:10,749
[SPEAKER_15]: Cuno.

479
00:45:11,438 --> 00:45:16,400
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, just point of clarification, I want to make sure that I'm understanding this.

480
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:20,341
[SPEAKER_15]: So the 265-4, that will come out of the capital plan money.

481
00:45:20,521 --> 00:45:22,382
[SPEAKER_15]: That does not- That's the plan.

482
00:45:22,402 --> 00:45:22,842
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the plan.

483
00:45:22,862 --> 00:45:23,722
[SPEAKER_08]: That is not our budget.

484
00:45:23,902 --> 00:45:26,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Christine, did you want to come up and comment on any of these things?

485
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's financial stuff that she's working closely with.

486
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:32,693
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

487
00:45:32,713 --> 00:45:43,455
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, just also a clarification that we are in the process of reviewing the major procurements that are involved with the E-rate priority two funding.

488
00:45:43,855 --> 00:45:47,996
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a substantial process of which we have a federal deadline of May 11th.

489
00:45:48,376 --> 00:45:57,058
[SPEAKER_14]: So timing is of great importance in this particular case to make sure that we can maximize their major matching funding piece.

490
00:45:57,558 --> 00:45:59,678
[SPEAKER_14]: What we have on our procurement

491
00:46:00,152 --> 00:46:06,817
[SPEAKER_14]: are the infrastructure switches, the major firewalls, and all of the wireless access points throughout the entire district.

492
00:46:07,357 --> 00:46:18,766
[SPEAKER_14]: So we are looking at analyzing the best case scenarios that we can utilize the funds and or maximize what the contribution will be.

493
00:46:18,886 --> 00:46:28,313
[SPEAKER_14]: So some of our bids are coming in, well, they were much better than they had been projected out from a rough calculation.

494
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:34,813
[SPEAKER_14]: The competitive process is definitely very good in terms of getting best pricing.

495
00:46:35,214 --> 00:46:51,226
[SPEAKER_14]: We are seeing that based on the quantities that are needed and the level of extensions and infrastructure renovations that we're looking at do cause a couple of overages in certain categories.

496
00:46:51,566 --> 00:46:55,369
[SPEAKER_14]: So we are still in the process of having that final analysis done.

497
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:59,012
[SPEAKER_14]: We're getting clarifications back from the vendors as well.

498
00:46:59,653 --> 00:47:07,478
[SPEAKER_14]: So although this is an estimated figure, I would advise that we do not hang our hat on this exact number at this point in time.

499
00:47:08,038 --> 00:47:09,859
[SPEAKER_03]: When is the application due?

500
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:11,080
[SPEAKER_14]: May 11th.

501
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:18,945
[SPEAKER_14]: May 11th in terms of what we would be identifying as our project in terms of going forward with the funding.

502
00:47:19,005 --> 00:47:20,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Not funding approval.

503
00:47:20,366 --> 00:47:20,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

504
00:47:20,986 --> 00:47:28,911
[SPEAKER_14]: It is not a commitment to actual the purchasing and procurement process, but it is saying that

505
00:47:29,398 --> 00:47:40,362
[SPEAKER_14]: to the federal government, yes, we are identifying that this is a priority and we anticipate in fiscal year 18 to provide XYZ amount for this purpose.

506
00:47:40,442 --> 00:47:43,063
[SPEAKER_15]: So when would the deadline be after this?

507
00:47:43,623 --> 00:47:52,506
[SPEAKER_15]: Like if we have May 11th, we have, okay, everything goes through, this is us just basically saying that we are interested in this, this is what we want to do.

508
00:47:52,926 --> 00:47:53,806
[SPEAKER_15]: When is the deadline?

509
00:47:53,866 --> 00:47:57,988
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I just want to make sure we have plenty of time to come back to the board here

510
00:47:59,465 --> 00:48:05,908
[SPEAKER_15]: and take the vote the proper way, and make sure that you have enough time to get all the information you need.

511
00:48:06,348 --> 00:48:08,609
[SPEAKER_15]: But if I'm not mistaken, we also have to go to the city council.

512
00:48:08,629 --> 00:48:08,909
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

513
00:48:09,149 --> 00:48:15,311
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just don't want to have another fiasco at the last, not that we're doing it, I'm just saying I don't want to hear another fiasco.

514
00:48:15,511 --> 00:48:17,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's go over this now, okay?

515
00:48:17,732 --> 00:48:20,233
[SPEAKER_08]: The federal government, we put this report in, we put an E-rate

516
00:48:21,112 --> 00:48:23,713
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, a funding request in every year, the general E-rate.

517
00:48:23,753 --> 00:48:24,393
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Tier 2.

518
00:48:24,453 --> 00:48:26,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Tier 1, we generally get $50,000 to $60,000.

519
00:48:26,693 --> 00:48:31,674
[SPEAKER_08]: It's changed a little bit because of the change from telecommunications to other things.

520
00:48:31,714 --> 00:48:34,235
[SPEAKER_08]: We generally, that's independent of this, okay?

521
00:48:34,795 --> 00:48:41,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Tier 2 is a special infrastructure type funding that's designed to give us more robust capability.

522
00:48:42,157 --> 00:48:48,058
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll put this in on May 11th, and then we've got to wait for the federal government to actually formally approve it.

523
00:48:49,614 --> 00:48:57,701
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we don't put it in on May 11th, and we don't put this in, we won't be eligible to ask for the money later on.

524
00:48:57,781 --> 00:49:04,247
[SPEAKER_08]: So the actual spending process will take place after we have more of a discussion on the details.

525
00:49:04,847 --> 00:49:06,529
[SPEAKER_15]: Which is fine, and I totally understand that.

526
00:49:06,589 --> 00:49:15,238
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just trying to figure out how much time that we have from May 11th to the actual time that we have to... Well, we're going to hold patent until we hear back from the federal government.

527
00:49:15,378 --> 00:49:18,180
[SPEAKER_03]: We could go in with an estimate to the council to get the bulk.

528
00:49:18,461 --> 00:49:22,965
[SPEAKER_03]: We could do that if we wanted to just secure it a little earlier than later.

529
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:23,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

530
00:49:23,786 --> 00:49:27,650
[SPEAKER_14]: So that we could actually have the work and service done.

531
00:49:28,277 --> 00:49:30,178
[SPEAKER_14]: identified and ready to go forward.

532
00:49:30,478 --> 00:49:35,661
[SPEAKER_15]: Because if I'm not mistaken it has to be done also before the budget is, oh no, because it has nothing to do with it.

533
00:49:35,741 --> 00:49:36,562
[SPEAKER_15]: I apologize for that.

534
00:49:36,662 --> 00:49:54,992
[SPEAKER_08]: You just want to get an authorization to move forward if you can because you know otherwise what you lose the opportunity to access it and I'm willing to bet, not willing to bet, but I think it's a pretty good bet that this funding will start to disappear with the next federal budget and I think if we don't you know act we won't have this opportunity.

535
00:49:56,072 --> 00:49:56,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

536
00:49:56,272 --> 00:49:56,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Mustone.

537
00:49:57,997 --> 00:50:02,761
[SPEAKER_11]: On page 16 from the back, I think it's the easiest way to see it.

538
00:50:03,081 --> 00:50:05,443
[SPEAKER_11]: Page 16 from the back.

539
00:50:06,043 --> 00:50:11,967
[SPEAKER_11]: So under traffic to and from different schools, I list our schools and devices.

540
00:50:14,409 --> 00:50:15,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are handheld devices.

541
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:20,393
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have high school 311, Andrews 239, Brooks 95, Columbus 82, McGlynn 693, and Roberts 99.

542
00:50:25,694 --> 00:50:30,439
[SPEAKER_11]: So what accounts for such a drastic difference in the number of devices at schools?

543
00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:31,340
[SPEAKER_08]: People using.

544
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,442
[SPEAKER_08]: It's use.

545
00:50:33,482 --> 00:50:33,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

546
00:50:33,743 --> 00:50:37,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Some places will be more technologically involved than other places.

547
00:50:37,307 --> 00:50:43,153
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, but we've always heard that the Andrews was like our IT school to go to, but this is Sabbath and McGlynn.

548
00:50:43,393 --> 00:50:44,915
[SPEAKER_08]: McGlynn is two schools in one, remember?

549
00:50:45,992 --> 00:50:51,036
[SPEAKER_11]: So even if we cut it in half, it still seems like it's substantially more.

550
00:50:51,116 --> 00:50:52,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, just the way it is.

551
00:50:52,197 --> 00:50:53,819
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, some places use technology.

552
00:50:54,439 --> 00:50:57,762
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the traffic for a snapshot in time.

553
00:50:58,002 --> 00:50:59,363
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not in totality.

554
00:50:59,603 --> 00:51:02,005
[SPEAKER_14]: So it was a day of monitoring.

555
00:51:02,286 --> 00:51:05,628
[SPEAKER_14]: So not all of your devices would be on in one particular day.

556
00:51:05,648 --> 00:51:08,391
[SPEAKER_14]: Not all of them would be captured for every single school.

557
00:51:08,911 --> 00:51:14,436
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't think that that's a clear delineation that that's the number of devices

558
00:51:15,067 --> 00:51:17,007
[SPEAKER_14]: period in each of those schools.

559
00:51:17,327 --> 00:51:23,669
[SPEAKER_14]: It's what was captured on the activity for the log that they were monitoring the traffic across the internet connections.

560
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:25,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Is anyone else shocked though?

561
00:51:25,909 --> 00:51:31,730
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm assuming that it's, we took a snapshot at about the same time at each school, right?

562
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:34,871
[SPEAKER_11]: People work, they probably worked seven to three in school hours.

563
00:51:35,471 --> 00:51:42,312
[SPEAKER_11]: So as a parent who's now worried about kids in their device usage at school as well as home, it seems

564
00:51:42,776 --> 00:51:46,180
[SPEAKER_11]: So the percentage-wise goes from 1% to 67%.

565
00:51:46,861 --> 00:51:48,864
[SPEAKER_11]: That seems like a red flag.

566
00:51:48,924 --> 00:51:51,047
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not an IT person, so I don't know what I'm missing.

567
00:51:52,328 --> 00:51:54,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, we're talking about a snapshot in time.

568
00:51:55,472 --> 00:51:57,395
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking about an attempt to find out the

569
00:51:57,913 --> 00:51:59,955
[SPEAKER_08]: capacity of the network to handle traffic.

570
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:02,618
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, it was done on a few days here and there.

571
00:52:02,638 --> 00:52:09,044
[SPEAKER_08]: It can't be done every day because obviously we'd be paying, you know, a lot of money for a study that would happen every day.

572
00:52:09,625 --> 00:52:11,487
[SPEAKER_08]: And it just happens this is what's coming through.

573
00:52:11,507 --> 00:52:12,788
[SPEAKER_08]: So it gives us an idea of what

574
00:52:13,269 --> 00:52:18,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Traffic would look like on maybe a normal day, but maybe it doesn't totally reflect everyday.

575
00:52:18,976 --> 00:52:22,520
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks really low for the most part, besides the McGlynn.

576
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:23,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Something's missing.

577
00:52:24,543 --> 00:52:25,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Ms.

578
00:52:25,444 --> 00:52:25,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Pugno.

579
00:52:47,162 --> 00:52:52,865
[SPEAKER_03]: But even the high school 7% is tremendously something could we talk to the tech edge people?

580
00:52:53,305 --> 00:53:08,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we can we can get some comment Because then on page 8 from the beginning Finding one that we're paying internet connection at the high school and at the McGlynn And I know that I have heard that

581
00:53:08,564 --> 00:53:10,605
[SPEAKER_11]: At the Andrews, it's very slow.

582
00:53:10,965 --> 00:53:12,526
[SPEAKER_11]: They're connection a lot of days.

583
00:53:13,067 --> 00:53:15,488
[SPEAKER_11]: So why isn't a finding for the Andrews as well?

584
00:53:15,828 --> 00:53:18,410
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess it would have been helpful to have a Tech Edge person here.

585
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:19,270
[SPEAKER_11]: So we can bring them in.

586
00:53:19,711 --> 00:53:20,291
[SPEAKER_11]: We can bring them in.

587
00:53:20,311 --> 00:53:22,472
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be easier.

588
00:53:22,492 --> 00:53:24,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring them to a school committee meeting versus a committee in the hall.

589
00:53:25,594 --> 00:53:26,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that'd be great.

590
00:53:26,314 --> 00:53:26,775
[SPEAKER_11]: We can do that.

591
00:53:27,155 --> 00:53:30,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to table the report until Tech Edge can come in.

592
00:53:33,562 --> 00:53:38,365
[SPEAKER_11]: They already did it without us.

593
00:53:39,746 --> 00:53:41,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Christine, do you want a formal vote?

594
00:53:42,568 --> 00:53:43,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's a good idea.

595
00:53:43,809 --> 00:53:47,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so that we can move forward with the federal deadline.

596
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:51,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a motion to submit a formal request to the federal government?

597
00:53:53,155 --> 00:53:53,895
[SPEAKER_03]: So moved by Ms.

598
00:53:53,915 --> 00:53:55,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Vanderkloof, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

599
00:53:55,616 --> 00:53:56,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call.

600
00:54:06,151 --> 00:54:07,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

601
00:54:07,971 --> 00:54:08,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

602
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:09,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Kirsten.

603
00:54:10,912 --> 00:54:12,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Pre-budget report, building and grounds.

604
00:54:13,433 --> 00:54:14,933
[SPEAKER_08]: So, John, where are you?

605
00:54:16,914 --> 00:54:22,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Now appearing on our stage, John.

606
00:54:23,756 --> 00:54:29,638
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, buildings and grounds obviously is a big area for us.

607
00:54:30,512 --> 00:54:36,394
[SPEAKER_08]: And you have a lot of interest in this, and I just want to comment before John talks about his specifics.

608
00:54:36,474 --> 00:54:49,879
[SPEAKER_08]: But as I told you in a prior meeting, that it's my intent to augment the building repair line by 200,000, which would then be distributed among the schools for the various projects that we've all been talking about.

609
00:54:50,459 --> 00:54:54,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Because quite frankly, the budget that we have will get used up for

610
00:54:55,558 --> 00:55:01,605
[SPEAKER_08]: general maintenance and it will be used up for things that go boom in the night.

611
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:07,372
[SPEAKER_08]: So this would give us some flexibility in doing some of the repairs.

612
00:55:07,432 --> 00:55:12,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Now the major piece for the high school, we want to see where the SOI takes us.

613
00:55:13,478 --> 00:55:15,900
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's some other aspects of the high school, which John will address.

614
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:21,624
[SPEAKER_08]: But the SOI is what we submitted to the MSBA and see where that goes.

615
00:55:21,704 --> 00:55:29,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Because obviously, if we get money from them, that's going to be a lot bigger amount than we would be able to fund ourselves internally.

616
00:55:29,529 --> 00:55:34,372
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a lot going on, but I wanted to have a chance to take a look at some of the things moving through this area.

617
00:55:34,933 --> 00:55:36,834
[SPEAKER_08]: And John, do you have your copy of your report?

618
00:55:36,954 --> 00:55:37,074
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

619
00:55:37,134 --> 00:55:42,738
[SPEAKER_08]: So why don't you talk a little bit about what's in your report, and I'll be happy to augment it as we go.

620
00:55:51,361 --> 00:55:54,964
[SPEAKER_08]: The $200,000 that you're adding to the budget this year, is that going to be annually from this point on?

621
00:55:55,044 --> 00:55:56,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know.

622
00:55:56,265 --> 00:55:59,667
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we have to sit down and have that discussion.

623
00:55:59,687 --> 00:56:01,548
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think that that particular line item should grow.

624
00:56:01,568 --> 00:56:04,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether it should grow $200,000, $300,000, or $150,000 is something we can look at.

625
00:56:04,951 --> 00:56:08,633
[SPEAKER_08]: It also depends to some degree on what else we can get funding for.

626
00:56:09,194 --> 00:56:16,399
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think the concept is to put a few more dollars in this thing so we can address very specific topics that you have an interest in.

627
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:41,567
[SPEAKER_08]: uh... and we can do it with assurance rather than have to wait to see how many things go bum in the night uh... you know which we have to deal with emergency funding uh... like we did get a couple of pipes this year and the year before and so on and so forth so it would give us more flexibility but how much it really depends on you know the projects we identify and where we go with it Mr. McLaughlin Good evening Mayor Burke, Superintendent Dawson, committee

628
00:56:43,785 --> 00:56:48,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Our district is 1.2 million square feet.

629
00:56:49,749 --> 00:56:52,031
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're busy, we're very busy at all times.

630
00:56:52,211 --> 00:56:56,894
[SPEAKER_01]: We take a lot of work orders, a lot of requests.

631
00:56:57,834 --> 00:57:06,040
[SPEAKER_01]: And this year we were busy at Medford High School with the A building pipe replacement, which was something that we had hoped to

632
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:22,703
[SPEAKER_01]: take on with the capital plan, but it just, uh, so happened that we, we had to make the repairs and, um, Mayor Burak has come up with the money to replace the front doors up in Bedford high school and door 31.

633
00:57:22,983 --> 00:57:32,225
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the pool door, which is going to be, uh, a big improvement, especially where we have the new studio vestibule and matching everything up.

634
00:57:32,265 --> 00:57:33,966
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we're going to look into probably, um,

635
00:57:35,473 --> 00:57:38,435
[SPEAKER_01]: some signage, too, for the main entrance of Mefford High School.

636
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:44,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think that sometimes it can be a little confusing for people when they do come to the entrance.

637
00:57:44,858 --> 00:57:54,203
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that the signage is something that I think that we can probably work with the vocational school to get something done that will be appropriate.

638
00:57:55,464 --> 00:57:57,785
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's had a chance to read the report.

639
00:57:58,346 --> 00:58:00,327
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.

640
00:58:02,368 --> 00:58:02,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Miss Mustone.

641
00:58:02,848 --> 00:58:03,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Mayor.

642
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:15,712
[SPEAKER_11]: And I also want to thank Carolyn Montello, a mom from the Brooks, who had reached out to me with some great ideas about how to improve the facade of the high school.

643
00:58:15,732 --> 00:58:20,593
[SPEAKER_11]: And we had the opportunity to meet with John and the mayor at different times and Mr. Belson.

644
00:58:21,273 --> 00:58:27,835
[SPEAKER_11]: So one concern was the pool door that whacks you when you walk in and the staircase

645
00:58:28,537 --> 00:58:32,959
[SPEAKER_11]: about trying to make that look better and you had mentioned that you would try to get a quote for us?

646
00:58:33,299 --> 00:58:40,622
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, well I've been in discussions with Superintendent Belson and we're trying to come up with a plan.

647
00:58:40,662 --> 00:58:41,022
[SPEAKER_01]: I have

648
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,820
[SPEAKER_01]: received a couple of quotes.

649
00:58:43,461 --> 00:58:49,342
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll just be a decision process whether we decide to move forward on it.

650
00:58:50,122 --> 00:58:51,523
[SPEAKER_01]: I will recommend that we do.

651
00:58:52,563 --> 00:59:00,165
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe if we do, we can have in-house staff make some of the floor repairs that need to be made.

652
00:59:00,205 --> 00:59:07,427
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do want to get a couple more opinions or a couple more quotes and then see where we can go from there.

653
00:59:08,104 --> 00:59:11,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Would it be going over the asbestos?

654
00:59:11,367 --> 00:59:22,235
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think we've talked about the possibility of doing that, but at this point in time it may just be better off to abate that area.

655
00:59:24,237 --> 00:59:28,300
[SPEAKER_01]: The first quote that came in, it wasn't as much as I thought it was going to be, truthfully.

656
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,882
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll hash it out and we'll discuss it.

657
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:36,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, if it works out, maybe it'll be a good summer project.

658
00:59:36,612 --> 00:59:40,994
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to close the entrance down for a few days and work with it.

659
00:59:41,214 --> 00:59:46,976
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, like I said, I think we can have our in-house staff take over after they complete.

660
00:59:47,937 --> 00:59:50,658
[SPEAKER_11]: The other was the community school entrance.

661
00:59:50,838 --> 00:59:54,980
[SPEAKER_11]: When you're walking in, the blue paint and the rebar was showing in the wall.

662
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,161
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been fixed.

663
00:59:57,021 --> 00:59:58,062
[SPEAKER_11]: And scaffolding.

664
00:59:58,082 --> 00:59:59,662
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be painted, but it's been fixed.

665
00:59:59,682 --> 01:00:00,743
[SPEAKER_11]: But the scaffolding.

666
01:00:02,106 --> 01:00:05,549
[SPEAKER_11]: So scaffolding, can that be done for the light fixtures that are broken in the ceiling?

667
01:00:05,569 --> 01:00:07,270
[SPEAKER_01]: The construction kids are going to do it for us.

668
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:11,333
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping that they have it set up before the end of school.

669
01:00:11,713 --> 01:00:13,534
[SPEAKER_01]: But either way, we'll have it set up for the summer.

670
01:00:14,215 --> 01:00:15,816
[SPEAKER_01]: On your to-do list.

671
01:00:15,836 --> 01:00:19,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Director Riccio's kids are going to set it up for us, and then we'll go up.

672
01:00:20,259 --> 01:00:29,386
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm hoping that maybe we can do some painting, too, in the ceiling, as well as take down the fans and do a couple of other things, yeah.

673
01:00:29,867 --> 01:00:33,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Should I, Carolyn, if you're watching, text me what else I'm forgetting.

674
01:00:33,369 --> 01:00:34,730
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to video that, John.

675
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:36,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, John.

676
01:00:36,611 --> 01:00:45,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I know that she did have a request about the baseboard up around the gymnastics area, and I had it tested.

677
01:00:46,336 --> 01:00:53,060
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can remove it ourselves, so we don't have to worry about any problems with it.

678
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,081
[SPEAKER_01]: It's non-asbestos.

679
01:00:55,181 --> 01:00:55,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, great.

680
01:00:55,601 --> 01:00:55,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

681
01:00:55,941 --> 01:00:57,382
[SPEAKER_01]: We can work on that, too.

682
01:00:58,953 --> 01:01:01,154
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it does depend on time.

683
01:01:02,535 --> 01:01:20,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I did request a carpenter, but he has been around for a long time, so he does get time off in the summer, and the summer is a short window, so if he could ever, he's been around for 30 years, he does a great job, and if there's ever a time, maybe we can get him some help, that would be good.

684
01:01:20,503 --> 01:01:21,143
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be great.

685
01:01:21,884 --> 01:01:23,404
[SPEAKER_11]: How many carpenters did you used to have?

686
01:01:27,255 --> 01:01:29,498
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been up to high school for 30 years.

687
01:01:31,139 --> 01:01:34,784
[SPEAKER_01]: There was probably four or five of them, I think, in 1987 when I came on.

688
01:01:36,466 --> 01:01:37,307
[SPEAKER_01]: He does a good job.

689
01:01:37,387 --> 01:01:39,209
[SPEAKER_01]: He does a real good job.

690
01:01:39,349 --> 01:01:42,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Mary Jo, our secretary, she does a fantastic job.

691
01:01:43,093 --> 01:01:44,595
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very lucky.

692
01:01:45,196 --> 01:01:46,497
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some really good people.

693
01:01:49,381 --> 01:01:49,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

694
01:01:49,562 --> 01:01:49,922
[SPEAKER_15]: Cuno.

695
01:01:50,402 --> 01:01:50,762
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

696
01:01:50,782 --> 01:01:57,105
[SPEAKER_15]: Just for clarification, when you're talking about the pool door, are you talking about the door that actually goes up, the entrance to the pool upstairs?

697
01:01:57,125 --> 01:01:57,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the pool entrance.

698
01:01:58,006 --> 01:01:58,526
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

699
01:01:58,746 --> 01:01:59,406
[SPEAKER_03]: From the outside.

700
01:01:59,506 --> 01:02:00,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, door 31.

701
01:02:01,147 --> 01:02:04,429
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the outside door that you go along the ramp and go in.

702
01:02:04,449 --> 01:02:05,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay, that's the door.

703
01:02:05,989 --> 01:02:07,930
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, that's the door I want, okay.

704
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:08,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

705
01:02:08,411 --> 01:02:12,513
[SPEAKER_15]: And so, and when you were talking about the floor, were you talking about that carpet that was there for a while?

706
01:02:12,533 --> 01:02:13,113
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we took it out.

707
01:02:13,173 --> 01:02:13,953
[SPEAKER_01]: And we took it out?

708
01:02:14,133 --> 01:02:17,035
[SPEAKER_01]: We took it out because it was starting to get a little bit beat up, so.

709
01:02:18,255 --> 01:02:26,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're just talking about removing the tile and then we'll put brand new tile down and put some pitches hung up inside there and some paint.

710
01:02:27,518 --> 01:02:30,139
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be the nice finishing touch at this point.

711
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:55,557
[SPEAKER_15]: when you were doing this report, have you had a list, or maybe I want to call it a wish list, but over the years we've all had the opportunity as a committee and singly to go to all the schools and see what needs to be done, what maintenance needs to be done, what needs to be upgraded, and I was just curious in knowing when you wrote the report, did you have like the wish list from the schools?

712
01:02:57,018 --> 01:03:03,323
[SPEAKER_01]: From the other schools, I haven't really talked enough

713
01:03:03,803 --> 01:03:07,245
[SPEAKER_01]: to the principals to really find out if they have anything on the wish list.

714
01:03:07,265 --> 01:03:17,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I know that we did have a discussion on the bleachers in the various schools and we did have Frank go out and I did submit a report that

715
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:31,176
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in pretty good shape in most of the schools, but over the summer, again, it might be a good time to maybe have a company come out and replace some of the nuts and bolts that are making the bleachers come in and out and work and things like that.

716
01:03:31,556 --> 01:03:40,180
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I mean, over the years, it's basically been two, just to make sure the bathrooms are back up to date, because there were a lot of things that were missing when we had walked through.

717
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:45,342
[SPEAKER_15]: The playgrounds, I know that's something that we've all looked at.

718
01:03:45,808 --> 01:03:46,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we did.

719
01:03:46,348 --> 01:03:57,370
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we've been, that would be probably, you know, a capital, uh, capital wishlist or improvement, even some of the paving that needs to be done in some of the parking lots and things like that.

720
01:03:57,390 --> 01:04:01,191
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably would fall more into the capital area.

721
01:04:01,531 --> 01:04:11,012
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's just the regular maintenance that we've needed in general, like keeping up with the paint, keeping up with the ceilings, keeping up with, you know, all of it.

722
01:04:11,832 --> 01:04:13,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we are, you know, we're working towards it.

723
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:15,093
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, in, in, um,

724
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:20,916
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been very lucky to be able to use the Department of Corrections, and they've helped us out at the Curtis Tufts.

725
01:04:21,356 --> 01:04:23,098
[SPEAKER_01]: They were at the Brooks earlier this year.

726
01:04:23,538 --> 01:04:29,743
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some plans, hopefully this summer, to bring them down to the Roberts, because they had some requests, and then we'll move them.

727
01:04:32,205 --> 01:04:35,368
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can get them, the longer we can get them, obviously, the better.

728
01:04:35,909 --> 01:04:40,793
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can keep moving around in the buildings, doing common areas, doing classrooms, doing anything.

729
01:04:41,575 --> 01:04:43,077
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same thing with the flooring.

730
01:04:43,117 --> 01:04:47,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the flooring needs to be looked at again in the different classrooms.

731
01:04:47,942 --> 01:04:49,583
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be some tiles popping up.

732
01:04:49,984 --> 01:04:59,673
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just part of our everyday kind of routine that we make our way around town and try to keep it honest, I guess you could say.

733
01:04:59,693 --> 01:05:03,597
[SPEAKER_15]: And what about the contractors that we have at the high school for the cleaning?

734
01:05:03,984 --> 01:05:05,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Prospect contractors.

735
01:05:05,265 --> 01:05:06,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they've been doing a good job.

736
01:05:06,446 --> 01:05:07,887
[SPEAKER_15]: They've been better than the ones that we still have.

737
01:05:08,067 --> 01:05:08,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

738
01:05:08,447 --> 01:05:08,627
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

739
01:05:08,967 --> 01:05:10,528
[SPEAKER_01]: They were the ones that we hired this year.

740
01:05:10,568 --> 01:05:11,089
[SPEAKER_01]: They were new.

741
01:05:11,209 --> 01:05:26,039
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a empire before now prospect was awarded the, um, the bid after we did an extensive interview process, the superintendent, um, there was a few of us there and, um, they've been doing a pretty good job there.

742
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they're resourceful.

743
01:05:28,421 --> 01:05:30,442
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they answer the phone.

744
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:35,922
[SPEAKER_01]: They take care of our needs when we need them for extra issues.

745
01:05:35,962 --> 01:05:39,584
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes you have your regular everyday issue.

746
01:05:39,984 --> 01:05:42,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe something was missed or something else.

747
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:44,926
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're really good about responding to everything.

748
01:05:44,946 --> 01:05:46,867
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had a problem with them at all.

749
01:05:46,907 --> 01:05:50,188
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't say that they haven't been good.

750
01:05:51,548 --> 01:05:51,829
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

751
01:05:52,389 --> 01:05:53,169
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto.

752
01:05:53,729 --> 01:05:54,050
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

753
01:05:55,513 --> 01:06:01,255
[SPEAKER_16]: First of all, I want to shout out to you and to Alicia Hunt on the new lighting at the Curtis Tough School.

754
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:02,776
[SPEAKER_01]: Alicia does a fabulous job.

755
01:06:02,936 --> 01:06:11,400
[SPEAKER_16]: That was requested a few years ago and that took a lot of work to get the grant and get the money and all the work that's been done at that school.

756
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:14,641
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't forget to bring the prisoners back and finish the paint job there.

757
01:06:15,143 --> 01:06:16,424
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll get them back in there again.

758
01:06:16,444 --> 01:06:22,506
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we're, um, we're going to try to knock off a couple of more, uh, of the floors down there this summer.

759
01:06:23,186 --> 01:06:28,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we did make a, uh, we did make a change, a personnel change down at that building.

760
01:06:28,748 --> 01:06:33,170
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I think he, he's done a very good job.

761
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:39,212
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that they were talking about relocating some office space and do you have any updates on that?

762
01:06:39,252 --> 01:06:41,253
[SPEAKER_16]: Like where the kitchen is and the cabinets.

763
01:06:41,293 --> 01:06:41,393
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

764
01:06:42,133 --> 01:06:43,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's like,

765
01:06:44,430 --> 01:06:46,171
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna have to get back down there again.

766
01:06:46,412 --> 01:06:46,892
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?

767
01:06:46,912 --> 01:06:53,756
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe we'll talk about it You know, it's it's funny because maybe it could be a program a program like the kitchen area.

768
01:06:53,816 --> 01:06:58,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Like I said, we'll see what we can do, you know, you get me that carpenter.

769
01:06:58,339 --> 01:07:12,208
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, that's that's my point Not only do we need the cabinet that we could also use a vocational if they plan it as a project sure So maybe we could start now Talking to the director of yeah, absolutely

770
01:07:12,644 --> 01:07:24,110
[SPEAKER_16]: And maybe have that be a work project that throughout the city and have our own children learning right there and interacting with the other students that go to that school at the same time.

771
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:27,512
[SPEAKER_01]: I really, whatever we could do, that'd be, that'd be fantastic.

772
01:07:27,572 --> 01:07:32,235
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, um, so building has come a long way in the last year or so.

773
01:07:32,595 --> 01:07:34,956
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, well, you know, we'll keep plugging away.

774
01:07:35,197 --> 01:07:39,859
[SPEAKER_16]: So I, I support a hundred percent your request for an additional carpenter.

775
01:07:40,119 --> 01:07:41,340
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a lot of buildings.

776
01:07:42,602 --> 01:07:45,984
[SPEAKER_16]: and a lot of maintenance, and our buildings are aging every year.

777
01:07:47,805 --> 01:08:00,290
[SPEAKER_16]: And as the superintendent has committed funds to maintaining and upkeeping and grading, I, as committee member, am going to support your requests that you have asked for in this budget request.

778
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:07,333
[SPEAKER_16]: I also wanted to ask you, you listed that at the Andrews Middle School, you're in need of a floor scupper.

779
01:08:07,554 --> 01:08:08,614
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you know how much that is?

780
01:08:11,623 --> 01:08:14,924
[SPEAKER_01]: 6,000 or so in that vicinity, maybe even a little less.

781
01:08:15,544 --> 01:08:19,665
[SPEAKER_01]: We purchased one this past year for the Roberts, so.

782
01:08:20,525 --> 01:08:21,045
[SPEAKER_16]: Good to know.

783
01:08:22,266 --> 01:08:25,826
[SPEAKER_16]: Just because I had no idea, like, a cost value of that.

784
01:08:26,287 --> 01:08:34,688
[SPEAKER_16]: So you need a carpenter and $6,000 in addition to the $200,000 that the superintendent is going to add to the light items.

785
01:08:35,109 --> 01:08:38,049
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, we'll take whatever we know.

786
01:08:38,829 --> 01:08:41,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever it is, you'll get a chance to vote on it.

787
01:08:41,655 --> 01:08:41,875
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

788
01:08:41,915 --> 01:08:42,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

789
01:08:42,716 --> 01:08:42,876
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

790
01:08:42,916 --> 01:08:43,216
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good.

791
01:08:43,597 --> 01:08:44,718
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, John, for all your work.

792
01:08:44,878 --> 01:08:45,538
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

793
01:08:45,819 --> 01:08:47,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor, through you to John.

794
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:53,766
[SPEAKER_06]: John, is there any chance of getting the auto body shop on your list of places to be painted?

795
01:08:54,406 --> 01:09:04,815
[SPEAKER_06]: The ceiling in there is really, really tough and I guess they want to replace the floor, but they don't want to do anything with the floor until the ceiling gets done because they want the place to be a showcase.

796
01:09:05,789 --> 01:09:07,729
[SPEAKER_06]: but it hasn't been painted.

797
01:09:08,050 --> 01:09:08,990
[SPEAKER_06]: The walls have been painted.

798
01:09:09,030 --> 01:09:09,690
[SPEAKER_06]: They look great.

799
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:15,351
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of work has been done there, but the ceiling in the auto body shop is just, uh, it's time.

800
01:09:15,751 --> 01:09:16,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I can look into it.

801
01:09:16,991 --> 01:09:24,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, it would probably be, um, you know, that that's, um, uh, would probably have to be sprayed.

802
01:09:24,473 --> 01:09:25,733
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?

803
01:09:25,833 --> 01:09:32,775
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I can, I can certainly get a price and find out, you know, I know that the DOC,

804
01:09:33,805 --> 01:09:37,166
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't be something that they would do, you know, spraying and stuff.

805
01:09:37,266 --> 01:09:43,248
[SPEAKER_06]: If we could just take a look at it when we get a chance and see if we can put our heads together and come up with a solution.

806
01:09:43,288 --> 01:09:48,429
[SPEAKER_01]: We use a guy to paint around the school sometimes, and he's pretty reasonable.

807
01:09:48,469 --> 01:09:50,450
[SPEAKER_01]: He's done some work in the vocational school.

808
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:55,331
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can call him up and see if we can get a price.

809
01:09:55,911 --> 01:09:56,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

810
01:09:56,131 --> 01:09:57,072
[SPEAKER_01]: At the very least.

811
01:09:57,132 --> 01:09:57,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

812
01:09:58,172 --> 01:09:58,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

813
01:09:58,532 --> 01:09:58,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

814
01:09:58,672 --> 01:09:59,712
[SPEAKER_12]: Vander Kloot.

815
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:03,710
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayor Burke, this is actually a question for you.

816
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:24,936
[SPEAKER_12]: Earlier this year, we started out by putting together items that we thought were part of a capital improvement plan, including the edging along at the middle school complex, all of that edging along the roads that were sidewalk, which were a concern, and I think also the playgrounds.

817
01:10:25,456 --> 01:10:28,037
[SPEAKER_12]: But I haven't, we're really sort of talking about

818
01:10:28,831 --> 01:10:31,993
[SPEAKER_12]: individual projects again and not the capital improvement plan.

819
01:10:32,193 --> 01:10:33,434
[SPEAKER_12]: Where are we on that?

820
01:10:33,994 --> 01:10:37,276
[SPEAKER_03]: We have pretty much nailed down the city side of things.

821
01:10:37,676 --> 01:10:42,058
[SPEAKER_03]: We're waiting to have another committee of the whole to finalize the school side of everything.

822
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:51,623
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as Freedom Way goes, I'm having the engineering department looking at seeing if we can create it as a public way, because then it's applicable for Chapter 90 funding.

823
01:10:52,584 --> 01:10:56,086
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have Cassandra Koudelidis working on that as we speak.

824
01:10:56,226 --> 01:10:58,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if we can get that, then we could get that whole.

825
01:11:00,119 --> 01:11:01,740
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

826
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:09,644
[SPEAKER_12]: And would a project like, I mean, again, we've sort of had ongoing concerns, ultimately, about the play surfaces and the playgrounds.

827
01:11:09,804 --> 01:11:13,385
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know that much work was done, and there were patches and whatever.

828
01:11:13,445 --> 01:11:19,168
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's still out there as a project, which we need to take a look at.

829
01:11:19,188 --> 01:11:20,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I just finish it up, please?

830
01:11:21,229 --> 01:11:21,509
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

831
01:11:21,609 --> 01:11:22,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine tuning it.

832
01:11:22,130 --> 01:11:22,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty soon.

833
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:23,450
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

834
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:23,951
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty soon.

835
01:11:24,211 --> 01:11:24,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

836
01:11:24,991 --> 01:11:25,331
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

837
01:11:26,012 --> 01:11:26,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

838
01:11:27,871 --> 01:11:28,572
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a citizen.

839
01:11:31,696 --> 01:11:33,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address for the record, please.

840
01:11:33,699 --> 01:11:35,521
[SPEAKER_07]: David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

841
01:11:35,942 --> 01:11:36,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, everyone.

842
01:11:37,964 --> 01:11:43,832
[SPEAKER_07]: I was actually at the city council meeting about the capital improvement in the SOI, and we were kind of

843
01:11:44,323 --> 01:11:45,985
[SPEAKER_07]: there were some things being bantered back and forth.

844
01:11:46,025 --> 01:11:55,894
[SPEAKER_07]: My question is, in the capital improvement program, is there an opportunity to usurp some of that money for maintenance for an extended amount of time?

845
01:11:55,914 --> 01:11:57,916
[SPEAKER_03]: No, capital is bondable money.

846
01:11:58,156 --> 01:11:58,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

847
01:11:58,917 --> 01:12:04,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Free cash could be used for some maintenance items or budget, but you can't take a loan order out for a maintenance item.

848
01:12:05,213 --> 01:12:13,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so is there another opportunity to kind of create some sort of a bucket of money, if you will, for this?

849
01:12:13,201 --> 01:12:24,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the superintendent's fine-tuning the plan for the school side, and once we get that, then we'll develop the dollars that are needed, and then we'll try to put together the puzzle of money to pay for it.

850
01:12:24,733 --> 01:12:33,378
[SPEAKER_07]: One suggestion or one idea might be where you had done a tremendous job collecting taxes on property that did not have taxes collected on.

851
01:12:33,398 --> 01:12:37,360
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was over 2.8, 2.9 million dollars this year.

852
01:12:38,021 --> 01:12:47,706
[SPEAKER_07]: That may not happen every single year, but is there a possibility where we could actually take some of that instead of putting it into the general fund and applying that to the maintenance of the schools?

853
01:12:47,746 --> 01:12:48,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Because to be honest with you,

854
01:12:49,633 --> 01:12:50,434
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel bad for John.

855
01:12:50,554 --> 01:12:51,755
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he needs two carpenters.

856
01:12:52,676 --> 01:12:57,560
[SPEAKER_07]: I have an 11,000 square foot building and I could never do what he does with one person.

857
01:12:58,441 --> 01:13:13,354
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a suggestion, but there has to be something to take these schools to a different level because I remember I was here when we built the middle schools and we were kind of fighting, you know, we're taking them out of the neighborhoods and putting them into a general area.

858
01:13:13,936 --> 01:13:15,717
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't about the schools that I was fighting.

859
01:13:15,757 --> 01:13:19,780
[SPEAKER_07]: It was about the maintenance, because we were complaining that the older schools were not habitable.

860
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,722
[SPEAKER_07]: They make great condos now, but they're not habitable for schools.

861
01:13:23,342 --> 01:13:28,085
[SPEAKER_07]: So here we are now 15, 20 years, however many years it was, and I made the same point.

862
01:13:29,226 --> 01:13:31,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Now some of these schools need some dramatic maintenance.

863
01:13:31,948 --> 01:13:39,532
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can get $10 million in capital improvement, but if you don't have a maintenance plan, you're going to be back in the same boat 10 and 15 years from now.

864
01:13:40,053 --> 01:13:41,834
[SPEAKER_07]: So you need to create a plan for this.

865
01:13:42,454 --> 01:13:53,364
[SPEAKER_07]: And that has to be something that has to be discussed and scrutinized and scrutinized, because that money is money that's not going to be wasted, but is certainly going to be spent unwisely 5, 10, 15 years from now.

866
01:13:53,884 --> 01:13:54,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

867
01:13:54,365 --> 01:13:54,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

868
01:13:57,468 --> 01:14:00,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a motion to accept the pre-budget report as reported?

869
01:14:00,690 --> 01:14:04,474
[SPEAKER_03]: So moved by Mr. Benner, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

870
01:14:04,554 --> 01:14:05,254
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

871
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:06,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

872
01:14:06,195 --> 01:14:06,936
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

873
01:14:07,296 --> 01:14:08,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

874
01:14:08,497 --> 01:14:08,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

875
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:13,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Report on state proposed budget for the fiscal year 18, Mr. Superintendent.

876
01:14:13,852 --> 01:14:20,276
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a good opportunity for me to wrap a few things together and also talk about some of the things that just came up.

877
01:14:21,596 --> 01:14:31,001
[SPEAKER_08]: The Massachusetts House of Representatives passed its initial version of the FY 2018 state budget last Tuesday, April 25th.

878
01:14:32,902 --> 01:14:39,166
[SPEAKER_08]: The House version will now go to the State Senate for their deliberations, ways and means, and then the floor.

879
01:14:40,284 --> 01:14:44,187
[SPEAKER_08]: And we would expect the Senate version to emerge sometime in late May.

880
01:14:45,568 --> 01:14:52,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Since there will be differences between the two legislative bodies, there will be a joint conference committee consisting of three members from each chamber.

881
01:14:53,974 --> 01:15:00,879
[SPEAKER_08]: And they'll try to reconcile their differences and then go to the full body in each chamber to get an up or down vote.

882
01:15:00,899 --> 01:15:03,301
[SPEAKER_08]: They can't make changes once it comes out of conference committee.

883
01:15:05,345 --> 01:15:09,651
[SPEAKER_08]: And the changes, once it comes out from the full legislature, will go to the governor.

884
01:15:09,691 --> 01:15:11,874
[SPEAKER_08]: The governor undoubtedly will veto some line items.

885
01:15:12,475 --> 01:15:17,182
[SPEAKER_08]: The legislature historically will override most of his vetoes, give or take a few here and there.

886
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:24,873
[SPEAKER_08]: and the state budget should be completed sometime by the end of June.

887
01:15:24,933 --> 01:15:35,800
[SPEAKER_08]: However, we have to start doing our budgets well in advance of that, so we start to look at what the House and the Senate will do, because typically there are pretty good guidelines as to what will happen.

888
01:15:38,241 --> 01:15:39,842
[SPEAKER_08]: But we don't know.

889
01:15:40,222 --> 01:15:46,206
[SPEAKER_08]: The Senate tends to be a little bit more financially generous than the House, although items vary from area to area.

890
01:15:47,256 --> 01:15:53,401
[SPEAKER_08]: For the first time, the initial budget from the House exceeds $40 billion.

891
01:15:54,361 --> 01:16:05,149
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually less than what the Governor proposed, slightly, but it still exceeds $40 billion to support the various line items and any new programs and services.

892
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:14,656
[SPEAKER_08]: But most of the new money goes to mass health, pensions, and a modest increase in local aid.

893
01:16:15,297 --> 01:16:15,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Limited.

894
01:16:16,117 --> 01:16:16,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Very limited.

895
01:16:17,215 --> 01:16:17,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

896
01:16:17,655 --> 01:16:24,978
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go into some of that in a way, but 40% of the budget typically or more right now is mass health.

897
01:16:26,279 --> 01:16:34,902
[SPEAKER_08]: So it gives you an idea of, you know, it may be $40 billion, but so much of it is eaten up by certain entitlements that, uh, there isn't a lot of discretionary funding.

898
01:16:35,803 --> 01:16:43,506
[SPEAKER_08]: So the main limitation on the budget is the availability of money, uh, to support the various line items.

899
01:16:44,165 --> 01:16:47,026
[SPEAKER_08]: any new programs and services, just like we're talking about right now.

900
01:16:47,066 --> 01:16:51,588
[SPEAKER_08]: How much money is going to be available to do all the things that you think should be done?

901
01:16:52,468 --> 01:16:55,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of the new money, as I say, goes for certain items.

902
01:16:56,910 --> 01:17:04,273
[SPEAKER_08]: During FY 2016, the state found the budget was initially short $455 million.

903
01:17:04,553 --> 01:17:11,296
[SPEAKER_08]: And this year, revenue at the end of March is running $220 million below estimates.

904
01:17:12,625 --> 01:17:14,066
[SPEAKER_08]: April receipt should be higher.

905
01:17:14,386 --> 01:17:15,687
[SPEAKER_08]: April is usually a very good month.

906
01:17:15,707 --> 01:17:20,989
[SPEAKER_08]: The beginning of the month was good, but until we get the final figures, we don't know.

907
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:24,551
[SPEAKER_08]: But typically, we should be able to close a good portion of that gap.

908
01:17:25,311 --> 01:17:28,353
[SPEAKER_08]: But closing that gap doesn't give us any surplus, doesn't give any excess.

909
01:17:28,413 --> 01:17:30,394
[SPEAKER_08]: It just gives us a gap close.

910
01:17:31,454 --> 01:17:36,797
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's no guarantee that, you know, how much money will come in actually in June, in May and June.

911
01:17:38,118 --> 01:17:38,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Originally,

912
01:17:39,326 --> 01:17:44,330
[SPEAKER_08]: The projection for this year was a 3.1% growth factor at the state level.

913
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:45,731
[SPEAKER_08]: And through March, it's 1.7%.

914
01:17:45,971 --> 01:17:47,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Gives you an idea.

915
01:17:49,094 --> 01:17:50,134
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's nationally, too.

916
01:17:50,154 --> 01:17:53,577
[SPEAKER_08]: A 2% growth is sort of like, you know, a hallmark.

917
01:17:54,718 --> 01:18:03,325
[SPEAKER_08]: A study by the Federal Reserve explained that while Massachusetts unemployment was down, there was a significant drop in wages and hours worked.

918
01:18:04,406 --> 01:18:07,488
[SPEAKER_08]: And that means that the overall personal income was lower.

919
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:12,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Spending was higher, most notably in the health sector.

920
01:18:13,194 --> 01:18:19,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, a sales tax on merchandise was affected by increased online buying, for which there is no tax.

921
01:18:20,416 --> 01:18:26,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Furthermore, it's impossible that the income tax rate will drop again because of the automatic trigger built into the state.

922
01:18:27,917 --> 01:18:34,779
[SPEAKER_08]: The drop in the income tax cost the Commonwealth more of a billion dollars a year since that trigger was put in place.

923
01:18:37,795 --> 01:18:53,085
[SPEAKER_08]: There appears to be no appetite for increased taxation, although there may be some proposal out of the Senate, as Senate President Rosenberg seems to put this forward a little bit, although tax proposals have to emanate from the House first.

924
01:18:54,206 --> 01:19:00,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Lastly, we can expect some cutbacks from Washington on domestic spending, including various education items.

925
01:19:02,095 --> 01:19:05,376
[SPEAKER_08]: So the following items are things to think about in the House budget.

926
01:19:05,917 --> 01:19:13,100
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, they haven't printed the whole House budget, so I can't get every nickel and dime figured out 100%, but I've gone behind the numbers as much as I can.

927
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:17,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Chapter 70 is $30 per pupil in the House budget.

928
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:20,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Last year it was $55 per pupil.

929
01:19:21,984 --> 01:19:23,385
[SPEAKER_08]: The governor is proposing $20 per pupil.

930
01:19:25,534 --> 01:19:27,795
[SPEAKER_08]: That's approximately $145,000.

931
01:19:28,695 --> 01:19:34,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Unrestricted municipal aid is up statewide by 40 million, but when it's distributed, it isn't that much.

932
01:19:35,697 --> 01:19:39,118
[SPEAKER_08]: The special education circuit breaker was level funded in the House budget.

933
01:19:40,118 --> 01:19:44,339
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be short somewhere between 10 and 15 million dollars for full funding.

934
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:49,921
[SPEAKER_08]: And as more students qualify, there's a greater demand on this account.

935
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:56,656
[SPEAKER_08]: We're projecting less funding in fiscal 2017 than we were in there in 2016.

936
01:19:56,696 --> 01:19:59,298
[SPEAKER_08]: We've already given you some of those numbers in the last financial report.

937
01:20:00,379 --> 01:20:05,543
[SPEAKER_08]: And there could be a further reduction in fiscal 2018, and that's for extraordinary special ed costs.

938
01:20:05,583 --> 01:20:07,104
[SPEAKER_08]: So you have to pay attention to that.

939
01:20:07,904 --> 01:20:09,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Charter school funding is level funded.

940
01:20:10,546 --> 01:20:16,230
[SPEAKER_08]: We expect the statewide entitlement to be $60 million below need, maybe more, depending on how much expansion.

941
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:20,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Depending on the number of students who opt for charter schools, we could see an increase

942
01:20:21,282 --> 01:20:26,647
[SPEAKER_08]: in our local cost, although I think we've leveled pretty well and we're bringing people back.

943
01:20:28,649 --> 01:20:39,098
[SPEAKER_08]: But we also know that Washington is very heavy on pro-choice with Secretary DeVos, and we'll see what comes out of there for choice issues in support of charter schools.

944
01:20:39,999 --> 01:20:46,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Homeless transportation is level funded, 50% of what we think entitlement would be, if that.

945
01:20:47,809 --> 01:20:49,991
[SPEAKER_08]: No funding, new funding came back for kindergarten.

946
01:20:50,031 --> 01:20:55,276
[SPEAKER_08]: We lost $143,000 last year and there's nothing in that line item this year.

947
01:20:56,477 --> 01:20:59,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Out of district, non-resident transportation is cut.

948
01:21:00,581 --> 01:21:03,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Could lose about $30,000 in that particular line item.

949
01:21:04,484 --> 01:21:08,428
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's no new funding for technology that we've seen outside of what I presented this evening.

950
01:21:09,649 --> 01:21:12,612
[SPEAKER_08]: We will be able to get some significant federal dollars as I explained.

951
01:21:13,717 --> 01:21:16,780
[SPEAKER_08]: The Department of Public Health funding should be reasonably stable.

952
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:21,104
[SPEAKER_08]: That funds a nurse and some of the work that's done on health prevention.

953
01:21:21,824 --> 01:21:32,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Early childhood funding through the grant account is expected to lose 30% of current level as priorities shift from programs to workforce development support.

954
01:21:32,534 --> 01:21:35,757
[SPEAKER_08]: In other words, increasing the salaries of people in the

955
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:41,242
[SPEAKER_08]: non-profit sector and providing additional training for them because they're well underfunded.

956
01:21:41,622 --> 01:21:43,283
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's certainly a worthy priority.

957
01:21:43,764 --> 01:21:45,405
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, they didn't say we'll do both.

958
01:21:45,445 --> 01:21:48,708
[SPEAKER_08]: They said we'll take the money from the programs and move it over there.

959
01:21:49,248 --> 01:21:52,370
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a little bit more there, but it's not clear.

960
01:21:52,951 --> 01:21:58,015
[SPEAKER_08]: So we just got through talking a little bit about maintenance and things of that type.

961
01:21:58,876 --> 01:22:00,797
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a finite pot of gold out there.

962
01:22:01,638 --> 01:22:04,300
[SPEAKER_08]: And you just can't say we'll just do everything.

963
01:22:05,124 --> 01:22:18,391
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll try to provide you with options across the board so you can select, and hopefully we'll continue to search out new sources of funding like we have with the vocational school and other things and opiate prevention to augment what we have.

964
01:22:18,931 --> 01:22:25,074
[SPEAKER_08]: But the general distributions coming from the state place a tremendous burden on the locality.

965
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:30,337
[SPEAKER_08]: The cost of health care keeps going up, and we just don't know, you know, where it's coming.

966
01:22:30,357 --> 01:22:34,839
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know what Washington's going to do and what's going to happen to that situation yet.

967
01:22:35,317 --> 01:22:36,318
[SPEAKER_08]: It goes back and forth.

968
01:22:36,978 --> 01:22:39,620
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are a lot of other factors that have to come into play.

969
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:50,946
[SPEAKER_08]: So we also have to carry at least a 2.5% increase in salary negotiations, which isn't outrageous, but it's money.

970
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:58,791
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you also have step increases that people who are starting the young teachers move up the steps.

971
01:22:58,811 --> 01:22:59,532
[SPEAKER_08]: That's on top of the 2.5.

972
01:22:59,572 --> 01:23:01,813
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a lot of factors.

973
01:23:02,488 --> 01:23:08,332
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be easy for me to get up and say, sure, tell me whatever you want me to fix, tell me whatever you want me to do, go add this, add that.

974
01:23:08,892 --> 01:23:10,233
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not that simple and you know it.

975
01:23:10,854 --> 01:23:16,938
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, what it is is that we have to lay it all out and decide what's most important to us and move forward with that.

976
01:23:17,318 --> 01:23:21,461
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a lot of great things going on in this community and a lot of great things going on in the school system.

977
01:23:21,481 --> 01:23:26,584
[SPEAKER_08]: I should be very proud of the work you've done, very proud of the administration and City Hall supporting us.

978
01:23:28,990 --> 01:23:32,673
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there will be some limitations, and we'll have to make some tough choices, forced choices.

979
01:23:32,693 --> 01:23:35,655
[SPEAKER_08]: So the budget process is beginning at the Statehouse.

980
01:23:36,556 --> 01:23:37,696
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll keep watching the Senate.

981
01:23:37,877 --> 01:23:40,098
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go up and lobby, you know, for other things.

982
01:23:40,579 --> 01:23:41,940
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll talk to people about things.

983
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:44,461
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll look for additional grants, look for additional revenue.

984
01:23:44,962 --> 01:23:50,486
[SPEAKER_08]: We've recaptured some revenue through the Minuteman activity, the revenue coming in through the vocational school.

985
01:23:51,547 --> 01:23:52,788
[SPEAKER_08]: But still, it's got to be spread out.

986
01:23:54,272 --> 01:23:56,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Just wanted to give you a quick snapshot of the state budget so far.

987
01:23:57,213 --> 01:24:01,395
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll keep you posted, and we'll keep talking budget as we go forward and try to set priorities.

988
01:24:02,395 --> 01:24:02,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

989
01:24:02,595 --> 01:24:03,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Mustone.

990
01:24:03,936 --> 01:24:08,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Belson, can you just explain the out-of-district non-resident transportation could lose about $30,000.

991
01:24:09,058 --> 01:24:11,019
[SPEAKER_11]: So who does that transport?

992
01:24:11,099 --> 01:24:12,459
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, that's the Minuteman bus.

993
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:13,160
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

994
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:18,522
[SPEAKER_08]: So in another year from now, we won't have a bus going to Minuteman.

995
01:24:19,075 --> 01:24:22,278
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to try and get a smaller vehicle, which may cost less.

996
01:24:22,959 --> 01:24:28,145
[SPEAKER_08]: But if I lose the reimbursement for non-resident last year, two years ago, it was almost $3 million.

997
01:24:28,545 --> 01:24:29,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it went down to half of that.

998
01:24:30,167 --> 01:24:32,089
[SPEAKER_08]: And this year in the house budget, it's $250,000 for that line item.

999
01:24:33,593 --> 01:24:36,234
[SPEAKER_11]: So how many students are at Minuteman right now?

1000
01:24:36,274 --> 01:24:37,954
[SPEAKER_08]: This year, there's about 16 students.

1001
01:24:38,374 --> 01:24:39,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Next year, I would expect eight.

1002
01:24:39,815 --> 01:24:40,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, they could fit in my van.

1003
01:24:41,095 --> 01:24:41,895
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll take them in my van.

1004
01:24:41,935 --> 01:24:42,976
[SPEAKER_11]: You could do it.

1005
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:43,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1006
01:24:44,036 --> 01:24:48,417
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, hey, listen, if you can't go one way, we'll must own the other way.

1007
01:24:48,477 --> 01:24:48,777
OK?

1008
01:24:48,817 --> 01:24:49,158
[SPEAKER_08]: How's that?

1009
01:24:49,678 --> 01:24:49,838
[SPEAKER_08]: OK?

1010
01:24:50,878 --> 01:24:51,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

1011
01:24:51,338 --> 01:24:51,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1012
01:24:51,798 --> 01:24:52,819
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

1013
01:24:52,859 --> 01:24:52,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

1014
01:24:52,999 --> 01:24:53,519
[SPEAKER_12]: Van de Kloot.

1015
01:24:53,879 --> 01:24:54,419
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1016
01:24:54,539 --> 01:24:56,680
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent, for your report.

1017
01:24:57,020 --> 01:25:02,422
[SPEAKER_12]: You touched on possible federal impacts, and of course that picture is not clear to us at this time.

1018
01:25:02,802 --> 01:25:18,767
[SPEAKER_12]: However, today the National School Boards Association did send out an alert because of the concern about the legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and the impact on Medicaid funding

1019
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:20,821
[SPEAKER_12]: for public school students.

1020
01:25:21,882 --> 01:25:35,750
[SPEAKER_12]: If passed at this point, it would limit Medicaid funding and it says the impact, the ability of students with disabilities and students in poverty to receive critical necessary health services in public schools.

1021
01:25:36,290 --> 01:25:45,956
[SPEAKER_12]: The legislation will require schools to compete for limited Medicaid funding and result in the institution of arbitrary caps and how much Medicaid reimbursements are made to public schools.

1022
01:25:46,362 --> 01:25:55,591
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, this would be another area where I know that money comes back to the city, but it's another place where we would find a loss.

1023
01:25:55,771 --> 01:25:56,972
[SPEAKER_03]: It impacts the pie.

1024
01:25:56,992 --> 01:25:59,495
[SPEAKER_03]: It impacts the pie.

1025
01:25:59,575 --> 01:26:00,856
[SPEAKER_12]: They urge us to call our

1026
01:26:02,396 --> 01:26:04,298
[SPEAKER_12]: House of Representative people.

1027
01:26:04,318 --> 01:26:09,261
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, we understand where they already sit in our state.

1028
01:26:10,142 --> 01:26:11,843
[SPEAKER_12]: However, I did want to bring it to your attention.

1029
01:26:11,943 --> 01:26:13,465
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's definitely an issue.

1030
01:26:13,765 --> 01:26:19,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Just so you know, the Medicaid funding is generated by students who are eligible through disabilities and the like.

1031
01:26:19,929 --> 01:26:20,870
[SPEAKER_08]: The money comes back.

1032
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:22,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Short Collaborative is our

1033
01:26:23,815 --> 01:26:33,618
[SPEAKER_08]: broker, if you will, it comes back through it, but it goes into the city treasury, and as the mayor points out, it adds to the total pie that's then available for redistribution to the schools, to the city, and other things.

1034
01:26:33,658 --> 01:26:37,079
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's factored into the overall who gets what kind of thing.

1035
01:26:37,099 --> 01:26:43,161
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some people that say they want it to come to them, but quite frankly, it's the same pot of gold, and we just simply work with it.

1036
01:26:43,561 --> 01:26:48,883
[SPEAKER_08]: But it could be $400,000, $500,000 that we could lose, and the state could lose that much more.

1037
01:26:49,703 --> 01:26:59,088
[SPEAKER_08]: because they're dependent on it as well, and that could drive the cost of health care right through the roof, which will also impact our employees, because they have to pay more for health insurance and the like.

1038
01:26:59,528 --> 01:27:08,493
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, that would bring them to the bargaining table, because next year, while we're covered for next year, bargaining for the successor contracts will start all over again.

1039
01:27:08,893 --> 01:27:15,917
[SPEAKER_08]: And as they lose money in terms of, you know, the health care costs and things of that type, they're going to be looking for something to make it up in salary.

1040
01:27:17,034 --> 01:27:22,298
[SPEAKER_08]: All this stuff has triggers that, you know, have got to be thought about, planned.

1041
01:27:22,759 --> 01:27:24,520
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to understand what it means.

1042
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:31,206
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, when we commit something going forward, we've got to realize it might have ripple effect multiple years down the road.

1043
01:27:31,286 --> 01:27:32,767
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just, you know, any one year.

1044
01:27:32,827 --> 01:27:36,570
[SPEAKER_08]: It's that year, maybe, but then there's more going on down the road.

1045
01:27:37,551 --> 01:27:44,317
[SPEAKER_08]: And as it stands now, we're, you know, we're using a lot of generated revenue to support our operations.

1046
01:27:45,149 --> 01:27:48,350
[SPEAKER_08]: At some point in time, that generated revenue will hit a wall.

1047
01:27:48,791 --> 01:27:50,551
[SPEAKER_08]: We can only make so much at any given time.

1048
01:27:51,071 --> 01:27:56,374
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's all kinds of issues, but Washington, you know, is a real black hole.

1049
01:27:56,414 --> 01:27:58,154
[SPEAKER_08]: You really don't know a lot of the programs.

1050
01:27:58,194 --> 01:28:02,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Title II is 150,000 go into salaries.

1051
01:28:02,896 --> 01:28:06,098
[SPEAKER_08]: That could disappear, you know, for class size reduction.

1052
01:28:07,438 --> 01:28:13,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Other programs like that for supplies, materials, bilingual, EO money could come down.

1053
01:28:14,352 --> 01:28:17,554
[SPEAKER_08]: And as you can see, our population is significantly growing in that area.

1054
01:28:19,636 --> 01:28:34,346
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the issue of, and I know it's unpopular, the millionaires' tax is out there someplace, whether that actually goes through in a year from now, certainly would be helpful to the revenue pie, but then again, if that money gets generated, who will get it?

1055
01:28:35,401 --> 01:28:41,945
[SPEAKER_08]: the issue of any money generated through the marijuana bill, sales taxes, other things like that, all up in the air.

1056
01:28:42,185 --> 01:28:46,087
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a whole group out there that want to cut the sales tax, you know, want to bring it back down again.

1057
01:28:46,707 --> 01:28:52,911
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a lot of discussions that are going on right now, and, you know, we've got to balance it all.

1058
01:28:52,971 --> 01:29:01,836
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I love it when people come up and say we need this and need that, and I really respect that, because they're advocating for what they want, and that you should.

1059
01:29:02,993 --> 01:29:14,675
[SPEAKER_08]: But then our job becomes how to balance it out, how to do as much as we can and fairly apportion it to the things that are important to us.

1060
01:29:14,735 --> 01:29:15,296
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto.

1061
01:29:15,316 --> 01:29:24,097
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to touch base on what my colleague was talking about, because I do math health billing for the school I work at.

1062
01:29:24,637 --> 01:29:32,199
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's actually for speech therapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, that's

1063
01:29:32,595 --> 01:29:36,257
[SPEAKER_16]: That's refunding for those services that we provide students.

1064
01:29:36,317 --> 01:29:41,420
[SPEAKER_16]: And instead of them going back to their doctor's office or outpatient visits, we do them in the schools.

1065
01:29:41,461 --> 01:29:48,825
[SPEAKER_16]: And we have those people in the schools so that they can not only help the children that specifically need it, but they're in the schools so they help all children.

1066
01:29:49,385 --> 01:29:58,351
[SPEAKER_16]: And when we don't receive those fundings, we're less likely to have funds to employ those type of people in our school systems.

1067
01:29:58,798 --> 01:29:59,798
[SPEAKER_16]: And it does matter.

1068
01:29:59,858 --> 01:30:20,085
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't think people realize it when you're just talking about funding being cut unless you tell them how it affects our children every day and the development and growth that people make early in their lives with OT, with speech, and the abundance of how quickly they learn and no longer need those services because they get them well.

1069
01:30:21,226 --> 01:30:27,508
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you treat well and treat early is how I look at things, and then you don't have to treat later.

1070
01:30:28,134 --> 01:30:29,795
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, because you have the skills.

1071
01:30:29,855 --> 01:30:34,099
[SPEAKER_16]: You've mastered some of those skills, so you no longer need those services.

1072
01:30:34,599 --> 01:30:37,161
[SPEAKER_16]: But I just wanted it to be relatable.

1073
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:38,842
[SPEAKER_16]: It matters to our children.

1074
01:30:38,963 --> 01:30:44,487
[SPEAKER_16]: It matters not only in dollars to our city, but it matters to services among our children.

1075
01:30:44,727 --> 01:30:45,808
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's what we're here for.

1076
01:30:47,689 --> 01:30:48,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

1077
01:30:48,410 --> 01:30:51,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file?

1078
01:30:51,933 --> 01:30:52,413
[SPEAKER_03]: So moved.

1079
01:30:52,433 --> 01:30:53,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded by Ms.

1080
01:30:53,154 --> 01:30:53,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Kretz.

1081
01:30:53,974 --> 01:30:54,655
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

1082
01:30:54,675 --> 01:30:54,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1083
01:30:55,395 --> 01:30:56,096
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

1084
01:30:56,316 --> 01:30:56,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

1085
01:31:00,244 --> 01:31:01,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Negotiations and legal matters, none.

1086
01:31:01,905 --> 01:31:02,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1087
01:31:04,685 --> 01:31:06,806
[SPEAKER_03]: On the back, we have school committee resolution.

1088
01:31:07,046 --> 01:31:11,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Irene Hagee.

1089
01:31:12,188 --> 01:31:18,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Mrs. Hagee was the mother of Carolyn Hagee, former administrative assistant to the superintendent and secretary to the school committee.

1090
01:31:19,050 --> 01:31:20,910
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have another item in the addendum.

1091
01:31:21,251 --> 01:31:25,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Ahmed Azizi.

1092
01:31:26,252 --> 01:31:29,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Azizi was a former Medford Public Schools custodian.

1093
01:31:29,505 --> 01:31:31,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Could all please rise for a moment of silence.

1094
01:31:42,339 --> 01:31:44,261
Thank you.

1095
01:31:47,124 --> 01:31:48,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

1096
01:31:49,306 --> 01:31:49,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

1097
01:31:49,487 --> 01:31:49,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Vandekloot.
