73
00:45:01,382 --> 00:45:02,723

77

80
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:30,700
Okay.

81
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,580

100
00:46:54,404 --> 00:46:55,025

Member Parks.

103
00:46:57,827 --> 00:46:58,067
Yes.

104
00:46:58,507 --> 00:46:59,148

00:47:03,593 --> 00:47:04,013

That's okay.

108
00:47:06,314 --> 00:47:07,174
Member Russo, yes?

109
00:47:07,674 --> 00:47:08,474
Mayor Longo, okay.

110
00:47:09,835 --> 00:47:10,135
Yes.

111
00:47:10,615 --> 00:47:12,095
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

112
00:47:12,475 --> 00:47:14,116
The consent agenda is approved.

113
00:47:15,176 --> 00:47:19,977
We do not have any reports of subcommittee, and we have three reports of our superintendent.

114
00:47:20,377 --> 00:47:26,039
So I'm gonna turn it over to you, Dr. Glucy, for a Mustang moment, although I know it was weather permitting.

115
00:47:28,017 --> 00:47:48,511
Yes, unfortunately, we had our high school best buddies club attending for this meeting, but due to the snow and the cancellation of school, they will be joining us at the next, or maybe we're rescheduling them so that they can join us for an in-person school committee meeting.

116
00:47:48,612 --> 00:47:55,476
So this evening, we do not have a Mustang moment, but we will make sure we have that next week.

117
00:47:56,477 --> 00:47:56,837
Sounds great.

118
00:47:56,857 --> 00:47:57,718
We look forward to it.

119
00:47:58,482 --> 00:47:59,543
So I'll move on to number two.

120
00:47:59,663 --> 00:48:03,227
It's a summary of the Youth Behavior Risk Survey, Spring 2025.

121
00:48:04,128 --> 00:48:09,153
I just saw Catherine Dhingra from the City of Medford's Office of Prevention and Outreach.

122
00:48:09,994 --> 00:48:10,735
She's our manager.

123
00:48:10,955 --> 00:48:11,436
Join us.

124
00:48:11,756 --> 00:48:16,722
And Dr. Stacey Schulman, Director of Behavioral Health and Counseling for Medford Public Schools.

125
00:48:34,985 --> 00:48:35,925
Thank you, Catherine.

126
00:48:36,005 --> 00:48:41,387
Thank you, Dr. Shulman, for being here this evening and presenting about the Youth Risk Survey.

127
00:48:41,407 --> 00:48:47,129
I'm just double-checking that they are both able to unmute.

128
00:48:48,589 --> 00:48:48,809
Yes.

129
00:48:49,209 --> 00:48:49,710
Perfect.

130
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:51,510
Okay, I will turn it over to the both of you.

131
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:52,250
Thank you so much.

132
00:48:52,891 --> 00:48:53,451
Thank you.

133
00:48:53,511 --> 00:48:53,931
Good evening.

134
00:48:53,971 --> 00:48:55,231
Hi, I'm Stacey Shulman.

135
00:48:55,251 --> 00:49:00,133
I'm the Director of School Counseling and Behavioral Health for Medford Public Schools, and with me is Catherine Dhingra.

136
00:49:01,288 --> 00:49:03,852
She is the Office of Prevention and Outreach Manager.

137
00:49:03,892 --> 00:49:09,338
We're here to present data from our 2025 Youth Risk Behavior Survey.

138
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:20,191
One big thing to note is that in 2025, Medford Public Schools transitioned to the Youth Risk Behavior Survey from the previous survey we had done, which is similar.

139
00:49:20,668 --> 00:49:25,930
which was the Community That Cares Youth Survey, which we had administered biannually since 2017.

140
00:49:26,991 --> 00:49:35,315
And the reason for doing so was to be able to have data which we could compare to like communities, state and national trends.

141
00:49:40,817 --> 00:49:42,878
All right, so can everyone hear me?

142
00:49:44,771 --> 00:49:58,359
Okay, again, my name is Catherine Dingra, and I work out of the City of Medford's Health Department, and we are delighted to work so closely with the schools on understanding our students' health and wellness needs.

143
00:49:58,679 --> 00:50:02,401
And the YRBS is a nationally recognized evidence-based tool.

144
00:50:02,921 --> 00:50:07,664
It has anonymity, so it increases the honesty among students.

145
00:50:07,744 --> 00:50:09,665
Questions are rigorously tested,

146
00:50:10,165 --> 00:50:15,248
data is really used for identifying patterns and trends.

147
00:50:15,969 --> 00:50:20,791
And the findings that we found here really do align with what schools and providers are seeing.

148
00:50:22,072 --> 00:50:27,395
In addition to that, our public health staff facilitated four focus groups.

149
00:50:27,516 --> 00:50:35,080
So what we wanted to do was have some qualitative data that paired with some of the quantitative data we were seeing from the surveys.

150
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,521
So next slide.

151
00:50:41,721 --> 00:50:54,592
So you can see our demographics from the middle school sample were really reflective of our student population and the demographics of the middle school so we really felt confident in the data that we were seeing from the middle school sample.

152
00:50:55,927 --> 00:51:11,346
And then our high school was a little different because to align with our YRBS communications and some challenges we were seeing from other districts, we pushed back the implementation date of the YRBS.

153
00:51:11,886 --> 00:51:16,747
which led to having less juniors and seniors participate in the survey.

154
00:51:16,767 --> 00:51:27,910
And where that we saw the biggest impacts of that were around substance use, particularly as we see substance use increases on as students progress through high school.

155
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:30,931
And then the focus group.

156
00:51:33,314 --> 00:51:33,895
demographics.

157
00:51:33,915 --> 00:51:41,663
We had 20, 22 students participate in focus groups, but we really tried to work with school staff to identify different groups of students.

158
00:51:43,105 --> 00:51:50,033
And generally what we heard from the students in the focus group was that school culture and pride, especially

159
00:51:51,033 --> 00:51:54,674
tied to the new administration and supportive staff have improved.

160
00:51:55,695 --> 00:52:11,220
Many students described feeling more connected through sports, clubs, teachers, and some did mention some distressed, but they were more frustrated with things like facilities and shortened lunch.

161
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:23,865
They also noted that assemblies, advisory activities, and clubs were seen as helpful for building belonging, but students wanted more active and engaging approaches.

162
00:52:24,566 --> 00:52:28,467
So those are just some of the highlight things that we learned from the focus groups.

163
00:52:29,568 --> 00:52:30,068
Next slide.

164
00:52:34,223 --> 00:52:37,746
So this, we're going to go into our student YRBS data.

165
00:52:39,148 --> 00:52:46,355
So in some of the following slides, you're going to see differences in outcomes across race and ethnicity or sexual orientation.

166
00:52:46,415 --> 00:52:51,760
It's just important to emphasize that these are not about deficits within the students.

167
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:55,985
They really reflect how environment systems and access to support

168
00:52:56,545 --> 00:52:58,586
shape our young people's experiences.

169
00:52:58,846 --> 00:53:08,288
Our focus is on using these data points to strengthen our protective factors, which you'll hear more about, and really creating more supportive environments.

170
00:53:08,308 --> 00:53:14,169
So really using this data to drive how we can change the environment that our young people are in.

171
00:53:14,189 --> 00:53:16,290
I'll turn it over to Stacey.

172
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:20,390
Thank you, Catherine.

173
00:53:21,171 --> 00:53:24,072
I'll talk a little bit about our student mental health data here.

174
00:53:24,513 --> 00:53:34,278
So overall, 19% of our middle schoolers and 20% of our high schoolers reported that their mental health was not good most of the time or always in the past 30 days.

175
00:53:34,918 --> 00:53:42,062
This was notably lower than the state level data, which was coming in at 31% of high schoolers reporting poor mental health in 2023.

176
00:53:47,013 --> 00:53:53,117
Our LGBTQ students reported significantly worse mental health outcomes than their heterosexual peers.

177
00:53:54,118 --> 00:53:59,281
This is, again, speaking to what Catherine was just noting, is highlighting some unequal experiences.

178
00:54:00,322 --> 00:54:11,890
For those students, this connects to what our literature shares with us in terms of making sure that we are making those students a priority for mental health care in our schools.

179
00:54:14,944 --> 00:54:18,525
Overall students reported 12-month depression symptoms.

180
00:54:19,106 --> 00:54:28,209
So feeling sad and hopeless almost daily for two plus weeks are the lowest since 2017, both for middle school and for high school students.

181
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:36,753
You can see here that we use data from the Community That Cares Youth Survey, which we had previously asked a similar question to get that data from.

182
00:54:36,813 --> 00:54:44,536
So we're coming in at 25% for both high school and middle school students, which is a notable decline from previous years.

183
00:54:47,875 --> 00:54:53,664
Depression by race and ethnicity does have some discrepancies and differences in that data.

184
00:54:54,064 --> 00:54:57,950
So we wanted to highlight that the experience is not the same for everyone overall.

185
00:55:01,732 --> 00:55:07,597
And these are the strategies that we have within Medford Public Schools for our mental health.

186
00:55:07,657 --> 00:55:16,745
We have individual group counseling, of course, our Mustang All-Stars Mustang Way, which is sort of that tier one social-emotional learning levels with our circles and advisory.

187
00:55:17,386 --> 00:55:25,613
The PD we have for our faculty, highlighting a sense of belonging, which Catherine just spoke to was a real big highlight of our focus groups.

188
00:55:26,297 --> 00:55:34,955
We have our signs of suicide program in the secondary level, which is an evidence-based curriculum focusing on educating students on the signs of suicide and how to access health.

189
00:55:35,637 --> 00:55:39,620
Of course, our Michigan model health curriculum for K through 12.

190
00:55:40,321 --> 00:55:46,426
Our Nexus, which is our class for all elementary students focused on social emotional learning and executive functioning skills.

191
00:55:47,507 --> 00:55:54,994
And new in is we have a partnership with Cambridge Health Alliance to support our school adjustment counselors with clinical supervision.

192
00:55:55,434 --> 00:56:03,201
So we have a PhD psychologist who is able to talk to our school adjustment counselors to help them with new strategies they may need.

193
00:56:05,851 --> 00:56:13,455
This is another big announcement, which I'll be sending out to all caregivers this week, once we have the official QR code to send out.

194
00:56:13,895 --> 00:56:27,843
But through our partnership with Sandy Hook Promise and their partnership with BetterHelp, we'll be offering three months of free mental health therapy to all MHS students who are 14 and up, as well as all the adults within MPS.

195
00:56:32,437 --> 00:56:43,361
Okay, so if you go to the next slide, we can see that our top alcohol remains the most used substance by Medford youth.

196
00:56:44,021 --> 00:56:53,124
Overall, across the country, statewide, and even here in Medford, we see that youth substance use rates are declining.

197
00:56:53,264 --> 00:56:54,705
So that's a really good thing.

198
00:56:55,265 --> 00:57:04,773
But one problem that we heard in our focus groups and our health teachers are hearing is that students perceive that everyone is doing it and that's something that we're working on.

199
00:57:04,793 --> 00:57:12,119
A key takeaway from our focus groups was that substance use, especially vaping and marijuana

200
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:20,186
Marijuana is widely normalized among students and often framed as stress management tool, rather than a health risk.

201
00:57:20,647 --> 00:57:25,951
And we repeatedly heard about our bathrooms being a place of high substance use.

202
00:57:27,272 --> 00:57:28,713
If you look at the next slide.

203
00:57:31,331 --> 00:57:42,578
This slide reflects the data point that I mentioned earlier that really we can take a look at that trend data for our middle school students and get a good reflective use.

204
00:57:42,638 --> 00:57:54,265
We are concerned about students vaping at the middle school and we'll talk about some of the implementation strategies where we've pushed down to our middle school because of that.

205
00:57:55,025 --> 00:57:58,227
And then our high school data, we really don't have a good

206
00:57:59,668 --> 00:58:09,192
good reliable data source from this because of the lower you survey rates from our juniors and seniors this year.

207
00:58:10,313 --> 00:58:15,255
So we just have to be cautious with this data interpretation in our high school level for the substance use.

208
00:58:16,689 --> 00:58:17,850
Okay.

209
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:22,033
Perceived risk of harm impacts students' use.

210
00:58:22,133 --> 00:58:29,598
As you can see, smoking cigarettes and using prescription drugs is seen as very harmful to our students, and we've seen that reflected in our use rates.

211
00:58:30,218 --> 00:58:34,321
As that's gone up, our use rates have gone down significantly.

212
00:58:35,441 --> 00:58:38,363
And then we've seen the perception of harm around marijuana.

213
00:58:39,744 --> 00:58:42,287
declined significantly in the past 10 years.

214
00:58:42,388 --> 00:58:50,538
And we hear it from youth that they're seeing the normalizing of it from everything from the hallways to billboards on 93.

215
00:58:50,938 --> 00:58:57,106
So that's just something that our health teachers and everyone is working hard at is increasing that risk of harm.

216
00:58:57,186 --> 00:58:58,788
So use rates go down.

217
00:59:00,132 --> 00:59:04,116
And then our students perceived ease of access.

218
00:59:04,737 --> 00:59:12,545
In general, students were most likely to see that alcohol and vapes were easy to get.

219
00:59:12,765 --> 00:59:15,128
And in the focus groups, we asked how they get them.

220
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:15,928
And they said,

221
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:31,388
It's, you know, it's seen as normalized and they're often accessed through their social networks parties, older peers, and on Snapchat that was a big source of accessing alcohol and vapes.

222
00:59:35,755 --> 00:59:45,259
The strategies and this is something where Medford should be really proud of the multiple tiers of strategies around substance use prevention.

223
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:57,025
Rachel Perry and the health education team do a fabulous job of implementing the evidence based Michigan model, but they've also supplemented that with catch my breath.

224
00:59:58,565 --> 01:00:01,726
which is a vaping-specific strategy.

225
01:00:02,086 --> 01:00:20,090
And most recently, one of our health department staff went in and did a training for all the health teachers on utilizing all the materials within Catch My Breath and making sure everyone felt appropriately able to implement it, even pushing down into all the middle school ages.

226
01:00:21,858 --> 01:00:38,072
We've been implementing the tier two I decide with with the staff at the high school and we have now pushed that down to the middle school and that's for any student that gets caught using substances or is under the influence, instead of getting.

227
01:00:39,833 --> 01:00:43,716
getting sent to detention or getting suspended.

228
01:00:43,816 --> 01:00:49,901
Now they are part of this intervention strategy facilitated by some of the school staff.

229
01:00:50,862 --> 01:00:55,525
And we've seen over 30 students refer to this program this year.

230
01:00:55,545 --> 01:00:57,907
So we're seeing a lot of great things that come out of it.

231
01:00:58,307 --> 01:01:03,051
The school has a wellness coach, Gavin, who is able to support students

232
01:01:04,212 --> 01:01:07,075
whose substances are negatively impacting their lives.

233
01:01:07,175 --> 01:01:10,599
He's there at the high school halftime.

234
01:01:11,741 --> 01:01:14,063
We've got peer leaders in the high school now.

235
01:01:15,385 --> 01:01:22,813
We have the SBIRT screening tool where Medford's really doing the best

236
01:01:24,031 --> 01:01:36,494
implementation of that because they're using outside wellness coaches to screen students, and we're seeing students being really honest in their conversations, and we're able to then refer them to help.

237
01:01:36,594 --> 01:01:38,894
And then, of course, the vape detectors.

238
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:44,355
That is one of the reasons why we have over 30 referrals to the iDecide program.

239
01:01:44,375 --> 01:01:45,255
They are working.

240
01:01:45,315 --> 01:01:53,037
Students talked about them a lot during the focus group as a strategy for kind of having students think twice.

241
01:01:53,757 --> 01:01:59,301
So those are some of our of the great strategies being implemented in Medford.

242
01:02:02,383 --> 01:02:03,063
Thanks, Catherine.

243
01:02:03,443 --> 01:02:13,850
For student safety, most of our high school students and middle school students reported thinking their neighborhood is extremely safe or safe from crime, which was nice to hear.

244
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:16,612
Ninety seven percent of middle schoolers and ninety four high schoolers.

245
01:02:17,473 --> 01:02:19,434
They also talked about feeling safe at school.

246
01:02:19,858 --> 01:02:26,059
So about 83% of high school students and 87% of middle school students reported feeling very safe at school.

247
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:35,822
Students who identified as Hispanic and Latino were more likely to report skipping school in the past 30 days due to feeling unsafe at or on the way to school.

248
01:02:36,262 --> 01:02:45,364
Because the survey was implemented last spring, we are noting that this data is likely due to ICE.

249
01:02:46,504 --> 01:02:49,125
So it's pretty depressing to see some of these stats come in.

250
01:02:51,681 --> 01:03:02,825
Although reports of bullying declined as students transitioned from middle to high school or to high school, middle schoolers who identified as black were most likely to report experiencing bullying online or on school property.

251
01:03:06,486 --> 01:03:09,047
Medford students reported similar rates of having

252
01:03:09,521 --> 01:03:17,424
Well, the question was sexual things done to them or were forced to do sexual things they did not want ever to that available state data.

253
01:03:17,644 --> 01:03:28,449
There's no state comparison for the middle school and high school students in 23 or middle school students in 21, but you can note here 11% of Massachusetts versus 9% of Medford.

254
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:35,612
LGBTQ students were more likely to experience unwanted sexual contact.

255
01:03:39,285 --> 01:03:42,834
These are strategies that we have in Medford Public Schools for student safety.

256
01:03:43,556 --> 01:03:45,862
We have the Get Real sexual health curriculum.

257
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:51,673
in our health classes, the mentors in violence prevention lessons as well.

258
01:03:52,013 --> 01:04:01,419
Portal to Hope, which is very well connected to Medford, comes in and does presentations about domestic violence, but also about healthy relationships, which is really important.

259
01:04:01,899 --> 01:04:10,364
Of course, we have our social emotional learning to include restorative practices and our Sandy Hook Promise anonymous reporting system.

260
01:04:10,424 --> 01:04:12,525
They've been, again, excellent partners to us.

261
01:04:19,565 --> 01:04:20,005
All right.

262
01:04:20,966 --> 01:04:35,933
So the risk factors that we just went over really help us understand where youth may be vulnerable, but it's really the protective factors, especially trusted adults, supportive relationships that play a critical role in buffering stress and reducing them.

263
01:04:36,094 --> 01:04:42,397
So when we know that when young people feel connected to caring adults, they are much more likely to seek help

264
01:04:43,097 --> 01:04:46,260
and build resilience and experience positive outcomes.

265
01:04:47,081 --> 01:04:59,872
So one thing that's great to note that Medford High School students report trusted adults and their rate of reporting that is higher than the state average and I've been looking at trusted adult data for

266
01:05:00,992 --> 01:05:14,999
Over two decades and you know having 81% of students that recognize a trusted adult may seem low but that is high for a high school, and we heard a lot of positive things coming out of our focus groups of why of what.

267
01:05:16,399 --> 01:05:18,021
the school is doing to promote that.

268
01:05:18,461 --> 01:05:27,169
But as you can see by the next slide, results do vary based on race and ethnicity at both the middle and the high school.

269
01:05:27,209 --> 01:05:37,898
So that's something that we can look at as we can see Black students experiencing the lowest rate of trusted adults at both the middle school and high school level.

270
01:05:41,672 --> 01:06:03,293
And this is why, you know, one of the reasons that, you know, if we look at trusted adults outside of the school, the partnership between the city, the health and outreach department, and the schools are so important because we can look at what strategies are we implementing across the city to build trusted adults,

271
01:06:04,193 --> 01:06:08,475
amongst different groups and what support systems can we put in.

272
01:06:08,655 --> 01:06:16,898
So that's something that we're taking a look at and the ways that people like our liaisons and our connectors can do some of that work.

273
01:06:19,631 --> 01:06:22,714
supportive relationships.

274
01:06:22,814 --> 01:06:32,603
We know that our overall students have supportive relationships, but that changed significantly for our LGBTQ plus population.

275
01:06:33,824 --> 01:06:40,790
One thing we did hear from, we did a focus group with a group of LGBTQ plus students.

276
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:53,121
And they did report that they noticed an increased representation of diverse staff and clubs that help students feel seen and connected.

277
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:59,808
And they noticed that change and recognizing that being a positive difference that they've seen.

278
01:07:03,263 --> 01:07:06,926
And sleep, something that we want to keep an eye on.

279
01:07:06,966 --> 01:07:14,113
We understand that sleep is directly impacted to learning, impacts learning and so many other protective factors.

280
01:07:14,213 --> 01:07:23,322
So knowing that less than 50% of our middle school students and only 30% of our high school students are getting the sleep they need.

281
01:07:25,743 --> 01:07:32,146
And I do have to say our youth action team is actually implementing a sleep update.

282
01:07:32,566 --> 01:07:41,269
They were taking a look at some of the preliminary data and are implementing a positive sleep norms campaign throughout the high school.

283
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:43,610
So we'll see what that looks like.

284
01:07:45,091 --> 01:07:51,053
And then we see sleep again amongst race and ethnic groups.

285
01:07:52,622 --> 01:07:53,504
different outcomes.

286
01:07:54,064 --> 01:07:56,769
And then physical activity, something that we're looking at.

287
01:08:00,295 --> 01:08:06,424
Difference, both the middle school and the high school, highest amongst our white students.

288
01:08:08,609 --> 01:08:22,479
And then nutrition, something that we are looking at as well amongst the community partners and sharing this data across different leaders in the district.

289
01:08:25,099 --> 01:08:41,448
And then some strategies that have been impactful for protective factors, a lot of professional development, we're working with the schools to provide resources to provide professional development, really focusing on a sense of belonging.

290
01:08:41,688 --> 01:08:43,449
I know the schools recently at the last

291
01:08:44,770 --> 01:08:47,151
Professional Development Day had some great trainings.

292
01:08:47,871 --> 01:08:57,416
Breakfast carts, something simple as breakfast carts being available in the lobby so students that didn't have time to get breakfast, don't have time to go to the cafeteria, can grab something to eat.

293
01:08:57,856 --> 01:09:00,898
Daily movement breaks, lots of athletic opportunities.

294
01:09:00,978 --> 01:09:07,161
I know the high school having recess if they finish lunch has been very positive.

295
01:09:08,101 --> 01:09:13,784
We have a YouthWorks employment program that has been successful working with the school to recruit

296
01:09:14,404 --> 01:09:23,752
students that don't typically have work experience at a young age, and collaboration across the region.

297
01:09:23,832 --> 01:09:27,254
We are excited to launch Caregiver University this year.

298
01:09:27,275 --> 01:09:42,867
We'll start out with some workshops on things like social emotional topics, substance use, and even gambling to provide caregivers with the information that they need to be able to build these protective factors and reduce risk factors for their young people.

299
01:09:44,692 --> 01:10:01,020
And speaking of gambling, we've been doing some work around this because it is an emerging something that we're taking a look at as sports betting and online gaming have become legalized across Massachusetts.

300
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,742
And you can see our 2023 data from

301
01:10:06,643 --> 01:10:12,728
Massachusetts, but we recently did a survey for young adults in Medford.

302
01:10:12,988 --> 01:10:15,450
And what we found was really interesting.

303
01:10:16,351 --> 01:10:33,163
And we heard from our students in the focus groups that online gambling and sports betting have gotten a lot of excitement amongst young people, with students naming platforms like DraftKings, FanDuel, and PrizePix as being very popular.

304
01:10:35,428 --> 01:10:40,571
Students described gambling as adding excitement to sports and a lot of appeal.

305
01:10:40,711 --> 01:10:47,756
And one student openly endorsed gambling, trying to convince other students in the focus group they should do it more.

306
01:10:47,836 --> 01:10:50,358
So it really shocked our staff.

307
01:10:50,418 --> 01:10:53,640
And we really do want to do more across the city.

308
01:10:53,660 --> 01:11:00,084
And we have a group that's focused on looking at gambling prevention across the city.

309
01:11:01,285 --> 01:11:04,467
So we're very excited about this coalition work that we're launching.

310
01:11:04,487 --> 01:11:12,931
And I'll turn it over to Stacey for the last slide.

311
01:11:14,212 --> 01:11:14,952
Thanks, Catherine.

312
01:11:16,053 --> 01:11:30,600
So again, the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, we hope to continue with and increase our participation, which will allow us to align with comparative local data and identify some of the challenges and strengths across Medford, but also across our communities at large.

313
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:36,870
And the biggest part of it is to inform our prevention and supportive strategies, to use comparable standardized data.

314
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:42,414
I'm really grateful to, obviously, Catherine and the Office of Prevention and Outreach for partnering with us.

315
01:11:43,614 --> 01:11:51,919
This is a big undertaking, certainly, to switch into a new survey, and we look forward to increasing data for years to come.

316
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:52,860
Thank you.

317
01:12:02,278 --> 01:12:03,518
Thank you, Ms.

318
01:12:03,558 --> 01:12:04,799
Schulman and Ms.

319
01:12:04,839 --> 01:12:08,059
Dhingra for the very detailed presentation.

320
01:12:08,079 --> 01:12:13,060
And thank you for all the hard work you're doing on all issues facing our students.

321
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:17,241
I'm gonna turn it over to members of the committee that may have questions.

322
01:12:17,821 --> 01:12:22,742
I believe, let's see who was first.

323
01:12:26,143 --> 01:12:27,203
Member Reinfeldt, okay.

324
01:12:27,878 --> 01:12:29,260
All right, thank you so much.

325
01:12:30,101 --> 01:12:36,811
I really appreciate the presentation, particularly the juxtaposition of the data and the strategies.

326
01:12:37,232 --> 01:12:40,717
I thought that was a really nice way of laying this out and I appreciate it.

327
01:12:40,737 --> 01:12:43,321
I do have some questions.

328
01:12:44,342 --> 01:12:46,043
about the strategies.

329
01:12:47,204 --> 01:12:51,266
Do we have any way of assessing how often they're used?

330
01:12:51,346 --> 01:12:56,289
Obviously, some of those things are built into the curriculum and how effective students find them.

331
01:12:56,329 --> 01:13:00,411
So those kind of tier one type things, everyone is receiving them.

332
01:13:01,151 --> 01:13:07,835
So how are we mapping the strategies to changes and trends?

333
01:13:09,751 --> 01:13:10,972
Sure, I'm happy to answer that.

334
01:13:11,152 --> 01:13:17,177
So we keep data, certainly all the tier one strategies is something all students are having, right?

335
01:13:17,237 --> 01:13:27,524
So we're looking at this data from our secondary level, certainly the use for behavior survey, are these like elementary level interventions potentially having an impact?

336
01:13:27,985 --> 01:13:31,948
That being said, there are so many compounding factors that go into this.

337
01:13:32,431 --> 01:13:38,034
So it's hard to parse out what is working in that from that large longitudinal data level.

338
01:13:38,595 --> 01:13:43,998
From the secondary level, we do keep data in terms of students who are accessing those tier two supports.

339
01:13:44,438 --> 01:13:56,686
So if you were talking about our, for example, our signs of suicide program, we track every year the number of students who are noting that they need help in the moment, they're connected with a counselor, and then we get them the help that they need right away, right?

340
01:13:56,706 --> 01:13:58,387
So we're looking at that over time.

341
01:13:59,011 --> 01:14:01,992
and tracking how many students are connected to our wellness coach.

342
01:14:02,052 --> 01:14:03,193
Those are just two data points.

343
01:14:05,293 --> 01:14:10,235
As Catherine noted, we're using our data from the vape detectors to connect students to those services.

344
01:14:10,915 --> 01:14:14,937
Because some of these things are new in the last couple of years, I think it'll take us a little while.

345
01:14:16,357 --> 01:14:17,358
to see the impact.

346
01:14:17,758 --> 01:14:18,198
Absolutely.

347
01:14:18,218 --> 01:14:23,801
And for context, I sat in on a joint meeting of various student councils.

348
01:14:23,841 --> 01:14:25,782
I think we still have one of our student reps on the call.

349
01:14:26,122 --> 01:14:28,764
But mental health was one of the breakout sessions that I went into.

350
01:14:28,844 --> 01:14:40,030
And they were talking about students' awareness and access and trying to get some information about what are students aware of as far as those extra resources and do they find them effective.

351
01:14:40,090 --> 01:14:43,712
So this is something that I think students really want to know as well.

352
01:14:44,793 --> 01:14:59,572
And then I guess similar on the strategies, what about, so you showed a couple of real discrepancies in the data and it's out and I'm curious what you have to

353
01:15:00,842 --> 01:15:07,167
bring those closer to a more universal picture.

354
01:15:07,187 --> 01:15:12,731
The vape sensors, you can proactively identify what's happening there.

355
01:15:13,432 --> 01:15:15,013
What about those data?

356
01:15:15,073 --> 01:15:22,558
And I know I've heard Dr. Galussi talk about some of the strategies happening in the administration around hiring and trusted adults.

357
01:15:23,459 --> 01:15:28,363
So I'm curious how that will be playing out over the next couple of

358
01:15:30,087 --> 01:15:32,076
more like in terms of student groups.

359
01:15:33,577 --> 01:15:54,711
Yeah, like in terms of what are the, to make LGBTQ students feel more connected, what kind of, I saw the GSA, I know there've been conversations and how those targeted interventions are happening based on the data without introducing stigma and feeling targeted in a negative way.

360
01:15:55,432 --> 01:15:56,292
Sure, absolutely.

361
01:15:56,373 --> 01:16:02,717
I think it's just student groups to be mindful of that they may need support and to make sure they know what supports are available for them.

362
01:16:03,117 --> 01:16:03,277
Great.

363
01:16:03,297 --> 01:16:09,581
And I was really happy to see professional development top on the list of strategies there and awareness around the staff.

364
01:16:10,062 --> 01:16:10,742
Yes, absolutely.

365
01:16:11,082 --> 01:16:13,064
A clarifying question on the data.

366
01:16:13,084 --> 01:16:18,287
Remember, Reinfeld, could I just add on one quick thing before you go to your next question?

367
01:16:18,347 --> 01:16:23,270
I also do want to say two other points about your last comment.

368
01:16:23,530 --> 01:16:25,031
One is, I think that was also

369
01:16:25,992 --> 01:16:46,076
our intentional and purposeful reason for also creating and introducing rainbow clubs at the elementary level because we want to make sure we are starting a lot of this support and education at the earlier ages so that we can hopefully see some of that data trend in a different way.

370
01:16:46,656 --> 01:16:48,837
And I would also say that some of the data

371
01:16:51,263 --> 01:17:03,391
might be maybe like difficult to look at, but one of the things that we have tried to do is leverage our partnership with City Year, who this year has also put some student teachers in our schools.

372
01:17:03,651 --> 01:17:05,712
And those are student teachers of color.

373
01:17:06,212 --> 01:17:13,797
And one of the key goals for Metro Public Schools that we do not have is a diversified workforce that looks like our students.

374
01:17:14,037 --> 01:17:16,219
And so in some of these data points,

375
01:17:16,939 --> 01:17:21,923
where we want students to feel like they have a trusted adult for them to be able to go to.

376
01:17:22,383 --> 01:17:31,110
I would say that part of our work is also making sure that we are doing what we can to diversify our workforce.

377
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:34,412
We have City Year as one of those ways to do it.

378
01:17:34,572 --> 01:17:45,080
And Dr. Talbot is also working with a lot of higher educational institutions to make sure that we're able to have a workforce that represents our students.

379
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:46,401
Great, thank you.

380
01:17:46,421 --> 01:17:51,185
Yes, I remember that from your report last time and I appreciate putting it in the context of this.

381
01:17:51,586 --> 01:17:54,529
A clarifying question on the year-to-year comparisons.

382
01:17:54,849 --> 01:17:59,974
When we're seeing the state data, is that YRBS data or is that the comparable

383
01:18:01,003 --> 01:18:04,828
survey to what we had been using previously as well.

384
01:18:04,848 --> 01:18:09,894
I think I'm mostly wondering what the error bars are and how comparable it is with the new survey.

385
01:18:10,294 --> 01:18:15,741
How many grains of salt do we need to be saying this 4% jump is meaningful?

386
01:18:17,002 --> 01:18:18,704
That is YRBS data.

387
01:18:18,824 --> 01:18:21,486
So we we did the state YRBS data.

388
01:18:21,506 --> 01:18:25,270
They typically don't have middle school data available.

389
01:18:25,370 --> 01:18:26,892
So we have that for this.

390
01:18:27,132 --> 01:18:33,799
We're using that for the state, but when we're looking at our trend, we're looking at I decide and or communities that care, sorry.

391
01:18:34,827 --> 01:18:35,467
Right, yeah.

392
01:18:35,487 --> 01:18:37,368
So past 30-day use.

393
01:18:38,329 --> 01:18:42,031
Some things we could do trend data on and some things we couldn't.

394
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:45,272
We had to look at how the question was asked.

395
01:18:45,932 --> 01:18:55,037
And one thing I did want to note too is that we recently got a Partnerships for Success grant for the federal grant that's

396
01:18:56,278 --> 01:18:58,479
1.25 million over the next five years.

397
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:04,663
And that is where we could bring in outside evaluators to help us put a lot of this data together.

398
01:19:04,783 --> 01:19:09,486
So we can look to the school committee and say, what type of data would you like to see?

399
01:19:09,606 --> 01:19:18,672
And they will be available to put school culture data together and some of the other data going forward.

400
01:19:18,772 --> 01:19:20,653
So we just got that grant.

401
01:19:21,894 --> 01:19:24,815
starting in November so stay tuned for more.

402
01:19:24,835 --> 01:19:40,822
That's really exciting because I know part of the shift to YRBS meant we were losing some of the panorama questions that we had before that were really specifically focused on school culture based on the analysis that was done before my time on the school committee but was still

403
01:19:41,482 --> 01:19:42,843
really relevant.

404
01:19:43,324 --> 01:19:50,109
A quick on the focus groups, were those done in parallel with the survey or were they done as a response to the survey?

405
01:19:50,129 --> 01:19:58,635
So were you asking the focus groups about things you saw in the survey or were you just collecting that same baseline data with the focus groups?

406
01:19:58,815 --> 01:20:08,901
We actually met with the school administration team, and we looked at some of the preliminary data coming out of the YRBS, but also wanting more contextual data around things.

407
01:20:08,981 --> 01:20:12,022
So that's where we came up with a list of questions.

408
01:20:12,082 --> 01:20:16,745
And we could provide an executive report of the focus group for you.

409
01:20:17,385 --> 01:20:17,705
OK.

410
01:20:17,825 --> 01:20:26,750
And then when you say students want actively engaging approaches, is that referring to in classrooms, in clubs?

411
01:20:28,852 --> 01:20:29,452
What does that mean?

412
01:20:29,492 --> 01:20:38,879
It was a great comment, and I see it coming in our education plan for the high school, but where were they requesting actively engaging approaches?

413
01:20:38,919 --> 01:20:44,263
I think that was in reference to some of the school cultural building activities.

414
01:20:45,395 --> 01:20:45,816
Okay.

415
01:20:46,076 --> 01:20:56,427
And then my very last comment is just, I think there is a huge amount of information and questions on this sleep idea, and I would love to explore that further.

416
01:20:56,527 --> 01:21:06,979
I'm not going to take the time in this meeting because I see lots of hands up after me, but that is really important to talk about in terms of culture, in terms of

417
01:21:08,013 --> 01:21:12,715
academic homework loads, school start times, scheduling of activities, all of that.

418
01:21:12,775 --> 01:21:16,357
So thank you for highlighting it to be continued.

419
01:21:16,677 --> 01:21:17,357
Thank you so much.

420
01:21:19,218 --> 01:21:20,559
Thank you, Member Reinfeldt.

421
01:21:20,819 --> 01:21:26,022
We have Member Rousseau, Member Olopade, Member Parks, and then our student reps.

422
01:21:26,082 --> 01:21:29,463
So I'll turn it over to you, Member Rousseau.

423
01:21:30,644 --> 01:21:31,044
Thank you.

424
01:21:32,124 --> 01:21:33,145
I don't have as many questions.

425
01:21:33,645 --> 01:21:34,706
Actually, I probably do.

426
01:21:38,342 --> 01:21:43,223
Gambling thing is something that is deeply disturbing.

427
01:21:45,064 --> 01:21:52,966
And I'm wondering what efforts, are we including a lot of parent education in that?

428
01:21:53,066 --> 01:21:56,827
Because I think a lot of parents, if they're not gamblers themselves,

429
01:21:58,977 --> 01:22:04,922
assume my kid can't even get a lottery ticket or a scratch ticket.

430
01:22:05,243 --> 01:22:09,026
That's just not a thing because stores don't want to lose their licenses.

431
01:22:10,888 --> 01:22:20,777
And so to know that kids can gamble as if they're millionaires, frankly, with these apps, I think parents

432
01:22:21,527 --> 01:22:24,569
are going to be a bit shocked, is my guess.

433
01:22:24,609 --> 01:22:38,720
I mean, I only heard about it on the radio recently, the amount of kids that are actually using apps in middle school, even though all the apps say you have to be 18, or what is it, 21 even, I don't know.

434
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,462
So I just wanted to ask, is there

435
01:22:43,483 --> 01:22:44,964
Is there an actual program?

436
01:22:45,084 --> 01:23:01,771
And I mean, it's such a relatively new problem, there may not be something we can buy off the shelf, but whatever it is, I just hope we can include parent education in that, because I think that's, there's only so much we can do when it comes to kids and their phones.

437
01:23:03,163 --> 01:23:11,085
I'm glad you said that because that is actually going to be one of our first Caregiver University workshops that we're offering this spring.

438
01:23:11,845 --> 01:23:20,147
And that is something we use some of the Gaming Commission funds to do that intensive study on youth and young adult gambling in Medford.

439
01:23:20,487 --> 01:23:24,968
We actually have 150 page report coming out on our findings and

440
01:23:25,988 --> 01:23:32,474
We heard from a lot of students, coaches, things that helped drive our strategies that we'll be rolling out.

441
01:23:32,574 --> 01:23:47,526
But that is something that we found out what, you know, the spectrum, like what, you know, video gaming to online betting to playing poker and this parent and caregiver education will address all of that.

442
01:23:48,547 --> 01:23:49,208
Thank you so much.

443
01:24:00,216 --> 01:24:00,808
Remember old potty.

444
01:24:03,350 --> 01:24:03,810
Thank you.

445
01:24:04,531 --> 01:24:05,871
And thank you so much for this report.

446
01:24:05,891 --> 01:24:10,933
I think this is really comprehensive and is giving us, the committee and myself, a really good idea about where we are.

447
01:24:10,953 --> 01:24:12,674
I had a couple of questions.

448
01:24:13,634 --> 01:24:20,297
So I know towards the beginning of the presentation, you did note how to interpret the data, given the fact that there's some subjectivity to it.

449
01:24:20,397 --> 01:24:25,420
And I understand that this does not always include or does not always indicate things inherently.

450
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:30,722
There's some understanding that needs to be added before we can kind of pull away any immediate expectations.

451
01:24:31,542 --> 01:24:36,787
One of the things I did wonder about was the general mental health section.

452
01:24:36,847 --> 01:24:49,299
So just really, really early on, you know, it's noting that there is 19% of middle schoolers are noting some, you know, not good mental health and then 20% of high schoolers.

453
01:24:50,160 --> 01:25:04,903
When we talk about generalizations like that, and again, like we're using sample sizes, was there any follow-up questions that were added to kind of clarify what not good meant, or is it just the student's interpretation of the question that you allowed to be used?

454
01:25:05,804 --> 01:25:07,044
That's a great question.

455
01:25:08,204 --> 01:25:14,506
So I wrestle with this as a mental health clinician myself with all of these surveys, because this is not a clinical diagnosis.

456
01:25:14,586 --> 01:25:19,687
It's certainly a very short question that we're asking them, but it is left to their interpretation.

457
01:25:20,371 --> 01:25:25,273
And then what I, you know, we need to remind ourselves, that's how they're perceiving themselves.

458
01:25:25,333 --> 01:25:29,355
So whether they're clinically depressed or they're clinically anxious, doesn't really matter.

459
01:25:29,375 --> 01:25:32,236
They're feeling like themselves that they're not doing well.

460
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:34,297
And I think that's really important.

461
01:25:35,822 --> 01:25:36,162
Thank you.

462
01:25:36,302 --> 01:25:36,542
Yeah.

463
01:25:36,582 --> 01:25:47,144
And I had the same question or wonder is that regardless of how, you know, we may want to interpret it, I think that the student's response to that question, I think is what's important to kind of be a good indicator of kind of how we're going to move forward.

464
01:25:48,084 --> 01:25:52,805
The second portion is more of a recognition more than a question, but I do appreciate it being added.

465
01:25:53,165 --> 01:26:01,867
When we move towards, I think slide 15, the strategies for student mental health, I did really appreciate that there's recognition that how we're going to offer some additional

466
01:26:02,987 --> 01:26:07,669
responses to this, to these questions, is by also including the adults in the conversation.

467
01:26:07,689 --> 01:26:14,112
A lot of research has been done in the last couple decades from DESE, from the Department of Ed, from the federal government, for example.

468
01:26:14,152 --> 01:26:23,036
A lot of private organizations and institutes have talked about the link between parent-guardian support as to how they impact student success rates.

469
01:26:24,116 --> 01:26:27,418
And not just parents, but, you know, caregivers and faculty in the classrooms as well.

470
01:26:27,778 --> 01:26:37,669
how we're linking those successes directly improve chronic absenteeism, for example, student outcomes, testing scores, graduation rates, and college pursuit.

471
01:26:37,769 --> 01:26:42,855
So I did appreciate that because I know that a lot of people are having some questions about how we're being impacted.

472
01:26:44,884 --> 01:26:55,253
To move on a little bit, this is a question I think for our central admin, but I think also potentially might be something we want to develop going forward.

473
01:26:55,573 --> 01:26:59,056
If we move on to slide 30, the trusted adults section.

474
01:27:01,394 --> 01:27:19,247
Is there any professional development that's been woven into our general standard for our staff about how to, I think, create and develop those relationships with students or to continue being sources of support other than just being the kind of daily teacher in the classroom?

475
01:27:19,347 --> 01:27:25,972
I don't know if the superintendent knows at all if that's built in or if there's any separated teaching about that.

476
01:27:28,823 --> 01:27:54,770
I would probably, the way I would answer that is to say specifically like separated to that exact context, um, not to date what we have done for the past, uh, I would say two years has really been focusing on the, the global piece of that whole child by bringing in, as previously stated in some of the presentations to this body, bringing in, uh, the gleam network and

477
01:27:55,613 --> 01:28:12,701
where we're focusing on our instructional practices to make sure that students feel that sense of affirmation and engagement and meaning in their learning spaces is something that's been a big priority for us in these past two years.

478
01:28:12,721 --> 01:28:19,445
I would say that there are other additional supports in which teachers are there and available for students.

479
01:28:20,625 --> 01:28:28,329
in terms of like the content that is given to students through the advisory, through Nexus, through health curriculum.

480
01:28:29,189 --> 01:28:42,815
There are pieces of that woven into times of the day like that, but it also could be a growth area in terms of like specifically to your point about trusted adults.

481
01:28:43,455 --> 01:28:46,497
That's an area that I can have conversations with Ms.

482
01:28:46,517 --> 01:28:49,558
Schulman, Dr. Talbot, and the principals.

483
01:28:50,398 --> 01:28:50,927
and directors.

484
01:28:52,652 --> 01:28:53,032
Thank you.

485
01:28:53,433 --> 01:29:00,698
And I do note that I think, especially given right now, I think there's a lot of questions about the safety of our students and faculty.

486
01:29:01,399 --> 01:29:10,045
You can see that some of the concern about the Hispanic and Latino population are feeling heightened concern and anxiety about safety in the schools, about going to school.

487
01:29:11,587 --> 01:29:15,369
We don't need to get into a whole conversation about the specifics about why that may be right now.

488
01:29:15,690 --> 01:29:18,212
I think we all can kind of pull some assumption by that.

489
01:29:18,472 --> 01:29:21,895
But I do think that trying to have a conversation about how we are

490
01:29:23,095 --> 01:29:34,081
making sure that our staff feel like they can provide additional support to our students socially, emotionally, intellectually, what have you, especially in times of heightened concern and anxiety.

491
01:29:35,061 --> 01:29:37,762
I think it's probably a really good thing to kind of think about a little bit as we move forward.

492
01:29:37,782 --> 01:29:40,444
But I think to your point, it's kind of already built into

493
01:29:41,744 --> 01:29:46,707
you know, just being a teacher in general and a staff member in our schools, that is an expectation about providing that safe space.

494
01:29:47,387 --> 01:29:52,729
But obviously the questions that some students may be having and parents may be adding some additional questions.

495
01:29:54,030 --> 01:30:02,594
And then the last question slash point is, if we move on to slide, I think 38, you know, the strategies for protective factors.

496
01:30:03,466 --> 01:30:14,310
The breakfast carts I think is a phenomenal idea, just because you know again we talked a lot about creating the space for students be successful and I think having having a good meal in the morning is probably a good starting point.

497
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:20,472
And obviously I'd like to see all these populations increase especially our lower our lower population percentages.

498
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:34,697
When we talk about, you know, and there's a lot of conversation at the state level about the cost of things and about our universal food free meal programs and how there's some question or concern from the state delegation, if we can actually

499
01:30:36,029 --> 01:30:41,893
afford to maintain our universal free food plan just because of budget cuts and things like that.

500
01:30:42,633 --> 01:30:49,498
With breakfast carts, at this particular moment, I would wonder or hope that that would be covered under the free plan.

501
01:30:50,138 --> 01:30:53,100
But if we move forward and there's some change, and God forbid,

502
01:30:54,665 --> 01:31:00,206
I hope that we can have a conversation about moving forward, about finding other ways to source that food if we want to move forward with breakfast cards.

503
01:31:00,606 --> 01:31:13,888
How we do that, obviously, is not quite there yet, but I'm just conscious of the fact that we're going to, if we want to provide that strategy for the students, we need to be careful about what that will look like financially if things change.

504
01:31:14,948 --> 01:31:15,429
That's all I got.

505
01:31:15,509 --> 01:31:16,049
Thank you so much.

506
01:31:19,349 --> 01:31:20,249
Thank you, Member Olpade.

507
01:31:20,889 --> 01:31:24,090
Our student rep, Olachi, and then Member Reinfeldt.

508
01:31:24,890 --> 01:31:30,593
Okay, I'm going to hopefully you can hear me.

509
01:31:31,233 --> 01:31:31,693
I'm sorry.

510
01:31:31,713 --> 01:31:32,434
My voice is a bit.

511
01:31:33,574 --> 01:31:38,016
Um, but sick, but, um, yeah, I, I just, I guess I just really wanted to say, like.

512
01:31:38,576 --> 01:31:44,619
You know, whenever we look at these, the same data at the regional or the state level, it's always really, really insightful.

513
01:31:44,699 --> 01:31:47,360
And this is sort of my 1st time seeing it on the district level.

514
01:31:47,421 --> 01:31:52,023
And so I think that it's really important that this data is collected.

515
01:31:52,043 --> 01:31:52,563
I think.

516
01:31:54,280 --> 01:32:10,046
Um, like personally as, uh, maybe a target of, you know, some of the, uh, someone who's, um, maybe in some of those more marginalized groups that has been subject to a lot of those things that, you know, you, uh, try and target for on the survey.

517
01:32:10,346 --> 01:32:11,546
Um, it does mean a lot.

518
01:32:11,566 --> 01:32:13,587
I think it means maybe more than it would otherwise.

519
01:32:14,707 --> 01:32:21,750
Um, is there any effort currently to make this data accessible to students or like more accessible to students?

520
01:32:26,121 --> 01:32:30,625
Thank you, yes, we can certainly figure out a way to make that accessible to our students.

521
01:32:31,846 --> 01:32:32,767
Great, thank you so much.

522
01:32:33,547 --> 01:32:34,448
Cool, great question.

523
01:32:35,389 --> 01:32:54,785
And I did wanna say something now that we have the youth action teams, both at the high school and the middle school, one thing they do, they do a lot of education, they do the Mustang Newsflash, I forget what the newsletter is called, but they actually put information about, they feature a trusted adult

524
01:32:55,165 --> 01:33:04,329
And they'll start to take some of the data from this and spin it in a positive way, showing students that most students are making healthy choices, things like that.

525
01:33:04,389 --> 01:33:12,131
So communicating this data in ways that is meaningful to students.

526
01:33:12,231 --> 01:33:15,753
But we'd love to have students look at this data and help them interpret it.

527
01:33:17,594 --> 01:33:17,814
Great.

528
01:33:18,034 --> 01:33:18,374
Thank you.

529
01:33:19,774 --> 01:33:21,455
Member Reinfeld and Member Mastroboni.

530
01:33:22,695 --> 01:33:32,112
Yes, I realized I had wanted to ask to what extent you're studying and or exploring the nuance of.

531
01:33:33,087 --> 01:33:35,508
in person versus online.

532
01:33:35,548 --> 01:33:50,473
I know the bullying stats have bullying on school property and bullying online, but I'm curious what kind of data you're collecting around social media and just general digital health, both for students and also for the caregiver university.

533
01:33:50,973 --> 01:33:53,234
But that's a huge piece of this.

534
01:33:53,574 --> 01:33:55,935
I imagine if I get into the data, I'll see a lot more of it.

535
01:33:56,355 --> 01:34:03,199
But if you could speak about that component, that is really important for how students go through the world right now.

536
01:34:04,259 --> 01:34:05,720
It's unbelievably important.

537
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:09,602
And I also want to go back to your previous point of how much it connects to sleep.

538
01:34:11,823 --> 01:34:18,047
And how what we're finding, this is not in the report, but just from like a anecdotal portion of it.

539
01:34:19,338 --> 01:34:27,988
We're finding students reporting they're not sleeping because they're up on their devices and they're either playing games or they're trying to connect with other peers.

540
01:34:28,809 --> 01:34:33,635
But there's a lot of device use that's happening during the evenings when they should be sleeping.

541
01:34:34,195 --> 01:34:38,781
The question around bullying did have a differential in terms of in person and online.

542
01:34:39,571 --> 01:34:50,279
That was a question that highlighted that I don't think that the survey pulls out much more information related to a differential around that and I would have to go back to look at.

543
01:34:51,542 --> 01:34:53,863
if they were asking around social media use.

544
01:34:53,903 --> 01:34:56,144
But yes, this is a huge thing that we're looking at.

545
01:34:56,884 --> 01:34:59,725
This is certainly impacting our youth in many ways.

546
01:35:00,865 --> 01:35:02,426
And it's connected to all of these factors.

547
01:35:02,906 --> 01:35:03,306
Yeah, great.

548
01:35:03,326 --> 01:35:06,587
Because I think the interpersonal components look different.

549
01:35:06,647 --> 01:35:07,467
I think we all know this.

550
01:35:07,507 --> 01:35:11,129
They look different face to face than they do online.

551
01:35:11,309 --> 01:35:12,689
Even as adults, we see that.

552
01:35:13,229 --> 01:35:14,190
Yes, absolutely.

553
01:35:14,270 --> 01:35:18,391
But one thing I will highlight about online use is that our anonymous reporting system

554
01:35:19,028 --> 01:35:26,113
has been immensely helpful in terms of students having a platform to either tell us about something that's going on with themselves or a peer.

555
01:35:27,014 --> 01:35:30,556
And are there specific strategies in place?

556
01:35:30,576 --> 01:35:46,208
You mentioned a lot of the protective strategies and the interventions, but to the digital education and help people be aware of their digital health and what this does, the relationship with their mental health.

557
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:49,921
Yes, I believe it is part of the health curriculum.

558
01:35:49,941 --> 01:35:56,784
I know we recommended it when we did the health curriculum review, and I see a lot of those changes in these lists, which is great.

559
01:35:57,004 --> 01:35:59,605
But I'm curious where that shows up.

560
01:36:00,725 --> 01:36:03,866
I would have to defer to Rachel Perry to speak about that.

561
01:36:03,886 --> 01:36:06,287
All right.

562
01:36:06,748 --> 01:36:07,108
Thank you.

563
01:36:11,229 --> 01:36:11,489
Thank you.

564
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:19,542
Again, very appreciative of the presentation.

565
01:36:20,302 --> 01:36:22,123
Great questions, great work.

566
01:36:23,264 --> 01:36:28,547
If nobody has any further questions, we can move on to the next agenda item.

567
01:36:29,067 --> 01:36:31,348
But again, thank you so much for all the hard work.

568
01:36:37,852 --> 01:36:44,035
I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Galluzzi, interim superintendent, and Dr. Kim Talbot, assistant superintendent

569
01:36:44,322 --> 01:36:51,382
for academics and instruction to update us on the proposed educational plan for the Medford High School building project.

570
01:36:54,483 --> 01:36:55,404
Thank you so much.

571
01:36:56,184 --> 01:37:18,158
As Mr. Pippicelli works on screen sharing, I'm just going to take this opportunity to say good evening and thank you for this opportunity to share the work behind Medford High School's educational plan, which is a core deliverable as part of the MSBA process and a critical step in the PDP phase, which we'll talk about tonight.

572
01:37:18,878 --> 01:37:37,312
Dr. Kim Talbot, our Assistant Superintendent for Academics and Instruction, and I are going to walk through how this plan captures our district's educational priorities and translates them into the learning environments, student supports, program needs that are all going to help shape the design of the new high school.

573
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:41,561
Tonight, we are also joined by members of Medford City Council.

574
01:37:41,621 --> 01:37:44,883
Thank you so much, member Leming and Mulaney.

575
01:37:45,383 --> 01:37:48,644
Hope nobody else popped on since I first kind of scanned.

576
01:37:49,905 --> 01:37:55,207
For joining us for this really important meeting and conversation, we really greatly appreciate the support.

577
01:37:56,028 --> 01:38:03,051
We also are joined by our owners project manager, Leftfield, and our design team, SMMA, who I'm going to introduce in just a minute.

578
01:38:03,931 --> 01:38:07,493
And we do, again, just want to thank everybody for being here and appreciate the support.

579
01:38:08,757 --> 01:38:22,830
So our goal this evening is to provide clarity on the educational plan, highlight those key themes that emerged from our work, and show how the educational plan are going to guide the next phases of this MSBA process and our decision making.

580
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:26,073
The screen's good, right?

581
01:38:26,553 --> 01:38:27,334
Yes, I can see it.

582
01:38:27,354 --> 01:38:28,295
Thank you so much, Will.

583
01:38:30,101 --> 01:38:31,002
You can go to the next one.

584
01:38:31,042 --> 01:38:31,443
Perfect.

585
01:38:32,464 --> 01:38:40,816
So I spoke a little bit about this, but our agenda, we're going to talk about the timeline and kind of how we got to the place that we're at, as well as introduce our partners.

586
01:38:41,557 --> 01:38:47,345
We're going to do a review of the educational plan and a discussion around that.

587
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:51,971
And you can just say, thank you.

588
01:38:52,792 --> 01:39:05,982
So this slide really highlights those key milestones that moved Medford Public Schools from the beginning of the MSBA process to establishing the project scope and team.

589
01:39:06,823 --> 01:39:17,605
So it began in April 2023 when we submitted our statement of interest for Medford High School and really began the MSBA partnership process.

590
01:39:18,165 --> 01:39:30,128
In December of 2023, the MSBA Board of Directors approved us and we were able to move forward in this process, which is a really big, major step in advancing the project.

591
01:39:30,628 --> 01:39:35,389
And then April 2024, we formed the School Building Committee.

592
01:39:36,609 --> 01:39:46,653
which was created in essence to provide oversight, transparency, and an asset in community-aligned decision-making throughout this process.

593
01:39:47,673 --> 01:39:51,214
Module one, as you can see here, is the eligibility period.

594
01:39:51,314 --> 01:39:55,836
And during that time, Medford and MSBA worked on project goals.

595
01:39:56,116 --> 01:40:01,057
We had to produce things around enrollment and projections.

596
01:40:02,938 --> 01:40:05,000
really narrowed down around our enrollment.

597
01:40:05,420 --> 01:40:14,028
We were approved with a little back and forth for an enrollment at Medford High School through grades 9 through 12 at about $13.95.

598
01:40:14,949 --> 01:40:28,040
And in addition to that number, we were also approved for the centralization of an early childhood center, which would be comprised of our existing and expanding MEEP,

599
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:35,384
which is our preschool programming, Kids Corner, which is our municipal daycare, as well as Medford Family Network.

600
01:40:36,805 --> 01:40:54,875
As we advanced to module two, which was the forming of this team, the district selected Left Field as our project, our owner's project management team, and began working with them last summer and maybe end of spring, but June of 2025 for this educational plan.

601
01:40:57,736 --> 01:41:07,943
And SMMA came on board as our design team and really began working with us on the development of our educational plan around October of 2025.

602
01:41:14,203 --> 01:41:15,023
Next slide, thank you.

603
01:41:15,964 --> 01:41:34,234
So this slide, as previously stated in April, the school committee appointed a 25-member school committee, excuse me, school building committee, which is made up of Medford's educational leaders, elected and city officials, as well as community members that are listed here.

604
01:41:35,134 --> 01:41:45,472
This committee reflects a strong cross section of voices and expertise and for the core areas needed in this process, which is going to help guide the project.

605
01:41:48,008 --> 01:41:57,276
Through the level of engagement of this team and the thoughtful dialogue and collaboration throughout this process has been essential in moving the work forward.

606
01:41:57,636 --> 01:42:10,746
And even though we may have seen some people leave the committee and new members join the committee, both for past members as well as present members, we are deeply appreciative of their dedication and leadership.

607
01:42:11,787 --> 01:42:20,754
that they have shown throughout this process thus far and their investment to really make sure that we are building a flagship for the Medford community.

608
01:42:20,834 --> 01:42:24,697
So thank you to the Medford Comprehensive School Building Committee.

609
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:32,282
This brings us to our owners project manager group left field.

610
01:42:32,982 --> 01:42:38,443
On the call with us tonight is Macalino, Jen Carlson, and Linda Laporto.

611
01:42:38,463 --> 01:42:41,624
I hope nobody else kind of sneaked on before I looked.

612
01:42:42,565 --> 01:42:52,428
But you can see that they are the project managers for this work and have been deeply involved in every phase thus far since they have joined us.

613
01:42:53,988 --> 01:43:00,635
Their expertise and guidance have been essential to us in helping us navigate each step of this MSBA process.

614
01:43:01,475 --> 01:43:10,945
We're grateful for their partnership, their professionalism, their responsiveness, and look forward to continued partnership through each phase of this work.

615
01:43:13,351 --> 01:43:17,553
From SMMA tonight joining us is Matt Rice and Rosemary Park.

616
01:43:18,934 --> 01:43:28,719
Matt Rice is a project manager and Rosemary Park is one of the educational experts and architects, we are grateful to our design team.

617
01:43:29,659 --> 01:43:38,464
for their leadership and expertise in guiding us through the design and the educational planning work that is associated with this MSBA process.

618
01:43:39,165 --> 01:43:53,193
And it's important work because that's the work that really reflects Medford's vision and continued work in making sure that we are building something that meets the needs of all of our students, our staff, and our community.

619
01:43:53,273 --> 01:43:56,035
So thank you, SMMA and left field.

620
01:43:57,915 --> 01:44:04,759
As we move on, if people have joined our community presentations previously, they may have seen a slide very similar to this.

621
01:44:05,819 --> 01:44:10,342
This shows the MSBA project a little bit like in breath.

622
01:44:11,102 --> 01:44:17,486
What we're doing tonight is we're really kind of drilling down to the pieces that is highlighted here.

623
01:44:18,126 --> 01:44:24,630
So this is the phase right now that we're in, in the development and the definition of the educational plan.

624
01:44:25,330 --> 01:44:30,573
the educational program and what options that we have for us moving forward.

625
01:44:30,633 --> 01:44:35,536
This is the preliminary design program phase that we're in right now.

626
01:44:36,016 --> 01:44:40,658
And it is during this phase in which the educational plan is developed.

627
01:44:41,158 --> 01:44:43,400
And that is what we're going to speak about tonight.

628
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:51,764
It is through this plan that captures our district vision for learning and ensures that the design matches what that vision is.

629
01:44:53,685 --> 01:44:56,493
for our building and what we need now and into the future.

630
01:45:01,125 --> 01:45:01,605
Thank you.

631
01:45:01,665 --> 01:45:04,608
So you can go to the next slide, Mr. Pippicelli.

632
01:45:05,028 --> 01:45:05,589
Thank you.

633
01:45:06,470 --> 01:45:11,134
So this slide really talks a lot about what is the educational plan?

634
01:45:11,594 --> 01:45:15,057
What are those key dates that we're here to discuss tonight?

635
01:45:15,557 --> 01:45:25,866
And so in summary, the key pieces of what an educational plan is throughout this MSBA process, if I were to put it simply, I would say it's our North Star.

636
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:44,189
So it is a document that is going to ensure that our new high school is designed around our current and future pedagogy and instructional practices and vision for that in our schools and our student experience.

637
01:45:44,929 --> 01:45:48,611
It is not a generic fill-in-the-blank template.

638
01:45:50,598 --> 01:45:55,640
it is something that is targeted specifically for Medford Public Schools and the Medford community.

639
01:45:56,541 --> 01:46:05,405
This document is something that for all intensive purposes needs to be the bridge between what our vision is and what the reality is of the building.

640
01:46:06,025 --> 01:46:17,170
So it clarifies the why behind our teaching practices and our learning practices, and then the how of how the spaces need to support that vision.

641
01:46:17,870 --> 01:46:18,991
So the educational plan,

642
01:46:19,751 --> 01:46:20,692
is the why and the how.

643
01:46:22,172 --> 01:46:42,582
The work of the educational plan was grounded, and I think this is really important to note in the voices of our students, our educators, our community members, and our staff, because we want and need to make sure that this plan reflects the real needs and the real experiences within Medford Public Schools.

644
01:46:44,420 --> 01:47:04,220
So the result of the educational plan should be that we are able to create a future-ready, sustainable high school that functions not only as a school, but as a welcoming community, hub, and a place built for flexibility, student agency, and purposeful, joyful learning.

645
01:47:05,278 --> 01:47:10,063
Now, all that said, I think it's important to note that the key submission date.

646
01:47:10,083 --> 01:47:15,468
So right now, the purpose for this meeting is the initial submission of the educational plan.

647
01:47:17,070 --> 01:47:21,234
That will be next school committee meeting on February 2nd.

648
01:47:22,495 --> 01:47:31,701
That allows this to go for some draft revisions and then February 25th.

649
01:47:32,341 --> 01:47:42,387
The final submission after those revisions as part of MSBA will be at the end of June, as you see here, June 25th.

650
01:47:44,462 --> 01:47:46,402
So right now, this is the initial submission.

651
01:47:47,143 --> 01:47:48,123
You can go to the next slide.

652
01:47:48,163 --> 01:47:48,563
Thank you.

653
01:47:49,483 --> 01:48:02,966
This slide, I think, is really important for you to see the intersection of how the educational plan, which we are here for tonight, informs the educational program and vice versa.

654
01:48:03,566 --> 01:48:10,068
It really reflects the iterative process that this is in developing an educational plan.

655
01:48:10,828 --> 01:48:26,857
And so it really also mirrors intentionally how we approach things here too within the district, which is with collaboration, with reflection, and with refinement over time when we're getting stakeholder input.

656
01:48:27,277 --> 01:48:32,800
So you can see that the educational plan, as I've previously stated, the why and the how,

657
01:48:34,094 --> 01:48:39,641
That is going to inform the educational program, which really talks about what those spaces should be.

658
01:48:40,121 --> 01:48:44,006
And you can see how they talk to one another on this slide.

659
01:48:44,607 --> 01:48:51,395
Both of those documents are going to inform the overall building size and design.

660
01:48:54,571 --> 01:48:55,012
Thank you.

661
01:48:55,974 --> 01:49:02,528
And so in this slide, tonight, we're here and we're going to speak about three phases of the process.

662
01:49:05,210 --> 01:49:08,231
I am going to, I have kind of covered the beginning phase.

663
01:49:08,671 --> 01:49:16,695
I'm going to speak about phase one here, and then I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Talbot to talk about phase two and phase three.

664
01:49:17,355 --> 01:49:23,317
So phase one of the educational plan was everything we started before SMMA came on.

665
01:49:24,257 --> 01:49:29,199
So you can see here with this timeline, left field joined us.

666
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:36,501
during our administrative retreats last June 2025.

667
01:49:37,501 --> 01:49:41,002
And that's when they laid out what the scope of this work is.

668
01:49:41,422 --> 01:49:53,125
They introduced the educational plan work to our administrative team and our directors who worked on the initial draft of compiling

669
01:49:54,603 --> 01:50:09,642
what instructional practices and education looks like now and what we hope for it to be and what we are working for it to be and so that was initially done in June and then

670
01:50:10,993 --> 01:50:17,899
July, August, and September, directors worked on that with their teams and their teachers.

671
01:50:18,639 --> 01:50:30,029
In order to help build some of that context that is just helpful in building and developing an educational plan, Left Field also helped us

672
01:50:33,243 --> 01:50:39,848
I'm sorry, blanking on the words, schedule building tours of other newly built high schools.

673
01:50:40,549 --> 01:50:43,511
And we had a bunch of them scheduled throughout the summer.

674
01:50:43,851 --> 01:51:02,325
We had administrators, we had some teachers join us so that they were able to tour high schools, get an understanding for what is possible and where we can dream and what matches our current context and where we've been working through our professional development to get.

675
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:09,843
All of that knowledge and work from the summer came in at the beginning of the school year.

676
01:51:09,963 --> 01:51:27,954
And the first two months of school was directors working with teachers in their specific departments around developing this educational plan for what it is now and what we want it to be.

677
01:51:27,974 --> 01:51:30,536
And all of that feedback

678
01:51:34,215 --> 01:51:36,237
went into the development of that plan.

679
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:50,733
Then around November, October, SMMA came in and we moved into phase two and phase three of the development of the educational plan.

680
01:51:51,273 --> 01:51:55,578
And Dr. Talbot is going to lead us through phase two and phase three.

681
01:52:00,061 --> 01:52:13,486
So in phase two, we are so grateful to working with SMMA on the visioning process because they led us through a rigorous 48 hours worth of visioning across a variety of stakeholders.

682
01:52:14,866 --> 01:52:16,187
And we really appreciate their work.

683
01:52:17,370 --> 01:52:20,373
So we had 60 department program meetings.

684
01:52:21,134 --> 01:52:22,976
We engaged in a student shadow day.

685
01:52:23,056 --> 01:52:25,699
There were four educational leadership team meetings.

686
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:31,305
There were three building tours, two visioning days with staff and students.

687
01:52:31,785 --> 01:52:36,931
And I want to underscore again, you can see in some of these pictures, the collaborative nature of our work together.

688
01:52:36,971 --> 01:52:37,792
There were students,

689
01:52:39,237 --> 01:52:48,780
teachers, administrators, and central office administrators working together to imagine what the future of Medford High School could be.

690
01:52:50,240 --> 01:52:50,700
Slide, Will.

691
01:52:54,402 --> 01:53:05,785
So here are some scenes of the different kinds of ways that SMMA engaged our team in designing a Medford High School that was gonna meet the needs of our students.

692
01:53:07,567 --> 01:53:15,872
We started with a shadow day in November, and I have to say this for me was one of the most professionally rewarding experiences.

693
01:53:16,453 --> 01:53:22,677
My team followed Emily, you can see her pictured in the center picture here, and we followed her through three periods of the day.

694
01:53:23,858 --> 01:53:26,700
There were multiple teams following students from arrival,

695
01:53:27,628 --> 01:53:39,315
through their days, navigating the cafeteria for lunch to really get a sense for what education is at Medford High School currently and how the building supports it.

696
01:53:41,116 --> 01:53:52,803
And we were really excited to hear about the students in our debrief about what they felt the barriers were from the building and from instruction for helping them to thrive.

697
01:53:55,528 --> 01:53:59,390
SMMA also engaged our ed leadership team in school tours.

698
01:54:00,070 --> 01:54:06,794
We visited three schools in one day of new construction, not all high school, but all of them were comprehensive schools.

699
01:54:07,894 --> 01:54:17,239
The purpose of these tours was to help our teams dream as to how space could really help students unlock their potential.

700
01:54:17,259 --> 01:54:21,841
And we saw some things that we loved, and we saw some things that gave us pause.

701
01:54:24,402 --> 01:54:27,803
Our visioning team met on two full days.

702
01:54:28,203 --> 01:54:39,027
You can see us here pictured with post-it notes, and standing up, and markers, and building with blocks, and filling in squares, and really elevating the voices of our students.

703
01:54:40,307 --> 01:54:47,590
These visioning sessions also included community members, members of the building committee, and members of school committee.

704
01:54:48,834 --> 01:55:08,582
It should be noted that Marta Cabral, the principal of the high school, took great care in ensuring that all staff were invited into this process, whether in the tours or the ed visioning sessions or the educational leadership sessions, so that everybody's voice could be seen and elevated.

705
01:55:08,602 --> 01:55:11,063
Slide, please.

706
01:55:14,295 --> 01:55:34,824
So through that exhaustive work, 48 hours we counted, so through that exhaustive work and looking at the strong foundation that the department directors had set in their initial draft of the educational plan, we came to the vision that a comprehensive, integrated high school where academics,

707
01:55:36,053 --> 01:55:48,861
CTE learning and accessibility flourish to support multiple pathways and identities within a school community is the future that we wanted for the city of Medford and for Medford High School.

708
01:55:50,882 --> 01:56:03,090
Through those visioning sessions, our partners at SMMA helped us to elevate these six goals here, which you will see woven throughout the 60-page ed plan that's attached.

709
01:56:05,993 --> 01:56:31,972
Our goals for the future are to create a school where every student, educator, and family feel seen, valued, and belongs, to create a welcome and accessible community hub that supports learning, engagement, and connection during and beyond the school day, where learning experiences that are purposeful, relevant, rigorous, joyful, and connected to the real world happen every day.

710
01:56:33,695 --> 01:56:43,680
to create a building that is flexible, purposeful, and human-centered with spaces that support collaboration, movement, and multiple modes of teaching and learning.

711
01:56:44,420 --> 01:56:47,822
We're developing a building today that's going to last us for 30 years.

712
01:56:47,882 --> 01:56:50,503
And so we know we need to be flexible.

713
01:56:53,364 --> 01:56:59,907
Most of all, we want to create a space that centers student voice and agency and leadership.

714
01:57:00,688 --> 01:57:07,331
And there was no more rewarding moments in all of those 48 hours of work together where students stood up and spoke their truth.

715
01:57:08,072 --> 01:57:18,637
The rooms weren't silent listening to what they had to say and taking to heart their thoughtful considerations for what they wanted the students who come behind them to experience.

716
01:57:20,307 --> 01:57:29,913
And finally, we want a future ready building that is adaptable, sustainable, and able to evolve with the changing student needs and educational practices.

717
01:57:31,114 --> 01:57:37,939
You can find, by the way, the full version of this report on the building project website under phase three.

718
01:57:38,819 --> 01:57:48,526
The full version of the report has all of those beautiful charts and prioritization work that we did together is all laid out as well as these goals.

719
01:57:53,433 --> 01:57:57,415
So here's what you'll see in this version of our Medford educational plan.

720
01:57:57,916 --> 01:58:07,941
As a reminder, this plan serves as a reflection of the current way of instruction and envisions a mode of instruction that students really deserve.

721
01:58:09,022 --> 01:58:17,187
So in this plan, we've imagined several enhancements to programming over the next couple of decades.

722
01:58:18,067 --> 01:58:22,290
And we're focused on designing a building where these changes are possible.

723
01:58:24,435 --> 01:58:30,059
So on this slide, what you see is a table of contents for the education plan.

724
01:58:30,639 --> 01:58:41,487
While it is not a cookie cutter mold, it is the format that the MSBA needs to see what our vision is, our current practice, and future practice.

725
01:58:42,227 --> 01:58:45,790
So this is the table of contents of what you'll find in the report.

726
01:58:47,470 --> 01:58:56,194
It's lengthy, so we'll call out a few key enhancements that you might want to be on the look for as they connect with the six goals that I said on the previous slide.

727
01:58:58,175 --> 01:59:02,516
You'll want to be on the lookout for key enhancements to instructional practices.

728
01:59:03,737 --> 01:59:08,239
Instructional shifts that elevate student collaboration and agency,

729
01:59:09,114 --> 01:59:18,342
This, by the way, as a note to our prior presentation, is also a way to build trust between students and adults in the building.

730
01:59:18,922 --> 01:59:25,028
Doing the work through the work, working together on complex real-world problems, that's the instruction that our students deserve.

731
01:59:26,799 --> 01:59:35,501
Other key enhancements to instructional practices are flexible and intentional use of learning spaces for both students and staff.

732
01:59:35,521 --> 01:59:41,362
We recognize this is going to represent a change in how our community approaches teaching and learning.

733
01:59:42,102 --> 01:59:50,124
And also the expansion of CTE programming, something that we were all excited about in every meeting, every stakeholder in that space.

734
01:59:52,848 --> 01:59:57,011
You'll also notice in this document some key enhancements to instructional operations.

735
01:59:57,712 --> 02:00:04,397
You'll see a thoughtful integration of specialized programming throughout the building, both in space and in concept.

736
02:00:05,498 --> 02:00:07,860
You'll see the integration of CTE programming.

737
02:00:08,801 --> 02:00:23,953
When you look through the visioning report and you see grown adults stacking colored blocks to show where the adjacencies could be of CTE programming and arts programming to elevate the experience of all of our students, I think you'll find it quite insightful.

738
02:00:26,014 --> 02:00:30,198
Other key enhancements to instructional operations you'll find in this document

739
02:00:31,234 --> 02:00:38,763
is the plan to co-locate Curtis Tufts on this campus, bringing all of our nine through 12 students together in the same community.

740
02:00:38,783 --> 02:00:42,988
An expanded use and imagination of the library and media center.

741
02:00:44,429 --> 02:00:51,778
And as Dr. Galluzzi pointed out earlier, a centralized space for early childhood to grow and thrive.

742
02:01:00,618 --> 02:01:03,041
Thank you so much, Dr. Talbot.

743
02:01:03,582 --> 02:01:12,415
So I think at this time, we would love to field any questions that anybody may have about the educational plan.

744
02:01:26,612 --> 02:01:37,678
We also know it is up for discussion at the next school committee meeting and there'll be an opportunity for questions and comments at that time as well.

745
02:01:37,698 --> 02:01:45,723
I would also like to just initially call out, I'm glad we have our

746
02:01:47,307 --> 02:01:52,849
left field and SMMA have turned their cameras on so you can see them here and they've joined the meeting.

747
02:01:52,949 --> 02:02:05,553
I also do want to call out a lot of this work in the visioning sessions was also led by their educational consultant, Mike Parolo, who worked with us really on the

748
02:02:08,167 --> 02:02:30,322
The report that Dr. Talbot spoke about that you can find on the website under phase three was written and compiled by Mike and his partner and really kind of digs down into the work and the data that was revealed through all of the visioning sessions throughout this phase.

749
02:02:32,180 --> 02:02:38,086
Yes, and before I turn it over to Member Graham, I just want to thank you, Dr. Galussi and Dr. Talbot for the presentation.

750
02:02:38,106 --> 02:02:47,154
Thank SMMA and left field for running more meetings than I could even keep up with.

751
02:02:47,174 --> 02:02:56,003
So between the whole school staff and everybody that attended those meetings, it was a lot crammed into a short amount of time because I know we really want to

752
02:02:56,423 --> 02:02:58,707
move this high school forward as fast as we can.

753
02:02:58,727 --> 02:03:03,534
And thank you again to Councilors Leming and Mullane who joined us this evening.

754
02:03:03,634 --> 02:03:09,323
So thank you to everybody involved in getting this hard work done in such a short amount of time.

755
02:03:09,343 --> 02:03:11,046
Member Graham.

756
02:03:14,828 --> 02:03:15,368
Thank you.

757
02:03:16,549 --> 02:03:18,190
Thanks for the presentation.

758
02:03:18,210 --> 02:03:20,571
I just had one procedural question.

759
02:03:20,731 --> 02:03:29,795
If people have, as they're reviewing, if they have questions and comments, do you want them to send those questions and comments to you ahead of time?

760
02:03:30,135 --> 02:03:34,678
Because the expectation, what we need to do next week is,

761
02:03:35,858 --> 02:03:42,102
Provide a vote of approval that can be shared with the building committee and ultimately with.

762
02:03:42,822 --> 02:03:45,924
The, so I just wanted to.

763
02:03:46,864 --> 02:03:55,729
Sort of highlight that and talk a little bit about how you want it to handle questions and any editing that's going to go on between now and then.

764
02:03:57,069 --> 02:03:59,331
No, I think that's a very great question.

765
02:03:59,351 --> 02:04:00,051
Thank you very much.

766
02:04:00,271 --> 02:04:03,853
I would say that people can reach out to Dr. Talbot or myself.

767
02:04:06,275 --> 02:04:22,306
And I would probably say since this does have to be turned around for the next school committee meeting next Monday, we would appreciate comments probably by Thursday, which gives us ample time to respond.

768
02:04:25,748 --> 02:04:26,008
Thank you.

769
02:04:30,971 --> 02:04:31,832
Great.

770
02:04:32,052 --> 02:04:32,832
Member Mastroboni.

771
02:04:34,173 --> 02:04:34,433
Thank you.

772
02:04:34,493 --> 02:04:35,634
And thank you for the presentation.

773
02:04:35,654 --> 02:04:37,395
And thanks to the whole team for putting this together.

774
02:04:37,415 --> 02:04:38,856
It's a really big document.

775
02:04:38,936 --> 02:04:41,638
So I have two questions.

776
02:04:41,718 --> 02:04:48,443
The first is, is the solution to creating this ed plan building a high school?

777
02:04:48,543 --> 02:04:56,588
Or are there other things that we would want to be considering along with building a high school to implement this ed plan?

778
02:04:56,608 --> 02:04:58,009
Are there policy pieces there?

779
02:05:01,207 --> 02:05:02,008
And that's the first question.

780
02:05:04,129 --> 02:05:05,330
That's such a great question.

781
02:05:05,850 --> 02:05:11,894
So our SMMA consultant, Mike, brought that up at every single meeting.

782
02:05:11,954 --> 02:05:17,658
Do not wait for 2030 to implement these visionary practices that you see start right away.

783
02:05:17,678 --> 02:05:19,899
And that is something that we're excited to do.

784
02:05:20,259 --> 02:05:22,241
So thank you for that question, member Mastroboni.

785
02:05:24,582 --> 02:05:29,027
co-location, moving classrooms around, that is going to have to wait for the new building.

786
02:05:29,087 --> 02:05:31,269
But the instructional practices, we can start right away.

787
02:05:31,309 --> 02:05:33,091
We heard our students loud and clear.

788
02:05:33,111 --> 02:05:33,952
They want agency.

789
02:05:34,512 --> 02:05:35,133
They want choice.

790
02:05:35,153 --> 02:05:36,454
They want to take leadership roles.

791
02:05:36,995 --> 02:05:41,439
And we need to respond to that by designing instruction that fits their needs.

792
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:43,561
So some yes and some no.

793
02:05:45,223 --> 02:05:46,044
That makes sense to me.

794
02:05:46,204 --> 02:05:47,145
And I think

795
02:05:48,475 --> 02:05:58,840
to the extent, you know, we'll be reading through this, but really highlighting that these are the things that we're gonna go forward with immediately that we've identified will be really helpful in, you know, the next year while we wait for the school.

796
02:05:59,620 --> 02:06:01,681
The second question is, it's a long document.

797
02:06:02,281 --> 02:06:08,684
I'm thinking about from the perspective of a member of the public, like how would you read this document?

798
02:06:09,245 --> 02:06:10,365
It's got 20 sections.

799
02:06:10,585 --> 02:06:14,207
If I've got time for a few, like are there really key pieces here

800
02:06:14,667 --> 02:06:19,414
that can't be missed, and you're not allowed to say the whole document, which I think would be fair.

801
02:06:22,525 --> 02:06:27,487
I would say, I'll start first, Suzanne, and then maybe you could pop in to clean up.

802
02:06:28,708 --> 02:06:36,151
So I'm gonna say in this very messy way that 60 pages is a lot for anyone to read, but everybody in Medford is passionate about something.

803
02:06:36,651 --> 02:06:40,613
So I would say approach that document with the section that you're passionate about.

804
02:06:40,653 --> 02:06:44,074
If you are passionate about school counseling and mental health, start there.

805
02:06:44,214 --> 02:06:46,275
If lunch is your thing, start there.

806
02:06:46,335 --> 02:06:48,256
If it really matters to you about the arts,

807
02:06:49,372 --> 02:06:55,294
EE academics, which is where I would start, that is where you should start so that you don't run out of steam on the way through.

808
02:06:55,314 --> 02:07:03,977
I would look for places where you can feel inspired by what the students and faculty are saying about what they'd like to see instruction look like.

809
02:07:04,597 --> 02:07:14,580
And I would urge you to not get lost in the weeds of the document, because I think that could really kind of pull you under and make it not as joyful as the process was.

810
02:07:16,026 --> 02:07:16,767
What am I missing there.

811
02:07:17,147 --> 02:07:18,809
No, I think you absolutely nailed it.

812
02:07:19,670 --> 02:07:25,297
I was pretty much going to say the same thing as well as just expand upon your first question.

813
02:07:28,340 --> 02:07:36,903
There are pieces of what we're already doing now and not waiting for the new high school build woven into many different departments.

814
02:07:36,943 --> 02:07:38,984
I mean, CTE is another example.

815
02:07:39,444 --> 02:07:41,385
So some programs are starting now.

816
02:07:41,845 --> 02:07:45,086
Some, because of space constraints, have to wait for the new build.

817
02:07:47,627 --> 02:07:50,269
I wouldn't want to limit someone to those things.

818
02:07:50,850 --> 02:08:10,387
We did try to highlight that above and beyond the academic components or maybe some of the space components of this high school, there are some of the things that we're trying to do, which is like co-locate Curtis Tufts up here, our therapeutic day high school, as well as creating an early childhood center.

819
02:08:10,487 --> 02:08:10,707
So

820
02:08:11,668 --> 02:08:20,672
Those are some of the two big items, as well as maintain our Welcome Center and our Parent Information Center for families.

821
02:08:22,352 --> 02:08:24,573
But I really think Dr. Talbot nailed the advice.

822
02:08:24,593 --> 02:08:28,315
Thanks so much.

823
02:08:28,335 --> 02:08:29,275
That's really helpful, I think.

824
02:08:29,796 --> 02:08:30,536
I appreciate it.

825
02:08:33,337 --> 02:08:33,757
Thank you.

826
02:08:33,877 --> 02:08:34,518
Member Reinfeld?

827
02:08:39,600 --> 02:08:40,040
There we go.

828
02:08:42,338 --> 02:08:53,606
I was, what level of feedback questions are you looking for in terms of, like, I did find a typo probably because I haven't been staring this forever.

829
02:08:54,046 --> 02:08:55,627
So do you want that kind of level?

830
02:08:55,647 --> 02:09:00,530
Do you, are the goals set and there's no room to tweak those?

831
02:09:03,752 --> 02:09:06,014
What level of feedback are you wanting for the next,

832
02:09:07,046 --> 02:09:16,215
meeting and is that on the document itself or on the plan in general and how that will play out in this process.

833
02:09:18,356 --> 02:09:20,138
So let's do the reverse Dr. Talbot.

834
02:09:20,498 --> 02:09:21,960
I'll start and then you can clean up.

835
02:09:23,761 --> 02:09:24,983
So I would say

836
02:09:26,867 --> 02:09:34,214
Any and all, we're always open to feedback from typos to larger ideas and concepts.

837
02:09:34,975 --> 02:09:39,439
The only thing that I would like be mindful of is that, as stated through this presentation,

838
02:09:40,299 --> 02:09:41,740
It's an iterative process.

839
02:09:41,800 --> 02:09:42,760
This is draft one.

840
02:09:43,260 --> 02:09:49,322
So we do want to inform the future and soon final draft of this document.

841
02:09:49,382 --> 02:09:51,683
So we do want to hear your feedback.

842
02:09:53,183 --> 02:09:57,885
But also, too, this is a plan that was created by various stakeholders.

843
02:09:57,945 --> 02:10:03,207
So we want your feedback, but we also don't want to minimize the work.

844
02:10:03,975 --> 02:10:09,456
and the input that went into the writing of this plan, if that makes sense.

845
02:10:09,956 --> 02:10:10,697
That makes sense.

846
02:10:10,797 --> 02:10:16,418
And I will say, I really appreciate all the work and all the people who contributed to this.

847
02:10:16,578 --> 02:10:17,198
And I see that.

848
02:10:17,218 --> 02:10:24,160
And I see opportunities to take a lot of this and expand it out as we do our strategic planning work, which is already underway.

849
02:10:24,600 --> 02:10:26,280
So I am seeing that as well.

850
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:33,562
But I just kind of wanted to clarify what the expectation was and how people could expect to see any feedback.

851
02:10:34,462 --> 02:10:36,104
No, we appreciate that very much.

852
02:10:36,144 --> 02:10:36,504
Thank you.

853
02:10:37,485 --> 02:10:37,845
Thank you.

854
02:10:41,307 --> 02:10:41,527
Great.

855
02:10:41,908 --> 02:10:42,568
Thank you so much.

856
02:10:43,409 --> 02:10:43,769
Thank you.

857
02:10:44,309 --> 02:10:45,150
So next week, a vote.

858
02:10:47,292 --> 02:10:50,033
Much appreciate the presentation.

859
02:10:54,857 --> 02:11:01,622
Next, we don't have any presentations, but we do have continued business.

860
02:11:01,682 --> 02:11:03,183
So I'll move on to continued business.

861
02:11:04,240 --> 02:11:07,604
A interim superintendents evaluation and goals feedback.

862
02:11:12,570 --> 02:11:13,672
That over.

863
02:11:17,537 --> 02:11:18,898
Mayor, I'm gonna, I'm gonna take this.

864
02:11:21,145 --> 02:11:21,545
Thank you.

865
02:11:21,785 --> 02:11:27,870
So this is going to be a very dense conversation, but I'm going to ask everyone to bear with me, please.

866
02:11:29,191 --> 02:11:33,154
So we've been discussing the superintendent eval for a couple of weeks now.

867
02:11:34,515 --> 02:11:39,879
Intern superintendent Lucy submitted her self-evaluation before the end of the calendar year.

868
02:11:40,019 --> 02:11:43,982
We had a school committee meeting that incorporated that into our discussion.

869
02:11:44,803 --> 02:11:49,086
And then from that, we were then able to put together our school committee member

870
02:11:50,107 --> 02:11:54,614
evals individually and then we were to combine them all into what we're going to be looking at tonight.

871
02:11:55,655 --> 02:12:02,184
So a couple clarifying points, and then we're going to have it cast on the screen so we can kind of go each by point by point.

872
02:12:04,868 --> 02:12:17,018
What is the standard for school committees in public districts is that on an annual basis, you will put together a set of goals that the district will be working towards.

873
02:12:17,579 --> 02:12:28,308
The school committee will work in tandem with the superintendent of that district and their senior staff and their central administration to kind of figure out what is best for both sides.

874
02:12:28,649 --> 02:12:30,870
The school committee's responsibility is to make sure that those things

875
02:12:31,891 --> 02:12:41,399
align with the state standards, and then what is the general strategic plan of the district, and the superintendent is then tasked with implementing those on a daily basis and then quarterly.

876
02:12:42,941 --> 02:12:57,813
Given the nature of the intern superintendent's position, we recognize that it'd be a bit difficult to put together that annual goal-setting explicit description because she came in in January of 25, and so in October,

877
02:13:01,267 --> 02:13:10,312
or in September of 25, we acknowledged that we did not put together a comprehensive description of those goals, at least in explicit nature.

878
02:13:10,713 --> 02:13:28,103
But in January, at the entry point, the superintendent put together a slide deck that discussed what types of things that she had been noticing prior to her interim position, and then what she wanted to work towards going forward for the remainder of that academic year, and then the one we're in currently.

879
02:13:29,304 --> 02:13:36,871
In October, we were able to discuss that, and she gave her finding slide deck to us, and we were able to discuss that.

880
02:13:37,452 --> 02:13:39,454
I believe the meeting was October.

881
02:13:39,474 --> 02:13:41,075
Let me just pull this up.

882
02:13:45,860 --> 02:13:46,621
At some point in October.

883
02:13:46,641 --> 02:13:47,842
I don't have the exact dates in front of me.

884
02:13:48,342 --> 02:13:52,466
I have a bunch of notes in front of me, so please bear with me as I look at all of them as we kind of go through.

885
02:13:54,414 --> 02:14:02,041
Each goal that the superintendent discussed in September and that we then discussed further in October is considered what's called a SMART goal.

886
02:14:03,202 --> 02:14:13,291
That is what DESE recommends as best practice when we discuss discernible goals that any person can look through and understand where the district is working towards.

887
02:14:13,751 --> 02:14:20,137
SMART stands for, the S is specific and strategic, M is measurable, A is action oriented,

888
02:14:20,937 --> 02:14:25,618
R is rigorous, realistic, and results focused, and T is timed and tracked.

889
02:14:26,099 --> 02:14:31,320
So again, that's what we use in our district and what is kind of the standard according to DESE.

890
02:14:31,860 --> 02:14:42,003
So we understand what goals are being implemented, what's the pursuit of them, the timetable for them to be achieved, and the review process that we'll be using ideally to understand if they've been achieved.

891
02:14:42,163 --> 02:14:47,705
If they haven't been achieved, for example, is there notable or is there measurable work towards those goals?

892
02:14:48,925 --> 02:14:58,451
Realistically, most goals that are set at any given time, especially district-wide goals, are not going to always be achieved in any one academic year because they're district-wide goals.

893
02:14:59,192 --> 02:15:03,874
But we want to see those notable goals being pursued over time.

894
02:15:03,934 --> 02:15:08,457
And we use that SMART goal framework to understand how they're being achieved over time.

895
02:15:10,811 --> 02:15:12,033
A couple other clarifying things.

896
02:15:13,234 --> 02:15:21,321
The evaluation that we use as a school committee members is again, we use the general framework that DESE recommends, so it's not vastly different.

897
02:15:21,361 --> 02:15:27,827
We do use Medford specific goals in a Medford framework, but we follow the general guidelines that DESE recommends.

898
02:15:28,668 --> 02:15:43,362
After the superintendent in December submitted her self-eval, I then worked to compile all the information necessary, clarify as general as possible and explicit as possible what those goals were going to look like.

899
02:15:43,522 --> 02:15:51,029
Again, being clear that we did not set explicit district-wide goals in the same timeline that you would

900
02:15:51,630 --> 02:15:56,243
in an annual year when there isn't professional shifting in the superintendent's role.

901
02:15:56,584 --> 02:15:59,452
But because of how our interim came in, it's a little bit different.

902
02:16:01,056 --> 02:16:05,000
I then sent out self evals or evals to each member.

903
02:16:05,981 --> 02:16:08,623
They then had about two weeks or so to fill them out.

904
02:16:08,703 --> 02:16:14,969
So a little bit post the holidays up until the 18th of January to fill them out.

905
02:16:15,689 --> 02:16:19,613
No committee member was able to look at any other committee members evals.

906
02:16:19,833 --> 02:16:21,234
I was the only one that was able to see them.

907
02:16:21,574 --> 02:16:22,996
So for clarifying information.

908
02:16:24,617 --> 02:16:42,643
Committee members were allowed to communicate with the superintendent at any given time during their evaluation period if they needed to get some information or any slide decks, for example, if they have clarifying questions, or if they felt as though they were not informed properly on any one section or subsection of the evaluation.

909
02:16:43,383 --> 02:16:48,284
They were also allowed to communicate with one other school committee member if needed.

910
02:16:48,904 --> 02:16:55,006
I recommended, and Desi does as well, that you try your best to not interact with other school committee members because of open meeting laws.

911
02:16:55,526 --> 02:16:58,647
So I don't, to my knowledge, no one has done that.

912
02:16:59,467 --> 02:17:05,948
They can communicate with me about clarifying questions about the evaluation or how they're supposed to fill it out, which happened more than once.

913
02:17:06,648 --> 02:17:12,410
But again, no committee member, to my knowledge, has communicated with anybody else other than maybe the superintendent or me specifically about

914
02:17:14,151 --> 02:17:14,731
the protocol.

915
02:17:15,692 --> 02:17:16,293
That's the first thing.

916
02:17:16,493 --> 02:17:20,957
The second thing is that all the evaluations are still unavailable to each other.

917
02:17:20,977 --> 02:17:26,783
I'm the only one that's seen them, but we're going to see what the combined school committee evals are going to look like in a moment.

918
02:17:27,964 --> 02:17:37,413
What's happened is that after each committee member filled out their eval, I then went in, I took their reported ratings, put them into the eval, and then took their feedback

919
02:17:38,053 --> 02:17:47,543
synthesize them with everybody else's responses for that respective section or subsection and you'll see that on the on the public email in a moment.

920
02:17:48,905 --> 02:17:54,331
It's important to note that I in no way change the wording other than synthesizing them but I did not

921
02:17:56,576 --> 02:18:00,237
added any additional embellishment or emboldening of any one perspective.

922
02:18:00,597 --> 02:18:09,179
It's not going to be clear who said what with these evaluations because they've been combined and synthesized to be a little more narrative driven.

923
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:17,322
The language is going to be somewhat the same because DESI recommends you do that for just general professionalism and posterity so it's clear.

924
02:18:18,202 --> 02:18:21,403
And the criteria that we're using is going to be clear for everyone so that

925
02:18:22,244 --> 02:18:26,551
the public and the school committee members as well understand that we're all using the same criteria.

926
02:18:26,791 --> 02:18:32,801
So the subjectivity of how you read the question is your own, but everyone has the same understanding about what we're basing our ratings on.

927
02:18:32,821 --> 02:18:34,343
Does that make sense so far?

928
02:18:36,361 --> 02:18:36,621
Sweet.

929
02:18:36,761 --> 02:18:37,021
All right.

930
02:18:37,201 --> 02:18:37,801
I'm talking a lot.

931
02:18:37,821 --> 02:18:38,622
We're going to keep going.

932
02:18:39,342 --> 02:18:51,365
A couple of other really important things to understand is that committee members were given a handful of links and references PDFs for consideration so they can kind of have the most formal understanding possible.

933
02:18:51,785 --> 02:18:56,327
So we had a couple of things from the State Department about evaluating educators and superintendents.

934
02:18:56,627 --> 02:19:01,508
The evaluation that the superintendent uses is similar to what teachers and professional staff use.

935
02:19:01,908 --> 02:19:03,069
So you're going to see some of that.

936
02:19:04,309 --> 02:19:14,157
We have a general rubric that is used across the state that they were provided that, and they were also provided a general idea about what it will look like with a filled out evaluation.

937
02:19:14,197 --> 02:19:15,878
So they had a general idea about how it should look.

938
02:19:17,639 --> 02:19:27,507
The other important thing to note is that committee members who decided to give a rating other than proficient, so there's two scales we use for our superintendent.

939
02:19:27,527 --> 02:19:30,229
There's a scale of one to five and a scale of one to four.

940
02:19:30,909 --> 02:19:32,510
In the example of the one to five scale,

941
02:19:33,970 --> 02:19:35,531
4 is your proficient.

942
02:19:36,291 --> 02:19:43,433
Anything above or below that, so 1 through 3 or 5, you were asked or expected to give feedback.

943
02:19:44,033 --> 02:19:48,514
If you give a proficient score of 4 on that 1 to 5 scale, no feedback is required.

944
02:19:48,674 --> 02:19:50,715
It's allowed, but there's no requirement.

945
02:19:51,155 --> 02:19:53,916
For the scale of 1 to 4, 3 is proficient.

946
02:19:54,216 --> 02:19:55,776
Again, 1 to 2 or 4 of that 1 to 4 rating,

947
02:19:58,097 --> 02:20:00,919
you're asked to give feedback.

948
02:20:01,239 --> 02:20:05,841
But three on that scale is proficient, which means you don't need to add feedback.

949
02:20:06,101 --> 02:20:16,367
If a member chose not to add feedback because they gave that proficient score, their consideration or their opinion was not added into that synthesized feedback section because I got no feedback from them.

950
02:20:16,587 --> 02:20:19,729
Again, they weren't required to do that, but they could if they so chose.

951
02:20:21,063 --> 02:20:23,545
Some members decided to add feedback, some members didn't.

952
02:20:23,785 --> 02:20:30,771
That's not going to be, again, I don't clarify who said what, so there's no specific expectation of that.

953
02:20:30,931 --> 02:20:40,799
But that's important to understand that this feedback is the combination and synthesization of certain members who added feedback for those respective sections, not everyone's necessarily.

954
02:20:43,221 --> 02:20:48,786
Okay, can we have that please on the screen and I'll kind of keep adding things as we go.

955
02:20:52,900 --> 02:21:00,916
Member Olopade, did you clarify for anyone watching that this incorporates feedback from people who are not currently on the school committee but had

956
02:21:02,323 --> 02:21:04,605
Yes, thank you, I really appreciate that clarification.

957
02:21:04,865 --> 02:21:15,133
Yes, this was member, former member John Atapa and former member Nicole Branley were asked to give their respective evaluations.

958
02:21:16,094 --> 02:21:24,040
Given the fact that our current members, member Mastroboni and member Parks were not participating in the district at the time, we didn't ask them to fill this out.

959
02:21:24,080 --> 02:21:29,404
This is from the former six from the previous term of school community members were asked to fill this out.

960
02:21:29,484 --> 02:21:30,985
So again, we're gonna see some of the,

961
02:21:32,286 --> 02:21:35,731
the feedback from those former members in the feedback form.

962
02:21:38,335 --> 02:21:41,540
And let me just pull up so I have this so it's clear for everybody.

963
02:21:45,867 --> 02:21:47,029
So as I mentioned,

964
02:21:48,473 --> 02:21:50,737
We're on a scale of one to five for the first section.

965
02:21:50,777 --> 02:21:52,740
This is a superintendent performance goals.

966
02:21:53,160 --> 02:22:01,674
These are the goals that generally we as a district would work together with the superintendent's office to put together and make explicitly clear what they were.

967
02:22:02,593 --> 02:22:05,895
As I mentioned, given the nature of the appointment, we didn't do that.

968
02:22:06,135 --> 02:22:13,199
But the superintendent did set aside a handful of goals that are relatively aligned with Desi's recommendations.

969
02:22:14,160 --> 02:22:16,622
So we were able to put together this evaluation.

970
02:22:17,322 --> 02:22:20,884
The first goal in front of us is the student learning goal.

971
02:22:24,246 --> 02:22:29,288
That generally is to establish high expectations for all students that promote critical thinking and problem solving.

972
02:22:29,769 --> 02:22:34,591
It aligns to grade level state standards and ensures that instruction meets to individual needs of students.

973
02:22:35,531 --> 02:22:38,473
I should also clarify that we use focus indicators.

974
02:22:38,933 --> 02:22:47,357
There's upwards of, I believe, 20 indicators that are used to kind of form our SMART goal framework, as I mentioned.

975
02:22:48,398 --> 02:22:52,860
Each district is allowed to specify what indicators they'd like to focus primarily on.

976
02:22:53,795 --> 02:23:00,739
Realistically you're not going to be able to use all 20 indicators for every goal because certain goals have certain expectations.

977
02:23:01,199 --> 02:23:02,440
We used six.

978
02:23:03,701 --> 02:23:05,402
We clarified in October.

979
02:23:06,347 --> 02:23:12,932
or September, I'm sorry, in September we clarified six to eight indicators we wanted to focus primarily on.

980
02:23:14,373 --> 02:23:20,837
Six of those eight, as I just mentioned, were used for the five goals that are going to be listed below.

981
02:23:21,338 --> 02:23:28,263
We didn't use two of them because they didn't necessarily align as easily with the goals that are set, and I want to make that clear.

982
02:23:29,103 --> 02:23:29,924
I had a question about that.

983
02:23:30,904 --> 02:23:37,207
So the first indicator that we're using for this goal right now is 1-B or instruction.

984
02:23:38,748 --> 02:23:49,974
The feedback reads, during a period of significant transition, including several months without a full academic leadership team, the superintendent maintained consistency in student experience and instructional expectations across the district.

985
02:23:50,715 --> 02:23:58,099
Educators and administrators were appropriately engaged in this work, resulting in the establishment of clear norms that supported stable and successful learning environments.

986
02:23:58,879 --> 02:24:04,060
Despite these changes, gaps in student outcomes were identified, along with concrete steps to begin addressing them.

987
02:24:04,620 --> 02:24:12,482
The recent hiring of a new assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction has brought renewed focus, expertise, and strategic direction to the district's academic work.

988
02:24:13,182 --> 02:24:26,025
With consistent practices and foundational conditions for learning now more firmly in place, and with both a full central leadership team and individual instructional leadership teams established, the district is well positioned to move forward.

989
02:24:26,858 --> 02:24:39,249
Moving ahead or going ahead there is a clear opportunity and expectation to prioritize more intentional personalization of learning to ensure instruction is consistently aligned to grade level standards while meeting the diverse needs of individual students.

990
02:24:40,669 --> 02:24:41,569
I'm gonna pause for a moment.

991
02:24:42,330 --> 02:24:50,553
The rating that's listed there was taken from the second tab on this sheet, which is the member ratings.

992
02:24:51,313 --> 02:24:54,354
They're just the aggregate of all seven members who gave ratings.

993
02:24:55,234 --> 02:24:57,275
Again, four is what's considered proficient.

994
02:24:57,715 --> 02:25:06,238
If a member or members used decimal points, so 3.5 or 4.5, for example, you're gonna see that with the rating that's allowed.

995
02:25:06,718 --> 02:25:07,679
Four is what we're,

996
02:25:08,599 --> 02:25:10,460
is the minimum, is that proficient number.

997
02:25:11,360 --> 02:25:14,281
Five is, of course, exemplary, what you want to work towards always.

998
02:25:15,722 --> 02:25:19,863
But anything under four is what we have to have a conversation about needs improvement or working towards.

999
02:25:20,763 --> 02:25:22,204
So that's why there's a 4.07.

1000
02:25:22,744 --> 02:25:27,806
I'm going to use the number to the left of the decimal point, and I'm not going to necessarily round up or round down.

1001
02:25:27,826 --> 02:25:30,847
I'm just going to try to use, or I'm going to round up or down just for the conversation.

1002
02:25:32,328 --> 02:25:33,308
So that's the first one.

1003
02:25:33,648 --> 02:25:34,008
Thank you.

1004
02:25:34,488 --> 02:25:35,349
The second goal.

1005
02:25:37,812 --> 02:25:39,973
This is considered the professional practice goal.

1006
02:25:41,393 --> 02:25:52,637
It reads, enhance understanding of district operations, collaboratively identify key priorities, and foster a culture of trust, transparency, and efficiency.

1007
02:25:53,997 --> 02:25:59,979
The focus indicator that we use for this one is 2-D, laws, ethics, and policies.

1008
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:01,980
And this one reads,

1009
02:26:03,373 --> 02:26:09,198
Throughout her tenure, the superintendent has demonstrated a strong and consistent commitment to transparent, accessible leadership.

1010
02:26:09,899 --> 02:26:17,505
She made it a clear priority to explain district processes and policies to families and the broader community, whether the matter at hand was complex or routine.

1011
02:26:18,186 --> 02:26:26,833
This approach reinforced a belief that transparency is not situational, but foundational, and helped build trust by ensuring stakeholders understood not only decisions, but the reasoning behind them.

1012
02:26:27,554 --> 02:26:36,241
In her day-to-day leadership, the superintendent was consistently prepared, able to respond thoughtfully to questions, and, when necessary, able to identify where additional information could be found.

1013
02:26:36,821 --> 02:26:44,567
She demonstrated an ability to anticipate questions and concerns, clearly communicate the context and impact of district actions, and follow through on commitments.

1014
02:26:45,247 --> 02:26:52,133
Importantly, she also modeled these expectations for staff, reinforcing a culture of accountability and follow-up across the organization.

1015
02:26:53,141 --> 02:26:56,805
This emphasis on trust and belonging extended beyond students who include district staff.

1016
02:26:57,345 --> 02:27:05,954
The superintendent received consistent positive feedback for her focus on relationship building, ensuring staff felt heard, respected, and meaningfully included in decisions that affected their work.

1017
02:27:06,554 --> 02:27:15,143
By fostering these conditions and engaging staff as partners, she built a leadership team capable of addressing operational challenges collaboratively and effectively.

1018
02:27:16,310 --> 02:27:25,000
Taken together, these practices strengthened understanding of district operations, promoted shared ownership of priorities, and advance a culture grounded in transparency, inclusion, and operational effectiveness.

1019
02:27:26,001 --> 02:27:28,384
So that's goal two, and that's the professional practice goal.

1020
02:27:30,186 --> 02:27:30,886
Goal three.

1021
02:27:32,263 --> 02:27:35,267
So those, and again, I want to pause for a moment.

1022
02:27:35,627 --> 02:27:41,855
So DESE's recommendation is that you have student learning goal, you have just one general one, and then you have your professional practice goal.

1023
02:27:42,076 --> 02:27:43,337
That's, again, a general one.

1024
02:27:43,698 --> 02:27:47,422
You then are allowed two to four district improvement goals.

1025
02:27:48,750 --> 02:27:50,812
We worked to about three or so.

1026
02:27:51,072 --> 02:28:06,283
Again, the framework that the superintendent used in her entry slide deck in January used that framework, but it wasn't explicitly communicated to the public, and we didn't work to kind of cultivate those with her office.

1027
02:28:06,743 --> 02:28:12,468
She set these based off of what she had already been working towards in her prior role during that academic year.

1028
02:28:13,228 --> 02:28:19,076
So district improvement goal number one is to continue and further the ongoing MSBA process.

1029
02:28:19,457 --> 02:28:21,239
We just had a very nice presentation about it.

1030
02:28:21,520 --> 02:28:23,162
So this is similar to what we've been talking about.

1031
02:28:23,723 --> 02:28:28,950
The indicator that we're using for this one is 4-E, which is shared vision.

1032
02:28:31,606 --> 02:28:44,111
And it reads the interim superintendent has demonstrated exceptional leadership and commitment in advancing the process, recognizing it not merely as facilities project, but as a rare and transforming opportunity to reimagine the future of public schools.

1033
02:28:44,831 --> 02:28:46,392
She's consistently approach the work as a.

1034
02:28:47,936 --> 02:28:55,942
as a springboard for meaningful system-wide change, challenging longstanding practices and helping the district alliance physical infrastructure with evolving educational goals.

1035
02:28:56,582 --> 02:29:04,147
Her ability to engage a wide range of stakeholders in developing a shared vision grounded in community values and best practices has been a defining strength of this process.

1036
02:29:05,468 --> 02:29:14,835
Throughout the MSBA journey, she has shown unwavering dedication, attending and actively participating in every MSBA meeting, arriving prepared, informed, and deeply engaged.

1037
02:29:15,532 --> 02:29:27,861
Committee members noted the extraordinary time commitment this work has required and her remarkable capacity to balance immediate district needs, supporting staff, students, and families, while simultaneously advancing a long-term vision for a stronger, more innovative school system.

1038
02:29:28,702 --> 02:29:36,568
Her leadership has been marked by clarity, transparency, and thoughtfulness in representing decisions, uncertainties, and next steps to both the school committee and the broader community.

1039
02:29:37,810 --> 02:29:40,711
Importantly, this work has already translated into tangible progress.

1040
02:29:41,271 --> 02:29:49,475
By working proactively with her team, the Interim Superintendent has accelerated implementation timelines, including the launch of new vocational programming years ahead of schedule.

1041
02:29:50,195 --> 02:30:04,461
Her energy, perseverance, and collaborative spirit have been instrumental in moving this complex process forward, and her role as a committed thought partner has helped ensure that the MSBA process serves not only as a building project, but as a catalyst for lasting educational improvement.

1042
02:30:05,634 --> 02:30:07,515
So again, that's district improvement goal number one.

1043
02:30:08,816 --> 02:30:22,603
Goal number two for the district improvement is contract negotiations, engage in negotiations with bargaining units to build collaborative relationships, address the interests and concerns of varying employee units within the district, and improve district operations and outcomes.

1044
02:30:23,824 --> 02:30:28,907
The focus indicator that we're using for this one is 2-B, HR management and development.

1045
02:30:30,948 --> 02:30:40,296
And it reads, Dr. Galussi has demonstrated strong, effective leadership in contract negotiations, marked by preparation, professionalism, and a clear commitment to collaborative labor relations.

1046
02:30:40,956 --> 02:30:46,341
Over multiple negotiation cycles, including all 10 bargaining units, I don't want to say 10, I should say 11, that's my mistake.

1047
02:30:47,061 --> 02:30:53,567
She's consistently brought a calm, steady presence and data-driven approach that has helped foster trust, productive dialogue, and timely outcomes.

1048
02:30:54,605 --> 02:31:06,372
Most notably, the district successfully negotiated one of the most significant teacher contracts in many years, introducing substantial changes to educator work while avoiding the escalation, work actions, and public conflict that have challenged many peer districts.

1049
02:31:07,472 --> 02:31:13,096
This represents a meaningful departure from prior negotiation cycles and reflects a healthier, more constructive labor environment.

1050
02:31:13,656 --> 02:31:16,758
Committee feedback reflects a healthier, more constructive labor environment.

1051
02:31:17,078 --> 02:31:17,378
Oh, sorry.

1052
02:31:17,658 --> 02:31:23,782
Committee feedback highlights Dr. Pelosi's deep knowledge of Medford Public Schools and its contracts, as well as her integral role on the negotiating team.

1053
02:31:24,733 --> 02:31:33,416
She approaches negotiations prepared and with an open mind, thoughtfully considering multiple perspectives and working to reconcile competing needs in service of the district goals.

1054
02:31:34,156 --> 02:31:46,220
Her willingness to move beyond past practices while remaining grounded in the principle that supporting educators ultimately supports students to strengthen both relationships and outcomes.

1055
02:31:47,464 --> 02:31:54,947
Additionally, her leadership has contributed to necessary and effective adjustments in staffing structures, improving clarity of roles, efficiency, and teamwork across the district.

1056
02:31:55,467 --> 02:32:03,250
Overall, Dr. Galluzzi's approach to contract negotiations has advanced district operations while reinforcing a collaborative culture focused on student success.

1057
02:32:05,713 --> 02:32:13,417
All right, the third district goal is, the description is continued relationship development and stakeholder communication.

1058
02:32:14,137 --> 02:32:18,739
And the focus indicator that we're using is 3-C communication.

1059
02:32:19,339 --> 02:32:23,261
Oh, there's two, 3-C is communication and then 3-A is engagement.

1060
02:32:24,602 --> 02:32:34,066
And it reads, over the course of this evaluation period, Dr. Galussi has demonstrated a strong intentional commitment to relationship building and transparent communication across the district.

1061
02:32:34,907 --> 02:32:45,370
Her listening sessions and on-site visits were widely viewed as successful and meaningful, helping to ensure continuity of district operations while strengthening trust with staff, families, and community members.

1062
02:32:45,970 --> 02:32:56,474
Through regular weekly and ad hoc memos, as well as the use of task forces, committees, and structured input opportunities, she's elevated the standard for two-way communication and stakeholder engagement.

1063
02:32:56,954 --> 02:33:00,295
Equally notable has been Dr. Galussi's leadership in moments of challenge.

1064
02:33:00,955 --> 02:33:07,113
Rather than deflecting responsibility, she has consistently modeled accountability, acknowledging when missteps occur, and taking ownership of solutions.

1065
02:33:08,050 --> 02:33:13,672
This willingness to accept responsibility and focus on improvement has fostered credibility and confidence in her leadership.

1066
02:33:14,552 --> 02:33:30,898
As the district continues to grow in this area, further attention will be needed to situational and time sensitive communications, particularly in supporting school leaders and central admin in clearly communicating protocols and addressing caregiver concerns while navigating the necessary constraints of confidentiality.

1067
02:33:31,558 --> 02:33:38,265
Overall, Dr. Colucci's work in this goal area reflects a thoughtful, responsive, and relationship-centered leadership style that has positively impacted the district.

1068
02:33:39,566 --> 02:33:41,188
Okay, so I'm going to pause for a moment.

1069
02:33:41,268 --> 02:33:45,633
Are there any questions from anyone in the committee for this moment, or I'm going to move on?

1070
02:33:51,759 --> 02:33:51,999
Sweet.

1071
02:33:52,279 --> 02:33:53,501
Okay, so

1072
02:33:55,283 --> 02:33:55,964
We're going to move along.

1073
02:33:56,084 --> 02:33:58,485
So again, that's the first portion.

1074
02:33:58,565 --> 02:34:01,127
That's the superintendent performance goals.

1075
02:34:01,768 --> 02:34:04,730
Now we're moving on to the superintendent performance on standards.

1076
02:34:06,071 --> 02:34:10,614
As I mentioned, that first section is on a scale of one to five, four being proficient.

1077
02:34:11,314 --> 02:34:15,477
Going forward, our performance on standards for the superintendent, it's on a scale of one to four.

1078
02:34:16,058 --> 02:34:18,500
Three is your proficient.

1079
02:34:19,471 --> 02:34:22,312
Four is exemplary, one and two are under that.

1080
02:34:22,792 --> 02:34:27,874
So we're aiming at minimum three, but we're shooting for four, at least in my interpretation of it.

1081
02:34:28,755 --> 02:34:35,437
So the first, also bear with me, I'm a little sick, so I'm, if I sound a little under the weather, I apologize.

1082
02:34:37,118 --> 02:34:38,698
Now I'm actually gonna do one thing.

1083
02:34:38,718 --> 02:34:40,479
There's a lot of weather to be under right now.

1084
02:34:41,699 --> 02:34:42,840
This is true, this is true.

1085
02:34:43,520 --> 02:34:47,502
Let me also grab this ferryway, so we're all looking at the same thing.

1086
02:34:49,245 --> 02:34:49,485
Okay.

1087
02:34:52,667 --> 02:34:52,867
Okay.

1088
02:34:53,227 --> 02:35:01,792
So for the superintendent performance on standards, what committee members were doing is this is just the general DESI guidelines.

1089
02:35:02,887 --> 02:35:11,570
This is in no way an interpretation of what, you know, the way that the community members were evaluating is based off of their understanding of what the superintendent did.

1090
02:35:11,930 --> 02:35:13,971
We did not have to set these goals or these standards.

1091
02:35:14,011 --> 02:35:15,971
This is what DESE uses as a framework.

1092
02:35:16,312 --> 02:35:17,912
We follow suit with what DESE recommends.

1093
02:35:19,032 --> 02:35:21,853
So standard one is instructional leadership.

1094
02:35:22,994 --> 02:35:28,796
And then there's going to be subsections for each standard or, you know, four to five-ish substandards, let's call them.

1095
02:35:29,676 --> 02:35:31,297
Standard one, again, is instructional leadership.

1096
02:35:33,505 --> 02:35:41,272
It reads, and this is a combination of what everyone said for each individual subsection that was combined for the total standard.

1097
02:35:43,073 --> 02:35:50,920
Our superintendent has continued to strengthen instructional leadership across the district, building on prior work to increase rigor and align instruction to standards across subject areas.

1098
02:35:51,741 --> 02:35:59,587
Committee members recognize this work as complex and ongoing, and note clear evidence of thoughtful progress, strengthened systems, and growing momentum.

1099
02:36:00,420 --> 02:36:14,054
Under her leadership, the district has improved instructional leadership structures, data systems, and the use of evidence to guide curriculum, instruction, and assessment, increasing leadership capacity, and shared accountability for student learning.

1100
02:36:14,893 --> 02:36:24,035
She has also elevated the quality of professional learning by expanding collaborative planning time and responding directly to educators' identified problems of practice, including through collective bargaining.

1101
02:36:24,656 --> 02:36:31,397
The first-year implementation of middle school challenge courses reflects heightened expectations and has been well-received, earning state-level recognition.

1102
02:36:31,937 --> 02:36:41,000
While continued attention is needed to ensure rigor and effective practices are fully inclusive of students with disabilities and consistently translate into personalized learning and measurable outcomes,

1103
02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:47,105
Committee members observe positive district-wide change and a clear trajectory towards sustained instructional improvement.

1104
02:36:48,626 --> 02:36:57,213
So that's, again, that's a general synopsis of what the, this is, there's five substandards in this standard section.

1105
02:36:57,493 --> 02:36:59,395
That's the kind of the combination of all five substandards.

1106
02:37:00,996 --> 02:37:04,259
So substandard one, or 1.1, is curriculum.

1107
02:37:05,757 --> 02:37:16,361
It reads, Dr. Galluzzi has continued district-wide efforts to strengthen curriculum rigor and alignment to standards across content areas, building on work initiated during her prior role as assistant superintendent.

1108
02:37:17,262 --> 02:37:27,426
Progress is evident through increased coherence in curriculum design and implementation of new instructional offerings, including middle school challenge courses, as mentioned prior, which has been positively received and recognized at the state level.

1109
02:37:28,106 --> 02:37:36,011
Committee members acknowledge that this work is ongoing and note the importance of further applying a rigor-focused lens to special education programming to ensure equitable access to the highest standards for all students.

1110
02:37:38,172 --> 02:37:40,413
Subsection 2, or substandard 2, 1.2 is instruction.

1111
02:37:43,284 --> 02:37:49,767
Dr. Galluzzi has established and supported systems that promote high-quality instructional practice and shared expectations for teaching and learning.

1112
02:37:50,427 --> 02:37:57,870
Through the development of instructional leadership teams and expanded opportunities for collaborative planning, she has strengthened instructional leadership capacity at the school and district level.

1113
02:37:58,270 --> 02:38:04,192
Committee members also know her responsiveness to educator-identified needs and her efforts to improve the quality and relevance of professional development.

1114
02:38:04,692 --> 02:38:08,594
Continued growth in personalized instructional practices remains an area of ongoing focus.

1115
02:38:10,577 --> 02:38:13,178
Substandard 3, or 1.3, is assessment.

1116
02:38:13,639 --> 02:38:21,643
It reads, Dr. DeLucy has strengthened district structures that support the use of multiple measures of student learning to inform instructional practice.

1117
02:38:22,223 --> 02:38:30,948
Principals and administrators are increasingly supported in facilitating data-informed conversations and in using assessment results to adjust instruction when students are not meeting expectations.

1118
02:38:32,068 --> 02:38:38,572
While assessment practices continue to develop, the foundational systems necessary to support consistent and effective use of data are in place.

1119
02:38:40,432 --> 02:38:43,233
Substandard 4, or 1.4, is evaluation.

1120
02:38:44,294 --> 02:38:51,436
It reads, Dr. Galussi has supported effective supervision and evaluation practices aligned with state regulations and contractual requirements.

1121
02:38:51,996 --> 02:39:04,561
Through clear expectations and strengthened leadership structures, she has enabled administrators to engage in evaluative practices that emphasize instructional quality, professional growth, and accountability.

1122
02:39:05,722 --> 02:39:09,143
Committee members note increased consistency in evaluation practices across the district.

1123
02:39:10,272 --> 02:39:14,554
And the final substandard for this section is 1.5, data-informed decision-making.

1124
02:39:16,114 --> 02:39:20,856
Dr. Colussi has prioritized the use of data to guide district and school-level planning and decision-making.

1125
02:39:21,376 --> 02:39:27,198
Committee members highlight her role in strengthening data systems and establishing structures that support analysis of student learning and growth.

1126
02:39:27,719 --> 02:39:32,480
These practices have informed goal-setting, instructional improvement efforts, and organizational performance.

1127
02:39:33,921 --> 02:39:39,363
While the full impact on student outcomes is still emerging, the district is positioned to leverage these systems for sustained improvement.

1128
02:39:41,271 --> 02:39:42,131
I'm going to pause for a second.

1129
02:39:42,211 --> 02:39:45,413
Are there any questions from the committee before we continue on to the next standard?

1130
02:39:49,754 --> 02:40:05,380
It's not a question, but I do want to note one of the instructions that, or one of the guidelines that DESE gives is that to aim to have the proficient in every, to not put everything at level four.

1131
02:40:05,420 --> 02:40:10,542
They recommend a sparse use of the rating of four.

1132
02:40:12,439 --> 02:40:13,820
Yeah, that's a really good thing to note.

1133
02:40:14,660 --> 02:40:22,565
I think it's important to also understand that realistically, shooting for exemplary is a really hard thing to kind of rate on.

1134
02:40:22,665 --> 02:40:28,329
It's entirely possible some districts, including ours, can really do some great work and be exemplary in certain areas.

1135
02:40:28,709 --> 02:40:32,571
But I would argue that we should always be working to do better.

1136
02:40:32,591 --> 02:40:40,196
And realistically, not every single student, staff member, and stakeholder is going to feel the same way that we may as individuals feel.

1137
02:40:40,516 --> 02:40:41,977
And so we're always working to be better.

1138
02:40:42,677 --> 02:40:54,410
But I think Member Reinfeldt's right that members are supposed to be careful when using the exemplary rating or the highest rating because that's a high bar to hit, but we of course are always working towards that.

1139
02:40:56,718 --> 02:40:58,300
So we're gonna move on to the next standard.

1140
02:40:58,700 --> 02:41:00,942
This is standard two, management and operations.

1141
02:41:01,523 --> 02:41:10,012
Again, the first section is gonna be just a general synopsis of all of the, I think there's five also in this, yeah, there's five substandards.

1142
02:41:10,893 --> 02:41:14,437
So the first kind of read back is gonna be just the combination of all that stuff.

1143
02:41:16,659 --> 02:41:28,230
So it reads, the superintendent has demonstrated strong operational leadership by stabilizing and strengthening district systems that support student safety, well-being, and daily functioning while advancing sustainable long-term improvements.

1144
02:41:28,870 --> 02:41:40,662
She addressed longstanding operational challenges while managing complex concurrent demands, including schedule restructuring, contract negotiations, and a major building project with a small central team and a focus on thoughtful planning and stakeholder engagement.

1145
02:41:41,282 --> 02:41:52,953
She's implemented a strategic approach to human capital management by strengthening the organizational structure, building central office capacity, and maintaining fair personal practices and productive labor relationships.

1146
02:41:53,894 --> 02:42:00,601
Through improved scheduling and management systems, she has enhanced the district's ability to manage time, resources, and information in support of instructional priorities.

1147
02:42:01,101 --> 02:42:11,766
She has also demonstrated strong legal, ethical, and fiscal stewardship, allying resources to district goals, responsibly implementing override funds, and developing a student-centered FY26 budget in collaboration with city leadership.

1148
02:42:14,773 --> 02:42:18,436
So the first substandard is 2.1, which is environment.

1149
02:42:18,957 --> 02:42:26,924
It reads, the superintendent has demonstrated strong operational leadership in stabilizing and strengthening district systems that support student safety, well-being, and daily functioning.

1150
02:42:27,485 --> 02:42:38,615
Upon assuming leadership, she confronted multiple longstanding operational challenges, such as limited after-school capacity and systemic inefficiencies, choosing to pursue sustainable long-term solutions rather than short-term fixes.

1151
02:42:39,436 --> 02:42:51,083
Despite a small central team during her initial months, she's worked diligently to improve district operations and communication while managing significant concurrent demands, including schedule restructuring, contract negotiations, and a fast-paced high school building project.

1152
02:42:51,503 --> 02:42:57,927
Her approach has emphasized thoughtful planning, stakeholder engagement, and system-level coherence.

1153
02:42:58,127 --> 02:43:02,070
The next substandard is 2.2, human resources management and development.

1154
02:43:03,136 --> 02:43:08,297
It reads, the superintendent has implemented a cohesive and strategic approach to human capital management.

1155
02:43:08,537 --> 02:43:14,018
She has prioritized hiring the right leaders for the district, even when inclusive and collaborative processes increase short-term complexity.

1156
02:43:14,618 --> 02:43:22,139
Her restructuring of the organizational framework and intentional development of a strong central leadership team has significantly increased her district's operational capacity.

1157
02:43:22,559 --> 02:43:31,401
She's articulated clear goals for future hiring and career growth, oversees personal decisions fairly, and maintains productive, respectful relations with staff, unions, and negotiation teams.

1158
02:43:32,327 --> 02:43:39,310
She's reflective in her practice and open to feedback, including consideration of historical context and past practices when evaluating opportunities for improvement.

1159
02:43:41,310 --> 02:43:45,912
Substandard 3 is 2.3, scheduling and management information systems.

1160
02:43:48,152 --> 02:43:55,960
Through thoughtful coordination and system redesign, the superintendent has improved the district's ability to manage time, resources, and information in service of teaching and learning.

1161
02:43:56,460 --> 02:44:06,130
The successful implementation of changes to the length of the school day and the alignment of operational systems reflect a commitment to minimizing disruption while supporting collaboration and instructional priorities.

1162
02:44:06,650 --> 02:44:12,016
Her leadership has resulted in a more effective and responsive central office structure that better supports school-level staff.

1163
02:44:14,183 --> 02:44:20,326
Subsection four is, or subsection standard four is 2.4, laws, ethics, and policies.

1164
02:44:22,107 --> 02:44:30,570
The superintendent has demonstrated a strong understanding of and adherence to state and federal requirements, school committee policies, collective bargaining agreements, and ethical standards.

1165
02:44:31,030 --> 02:44:38,574
She has led complex contract negotiations responsibly and collaboratively, ensuring compliance while maintaining trust and professionalism across stakeholder groups.

1166
02:44:39,074 --> 02:44:43,116
Her leadership reflects a transparency, ethical decision-making, and respect for governance role.

1167
02:44:44,062 --> 02:44:44,322
rules.

1168
02:44:45,744 --> 02:44:50,048
And the last substandard for this section is 2.5 fiscal systems.

1169
02:44:52,070 --> 02:44:58,516
The superintendent has shown fiscal stewardship and a clear commitment to aligning resources while district priorities with district priorities.

1170
02:44:59,236 --> 02:45:04,601
She successfully implemented override funds and developed a student centered FY 26 budget that reflects the district vision

1171
02:45:05,573 --> 02:45:06,574
mission and the goals.

1172
02:45:07,174 --> 02:45:13,399
She works collaboratively with city leadership to ensure schools are appropriately resourced while maintaining fiscal responsibility and staying within available funding.

1173
02:45:13,959 --> 02:45:20,864
Her approach reflects an understanding that effective financial management is a shared responsibility and that disciplined planning is essential to long-term sustainability.

1174
02:45:20,884 --> 02:45:23,026
I'm going to pause again.

1175
02:45:23,486 --> 02:45:25,868
Are there any questions for this standard section?

1176
02:45:30,347 --> 02:45:30,949
I'm seeing none.

1177
02:45:31,149 --> 02:45:31,511
Love it.

1178
02:45:31,651 --> 02:45:32,213
All right.

1179
02:45:32,714 --> 02:45:33,978
We're going to go, we're going to go to substandard.

1180
02:45:33,998 --> 02:45:36,425
We're going to go standard three, which is engagement.

1181
02:45:37,809 --> 02:45:58,500
The feedback form reads, the superintendent demonstrates a strong commitment to family and community engagement by intentionally creating inclusive, accessible opportunities for participation, particularly among historical underrepresented voices, through listening sessions, surveys, and varied engagement formats, especially during major initiatives such as the Medford High School Project.

1182
02:45:59,040 --> 02:46:03,643
She's expanded community input and reinforced shared responsibility in district planning and decision-making.

1183
02:46:04,505 --> 02:46:12,308
Her communication with families and stakeholders is proactive, respectful, and culturally responsive, supported by strengthened district-wide coordination and leadership.

1184
02:46:13,109 --> 02:46:16,750
Families report appreciation for accessibility and responsiveness to concerns.

1185
02:46:17,410 --> 02:46:25,094
And while communication systems are generally effective, there is an opportunity to further normalize response protocol to ensure consistent, timely follow-up during periods of high volume.

1186
02:46:26,814 --> 02:46:29,575
So the substandard for this section reads 3.1, or engagement.

1187
02:46:32,346 --> 02:46:43,789
The superintendent demonstrates a clear commitment to ensuring that families are welcomed as active members of the school and district community through intentional planning and inclusive engagement strategies, particularly in large-scale initiatives such as the Medford High School Project.

1188
02:46:44,109 --> 02:46:48,790
She has prioritized reaching families and community members who are historically underrepresented in district feedback.

1189
02:46:49,190 --> 02:46:59,333
Her use of multiple engagement formats, including surveys and listening sessions, has expanded access to participation beyond those able to attend in-person meetings, resulting in broader and more representative community input.

1190
02:47:00,456 --> 02:47:01,079
substandard.

1191
02:47:01,360 --> 02:47:03,210
The second substandard is 3.2, sharing responsibility.

1192
02:47:05,947 --> 02:47:11,569
The superintendent consistently collaborates with families and community stakeholders to support student learning and district decision-making.

1193
02:47:12,469 --> 02:47:20,572
During her initial months, she conducted numerous listening sessions that informed subsequent work on the strategic plan, MSBA processes, and advisory groups.

1194
02:47:21,092 --> 02:47:32,416
When the school committee requested additional community input before advancing decisions, she responded by creating additional avenues for engagement, reinforcing a shared responsibility model that values family and community voice as integral to district planning and improvement.

1195
02:47:35,541 --> 02:47:38,462
3.3 substandard reads communication.

1196
02:47:40,223 --> 02:47:46,045
The superintendent's communication with families and community stakeholders is proactive, clear, and culturally responsive.

1197
02:47:46,325 --> 02:47:58,230
She maintains an open and respectful posture towards family input and feedback and has worked to strengthen district-wide communication by effectively leveraging the directive communications and supporting improved consistency among district leaders.

1198
02:47:58,979 --> 02:48:03,421
Communication efforts reach a broad range of stakeholders, including families, staff, and community partners.

1199
02:48:04,001 --> 02:48:19,126
While overall communication is strong, feedback indicates an opportunity to further develop consistent norms and supports for situational or individualized communication, particularly in cases without established protocols, and to strengthen response systems to ensure timely follow-up.

1200
02:48:20,787 --> 02:48:22,567
The last substandard is 3.4, family concerns.

1201
02:48:25,189 --> 02:48:29,050
The superintendent addresses family and community concerns with professionalism, respect, and care.

1202
02:48:29,530 --> 02:48:34,532
Families report appreciation for her responsiveness and accessibility, including direct responses to calls and emails.

1203
02:48:34,992 --> 02:48:47,895
She has articulated expectations for timely communication and follow-up, and there's an opportunity to formalize systems such as delegated support or automated acknowledgements to ensure equitable, efficient responses during periods of high volume.

1204
02:48:48,375 --> 02:48:53,557
Overall, her approach reflects a commitment to addressing concerns in a manner that is fair, thoughtful, and aligned with the needs of the community.

1205
02:48:54,676 --> 02:48:56,997
All right, that's standard three.

1206
02:48:57,317 --> 02:48:57,937
We're almost home.

1207
02:48:58,378 --> 02:49:00,959
Are there any questions I can answer right now before I go to last standard?

1208
02:49:03,980 --> 02:49:04,440
Sweet.

1209
02:49:04,680 --> 02:49:04,960
All right.

1210
02:49:05,180 --> 02:49:06,661
Thanks, guys.

1211
02:49:08,001 --> 02:49:08,842
Thanks for letting me ramble.

1212
02:49:09,222 --> 02:49:11,563
All right, standard four is professional culture.

1213
02:49:13,821 --> 02:49:21,903
Her general feedback reads, Dr. Galussi has established a strong culture of high expectations grounded in collaboration, professionalism, and continuous improvement.

1214
02:49:22,503 --> 02:49:34,065
She has earned the trust of district leadership, the school committee, and labor partners by strengthening systems that support effective teaching and learning while skillfully navigating labor relations, legal requirements, and budget development.

1215
02:49:34,745 --> 02:49:42,027
Her leadership intentionally centers cultural proficiency, belonging, and respect, and she actively seeks diverse perspectives when shaping policy and practice.

1216
02:49:42,865 --> 02:49:53,570
Dr. Galussi communicates clearly and excessively with stakeholders and has significantly improved district-wide communication with continued opportunity to strengthen consistency and timeliness through formalized supports.

1217
02:49:54,350 --> 02:49:59,112
She models reflective practice and data-informed decision-making, fostering a shared commitment to learning and growth.

1218
02:49:59,833 --> 02:50:09,777
Through a collaborative yet decisive leadership style, she advances a shared vision focused on student achievement, post-secondary readiness, and civic engagement while managing conflict with integrity and respect.

1219
02:50:11,400 --> 02:50:14,822
The first substandard of the section is 4.1, commitment to high standards.

1220
02:50:15,603 --> 02:50:20,687
It reads, Dr. Glucy has established a clear, consistent culture of high expectations across the district.

1221
02:50:21,067 --> 02:50:28,953
She has quickly earned the trust and respect of the leadership team, the school committee, and union partners by centering her work on improving systems that enable effective teaching and learning.

1222
02:50:29,760 --> 02:50:38,284
Her ability to navigate complex areas such as labor relations, legal requirements, and budget development has strengthened organizational stability and removed barriers that can impede the instructional progress.

1223
02:50:38,845 --> 02:50:45,808
She sets clear expectations, holds staff accountable, and ensures that operational effectiveness supports high quality educational outcomes for all students.

1224
02:50:48,150 --> 02:50:49,350
The next standard is 4.2, cultural proficiency.

1225
02:50:53,324 --> 02:50:58,666
Dr. Galussi has intentionally embedded cultural proficiency into both instructional and operational practices.

1226
02:50:59,146 --> 02:51:06,808
She has emphasized the importance of belonging and respect for students and staff members' diverse backgrounds, identities, strengths, and challenges.

1227
02:51:07,788 --> 02:51:17,591
Her leadership reflects an understanding that inclusive practices are foundational to student achievement and staff effectiveness, and she actively seeks out and values perspectives that differ from her own when shaping policy and practice.

1228
02:51:19,412 --> 02:51:21,233
The third substandard is 4.3, communications.

1229
02:51:23,730 --> 02:51:29,732
Dr. Gallucci demonstrates strong interpersonal and verbal communication skills and has meaningfully improved communication across the district.

1230
02:51:30,353 --> 02:51:36,135
She's accessible, responsive, and makes herself available to address questions, concerns, and issues raised by staff and stakeholders.

1231
02:51:36,815 --> 02:51:46,279
Committee feedback notes that while communication has improved significantly, continued attention to timeliness, particularly in written communication, will further strengthen trust and transparency.

1232
02:51:46,919 --> 02:51:53,282
Leveraging support staff to acknowledge inquiries and provide clear timelines for follow-up may enhance consistency and effectiveness.

1233
02:51:55,834 --> 02:51:58,195
The next substandard is 4.4, continuous learning.

1234
02:51:59,716 --> 02:52:06,419
Dr. Galluzzi consistently models reflective practices and fosters a culture in which continuous improvement is expected and supported.

1235
02:52:07,179 --> 02:52:14,022
She encourages staff to examine their work, engage with current research and best practices, and use data to inform instructional and operational decisions.

1236
02:52:14,602 --> 02:52:20,185
Her own openness to feedback and willingness to adapt her practice reinforces a district-wide commitment to learning and growth.

1237
02:52:23,163 --> 02:52:25,424
Next substandard is 4.5, shared vision.

1238
02:52:26,665 --> 02:52:31,249
Dr. Galussi has successfully promoted a shared vision grounded in collaboration, achievement, and belonging.

1239
02:52:31,809 --> 02:52:39,596
She engages stakeholders across the district in shaping and advancing this vision, ensuring alignment between instructional priorities and organizational practices.

1240
02:52:40,176 --> 02:52:48,443
Her leadership reflects a clear focus on preparing all students for post-secondary success and active civic participation while maintaining coherence across district initiatives.

1241
02:52:49,745 --> 02:52:53,246
And the last substandard is 4.6, managing conflicts.

1242
02:52:55,307 --> 02:53:00,369
Dr. Galluzzi employs thoughtful and effective strategies to manage disagreement and resolve conflict.

1243
02:53:00,489 --> 02:53:05,451
Her leadership style is collaborative and consensus-oriented, yet she demonstrates the ability to make difficult decisions when necessary.

1244
02:53:05,911 --> 02:53:12,414
She approaches challenging conversations with integrity, openness, and respect, fostering trust while guiding the district forward through periods of change.

1245
02:53:13,589 --> 02:53:15,870
All right, that was a mouthful.

1246
02:53:17,091 --> 02:53:19,872
So that's the end of all the feedback forms.

1247
02:53:21,313 --> 02:53:30,778
I don't believe that we have to look at individual member ratings because the coalescing of all those were evident on this form.

1248
02:53:30,838 --> 02:53:32,059
So I don't feel we need to do that.

1249
02:53:33,620 --> 02:53:37,182
But you can take off the screen share now.

1250
02:53:37,202 --> 02:53:37,742
Thank you so much.

1251
02:53:39,917 --> 02:53:45,139
Are there any questions that I can answer through all that before I kind of do the next little portion of what we got to talk about briefly?

1252
02:53:45,159 --> 02:53:48,820
Yeah.

1253
02:53:51,841 --> 02:53:56,262
Just wanted to say thank you for putting that together.

1254
02:53:58,912 --> 02:54:02,974
We've done, I've gone through this a couple of different ways over the years.

1255
02:54:03,214 --> 02:54:05,315
And 1 of the things that's always been missing is like.

1256
02:54:06,095 --> 02:54:11,117
A cohesive voice that represents what the committee thinks about.

1257
02:54:11,978 --> 02:54:21,642
Um, all of these various things, and you're the, the way that you like, well, everyone's commentary together, I thought was really effective and does paint.

1258
02:54:23,964 --> 02:54:27,405
really a better picture than any one person's comments could.

1259
02:54:27,465 --> 02:54:28,826
So thank you for that.

1260
02:54:29,886 --> 02:54:30,327
Great job.

1261
02:54:31,727 --> 02:54:33,748
And great job to Dr. Galussi too.

1262
02:54:37,210 --> 02:54:38,770
Yes, wonderful job, Dr. Galussi.

1263
02:54:38,790 --> 02:54:41,091
And thank you, member Olopade, very well put together.

1264
02:54:41,391 --> 02:54:44,253
We appreciate all the hard work you put into that over the last few weeks.

1265
02:54:45,313 --> 02:54:47,234
I don't see any questions.

1266
02:54:47,494 --> 02:54:48,375
Other questions from the committee?

1267
02:54:48,415 --> 02:54:49,015
Oh, member Reinfeld?

1268
02:54:50,821 --> 02:54:53,984
I just, actually, I want to give a shout out to Dr. Glucy.

1269
02:54:54,004 --> 02:54:59,168
She had her camera on the whole time and this is probably one of the most excruciating pieces of the job.

1270
02:54:59,989 --> 02:55:04,032
And so I really appreciate the thoughtful comments of my committee, fellow committee members.

1271
02:55:04,533 --> 02:55:13,220
I wanted to ask member Olopade if there were any sections that were, where there was a large variation.

1272
02:55:15,288 --> 02:55:18,591
to reconcile particular comments.

1273
02:55:18,611 --> 02:55:24,616
I thought the narrative was incredibly cohesive and it sounds like people were really quite aligned on the feedback.

1274
02:55:25,757 --> 02:55:33,123
And I just wondered if there were any areas where it was particularly difficult to reconcile.

1275
02:55:33,915 --> 02:55:35,356
For the most part, so that's a great question.

1276
02:55:36,416 --> 02:55:44,860
Given the nature of how the interim superintendent was appointed, it's a bit of a different, we've only had one year.

1277
02:55:45,881 --> 02:55:53,344
And so with that, I think adds, and this is just my own personal perspective on it, not necessarily what Desi kind of has experienced over time.

1278
02:55:54,084 --> 02:55:57,466
I reached out to one member of Desi to kind of have some clarifying questions answered.

1279
02:55:58,467 --> 02:56:06,912
With only one year of the superintendent's tenure under their belt, it's a bit difficult sometimes to determine how

1280
02:56:09,673 --> 02:56:23,342
comprehensive people's ratings may be sometimes because, you know, comparatively, a superintendent who's been in district for, let's say, a decade, many years worth of their tenure allows for maybe a more developed understanding about what specific things we're looking for.

1281
02:56:23,442 --> 02:56:38,712
Even though the district goals and student goals change every year based off of what the framework generally is recommended by DESE, if I have 10 years worth of experience with my superintendent, I'm gonna look for certain things that may not be as evident with only one year of tenure.

1282
02:56:39,072 --> 02:56:58,919
That being said, the only section that I felt as though that there was more notable variance, but not vast variance, but slight variance was the standard three engagement, most notably communication and family concerns.

1283
02:57:00,791 --> 02:57:05,974
The engagement in general and the shared responsibility, that seemed pretty consistent across the board.

1284
02:57:06,875 --> 02:57:22,985
But communication and family concerns, that's where I think men, not most members, but there were more members who had something to say about having conversations with families and stakeholders in the public who were concerned about X, Y, and Z. And then how was the superintendent responding to those concerns?

1285
02:57:23,906 --> 02:57:26,548
We can understand that as parents and stakeholders in the community.

1286
02:57:27,628 --> 02:57:33,733
when we have concerns, if they're not met immediately, the anxiety of that concern can kind of continue to increase.

1287
02:57:33,753 --> 02:57:36,174
So that's my understanding at least sometimes.

1288
02:57:36,214 --> 02:57:54,247
And so if there is an ongoing discussion about how to improve upon a concern from a stakeholder, but because of contract negotiations or other things that may be going on behind the scenes that we're still working towards, the concerns may not be answered immediately, which I think may be why some members of the committee

1289
02:57:54,667 --> 02:58:03,133
evaluate saying that there is room for growth there because families have continued to communicate saying there is there's improvement in communication but we want to see more.

1290
02:58:03,674 --> 02:58:06,396
You can kind of always communicate, you can always improve communication.

1291
02:58:06,416 --> 02:58:08,337
I think we all know that.

1292
02:58:08,817 --> 02:58:10,358
That was like one of the biggest things we learned.

1293
02:58:10,378 --> 02:58:15,102
I know that many members went to the our annual school committee conference and

1294
02:58:15,582 --> 02:58:18,984
basically the name of the game is communication, communication, communication, right?

1295
02:58:19,464 --> 02:58:21,285
And I think that that is always the case.

1296
02:58:22,066 --> 02:58:35,434
But other than that substandard or that standard with the two noted substandards, for the most part, committee members were pretty much across the board in agreement with either proficient or some really notable exemplary standards.

1297
02:58:35,454 --> 02:58:36,194
We didn't have any

1298
02:58:38,165 --> 02:58:43,729
not meeting expectations in any section, which I thought was a real good thing to note.

1299
02:58:44,529 --> 02:58:48,972
And of course, there's one or two places for growth has been noted, but there's more growth to be had.

1300
02:58:50,073 --> 02:58:55,796
Even with the communication substandards, those were still proficient.

1301
02:58:55,816 --> 02:58:59,479
There wasn't any massive denotes where someone said this isn't working and we need to start over.

1302
02:59:00,420 --> 02:59:02,042
which I thought is an important clarifying question.

1303
02:59:02,062 --> 02:59:11,094
When we talk a lot about going forward, I know we're going to talk a little bit later on the agenda about our long-term superintendent position.

1304
02:59:12,448 --> 02:59:21,632
when we as individual members are gonna make a decision, it's important to note what's been done in just one short year's time and what we're hoping to accomplish in the next handful of years.

1305
02:59:22,432 --> 02:59:38,519
And I think that thus far, at least with the six, the seven committee members who vote, who have given their rankings, it seems to be there's some solid consensus that our interim superintendent has been doing a really good job with places to grow, but nowhere where people felt as though that there was no growth

1306
02:59:39,079 --> 02:59:42,560
And there's some concern about how that's going to be moving us forward.

1307
02:59:42,580 --> 02:59:43,741
Does that answer your question?

1308
02:59:44,081 --> 02:59:44,381
It does.

1309
02:59:44,461 --> 02:59:44,881
Thank you.

1310
02:59:45,001 --> 02:59:46,281
And I know it was an awkward question.

1311
02:59:46,301 --> 02:59:50,343
This whole thing feels very awkward, but I do appreciate it.

1312
02:59:50,823 --> 02:59:52,143
Yeah, absolutely.

1313
02:59:52,304 --> 02:59:54,304
It's an awkward process.

1314
02:59:54,744 --> 03:00:00,026
This is also public, not just in this very moment, but this is now going to be public in general.

1315
03:00:00,046 --> 03:00:05,408
So any member of the public can ask to see this evaluation, which I think

1316
03:00:06,008 --> 03:00:13,736
is both a transparent thing but also a difficult thing because it's a performance review in some ways, but that is a part of what it means to be a school committee member.

1317
03:00:13,756 --> 03:00:22,344
That was something that was declared very explicitly when I started this process is that this is one of our main jobs is to do this and so I think it's important that we are as

1318
03:00:24,515 --> 03:00:26,396
impartial and professional as we could possibly be.

1319
03:00:26,476 --> 03:00:28,878
And I found that's what happened with these reviews.

1320
03:00:29,038 --> 03:00:41,284
I found when I read through everything and I took all the feedback and scoring, at no point was I concerned about any one members, including myself, with any type of bias that was evident in the feedback forms.

1321
03:00:41,504 --> 03:00:47,648
So hopefully what I put together is cohesive enough where people can kind of hold their own understanding.

1322
03:00:48,408 --> 03:00:50,169
I'm happy to answer any other questions members may have.

1323
03:00:50,509 --> 03:00:50,869
If not,

1324
03:00:52,210 --> 03:01:01,632
I should also, oh, the last thing I'll say before I stop talking for a while, because I'm talked out, is this is now going to go to DESI, this eval, this is a part of their process.

1325
03:01:01,972 --> 03:01:03,513
They want to see these annually as well.

1326
03:01:04,233 --> 03:01:13,355
I'll clarify to them what I've said multiple times is that we didn't have the typical process to get to this point, but they're aware of that already.

1327
03:01:13,655 --> 03:01:16,516
They'll be made aware of that again when I submit this to them for review.

1328
03:01:17,176 --> 03:01:25,938
But this is also part of the process that every time we do one of these, that they get to see where we are as a district and where our superintendent's office is, so that they are also informed.

1329
03:01:26,499 --> 03:01:33,901
So we're not behind the eight ball about the new moving forward standards or protocols for the state, and that we're in line with them as best we can.

1330
03:01:34,061 --> 03:01:38,782
So that'll go to them, and then we'll move on with the next step of this evaluation process.

1331
03:01:39,542 --> 03:01:40,162
All right, I'm done.

1332
03:01:40,322 --> 03:01:40,682
Thank you.

1333
03:01:41,583 --> 03:01:41,763
Great.

1334
03:01:42,383 --> 03:01:42,663
Thank you.

1335
03:01:43,610 --> 03:01:44,171
Thank you very much.

1336
03:01:44,271 --> 03:01:46,174
Is there a motion for- Get a drink.

1337
03:01:46,534 --> 03:01:48,757
Sorry.

1338
03:01:48,778 --> 03:01:50,460
I think the superintendent has something to say, actually.

1339
03:01:50,480 --> 03:01:51,101
Dr. Galuski?

1340
03:01:53,218 --> 03:02:14,630
I'm new at all this, but if it's appropriate, I would just like to thank you all, because I know this, though it might be an awkward process, it's kind of awkward all the way around, and I do really want to thank you all for your time and your thought and effort that went into this evaluation and provision of feedback.

1341
03:02:16,251 --> 03:02:25,361
I do pride myself on being a lifelong learner so I really truly do appreciate the candor and the feedback because I do need it to guide my growth.

1342
03:02:26,742 --> 03:02:35,672
I do want to take an opportunity since this was a really unique year and there were a lot of comments throughout the process to just thank

1343
03:02:37,133 --> 03:02:42,135
the administration and the staff, especially at the beginning for their collaboration and support.

1344
03:02:42,815 --> 03:02:50,178
Medford truly is a remarkable community and the manner in which people came together to support during that time.

1345
03:02:50,198 --> 03:02:54,720
I really just wanted to acknowledge that and appreciate it.

1346
03:02:55,421 --> 03:03:00,943
It really did take a village from last January to this August.

1347
03:03:01,683 --> 03:03:23,743
um and that was really exemplified and I just wanted to say thank you and then I also wanted to just acknowledge that the team um we have put in place I'm just so grateful for um and all the work they've accomplished in such a short amount of time but the continued work that's to come I am really grateful for the team we are establishing and

1348
03:03:24,883 --> 03:03:28,325
do feel that Medford's in really strong, capable, knowledgeable hands.

1349
03:03:30,067 --> 03:03:40,974
And I hear the feedback, and I will work really diligently to ensure that continued consistency, coherence, and belonging throughout the district.

1350
03:03:41,234 --> 03:03:43,396
And I did note it in my self-evaluation.

1351
03:03:45,117 --> 03:03:47,739
I do really appreciate the piece about communication.

1352
03:03:48,639 --> 03:03:51,320
I commit to working with the team on building better systems.

1353
03:03:51,481 --> 03:03:54,162
I don't want caregivers to feel that they are not heard.

1354
03:03:54,262 --> 03:03:57,864
So that's real and that's important.

1355
03:03:59,025 --> 03:04:00,926
As well as now that we have

1356
03:04:01,706 --> 03:04:20,300
a team in place, and those systems are there working for the outcomes for ensuring that we have the rigor and effective practices so that all of our students feel fully included in a personalized manner with measurable outcomes is really the work.

1357
03:04:20,401 --> 03:04:22,122
So thank you very much.

1358
03:04:22,782 --> 03:04:24,964
I really do appreciate the thoughtful feedback.

1359
03:04:29,107 --> 03:04:29,928
Thank you, Dr. Lucey.

1360
03:04:32,747 --> 03:04:38,489
Is there a motion for approval of the compiled evaluation form by member Olopade?

1361
03:04:39,390 --> 03:04:40,870

less than clear understanding of when things go into effect.

1391
03:06:02,655 --> 03:06:10,842

03:09:42,462 --> 03:09:42,702
Yes.

1483
03:09:44,002 --> 03:09:44,883

Yes.

1486
03:09:47,443 --> 03:09:49,104
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1487
03:09:49,124 --> 03:09:50,204
Did we call Member Parks?

1488
03:09:50,945 --> 03:09:51,105
No.

1489
03:09:51,605 --> 03:09:52,165
Oh, I'm sorry.

1490
03:09:52,205 --> 03:09:52,505
We didn't.

1491
03:09:52,545 --> 03:09:52,905
I'm sorry.

1492
03:09:54,006 --> 03:09:56,867
I'm so used to being after Member Olopade.

1493
03:09:56,907 --> 03:09:57,207
Sorry.

1494
03:09:58,187 --> 03:09:58,987
Member Parks.

1495
03:09:59,768 --> 03:10:00,068
Yes.

1496
03:10:01,918 --> 03:10:05,199
Last but not least, so seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, motion passes.

1497
03:10:06,299 --> 03:10:06,699
Thank you.

Member Mastraboni.

1509
03:11:10,300 --> 03:11:12,001
Roll call, please.

1510
03:11:13,982 --> 03:11:14,482
Member Graham?

1511
03:11:15,403 --> 03:11:15,623
Yes.

1512
03:11:16,644 --> 03:11:17,604
Member Mastraboni?

1513
03:11:17,825 --> 03:11:18,045
Yes.

1514
03:11:18,985 --> 03:11:19,646
Member Olopade?

1515
03:11:20,166 --> 03:11:20,546
Yes.

1516
03:11:21,267 --> 03:11:21,867
Member Parks?

1517
03:11:22,848 --> 03:11:23,128
Yes.

1518
03:11:24,009 --> 03:11:25,390
Member Reinfeld?

1519
03:11:25,890 --> 03:11:26,150
Yes.

1520
03:11:27,111 --> 03:11:27,811
Member Rossell?

1521
03:11:27,831 --> 03:11:28,051
Yes.

1522
03:11:30,342 --> 03:11:33,145
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1523
03:11:33,705 --> 03:11:34,906
Committees have been approved.

1524
03:11:35,247 --> 03:11:35,827
Thank you, everybody.

1525
03:11:39,090 --> 03:11:47,758
Offered by member Reinfeldt, 2026-4, whereas the Medford School Committee will soon vote on a path forward for permanent leadership within Medford Public Schools.

1526
03:11:48,019 --> 03:11:54,965
And whereas the recently issued strategic planning survey includes questions about the broader MPS community's priorities for district leadership.

1527
03:11:55,652 --> 03:12:04,173
Be it therefore resolved that the chair of the strategic planning subcommittee will compile the responses relevant to this deliberation and share the data with the full school committee.

1528
03:12:04,654 --> 03:12:13,635
Be it further resolved that this content be delivered to the committee no later than the February 2nd meeting and reviewed by all members prior to the aforementioned vote.

1529
03:12:14,975 --> 03:12:15,856
Member Reinfeld.

1530
03:12:16,636 --> 03:12:23,397
Sure, hopefully this resolution speaks mostly for itself, but it builds on the resolution passed in

1531
03:12:24,905 --> 03:12:36,972
October that the strategic planning process include input as to district leadership to inform our appointment of a permanent superintendent for the upcoming fiscal year.

1532
03:12:38,873 --> 03:12:43,016
As you saw, we've done the evaluation with the committee.

1533
03:12:43,376 --> 03:12:52,181
We have been hearing from members of the administration, members of the community on kind of an ad hoc basis, but we need to

1534
03:12:52,800 --> 03:13:00,841
make this decision soon, particularly as we look across the state at what is happening with superintendent searches.

1535
03:13:01,722 --> 03:13:06,942
And just, we know that there is a lot of data out there about people's hopes.

1536
03:13:07,143 --> 03:13:16,824
Our job as the school committee is to match district leadership with the vision for the district, and this data exists, and I think it is time for us to look at it.

1537
03:13:17,704 --> 03:13:18,425
I don't know, is there more?

1538
03:13:18,445 --> 03:13:20,345
Does anyone have any questions about this?

1539
03:13:21,965 --> 03:13:22,946
Perfect explanation.

1540
03:13:23,006 --> 03:13:24,007
Thank you, Member Reinfeldt.

1541
03:13:24,708 --> 03:13:25,449
Motion to approve?

1542
03:13:25,509 --> 03:13:29,133
If there's no questions, is there a motion to approve by Member Graham, seconded by?

1543
03:13:29,153 --> 03:13:31,096
Second.

1544
03:13:32,237 --> 03:13:33,759
Member Parks, roll call, please.

1545
03:13:34,760 --> 03:13:36,001
Could I get the item number?

1546
03:13:36,101 --> 03:13:37,423
I lost the agenda on my menu screen.

1547
03:13:37,443 --> 03:13:37,463
2026-4.

1548
03:13:37,483 --> 03:13:37,843
Thank you so much.

1549
03:13:52,343 --> 03:13:52,843
Member Graham?

1550
03:13:53,444 --> 03:13:53,664
Yes.

1551
03:13:54,885 --> 03:13:55,646
Member Mesterbaum?

1552
03:13:55,786 --> 03:13:56,026
Yes.

1553
03:13:56,947 --> 03:13:57,627
Member Olopade?

1554
03:13:57,887 --> 03:13:58,168
Yes.

1555
03:13:59,509 --> 03:14:00,109
Member Parks?

1556
03:14:01,130 --> 03:14:01,390
Yes.

1557
03:14:02,271 --> 03:14:02,912
Member Rheinfeld?

1558
03:14:03,252 --> 03:14:03,472
Yes.

1559
03:14:04,633 --> 03:14:05,233
Member Rousseau?

1560
03:14:05,273 --> 03:14:05,474
Yes.

1561
03:14:05,534 --> 03:14:06,254
Mayor Longo Kern?

1562
03:14:07,375 --> 03:14:07,655
Yes.

1563
03:14:07,755 --> 03:14:09,557
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1564
03:14:10,318 --> 03:14:11,418
Resolution 2026-04 passes.

1565
03:14:11,438 --> 03:14:12,800
2026-05 offered by Member Graham.

1566
03:14:19,019 --> 03:14:26,423
Whereas the Medford School Committee recognizes the importance of establishing a thoughtful process for deciding how to appoint a permanent superintendent on July 1st, 2026.

1567
03:14:26,563 --> 03:14:34,187
And whereas the Medford School Committee wishes to ensure opportunities for public input and community engagement as part of this process.

1568
03:14:34,787 --> 03:14:42,391
Now therefore be it resolved that the Medford School Committee will determine its approach to appointing a permanent superintendent at its public meeting on February 2nd, 2026.

1569
03:14:42,551 --> 03:14:46,853
And be it further resolved that the school committee invites

1570
03:14:47,356 --> 03:15:02,246
feedback from the public during this meeting and be it for the resolve that members of the community who are unable to attend the meeting but wish to provide input may submit feedback via email to the Medford School Committee at medfordsc.medford.k12.ma.us.

1571
03:15:03,387 --> 03:15:03,887
Member Graham.

1572
03:15:05,208 --> 03:15:05,688
Thank you.

1573
03:15:06,829 --> 03:15:11,392
Now that we have completed the superintendent's evaluation

1574
03:15:13,183 --> 03:15:22,005
I feel like it is time for us to make some decisions about how we will move forward so that we have a permanent leader in place by July 1st.

1575
03:15:22,205 --> 03:15:31,768
And that's like, I know today's not the day to talk about warm sun in July, but it will be here before we know it and the snow will melt too.

1576
03:15:31,828 --> 03:15:32,588
I promise, but.

1577
03:15:33,708 --> 03:16:02,313
I do think it's important for the community to know when we're going to sort of consider all of these things and invite people to tell us what they're thinking, especially given the presentations that we've had over the last couple of weeks via the superintendent's self-evaluation and then the compilation of the school committee evaluation that rated the superintendent across 29 different categories.

1578
03:16:03,378 --> 03:16:09,082
Um, and I think it's time for us at our next meeting to make some decisions about how to move forward.

1579
03:16:09,162 --> 03:16:21,009
So my proposal is just simply that we're going to do that in the next meeting and that this is sort of us giving the community time, um, and a heads up to know that that's coming.

1580
03:16:21,049 --> 03:16:25,332
And that is what will, one of the things that we will be focused on in our February 2nd meeting.

1581
03:16:29,434 --> 03:16:30,495
Thank you, member Graham.

1582
03:16:33,823 --> 03:16:35,024
member of master to approve.

1583
03:16:35,844 --> 03:16:42,608
So, if I may just reminding folks watching at home that that's in a week, we don't have extra time in between the meetings.

1584
03:16:43,268 --> 03:16:47,130
So, you know, feedback, just the timing is really really important on this.

1585
03:16:49,311 --> 03:17:00,777
Yes, and from the chair, I could point out I agree with you I know I've received 10 to 20 emails myself already with feedback so I don't know if we'll, we'll be

1586
03:17:01,375 --> 03:17:15,580
even doing a post or be in the superintendents, which is another awkward thing, but in the superintendents Friday memo, just as an additional heads up so that we know people have the opportunity to email us if they have opinions.

1587
03:17:18,081 --> 03:17:22,083
Yeah, I can work with Dr. Bellucci to strike the right tone on that wording.

1588
03:17:24,484 --> 03:17:24,684
Great.

1589
03:17:25,664 --> 03:17:26,705
And what number was this, 2026 dot?

1590
03:17:28,458 --> 03:17:28,718
Five.

1591
03:17:29,098 --> 03:17:29,538
Five.

1592
03:17:29,618 --> 03:17:30,019
Thank you.

1593
03:17:30,499 --> 03:17:31,199
I was going to guess.

1594
03:17:32,880 --> 03:17:34,360
Okay, so that was by member Graham.

1595
03:17:34,380 --> 03:17:36,221
So motion for approval by member Graham.

1596
03:17:36,281 --> 03:17:37,061
Is there a second?

1597
03:17:38,021 --> 03:17:38,482
Second.

1598

Yes.

1602

Member Mastropone.

1603
03:17:45,804 --> 03:17:46,024
Yes.

1604
03:17:47,005 --> 03:17:47,685
Member Olopade.

1605
03:17:47,925 --> 03:17:48,205

Yes.

1610
03:17:55,007 --> 03:17:55,588

Yes.

1612
03:17:57,475 --> 03:17:59,417
Yes, some of the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1613
03:18:00,337 --> 03:18:01,178
Motion passes.

1614
03:18:04,721 --> 03:18:09,866
We do not have any reports requested, and we do have a few condolences, unfortunately.

1615
03:18:09,986 --> 03:18:11,927
So if you don't mind, I'm gonna read them.

1616
03:18:11,947 --> 03:18:24,478
The members of the Medford School Committee express their sincerest condolences to the family of Beverly Gressinger, Medford Public School Payroll Administrative Assistant, Jennifer Durow's grandmother.

1617
03:18:25,212 --> 03:18:36,664
The members of the Memphis School Committee expressed their sincerest condolences to the family of Robert A. Carbone, whose Medford Public Schools career spanned over 25 years as an English teacher and assistant principal.

1618
03:18:38,226 --> 03:18:47,296
Also, the members of the Medford School Committee expressed their sincerest condolences to the family of Pamela Kilbride, McGlynn Middle School teacher, Patricia Kilbride's mother-in-law.

1619
03:18:48,599 --> 03:18:59,849
And lastly, the members of the Medford School Committee express their sincerest condolences to the family of Michelle A. Andrea Tola-Pothier, who was a graduate of Medford High School and beloved teacher at the Medford Family Network.

1620
03:19:01,250 --> 03:19:04,413
If you all may please take a moment of silence.

1621
03:19:15,903 --> 03:19:16,183
Thank you.

1622
03:19:20,301 --> 03:19:30,451
Our next regular meeting, which has been mentioned is next Monday, February 2nd, 2026 in the Alden Memorial chambers, uh, Medford city hall, in addition to zoom.

1623
03:19:31,872 --> 03:19:38,939
And we do have a MSBA, um, meeting in the library this Wednesday, the 28th at six 30.

1624
03:19:41,841 --> 03:19:44,523
Otherwise, is there any mayor?

1625
03:19:45,043 --> 03:19:50,627
Yes, the meeting this week is the communications and community engagement meeting.

1626
03:19:51,847 --> 03:19:53,588
And it is on zoom only.

1627
03:19:54,689 --> 03:19:55,890
So it is a subcommittee meeting.

1628
03:19:57,811 --> 03:19:58,612
Thank you for letting me know.

1629
03:19:58,632 --> 03:20:01,574
Okay, so it's a subcommittee meeting on zoom only.

1630
03:20:02,134 --> 03:20:08,338
Yeah, to be clear, that's the building committee subcommittee, not this body's subcommittee for similar things.

1631
03:20:09,078 --> 03:20:11,140
The next building committee meeting is February 11.

1632
03:20:17,147 --> 03:20:18,548
Motion to adjourn.

1633
03:20:20,189 --> 03:20:20,889
Glad I brought that up.

1634
03:20:21,029 --> 03:20:22,469
Motion to adjourn by Member Reinfeldt.

1635
03:20:22,549 --> 03:20:23,430
Seconded by?

03:20:23,450 --> 03:20:25,170
Second.

1637
03:20:27,171 --> 03:20:28,672
I think Member Graham, gotcha.

1638
03:20:29,252 --> 03:20:30,993

03:20:33,074 --> 03:20:33,514
