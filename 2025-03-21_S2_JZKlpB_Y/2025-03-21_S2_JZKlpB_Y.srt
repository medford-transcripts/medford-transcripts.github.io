18
00:01:06,384 --> 00:01:07,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent.

19
00:01:09,686 --> 00:01:12,788
[SPEAKER_17]: So what you have is you have the minutes from the Committee of the Whole.

20
00:01:13,669 --> 00:01:15,430
[SPEAKER_17]: Sometimes we read them, sometimes we don't.

21
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,331
[SPEAKER_17]: And hopefully you've had a chance to read through them.

22
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:18,752
[SPEAKER_17]: And we can waive the reading tonight.

23
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:22,474

00:01:43,889 --> 00:01:44,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

33
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:45,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot, is there a motion?

34
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:46,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

35
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Could we suspend the order so that we could take up the order?

36
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Brooke School Art Teachers request permission for mural.

37
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:56,316
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion on the floor for suspension of the rules.

38
00:01:56,356 --> 00:01:57,017
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

39
00:01:58,267 --> 00:01:59,847
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed, suspension is granted.

40
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:01,028
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll take communications.

41
00:02:01,048 --> 00:02:03,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Brooke School, our teachers request permission for mural.

42
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address, please.

43
00:02:06,529 --> 00:02:08,529
[SPEAKER_21]: Diane Caldwell, assistant superintendent.

44
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,209
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening, everybody.

45
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:18,451
[SPEAKER_21]: At this time, I'd like to call up Sue Green and Michelle Maseka to come to the podium to discuss a wonderful project.

46
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:22,132
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'd like to share with you Harold and the Purple Crayon.

47
00:02:22,212 --> 00:02:27,713
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a mural that these two teachers would like to paint.

48
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,313
[SPEAKER_21]: by the Brooks Kindergarten, so I'm going to leave it to the girls.

49
00:02:31,494 --> 00:02:31,994
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

50
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:34,037
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm Michelle Mazzica.

51
00:02:34,297 --> 00:02:35,338
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is Sue Keith.

52
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,901
[SPEAKER_20]: We're both art teachers at the Brooks Elementary.

53
00:02:38,902 --> 00:02:46,551
[SPEAKER_20]: And we're here tonight seeking approval to move forward with our proposal to paint a mural in the kindergarten hallway on the first floor of the Brooks Elementary School.

54
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:55,374
[SPEAKER_20]: We already presented a version of this proposal to the PTO in April of 2015, and were approved for $1,000, including the cost of materials.

55
00:02:56,374 --> 00:03:04,879
[SPEAKER_20]: The mural design would extend the length of the kindergarten hallway, where the kindergarten classes are located, and that's generally where the teachers use that space to

56
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,160
[SPEAKER_20]: line up their classroom during transition times.

57
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:16,704
[SPEAKER_20]: It's 80 feet long by 9 feet tall and we want to put a mural there that's based on the children's book Harold and the Purple Crayon.

58
00:03:17,544 --> 00:03:25,628
[SPEAKER_20]: Our design shows a scene of life-sized animals and a purple outline with Harold at the end drawing the last animal on the wall.

59
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:33,171
[SPEAKER_20]: Our goal is to transform the blank space with art in a way that's going to support the literacy and science curriculum.

60
00:03:35,578 --> 00:03:35,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

61
00:03:35,738 --> 00:03:36,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot.

62
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:38,359
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

63
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,339
[SPEAKER_20]: Discary.

64
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:40,360
[SPEAKER_13]: Copyright infringements?

65
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,281
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we need permission from the author?

66
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:46,762
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, we're not copying anything.

67
00:03:46,782 --> 00:03:48,402
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just in the style of.

68
00:03:48,682 --> 00:03:51,283
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to make sure that we don't run into any infringements.

69
00:03:53,044 --> 00:03:53,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

70
00:03:53,224 --> 00:03:53,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Van der Kloot.

71
00:03:53,884 --> 00:03:56,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's actually, I mean, it's incredibly cute.

72
00:03:56,505 --> 00:03:58,846
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, but that actually is my question as well.

73
00:03:59,326 --> 00:04:04,748
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm concerned that you really need to check that out because even if it's in the style of, if it's purple,

74
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,451
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, with a little boy named Harold drawing it.

75
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:15,392
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that probably, you probably need to, I'm not sure if the author's still living at this point.

76
00:04:15,412 --> 00:04:31,916
[SPEAKER_02]: I know when we've done other murals, if we put the author's name in the style of, and put the children's book author right there on the mural, and put the date of the original illustrations on the mural, that can usually do much to cover us.

77
00:04:31,977 --> 00:04:33,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, we're not selling it.

78
00:04:40,158 --> 00:04:42,560
[SPEAKER_03]: So I still would contact the publisher and ask.

79
00:04:43,261 --> 00:04:56,012
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, but it's wonderful and it's great, and so you certainly have my approval if there's no concerns about whether we don't have to pay any royalties.

80
00:04:56,492 --> 00:04:56,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?

81
00:04:58,193 --> 00:04:58,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

82
00:04:59,134 --> 00:04:59,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Benedetto?

83
00:05:01,073 --> 00:05:01,974
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the idea.

84
00:05:01,994 --> 00:05:03,115
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it will be bright.

85
00:05:03,716 --> 00:05:07,260
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate the picture of the hallway on your notification.

86
00:05:08,481 --> 00:05:10,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it really is a blank space now.

87
00:05:10,683 --> 00:05:12,505
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it will be a fun area.

88
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:16,850
[SPEAKER_10]: And if they're standing there waiting, they can trace out in kindergarten.

89
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,153
[SPEAKER_10]: It just gives them something to look at.

90
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:22,196
[SPEAKER_10]: And it is my favorite color.

91
00:05:24,278 --> 00:05:24,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

92
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:27,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion on the floor for particular permission?

93
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval by Ms.

94
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

95
00:05:30,321 --> 00:05:31,142
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

96
00:05:31,862 --> 00:05:32,563
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

97
00:05:32,783 --> 00:05:33,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion is granted.

98
00:05:33,703 --> 00:05:34,744
[SPEAKER_09]: The left can't wait to see it.

99
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:35,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

100
00:05:35,424 --> 00:05:35,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

101
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:40,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to revert back to the regular order of business by Ms.

102
00:05:40,127 --> 00:05:40,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot.

103
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:41,427
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

104
00:05:41,447 --> 00:05:42,648
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

105
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:45,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Reports of the superintendent.

106
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Report on Science Fair 2016.

107
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:48,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent.

108
00:05:50,005 --> 00:06:07,876
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, we'll call upon our Director of Science, Rocco Sieri, and our Deputy Superintendent, Beverly Nelson, to give us information on the science fair and to talk about the winners and all the things that many of you witnessed when you went up to the science fair.

109
00:06:12,992 --> 00:06:13,913
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening, everyone.

110
00:06:14,813 --> 00:06:19,177
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm excited to be here to provide a quick summary of the report you have in front of you.

111
00:06:21,158 --> 00:06:24,901
[SPEAKER_18]: On February 25th, we had the annual science fair.

112
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:26,603
[SPEAKER_18]: It was held in the science lecture hall.

113
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:36,110
[SPEAKER_18]: And students at this event, there were 35 projects, 21 individual projects, and 14 team projects.

114
00:06:36,748 --> 00:06:50,464
[SPEAKER_18]: This evening, we have students that have joined us to be recognized by the school committee body, and we're very excited to be able to provide you with that information.

115
00:06:50,504 --> 00:06:51,545
[SPEAKER_18]: I apologize for my throat.

116
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:56,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, that would be good.

117
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:15,098
[SPEAKER_18]: The event was attended by the mayor, Stephanie Muccini-Burke, as well as many school committee members.

118
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:23,570
[SPEAKER_18]: We had over 30 judges that joined us from Genzyme and from our newfound partners and

119
00:07:25,901 --> 00:07:28,323
[SPEAKER_18]: sort of help in the community from Tufts University.

120
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:40,651
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're really excited that this fair has really brought together a lot of individuals for the students to have a public audience rather than just a teacher or educational audience.

121
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:44,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Benedetto.

122
00:07:45,415 --> 00:07:45,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Burke.

123
00:07:46,596 --> 00:07:46,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

124
00:07:47,276 --> 00:07:53,140
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, I want to thank you for all your time and effort each year providing these children the opportunity to show

125
00:07:54,878 --> 00:07:57,059
[SPEAKER_10]: what they've learned through our community.

126
00:07:57,239 --> 00:08:08,445
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure the projects have been more elaborate now that we have our beautiful new science labs and that we are building more and more partnerships with Genzyme and Tufts University.

127
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:17,909
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry I couldn't make the event and I'm very happy to hear about some of the winners that we might have had and hopefully are present tonight.

128
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:19,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

129
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:24,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Seary, could you comment on a couple of the senior projects, because they were simply amazing?

130
00:08:25,217 --> 00:08:25,637
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

131
00:08:25,657 --> 00:08:29,058
[SPEAKER_18]: I will do my best to pronounce some of these projects.

132
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:33,339
[SPEAKER_18]: I stumbled over my words trying to get through them.

133
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:40,702
[SPEAKER_18]: Serena and Simona Miller, Serena Doe and Simona Miller, did a project that I was able to actually witness.

134
00:08:41,302 --> 00:08:44,263
[SPEAKER_18]: I was actually disturbing them while they were conducting these experiments.

135
00:08:44,683 --> 00:08:45,684
[SPEAKER_18]: It was pretty fun to see.

136
00:08:47,165 --> 00:08:54,107
[SPEAKER_18]: And they looked at the effect of varying the alcohol types and concentrations on the sensitivity of muon flux detection by a cloud chamber.

137
00:08:56,307 --> 00:09:03,429
[SPEAKER_18]: So under the direction of some of our educators, they were able to conduct some pretty amazing projects.

138
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:08,430
[SPEAKER_18]: Other projects, for example, Michelle, who's here with us this evening, Michelle Nguyen,

139
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,231
[SPEAKER_18]: who's been, I believe, a four-year participant.

140
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:20,856
[SPEAKER_18]: So from freshman year to senior year now, she studied the effect of varying fungal chitin concentrations on the tensile strength of bioplastics.

141
00:09:21,116 --> 00:09:22,096
[SPEAKER_18]: And there are several others.

142
00:09:22,156 --> 00:09:23,617
[SPEAKER_18]: We always see increasing

143
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:39,532
[SPEAKER_18]: sophistication as the kids get older, but also we're really getting to a point where there's a real collaboration between Tufts, our school, students doing a variety of projects, and even seeing an increase in the students that come from the vocational school that participate.

144
00:09:39,572 --> 00:09:43,375
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's really a really remarkable event at this point.

145
00:09:44,056 --> 00:09:44,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Wonderful.

146
00:09:44,476 --> 00:09:47,980
[SPEAKER_09]: If we could have the students line up and we can give out their awards.

147
00:09:57,311 --> 00:10:04,654
[SPEAKER_09]: The Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Daowen Doe, 2016 Medford High School Science and Engineering, via first place, grade nine.

148
00:10:04,994 --> 00:10:05,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Daowen.

149
00:10:12,058 --> 00:10:17,680
Congratulations.

[SPEAKER_09]: Wonderful.

00:13:40,317 --> 00:13:42,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much for coming tonight, Mr. Seary.

00:13:58,862 --> 00:13:59,562

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:04,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Riccio.

182
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:12,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

183
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening school committee members.

184
00:14:15,424 --> 00:14:25,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Prior to the SkillsUSA district competition results, we would like to make formally an announcement that we received full chapter 74 approval for our environmental science program.

185
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,323
[SPEAKER_08]: with the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

186
00:14:29,383 --> 00:14:30,765
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're pretty excited about that.

187
00:14:37,671 --> 00:14:46,019
[SPEAKER_08]: And it couldn't have been done without Rocco Sieri back here, who had full support of our program and moving it forward, because I am not a science person.

188
00:14:46,099 --> 00:14:49,082
[SPEAKER_08]: So he really helped us move it forward.

189
00:14:50,190 --> 00:15:00,094
[SPEAKER_08]: The SkillsUSA district competition results, we sent over 20 students to the district competition in February at Keefe Vocational Technical High School.

190
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:06,296
[SPEAKER_08]: And competing with over 700 students, we were able to receive four medals.

191
00:15:07,216 --> 00:15:09,717
[SPEAKER_08]: That then moves them on to the state competition in April.

192
00:15:10,638 --> 00:15:17,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Our gold medal winner, and I'm going to announce them, and if those individuals could please come up so I can announce you formally.

193
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,181
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you love this part.

194
00:15:19,803 --> 00:15:20,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

195
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:22,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on up.

196
00:15:22,444 --> 00:15:24,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

197
00:15:25,784 --> 00:15:27,345
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have three of the medal winners.

198
00:15:27,565 --> 00:15:32,386
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the fourth one, he's been up here so much in the last two years that maybe he didn't want to come today.

199
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:38,187
[SPEAKER_08]: But we have a gold medal winner, Valerie Sajus from Masonry.

200
00:15:43,848 --> 00:15:48,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Valerie's a grade 11 student in the Construction and Craft Laborers Program.

201
00:15:50,038 --> 00:15:54,981
[SPEAKER_08]: In second place, winning a silver medal, we have Megan Follis in cosmetology.

202
00:16:02,386 --> 00:16:08,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Winning a silver medal third year in a row, Sukran Saji in graphic communications.

203
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,991
[SPEAKER_08]: He is not with us today.

204
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:22,000
[SPEAKER_08]: The second medal, or the last medal winner is Karan Debel, and he is a state officer candidate.

205
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:29,382
[SPEAKER_08]: As you know, we had our first state officer candidate as well as a state officer for the last three years in Isaac Cardoso.

206
00:16:29,662 --> 00:16:36,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Isaac is a senior in the electrical program, and he has mentored Karan Debel as well as another student.

207
00:16:38,105 --> 00:16:40,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Kathleen Kreatz, Noah Kreatz.

208
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:49,342
[SPEAKER_08]: We sent two people, and we did get one state officer candidate, and that is Karan Debel, who is a junior in our construction program.

209
00:16:54,849 --> 00:17:01,171
[SPEAKER_08]: In addition to these two medal winners, or these four medal winners, we would like to take two teams to the state competition.

210
00:17:01,871 --> 00:17:06,692
[SPEAKER_08]: The first team is a community service team, where members are partnered with Boston Cares.

211
00:17:07,312 --> 00:17:11,873
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a community service organization that pairs companies with service opportunities.

212
00:17:12,973 --> 00:17:23,396
[SPEAKER_08]: On Wednesday, March 9, members will be helping Boston Cares assemble and paint toddler beds that were prepared by the carpentry and construction and craft laborers students.

213
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:30,780
[SPEAKER_08]: The toddler beds will then be distributed to families that are transitioning from homeless to having their own residence.

214
00:17:32,121 --> 00:17:35,123
[SPEAKER_08]: The second team we will be sending is a non-traditional team.

215
00:17:35,984 --> 00:17:40,026
[SPEAKER_08]: This team will consist of students who are in non-traditional career pathways.

216
00:17:41,007 --> 00:17:48,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Their role will be to develop a business plan in increasing awareness and enrollment in non-traditional career and technical education programs.

217
00:17:49,982 --> 00:18:00,166
[SPEAKER_08]: MVTHS is seeking partial financial assistance for this state competition, as they will be fundraising on March 16th at Margarita's to defray the costs.

218
00:18:01,286 --> 00:18:12,130
[SPEAKER_08]: We are also seeking approval to attend an overnight trip for the competition on April 28th, 29th, and 30th, and would like to invite all of you to the opening ceremonies on April 28th.

219
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:15,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

220
00:18:15,668 --> 00:18:16,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Van der Kloot.

221
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:26,014
[SPEAKER_03]: First, I'd like to congratulate all the students who attended the competition results, and you've done a great job and represent us well.

222
00:18:27,054 --> 00:18:30,836
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of the competition, could you tell us where it is?

223
00:18:32,117 --> 00:18:32,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

224
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:36,379
[SPEAKER_08]: It is held annually at the Best Western Expo Center in Marlborough, Massachusetts.

225
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,822
[SPEAKER_03]: So in terms of, will the students be staying overnight?

226
00:18:41,547 --> 00:18:43,428
[SPEAKER_08]: They do stay over for two evenings.

227
00:18:43,588 --> 00:18:47,810
[SPEAKER_08]: The opening ceremony is on the Thursday evening after April school vacation.

228
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,591
[SPEAKER_08]: The competition day is Friday, and the award ceremony is on Saturday morning.

229
00:18:53,472 --> 00:18:55,273
[SPEAKER_03]: How much does it cost for a student to attend?

230
00:18:56,173 --> 00:19:01,875
[SPEAKER_08]: The total package with all of the teams, as well as the advisors and the students, will be approximately $5,000.

231
00:19:03,636 --> 00:19:07,878
[SPEAKER_08]: The students themselves would like to defray the cost of 50% of that competition.

232
00:19:09,018 --> 00:19:09,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

233
00:19:09,258 --> 00:19:11,019
[SPEAKER_03]: And I see that you have the fundraiser

234
00:19:11,503 --> 00:19:13,184
[SPEAKER_03]: which hopefully will make a lot of that money.

235
00:19:14,324 --> 00:19:27,769
[SPEAKER_08]: But... Seeing the people in the audience, I'm sure they're all more than willing to come on March 16th to support the SkillsUSA because 20% of the total bill actually is given to the SkillsUSA students.

236
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:36,613
[SPEAKER_08]: However, we have done three other fundraisers over the course of the school year in addition to the road race.

237
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,586
[SPEAKER_08]: with Judy Lonergan.

238
00:19:41,106 --> 00:19:45,067
[SPEAKER_08]: We have also done a couple different fundraisers, and we also have a raffle going on.

239
00:19:45,127 --> 00:19:46,667
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're fairly confident.

240
00:19:46,707 --> 00:19:51,508
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have some money in our account as an activity account that we'll be using as well.

241
00:19:52,048 --> 00:19:52,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

242
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:56,189
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a motion to approve.

243
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,450
[SPEAKER_03]: How many students do you think you'll be taking?

244
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Each team consists of four students.

245
00:20:00,931 --> 00:20:02,131
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's eight plus four.

246
00:20:02,171 --> 00:20:02,811
[SPEAKER_08]: That's 12.

247
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:04,251
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we have three advisors.

248
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:04,672
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

249
00:20:04,892 --> 00:20:06,612
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to make a motion to approve

250
00:20:07,487 --> 00:20:11,749
[SPEAKER_03]: the overnight trip to SkillsUSA.

251
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Mr. Skerry.

252
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:15,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

253
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:16,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Cuno.

254
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:24,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I just basically wanted to say, like I've said in the past, thank you to you, your administration, but really basically to thank the students.

255
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:26,395
[SPEAKER_07]: You have shined.

256
00:20:27,155 --> 00:20:28,156
[SPEAKER_07]: You have made us proud.

257
00:20:28,985 --> 00:20:30,686
[SPEAKER_07]: And I am now going to put you on the spot.

258
00:20:31,206 --> 00:20:32,667
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is, I want to hear from you.

259
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:34,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to hear what skills means to you.

260
00:20:34,848 --> 00:20:38,089
[SPEAKER_07]: What has it changed since freshman year to now?

261
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:42,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Because when we didn't have it, and I want to see what answer you can give me.

262
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:51,756
[SPEAKER_12]: For me, it's competition and an organization to help myself get better.

263
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,111
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's for value.

264
00:20:57,151 --> 00:20:57,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, it's for competition.

265
00:20:58,011 --> 00:21:00,492
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, I feel like I like to help people.

266
00:21:00,532 --> 00:21:07,355
[SPEAKER_01]: So running for state office, it's helping everyone in Massachusetts and the vocational school reach the potential that they didn't know that they can reach.

267
00:21:09,976 --> 00:21:13,458
[SPEAKER_19]: It helped me learn a lot about my trade and what we have to do.

268
00:21:15,638 --> 00:21:15,999
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

269
00:21:25,188 --> 00:21:25,749
[SPEAKER_07]: what we want.

270
00:21:25,949 --> 00:21:29,173
[SPEAKER_07]: We want these types of programs to bring you out there.

271
00:21:29,253 --> 00:21:32,997
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to educate you, but we want to educate other people that you meet.

272
00:21:33,217 --> 00:21:35,259
[SPEAKER_07]: And the networking is really important.

273
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:40,325
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you go out and you represent yourselves, you're also representing the city of Medford.

274
00:21:40,796 --> 00:21:46,698
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're representing every student in that school, whether it be on the vocational side, per se, or the high school side.

275
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:49,479
[SPEAKER_07]: You're representing all of us that are sitting behind here.

276
00:21:49,879 --> 00:21:50,879
[SPEAKER_07]: You're representing the mayor.

277
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:52,320
[SPEAKER_07]: You're representing yourselves.

278
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:57,761
[SPEAKER_07]: So hold your heads up high, because you've done an extremely wonderful job in these last three years.

279
00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:05,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Skerry?

280
00:22:06,561 --> 00:22:10,422
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to offer your kids the best of luck in your competitions in Marlboro.

281
00:22:10,442 --> 00:22:12,623
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll be out to see you and keep up the good work.

282
00:22:13,703 --> 00:22:19,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it still Kansas City for the gold?

283
00:22:19,165 --> 00:22:21,566
[SPEAKER_08]: They actually change it to Louisville, Kentucky.

284
00:22:22,086 --> 00:22:22,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Kentucky.

285
00:22:22,887 --> 00:22:23,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

286
00:22:23,707 --> 00:22:24,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

287
00:22:25,227 --> 00:22:26,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Benedetto.

288
00:22:26,908 --> 00:22:27,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

289
00:22:27,688 --> 00:22:29,389
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to comment on

290
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:50,676
[SPEAKER_10]: The team that's going as a community service team and really what that means to the homeless people that they're serving, because when you presented this to us a few weeks ago, you commented that people transitioning from shelters to homes can't get into their homes without a bed for every child.

291
00:22:51,176 --> 00:22:54,479
[SPEAKER_10]: So Medford High School vocational students are

292
00:22:55,772 --> 00:23:03,194
[SPEAKER_10]: building these beds and making them in kits so that way these people have the chance to transition in.

293
00:23:03,775 --> 00:23:12,057
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a great opportunity not only for them to learn the skill that they're at the school to learn, but to learn to give back to the community.

294
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:22,041
[SPEAKER_10]: I applaud this and I'm so grateful to see that our students have this opportunity and that they must feel a big heart when they're also building these things.

295
00:23:22,121 --> 00:23:23,181
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope that they get that.

296
00:23:23,545 --> 00:23:25,926
[SPEAKER_10]: how much it impacts those students' lives.

297
00:23:25,966 --> 00:23:34,369
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you get to see that firsthand put together in an apartment, but it's really, really great community work.

298
00:23:34,889 --> 00:23:40,531
[SPEAKER_10]: And I applaud your whole community for being a part of it.

299
00:23:41,151 --> 00:23:43,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for doing that and representing us well.

300
00:23:43,913 --> 00:23:44,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

301
00:23:44,393 --> 00:23:44,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

302
00:23:45,734 --> 00:23:50,818
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion on the floor for approval for the overnight stay for 12 students and three chaperones, I believe.

303
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:53,721
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor, roll call vote, please.

304
00:23:53,901 --> 00:23:54,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call vote, please.

305
00:23:54,702 --> 00:23:54,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

306
00:23:55,963 --> 00:23:56,463
[SPEAKER_13]: Cuno.

307
00:23:57,043 --> 00:23:57,244
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

308
00:23:57,404 --> 00:23:57,464
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

309
00:23:57,524 --> 00:23:58,044
[SPEAKER_13]: Benedetto.

310
00:23:58,184 --> 00:23:58,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

311
00:23:58,505 --> 00:23:58,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

312
00:23:58,745 --> 00:23:58,965
[SPEAKER_13]: Prentz.

313
00:23:58,985 --> 00:23:59,085
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

314
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:00,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

315
00:24:00,086 --> 00:24:00,386
[SPEAKER_13]: Costone.

316
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:00,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

317
00:24:00,586 --> 00:24:01,427
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Heria.

318
00:24:01,467 --> 00:24:01,647
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

319
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:01,787
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

320
00:24:01,847 --> 00:24:02,408
[SPEAKER_13]: Campbell.

321
00:24:02,448 --> 00:24:02,588
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

322
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:02,728
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

323
00:24:02,848 --> 00:24:03,348
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayberg.

324
00:24:03,488 --> 00:24:03,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

325
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:05,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven in the affirmative, nine in the negative.

326
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,191
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

327
00:24:09,509 --> 00:24:16,059
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also a second report offered by the Medford Vocational Technical High School regarding the Environmental Science Program approval.

328
00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:17,220
[SPEAKER_09]: She did make a comment.

329
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to add a little more to this?

330
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:31,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, just that I would like to thank Mr. Charles Saulnier and Mr. Norm Russo, as well as the Director of Science, Rocco Sieri, for allowing us, or working really hard to get this approval done.

331
00:24:31,535 --> 00:24:40,458
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we've waited a year for it because of a licensed instructor, and that was the only thing that was holding us back from actually getting a full approval.

332
00:24:40,598 --> 00:24:49,222
[SPEAKER_08]: So what it means to our students is that they have the opportunity to gain college credit at state university systems, as well as community college,

333
00:24:49,805 --> 00:24:52,607
[SPEAKER_08]: in the environmental science trade area.

334
00:24:52,627 --> 00:24:54,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

335
00:24:54,408 --> 00:24:54,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Van der Kloot.

336
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,790
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a tremendously exciting area.

337
00:24:58,251 --> 00:25:08,758
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so happy that our students are going to have this advantage and congratulate all of those who were involved, including yourself, Heidi, for making sure that this moved forward and is now before us tonight.

338
00:25:10,158 --> 00:25:10,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

339
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:11,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Great job.

340
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

341
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:23,970
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion on the floor to revert to the regular visits by Mr. Skerry.

342
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:24,771
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

343
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:26,091
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

344
00:25:26,531 --> 00:25:27,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion carries.

345
00:25:27,312 --> 00:25:29,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Recommendation to approve school calendar 2016-17.

346
00:25:29,352 --> 00:25:33,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval.

347
00:25:34,714 --> 00:25:36,035
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you want to know anything about it?

348
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what about the primary?

349
00:25:37,976 --> 00:25:38,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a primary?

350
00:25:39,316 --> 00:25:40,017
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't know.

351
00:25:40,637 --> 00:25:41,777
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have it on the calendar.

352
00:25:41,817 --> 00:25:42,257
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't know.

353
00:25:42,277 --> 00:25:46,999
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't have a, you know, we haven't scheduled a day off for it because we think it's usually very, very late.

354
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:49,140
[SPEAKER_11]: You have no idea who's- It used to be a state primary.

355
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:58,113
[SPEAKER_17]: So we didn't want to just interrupt the flow of the days because that first day, Monday, is Labor Day.

356
00:25:58,153 --> 00:26:01,654
[SPEAKER_17]: Then if you have the next Thursday off, you've got two days off in that week.

357
00:26:02,214 --> 00:26:05,355
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're going to play it by ear, but I think it probably will be in session.

358
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:08,516
[SPEAKER_17]: But if you want more detail, we can go over it.

359
00:26:08,576 --> 00:26:10,997
[SPEAKER_17]: Otherwise, if you're happy with it, we'll just look for your approval.

360
00:26:11,017 --> 00:26:13,638
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion on the floor to accept this report and place it on file.

361
00:26:13,678 --> 00:26:14,358
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

362
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:16,282
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed.

363
00:26:19,225 --> 00:26:31,657
[SPEAKER_07]: With all due respect, I think the superintendent should at least explain a little bit because there are a lot of parents in our audience and also a lot of parents that are watching that this is very, it's very important that they know why the reasons are.

364
00:26:33,078 --> 00:26:33,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

365
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:33,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Nelson.

366
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,100
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

367
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:39,705
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be more than glad to explain some of the rationale for our dates.

368
00:26:40,688 --> 00:26:45,733
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the reasons why we're very anxious to get this approved is because we'd like to get it out publicly.

369
00:26:45,793 --> 00:26:56,542
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a major change that was brought about by the new teacher's contract, and that is the start from this point on for this particular contract will be before Labor Day.

370
00:26:57,523 --> 00:27:02,748
[SPEAKER_15]: Previously, the school, the contract said the teachers could not return before September 1st.

371
00:27:03,228 --> 00:27:07,272
[SPEAKER_15]: This changes the whole schedule of when they do return.

372
00:27:07,912 --> 00:27:13,756
[SPEAKER_15]: For this year, they're going to be returning teachers on August 29th, which is a Monday.

373
00:27:14,456 --> 00:27:19,120
[SPEAKER_15]: The contract is also very prescriptive in terms of what that first week looks like.

374
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,481
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, this is all contractual language.

375
00:27:22,021 --> 00:27:36,091
[SPEAKER_15]: Teachers return on the 29th for their opening day of meetings, and the students will be in school starting, these are grades one through 12, August 30th, which is Tuesday,

376
00:27:37,148 --> 00:27:40,869
[SPEAKER_15]: 31st, which is Wednesday, and September 1st, which is Thursday.

377
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:50,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Friday, September 2nd, which is the Friday before Labor Day, there will be no school in session for teachers or students.

378
00:27:50,612 --> 00:27:52,532
[SPEAKER_15]: Labor Day falls on September 5th.

379
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:55,833
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, no school for students and teachers.

380
00:27:56,393 --> 00:28:03,975
[SPEAKER_15]: And then teachers and students return on the 6th, Tuesday, with kindergarten starting the next day on Wednesday.

381
00:28:04,503 --> 00:28:10,765
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, that way students have three full days of school before Labor Day takes place.

382
00:28:11,545 --> 00:28:19,327
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, we want to get this out because I know many families do plan vacations for that particular week before Labor Day.

383
00:28:19,747 --> 00:28:29,130
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, principals have gotten the word out by their website's word of mouth, but we can't put the calendar formally on the website until it is approved by the committee.

384
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:33,331
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, we'd like to hopefully we have that approval tonight.

385
00:28:34,675 --> 00:28:41,898
[SPEAKER_15]: The school calendar provides for five snow days, if we need them, with the closing of June 21st.

386
00:28:42,498 --> 00:28:50,061
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, the vacations and holidays follow those recommended by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

387
00:28:51,061 --> 00:28:57,584
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have early release days for middle and high school, which are also indicated on the calendar.

388
00:28:59,025 --> 00:29:02,586
[SPEAKER_15]: The contract calls for two mandated days of professional development.

389
00:29:03,157 --> 00:29:08,180
[SPEAKER_15]: We have scheduled one for November 8th, which is the national election day.

390
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,142
[SPEAKER_15]: And the second we've held off on for a variety of different reasons.

391
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:25,089
[SPEAKER_15]: The superintendent alluded to the fact that if we were to have one of those days on one of the election days, the primaries, it would be a major interruption to the flow of the first few weeks.

392
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:29,851
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, we feel that we can handle that election while still having school in session.

393
00:29:30,332 --> 00:29:32,613
[SPEAKER_15]: And we can give you some of our details about that.

394
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:36,528
[SPEAKER_15]: We also found that this year we did the same thing.

395
00:29:36,548 --> 00:29:44,374
[SPEAKER_15]: We held off on scheduling the second day because a lot happens that we need that day for as the year evolves.

396
00:29:44,434 --> 00:29:47,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, we have some major things going on next school year.

397
00:29:48,877 --> 00:29:52,519
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the things is that we have a new professional development committee.

398
00:29:53,060 --> 00:30:02,006
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, by contract, we have now teachers and administrators, a team of 12, working together to develop professional development offerings.

399
00:30:02,577 --> 00:30:05,139
[SPEAKER_15]: And one of those offerings would be on the mandated day.

400
00:30:05,619 --> 00:30:08,220
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'd like to give that committee time to get up and running.

401
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:19,667
[SPEAKER_15]: They're starting to meet for the first time another week or so, and then they'll have regular meetings and plan activities for both the early release days as well as the mandated days.

402
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:29,613
[SPEAKER_15]: So having them have some time to adjust to what they want to do and kind of looking at all the initiatives coming up, we find that we felt that having the day

403
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:32,466
[SPEAKER_15]: a little later in the school year could be beneficial.

404
00:30:33,586 --> 00:30:35,787
[SPEAKER_15]: We also are dealing with the new state test.

405
00:30:36,607 --> 00:30:41,469
[SPEAKER_15]: MCAS 2.0 is currently in the developmental stages.

406
00:30:41,629 --> 00:30:46,691
[SPEAKER_15]: We have been told by DESE that it will be fully implemented by spring 2017.

407
00:30:48,912 --> 00:30:51,533
[SPEAKER_15]: We have very few details about this test right now.

408
00:30:51,593 --> 00:30:55,234
[SPEAKER_15]: We know that it's going to be different than the traditional MCAS.

409
00:30:55,294 --> 00:30:57,275
[SPEAKER_15]: We know there are going to be park-like questions,

410
00:30:57,958 --> 00:31:00,859
[SPEAKER_15]: But the state has been very slow to give us different details.

411
00:31:00,979 --> 00:31:05,520
[SPEAKER_15]: And quite honestly, many committees are still meeting to develop this test.

412
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:12,401
[SPEAKER_15]: So we anticipate that starting in the fall, we're going to have more and more information emerging about this test.

413
00:31:12,481 --> 00:31:19,783
[SPEAKER_15]: And we may need a PD day, or at least part of a PD day, to work with our teachers on getting our students ready for this test.

414
00:31:20,223 --> 00:31:23,024
[SPEAKER_15]: So at this point, we have very little information on that.

415
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:37,951
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the additional items in the new contract is that the early release Wednesdays now, four of them are for mandated PD, which is a tremendous gain we feel for us because we need that time.

416
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:48,618
[SPEAKER_15]: And as we begin our mandated days of PD, half days of PD, what we're envisioning is that some of those will roll over to topics for the full day.

417
00:31:49,118 --> 00:31:54,242
[SPEAKER_15]: So as we get those going in the fall, they may generate with the Professional Development Committee

418
00:31:54,715 --> 00:31:57,716
[SPEAKER_15]: some great ideas for the full day of professional development.

419
00:31:58,877 --> 00:32:02,198
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the things that, as you know, we had our PD day on Tuesday.

420
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:06,320
[SPEAKER_15]: It was, we feel very successful from the initial feedback we got.

421
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:14,264
[SPEAKER_15]: And one of the things that we were able to gather from the data from the teachers is what they would like additionally on topics.

422
00:32:14,364 --> 00:32:23,728
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, having PD, letting teachers evaluate it, letting them make suggestions will help us to plan for a full day later in the school year.

423
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,762
[SPEAKER_15]: So those are all some of the reasons why we'd like to hold off.

424
00:32:27,782 --> 00:32:28,943
[SPEAKER_15]: It worked well this year.

425
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:32,645
[SPEAKER_15]: We were able to schedule our second day last Tuesday.

426
00:32:33,305 --> 00:32:38,528
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, it was something that we had a lot of time to plan for, and I think went very well.

427
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:50,855
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, you know, the idea of we can get this on the website tomorrow would be great for families to plan and everybody to know all the information.

428
00:32:50,955 --> 00:32:52,376
[SPEAKER_15]: So if I can answer any questions.

429
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:53,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Benedetto.

430
00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:04,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Through you, Mayor Burke, to the superintendent, could we get a press release out quickly about the new school calendar for next year, as soon as it's approved?

431
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:15,194
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I already noticed that some parents had been making comments on the Method Yahoo group about they thought last year's early start was a one-time thing.

432
00:33:15,641 --> 00:33:19,924
[SPEAKER_10]: So we need to really get the word out to them and communicate in every way possible.

433
00:33:19,944 --> 00:33:21,906
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll put it on our webpage right away, you know what I mean?

434
00:33:21,926 --> 00:33:23,367
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we'll send stuff through the buildings.

435
00:33:24,028 --> 00:33:24,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

436
00:33:24,428 --> 00:33:28,451
[SPEAKER_10]: And can we also send it out through the local papers so parents can see it?

437
00:33:28,932 --> 00:33:29,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

438
00:33:30,387 --> 00:33:30,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Miss Gugno.

439
00:33:33,368 --> 00:33:36,049
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to double check and make sure that I have the correct dates.

440
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:40,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually we start the kindergartners a week after the older kids start.

441
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:43,672
[SPEAKER_07]: So is kindergarten starting on 9-7 this year?

442
00:33:44,053 --> 00:33:44,213
[SPEAKER_07]: 7th.

443
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:45,073
[SPEAKER_07]: The 7th.

444
00:33:45,693 --> 00:33:45,933
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

445
00:33:46,494 --> 00:33:54,417
[SPEAKER_07]: And you also mentioned that the professional four half days, the Wednesdays, are going to be used for mandated professional days.

446
00:33:54,437 --> 00:33:54,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

447
00:33:55,175 --> 00:33:59,698
[SPEAKER_07]: So will students be told that they can't stay after school on those days, or how are they going to work those out?

448
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:04,481
[SPEAKER_15]: They generally, the buses come at the dismissal time, which is the half day.

449
00:34:04,521 --> 00:34:07,583
[SPEAKER_15]: So most of our students do not stay.

450
00:34:08,724 --> 00:34:12,346
[SPEAKER_15]: It's basically a day where teachers stay in the building.

451
00:34:12,386 --> 00:34:14,147
[SPEAKER_15]: They work on their own topics.

452
00:34:14,207 --> 00:34:17,209
[SPEAKER_15]: We do have volunteer professional development.

453
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:22,973
[SPEAKER_15]: For those of you who know the history of those days, all of the early release days at one time were mandated.

454
00:34:23,475 --> 00:34:25,196
[SPEAKER_15]: professional development for teachers.

455
00:34:25,436 --> 00:34:35,843
[SPEAKER_15]: And in contract negotiations through the years, I think it was in the 90s, part of the negotiation was the teachers wanted those days for their own work time.

456
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:46,911
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, PD from that point on was offered voluntarily, but it was very hard to do something that you wanted to do system-wide because people were not mandated.

457
00:34:46,991 --> 00:34:49,233
[SPEAKER_15]: So some people had this knowledge and some did not.

458
00:34:49,793 --> 00:34:52,735
[SPEAKER_15]: So we felt, we worked on the contract a big,

459
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:56,592
[SPEAKER_15]: piece of what we did, our work this summer, was on PD.

460
00:34:56,632 --> 00:35:01,916
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that everybody walked away pretty happy, both teachers and the administration, on some of the gains.

461
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:08,501
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we've done is we've kind of gotten half of what we originally had, mandated time back again.

462
00:35:09,002 --> 00:35:11,684
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're very, you know, we're very happy about that.

463
00:35:11,784 --> 00:35:22,992
[SPEAKER_15]: There are very, there are topics already that the union wants us to work on, dealing with the teacher evaluation, standards one and two, which is curriculum and instruction, and teaching all students.

464
00:35:23,382 --> 00:35:25,243
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have some ideas of where we want to go.

465
00:35:25,303 --> 00:35:36,607
[SPEAKER_15]: But having the committee, I think, will be very helpful, because it's nice to have input from the teachers and from the administrators, instead of just our team of administrators planning the day.

466
00:35:37,087 --> 00:35:40,349
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, we're looking forward to that team generating some great ideas.

467
00:35:40,949 --> 00:35:43,590
[SPEAKER_07]: And this pertains just to the elementary school teachers?

468
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:47,351
[SPEAKER_15]: The middle and high school have the half day, four day mandated.

469
00:35:47,711 --> 00:35:50,232
[SPEAKER_15]: The elementary, they do have one, I think, Wednesday.

470
00:35:50,272 --> 00:35:51,613
[SPEAKER_15]: Diane, if you want to speak to that.

471
00:35:53,209 --> 00:35:56,851
[SPEAKER_21]: So the elementary schools every Wednesday have early release at 1.30.

472
00:35:57,231 --> 00:36:03,654
[SPEAKER_21]: The first and third Wednesdays are for elementary principals to have their staff meetings.

473
00:36:04,194 --> 00:36:12,477
[SPEAKER_21]: The second Wednesday is usually for directors, for instance, director of Title I or ELL or special education to meet with their staff.

474
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:20,821
[SPEAKER_21]: We worked with the union to take the fourth Wednesday of each month for the elementaries to do some professional development.

475
00:36:20,981 --> 00:36:22,662
[SPEAKER_21]: Once again, the PD committee will work

476
00:36:23,277 --> 00:36:28,601
[SPEAKER_21]: on specific topics related to the first two standards.

477
00:36:28,741 --> 00:36:33,265
[SPEAKER_21]: So the elementary teachers will be dismissed at the regular time at 1.30.

478
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:38,008
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll go to an elementary school and receive some professional development.

479
00:36:38,428 --> 00:36:38,809
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good.

480
00:36:39,069 --> 00:36:39,889
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really good.

481
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

482
00:36:41,531 --> 00:36:41,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

483
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:43,712
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion on the floor for approval by Ms.

484
00:36:43,732 --> 00:36:45,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Disceri, seconded by Ms.

485
00:36:45,153 --> 00:36:45,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot.

486
00:36:46,214 --> 00:36:47,035
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

487
00:36:48,056 --> 00:36:48,656
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

488
00:36:48,676 --> 00:36:49,537
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

489
00:36:51,196 --> 00:36:56,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Paper number three, update report on online payment system and TransFinder bus system.

490
00:36:57,098 --> 00:37:05,220
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, we're going to ask our Director of Finance and Administration, Pat Feely, to bring you up to date on the new systems that we've implemented this year.

491
00:37:06,181 --> 00:37:06,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

492
00:37:07,341 --> 00:37:13,283
[SPEAKER_06]: So July 1st, we initiated online payments to the request of all of our parents, and it's been well received.

493
00:37:14,103 --> 00:37:16,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Online payments are the way to go.

494
00:37:16,824 --> 00:37:18,685
[SPEAKER_06]: It is dual control at its finest.

495
00:37:19,305 --> 00:37:19,825
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easy.

496
00:37:20,508 --> 00:37:22,710
[SPEAKER_06]: And it really provides us a lot of feedback.

497
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:24,431
[SPEAKER_06]: We can have access to a lot of reports.

498
00:37:25,132 --> 00:37:27,673
[SPEAKER_06]: The online options have been well received by the parents.

499
00:37:27,693 --> 00:37:29,575
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll see by the figures below on your report.

500
00:37:30,656 --> 00:37:36,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Beginning FY17, paying by check or cash will no longer be an option for fee-based programs.

501
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:42,344
[SPEAKER_06]: We gave them the option this year to work with them and to get them through the hurdle of learning the system.

502
00:37:43,598 --> 00:37:49,262
[SPEAKER_06]: As the months have gone by, we've seen more and more parents go on to the MC and the FACS.

503
00:37:49,843 --> 00:37:57,288
[SPEAKER_06]: And they've, once they get over that hurdle, and I've walked a few of them through it, that, you know, it's really easy, and it's cheaper than a money order.

504
00:37:58,269 --> 00:38:07,917
[SPEAKER_06]: So FACS is our online payment for programs that have a set tuition payment plan, including all of our preschool program, Kids' Corner, before school programming.

505
00:38:08,337 --> 00:38:12,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And this next year, it will include after school programming, which is also tuition based.

506
00:38:13,161 --> 00:38:16,902
[SPEAKER_06]: The cost is $43 annually to run the program.

507
00:38:17,402 --> 00:38:20,383
[SPEAKER_06]: We charge a registration fee that covers that expense.

508
00:38:21,204 --> 00:38:26,585
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the cost to the family is $0.25 for an ACH or 3% for credit card.

509
00:38:27,466 --> 00:38:30,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of our parents are using ACH for your own purposes.

510
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:36,309
[SPEAKER_06]: The initial year of this program allowed families the option of online payment or sending in a check.

511
00:38:36,649 --> 00:38:39,950
[SPEAKER_06]: We only accepted checks from those people who did not have any issues.

512
00:38:40,827 --> 00:38:44,450
[SPEAKER_06]: And twice a month, FACTS wires NPS the funds collected through the online portal.

513
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:48,133
[SPEAKER_06]: To date, we've collected over $403,000 through the online portal.

514
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:56,439
[SPEAKER_06]: MCC is our other online payment option, which is the portal that the city uses for all their fees, taxes.

515
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,022
[SPEAKER_06]: And because of that, the city helps us run that program.

516
00:39:00,522 --> 00:39:07,688
[SPEAKER_06]: The cost to our customers for making payments is the same for FACTS, $0.25 for an ACH or checking account, 3% for credit card.

517
00:39:08,565 --> 00:39:13,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Both those fees on fax and MCC is retained by the company as the cost of doing business.

518
00:39:14,887 --> 00:39:16,748
[SPEAKER_06]: MCC, we're making a change this year.

519
00:39:16,848 --> 00:39:23,711
[SPEAKER_06]: We're actually updating the portal to accept registration forms, which will help our programs like summer fun camp and summer school.

520
00:39:24,371 --> 00:39:27,352
[SPEAKER_06]: The parents can actually register while paying the fee.

521
00:39:27,952 --> 00:39:33,934
[SPEAKER_06]: The portal actually will provide a registration report for the person running the program.

522
00:39:34,275 --> 00:39:35,495
[SPEAKER_06]: And so everything will be on that.

523
00:39:36,364 --> 00:39:39,247
[SPEAKER_06]: And to date, that's collected $386,000 in fees.

524
00:39:40,448 --> 00:39:45,332
[SPEAKER_06]: The newest program to our fleet this year will be the Transfinder RoutePro.

525
00:39:46,373 --> 00:39:48,034
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a new program.

526
00:39:48,554 --> 00:39:51,677
[SPEAKER_06]: And the superintendent is fully backing me on this one.

527
00:39:51,717 --> 00:39:54,279
[SPEAKER_06]: It provides a lot of safety options.

528
00:39:54,820 --> 00:40:00,865
[SPEAKER_06]: To date, we really don't have a school bus rider list, except for those generated by the schools.

529
00:40:01,505 --> 00:40:04,228
[SPEAKER_06]: This company will actually generate all the information

530
00:40:04,877 --> 00:40:09,319
[SPEAKER_06]: based on the information that we feed them, such as our routes, our student rosters.

531
00:40:09,479 --> 00:40:10,759
[SPEAKER_06]: It's highly confidential.

532
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:12,740
[SPEAKER_06]: None of this information is shared anywhere.

533
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,961
[SPEAKER_06]: We will have real-time knowledge of who is on our bus.

534
00:40:17,401 --> 00:40:21,043
[SPEAKER_06]: So if there is an accident, we will know what riders are still there.

535
00:40:21,523 --> 00:40:25,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if it's done 11 stops, we'll still know who's sitting on the bus.

536
00:40:26,784 --> 00:40:29,545
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can analyze what-if scenarios.

537
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:34,127
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we find that, like this last year, we had all this construction,

538
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:41,043
[SPEAKER_06]: What can we do to get the bus to the route at the right time without stopping and then analyzing?

539
00:40:41,403 --> 00:40:42,644
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually real time.

540
00:40:42,724 --> 00:40:46,705
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can go on to the system and I can say, High Street is closed from here to here.

541
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:48,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Reroute the bus.

542
00:40:48,826 --> 00:40:49,387
[SPEAKER_06]: And it does it.

543
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:50,647
[SPEAKER_06]: All right?

544
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:56,830
[SPEAKER_06]: The cost of the first year is just under $10,000, which includes $4,400 of implementation costs.

545
00:40:57,551 --> 00:41:02,593
[SPEAKER_06]: MPS has not held this contract past the first year and can either increase or decrease services as needed.

546
00:41:03,499 --> 00:41:07,983
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've spoke with Eastern Bus Company, and they're fully behind us operating this route finder.

547
00:41:09,444 --> 00:41:10,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions?

548
00:41:10,504 --> 00:41:12,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a quick, the second year cost?

549
00:41:13,126 --> 00:41:15,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Second year cost will be just around $5,000.

550
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:18,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

551
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Cugno, and then Ms.

552
00:41:19,551 --> 00:41:19,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Mustone.

553
00:41:20,932 --> 00:41:21,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Ms.

554
00:41:21,553 --> 00:41:21,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Duda.

555
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:22,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Brief report.

556
00:41:24,455 --> 00:41:28,338
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that we don't have the SCTs and the PSETs to pay for anymore, so that's a good thing.

557
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:34,653
[SPEAKER_07]: But how about guidance Councilors, like especially the seniors that have to pay for transcripts and things like that?

558
00:41:35,134 --> 00:41:38,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Is any of that included into this type of payment plan?

559
00:41:38,636 --> 00:41:41,718
[SPEAKER_06]: This year we did AP testing, which was a huge success.

560
00:41:41,778 --> 00:41:45,080
[SPEAKER_06]: We did over $7,000 in AP online payments.

561
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:50,843
[SPEAKER_06]: And we do have it set up out there for driver's ed for lost textbook fees.

562
00:41:51,503 --> 00:41:52,984
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm willing to add anything they want.

563
00:41:53,024 --> 00:41:53,885
[SPEAKER_06]: They just have to ask.

564
00:41:54,205 --> 00:42:04,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so I think it would be a good idea maybe if we could, through you to the superintendent, maybe ask the guidance council department to get in touch with Ms.

565
00:42:04,633 --> 00:42:13,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Beeler about, especially seniors that need like transcripts, because the students have to pay for transcripts and they have to pay for different things, especially when they're applying to colleges.

566
00:42:13,901 --> 00:42:20,085
[SPEAKER_07]: So instead of bringing in checks and money orders, if we could do it like that, it would be a lot easier.

567
00:42:20,786 --> 00:42:23,148
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other thing I was gonna ask you is the buses,

568
00:42:25,441 --> 00:42:33,187
[SPEAKER_07]: the students that pay for their bus fees, that they buy the MBTA cards, would that be involved and incorporated in this, or does that have to still count?

569
00:42:33,247 --> 00:42:33,907
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm working on it.

570
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:35,408
[SPEAKER_06]: It has a few more twists and turns.

571
00:42:35,768 --> 00:42:38,610
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not as easy because we do go through another vendor for those.

572
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:44,094
[SPEAKER_06]: The MBTA sends us the passes, we sell them, then we transfer the money back to them.

573
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:45,335
[SPEAKER_06]: But I am working on it.

574
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:46,376
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, thank you.

575
00:42:47,577 --> 00:42:47,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

576
00:42:47,757 --> 00:42:48,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Mustone.

577
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:52,160
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a preschooler, so I love the FACTS online program.

578
00:42:52,827 --> 00:42:57,389
[SPEAKER_05]: But the fax one costs $43 annually and the MCC doesn't have an annual cost.

579
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:01,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a reason why the fax programs can't go to the MCC programs?

580
00:43:02,512 --> 00:43:04,053
[SPEAKER_06]: The MCC does have a cost.

581
00:43:04,113 --> 00:43:08,475
[SPEAKER_06]: The city takes care of it for us because it is their preference.

582
00:43:09,536 --> 00:43:11,157
[SPEAKER_06]: So could the fax go to the city as well?

583
00:43:11,557 --> 00:43:11,717
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

584
00:43:12,077 --> 00:43:15,619
[SPEAKER_06]: And the fax is different because it actually has an invoice system.

585
00:43:16,479 --> 00:43:18,100
[SPEAKER_06]: MCC does not.

586
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,701
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only set up to accept a fee.

587
00:43:20,592 --> 00:43:25,837
[SPEAKER_06]: So the facts, once you set it up, as you well know, you get your tuition divided by 10 payments.

588
00:43:25,897 --> 00:43:27,979
[SPEAKER_06]: It's taken on the date that you select each month.

589
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:28,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

590
00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:39,869
[SPEAKER_05]: And then for the bus, um, also with five of mine who take a bus, is the cost after year two, 5,000, the same year three, or does it decrease the longer we use their program?

591
00:43:40,029 --> 00:43:47,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, by the time we get into year three, we're probably not going to need as many facets of it because we will have established so much of our parameters.

592
00:43:47,977 --> 00:43:49,858
[SPEAKER_06]: But the first year, you know, is big.

593
00:43:49,898 --> 00:43:50,659
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot of work.

594
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:52,840
[SPEAKER_06]: And then year two is a little less work.

595
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:57,323
[SPEAKER_06]: And then year three, we'll evaluate at that time and see if we need what we have at that time.

596
00:43:57,403 --> 00:43:57,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

597
00:43:58,204 --> 00:43:58,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

598
00:43:59,765 --> 00:43:59,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

599
00:43:59,925 --> 00:44:00,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Van der Kloot.

600
00:44:01,326 --> 00:44:01,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

601
00:44:01,766 --> 00:44:11,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Pat, I didn't quite understand on the TransFinder program, is it, will the students be wearing identification that's got a chip in it, or how does it work?

602
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:11,952
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

603
00:44:12,052 --> 00:44:16,355
[SPEAKER_06]: What it does is that we upload the information from our SIMS database.

604
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:19,636
[SPEAKER_06]: our student information management to the TransFinder.

605
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:24,140
[SPEAKER_06]: It then plots every person in the city on a virtual map.

606
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:33,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we take those children that actually use the bus service and we change them into a different icon, for lack of a better word.

607
00:44:34,328 --> 00:44:38,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we go through and we see where those students are headed to on their bus path.

608
00:44:39,632 --> 00:44:42,955
[SPEAKER_06]: And we look at the routes that we currently have, see if we can improve them.

609
00:44:43,435 --> 00:44:46,819
[SPEAKER_06]: seeing if we can make them faster so children are on the bus less time.

610
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:52,145
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Transfinder helps us design the routes in conjunction with Eastern.

611
00:44:52,725 --> 00:44:57,270
[SPEAKER_06]: There is no chips, there's no confidentiality is uppermost on their list.

612
00:44:57,991 --> 00:45:03,137
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing that won't change is K through 2 riders will still be tagged like they are now with a bus tag.

613
00:45:03,938 --> 00:45:10,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I didn't fully understand because she said if there was an accident, we would know who was on the bus.

614
00:45:10,326 --> 00:45:19,797
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we know who those riders are, and we move them over to the route that we know that they're on, and we assign them their bus number, all that information is shared between Transfinder and SIMS.

615
00:45:20,448 --> 00:45:36,934
[SPEAKER_06]: So if the bus is out and bus number 15 is working its way from Columbus and we're three stops in and there is a malfunction on the bus, we know exactly at that stop the number of children left on the bus and at what addresses they belong to because we've already put them on the map.

616
00:45:37,174 --> 00:45:39,795
[SPEAKER_03]: But how do you know whether which kids didn't ride the bus that day?

617
00:45:40,075 --> 00:45:49,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we wouldn't know that per se unless we call the school and find out their attendance, but we can still send a general email or phone call to those parents that the children are on the bus because that information

618
00:45:50,382 --> 00:45:51,643
[SPEAKER_06]: is shared with the SIMS system.

619
00:45:51,983 --> 00:45:52,243
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

620
00:45:52,744 --> 00:45:53,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

621
00:45:55,866 --> 00:45:56,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Benedetto.

622
00:45:56,587 --> 00:46:05,914
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know we talked about this before when we were first implementing these new programs, that the possibility of putting community schools on a program like that.

623
00:46:06,094 --> 00:46:08,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Do they currently have a program similar to this?

624
00:46:08,556 --> 00:46:10,097
[SPEAKER_10]: For TransFinder or for the online?

625
00:46:10,618 --> 00:46:12,199
[SPEAKER_06]: For the payment system.

626
00:46:12,279 --> 00:46:12,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they do.

627
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,942
[SPEAKER_06]: We run summer fun camp, summer schools.

628
00:46:16,222 --> 00:46:19,064
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the option for athletic fees, which is starting to pick up.

629
00:46:19,603 --> 00:46:20,524
[SPEAKER_06]: had a slow start.

630
00:46:21,405 --> 00:46:22,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything they want to run through it, we can.

631
00:46:22,807 --> 00:46:25,009
[SPEAKER_06]: We're working on trying to get the pools up next.

632
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:33,118
[SPEAKER_10]: So other facilities as well, the pools, the fields, all of that can eventually go into this type of program?

633
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:33,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

634
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

635
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:38,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion on the floor to receive and place on file?

636
00:46:38,454 --> 00:46:40,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to receive and place on file.

637
00:46:40,396 --> 00:46:41,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

638
00:46:41,656 --> 00:46:42,497
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

639
00:46:43,117 --> 00:46:43,878
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

640
00:46:44,198 --> 00:46:44,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

641
00:46:45,799 --> 00:46:46,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Pat.

642
00:46:47,259 --> 00:46:49,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Update on charter schools, Mr. Superintendent.

643
00:46:49,421 --> 00:47:05,450
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, I spent the better part of today at the Statehouse as they received testimony on the initiative petition and the version of the Statehouse bill with regard to charter schools.

644
00:47:06,278 --> 00:47:16,364
[SPEAKER_17]: As you may or may not know, the state awarded new charters to Brockton and Springfield at its last meeting.

645
00:47:16,384 --> 00:47:28,230
[SPEAKER_17]: And locally, the board approved an expansion of the Pioneer Charter School, as well as an expansion of seats at Mystic Valley.

646
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:33,173
[SPEAKER_17]: You have the technical information here, so I'm not going to go through every bit of it.

647
00:47:34,778 --> 00:47:37,700
[SPEAKER_17]: There are a number of issues that are being raised at this point.

648
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,042
[SPEAKER_17]: Today was a very extensive hearing at the State House.

649
00:47:40,962 --> 00:47:44,244
[SPEAKER_17]: As I indicated, I got there at 10 o'clock, it didn't leave until 4.30.

650
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:53,830
[SPEAKER_17]: So you get the idea of how many people were testifying at different points of the day, not only in charter schools, but common core and some other matters.

651
00:47:56,552 --> 00:48:02,736
[SPEAKER_17]: Citizens Republic Schools released a report, I've attached that to this cover sheet that I wrote.

652
00:48:04,175 --> 00:48:04,896
[SPEAKER_17]: on the wait list.

653
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:21,483
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, the wait list is projected by DESE to be 34,000 students, but when it's sanitized and worked on, CPS projects that it's more like 15,000 students or less.

654
00:48:22,103 --> 00:48:29,046
[SPEAKER_17]: Part of that is because some of the students are in Horace Mann charter schools.

655
00:48:29,566 --> 00:48:33,168
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of the students are at grade levels where they won't accept

656
00:48:34,552 --> 00:48:38,214
[SPEAKER_17]: into the school, and some of them are simply the wait list.

657
00:48:38,255 --> 00:48:42,738
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, for example, Mystic Valley has 3,600 kids on a wait list.

658
00:48:43,218 --> 00:48:44,239
[SPEAKER_17]: That number is bogus.

659
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,361
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just a rolled over number.

660
00:48:46,901 --> 00:48:52,426
[SPEAKER_17]: Instead of, you know, every year going through and seeing how many kids are actually interested, they just roll over the numbers.

661
00:48:53,126 --> 00:48:55,769
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, there are schools that don't roll over the numbers.

662
00:48:56,329 --> 00:48:59,131
[SPEAKER_17]: And, for example, Prospect Hill didn't roll over the numbers.

663
00:48:59,712 --> 00:49:01,253
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, that's helpful.

664
00:49:01,782 --> 00:49:03,804
[SPEAKER_17]: But I've given you a chart to give you an idea.

665
00:49:04,244 --> 00:49:07,987
[SPEAKER_17]: We currently have 344 students at charter schools.

666
00:49:09,749 --> 00:49:13,512
[SPEAKER_17]: The average cost is about $13,300.

667
00:49:15,694 --> 00:49:21,219
[SPEAKER_17]: If the initiative petition were to go through, it could allow for 12 new charters a year.

668
00:49:22,878 --> 00:49:32,023
[SPEAKER_17]: for over 9,500 students and well over $120 million new that would then have to be picked up either by the Commonwealth or the localities.

669
00:49:32,723 --> 00:49:36,365
[SPEAKER_17]: As you know, the Commonwealth has historically underfunded the entitlement.

670
00:49:36,865 --> 00:49:40,707
[SPEAKER_17]: So I suspect that at least some of that would come back to the communities.

671
00:49:41,288 --> 00:49:46,070
[SPEAKER_17]: And Medford would be a community that might be hit by that since we're surrounded by some charter schools.

672
00:49:46,571 --> 00:49:50,913
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is part of the discussion, you know, today that as to how to handle that.

673
00:49:51,353 --> 00:49:55,640
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think the state could actively vet 12 charter schools in any one year.

674
00:49:56,181 --> 00:50:01,470
[SPEAKER_17]: But that's what's on the initiative petition and that's what is being discussed at the state house.

675
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:08,363
[SPEAKER_17]: The other thing would be is that there's also a capital fee that's paid by the state, another $100,000.

676
00:50:08,403 --> 00:50:13,386
[SPEAKER_17]: There's other funding that moves with this as well.

677
00:50:13,947 --> 00:50:20,071
[SPEAKER_17]: So what I'm providing to you right now is to give you an update as to what's happening in the charter school area.

678
00:50:20,671 --> 00:50:22,652
[SPEAKER_17]: It's certainly going to be an ongoing discussion.

679
00:50:23,473 --> 00:50:25,855
[SPEAKER_17]: There were people from all over testifying today.

680
00:50:26,615 --> 00:50:30,298
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was obviously very interesting, pro and con.

681
00:50:31,178 --> 00:50:33,600
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we need to see where that goes.

682
00:50:34,944 --> 00:50:48,629
[SPEAKER_17]: Obviously, we're concerned that if in fact that were to pass, it wouldn't happen next year because you have a situation where the election would be in the fall and it would take another year for it to kick in.

683
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:53,871
[SPEAKER_17]: But since Mystic Valley has 400 additional seats, Malden and Everett have been capped.

684
00:50:53,931 --> 00:50:57,433
[SPEAKER_17]: At least Malden has been capped because they've already reached a certain number.

685
00:50:57,453 --> 00:51:00,154
[SPEAKER_17]: Medford could be a prime target for that.

686
00:51:00,514 --> 00:51:03,155
[SPEAKER_17]: Pioneer is also in Everett, which could be a target.

687
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:11,034
[SPEAKER_17]: And we talked last week about, you know, possibly the closing of a parochial school, which could have some youngsters going to charter.

688
00:51:11,074 --> 00:51:13,495
[SPEAKER_17]: So we track it very closely.

689
00:51:13,515 --> 00:51:14,976
[SPEAKER_17]: We talk about it.

690
00:51:16,197 --> 00:51:18,158
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, not to say that all charters are bad.

691
00:51:18,198 --> 00:51:19,519
[SPEAKER_17]: Some charters are doing a really good job.

692
00:51:19,579 --> 00:51:27,143
[SPEAKER_17]: But having said all that, you know, when it affects us economically, we have to pay attention to it, or potentially economically.

693
00:51:27,902 --> 00:51:31,785
[SPEAKER_17]: Secondly, there are a whole series of other things that we're all interested in.

694
00:51:32,485 --> 00:51:44,054
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of the testimony today was on a mental health bill at the Statehouse on education requiring social, emotional, mental health to be taught as part of the curriculum.

695
00:51:45,174 --> 00:51:55,282
[SPEAKER_17]: There was another piece on having summer school or summer programs count for credit and being another learning experience, extending the learning time through the summer, more learning time.

696
00:51:55,762 --> 00:51:56,883
[SPEAKER_17]: People testified on that.

697
00:51:58,086 --> 00:52:00,268
[SPEAKER_17]: other discussions about other uses of money.

698
00:52:01,169 --> 00:52:12,838
[SPEAKER_17]: So for example, one of the parts of my testimony was, is that if you're going to spend $120 million new, why not put it into things that we all know we should have?

699
00:52:13,378 --> 00:52:20,564
[SPEAKER_17]: More early childhood, more on technology, more on learning time.

700
00:52:21,349 --> 00:52:23,190
[SPEAKER_17]: et cetera, more social emotional health.

701
00:52:23,631 --> 00:52:36,439
[SPEAKER_17]: So these are things that are going on, but it's an ongoing discussion and I want to keep you involved and aware as it's happening so that if you read it in the newspapers or you hear about it, you'll be informed and you'll be able to comment on it.

702
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:40,722
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll continue to give you updates on this and there's plenty to read right now.

703
00:52:42,163 --> 00:52:42,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Miss Cuno.

704
00:52:45,487 --> 00:52:48,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, I'm not going to repeat what the superintendent said.

705
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:54,736
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have a resolution that I had put and have presented in our packet this week.

706
00:52:56,698 --> 00:53:01,763
[SPEAKER_07]: The purpose of my motion is not to discredit the charter schools.

707
00:53:03,224 --> 00:53:09,846
[SPEAKER_07]: The argument is not if the charter schools are teaching better than the traditional public schools.

708
00:53:10,526 --> 00:53:15,207
[SPEAKER_07]: The argument here is the accountability of the finances.

709
00:53:15,747 --> 00:53:20,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now we have a governor who would like to lift the cap off our charter schools.

710
00:53:21,428 --> 00:53:23,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now in the city of Medford we're paying about $13,300 per student.

711
00:53:23,989 --> 00:53:24,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Today it could be $13,300.

712
00:53:24,949 --> 00:53:25,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Tomorrow it could be $15,000.

713
00:53:25,929 --> 00:53:27,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Next year it could be $25,000.

714
00:53:33,552 --> 00:53:35,634
[SPEAKER_07]: And that all comes out of one budget.

715
00:53:36,094 --> 00:53:38,237
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is where the concern is.

716
00:53:38,998 --> 00:53:43,703
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are not the only ones that are dealing with this situation.

717
00:53:44,203 --> 00:53:47,247
[SPEAKER_07]: And as the superintendent said, this is an ongoing

718
00:53:48,257 --> 00:53:52,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Argument and you know discussion that's been going on and it's going on across the state.

719
00:53:52,882 --> 00:54:05,596
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually going on across the country I've had the opportunity as past president and when I was president of MASC to go to different conferences and really deal with this type of situation and

720
00:54:06,907 --> 00:54:10,850
[SPEAKER_07]: It really hurts the budget of the traditional public schools.

721
00:54:11,871 --> 00:54:14,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, it has nothing to do with choice.

722
00:54:14,773 --> 00:54:18,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone has the right to make the choice of where they'd like to send their children.

723
00:54:19,117 --> 00:54:23,040
[SPEAKER_07]: This is all based on the accountability of the finances.

724
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:34,650
[SPEAKER_07]: So our colleagues in Ludlow actually have set up a letter that you will all have in your packets, and I am motioning that we, along with Ludlow and other cities and towns,

725
00:54:35,895 --> 00:54:49,493
[SPEAKER_07]: sign the same type of letter that pertains with our budget and our amounts that will go to the governor and also to our representatives.

726
00:54:50,514 --> 00:54:51,876
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what I am asking tonight.

727
00:54:53,017 --> 00:54:53,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Benedetto.

728
00:54:54,988 --> 00:55:03,179
[SPEAKER_10]: I motion to table this until I can speak with the state ethics to decide whether or not I can vote on such a motion.

729
00:55:05,182 --> 00:55:06,684
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could, that resolution by Ms.

730
00:55:06,724 --> 00:55:08,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Cugno has not been offered yet.

731
00:55:08,527 --> 00:55:10,430
[SPEAKER_09]: We're still on the superintendent's report.

732
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:11,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion to take this from?

733
00:55:13,396 --> 00:55:13,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Out of order.

734
00:55:13,816 --> 00:55:15,097
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion to take Ms.

735
00:55:15,137 --> 00:55:16,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Cuno's paper out of order.

736
00:55:16,297 --> 00:55:17,038
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

737
00:55:17,058 --> 00:55:17,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

738
00:55:17,698 --> 00:55:18,579
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

739
00:55:18,919 --> 00:55:19,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Paper passes.

740
00:55:19,939 --> 00:55:26,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee adapt a letter approved by the Ludlow School Committee opposed to the raising of the charter school cap in Massachusetts.

741
00:55:27,383 --> 00:55:29,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Further, this letter be sent to our legislative delegation.

742
00:55:30,544 --> 00:55:35,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto has asked that we table this paper so that she can get a conflict of interest.

743
00:55:35,907 --> 00:55:37,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Letter from the State Ethics Commission.

744
00:55:39,218 --> 00:55:41,499
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion to table, which is undebatable.

745
00:55:41,559 --> 00:55:43,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto, do you wish to withdraw?

746
00:55:44,419 --> 00:55:50,081
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll withdraw so my colleague can speak, and then, if necessary, repost my notes.

747
00:55:50,101 --> 00:55:50,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

748
00:55:50,181 --> 00:55:50,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Van der Kloot.

749
00:55:50,901 --> 00:56:00,124
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wondered whether, in the meantime, it made sense to adapt the letter for Medford, so that we would actually be voting on the letter we would be

750
00:56:01,651 --> 00:56:03,974
[SPEAKER_03]: sending rather than the Ludlow.

751
00:56:03,994 --> 00:56:07,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Furthermore, it had also been my intent tonight to, I just didn't have time today, there is a round

752
00:56:19,428 --> 00:56:31,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Massachusetts, many communities are speaking out with a resolution about the foundation budget and urging the full financing of the foundation budget.

753
00:56:32,313 --> 00:56:43,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I didn't have time to put together a resolution, but I'm wondering if either we take them both up on Wednesday when we're meeting anyway, or we leave them to our meeting of next week.

754
00:56:46,577 --> 00:56:47,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, Mr. Skerry.

755
00:56:48,077 --> 00:56:53,378
[SPEAKER_13]: For the superintendent, Mr. Superintendent, if you do draft a letter, would you check with us to see if we have any concerns?

756
00:56:53,838 --> 00:57:03,860
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd like you to point out what we actually pay for each student to go through the Medford Public Schools versus the amount that we pay for each student to go to a charter school.

757
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:15,222
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that point has to be concretely determined and put out there and let people know that there's a discrepancy and why some people might be outraged with the charter school.

758
00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:21,321
[SPEAKER_17]: The charter school amount is really, you know, a composite of what we pay.

759
00:57:22,002 --> 00:57:28,126
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, the differences is the fact that, you know, at the elementary level, it's one thing at the, depending on the school they go to and so on and so forth.

760
00:57:28,166 --> 00:57:30,908
[SPEAKER_14]: But you know, we can do that for you in the point of transparency.

761
00:57:30,928 --> 00:57:33,149
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that all has to be pointed out in that point.

762
00:57:33,329 --> 00:57:34,130
[SPEAKER_14]: We can do that for you.

763
00:57:36,231 --> 00:57:39,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to table opted by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

764
00:57:39,713 --> 00:57:40,434
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor.

765
00:57:40,454 --> 00:57:40,954
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

766
00:57:41,395 --> 00:57:42,035
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed.

767
00:57:42,555 --> 00:57:43,416
[SPEAKER_09]: The paper's tabled.

768
00:57:44,296 --> 00:57:45,137
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you accept the other?

769
00:57:46,207 --> 00:57:48,969
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion on the floor to accept the superintendent's report.

770
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:49,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

771
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:49,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Mustone.

772
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:50,271
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

773
00:57:50,311 --> 00:57:56,876
[SPEAKER_05]: We only pay for the bus if they were at the charter school was in our community.

774
00:57:56,896 --> 00:57:59,639
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're in Malden, you'd pay for the bus in Medford.

775
00:57:59,679 --> 00:57:59,999
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't.

776
00:58:00,099 --> 00:58:00,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

777
00:58:12,584 --> 00:58:15,145
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion to accept the report, all those in favor?

778
00:58:15,165 --> 00:58:15,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

779
00:58:16,205 --> 00:58:16,865
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

780
00:58:17,085 --> 00:58:17,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

781
00:58:18,625 --> 00:58:20,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Report on financial literacy.

782
00:58:20,286 --> 00:58:21,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent.

783
00:58:21,846 --> 00:58:28,907
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we all know the cost of going to college has skyrocketed, or has had youngsters in college in recent years.

784
00:58:29,708 --> 00:58:36,329
[SPEAKER_17]: And college debt, which spins from the cost of going to college, has also dramatically increased.

785
00:58:37,129 --> 00:58:40,830
[SPEAKER_17]: So helping families to prepare is a very critical step in

786
00:58:41,597 --> 00:58:52,184
[SPEAKER_17]: promoting college attendance and completion because a lot of very worthy youngsters have to defer going to college or perhaps go to a school that's not their choice because of the cost.

787
00:58:52,905 --> 00:58:55,527
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's a serious issue and looking forward.

788
00:58:55,587 --> 00:58:58,649
[SPEAKER_17]: I have attached some statistics by which I think they're very, very revealing.

789
00:58:59,089 --> 00:59:03,252
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to pick a couple of them out to just simply amplify in this report.

790
00:59:04,455 --> 00:59:09,539
[SPEAKER_17]: Realize that statistics tell us that only 40% of adults keep a budget and track their spending.

791
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:14,542
[SPEAKER_17]: In other words, saying some people just spend, or their paycheck comes in and goes out, and so on and so forth.

792
00:59:14,562 --> 00:59:16,063
[SPEAKER_17]: They're not really sure why they're spending it.

793
00:59:16,723 --> 00:59:24,309
[SPEAKER_17]: Approximately 75% of American families are currently living paycheck to paycheck, and 25% have no savings account at all.

794
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:31,974
[SPEAKER_17]: Collectively, American consumers owe $11.5 trillion to lenders and creditors, and this grows every year.

795
00:59:34,155 --> 00:59:36,536
[SPEAKER_17]: In 2013, student loan debt grew by more than 11%.

796
00:59:37,196 --> 00:59:42,437
[SPEAKER_17]: And only 50% of American families have more than three months worth of expenses saved.

797
00:59:42,457 --> 00:59:45,197
[SPEAKER_17]: 50% have less than one month saved.

798
00:59:45,677 --> 00:59:48,258
[SPEAKER_17]: And the average American family savings account balances $3,800.

799
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:52,838
[SPEAKER_17]: The average amount saved for retirement is $35,000.

800
00:59:52,878 --> 00:59:54,259
[SPEAKER_17]: The average amount of household debt is $117,951.

801
00:59:54,919 --> 00:59:56,679
[SPEAKER_17]: And the average amount of family home value

802
01:00:05,782 --> 01:00:09,503
[SPEAKER_17]: It's about 160, but it's probably up a little bit higher in this area.

803
01:00:10,583 --> 01:00:15,164
[SPEAKER_17]: People spend 12 to 18% more when using credit cards than when using cash.

804
01:00:16,284 --> 01:00:19,345
[SPEAKER_17]: The percent of American workers who postpone the retirement age this year is 24%.

805
01:00:19,605 --> 01:00:22,646
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't afford to retire.

806
01:00:24,066 --> 01:00:28,407
[SPEAKER_17]: Only 18% of adults who are contemplating retirement feel they have enough to do so.

807
01:00:29,607 --> 01:00:31,588
[SPEAKER_17]: 76% of college students have a credit card.

808
01:00:32,266 --> 01:00:32,967
[SPEAKER_17]: And it goes on and on.

809
01:00:33,007 --> 01:00:34,368
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I don't want to read them all for you.

810
01:00:34,388 --> 01:00:39,652
[SPEAKER_17]: But it just gives you an idea that financial literacy is critical.

811
01:00:40,692 --> 01:00:48,418
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's important that we do more with our community and we do more with our students in the area of financial literacy.

812
01:00:48,498 --> 01:00:54,023
[SPEAKER_17]: I currently serve on the Treasurer's Economic Empowerment Trust Fund.

813
01:00:54,823 --> 01:00:57,625
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is a major discussion that we're having right now.

814
01:00:58,526 --> 01:01:00,768
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm part of a subcommittee with Senator Eldridge.

815
01:01:01,617 --> 01:01:15,162
[SPEAKER_17]: and Representative Altrino from Malden, and Representative Ryan, and a few others, to look at all this and see if we can't come up with some suggestions to augment a report that was commissioned earlier in the year.

816
01:01:17,142 --> 01:01:29,867
[SPEAKER_17]: On Tuesday, March 15th, at the McGlynn Middle School, starting at 7 p.m., the Bloomberg Center, the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility in the Guidance Department, will welcome State Treasurer Deborah Goldberg,

817
01:01:30,578 --> 01:01:36,659
[SPEAKER_17]: to the McGlynn Middle School, where she will discuss preparing for college, the proactive steps, and financial resources.

818
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,760
[SPEAKER_17]: And there'll be other speakers as well.

819
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:39,560
[SPEAKER_17]: I won't read them all.

820
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,861
[SPEAKER_17]: At this point in time, you can read them.

821
01:01:42,441 --> 01:01:51,563
[SPEAKER_17]: And we'll be talking about what are some of the strategies you can get involved in in order to prepare for this kind of expense, because it's really out there.

822
01:01:52,243 --> 01:01:54,906
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll continue to provide you information on this.

823
01:01:54,946 --> 01:02:04,175
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to have some recommendations as we move forward, possibly with something that we'll incorporate in the curriculum as we move forward into the budget going forward to next year.

824
01:02:04,195 --> 01:02:11,122
[SPEAKER_17]: And we think it's an important topic and we think it's a topic that affects families and young people.

825
01:02:11,782 --> 01:02:16,186
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's critical that we help our young people and their families to

826
01:02:17,549 --> 01:02:24,771
[SPEAKER_17]: get higher education but at a cost they can afford without the debt that will nag them for many years after they complete.

827
01:02:26,332 --> 01:02:26,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

828
01:02:26,752 --> 01:02:31,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion to accept the report and place on file by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

829
01:02:31,093 --> 01:02:31,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Cuno?

830
01:02:31,733 --> 01:02:32,433
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

831
01:02:32,453 --> 01:02:33,954
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

832
01:02:33,994 --> 01:02:35,094
[SPEAKER_09]: The report is accepted.

833
01:02:37,515 --> 01:02:39,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Report on school security, Mr. Superintendent.

834
01:02:39,895 --> 01:02:44,237
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, I have distributed to you this evening a

835
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:46,181
[SPEAKER_17]: Fresh report.

836
01:02:46,281 --> 01:02:51,144
[SPEAKER_17]: Apparently, when we were preparing the report, we put the old report on top of the materials.

837
01:02:51,645 --> 01:02:54,186
[SPEAKER_17]: So I apologize for that.

838
01:02:54,667 --> 01:02:55,908
[SPEAKER_17]: But you do have the new report.

839
01:02:55,948 --> 01:02:58,590
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm going to go over it in detail tonight.

840
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:00,971
[SPEAKER_17]: Take any questions you may have.

841
01:03:01,632 --> 01:03:08,917
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think this reflects the consensus we've been talking about over the last couple of weeks, at least, as to where we want to go.

842
01:03:09,598 --> 01:03:12,380
[SPEAKER_17]: And then certainly, we can discuss anything else you'd like to.

843
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:19,913
[SPEAKER_17]: So pursuant to our recent deliberations on school security, this report represents our unified position on these matters.

844
01:03:21,234 --> 01:03:35,920
[SPEAKER_17]: While certain steps and information must remain confidential to ensure the effectiveness of our actions, this report contains the agreed upon protocols and practices that will guide our responses to the various threats to school security.

845
01:03:37,001 --> 01:03:40,763
[SPEAKER_17]: So the following general principles will guide our policies and practice.

846
01:03:41,563 --> 01:03:41,663
[SPEAKER_17]: One,

847
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:44,491
[SPEAKER_17]: All threats will be treated seriously.

848
01:03:44,511 --> 01:03:45,591
[SPEAKER_17]: It goes without saying.

849
01:03:45,631 --> 01:03:47,151
[SPEAKER_17]: We treat every threat seriously.

850
01:03:47,272 --> 01:03:50,573
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't treat it as something that is not real.

851
01:03:50,713 --> 01:03:52,713
[SPEAKER_17]: We treat it seriously until we know differently.

852
01:03:53,273 --> 01:04:02,356
[SPEAKER_17]: Two, each threat is unique and must be handled in accordance with the specifics of the situation and the realities of the impacted facility.

853
01:04:03,217 --> 01:04:07,478
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, threat can come in different ways.

854
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:09,719
[SPEAKER_17]: It can have different variables in it.

855
01:04:10,811 --> 01:04:16,095
[SPEAKER_17]: And it can affect a different facility which has different considerations that we must bring to bear.

856
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,936
[SPEAKER_17]: No two facilities are exactly the same.

857
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:24,100
[SPEAKER_17]: And no two threats automatically are exactly the same.

858
01:04:25,241 --> 01:04:28,523
[SPEAKER_17]: Each school has a multi-hazard response plan.

859
01:04:29,543 --> 01:04:30,804
[SPEAKER_17]: So every school has a plan.

860
01:04:32,025 --> 01:04:33,386
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't advertise it.

861
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:37,110
[SPEAKER_17]: because obviously that would reveal certain confidential information.

862
01:04:38,051 --> 01:04:42,735
[SPEAKER_17]: Each school has a building level emergency response team with the principals involved.

863
01:04:43,895 --> 01:04:48,399
[SPEAKER_17]: All school personnel and students will continue to participate in regularly scheduled drills.

864
01:04:49,279 --> 01:04:53,903
[SPEAKER_17]: We have regularly scheduled drills at each of the schools and we also have drills with the fire department.

865
01:04:55,564 --> 01:05:01,528
[SPEAKER_17]: All threat assessments and response interventions will be coordinated with local law enforcement and fire safety.

866
01:05:02,089 --> 01:05:03,550
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't act alone.

867
01:05:04,383 --> 01:05:06,444
[SPEAKER_17]: When something happens, we're talking to the police.

868
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:08,526
[SPEAKER_17]: We're talking to the fire department.

869
01:05:08,926 --> 01:05:10,427
[SPEAKER_17]: We may be talking to the state.

870
01:05:10,867 --> 01:05:13,509
[SPEAKER_17]: We may be talking to the FBI, Homeland Security.

871
01:05:13,549 --> 01:05:20,414
[SPEAKER_17]: We're talking to whomever we believe is necessary to be interacting with us.

872
01:05:20,994 --> 01:05:27,458
[SPEAKER_17]: But in particular, our own police department and our own fire safety operations are always involved.

873
01:05:29,079 --> 01:05:32,482
[SPEAKER_17]: Protocols will adhere to the guidelines of the Massachusetts State Police.

874
01:05:33,127 --> 01:05:35,229
[SPEAKER_17]: the Massachusetts Department of Fire Safety, and the U.S.

875
01:05:35,249 --> 01:05:36,690
[SPEAKER_17]: Department of Homeland Security.

876
01:05:37,271 --> 01:05:41,995
[SPEAKER_17]: I've attached that to the report that had the wrong cover on it, but you can see it there.

877
01:05:42,795 --> 01:05:44,617
[SPEAKER_17]: And we've passed that out before.

878
01:05:46,439 --> 01:05:50,782
[SPEAKER_17]: Each threat will be assessed by a combined police, fire, and school assessment team.

879
01:05:52,864 --> 01:05:58,629
[SPEAKER_17]: Additional police and fire personnel will be summoned as necessary and consistent with the findings of the threat assessment.

880
01:06:01,302 --> 01:06:09,268
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not necessary to call out every fire truck and every squad car in the area when we believe it's a low-level threat.

881
01:06:09,729 --> 01:06:18,176
[SPEAKER_17]: But if necessary, we'll interact and we'll call out whatever we think is necessary and summon them to the area.

882
01:06:18,936 --> 01:06:25,201
[SPEAKER_17]: Regional assistance, like the STARS program, will be activated as necessary, determined by the Threat Assessment Team.

883
01:06:26,262 --> 01:06:30,546
[SPEAKER_17]: So our police department can activate STARS with us,

884
01:06:31,954 --> 01:06:34,056
[SPEAKER_17]: The fire department can activate mutual aid.

885
01:06:34,776 --> 01:06:46,264
[SPEAKER_17]: All these things are possible, but we don't just do them, we do them in sequence as we determine the threat, as we determine what needs to be done, and what is the best response for us.

886
01:06:49,266 --> 01:06:55,070
[SPEAKER_17]: The school environment will be sealed off from non-public safety personnel until the situation is stabilized.

887
01:06:56,551 --> 01:06:59,953
[SPEAKER_17]: We cannot allow people to come up to the facility

888
01:07:00,684 --> 01:07:06,427
[SPEAKER_17]: or enter the facility until we know that we're stable and everything is in place.

889
01:07:07,207 --> 01:07:12,630
[SPEAKER_17]: Can't manage the students, the faculty, the staff, and itinerant people coming and going.

890
01:07:14,011 --> 01:07:18,853
[SPEAKER_17]: If a situation is in place, we'll seal it off and we'll act accordingly.

891
01:07:22,995 --> 01:07:28,058
[SPEAKER_17]: Evacuation protocols, when necessary, will be used away from the identified hazard.

892
01:07:28,998 --> 01:07:30,119
[SPEAKER_17]: People ask me all the time,

893
01:07:30,698 --> 01:07:32,019
[SPEAKER_17]: What door are you going to evacuate from?

894
01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:33,680
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, it depends where the hazard is.

895
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:37,602
[SPEAKER_17]: If the hazard is on the west courtyard at the high school, then we're not going out the west courtyard.

896
01:07:38,223 --> 01:07:41,205
[SPEAKER_17]: If it's on the vocational side, we're not going out the vocational side.

897
01:07:41,685 --> 01:07:43,866
[SPEAKER_17]: If it's in the front door, we're not going out the front door.

898
01:07:44,287 --> 01:07:57,275
[SPEAKER_17]: We will use the appropriate evacuation routes or evacuations in place within the buildings based on where the hazard exists or where we believe the hazard exists.

899
01:07:58,216 --> 01:08:00,297
[SPEAKER_17]: We will move away from the identified hazard.

900
01:08:01,435 --> 01:08:06,436
[SPEAKER_17]: The Medford School Committee will be notified of the threat as soon as possible by the administration.

901
01:08:07,236 --> 01:08:10,137
[SPEAKER_17]: Updates on the status will be provided in a timely manner.

902
01:08:10,717 --> 01:08:15,778
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll let you know as soon as we know what's going on, and we'll provide you updates in a timely manner.

903
01:08:17,118 --> 01:08:23,880
[SPEAKER_17]: Faculty and staff after threat assessment will be notified, and students will be informed of the action plan, whether it is the shelter,

904
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:27,801
[SPEAKER_17]: lockdown, evacuate, as soon as it is feasible.

905
01:08:28,541 --> 01:08:38,905
[SPEAKER_17]: As soon as we know enough to tell people so we know what we're asking them to do and we can do it with confidence so we don't get people saying, well, I'm not sure of this, I'm not sure of that.

906
01:08:39,426 --> 01:08:46,669
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to be sure of what we're going to do in order to engage the students and have them respond appropriately.

907
01:08:48,512 --> 01:08:51,034
[SPEAKER_17]: Individual communication devices will be discouraged.

908
01:08:51,174 --> 01:08:59,100
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't want people going to their own cell phones or other devices to call or make calls at the point of impact.

909
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:03,103
[SPEAKER_17]: Because if they do that, they may have misinformation.

910
01:09:03,603 --> 01:09:09,387
[SPEAKER_17]: They may be telling people things that, you know, that are not appropriate, or perhaps creating other concerns.

911
01:09:10,388 --> 01:09:16,793
[SPEAKER_17]: People may be listening in, and it may be the person who, or persons who are actually causing the hazard.

912
01:09:18,098 --> 01:09:24,663
[SPEAKER_17]: Parents will be notified of the situation after the situation is stabilized or the evacuation protocol is implemented.

913
01:09:25,804 --> 01:09:32,230
[SPEAKER_17]: When the situation is stabilized or we're evacuating, we will tell people, we will tell parents what we're doing.

914
01:09:33,391 --> 01:09:38,114
[SPEAKER_17]: A reunification site will be established for parents who desire to dismiss their child.

915
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:44,940
[SPEAKER_17]: No non-public safety personnel can enter the building or premises until stabilization is achieved.

916
01:09:45,783 --> 01:09:53,166
[SPEAKER_17]: Students may only be released to a parent or a guardian, and the reunification site will be determined based upon the identification of a safe area.

917
01:09:53,707 --> 01:09:55,087
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, it could be an area in the building.

918
01:09:55,668 --> 01:09:57,869
[SPEAKER_17]: It could be an area outside the building.

919
01:09:57,949 --> 01:10:00,650
[SPEAKER_17]: It could be to an area off campus.

920
01:10:01,190 --> 01:10:02,451
[SPEAKER_17]: It could be in a bus.

921
01:10:03,091 --> 01:10:09,094
[SPEAKER_17]: It could be any number of things, depending on what we believe is a safe area and where we can

922
01:10:09,624 --> 01:10:17,607
[SPEAKER_17]: coordinate reunification by parents, guardians, and students that they wish to withdraw.

923
01:10:18,448 --> 01:10:22,789
[SPEAKER_17]: Administration will coordinate the dismissal of students by meeting with parents at the established site.

924
01:10:23,229 --> 01:10:36,935
[SPEAKER_17]: So administrators will go out, meet with people, determine who is going to be dismissed, who is going to be let go at that point in time, and then they will be brought to the site as opposed to just having them walk out to the site.

925
01:10:38,615 --> 01:10:42,696
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll provide a follow-up message to parents, students, and the community within a day.

926
01:10:42,716 --> 01:10:55,720
[SPEAKER_17]: It takes a little bit of time to figure out what's going on, but certainly by the next day we should have a full-blown letter, if not sooner, if we can determine that, and we'll let people know.

927
01:10:55,860 --> 01:11:06,963
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember, we're going to notify people of a situation once it's stabilized, but I don't want to tell you that I can tell everybody everything until I know myself, until the people involved know.

928
01:11:07,987 --> 01:11:22,231
[SPEAKER_17]: As a result of inquiries regarding our protocols for shelter in place, stay in place, I put a description in the previous packet that was given to you that was produced by the high school, which explains that procedure and how that works.

929
01:11:24,031 --> 01:11:29,033
[SPEAKER_17]: The following additional information is provided in response to inquiries that were made in public settings.

930
01:11:30,033 --> 01:11:34,514
[SPEAKER_17]: The high school personnel who made the sweep of the bomb threat included the following.

931
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:59,657
[SPEAKER_17]: Headmaster John Perrella, the Assistant Principals David Blouk, Nick Tucci, and Gail Traynor, the Vocational Director Heidi Riccio, the Vocational Assistant Director Jill Sawyer, Medford Police Officer Jim Ricciardi, High School Security William Mazaker, High School Security Janet Connors, the Athletic Director of Community Schools Director Robert Maloney, and two building monitors, Dennis Robinson and Joseph DePace.

932
01:12:01,177 --> 01:12:05,060
[SPEAKER_17]: Each of these individuals has a designated search route.

933
01:12:06,241 --> 01:12:09,584
[SPEAKER_17]: We have it planned out where people look at designated places.

934
01:12:09,604 --> 01:12:12,827
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to reveal what those places are.

935
01:12:13,507 --> 01:12:21,093
[SPEAKER_17]: They look for packages, backpacks, unusual objects in hallways, cafeterias, gyms, bathrooms, trash bins, storage areas.

936
01:12:21,834 --> 01:12:23,856
[SPEAKER_17]: Exterior areas are also checked.

937
01:12:25,077 --> 01:12:29,260
[SPEAKER_17]: These individuals practice these procedures several times a year.

938
01:12:30,001 --> 01:12:31,762
[SPEAKER_17]: I was asked, do they have any experience doing it?

939
01:12:31,802 --> 01:12:32,022
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

940
01:12:33,484 --> 01:12:36,666
[SPEAKER_17]: The search was directed by the headmaster and the police resource officer.

941
01:12:37,126 --> 01:12:44,472
[SPEAKER_17]: Had it been a bigger threat, we would have brought in additional police personnel or fire safety personnel to assist with that.

942
01:12:45,552 --> 01:12:53,578
[SPEAKER_17]: Each week, administrators meet in community-based justice sections, CBJ, to evaluate information and discuss possible threats to the school.

943
01:12:54,659 --> 01:12:59,803
[SPEAKER_17]: The frequency of bomb threats in our area was discussed well in advance of the actual incident

944
01:13:00,473 --> 01:13:01,394
[SPEAKER_17]: at Medford High School.

945
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:09,500
[SPEAKER_17]: There were over 145 threats of a similar nature in this area during a six-week period.

946
01:13:12,302 --> 01:13:18,607
[SPEAKER_17]: Subsequent to the sweep, each person is called into the office by walkie-talkie.

947
01:13:19,307 --> 01:13:23,490
[SPEAKER_17]: A debriefing was then held based on the findings, and this is a standard procedure.

948
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:24,351
[SPEAKER_17]: What happened?

949
01:13:24,471 --> 01:13:25,031
[SPEAKER_17]: What do you see?

950
01:13:25,292 --> 01:13:26,132
[SPEAKER_17]: What didn't you see?

951
01:13:26,733 --> 01:13:27,994
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there anything that concerns you?

952
01:13:29,235 --> 01:13:31,677
[SPEAKER_17]: and what should we do about it if we think there's some concern.

953
01:13:33,718 --> 01:13:38,082
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a very good camera coverage at Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School.

954
01:13:38,162 --> 01:13:44,126
[SPEAKER_17]: This year we have spent $55,000 new on camera repairs and replacement.

955
01:13:44,707 --> 01:13:52,913
[SPEAKER_17]: Our contractors are American Alarm, and we've upgraded certain cameras to provide wider coverage and a sharper image over the last week and a half.

956
01:13:55,071 --> 01:14:00,295
[SPEAKER_17]: We will be installing a revamp buzzer system at the front door of Medford High School.

957
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:02,817
[SPEAKER_17]: The purchase order is out there.

958
01:14:03,738 --> 01:14:05,759
[SPEAKER_17]: We expect it to be in place within a week.

959
01:14:05,779 --> 01:14:11,904
[SPEAKER_17]: Pat Vealy worked with us on this today with City Hall and with the people involved.

960
01:14:12,545 --> 01:14:20,571
[SPEAKER_17]: It will be a situation where the person monitoring the front door can actually see who's out front and can determine whether to let that person in or not.

961
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:23,513
[SPEAKER_17]: That will work in conjunction with the Raptor system

962
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:27,293
[SPEAKER_17]: and also be similar to what exists in the outside buildings.

963
01:14:28,774 --> 01:14:33,077
[SPEAKER_17]: All doors will be locked during the school day and monitored by personnel moving through the building.

964
01:14:34,018 --> 01:14:35,860
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, it's imperfect.

965
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:39,463
[SPEAKER_17]: If somebody lets somebody in, it's pretty hard.

966
01:14:40,263 --> 01:14:44,647
[SPEAKER_17]: So you have to know not to let people in if you don't know who they are.

967
01:14:46,228 --> 01:14:50,612
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's something that every member of staff and student has to internalize.

968
01:14:52,053 --> 01:14:53,533
[SPEAKER_17]: send people to the front of the building.

969
01:14:54,253 --> 01:15:03,775
[SPEAKER_17]: So for example, this Wednesday, there is a group coming to the vocational school for the community that cares project.

970
01:15:03,795 --> 01:15:05,895
[SPEAKER_17]: They're going to work on the bids and the like.

971
01:15:06,455 --> 01:15:07,336
[SPEAKER_17]: They'll all be checked in.

972
01:15:08,376 --> 01:15:14,517
[SPEAKER_17]: When we had the chamber luncheon, people were checked in.

973
01:15:15,097 --> 01:15:17,237
[SPEAKER_17]: People who are regulars will have badges.

974
01:15:18,498 --> 01:15:20,278
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't need to check in because they'll have the badges.

975
01:15:20,318 --> 01:15:20,918
[SPEAKER_17]: We know who they are.

976
01:15:22,692 --> 01:15:24,233
[SPEAKER_17]: So everybody needs to be checked in.

977
01:15:24,673 --> 01:15:26,274
[SPEAKER_17]: Cannot let people in through doors.

978
01:15:26,294 --> 01:15:28,656
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's really human.

979
01:15:29,636 --> 01:15:34,339
[SPEAKER_17]: There's no system out there where you have as many doors as we have at Medford High School.

980
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:38,402
[SPEAKER_17]: All guests in the building will be checked and IDs issued.

981
01:15:38,682 --> 01:15:41,544
[SPEAKER_17]: Regular personnel will be expected to wear their IDs.

982
01:15:42,925 --> 01:15:48,768
[SPEAKER_17]: So key personnel continue to meet and review protocols and practices in light of the most recent wave of threats to schools.

983
01:15:49,509 --> 01:15:51,270
[SPEAKER_17]: There have been several regional meetings regarding

984
01:15:52,246 --> 01:15:54,687
[SPEAKER_17]: best practices, several of our people have gone.

985
01:15:55,227 --> 01:15:59,468
[SPEAKER_17]: You heard last week Officer Ricciardi tell you he'd just gone to another event.

986
01:16:00,048 --> 01:16:06,930
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll continue to participate in these sessions and stay informed of threat patterns affecting area schools and other institutions.

987
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:11,752
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's our report of where we are, what happened, and I'd be happy to take any questions you have.

988
01:16:13,803 --> 01:16:13,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

989
01:16:14,003 --> 01:16:14,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Van der Kloot.

990
01:16:15,664 --> 01:16:25,529
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been thinking about this since our last meeting, and there's just, there's a phrase which I find awkward, I guess, and that is non-public safety personnel.

991
01:16:26,130 --> 01:16:33,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, maybe it's one that's used all the time, but I wondered, like, when I read the sentence, I was, I just kept on playing with it and saying,

992
01:16:35,035 --> 01:16:47,167
[SPEAKER_03]: just feel right, can you write the sentence a different way and say the school environment is sealed off from the public and only appropriately public safety personnel be able to enter until the situation is stabilized?

993
01:16:47,227 --> 01:16:48,248
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the term you wanted to use?

994
01:16:49,382 --> 01:17:02,432
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the second, so the school environment is sealed off from the public, and only appropriate safety personnel, designated safety personnel, will be able to enter until the situation is stabilized.

995
01:17:03,012 --> 01:17:04,233
[SPEAKER_17]: Designated safety?

996
01:17:04,633 --> 01:17:04,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

997
01:17:05,754 --> 01:17:06,275
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, remember,

998
01:17:07,577 --> 01:17:09,859
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know where the police send somebody up in the fight.

999
01:17:09,879 --> 01:17:10,979
[SPEAKER_03]: So safety personnel.

1000
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:11,760
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1001
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:17,164
[SPEAKER_03]: And in this, in the second one, it says no non-public safety personnel can enter the building.

1002
01:17:17,184 --> 01:17:21,987
[SPEAKER_03]: And it would make more sense to say only public safety personnel can enter the building.

1003
01:17:22,468 --> 01:17:22,788
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1004
01:17:23,548 --> 01:17:24,069
[SPEAKER_17]: I can do that.

1005
01:17:25,890 --> 01:17:26,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1006
01:17:26,711 --> 01:17:27,691
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1007
01:17:28,712 --> 01:17:29,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Skerry.

1008
01:17:31,034 --> 01:17:35,457
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, just, just to follow up, man, may a few through you to superintendent Belson.

1009
01:17:36,169 --> 01:17:39,250
[SPEAKER_13]: At your release, could you get us a report back from the chief of police?

1010
01:17:39,310 --> 01:17:48,052
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe the, excuse me, the McGlynn incident, the individual was prosecuted, and I was wondering if there was any order of restitution to the city.

1011
01:17:48,552 --> 01:17:50,172
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I will ask.

1012
01:17:50,713 --> 01:17:51,473
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's imperative.

1013
01:17:51,493 --> 01:17:52,973
[SPEAKER_17]: It's probably at the DA's office, but I will ask.

1014
01:17:53,793 --> 01:17:55,934
[SPEAKER_13]: The police should have a copy of the report.

1015
01:17:56,934 --> 01:17:57,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1016
01:17:57,374 --> 01:17:58,074
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to know that.

1017
01:17:58,114 --> 01:17:59,175
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that would be a big help.

1018
01:17:59,375 --> 01:17:59,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1019
01:18:00,755 --> 01:18:03,296
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion to accept the report as amended by Ms.

1020
01:18:03,316 --> 01:18:03,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot.

1021
01:18:05,023 --> 01:18:05,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call vote, please.

1022
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:17,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none of the negative.

1023
01:18:17,986 --> 01:18:24,748
[SPEAKER_09]: The paper passes as amended and also an update on the report of the McGlynn incident offered by Mr. Skerry.

1024
01:18:24,768 --> 01:18:25,468
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor.

1025
01:18:26,248 --> 01:18:26,949
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed.

1026
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:28,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

1027
01:18:28,869 --> 01:18:29,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent.

1028
01:18:30,009 --> 01:18:32,530
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, let me say thank you to you.

1029
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:37,481
[SPEAKER_17]: We've had a very good dialogue and you've given some good input.

1030
01:18:38,361 --> 01:18:41,122
[SPEAKER_17]: It's helped to formulate what you would like to see.

1031
01:18:42,563 --> 01:18:45,504
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, every community has to go through this.

1032
01:18:46,204 --> 01:18:47,264
[SPEAKER_17]: No community is immune.

1033
01:18:48,344 --> 01:18:49,965
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I think we've had good discussions.

1034
01:18:50,785 --> 01:18:55,266
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, if you read through the minutes of the, uh, committee of the whole, I think it was a good meeting.

1035
01:18:55,286 --> 01:18:57,007
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a substantial meeting.

1036
01:18:57,879 --> 01:19:07,701
[SPEAKER_17]: I watched the tape a couple of times, you know, to see it all, to see the different give and take, so I could capture what I thought people wanted to see, as opposed to just simply trying to remember it on notes.

1037
01:19:08,641 --> 01:19:14,063
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it was a good give and take, and I think our previous meeting on the subject also helped to shape this.

1038
01:19:14,783 --> 01:19:17,123
[SPEAKER_17]: This is an ongoing responsibility to all of us.

1039
01:19:17,983 --> 01:19:25,005
[SPEAKER_17]: And the people who think that, you know, you can just simply wave a wand and wave threats away, they don't understand.

1040
01:19:25,924 --> 01:19:29,367
[SPEAKER_17]: Every community has issues that they have to continuously pay attention to.

1041
01:19:30,087 --> 01:19:31,228
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're no different.

1042
01:19:31,869 --> 01:19:32,369
[SPEAKER_17]: But we will.

1043
01:19:32,529 --> 01:19:33,670
[SPEAKER_17]: We have good people in place.

1044
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:36,732
[SPEAKER_17]: We have excellent cooperation from the police and fire department.

1045
01:19:36,773 --> 01:19:38,954
[SPEAKER_17]: We have excellent regional relationships.

1046
01:19:39,715 --> 01:19:47,000
[SPEAKER_17]: And we will work on tightening up the various human behaviors that can sometimes make us a little bit more vulnerable.

1047
01:19:47,821 --> 01:19:48,382
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

1048
01:19:54,046 --> 01:19:55,147
[SPEAKER_16]: We have one thing we should do.

1049
01:19:56,382 --> 01:19:57,083
[SPEAKER_16]: One thing that's come up.

1050
01:19:57,784 --> 01:20:01,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to move negotiation and legal matters to the end of the agenda.

1051
01:20:01,529 --> 01:20:02,290
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

1052
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:03,832
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1053
01:20:05,154 --> 01:20:05,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

1054
01:20:08,138 --> 01:20:08,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Communications.

1055
01:20:10,127 --> 01:20:12,649
[SPEAKER_09]: New business resolution submitted by Erin DiBenedetto.

1056
01:20:12,669 --> 01:20:21,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the administration identify all school employees that sit on or are signers for the Friends of Medford Baseball, Friends of Medford Softball, and the Friends of Medford Basketball.

1057
01:20:22,456 --> 01:20:25,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Further, that it go to executive session if any employees are named.

1058
01:20:26,059 --> 01:20:34,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Further, I am also requesting that the administration provide bank account records dating back four years for the groups named above, including account names, numbers, and signer information.

1059
01:20:35,125 --> 01:20:37,847
[SPEAKER_09]: A complete list of all income and expense with all details.

1060
01:20:37,867 --> 01:20:44,431
[SPEAKER_09]: A complete list of all donations made to all three of these groups, including money, in-kind donations, as well as equipment donations.

1061
01:20:47,513 --> 01:20:47,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1062
01:20:47,733 --> 01:20:48,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Kreatz?

1063
01:20:48,453 --> 01:20:50,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'd like to put a motion.

1064
01:20:50,635 --> 01:20:59,280
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to table the agenda item and move it to the committee of the whole meeting on Wednesday so that we can all be there to answer questions.

1065
01:20:59,733 --> 01:21:00,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ms.

1066
01:21:00,233 --> 01:21:00,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Kress.

1067
01:21:00,433 --> 01:21:13,197
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a committee of the whole meeting scheduled for this Wednesday, I believe at 7 o'clock, Mr. Superintendent, up in the superintendent's office at Medford High School, at which time information will be furnished by the superintendent and possibly those involved.

1068
01:21:13,677 --> 01:21:16,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Is a motion on the floor to table this paper?

1069
01:21:17,238 --> 01:21:18,178
[SPEAKER_09]: It's undebatable.

1070
01:21:19,079 --> 01:21:19,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call vote.

1071
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:24,940
[SPEAKER_09]: It's undebatable.

1072
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

01:21:26,201 --> 01:21:26,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Cugno.

1074
01:21:36,484 --> 01:21:37,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether to table it or not.

1075
01:21:42,389 --> 01:21:42,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1076
01:21:44,871 --> 01:21:46,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, she said aye.

1077
01:21:46,092 --> 01:21:48,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I would like to table it.

1078
01:21:48,574 --> 01:21:49,054
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes.

1079
01:21:49,074 --> 01:21:50,876
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can have more time.

1080
01:21:51,016 --> 01:21:51,536
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a yes.

1081
01:21:51,576 --> 01:21:52,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I haven't been informed.

1082
01:21:52,977 --> 01:21:54,919
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a yes.

1083
01:21:55,059 --> 01:21:55,339
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1084
01:21:55,419 --> 01:21:55,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Sherry, no.

1085
01:22:01,499 --> 01:22:03,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, four in the affirmative, three in the negative.

1086
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:04,481
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

1087
01:22:04,521 --> 01:22:06,602
[SPEAKER_09]: This paper is tabled for Wednesday evening.

1088
01:22:06,622 --> 01:22:13,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I make a motion to have a little Wednesday night meeting?

1089
01:22:13,947 --> 01:22:15,868
I don't even have any information.

1090
01:22:15,908 --> 01:22:24,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we have the high school library in film so that the community can see the conversation and everybody present can have a place to speak?

1091
01:22:24,713 --> 01:22:25,114
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

1092
01:22:25,814 --> 01:22:28,896
[SPEAKER_10]: So I make a motion to move this meeting

1093
01:22:30,928 --> 01:22:40,590
[SPEAKER_10]: All information is being located and all people in the community have a chance to come and speak.

1094
01:22:40,810 --> 01:22:42,870
[SPEAKER_09]: There'll be a motion, there'll be a paper posted.

1095
01:22:42,890 --> 01:22:44,650
[SPEAKER_09]: It's already been posted at the public meeting.

1096
01:22:44,911 --> 01:22:51,312
[SPEAKER_09]: It will be moved on to the door of the superintendent's conference room that it has been moved to the library.

1097
01:22:51,572 --> 01:22:52,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call vote.

[SPEAKER_09]: That the meeting be moved to the library.

1101
01:22:59,735 --> 01:23:02,857
[SPEAKER_09]: And it'd be videotaped, and it'd be set up with podiums.

1102
01:23:03,357 --> 01:23:07,861
[SPEAKER_09]: It's already posted.

[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have to repost on the door.

1105
01:23:10,983 --> 01:23:12,624
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll just change the location.

1106
01:23:12,764 --> 01:23:13,684
[SPEAKER_09]: It's tabled.

1107
01:23:13,825 --> 01:23:14,865
It's tabled.

1108
01:23:14,925 --> 01:23:15,826
This paper is tabled.

1109
01:23:15,846 --> 01:23:17,887
[SPEAKER_00]: We can move back to the agenda.

1110
01:23:30,703 --> 01:23:30,983
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly.

1111
01:23:33,864 --> 01:23:35,144

01:23:49,368 --> 01:23:49,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1118
01:23:49,668 --> 01:23:51,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven in the affirmative, negative.

1119
01:23:51,688 --> 01:23:53,609
[SPEAKER_09]: The location of the meeting has been changed.

1120
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:02,044
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion for suspension to revert to community participation, seconded by Ms.

1121
01:24:02,084 --> 01:24:02,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot.

[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

01:24:03,746 --> 01:24:04,426

[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Jack Dempsey.

1127
01:24:12,113 --> 01:24:14,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for telling me who I am.

1128
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:19,959
[SPEAKER_00]: I've taught in Medford for over 20 years, coached in Medford for over 20 years.

1129
01:24:19,979 --> 01:24:25,364
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to talk about an incident that happened the other night.

1130
01:24:26,337 --> 01:24:29,998
[SPEAKER_00]: affecting the girls in the Medford High School softball program.

1131
01:24:31,558 --> 01:24:37,600
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I'd like to congratulate all the other high school girls and vocational school girls tonight for their great awards.

1132
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:48,203
[SPEAKER_00]: It just shows how great Medford High School is and the students, teachers, athletic department, and the school.

1133
01:24:49,323 --> 01:24:49,683
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1134
01:24:51,204 --> 01:24:52,344
[SPEAKER_00]: Last Wednesday evening,

1135
01:24:53,449 --> 01:25:00,115
[SPEAKER_00]: The unprofessional behavior of a Medford School Committee member was a humiliating and demeaning.

1136
01:25:00,155 --> 01:25:00,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Dempsey, please.

1137
01:25:00,876 --> 01:25:02,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Dempsey, this isn't the place for this.

1138
01:25:03,738 --> 01:25:04,919
[SPEAKER_09]: This paper just got tabled.

1139
01:25:05,059 --> 01:25:05,800
[SPEAKER_16]: Just got tabled.

1140
01:25:06,961 --> 01:25:08,723
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's pertaining to this matter.

1141
01:25:08,943 --> 01:25:09,743
[SPEAKER_09]: So see you Wednesday night?

1142
01:25:09,884 --> 01:25:10,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Wednesday night.

1143
01:25:10,284 --> 01:25:10,904
[SPEAKER_09]: See you Wednesday night.

1144
01:25:10,925 --> 01:25:13,267
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have another opportunity Wednesday night.

1145
01:25:13,287 --> 01:25:13,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Wednesday night.

1146
01:25:13,987 --> 01:25:15,449
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1147
01:25:15,469 --> 01:25:17,971
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a couple of one thing is that there's some concern.

1148
01:25:18,251 --> 01:25:19,212
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, there's some concern.

1149
01:25:19,272 --> 01:25:20,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent.

1150
01:25:20,827 --> 01:25:30,453
[SPEAKER_17]: There is some interest on the 21st of people attending the Celtics through the activity that is Medford Community Night at the event.

1151
01:25:31,113 --> 01:25:35,816
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a scheduled meeting that night.

1152
01:25:36,997 --> 01:25:40,379
[SPEAKER_17]: Several of you have asked me if you'd like to go, so it's fine by me.

1153
01:25:40,419 --> 01:25:45,222
[SPEAKER_17]: But technically, you have to decide you want to postpone that meeting to another day.

1154
01:25:46,983 --> 01:25:48,064
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that your wish?

1155
01:25:48,144 --> 01:25:49,185
[SPEAKER_17]: If not, we're in session.

1156
01:25:50,459 --> 01:25:51,560
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't cancel your meetings.

1157
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:54,681
[SPEAKER_09]: There are people from the school committee that wanted to attend that evening.

1158
01:25:54,701 --> 01:25:54,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

1159
01:25:54,761 --> 01:25:56,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Danticlude?

1160
01:25:56,702 --> 01:26:05,287
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be comfortable postponing it, either doing it earlier to the 14th or putting it off for a week to the 28th.

1161
01:26:06,468 --> 01:26:06,788
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1162
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:08,869
[SPEAKER_17]: So let me tell you a little bit about what I've got.

1163
01:26:09,950 --> 01:26:14,512
[SPEAKER_17]: On the 14th, I had told you that previously I was scheduling activities around the schools.

1164
01:26:14,552 --> 01:26:16,693
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll be down in Robertsville on the 14th in the evening.

1165
01:26:17,294 --> 01:26:19,034
[SPEAKER_17]: So the 14th does not work for me.

1166
01:26:19,635 --> 01:26:19,735
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1167
01:26:20,503 --> 01:26:25,124
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, so there'll be people that, so I can't do it the 14th, I could do it the 28th.

1168
01:26:28,365 --> 01:26:30,666
[SPEAKER_03]: So I make a motion that we move it to the 28th?

1169
01:26:32,246 --> 01:26:36,607
[SPEAKER_17]: The only thing about March 28th, I just want to lay this stuff out for you, it's the day after Easter.

1170
01:26:37,387 --> 01:26:39,988
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we do that,

1171
01:26:41,138 --> 01:26:44,280
[SPEAKER_17]: If we do that, well, the Jewish boy has to tell you about this.

1172
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:44,801
[SPEAKER_09]: That's OK.

1173
01:26:44,841 --> 01:26:46,042
[SPEAKER_09]: We're good.

1174
01:26:46,482 --> 01:26:49,384
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion to postpone, Mr. Superintendent.

1175
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:50,004
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1176
01:26:50,605 --> 01:26:55,148
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion to postpone the 21st, March 21st meeting to the 28th of March.

1177
01:26:55,188 --> 01:26:55,989
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?
