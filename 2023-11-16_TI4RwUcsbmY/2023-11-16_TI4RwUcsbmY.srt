1
00:00:05,128 --> 00:00:12,201
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we should be good to go on YouTube and recording member Graham.

2
00:00:12,622 --> 00:00:13,944
[SPEAKER_09]: So, flourish.

00:00:16,952 --> 00:00:22,513
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so welcome to this special meeting of the school committee.

00:00:52,067 --> 00:01:04,938
[SPEAKER_13]: We have an agenda that's been posted for the meeting, so the first item on the agenda is the roll call.

7
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:06,520
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau, can you call the roll?

8
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, one moment.

9
00:01:12,938 --> 00:01:18,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a construction crew in my house, so forgive me for background noise and the need to pop up every now and then.

10
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:25,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure who's here, because I am catching up late, but Member Graham?

11
00:01:26,844 --> 00:01:27,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Here.

12
00:01:29,865 --> 00:01:31,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Hays?

13
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:34,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Here.

14
00:01:35,668 --> 00:01:36,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Kreatz?

15
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:42,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin?

16
00:01:44,326 --> 00:01:44,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Here.

17
00:01:44,606 --> 00:01:47,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Mustone?

18
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Absent, I believe.

19
00:01:49,949 --> 00:01:51,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Ruseau is present.

20
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Mayor Longo?

21
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,073
[SPEAKER_13]: She'll be along shortly.

22
00:01:58,675 --> 00:01:59,576
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

23
00:01:59,996 --> 00:02:02,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so four present, three absent.

24
00:02:03,418 --> 00:02:04,399
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, here comes the mayor.

25
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:05,459
[SPEAKER_13]: Got a letter in.

26
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,142
[SPEAKER_13]: So we can mark her as present.

27
00:02:13,768 --> 00:02:15,489
[SPEAKER_13]: Just give her a second for her audio to connect.

28
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,931
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, Mayor, how are you?

29
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:23,173
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, everybody.

30
00:02:25,477 --> 00:02:28,039
[SPEAKER_13]: We just did the roll call and we've marked you present.

31
00:02:30,221 --> 00:02:37,146
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was hoping that the next thing that we could do is have the students do some introductions on their end.

32
00:02:37,206 --> 00:02:42,030
[SPEAKER_13]: So we can, just so you know, we can see you all, but it's very hard to see any of you in particular.

33
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:50,136
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't know if the camera will move around with you all when you start talking, but if you all could introduce yourselves, that would be great.

34
00:02:56,842 --> 00:03:00,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, my name is Darren Trong and I'm a senior at Medford High School.

35
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:02,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi Darren.

36
00:03:02,406 --> 00:03:11,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, my name is Jaden Phil and I'm representing the sophomore class at Medford High School.

37
00:03:12,434 --> 00:03:13,155
[SPEAKER_06]: And you said David?

38
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:14,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Jaden.

39
00:03:14,796 --> 00:03:15,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Jaden.

40
00:03:16,257 --> 00:03:16,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

41
00:03:16,577 --> 00:03:22,062
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, my name is Noah.

42
00:03:22,342 --> 00:03:23,643
[SPEAKER_14]: I am also a

43
00:03:34,998 --> 00:03:39,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Cushing, can I ask you that we just get obviously a list of the students after that will be helpful.

44
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:40,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

45
00:03:40,501 --> 00:03:41,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

46
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:45,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, my name is Sierra Isbell and I'm from the junior class.

47
00:03:47,826 --> 00:03:48,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

48
00:03:49,747 --> 00:03:53,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, my name is Sophie Hook and I'm from the freshman class.

49
00:04:00,029 --> 00:04:00,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

50
00:04:04,152 --> 00:04:12,619
[SPEAKER_12]: Just so you know, we have a few others that couldn't make the meeting today, but we'll let you know obviously who they are at the end of the meeting.

51
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:15,621
[SPEAKER_12]: So take it away, kids.

52
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:22,766
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the next item on the agenda, and sorry to usurp Madam Mayor or Member Graham.

53
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Go for it.

54
00:04:24,207 --> 00:04:27,510
[SPEAKER_09]: The next item on the agenda is really for students, for you to be able to like,

55
00:04:28,115 --> 00:04:47,354
[SPEAKER_09]: share not like for you to actually share why you're looking to do this work and partnering with district and school leadership as well as the governing body, which is the school committee to really try to help to improve our district and outcomes for students, not just academically, socially, really across the board to improve.

56
00:04:48,211 --> 00:04:49,232
[SPEAKER_09]: of metropolitan schools.

57
00:04:49,312 --> 00:04:54,457
[SPEAKER_09]: And while you represent the high school, you do have experience in our K-8 system as well.

58
00:04:54,817 --> 00:04:59,841
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is the opportunity on the agenda for why you want to do this work.

59
00:05:06,147 --> 00:05:07,708
[SPEAKER_12]: Go ahead Noah, you start us off.

60
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:12,312
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so here we go.

61
00:05:14,963 --> 00:05:19,924
[SPEAKER_14]: I suppose I just feel like I want to make a difference.

62
00:05:20,184 --> 00:05:28,587
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like there are, I think as a student, there are things that you notice and things that you see that you're like, well, wait, why couldn't we do it like this?

63
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:30,087
[SPEAKER_14]: Why couldn't we do it this other way?

64
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:32,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Or why couldn't we try something different?

65
00:05:32,968 --> 00:05:38,149
[SPEAKER_14]: And I feel like it's kind of difficult to do that just like as, as students.

66
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:41,930
[SPEAKER_14]: So I feel like doing this work is a way to

67
00:05:42,654 --> 00:05:49,308
[SPEAKER_14]: try to improve to try new things and try to improve the school in general and in general school system.

68
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:50,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

69
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:54,434
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great, thank you.

70
00:05:56,075 --> 00:05:57,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Cushing or Mayor?

71
00:05:57,696 --> 00:05:59,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Dr. McLaughlin.

72
00:05:59,598 --> 00:06:00,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

73
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:04,462
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if it would make it a little bit more comfortable if maybe we could take turns doing this, right?

74
00:06:04,482 --> 00:06:08,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Instead of just having the students have to do this, maybe we could each take a turn about our why.

75
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:14,230
[SPEAKER_10]: And then that might be a little bit more helpful and a little bit more relationship building, if that's okay.

76
00:06:15,451 --> 00:06:17,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, would you like to start us off, Dr. McLaughlin?

77
00:06:17,793 --> 00:06:19,354
[SPEAKER_06]: I was gonna actually suggest you do.

78
00:06:19,955 --> 00:06:20,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you want me to?

79
00:06:20,595 --> 00:06:20,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, no.

80
00:06:22,622 --> 00:06:24,243
[SPEAKER_06]: why we are having these meetings.

81
00:06:25,224 --> 00:06:27,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Or yeah, your why for running.

82
00:06:27,685 --> 00:06:33,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, your why for running, your why you want to improve the school or we want to, you know, whatever you want to say, just a little intro.

83
00:06:34,588 --> 00:06:38,050
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, I'm initially my why.

84
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:49,456
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my biggest reasons for why I ran for mayor was safety at the schools back in 2018, 19, before I think any of our time here on the school committee and administration.

85
00:06:49,536 --> 00:06:51,777
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a loaded gun magazine that was

86
00:06:52,233 --> 00:07:13,014
[SPEAKER_06]: found in one of our schools and thrown away by the principal and covered up by the prior superintendent and I was not too happy about that with having children and in the schools myself so that's my why for running four years ago and now why it's important to have these joint meetings and I think member Hays for

87
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,931
[SPEAKER_06]: really pushing this and making this happen.

88
00:07:15,991 --> 00:07:25,092
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because we are here for the students and the faculty, and we want to hear from you, and we want to help bring resolution to your concerns and hear you out.

89
00:07:25,232 --> 00:07:30,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if there's things we can't help with, we want to have an honest conversation and do our best.

90
00:07:30,773 --> 00:07:33,374
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a little bit of mine.

91
00:07:37,015 --> 00:07:38,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Should we toss it back to the students?

92
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:53,647
[SPEAKER_04]: So the reason, one of the reasons why I decided to join the student advisory committee, because as a senior at the Mecklen High School, I've experienced it all at high school.

93
00:07:53,667 --> 00:08:11,422
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very involved with clubs, and I wanted to be part of the process in making sure that school policies and student voices are represented, as I felt that typically, I feel like students are underrepresented when it comes to our voices and school policy decisions, and I wanted to be part of the change in that.

94
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:15,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, thank you.

95
00:08:16,768 --> 00:08:17,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin.

96
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:20,570
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, thank you.

97
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you guys for being here.

98
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:26,212
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's really important just to your point about students having a voice.

99
00:08:27,953 --> 00:08:31,254
[SPEAKER_10]: As a student myself, when I was younger, I didn't really have a voice.

100
00:08:31,374 --> 00:08:33,515
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't have a parent that could sort of speak on my behalf.

101
00:08:33,595 --> 00:08:35,096
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know how frustrating that was.

102
00:08:35,356 --> 00:08:39,458
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, I have a daughter with intellectual

103
00:08:39,898 --> 00:08:41,679
[SPEAKER_10]: disability and some other high needs.

104
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:49,402
[SPEAKER_10]: And she has difficulty with expressive language and being able to let her needs known and wants known and feelings known.

105
00:08:49,422 --> 00:08:54,343
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's important that we are able to do that and to build relationships and teach people how to do that.

106
00:08:54,443 --> 00:08:57,805
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess I'm also always asking who's not at the table.

107
00:08:58,045 --> 00:08:58,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

108
00:08:58,425 --> 00:09:02,646
[SPEAKER_10]: So, like, we're here and I'm glad we're here and I'm really happy we're starting this process.

109
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:06,668
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I want to think about how we're ambassadors for the people who aren't here.

110
00:09:07,688 --> 00:09:12,312
[SPEAKER_10]: and can be able to really help give them some capital as well.

111
00:09:12,793 --> 00:09:13,133
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

112
00:09:18,838 --> 00:09:21,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

113
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:30,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to get involved in the high school community as I was entering a new school and

114
00:09:31,334 --> 00:09:43,604
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear lots of people talking about their opinions on some of the rules, and I just thought, oh, it would be great if I could really help to make a change.

115
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, thank you.

116
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:50,810
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Graham?

117
00:09:52,784 --> 00:09:56,107
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll be brief because I'm here to represent you all.

118
00:09:56,147 --> 00:10:00,931
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why I ran for office because the school committee is here to represent the students.

119
00:10:02,653 --> 00:10:05,916
[SPEAKER_13]: So I wanna listen and I will turn it back over to you.

120
00:10:08,918 --> 00:10:13,802
[SPEAKER_08]: I joined the student advisory council committee because I wanted to see change.

121
00:10:14,043 --> 00:10:18,006
[SPEAKER_08]: I think sometimes we all give our frustrations

122
00:10:18,527 --> 00:10:29,214
[SPEAKER_08]: and can point out the issues in our school system, but we can't necessarily create solutions to fix them, or we're just not part of those groups that can proactively deal with those problems.

123
00:10:29,614 --> 00:10:33,236
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wanted to be a part of this committee and hopefully I can make some change.

124
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:36,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful.

125
00:10:40,512 --> 00:10:43,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Hays and Member Ruseau, do you want a minute?

126
00:10:44,154 --> 00:10:44,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

127
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:47,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Sharon Hayes.

128
00:10:48,056 --> 00:10:54,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, this is the only chance I will get to meet with you because I won't be on school committee the next time you meet.

129
00:10:55,261 --> 00:11:00,604
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm really, really excited that so many of you wanted to do this, and I'm really glad we're getting this going.

130
00:11:02,325 --> 00:11:09,169
[SPEAKER_01]: My reason for really trying to make sure this got started and, you know, I know it had support from

131
00:11:09,747 --> 00:11:12,088
[SPEAKER_01]: administration and all the school committee members, really.

132
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:17,770
[SPEAKER_01]: But we talk so much about how everything we do is for the students, and we mean that.

133
00:11:19,091 --> 00:11:29,695
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I think we've all realized along the way is that what we really need to hear is what you think you need, because we are older.

134
00:11:30,095 --> 00:11:32,256
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been in high school, but times are different.

135
00:11:32,336 --> 00:11:35,778
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do need to hear from you what's going on,

136
00:11:37,136 --> 00:11:41,838
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going well, what's not going so well, what ideas you have for change.

137
00:11:42,658 --> 00:11:44,739
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so important to get your voices in.

138
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:46,520
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much for doing this.

139
00:11:52,202 --> 00:11:59,144
[SPEAKER_02]: I joined the Student Advisory Council because my fellow students and I saw different issues at the school.

140
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:05,106
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we weren't exactly sure how to articulate those reasons and really bring it up to someone to help it get fixed.

141
00:12:07,022 --> 00:12:14,746
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think with the student advisory council and meeting with the school committee, we can really help make a change in our school because the students, they're like 80% of the school.

142
00:12:15,106 --> 00:12:16,026
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a big part of it.

143
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:20,848
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to make sure that as we're going to school, we can make it the best experience it can be.

144
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:27,231
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if we see problems, we want to be able to help come together and make solutions to fix it.

145
00:12:31,153 --> 00:12:31,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

146
00:12:32,214 --> 00:12:34,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Rossell, do you want to say a few words?

147
00:12:35,267 --> 00:12:37,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, I'll be brief.

148
00:12:37,028 --> 00:12:44,152
[SPEAKER_03]: I, as everybody has already said, I ran because students don't get to vote.

149
00:12:44,312 --> 00:12:52,437
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought I had a lot to offer and I'm most interested in hearing what you all have to offer actually.

150
00:12:52,457 --> 00:12:54,699
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm gonna leave it there.

151
00:13:00,162 --> 00:13:00,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

152
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Cushing, feel free to lead

153
00:13:03,735 --> 00:13:08,500
[SPEAKER_06]: the way I know you're there in person and can see who's in their hands and things like that.

154
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

155
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:10,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

156
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,931
[SPEAKER_09]: I really appreciate it.

157
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:21,594
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the students working with the school leadership have identified three really primary areas of concern that they would like to see us address.

158
00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:24,375
[SPEAKER_09]: The first is the homework policy.

159
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:29,397
[SPEAKER_09]: The second are backpacks being carried around the school.

160
00:13:30,097 --> 00:13:34,179
[SPEAKER_09]: And the third is community spirit and support for Medford High School.

161
00:13:35,323 --> 00:13:39,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and so, uh, I leave it to the students to jump in.

162
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:48,415
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, um, that I rank those in order just as they were given to me, but perhaps backpacks is number one and not number two or however it is.

163
00:13:48,556 --> 00:13:50,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe homework policy is number one.

164
00:13:50,477 --> 00:13:52,219
[SPEAKER_12]: Homework policy is number one.

165
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about homework.

166
00:13:58,485 --> 00:14:00,647
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you guys want to share the draft that you

167
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:05,924
[SPEAKER_12]: With Dr pushing so that you can project this for the school committee.

168
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,926
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah, that would be great.

169
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:11,431
[SPEAKER_12]: So they came up with a draft about the homework policy.

170
00:14:11,571 --> 00:14:15,236
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have some students who have done remarkable work.

171
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:23,592
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's only November 15th, so that's pretty amazing.

172
00:14:23,912 --> 00:14:26,153
[SPEAKER_13]: We can't see who's speaking right now.

173
00:14:26,373 --> 00:14:28,055
[SPEAKER_13]: You're really far away from the camera.

174
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:28,715
[SPEAKER_13]: It's me.

175
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:29,636
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Sheila.

176
00:14:30,016 --> 00:14:30,536
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, hi.

177
00:14:30,596 --> 00:14:31,497
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

178
00:14:31,797 --> 00:14:34,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Assistant Principal of Engagement and Operations.

179
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:34,819
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you?

180
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:35,920
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

181
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,340
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

182
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,423
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm in the way background, Marta.

183
00:14:41,044 --> 00:14:41,384
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi.

184
00:14:44,987 --> 00:14:46,888
[SPEAKER_09]: So as soon as he comes through, I will

185
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:51,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Projected, awesome.

186
00:14:55,386 --> 00:14:56,629
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I got a few tabs open.

187
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:26,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry that's a bit much.

188
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:32,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Feel free to lead it.

189
00:15:37,374 --> 00:15:52,562
[SPEAKER_04]: So the reason why we decided to address policy is because oftentimes students are engaged in extracurricular activities outside of school and many students feel overwhelmed with the amount of homework being given to them and they feel that the

190
00:16:02,434 --> 00:16:09,438
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I, as well as other students on the committee drafted this policy requests.

191
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:14,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, when we talk about the.

192
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:18,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Changes we'd like to see to the school handbook regarding the policy.

193
00:16:18,704 --> 00:16:26,048
[SPEAKER_04]: To stress balance school life aspects.

194
00:16:30,854 --> 00:16:45,000
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've incorporated numerous other homeowner policies that we've researched from other school districts, including Somerville, River Public School, Western Public Schools, and other school districts.

195
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:54,544
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've come to somewhat of a consensus on our draft so far about what changes we'd like to see.

196
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:01,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin.

197
00:17:04,963 --> 00:17:05,304
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

198
00:17:05,364 --> 00:17:06,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that the end of the document?

199
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no, there's more on the bullets.

200
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:10,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, great.

201
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:10,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

202
00:17:12,091 --> 00:17:12,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

203
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:19,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think it's an excellent, very well-written policy memo.

204
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:30,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Great job, Darren, Jayden, Yao, I'm sorry if I'm pronouncing your name wrong, Mariam, Marjia, Noah, Oprah, Quinn, Sierra, Sophie, Tenzin, and the last name that I cannot see.

205
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:32,368
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really well-written.

206
00:17:32,488 --> 00:17:32,988
[SPEAKER_10]: I would ask

207
00:17:38,522 --> 00:17:46,092
[SPEAKER_10]: If you could elaborate or share with us a little bit more, I think what I know from my own now graduates experience.

208
00:17:47,898 --> 00:17:55,465
[SPEAKER_10]: for both of my students that have graduated was part of the issue was that the teachers don't understand which classes are giving which homework.

209
00:17:55,505 --> 00:18:03,933
[SPEAKER_10]: And so collaboratively, I mean, collectively, the homework can exceed the 40 minutes or the half an hour or the 20 minutes that you're recommending for each.

210
00:18:03,993 --> 00:18:10,879
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I think that that has been part of the issue historically is that there's not a collective sort of

211
00:18:12,287 --> 00:18:14,331
[SPEAKER_10]: collaboration across the classroom.

212
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:18,059
[SPEAKER_10]: So if each classroom is giving, you know, say you have six classes in each

213
00:18:19,116 --> 00:18:26,382
[SPEAKER_10]: and you're in all AP, and each of them are giving 30 to 40 minutes of homework a night, then that's, what, three or four hours of homework.

214
00:18:26,442 --> 00:18:37,411
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that's what the collective piece maybe could be included in there, because maybe people who don't necessarily have that experience don't understand that it's across all classes that is the issue.

215
00:18:38,412 --> 00:18:47,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I correct in assuming that that's what you guys are saying, that it can equal up to three or four hours of homework a night if each of the teachers don't necessarily know how much homework is being given?

216
00:18:48,902 --> 00:18:50,603
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be a great assumption.

217
00:18:52,584 --> 00:18:54,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I ask the group just a clarifying question?

218
00:18:54,825 --> 00:19:07,753
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you say AP classes should be given at most 40 minutes of homework a night, would that be, if you're taking three AP classes, that would equal three 40-minute blocks or one 40-minute block for the evening?

219
00:19:08,693 --> 00:19:14,056
[SPEAKER_14]: So that would be, as my understanding of it, it's 40 minutes per class.

220
00:19:14,396 --> 00:19:15,537
[SPEAKER_14]: It wouldn't necessarily

221
00:19:15,953 --> 00:19:17,774
[SPEAKER_14]: have to be 40 minutes every single night.

222
00:19:18,034 --> 00:19:23,458
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think a lot of people in AP tests, AP classes can attest, you don't always get homework every single night.

223
00:19:23,478 --> 00:19:28,001
[SPEAKER_14]: More often than not, it's like a balance of doing homework, spacing it out.

224
00:19:28,482 --> 00:19:39,129
[SPEAKER_14]: But just putting some kind of limit on the kind of homework you have to have a single night deadline on, I think would be very helpful for teachers who might not realize how much time it takes to do a given assignment.

225
00:19:39,149 --> 00:19:40,110
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

226
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,811
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

227
00:19:41,871 --> 00:19:43,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham and then Member McLaughlin.

228
00:19:47,841 --> 00:19:48,301
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

229
00:19:49,482 --> 00:19:57,408
[SPEAKER_13]: I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about, it looks like you're recommending changes to some existing policy.

230
00:19:57,448 --> 00:20:00,951
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you tell us where this policy exists?

231
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:01,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

232
00:20:02,772 --> 00:20:14,421
[SPEAKER_04]: On page 51 of the Medford High School and both Medford Vocational Technical High School Student Handbook from the 2022 to 2023 school year, it would be the second bullet point.

233
00:20:15,522 --> 00:20:15,762
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

234
00:20:18,689 --> 00:20:19,330
[SPEAKER_13]: Super helpful.

235
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:30,159
[SPEAKER_13]: As you were talking, I was thinking that I don't, didn't recall we had a homework policy at the school committee level.

236
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,520
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, we do.

237
00:20:33,382 --> 00:20:39,047
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I think this is, I think this gets confused and I think this will come up again when we talk about backpacks.

238
00:20:39,768 --> 00:20:41,409
[SPEAKER_13]: There are school committee policies

239
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:47,334
[SPEAKER_13]: And then there are like all the other policies that sit in your handbook that you all look at.

240
00:20:47,514 --> 00:20:57,602
[SPEAKER_13]: And so the way like these things are supposed to work is that the school committee sets out a policy, all the buildings have to comply with that policy.

241
00:20:57,682 --> 00:20:59,264
[SPEAKER_13]: So those policies we try to make them

242
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:11,603
[SPEAKER_13]: such that they set real high-level policy that then gets interpreted by all the various different levels and schools.

243
00:21:11,663 --> 00:21:14,264
[SPEAKER_13]: So our dress code policy is a good example of that.

244
00:21:15,244 --> 00:21:20,327
[SPEAKER_13]: There might be some things that clarify things for high school students that would be different for elementary school students.

245
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:25,050
[SPEAKER_13]: So in this case, I think we actually have two pieces of work to do.

246
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:33,955
[SPEAKER_13]: One is that we have to look at our school committee homework policy, because that has to sort of sit over the top.

247
00:21:34,516 --> 00:21:47,204
[SPEAKER_13]: And then everything that, in the case where there is a policy, anything that's reflected in the school handbook has to be in alignment with what the school committee puts forward as its district-wide policy.

248
00:21:49,065 --> 00:22:05,840
[SPEAKER_13]: In the case where there is no policy in the school committee handbook, in the school committee set of policies, then the superintendent and the principals, right, they are free to set their own policies on everything else that happens in the school.

249
00:22:07,196 --> 00:22:26,592
[SPEAKER_13]: The trick is, or the catch is, that what is supposed to happen once a handbook is created, and of course there's always been a handbook, but on an annual basis, those handbooks are supposed to be modified at the school level by the school site councils.

250
00:22:27,753 --> 00:22:29,695
[SPEAKER_13]: which I think you all are allowed to be a part of.

251
00:22:30,295 --> 00:22:34,999
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they go to the school committee essentially for like a sign off, right?

252
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:42,865
[SPEAKER_13]: So, and that sign off would look at things like, are we being consistent across both middle schools or are we consistent with our set of policies?

253
00:22:43,686 --> 00:22:47,609
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I think there's actually like maybe a couple of pieces of work here.

254
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:54,274
[SPEAKER_13]: One is that the school committee needs to revisit its homework policy because we have one.

255
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:58,693
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can't tell when it was last.

256
00:22:59,855 --> 00:23:02,516
[SPEAKER_13]: updated, but certainly not in four years.

257
00:23:04,297 --> 00:23:06,078
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's been a lot of discussion about homework.

258
00:23:06,098 --> 00:23:14,762
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think at a broad district level, like we have some work that we have to do at that policy level that we would love for you all to be a part of.

259
00:23:14,782 --> 00:23:18,684
[SPEAKER_13]: And we can talk about how that can like come through its process.

260
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:24,707
[SPEAKER_13]: But then sort of the second step of that is like whatever the homework policy is in your handbook,

261
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:33,143
[SPEAKER_13]: has to be modified by the site council at the school, and obviously has to line up and then come to us.

262
00:23:33,243 --> 00:23:40,627
[SPEAKER_13]: So, and then, you know, I think about that process, which sounds like really complicated to your point, like there's lots of pieces of that.

263
00:23:41,307 --> 00:23:49,311
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think there's, there'll be a lot of people who will want to weigh in on establishing homework policy, like your teachers.

264
00:23:51,303 --> 00:23:55,324
[SPEAKER_13]: among others, but I think parents as well, especially when you talk about kids of younger grades.

265
00:23:55,404 --> 00:24:18,875
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think there's maybe a couple of steps here, which is one for us to look at your policy that you are suggesting and compare it to what is already our policy, which probably nobody realizes we have because we don't do a great job of that and get our policy sort of squared away in an alignment for K to 12 for the whole district.

266
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,571
[SPEAKER_13]: And then also there's probably some work that Ms.

267
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:42,337
[SPEAKER_13]: Cabral needs to do with her site council to sort of be more granular about like how to adhere to the spirit of that like overarching policy in a way that is specific to what happens at Medford High, which obviously you all have the most homework of all the grades.

268
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:50,765
[SPEAKER_13]: And so in the structure of how you learn is just very different than you would in first grade or fifth grade.

269
00:24:51,346 --> 00:24:56,069
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's probably like a couple of pieces here to me that I'm all for it.

270
00:24:56,229 --> 00:24:59,352
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm happy to put forward a resolution that we look at the homework policy.

271
00:25:00,192 --> 00:25:11,580
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would want to do that in a way that you all can join us for those conversations, because I think you've already done some good work, and perhaps there's lots of pieces that we can pull in.

272
00:25:12,121 --> 00:25:17,905
[SPEAKER_13]: But then there's that second piece, which is within the building, you all probably have some work to do, Ms.

273
00:25:17,945 --> 00:25:18,865
[SPEAKER_13]: Cabral, as well.

274
00:25:19,406 --> 00:25:29,373
[SPEAKER_13]: So just some thoughts about homework in general, especially given that we have a policy that we also have to contend with in our overall policy handbook.

275
00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:38,754
[SPEAKER_09]: And just so everyone's aware, I did put that policy in the chat for anyone who wants to pull it in for the students in the room.

276
00:25:38,814 --> 00:25:40,356
[SPEAKER_09]: I can email it to you directly.

277
00:25:41,036 --> 00:25:43,558
[SPEAKER_09]: But all Medford policies, in large part,

278
00:25:52,990 --> 00:26:09,099
[SPEAKER_13]: But I love it and that you all are bringing forward a suggestion to us because a lot of times people will tell us they don't like something, but telling us how you think we can solve the problem is also super important.

279
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:10,920
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for bringing this forward.

280
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:12,681
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, thank you.

281
00:26:13,222 --> 00:26:18,925
[SPEAKER_11]: And just to clarify about the school site council, we will be starting that at the beginning

282
00:26:19,557 --> 00:26:32,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Beginning of December, it's already mid November, beginning of December where you will have a seat at the table at that and where we will be discussing primarily starting off the handbook and making adjustments to the handbook that we can then present to school committee.

283
00:26:33,268 --> 00:26:36,091
[SPEAKER_11]: So that would be starting very, very soon with teachers.

284
00:26:36,111 --> 00:26:41,315
[SPEAKER_11]: A community member caregivers and students as well.

285
00:26:42,256 --> 00:26:43,397
[SPEAKER_04]: So we automatically.

286
00:26:45,379 --> 00:26:51,086
[SPEAKER_11]: So, we're looking at how we're going to do it as a rotating basis, because we want 5 students at a time there.

287
00:26:51,206 --> 00:26:56,733
[SPEAKER_11]: So, there'll be more logistics of how we can make sure that you all are having a balance as well between.

288
00:26:57,393 --> 00:27:03,681
[SPEAKER_11]: All of the councils that you're on.

289
00:27:03,961 --> 00:27:04,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

290
00:27:04,382 --> 00:27:04,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

291
00:27:04,602 --> 00:27:05,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin.

292
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:06,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

293
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,481
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to apologize.

294
00:27:07,601 --> 00:27:13,186
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually have to go to another meeting in a moment, but I will get an update from my colleagues to the students.

295
00:27:13,266 --> 00:27:22,755
[SPEAKER_10]: But also, if Dr. Cushing or member Graham can put in the chat for the students, the currently outdated school committee policy.

296
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:23,436
[SPEAKER_10]: So as.

297
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:40,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Cushing was mentioning a moment earlier, guys, the school committee policies are on the MPS website and they are searchable by keyboard and a really nice function there too is that you can do comparative to other districts to see what they look like by that search.

298
00:27:41,463 --> 00:27:45,744
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, if you get a link, um, you'll know how to search our policies.

299
00:27:45,884 --> 00:27:50,085
[SPEAKER_10]: And so to member Graham's point, you know, there's policy is multilayered.

300
00:27:50,425 --> 00:27:54,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so there's a, you know, some pieces of it, but we're really eager to work with you guys.

301
00:27:54,526 --> 00:27:56,267
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think this is a great first step.

302
00:27:56,327 --> 00:28:00,748
[SPEAKER_10]: So forgive me for having to jump off, but I'm at the office and have to go to another meeting.

303
00:28:00,868 --> 00:28:02,968
[SPEAKER_10]: So I look forward to seeing you all again.

304
00:28:02,988 --> 00:28:03,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

305
00:28:03,689 --> 00:28:04,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

306
00:28:04,509 --> 00:28:04,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

307
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:05,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin.

308
00:28:06,397 --> 00:28:15,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and it looks like the current policy doesn't have time frames for what each teacher would give.

309
00:28:15,104 --> 00:28:23,530
[SPEAKER_06]: So I like that idea of exploring with the teachers, with the admin and the students, if that is the way to solve it.

310
00:28:23,571 --> 00:28:25,872
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a good first option for us.

311
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:27,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's quite vague.

312
00:28:28,775 --> 00:28:34,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, even if the teachers start understanding that this is an issue,

313
00:28:36,357 --> 00:28:38,559
[SPEAKER_06]: potentially start to make change.

314
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:40,620
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, teachers don't wanna, I'm sure, overwhelm you.

315
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:54,231
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we could get teachers, even just seeing your proposed policy, maybe it'll get them to really think about the work they're giving and what other teachers on their grade level are giving too, so they can kind of coordinate a bit.

316
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:59,295
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe some change could start even before a full policy is drafted.

317
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:01,637
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wanted to say that I hear you.

318
00:29:01,877 --> 00:29:04,299
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to Arlington Catholic my first year,

319
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:12,722
[SPEAKER_06]: and was an athlete, and I switched to Medford High School, and the biggest reason was because I could not keep up with the homework.

320
00:29:13,422 --> 00:29:21,504
[SPEAKER_06]: And in Medford High School, I was able to take the classes, non-AP classes, and I'm sure you're all in APs, but non-AP classes, and be able to manage much better.

321
00:29:21,604 --> 00:29:28,166
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's important for our current student body to be able to manage homework and extracurriculars.

322
00:29:28,826 --> 00:29:29,306
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

323
00:29:29,946 --> 00:29:33,207
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know we have about 20 minutes to go, so do you mind

324
00:29:33,652 --> 00:29:41,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Cushing and student team, if we move on to, I think we're all aware of this backpack policy or school spirit.

325
00:29:41,557 --> 00:29:43,018
[SPEAKER_06]: So whichever one you'd want to take up first.

326
00:29:47,581 --> 00:29:52,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Students who have backpacks, they'd like to get them off their backs.

327
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:53,685
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

328
00:29:54,446 --> 00:29:55,326
[SPEAKER_12]: Or rather back on.

329
00:29:55,486 --> 00:29:55,666
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

330
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:56,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, back on.

331
00:29:56,467 --> 00:29:57,007
[SPEAKER_12]: Back on.

332
00:29:57,067 --> 00:29:58,008
[SPEAKER_12]: Back on their backs.

333
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:11,400
[SPEAKER_06]: As one member, could we briefly hear from the admin of, I know that's in the policy and why that might be important that they're not on.

334
00:30:12,201 --> 00:30:14,624
[SPEAKER_06]: And then can we hear from students, the counter argument.

335
00:30:16,847 --> 00:30:25,655
[SPEAKER_13]: And then before we do that, though, can I just I just want to point out, because there's been a lot of questions about whose policy this is.

336
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:28,938
[SPEAKER_13]: There is no school committee policy that references backpacks.

337
00:30:29,418 --> 00:30:34,582
[SPEAKER_13]: So we so this particular question doesn't have two layers to it.

338
00:30:34,823 --> 00:30:36,964
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's good news, because it's less layers, right?

339
00:30:38,946 --> 00:30:42,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Our school committee policies are silent on backpacks, somewhere along the line.

340
00:30:44,005 --> 00:30:59,260
[SPEAKER_13]: The handbook has some language about what the backpack policy is at Medford High, and if that needs to be changed again like the school committee will sign off and approve those things, but in the absence of a policy at the school committee level.

341
00:31:00,666 --> 00:31:11,231
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent and her designees like Principal Cabral have the latitude to sort of issue policy directives or procedure directives like this.

342
00:31:11,351 --> 00:31:21,336
[SPEAKER_13]: So obviously at some point we have to review these policies and I actually think we'll talk about that at our next meeting in terms of a timeline there because we have not reviewed

343
00:31:22,868 --> 00:31:25,390
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, handbooks in four years that I've been on the committee.

344
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:31,035
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is like bad hygiene, like in terms of all of these things continuing to work together well.

345
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:41,763
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, but I just wanted to make sure that the students knew that there is no school committee policy, that that policy does sit at Medford High, um, just as a jumping off point.

346
00:31:43,905 --> 00:31:47,508
[SPEAKER_09]: And generally, not generally speaking, the only place that the, um,

347
00:31:48,683 --> 00:31:55,488
[SPEAKER_09]: That backpacks is mentioned in the policy is 1 place and it's only given as almost a secondary example.

348
00:31:56,209 --> 00:31:59,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Of responsibilities, but it does not as member Graham said.

349
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:06,997
[SPEAKER_09]: But I want to speak in a generality of backpacks for for schools and general is.

350
00:32:08,947 --> 00:32:19,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Following numerous school violence incidents, backpacks became a subject of debate and were banned in many schools across the country.

351
00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:35,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Over the ensuing 25 or so years, since the most notable of those school violence incidents, there has been a relaxation on that because the reality is that that's not

352
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:54,468
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not a conduit necessarily for bad things, but there's this thought process that, you know, it offers clutter to rooms or things along those lines that make it difficult to move around small rooms if there are backpacks in the aisles or various things.

353
00:32:54,789 --> 00:33:00,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, I'm only speaking in generalities of how backpacks have been seen by school leaders.

354
00:33:01,502 --> 00:33:19,688
[SPEAKER_09]: However, it also does pose significant challenges if in a building the size of Medford High School, about north of a half a million square feet, which is a large building, as you know, being here every day, if your locker is in one location and it's difficult to get to going up and down stairs between classes.

355
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:26,490
[SPEAKER_09]: As someone who went to high school on a multi-building campus, I never used my backpack, just as a personal example.

356
00:33:27,267 --> 00:33:30,528
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so, but I think, I mean, I always use my backpack.

357
00:33:30,548 --> 00:33:31,408
[SPEAKER_09]: I never use my block.

358
00:33:31,928 --> 00:33:35,049
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, because the locker was in the most inconvenient location.

359
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:39,231
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and who had time X minutes between class.

360
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:42,832
[SPEAKER_09]: So, but generally speaking, that's been the thought process around backpacks.

361
00:33:43,372 --> 00:33:49,534
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think the students probably have a very well worded strong opinion on.

362
00:33:51,158 --> 00:33:59,884
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think at my level, it's something that we're all, it's a past practice here and something that we're definitely exploring and have already been collecting data on.

363
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:18,096
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's very clear on the student end, but on the teacher end, collecting data on where they stand so that when we do sit down on school site council, and this is something that caregivers have been talking a lot about, we have everything that we've collected the data wise so that we can make an informed policy change.

364
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:20,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.

365
00:34:20,578 --> 00:34:20,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

366
00:34:24,261 --> 00:34:28,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Students, does anybody want to speak on this?

367
00:34:29,683 --> 00:34:34,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Let us know why you think, you know, why it would be helpful to have a backpack, Emily.

368
00:34:34,986 --> 00:34:42,629
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think one current problem with the backpack policy is that teachers interpret it very differently.

369
00:34:43,069 --> 00:34:51,533
[SPEAKER_08]: So some enforce it very strongly, whereas even tote bags that are like not a certain inches are like immediately set to their lockers or they're written up for it.

370
00:34:51,954 --> 00:34:54,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas others will just let you have your backpack.

371
00:34:54,957 --> 00:35:04,845
[SPEAKER_08]: So that kind of leniency with the rule is making it hard to enforce and then making the pushback even stronger because why do some people get to have backpacks and then I don't and like that sort of thing.

372
00:35:07,227 --> 00:35:18,096
[SPEAKER_14]: So the other thing too is in terms of like classes, workload and paperwork and stuff like that, we have only really like five minutes between periods.

373
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:20,404
[SPEAKER_14]: to get from one class to three.

374
00:35:20,564 --> 00:35:23,505
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got three minutes between periods to get from class to class.

375
00:35:25,265 --> 00:35:28,006
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's it's a big building.

376
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:48,009
[SPEAKER_14]: And as depending on what lunch period you have that can mean you have to carry four periods worth of paperwork and binders with you for the beginning half of the day and just carry that all with you between classes which is can be a big strain and pretty pretty irritating.

377
00:35:49,386 --> 00:35:51,467
[SPEAKER_14]: Dimitris, go ahead.

378
00:35:51,487 --> 00:36:00,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Building off of what Noah said, I think the backpack rule really comes into play when you have the three minutes to get to class.

379
00:36:00,932 --> 00:36:08,456
[SPEAKER_04]: And some teachers are very strict with these policies, where if you're late, even by 30 seconds, they will mark you as late.

380
00:36:10,857 --> 00:36:16,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And even though we somewhat get time during lunch to go to our lockers,

381
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:28,542
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if this is a school committee rule or a school policy rule, but technically, after 10 minutes, we're not supposed to be allowed to go to a locker to get materials.

382
00:36:29,403 --> 00:36:43,306
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you factor in long lunch lines and just, like, crowds in the hall, it makes it really difficult to try and get to your locker without getting into, like, trouble by, like, faculty members.

383
00:36:43,606 --> 00:36:45,166
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just fine.

384
00:36:48,007 --> 00:36:48,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

385
00:36:49,284 --> 00:36:49,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody else?

386
00:36:49,784 --> 00:36:52,245
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'm going to member Graham, then member Hays.

387
00:36:54,265 --> 00:36:56,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham.

388
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:56,846
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

389
00:36:56,946 --> 00:37:04,047
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to say that I think that all of your questions about why this policy exists are completely rational.

390
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:08,328
[SPEAKER_13]: And I hope the school council will really take a look at some of those things.

391
00:37:08,988 --> 00:37:10,649
[SPEAKER_13]: My daughter says she's late every day.

392
00:37:12,109 --> 00:37:23,337
[SPEAKER_13]: from one class to another because it's not possible, even without going to a locker, it's not even possible to get from point A to point B unless you're like a star track runner and there's no one in your way, right?

393
00:37:23,398 --> 00:37:26,039
[SPEAKER_13]: So the schedule is a problem.

394
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:32,307
[SPEAKER_13]: And for the size of building so the size of building isn't going to change just yet.

395
00:37:33,548 --> 00:37:46,163
[SPEAKER_13]: But we are actively working on our scheduling and so hopefully we can be accounting for that as we're working with the scheduling folks who are there to help us figure out like how to make the schedule.

396
00:37:47,202 --> 00:37:53,487
[SPEAKER_13]: more workable between the vocational side of the house and the comprehensive side of the house.

397
00:37:53,567 --> 00:38:02,854
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm hoping that that also can be taken into account that we can't be marking students late if they can't physically get from point A to point B on time.

398
00:38:03,294 --> 00:38:09,959
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think to the larger point of inconsistency, I would encourage you all to ask

399
00:38:12,677 --> 00:38:18,659
[SPEAKER_13]: how your principal, how to let her and her team know about these inconsistencies.

400
00:38:18,739 --> 00:38:36,106
[SPEAKER_13]: Because when you're talking about 150 adults in the building, I don't think anyone's got it out for anybody, but 150 humans will make 150 different decisions without the right guidance about what to do when various things happen.

401
00:38:37,006 --> 00:38:41,950
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the question, you know, the questions for the site council are like, how do we promote consistency?

402
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:43,491
[SPEAKER_13]: How can the schedule help us?

403
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:49,316
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I think the third question for the site council for me is like, it's 2023.

404
00:38:49,376 --> 00:38:50,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you need a binder?

405
00:38:50,777 --> 00:38:53,580
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, do you need to be carrying a giant binder around?

406
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,600
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

407
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,241
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, I've

408
00:38:55,641 --> 00:38:58,362
[SPEAKER_13]: said no to binders my whole life and I'm still here.

409
00:38:58,863 --> 00:39:08,768
[SPEAKER_13]: But instructionally speaking and from a curriculum perspective, are there alternatives that like would alleviate this problem as well?

410
00:39:08,868 --> 00:39:16,191
[SPEAKER_13]: Because just being like even if you could carry a backpack and you had to carry five binders with you, like that doesn't even really seem like a solution to me.

411
00:39:16,311 --> 00:39:21,154
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm hopeful that you all will get a chance to weigh in on that with Principal Cabral.

412
00:39:21,634 --> 00:39:23,195
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I think there's a lot of

413
00:39:24,212 --> 00:39:31,595
[SPEAKER_13]: things that are possible to fix this problem that have very little, honestly, to do with whether backpacks exist or not.

414
00:39:32,576 --> 00:39:37,938
[SPEAKER_13]: So just think about what's possible, and I would encourage you to really push on that.

415
00:39:44,021 --> 00:39:44,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Hays?

416
00:39:46,602 --> 00:39:47,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

417
00:39:47,562 --> 00:39:49,203
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to say, you know, I think

418
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:58,756
[SPEAKER_01]: This issue with backpacks, I don't know if any of you have actually attended any school committee meetings, but this is a big topic that has come up a couple of times.

419
00:39:59,217 --> 00:40:18,170
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, when we last year had a culture and climate review done by an outside consultant, that came up as an issue that he saw to both the physical needs of the students being able to carry around your stuff, being able to get from point A to point B in time,

420
00:40:18,632 --> 00:40:23,895
[SPEAKER_01]: get to lunch, all of that, but also the inconsistencies among teachers and how they handle the backpack.

421
00:40:23,915 --> 00:40:26,676
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the things you've brought up, he brought up too.

422
00:40:26,796 --> 00:40:34,861
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to say, you know, you guys really are on topic with things that also the consultant saw as being issues.

423
00:40:35,121 --> 00:40:47,267
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think we do need to look at a school, as a school committee, as whether there are any ways that we can support

424
00:40:49,403 --> 00:40:50,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Changes to this policy.

425
00:40:50,644 --> 00:40:53,946
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that it's, you know, there is a lot that the site council does.

426
00:40:53,986 --> 00:40:55,848
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be honest, I've only been on for two years.

427
00:40:56,088 --> 00:41:04,194
[SPEAKER_01]: So my understanding of kind of the What becomes school committee policy versus what becomes a site council issue.

428
00:41:05,074 --> 00:41:12,960
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still not 100% clear on myself, but I again in terms of this, this group of people of students coming together.

429
00:41:13,499 --> 00:41:33,023
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's incredibly helpful for us to hear directly from you what the issues are with the backpack policy, how it affects you in your being able to navigate around the school, being able to get places on time, the differences in how teachers handle both the backpack issue and the issue of if you're a little bit late because of that.

430
00:41:34,163 --> 00:41:36,184
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this is really valuable to hear.

431
00:41:36,204 --> 00:41:39,804
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, again, maybe it's a site council issue.

432
00:41:39,844 --> 00:41:42,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we as school committee also need to talk about is there

433
00:41:42,884 --> 00:41:55,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there some space for us to also support policy-wise in terms of student wellness, student mental health, whatever, to be able to alleviate that stress?

434
00:41:55,334 --> 00:41:58,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that sounds like it's a pretty significant stress around a lot of kids.

435
00:41:59,137 --> 00:42:08,304
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for... And I think at my level, I feel pretty confident that once it goes to school site council with the many opinions that there are already out there,

436
00:42:08,866 --> 00:42:22,149
[SPEAKER_11]: as well as what we've already collected that we'll be able to have the support to, um, re look at the policy and move something forward.

437
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:25,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds great.

438
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:25,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

439
00:42:28,231 --> 00:42:28,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

440
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:36,973
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that we're coming close to the end of our time today and we still have a little bit more to get to, but, um,

441
00:42:37,706 --> 00:42:42,528
[SPEAKER_09]: I think one of the biggest things with backpacks and homework are school policies are set.

442
00:42:42,548 --> 00:42:45,628
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not meant to be forever, or school rules are set.

443
00:42:45,969 --> 00:42:51,330
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not necessarily meant to be forever, but in a lot of places they've been accepted to be that way.

444
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:55,571
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's really important for voice to be there to change them.

445
00:42:57,352 --> 00:43:03,114
[SPEAKER_09]: But would anybody like to speak quickly on community spirit and the support for MHS?

446
00:43:05,276 --> 00:43:34,399
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of support for student voices, one thing I wanted clarification from either the school committee or the administration would be, if we're allowed as a student advisory committee to accept, like, add more members to the committee, because we only have 13 members to represent the entire school of students, which is roughly 1,300, which is my belief, and I'm sure there's a belief of others on the committee,

447
00:43:41,595 --> 00:43:44,637
[SPEAKER_09]: So my answer to that has always been yes.

448
00:43:45,238 --> 00:43:48,039
[SPEAKER_09]: We ran into challenges, Ciara knows, last year.

449
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:58,025
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really challenging to hold during the school day meetings and then when we'd have meetings after school, sometimes the attendance wasn't really that great.

450
00:43:58,946 --> 00:44:03,989
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's finding the sweet spot of the right time

451
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:08,231
[SPEAKER_09]: to get students really invested and really involved.

452
00:44:08,471 --> 00:44:10,372
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd love to hear your suggestions for that.

453
00:44:12,192 --> 00:44:18,974
[SPEAKER_09]: And making sure that Sierra was really great at this as well is making sure that we are agenda driven agenda focused.

454
00:44:19,194 --> 00:44:20,955
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would agree with you Darren.

455
00:44:21,235 --> 00:44:26,356
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm someone who believes that student voice really helps to lift and carry a school.

456
00:44:26,876 --> 00:44:30,677
[SPEAKER_09]: That student engagement and involvement helps to lift and carry a school.

457
00:44:30,697 --> 00:44:30,757
[SPEAKER_09]: And

458
00:44:33,308 --> 00:44:43,935
[SPEAKER_09]: The reality is that you guys you students are the ones who are going to be the real force of change not just for men at high school or friends.

459
00:44:44,876 --> 00:44:45,916
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

460
00:44:45,936 --> 00:44:50,699
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I would say absolutely like the more the merrier.

461
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:55,783
[SPEAKER_09]: But yes now.

462
00:44:57,045 --> 00:44:59,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Part of this is driven by laws of the Commonwealth.

463
00:44:59,667 --> 00:45:04,631
[SPEAKER_09]: And so there are five specific that there is a law that sets five.

464
00:45:04,831 --> 00:45:06,913
[SPEAKER_09]: I have always interpreted that as a minimum.

465
00:45:08,034 --> 00:45:17,482
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've loosely interpreted the law, but there's also could be seen a strict interpretation of law that five is five, but I've always seen it as a loose interpretation.

466
00:45:17,762 --> 00:45:20,244
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize, Madam Mayor for going on.

467
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:22,766
[SPEAKER_06]: You're good member Hays.

468
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:24,507
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll talk about

469
00:45:25,424 --> 00:45:28,385
[SPEAKER_06]: community spirit for the next five minutes before we close out.

470
00:45:28,865 --> 00:45:29,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Hays.

471
00:45:29,905 --> 00:45:30,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thank you.

472
00:45:30,665 --> 00:45:46,429
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think in really trying to get this going, we did look carefully at the law and at the policy, which is really the policy is directly from the law.

473
00:45:46,909 --> 00:45:49,289
[SPEAKER_01]: The law is pretty specific in saying five.

474
00:45:49,569 --> 00:45:51,090
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't really say why.

475
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:52,050
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one of the

476
00:45:53,809 --> 00:46:05,274
[SPEAKER_01]: at least my personal thought behind that was whenever you get a huge group of people, it can be harder to have a clear voice come through.

477
00:46:05,294 --> 00:46:14,157
[SPEAKER_01]: It can make it more difficult actually to run a meeting if you have 20 people trying to all kind of get their thoughts through.

478
00:46:15,097 --> 00:46:18,699
[SPEAKER_01]: So my sense was that this was an attempt to make sure that we really

479
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:29,319
[SPEAKER_01]: hear student voices, that by having a smaller number, there really is more time for direct back and forth for the members who are the five members involved.

480
00:46:29,959 --> 00:46:35,801
[SPEAKER_01]: And also similar just to every level of our government, you're representing.

481
00:46:36,481 --> 00:46:46,803
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true that the more people, maybe you feel it could be more representative, and I guess we could say that for probably any, we could say that for school committee, city council, at some point,

482
00:46:47,577 --> 00:46:52,560
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and we can talk about this and adjust it if people feel really strongly about it.

483
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,901
[SPEAKER_01]: But at some point, that is the point, you guys are the representatives.

484
00:46:56,281 --> 00:47:08,288
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the question becomes, how do you get out and get the voices of the other students so that you can gather all that information and the five of you bring it back to us?

485
00:47:10,048 --> 00:47:14,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think that no matter, you know, we could have 20 members

486
00:47:15,444 --> 00:47:17,626
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people still might not feel represented.

487
00:47:17,686 --> 00:47:21,450
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so it still would come back to how do we either.

488
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:22,691
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we support you in doing it.

489
00:47:22,812 --> 00:47:37,667
[SPEAKER_01]: How do the advisors who are working with you support you in figuring out how to get a larger representation through your outreach or through your availability to talk to other students, whether you can do surveys, just

490
00:47:38,603 --> 00:47:46,230
[SPEAKER_01]: what other ways can you make sure that you're hearing from more students than just obviously yourselves or your friends?

491
00:47:48,672 --> 00:47:52,014
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not closed off to adding more.

492
00:47:53,115 --> 00:47:54,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Five was the way the law is written.

493
00:47:56,218 --> 00:48:05,626
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, like I said, I think we need to think about where do we fall, where it gets to just be too many people in a room and not enough ability to really

494
00:48:07,543 --> 00:48:08,584
[SPEAKER_01]: to talk directly.

495
00:48:16,508 --> 00:48:21,650
[SPEAKER_09]: This is definitely a topic that needs to be carried forward as well.

496
00:48:23,431 --> 00:48:36,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if this would fall under support for MHS students and student voices, but a concern that the Student Advisory Committee has is that we're not even mentioned

497
00:48:37,955 --> 00:48:39,836
[SPEAKER_04]: in the handbook.

498
00:48:40,156 --> 00:48:44,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if it was mentioned on the school committee policy.

499
00:48:45,038 --> 00:48:45,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

500
00:48:45,678 --> 00:48:47,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't had a chance to look at it.

501
00:48:47,899 --> 00:49:06,427
[SPEAKER_04]: But we feel that we should have an overview of what we do and our responsibilities as a student advisory committee highlighted in school policy so that we're more directed in what we do.

502
00:49:07,366 --> 00:49:31,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Going off of that, having something in writing in the handbook, something that we all read when we first come here, having something in writing showing us that we do have a voice, that there is ways for us to make ourselves heard, kind of gives off, kind of shows that that's what we're here to do, kind of gives off the impression that that's an integral part of the school and how we work.

503
00:49:32,881 --> 00:49:35,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and on that point, I think that's something we've been trying to do a lot.

504
00:49:35,874 --> 00:49:41,695
[SPEAKER_02]: It's making sure that students know that we exist, and we've been doing a lot of work trying to reach out to students.

505
00:49:42,195 --> 00:49:49,416
[SPEAKER_02]: I think tomorrow in the homeroom, we have an advisory activity, something about schools or something like that.

506
00:49:49,957 --> 00:49:57,758
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're trying to really get out there to the students and let them know that we are working for them, that we want to hear their voice.

507
00:50:08,191 --> 00:50:08,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry.

508
00:50:08,692 --> 00:50:13,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and then it's, if students are done, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, then I'll turn it to you, Member Hays.

509
00:50:15,414 --> 00:50:23,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess just quickly going off of that, the student government, as a representative of the student government, were also sparsely mentioned in the school handbook.

510
00:50:24,778 --> 00:50:33,281
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing relating to our responsibilities for, I guess, like jurisdiction or what we do, only regarding like our election process.

511
00:50:34,321 --> 00:50:35,662
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that's something I wanted to add.

512
00:50:40,814 --> 00:50:41,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vinson.

513
00:50:42,614 --> 00:50:43,495
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, thank you, Mayor.

514
00:50:43,975 --> 00:50:46,115
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you, students.

515
00:50:46,915 --> 00:50:55,177
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to say that I was just really pleased listening today, hearing your three major topics of homework policy, backpacks.

516
00:50:55,977 --> 00:51:00,018
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm excited about the school spirit week that's going to kick off next week.

517
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:06,160
[SPEAKER_00]: I am interested to hear what you're going to just say about what else you would like to see at the high school.

518
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:16,825
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just looking forward to having more sessions so that we're really taking your feedback to make the high school become the best high school in the state.

519
00:51:17,305 --> 00:51:23,548
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also want to thank your assistant principal, Sheila Freitas-Haley, and your principal, Ms.

520
00:51:23,588 --> 00:51:26,670
[SPEAKER_00]: Marta Cabral, for their leadership

521
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:33,134
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working with you and Dr. Cushing from my senior team working with you as well.

522
00:51:33,214 --> 00:51:35,536
[SPEAKER_00]: So just thank you for bringing your authenticity.

523
00:51:36,056 --> 00:51:37,697
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do look forward to reading your

524
00:51:40,011 --> 00:51:54,040
[SPEAKER_00]: homework policy document more carefully, because I know I wasn't able to read everything online, but thank you for taking the time to actually produce a beautifully written document to explain your rationale.

525
00:51:54,641 --> 00:51:59,564
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to comment and say thank you, and I'm really pleased with what you've done thus far.

526
00:52:00,465 --> 00:52:00,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

527
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:04,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Hays.

528
00:52:06,829 --> 00:52:07,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

529
00:52:09,008 --> 00:52:10,508
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly to give a little background too.

530
00:52:10,649 --> 00:52:14,670
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys have had a student advisory council.

531
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:20,372
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I'd have to look, I don't personally know how that's designated in the handbook.

532
00:52:21,292 --> 00:52:24,673
[SPEAKER_01]: This piece of it, meeting with school committee is brand new.

533
00:52:24,713 --> 00:52:27,494
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are the first, this is the first time this has ever happened.

534
00:52:28,474 --> 00:52:30,975
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a law that was, I don't,

535
00:52:31,274 --> 00:52:34,136
[SPEAKER_01]: quite no, maybe three or four years ago put into place.

536
00:52:34,156 --> 00:52:51,826
[SPEAKER_01]: And from my research that I've done, we may be one of only a handful of districts who's really trying to figure out a good way to do this, to make sure that we have these every other month meetings at a minimum, that's how the law's written, that it has to be at least every other month.

537
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:59,831
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think part of your role as being the first group too, is to help us understand

538
00:53:02,363 --> 00:53:03,364
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out how to do this.

539
00:53:03,744 --> 00:53:06,726
[SPEAKER_01]: The law doesn't give us any details of how to make this happen.

540
00:53:06,746 --> 00:53:07,806
[SPEAKER_01]: It just says do this.

541
00:53:08,547 --> 00:53:10,968
[SPEAKER_01]: It says you know you need to have a student advisory committee.

542
00:53:11,268 --> 00:53:12,509
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to meet every other month.

543
00:53:12,529 --> 00:53:21,414
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to meet directly with the school committee so they have direct access to the decision makers, so to speak, and are part of the decision making process.

544
00:53:22,035 --> 00:53:23,896
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think part of what you can.

545
00:53:24,276 --> 00:53:28,178
[SPEAKER_01]: You can really be have an active role in this year is helping the

546
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:31,406
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out how to make this work.

547
00:53:32,027 --> 00:53:53,472
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there needs to be more students, you can help figure out how to make that happen, how it gets written into the student handbook, how the two pieces of the student advisory council, which may end up being larger than the smaller group of the student advisory committee, which then you get into some semantics there, and it can get a little confusing.

548
00:53:53,512 --> 00:53:59,214
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think you guys can really be crucial in helping shape this for future

549
00:53:59,744 --> 00:54:00,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Years too.

550
00:54:01,065 --> 00:54:17,062
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, thank you for for doing this and think about that as when we go away from today is start thinking about what you think would work really well and how how to help shape this whole idea of student involvement and decision making.

551
00:54:19,232 --> 00:54:23,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful, I'll say ditto to Dr. Edouard-Vincent and member Hays.

552
00:54:23,273 --> 00:54:27,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for being here today and we'll definitely continue the conversation.

553
00:54:27,535 --> 00:54:40,279
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we'd be happy to support any ideas you have when you have another meeting without us on how to let the student body know what you're doing and that you want their input and more involvement.

554
00:54:40,299 --> 00:54:42,619
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're happy to brainstorm ideas with you as well.

555
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,380
[SPEAKER_06]: With that,

556
00:54:45,461 --> 00:54:46,181
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a 3.30.

557
00:54:46,342 --> 00:54:49,624
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure you all have other things to do, but we really appreciate your time.

558
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:55,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Great agenda, and we look forward to the next conversation, which I believe the schedule's been set.

559
00:54:55,647 --> 00:54:56,988
[SPEAKER_06]: The next one's in January, correct?

560
00:54:57,068 --> 00:54:58,229
