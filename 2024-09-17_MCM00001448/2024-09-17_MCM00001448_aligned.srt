1
00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:08,753
I want to call to order the meeting of Medford's Community Preservation Committee on Tuesday, May 14th, 2024, 6.30 p.m.

2
00:00:08,773 --> 00:00:16,474
We are meeting hybrid, both in room 201 at Medford City Hall and via Zoom.

3
00:00:17,074 --> 00:00:25,016
So the meeting being held in hybrid to view and participate in the meeting, you can be in either location.

4
00:00:25,798 --> 00:00:36,902
or call in by phone, all of the information is provided in our agenda and we'll post the meeting as soon as possible, a recording of the meeting on the city's website afterward.

5
00:00:38,403 --> 00:00:44,505
So first on the agenda is to review the minutes from March 12th and April 9th.

6
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:50,968
And those were in the meeting packets that was submitted last week.

7
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:52,848
Do you want me to pull it up on screen or?

8
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:53,109
Sure.

9
00:00:57,635 --> 00:01:00,857
We have Kayleen.

10
00:01:00,937 --> 00:01:02,538
Thanks for joining us, Kayleen.

11
00:01:02,919 --> 00:01:08,983
Probably can't hear me quite yet.

12
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:10,184
Sorry, I couldn't get the link to work.

13
00:01:10,524 --> 00:01:11,544
I had to manually put it in.

14
00:01:11,564 --> 00:01:13,606
No worries.

15
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:16,448
Glad you're here.

16
00:01:16,808 --> 00:01:20,650
I need to bring a mouse with me next time.

17
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:22,832
Trackpad is not working.

18
00:01:24,053 --> 00:01:24,373
Okay.

19
00:01:24,823 --> 00:01:27,664
I'm going to go ahead and share my screen.

20
00:01:32,585 --> 00:01:34,806
Zoom needs to stop changing things up on me.

21
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:40,267
So here we have, and you guys in the room are not seeing it because I need to drag it over.

22
00:01:40,287 --> 00:01:42,108
Is everybody still seeing meeting minutes?

23
00:01:42,148 --> 00:01:42,468
Yes.

24
00:01:43,128 --> 00:01:43,628
Very good.

25
00:01:43,648 --> 00:01:48,069
This is for the March 12th.

26
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:51,570
Now I'm seeing a stained glass window.

27
00:01:53,261 --> 00:01:54,622
I was seeing the meeting minutes.

28
00:01:55,903 --> 00:02:01,687
That's okay, you can leave.

29
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,252
Let's see.

30
00:02:10,153 --> 00:02:10,693
There you go.

31
00:02:11,454 --> 00:02:12,335
Thank you.

32
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:15,917
So this had a correction.

33
00:02:15,937 --> 00:02:18,719
I accidentally kept Joan in attendance.

34
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,900
Joan is not there.

35
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,462
So that has been corrected here.

36
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:36,216
So this is just to accept the meeting minutes that we accepted them, not that we approved them, just that we received them, right?

37
00:02:36,897 --> 00:02:38,017
Correct.

38
00:02:39,098 --> 00:02:44,143
So I see both of the 312 and 49 meeting minutes in the drop box.

39
00:02:45,043 --> 00:02:49,647
So motion to accept the meeting minutes from 312 and 49.

40
00:02:49,747 --> 00:02:49,887
Second.

41
00:02:56,853 --> 00:02:59,334
All right.

42
00:02:59,574 --> 00:03:00,955
So I will call the roll.

43
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:02,195
Doug?

44
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:02,735
Yes.

45
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:03,836
Kaylene?

46
00:03:04,896 --> 00:03:05,136
Yes.

47
00:03:07,277 --> 00:03:07,617
Joan?

48
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:08,797
Yes.

49
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:10,298
And Ari?

50
00:03:11,178 --> 00:03:11,458
Yes.

51
00:03:12,218 --> 00:03:13,198
And myself, yes.

52
00:03:14,339 --> 00:03:15,619
Meeting minutes are accepted.

53
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,441
So next on the agenda is small grant application from Trees Medford.

54
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:33,472
So I would like to, if you could bring the application up on the screen, and I would invite Amanda and Sarah to tell us about your application.

55
00:03:33,492 --> 00:03:36,797
Can you hear me?

56
00:03:38,113 --> 00:03:39,234
Yes.

57
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:41,537
Great, thank you.

58
00:03:42,698 --> 00:03:45,462
We got a big grant from DCR.

59
00:03:45,882 --> 00:03:52,329
As you know, you guys already helped us with funding and inventory of the cemetery trees, and that was a few years ago.

60
00:03:54,652 --> 00:04:11,814
We got a grant from DCR and a private grant put together to fund an inventory of all the city trees, and we got an estimate from Davie Tree, which turned out to be a bit low, so they got going on the inventory this summer.

61
00:04:12,715 --> 00:04:20,104
this winter, spring, and found that they used up the money before they finished.

62
00:04:20,264 --> 00:04:21,725
So we decided to do two things.

63
00:04:21,906 --> 00:04:27,672
One is to separate out the parks and do the parks separately.

64
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:35,197
And the other is to go back to DCR for additional funds to finish.

65
00:04:35,698 --> 00:04:39,920
Basically, West Medford is the part of the inventory that has not been completed.

66
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,182
And because you all because of the open space part of the CPC.

67
00:04:46,825 --> 00:05:03,957
mandate and we thought this was a good use it really will be great to to keep track of all those trees and we we anticipate we're already as we get these inventories making sure that they're loaded into the

68
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:31,070
City GIS system, we have an agreement that we've put in place with the DPW to commit to over the next year or so to establishing a means for using this data, maintaining this data, and updating this data so that it doesn't become obsolete

69
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,551
that we've put good money toward it.

70
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,492
So that's the basic idea.

71
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:43,453
Thank you.

72
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:46,394
Anything to add?

73
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:50,455
Questions from the committee?

74
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:57,937
I was going to say it's at the end of the tree inventory.

75
00:06:00,369 --> 00:06:01,291
This is not the end.

76
00:06:02,673 --> 00:06:09,485
Um, well, we, we still have to go back to DCR for the West Medford segment, but everything else in the city is done.

77
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:13,972
So, what is the.

78
00:06:15,104 --> 00:06:17,366
total project cost, including DCR, because the request is for $5,000.

79
00:06:17,406 --> 00:06:17,546
Right.

80
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:21,929
We're estimating that the park trees are 1,000 trees, and this is how much 1,000 trees would cost.

81
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,231
And so we are going to contribute the $500 to get us up to the right amount.

82
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:47,867
The total cost, we spent $25,000 on the city street tree inventory.

83
00:06:48,588 --> 00:06:58,734
Most recently, we did another project where we did just South Medford a few years ago, and that, if I remember right, was $5,000.

84
00:06:59,454 --> 00:07:01,315
I think that's right.

85
00:07:03,732 --> 00:07:10,933
Yeah, it's just that you're actually asking for a much lower percentage of the actual total cost of all trees.

86
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:15,274
It's more like you're asking like 15% non.

87
00:07:15,294 --> 00:07:22,276
Oh yeah, no, we can redo the budget if that makes more sense, but we just broke it out as a separate project kind of.

88
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,976
Yeah, no, I just wanted to know the context, thank you.

89
00:07:24,996 --> 00:07:29,617
Okay, this is very helpful.

90
00:07:32,628 --> 00:07:34,490
Other questions from committee members?

91
00:07:40,617 --> 00:07:48,586
Not a question, but will the results of this study inform the Medford Square master plan?

92
00:07:51,120 --> 00:08:03,175
It will go into the vulnerability analysis that is currently underway and that will inform the other plan.

93
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:25,382
The consultants who are working on the vulnerability assessment are definitely excited about this data to be used for the larger, assuming the city gets the grant, for the larger urban forestry master plan.

94
00:08:26,202 --> 00:08:28,284
This will inform that heavily.

95
00:08:28,304 --> 00:08:35,930
I have a question that is maybe not related because

96
00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:46,540
So just out of curiosity, I wonder if you know anything about the trees in the McDonald Park, and is that included in this study?

97
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:48,882
Because that's a DCR park.

98
00:08:48,902 --> 00:08:50,342
That's what I thought, yeah.

99
00:08:50,522 --> 00:09:00,627
Yeah, and we know they need to do lots of work because Sarah and I went over a year ago and observed all the dead ashes in McDonald Park, and it was really sad.

100
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,688
So there's work to be done over there.

101
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:11,126
Yeah, we we asked Davey tree why the initial estimates were so far off.

102
00:09:11,486 --> 00:09:20,512
And they said and they say, well, I said, well, you've done this for other communities.

103
00:09:20,612 --> 00:09:23,854
How come Medford's were so far off?

104
00:09:23,894 --> 00:09:27,336
And they said, well, the other communities already had

105
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,241
inventories and Medford doesn't.

106
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:36,724
Or not so much that they already had inventories, but they had a pretty good ballpark idea of how many trees they had.

107
00:09:36,904 --> 00:09:39,765
And in our case, we were a little bit flying blind.

108
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:40,746
Yeah.

109
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:43,507
Not surprising.

110
00:09:45,548 --> 00:09:53,392
So this is really a first, a first tranche of data for the city for this information.

111
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:56,513
And it's really important that

112
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:07,103
that the city be able to manage its forest resources, which are very valuable appropriately.

113
00:10:09,603 --> 00:10:15,925
And who will be maintaining this inventory after it's completed?

114
00:10:17,686 --> 00:10:20,807
We've worked a little bit with, I can do it.

115
00:10:20,827 --> 00:10:21,847
With Tim.

116
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:31,868
Well, we've talked to Tim and Tim has signed the agreement about management of data, but we have worked a little bit with.

117
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:52,515
He has loaded the data we've generated so far into the inventory, and he's also been working with Aggie to create lists of new trees that have been planted that he's mapping and stuff like that.

118
00:10:53,355 --> 00:11:00,878
But he's pretty heavily committed, so they're going to have to figure out a way to get a little more GIS savvy.

119
00:11:01,798 --> 00:11:03,078
into City Hall somehow.

120
00:11:03,258 --> 00:11:09,400
And that's what we're looking forward to hearing how they're going to do it.

121
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:22,502
And one of the stipulations before we sent them a bunch of money from various grants was that this be maintained, that they maintain the data.

122
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:25,783
And we have an MOU to that effect.

123
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:36,899
I wonder if there's some opportunity for partnership with the planning department.

124
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:42,025
We tend to get several interns that last throughout.

125
00:11:42,045 --> 00:11:45,429
They'll commit to a whole year and they all have GIS experience.

126
00:11:45,489 --> 00:11:47,572
I think in the past they've helped before.

127
00:11:47,952 --> 00:11:48,312
They have.

128
00:11:48,613 --> 00:11:52,918
There was one guy in particular who worked very closely with Aggie and did some wonderful mapping.

129
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,921
of new trees plantings over a number over 10 year period.

130
00:11:57,401 --> 00:12:08,229
And those files, I think it was you who figured out that those files still exist on a computer somewhere.

131
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:10,450
So we look forward to, yeah.

132
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,392
And an intern can totally do what needs doing.

133
00:12:13,492 --> 00:12:16,495
It's just that their workflow needs to be set up.

134
00:12:17,255 --> 00:12:17,695
Right.

135
00:12:19,617 --> 00:12:19,877
Okay.

136
00:12:23,057 --> 00:12:24,637
That could be a solution.

137
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,258
Any further discussion?

138
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:38,881
Would anyone like to make a motion to recommend the funding of $5,000 for the Park Street?

139
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:40,081
I'm sorry.

140
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:41,321
I'm going to back up.

141
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:52,204
I had talked about this with Teresa earlier today, and now a suggestion that I wanted to put on the table for the committee's consideration.

142
00:12:53,206 --> 00:13:20,658
is whether a tree inventory for the parks is more appropriate to fund out of our project budget, or if this is something that we should consider funding out of our administrative budget, because the administrative budget is intended to help provide the committee with information that we need

143
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:24,620
to be able to administer this grant program.

144
00:13:25,081 --> 00:13:40,211
The information in this case being the condition of the trees in our parks, which will help to establish whether, you know, what the priorities are for tree planting in the city.

145
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:49,437
So I think it could fit either way in our programmatic budget or in our administrative budget, and I wanted to see

146
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,881
what your thoughts are, Joan.

147
00:13:53,742 --> 00:14:02,728
My first thought is how is this different from every other study that we have funded through the regular funding?

148
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:13,535
Design for any kind of improvement is really part of the process of making that improvement.

149
00:14:15,002 --> 00:14:23,248
And we did previously fund the Oak Grove Cemetery tree inventory out of our programmatic budget.

150
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:35,116
And I don't think we really considered the question about whether that could be an administrative project rather than a programmatic project at the time.

151
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:50,351
But comparable, we have talked about studying, for example, just doing an inventory of accessibility needs across playgrounds, which is comparable to an inventory, to a tree inventory across the parks.

152
00:14:51,272 --> 00:15:00,159
And so that might have been done as an administrative project rather than a programmatic project.

153
00:15:06,228 --> 00:15:11,369
What have we been spending our administrative budget on for, say, the last 2 years?

154
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:14,870
Because I feel like I understand what we spend our program budget on.

155
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:17,351
Um, is the answer Teresa?

156
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:26,173
Teresa and our various subscriptions and dues that we pay for, but does this effectively stretch our budget?

157
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:32,335
Like, more we have more funds fund if we're using a little admin in the middle of grants.

158
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:46,528
It's going to shake out probably the same either way because any administrative funds that are not spent in that fiscal year roll over into our program funds for the future.

159
00:15:47,308 --> 00:15:54,175
So either way, this will come out of our program budget.

160
00:15:57,674 --> 00:16:00,517
Yeah, so I don't think it really impacts our budget.

161
00:16:00,578 --> 00:16:12,471
It's really more about setting a precedent for the kinds of projects that we will consider for programs versus administrative.

162
00:16:14,957 --> 00:16:39,647
So I always thought that the administrative budget was really for the administration of the CPA, you know, law and the ordinance and the administrative support of the process of, you know, CPA versus administration related to any particular one grant or one, you know, submission.

163
00:16:42,722 --> 00:16:57,073
An example that was given to us back in the beginning was that it could also be used for due diligence in case of projects where more information is needed before we were ready to.

164
00:16:57,774 --> 00:16:58,294
That's true.

165
00:16:58,374 --> 00:17:11,504
Doug, what do you think?

166
00:17:14,832 --> 00:17:19,415
It sounds like it's, it's something we haven't done just because we haven't really thought of it.

167
00:17:19,475 --> 00:17:25,438
And obviously I don't think we're stretching the boundaries here too much of the guardrails for either.

168
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,239
So I'm okay with doing it.

169
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:32,722
It's also not a lot of money in that two points or almost $3 million.

170
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:34,584
It seems like we have to play with here.

171
00:17:35,844 --> 00:17:42,208
So I don't think we'll be doing this for a million dollars, you know, hundreds of thousand dollar grants, most likely smaller stuff.

172
00:17:42,268 --> 00:17:42,508
Right.

173
00:17:43,068 --> 00:17:43,609
No, because it's,

174
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,530
It's just a scale thing.

175
00:17:47,811 --> 00:17:57,715
One thing to consider is, so one significant difference is that if we fund it out of the administrative budget, it does not go through city council.

176
00:17:59,035 --> 00:18:02,736
If we fund it out of... Wow, that's... I want to see the reactions.

177
00:18:02,756 --> 00:18:03,497
Like, oh my God.

178
00:18:14,737 --> 00:18:28,703
It's at our discretion how we spend the administrative budget, but the programmatic budget goes through City Council.

179
00:18:29,364 --> 00:18:33,686
I get the due diligence piece.

180
00:18:33,966 --> 00:18:40,168
I just wonder if, and I'm trying to think back to when we met with the CP coalition,

181
00:18:42,653 --> 00:18:54,656
If that due diligence was really geared toward an application that we had already decided should be funded, but more information was needed.

182
00:18:55,656 --> 00:19:04,178
So it was an add-on that we would do the due diligence for versus this is straight up the application.

183
00:19:04,198 --> 00:19:05,058
You know what I mean?

184
00:19:08,567 --> 00:19:18,053
I don't really feel comfortable, given what you just said, also reminding me that spending out of the administrative budget doesn't go through the city council.

185
00:19:18,113 --> 00:19:19,794
This really should.

186
00:19:19,814 --> 00:19:21,956
Okay.

187
00:19:22,376 --> 00:19:25,718
Because it's a tangible part of spending, yeah.

188
00:19:25,758 --> 00:19:26,539
I see that point.

189
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:31,903
Yeah, I appreciate that input.

190
00:19:32,303 --> 00:19:33,103
Transparency.

191
00:19:33,123 --> 00:19:33,303
Yeah.

192
00:19:34,164 --> 00:19:34,404
Right.

193
00:19:35,265 --> 00:19:35,525
Got it.

194
00:19:37,096 --> 00:19:37,676
Well, thank you.

195
00:19:37,696 --> 00:19:43,220
That's helpful that we can tease it out.

196
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:55,128
So with that, I would ask if there is a motion to recommend the funding from our, I don't know if we have to specify.

197
00:19:55,148 --> 00:19:56,650
Did you have a question, Sarah?

198
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:02,894
If you can continue, I have a question for after you've done that.

199
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:12,113
So do we have the funds in the general fund budget or is it in an open space reserve right now?

200
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:13,753
And do we need to specify?

201
00:20:13,773 --> 00:20:15,614
We have enough to cover this.

202
00:20:16,274 --> 00:20:17,594
Do we need to specify?

203
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:20,515
Yes, when it comes time for the mayor's recommendation.

204
00:20:20,555 --> 00:20:22,436
But at this point, we don't have to specify.

205
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:28,298
So looking for a motion for a recommendation to fund $5,000 for the parks tree inventory.

206
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,881
I'll make that motion.

207
00:20:37,482 --> 00:20:38,142
I'll second.

208
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,484
All right.

209
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:44,387
Then I will call the roll.

210
00:20:45,588 --> 00:20:45,908
Joan?

211
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:46,989
Yes.

212
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:48,290
Ari?

213
00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:49,991
Yes.

214
00:20:50,932 --> 00:20:51,372
Doug?

215
00:20:51,693 --> 00:20:51,953
Yes.

216
00:20:52,373 --> 00:20:52,913
Kaylene?

217
00:20:53,734 --> 00:20:53,994
Yes.

218
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:55,255
Reg?

219
00:20:56,136 --> 00:20:56,436
Yes.

220
00:20:57,417 --> 00:20:58,378
And myself, yes.

221
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,460
Excellent.

222
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,721
Regulation passes.

223
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,982
We make the recommendation

224
00:21:04,672 --> 00:21:06,753
And Sarah, did you have a question?

225
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:18,881
Yes, I just wondered if you had any update about the status of the plan for funding the cemetery plan?

226
00:21:20,422 --> 00:21:24,684
Yes, that one, I plan to resurrect.

227
00:21:24,845 --> 00:21:26,686
I appreciate your patience with that one.

228
00:21:26,806 --> 00:21:28,767
Just this spring has kind of hit me hard.

229
00:21:29,627 --> 00:21:33,450
My intention is to get another meeting going on that one in early June.

230
00:21:35,112 --> 00:21:36,893
But yes, that's still in the works.

231
00:21:38,094 --> 00:21:46,859
And were you able to get approval for the entire cemetery, or is it still limited to the historic section?

232
00:21:48,420 --> 00:22:02,307
Oh, so in terms of the legal opinion on if trees in the new section, if they would be as considered for passive recreation, we did get a legal opinion on that, and they did deem that it would be eligible.

233
00:22:03,226 --> 00:22:07,007
have to go before City Council, but congratulations, and like I said, we'll be in touch.

234
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:37,614
I would like to make sure we add a note to that, not for the motion, but just to put the context of the other funds that are, have been brought back to us.

235
00:22:37,634 --> 00:22:41,854
We've got some notes that are $30,000 elsewhere that others have spent.

236
00:22:41,874 --> 00:22:47,996
And this is a, this is like 17 or 18% of the actual total global.

237
00:22:48,136 --> 00:22:49,076
Sure.

238
00:22:49,216 --> 00:22:49,776
Holistically.

239
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:50,356
I think so.

240
00:22:50,376 --> 00:22:53,437
I think it'll just help them understand that it's not just us.

241
00:22:53,637 --> 00:22:59,178
These guys have done a great job finding money from many other sources, which most of our grants don't.

242
00:22:59,825 --> 00:23:00,065
Right.

243
00:23:00,525 --> 00:23:02,427
They definitely hit the pavement.

244
00:23:02,687 --> 00:23:03,047
They did.

245
00:23:03,427 --> 00:23:03,707
Yeah.

246
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:05,789
They should be awarded or at least acknowledged for it.

247
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:07,750
I will.

248
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:08,750
Thank you.

249
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:11,132
OK.

250
00:23:11,272 --> 00:23:13,093
All right.

251
00:23:15,114 --> 00:23:18,997
If it gets a little loud, please let us know.

252
00:23:19,057 --> 00:23:24,620
There's a city council transition right now, and there's a lot of noise coming from the hallway.

253
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,462
So if it gets, if it picks up on the microphones, please let us know.

254
00:23:29,586 --> 00:23:36,932
But otherwise, next on the agenda is the annual plan update.

255
00:23:37,552 --> 00:23:47,840
So, we're going to begin we have a few steps of what we need to go over tonight, but we'll begin with just an overview of the whole plan update.

256
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,944
So, it's been how long since we had a plan update 2021.

257
00:23:53,244 --> 00:23:55,205
Yeah, so it's been a couple of years.

258
00:23:56,346 --> 00:23:57,447
And we are.

259
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,042
It looks good.

260
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:05,527
I am going to share.

261
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:18,902
So while you do that, the goal is for us to have this plan completed at the same time that we send to city council the motion for the small grant application and for our annual budget.

262
00:24:19,605 --> 00:24:23,766
So this evening, we can talk about the whole thing.

263
00:24:23,786 --> 00:24:26,447
Hopefully everyone has a chance to read it.

264
00:24:26,887 --> 00:24:33,429
If you have any further comments, send them to Teresa this week so that we can wrap up the plan all together.

265
00:24:33,449 --> 00:24:34,749
Yes.

266
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:39,190
I'm not sure if folks had the opportunity to skim it.

267
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,151
I mean, it is many pages.

268
00:24:41,171 --> 00:24:44,492
So I understand if you weren't able to fully digest it.

269
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:57,275
largely what the plan, it just evaluates what we intend to do as a CPC, as a committee, by also taking in consideration feedback from the community.

270
00:24:57,435 --> 00:25:09,961
So that's ultimately, in very, very layman's terms, the purpose of this annual plan is to inform the public on what we're seeing, what we're doing, and the reasoning behind it all.

271
00:25:11,341 --> 00:25:15,203
So especially for the new folks, as a new folk, I found it very,

272
00:25:16,803 --> 00:25:22,967
helpful to be writing this and it helps you digest exactly what it is that we do here.

273
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:30,532
So I highly recommend for everybody to really read through it, but definitely the new folks.

274
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:40,418
So I don't want to go page by page, but to highlight some of the achievements, the crowding things we want to talk about.

275
00:25:41,118 --> 00:25:44,160
This graph has been shared around

276
00:25:45,456 --> 00:25:51,760
In a couple of different color iterations, but, you know, same pricing, same figures that are represented here.

277
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,442
So this has been super powerful.

278
00:25:54,462 --> 00:25:58,505
What I've been interacting with people is just putting it into these numbers here.

279
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,328
But, you know, we just break it down.

280
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:07,111
This is the total funds that we committed last year, how many applications we reviewed.

281
00:26:07,131 --> 00:26:11,854
So just to kind of give folks an idea of, you know,

282
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,383
in summary of our actions of last year.

283
00:26:16,403 --> 00:26:19,546
So all the various factors.

284
00:26:19,566 --> 00:26:25,031
I tried really hard to make those shades of blue the same, and I don't know why it wouldn't make them the same.

285
00:26:25,591 --> 00:26:30,236
I'm usually the word whisperer and can make you do anything I want, but not that.

286
00:26:30,436 --> 00:26:31,777
Wasn't that Excel?

287
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:33,039
Or was that Word?

288
00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:33,819
It's Word.

289
00:26:33,939 --> 00:26:34,560
It's Word.

290
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,782
I never really like to play along together.

291
00:26:39,746 --> 00:26:45,671
So did a recap of our total revenue that CPA as a program has generated over the years.

292
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:51,375
So the blue here represent the state match.

293
00:26:51,535 --> 00:26:57,760
So for the folks, I think there's a couple of us who weren't involved in last year's budgeting process.

294
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,701
We'll talk about that later.

295
00:27:01,093 --> 00:27:10,576
Overall, our budget comes largely from CPA, what we call surcharge, or just local revenue, tax revenue that's collected is represented here in this orange.

296
00:27:11,336 --> 00:27:14,837
The blue is what we get from the state match money.

297
00:27:15,277 --> 00:27:25,680
And most of what makes up the pot for that is they skim a little bit off the top of real estate transactions that happen at the registry of deeds.

298
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:37,035
So you're going to see, even if you look here from fiscal 23 to fiscal 24, the state match dropped down because people stopped buying houses.

299
00:27:37,915 --> 00:27:47,299
And actually, we got an email today with guidance from the coalition about what we should be anticipating for the state match percentage.

300
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:52,341
In some years, we've experienced a very nice healthy 30%, I think,

301
00:27:54,469 --> 00:27:57,590
40% was the max since we've been in it.

302
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:58,030
Yeah.

303
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:02,311
So they're anticipating this year that we should budget for 14.5%.

304
00:28:02,351 --> 00:28:06,712
Oh, which stings.

305
00:28:07,072 --> 00:28:08,812
Yeah.

306
00:28:09,212 --> 00:28:12,793
So just something that, again, we'll be talking about our budget.

307
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:16,534
That's an agenda item we're going to plan our next year's budget today.

308
00:28:17,214 --> 00:28:21,035
But I just wanted to kind of break down how the state match was

309
00:28:22,165 --> 00:28:22,705
broken out.

310
00:28:22,905 --> 00:28:23,686
Joe, do you have a question?

311
00:28:23,726 --> 00:28:24,846
I saw you unmuted yourself.

312
00:28:25,927 --> 00:28:28,027
Oh, I'm just typing in comments in the chat.

313
00:28:28,067 --> 00:28:29,668
You can go look at them later.

314
00:28:30,368 --> 00:28:32,449
Yeah, thank you.

315
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,831
So, yes.

316
00:28:36,171 --> 00:28:38,752
So again, local surcharge and then the state match money.

317
00:28:38,832 --> 00:28:48,856
The reasoning why, again, they're trending down is less folks are buying property plus the, they actually spelled it out really well.

318
00:28:48,916 --> 00:28:51,297
And forgive me, it's like a three hour old email.

319
00:28:51,928 --> 00:28:56,271
But it's just because nobody's buying homes anymore.

320
00:28:56,692 --> 00:29:05,358
And as well as there not being any budget surplus money that has also been diverted to the state match fund in years past.

321
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:08,801
Any questions on that?

322
00:29:10,202 --> 00:29:10,582
Anybody?

323
00:29:12,323 --> 00:29:18,168
So it sounds like about $300,000 less this year compared to last fall.

324
00:29:19,389 --> 00:29:19,989
We'll look at it.

325
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:22,335
I kind of have it.

326
00:29:22,436 --> 00:29:25,438
It's a healthy reduction.

327
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:25,978
Yeah.

328
00:29:26,818 --> 00:29:32,582
It is a healthy reduction, which I hate saying that because it stinks.

329
00:29:33,843 --> 00:29:35,484
Again, these are just kind of nice recaps.

330
00:29:35,624 --> 00:29:40,748
I encourage everybody to kind of go through, and if you want to be familiar with our financials, like over the years.

331
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,011
Here's a very large picture.

332
00:29:45,071 --> 00:29:46,191
I should probably scale it down.

333
00:29:47,525 --> 00:29:54,591
a Google map actually got it linked in, linking out, but it interacted Google map of all of our projects in Medford here.

334
00:29:54,611 --> 00:30:09,823
Um, I think we should be really celebrating the fact that we were as a, as a committee highlighted in a Boston Globe article about the good work that we're doing towards funding housing.

335
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:13,887
Um, if folks haven't read this article, highly recommend it.

336
00:30:13,907 --> 00:30:15,828
I think it came out like the day after Christmas.

337
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:16,629
So it was a nice little,

338
00:30:17,272 --> 00:30:18,033
holiday present.

339
00:30:20,094 --> 00:30:21,595
But yes.

340
00:30:23,717 --> 00:30:26,359
What else do we kind of want to do?

341
00:30:26,379 --> 00:30:28,460
So this, do we want to go ahead and look at budget yet?

342
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:33,484
We'll hold the budget and come back to it.

343
00:30:34,745 --> 00:30:40,529
So this part, portion of the plan really dives into the feedback that we're getting from the community.

344
00:30:40,569 --> 00:30:43,651
What do they want to be seeing CPA invested in?

345
00:30:46,354 --> 00:30:53,697
So we kind of break down like what exactly open space and recreation is in Medford and how we prioritize it.

346
00:30:54,338 --> 00:30:57,739
So just some kind of bullet points there.

347
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,760
This was actually really interesting.

348
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:09,525
Roberta asked me to kind of dive into how many park projects have we done since the last time that this plan was updated and how much of that was CPA funded.

349
00:31:11,397 --> 00:31:13,718
So it's really cool to kind of talk about.

350
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:17,361
Since 2020, the city has completed about 40 projects.

351
00:31:17,561 --> 00:31:18,761
I think we're at like 39.

352
00:31:19,142 --> 00:31:21,003
So that's why I said nearly 40 projects.

353
00:31:22,023 --> 00:31:24,845
And we actually have 27 in progress right now.

354
00:31:25,105 --> 00:31:33,851
Whether or not it's shovels in the ground or RFPs getting pushed out the door, we currently have 27 active projects going.

355
00:31:34,431 --> 00:31:37,633
For a city that's short on resources, that's astounding.

356
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:50,933
I really wish, I don't know if it's public facing, but there's this great spreadsheet that I can circulate internally here, where it breaks down all the completed projects since 2020, all the active projects.

357
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:53,213
And in the middle, it says the funding source.

358
00:31:53,734 --> 00:31:59,255
And only two or three of them have anything related to just operating budget.

359
00:31:59,315 --> 00:32:04,976
Everything else is ARPA, CDBG, grants, land and water grants that are out there.

360
00:32:05,016 --> 00:32:07,177
So it's kind of great to see how much we're hustling

361
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:12,383
not our standard pot of money to make these projects happen.

362
00:32:12,643 --> 00:32:21,530
But I also want to, among us, to learn because I don't think the city was doing anything close to that before CPA came on board.

363
00:32:21,711 --> 00:32:32,219
So we primed the pump, got the water flowing, and then all of a sudden CDBG money was getting poured into parks projects that hadn't been before.

364
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,420
So we got

365
00:32:35,343 --> 00:32:42,706
them to be doing this work on a scale that they had not previously been doing.

366
00:32:44,126 --> 00:32:45,167
That is a good thing, too.

367
00:32:45,607 --> 00:32:45,847
Yeah.

368
00:32:45,887 --> 00:32:48,368
Yeah.

369
00:32:48,748 --> 00:32:54,950
I kind of broke it down on a table here just so you can see the numbers of how much CPA is investing in these projects.

370
00:32:55,731 --> 00:32:59,612
So as we look at it, it's 40 completed projects since 2020.

371
00:32:59,652 --> 00:33:04,414
35% of those had CPA funding associated with them.

372
00:33:04,965 --> 00:33:10,290
Not that 35% of the total project cost worth was from CPA funding.

373
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:15,214
It's just a third of each project CPA was involved in, which I think is pretty astounding.

374
00:33:15,314 --> 00:33:17,636
One for every three, and we're there.

375
00:33:17,656 --> 00:33:27,704
As you look at active projects, that creates a little bit higher, almost we're almost at 50 active projects right now, which I think is pretty great.

376
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:45,689
Again, we kind of broke down the survey results at our last meeting, which I know was, again, the number of survey responses was a little disappointing, but the content that we really got back was really substantive.

377
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:49,690
So I did break it down in here a little bit.

378
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:58,172
The biggest things that really came out of those surveys and our conversations and tabling, it's such a stark shift from the last time this plan was updated in 2021.

379
00:33:59,702 --> 00:34:05,608
Because at that point, COVID was still new and we kind of, nobody had to pay rent.

380
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:10,172
It was just like there was a moratorium on rentals and mortgage payments.

381
00:34:10,232 --> 00:34:18,840
So housing in the freshness of 2021 wasn't as stark a need as it is today.

382
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,542
So as we're engaging with everybody,

383
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:25,403
Housing was the number one thing folks wanted to talk about, which I thought was interesting.

384
00:34:25,603 --> 00:34:35,509
Not having been here three years ago, it seemed like that did shift more from open space park projects a few years ago to now being, well, what are we going to do about housing?

385
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:50,039
So, you know, we obviously, we did, I'm actually going to skip kind of over this here.

386
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:54,830
work.

387
00:34:56,231 --> 00:34:58,312
So I think I want to finish my thought on me.

388
00:34:58,392 --> 00:34:59,792
Just one comment on the parks.

389
00:34:59,812 --> 00:35:02,313
First of all, that data is really important.

390
00:35:02,453 --> 00:35:14,739
I think people need to understand that because one of the fears that I think some of us had in year one, year two, was that this was just going to be a line item in the city budget, like just the CPA.

391
00:35:15,299 --> 00:35:18,520
And if it is spurring on a substantial amount, that's the intent.

392
00:35:19,121 --> 00:35:20,001
And that's happening.

393
00:35:20,021 --> 00:35:21,842
And I think that's an important thing too.

394
00:35:22,966 --> 00:35:25,528
I remember the very first grant we gave was like the city like $200,000.

395
00:35:26,569 --> 00:35:28,990
It kind of set a weird precedent.

396
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:36,396
And I feel like in the context of what we've done since then, it's just spurring more.

397
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,537
They're not relying on a crutch.

398
00:35:39,118 --> 00:35:40,239
They're doing more.

399
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:43,141
And this is a supplement, which is always the intent.

400
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:48,985
And that's something we need to communicate to people who, you know, everyone has different priorities.

401
00:35:49,185 --> 00:35:51,607
And just to know that it's not the city is actually doing

402
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:56,586
following through on the intent of the program, not relying on it as the only source.

403
00:35:56,867 --> 00:35:57,867
That's really important.

404
00:35:59,269 --> 00:36:07,796
I will say that I do deflect a lot of conversations where CPA has been asked to be the only source for other projects.

405
00:36:07,836 --> 00:36:09,037
Well, that's good.

406
00:36:09,077 --> 00:36:09,537
You're there.

407
00:36:09,597 --> 00:36:13,380
It's the first line of defense.

408
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,024
We're being recorded, but there are some things where I'm like, where did that even come from?

409
00:36:21,357 --> 00:36:22,177
So yes, thank you.

410
00:36:22,217 --> 00:36:23,458
That's good feedback.

411
00:36:23,478 --> 00:36:25,159
We'll keep that good behavior going.

412
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:34,242
Actually, I am going to touch on a little bit here as we look at historic preservation.

413
00:36:34,642 --> 00:36:42,805
In some of my conversations, obviously, I'm engaging with residents and more of the taxpayer stakeholders.

414
00:36:43,466 --> 00:36:49,068
But as I've been talking with our colleagues here in City Hall about what kind of projects are you starting to see come up,

415
00:36:49,619 --> 00:37:01,145
I will say that the Historical Commission has been incredibly tenacious with their seeking and receiving of grants to fund all kinds of various historical studies around the city.

416
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,786
So that's an interesting thing.

417
00:37:04,407 --> 00:37:05,887
They're probably going to have

418
00:37:08,027 --> 00:37:09,847
You're on the historical commission, that's right.

419
00:37:09,867 --> 00:37:14,029
Yeah, I think Ryan said he's got another one locked and loaded, waited for September.

420
00:37:14,049 --> 00:37:17,409
I forgot which neighborhood it was, but... There aren't many left.

421
00:37:17,629 --> 00:37:17,989
Okay.

422
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:21,190
You know, we've worked our way across the city in the last 10 years.

423
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:21,690
Very good.

424
00:37:22,151 --> 00:37:23,851
Thankful nights are there right now.

425
00:37:23,891 --> 00:37:26,272
Yes, yeah.

426
00:37:26,672 --> 00:37:28,972
Yeah, Ryan's always the next one queued up.

427
00:37:29,012 --> 00:37:30,433
Yeah, which I love.

428
00:37:30,733 --> 00:37:32,013
Keeps us busy.

429
00:37:33,173 --> 00:37:35,954
Just a comment there on the photo.

430
00:37:37,165 --> 00:37:41,829
I love the current work in progress photo on the previous page.

431
00:37:42,229 --> 00:37:47,293
So we should not have to grow photos in the report.

432
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:49,235
We've got lots more to show off.

433
00:37:49,415 --> 00:37:49,615
Yeah.

434
00:37:50,484 --> 00:37:55,705
I was trying, it was really hard for me to not update this necessarily with like very fresh 2024 things.

435
00:37:56,125 --> 00:37:58,066
I love fresh 2024 things.

436
00:37:58,146 --> 00:38:00,887
I was trying to get like fresh 2023 things in there, but okay.

437
00:38:01,287 --> 00:38:01,627
Thank you.

438
00:38:01,687 --> 00:38:02,267
Oh, I see.

439
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:02,767
Yeah.

440
00:38:02,967 --> 00:38:04,508
I guess I'll put it in next year.

441
00:38:05,608 --> 00:38:10,149
Actually, that was a point that I didn't make on the very first page, the cover page.

442
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:17,651
So a point of confusion, and I don't know if we always want to keep, like we can change precedent.

443
00:38:18,185 --> 00:38:25,531
So the first year when we updated it, we thought of the plan as looking backwards and called it the 2023.

444
00:38:25,691 --> 00:38:29,934
Like this would have been the 2023 report talking about what we did last year.

445
00:38:30,495 --> 00:38:31,755
I think that's confusing.

446
00:38:31,836 --> 00:38:35,939
And so I think I actually already changed the cover to 2024 plan.

447
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:43,384
So I think it makes sense to talk about this is our snapshot of who we are today and not who we were last year.

448
00:38:43,985 --> 00:38:44,205
Got it.

449
00:38:44,225 --> 00:38:46,567
All right, thank you.

450
00:38:50,846 --> 00:38:55,932
Can you get a new picture?

451
00:38:55,952 --> 00:38:56,413
I tried.

452
00:38:56,633 --> 00:39:02,080
I pulled over on the side of Fellsway to try to get a good picture.

453
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,764
Everybody should drive by Fellsway West.

454
00:39:05,925 --> 00:39:06,565
Check it out.

455
00:39:06,585 --> 00:39:08,648
I think they're almost ready for signing.

456
00:39:11,423 --> 00:39:22,767
So we definitely wanted to include as we're talking about affordable housing here that the creation and generation of the affordable housing trust, as well as some of the recent.

457
00:39:22,887 --> 00:39:24,607
Comments that have been directed at CPA.

458
00:39:27,604 --> 00:39:31,527
As most of you know, and if not, I'll just refresh everybody's memory.

459
00:39:32,048 --> 00:39:39,313
There have been some talks about potentially implementing some fees, real estate transfer fees.

460
00:39:40,874 --> 00:39:44,397
So there's been talk about potentially asking the state

461
00:39:45,118 --> 00:39:53,383
for to give the city the option to talk about fees.

462
00:39:53,423 --> 00:39:55,464
We're not anywhere close to implementing fees.

463
00:39:55,504 --> 00:40:00,286
We're just talking about asking the state for the permission to talk about it.

464
00:40:00,306 --> 00:40:14,254
A response to that has been to say, well, why don't we just get more CPA funds and use more of our CPA funds for affordable housing?

465
00:40:14,785 --> 00:40:36,892
which sounds like a very generous and progressive idea, but all of our entire CPA budget is hardly a drop in the bucket for the cost of affordable housing and all of those fantastic parks projects that we're contributing to that people all across the city benefit from all of our historic preservation projects.

466
00:40:37,327 --> 00:40:42,169
we wouldn't be able to do those things if we committed all of our money to affordable housing.

467
00:40:42,529 --> 00:41:03,617
So two things I think that I tried to articulate in a plan and I welcome everyone's feedback about whether it's been articulated well is that we wanna continue to maintain a balance between the three program areas

468
00:41:04,286 --> 00:41:30,751
that we would consider being a contributor to the Affordable Housing Trust, but that they need to look for additional sources of funding, and that we want to consider supporting a request, like a ballot initiative, to increase us to the 3% level of property tax surcharge rather than the 1.5% where we are right now.

469
00:41:32,906 --> 00:41:39,089
So the housing section of the plan tries to capture those ideas.

470
00:41:45,913 --> 00:41:48,374
Yes.

471
00:41:48,494 --> 00:41:59,459
So we wanted just to capture that conversations are happening right now, whether that becomes a ballot initiative.

472
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,581
You just scrolled off, and it looks like Jonah's trying to read it.

473
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:04,409
Sorry, Joe.

474
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:05,350
Here we go.

475
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:06,470
Good.

476
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:07,931
All right.

477
00:42:07,971 --> 00:42:08,491
Stop.

478
00:42:08,751 --> 00:42:12,552
I was reading the one that's in Dropbox, but I noticed it's different.

479
00:42:12,632 --> 00:42:17,174
So I just shut it, and now I'm reading this one.

480
00:42:18,014 --> 00:42:20,655
Yeah, I went through and I made some formatting edits.

481
00:42:20,895 --> 00:42:21,175
OK.

482
00:42:21,415 --> 00:42:21,775
OK.

483
00:42:22,495 --> 00:42:28,737
I agree that the balance, that diagram with the three almost equal pieces of the pie tells the whole story.

484
00:42:29,537 --> 00:42:30,858
And I agree that's really important.

485
00:42:34,467 --> 00:43:01,887
Yeah, and I think, so part of what we've tried to do in the three program area sections is to talk about also, in addition to what public input have we heard, what planning has gone on in the city in the last few years related to each of the three program areas, which also gathered public input and articulates goals for the city, so we can all be on the same page about what our goals are.

486
00:43:04,017 --> 00:43:13,666
also trying to highlight the impact of CPA spending up till now in these three program areas.

487
00:43:13,686 --> 00:43:28,499
So all of that is meant to especially have an answer to these conversations that are going on about the CPA program and provide some documentation about why we take the position that we take

488
00:43:30,532 --> 00:43:33,953
Why do we want to balance the funding between the three program areas?

489
00:43:34,033 --> 00:43:39,834
Because the things that we're doing in the other two program areas are also really important.

490
00:43:42,475 --> 00:43:43,875
I want to be able to tell that story.

491
00:43:46,596 --> 00:43:50,537
So who would drive this initiative?

492
00:43:51,417 --> 00:43:55,118
We drove it as a ballot initiative when, you know,

493
00:43:56,368 --> 00:44:07,356
We started this, but would the city be driving this initiative or would it be a combination of us and interested people plus the city?

494
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:10,239
I feel like the story has to be told.

495
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:13,101
It's almost like campaigning all over again for it.

496
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:18,184
What else could we do if we were to increase our portion?

497
00:44:18,224 --> 00:44:22,488
Again, what gets affected with regards to the exemptions and stuff?

498
00:44:22,508 --> 00:44:25,550
Do the exemptions change based on the percentage that we

499
00:44:27,578 --> 00:44:28,358
opt for?

500
00:44:28,438 --> 00:44:29,279
I just don't remember.

501
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:31,599
That's a really good question.

502
00:44:31,739 --> 00:44:35,360
I mean, with respect to the exemptions, the same exemptions would apply.

503
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:45,362
What would change is that we would be in a pool of communities that receives a larger state match.

504
00:44:45,862 --> 00:44:48,823
So right now we're getting the 14.5%.

505
00:44:49,523 --> 00:44:52,024
They would give us some amount above 14.5%.

506
00:44:54,826 --> 00:44:56,791
if we were in the 3% pool.

507
00:44:57,172 --> 00:45:01,002
But to answer your other question, who would drive it?

508
00:45:02,121 --> 00:45:11,267
I, we've started Teresa and I have started just like whispering to people to find out, you know, like take their temperature.

509
00:45:11,287 --> 00:45:12,768
How would you feel about this?

510
00:45:12,828 --> 00:45:21,154
So, um, ideally it would come through the elected officials rather than having to be a signature campaign.

511
00:45:21,214 --> 00:45:25,597
I think that right now our elected officials probably would support it.

512
00:45:26,317 --> 00:45:27,598
So, um, we, but,

513
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:39,137
they would support it if we work with them to strategically choose a time to do it and a way to put it on the table.

514
00:45:39,577 --> 00:45:46,183
So Teresa and I are going to talk with Stuart Savignore to get his take on what needs to happen.

515
00:45:46,203 --> 00:45:59,674
And then we're going to quietly talk to the city councilors and the mayor about whether they would support it and when and kind of how they would like to go about it.

516
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:11,041
I don't know if they want to do it right away if it competes with an override campaign, for example, or maybe it would strategically help an override campaign.

517
00:46:11,081 --> 00:46:11,481
I don't know.

518
00:46:11,541 --> 00:46:17,767
I want to give them the chance to have that discussion about that before we try to go around them.

519
00:46:20,737 --> 00:46:31,947
So that's what I'm thinking, but I just tried to plant the seed in here because I think people will bring it up as an excuse to not do something else.

520
00:46:33,349 --> 00:46:42,537
And I want to make sure that we have the reasons on the table that we're doing what we're doing.

521
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:54,032
Yeah, I was just gonna say, I think this does a really good job, like educating people about the really small amount of CPA money.

522
00:46:54,272 --> 00:46:55,652
Like you said, it's a drop in the bucket.

523
00:46:56,353 --> 00:47:00,534
And then I even think that language of like, you know, we could do a surcharge of 3%.

524
00:47:00,754 --> 00:47:05,695
You know, the people that are really against the transfer tax, like they're gonna see that and they're gonna be like, well, I don't want that either, you know?

525
00:47:05,715 --> 00:47:12,097
So it's sort of like a education piece here of like, you can't use this as an excuse, you know?

526
00:47:12,417 --> 00:47:15,358
But like, if you do, then this is what's gonna happen kind of thing.

527
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:17,780
I think you did a really good job with it.

528
00:47:18,741 --> 00:47:27,189
And I think this is where the conversation really has to lie with just educating everybody to be like, you can't use the term CPA and CPC and not understand.

529
00:47:28,109 --> 00:47:29,150
It's really not that much money.

530
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:32,033
So I think you did a great job.

531
00:47:32,053 --> 00:47:33,314
Thank you.

532
00:47:33,334 --> 00:47:34,055
I agree.

533
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:45,541
Ironically, one of the people who was the most staunch opponents to CPA when we passed it was Bob Penta.

534
00:47:47,321 --> 00:48:02,105
And I saw him at a city council meeting recently stand up and say, we should be using CPA to support affordable housing, and we should be increasing the CPA surcharge so that we can put all that additional money into affordable housing.

535
00:48:05,078 --> 00:48:06,639
I'm going to take him for his word.

536
00:48:06,779 --> 00:48:11,583
I am going to quote him on that and say Bob Penta said so.

537
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,464
He gets the first lawn sign.

538
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:14,185
How about that?

539
00:48:14,205 --> 00:48:21,491
And that's the other half of this point that he was trying to vanquish.

540
00:48:25,687 --> 00:48:32,791
Well, I think what it says is, you know, the thing that people are anxious about the unknown.

541
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:45,417
And when we were first, you know, putting this forth, they didn't really know how this was gonna affect their day-to-day lives, both from the additional property tax that they may pay and the benefits that the city would see.

542
00:48:45,817 --> 00:48:50,520
But now we have five years under the belt of what this would do.

543
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:54,562
And so I honestly think it might actually be an easier task

544
00:48:55,122 --> 00:48:59,604
to increase it than was to get it passed in the first place.

545
00:49:00,905 --> 00:49:01,365
Absolutely.

546
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:02,786
It's proven now.

547
00:49:02,946 --> 00:49:14,052
I think a compelling number as I'm interacting with folks, and obviously I've had conversations with people who are not supporters of CPA for whatever reason.

548
00:49:15,573 --> 00:49:21,336
Whenever I bring it back down to the average single family homeowner in fiscal year 24 will pay $86.

549
00:49:23,968 --> 00:49:27,631
in tax for CPA, that tends to bring it back down there.

550
00:49:27,651 --> 00:49:30,594
To your point, Joan, folks don't know the unknown.

551
00:49:30,654 --> 00:49:35,938
But whenever you can put a number on it, then most people are like, oh, I pay less than $100 a year?

552
00:49:36,018 --> 00:49:37,179
OK, that's great.

553
00:49:37,339 --> 00:49:41,763
OK.

554
00:49:42,804 --> 00:49:45,586
So I don't think there's anything else.

555
00:49:45,866 --> 00:49:48,489
We already talked about the public engagement.

556
00:49:49,405 --> 00:49:53,228
Oh, maybe is there a our own goals after?

557
00:49:53,488 --> 00:50:03,516
So this page that's on the screen right now is essentially a summary of what we developed our very first plan, and we've never changed these goals and priorities.

558
00:50:03,956 --> 00:50:12,123
We put them up every now and then for discussion, but I don't think our minds have changed about what those goals and priorities are.

559
00:50:12,623 --> 00:50:14,164
So we can skip past that.

560
00:50:14,305 --> 00:50:16,346
It does fit on one page if we use.

561
00:50:19,101 --> 00:50:23,083
Yeah, we format it just right.

562
00:50:23,464 --> 00:50:30,528
But the procedures, that's just as much as the public needs to know about our procedures.

563
00:50:30,948 --> 00:50:34,890
So this is the 2021 timeline.

564
00:50:34,911 --> 00:50:36,371
Yeah.

565
00:50:36,391 --> 00:50:38,533
And anything else that we have in the plan?

566
00:50:38,553 --> 00:50:41,434
Do we have a goals for ourselves?

567
00:50:41,454 --> 00:50:43,015
I think so.

568
00:50:43,155 --> 00:50:43,496
Oh, yeah.

569
00:50:43,576 --> 00:50:43,776
Okay.

570
00:50:48,935 --> 00:50:53,698
That concludes our overview of the plan.

571
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:58,061
Are there any other comments?

572
00:50:58,241 --> 00:51:04,604
Again, if you want to go back and read it and send Teresa comments this week, that would be great.

573
00:51:04,744 --> 00:51:07,846
End of the week or just let's put a date on it?

574
00:51:08,767 --> 00:51:10,147
End of day Friday.

575
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:12,629
I can tinker with it over the weekend.

576
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:13,169
Okay.

577
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:16,931
Can you put the most up-to-date version in the Dropbox?

578
00:51:17,552 --> 00:51:18,012
I will.

579
00:51:18,777 --> 00:51:21,498
Thank you.

580
00:51:22,058 --> 00:51:22,739
I apologize.

581
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:29,842
I had meant to get it in there before the meeting started, but I had a painter show up at my house at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.

582
00:51:29,862 --> 00:51:33,983
Oh, yay.

583
00:51:34,003 --> 00:51:35,824
I think so.

584
00:51:36,084 --> 00:51:40,266
So sorry if everybody's like getting their eyeballs or estimated availability.

585
00:51:40,486 --> 00:51:40,766
Okay.

586
00:51:44,788 --> 00:51:45,528
So, we.

587
00:51:48,492 --> 00:51:57,539
We need to adopt our annual budget that we're going to appropriate for each of the program areas.

588
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:17,774
In most years, we have used the minimum annual like disbursement or allocation schedule that the state gives us, which is a minimum of 10% in each of the three program areas.

589
00:52:18,341 --> 00:52:27,708
a maximum of 5% in the administrative budget, and the general reserve is what's left over.

590
00:52:27,828 --> 00:52:31,751
That's the flexible funding that we could spend on any program area.

591
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:45,082
So we have, in some years, given an extra amount to affordable housing, anticipating that affordable housing projects

592
00:52:46,136 --> 00:52:50,340
are less frequent and a larger ask each year.

593
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:54,343
So we wanted to bank extra funds toward affordable housing.

594
00:52:55,104 --> 00:53:10,137
So I think there was one or two years when we put 20% in the affordable housing category and 10% in each of the other two categories.

595
00:53:10,157 --> 00:53:11,538
So this is an

596
00:53:12,277 --> 00:53:14,537
Some communities do things differently.

597
00:53:14,577 --> 00:53:25,199
Some communities put a larger amount of their funding into the program area reserves and much less is the general reserve.

598
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:38,362
So I wanted to open this for discussion among our committee, what we would like to, where we'd like to allocate our funds this year.

599
00:53:39,338 --> 00:53:41,539
And I would like just to jump in just really quick.

600
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:47,881
These numbers that are over here, that's what I'm estimating based off of the state match.

601
00:53:48,781 --> 00:53:52,782
So the budget number here is pretty, pretty solid.

602
00:53:52,822 --> 00:53:54,283
I think it's like 1.986.

603
00:53:54,683 --> 00:53:58,364
I have it on another spreadsheet.

604
00:53:58,524 --> 00:54:07,146
And that's based off of surcharge revenue that's collected, as well as, again, the state match of 14.5%.

605
00:54:10,672 --> 00:54:16,556
Kind of bummer news, but all right.

606
00:54:17,237 --> 00:54:20,419
I like generally the idea of maximum flexibility.

607
00:54:20,479 --> 00:54:28,625
The only caveat there is as we see the affordable housing trust come into being, I don't know if this is going.

608
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:39,622
This may not make sense this year, but I couldn't see for future years if we commit, say, 15% of our affordable housing directly to them that that should be in this annual disbursement.

609
00:54:39,762 --> 00:54:42,803
But since we don't have that agreement at this point, it may not.

610
00:54:43,263 --> 00:54:47,063
It probably is not appropriate for this year, but just thinking out loud.

611
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:55,045
Are you suggesting 15% just to the affordable housing trust and no other allocation?

612
00:54:55,065 --> 00:54:56,085
I just want to clarify.

613
00:54:57,149 --> 00:55:09,795
Uh, that was not a specific number intentionally, but we have discussed in the past as that 1 of the things we are considering as a way of supporting them is to allocate part of our.

614
00:55:09,815 --> 00:55:15,918
Agreement and we decided we are not doing that for now that we are kind of still going project by project.

615
00:55:16,759 --> 00:55:25,203
Um, it was a, if we get to a point where even going project by project, perhaps we say this is something that we're prioritizing.

616
00:55:26,676 --> 00:55:28,558
This could make sense, but we're not there.

617
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:33,602
Which is to say, I like the flexibility.

618
00:55:33,802 --> 00:55:36,584
I think this is good.

619
00:55:36,664 --> 00:55:39,086
Also, I just saw Joan's shirt and it's incredible.

620
00:55:39,106 --> 00:55:42,048
Do you like that?

621
00:55:42,228 --> 00:55:43,289
Amazing.

622
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:44,851
It's really old.

623
00:55:44,871 --> 00:55:46,612
I got it in Davis Square.

624
00:55:46,652 --> 00:55:48,794
It says, Somerville, the gateway to Midford.

625
00:55:54,483 --> 00:55:55,684
That's a collector's item.

626
00:55:56,084 --> 00:56:11,349
It is a collector's item.

627
00:56:12,129 --> 00:56:14,230
I'm sorry, go ahead.

628
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:19,792
I was just wondering, have we gotten many applications in yet?

629
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,922
We haven't opened the annual funding round for this year yet.

630
00:56:24,962 --> 00:56:26,844
That will open up later this summer.

631
00:56:27,284 --> 00:56:31,567
We just have these small little off-cycle or small grant applications come through.

632
00:56:32,708 --> 00:56:44,136
So, I mean, the distribution of the budget would probably be more reliant on how many applications we got in each category, wouldn't it?

633
00:56:46,478 --> 00:56:49,440
If we maximize flexibility, yes.

634
00:56:50,565 --> 00:56:56,189
So the state requires us to put a minimum of 10% toward each category.

635
00:56:56,209 --> 00:57:12,199
And if we leave 65% in the general reserve, as is shown on this table right now, then we can put that toward any funding category, whatever applications we receive.

636
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:16,482
So traditionally, we would

637
00:57:17,515 --> 00:57:21,036
Traditionally, we've used it a little bit more for open space.

638
00:57:22,597 --> 00:57:31,160
Then I think that the pie chart showed that historic preservation was second and then affordable housing was third.

639
00:57:33,821 --> 00:57:44,905
I can't flip it up and down, but if that trend continues, I mean, I know there's an awful lot of scuttlebutt about affordable housing, but

640
00:57:45,699 --> 00:58:01,765
Considering the amount of money that we actually have to offer out, I don't see why we would increase any one of the budgets as far as our estimates are concerned.

641
00:58:01,805 --> 00:58:09,567
I would think that we'd leave them right where they are and then figure out what we're going to get in as far as applications are concerned.

642
00:58:17,345 --> 00:58:25,548
So I think I'm hearing from a couple of you that we lean toward maximizing our flexibility.

643
00:58:26,548 --> 00:58:42,833
And in past years, we felt that it would be important to at least start affordable housing off with a handicap because often we don't get applications in affordable housing and we want to make sure that we

644
00:58:44,353 --> 00:58:55,002
set aside enough money so that an application next year will have enough money to give it because it comes less frequently in bigger amounts.

645
00:58:57,284 --> 00:59:08,193
So, you know, I don't want to lean too hard seeing how important the work has been that we've done in the other program areas.

646
00:59:10,751 --> 00:59:16,134
And we may have an affordable housing trust that will apply for funding this year.

647
00:59:16,434 --> 00:59:17,414
It's to be determined.

648
00:59:17,434 --> 00:59:18,935
It hasn't been appointed yet.

649
00:59:19,115 --> 00:59:32,142
So I don't think that there are any affordable housing projects in the pipeline that I'm aware of that are going to apply for funds this year.

650
00:59:32,162 --> 00:59:33,903
No, not that I'm aware of.

651
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:37,741
Yeah, I'm not sure.

652
00:59:37,761 --> 00:59:40,364
I'm not sure what the is planning on this year.

653
00:59:40,384 --> 00:59:49,593
I mean, I was just thinking, just because of the climate in the city, you know, just all the conversation and talking points are pushing affordable housing.

654
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:56,900
That, you know, if we did increase that percentage, it sort of shows that, like, we're listening, you know, we're, we're doing what, you know.

655
00:59:57,638 --> 01:00:01,840
people are asking for, you know, even if it was just 15% or just a small increment.

656
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:11,344
I mean, I personally agree with Reg, you know, the pot of money is small, like, you know, 10% seems fair, and then the general reserve is there for anything else.

657
01:00:12,305 --> 01:00:18,888
I'm just wondering if like, you know, just for appearances, you know, if we, if it was increased, you know, that that would bode well with the public.

658
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:25,411
I tend to agree with that position too.

659
01:00:28,193 --> 01:00:42,289
But this is non-binding essentially, I mean, can we get applications, can we not change our minds about, so we're locked in here?

660
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:48,877
When we put it into the bucket, we're locked, that money's locked into that channel, so.

661
01:00:52,742 --> 01:00:55,683
In that case, I think I'm going to change my vote slightly too.

662
01:00:55,783 --> 01:00:59,604
I do like the idea of increasing affordable housing a little bit.

663
01:00:59,784 --> 01:01:09,948
I mean, at these numbers, it is symbolic, but that is the current discussion, but moving it to 15% instead of 10, we are locked in.

664
01:01:10,388 --> 01:01:11,488
It's not that much money.

665
01:01:11,508 --> 01:01:16,070
I've been convinced in that direction.

666
01:01:20,878 --> 01:01:34,505
So the suggestion is that it should be 10% open space, 15% affordable housing, 10% historic preservation, and 60% general reserve.

667
01:01:35,986 --> 01:01:36,406
Agreed.

668
01:01:38,568 --> 01:01:39,668
Seems a good consensus.

669
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:44,330
That looks right.

670
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,132
I see what you're saying.

671
01:01:59,561 --> 01:02:01,562
have to do that later.

672
01:02:01,662 --> 01:02:02,022
I will.

673
01:02:02,062 --> 01:02:05,464
Yeah, I promise that I'll be right, folks.

674
01:02:05,564 --> 01:02:06,724
I'll go right now.

675
01:02:07,785 --> 01:02:14,288
Well, you're going to use the actual budget and not the rounded budget anyway.

676
01:02:14,328 --> 01:02:14,568
Correct.

677
01:02:15,446 --> 01:02:35,057
So okay, so based on the annual displacement percentage that we see on the screen rather than the actual dollar numbers, is there a motion to approve this budget for the CBC for FY25?

678
01:02:35,077 --> 01:02:39,119
I'll make the motion.

679
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:43,321
I couldn't see who that was.

680
01:02:43,842 --> 01:02:44,322
It's Kayleen.

681
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:45,980
Kaylene, thank you.

682
01:02:49,642 --> 01:02:51,442
And... I'll second that.

683
01:02:52,023 --> 01:02:52,563
Oh, go ahead.

684
01:02:53,403 --> 01:02:54,283
I heard Doug first.

685
01:02:54,984 --> 01:02:55,784
Here we go.

686
01:02:57,205 --> 01:02:58,345
And I will call the roll.

687
01:02:58,745 --> 01:02:59,125
Joan?

688
01:03:00,686 --> 01:03:01,026
Yes.

689
01:03:01,946 --> 01:03:02,326
Ari?

690
01:03:03,227 --> 01:03:03,527
Yes.

691
01:03:04,367 --> 01:03:04,687
Doug?

692
01:03:04,967 --> 01:03:05,228
Yes.

693
01:03:05,808 --> 01:03:06,388
Kaylene?

694
01:03:08,009 --> 01:03:08,229
Yes.

695
01:03:09,549 --> 01:03:09,909
Reg?

696
01:03:10,549 --> 01:03:10,830
No.

697
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:13,851
And myself, yes.

698
01:03:17,027 --> 01:03:24,892
So the motion passes, but I just want to come back and read this, Reg, your reasoning for voting no.

699
01:03:27,133 --> 01:03:31,816
I don't believe that we needed to address the discrepancy.

700
01:03:31,916 --> 01:03:41,142
If we've been given equal parts to each one of the categories, open space, affordable housing, and historic preservation,

701
01:03:43,306 --> 01:03:50,753
I just don't feel the need to increase the budget for affordable housing until we find out what we get as far.

702
01:03:50,793 --> 01:03:56,257
Well, I know that we can't do it afterwards now, but I just don't feel there's a need for that.

703
01:03:56,417 --> 01:03:57,498
But that's just my opinion.

704
01:03:57,638 --> 01:03:57,999
That's all.

705
01:03:59,400 --> 01:03:59,720
Thank you.

706
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:04,844
I just wanted to have your position in the open.

707
01:04:04,884 --> 01:04:05,625
So thank you.

708
01:04:06,305 --> 01:04:11,550
I would suggest crown down when there are numbers, when there are cents.

709
01:04:16,568 --> 01:04:18,289
I got in trouble once for rounding up.

710
01:04:18,649 --> 01:04:19,929
That's a very bad thing.

711
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:22,731
All right.

712
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:29,913
The only other thing that we have regarding the annual plan review is application materials.

713
01:04:31,574 --> 01:04:36,336
Do you want to do quickly take us through the application materials?

714
01:04:37,216 --> 01:04:42,818
So I don't know if I don't think any of the many members currently have experience

715
01:04:44,905 --> 01:04:54,968
using our application in the current format.

716
01:04:54,988 --> 01:05:05,411
So we'll walk through what it looks like and try to... So everybody should be seeing CPA application.

717
01:05:07,391 --> 01:05:10,312
This is a Smartsheet form, it's done online.

718
01:05:11,377 --> 01:05:15,498
We do accept paid for applications, although we really, really don't want to.

719
01:05:16,138 --> 01:05:18,159
But so we always direct folks to here.

720
01:05:18,179 --> 01:05:20,659
Start with just the basics.

721
01:05:21,259 --> 01:05:22,800
I'll just skim through it really quickly.

722
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:28,641
I don't wanna bore us here, but applicant information.

723
01:05:29,181 --> 01:05:33,382
So the, actually, I think I might still have one.

724
01:05:34,662 --> 01:05:37,383
What we want to think about is from our perspective,

725
01:05:38,001 --> 01:05:48,948
We want to make sure that we're getting the information that we need to help us make a decision, answer our own questions about the projects.

726
01:05:48,968 --> 01:05:58,393
So project narrative, this is where folks can write an essay basically on what it is that they're trying to accomplish here rather than it being bullet points and just budget sheets.

727
01:05:58,434 --> 01:06:04,077
This is actually the story of what they're doing and why they're doing it.

728
01:06:27,954 --> 01:06:29,935
I'm going too fast or too slow.

729
01:06:35,779 --> 01:06:44,405
So again, in this project section, we're really trying to get into the nuts and bolts of exactly what it is and how it aligns with the CPA goals.

730
01:06:44,885 --> 01:06:48,107
Let me take a quick look at that CPA budget summary for me.

731
01:06:48,268 --> 01:06:49,168
Yeah, I hate this one.

732
01:06:49,608 --> 01:06:50,529
I want to change it.

733
01:06:50,549 --> 01:06:52,050
Yeah, we should probably change it.

734
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:53,351
Oh, something went wrong.

735
01:06:55,878 --> 01:07:01,020
Okay, well, we're going to change it anyway because we need to come up with a better budget.

736
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:12,764
We've actually, we saw an example of it tonight while we were looking at the Trees Medford application, which I think this is the decision I had mocked up.

737
01:07:12,784 --> 01:07:22,047
Dropbox, it's not the Dropbox.

738
01:07:22,867 --> 01:07:23,327
Sorry folks.

739
01:07:25,734 --> 01:07:26,734
Too many tabs open.

740
01:07:27,234 --> 01:07:51,739
It's a very basic spreadsheet that asks folks to identify all of their various funding sources.

741
01:07:53,118 --> 01:07:55,700
and line item budget for their project.

742
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:00,844
I think it's a little clunky right now in that it's not very intuitive.

743
01:08:01,124 --> 01:08:10,810
Folks just will usually put, oh, my project budget is $150,000 rather than, you know, this aspect is 50, I have this much of contingency and what have you.

744
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:13,892
So I think there's some room for improving that.

745
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:16,334
Yeah, so let's take a look at that.

746
01:08:17,608 --> 01:08:24,816
Have you gotten feedback in the past about how easy it is or saving the middle?

747
01:08:25,357 --> 01:08:27,399
Yes, that's pretty much the number one.

748
01:08:30,433 --> 01:08:35,155
complaints about our application process is that you cannot save it as you're going.

749
01:08:35,595 --> 01:08:43,839
I do have a little disclaimer here about what I have since doing this last year's application cycle.

750
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:50,782
I've created a template for folks to use that as they're writing their grant and then they can copy paste.

751
01:08:50,862 --> 01:08:55,504
It's still a little clunky, but it's at least the same exact questions in an editable form.

752
01:08:56,673 --> 01:09:05,786
My, my thought we were talking about this earlier is instead of just putting a nice little disclaimer here actually linking to that template that folks can access right then and there.

753
01:09:05,806 --> 01:09:06,647
That's a good idea.

754
01:09:07,528 --> 01:09:09,872
Yeah, that actually that solves the problem.

755
01:09:10,553 --> 01:09:10,693
Yeah.

756
01:09:24,054 --> 01:09:27,457
I don't have an example of the packet from the trees thing.

757
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:31,260
So we can't see what the result is in a condensed form.

758
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:31,980
Right.

759
01:09:32,721 --> 01:09:37,805
I can pull up that application if it's helpful to close it out.

760
01:09:40,067 --> 01:09:41,949
Are you seeing the need to change anything else?

761
01:09:44,791 --> 01:09:48,133
This was updated last year.

762
01:09:48,954 --> 01:09:53,338
So I'm more comfortable with this now than what we had in the past.

763
01:09:55,151 --> 01:10:00,574
myself, but it's always worth taking a look at it.

764
01:10:00,594 --> 01:10:05,598
I think that this is, for me, this section here, why is project needed?

765
01:10:05,638 --> 01:10:11,002
Like, I think we have too many questions kind of stacked up in there, so it doesn't really pass my eyeball test.

766
01:10:11,402 --> 01:10:15,685
Maybe if we broke it out in a little bit, like, why is this project needed?

767
01:10:15,745 --> 01:10:20,709
And then maybe bullet point, like, think about how the project serves the public, what populations it will serve.

768
01:10:20,989 --> 01:10:21,850
Can you send a link to

769
01:10:22,564 --> 01:10:25,446
what you think are successful grant applications that would be good templates.

770
01:10:26,127 --> 01:10:26,667
I can do that.

771
01:10:26,687 --> 01:10:36,875
I mean, that would be what I would be looking for is something when I'm competing against and what you're looking for, you know, for maybe a couple, you know, one in open space, one in.

772
01:10:37,295 --> 01:10:38,556
Yeah, that's a good idea.

773
01:10:38,696 --> 01:10:42,899
Just that's always easier to say, here's a good one.

774
01:10:43,219 --> 01:10:51,245
And honestly, I'm doing that right now with some people as they're getting prepared for either next year's funding cycle or if they're doing off-cycle, I'm like, here's a good one, copy that one.

775
01:10:52,763 --> 01:11:01,868
So we want to make sure that we have this ready to go with a month before the first due date is.

776
01:11:02,148 --> 01:11:07,851
So that's the limit on how much time we can spend tinkering.

777
01:11:08,792 --> 01:11:17,317
I think overall, the feedback as I'm talking with applicants, nobody said like, oh my gosh, your questions are so wordy or it's too long.

778
01:11:18,511 --> 01:11:23,356
really was just kind of, it's inconvenient for me to walk away and come back to it half an hour later.

779
01:11:24,097 --> 01:11:28,302
Nobody really seemed to have issues with the substance of our questions.

780
01:11:29,683 --> 01:11:33,747
And honestly, we've all, it's more or less written grants at some point.

781
01:11:34,128 --> 01:11:37,752
This isn't that bad as far as some grant applications go.

782
01:11:38,063 --> 01:11:48,011
The reason why there are so many questions stacked in front of one box is so that they don't feel like they have to answer each of those questions individually.

783
01:11:48,251 --> 01:11:52,815
And so it's trying to reduce the amount of writing they have to do.

784
01:11:54,096 --> 01:11:57,598
But it might be possible to simplify it.

785
01:11:57,618 --> 01:11:57,939
Yeah.

786
01:12:09,878 --> 01:12:10,919
I mean, this is pretty standard.

787
01:12:11,019 --> 01:12:16,602
I mean, I, you know, I looked at it and I compared it to Lexington's, which I've had to do like myself many times.

788
01:12:16,722 --> 01:12:19,864
I don't think it's any more onerous than theirs.

789
01:12:19,945 --> 01:12:22,766
So there's even online.

790
01:12:23,067 --> 01:12:27,990
So I think this is I think this is fine.

791
01:12:28,270 --> 01:12:28,870
I don't think it's worthy.

792
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:30,371
Okay.

793
01:12:31,752 --> 01:12:32,372
Thanks, Kelly.

794
01:12:36,495 --> 01:12:36,935
Okay, then.

795
01:12:37,176 --> 01:12:39,277
So why don't I tinker with

796
01:12:39,677 --> 01:12:46,918
you know, updating it for 2024 dates, putting in that template, embedding it in here.

797
01:12:46,938 --> 01:12:54,160
I might just kind of tinker with some of the formatting of the questions, but keep it there.

798
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:58,580
But otherwise, it doesn't really sound like we need to overhaul this.

799
01:12:59,040 --> 01:12:59,320
Okay.

800
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:00,581
No, I don't think so.

801
01:13:00,661 --> 01:13:00,881
Okay.

802
01:13:01,781 --> 01:13:03,221
I'll go ahead and stop sharing.

803
01:13:03,261 --> 01:13:08,082
Again, there was a link to the application materials in the Dropbox if folks wanted to

804
01:13:09,123 --> 01:13:11,144
look directly at it themselves as well.

805
01:13:14,725 --> 01:13:15,065
Awesome.

806
01:13:15,205 --> 01:13:16,325
Thank you, everybody.

807
01:13:16,345 --> 01:13:19,026
Appreciate the feedback on that.

808
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:26,088
So that concludes our update of the annual plan and our budget and everything.

809
01:13:26,108 --> 01:13:29,609
That's all our business for this month.

810
01:13:29,929 --> 01:13:37,932
So is there anything else that we wanted to, anyone wanted to bring up for the group?

811
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:43,552
Bye-bye.

812
01:13:43,572 --> 01:13:44,173
Membership.

813
01:13:44,433 --> 01:13:46,594
So I know we have a couple of vacancies.

814
01:13:47,614 --> 01:13:50,656
What's the update on the search?

815
01:13:51,336 --> 01:13:53,557
We interviewed one candidate.

816
01:13:53,837 --> 01:13:55,138
I've been trying to nail down.

817
01:13:55,178 --> 01:13:57,279
Thank you, Ari, for nudging me about Ada.

818
01:13:57,319 --> 01:14:00,080
I've been trying to get in touch with Ada.

819
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:01,501
I'll reach back out again.

820
01:14:01,521 --> 01:14:06,143
I don't have incorrect contact information, so I'm not.

821
01:14:07,505 --> 01:14:15,290
Yeah, and we did take a very long time to respond because we have been trying to get more applicants in.

822
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:26,157
So that's really been the hang up is having only one person at a time who we're in conversation with.

823
01:14:27,218 --> 01:14:33,182
We really wanted to have the opportunity to open up the membership to a wider

824
01:14:35,893 --> 01:14:39,655
more diverse group of folks.

825
01:14:40,036 --> 01:14:49,961
Yeah, it's unfortunate that we need folks at the same time that the CD board I think needs a person as well as they're obviously staffing the affordable housing trust.

826
01:14:50,582 --> 01:14:58,486
So there were a couple of really great candidates that I thought could have brought their expertise over but they're kind of being earmarked.

827
01:14:59,287 --> 01:15:04,270
I didn't think to follow up with you about the mayor's suggestion when I ran into her last week.

828
01:15:04,748 --> 01:15:07,790
I reached out to a couple of folks that were on a list.

829
01:15:07,810 --> 01:15:16,994
There was another list that the mayor pointed us towards and one person declined and the other person I haven't heard back from yet, but I did reach out to them last week.

830
01:15:17,735 --> 01:15:24,218
So things that we've got pokers in the fire, so hopefully we'll be able to appoint a couple of folks here soon.

831
01:15:25,258 --> 01:15:26,479
Thank you for bringing that up, Joan.

832
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:28,560
How many vacancies are there?

833
01:15:29,381 --> 01:15:29,641
Two.

834
01:15:30,041 --> 01:15:30,281
Two.

835
01:15:32,202 --> 01:15:33,803
And they're both the at-large

836
01:15:35,638 --> 01:15:38,419
There's technically four at-large appointments.

837
01:15:39,019 --> 01:15:39,879
These are two of those.

838
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:46,781
Teresa, do you need Ada's email to double-check you have the right one or anything?

839
01:15:47,241 --> 01:15:47,501
Yeah.

840
01:15:47,621 --> 01:15:50,782
If you can send that to me, that would be great.

841
01:15:51,442 --> 01:15:54,863
We were very eager to connect and it just hasn't happened, so I appreciate that.

842
01:15:57,764 --> 01:16:01,605
Anything else?

843
01:16:02,957 --> 01:16:05,839
I think that is everything that we needed to cover today.

844
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:07,120
I'll tease this out.

845
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:12,743
Just maybe next month, we should probably start thinking about when our social outing is.

846
01:16:13,243 --> 01:16:23,470
So if you all just wanted to start thinking about some ideas so we can all hang out outside of Zoom and Room 201.

847
01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:26,632
So maybe come up with some ideas next month.

848
01:16:26,652 --> 01:16:27,412
That'd be great.

849
01:16:29,854 --> 01:16:32,155
Otherwise, I don't think I had anything else.

850
01:16:32,622 --> 01:16:35,343
I have a question that's somewhat related to that.

851
01:16:35,963 --> 01:16:39,024
Do we know what's going into the vault space?

852
01:16:41,064 --> 01:16:41,624
We don't.

853
01:16:42,384 --> 01:16:47,526
I know it's another restaurant, but we're unaware.

854
01:16:47,946 --> 01:16:54,727
My boss, Alicia Hunt, she's been having conversations, but we don't know who the actual restaurant that is going in.

855
01:16:54,767 --> 01:16:57,308
We just know that it will remain a restaurant.

856
01:16:59,743 --> 01:17:04,807
And do we know when the Irish pub is supposed to open two doors down from the Cuba?

857
01:17:05,868 --> 01:17:11,292
Oh, I know that that... You see my theme here, Doug.

858
01:17:11,532 --> 01:17:12,412
You see my theme.

859
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:16,135
It sounds like it's a pub crawl.

860
01:17:16,315 --> 01:17:17,416
Yeah.

861
01:17:19,738 --> 01:17:21,579
Yeah.

862
01:17:21,799 --> 01:17:24,061
I will find out about the Irish pub.

863
01:17:24,101 --> 01:17:25,302
I know that they're...

864
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:27,550
the owner has been working out.

865
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:33,995
So it's in the middle of its build out, but I'm not sure exactly where in the progress.

866
01:17:34,035 --> 01:17:38,779
But yes, it's coming.

867
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:40,140
Yeah.

868
01:17:40,501 --> 01:17:42,763
And how about the Great American Beer Hall?

869
01:17:42,843 --> 01:17:47,086
Let's just take it all the way back to that.

870
01:17:47,507 --> 01:17:50,849
I do have knowledge about where that stands.

871
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:51,150
Yes.

872
01:17:51,430 --> 01:17:51,890
Yes, I do.

873
01:17:52,977 --> 01:17:54,478
That's good to know.

874
01:17:54,778 --> 01:17:57,539
Second question, will it be open this fall?

875
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:02,761
We are all very hopeful that it will be open in the fall, yes.

876
01:18:04,461 --> 01:18:07,862
That's all I have to say about that.

877
01:18:07,882 --> 01:18:11,043
Yeah, you can text me, Joan.

878
01:18:11,063 --> 01:18:11,744
That's all right.

879
01:18:12,244 --> 01:18:17,326
And did you share the good news with Roberta about the presumed?

880
01:18:18,066 --> 01:18:19,807
Why don't you do it, Joan?

881
01:18:22,623 --> 01:18:26,224
I got the Preserve Medford site back up.

882
01:18:26,484 --> 01:18:29,625
Apparently, there was a version history that they were able to restore.

883
01:18:29,665 --> 01:18:30,725
We keep backups.

884
01:18:31,025 --> 01:18:35,766
I talked to Hadley and I was like, thoughts, ideas?

885
01:18:36,106 --> 01:18:42,388
She said, talk to your host and see if they have a backup they can load.

886
01:18:42,848 --> 01:18:45,208
Basically, wipe the whole site out and restore backup.

887
01:18:45,948 --> 01:18:48,249
We restored the backup from January 8th.

888
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:52,371
which was far back enough to bring it back online, so.

889
01:18:52,611 --> 01:18:52,771
Yeah.

890
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:53,691
Oh, good, good.

891
01:18:54,231 --> 01:18:57,072
Yeah, I forgot that was, was that Friday?

892
01:18:57,092 --> 01:19:01,433
I think so, I don't know.

893
01:19:01,453 --> 01:19:03,634
We still have it available.

894
01:19:04,254 --> 01:19:15,137
Yes, so I know that there was some discussion about moving most of the information onto the city's website, but having the ability to post our own information if we wanted to in a more timely manner, so.

895
01:19:15,737 --> 01:19:16,018
Right.

896
01:19:16,058 --> 01:19:16,538
Yeah, right.

897
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:19,271
Oh, I don't know if everybody saw.

898
01:19:19,771 --> 01:19:23,173
I shared from preserve Medford's Facebook page.

899
01:19:23,474 --> 01:19:26,616
The updates of what's the restoration at World War One Memorial.

900
01:19:27,256 --> 01:19:32,339
Oh yeah, I shared it into the Facebook group and it was so nice seeing such positive comments come back.

901
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:39,504
Everybody is super supportive of the program, so if anybody does want to go check it out, the statue itself is is complete.

902
01:19:40,164 --> 01:19:42,986
Now they're working on the Plaza, which is much more work to do.

903
01:19:43,006 --> 01:19:46,128
But if you want to go check it out, it looks brand new.

904
01:19:46,208 --> 01:19:47,389
I don't know how the heck they did it,

905
01:19:48,332 --> 01:19:52,395
the edges of the limestone look sharper and everything just looks super crisp.

906
01:19:52,556 --> 01:19:54,537
So I recommend it.

907
01:19:54,657 --> 01:20:00,002
Remember that guy that showed up with his sandblaster and he was ready to go in to clean that thing up?

908
01:20:00,723 --> 01:20:03,045
Yeah, I was a little worried, Joan, about that one.

909
01:20:03,065 --> 01:20:06,608
I know, I was like... Anytime's instruction.

910
01:20:06,628 --> 01:20:07,568
Anytime.

911
01:20:07,749 --> 01:20:07,969
Sure.

912
01:20:08,189 --> 01:20:09,690
We do a good job.

913
01:20:17,017 --> 01:20:17,257
I don't know.

914
01:20:17,317 --> 01:20:17,698
I don't know.

915
01:20:17,718 --> 01:20:17,998
I don't know.

916
01:20:18,018 --> 01:20:18,258
I don't know.

917
01:20:18,278 --> 01:20:18,538
I don't know.

918
01:20:18,558 --> 01:20:18,878
I don't know.

919
01:20:18,919 --> 01:20:19,479
I don't know.

920
01:20:19,499 --> 01:20:20,019
I don't know.

921
01:20:20,039 --> 01:20:20,720
I don't know.

922
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:21,100
I don't know.

923
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:21,521
I don't know.

924
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:21,861
I don't know.

925
01:20:21,881 --> 01:20:22,161
I don't know.

926
01:20:22,181 --> 01:20:22,421
I don't know.

927
01:20:22,441 --> 01:20:22,822
I don't know.

928
01:20:22,842 --> 01:20:23,102
I don't know.

929
01:20:23,122 --> 01:20:23,482
I don't know.

930
01:20:23,502 --> 01:20:23,802
I don't know.

931
01:20:23,822 --> 01:20:24,083
I don't know.

932
01:20:24,103 --> 01:20:24,383
I don't know.

933
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:24,683
I don't know.

934
01:20:24,703 --> 01:20:24,943
I don't know.

935
01:20:24,963 --> 01:20:25,223
I don't know.

936
01:20:25,824 --> 01:20:26,164
I don't know.

937
01:20:26,184 --> 01:20:26,525
I don't know.

938
01:20:26,545 --> 01:20:26,985
I don't know.

939
01:20:27,005 --> 01:20:27,445
I don't know.

940
01:20:27,465 --> 01:20:27,745
I don't know.

941
01:20:27,846 --> 01:20:30,708
I don't know.

942
01:20:30,728 --> 01:20:31,088
I don't know.

943
01:20:31,108 --> 01:20:32,589
I don't know.

944
01:20:32,609 --> 01:20:33,030
I don't know.

945
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:33,510
I don't know.

946
01:20:33,530 --> 01:20:33,870
I don't know.

947
01:20:33,910 --> 01:20:34,851
I don't know.

948
01:20:34,871 --> 01:20:35,812
I don't know.

949
01:20:35,832 --> 01:20:36,953
I don't know.

950
01:20:37,013 --> 01:20:38,494
I don't know.

951
01:20:38,554 --> 01:20:39,215
I don't know.

952
01:20:39,235 --> 01:20:40,476
I don't know.

953
01:20:40,496 --> 01:20:41,737
I don't know.

954
01:20:41,757 --> 01:20:42,717
I don't know.

955
01:20:42,737 --> 01:20:43,918
I don't know.

956
01:20:43,938 --> 01:20:44,238
I don't know.

957
01:20:44,258 --> 01:20:44,639
I don't know

958
01:20:46,955 --> 01:20:48,216
All right, I'll see you in a month.

959
01:20:48,356 --> 01:20:48,836
Myself, yes.

960
01:20:48,876 --> 01:20:49,776
That was great.

961
01:20:49,897 --> 01:20:50,337
All right.

962
01:20:50,357 --> 01:20:51,317
Good night, everybody.

963
01:20:51,357 --> 01:20:52,578
Thanks, everybody.

964
