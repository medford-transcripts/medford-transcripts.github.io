1
00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:08,753
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to call to order the meeting of Medford's Community Preservation Committee on Tuesday, May 14th, 2024, 6.30 p.m.

2
00:00:08,773 --> 00:00:16,474
[SPEAKER_04]: We are meeting hybrid, both in room 201 at Medford City Hall and via Zoom.

3
00:00:17,074 --> 00:00:25,016
[SPEAKER_04]: So the meeting being held in hybrid to view and participate in the meeting, you can be in either location.

4
00:00:25,798 --> 00:00:36,902
[SPEAKER_04]: or call in by phone, all of the information is provided in our agenda and we'll post the meeting as soon as possible, a recording of the meeting on the city's website afterward.

5
00:00:38,403 --> 00:00:44,505
[SPEAKER_04]: So first on the agenda is to review the minutes from March 12th and April 9th.

6
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:50,968
[SPEAKER_01]: And those were in the meeting packets that was submitted last week.

7
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:52,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want me to pull it up on screen or?

8
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:53,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

9
00:00:57,635 --> 00:01:00,857
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Kayleen.

10
00:01:00,937 --> 00:01:02,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining us, Kayleen.

11
00:01:02,919 --> 00:01:08,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably can't hear me quite yet.

12
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:10,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I couldn't get the link to work.

13
00:01:10,524 --> 00:01:11,544
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to manually put it in.

14
00:01:11,564 --> 00:01:13,606
[SPEAKER_01]: No worries.

15
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:16,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad you're here.

16
00:01:16,808 --> 00:01:20,650
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to bring a mouse with me next time.

17
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:22,832
[SPEAKER_01]: Trackpad is not working.

18
00:01:24,053 --> 00:01:24,373
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

19
00:01:24,823 --> 00:01:27,664
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go ahead and share my screen.

20
00:01:32,585 --> 00:01:34,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Zoom needs to stop changing things up on me.

21
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:40,267
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we have, and you guys in the room are not seeing it because I need to drag it over.

22
00:01:40,287 --> 00:01:42,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Is everybody still seeing meeting minutes?

23
00:01:42,148 --> 00:01:42,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

24
00:01:43,128 --> 00:01:43,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.

25
00:01:43,648 --> 00:01:48,069
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for the March 12th.

26
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:51,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm seeing a stained glass window.

27
00:01:53,261 --> 00:01:54,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I was seeing the meeting minutes.

28
00:01:55,903 --> 00:02:01,687
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay, you can leave.

29
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

30
00:02:10,153 --> 00:02:10,693
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

31
00:02:11,454 --> 00:02:12,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

32
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:15,917
[SPEAKER_01]: So this had a correction.

33
00:02:15,937 --> 00:02:18,719
[SPEAKER_01]: I accidentally kept Joan in attendance.

34
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Joan is not there.

35
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,462
[SPEAKER_01]: So that has been corrected here.

36
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:36,216
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is just to accept the meeting minutes that we accepted them, not that we approved them, just that we received them, right?

37
00:02:36,897 --> 00:02:38,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

38
00:02:39,098 --> 00:02:44,143
[SPEAKER_05]: So I see both of the 312 and 49 meeting minutes in the drop box.

39
00:02:45,043 --> 00:02:49,647
[SPEAKER_05]: So motion to accept the meeting minutes from 312 and 49.

40
00:02:49,747 --> 00:02:49,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

41
00:02:56,853 --> 00:02:59,334
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

42
00:02:59,574 --> 00:03:00,955
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will call the roll.

43
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:02,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Doug?

44
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:02,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

45
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:03,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Kaylene?

46
00:03:04,896 --> 00:03:05,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

47
00:03:07,277 --> 00:03:07,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Joan?

48
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:08,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

49
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:10,298
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ari?

50
00:03:11,178 --> 00:03:11,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

51
00:03:12,218 --> 00:03:13,198
[SPEAKER_04]: And myself, yes.

52
00:03:14,339 --> 00:03:15,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Meeting minutes are accepted.

53
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,441
[SPEAKER_04]: So next on the agenda is small grant application from Trees Medford.

54
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:33,472
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would like to, if you could bring the application up on the screen, and I would invite Amanda and Sarah to tell us about your application.

55
00:03:33,492 --> 00:03:36,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you hear me?

56
00:03:38,113 --> 00:03:39,234
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

57
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:41,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thank you.

58
00:03:42,698 --> 00:03:45,462
[SPEAKER_10]: We got a big grant from DCR.

59
00:03:45,882 --> 00:03:52,329
[SPEAKER_10]: As you know, you guys already helped us with funding and inventory of the cemetery trees, and that was a few years ago.

60
00:03:54,652 --> 00:04:11,814
[SPEAKER_10]: We got a grant from DCR and a private grant put together to fund an inventory of all the city trees, and we got an estimate from Davie Tree, which turned out to be a bit low, so they got going on the inventory this summer.

61
00:04:12,715 --> 00:04:20,104
[SPEAKER_10]: this winter, spring, and found that they used up the money before they finished.

62
00:04:20,264 --> 00:04:21,725
[SPEAKER_10]: So we decided to do two things.

63
00:04:21,906 --> 00:04:27,672
[SPEAKER_10]: One is to separate out the parks and do the parks separately.

64
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:35,197
[SPEAKER_10]: And the other is to go back to DCR for additional funds to finish.

65
00:04:35,698 --> 00:04:39,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, West Medford is the part of the inventory that has not been completed.

66
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,182
[SPEAKER_10]: And because you all because of the open space part of the CPC.

67
00:04:46,825 --> 00:05:03,957
[SPEAKER_10]: mandate and we thought this was a good use it really will be great to to keep track of all those trees and we we anticipate we're already as we get these inventories making sure that they're loaded into the

68
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:31,070
[SPEAKER_10]: City GIS system, we have an agreement that we've put in place with the DPW to commit to over the next year or so to establishing a means for using this data, maintaining this data, and updating this data so that it doesn't become obsolete

69
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,551
[SPEAKER_10]: that we've put good money toward it.

70
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,492
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the basic idea.

71
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:43,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

72
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:46,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything to add?

73
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:50,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Questions from the committee?

74
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:57,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say it's at the end of the tree inventory.

75
00:06:00,369 --> 00:06:01,291
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not the end.

76
00:06:02,673 --> 00:06:09,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, well, we, we still have to go back to DCR for the West Medford segment, but everything else in the city is done.

77
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:13,972
[SPEAKER_08]: So, what is the.

78
00:06:15,104 --> 00:06:17,366
[SPEAKER_08]: total project cost, including DCR, because the request is for $5,000.

79
00:06:17,406 --> 00:06:17,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

80
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:21,929
[SPEAKER_08]: We're estimating that the park trees are 1,000 trees, and this is how much 1,000 trees would cost.

81
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,231
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we are going to contribute the $500 to get us up to the right amount.

82
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:47,867
[SPEAKER_10]: The total cost, we spent $25,000 on the city street tree inventory.

83
00:06:48,588 --> 00:06:58,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Most recently, we did another project where we did just South Medford a few years ago, and that, if I remember right, was $5,000.

84
00:06:59,454 --> 00:07:01,315
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's right.

85
00:07:03,732 --> 00:07:10,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's just that you're actually asking for a much lower percentage of the actual total cost of all trees.

86
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:15,274
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more like you're asking like 15% non.

87
00:07:15,294 --> 00:07:22,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, no, we can redo the budget if that makes more sense, but we just broke it out as a separate project kind of.

88
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, I just wanted to know the context, thank you.

89
00:07:24,996 --> 00:07:29,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this is very helpful.

90
00:07:32,628 --> 00:07:34,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Other questions from committee members?

91
00:07:40,617 --> 00:07:48,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a question, but will the results of this study inform the Medford Square master plan?

92
00:07:51,120 --> 00:08:03,175
[SPEAKER_06]: It will go into the vulnerability analysis that is currently underway and that will inform the other plan.

93
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:25,382
[SPEAKER_10]: The consultants who are working on the vulnerability assessment are definitely excited about this data to be used for the larger, assuming the city gets the grant, for the larger urban forestry master plan.

94
00:08:26,202 --> 00:08:28,284
[SPEAKER_10]: This will inform that heavily.

95
00:08:28,304 --> 00:08:35,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question that is maybe not related because

96
00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:46,540
[SPEAKER_04]: So just out of curiosity, I wonder if you know anything about the trees in the McDonald Park, and is that included in this study?

97
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:48,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's a DCR park.

98
00:08:48,902 --> 00:08:50,342
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I thought, yeah.

99
00:08:50,522 --> 00:09:00,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and we know they need to do lots of work because Sarah and I went over a year ago and observed all the dead ashes in McDonald Park, and it was really sad.

100
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,688
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's work to be done over there.

101
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:11,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we we asked Davey tree why the initial estimates were so far off.

102
00:09:11,486 --> 00:09:20,512
[SPEAKER_06]: And they said and they say, well, I said, well, you've done this for other communities.

103
00:09:20,612 --> 00:09:23,854
[SPEAKER_06]: How come Medford's were so far off?

104
00:09:23,894 --> 00:09:27,336
[SPEAKER_06]: And they said, well, the other communities already had

105
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,241
[SPEAKER_06]: inventories and Medford doesn't.

106
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:36,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Or not so much that they already had inventories, but they had a pretty good ballpark idea of how many trees they had.

107
00:09:36,904 --> 00:09:39,765
[SPEAKER_10]: And in our case, we were a little bit flying blind.

108
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:40,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

109
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:43,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Not surprising.

110
00:09:45,548 --> 00:09:53,392
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is really a first, a first tranche of data for the city for this information.

111
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:56,513
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really important that

112
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:07,103
[SPEAKER_06]: that the city be able to manage its forest resources, which are very valuable appropriately.

113
00:10:09,603 --> 00:10:15,925
[SPEAKER_04]: And who will be maintaining this inventory after it's completed?

114
00:10:17,686 --> 00:10:20,807
[SPEAKER_10]: We've worked a little bit with, I can do it.

115
00:10:20,827 --> 00:10:21,847
[SPEAKER_10]: With Tim.

116
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:31,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we've talked to Tim and Tim has signed the agreement about management of data, but we have worked a little bit with.

117
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:52,515
[SPEAKER_10]: He has loaded the data we've generated so far into the inventory, and he's also been working with Aggie to create lists of new trees that have been planted that he's mapping and stuff like that.

118
00:10:53,355 --> 00:11:00,878
[SPEAKER_10]: But he's pretty heavily committed, so they're going to have to figure out a way to get a little more GIS savvy.

119
00:11:01,798 --> 00:11:03,078
[SPEAKER_10]: into City Hall somehow.

120
00:11:03,258 --> 00:11:09,400
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what we're looking forward to hearing how they're going to do it.

121
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:22,502
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the stipulations before we sent them a bunch of money from various grants was that this be maintained, that they maintain the data.

122
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:25,783
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have an MOU to that effect.

123
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:36,899
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if there's some opportunity for partnership with the planning department.

124
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:42,025
[SPEAKER_01]: We tend to get several interns that last throughout.

125
00:11:42,045 --> 00:11:45,429
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll commit to a whole year and they all have GIS experience.

126
00:11:45,489 --> 00:11:47,572
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in the past they've helped before.

127
00:11:47,952 --> 00:11:48,312
[SPEAKER_10]: They have.

128
00:11:48,613 --> 00:11:52,918
[SPEAKER_10]: There was one guy in particular who worked very closely with Aggie and did some wonderful mapping.

129
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,921
[SPEAKER_10]: of new trees plantings over a number over 10 year period.

130
00:11:57,401 --> 00:12:08,229
[SPEAKER_10]: And those files, I think it was you who figured out that those files still exist on a computer somewhere.

131
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:10,450
[SPEAKER_10]: So we look forward to, yeah.

132
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,392
[SPEAKER_10]: And an intern can totally do what needs doing.

133
00:12:13,492 --> 00:12:16,495
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just that their workflow needs to be set up.

134
00:12:17,255 --> 00:12:17,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

135
00:12:19,617 --> 00:12:19,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

136
00:12:23,057 --> 00:12:24,637
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be a solution.

137
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further discussion?

138
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:38,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Would anyone like to make a motion to recommend the funding of $5,000 for the Park Street?

139
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:40,081
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

140
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:41,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to back up.

141
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:52,204
[SPEAKER_04]: I had talked about this with Teresa earlier today, and now a suggestion that I wanted to put on the table for the committee's consideration.

142
00:12:53,206 --> 00:13:20,658
[SPEAKER_04]: is whether a tree inventory for the parks is more appropriate to fund out of our project budget, or if this is something that we should consider funding out of our administrative budget, because the administrative budget is intended to help provide the committee with information that we need

143
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:24,620
[SPEAKER_04]: to be able to administer this grant program.

144
00:13:25,081 --> 00:13:40,211
[SPEAKER_04]: The information in this case being the condition of the trees in our parks, which will help to establish whether, you know, what the priorities are for tree planting in the city.

145
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:49,437
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it could fit either way in our programmatic budget or in our administrative budget, and I wanted to see

146
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,881
[SPEAKER_04]: what your thoughts are, Joan.

147
00:13:53,742 --> 00:14:02,728
[SPEAKER_05]: My first thought is how is this different from every other study that we have funded through the regular funding?

148
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:13,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Design for any kind of improvement is really part of the process of making that improvement.

149
00:14:15,002 --> 00:14:23,248
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did previously fund the Oak Grove Cemetery tree inventory out of our programmatic budget.

150
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:35,116
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think we really considered the question about whether that could be an administrative project rather than a programmatic project at the time.

151
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:50,351
[SPEAKER_04]: But comparable, we have talked about studying, for example, just doing an inventory of accessibility needs across playgrounds, which is comparable to an inventory, to a tree inventory across the parks.

152
00:14:51,272 --> 00:15:00,159
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that might have been done as an administrative project rather than a programmatic project.

153
00:15:06,228 --> 00:15:11,369
[SPEAKER_09]: What have we been spending our administrative budget on for, say, the last 2 years?

154
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:14,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I feel like I understand what we spend our program budget on.

155
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:17,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, is the answer Teresa?

156
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:26,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Teresa and our various subscriptions and dues that we pay for, but does this effectively stretch our budget?

157
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:32,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, more we have more funds fund if we're using a little admin in the middle of grants.

158
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:46,528
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to shake out probably the same either way because any administrative funds that are not spent in that fiscal year roll over into our program funds for the future.

159
00:15:47,308 --> 00:15:54,175
[SPEAKER_04]: So either way, this will come out of our program budget.

160
00:15:57,674 --> 00:16:00,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I don't think it really impacts our budget.

161
00:16:00,578 --> 00:16:12,471
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really more about setting a precedent for the kinds of projects that we will consider for programs versus administrative.

162
00:16:14,957 --> 00:16:39,647
[SPEAKER_05]: So I always thought that the administrative budget was really for the administration of the CPA, you know, law and the ordinance and the administrative support of the process of, you know, CPA versus administration related to any particular one grant or one, you know, submission.

163
00:16:42,722 --> 00:16:57,073
[SPEAKER_04]: An example that was given to us back in the beginning was that it could also be used for due diligence in case of projects where more information is needed before we were ready to.

164
00:16:57,774 --> 00:16:58,294
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

165
00:16:58,374 --> 00:17:11,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Doug, what do you think?

166
00:17:14,832 --> 00:17:19,415
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds like it's, it's something we haven't done just because we haven't really thought of it.

167
00:17:19,475 --> 00:17:25,438
[SPEAKER_08]: And obviously I don't think we're stretching the boundaries here too much of the guardrails for either.

168
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,239
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm okay with doing it.

169
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:32,722
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also not a lot of money in that two points or almost $3 million.

170
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:34,584
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems like we have to play with here.

171
00:17:35,844 --> 00:17:42,208
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't think we'll be doing this for a million dollars, you know, hundreds of thousand dollar grants, most likely smaller stuff.

172
00:17:42,268 --> 00:17:42,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

173
00:17:43,068 --> 00:17:43,609
[SPEAKER_08]: No, because it's,

174
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,530
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a scale thing.

175
00:17:47,811 --> 00:17:57,715
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing to consider is, so one significant difference is that if we fund it out of the administrative budget, it does not go through city council.

176
00:17:59,035 --> 00:18:02,736
[SPEAKER_04]: If we fund it out of... Wow, that's... I want to see the reactions.

177
00:18:02,756 --> 00:18:03,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, oh my God.

178
00:18:14,737 --> 00:18:28,703
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at our discretion how we spend the administrative budget, but the programmatic budget goes through City Council.

179
00:18:29,364 --> 00:18:33,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I get the due diligence piece.

180
00:18:33,966 --> 00:18:40,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wonder if, and I'm trying to think back to when we met with the CP coalition,

181
00:18:42,653 --> 00:18:54,656
[SPEAKER_05]: If that due diligence was really geared toward an application that we had already decided should be funded, but more information was needed.

182
00:18:55,656 --> 00:19:04,178
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was an add-on that we would do the due diligence for versus this is straight up the application.

183
00:19:04,198 --> 00:19:05,058
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

184
00:19:08,567 --> 00:19:18,053
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really feel comfortable, given what you just said, also reminding me that spending out of the administrative budget doesn't go through the city council.

185
00:19:18,113 --> 00:19:19,794
[SPEAKER_05]: This really should.

186
00:19:19,814 --> 00:19:21,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

187
00:19:22,376 --> 00:19:25,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's a tangible part of spending, yeah.

188
00:19:25,758 --> 00:19:26,539
[SPEAKER_08]: I see that point.

189
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:31,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I appreciate that input.

190
00:19:32,303 --> 00:19:33,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Transparency.

191
00:19:33,123 --> 00:19:33,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

192
00:19:34,164 --> 00:19:34,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

193
00:19:35,265 --> 00:19:35,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it.

194
00:19:37,096 --> 00:19:37,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you.

195
00:19:37,696 --> 00:19:43,220
[SPEAKER_04]: That's helpful that we can tease it out.

196
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:55,128
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that, I would ask if there is a motion to recommend the funding from our, I don't know if we have to specify.

197
00:19:55,148 --> 00:19:56,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have a question, Sarah?

198
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:02,894
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can continue, I have a question for after you've done that.

199
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:12,113
[SPEAKER_04]: So do we have the funds in the general fund budget or is it in an open space reserve right now?

200
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:13,753
[SPEAKER_01]: And do we need to specify?

201
00:20:13,773 --> 00:20:15,614
[SPEAKER_01]: We have enough to cover this.

202
00:20:16,274 --> 00:20:17,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we need to specify?

203
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:20,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, when it comes time for the mayor's recommendation.

204
00:20:20,555 --> 00:20:22,436
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this point, we don't have to specify.

205
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:28,298
[SPEAKER_04]: So looking for a motion for a recommendation to fund $5,000 for the parks tree inventory.

206
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,881
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll make that motion.

207
00:20:37,482 --> 00:20:38,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll second.

208
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,484
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

209
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:44,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I will call the roll.

210
00:20:45,588 --> 00:20:45,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Joan?

211
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:46,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

212
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:48,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Ari?

213
00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:49,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

214
00:20:50,932 --> 00:20:51,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Doug?

215
00:20:51,693 --> 00:20:51,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

216
00:20:52,373 --> 00:20:52,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Kaylene?

217
00:20:53,734 --> 00:20:53,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

218
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:55,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Reg?

219
00:20:56,136 --> 00:20:56,436
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

220
00:20:57,417 --> 00:20:58,378
[SPEAKER_04]: And myself, yes.

221
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

222
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Regulation passes.

223
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,982
[SPEAKER_04]: We make the recommendation

224
00:21:04,672 --> 00:21:06,753
[SPEAKER_04]: And Sarah, did you have a question?

225
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:18,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I just wondered if you had any update about the status of the plan for funding the cemetery plan?

226
00:21:20,422 --> 00:21:24,684
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that one, I plan to resurrect.

227
00:21:24,845 --> 00:21:26,686
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate your patience with that one.

228
00:21:26,806 --> 00:21:28,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Just this spring has kind of hit me hard.

229
00:21:29,627 --> 00:21:33,450
[SPEAKER_01]: My intention is to get another meeting going on that one in early June.

230
00:21:35,112 --> 00:21:36,893
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, that's still in the works.

231
00:21:38,094 --> 00:21:46,859
[SPEAKER_06]: And were you able to get approval for the entire cemetery, or is it still limited to the historic section?

232
00:21:48,420 --> 00:22:02,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so in terms of the legal opinion on if trees in the new section, if they would be as considered for passive recreation, we did get a legal opinion on that, and they did deem that it would be eligible.

233
00:22:03,226 --> 00:22:07,007
[SPEAKER_01]: have to go before City Council, but congratulations, and like I said, we'll be in touch.

234
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:37,614
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to make sure we add a note to that, not for the motion, but just to put the context of the other funds that are, have been brought back to us.

235
00:22:37,634 --> 00:22:41,854
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got some notes that are $30,000 elsewhere that others have spent.

236
00:22:41,874 --> 00:22:47,996
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is a, this is like 17 or 18% of the actual total global.

237
00:22:48,136 --> 00:22:49,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

238
00:22:49,216 --> 00:22:49,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Holistically.

239
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:50,356
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so.

240
00:22:50,376 --> 00:22:53,437
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it'll just help them understand that it's not just us.

241
00:22:53,637 --> 00:22:59,178
[SPEAKER_08]: These guys have done a great job finding money from many other sources, which most of our grants don't.

242
00:22:59,825 --> 00:23:00,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

243
00:23:00,525 --> 00:23:02,427
[SPEAKER_08]: They definitely hit the pavement.

244
00:23:02,687 --> 00:23:03,047
[SPEAKER_08]: They did.

245
00:23:03,427 --> 00:23:03,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

246
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:05,789
[SPEAKER_08]: They should be awarded or at least acknowledged for it.

247
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:07,750
[SPEAKER_01]: I will.

248
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:08,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

249
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:11,132
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

250
00:23:11,272 --> 00:23:13,093
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

251
00:23:15,114 --> 00:23:18,997
[SPEAKER_01]: If it gets a little loud, please let us know.

252
00:23:19,057 --> 00:23:24,620
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a city council transition right now, and there's a lot of noise coming from the hallway.

253
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,462
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it gets, if it picks up on the microphones, please let us know.

254
00:23:29,586 --> 00:23:36,932
[SPEAKER_04]: But otherwise, next on the agenda is the annual plan update.

255
00:23:37,552 --> 00:23:47,840
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we're going to begin we have a few steps of what we need to go over tonight, but we'll begin with just an overview of the whole plan update.

256
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,944
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's been how long since we had a plan update 2021.

257
00:23:53,244 --> 00:23:55,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so it's been a couple of years.

258
00:23:56,346 --> 00:23:57,447
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are.

259
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,042
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks good.

260
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:05,527
[SPEAKER_04]: I am going to share.

261
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:18,902
[SPEAKER_04]: So while you do that, the goal is for us to have this plan completed at the same time that we send to city council the motion for the small grant application and for our annual budget.

262
00:24:19,605 --> 00:24:23,766
[SPEAKER_04]: So this evening, we can talk about the whole thing.

263
00:24:23,786 --> 00:24:26,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully everyone has a chance to read it.

264
00:24:26,887 --> 00:24:33,429
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have any further comments, send them to Teresa this week so that we can wrap up the plan all together.

265
00:24:33,449 --> 00:24:34,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

266
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:39,190
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if folks had the opportunity to skim it.

267
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,151
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it is many pages.

268
00:24:41,171 --> 00:24:44,492
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand if you weren't able to fully digest it.

269
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:57,275
[SPEAKER_01]: largely what the plan, it just evaluates what we intend to do as a CPC, as a committee, by also taking in consideration feedback from the community.

270
00:24:57,435 --> 00:25:09,961
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's ultimately, in very, very layman's terms, the purpose of this annual plan is to inform the public on what we're seeing, what we're doing, and the reasoning behind it all.

271
00:25:11,341 --> 00:25:15,203
[SPEAKER_01]: So especially for the new folks, as a new folk, I found it very,

272
00:25:16,803 --> 00:25:22,967
[SPEAKER_01]: helpful to be writing this and it helps you digest exactly what it is that we do here.

273
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:30,532
[SPEAKER_01]: So I highly recommend for everybody to really read through it, but definitely the new folks.

274
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:40,418
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to go page by page, but to highlight some of the achievements, the crowding things we want to talk about.

275
00:25:41,118 --> 00:25:44,160
[SPEAKER_01]: This graph has been shared around

276
00:25:45,456 --> 00:25:51,760
[SPEAKER_01]: In a couple of different color iterations, but, you know, same pricing, same figures that are represented here.

277
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,442
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has been super powerful.

278
00:25:54,462 --> 00:25:58,505
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've been interacting with people is just putting it into these numbers here.

279
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,328
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, we just break it down.

280
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:07,111
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the total funds that we committed last year, how many applications we reviewed.

281
00:26:07,131 --> 00:26:11,854
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to kind of give folks an idea of, you know,

282
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,383
[SPEAKER_01]: in summary of our actions of last year.

283
00:26:16,403 --> 00:26:19,546
[SPEAKER_04]: So all the various factors.

284
00:26:19,566 --> 00:26:25,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried really hard to make those shades of blue the same, and I don't know why it wouldn't make them the same.

285
00:26:25,591 --> 00:26:30,236
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm usually the word whisperer and can make you do anything I want, but not that.

286
00:26:30,436 --> 00:26:31,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't that Excel?

287
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:33,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Or was that Word?

288
00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:33,819
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Word.

289
00:26:33,939 --> 00:26:34,560
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Word.

290
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,782
[SPEAKER_01]: I never really like to play along together.

291
00:26:39,746 --> 00:26:45,671
[SPEAKER_01]: So did a recap of our total revenue that CPA as a program has generated over the years.

292
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:51,375
[SPEAKER_01]: So the blue here represent the state match.

293
00:26:51,535 --> 00:26:57,760
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the folks, I think there's a couple of us who weren't involved in last year's budgeting process.

294
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,701
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that later.

295
00:27:01,093 --> 00:27:10,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Overall, our budget comes largely from CPA, what we call surcharge, or just local revenue, tax revenue that's collected is represented here in this orange.

296
00:27:11,336 --> 00:27:14,837
[SPEAKER_01]: The blue is what we get from the state match money.

297
00:27:15,277 --> 00:27:25,680
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of what makes up the pot for that is they skim a little bit off the top of real estate transactions that happen at the registry of deeds.

298
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:37,035
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to see, even if you look here from fiscal 23 to fiscal 24, the state match dropped down because people stopped buying houses.

299
00:27:37,915 --> 00:27:47,299
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, we got an email today with guidance from the coalition about what we should be anticipating for the state match percentage.

300
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:52,341
[SPEAKER_01]: In some years, we've experienced a very nice healthy 30%, I think,

301
00:27:54,469 --> 00:27:57,590
[SPEAKER_01]: 40% was the max since we've been in it.

302
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:58,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

303
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:02,311
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're anticipating this year that we should budget for 14.5%.

304
00:28:02,351 --> 00:28:06,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, which stings.

305
00:28:07,072 --> 00:28:08,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

306
00:28:09,212 --> 00:28:12,793
[SPEAKER_01]: So just something that, again, we'll be talking about our budget.

307
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:16,534
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an agenda item we're going to plan our next year's budget today.

308
00:28:17,214 --> 00:28:21,035
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just wanted to kind of break down how the state match was

309
00:28:22,165 --> 00:28:22,705
[SPEAKER_01]: broken out.

310
00:28:22,905 --> 00:28:23,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe, do you have a question?

311
00:28:23,726 --> 00:28:24,846
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw you unmuted yourself.

312
00:28:25,927 --> 00:28:28,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm just typing in comments in the chat.

313
00:28:28,067 --> 00:28:29,668
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go look at them later.

314
00:28:30,368 --> 00:28:32,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you.

315
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,831
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yes.

316
00:28:36,171 --> 00:28:38,752
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, local surcharge and then the state match money.

317
00:28:38,832 --> 00:28:48,856
[SPEAKER_01]: The reasoning why, again, they're trending down is less folks are buying property plus the, they actually spelled it out really well.

318
00:28:48,916 --> 00:28:51,297
[SPEAKER_01]: And forgive me, it's like a three hour old email.

319
00:28:51,928 --> 00:28:56,271
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just because nobody's buying homes anymore.

320
00:28:56,692 --> 00:29:05,358
[SPEAKER_01]: And as well as there not being any budget surplus money that has also been diverted to the state match fund in years past.

321
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:08,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions on that?

322
00:29:10,202 --> 00:29:10,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody?

323
00:29:12,323 --> 00:29:18,168
[SPEAKER_08]: So it sounds like about $300,000 less this year compared to last fall.

324
00:29:19,389 --> 00:29:19,989
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll look at it.

325
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:22,335
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of have it.

326
00:29:22,436 --> 00:29:25,438
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a healthy reduction.

327
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:25,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

328
00:29:26,818 --> 00:29:32,582
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a healthy reduction, which I hate saying that because it stinks.

329
00:29:33,843 --> 00:29:35,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, these are just kind of nice recaps.

330
00:29:35,624 --> 00:29:40,748
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage everybody to kind of go through, and if you want to be familiar with our financials, like over the years.

331
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a very large picture.

332
00:29:45,071 --> 00:29:46,191
[SPEAKER_01]: I should probably scale it down.

333
00:29:47,525 --> 00:29:54,591
[SPEAKER_01]: a Google map actually got it linked in, linking out, but it interacted Google map of all of our projects in Medford here.

334
00:29:54,611 --> 00:30:09,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think we should be really celebrating the fact that we were as a, as a committee highlighted in a Boston Globe article about the good work that we're doing towards funding housing.

335
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:13,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if folks haven't read this article, highly recommend it.

336
00:30:13,907 --> 00:30:15,828
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it came out like the day after Christmas.

337
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:16,629
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a nice little,

338
00:30:17,272 --> 00:30:18,033
[SPEAKER_01]: holiday present.

339
00:30:20,094 --> 00:30:21,595
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes.

340
00:30:23,717 --> 00:30:26,359
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do we kind of want to do?

341
00:30:26,379 --> 00:30:28,460
[SPEAKER_01]: So this, do we want to go ahead and look at budget yet?

342
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:33,484
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll hold the budget and come back to it.

343
00:30:34,745 --> 00:30:40,529
[SPEAKER_01]: So this part, portion of the plan really dives into the feedback that we're getting from the community.

344
00:30:40,569 --> 00:30:43,651
[SPEAKER_01]: What do they want to be seeing CPA invested in?

345
00:30:46,354 --> 00:30:53,697
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kind of break down like what exactly open space and recreation is in Medford and how we prioritize it.

346
00:30:54,338 --> 00:30:57,739
[SPEAKER_01]: So just some kind of bullet points there.

347
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,760
[SPEAKER_01]: This was actually really interesting.

348
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:09,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Roberta asked me to kind of dive into how many park projects have we done since the last time that this plan was updated and how much of that was CPA funded.

349
00:31:11,397 --> 00:31:13,718
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really cool to kind of talk about.

350
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:17,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Since 2020, the city has completed about 40 projects.

351
00:31:17,561 --> 00:31:18,761
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're at like 39.

352
00:31:19,142 --> 00:31:21,003
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I said nearly 40 projects.

353
00:31:22,023 --> 00:31:24,845
[SPEAKER_01]: And we actually have 27 in progress right now.

354
00:31:25,105 --> 00:31:33,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether or not it's shovels in the ground or RFPs getting pushed out the door, we currently have 27 active projects going.

355
00:31:34,431 --> 00:31:37,633
[SPEAKER_04]: For a city that's short on resources, that's astounding.

356
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:50,933
[SPEAKER_01]: I really wish, I don't know if it's public facing, but there's this great spreadsheet that I can circulate internally here, where it breaks down all the completed projects since 2020, all the active projects.

357
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:53,213
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the middle, it says the funding source.

358
00:31:53,734 --> 00:31:59,255
[SPEAKER_01]: And only two or three of them have anything related to just operating budget.

359
00:31:59,315 --> 00:32:04,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else is ARPA, CDBG, grants, land and water grants that are out there.

360
00:32:05,016 --> 00:32:07,177
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of great to see how much we're hustling

361
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:12,383
[SPEAKER_01]: not our standard pot of money to make these projects happen.

362
00:32:12,643 --> 00:32:21,530
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also want to, among us, to learn because I don't think the city was doing anything close to that before CPA came on board.

363
00:32:21,711 --> 00:32:32,219
[SPEAKER_04]: So we primed the pump, got the water flowing, and then all of a sudden CDBG money was getting poured into parks projects that hadn't been before.

364
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,420
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got

365
00:32:35,343 --> 00:32:42,706
[SPEAKER_04]: them to be doing this work on a scale that they had not previously been doing.

366
00:32:44,126 --> 00:32:45,167
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a good thing, too.

367
00:32:45,607 --> 00:32:45,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

368
00:32:45,887 --> 00:32:48,368
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

369
00:32:48,748 --> 00:32:54,950
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of broke it down on a table here just so you can see the numbers of how much CPA is investing in these projects.

370
00:32:55,731 --> 00:32:59,612
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we look at it, it's 40 completed projects since 2020.

371
00:32:59,652 --> 00:33:04,414
[SPEAKER_01]: 35% of those had CPA funding associated with them.

372
00:33:04,965 --> 00:33:10,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that 35% of the total project cost worth was from CPA funding.

373
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:15,214
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a third of each project CPA was involved in, which I think is pretty astounding.

374
00:33:15,314 --> 00:33:17,636
[SPEAKER_01]: One for every three, and we're there.

375
00:33:17,656 --> 00:33:27,704
[SPEAKER_01]: As you look at active projects, that creates a little bit higher, almost we're almost at 50 active projects right now, which I think is pretty great.

376
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:45,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we kind of broke down the survey results at our last meeting, which I know was, again, the number of survey responses was a little disappointing, but the content that we really got back was really substantive.

377
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:49,690
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did break it down in here a little bit.

378
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:58,172
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest things that really came out of those surveys and our conversations and tabling, it's such a stark shift from the last time this plan was updated in 2021.

379
00:33:59,702 --> 00:34:05,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at that point, COVID was still new and we kind of, nobody had to pay rent.

380
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:10,172
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like there was a moratorium on rentals and mortgage payments.

381
00:34:10,232 --> 00:34:18,840
[SPEAKER_01]: So housing in the freshness of 2021 wasn't as stark a need as it is today.

382
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,542
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we're engaging with everybody,

383
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:25,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Housing was the number one thing folks wanted to talk about, which I thought was interesting.

384
00:34:25,603 --> 00:34:35,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Not having been here three years ago, it seemed like that did shift more from open space park projects a few years ago to now being, well, what are we going to do about housing?

385
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:50,039
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we obviously, we did, I'm actually going to skip kind of over this here.

386
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:54,830
[SPEAKER_08]: work.

387
00:34:56,231 --> 00:34:58,312
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think I want to finish my thought on me.

388
00:34:58,392 --> 00:34:59,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Just one comment on the parks.

389
00:34:59,812 --> 00:35:02,313
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, that data is really important.

390
00:35:02,453 --> 00:35:14,739
[SPEAKER_08]: I think people need to understand that because one of the fears that I think some of us had in year one, year two, was that this was just going to be a line item in the city budget, like just the CPA.

391
00:35:15,299 --> 00:35:18,520
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it is spurring on a substantial amount, that's the intent.

392
00:35:19,121 --> 00:35:20,001
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's happening.

393
00:35:20,021 --> 00:35:21,842
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's an important thing too.

394
00:35:22,966 --> 00:35:25,528
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember the very first grant we gave was like the city like $200,000.

395
00:35:26,569 --> 00:35:28,990
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of set a weird precedent.

396
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:36,396
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel like in the context of what we've done since then, it's just spurring more.

397
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,537
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not relying on a crutch.

398
00:35:39,118 --> 00:35:40,239
[SPEAKER_08]: They're doing more.

399
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:43,141
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is a supplement, which is always the intent.

400
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:48,985
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's something we need to communicate to people who, you know, everyone has different priorities.

401
00:35:49,185 --> 00:35:51,607
[SPEAKER_08]: And just to know that it's not the city is actually doing

402
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:56,586
[SPEAKER_08]: following through on the intent of the program, not relying on it as the only source.

403
00:35:56,867 --> 00:35:57,867
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really important.

404
00:35:59,269 --> 00:36:07,796
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that I do deflect a lot of conversations where CPA has been asked to be the only source for other projects.

405
00:36:07,836 --> 00:36:09,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's good.

406
00:36:09,077 --> 00:36:09,537
[SPEAKER_08]: You're there.

407
00:36:09,597 --> 00:36:13,380
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the first line of defense.

408
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,024
[SPEAKER_01]: We're being recorded, but there are some things where I'm like, where did that even come from?

409
00:36:21,357 --> 00:36:22,177
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, thank you.

410
00:36:22,217 --> 00:36:23,458
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good feedback.

411
00:36:23,478 --> 00:36:25,159
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll keep that good behavior going.

412
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:34,242
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I am going to touch on a little bit here as we look at historic preservation.

413
00:36:34,642 --> 00:36:42,805
[SPEAKER_01]: In some of my conversations, obviously, I'm engaging with residents and more of the taxpayer stakeholders.

414
00:36:43,466 --> 00:36:49,068
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I've been talking with our colleagues here in City Hall about what kind of projects are you starting to see come up,

415
00:36:49,619 --> 00:37:01,145
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that the Historical Commission has been incredibly tenacious with their seeking and receiving of grants to fund all kinds of various historical studies around the city.

416
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,786
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an interesting thing.

417
00:37:04,407 --> 00:37:05,887
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably going to have

418
00:37:08,027 --> 00:37:09,847
[SPEAKER_01]: You're on the historical commission, that's right.

419
00:37:09,867 --> 00:37:14,029
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think Ryan said he's got another one locked and loaded, waited for September.

420
00:37:14,049 --> 00:37:17,409
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot which neighborhood it was, but... There aren't many left.

421
00:37:17,629 --> 00:37:17,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

422
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:21,190
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we've worked our way across the city in the last 10 years.

423
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:21,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

424
00:37:22,151 --> 00:37:23,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Thankful nights are there right now.

425
00:37:23,891 --> 00:37:26,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yeah.

426
00:37:26,672 --> 00:37:28,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Ryan's always the next one queued up.

427
00:37:29,012 --> 00:37:30,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, which I love.

428
00:37:30,733 --> 00:37:32,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Keeps us busy.

429
00:37:33,173 --> 00:37:35,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a comment there on the photo.

430
00:37:37,165 --> 00:37:41,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the current work in progress photo on the previous page.

431
00:37:42,229 --> 00:37:47,293
[SPEAKER_04]: So we should not have to grow photos in the report.

432
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:49,235
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got lots more to show off.

433
00:37:49,415 --> 00:37:49,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

434
00:37:50,484 --> 00:37:55,705
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying, it was really hard for me to not update this necessarily with like very fresh 2024 things.

435
00:37:56,125 --> 00:37:58,066
[SPEAKER_01]: I love fresh 2024 things.

436
00:37:58,146 --> 00:38:00,887
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to get like fresh 2023 things in there, but okay.

437
00:38:01,287 --> 00:38:01,627
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

438
00:38:01,687 --> 00:38:02,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I see.

439
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:02,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

440
00:38:02,967 --> 00:38:04,508
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I'll put it in next year.

441
00:38:05,608 --> 00:38:10,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, that was a point that I didn't make on the very first page, the cover page.

442
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:17,651
[SPEAKER_04]: So a point of confusion, and I don't know if we always want to keep, like we can change precedent.

443
00:38:18,185 --> 00:38:25,531
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first year when we updated it, we thought of the plan as looking backwards and called it the 2023.

444
00:38:25,691 --> 00:38:29,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Like this would have been the 2023 report talking about what we did last year.

445
00:38:30,495 --> 00:38:31,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's confusing.

446
00:38:31,836 --> 00:38:35,939
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think I actually already changed the cover to 2024 plan.

447
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:43,384
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it makes sense to talk about this is our snapshot of who we are today and not who we were last year.

448
00:38:43,985 --> 00:38:44,205
Got it.

449
00:38:44,225 --> 00:38:46,567
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, thank you.

450
00:38:50,846 --> 00:38:55,932
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you get a new picture?

451
00:38:55,952 --> 00:38:56,413
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried.

452
00:38:56,633 --> 00:39:02,080
[SPEAKER_01]: I pulled over on the side of Fellsway to try to get a good picture.

453
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody should drive by Fellsway West.

454
00:39:05,925 --> 00:39:06,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out.

455
00:39:06,585 --> 00:39:08,648
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're almost ready for signing.

456
00:39:11,423 --> 00:39:22,767
[SPEAKER_01]: So we definitely wanted to include as we're talking about affordable housing here that the creation and generation of the affordable housing trust, as well as some of the recent.

457
00:39:22,887 --> 00:39:24,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Comments that have been directed at CPA.

458
00:39:27,604 --> 00:39:31,527
[SPEAKER_01]: As most of you know, and if not, I'll just refresh everybody's memory.

459
00:39:32,048 --> 00:39:39,313
[SPEAKER_01]: There have been some talks about potentially implementing some fees, real estate transfer fees.

460
00:39:40,874 --> 00:39:44,397
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's been talk about potentially asking the state

461
00:39:45,118 --> 00:39:53,383
[SPEAKER_04]: for to give the city the option to talk about fees.

462
00:39:53,423 --> 00:39:55,464
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not anywhere close to implementing fees.

463
00:39:55,504 --> 00:40:00,286
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just talking about asking the state for the permission to talk about it.

464
00:40:00,306 --> 00:40:14,254
[SPEAKER_04]: A response to that has been to say, well, why don't we just get more CPA funds and use more of our CPA funds for affordable housing?

465
00:40:14,785 --> 00:40:36,892
[SPEAKER_04]: which sounds like a very generous and progressive idea, but all of our entire CPA budget is hardly a drop in the bucket for the cost of affordable housing and all of those fantastic parks projects that we're contributing to that people all across the city benefit from all of our historic preservation projects.

466
00:40:37,327 --> 00:40:42,169
[SPEAKER_04]: we wouldn't be able to do those things if we committed all of our money to affordable housing.

467
00:40:42,529 --> 00:41:03,617
[SPEAKER_04]: So two things I think that I tried to articulate in a plan and I welcome everyone's feedback about whether it's been articulated well is that we wanna continue to maintain a balance between the three program areas

468
00:41:04,286 --> 00:41:30,751
[SPEAKER_04]: that we would consider being a contributor to the Affordable Housing Trust, but that they need to look for additional sources of funding, and that we want to consider supporting a request, like a ballot initiative, to increase us to the 3% level of property tax surcharge rather than the 1.5% where we are right now.

469
00:41:32,906 --> 00:41:39,089
[SPEAKER_04]: So the housing section of the plan tries to capture those ideas.

470
00:41:45,913 --> 00:41:48,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

471
00:41:48,494 --> 00:41:59,459
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted just to capture that conversations are happening right now, whether that becomes a ballot initiative.

472
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,581
[SPEAKER_01]: You just scrolled off, and it looks like Jonah's trying to read it.

473
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:04,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Joe.

474
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:05,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.

475
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:06,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

476
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:07,931
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

477
00:42:07,971 --> 00:42:08,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop.

478
00:42:08,751 --> 00:42:12,552
[SPEAKER_05]: I was reading the one that's in Dropbox, but I noticed it's different.

479
00:42:12,632 --> 00:42:17,174
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just shut it, and now I'm reading this one.

480
00:42:18,014 --> 00:42:20,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I went through and I made some formatting edits.

481
00:42:20,895 --> 00:42:21,175
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

482
00:42:21,415 --> 00:42:21,775
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

483
00:42:22,495 --> 00:42:28,737
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree that the balance, that diagram with the three almost equal pieces of the pie tells the whole story.

484
00:42:29,537 --> 00:42:30,858
[SPEAKER_08]: And I agree that's really important.

485
00:42:34,467 --> 00:43:01,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I think, so part of what we've tried to do in the three program area sections is to talk about also, in addition to what public input have we heard, what planning has gone on in the city in the last few years related to each of the three program areas, which also gathered public input and articulates goals for the city, so we can all be on the same page about what our goals are.

486
00:43:04,017 --> 00:43:13,666
[SPEAKER_04]: also trying to highlight the impact of CPA spending up till now in these three program areas.

487
00:43:13,686 --> 00:43:28,499
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of that is meant to especially have an answer to these conversations that are going on about the CPA program and provide some documentation about why we take the position that we take

488
00:43:30,532 --> 00:43:33,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do we want to balance the funding between the three program areas?

489
00:43:34,033 --> 00:43:39,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the things that we're doing in the other two program areas are also really important.

490
00:43:42,475 --> 00:43:43,875
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to be able to tell that story.

491
00:43:46,596 --> 00:43:50,537
[SPEAKER_05]: So who would drive this initiative?

492
00:43:51,417 --> 00:43:55,118
[SPEAKER_05]: We drove it as a ballot initiative when, you know,

493
00:43:56,368 --> 00:44:07,356
[SPEAKER_05]: We started this, but would the city be driving this initiative or would it be a combination of us and interested people plus the city?

494
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:10,239
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like the story has to be told.

495
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:13,101
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost like campaigning all over again for it.

496
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:18,184
[SPEAKER_05]: What else could we do if we were to increase our portion?

497
00:44:18,224 --> 00:44:22,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, what gets affected with regards to the exemptions and stuff?

498
00:44:22,508 --> 00:44:25,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Do the exemptions change based on the percentage that we

499
00:44:27,578 --> 00:44:28,358
[SPEAKER_05]: opt for?

500
00:44:28,438 --> 00:44:29,279
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't remember.

501
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:31,599
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really good question.

502
00:44:31,739 --> 00:44:35,360
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, with respect to the exemptions, the same exemptions would apply.

503
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:45,362
[SPEAKER_04]: What would change is that we would be in a pool of communities that receives a larger state match.

504
00:44:45,862 --> 00:44:48,823
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now we're getting the 14.5%.

505
00:44:49,523 --> 00:44:52,024
[SPEAKER_04]: They would give us some amount above 14.5%.

506
00:44:54,826 --> 00:44:56,791
[SPEAKER_04]: if we were in the 3% pool.

507
00:44:57,172 --> 00:45:01,002
[SPEAKER_04]: But to answer your other question, who would drive it?

508
00:45:02,121 --> 00:45:11,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I, we've started Teresa and I have started just like whispering to people to find out, you know, like take their temperature.

509
00:45:11,287 --> 00:45:12,768
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you feel about this?

510
00:45:12,828 --> 00:45:21,154
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, ideally it would come through the elected officials rather than having to be a signature campaign.

511
00:45:21,214 --> 00:45:25,597
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that right now our elected officials probably would support it.

512
00:45:26,317 --> 00:45:27,598
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, we, but,

513
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:39,137
[SPEAKER_04]: they would support it if we work with them to strategically choose a time to do it and a way to put it on the table.

514
00:45:39,577 --> 00:45:46,183
[SPEAKER_04]: So Teresa and I are going to talk with Stuart Savignore to get his take on what needs to happen.

515
00:45:46,203 --> 00:45:59,674
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're going to quietly talk to the city councilors and the mayor about whether they would support it and when and kind of how they would like to go about it.

516
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:11,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they want to do it right away if it competes with an override campaign, for example, or maybe it would strategically help an override campaign.

517
00:46:11,081 --> 00:46:11,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

518
00:46:11,541 --> 00:46:17,767
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give them the chance to have that discussion about that before we try to go around them.

519
00:46:20,737 --> 00:46:31,947
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what I'm thinking, but I just tried to plant the seed in here because I think people will bring it up as an excuse to not do something else.

520
00:46:33,349 --> 00:46:42,537
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to make sure that we have the reasons on the table that we're doing what we're doing.

521
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:54,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was just gonna say, I think this does a really good job, like educating people about the really small amount of CPA money.

522
00:46:54,272 --> 00:46:55,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you said, it's a drop in the bucket.

523
00:46:56,353 --> 00:47:00,534
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I even think that language of like, you know, we could do a surcharge of 3%.

524
00:47:00,754 --> 00:47:05,695
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the people that are really against the transfer tax, like they're gonna see that and they're gonna be like, well, I don't want that either, you know?

525
00:47:05,715 --> 00:47:12,097
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's sort of like a education piece here of like, you can't use this as an excuse, you know?

526
00:47:12,417 --> 00:47:15,358
[SPEAKER_07]: But like, if you do, then this is what's gonna happen kind of thing.

527
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:17,780
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you did a really good job with it.

528
00:47:18,741 --> 00:47:27,189
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think this is where the conversation really has to lie with just educating everybody to be like, you can't use the term CPA and CPC and not understand.

529
00:47:28,109 --> 00:47:29,150
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really not that much money.

530
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:32,033
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think you did a great job.

531
00:47:32,053 --> 00:47:33,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

532
00:47:33,334 --> 00:47:34,055
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.

533
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:45,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Ironically, one of the people who was the most staunch opponents to CPA when we passed it was Bob Penta.

534
00:47:47,321 --> 00:48:02,105
[SPEAKER_04]: And I saw him at a city council meeting recently stand up and say, we should be using CPA to support affordable housing, and we should be increasing the CPA surcharge so that we can put all that additional money into affordable housing.

535
00:48:05,078 --> 00:48:06,639
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take him for his word.

536
00:48:06,779 --> 00:48:11,583
[SPEAKER_04]: I am going to quote him on that and say Bob Penta said so.

537
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,464
[SPEAKER_05]: He gets the first lawn sign.

538
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:14,185
[SPEAKER_05]: How about that?

539
00:48:14,205 --> 00:48:21,491
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the other half of this point that he was trying to vanquish.

540
00:48:25,687 --> 00:48:32,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think what it says is, you know, the thing that people are anxious about the unknown.

541
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:45,417
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we were first, you know, putting this forth, they didn't really know how this was gonna affect their day-to-day lives, both from the additional property tax that they may pay and the benefits that the city would see.

542
00:48:45,817 --> 00:48:50,520
[SPEAKER_05]: But now we have five years under the belt of what this would do.

543
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:54,562
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I honestly think it might actually be an easier task

544
00:48:55,122 --> 00:48:59,604
[SPEAKER_05]: to increase it than was to get it passed in the first place.

545
00:49:00,905 --> 00:49:01,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

546
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:02,786
[SPEAKER_04]: It's proven now.

547
00:49:02,946 --> 00:49:14,052
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a compelling number as I'm interacting with folks, and obviously I've had conversations with people who are not supporters of CPA for whatever reason.

548
00:49:15,573 --> 00:49:21,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever I bring it back down to the average single family homeowner in fiscal year 24 will pay $86.

549
00:49:23,968 --> 00:49:27,631
[SPEAKER_01]: in tax for CPA, that tends to bring it back down there.

550
00:49:27,651 --> 00:49:30,594
[SPEAKER_01]: To your point, Joan, folks don't know the unknown.

551
00:49:30,654 --> 00:49:35,938
[SPEAKER_01]: But whenever you can put a number on it, then most people are like, oh, I pay less than $100 a year?

552
00:49:36,018 --> 00:49:37,179
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that's great.

553
00:49:37,339 --> 00:49:41,763
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

554
00:49:42,804 --> 00:49:45,586
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't think there's anything else.

555
00:49:45,866 --> 00:49:48,489
[SPEAKER_04]: We already talked about the public engagement.

556
00:49:49,405 --> 00:49:53,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, maybe is there a our own goals after?

557
00:49:53,488 --> 00:50:03,516
[SPEAKER_04]: So this page that's on the screen right now is essentially a summary of what we developed our very first plan, and we've never changed these goals and priorities.

558
00:50:03,956 --> 00:50:12,123
[SPEAKER_04]: We put them up every now and then for discussion, but I don't think our minds have changed about what those goals and priorities are.

559
00:50:12,623 --> 00:50:14,164
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can skip past that.

560
00:50:14,305 --> 00:50:16,346
[SPEAKER_04]: It does fit on one page if we use.

561
00:50:19,101 --> 00:50:23,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we format it just right.

562
00:50:23,464 --> 00:50:30,528
[SPEAKER_04]: But the procedures, that's just as much as the public needs to know about our procedures.

563
00:50:30,948 --> 00:50:34,890
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the 2021 timeline.

564
00:50:34,911 --> 00:50:36,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

565
00:50:36,391 --> 00:50:38,533
[SPEAKER_04]: And anything else that we have in the plan?

566
00:50:38,553 --> 00:50:41,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have a goals for ourselves?

567
00:50:41,454 --> 00:50:43,015
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

568
00:50:43,155 --> 00:50:43,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

569
00:50:43,576 --> 00:50:43,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

570
00:50:48,935 --> 00:50:53,698
[SPEAKER_04]: That concludes our overview of the plan.

571
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:58,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any other comments?

572
00:50:58,241 --> 00:51:04,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, if you want to go back and read it and send Teresa comments this week, that would be great.

573
00:51:04,744 --> 00:51:07,846
[SPEAKER_08]: End of the week or just let's put a date on it?

574
00:51:08,767 --> 00:51:10,147
[SPEAKER_01]: End of day Friday.

575
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:12,629
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tinker with it over the weekend.

576
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:13,169
Okay.

577
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:16,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you put the most up-to-date version in the Dropbox?

578
00:51:17,552 --> 00:51:18,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I will.

579
00:51:18,777 --> 00:51:21,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

580
00:51:22,058 --> 00:51:22,739
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.

581
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:29,842
[SPEAKER_01]: I had meant to get it in there before the meeting started, but I had a painter show up at my house at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.

582
00:51:29,862 --> 00:51:33,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yay.

583
00:51:34,003 --> 00:51:35,824
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.

584
00:51:36,084 --> 00:51:40,266
[SPEAKER_01]: So sorry if everybody's like getting their eyeballs or estimated availability.

585
00:51:40,486 --> 00:51:40,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

586
00:51:44,788 --> 00:51:45,528
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we.

587
00:51:48,492 --> 00:51:57,539
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to adopt our annual budget that we're going to appropriate for each of the program areas.

588
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:17,774
[SPEAKER_04]: In most years, we have used the minimum annual like disbursement or allocation schedule that the state gives us, which is a minimum of 10% in each of the three program areas.

589
00:52:18,341 --> 00:52:27,708
[SPEAKER_04]: a maximum of 5% in the administrative budget, and the general reserve is what's left over.

590
00:52:27,828 --> 00:52:31,751
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the flexible funding that we could spend on any program area.

591
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:45,082
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have, in some years, given an extra amount to affordable housing, anticipating that affordable housing projects

592
00:52:46,136 --> 00:52:50,340
[SPEAKER_04]: are less frequent and a larger ask each year.

593
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:54,343
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wanted to bank extra funds toward affordable housing.

594
00:52:55,104 --> 00:53:10,137
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think there was one or two years when we put 20% in the affordable housing category and 10% in each of the other two categories.

595
00:53:10,157 --> 00:53:11,538
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is an

596
00:53:12,277 --> 00:53:14,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Some communities do things differently.

597
00:53:14,577 --> 00:53:25,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Some communities put a larger amount of their funding into the program area reserves and much less is the general reserve.

598
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:38,362
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to open this for discussion among our committee, what we would like to, where we'd like to allocate our funds this year.

599
00:53:39,338 --> 00:53:41,539
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would like just to jump in just really quick.

600
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:47,881
[SPEAKER_01]: These numbers that are over here, that's what I'm estimating based off of the state match.

601
00:53:48,781 --> 00:53:52,782
[SPEAKER_01]: So the budget number here is pretty, pretty solid.

602
00:53:52,822 --> 00:53:54,283
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's like 1.986.

603
00:53:54,683 --> 00:53:58,364
[SPEAKER_01]: I have it on another spreadsheet.

604
00:53:58,524 --> 00:54:07,146
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's based off of surcharge revenue that's collected, as well as, again, the state match of 14.5%.

605
00:54:10,672 --> 00:54:16,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of bummer news, but all right.

606
00:54:17,237 --> 00:54:20,419
[SPEAKER_09]: I like generally the idea of maximum flexibility.

607
00:54:20,479 --> 00:54:28,625
[SPEAKER_09]: The only caveat there is as we see the affordable housing trust come into being, I don't know if this is going.

608
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:39,622
[SPEAKER_09]: This may not make sense this year, but I couldn't see for future years if we commit, say, 15% of our affordable housing directly to them that that should be in this annual disbursement.

609
00:54:39,762 --> 00:54:42,803
[SPEAKER_09]: But since we don't have that agreement at this point, it may not.

610
00:54:43,263 --> 00:54:47,063
[SPEAKER_09]: It probably is not appropriate for this year, but just thinking out loud.

611
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:55,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you suggesting 15% just to the affordable housing trust and no other allocation?

612
00:54:55,065 --> 00:54:56,085
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to clarify.

613
00:54:57,149 --> 00:55:09,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, that was not a specific number intentionally, but we have discussed in the past as that 1 of the things we are considering as a way of supporting them is to allocate part of our.

614
00:55:09,815 --> 00:55:15,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Agreement and we decided we are not doing that for now that we are kind of still going project by project.

615
00:55:16,759 --> 00:55:25,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, it was a, if we get to a point where even going project by project, perhaps we say this is something that we're prioritizing.

616
00:55:26,676 --> 00:55:28,558
[SPEAKER_09]: This could make sense, but we're not there.

617
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:33,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is to say, I like the flexibility.

618
00:55:33,802 --> 00:55:36,584
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is good.

619
00:55:36,664 --> 00:55:39,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I just saw Joan's shirt and it's incredible.

620
00:55:39,106 --> 00:55:42,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you like that?

621
00:55:42,228 --> 00:55:43,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing.

622
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:44,851
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really old.

623
00:55:44,871 --> 00:55:46,612
[SPEAKER_05]: I got it in Davis Square.

624
00:55:46,652 --> 00:55:48,794
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, Somerville, the gateway to Midford.

625
00:55:54,483 --> 00:55:55,684
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a collector's item.

626
00:55:56,084 --> 00:56:11,349
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a collector's item.

627
00:56:12,129 --> 00:56:14,230
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, go ahead.

628
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:19,792
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just wondering, have we gotten many applications in yet?

629
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,922
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't opened the annual funding round for this year yet.

630
00:56:24,962 --> 00:56:26,844
[SPEAKER_01]: That will open up later this summer.

631
00:56:27,284 --> 00:56:31,567
[SPEAKER_01]: We just have these small little off-cycle or small grant applications come through.

632
00:56:32,708 --> 00:56:44,136
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, the distribution of the budget would probably be more reliant on how many applications we got in each category, wouldn't it?

633
00:56:46,478 --> 00:56:49,440
[SPEAKER_04]: If we maximize flexibility, yes.

634
00:56:50,565 --> 00:56:56,189
[SPEAKER_04]: So the state requires us to put a minimum of 10% toward each category.

635
00:56:56,209 --> 00:57:12,199
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we leave 65% in the general reserve, as is shown on this table right now, then we can put that toward any funding category, whatever applications we receive.

636
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:16,482
[SPEAKER_00]: So traditionally, we would

637
00:57:17,515 --> 00:57:21,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditionally, we've used it a little bit more for open space.

638
00:57:22,597 --> 00:57:31,160
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I think that the pie chart showed that historic preservation was second and then affordable housing was third.

639
00:57:33,821 --> 00:57:44,905
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't flip it up and down, but if that trend continues, I mean, I know there's an awful lot of scuttlebutt about affordable housing, but

640
00:57:45,699 --> 00:58:01,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Considering the amount of money that we actually have to offer out, I don't see why we would increase any one of the budgets as far as our estimates are concerned.

641
00:58:01,805 --> 00:58:09,567
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think that we'd leave them right where they are and then figure out what we're going to get in as far as applications are concerned.

642
00:58:17,345 --> 00:58:25,548
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think I'm hearing from a couple of you that we lean toward maximizing our flexibility.

643
00:58:26,548 --> 00:58:42,833
[SPEAKER_04]: And in past years, we felt that it would be important to at least start affordable housing off with a handicap because often we don't get applications in affordable housing and we want to make sure that we

644
00:58:44,353 --> 00:58:55,002
[SPEAKER_04]: set aside enough money so that an application next year will have enough money to give it because it comes less frequently in bigger amounts.

645
00:58:57,284 --> 00:59:08,193
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I don't want to lean too hard seeing how important the work has been that we've done in the other program areas.

646
00:59:10,751 --> 00:59:16,134
[SPEAKER_04]: And we may have an affordable housing trust that will apply for funding this year.

647
00:59:16,434 --> 00:59:17,414
[SPEAKER_04]: It's to be determined.

648
00:59:17,434 --> 00:59:18,935
[SPEAKER_04]: It hasn't been appointed yet.

649
00:59:19,115 --> 00:59:32,142
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't think that there are any affordable housing projects in the pipeline that I'm aware of that are going to apply for funds this year.

650
00:59:32,162 --> 00:59:33,903
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not that I'm aware of.

651
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:37,741
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm not sure.

652
00:59:37,761 --> 00:59:40,364
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure what the is planning on this year.

653
00:59:40,384 --> 00:59:49,593
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I was just thinking, just because of the climate in the city, you know, just all the conversation and talking points are pushing affordable housing.

654
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:56,900
[SPEAKER_07]: That, you know, if we did increase that percentage, it sort of shows that, like, we're listening, you know, we're, we're doing what, you know.

655
00:59:57,638 --> 01:00:01,840
[SPEAKER_07]: people are asking for, you know, even if it was just 15% or just a small increment.

656
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:11,344
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I personally agree with Reg, you know, the pot of money is small, like, you know, 10% seems fair, and then the general reserve is there for anything else.

657
01:00:12,305 --> 01:00:18,888
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just wondering if like, you know, just for appearances, you know, if we, if it was increased, you know, that that would bode well with the public.

658
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:25,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I tend to agree with that position too.

659
01:00:28,193 --> 01:00:42,289
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is non-binding essentially, I mean, can we get applications, can we not change our minds about, so we're locked in here?

660
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:48,877
[SPEAKER_03]: When we put it into the bucket, we're locked, that money's locked into that channel, so.

661
01:00:52,742 --> 01:00:55,683
[SPEAKER_09]: In that case, I think I'm going to change my vote slightly too.

662
01:00:55,783 --> 01:00:59,604
[SPEAKER_09]: I do like the idea of increasing affordable housing a little bit.

663
01:00:59,784 --> 01:01:09,948
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, at these numbers, it is symbolic, but that is the current discussion, but moving it to 15% instead of 10, we are locked in.

664
01:01:10,388 --> 01:01:11,488
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not that much money.

665
01:01:11,508 --> 01:01:16,070
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been convinced in that direction.

666
01:01:20,878 --> 01:01:34,505
[SPEAKER_04]: So the suggestion is that it should be 10% open space, 15% affordable housing, 10% historic preservation, and 60% general reserve.

667
01:01:35,986 --> 01:01:36,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Agreed.

668
01:01:38,568 --> 01:01:39,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Seems a good consensus.

669
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:44,330
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks right.

670
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,132
[SPEAKER_03]: I see what you're saying.

671
01:01:59,561 --> 01:02:01,562
[SPEAKER_04]: have to do that later.

672
01:02:01,662 --> 01:02:02,022
[SPEAKER_02]: I will.

673
01:02:02,062 --> 01:02:05,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I promise that I'll be right, folks.

674
01:02:05,564 --> 01:02:06,724
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go right now.

675
01:02:07,785 --> 01:02:14,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you're going to use the actual budget and not the rounded budget anyway.

676
01:02:14,328 --> 01:02:14,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

677
01:02:15,446 --> 01:02:35,057
[SPEAKER_04]: So okay, so based on the annual displacement percentage that we see on the screen rather than the actual dollar numbers, is there a motion to approve this budget for the CBC for FY25?

678
01:02:35,077 --> 01:02:39,119
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make the motion.

679
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:43,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't see who that was.

680
01:02:43,842 --> 01:02:44,322
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Kayleen.

681
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:45,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Kaylene, thank you.

682
01:02:49,642 --> 01:02:51,442
[SPEAKER_04]: And... I'll second that.

683
01:02:52,023 --> 01:02:52,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, go ahead.

684
01:02:53,403 --> 01:02:54,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard Doug first.

685
01:02:54,984 --> 01:02:55,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

686
01:02:57,205 --> 01:02:58,345
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will call the roll.

687
01:02:58,745 --> 01:02:59,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Joan?

688
01:03:00,686 --> 01:03:01,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

689
01:03:01,946 --> 01:03:02,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Ari?

690
01:03:03,227 --> 01:03:03,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

691
01:03:04,367 --> 01:03:04,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Doug?

692
01:03:04,967 --> 01:03:05,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

693
01:03:05,808 --> 01:03:06,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Kaylene?

694
01:03:08,009 --> 01:03:08,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

695
01:03:09,549 --> 01:03:09,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Reg?

696
01:03:10,549 --> 01:03:10,830
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

697
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:13,851
[SPEAKER_04]: And myself, yes.

698
01:03:17,027 --> 01:03:24,892
[SPEAKER_04]: So the motion passes, but I just want to come back and read this, Reg, your reasoning for voting no.

699
01:03:27,133 --> 01:03:31,816
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe that we needed to address the discrepancy.

700
01:03:31,916 --> 01:03:41,142
[SPEAKER_00]: If we've been given equal parts to each one of the categories, open space, affordable housing, and historic preservation,

701
01:03:43,306 --> 01:03:50,753
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't feel the need to increase the budget for affordable housing until we find out what we get as far.

702
01:03:50,793 --> 01:03:56,257
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know that we can't do it afterwards now, but I just don't feel there's a need for that.

703
01:03:56,417 --> 01:03:57,498
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just my opinion.

704
01:03:57,638 --> 01:03:57,999
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.

705
01:03:59,400 --> 01:03:59,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

706
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:04,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to have your position in the open.

707
01:04:04,884 --> 01:04:05,625
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

708
01:04:06,305 --> 01:04:11,550
[SPEAKER_04]: I would suggest crown down when there are numbers, when there are cents.

709
01:04:16,568 --> 01:04:18,289
[SPEAKER_04]: I got in trouble once for rounding up.

710
01:04:18,649 --> 01:04:19,929
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a very bad thing.

711
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:22,731
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

712
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:29,913
[SPEAKER_04]: The only other thing that we have regarding the annual plan review is application materials.

713
01:04:31,574 --> 01:04:36,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to do quickly take us through the application materials?

714
01:04:37,216 --> 01:04:42,818
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if I don't think any of the many members currently have experience

715
01:04:44,905 --> 01:04:54,968
[SPEAKER_04]: using our application in the current format.

716
01:04:54,988 --> 01:05:05,411
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll walk through what it looks like and try to... So everybody should be seeing CPA application.

717
01:05:07,391 --> 01:05:10,312
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a Smartsheet form, it's done online.

718
01:05:11,377 --> 01:05:15,498
[SPEAKER_01]: We do accept paid for applications, although we really, really don't want to.

719
01:05:16,138 --> 01:05:18,159
[SPEAKER_01]: But so we always direct folks to here.

720
01:05:18,179 --> 01:05:20,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Start with just the basics.

721
01:05:21,259 --> 01:05:22,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just skim through it really quickly.

722
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:28,641
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't wanna bore us here, but applicant information.

723
01:05:29,181 --> 01:05:33,382
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, actually, I think I might still have one.

724
01:05:34,662 --> 01:05:37,383
[SPEAKER_04]: What we want to think about is from our perspective,

725
01:05:38,001 --> 01:05:48,948
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to make sure that we're getting the information that we need to help us make a decision, answer our own questions about the projects.

726
01:05:48,968 --> 01:05:58,393
[SPEAKER_01]: So project narrative, this is where folks can write an essay basically on what it is that they're trying to accomplish here rather than it being bullet points and just budget sheets.

727
01:05:58,434 --> 01:06:04,077
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually the story of what they're doing and why they're doing it.

728
01:06:27,954 --> 01:06:29,935
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going too fast or too slow.

729
01:06:35,779 --> 01:06:44,405
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, in this project section, we're really trying to get into the nuts and bolts of exactly what it is and how it aligns with the CPA goals.

730
01:06:44,885 --> 01:06:48,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me take a quick look at that CPA budget summary for me.

731
01:06:48,268 --> 01:06:49,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I hate this one.

732
01:06:49,608 --> 01:06:50,529
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to change it.

733
01:06:50,549 --> 01:06:52,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we should probably change it.

734
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:53,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, something went wrong.

735
01:06:55,878 --> 01:07:01,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, we're going to change it anyway because we need to come up with a better budget.

736
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:12,764
[SPEAKER_01]: We've actually, we saw an example of it tonight while we were looking at the Trees Medford application, which I think this is the decision I had mocked up.

737
01:07:12,784 --> 01:07:22,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Dropbox, it's not the Dropbox.

738
01:07:22,867 --> 01:07:23,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry folks.

739
01:07:25,734 --> 01:07:26,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Too many tabs open.

740
01:07:27,234 --> 01:07:51,739
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very basic spreadsheet that asks folks to identify all of their various funding sources.

741
01:07:53,118 --> 01:07:55,700
[SPEAKER_01]: and line item budget for their project.

742
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:00,844
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a little clunky right now in that it's not very intuitive.

743
01:08:01,124 --> 01:08:10,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks just will usually put, oh, my project budget is $150,000 rather than, you know, this aspect is 50, I have this much of contingency and what have you.

744
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:13,892
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's some room for improving that.

745
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:16,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so let's take a look at that.

746
01:08:17,608 --> 01:08:24,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you gotten feedback in the past about how easy it is or saving the middle?

747
01:08:25,357 --> 01:08:27,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's pretty much the number one.

748
01:08:30,433 --> 01:08:35,155
[SPEAKER_01]: complaints about our application process is that you cannot save it as you're going.

749
01:08:35,595 --> 01:08:43,839
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a little disclaimer here about what I have since doing this last year's application cycle.

750
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:50,782
[SPEAKER_01]: I've created a template for folks to use that as they're writing their grant and then they can copy paste.

751
01:08:50,862 --> 01:08:55,504
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still a little clunky, but it's at least the same exact questions in an editable form.

752
01:08:56,673 --> 01:09:05,786
[SPEAKER_01]: My, my thought we were talking about this earlier is instead of just putting a nice little disclaimer here actually linking to that template that folks can access right then and there.

753
01:09:05,806 --> 01:09:06,647
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good idea.

754
01:09:07,528 --> 01:09:09,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that actually that solves the problem.

755
01:09:10,553 --> 01:09:10,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

756
01:09:24,054 --> 01:09:27,457
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have an example of the packet from the trees thing.

757
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:31,260
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can't see what the result is in a condensed form.

758
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:31,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

759
01:09:32,721 --> 01:09:37,805
[SPEAKER_01]: I can pull up that application if it's helpful to close it out.

760
01:09:40,067 --> 01:09:41,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you seeing the need to change anything else?

761
01:09:44,791 --> 01:09:48,133
[SPEAKER_04]: This was updated last year.

762
01:09:48,954 --> 01:09:53,338
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm more comfortable with this now than what we had in the past.

763
01:09:55,151 --> 01:10:00,574
[SPEAKER_04]: myself, but it's always worth taking a look at it.

764
01:10:00,594 --> 01:10:05,598
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that this is, for me, this section here, why is project needed?

765
01:10:05,638 --> 01:10:11,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I think we have too many questions kind of stacked up in there, so it doesn't really pass my eyeball test.

766
01:10:11,402 --> 01:10:15,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if we broke it out in a little bit, like, why is this project needed?

767
01:10:15,745 --> 01:10:20,709
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe bullet point, like, think about how the project serves the public, what populations it will serve.

768
01:10:20,989 --> 01:10:21,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you send a link to

769
01:10:22,564 --> 01:10:25,446
[SPEAKER_08]: what you think are successful grant applications that would be good templates.

770
01:10:26,127 --> 01:10:26,667
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do that.

771
01:10:26,687 --> 01:10:36,875
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that would be what I would be looking for is something when I'm competing against and what you're looking for, you know, for maybe a couple, you know, one in open space, one in.

772
01:10:37,295 --> 01:10:38,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's a good idea.

773
01:10:38,696 --> 01:10:42,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Just that's always easier to say, here's a good one.

774
01:10:43,219 --> 01:10:51,245
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, I'm doing that right now with some people as they're getting prepared for either next year's funding cycle or if they're doing off-cycle, I'm like, here's a good one, copy that one.

775
01:10:52,763 --> 01:11:01,868
[SPEAKER_04]: So we want to make sure that we have this ready to go with a month before the first due date is.

776
01:11:02,148 --> 01:11:07,851
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the limit on how much time we can spend tinkering.

777
01:11:08,792 --> 01:11:17,317
[SPEAKER_01]: I think overall, the feedback as I'm talking with applicants, nobody said like, oh my gosh, your questions are so wordy or it's too long.

778
01:11:18,511 --> 01:11:23,356
[SPEAKER_01]: really was just kind of, it's inconvenient for me to walk away and come back to it half an hour later.

779
01:11:24,097 --> 01:11:28,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody really seemed to have issues with the substance of our questions.

780
01:11:29,683 --> 01:11:33,747
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, we've all, it's more or less written grants at some point.

781
01:11:34,128 --> 01:11:37,752
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't that bad as far as some grant applications go.

782
01:11:38,063 --> 01:11:48,011
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why there are so many questions stacked in front of one box is so that they don't feel like they have to answer each of those questions individually.

783
01:11:48,251 --> 01:11:52,815
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's trying to reduce the amount of writing they have to do.

784
01:11:54,096 --> 01:11:57,598
[SPEAKER_04]: But it might be possible to simplify it.

785
01:11:57,618 --> 01:11:57,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

786
01:12:09,878 --> 01:12:10,919
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this is pretty standard.

787
01:12:11,019 --> 01:12:16,602
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I, you know, I looked at it and I compared it to Lexington's, which I've had to do like myself many times.

788
01:12:16,722 --> 01:12:19,864
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's any more onerous than theirs.

789
01:12:19,945 --> 01:12:22,766
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's even online.

790
01:12:23,067 --> 01:12:27,990
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think this is I think this is fine.

791
01:12:28,270 --> 01:12:28,870
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's worthy.

792
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:30,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

793
01:12:31,752 --> 01:12:32,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Kelly.

794
01:12:36,495 --> 01:12:36,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, then.

795
01:12:37,176 --> 01:12:39,277
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't I tinker with

796
01:12:39,677 --> 01:12:46,918
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, updating it for 2024 dates, putting in that template, embedding it in here.

797
01:12:46,938 --> 01:12:54,160
[SPEAKER_01]: I might just kind of tinker with some of the formatting of the questions, but keep it there.

798
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:58,580
[SPEAKER_01]: But otherwise, it doesn't really sound like we need to overhaul this.

799
01:12:59,040 --> 01:12:59,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

800
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:00,581
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think so.

801
01:13:00,661 --> 01:13:00,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

802
01:13:01,781 --> 01:13:03,221
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go ahead and stop sharing.

803
01:13:03,261 --> 01:13:08,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, there was a link to the application materials in the Dropbox if folks wanted to

804
01:13:09,123 --> 01:13:11,144
[SPEAKER_01]: look directly at it themselves as well.

805
01:13:14,725 --> 01:13:15,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

806
01:13:15,205 --> 01:13:16,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everybody.

807
01:13:16,345 --> 01:13:19,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate the feedback on that.

808
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:26,088
[SPEAKER_04]: So that concludes our update of the annual plan and our budget and everything.

809
01:13:26,108 --> 01:13:29,609
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all our business for this month.

810
01:13:29,929 --> 01:13:37,932
[SPEAKER_04]: So is there anything else that we wanted to, anyone wanted to bring up for the group?

811
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:43,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

812
01:13:43,572 --> 01:13:44,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Membership.

813
01:13:44,433 --> 01:13:46,594
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know we have a couple of vacancies.

814
01:13:47,614 --> 01:13:50,656
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the update on the search?

815
01:13:51,336 --> 01:13:53,557
[SPEAKER_01]: We interviewed one candidate.

816
01:13:53,837 --> 01:13:55,138
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to nail down.

817
01:13:55,178 --> 01:13:57,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Ari, for nudging me about Ada.

818
01:13:57,319 --> 01:14:00,080
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to get in touch with Ada.

819
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:01,501
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll reach back out again.

820
01:14:01,521 --> 01:14:06,143
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have incorrect contact information, so I'm not.

821
01:14:07,505 --> 01:14:15,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and we did take a very long time to respond because we have been trying to get more applicants in.

822
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:26,157
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's really been the hang up is having only one person at a time who we're in conversation with.

823
01:14:27,218 --> 01:14:33,182
[SPEAKER_04]: We really wanted to have the opportunity to open up the membership to a wider

824
01:14:35,893 --> 01:14:39,655
[SPEAKER_04]: more diverse group of folks.

825
01:14:40,036 --> 01:14:49,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's unfortunate that we need folks at the same time that the CD board I think needs a person as well as they're obviously staffing the affordable housing trust.

826
01:14:50,582 --> 01:14:58,486
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were a couple of really great candidates that I thought could have brought their expertise over but they're kind of being earmarked.

827
01:14:59,287 --> 01:15:04,270
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think to follow up with you about the mayor's suggestion when I ran into her last week.

828
01:15:04,748 --> 01:15:07,790
[SPEAKER_01]: I reached out to a couple of folks that were on a list.

829
01:15:07,810 --> 01:15:16,994
[SPEAKER_01]: There was another list that the mayor pointed us towards and one person declined and the other person I haven't heard back from yet, but I did reach out to them last week.

830
01:15:17,735 --> 01:15:24,218
[SPEAKER_01]: So things that we've got pokers in the fire, so hopefully we'll be able to appoint a couple of folks here soon.

831
01:15:25,258 --> 01:15:26,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for bringing that up, Joan.

832
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:28,560
[SPEAKER_07]: How many vacancies are there?

833
01:15:29,381 --> 01:15:29,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Two.

834
01:15:30,041 --> 01:15:30,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Two.

835
01:15:32,202 --> 01:15:33,803
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're both the at-large

836
01:15:35,638 --> 01:15:38,419
[SPEAKER_01]: There's technically four at-large appointments.

837
01:15:39,019 --> 01:15:39,879
[SPEAKER_01]: These are two of those.

838
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:46,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Teresa, do you need Ada's email to double-check you have the right one or anything?

839
01:15:47,241 --> 01:15:47,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

840
01:15:47,621 --> 01:15:50,782
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can send that to me, that would be great.

841
01:15:51,442 --> 01:15:54,863
[SPEAKER_01]: We were very eager to connect and it just hasn't happened, so I appreciate that.

842
01:15:57,764 --> 01:16:01,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else?

843
01:16:02,957 --> 01:16:05,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that is everything that we needed to cover today.

844
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:07,120
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tease this out.

845
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:12,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Just maybe next month, we should probably start thinking about when our social outing is.

846
01:16:13,243 --> 01:16:23,470
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you all just wanted to start thinking about some ideas so we can all hang out outside of Zoom and Room 201.

847
01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:26,632
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe come up with some ideas next month.

848
01:16:26,652 --> 01:16:27,412
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be great.

849
01:16:29,854 --> 01:16:32,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, I don't think I had anything else.

850
01:16:32,622 --> 01:16:35,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question that's somewhat related to that.

851
01:16:35,963 --> 01:16:39,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we know what's going into the vault space?

852
01:16:41,064 --> 01:16:41,624
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't.

853
01:16:42,384 --> 01:16:47,526
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's another restaurant, but we're unaware.

854
01:16:47,946 --> 01:16:54,727
[SPEAKER_01]: My boss, Alicia Hunt, she's been having conversations, but we don't know who the actual restaurant that is going in.

855
01:16:54,767 --> 01:16:57,308
[SPEAKER_01]: We just know that it will remain a restaurant.

856
01:16:59,743 --> 01:17:04,807
[SPEAKER_05]: And do we know when the Irish pub is supposed to open two doors down from the Cuba?

857
01:17:05,868 --> 01:17:11,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I know that that... You see my theme here, Doug.

858
01:17:11,532 --> 01:17:12,412
[SPEAKER_05]: You see my theme.

859
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:16,135
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds like it's a pub crawl.

860
01:17:16,315 --> 01:17:17,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

861
01:17:19,738 --> 01:17:21,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

862
01:17:21,799 --> 01:17:24,061
[SPEAKER_01]: I will find out about the Irish pub.

863
01:17:24,101 --> 01:17:25,302
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that they're...

864
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:27,550
[SPEAKER_01]: the owner has been working out.

865
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:33,995
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's in the middle of its build out, but I'm not sure exactly where in the progress.

866
01:17:34,035 --> 01:17:38,779
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, it's coming.

867
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:40,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

868
01:17:40,501 --> 01:17:42,763
[SPEAKER_05]: And how about the Great American Beer Hall?

869
01:17:42,843 --> 01:17:47,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just take it all the way back to that.

870
01:17:47,507 --> 01:17:50,849
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have knowledge about where that stands.

871
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:51,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

872
01:17:51,430 --> 01:17:51,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do.

873
01:17:52,977 --> 01:17:54,478
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good to know.

874
01:17:54,778 --> 01:17:57,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Second question, will it be open this fall?

875
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:02,761
[SPEAKER_01]: We are all very hopeful that it will be open in the fall, yes.

876
01:18:04,461 --> 01:18:07,862
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I have to say about that.

877
01:18:07,882 --> 01:18:11,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can text me, Joan.

878
01:18:11,063 --> 01:18:11,744
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all right.

879
01:18:12,244 --> 01:18:17,326
[SPEAKER_05]: And did you share the good news with Roberta about the presumed?

880
01:18:18,066 --> 01:18:19,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you do it, Joan?

881
01:18:22,623 --> 01:18:26,224
[SPEAKER_05]: I got the Preserve Medford site back up.

882
01:18:26,484 --> 01:18:29,625
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, there was a version history that they were able to restore.

883
01:18:29,665 --> 01:18:30,725
[SPEAKER_05]: We keep backups.

884
01:18:31,025 --> 01:18:35,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I talked to Hadley and I was like, thoughts, ideas?

885
01:18:36,106 --> 01:18:42,388
[SPEAKER_05]: She said, talk to your host and see if they have a backup they can load.

886
01:18:42,848 --> 01:18:45,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, wipe the whole site out and restore backup.

887
01:18:45,948 --> 01:18:48,249
[SPEAKER_05]: We restored the backup from January 8th.

888
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:52,371
[SPEAKER_05]: which was far back enough to bring it back online, so.

889
01:18:52,611 --> 01:18:52,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

890
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:53,691
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good, good.

891
01:18:54,231 --> 01:18:57,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I forgot that was, was that Friday?

892
01:18:57,092 --> 01:19:01,433
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so, I don't know.

893
01:19:01,453 --> 01:19:03,634
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have it available.

894
01:19:04,254 --> 01:19:15,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so I know that there was some discussion about moving most of the information onto the city's website, but having the ability to post our own information if we wanted to in a more timely manner, so.

895
01:19:15,737 --> 01:19:16,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

896
01:19:16,058 --> 01:19:16,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.

897
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:19,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I don't know if everybody saw.

898
01:19:19,771 --> 01:19:23,173
[SPEAKER_01]: I shared from preserve Medford's Facebook page.

899
01:19:23,474 --> 01:19:26,616
[SPEAKER_01]: The updates of what's the restoration at World War One Memorial.

900
01:19:27,256 --> 01:19:32,339
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, I shared it into the Facebook group and it was so nice seeing such positive comments come back.

901
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:39,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is super supportive of the program, so if anybody does want to go check it out, the statue itself is is complete.

902
01:19:40,164 --> 01:19:42,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're working on the Plaza, which is much more work to do.

903
01:19:43,006 --> 01:19:46,128
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to go check it out, it looks brand new.

904
01:19:46,208 --> 01:19:47,389
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how the heck they did it,

905
01:19:48,332 --> 01:19:52,395
[SPEAKER_01]: the edges of the limestone look sharper and everything just looks super crisp.

906
01:19:52,556 --> 01:19:54,537
[SPEAKER_01]: So I recommend it.

907
01:19:54,657 --> 01:20:00,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that guy that showed up with his sandblaster and he was ready to go in to clean that thing up?

908
01:20:00,723 --> 01:20:03,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was a little worried, Joan, about that one.

909
01:20:03,065 --> 01:20:06,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I was like... Anytime's instruction.

910
01:20:06,628 --> 01:20:07,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Anytime.

911
01:20:07,749 --> 01:20:07,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
