00:01:11,426 --> 00:01:12,286
Not yet.

28
00:01:12,986 --> 00:01:13,286
Not yet.

29
00:01:13,426 --> 00:01:13,926
OK, great.

30
00:01:15,347 --> 00:01:17,207
If we can all rise to please salute the flag.

31
00:01:18,047 --> 00:01:28,710
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

32
00:01:30,794 --> 00:01:40,320
We have our consent agenda, approval of bills and payrolls, approval of capital purchases, approval of grants, approval of field trips.

33
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:48,424
We have our Medford Vocational Technical High School day trip with automotive technology, New England Dragway in New Hampshire.

34
00:01:49,445 --> 00:01:57,730
We have our Andrews Middle School day trip to Canobie Lake Park and our McGlynn Middle School day trip to Canobie Lake Park.

35
00:01:59,492 --> 00:02:05,294
We also have approval of meeting minutes from our regular meeting on May 5th, 2025.

36
00:02:05,935 --> 00:02:07,335
Is there a motion for approval?

37
00:02:07,355 --> 00:02:13,738
I remember in Tapa seconded by member old party.

38
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,361
All those in favor?

39
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:17,003
All those opposed?

40
00:02:17,903 --> 00:02:18,644
Paper passes.

41
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:21,547
We do not have any reports of subcommittees.

42
00:02:22,488 --> 00:02:24,950
We have a number of reports of our superintendent.

43
00:02:25,431 --> 00:02:29,315
The first is enhancing the Medford Public Schools after school programming.

44
00:02:29,335 --> 00:02:33,038
So I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Suzanne Galluzzi, our interim superintendent.

45
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,280
Thank you very much.

46
00:02:35,793 --> 00:02:36,174
Thank you.

47
00:02:36,835 --> 00:02:45,714
So this evening I'm going to be presenting on the district's approach to expanding our after school program on behalf of Metro Public Schools students and families.

48
00:02:47,339 --> 00:02:56,464
And I do have to say that as part of my transition, I had listening sessions at all of the elementary schools well at all of the schools, but at every listening session.

49
00:02:57,964 --> 00:03:05,548
The plight of the after school programming was discussed in detail, I heard a lot of concerns and a lot of like suggestions.

50
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:09,911
how we can make improvements in this area.

51
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:27,864
So I just want to really acknowledge that we hear you and we totally understand, which is why tonight we're going to have a little conversation about how we can kind of thoughtfully expand the afterschool programming for Medford Public Schools.

52
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:31,867
I'm going to, I can't really, I'll wait.

53
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:35,590
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

54
00:03:40,135 --> 00:03:40,635
Okay, thank you.

55
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:45,960
So the objectives in expanding Medford Public Schools afterschool programming.

56
00:03:47,382 --> 00:03:49,844
There are five areas in where we have objectives.

57
00:03:49,884 --> 00:04:00,113
The first one is our program management, where we are going to be doing an ongoing evaluation of programming, curriculum, staffing structures, and our finances.

58
00:04:00,934 --> 00:04:14,664
The second is a look at our enrollment to increase capacity district wide, particularly at two elementary schools that have a large wait list, look at staffing.

59
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:25,052
And so in order to increase capacity in our afterschool programming, we really need to hire some additional staff, dedicated staff to

60
00:04:26,564 --> 00:04:27,165
Increased seats.

61
00:04:27,565 --> 00:04:28,125
Partnership.

62
00:04:28,546 --> 00:04:33,310
So collaboration is very important in all work, but especially in this work.

63
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:46,462
So partnerships with current staff, as well as new staff, partnerships with caregivers, and professional partnerships are all going to be needed in order to increase this capacity.

64
00:04:47,303 --> 00:04:48,424
And then communication.

65
00:04:48,544 --> 00:04:52,448
So aligning communication methods and channels in a

66
00:04:52,908 --> 00:05:03,780
programmatic approach is definitely needed to help understand and update our schedules, timelines, and our efforts of expansion.

67
00:05:05,444 --> 00:05:24,102
So on the next slide, key players and some oversight of responsibilities would be myself, which will have a stake in the vision of expanding this program and what Medford Public Schools Afterschool Program is, and communication with stakeholders.

68
00:05:25,565 --> 00:05:38,318
We also are going to be working with Andrew Munford in his basic program, which I will get into a little bit more detail later on in the presentation.

69
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:45,325
Megan Fidle-Carrie is currently the afterschool director.

70
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,266
She is a

71
00:05:48,897 --> 00:05:58,622
integral part of the program for day-to-day management, staff oversight, and key partnership with BASIC.

72
00:05:59,802 --> 00:06:07,326
And then communications, our communications director, Will Pippicelli will take the key role in communications for the afterschool program.

73
00:06:08,006 --> 00:06:11,268
He will work on developing a frequently asked questions document.

74
00:06:11,808 --> 00:06:25,775
He will work on communication plans and templates, and then make sure that he's collaborating and working on a system for enrollment each year and communicating that out in a timely manner.

75
00:06:26,707 --> 00:06:38,591
And then there's the creation and maintenance of the afterschool task force, which was really a wonderful grassroots effort from very dedicated caregivers in Metro Public Schools.

76
00:06:39,271 --> 00:06:50,894
And so that representation of caregivers at the table for ongoing feedback and input and perspective and decision-making will be key for us.

77
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:56,910
Next slide talks a little bit about the consultancy.

78
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:07,893
So beginning now and for next year, we're going to engage in a consultancy with Andrew and the BASIC team.

79
00:07:09,673 --> 00:07:11,494
That consists of three phases.

80
00:07:11,814 --> 00:07:20,716
We feel that this consultancy is really going to allow us some critical information to see how we can

81
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:25,773
maintain some local control over the program.

82
00:07:26,234 --> 00:07:36,238
It's very important for us to maintain some of that local control and build on the hiring that we have and the program that we have to serve our needs for Medford.

83
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:42,861
And so in partnership with Andrew, this consultancy will consist of three phases.

84
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:45,262
And the first phase is, yes?

85
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:48,003
Member Rheinfeld?

86
00:07:49,362 --> 00:07:56,627
I'm not sure everyone who has is listening in is familiar with this basic acronym and who Andrew is so if you could go back a little bit.

87
00:07:57,127 --> 00:07:58,268
Yes, thank you very much.

88
00:07:58,488 --> 00:08:09,716
And so I might need so Belmont after school education collected what I'm not sure if I know the entire acronym, but Andrew Munford.

89
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,151
started an afterschool program in two districts.

90
00:08:17,591 --> 00:08:19,492
It began in Belmont.

91
00:08:19,652 --> 00:08:21,532
It has expanded to Maynard.

92
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:25,973
It is independent of those two school districts.

93
00:08:26,013 --> 00:08:36,316
So it is an independent afterschool program that is housed within the facilities, the school facilities in those two communities.

94
00:08:37,356 --> 00:08:38,997
And he has been able to

95
00:08:40,397 --> 00:08:45,980
increase capacity in those two districts and decrease the wait lists.

96
00:08:46,621 --> 00:08:51,143
He's, oh, Education Collaborative?

97
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:53,645
Enrichment Collaborative, thank you so much for that.

98
00:08:56,466 --> 00:09:05,652
And so in saying that, to not completely remove and privatize without kind of diligent efforts,

99
00:09:06,503 --> 00:09:23,992
to expand first within Metro Public Schools, but knowing that we need some help and support, and quite honestly, just a fresh kind of way of looking at things, he's going to partner with us every step of the way, starting now and through next year.

100
00:09:24,673 --> 00:09:29,035
So the first phase of his consultancy is a program assessment.

101
00:09:29,595 --> 00:09:34,778
So we will be working hand in hand with him, giving him all of our data, he's going to be

102
00:09:35,252 --> 00:09:46,718
gathering data, doing interviews, site visits, all the things that he needs to identify capacity needs and create a plan, honestly.

103
00:09:47,118 --> 00:10:02,885
So phase two is that strategic development where he'll take all of that gathered data and he will create short-term goals that we could probably implement right next year, as well as long-term goals to grow the program from school year 27 and on.

104
00:10:05,787 --> 00:10:17,313
his plan will include what it would cost Medford Public Schools, what the implications are, and also partner with us in the creation of associated schedules and curriculum.

105
00:10:18,214 --> 00:10:24,557
Those two things are the priorities for right now and for next year.

106
00:10:25,578 --> 00:10:28,420
Phase three, which we are all set to do,

107
00:10:29,522 --> 00:10:41,426
but comes after those first two phases are done, is that like ongoing professional development and training that our staff need and will just enhance the program.

108
00:10:42,366 --> 00:10:48,869
We can partner with him in the PD that he does with his current two programs in Belmont and Maynard.

109
00:10:49,369 --> 00:10:52,370
It can also be tailored specifically to Medford Public Schools.

110
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,891
So some of those conversations will be had throughout the year.

111
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:00,919
Member Graham.

112
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:01,760
Thank you.

113
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:28,974
I just also wanted to say that we were introduced to Andrew and basic through some of the folks who I hope will join us on the after school task force at some point in the near future, because they did a whole bunch of data collection and identified basic as an organization who's been able to do some things that we have long struggled to do here in Medford, including like essentially eliminating their waitlist but also

114
00:11:30,055 --> 00:11:39,166
radically changing the the type of programming that has happened, or that is available to students in his in those districts.

115
00:11:39,787 --> 00:11:47,797
So, the Dr. Galluzzi and I had a preliminary conversation with him just to understand, you know,

116
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,752
the sort of what really was happening in those other districts.

117
00:11:52,592 --> 00:12:04,320
And that's sort of where this consultancy unfolded from because I think, you know, he would have been very happy to come here and do the same thing that he has done successfully in other districts, which is to take this off our hands.

118
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:12,805
But that has some downsides here that, you know, in our conversations we identified as like maybe not in Medford's collective best interest.

119
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:28,616
But one of the things that I appreciated about the conversation was not just, and he didn't just have ideas of like what, of how we could do things differently and make a different impact, but instead he could cite specifically how he did it.

120
00:12:29,176 --> 00:12:32,038
And he seemed to have, and does have a really

121
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:43,477
keen eye towards implementation, which I think is something district wide that we have always struggled with, not just an after school but across the board so you know in in the conversation with him we sort of.

122
00:12:45,136 --> 00:12:48,617
try, you know, try to just understand what that program was all about.

123
00:12:49,458 --> 00:13:03,823
And then had some conversation about like, how do we basically have the best of both worlds, which is this program still belongs to us, but also like, it's expanded in the way that Andrew has been successful in doing in both Belmont and Maynard.

124
00:13:04,263 --> 00:13:08,685
And so this consultancy conversation came up in that context.

125
00:13:10,586 --> 00:13:34,679
I just wanted to thank the folks in the room who are maybe on zoom or maybe here with us tonight that have that so graciously introduced us to Andrew and this model, because it really sort of changed, in my opinion, changed the conversation that we're having about after school and finally has like provided some ability for us to break through what has been like just a complete log jam for a really long time.

126
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,224
Thank you, Member Graham.

127
00:13:38,244 --> 00:13:38,845
Thank you for that.

128
00:13:41,627 --> 00:13:49,355
So the next slide are our goals for the basic consultancy, which is expansion of the current elementary program.

129
00:13:50,118 --> 00:13:59,882
So increase enrollment capacity and decrease the waitlist, which will, which will include expansion of space within all of the schools.

130
00:14:00,782 --> 00:14:07,505
And then the second is to review new and extended after school programming opportunities, create, we are looking to

131
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:15,471
part of the work with Andrew is also going to be to look at what it is to expand in a middle school program.

132
00:14:16,372 --> 00:14:21,897
And so the first priority, of course, is the expansion of the elementary program to better serve the community.

133
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:28,825
And the other piece of this is to dabble into what it would look like to expand to middle school.

134
00:14:29,386 --> 00:14:33,712
And Andrew would be very excited to kind of spearhead and take on that program.

135
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:38,860
So those are conversations that are going to be happening throughout the year as well.

136
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:44,252
So the next slide talks about the Afterschool Task Force.

137
00:14:45,012 --> 00:14:57,636
And so the purpose of the Afterschool Task Force is to provide community-rooted recommendations and oversight to ensure equitable, high-quality, and accessible afterschool programs for Metro Public Schools.

138
00:14:58,336 --> 00:15:05,718
The participants on this would be, as stated, MPS caregivers, afterschool program staff,

139
00:15:06,558 --> 00:15:10,380
school building staff, central administration and consulting partners.

140
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:23,607
And I would say consulting partners would include Andrew, and I would say that it also includes City Year that is currently in the Missittuck and the McGlynn schools and will be returning for next year.

141
00:15:25,348 --> 00:15:29,791
as well as maybe others, but at least to start, it would be those two consulting partners.

142
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:51,786
And so some of the key responsibilities for this task force would be promoting community and family engagement and decision-making, helping to align afterschool programming and policies with student and community needs, to participate in the development of monitoring of program needs and metrics, and advise on resource distribution and communication.

143
00:15:52,998 --> 00:15:56,399
And so we're very excited to get that set and planned.

144
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,181
And further details will come as we go.

145
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:06,823
So our next slide brings us to Medford Public Schools commitment.

146
00:16:09,047 --> 00:16:19,110
I do want to say that we are very dedicated to growing this in a thoughtful way and making sure that we meet the needs of Medford families.

147
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:29,734
And so we are dedicated to expanding the afterschool program with steady progress for the next year and the next three years.

148
00:16:31,455 --> 00:16:41,545
We are committed to collaborating with the consultancy and with caregivers and with everyone involved to make this a sustainable afterschool program.

149
00:16:43,026 --> 00:16:55,198
And we are committed to protecting and leveraging the revenue that we do bring in to the afterschool program to enhance what we're offering.

150
00:16:57,502 --> 00:17:09,568
We do feel that it's beneficial to the community of Medford, and we really want to make a valiant effort at trying this before we would have a conversation about outsourcing.

151
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:25,973
And then we do recognize the critical importance of maintaining that local control, both on targeting the specific needs of our community within the program, but also to maintain some of that, you know, local hiring.

152
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,322
So the next few slides kind of break down those objectives.

153
00:17:32,662 --> 00:17:45,811
I'm just gonna talk broadly about them, but we will make sure that this slides presentation is on the Medford Public Schools website and easily accessible to you tonight or tomorrow morning.

154
00:17:46,512 --> 00:17:55,338
So just briefly, the first slide on program management just talks about how we are going to evaluate the programming, the staffing, the curriculum, the finances,

155
00:17:55,999 --> 00:18:00,919
and the space needs in collaboration with school leaders and

156
00:18:01,568 --> 00:18:13,254
Andrew through his consultancy so that we are building capacity, not just for school year 26, for next year, 25, 26, but also for future years.

157
00:18:14,054 --> 00:18:30,382
And that also includes creating a financial model, looking at the pilot for middle school academic support and implementing the strategies and the suggestions that come through the consultancy so that we are sustaining growth past fiscal year 27.

158
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:38,014
The next slide talks about a staffing, our staffing overview.

159
00:18:38,815 --> 00:18:47,842
And so we are going to assess how we're using city year in at the McGlynn and at the Mississauga, and we will partner with basic.

160
00:18:48,622 --> 00:18:53,905
in order to guide our staffing increases in all four elementary schools.

161
00:18:54,025 --> 00:19:01,250
But I just actually had a meeting this morning with the City Year folks in looking at what that might look like for next year.

162
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:12,817
And I don't have like specific details, but they're also broadening their support and really going all in on some additional

163
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:18,253
positions for after-school programming at the Missittuck and the McGlynn.

164
00:19:18,693 --> 00:19:20,114
So I'm very excited about that.

165
00:19:20,314 --> 00:19:37,999
Once I kind of know what the specifics are, I will relay those, but really leveraging that support from them and really looking at our staffing structures globally, but really at the Brooks and the Roberts to see what's needed that we can increase capacity at all four schools.

166
00:19:40,203 --> 00:19:46,108
Um, and we will be using the guidance that we also get from Andrew in terms of what that staffing looks like.

167
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:53,835
But we do know we will start that staffing this summer so that we are set to increase for next year.

168
00:19:55,496 --> 00:19:57,017
The next slide for enrollment.

169
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:08,247
Um, we have a valiant effort to do all we can to increase some of this effort by June 15th so that we can communicate that to caregivers.

170
00:20:11,098 --> 00:20:12,139
at all four buildings.

171
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:19,663
Additionally, we are going to work on implementing an automated enrollment system.

172
00:20:20,023 --> 00:20:33,932
That is something that we are working with collaboratively so that we can have a better system developed and that will meet the needs of the lottery because we know that that needs some enhancing and some communication behind it.

173
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:38,855
And also the guidance that we're getting from the audit.

174
00:20:41,749 --> 00:20:57,090
And then the next slide talks about our partnership so I have spoken a little bit about this in terms of our partnerships with with basic and Andrew, our partnership with caregivers and the task force, but I also want to highlight the part

175
00:20:58,422 --> 00:21:05,028
the current partnerships that need to be ongoing and extended through part of this work.

176
00:21:05,648 --> 00:21:10,272
And that is our current afterschool staff, that is our current school leaders.

177
00:21:10,913 --> 00:21:21,983
And so Megan Fidler-Carrie, who is on the call via Zoom, we have already had one meeting with school leaders about increasing space

178
00:21:22,683 --> 00:21:28,746
at all of the schools because that's going to need to happen in order to increase capacity.

179
00:21:28,826 --> 00:21:44,595
So those conversations on the school level are already starting to happen so that we can identify spaces that are sacred and spaces that are flexible so that we can kind of grow for immediate next year.

180
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:48,757
The next slide talks about

181
00:21:49,936 --> 00:21:51,385
overall the communication plan.

182
00:21:51,405 --> 00:21:51,445
So.

183
00:21:54,788 --> 00:21:56,309
with our director, Will Pippicelli.

184
00:21:56,369 --> 00:22:11,594
So following this meeting, one of the things that we do want to do is send out a survey to current families that are both enrolled in Medford Public Schools actively and on the wait list.

185
00:22:12,094 --> 00:22:22,098
And so this survey would ask for your interest, not for you to sign up, but your interest in

186
00:22:24,012 --> 00:22:27,314
offering another track to afterschool programming.

187
00:22:27,434 --> 00:22:39,740
So we would like to just get people's input, kind of dabble a little bit and see what the interest would be if we were to offer two or three pickup tracks.

188
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:47,804
Megan has been looking at some data with her staff from school to school around pickup times from this past school year.

189
00:22:48,984 --> 00:23:00,318
and to see what the interest would be if there are people that just need one hour of coverage after school so as you know our school times are changing and dismissal is going from 235 to 245 and so we we are

190
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:13,507
Between street data that the site coordinators and Megan Phila Carey gather from caregivers, as well as the pickup times.

191
00:23:14,287 --> 00:23:24,472
We do know that there are some families that just need care for maybe that one hour from picking up other students are getting out of their own jobs, some families may need just 90 minutes.

192
00:23:25,592 --> 00:23:34,859
And if that's the case, that is also another way that we can increase seats and capacity for the families that need until 6 p.m.

193
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:48,268
So that survey is going to go out tomorrow as another way that we can gather some data to see what is possible for implementation for next school year.

194
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:53,652
So, and in addition,

195
00:23:55,425 --> 00:24:09,950
just, I think, having a more aligned system for communication and true partnership with Will Pippicelli, Megan Fidlicari, and myself, that alignment you will see in communication moving forward.

196
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:29,455
And then I would just say in summary, we have a series of next steps so that first and foremost, is the support and collaboration with the task force and getting getting meeting number one on the books, because the support is appreciated.

197
00:24:30,296 --> 00:24:34,639
And we do feel that it will help to keep momentum in progress.

198
00:24:37,597 --> 00:24:54,687
And it will also bring some collaboration to this ongoing conversation and be able to identify people that really want to kind of roll their sleeves up and kind of dig into the work in those ongoing conversations and decision making.

199
00:24:55,468 --> 00:24:58,770
And then review and analyze the basic audit results.

200
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:03,414
So that's going to be critical to informing our work moving forward.

201
00:25:03,994 --> 00:25:20,069
And so looking at what the current staffing structures are what the new staffing structures are that we need to make an impact, and really looking at the data that Andrew through the basic consultancy is giving us, which I think we're, he's very excited for Andrew.

202
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:28,878
has not done a consultancy before, but he was really excited to partner with Medford in any capacity.

203
00:25:28,998 --> 00:25:38,567
So part of he has to work with his board of directors as to what exactly that will look like, but he's really excited to be partnering with us.

204
00:25:38,627 --> 00:25:41,390
So I think that's great for us.

205
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:47,824
And then that survey that I spoke about is an immediate next step that will happen.

206
00:25:47,844 --> 00:25:59,416
And then the updated communication so we will update the community on this presentation make it available on our Metro Public Schools website.

207
00:26:02,452 --> 00:26:13,537
carefully monitor all throughout next year as well, so that we're really looking at any shifts that are happening in enrollment so that we can keep clearing the waitlist as much as we possibly can.

208
00:26:13,557 --> 00:26:20,660
And then I do think it's important to note that we just finished a bid process

209
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:29,204
we were up for our eastern bus contract, and so we just finished that bid process.

210
00:26:29,264 --> 00:26:39,049
We'll have a little bit more information about what that looks like, but I do know that it's important to note, as part of that bid process,

211
00:26:41,450 --> 00:27:07,201
that myself and other members of the committee did receive messages over the weekend or even today from community members expressing their concerns about some of the current maybe miscommunication around transportation and specifically the transport from students to RSK STEAM lab for next school year.

212
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:25,786
So first and foremost, thank you for your emails because that allows me and my team to know exactly kind of what maybe communication you're receiving and so that we can appropriately respond.

213
00:27:26,606 --> 00:27:36,710
So I do wanna say that, but even though we haven't completely finalized the bus contract for next year, it's critical for people to know that we're not giving up.

214
00:27:37,805 --> 00:27:40,487
any of the buses we currently have.

215
00:27:41,528 --> 00:27:51,455
So right now, I just want people to be aware that we're making a commitment to maintain the current buses that we currently have.

216
00:27:54,053 --> 00:28:08,181
and then when we finalize that bus contract, we will have a communication sent out that clearly identifies that bus contract and what the process is going to be to sign up for the buses.

217
00:28:09,842 --> 00:28:18,047
But at that, I would be happy to take any questions or any clarifications that may be needed.

218
00:28:18,067 --> 00:28:19,148
Member Russo?

219
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:27,395
Thank you, I know this is early, so I do have some questions.

220
00:28:28,015 --> 00:28:31,757
I'm trying to understand how the early pickup helps with capacity.

221
00:28:31,777 --> 00:28:33,658
If you could just explain that.

222
00:28:34,018 --> 00:28:35,099
Yeah, that's a great question.

223
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:49,007
So if there are families that just need an hour to maybe an hour and a half of coverage, that could be handled in a separate staffing configuration, which means we could remove

224
00:28:50,838 --> 00:28:58,207
And I don't say remove, but we could shift those seats and open up those seats to families that need care until 6pm.

225
00:28:59,328 --> 00:29:10,021
And that way, not only are we hoping to increase capacity by adding additional staffing, and maybe leveraging city year differently, but if we're also able to

226
00:29:12,422 --> 00:29:24,191
use our staffing to handle just an hour to 90 minutes, then those those seats become open that we can also pull from the waitlist to fill those seats for the 6pm.

227
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:33,158
Okay, I'll wait till I hear more because none of that no offense that what you said made sense except that from a

228
00:29:33,721 --> 00:29:36,403
like in my mind mathematically, none of that made sense.

229
00:29:36,563 --> 00:29:38,505
So I will wait for more information on that.

230
00:29:38,545 --> 00:29:53,475
We have current, we do have some current staff, paraprofessionals, we do have some high school students, you know, we've also received other kind of anecdotal street data from people that would love

231
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,702
to, let's say, work in the afterschool program, but can't commit until 6 p.m.?

232
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:00,543
That's the answer I was looking for.

233
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:01,223
Thank you.

234
00:30:03,044 --> 00:30:06,365
My next question, how many people presently work in afterschool?

235
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,026
Oh, you would have to- Ballpark.

236
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:14,129
Megan's on the call, and I would have to probably tap her for that one.

237
00:30:15,109 --> 00:30:15,269
Okay.

238
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:15,989
Oh, she came on.

239
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:21,012
Hi, sorry, it's a little bit dark on my end.

240
00:30:23,077 --> 00:30:30,460
So I have a staff list that's 80 people, but as we've talked about before, it's not 80 positions.

241
00:30:31,421 --> 00:30:33,742
These are people we've kind of puzzled together.

242
00:30:34,002 --> 00:30:35,943
Some people work one to two days a week.

243
00:30:36,383 --> 00:30:38,104
Some people only work till 4.30.

244
00:30:39,664 --> 00:30:44,947
So there are 80 different staff members, but we try to keep a ratio of one to 10.

245
00:30:45,727 --> 00:30:47,288
adults, not high school students.

246
00:30:47,328 --> 00:30:50,989
The high school students are invaluable, but we don't keep them as part of our ratio.

247
00:30:51,509 --> 00:31:01,714
So if there's a 1 to 10 ratio of staff to students, depending on the number of students in the program, that's how many staff we make sure to have.

248
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,815
Thank you.

249
00:31:05,075 --> 00:31:06,836
Just two more questions, hopefully.

250
00:31:08,136 --> 00:31:10,337
I'm very much looking forward to the consultancy.

251
00:31:10,437 --> 00:31:12,658
How much are we paying him, or have we figured that out yet?

252
00:31:12,778 --> 00:31:14,559
We're still in the process of working that out.

253
00:31:14,937 --> 00:31:29,003
Okay, I guess I did have another question to, you know, my understanding is the magic bullet is that, like, I think I've been saying since I was elected that we pay them full time wages, they get benefits, they get retirement.

254
00:31:30,303 --> 00:31:34,145
And there will be lots of people to come out of the woodwork to do this work if we do that.

255
00:31:35,085 --> 00:31:39,187
So I, I'm looking forward to Andrew's very

256
00:31:39,693 --> 00:32:05,833
detailed analysis of our situation, but once we get that report, unless there's gonna be a suggestion to do something different here than they did in the other two districts, which was to pay people, frankly, reasonable full-time wages, which will be, I'm not gonna decide ahead of time, we can't do it.

257
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:12,306
But that is a staggeringly bigger dollar figure than we currently pay.

258
00:32:13,247 --> 00:32:16,389
Not just the hourly rate, but insurance.

259
00:32:16,409 --> 00:32:21,612
I mean, we have some staff, I'm sure, who literally work here because they get benefits for their family.

260
00:32:23,553 --> 00:32:26,714
So we'll cross that bridge when we get there.

261
00:32:26,815 --> 00:32:31,977
But I mean, I feel like I've been saying, if we pay people $100 an hour, we would have no trouble finding after-school staff.

262
00:32:32,438 --> 00:32:34,519
And I've been saying it over and over and over and over and over.

263
00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:39,391
And so yay, if that's what we're going to do.

264
00:32:40,232 --> 00:32:49,479
Because I do think that if that's the solution, which has seemed obvious for so many years, then I'm all for it.

265
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,363
Just in response to that, that is definitely part of his formula.

266
00:32:55,163 --> 00:33:04,551
So he does hire full-time, full-year staff because his programs do take on the vacation weeks.

267
00:33:05,707 --> 00:33:09,048
they offer programming during school vacation weeks, they offer programming in the summer.

268
00:33:09,508 --> 00:33:18,070
So part of that piece you're talking about, he does, he does respond to that by hiring year long staff.

269
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:22,070
So that is one of the things that we are looking at.

270
00:33:23,691 --> 00:33:30,952
You know, the quantity of how many we can handle doing that for next school year is part of that financial puzzle.

271
00:33:32,673 --> 00:33:33,573
But that would be

272
00:33:34,487 --> 00:33:44,296
you know, hiring a range, I don't know, of two to four full-time people is part of the discussion that we're having now.

273
00:33:45,477 --> 00:33:45,777
Thank you.

274
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:46,978
I'm very excited.

275
00:33:46,998 --> 00:33:55,246
I'm happy to see that we're talking about doing something that has been solvable, but has not been solvable for free.

276
00:33:56,427 --> 00:33:56,727
Thank you.

277
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,048
Thank you, member Rousseau.

278
00:33:58,088 --> 00:33:58,509
Member Graham?

279
00:34:00,053 --> 00:34:00,453
Thank you.

280
00:34:01,574 --> 00:34:05,078
I just wanted to also add, as I was listening to your question.

281
00:34:05,578 --> 00:34:22,874
I think one of the things that Andrew described like I think really actually when I spoke to him for the first time is there's just a huge spectrum of what after school means based on the particular program that you're talking about, and he, you know, he sort of said it goes from like

282
00:34:23,615 --> 00:34:27,756
warehouse to like highly curated, focused curriculum.

283
00:34:28,576 --> 00:34:32,317
And I think we're somewhere in the middle of all of that right now.

284
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:43,941
But I think part of what intrigued me about this full time staff is, he's not just he's not simply saying, I'm just going to pay you like you work full time, even though you work part time, like that is not his model.

285
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:48,882
But instead, his model is, I have people who are creating curriculum, and who are

286
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:56,328
curating the experience that improves the, like the quality of the program for part of the day.

287
00:34:56,348 --> 00:35:01,533
And then the other part of the day, their feet on the ground and with kids doing the work.

288
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:09,100
So it's a, there's like sort of a two hat role in there that we don't have today in that same way that I'm excited about.

289
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:15,805
The thing that excites me is like, once we can get past this hump of, you know, our intractable wait list,

290
00:35:16,586 --> 00:35:34,215
We actually have an opportunity to start to say, how do we plug the needs of our students into this model in some meaningful way so if we have kids who need specific help with homework, how can we create that we have kids who need executive function support, how can we create.

291
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:47,241
structures within this program to deal with that, not just for the kids who are like, quote, lucky enough to get a spot, but that there's enough spots that if you need that kind of support, you can have it too.

292
00:35:47,921 --> 00:35:59,587
And so I think it sort of, to me, it opens the door possibility beyond just like, do we have enough spaces for kids who need it to how do we extend the day in a different way?

293
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:08,272
In those particular ways that are meaningful based on what specific kids need, which we don't do right now we can't.

294
00:36:09,673 --> 00:36:15,697
And thinking about that as a possibility in the next like handful of years is like a really like to me a really big deal.

295
00:36:19,723 --> 00:36:33,490
also really appreciated Andrew's willingness to talk about this like consultancy model because that is financially not as advantageous for him and his organization as just taking our program.

296
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:40,953
But losing $2 million a year in revenue was just not something that any of us felt like was in the district's best interest.

297
00:36:40,993 --> 00:36:45,696
So I do think there's a financial model where all of this levels out and

298
00:36:46,856 --> 00:36:48,237
we can invest, right?

299
00:36:48,297 --> 00:36:57,581
And so I think creating this, this mechanism to be able to invest in increasing the quality of the programming is really exciting to me.

300
00:36:58,782 --> 00:37:05,825
And I would love nothing more than to be able to tell parents who are emailing me about after school that we have solved it after all these years.

301
00:37:05,885 --> 00:37:08,667
So I'm excited about that too.

302
00:37:08,847 --> 00:37:14,609
But mostly like just being able to really think beyond what we have done here, I think is really important.

303
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,150
And

304
00:37:16,424 --> 00:37:17,994
I'm really grateful that we're.

305
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:37,543
pulling the communication piece into this in a more formal way and saying to our communications director, like, we want you to be doing this communication piece because it's really high stakes for families and it's really an add on to what we do as a district or what our mission is, right?

306
00:37:38,264 --> 00:37:39,324
But it's critical.

307
00:37:39,445 --> 00:37:46,811
So I feel like it just has never gotten the attention it needs and deserves, the communication around this particular program.

308
00:37:47,355 --> 00:37:48,575
and we can fix that.

309
00:37:48,735 --> 00:37:50,756
So I'm excited about that too.

310
00:37:52,676 --> 00:37:58,018
And I'm happy to make a motion to approve this recommendation so that the district can proceed.

311
00:37:58,058 --> 00:37:59,318
I think time is wasting.

312
00:37:59,498 --> 00:38:12,741
So I will defer to my colleagues if they have other questions and certainly folks in the audience who I believe may have come to speak, but I would like to put a motion on the table to approve this plan to move forward.

313
00:38:13,241 --> 00:38:14,021
Thank you, Member Graham.

314
00:38:14,182 --> 00:38:16,002
Member Olopade, did you have your hand up?

315
00:38:17,633 --> 00:38:18,033
Thank you.

316
00:38:18,493 --> 00:38:19,794
So I had a couple of cool questions.

317
00:38:19,834 --> 00:38:22,795
I know we're at the very early stages, so you might not be able to have an answer to that.

318
00:38:23,436 --> 00:38:26,697
Does BASIC let us know about how often they're going to report their findings?

319
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:28,838
I know, obviously, this is a three-year expansion process.

320
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:35,822
I know that they have a certain set of criteria or metrics they use to determine how we are growing in that success pool.

321
00:38:36,182 --> 00:38:37,963
Have they informed us of what they usually do?

322
00:38:38,003 --> 00:38:39,904
I know it's kind of the first time they're doing this consulting.

323
00:38:40,444 --> 00:38:42,125
Is that anywhere yet?

324
00:38:44,486 --> 00:38:46,647
No, not to that, like,

325
00:38:48,456 --> 00:38:54,983
granular piece, the Latin my last conversation with Andrew we kind of talked about what those three phases of his work will be.

326
00:38:55,524 --> 00:39:04,834
And we're just in the process of sending him, I mean we had to present here, but we're just in the process of gathering the data he's requested and sending it to him.

327
00:39:06,155 --> 00:39:10,337
we're first starting out with a one year consultancy.

328
00:39:10,898 --> 00:39:13,559
And then I think we will have some decisions to make.

329
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:26,566
I think the monitoring piece he could assist with, but the next steps would really be around training and maintenance of our growing efforts.

330
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:32,029
So I can kind of get to that like granular piece and ask what he's using.

331
00:39:32,049 --> 00:39:32,990
That'd be great.

332
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:33,270
Thank you.

333
00:39:38,842 --> 00:39:39,343
Member Graham?

334
00:39:39,363 --> 00:39:41,126
Thank you.

335
00:39:41,748 --> 00:39:44,733
I did just have a question and it's gone now.

336
00:39:44,753 --> 00:39:48,019
I will let you know when it comes back.

337
00:39:50,486 --> 00:39:56,029
And I just want to say from the chair, I just want to thank you, Dr. Lucy and the team that's working on this.

338
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:57,590
This has been a long time coming.

339
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:00,611
We've asked for this for several years.

340
00:40:00,812 --> 00:40:09,416
I know on the city side, we are working to rehab the Hegner Center through a federal grant, but obviously that takes a couple years to even

341
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,573
go through design and architect work.

342
00:40:12,613 --> 00:40:20,776
So we are at, I'm just very happy we're at this point, and I appreciate the hard work that's gone behind this for something that's so greatly needed.

343
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:24,797
So on the motion by Member Graham, seconded by... I don't know if there's anyone online.

344
00:40:25,737 --> 00:40:27,378
Dr. Cushing, is there anybody with a hand up?

345
00:40:27,678 --> 00:40:27,918
Okay.

346
00:40:28,658 --> 00:40:28,798
Great.

347
00:40:28,818 --> 00:40:30,298
Seconded by Member Ntapa.

348
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:32,359
Can I just add something?

349
00:40:32,939 --> 00:40:33,920
Sure, remember Graham.

350
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:34,980
Thank you.

351
00:40:35,761 --> 00:40:47,327
My, my question is whether before the end of this school year we will see staff rate staff increases for their pay.

352
00:40:49,527 --> 00:40:50,449
as we normally do.

353
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:55,976
I know last year we just had like a weird snafu and I think that got left behind.

354
00:40:56,016 --> 00:40:58,700
So I just want to make sure we're not leaving that behind again.

355
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,281
No, we're not.

356
00:40:59,381 --> 00:41:01,264
That's slotted for one of the next.

357
00:41:01,484 --> 00:41:01,705
Okay.

358
00:41:01,945 --> 00:41:02,105
Yeah.

359
00:41:02,185 --> 00:41:03,187
Along with non unit.

360
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:03,707
Perfect.

361
00:41:03,747 --> 00:41:04,048
Thank you.

362
00:41:04,168 --> 00:41:04,328
Yep.

363
00:41:06,783 --> 00:41:07,143
Reinfeld?

364
00:41:07,483 --> 00:41:09,665
Yes, so I am strongly supportive of this.

365
00:41:09,945 --> 00:41:24,073
I have also met with Andrew and was very impressed by the work and seeing what's coming out of the community and really appreciative that this was able to move forward so quickly after the listening sessions.

366
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:39,336
My question is when we will see that proposal, that quote from Andrew and confirm that that's coming out of the revolving fund for afterschool, or I really want this to move forward.

367
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:41,837
And I think member Russo may have already seconded.

368
00:41:41,977 --> 00:41:50,000
I would, if not, but as the school committee, we do need to know what that financial impact is and make sure that it's not affecting families.

369
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,181
We have our tuition rates.

370
00:41:51,961 --> 00:41:55,663
So I just want to be financially responsible in authorizing this.

371
00:41:56,363 --> 00:41:56,804
Thank you.

372
00:41:57,665 --> 00:42:03,592
We already did the rate card for tuition so it will not impact families for next school year.

373
00:42:04,434 --> 00:42:06,356
And I would assume that is where it's coming out of.

374
00:42:08,198 --> 00:42:14,567
But I will, I have a note here to, to check in about the member all parties question.

375
00:42:16,055 --> 00:42:20,337
I will double check with him in terms of where he stands with his board.

376
00:42:21,658 --> 00:42:28,942
He's developing the contract in partnership with his board of directors, as this is something that's new for them.

377
00:42:29,542 --> 00:42:35,665
And so I will just, I have a schedule to check in with him later on this week.

378
00:42:36,706 --> 00:42:37,426
I'll find out, yep.

379
00:42:39,427 --> 00:42:40,308
Thank you.

380
00:42:42,172 --> 00:42:45,034
I think we're good from the body.

381
00:42:45,094 --> 00:42:46,956
So please name and address for the record.

382
00:42:47,876 --> 00:42:50,078
So Ada Gunning, 40 Magoon Ave.

383
00:42:50,158 --> 00:42:55,662
I just wanted to thank you so much, Dr. Lucy and the school committee for taking this issue on.

384
00:42:56,383 --> 00:43:03,207
It's an issue that, as I think you know, disproportionately affects women who are typically the ones that give up their working hours to be home with kids.

385
00:43:03,688 --> 00:43:05,389
It also stratifies our community.

386
00:43:05,469 --> 00:43:08,812
People with money will put their kids in private school for the hours.

387
00:43:09,492 --> 00:43:13,957
These are things that we don't even see happening, but we know are happening in our community and we don't even track them.

388
00:43:14,898 --> 00:43:32,256
And this spring I had an opportunity with a few other concerned parents to do a deeper dive on why other towns seem to be able to provide more robust after school programming the Medford and my single biggest takeaway was the culture and the investment and you know to

389
00:43:32,709 --> 00:43:38,774
to member Russo's point, like pay people well and you will be able to fully staff your program.

390
00:43:39,675 --> 00:43:50,303
And that's why I was really heartened to see that Dr. Lucy, you came into this position and you like really took this issue on right off the bat and you really listened in those listening sessions.

391
00:43:50,943 --> 00:44:00,131
Your plan incorporates a lot of our ideas and more importantly to the culture shift, you immediately started meeting with the schools, school staff, admin,

392
00:44:00,811 --> 00:44:03,692
And we're just really grateful that you were able to do that.

393
00:44:04,952 --> 00:44:09,394
Obviously, the plan isn't perfect, but your leadership is going a long way already.

394
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:16,857
And I also want to thank members Bram and Renfeld, who've been there every step of the way, really working on this with us.

395
00:44:18,357 --> 00:44:20,998
We, the parents who have been involved, will continue to stay engaged.

396
00:44:21,378 --> 00:44:26,560
We're really excited about the after-school task force and the direct channel of communication on this issue.

397
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,923
And just wanted to note that I also am looking forward to increased financial transparency around the after school program.

398
00:44:33,143 --> 00:44:40,707
I think that's an area where there's been just like a lack of information to parents that want to understand better where the money is going.

399
00:44:40,987 --> 00:44:42,028
So thank you very much.

400
00:44:42,328 --> 00:44:42,788
Thank you.

401
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:45,890
Thank you.

402
00:44:46,887 --> 00:44:47,287
Good evening.

403
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,528
Name and address of the record, please.

404
00:44:48,748 --> 00:44:50,769
Hi, Michelle Barkson, 23 Diane Road.

405
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:56,693
So I just wanted to say thank you so much for taking this seriously and putting in all this effort.

406
00:44:57,834 --> 00:45:07,340
I'm a teacher in another district, and I just also wanted to confirm that that extra hour or 90 minutes that you referenced would be life-saving for me.

407
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:11,742
And I was texting with two other moms while you were saying it, that it could possibly happen.

408
00:45:12,243 --> 00:45:15,305
And just that hour, even the one hour would be enough that I would

409
00:45:16,783 --> 00:45:18,424
help out many people.

410
00:45:18,444 --> 00:45:29,309
I think even particularly for people that maybe need the full six o'clock, but if it was between 4.15 care and then a little bit of TV versus nothing, they're gonna take that 4.15.

411
00:45:30,489 --> 00:45:37,953
I also just wanted to highlight, I think, I know you know this, I know you all have been getting emails and things, but this is such an emotional and difficult issue.

412
00:45:38,353 --> 00:45:42,075
It has already kept, my daughter is three, she isn't entering the schools until,

413
00:45:42,735 --> 00:45:53,085
fall of 26 I'm already up at night worrying about her getting after school my son is who seven has been lucky enough to be in one of the private programs, but that has been a roller coaster to.

414
00:45:54,006 --> 00:46:05,816
I know many families that have sent that are sending their kids to private schools, because they need the hours, and I know people who are considering moving because of how bad the situation is so I just really want to thank you for.

415
00:46:07,249 --> 00:46:08,371
making this a priority.

416
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:16,560
And Member Graham, I appreciated the way you were talking about how, you know, being treated with the urgency and the high stakes that is needed.

417
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:24,049
So on that end, I also want to thank you that it seems like the communication piece might be the focus for next year.

418
00:46:25,211 --> 00:46:37,640
as well as the transparency around the lottery, that is something that I would really like to ask that we're able to see the have the lottery be public, obviously protecting student identity, maybe it was to 90 numbers or something like that.

419
00:46:38,641 --> 00:46:47,107
But that we're able to see it because it's so high stakes and we haven't had really solid communication, some of us on the waitlist and things like that and it's felt as though.

420
00:46:49,498 --> 00:46:54,260
it's an afterthought or something, and it's like a life-changing thing for working parents.

421
00:46:54,660 --> 00:47:01,482
As you know, more and more, we have two working parents in our community, so it's really important.

422
00:47:01,622 --> 00:47:07,784
So anyway, thank you so much for your energy, member Graham and member Reinfeldt.

423
00:47:07,804 --> 00:47:09,605
I know you've been helping us with this all along.

424
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:11,486
We really appreciate it, and just thank you so much.

425
00:47:11,546 --> 00:47:13,426
It seems like we're going in the right direction.

426
00:47:13,446 --> 00:47:14,547
Thank you.

427
00:47:14,567 --> 00:47:15,107
Thank you, Michelle.

428
00:47:18,597 --> 00:47:25,276
Jessica Parks, 38 Corey Street, and I just want to reiterate what they've said, and thank you for coming in and.

429
00:47:26,201 --> 00:47:31,925
know, immediately jumping in in your first few months on the job and taking this on with the urgency that it needs.

430
00:47:32,486 --> 00:47:46,956
But also, one of the things I learned looking at other districts is needing to look at it creatively, and thinking that outside of the box to figure out how to get more children into our schools and aftercare.

431
00:47:47,136 --> 00:47:50,959
So I appreciate how you've kind of strategically looked at it.

432
00:47:51,259 --> 00:47:51,379
And

433
00:47:52,138 --> 00:47:53,079
I just want to thank you.

434
00:47:53,399 --> 00:48:06,048
And I also want to reiterate the need for kind of clear communication as we move forward on a maybe more regular basis, just so families know what to expect and when to expect.

435
00:48:06,068 --> 00:48:07,569
That's what I want to say.

436
00:48:07,609 --> 00:48:17,136
But I really do want to say thank you, because I think that it was, as you've heard, it's a really big concern in this community.

437
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,697
And I just really appreciate it.

438
00:48:18,737 --> 00:48:19,137
So thank you.

439
00:48:19,983 --> 00:48:20,403
Thank you.

440
00:48:20,503 --> 00:48:20,824
Thank you.

441
00:48:20,904 --> 00:48:24,507
Thank you all for being here to listen to Dr Lucy's presentation.

442
00:48:24,547 --> 00:48:26,369
And thanks again to the team working on this.

443
00:48:26,789 --> 00:48:29,792
So there's a motion on the floor by member Graham, seconded by member and Tapa.

444
00:48:29,852 --> 00:48:29,972
Yeah.

445
00:48:31,173 --> 00:48:35,517
Remember Russo.

446
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:36,598
Remember Russo.

447
00:48:36,899 --> 00:48:37,119
Okay.

448
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,721
Um, all those in favor.

449
00:48:39,741 --> 00:48:43,165
Oh, remember,

450
00:48:44,249 --> 00:48:44,649
Thank you.

451
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:50,974
Yeah, so I wanna thank the task force, people who just spoke, Jessica, Ada, and others.

452
00:48:52,015 --> 00:49:05,346
The deep dive into other districts I think was really powerful, partly because we were looking at that as inspiration and what could be possible versus all the things that other people are doing that we're not.

453
00:49:05,486 --> 00:49:08,068
It was really collaborative and open-minded.

454
00:49:08,408 --> 00:49:12,472
And on the communication piece, I just wanted to put in a plug for our family

455
00:49:12,972 --> 00:49:22,494
engagement and communication subcommittee meeting on June 11th after school lottery is one of the one of the topics on the agenda, along with some of the other family facing communications.

456
00:49:22,574 --> 00:49:25,194
So that subcommittee will be meeting in June.

457
00:49:25,474 --> 00:49:30,335
Hate to give people more meetings at the end of the school year, but it's important and we wanted it to happen now.

458
00:49:31,956 --> 00:49:32,876
Thank you, Member Reinfeldt.

459
00:49:35,456 --> 00:49:37,057
Does anybody want to call for the roll?

460
00:49:37,177 --> 00:49:38,917
Or is this just a motion for approval?

461
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:41,904
All those in favor?

462
00:49:41,924 --> 00:49:42,904
Aye.

463
00:49:42,925 --> 00:49:43,545
All those opposed?

464
00:49:44,105 --> 00:49:44,845
Motion passes.

465
00:49:45,265 --> 00:49:45,565
Thank you.

466
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:52,487
We have number two, increased flexibility.

467
00:49:56,168 --> 00:49:56,308
Yes.

468
00:49:57,529 --> 00:49:59,789
We have a long agenda, so I'm glad we took that first, y'all.

469
00:50:00,349 --> 00:50:04,610
Okay, increased flexibility for students, health and physical education requirements.

470
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:08,171
Again, turn it over to Dr. Suzanne Galluzzi, interim superintendent.

471
00:50:08,912 --> 00:50:09,552
Thank you very much.

472
00:50:10,726 --> 00:50:30,772
So in response to the school committee resolution, this report outlines the preliminary approach to Medford Public Schools health and physical education graduation requirements to increase flexibility and better support diverse student needs while also aligning with state and national standards.

473
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:39,537
So the report that you have in front of you just speaks about the current requirements right now are four years of wellness.

474
00:50:40,117 --> 00:50:42,840
So that's physical education as well as health.

475
00:50:45,404 --> 00:50:53,507
We are here tonight to recommend four years, so four years of physical education.

476
00:50:54,267 --> 00:51:08,612
So what would be happening, let's say for next school year, is that the freshmen would take physical education one day per week as part of their CTE rotation if,

477
00:51:11,617 --> 00:51:16,200
or their arts technology rotation.

478
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:21,864
Sophomore year, they would take PE two times a week as part of their regular schedule.

479
00:51:22,484 --> 00:51:33,612
I do want to pause for this moment just to say as this body and maybe many people listening are aware, we did through the bargaining with the teachers,

480
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:36,952
have changed the high school schedule.

481
00:51:37,132 --> 00:51:46,199
So we finally have a merged schedule that will blend the comprehensive and the career technical education side.

482
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:52,944
That schedule not only increases the day by 15 minutes, but it adds an additional period.

483
00:51:53,605 --> 00:51:58,769
One of the things that we're kind of working on

484
00:52:00,298 --> 00:52:09,565
Right now on and it's in it's an ongoing process is that we are seeing that in order to work the schedule for students.

485
00:52:10,689 --> 00:52:19,053
This year, and what many families are used to, is that physical education and health requirements are half the year.

486
00:52:19,534 --> 00:52:32,160
So they do, let's say students experience physical education, if they're a freshman, quarters one and two, and then they switch, and quarters three and four, they are in health education.

487
00:52:34,201 --> 00:52:37,043
For next year, we're not switching.

488
00:52:38,193 --> 00:52:50,817
Now, things may change as we kind of work this schedule and see how it's going for future school years, but this would have year long courses without flipping.

489
00:52:50,837 --> 00:52:54,018
They're not half year courses, they're year long courses.

490
00:52:54,498 --> 00:53:01,840
So as it stands right now, that's why it says once a week for physical education or twice a week as a sophomore.

491
00:53:03,202 --> 00:53:05,102
Juniors and seniors, their electives.

492
00:53:05,743 --> 00:53:21,586
So part of this flexibility would be some students may want to take an elective for physical education as a junior or a senior, but other students, if they are, well, I guess I'll get into the specifics in a minute.

493
00:53:21,906 --> 00:53:26,107
One of the other options would be to offer a wellness independent study.

494
00:53:26,367 --> 00:53:29,228
And I'll talk about what that will look like in further detail in a minute.

495
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:44,266
And then to justify the three years of health right now, what we do have and you would probably notice first and foremost is that health is not listed for freshman year.

496
00:53:44,587 --> 00:53:58,273
So there was a very robust ongoing conversation around what health would look like freshman year, specifically for students engaged in the CTE rotations.

497
00:53:59,912 --> 00:54:04,375
because we would have to, that is a critical year for health one.

498
00:54:05,515 --> 00:54:12,860
And in order to get everything into the student schedule, we would have to modify that curriculum.

499
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:22,465
And that is not what the educators and people that work so hard on that want to do.

500
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:26,748
So in order to maintain the rigor and the,

501
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:51,172
level of instruction for health one, the recommendation would be to put health one in sophomore year and junior year health two, which would mean that the electives are for health, which currently do not exist and would be created, would be in senior year or students could also opt for an independent study.

502
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:57,899
Now, what the independent studies would look like for the physical education independent study.

503
00:54:59,861 --> 00:55:17,132
The qualifying aspects of this would be students that are currently participating in, let's say, two seasons of a sport that meet the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association sanctioned sport.

504
00:55:18,613 --> 00:55:21,175
It would be for students that participate in clubs.

505
00:55:21,915 --> 00:55:27,780
physical activities like rugby or crew or ultimate Frisbee.

506
00:55:28,521 --> 00:55:40,752
And it also would include students that are enrolled outside of Medford public schools in like an instructionally based activity, which is a dance program or a martial arts program.

507
00:55:41,433 --> 00:55:45,877
So students that can demonstrate that, that's criteria number one.

508
00:55:47,207 --> 00:55:52,291
Criteria two would be that they have passed their physical education classes previously.

509
00:55:53,131 --> 00:56:04,780
And then criteria three is that they are completing a weekly log of their minutes of physical activity in these pieces.

510
00:56:05,401 --> 00:56:08,363
And then at the end of the year, creating a reflection.

511
00:56:08,843 --> 00:56:13,647
This would be monitored by current staff as well as approval

512
00:56:14,305 --> 00:56:17,970
through the director of physical education and health, Rachel Perry.

513
00:56:20,113 --> 00:56:30,546
And then similarly, to have a health education independent study would really be that the students are spending the year engaged in doing research.

514
00:56:32,352 --> 00:56:40,135
To a health related topic that they would be completing a capstone project for by the end of the year.

515
00:56:40,975 --> 00:56:49,958
And so some of those examples could be For capstone project are organizing, you know, some community events.

516
00:56:50,778 --> 00:57:07,972
or launching awareness campaigns or designing like peer tutoring programs, something that they have learned in health one health to that they'd like to learn a little bit more about, or an area of health that they would like to explore more dig into some research.

517
00:57:08,733 --> 00:57:11,616
and focus a capstone project on that.

518
00:57:12,077 --> 00:57:25,935
The criteria for that is that they have passed health one and health two, and that also would be monitored by existing staff and approval through Rachel Perry, the director of physical education and health.

519
00:57:29,385 --> 00:57:35,370
So if you have any questions, I put that forward for a discussion to the members.

520
00:57:36,251 --> 00:57:36,551
Thank you.

521
00:57:36,631 --> 00:57:37,893
Thank you, Dr. Pelosi.

522
00:57:38,373 --> 00:57:38,933
Member Rousseau?

523
00:57:39,634 --> 00:57:40,775
Thank you.

524
00:57:43,337 --> 00:57:51,444
Having been part of the HECAT effort, I guess I'm very concerned about delaying health one.

525
00:57:51,905 --> 00:57:55,088
If I thought that in 6th, 7th, and 8th, we were providing

526
00:57:56,287 --> 00:58:00,490
truly robust sex part of the health education curriculum.

527
00:58:01,591 --> 00:58:08,716
I might be convinced, I might be convinced, not even sure I would, but I'm not sure if we could say that today.

528
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:10,237
I don't know if you could say that today.

529
00:58:10,377 --> 00:58:17,422
I don't remember the details exactly, but there was an enormous amount we're not covering in our current curriculums.

530
00:58:18,283 --> 00:58:21,145
So I'm just concerned about the impact on students.

531
00:58:23,947 --> 00:58:24,828
You know, we already,

532
00:58:25,966 --> 00:58:36,232
here and heard during the HECAT efforts that by the time we're learning about this stuff, we've probably already all done it, which is not all students, but an awful lot of them.

533
00:58:37,853 --> 00:58:41,375
The point of education isn't to teach people something they already know.

534
00:58:43,717 --> 00:58:53,463
So I guess I'm concerned about this not, I mean, why not take away one of the physical education requirements instead?

535
00:58:55,269 --> 00:59:00,572
But also, yeah, I'm just very, very concerned about the delay here.

536
00:59:00,612 --> 00:59:02,293
And I'd like to hear more thoughts on that.

537
00:59:04,034 --> 00:59:04,334
Sure.

538
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:09,317
And I do want to note that Director Perry is not here because she's at awards night.

539
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:35,746
where she could probably answer, and Dr. Cushing is here, and I know he was involved in that committee, so he probably has much more enlightenment than I do, but the conversations that I was involved with, with Director Perry, with Principal Cabral, with Principal Fallon, the biggest conversation was around, in order for freshmen to do the rotations,

540
00:59:37,655 --> 00:59:40,537
there's, which is why you see for PE, it's just once a week.

541
00:59:41,197 --> 01:00:05,834
So the concern was taking health one and being able to do it, do justice to health one by only meeting once a week was the biggest area of concern, which is why they move, which is why they landed on really in order to maintain

542
01:00:07,172 --> 01:00:12,173
the diligence and the rigor that is in HealthONE.

543
01:00:15,074 --> 01:00:15,714
That's why Ms.

544
01:00:15,754 --> 01:00:26,056
Perry felt like putting it in sophomore year twice a week for the whole year is going to be better for the program the way it has been written.

545
01:00:26,076 --> 01:00:27,516
Mm-hmm.

546
01:00:32,654 --> 01:00:35,237
Yes, member Rousseau and then member Tapa and member Graham.

547
01:00:35,518 --> 01:00:35,878
Thank you.

548
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:44,889
Can you, I mean, we just went through this with the scheduling, but can you refresh my memory on the rotation?

549
01:00:44,969 --> 01:00:48,974
Like, is that like the first four blocks of each day or how does that work again?

550
01:00:48,994 --> 01:00:52,178
Because my kids took it before it was the current format.

551
01:00:52,654 --> 01:00:52,874
Right.

552
01:00:52,994 --> 01:00:55,875
I can tell you what it is right now, but next.

553
01:00:56,035 --> 01:00:57,596
So it does take up two periods.

554
01:00:58,016 --> 01:01:05,318
So in order to get through all of the students that elect to be part of the rotation right now, it's currently periods two and periods three.

555
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:07,659
Next year.

556
01:01:07,719 --> 01:01:10,280
I don't know exactly what periods they're slotted for.

557
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:19,722
We're still kind of building these the schedule, but it's still going to need two periods a day in order to get through the CTE rotations.

558
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:20,903
So.

559
01:01:22,365 --> 01:01:26,708
within that is going to be the physical education component.

560
01:01:26,728 --> 01:01:43,040
So let's just say, you know, students, if they're on a five-day, for their five-day schedule, they're going to be rotating through the CTE shops four days, and then one day they're gonna go to physical education class.

561
01:01:44,782 --> 01:01:47,784
Okay, I understand that now, thank you.

562
01:01:48,284 --> 01:01:51,747
So right now we are planning and have been

563
01:01:52,804 --> 01:02:01,369
The students get to experience all of the CTE programs, which is a noble thing to try to do.

564
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:14,517
If we add a bunch of additional CTE programs with a new high school or before then, we are going to run into, like, we can't have students just spend their whole freshman year doing CTE rotations.

565
01:02:15,937 --> 01:02:20,840
There's only going to be so many classes and periods to do this.

566
01:02:22,767 --> 01:02:34,874
I just feel like at the moment we've been able to expand it so they can take all of the rotations, which, frankly, it's probably a lot easier scheduling wise in the old way we had to pick and choose and then it was like first, second and third choices.

567
01:02:34,894 --> 01:02:36,395
It sounds like a nightmare.

568
01:02:37,635 --> 01:02:41,718
But once we've added more programs and there are not, it's not going to be.

569
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:45,460
We're not going to take away English and math and and

570
01:02:46,085 --> 01:02:51,007
and other core subjects so that kids can rotate through more CTE programs.

571
01:02:51,568 --> 01:02:57,791
So it seems to me like the idea would be, well, we're going to face that soon.

572
01:02:58,951 --> 01:03:11,357
So let's face that now and pretend that the additional health class is we're going to put that in and have to require kids to pick one or two of the CTE programs they don't rotate through.

573
01:03:15,002 --> 01:03:16,883
we're having them rotate through all the programs.

574
01:03:17,703 --> 01:03:25,226
And I just, I just, I have a strong sense that students don't actually imagine that they're interested in all of the programs.

575
01:03:25,966 --> 01:03:37,870
Now, I do know from hearing from, I think, I think number Graham's kid, like having gone through one of the rotations that would not have been chosen as a rotation, like it was incredibly interesting.

576
01:03:37,911 --> 01:03:40,972
And I think that's part of what education is for, but,

577
01:03:43,318 --> 01:03:49,203
but health education just can't be something where you're like, well, we want them to be able to try all of the programs in the CTE programs.

578
01:03:49,883 --> 01:04:02,593
So we're gonna delay what I think of as absolutely critical health education for post-pubescent students who are discovering themselves.

579
01:04:02,933 --> 01:04:07,537
And I just don't know that I think it's okay for us to

580
01:04:09,374 --> 01:04:13,778
It sounds like the other folks that have been consulted were saying scheduling-wise.

581
01:04:14,278 --> 01:04:15,899
And I think that's obviously very important.

582
01:04:15,979 --> 01:04:18,621
But scheduling-wise is not the whole story here.

583
01:04:18,661 --> 01:04:20,663
Not that I think they thought that.

584
01:04:20,823 --> 01:04:25,066
But I'm just very uncomfortable with this idea right now.

585
01:04:25,727 --> 01:04:25,967
OK.

586
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:31,611
OK.

587
01:04:37,196 --> 01:04:37,476
Thank you.

588
01:04:40,222 --> 01:04:44,406
So I can maybe give you my take on some of that.

589
01:04:44,426 --> 01:04:50,050
So I think just to clarify, students are in the CTE rotation for one period a day.

590
01:04:50,211 --> 01:04:56,736
So it takes two periods to get all of the students through, but they go once out of seven.

591
01:04:57,517 --> 01:05:04,663
So what they do now is, so it's different because it's a six-day schedule instead of five.

592
01:05:04,763 --> 01:05:07,865
So they have two blocks, and they go

593
01:05:09,178 --> 01:05:14,202
four blocks to a CTE rotation and then two to phys ed or health and they swap.

594
01:05:15,002 --> 01:05:25,930
So, when you look forward, they're only going to do that one so I do understand like the reduction of that causing some trouble with getting through the health curriculum.

595
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:33,594
So when I, but when I was thinking about this, I was hoping we could find flexibility in a bunch of ways.

596
01:05:33,714 --> 01:05:35,455
So one is in scheduling.

597
01:05:36,576 --> 01:05:41,378
The other is in some of these independent study options, which I think create options for kids.

598
01:05:41,498 --> 01:05:42,359
I think that's great.

599
01:05:43,059 --> 01:05:48,622
But I was also, I also think we need to think about flexibility in our graduation requirements.

600
01:05:48,682 --> 01:05:55,926
So this doesn't fundamentally change that we are expecting four years of PE and four years of, or three years of health.

601
01:05:57,393 --> 01:06:01,975
That's great, but it is well in excess of what the state requires us to do.

602
01:06:02,575 --> 01:06:17,542
And so I think one of the things that I would like to see us consider is to require perhaps something like three years of PE and two years of health and one additional year of PE or health, your choice.

603
01:06:17,842 --> 01:06:25,065
So if we're talking about electives, I think that's great because it can give students an opportunity to go deeper into something they're interested in.

604
01:06:27,287 --> 01:06:35,494
If you're taking an elective, you should get to take an elective of the thing that you want, not an elective within this particular bucket because it's a graduation requirement.

605
01:06:35,594 --> 01:06:40,719
So as I was reading this and digesting this, there's some pieces of this I really like.

606
01:06:41,239 --> 01:06:46,704
There are some pieces of it that I think we could go further in terms of creating flexibility.

607
01:06:48,125 --> 01:06:59,636
And I think the other thing that we could consider is that the two years, the two periods of PE, which would be health one, let's just call health one for the sake of simplicity.

608
01:07:00,497 --> 01:07:04,341
There's no reason that could not happen freshman year we now have seven periods.

609
01:07:05,342 --> 01:07:06,782
You can take four core subjects.

610
01:07:06,842 --> 01:07:07,783
You can take a language.

611
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:09,043
You can take a rotation.

612
01:07:09,063 --> 01:07:13,304
And all the eighth graders are like, what do I do with this seventh period?

613
01:07:13,744 --> 01:07:15,704
And they're just like sort of picking electives.

614
01:07:15,744 --> 01:07:19,265
There's no reason why that slot can't be used for health.

615
01:07:20,005 --> 01:07:27,066
So I don't think it has to necessarily delay health in order to move to some more flexibility.

616
01:07:27,787 --> 01:07:30,047
But I think it could be a choice, like if students

617
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:36,835
No, they have to take two years and there's something else pressing or urgent that they want to do that's fine.

618
01:07:37,896 --> 01:07:46,404
But I think part of creating flexibility should also be us revisiting what we are requiring for graduation if we want to create access and interest like

619
01:07:46,882 --> 01:07:51,746
Maybe you want to be a nutritionist or a public health professional.

620
01:07:51,826 --> 01:07:54,428
And so you want to take five electives in health.

621
01:07:54,889 --> 01:07:56,030
That's awesome.

622
01:07:56,430 --> 01:08:05,117
But if you have no desire to do any of those things, maybe your elective time would be better spent doing something musical or doing something technology oriented.

623
01:08:05,217 --> 01:08:12,503
So I think this continues to preserve this idea that we must have all of this stuff in health and PE.

624
01:08:13,003 --> 01:08:14,245
And I think the truth is we don't.

625
01:08:16,226 --> 01:08:28,531
I would like to see us amend this further so that we are creating real flexibility in a bunch of different ways for students, because I think that's what's best for students.

626
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:34,774
And I know that that's probably not what's best for the schedule right now, because I can appreciate the amount of work being done.

627
01:08:36,054 --> 01:08:43,938
But there is no reason why you couldn't use that seventh block, which, by the way, the eighth graders have no idea what to do with anyway.

628
01:08:45,085 --> 01:08:45,958
for the most part.

629
01:08:46,417 --> 01:08:52,282
to cover health elective if they want to do it on that seventh block.

630
01:08:53,783 --> 01:08:55,484
You know, everybody's got a different interest.

631
01:08:55,524 --> 01:08:59,707
Some kids are not interested in CTE, then they definitely could take health, right?

632
01:08:59,727 --> 01:09:02,730
They're not interested in that kind of a rotation, then they definitely could take health.

633
01:09:03,831 --> 01:09:06,453
So I think there are some other ways for us to look at this.

634
01:09:07,814 --> 01:09:14,439
I would be happy to amend this recommendation if that's what we wanna do tonight, or if we feel like we're not ready for that, that's fine.

635
01:09:14,986 --> 01:09:29,151
But my amendment would be that we are amending the graduation requirements to require three years of PE, two years of health, and one additional year at your choice, PE or health, which could include all of these independent study options, which I think are wonderful.

636
01:09:31,252 --> 01:09:33,312
So I'm happy to make that amendment officially.

637
01:09:33,453 --> 01:09:36,434
And if we're not ready for that, I'm fine with that too.

638
01:09:36,514 --> 01:09:38,134
OK, I know Member Ntuk is next.

639
01:09:38,154 --> 01:09:43,096
So why don't you go ahead and we'll make the motion after.

640
01:09:44,402 --> 01:09:44,582
Sure.

641
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:45,843
Thank you, Mayor.

642
01:09:46,523 --> 01:09:55,727
My first question, right off the bat, so what, I probably should know this, but what sort of defines a club team?

643
01:09:55,807 --> 01:09:58,208
Is it just anything not within MIAA?

644
01:10:00,798 --> 01:10:01,639
for a club sport.

645
01:10:02,519 --> 01:10:07,663
Cause seeing it's more of like the fact seeing crew labeled as club is what throws me off a little bit.

646
01:10:08,183 --> 01:10:10,085
Um, cause we have like an official crew team.

647
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:12,006
It has an organization that it belongs to.

648
01:10:12,146 --> 01:10:16,929
It's not MIA, but it's, it's more of a confusion thing.

649
01:10:16,969 --> 01:10:21,413
Not like it's not it, but, um, I don't know if I could answer that right now.

650
01:10:21,433 --> 01:10:25,435
I would have to do a little bit of research to get you your exact answer.

651
01:10:25,455 --> 01:10:27,717
I don't know if Dr. Cushing knows that answer.

652
01:10:28,257 --> 01:10:28,878
You know, that answer.

653
01:10:30,336 --> 01:10:31,757
what defines a club sport?

654
01:10:32,117 --> 01:10:34,638
Because like, I know that we don't have like an official rugby team.

655
01:10:34,678 --> 01:10:39,160
We don't have an official Pulse McFrisbee team, but like we do have an official crew team.

656
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:45,023
So I know that might confuse, I mean, it confused me, but it might confuse some members of the public of what that is defined as.

657
01:10:45,063 --> 01:10:52,087
Because I know like, I'm not sure if rowing is the only one that's not under the MIA umbrella.

658
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:55,008
I know that they're under MPSRA, not under MIA.

659
01:10:55,068 --> 01:10:57,630
So I'm not sure if that's what the qualifier is.

660
01:10:58,707 --> 01:11:00,428
But I mean, obviously it still counts.

661
01:11:00,808 --> 01:11:06,172
That's the big thing is it still counts under this because it's sanctioned by the school and runs into that.

662
01:11:06,192 --> 01:11:08,834
But I think it was just more of like a point of information question.

663
01:11:09,014 --> 01:11:19,541
I think it would be, there's been considerable talk across the state around two sports in particular that are going through MIA approvals that have come up for votes.

664
01:11:20,402 --> 01:11:22,263
I serve on one of the committees for the MIA.

665
01:11:23,043 --> 01:11:28,407
Those are girls flag football, which is a spring sport and ultimate Frisbee.

666
01:11:29,027 --> 01:11:40,035
Yeah, so I think those are two that all many high schools, I don't say all many high schools are considering right and that would be next in line for a club.

667
01:11:40,055 --> 01:11:41,396
I would also consider.

668
01:11:43,488 --> 01:11:52,934
I would also consider having worked in athletics with Medford for the last six years for crew to be considered more than just a club sport because of its escalation.

669
01:11:53,395 --> 01:11:53,575
Right.

670
01:11:53,615 --> 01:11:53,755
Yeah.

671
01:11:53,775 --> 01:12:05,562
That's where my, that's where kind of my question was, because I know that, you know, when we were under, when I was on the rowing team, you know, it wasn't MIA, it wasn't part of that, but there's still a sort of a state competition.

672
01:12:05,603 --> 01:12:10,326
There's, and it's technically two different sports in the fall and the spring.

673
01:12:11,816 --> 01:12:21,705
but that was sort of what defines a club sport and also what does that mean for students who want to pursue the, because I love the independent study option.

674
01:12:21,845 --> 01:12:23,006
I think that that's phenomenal.

675
01:12:23,827 --> 01:12:26,809
And I'll get into that in a second, but that makes sense.

676
01:12:26,829 --> 01:12:27,590
So thank you for that.

677
01:12:31,053 --> 01:12:38,860
So I sort of, you know, I echo the thoughts I think of my colleague member Graham in terms of giving people more of that flexibility and choice, you know,

678
01:12:39,582 --> 01:12:54,993
We talk a lot about purpose-driven leadership when it comes to the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility and students sort of picking that, charting their course, if you will, in how they navigate, you know, high school.

679
01:12:55,053 --> 01:13:00,377
And then, you know, if they pursue higher ed, you know, there's all these options of what you specifically study and all that fun stuff.

680
01:13:00,397 --> 01:13:03,580
And I know that we do it, I've seen the benefit to the,

681
01:13:04,965 --> 01:13:11,927
art school version of a rotation where you have students come in that wanna be two-dimensional, but then they end up becoming a glass major.

682
01:13:12,687 --> 01:13:23,590
And we've had discussions with our graphic design department and graphics department about students not realizing the full potential because maybe they're not done through that.

683
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:31,932
Maybe like this is what they're interested in, but they don't realize the benefit of like working corporate graphic design or working public in terms of the way that they're doing what they're doing.

684
01:13:33,605 --> 01:13:58,785
So I think giving them the more flexibility there, I would agree to a lot of that, those choices in terms of, you know, we encourage, you know, we still offer health or we still offer PE, you know, you know, for four years, but, you know, giving yourself that flexibility where, you know, maybe if you could use that time to focus on the arts or focus on some other things within the CTE program like that might benefit, you know, I know that I think,

685
01:13:59,626 --> 01:14:04,829
The way we used to do it was it was two quarters health two quarters fitness or.

686
01:14:04,849 --> 01:14:15,535
So i'm wondering if you know when we're looking at scheduling if we decided that you know, because I still think a health program in the first year is essential, you know there's a lot of things that are going on, especially.

687
01:14:16,168 --> 01:14:20,051
we've gotten talks about, we've gotten emails from students about mental health concerns.

688
01:14:20,111 --> 01:14:22,792
And all of a sudden you're in high school and that's a whole different ballgame.

689
01:14:22,813 --> 01:14:23,873
And how do you navigate that?

690
01:14:23,893 --> 01:14:26,435
How do you know how to sort of cope with that?

691
01:14:26,695 --> 01:14:39,544
And so even if it's as simple or I shouldn't say simple, but even if it's as, all right, half the students as first years, you go to fitness, half go to health and then switch.

692
01:14:39,564 --> 01:14:40,524
Cause I think that's what we did.

693
01:14:41,494 --> 01:14:42,915
when I was in high school.

694
01:14:43,075 --> 01:14:44,055
It's what's currently happening.

695
01:14:44,075 --> 01:14:46,176
What's currently happening, yes.

696
01:14:47,197 --> 01:14:56,382
So even if it's one per week for that, you know, like, or if people can choose to go on the track of, I mean, that might be even more of a scheduling nightmare of

697
01:14:57,140 --> 01:15:05,584
you know, they opt into staying for the whole academic year to be in PE, or they wanna do the switch, or they wanna, you know, just, again, giving them that flexibility.

698
01:15:05,604 --> 01:15:08,125
And I know we don't wanna create too, too many options.

699
01:15:08,205 --> 01:15:26,154
I know that that becomes then a logistics nightmare, and, you know, we don't wanna put a strain on our staff, but, you know, if there are students who, you know, are like, I think that I'm gonna go to college, and I'm gonna play football, and I wanna, you know, play PE, and I wanna stay active, and I wanna do that, because that's the course I wanna go, or even if they don't go through higher ed,

700
01:15:26,759 --> 01:15:28,060
whatever, you know, then they do that.

701
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:32,142
Or, you know, someone's like, Hey, I got a lot of things going on and I want to know more about that.

702
01:15:33,142 --> 01:15:34,863
Then they have that option to do that.

703
01:15:35,203 --> 01:15:41,947
Um, so I sort of echo the comments, um, about member Russo and Graham of giving people that flexibility.

704
01:15:42,707 --> 01:15:54,573
Um, and if you already have the expectation that they're both running for the academic year, you know, it's just a matter of spacing in terms of classes, you know, like their health is always going to be running and PE is always going to be running.

705
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:54,953
So then,

706
01:15:56,338 --> 01:15:57,718
or maybe I'm thinking about it too broad.

707
01:15:57,958 --> 01:15:59,619
I'm not gonna pretend like I understand what I'm saying.

708
01:16:00,839 --> 01:16:09,361
Then they can either stay concurrent with those two, I'm staying in health first half, second half, or I'm switching.

709
01:16:09,401 --> 01:16:12,502
So then that still benefits the plan that we're doing.

710
01:16:12,522 --> 01:16:16,703
I'm just trying to think more, I don't think holistic's the word, but trying to think more broad of again,

711
01:16:18,028 --> 01:16:20,269
we're getting close, we need to get the schedule down.

712
01:16:20,869 --> 01:16:26,231
What is the most creative fix that we can maybe pilot and see like, does this work?

713
01:16:26,271 --> 01:16:31,733
If it becomes a scheduling logistics, we know we've got to come back this time next year and go, all right, maybe we need to fix that.

714
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:43,637
But I think we do need to stress because it could be miscommunicated that say we take up member Graham's amendment

715
01:16:44,783 --> 01:16:51,573
three years PE, two years health, that doesn't mean that health isn't only offered those two years, that that is just the requirement, and you have to complete it.

716
01:16:52,034 --> 01:16:54,137
I think for arts, what is it, one year?

717
01:16:54,157 --> 01:16:55,499
I did it for four years.

718
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,405
I did orchestra first period every year, except for when they made it second period.

719
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:03,813
and Mr. Zegna got really mad about it, rightfully so.

720
01:17:04,133 --> 01:17:10,699
So they, like just making sure the public is aware that that is the case, that it is still being offered.

721
01:17:10,739 --> 01:17:12,680
We're not taking gym away for a year.

722
01:17:12,701 --> 01:17:13,982
We're not taking health away for two years.

723
01:17:14,662 --> 01:17:21,968
No, that is, and Director Perry, there's already electives for physical education, but she is working on expanding some of those offerings.

724
01:17:22,349 --> 01:17:23,510
And she is currently

725
01:17:24,337 --> 01:17:29,178
involved in creating electives for health, which did not previously exist.

726
01:17:29,358 --> 01:17:32,259
Well, I think that's great because, you know, I think, yes, they don't exist.

727
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:44,322
And, you know, we just had food allergy awareness week, you know, like, do we have a whole curriculum of health about how to deal with Narcan and epinephrine and all these other life-saving drugs that we don't talk about?

728
01:17:44,422 --> 01:17:49,483
Is there a health elective that is just life-saving medication?

729
01:17:50,204 --> 01:17:53,627
how to administer it, how to help someone in need, or how to help yourself.

730
01:17:54,688 --> 01:17:56,209
Is there stuff on sex ed?

731
01:17:56,329 --> 01:17:58,031
Is there stuff on mental health?

732
01:17:58,391 --> 01:18:10,542
It kind of gives it that for people to, for students to make that choice where they can have the option, but also to be comfortable with that option and to maybe, I want to

733
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:15,222
you know, high school might be the place to learn of like, hey, do I wanna become a psychologist?

734
01:18:15,242 --> 01:18:16,603
Do I wanna become a psychiatrist?

735
01:18:16,623 --> 01:18:17,324
Do I wanna go into this?

736
01:18:17,364 --> 01:18:19,045
Maybe let me, or sports training.

737
01:18:19,065 --> 01:18:22,247
Maybe let me take that health class on mental health.

738
01:18:22,267 --> 01:18:25,869
Let me take that health class on life-saving medication.

739
01:18:26,029 --> 01:18:27,210
Oh, I didn't really enjoy that class.

740
01:18:27,230 --> 01:18:27,971
Maybe that's not for me.

741
01:18:28,191 --> 01:18:31,073
That helps limit my horizon.

742
01:18:31,093 --> 01:18:32,634
Thank you.

743
01:18:32,654 --> 01:18:33,254
Of course.

744
01:18:34,035 --> 01:18:34,335
Thank you.

745
01:18:34,355 --> 01:18:40,339
If there's no further comment, do you wanna make an amendment, Member Graham?

746
01:18:43,742 --> 01:18:44,683
or did you talk to policy?

747
01:18:44,703 --> 01:18:45,884
Do you want to talk about that amendment?

748
01:18:46,464 --> 01:18:46,924
No, I didn't.

749
01:18:47,004 --> 01:18:47,505
No, go ahead.

750
01:18:48,085 --> 01:18:49,066
So, um.

751
01:18:51,008 --> 01:18:51,908
Great member.

752
01:18:51,928 --> 01:18:53,570
So it's going to read it for us.

753
01:18:58,153 --> 01:19:07,180
The motion is to amend the graduation requirements to require three years for P E two years of health and one additional year of either P or health.

754
01:19:09,722 --> 01:19:10,223
Thank you, member.

755
01:19:10,283 --> 01:19:11,184
So so this

756
01:19:12,185 --> 01:19:23,796
And Mayor member Graham, I think what I would ideally like to see is there's like maybe some tightening up of the language that could be beneficial.

757
01:19:24,636 --> 01:19:31,643
So maybe we see what this would look like both in the graduation requirements policy, as well as like what

758
01:19:32,203 --> 01:19:49,448
what this offering would be and look like for students um you know like at the next meeting or something so that there's because we just did a lot of changes and I want to make sure there's something cohesive that we all agree is the spirit of what we're saying um when we say we're going to amend this recommendation.

759
01:19:49,688 --> 01:19:49,988
Sure.

760
01:19:50,429 --> 01:20:00,932
Okay so motion to to amend but to not fully vote for approval tonight um we'll postpone till next to the next meeting which is in about two weeks with a

761
01:20:02,926 --> 01:20:08,310
time to digest and any further way you want to clarify it for us.

762
01:20:09,812 --> 01:20:14,395
Okay on that motion to amend by Member Graham, seconded by Member Reinfeld.

763
01:20:14,435 --> 01:20:15,916
All those in favor on the amendment?

764
01:20:17,177 --> 01:20:18,559
Aye.

765
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:20,820
All those opposed?

766
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:30,048
Okay that amendment passes and then motion to continue this for till our next regularly scheduled meeting to review and digest.

767
01:20:30,768 --> 01:20:31,509
Member Ntapa.

768
01:20:32,888 --> 01:20:34,369
So I might have missed it.

769
01:20:34,429 --> 01:20:40,913
Was that part of the amendment, was there the talk of looking at health being offered in the first year?

770
01:20:40,933 --> 01:20:44,455
I think that would allow flexibility, yes.

771
01:20:44,475 --> 01:20:45,015
OK, thank you.

772
01:20:45,335 --> 01:20:45,715
Then I don't.

773
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:48,737
I was wondering if I needed to add another amendment or motion to amend.

774
01:20:48,757 --> 01:20:52,079
But if it's in that motion, if it is technically ingrained in that, thank you.

775
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:56,922
OK, motion to continue the discussion.

776
01:21:00,034 --> 01:21:06,599
hopefully move approval on the plan at the next regular meeting by Member Graham, seconded by Member Ntapa.

777
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:07,400
All those in favor?

778
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:08,741
All those opposed?

779
01:21:08,761 --> 01:21:11,423
The paper passes to be continued.

780
01:21:12,064 --> 01:21:14,425
Next up, we have operations planning and posting.

781
01:21:14,686 --> 01:21:17,488
Again, Dr. Suzanne Galluzzi, our interim superintendent.

782
01:21:18,048 --> 01:21:18,729
I'll turn it over to you.

783
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:20,790
Thank you.

784
01:21:21,671 --> 01:21:23,192
Lots of papers tonight.

785
01:21:25,474 --> 01:21:25,774
Okay.

786
01:21:28,846 --> 01:21:46,875
So I do want to begin this presentation by first expressing my sincere gratitude to Dr. Cushing, our outgoing assistant superintendent for Innovation, Enrichment and Operations and Beverly Public Schools next superintendent.

787
01:21:53,291 --> 01:22:09,337
I'm very, very excited for him, but we do thank him for his dedication to Medford Public Schools and his leadership, especially around the operational needs for Medford Public Schools.

788
01:22:09,597 --> 01:22:17,940
And so not enough can be said for that because in his leaving, that is going to create a hole

789
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:30,991
that really we need to look at in terms of making sure we're still providing some oversight and some supervision and some planning around the operational needs of Medford public schools.

790
01:22:31,891 --> 01:22:44,682
So we have been having conversations internally to thoughtfully look at what that approach could be and how to better align the supervision and the oversight of the districts

791
01:22:46,003 --> 01:22:48,265
ever evolving operational needs.

792
01:22:49,245 --> 01:23:04,374
So what I have, if Dr. Cushing doesn't mind, first and foremost, what I do want to kind of frame a little bit is a restructuring of our organizational chart.

793
01:23:06,396 --> 01:23:10,138
And I'll just give one minute, of course.

794
01:23:10,158 --> 01:23:11,379
Oh, it's there.

795
01:23:11,539 --> 01:23:12,019
Thank you.

796
01:23:12,079 --> 01:23:13,280
It's hard for me to see over here.

797
01:23:14,936 --> 01:23:18,738
So what you can see in front of you is just what would be displayed.

798
01:23:18,818 --> 01:23:23,121
So there's lots of changes happening in Medford Public School.

799
01:23:23,301 --> 01:23:25,963
And so right now, Ms.

800
01:23:26,003 --> 01:23:37,169
Bowen and I are actively involved in the hiring process with member Reinfeld of finding the next assistant superintendent for curriculum and instruction.

801
01:23:38,130 --> 01:23:39,671
And what this,

802
01:23:40,631 --> 01:23:49,206
Shift would be would be the creation of a chief operations officer position to fill Dr. Cushing's

803
01:23:52,172 --> 01:23:55,996
roles that he oversees right now around operations.

804
01:23:56,456 --> 01:24:17,576
So this role would directly supervise and oversee and help to facilitate all needs under buildings and grounds, all needs under our instructional technology in the IT department, and the needs of the security and safety for Medford Public Schools.

805
01:24:18,618 --> 01:24:25,223
Of course, this role would have a lot of cross functional support.

806
01:24:26,684 --> 01:24:34,770
For other departments within the school district, but the main priorities would be around facilities it and security.

807
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:36,411
I do have here.

808
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:53,019
Um, a job description that I just propose, um, in order to post for what I would like to do, which is create the chief operations officer position.

809
01:24:54,280 --> 01:25:00,824
Um, I would pause maybe for a minute if you have any questions around that proposal before we talk about the job description.

810
01:25:03,206 --> 01:25:04,446
Thank you, Dr Galussi.

811
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:08,429
We all have the job description, um, in our packets.

812
01:25:09,390 --> 01:25:09,670
Okay.

813
01:25:11,647 --> 01:25:13,648
And I'm sure most of us have read it.

814
01:25:14,208 --> 01:25:16,769
If there are no questions, is there a motion for approval?

815
01:25:17,469 --> 01:25:18,210
Member Reinfeldt?

816
01:25:18,230 --> 01:25:24,552
Sorry, you wanted questions about the organizational structure and then about the job description?

817
01:25:25,312 --> 01:25:37,117
I just wanted to know if you had any questions around my thought process or the needs for the position before we kind of engaged in the job description, that's all.

818
01:25:37,437 --> 01:25:38,758
Just offering you the opportunity.

819
01:25:42,474 --> 01:25:44,875
No, I think I think my only question was around.

820
01:25:46,216 --> 01:25:52,119
Exactly how much is on the superintendent plate in terms of the finance communications and human resources?

821
01:25:53,799 --> 01:25:57,001
And I think that has previously reported to the superintendent, correct?

822
01:25:58,742 --> 01:25:59,042
Yes.

823
01:26:00,513 --> 01:26:04,236
And I think it's, I think that that part is okay for right now.

824
01:26:05,497 --> 01:26:09,821
I know, for example, food services was not a direct report to the superintendent.

825
01:26:10,521 --> 01:26:10,662
No.

826
01:26:10,722 --> 01:26:12,023
So that is a shift.

827
01:26:12,143 --> 01:26:14,465
So food service did fall under Dr. Cushing.

828
01:26:15,025 --> 01:26:15,205
Yeah.

829
01:26:15,826 --> 01:26:18,128
So that would be one shift where

830
01:26:20,254 --> 01:26:23,557
I'm, I'm putting food service under the finance department.

831
01:26:24,277 --> 01:26:30,102
So there's, I'm sure you're aware, like great overlay in a lot of that.

832
01:26:30,183 --> 01:26:40,632
So I would also be in communication with Director Smith, maybe around programming and communication where, you know, will also takes an active role.

833
01:26:40,692 --> 01:26:41,793
But in terms of

834
01:26:43,987 --> 01:26:50,334
The oversight, I have that department under finance.

835
01:26:50,855 --> 01:26:57,442
I think it's an understatement to also just, we don't know where we're headed.

836
01:26:59,144 --> 01:27:02,407
Right now, our breakfast and our lunch is

837
01:27:04,163 --> 01:27:07,465
provided by funding that we just don't know if it's going to be there.

838
01:27:07,546 --> 01:27:17,433
And I think there's going to be a lot of conversations that Director Smith is going to have directly with Director Velez.

839
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:19,940
Thank you.

840
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:20,140
Yes.

841
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:22,521
So one of my questions was going to be, can I see the org chart?

842
01:27:22,601 --> 01:27:30,163
So I'm really glad that this was provided and I've been trying to read through it while we've been right before the meeting.

843
01:27:31,004 --> 01:27:42,408
And so I'm also thinking about all the things that our new assistant superintendent of curriculum instruction is going to do, but having seen candidates, I'm sure they will be up for this.

844
01:27:43,068 --> 01:27:43,368
Agreed.

845
01:27:46,067 --> 01:27:52,010
So those, I mean, in full transparency for people at home that may not see the org chart, those are the other two pieces.

846
01:27:53,611 --> 01:28:09,880
Dr. Cushing had oversight of Rachel Perry for physical education and health, as well as Molly Layden for instructional technology, which would shift to the assistant superintendent for academics and instruction.

847
01:28:10,963 --> 01:28:13,446
Although, as I recall, Ms.

848
01:28:13,466 --> 01:28:16,929
Layden's position covered some of the networking as well.

849
01:28:16,989 --> 01:28:18,050
So there was some splitting.

850
01:28:18,331 --> 01:28:18,571
Yes.

851
01:28:19,592 --> 01:28:30,944
So the instructional component that weighs more predominantly for students will be the assistant superintendent for academics and instruction.

852
01:28:32,729 --> 01:28:43,233
but any pieces that kind of go into the technology aspects of like devices and things would be part of this COO position.

853
01:28:44,654 --> 01:28:46,195
Division makes sense to me.

854
01:28:48,496 --> 01:28:48,816
Thank you.

855
01:28:49,116 --> 01:28:49,516
Member Graham.

856
01:28:51,336 --> 01:28:51,696
Thank you.

857
01:28:51,716 --> 01:28:56,219
I just had two suggestions on this job description.

858
01:28:56,539 --> 01:28:58,200
Yes.

859
01:28:58,220 --> 01:29:01,783
One is under instructional technology leadership.

860
01:29:03,624 --> 01:29:04,844
The very last bullet.

861
01:29:05,625 --> 01:29:13,190
Instead of saying directly supervise the network administrator, I would just recommend that we say the district's senior it leader.

862
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:21,875
Because right now, that is a network administrator, but that is likely not to be the senior person in the future.

863
01:29:21,995 --> 01:29:34,843
So I just wanted to be clear that it's all yours, whoever this person is, and that the senior leadership of IT, as that department evolves, will report into this person.

864
01:29:36,444 --> 01:29:41,987
And then my other suggestion is under operational infrastructure and cross functional support.

865
01:29:43,208 --> 01:29:54,656
I would like to see this person be responsible for full implementation and optimization of our operations hero platform, which has been rolled out.

866
01:29:56,156 --> 01:30:08,921
and needs attention to really start to produce the kinds of benefits that we want to see from a facilities, maintenance, security perspective across the district.

867
01:30:09,321 --> 01:30:17,623
And moving from that, like trying to get out of the backlog of being reactionary and into a proactive maintenance space.

868
01:30:18,804 --> 01:30:21,705
So just to very specifically talk about that.

869
01:30:23,024 --> 01:30:25,267
that full implement implementation and optimization.

870
01:30:25,688 --> 01:30:26,049
Thank you.

871
01:30:26,069 --> 01:30:33,520
Remember, let's see who's next member so then member Reinfeldt.

872
01:30:34,922 --> 01:30:35,342
Thank you.

873
01:30:37,573 --> 01:30:50,604
slightly off topic, I guess, but if we do run into a situation where the funding is not going to come for free meals, this body did vote on December 19, 2022, that they'll be free and meant for public schools regardless.

874
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:55,528
So while I'm really hopeful this does not come to pass,

875
01:30:56,133 --> 01:31:01,956
If it does, it's not a conversation for the food services director and the director of finance and the superintendent.

876
01:31:02,656 --> 01:31:06,118
This body has to make that decision.

877
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:11,301
And so until we change that, it's free regardless of whether the funds come.

878
01:31:12,701 --> 01:31:21,126
Obviously, if that happens, we would need to understand what the impact is and make a decision, but just a clarification on that.

879
01:31:21,366 --> 01:31:21,806
Thank you.

880
01:31:21,906 --> 01:31:22,366
I'm aware.

881
01:31:22,466 --> 01:31:22,807
Thank you.

882
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:26,352
Member Rheinfeld?

883
01:31:28,016 --> 01:31:29,457
also have two suggestions.

884
01:31:29,818 --> 01:31:41,487
One is under qualities MPS is looking for, I would like the last bullet point, I would like the innovative leader to identify and implement both projects and processes.

885
01:31:42,268 --> 01:31:52,577
I think it's not just about coming up with great ideas for projects, it's looking at existing resources and synthesizing them into a system and also being able to execute.

886
01:31:52,617 --> 01:31:56,180
I know that's covered a little bit in execute sufficiently, but I think

887
01:31:57,538 --> 01:32:03,042
the new projects, both the ideas and the implementation, and that it's also about the processes we're looking.

888
01:32:03,482 --> 01:32:15,811
And then to the point of the org chart, I think it would be helpful to have a section around, actually, I think it's certainly the way I have seen job descriptions is supervision, received and supervising.

889
01:32:15,831 --> 01:32:27,199
I forget the exact phrasing, I can find it and get it to you, but the list of everything that will be supervised, because in reading this, my first thought is, oh, it's the facilities person, and that's it.

890
01:32:27,755 --> 01:32:54,347
but I think just calling out these are the areas, but in terms of actually supervising people, because I think that people management and that delegation is a really key part of this job description and knowing how big the team is, or at least how many departments are under the supervision is important for someone applying for it and doing the job, of course.

891
01:32:55,250 --> 01:33:01,512
Yes, no, thank you, because I did note it is listed there in the last bullet for the IT.

892
01:33:02,652 --> 01:33:11,315
Member Graham made a recommendation to change some of that language, but I am noticing that we need some tightening up under the safety and security.

893
01:33:11,555 --> 01:33:20,782
Yeah, and I think just synthesizing it into direct reports and that bulleted list is really helpful in seeing the job descriptions.

894
01:33:20,822 --> 01:33:28,387
I think we did that in the assistant facilities director of saying this person is responsible for custodians and I forget the whole list.

895
01:33:28,427 --> 01:33:34,672
I looked at it right before this and it has gone out of my head, but no confusion that way.

896
01:33:35,532 --> 01:33:35,872
Thank you.

897
01:33:38,554 --> 01:33:39,175
Member Ntapa.

898
01:33:42,298 --> 01:33:42,719
Thank you.

899
01:33:43,361 --> 01:33:45,126
Sorry, I stepped out for a second.

900
01:33:45,246 --> 01:33:50,921
But did we talk about what the salary range was going to be?

901
01:33:52,662 --> 01:33:53,423
We did not.

902
01:33:53,443 --> 01:34:08,656
Okay, because I do know I, I shouldn't say I know, but I'm pretty sure there's a new state law that we have to put the salary range on all job posting so I don't think competitive salary convention with experience will cut it I think they need hard fast numbers.

903
01:34:09,377 --> 01:34:11,639
So I just want to make sure we're in compliance with that.

904
01:34:13,222 --> 01:34:29,420
which I should have caught that for I think for some other ones we've looked at but I just am now hiring students for my day job so I know that I've had to put, you know, very specifically, this amount, this range of hours in order to be compliant with mass state law so just making sure that when we do.

905
01:34:30,041 --> 01:34:34,586
I know like you have here like bracket insert Medford public schools application portal I think that.

906
01:34:35,479 --> 01:34:56,428
Um, we just need to make sure that we have that salary range, however big it may be, you know, like you said, commensurate with experience, I think in order to just be compliant, we need to just have like actual numbers and we could be, we shouldn't do, you know, like, I don't know, like 80 to 160 K, but like that is technically compliance as far as I'm concerned.

907
01:34:56,448 --> 01:35:00,450
But I think like making sure we're as close as possible to what realistically is that.

908
01:35:00,510 --> 01:35:02,511
And then that I think has to come in front of us.

909
01:35:02,531 --> 01:35:03,332
I'm pretty sure.

910
01:35:03,352 --> 01:35:03,392
Um,

911
01:35:04,496 --> 01:35:05,997
So you're asking, do we have that answer?

912
01:35:06,017 --> 01:35:07,238
I would say yes.

913
01:35:07,318 --> 01:35:13,082
I mean, right now, in the conversations that we've had internally, that range would be about 100 to 150.

914
01:35:13,582 --> 01:35:13,662
OK.

915
01:35:13,682 --> 01:35:14,023
OK.

916
01:35:14,663 --> 01:35:14,903
OK.

917
01:35:17,005 --> 01:35:18,626
Good question.

918
01:35:18,666 --> 01:35:20,327
Thank you, member Antapa.

919
01:35:21,508 --> 01:35:22,128
Member Rousseau?

920
01:35:24,710 --> 01:35:26,932
Where does transportation go in all of this?

921
01:35:32,153 --> 01:35:33,594
Transportation right now.

922
01:35:33,614 --> 01:35:36,516
I know everybody wants transportation.

923
01:35:39,437 --> 01:35:46,681
Transportation is still a very, we are still having internal conversations around transportation.

924
01:35:46,941 --> 01:35:48,162
All right.

925
01:35:48,302 --> 01:35:53,345
Transportation right now lives with Megan Fidle-Carrie.

926
01:35:53,825 --> 01:35:55,827
It has had oversight by Dr. Cushing.

927
01:35:57,708 --> 01:35:58,028
And so

928
01:35:59,778 --> 01:36:01,800
That is still an ongoing conversation.

929
01:36:01,820 --> 01:36:03,421
I think... Sorry.

930
01:36:03,902 --> 01:36:04,462
No, that's okay.

931
01:36:04,562 --> 01:36:06,884
And where does Megan Fidler-Carey fit into this?

932
01:36:07,825 --> 01:36:23,919
Megan Fidler-Carey right now reports to me as the superintendent, but I would say that part of her role... Right now, Megan Fidler-Carey has reported to myself, Dr. Cushing,

933
01:36:25,665 --> 01:36:31,168
previously, you know, Dr. Edward Vincent, because she wears so many hats.

934
01:36:31,969 --> 01:36:47,339
So I think part of the ongoing conversations we're having around transportation is kind of what makes the most sense, because Megan Fidlicari is the administrator that is over transportation.

935
01:36:47,799 --> 01:36:53,382
She clearly needs support in that role, but I also don't want to

936
01:36:55,055 --> 01:37:16,611
pile so much on the COO position, because I think with the ongoing projects that Dr. Cushing has been very instrumental in starting and initiating and overseeing, those are still going to keep going on, as well as we're in the middle of the MSBA process.

937
01:37:16,671 --> 01:37:19,834
And so I'm hesitant to put too much

938
01:37:20,838 --> 01:37:27,620
in that position where facilities and IT and honestly, security are very critical.

939
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:43,203
If I may make a suggestion from the chair, I don't know if I can make an amendment, but maybe one of you could propose it, that you do have something in here, whether it's in the position overview or second section.

940
01:37:45,258 --> 01:37:55,909
because we see where your main focus will be for the COO, but something that just says, and any other job duties, tasks, projects requested of the COO.

941
01:37:58,372 --> 01:38:07,582
Motion by, okay, so that would be an amendment by member Tapa included with the amendments by member Reinfeld and member Graham, if all are in favor.

942
01:38:08,822 --> 01:38:20,574
just somewhere in there that so everybody gets overwhelmed everybody needs to take another project or another task that the CEO isn't going to refer back to the job description say sorry, not in my job description.

943
01:38:24,485 --> 01:38:32,228
I think to simplify the amendment just I think the simple line of and other duties as assigned by the superintendent so that way it is clear where that instruction is coming from.

944
01:38:32,328 --> 01:38:44,152
But, you know, that is, I think my job description even says like other duties as assigned, which is pretty vague but I think including them at by the superintendent of schools or interim superintendent of schools will be

945
01:38:44,792 --> 01:38:48,913
there's there's some basic language that's used on the city and school side.

946
01:38:48,933 --> 01:38:56,435
So you don't have to use mine or word by word, but you get, yeah, I think we're trying to get suggest and I think that's the basic language statewide.

947
01:38:56,475 --> 01:38:59,975
So I think, yeah, that's what we said.

948
01:39:00,015 --> 01:39:00,135
Yep.

949
01:39:02,056 --> 01:39:02,256
All right.

950
01:39:02,276 --> 01:39:07,377
So there's a, is there a motion on the floor for approval as amended by three members so far?

951
01:39:07,397 --> 01:39:12,318
Motion to approve is as amended by

952
01:39:15,610 --> 01:39:16,370
Thank you, Member Graham.

953
01:39:16,490 --> 01:39:19,011
Is there a second by Member Olopade?

954
01:39:19,372 --> 01:39:20,292
All those in favor?

955
01:39:20,312 --> 01:39:21,052
Aye.

956
01:39:21,272 --> 01:39:22,113
All those opposed?

957
01:39:22,333 --> 01:39:24,994
The COO job description has been approved as amended.

958
01:39:27,375 --> 01:39:27,715
Thank you.

959
01:39:28,455 --> 01:39:31,497
Now let's get the personnel on board.

960
01:39:33,097 --> 01:39:39,220
Recommendation to approve RICO five-year contract, Dr. Peter Cushing, Assistant Superintendent.

961
01:39:46,285 --> 01:39:48,106
Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

962
01:39:49,046 --> 01:40:00,992
Recently, in reviewing our contracts with the current office, it came to our attention that our RICO contract, which is a three year, was coming up for expiration.

963
01:40:01,992 --> 01:40:05,314
Interestingly enough, we actually have three separate

964
01:40:05,974 --> 01:40:13,059
contracts for lack of a better term with Rico, we have 55 devices on the current three year.

965
01:40:13,559 --> 01:40:19,543
And then we have the office copier for the main for the superintendent's office.

966
01:40:19,603 --> 01:40:25,367
It's a color copier on a one year and then a random nurses copier on a one year.

967
01:40:25,407 --> 01:40:27,089
So that's 57 total devices.

968
01:40:27,549 --> 01:40:30,731
We also have a device in kids corner that is

969
01:40:33,150 --> 01:40:38,031
For just a separate contract that was entered into.

970
01:40:38,611 --> 01:40:53,035
So what we're going to do is move to 58 devices in meeting with I recently had a meeting with The Rico reps Molly laden Anthony to Torah on our networking side.

971
01:40:54,183 --> 01:40:58,784
and a few other members of the district leadership team just to really review this.

972
01:40:59,545 --> 01:41:03,426
And to me, $185,000 was a little steep.

973
01:41:04,566 --> 01:41:08,307
In working with our vendors, I've always tried to extract value.

974
01:41:08,527 --> 01:41:22,671
If you remember last year with our phones, saving about $35,000 a year, looking at various other pieces with the security systems that we'll be deploying, saving significant money there instead of just sticking with the state contract.

975
01:41:23,171 --> 01:41:25,953
getting 28% value plus lots of free items.

976
01:41:27,574 --> 01:41:32,076
One of the things that we've been looking for with our photocopiers is device management.

977
01:41:32,537 --> 01:41:41,222
So we can completely move away from having individual printers, paying for individual toner, maintaining those devices, purchasing those devices.

978
01:41:41,963 --> 01:41:44,704
And one of our problems is printing confidential items.

979
01:41:44,964 --> 01:41:47,306
We'll be adding a solution called PaperCut.

980
01:41:48,683 --> 01:41:53,464
Papercut will allow our staff to scan directly into Google Drive.

981
01:41:53,684 --> 01:41:55,205
We don't have that option right now.

982
01:41:55,405 --> 01:41:58,785
It's a scan to your email and then or scan to a USB.

983
01:41:59,285 --> 01:42:01,246
So we'll sync up with Google Drive.

984
01:42:01,266 --> 01:42:04,467
We will also be adding e-faxing.

985
01:42:04,527 --> 01:42:05,987
We're going through demonstrations on that.

986
01:42:06,047 --> 01:42:11,268
So we'll be able to sunset some of the hard lines that we're paying Verizon for into the building.

987
01:42:11,668 --> 01:42:18,410
And then finally, along with this is, and I just had a brain fart, I apologize.

988
01:42:19,211 --> 01:42:22,460
Probably not what I want to say on camera, but it's been a long day.

989
01:42:24,645 --> 01:42:25,347
It's also...

990
01:42:28,118 --> 01:42:35,123
Oh, to make sure as we talk about a new security system, the basically the devices will be set up for secure print.

991
01:42:35,584 --> 01:42:47,813
So everyone's ID badge will connect through paper cut and we expect to see some school districts are seeing a 30% reduction on better average is about 20% reduction in

992
01:42:50,655 --> 01:43:00,057
paper, toner, all these other things that if I'm correct, are industry standards basically for anywhere outside of schools and schools are finally catching on.

993
01:43:01,298 --> 01:43:07,259
So the other thing too, when I was sitting with them was that 185,000 was a lot for a district.

994
01:43:07,699 --> 01:43:10,220
I like to see our money goes towards academic endeavors.

995
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:15,781
And so I leaned heavily into our partners to come up with a better option.

996
01:43:16,241 --> 01:43:19,062
So at baseline, moving to 58 machines,

997
01:43:20,662 --> 01:43:23,645
All right, our annual expense reduction will be $36,260.

998
01:43:23,685 --> 01:43:24,145
It's $216.

999
01:43:24,186 --> 01:43:27,749
So adding a machine and reducing our annual expenses by $36,216, or more than 50% of a teacher's salary.

1000
01:43:27,769 --> 01:43:30,631
Also, estimating other savings with paper cut up to $45,816.

1001
01:43:46,705 --> 01:43:50,128
I understand sometimes people are challenged with a five-year contract.

1002
01:43:50,608 --> 01:43:58,794
I think it's a fiscally responsible decision to move in this direction and recommend this to the committee.

1003
01:44:00,956 --> 01:44:09,762
From the chair, if I may, with paper cut, I'm assuming you need to make sure that we have good Wi-Fi and networking.

1004
01:44:10,302 --> 01:44:12,184
So is that come up at all?

1005
01:44:13,792 --> 01:44:24,681
They are wired, hold on, they are wired, but it is also something we're working on, a comprehensive look at our network solutions.

1006
01:44:27,484 --> 01:44:30,186
So, but Madam Mayor, you're 100% right, but they are wired.

1007
01:44:32,703 --> 01:44:36,746
And we wanna make sure that our network is extraordinarily robust.

1008
01:44:37,627 --> 01:44:39,068
And we're saving with paper cuts.

1009
01:44:39,088 --> 01:44:55,500
So if the network goes down in one school and you can't use paper cut for a while, it's not a loss or it would be, because I don't see a breakdown for how much paper cut is versus the fact that I guess, which is really good that we'd be saving 36,000 a year.

1010
01:44:55,900 --> 01:44:58,802
Yeah, paper cuts woven into the cost of this proposal.

1011
01:45:03,815 --> 01:45:04,496
Member Ntapa.

1012
01:45:05,877 --> 01:45:06,297
Thank you.

1013
01:45:08,218 --> 01:45:08,959
So I'm excited.

1014
01:45:09,019 --> 01:45:14,803
I'm excited to see the, that's the boring part, decrease in cost.

1015
01:45:15,204 --> 01:45:22,069
So on the state side, at the state institution I work at, we actually use PaperCut as a printing platform, and there are a lot of positives.

1016
01:45:22,129 --> 01:45:24,071
There are a few drawbacks, like you said,

1017
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:32,744
Internet goes down, what's good is that the way PaperCut works is it sends to all the printers.

1018
01:45:32,844 --> 01:45:35,446
So realistically it's because it's tied to your ID badge.

1019
01:45:35,506 --> 01:45:43,631
If you go to print to the nurse's office or on the third floor of C building or even in the Brooks, like it still goes through and you're able to print from wherever.

1020
01:45:43,651 --> 01:45:51,576
This is a no means an endorsement of PaperCut conflict of interest law, but because we don't use it, we use it, but it's not an endorsement.

1021
01:45:53,197 --> 01:45:56,279
What's also good is that we can set up specialized accounts.

1022
01:45:56,319 --> 01:45:57,540
We know where the money's coming from.

1023
01:45:57,560 --> 01:46:02,783
So there's way people can, if people hold multiple hats or hold multiple roles, you can actually assign different departments.

1024
01:46:02,803 --> 01:46:07,626
So when you go in and you go to print, it says like from a dropdown, like from a shared department.

1025
01:46:07,667 --> 01:46:17,353
So, you know, at my place of work, you know, I could say, oh, this is coming from student government, or this is coming from student engagement, or this is coming from housing and residence life, you know, wherever it will be.

1026
01:46:19,194 --> 01:46:20,895
So the only, I think, pain point

1027
01:46:21,808 --> 01:46:26,590
we have for users is getting used to loading money on.

1028
01:46:26,630 --> 01:46:38,636
So I'm not sure how that logistical work, but I do think that this is the, from personal experience of using the paper cut platform, I do think this is a good print management solution.

1029
01:46:38,696 --> 01:46:43,238
So I can put the motion on the floor to approve the recommendations.

1030
01:46:44,078 --> 01:46:50,823
If I could address one point, the biggest pain point that we see is going to be managing active directory.

1031
01:46:51,083 --> 01:46:58,228
And just those types of I mean, as you may see, keeping directories up to date on the website, things along those lines.

1032
01:46:58,648 --> 01:47:04,412
That is just one of the things, though, that is going to have to be sorry for the emphasis.

1033
01:47:04,472 --> 01:47:12,098
But as we move to a security system that is based on credentials, it's just going to have to be part of

1034
01:47:13,152 --> 01:47:14,713
the operations of the district.

1035
01:47:18,995 --> 01:47:21,376
Okay, there's motion for approval, seconded by Member Rousseau.

1036
01:47:21,796 --> 01:47:22,496
All those in favor?

1037
01:47:23,817 --> 01:47:24,157
Aye.

1038
01:47:25,798 --> 01:47:27,259
Roll call has been requested.

1039
01:47:28,079 --> 01:47:28,859
Just one other thing.

1040
01:47:28,899 --> 01:47:33,261
This is also a motion to send to the City Council so I can once again visit them.

1041
01:47:38,684 --> 01:47:39,244
Member Graham.

1042
01:47:39,824 --> 01:47:40,625
Sorry, was there a question?

1043
01:47:43,615 --> 01:47:43,975
Council.

1044
01:47:43,995 --> 01:47:45,936
Member right now.

1045
01:47:47,076 --> 01:47:48,717
You mentioned sending this to City Council.

1046
01:47:48,797 --> 01:47:49,377
How is this?

1047
01:47:50,337 --> 01:47:52,718
How does this fit into the budget proposal that we have?

1048
01:47:54,179 --> 01:47:55,459
We budgeted for $185,000.

1049
01:47:55,499 --> 01:47:59,040
So we're going to have some room.

1050
01:47:59,540 --> 01:47:59,821
Okay?

1051
01:48:02,902 --> 01:48:03,182
Thank you.

1052
01:48:14,663 --> 01:48:15,324
Yes.

1053
01:48:15,585 --> 01:48:16,846
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

1054
01:48:17,407 --> 01:48:18,048
Motion passes.

1055
01:48:18,088 --> 01:48:18,389
Thank you.

1056
01:48:18,409 --> 01:48:19,150
Thank you.

1057
01:48:23,115 --> 01:48:25,399
Recommendation to approve budget transfers.

1058
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:30,286
Mr. Noel Velez, Director of Finance, is coming on up.

1059
01:48:37,935 --> 01:48:38,895
Good evening, everyone.

1060
01:48:39,456 --> 01:48:46,958
In front of you all today, you have a request for 10 budget transfers, totaling $132,789.46.

1061
01:48:46,998 --> 01:48:49,879
Anybody has any questions, I'd be more than glad to assist.

1062
01:49:04,971 --> 01:49:06,473
Is there a motion to approve all the transfers?

1063
01:49:06,493 --> 01:49:07,154
Sorry, I missed that.

1064
01:49:07,174 --> 01:49:09,176
Okay, one second, please.

1065
01:49:15,022 --> 01:49:15,803
Yes, Member Graham.

1066
01:49:16,424 --> 01:49:16,724
Thank you.

1067
01:49:18,830 --> 01:49:28,076
Transfer number two, the comment says this budget transfer will cover the taxes and the number of employees given unemployment, which was larger than the budgeted amount of FY 25.

1068
01:49:28,296 --> 01:49:28,697
Yes.

1069
01:49:30,178 --> 01:49:37,362
Can you clarify which part is larger, the taxes or the number of employees given unemployment or both?

1070
01:49:37,943 --> 01:49:39,344
Both, they kind of go hand in hand.

1071
01:49:39,384 --> 01:49:43,006
So the more employees you have on unemployment, the higher your tax charges are.

1072
01:49:43,026 --> 01:49:43,086
And

1073
01:49:46,923 --> 01:49:51,271
I guess I just wasn't thinking that there was a huge number of unemployed.

1074
01:49:53,015 --> 01:49:53,315
folks?

1075
01:49:54,075 --> 01:49:59,478
Is it is it more that there's a bigger number of employees that are contributing to our taxes?

1076
01:50:00,338 --> 01:50:05,700
I just want to make sure I'm clear about the narrative of like, higher than expected unemployed staff.

1077
01:50:06,081 --> 01:50:12,483
It's a two part or one part is, we did have a few more who applied over the previous year than did two years ago.

1078
01:50:12,563 --> 01:50:17,185
And also, we the state of Massachusetts has what's called a four year look back.

1079
01:50:17,486 --> 01:50:17,646
Yeah.

1080
01:50:17,806 --> 01:50:20,527
So if an employee worked here two or three years ago, and

1081
01:50:21,436 --> 01:50:28,821
for whatever reason did not apply for unemployment and then chose to apply for unemployment within that three year span, we would still be held responsible for them.

1082
01:50:29,941 --> 01:50:32,583
So that is kind of, that kind of bumps up the numbers a little bit.

1083
01:50:32,603 --> 01:50:39,448
I mean, we, I feel that our, the business office, we try our hardest to look over the accounts every month.

1084
01:50:39,868 --> 01:50:47,433
And we work with Lisa over in the HR department to make sure that if there's any fraud, even if there is fraud, just so everybody knows, you still have to pay it upfront.

1085
01:50:47,993 --> 01:50:54,095
What happened is you hope that you win your appeal, which takes about four to six months, and then you will see that on the back end.

1086
01:50:54,115 --> 01:51:04,099
So there's a good chance that some of this was fraud, we put an appeal in, and hopefully we'll see that money anywhere between October to January of next fiscal year, sadly.

1087
01:51:04,439 --> 01:51:09,521
But it won't assist us this fiscal year, as we just want to make sure that we're paying our bills on time.

1088
01:51:09,541 --> 01:51:15,483
Because if you don't pay your bills, you're then charged a penalty and more taxes, which can raise the cost of any district even higher.

1089
01:51:16,165 --> 01:51:16,405
Sure.

1090
01:51:16,545 --> 01:51:16,906
Thank you.

1091
01:51:17,526 --> 01:51:17,926
That helps.

1092
01:51:17,986 --> 01:51:18,227
Thanks.

1093
01:51:18,767 --> 01:51:19,167
I'm all set.

1094
01:51:19,448 --> 01:51:19,788
Thank you.

1095
01:51:20,488 --> 01:51:26,253
There's a motion on the floor for approval by member Rousseau, seconded by member Reinfeld.

1096
01:51:27,074 --> 01:51:27,794
All those in favor?

1097
01:51:29,716 --> 01:51:30,476
All those opposed?

1098
01:51:31,477 --> 01:51:32,558
Transfers are approved.

1099
01:51:32,618 --> 01:51:32,898
Thank you.

1100
01:51:32,918 --> 01:51:33,479
Thank you very much.

1101
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:38,122
We have number six, rate card for MPS summer programming.

1102
01:51:38,142 --> 01:51:41,585
I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Suzanne Galluzzi, our superintendent.

1103
01:51:42,638 --> 01:51:43,238
Okay, thank you.

1104
01:51:44,700 --> 01:52:01,812
So in response to feedback from families in our four district run after school programs, as well as caregivers involved in the Memphis Public Schools literacy acceleration programming that we've been able to offer each summer.

1105
01:52:04,850 --> 01:52:13,874
I, which I have kind of in my previous role had oversight and facilitation of the literacy program.

1106
01:52:14,574 --> 01:52:18,075
And we've kept ongoing survey data.

1107
01:52:18,716 --> 01:52:21,357
We have tried different formats for that program.

1108
01:52:21,417 --> 01:52:23,057
We've offered half day offerings.

1109
01:52:23,137 --> 01:52:25,098
We've done full day offerings.

1110
01:52:25,138 --> 01:52:34,142
And so in all of the feedback that we gather from families, the need for a full day program

1111
01:52:35,170 --> 01:52:38,691
to allow for their work is critical.

1112
01:52:39,851 --> 01:52:54,873
And I think in where we're situated this year, we have, there has not been any grants offered right now through the Department of Education to help offset the costs of what a full day program is.

1113
01:52:55,853 --> 01:53:03,495
And so in that data that I have collected in my previous role and in the data that Megan Fidelicari is,

1114
01:53:05,463 --> 01:53:29,749
gathering continuously from the afterschool families, Medford Afterschool and Megan has designed a summer experience that will balance the needs of both families that are reflected in these survey results and to create a meaningful academic enrichment for the summer.

1115
01:53:30,869 --> 01:53:42,794
So what we have here for you this evening is a proposal for what we would like to do for an afterschool program to kind of fit all of these needs.

1116
01:53:43,574 --> 01:53:50,257
So what MAPS would offer is both a full day option for

1117
01:53:51,415 --> 01:54:06,753
families that are in Medford and a half day option for families that are enrolled in the literacy program that is just being finalized right now to help make sure that

1118
01:54:07,173 --> 01:54:19,380
not only are we creating ways to kind of be fiscally responsible, but also be able to provide families with extended care if they so need.

1119
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:27,484
So part of what is being developed is this program would prevent summer slide.

1120
01:54:30,022 --> 01:54:40,370
Because students would be engaged in weekly thematic activities and projects that would enhance academics and exploration.

1121
01:54:41,230 --> 01:54:46,635
So this program is being developed, Megan is having some ongoing conversations with

1122
01:54:47,375 --> 01:55:13,096
district administration, specifically curriculum directors, and she is also in collaboration with Medford Public Library, so that this program would offer, especially in the morning, opportunity for students that are not part of the literacy program to be engaged in summer reading activities, to be engaged in

1123
01:55:14,077 --> 01:55:22,846
Math Director Faiza Khan's math calendar activities as well as some extended academic opportunities.

1124
01:55:22,866 --> 01:55:35,078
And this program would be so due to a lot of the work that is happening HVAC related at the McGlynn and the Andrews

1125
01:55:35,658 --> 01:55:37,439
This camp would be housed at the Brooks.

1126
01:55:38,500 --> 01:55:50,187
In the previous years, the literacy program has been housed at the McGlynn, but we would need to shift everything over to the Brooks because they have space for both of those programs.

1127
01:55:50,948 --> 01:55:59,053
These sessions would, the MAPS program would run for the month of July from July 7th to August 1st.

1128
01:55:59,633 --> 01:56:02,075
And the literacy program will run from July 7th

1129
01:56:02,975 --> 01:56:03,436
to July 18.

1130
01:56:05,838 --> 01:56:11,043
Lunch, of course, is provided and breakfast for families if they so choose.

1131
01:56:11,204 --> 01:56:14,327
And then we have here the breakdown of what that would look like.

1132
01:56:14,467 --> 01:56:20,653
So the full day program would be from 9 to 3 with the option of extended time.

1133
01:56:20,734 --> 01:56:24,317
So families could drop off at 8 and families could stay till 4.

1134
01:56:26,976 --> 01:56:29,358
of course, financial assistance is available.

1135
01:56:29,878 --> 01:56:31,959
The literacy program is free.

1136
01:56:31,979 --> 01:56:46,510
And if families choose to extend the day for their children and want them to participate in the enrichment project based activities in the afternoon, then there's a separate scale for what that would look like from 12 to three.

1137
01:56:47,750 --> 01:56:52,354
And what the extended hours would look like if families are opting for that.

1138
01:56:53,440 --> 01:57:10,245
And just in lieu of any possible questions that you may have on the top of your brain, we are in the process right now and we'll be getting out communication around the literacy program to invited families this week.

1139
01:57:12,846 --> 01:57:14,307
Thank you, Dr. Galussi.

1140
01:57:14,547 --> 01:57:15,247
Member Reinfeldt?

1141
01:57:16,538 --> 01:57:16,898
Thank you.

1142
01:57:17,018 --> 01:57:20,901
So you answered one of my questions about the cost for the literacy program.

1143
01:57:21,722 --> 01:57:23,823
So two questions are you looking.

1144
01:57:24,744 --> 01:57:36,272
Is there talk of developing a math specific program which is another area of summer slide I know last year we had the grant specifically for literacy and so that's where our focus was, you mentioned.

1145
01:57:37,313 --> 01:57:42,619
the morning activities, but what does this look like for stem or math in particular.

1146
01:57:43,139 --> 01:57:44,741
Right, so I would probably.

1147
01:57:45,242 --> 01:57:49,366
So the difference is the the Medford public schools literacy.

1148
01:57:50,974 --> 01:57:55,856
is to just, it's what it has been for the past several years, right?

1149
01:57:56,656 --> 01:58:07,599
It's invite only because we are using district data in order to target the students that need that continual emphasis on literacy development.

1150
01:58:08,259 --> 01:58:17,602
And so we're looking at DIBLS data, we're looking at MAP data in order to craft the invitation list.

1151
01:58:19,783 --> 01:58:27,009
If I would much, I would really love to be able to be developing a math camp, a STEM camp.

1152
01:58:28,430 --> 01:58:31,393
Right now there are not a lot of grants out there.

1153
01:58:32,113 --> 01:58:32,373
True.

1154
01:58:32,654 --> 01:58:33,855
To offset any of this.

1155
01:58:34,175 --> 01:58:38,479
And I think these are things that we have to have conversations about building.

1156
01:58:38,499 --> 01:58:47,005
And I do think that was Megan's earnest attempt here in a lot of conversations that she had with

1157
01:58:47,826 --> 01:59:14,222
after school families and in the ongoing conversations she's had with her staff, she very much wanted to create a program that could not only target some of those areas in an academic way, but in an exploration enrichment way, but also to assist families and maybe take that piece off their plate so that if they are working all day, they don't have to fight with their

1158
01:59:15,010 --> 01:59:41,787
children about doing their summer reading and working on some of the math calendars that Director Kahn puts out, while also creating a theme for each week and having some kind of project-based opportunities for students to engage in, and maybe some walking field trips to continue that exploration.

1159
01:59:43,582 --> 01:59:46,423
It's in my, if I had a gene in a bottle.

1160
01:59:46,443 --> 01:59:48,644
Just curious about big picture long-term.

1161
01:59:48,764 --> 01:59:52,886
So that actually splits my second question into two questions.

1162
01:59:53,146 --> 01:59:56,228
So just to confirm, so this is for elementary families?

1163
01:59:56,588 --> 01:59:56,828
Yes.

1164
01:59:57,368 --> 02:00:02,391
And the MAPS program is anyone, any elementary family in Medford or?

1165
02:00:02,451 --> 02:00:04,852
Yes, yes, two rising grade six.

1166
02:00:05,332 --> 02:00:05,592
Okay.

1167
02:00:06,473 --> 02:00:06,773
And then,

1168
02:00:08,034 --> 02:00:22,716
The thing when I when I saw this I went, how does this stack up we have we approved a summer fund program, which is significantly cheaper than than this for families, I hear that this is academically and enrichment focused.

1169
02:00:23,216 --> 02:00:28,859
And so I'm hoping you can explain a little bit about how this fits into the broader summer offerings.

1170
02:00:29,739 --> 02:00:37,163
And then with an eye towards the future we talked when we approved summer fun about rolling out all of our summer programs at the same time.

1171
02:00:37,183 --> 02:00:41,926
So I would like to see that in the future and I think you know that but I wanted it on record but.

1172
02:00:43,226 --> 02:00:57,412
Could you put this in the context of the other summer opportunities in Medford, because the price difference is significant and I understand the staffing is different and the curriculum development is different, but it would be really helpful to hear what makes this

1173
02:00:59,446 --> 02:01:03,547
an important part of our summer portfolio when we have summer fun as well.

1174
02:01:03,827 --> 02:01:03,987
Yep.

1175
02:01:04,628 --> 02:01:21,433
So first I would say that some of the delay is on me completely because I'm always so far in order to provide the literacy programs in the summer.

1176
02:01:22,155 --> 02:01:34,887
I have we have been using and relying on some desi grant funding to offset that and they're typically around this time of year that they're offering them and so I.

1177
02:01:37,512 --> 02:01:41,776
I have to get better at like moving up that timeline, even despite.

1178
02:01:42,197 --> 02:01:45,199
So this year I was hoping that that would still be the case.

1179
02:01:45,319 --> 02:01:45,820
It's not.

1180
02:01:46,461 --> 02:01:55,349
And so I think we have to just make a better effort to be more time efficient with with rolling these out, but knowing that

1181
02:01:56,692 --> 02:02:10,895
that the grants weren't a possibility and having conversations ongoing with Megan, this seemed to be an opportunity to, A, not overtax Summer Fun.

1182
02:02:11,175 --> 02:02:13,116
There's a lot happening at the Missituck.

1183
02:02:14,776 --> 02:02:22,318
So Summer Fun is housed there, the EL program is housed there, there is some ESY housed there, and much how

1184
02:02:23,995 --> 02:02:36,497
our EL students and our students with disabilities are able to have their services, but also have some social time in summer fun without overtaxing that program.

1185
02:02:37,058 --> 02:02:48,520
This was a way to maybe infuse some more academic focused explorations in a camp.

1186
02:02:50,329 --> 02:03:01,233
but also be able to provide families that are attending the reading, the literacy camp with childcare opportunities.

1187
02:03:01,953 --> 02:03:10,036
And so it kind of evolved from both need and the desire to maybe help with

1188
02:03:11,658 --> 02:03:13,258
like the reduction of summer slide.

1189
02:03:14,159 --> 02:03:17,600
So the difference in price is $100 more.

1190
02:03:18,460 --> 02:03:22,221
So summer fund is 250 a week, this is 350 a week.

1191
02:03:23,581 --> 02:03:29,162
There is an increase in that and that is really to just account for staffing needs.

1192
02:03:31,243 --> 02:03:34,564
cannot maybe sit here and go through all of the staffing needs of summer fun.

1193
02:03:35,304 --> 02:03:47,528
Um, verse this maps program, but a lot of the staffing that Megan Fidler Carrie is using to support this initiative is her existing staff.

1194
02:03:48,689 --> 02:04:00,353
Um, and I think that accounts for for for some of the increase as well as the supplies because of the

1195
02:04:01,558 --> 02:04:10,355
because of the thematic nature and the academic component in order to do some of the STEM related activities, the materials.

1196
02:04:14,260 --> 02:04:23,970
are, I don't want to say pricey, but they're just probably, they cost a certain amount of money that we have to make sure that we are accounting for.

1197
02:04:23,990 --> 02:04:28,115
And then are there accommodations for special education services?

1198
02:04:28,295 --> 02:04:28,555
Yes.

1199
02:04:28,835 --> 02:04:31,418
The same one-on-one support that we needed.

1200
02:04:31,438 --> 02:04:32,039
I'm sorry.

1201
02:04:32,399 --> 02:04:36,643
Oh no, one-on-one support that's needed, aids to facilitate

1202
02:04:37,967 --> 02:04:38,488
Absolutely.

1203
02:04:39,349 --> 02:04:39,489
Yep.

1204
02:04:39,949 --> 02:04:43,994
And the sliding scale that's used for the afterschool program would be in place for this.

1205
02:04:44,495 --> 02:04:44,835
Thank you.

1206
02:04:48,439 --> 02:04:49,060
Member Graham.

1207
02:04:50,273 --> 02:04:50,633
Thank you.

1208
02:04:50,653 --> 02:04:55,357
I guess two comments or questions.

1209
02:04:55,557 --> 02:05:05,346
One is, when we communicate about this, can we tighten up the communication that previously went out about this topic?

1210
02:05:05,406 --> 02:05:09,669
Because that communication generated more questions than

1211
02:05:10,850 --> 02:05:11,231
answers.

1212
02:05:11,992 --> 02:05:20,443
And I think this is like sort of late in the game so I think addressing questions like, what if I already registered for summer fun camp and I want to do this instead is that allowed.

1213
02:05:20,463 --> 02:05:26,532
I think we just need to like contextualize that this is, this is an academic offering that

1214
02:05:27,733 --> 02:05:35,839
we are providing sort of based on the availability of this grant and that is part of why this is happening at this point in the year.

1215
02:05:37,140 --> 02:05:48,387
So if we could just make sure that communication is really tight and clear so we don't create confusion or an idea that this is a better camp than summer fun.

1216
02:05:48,608 --> 02:05:52,010
I think they are different and they're intended to be so but I think we need to

1217
02:05:52,568 --> 02:05:55,292
articulate that when we communicate about it.

1218
02:05:55,312 --> 02:05:56,975
So that would be one request.

1219
02:05:57,535 --> 02:06:00,860
And the other request I have is that as we start working on

1220
02:06:02,410 --> 02:06:18,106
slushing out the work that we're going to do with basic around after school is that we get a cohesive out of school time program put together, where we can think about things like could both of these things have happened in the same place.

1221
02:06:19,067 --> 02:06:25,814
I know right this year that's not possible for all the reasons which is fine because of the HVAC project but are there, you know,

1222
02:06:27,021 --> 02:06:40,745
What should a portfolio of summer programs look like that would maybe support some of the costs around the academic enrichment or additional academic support?

1223
02:06:41,165 --> 02:06:48,847
Can these programs start to fund that for us so we are less reliant on grants and more reliant on a self-funding program that can do that?

1224
02:06:49,827 --> 02:06:51,248
So that's like a next year thing.

1225
02:06:51,328 --> 02:07:01,593
But as we talk about after school and what's possible, I would also like some of these programs to be a little bit less like haphazard around the district and a little bit more cohesive.

1226
02:07:04,174 --> 02:07:04,594
I agree.

1227
02:07:04,955 --> 02:07:05,255
Thank you.

1228
02:07:05,295 --> 02:07:05,755
Very fair.

1229
02:07:05,855 --> 02:07:06,235
Thank you.

1230
02:07:07,076 --> 02:07:08,056
And motion to approve.

1231
02:07:10,037 --> 02:07:14,979
There's a motion for approval on the floor, seconded by Member Opade.

1232
02:07:15,020 --> 02:07:15,840
All those in favor?

1233
02:07:16,720 --> 02:07:17,461
All those opposed?

1234
02:07:18,503 --> 02:07:19,244
Paper passes.

1235
02:07:22,986 --> 02:07:29,131
We do not have any presentations of the public or continued business, but we do have new business.

1236
02:07:29,231 --> 02:07:34,014
We have the first reading of policy JJIF, concussion policy 2025-18.

1237
02:07:34,034 --> 02:07:39,498
The purpose of the policy, member Reinfeld?

1238
02:07:42,428 --> 02:07:43,289
I'm not sure if I'm allowed to do that.

1239
02:07:43,309 --> 02:07:44,950
I think the purpose of the meeting of some of these details.

1240
02:07:44,970 --> 02:07:45,650
It's a very long policy.

1241
02:07:45,670 --> 02:07:48,733
I don't know if I'm allowed to do that if we have to Okay.

1242
02:07:49,573 --> 02:07:51,355
I think the purpose is useful and.

1243
02:07:52,856 --> 02:07:55,037
Motion to waive the reading by

1244
02:08:01,270 --> 02:08:02,071
of those opposed.

1245
02:08:03,231 --> 02:08:07,675
Motion to waive the reading, because it is about 10 pages, has been approved.

1246
02:08:08,495 --> 02:08:13,239
And this is a concussion policy pre-participation.

1247
02:08:14,260 --> 02:08:21,185
It outlines pre-participation requirements and training, caregiver requirements, exclusion from play.

1248
02:08:23,247 --> 02:08:37,416
It outlines when one can return to play, athletic director responsibilities, athletic trainer responsibilities, coach responsibilities, school nurse responsibilities, record maintenance.

1249
02:08:39,417 --> 02:08:47,142
And I'm sure it's posted on both the city and the school calendars in the attached agenda link if anybody wants to review it.

1250
02:08:51,743 --> 02:08:57,908
I recently got to go through this with my daughter, so it's good that we have a protocol.

1251
02:08:58,048 --> 02:08:59,149
Member Graham.

1252
02:09:00,951 --> 02:09:01,391
Thank you.

1253
02:09:01,511 --> 02:09:04,053
I was just curious, is this a replace?

1254
02:09:04,394 --> 02:09:07,096
I'm not sure where this came from or who suggested it.

1255
02:09:08,177 --> 02:09:09,137
Is it a replacement?

1256
02:09:09,157 --> 02:09:09,918
What's changed?

1257
02:09:09,978 --> 02:09:11,279
If that would be helpful.

1258
02:09:12,360 --> 02:09:13,481
Great questions.

1259
02:09:15,483 --> 02:09:16,964
Dr. Cushing, did you want to answer?

1260
02:09:18,405 --> 02:09:19,286
Oh, Member Rousseau?

1261
02:09:21,832 --> 02:09:32,297
Yes, I put this forward, I noticed actually just now that it doesn't say who put it forward, but, and Dr. Cushing will probably remember better than me why I did that.

1262
02:09:33,498 --> 02:09:36,719
Sorry, it was a lot of work, but I suddenly forget why.

1263
02:09:36,739 --> 02:09:39,921
Not because I have a concussion.

1264
02:09:40,201 --> 02:09:41,802
I don't have a concussion, I promise.

1265
02:09:42,402 --> 02:09:44,463
So as I've always been about transparency,

1266
02:09:46,655 --> 02:09:56,547
This is one of several policies that appears that during a period of maybe 2016 to 2022 ish that policies may not have been forwarded to MASC.

1267
02:10:03,516 --> 02:10:05,998
to be in our online repository.

1268
02:10:06,058 --> 02:10:15,204
So recently, I've been doing a lot of work with Director of Health Services, Jen Silva, on our field trip policy as an example.

1269
02:10:15,244 --> 02:10:19,247
And while we were sitting together at my table, I forget how even concussion came up.

1270
02:10:19,307 --> 02:10:23,210
And I said, hey, let me actually go in and look that up in the online

1271
02:10:23,730 --> 02:10:24,611
policy manual.

1272
02:10:25,072 --> 02:10:43,192
And as it turns out what is listed under there is a paragraph from pre concussions becoming as known as they are, which kind of raised an eyebrow for myself, and she said no no Tony Ray previous health service, a previous health service director.

1273
02:10:43,732 --> 02:10:45,994
has done work on this and this was put forward.

1274
02:10:46,515 --> 02:10:53,482
So we went through forward and on to member or so he's a really great job of looking through it, asking some really critical questions about it.

1275
02:10:54,163 --> 02:11:04,993
And moving forward, I will say, you'll get another one coming up soon the field trip policy that largely the school district has been living by but is not technically

1276
02:11:05,914 --> 02:11:08,035
uploaded into the policy handbook.

1277
02:11:08,415 --> 02:11:18,679
So I just want to make that clear that as I'm as I'm moving forward through these things, you'll get them and that policy review will have to be picked up.

1278
02:11:18,859 --> 02:11:20,120
But just so everyone's aware.

1279
02:11:21,060 --> 02:11:21,420
Thank you.

1280
02:11:22,161 --> 02:11:23,181
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1281
02:11:24,402 --> 02:11:25,302
Member Ntapa.

1282
02:11:26,568 --> 02:11:27,068
Thank you, Mayor.

1283
02:11:27,428 --> 02:11:29,089
And thank you for the context.

1284
02:11:29,169 --> 02:11:30,010
It's really good to know.

1285
02:11:31,531 --> 02:11:36,333
We've done protocol, which I remember in the rowing team, there was protocol when someone got a concussion.

1286
02:11:38,434 --> 02:11:52,762
My question is, so looking through, it looks like the sort of the pre-agreement that students have, I'm sorry, the specific language is the MIA Pre-Participation Sports Candidate Medical Questionnaire.

1287
02:11:54,653 --> 02:11:58,982
Is that we just using that as a because I have a feeling this question might come up.

1288
02:11:59,664 --> 02:12:01,848
Are we just using that as the standard?

1289
02:12:02,569 --> 02:12:05,996
Or is it only for MIA sanctioned sports?

1290
02:12:07,679 --> 02:12:09,781
or is that going, is that form?

1291
02:12:10,601 --> 02:12:29,476
It is the, so it's on the second page, it's under purpose, it's under, I'm sorry, pre-participation requirement training, page four, it's like the big body paragraph, the first big body paragraph right there, where it mentions how the students, oh, it just says extracurricular athletic activities, okay, so.

1292
02:12:30,585 --> 02:12:33,526
It's just anyone who's participating extracurricular athletic activities.

1293
02:12:33,606 --> 02:12:35,186
It's not just specific to MIA.

1294
02:12:35,246 --> 02:12:37,746
It's club sports, rugby, whatever have you.

1295
02:12:39,207 --> 02:12:39,447
Correct.

1296
02:12:39,527 --> 02:12:39,747
Okay.

1297
02:12:39,907 --> 02:12:40,207
Thank you.

1298
02:12:40,287 --> 02:12:42,467
That was just, I didn't see that first sentence, I guess.

1299
02:12:42,767 --> 02:12:43,047
Thank you.

1300
02:12:43,187 --> 02:12:44,027
That's my only question.

1301
02:12:45,848 --> 02:12:46,148
Thank you.

1302
02:12:46,248 --> 02:12:46,828
Member Rousseau.

1303
02:12:48,808 --> 02:12:49,508
Motion to approve.

1304
02:12:53,589 --> 02:12:57,810
Seconded by, oh gosh, that was a member Graham.

1305
02:13:03,569 --> 02:13:04,349
All those in favor?

1306
02:13:05,110 --> 02:13:05,250
Aye.

1307
02:13:05,470 --> 02:13:06,290
All those opposed?

1308
02:13:07,791 --> 02:13:08,591
Motion passes.

1309
02:13:09,291 --> 02:13:10,232
Thank you, Member Russo.

1310
02:13:12,512 --> 02:13:15,774
We're going to flip to page nine.

1311
02:13:16,854 --> 02:13:25,858
We do not have any reports requested nor condolences, but we do want to notify the public of a meeting tomorrow, May 20th.

1312
02:13:27,228 --> 02:13:30,111
That's the strategic and capital planning subcommittee.

1313
02:13:30,231 --> 02:13:32,573
It's gonna be by Zoom at 6 p.m.

1314
02:13:33,274 --> 02:13:43,004
The next regular scheduled meeting also falls on the same night as the Junior Honor Society at the McGlynn, which I believe some of us have a conflict with.

1315
02:13:43,244 --> 02:13:47,869
So we can poll the members and see if we have a quorum or if we're gonna move that.

1316
02:13:47,949 --> 02:13:50,792
So the next meeting is tentative June 2nd.

1317
02:13:53,403 --> 02:14:02,963
Yes, I would request that I can get back to this body because I do think that I did reach out to Principal Tucci, who may be working to change that date.

1318
02:14:04,286 --> 02:14:05,890
Oh, Mr. Tucci is going to change the date.

1319
02:14:05,990 --> 02:14:07,172
Okay, so keep us posted.

1320
02:14:07,192 --> 02:14:08,174
We'll let the public know.

1321
02:14:08,816 --> 02:14:10,219
Okay, is there a motion to adjourn?

1322
02:14:11,541 --> 02:14:12,604
Member Ntaba, seconded by?

1323
02:14:12,624 --> 02:14:12,744
Second.

1324
02:14:13,505 --> 02:14:14,848
Member Graham, all those in favor?

1325
02:14:14,868 --> 02:14:14,928
Aye.

1326
02:14:15,790 --> 02:14:16,492
All those opposed?
