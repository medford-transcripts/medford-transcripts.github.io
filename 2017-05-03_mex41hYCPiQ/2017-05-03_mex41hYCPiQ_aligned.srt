1
00:00:03,507 --> 00:00:06,209
Good evening.

2
00:00:06,229 --> 00:00:09,952
17th regular meeting of the Memphis City Council, May 2nd, 2017.

3
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:13,254
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

4
00:00:14,735 --> 00:00:15,856
Councilor DelaRusso.

5
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:16,597
Present.

Present.

8
00:00:18,798 --> 00:00:19,379
Councilor Knight.

9
00:00:19,499 --> 00:00:19,779
Present.

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,320
Councilor Warren Kern.

11
00:00:22,161 --> 00:00:22,341
Present.

12
00:00:22,361 --> 00:00:23,102
Vice President Marks.

13
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:23,822
Present.

14
00:00:24,182 --> 00:00:25,083
Councilor Scott Kelly.

15
00:00:25,103 --> 00:00:25,443
Present.

16
00:00:25,944 --> 00:00:26,844
President Caviello.

17
00:00:27,105 --> 00:00:27,465
Present.

18
00:00:28,346 --> 00:00:29,707
Please rise and salute the flag.

19
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,688
I pledge allegiance to the flag

20
00:00:44,767 --> 00:00:47,189
Motion by Councilor Knight to suspend the rules.

21
00:00:47,249 --> 00:00:47,950
Seconded by?

22
00:00:49,352 --> 00:00:50,413
By Councilor Falco.

23
00:00:50,693 --> 00:00:51,274
Councilor Knight.

24
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,236
Mr. President, I'd like to take a paper from the table.

25
00:00:54,077 --> 00:00:54,998
Paper from the table.

26
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:57,660
Communications from the mayor, 17414, please.

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,741
17414, one second, please.

28
00:01:16,136 --> 00:01:20,491
17414 to the Honorable President and members of the Memphis City Council.

29
00:01:21,638 --> 00:01:29,040
Dear Mr. President, City Council, I respectfully request to recommend that your honorable body approve the following transfer of funds.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,281
Amount $22,400 from account 010-102-5110-1112.

31
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:31,601
Account 010-151-5110.

32
00:01:49,401 --> 00:02:05,545
The purpose of this transfer is to appropriate the funds for the assistant city solicitor position as classification was changed from CAF 10, CAF 12 per request of the city council during the fiscal 17 budget deliberations.

33
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:14,867
In addition, solicitor Romley had a request in this budget narrative that the law office assistant position be reclassified from CAF 3,

34
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,671
to CF4.

35
00:02:17,091 --> 00:02:21,314
Solicitor Rumley will be here to answer any questions that we may have.

36
00:02:24,976 --> 00:02:25,937
Councilor DelaRusso.

37
00:02:26,157 --> 00:02:26,757
Move approval.

38
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:29,980
On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso.

39
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:31,961
Councilor Knight.

40
00:02:32,681 --> 00:02:34,723
Mr. President, this appears to be housekeeping to me.

41
00:02:34,763 --> 00:02:39,566
The council had voted to approve a change in the classification of the Assistant City Solicitor during last year's budget debates.

42
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:42,528
And this looks like it's housekeeping to make sure that the accounts line up.

43
00:02:42,952 --> 00:02:45,655
I'm hoping that the city solicitor will be able to come up here and confirm that.

44
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:47,777
And then I'd be happy to second council Della Russo's motion.

45
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:50,619
Mr. Solicitor.

46
00:02:55,123 --> 00:02:55,544
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:55,584 --> 00:02:56,305
I was distracted.

48
00:02:56,345 --> 00:02:57,005
Mr. President.

49
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,327
Oh, I am Mr. Solicitor.

50
00:02:59,387 --> 00:02:59,808
I'm fine.

51
00:02:59,828 --> 00:03:00,148
Thank you.

52
00:03:00,408 --> 00:03:04,172
Um, the question that I would like to have it back, um, would be,

53
00:03:04,596 --> 00:03:05,737
This is just a housekeeping matter.

54
00:03:05,757 --> 00:03:14,004
During the budget debates last year, we voted to approve an increase in the salary of the Assistant City Solicitor, and this is just a- Yes, this is the appropriation which would take care of the increase.

55
00:03:14,524 --> 00:03:15,185
Okay.

56
00:03:15,265 --> 00:03:16,726
That's really the long and short of it.

57
00:03:17,006 --> 00:03:27,875
It would have been nice if this had been done concurrently with the reclassification, but it wasn't, so this is necessary in order for us to be able to finish the fiscal year, everything square.

58
00:03:29,596 --> 00:03:33,920
Mr. President, based on that explanation, I would second Counselor De La Russo's motion for approval.

59
00:03:34,918 --> 00:03:38,559
Mr. Solicitor, is this not in change of classification?

60
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,540
No, it is not.

61
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:49,583
It's to fund the change in classification that was presented by Councilor Longo Kern back last year at the beginning of the budgetary year, dealing with the Assistant City Solicitor.

62
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:52,564
And no, it is not a classification change.

63
00:03:52,624 --> 00:03:54,945
It's to fund the change that was made.

64
00:03:55,245 --> 00:03:55,546
Thank you.

65
00:03:56,626 --> 00:03:59,847
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

66
00:04:01,848 --> 00:04:02,428
All those in favor?

67
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:04,669
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

68
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:09,973
Councilor DelaRosso?

69
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:10,313
Yes.

70
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:11,534
Councilor Falco?

71
00:04:11,674 --> 00:04:11,915
Yes.

72
00:04:12,355 --> 00:04:12,875
Councilor Naik?

73
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:13,396
Yes.

74
00:04:13,716 --> 00:04:14,437
Councilor Locker?

75
00:04:15,337 --> 00:04:15,497
Yes.

76
00:04:15,517 --> 00:04:16,178
Vice President Marks?

77
00:04:16,638 --> 00:04:16,978
Yes.

78
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,159
Councilor Scarpelli?

79
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:18,800
Yes.

80
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,161
President Cavielli?

81
00:04:20,481 --> 00:04:20,741
Yes.

82
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:23,483
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

83
00:04:23,904 --> 00:04:24,704
Motion passes.

84
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:25,325
Thank you, Mr. Solis.

85
00:04:25,385 --> 00:04:27,026
On behalf of the law department, we thank you very much.

86
00:04:27,346 --> 00:04:27,827
Yes.

87
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:29,448
While we're in suspension,

88
00:04:34,172 --> 00:04:53,483
17351.

89
00:04:34,412 --> 00:04:53,483
Dear Mr. President, city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body approve the combining of the Water Enterprise Fund and the Sewer Enterprise Fund into one enterprise fund per Mass General Law Chapter 44, Section 53, F12.

90
00:04:56,424 --> 00:05:03,328
To that end, I recommend your approval of the following resolution be it resolved that the City of Memphis accepts

91
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:17,679
the provisions of Chapter 44, Section 53F12 of the Massachusetts General Laws and combines the Water Enterprise Fund and the Sewer Enterprise Fund into one enterprise fund effective fiscal year 2018.

92
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:26,088
Attached is the combined Water and Sewer Enterprise Funds Memorandum that was provided to the Water and Sewer Commission

93
00:05:26,481 --> 00:05:32,947
highlighting benefits of consolidating two enterprise funds into one enterprise fund.

94
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:39,052
A letter from the Water and Sewer Commission is provided which demonstrates their support.

95
00:05:39,412 --> 00:05:46,599
Finance Director Alicia Nunley is present to answer any of the council's questions regarding this matter sincerely.

96
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:48,921
Mayor Stephanie Burke.

97
00:05:51,287 --> 00:05:52,288
Counselor De La Russo.

98
00:05:52,648 --> 00:05:59,533
As this paper was tabled some weeks ago, we've had sufficient time to review, inquire, and be involved.

99
00:06:00,034 --> 00:06:05,118
As I did several weeks ago, I would like to, this week, move approval.

100
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:05,838
Thank you.

101
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,320
Counselor Knight.

102
00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:19,729
Yes, Mr. President, it's my understanding that this matter was brought forward by the administration in an effort to reduce the duplication of efforts and to streamline some of the accounting principles and practices that they have in the office downstairs.

103
00:06:20,403 --> 00:06:29,245
We have a finance director here, and maybe she can confirm that and talk a little bit about how this is going to work, and then I'll be happy to second Councillor de la Rousseau's motion, provided that the questions are answered appropriately.

104
00:06:29,805 --> 00:06:30,105
Thank you.

105
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,205
Name and address of the director, please.

106
00:06:31,986 --> 00:06:33,266
Good evening, Honourable Councillors.

107
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:38,207
Alicia Nunley, Finance Director for the City of Medford, and through the Chair to Councillor Knight.

108
00:06:38,547 --> 00:06:41,608
Yes, this would be streamlining the whole accounting.

109
00:06:41,628 --> 00:06:42,588
It would be a lot easier.

110
00:06:42,608 --> 00:06:48,189
We would still have two revenue streams to account for the sewer and water, but all expenses would be shared between the two.

111
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,450
Thank you.

112
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,752
Mr. President, I'm satisfied with the explanation that the finance director gave a couple weeks ago.

113
00:06:56,292 --> 00:07:05,716
This couple, but the committee of the whole meeting that we had and the reinforcement of such and her statement again this evening would lead me to believe that this is something that I can support and I would second Councilor DelaRusso's motion for approval.

114
00:07:05,736 --> 00:07:06,056
Thank you.

115
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:10,858
On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Knight.

116
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,920
Name and address of the record, please.

117
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,501
Robert Penza, Zero Summit Road, Miffin, Mass., former member of the Saugus party.

118
00:07:21,161 --> 00:07:24,942
I can appreciate the fact that you folks want to incorporate the water and sewer count together.

119
00:07:24,962 --> 00:07:25,362
And as Ms.

120
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:29,443
Nutley just indicated, you got permission from the Department of Revenue, from my understanding.

121
00:07:29,623 --> 00:07:30,063
Is that correct?

122
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:30,143
Yes.

123
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:30,963
OK.

124
00:07:31,403 --> 00:07:39,825
But with that being said, the water and sewer rate does have a section in there that talks about any surplus that's in there for a period of time.

125
00:07:40,621 --> 00:07:53,949
And if, in fact, the surplus is not being used for a project that will begin within a 90-day period of time, and they're sitting on approximately $8 million, that those monies should be returned back to the Medford taxpayers.

126
00:07:54,510 --> 00:08:01,034
Now, you just had a committee of the whole meeting tonight to talk about a new connectivity charge that is being proposed by the Water and Sewer Department.

127
00:08:01,874 --> 00:08:06,717
But there was no discussion as it related to what's going to happen to the $8.5 million that's out there.

128
00:08:07,397 --> 00:08:29,817
And I would like to make a strong suggestion that the council amend your vote or make it a B paper asking either for the city solicitor, I mean for the city engineer and or the water and sewer department to have a plan presented to folks ready to go within 90 days or that those monies are revert back to the Metro taxpayers.

129
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:31,739
I think it's just fair.

130
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:37,156
We keep talking, and we keep hearing over and beyond, over and over, that we have money in this surplus account.

131
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:39,396
And as it was explained to us.

132
00:08:40,717 --> 00:08:41,497
Point of information.

133
00:08:41,517 --> 00:08:42,077
Counselor Knight.

134
00:08:42,697 --> 00:08:55,940
Am I correct that the paper before us is as to whether or not we want to combine the accounts, not whether or not we're really looking at how the accounts are utilized, but whether or not we're really just allowing the finance director to combine the two accounts for accounting purposes and to eliminate duplication of efforts?

135
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,540
Thank you.

136
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,560
That is the purpose of the paper.

137
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:57,820
Thank you.

138
00:08:58,376 --> 00:09:06,578
And besides having it for accounting purposes, there is a usage factor in there by emerging the two, which also has a surplus of eight and a half or thereabouts millions of dollars.

139
00:09:07,138 --> 00:09:15,620
Again, if the city has no intention of using that money for a project ready to go within 90 days, the money, according to the law, needs to be returned back to the taxpayers.

140
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:25,762
So what I respectfully ask any one of my colleagues or is on a joint motion that the city sit down immediately to find out if there is going to be a project within 90 days that's going to be operational.

141
00:09:25,782 --> 00:09:26,782
Don't forget, you've had it for

142
00:09:27,118 --> 00:09:28,559
For years, this money's been sitting there.

143
00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:33,141
So as a result of that, it's either use it or give it back.

144
00:09:33,482 --> 00:09:41,426
It's unfortunate that you've accumulated that kind of an account with that kind of money, but not any ongoing projects ready to go for that money to be utilized.

145
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:47,810
And I think that just fits into the parameters of the way the law was written.

146
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:50,992
Thank you.

147
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:54,414
On the motion by Councilor Dela Russo, seconded by Councilor Knight.

148
00:09:55,334 --> 00:09:56,755
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

149
00:09:58,587 --> 00:09:59,508
Councilor Dela Russo?

150
00:09:59,648 --> 00:09:59,928
Yes.

151
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:01,089
Councilor Falco?

152
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:01,610
Yes.

153
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:02,691
Councilor Night?

154
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:03,131
Yes.

155
00:10:03,591 --> 00:10:04,272
Councilor Kerr?

156
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:04,412
Yes.

157
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,534
Vice President Moxley?

158
00:10:06,554 --> 00:10:06,774
Yes.

159
00:10:07,154 --> 00:10:07,955
Councilor Scarpelli?

160
00:10:08,015 --> 00:10:08,235
Yes.

161
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:09,396
President Caviello?

162
00:10:09,657 --> 00:10:09,957
Yes.

163
00:10:10,457 --> 00:10:12,980
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

164
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,421
Motion passes.

165
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:19,145
While we're under suspension, Councilor Night.

166
00:10:22,877 --> 00:10:30,139
Can we take paper 17412 off the presentations petition for similar matters?

167
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:30,139

Chairman of the Licensing Committee.

242
00:13:45,202 --> 00:13:46,062
Thank you.

243
00:13:46,262 --> 00:13:51,164
Again, you're just taking over an existing business, purchased the existing business?

244
00:13:51,284 --> 00:13:52,084
Yes, that's correct.

245
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,165
And your business hours?

246
00:13:54,925 --> 00:13:56,485
Our business hours starts from 11 a.m.

247
00:13:56,525 --> 00:13:56,786
to 3 a.m.

248
00:13:56,806 --> 00:13:56,986
3 a.m.?

249
00:13:57,006 --> 00:13:57,286
3 a.m.

250
00:13:57,306 --> 00:13:57,706
Is that... No.

251
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:03,449
Do they have a special permit?

252
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:04,530
Okay.

253
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,350
Is that cited?

254
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,371
It is, okay.

255
00:14:08,391 --> 00:14:11,491
Okay.

256
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:14,932
So I see that all the departments have signed off on it.

257
00:14:15,992 --> 00:14:21,694
Again, I appreciate the clarification on the 3M hour and move for approval.

258
00:14:23,454 --> 00:14:27,055

266
00:14:44,155 --> 00:14:44,355
Yes.

00:14:44,996 --> 00:14:45,716
Councilor Montgomery.

268
00:14:45,976 --> 00:14:46,176
Yes.

269
00:14:46,196 --> 00:14:47,356
Vice President Marks.

270
00:14:47,796 --> 00:14:48,116
Yes.

271
00:14:48,616 --> 00:14:49,417
Councilor Stappelli.

272
00:14:49,657 --> 00:14:49,917

273
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:51,057
President Cabrillo.

274
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:51,797
Yes.

275
00:14:53,037 --> 00:14:55,138
Seven in the affirmative and none in the negative.

276
00:14:55,318 --> 00:14:56,218

279
00:14:57,298 --> 00:14:57,679
Thank you.

280
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:59,119
Good luck in your new business.

281
00:15:03,677 --> 00:15:07,913
Motion by Councillor Marks to revert back to regular business.

282
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:30,885
17-407 offered by Vice President Marks, whereas the West Medford parking lot, which consists of 35 customer parking spots, will be closed for an extended period of time due to the treatment of underground contaminants.

283
00:15:30,985 --> 00:15:38,732
Be it resolved that the bus stop in front of 440 High Street at Bargain Spot Liquors be temporarily located

284
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:48,117
between Brookline Bank and 422 High Street in the interest of adding additional parking for the West Medford businesses.

285
00:15:49,197 --> 00:15:50,078
Vice President Marks.

286
00:15:50,938 --> 00:15:51,959
Thank you, Mr. President.

287
00:15:52,499 --> 00:16:05,908
I had the opportunity last week to attend a business neighborhood meeting regarding the proposed work that's gonna be done at Bogginsport Liquors, the West Medford parking lot.

288
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,251
It has been mentioned before this council on a number of occasions.

289
00:16:10,092 --> 00:16:27,800
There has been contamination found underground and the city is in the process of removing the contaminants through a high water injection, multiple injections into the ground over a sustained period of time.

290
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:34,443
While this takes place, Mr. President, we were told by the city engineer, as well as the chief of police,

291
00:16:35,067 --> 00:16:51,019
and as well as the consultant that was hired by the city that this parking lot will not be able to have any parking accommodations for a three-phased approach.

292
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:54,882
The first phase, I believe, will last at least

293
00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:14,282
I think it was 21 to 30 days, that was mentioned, of injections, followed by a phase two process, depending on how successful they are with phase one, that could range anywhere from five to 10 days, depending on what's left over, and then an eventual phase three.

294
00:17:14,822 --> 00:17:24,008
The reason why I offer this resolution, Mr. President, is the parking lot behind the Bargain Spot Liquors is a place where many

295
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:28,070
patron's park to frequent the West Method businesses.

296
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:44,116
And actually many businesses will also use that as a place where deliveries can be had, a place where people can come and do some temporary parking to run in and

297
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,689
do deliveries and other things in the area.

298
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:56,693
And when we remove these 35 spots, it's going to become increasingly difficult for people to come in and traverse this area.

299
00:17:57,373 --> 00:18:04,917
There is a plan by the police department to relax some of the parking restrictions in the area for a period of time.

300
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:12,788
There's discussion about also using the tip of Playstead Park for some additional parking.

301
00:18:13,648 --> 00:18:29,651
And this resolution actually was from business owners that approached me after the meeting asking that if we could temporarily relocate the bus stop in front of Bargain Spot Liquors, they could pick up four spots in the heart of West Medford Square.

302
00:18:30,411 --> 00:18:32,632
And we took a walk along the area.

303
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:34,612
We took a walk up to

304
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:38,718
422 High Street, and also in front of Brookline Bank.

305
00:18:39,338 --> 00:18:50,910
And I think we found a perfect location, temporary location, that's handicap accessible, because that'll be the first thing the MBTA requires of the city if we move the spot.

306
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:58,898
And indeed, we did see accessibility ramps on the corner of Canal and High Street.

307
00:18:59,712 --> 00:19:24,631
And I would ask at this time, Mr. President, in the interest of providing more parking at a time that it's needed in West Medford Square, that this council vote tonight to request immediately that the MBTA go out there and move the spot between Brookline Bank and 422 High Street in the interest of adding additional parking spots in West Medford Square.

308
00:19:25,152 --> 00:19:29,155
We also have a number of the business owners, Mr. President, that would like

309
00:19:30,315 --> 00:19:37,358
I think one or two would like to come up and say a few words regarding how important this is to business and the general vicinity.

310
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:42,760
And at this time, if we can allow business owners to get up, Mr. President.

311
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,781
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

312
00:19:44,201 --> 00:19:45,501
Would anyone like to speak in this matter?

313
00:19:49,403 --> 00:19:49,823
Good evening.

314
00:19:49,863 --> 00:19:50,964
Name and address of the record, please.

315
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,124
Ginny Roach, 64 Bower Street, Manfred.

316
00:19:54,105 --> 00:19:55,085
I own CB Scoops.

317
00:19:56,426 --> 00:19:59,147
I've been asking, actually, for this bus stop to be moved

318
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,693
quite a bit for quite a few years.

319
00:20:02,914 --> 00:20:05,274
Just the location, the liquor store, there's a bench there.

320
00:20:05,294 --> 00:20:07,254
A lot of people tend to hang there.

321
00:20:07,294 --> 00:20:09,515
They go get whatever they get, come and sit.

322
00:20:10,635 --> 00:20:11,615
I see elderly.

323
00:20:11,635 --> 00:20:12,595
I see children.

324
00:20:12,615 --> 00:20:16,516
I see all kinds of people just trying to navigate away from that.

325
00:20:17,576 --> 00:20:18,796
It's just a bad location.

326
00:20:18,856 --> 00:20:22,717
You shouldn't be able to bring your kids in front of a liquor store to get on a bus.

327
00:20:23,077 --> 00:20:24,497
It should be moved permanently.

328
00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:29,258
I agree with definitely temporary, and I appreciate that first step, but I would like

329
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:33,625
you also to consider talking to the MBTA about moving it permanently.

330
00:20:34,565 --> 00:20:34,986
Thank you.

331
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:35,406
Thank you.

332
00:20:37,387 --> 00:20:38,327
Second, Mr. President.

333
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:41,829
Would anyone else like to speak on this matter?

334
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,591
They're all shy now, the business owners.

335
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:47,032
Counselor Knight.

336
00:20:47,052 --> 00:20:48,413
You did such a good job, Counselor.

337
00:20:48,853 --> 00:20:50,073
Counselor Knight.

338
00:20:50,454 --> 00:20:52,915
Mr. President, I certainly support this paper wholeheartedly.

339
00:20:52,935 --> 00:20:58,578
And I also think that in light of the fact that the majority of these business owners in West Medford do purchase

340
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:11,186
business permits, and this is the business permit law, that there should be a pro-ratio abatement to the business permit holder for the period of time equivalent to the amount of days that the law is closed.

341
00:21:11,786 --> 00:21:26,654
So I'd like to include that as part of the paper, that the Traffic Commission provide a pro-ratio abatement to the cost of a business permit in the equivalent of the number of days that the individuals that are in possession of the business permit

342
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:29,599
are unable to access the lot.

343
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:30,680
Thank you.

344
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,181
Name and address of the wreckage.

345
00:21:33,261 --> 00:21:35,062
Stephen Pompeo, 18 Newton Road, Medford.

346
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:37,723
Thank you to Councilor Marks for bringing this up.

347
00:21:37,823 --> 00:21:46,666
This is going to be very helpful during this process where they're taking away the 35 parking spots in the parking lot for that period of 30 days.

348
00:21:47,346 --> 00:21:55,489
It'll also give an opportunity to test out that spot temporarily to see if it is potentially a long-term solution for moving that bus stop.

349
00:21:55,849 --> 00:21:57,750
But at least temporarily for the short term,

350
00:21:58,312 --> 00:22:00,595
I'd like the council to support that motion.

351
00:22:01,676 --> 00:22:05,400
This is a project I've been involved in since 2009 when it became a problem.

352
00:22:05,961 --> 00:22:10,827
And I know a lot of the business owners can't be here tonight because most of them in West Medford are still open and working.

353
00:22:11,424 --> 00:22:24,737
But during the meeting that Councillor Mark spoke about and at other meetings we've had, the consensus has generally been that moving that bus stop temporarily would be great to providing more spots right in the heart during this process.

354
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:30,983
There's been a number of other suggestions made to help with this situation as well.

355
00:22:31,864 --> 00:22:32,204
One of them

356
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:44,349
would be to step up the enforcement of High Street during this, rather than, there's been some suggestions to, and they're in good faith, to eliminate

357
00:22:46,423 --> 00:22:48,303
paid parking during this process.

358
00:22:48,743 --> 00:23:04,806
And if that discussion comes up, I'd just like to say that most of the businesses in West Medford would prefer to have the enforcement stepped up during this process because the businesses want to leave High Street itself for the customers and try to find alternative places for the business owners.

359
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:09,327
The tip of Placedead Park was one that's going to come up in front of the Park Commission.

360
00:23:10,568 --> 00:23:12,648
And that's a great suggestion on where to put the business owners.

361
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:19,843
But if it does come up, we'd like to also have support to double the parking enforcement on high street so that the traffic gets moved.

362
00:23:20,503 --> 00:23:20,783
Thank you.

363
00:23:21,183 --> 00:23:21,504
Thank you.

364
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:25,827
Name and address of the record.

365
00:23:26,507 --> 00:23:29,129
DJ Dabbingo, 470 High Street, West Medford.

366
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:30,089
I own Dabbs Lark.

367
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:34,693
Thank you for Councilor Marks for bringing this up and Councilor Knight for your suggestion on that.

368
00:23:35,453 --> 00:23:38,255
I brought this actually up to Park Medford back in January.

369
00:23:38,995 --> 00:23:44,358
When we were initially talking about this, I stood at this podium and asked why the work couldn't be done at night, what they were going to do about parking.

370
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:54,624
And I asked, when I was giving over my $100 for the parking permit, I said, is there going to be any kind of leeway given where they're going to be shutting our lot down for probably close to a quarter of the year?

371
00:23:55,144 --> 00:23:56,965
So we should be getting a quarter of that money back.

372
00:23:57,505 --> 00:24:00,367
I mean, as business owners, we already spend in taxes.

373
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:01,607
We already spend for utilities.

374
00:24:01,627 --> 00:24:05,710
Now we have to spend for an unguaranteed parking spot, which now, for upwards of 30 days,

375
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,881
We're just going to be at our own mercy to try to hopefully get a spot on the street.

376
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:14,123
And then the other issue is the bus stop being moved.

377
00:24:14,623 --> 00:24:24,668
It's a great thing, but I think it should be permanently over in front of the bank, where it's more ADA and compliant accessible by wheelchairs, people on crutches, where it's not so much in front of the liquor store.

378
00:24:24,748 --> 00:24:34,792
Because the next project they're going to do after the parking lot is they're going to be putting curb bump outs there to narrow high street to increase pedestrian safety, traffic flow kind of thing.

379
00:24:35,337 --> 00:24:50,106
And when talking with the city engineer, I said, if you put the bump out where you're putting it, and the bus now has to go around it to get into the bus stop, now you're going to have the buses back in, sticking onto High Street, thus causing more traffic jams than there already are on High Street during the rush hours.

380
00:24:50,607 --> 00:24:54,249
So I think a permanent solution is permanently putting the bus down in front of Brookline Bank.

381
00:24:54,689 --> 00:24:58,191
They have their own small parking lot behind the bank for their customers.

382
00:24:58,312 --> 00:25:00,213
And I think it's a way to go.

383
00:25:01,095 --> 00:25:01,695
So, thank you.

384
00:25:01,915 --> 00:25:02,175
Thank you.

385
00:25:02,195 --> 00:25:07,717
I think there is a proposal to maybe use some land on a place to park, which has been proposed also.

386
00:25:10,457 --> 00:25:11,237
Councilor Scarpelli.

387
00:25:12,138 --> 00:25:13,038
Thank you, Mr. President.

388
00:25:13,998 --> 00:25:19,660
I thank my colleague, Michael Marks, for bringing this forward, and I appreciate all the business owners.

389
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:29,562
I think that as the chairperson of transportation, I think that I wholeheartedly support the temporary movement, but call for a subcommittee meeting

390
00:25:30,032 --> 00:25:36,954
and request the powers to be from the T to make this a full-time change.

391
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:39,835
So I'll be looking for a meeting relatively soon.

392
00:25:39,855 --> 00:25:47,497
I think that we still haven't heard anything back about the resolution we put in about the Main Street and High Street issues again this week.

393
00:25:48,977 --> 00:25:52,758
There were work trucks again in front of that location, that T stuff.

394
00:25:53,358 --> 00:25:58,880
And again, it left the buses out onto High Street and off the curb.

395
00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:05,101
So I know they told us last meeting pretty arrogantly that that doesn't happen, and no one's called them.

396
00:26:05,161 --> 00:26:06,941
But some people are calling me again.

397
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:12,743
And I think that we need to move quickly on these issues.

398
00:26:12,763 --> 00:26:18,245
I know we've talked to the director of ADA, and I know that we've heard some concerns.

399
00:26:18,305 --> 00:26:24,126
But there are other issues on the other side why people aren't speaking up.

400
00:26:24,186 --> 00:26:29,028
So we need to enforce that, and hopefully the clerk

401
00:26:29,648 --> 00:26:38,610
reach out again to the department of transportation and the T to get a meeting as soon as possible.

402
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:38,990
Thank you.

403
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:39,511
Thank you.

404
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:40,351
Councilor Scott Billy.

405
00:26:41,591 --> 00:26:42,231
Councilor Falco.

406
00:26:42,591 --> 00:26:43,272
Thank you, Mr. President.

407
00:26:43,292 --> 00:26:45,652
I just wanted to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward.

408
00:26:45,712 --> 00:26:51,854
I think it's a good common sense solution that makes sense for the business owners and for the community in general.

409
00:26:52,534 --> 00:26:56,775
I would definitely be in favor of moving the bus stop full time, especially away from the liquor store.

410
00:26:58,321 --> 00:26:59,221
I'm glad you brought that forward.

411
00:26:59,241 --> 00:27:01,502
I'm also glad that the business owners came down tonight.

412
00:27:01,562 --> 00:27:02,803
I think it's important to hear from them.

413
00:27:03,523 --> 00:27:09,367
They experience this every day, and it's good to get their opinions, and it's nice that they came down, so thank you for coming down tonight.

414
00:27:09,927 --> 00:27:12,208
But I am in favor of this resolution, so thank you.

415
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,189
Thank you.

416
00:27:13,749 --> 00:27:14,589
Counselor Longo-Kern.

417
00:27:14,709 --> 00:27:15,930
Thank you, President Carviel.

418
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:21,153
Do we know how many parking spaces we'll be able to capture if we move the stop?

419
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:22,634
Four.

420
00:27:22,654 --> 00:27:24,375
Four?

421
00:27:26,197 --> 00:27:29,818
With regards to Brookline Bank, are they in compliance?

422
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,298
Are they okay with this, do we know?

423
00:27:31,538 --> 00:27:33,599
I don't think we've done, I don't know if anyone's talked to Brookline Bank yet.

424
00:27:33,699 --> 00:27:35,299
They do have a parking lot on the rail.

425
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:36,419
They have a parking lot on the rail, okay.

426
00:27:36,439 --> 00:27:38,700
So they're not losing, what are they losing?

427
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,180
They're not losing any spots if we move.

428
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,300
No, it's city parking.

429
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,201
How many spots will we be losing?

430
00:27:44,281 --> 00:27:45,521
Probably two, maybe three.

431
00:27:46,942 --> 00:27:49,282
I know there's a mailbox there that might have to be moved.

432
00:27:51,062 --> 00:27:51,203
Okay.

433
00:27:51,223 --> 00:27:52,563
If I could, Mr. President.

434
00:27:54,405 --> 00:27:55,246
Vice President Max.

435
00:27:55,526 --> 00:27:59,768
The benefit is that we're picking up the spots more in the heart of the square, where this is a little further out.

436
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:02,130
So it accommodates more business where it is.

437
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,371
So that's what we're hoping to do.

438
00:28:04,431 --> 00:28:05,392
And eventually, I agree.

439
00:28:05,452 --> 00:28:08,394
I think, as my colleagues agree, we'd like to see it permanent.

440
00:28:08,934 --> 00:28:16,038
And this may be a great way of just getting it in and then saying it's been working, it's successful, and let's stick with it.

441
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:18,540
Mr. President, I just want to thank the businesses for showing up tonight.

442
00:28:19,601 --> 00:28:23,243
You know, it's amazing when you sit down with business owners and people in the community.

443
00:28:23,616 --> 00:28:27,577
what great suggestions you can get, Mr. President, and move forward with it.

444
00:28:27,617 --> 00:28:29,338
I just want to thank the business owners.

445
00:28:29,398 --> 00:28:29,698
Thank you.

446
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:38,500
And if I may, through the chair, with regards to everything that's been discussed tonight, proposals, I hear there's a lot of proposals out there.

447
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:45,682
When will the, I know this is starting fairly quickly and there are a lot of concerns from the business owners down in West Medford.

448
00:28:46,123 --> 00:28:50,764
So when will these proposals be more set in stone so that the business owners can

449
00:28:51,412 --> 00:29:01,396
comment and maybe make additional suggestions and recommendations to alleviate some concerns because as a business owner, I would not want to be put out like this for 30 days, 40 days.

450
00:29:02,697 --> 00:29:17,243
So I just, through the chair, if I could recommend that the mayor's office work with the business owners, maybe whether that be another meeting once their proposals are, you know, kind of set in stone so that we can make sure everybody's happy and we can do whatever we can for the business owners.

451
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,642
This is just one step in the many that probably need to be done in the next couple of months.

452
00:29:21,722 --> 00:29:25,643
But whatever we have to do, we want to make sure the doors stay open and moving.

453
00:29:26,363 --> 00:29:26,703
Thank you.

454
00:29:27,564 --> 00:29:28,084
Councillor Knight.

455
00:29:29,104 --> 00:29:29,945
Yes, Mr. President.

456
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:32,826
I'm wondering if maybe someone in the business community can answer this question for me.

457
00:29:32,846 --> 00:29:39,468
But we also have a bus stop on the corner of Warren coming, I guess that would be West, into West Medford.

458
00:29:39,949 --> 00:29:43,050
And we have a bus stop at the corner of Placedead Road at Irving Street.

459
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:53,763
Have those also been looked at as potential bus stops to move further away from the square to create some more parking on the opposite side of the street?

460
00:29:54,443 --> 00:29:57,083
There's a spot on Warren and High.

461
00:29:57,103 --> 00:29:59,063
The bus stop right in front of the spot.

462
00:29:59,584 --> 00:30:01,384
That's the only other spot.

463
00:30:01,484 --> 00:30:04,744
And then there's a bus stop on the corner of Irving Street in place of the road.

464
00:30:04,784 --> 00:30:06,305
I think that's got to stay there.

465
00:30:06,325 --> 00:30:07,525
There's nowhere else to go over there.

466
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:08,945
And even if they move it.

467
00:30:09,185 --> 00:30:09,805
Nowhere to move there.

468
00:30:09,825 --> 00:30:13,826
But I think the proposal was to talk to the Park Commission and

469
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:18,731
take that small section of Placid Park where they... Well, I'm well aware what the proposal is.

470
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:21,352
The question is whether or not those locations have been examined.

471
00:30:21,652 --> 00:30:24,153
So hopefully that'll be an area for them to park.

472
00:30:24,273 --> 00:30:30,914
If I can amend the paper to request that those two locations be examined, the corner of High Street and Warren Street, and the corner of Placid Road and Irving Street.

473
00:30:31,835 --> 00:30:32,175
Thank you.

474
00:30:34,555 --> 00:30:38,917
On the motion by Vice President Marx, seconded by Councilor

475
00:30:41,224 --> 00:30:41,824
Scott Pelley.

476
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:45,405
Roll call vote has been requested, Mr. Clerk.

477
00:30:45,785 --> 00:30:48,046
That will immediately be sent to the MBTA.

478
00:30:48,066 --> 00:30:50,187
That will immediately be sent to the MBTA.

479
00:30:51,867 --> 00:31:07,271
Councilor Dela Ruccio.

480
00:31:07,431 --> 00:31:07,972
Yes.

481
00:31:08,352 --> 00:31:09,032
Councilor Falco.

482
00:31:09,212 --> 00:31:09,492
Yes.

483
00:31:09,936 --> 00:31:10,456
Councilor Nye?

484
00:31:10,676 --> 00:31:10,957
Yes.

485
00:31:11,297 --> 00:31:12,057
Councilor McCurran?

486
00:31:12,077 --> 00:31:12,217
Yes.

487
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:13,939
Vice President Marks?

488
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:14,539
Yes.

489
00:31:14,899 --> 00:31:15,740
Councilor Scott Kelly?

490
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,160
Yes.

491
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,541
President Caviello?

492
00:31:18,021 --> 00:31:18,341
Yes.

493
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,463
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

494
00:31:22,104 --> 00:31:25,005
Motion passes.

495
00:31:25,026 --> 00:31:27,527
17-408 offered by Vice President Marks.

496
00:31:28,368 --> 00:31:36,773
Be it resolved that Mitchell Avenue be resurfaced in the interest of public safety and that all potholes and road depressions

497
00:31:37,307 --> 00:31:39,127
be repaired in the meantime.

498
00:31:39,267 --> 00:31:40,248
Vice President Marks.

499
00:31:40,988 --> 00:31:42,028
Thank you, Mr. President.

500
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:46,189
There's portions of Mitchell Ave that you can actually see the dirt pavement.

501
00:31:46,869 --> 00:31:52,331
And it's about time the city moves forward on repaving Mitchell Ave.

502
00:31:53,031 --> 00:32:00,533
I also want to bring up on Salem Street, which I've brought up in the past, you can see the old railroad tracks coming through the road.

503
00:32:00,973 --> 00:32:02,653
And on Riverside Ave, the same thing.

504
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:06,154
Not too far from the fire station on Riverside Ave.

505
00:32:06,464 --> 00:32:10,105
You can see the old railroad tracks appearing through the road, Mr. President.

506
00:32:10,445 --> 00:32:21,167
So I'd ask that Mitchell Ave be resurfaced in the interest of public safety, and that Salem Street and Riverside Ave be looked at for the railroad tracks that need to be covered up.

507
00:32:21,627 --> 00:32:21,987
Thank you.

508
00:32:23,087 --> 00:32:23,667
Councilor Knight.

509
00:32:24,428 --> 00:32:26,068
Mr. President, this is a great resolution.

510
00:32:26,108 --> 00:32:29,549
I think Mitchell Ave's been in rough shape since Testis was opened.

511
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:35,470
It's been long overdue that the street needs to be repaved, piggybacking on some of Councilor Mock's concerns.

512
00:32:37,048 --> 00:32:53,732
Between Route 16 at Winthrop Street and South Street, due to the detour that's in place with the closure of the Craddock Bridge, we're seeing an increased volume of cars that are being detoured down to the Winthrop Street and South Street, Winthrop to High and Winthrop to South.

513
00:32:54,692 --> 00:32:58,633
And in front of the baseball park, we're seeing the street fall apart as well.

514
00:32:58,673 --> 00:33:01,754
And we're seeing the exposed red rip rock like we're seeing on Evans Street.

515
00:33:02,734 --> 00:33:05,015
And we know that that's not something that we can just patch.

516
00:33:05,877 --> 00:33:15,684
I think this is something that may require a little bit of help from our friends at the state delegation in relation to the Craddock Bridge project and the request that we made last week for mitigation, Mr. President.

517
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:33,736
So I'd ask that this matter be put on a B paper and request that we receive some help in repaving and resurfacing the roadway between Route 16 and South Street as a result of the increased traffic volume on the roadway due to the detour that's in place because of the ramp closure.

518
00:33:34,337 --> 00:33:34,597
Thank you.

519
00:33:36,563 --> 00:33:37,443
Councilor Scarpelli.

520
00:33:38,344 --> 00:33:39,784
Thank you, Mr. President.

521
00:33:40,444 --> 00:33:45,146
If we could just ask for an update on the Evans and Parris Street.

522
00:33:45,806 --> 00:33:49,847
I think that was been mentioned, just an update on those locations, too.

523
00:33:49,887 --> 00:33:51,908
We can update on Evans and Parris Street.

524
00:33:51,928 --> 00:33:53,628
Thank you.

525
00:33:53,648 --> 00:33:54,168
Council Member Kern.

526
00:33:55,609 --> 00:33:56,949
Through the chair, thank you.

527
00:33:57,149 --> 00:34:01,931
If we could also, while we're at it, I know this is a good time if we're going to talk about streets.

528
00:34:03,091 --> 00:34:04,171
South Street's been brought up.

529
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:06,232
We did, I believe, talk about

530
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:20,427
traffic calming approaches on that, getting a lot of Mack trucks driving down South, especially since they're deterred from driving down Harvard now, and they're banging potholes, shaking homes, keeping people up at night.

531
00:34:20,947 --> 00:34:23,689
I've got multiple complaints on the speed on South Street.

532
00:34:23,789 --> 00:34:35,418
So we did discuss this months ago with regards to working to curve the speeding somehow, whether it be the speed monitoring signs, speed bumps, something needs to be done on South Street because

533
00:34:36,209 --> 00:34:40,373
It's really disrupting peace and enjoyment of the residents there.

534
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:42,295
So if we could add this to the agenda as well.

535
00:34:43,096 --> 00:34:44,418
Thank you, Councilor Locker.

536
00:34:44,478 --> 00:34:56,550
And if I could add something to that paper, if we could ask why the raised crosswalk on Boston Avenue, where Tufts was doing construction, was taken down by the city of Medford.

537
00:34:58,332 --> 00:34:58,772
Councilor Knight.

538
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:00,198
Yes, Mr. President.

539
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:15,785
I actually had a conversation with Commissioner Kerins before the Committee of the Whole today, and he informed me that Paris Street would be going underneath, I'm sorry, Evans Street, not Paris Street, would have the ground broken in the next two weeks for that project to start up.

540
00:35:16,285 --> 00:35:19,707
So I'm looking forward to seeing that happen to answer Councilor Scott Pelley's question.

541
00:35:19,747 --> 00:35:24,829
And also on your question, I spoke with Rocco DiRico from- I spoke with Rocco myself today.

542
00:35:25,575 --> 00:35:27,235
Tufts University relative to the speed bump.

543
00:35:27,255 --> 00:35:29,656
And that was a temporary speed bump that was put up during the construction.

544
00:35:30,236 --> 00:35:31,296
The construction is nearing an end.

545
00:35:31,356 --> 00:35:36,437
So they've taken the temporary speed bump down and they're going to move forward with the striping and safety markers and so on.

546
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,157
We're always fighting for raised crosswalks.

547
00:35:39,197 --> 00:35:42,318
And we had one there that they put in for free and we took it away.

548
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:54,680
On the motion by Councilor Marks as amended by Councilor Scott Pelli, Councilor Kerrio-Viello, Councilor Lego-Kern,

549
00:35:55,774 --> 00:35:56,594
Councilor Ney.

550
00:35:56,634 --> 00:35:59,476
Councilor Haynes.

551
00:36:02,677 --> 00:36:07,720
Motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor De La Russo.

552
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,561
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

553
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:15,363
Councilor De La Russo.

554
00:36:15,784 --> 00:36:16,064
Yes.

555
00:36:16,744 --> 00:36:17,544
Councilor Falcone.

556
00:36:17,605 --> 00:36:17,805
Yes.

557
00:36:18,365 --> 00:36:18,885
Councilor Ney.

558
00:36:18,925 --> 00:36:19,245
Yes.

559
00:36:19,265 --> 00:36:20,506
Councilor Malauulu-Curran.

560
00:36:20,686 --> 00:36:21,046
Yes.

561
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:21,987
Vice President Marks.

562
00:36:22,427 --> 00:36:22,767
Yes.

563
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:24,188
Councilor Scott Beally.

564
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:24,408
Yes.

565
00:36:25,265 --> 00:36:26,006
President Caviello.

566
00:36:26,126 --> 00:36:26,406
Yes.

567
00:36:26,426 --> 00:36:29,249
17 in the affirmative and none in the negative.

568
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:31,431
Motion passes.

569
00:36:31,451 --> 00:36:34,794
17-417 offered by Vice President Marks.

570
00:36:35,614 --> 00:36:45,343
Be it resolved that the proposed erection of cell phone towers at 63 Tyler Ave and 59 Charnwood Road be discussed.

571
00:36:45,944 --> 00:36:46,904
Vice President Marks.

572
00:36:48,926 --> 00:36:49,247
Thank you.

573
00:36:49,687 --> 00:36:50,668
Thank you, Mr. President.

574
00:36:51,623 --> 00:37:06,030
I offer this resolution tonight, Mr. President, to hopefully go back and have the city solicitor look into a resolution that was offered by this council and debated back in 2011.

575
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:16,195
And the reason why I offer this resolution is, Mr. President, there's a proposal by a company called In Motion Wireless and Corp.

576
00:37:17,216 --> 00:37:19,577
And they just actually put,

577
00:37:20,882 --> 00:37:24,143
an announcement in the transcript recently.

578
00:37:24,183 --> 00:37:28,405
It appeared in the April 20th edition of the transcript.

579
00:37:28,425 --> 00:37:41,850
There was a legal notice, and the legal notice stated that they were going to erect two 70-foot cell phone towers, proposed, and when I saw the addresses, I said, you gotta be kidding me.

580
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:49,673
The first address, Mr. President, was 63 Tyler Ave, which we all know is a residential area that abuts train tracks,

581
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:57,655
and also 59 Charnwood Road, which is another residential area that abuts train tracks, Mr. President.

582
00:37:58,435 --> 00:38:11,786
Both towers would be located in smack dab in neighborhoods and, in my opinion, would create a major visual impact in the area.

583
00:38:13,296 --> 00:38:19,465
Currently, there is no city ordinance that governs the placement of cell phone towers.

584
00:38:20,045 --> 00:38:24,592
The current ordinance only regulates TV and radio antennas.

585
00:38:25,593 --> 00:38:27,095
And it was back in 2008, believe it or not,

586
00:38:29,185 --> 00:38:38,992
I offered a resolution, paper 08-510, that would put into our city ordinance cell phone towers.

587
00:38:39,913 --> 00:38:45,817
And what it would do is it would prohibit cell phone towers in residential areas.

588
00:38:46,717 --> 00:38:53,302
And I'll talk about that a little bit later on, but that paper went through a lot of debate back and forth.

589
00:38:53,762 --> 00:38:55,363
National Grid spoke on the paper.

590
00:38:55,706 --> 00:39:05,410
The paper was sent to the Office of Community Development, which all ordinances need to be sent to dealing with zoning.

591
00:39:06,231 --> 00:39:09,872
And the paper trail kind of dies off after that.

592
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:23,078
But the reason why I offer this tonight, Mr. President, is, as I stated, there is no ordinance right now that prohibits towers in residential areas.

593
00:39:23,938 --> 00:39:32,044
And there was a resolution to amend ordinances only allowing cell towers in industrial and commercial zones and also by special permit.

594
00:39:32,945 --> 00:39:49,537
The matter was tabled by the council when a representative from National Grid raised an issue that was at least two state statutes allow wireless communication companies to attach antennas and amplifiers on utility poles.

595
00:39:50,165 --> 00:39:55,766
And at the time we were prohibiting any cell towers within neighborhoods.

596
00:39:56,306 --> 00:40:06,529
And they said that was in direct conflict with state statute, which allows these utility companies to put them on top of telephone poles.

597
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:11,770
Needless to say, this is not the request that was put in the transcript recently.

598
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,891
I'm asking tonight, Mr. President, that

599
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:46,585
This paper be looked at by the city solicitor, Mark Rumley, and the building commissioner, and provide the input that the Community Development Board already gave us, and the input language that National Grid gave us, which came out with, I believe, was a great city ordinance back in 2011 that would address the issue of erecting cell phone towers in residential neighborhoods.

600
00:40:47,608 --> 00:40:59,517
And so that's my first motion that the city solicitor and the building commissioner look into the 2011 city ordinance draft that was proposed.

601
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:15,429
And also, Mr. President, the legal notice that was posted deals strictly with locating a cell tower near an historical preservation, national historic preservation.

602
00:41:16,025 --> 00:41:33,197
And it's the acts of 1966 and the 2005 nationwide programmatic agreement that allows for public comment when you're putting a cell phone tower within a half mile of a historic preservation.

603
00:41:35,499 --> 00:41:38,001
And they're looking for input right now.

604
00:41:38,661 --> 00:41:42,824
And I would ask the city solicitor what legal

605
00:41:45,418 --> 00:42:03,008
Maneuvers can be done to, first of all, look at the Royal House, which is probably within, I'd say, a half a mile or very close to Charnwood Road to see if there's anything we can do on possibly putting a halt to this.

606
00:42:03,628 --> 00:42:07,551
And secondly, Mr. President, it's vital now that we act.

607
00:42:10,172 --> 00:42:14,975
I had some people come to me and say, well, there's a lot of areas in the city where

608
00:42:15,715 --> 00:42:19,878
they're considered dead zones and you can't get cell phone connections and so forth.

609
00:42:21,179 --> 00:42:22,440
That may not even be the case.

610
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,661
These may not even be phone cell towers.

611
00:42:25,081 --> 00:42:28,824
They may be cell towers for use of the railways.

612
00:42:29,685 --> 00:42:43,854
And I don't have that information, but I know that City Solicitor Rumley did reach out to the attorneys that were on the notice I received just tonight

613
00:42:44,725 --> 00:42:47,526
from the Federal Communication Commission, Washington, D.C.

614
00:42:48,246 --> 00:42:51,948
It's called Information Notice of Section 106 Filings.

615
00:42:52,628 --> 00:42:59,991
They list both addresses and who the petitioner is for both and the consultant.

616
00:43:00,971 --> 00:43:03,612
And I think Solicitor Rumley reached out.

617
00:43:03,632 --> 00:43:04,892
I'm not sure if he got a response.

618
00:43:05,373 --> 00:43:09,194
But I would ask at this time if the city solicitor can get up, Mr. President.

619
00:43:09,594 --> 00:43:10,554
He was involved in 2011

620
00:43:12,847 --> 00:43:17,389
crafting the language and working on this with the council, and I'd like to hear from him.

621
00:43:17,669 --> 00:43:17,909
Thank you.

622
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,249
Name and address of the record, please.

623
00:43:19,449 --> 00:43:19,650
Yes.

624
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:20,550
Thank you, Mr. President.

625
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:21,790
My name is Mark Rumley.

626
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:25,772
I'm the city solicitor and I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

627
00:43:27,332 --> 00:43:30,253
There's a lot of different things going on with this particular issue.

628
00:43:30,713 --> 00:43:40,517
So if we start and put to the side just for a second, although I appreciate it, the ordinance that was proposed a few years back, that really should be revived because procedurally

629
00:43:41,007 --> 00:44:03,045
It did reach some type of a death procedurally years ago for different reasons, none of which really are easy to ascertain, but nonetheless, it should be revived and it should be revived because it was a good idea that it's a good idea now, even if these notices didn't come forward right now, dealing with, uh, uh, Charnwood and Tyler now.

630
00:44:03,897 --> 00:44:08,159
to go according to what I've come across in the last few days.

631
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:17,283
I received from the city clerk two very vanilla notices under 106, and I really didn't know what they were.

632
00:44:17,323 --> 00:44:24,366
And it did say Tyler, it did say Charnwood on it, it did say something about cell phone towers and that sort of thing.

633
00:44:25,247 --> 00:44:27,588
After I received it, and almost concurrently with that,

634
00:44:27,924 --> 00:44:30,425
Councilor Mox called me and said, do you know anything about it?

635
00:44:30,445 --> 00:44:34,146
And honestly, I didn't know anything more than those two simple notices.

636
00:44:34,826 --> 00:44:38,487
So I called the consultant who were in Wisconsin this morning.

637
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,987
They called me back this afternoon.

638
00:44:40,848 --> 00:44:53,871
And this notification under chapter, under 106, which is a federal regulation, begins a comment period during which time a municipality, in this case, could comment on this particular proposal.

639
00:44:54,431 --> 00:44:56,832
And it is, as Councilor Mox had stated,

640
00:44:57,287 --> 00:44:59,988
to put up these two towers at this particular address.

641
00:45:00,449 --> 00:45:15,897
Now, the consultants were hired, of course, and they were hired by the entity that's serving the MTA, MBTA, excuse me, for these two towers, because ostensibly, the use of the towers would be to serve the ridership on the trains.

642
00:45:15,917 --> 00:45:20,799
It may not simply be a cell tower like servicing our cell phones.

643
00:45:20,859 --> 00:45:24,921
It could be to provide Wi-Fi services to the people on the train.

644
00:45:27,494 --> 00:45:29,915
And it is for the MBTA that this was planned.

645
00:45:30,916 --> 00:45:36,558
So the person on the other end was very informative, a very professional gentleman named Andrew Rice.

646
00:45:37,339 --> 00:45:40,520
And I said, is this going to service the MBTA only?

647
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:41,700
Because I wanted to know that.

648
00:45:42,321 --> 00:45:43,801
And he said, well, yes, of course.

649
00:45:44,402 --> 00:45:47,323
Well, of course, over the years, we all learned a little bit about cell towers.

650
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:52,023
And a cell tower is not necessarily just for the one use, which is on that tower.

651
00:45:52,623 --> 00:45:59,168
Because there's a whole industry, a billion dollar industry in cell towers, where the spots on that tower are sold.

652
00:45:59,808 --> 00:46:09,135
So I asked Mr. Rice today, is it the intention of the MBTA to sell any other spaces on this tower, on these towers, if they build them for commercial use?

653
00:46:09,775 --> 00:46:17,120
And the reason that I asked that is, Mr. Rice indicated, well, for many purposes, although he didn't enumerate the purposes,

654
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:23,373
For many purposes, the MBTA is exempt from local rule, and there's something to say about that.

655
00:46:23,513 --> 00:46:26,074
There is some validity to that, depending upon the use.

656
00:46:26,874 --> 00:46:41,861
But I said, if you're going to sell or you're going to rent out any of the spots on that tower, then you're not just simply using it for MBTA uses, you're using it for commercial uses, for a for-profit use, and that brings things out of many areas of exemption.

657
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:45,442
Now, of course, that's the first time we talked about it, so there's a little bit of,

658
00:46:46,923 --> 00:46:49,025
I would say silence for a few seconds after that.

659
00:46:49,045 --> 00:46:49,965
I was just lifted at that.

660
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:59,873
So, the second thing is, when this notice went in the transcript, that began what under 106 is a 30-day comment period.

661
00:47:00,794 --> 00:47:05,938
A 30-day comment period for everyone to send in their sentiments, concerns, and questions.

662
00:47:06,438 --> 00:47:16,746
Now, I believe that the direct communication to the city was sent to the city clerk, the historic commission, I believe, and also it said generically the city of Medford.

663
00:47:17,498 --> 00:47:24,724
Well, we can all say it was sent to the city of Medford, but you need to have a little bit of meat on the bones when you use that particular term.

664
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:38,076
So to make sure the city of Medford received it, I asked Mr. Rice to send me the full packet this afternoon, which he did by email, and I flipped it out to nine or 10 department heads, and I shared it with the council.

665
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:40,077
But I think you might have had it anyway.

666
00:47:40,137 --> 00:47:42,279
I didn't know, but I wanted to make sure that you had it.

667
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,201
So where does that leave us?

668
00:47:45,058 --> 00:47:53,661
That leaves us, one, with an ordinance that probably needs a little bit of shaping and a little bit of polish for present day, which is a good idea anyway, should look at that.

669
00:47:54,261 --> 00:48:10,207
And two, it puts us smack dab in the middle of a comment period where the city, its departments, its executive branch, and all other entities that have been notified should give their concern into the FCC under this notice.

670
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:27,117
Third, it puts us in the position of examining what the exact use would be by the MBTA and whether or not, if they do have any exemptions, whether or not those exemptions are waived or in any other way altered because of any intended commercial use of the cell tower.

671
00:48:28,158 --> 00:48:39,403
Finally, if the ordinance which was not passed a few years back is enacted in some way, shape, or form right now, then the question could be, and there is no definitive answer to this, what effect

672
00:48:39,877 --> 00:48:43,539
a newly passed ordinance would be on this particular project.

673
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:59,107
Because the effective date or the notice date for the world, for the general public, so to speak, and you should always keep this in mind with a zoning enactment, is the date of publication before the planning board.

674
00:48:59,848 --> 00:49:07,432
For example, about 20 years ago or 25 years ago, there was a moratorium put in place for certain uses in the city of Medford.

675
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:11,061
that became effective when it was advertised before the planning board.

676
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:27,713
So if this ordinance went forth and was advertised before the planning board, that may well have some effect on this particular project, but that also would beg some other questions, like what exactly will the MBTA be using this tower for outside of serving its ridership?

677
00:49:28,573 --> 00:49:35,698
I know that sounds like a lot, but everything has to be broken down to its simplest elements, and we have to begin at the beginning.

678
00:49:36,186 --> 00:49:49,609
So the first domino to fall, and there are two concurrently, would be for the council to revive a look at that older ordinance that was proposed because procedurally it's not alive.

679
00:49:50,229 --> 00:50:01,991
And secondly, for all of the entities in the city of Medford, the various departments, et cetera, to craft carefully their concerns and to submit them under this notice period.

680
00:50:02,331 --> 00:50:05,272
And the very last thing I'd say before I yield to my good friend,

681
00:50:06,593 --> 00:50:26,865
is that the purpose of this notice period is, under the NEPA, to make certain determinations as to historical uses in the area, which is why the Royal House is a pertinent, in its distance away from this particular proposed cell tower, is pertinent.

682
00:50:27,606 --> 00:50:31,008
And that comes up under the National Environmental Policy Act.

683
00:50:31,888 --> 00:50:34,630
So there are the various elements of this matter.

684
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:37,607
and the various nuances that were presented with.

685
00:50:37,627 --> 00:50:42,969
Thank you.

686
00:50:42,989 --> 00:50:43,950
Name and address of the record, please.

687
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:49,352
Tom Lincoln, I'm an executive director of the Royal House and Slave Quarters at 15 George Street.

688
00:50:49,392 --> 00:50:53,014
I live at 27 Gleason Street in Medford.

689
00:50:53,634 --> 00:51:00,137
I'd like to thank Councillor Marks and also the city solicitor and Ken Kraus, who actually brought this in front of

690
00:51:00,968 --> 00:51:02,209
some of us in the community.

691
00:51:02,489 --> 00:51:07,131
The Royal House and Slave Quarters, as we can best figure it, is about 2,000 feet away.

692
00:51:08,071 --> 00:51:17,975
One thing that I think needs clarification, as I understand it, is that these are legal addresses, but the cell phone towers are actually proposed on the railroad right away.

693
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:22,284
I think you probably have to give the closest street address to there.

694
00:51:23,004 --> 00:51:33,215
But that said, the Royal House and Slave Quarters is a National Historic Landmark, which is the highest category of historic sites right here in Medford.

695
00:51:33,495 --> 00:51:35,857
We certainly preceded these cell phones by about 287 years.

696
00:51:39,791 --> 00:51:47,577
And we're concerned, as I've talked to some of my colleagues and people on the board at the Royal House and Slave Quarters, about the visual impact.

697
00:51:48,357 --> 00:51:57,284
74 feet, I'm not an expert on visual impacts, but 74 feet is 65, 75, 74 feet, whatever it is, is pretty high.

698
00:51:57,324 --> 00:51:59,946
I think it's higher than any building in the neighborhood.

699
00:51:59,986 --> 00:52:06,470
It's certainly higher than our, than the 1737 house that we have, as well as the Slave Quarters.

700
00:52:08,494 --> 00:52:15,456
It's also not clear, and I think it will be good to know, exactly what the consequences are of commenting.

701
00:52:15,556 --> 00:52:26,380
If it's just a comment period just to gather information, and if you don't have any statutory rights, et cetera, I'm not sure how much good that would do.

702
00:52:27,801 --> 00:52:31,642
So we're certainly, at the Royal House of Slave Hoarders, are concerned about this.

703
00:52:31,962 --> 00:52:37,584
We're certainly going to comment, along with the city departments,

704
00:52:38,372 --> 00:52:49,860
One thing, if you haven't been on a tour at the Royal House Slave Quarters recently, one thing we try to convey with our one acre left of 500 historic acres is the extent of the property.

705
00:52:50,101 --> 00:52:55,905
And so we do talk about the surrounding landscape and people certainly get a view of the neighborhood.

706
00:52:56,065 --> 00:53:07,293
And I'm trying to imagine what it might look like with the cell phone tower sticking up above every other house off of George Street and back in that adjacent neighborhood.

707
00:53:07,877 --> 00:53:24,822
The second place, which I wear several hats here, but the second place which may be affected, although I think visually may be not affected, is the Brooks Estate, which I believe is about a half a mile from the Tyler Avenue location.

708
00:53:24,842 --> 00:53:26,622
63, is it 63 Tyler?

709
00:53:28,303 --> 00:53:34,845
Is very close to Grove Street, up on the north end of Tyler there.

710
00:53:36,483 --> 00:53:45,885
The last point I would make, and I think this is certainly in the back of people's minds, if there are two towers being proposed today, what's in the future here?

711
00:53:47,466 --> 00:54:02,789
There are clearly some interesting and perhaps difficult jurisdictional issues in terms of the MBTA, et cetera, but the demand for bandwidth, as I understand it, the demand for services is certainly not going down.

712
00:54:06,257 --> 00:54:09,099
Going back to the cell phone side, there are certainly dead spots.

713
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:14,784
In fact, the Royal House, if you're inside the Royal House, it's very hard to get cell phone service for some reason.

714
00:54:16,285 --> 00:54:21,168
And I think that precedent is a thing to worry about here in terms of.

715
00:54:21,728 --> 00:54:27,813
And these are really, any way you look at it, these are really tall structures.

716
00:54:29,594 --> 00:54:31,756
In the past, in fact, this has happened in West Bedford,

717
00:54:32,988 --> 00:54:36,149
cell phone transmitters or whatever they are, or amplifiers, I guess.

718
00:54:36,949 --> 00:54:39,410
Cell phone service have been placed atop buildings.

719
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:40,530
They've been disguised.

720
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:43,631
There's no disguising these towers.

721
00:54:44,032 --> 00:54:54,855
So we look forward to learning more about this, and we look forward both to an effective ordinance and to a resolution of some of these issues.

722
00:54:54,915 --> 00:54:55,275
Thank you.

723
00:54:59,176 --> 00:54:59,536
Thank you.

724
00:55:00,677 --> 00:55:01,477
Name and address of the record.

725
00:55:02,957 --> 00:55:06,060
Doug Carr, 124 Boston Avenue in West Medford.

726
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,962
I, like Mr. Lincoln, I wear several hats here.

727
00:55:08,982 --> 00:55:11,043
I'm on the Medford Historic Commission.

728
00:55:11,884 --> 00:55:26,895
I'm a director of the Brooks City Land Trust, and I've also served as the former chair of the Green Line Extension Design and Working Group, which is currently dormant, but this is affected by the Green Line because of the property on Charnwood, which is directly abuts the

729
00:55:27,983 --> 00:55:30,004
future Green Line extension to Tufts.

730
00:55:30,844 --> 00:55:32,145
I want to echo what was said before.

731
00:55:32,205 --> 00:55:37,527
I think there's a, these are insanely large, very disruptive visually.

732
00:55:38,107 --> 00:55:41,309
They lower property values, frankly, for anyone within sight of them.

733
00:55:41,509 --> 00:55:45,731
Certainly the backyards of the people along Charnwood are not going to be enhanced by them.

734
00:55:47,151 --> 00:55:54,254
On the Memphis Historic Commission, we have reviewed at least a half a dozen cell tower proposals in the last few years.

735
00:55:55,115 --> 00:55:55,715
They've all been

736
00:55:56,982 --> 00:55:57,582
penthouses.

737
00:55:57,682 --> 00:56:01,784
They've all been on the sides of buildings, buried amongst mechanical equipment.

738
00:56:01,844 --> 00:56:07,826
They've never been freestanding because it's insane to even propose that in a dense city like the city of Medford.

739
00:56:07,846 --> 00:56:08,666
It's too disruptive.

740
00:56:09,306 --> 00:56:20,630
We've approved them because, well we didn't actually approve them, but we commented on them and we sometimes were able to guide them on things like paint colors or maybe shifting their location to be less visually intrusive.

741
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:21,150
But we

742
00:56:22,102 --> 00:56:25,143
They've always been rather intelligently proposed, and these are not.

743
00:56:25,543 --> 00:56:32,164
These are obviously in smack dab in the navel of the West Medford and the Hillside neighborhoods, and they're going to cause immeasurable damage.

744
00:56:32,944 --> 00:56:39,885
So there are plenty of buildings that are about 70 feet tall all along the railway, not far from these locations.

745
00:56:40,505 --> 00:56:44,706
We just need to push them a little bit to come up with a better design rather than the plain, simple drop.

746
00:56:45,086 --> 00:56:48,987
It's 75 feet to the top of equipment is what the drawings say that we all received today.

747
00:56:51,065 --> 00:56:54,266
basically go back to the drawing board and try again, try a better way to do it.

748
00:56:54,867 --> 00:56:57,448
Think of the Cummings building on Boston Ave, the U-Haul building.

749
00:56:57,848 --> 00:57:01,410
Think of several buildings along Tufts, not too far from Charnwood.

750
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:06,672
Those are perfectly logical places we could put these towers and nobody would ever see them.

751
00:57:07,252 --> 00:57:12,975
We just need to work better and start a dialogue, but tell them this is simply unacceptable.

752
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:17,803
I mean, the Grove Street slave wall is probably within 700 feet of the one in Playstead.

753
00:57:18,403 --> 00:57:20,885
This would be looming over the ball fields on Playstead.

754
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:25,888
I believe the royal house is within, I know the Brooks Estate, at least a portion with the ponds is within that half mile.

755
00:57:25,908 --> 00:57:36,616
So there's clearly some historic resources that the documents say there's no negative effect on in the 33 page document you all received today, which is simply not true.

756
00:57:37,236 --> 00:57:39,698
So we just need to basically pause

757
00:57:40,228 --> 00:57:41,348
and come up with a better solution.

758
00:57:41,388 --> 00:57:42,929
I'm convinced there is a good one here.

759
00:57:43,009 --> 00:57:44,729
We don't need to reinvent the wheel.

760
00:57:45,289 --> 00:57:46,990
It should not be put in these residential neighborhoods.

761
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:48,370
We do need to revise our zoning.

762
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:49,970
I completely agree with the council on that.

763
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:54,371
And I look forward to helping that make, make that occur in the very near future.

764
00:57:54,511 --> 00:57:54,852
Thank you.

765
00:57:55,292 --> 00:57:55,972
Thank you, Mr. Carr.

766
00:57:57,452 --> 00:57:58,232
Councilor Scott Pelley.

767
00:57:59,373 --> 00:58:00,673
Thank you, Mr. President.

768
00:58:01,253 --> 00:58:09,115
I know that back in the day when this resolution that council Mark's talking about was directly involved in the field of dreams committee and

769
00:58:10,238 --> 00:58:17,720
One of the biggest issues we had was that cell phone tower and the operation being built behind the high school.

770
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:27,622
And one of the biggest benefits for that American cell phone tower company at the time was how quickly and how much money they would make off of selling parts of that tower.

771
00:58:27,642 --> 00:58:35,804
What would be interesting to me is to see where else on the line that the T would be looking to put other towers.

772
00:58:36,104 --> 00:58:37,704
Because if you can, I think that

773
00:58:38,165 --> 00:58:39,286
would be a direct correlation.

774
00:58:39,326 --> 00:58:54,358
If you see it just, you know, not just Medford, but you see it down the line, I think it might help us in really understanding that they're using, I mean, let's all, you know, state the facts, the T's in huge financial difficulties.

775
00:58:54,818 --> 00:59:03,545
So I'd like to see that maybe if there's a way to ask them in our conversations, are we just looking in Medford or are they looking all the way down the line?

776
00:59:03,565 --> 00:59:05,847
Because if I think they, if they are doing that,

777
00:59:06,811 --> 00:59:18,036
I think this would be just a clear punch in the face that shows that they're using this for a revenue stream rather than what might be just discussed.

778
00:59:18,056 --> 00:59:24,618
So that'd be interesting to see if we can reach out and ask that question.

779
00:59:24,998 --> 00:59:27,860
If it's just Medford, are they putting those towers elsewhere?

780
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:31,181
It would be an interesting information.

781
00:59:31,221 --> 00:59:31,681
So thank you.

782
00:59:31,861 --> 00:59:33,582
Thank you, Councilor Scarpa.

783
00:59:33,682 --> 00:59:34,342
Vice President Max.

784
00:59:34,902 --> 00:59:35,803
Thank you, Mr. President.

785
00:59:37,102 --> 01:00:02,074
Just if I could, in addition to what was mentioned about the legal notice regarding the public input on national registered or historic places, I did speak to Paul Mulkey, the building commissioner, and he stated that the only requirement that he is aware of as building commissioner, if someone wants to erect a cell phone tower, is a building permit and an electrical permit.

786
01:00:02,734 --> 01:00:04,555
There's no other, there's no special permit,

787
01:00:05,287 --> 01:00:07,768
There's no other hoops that you have to jump through.

788
01:00:08,548 --> 01:00:15,810
And there may be a question regarding zoning setbacks, and that's something that's being looked at currently right now.

789
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:32,874
So at this point, Mr. President, I would ask that the original paper, 11-477, be sent to Solicitor Rumley, and that is the paper that includes

790
01:00:33,478 --> 01:00:54,382
The recommendations from the Community Development Board, which recommended that wireless towers only be constructed in the two most industrial zoning districts in the city, and that also, the board recommended the city council be the granting authority for special permits for towers in those zones.

791
01:00:54,862 --> 01:00:56,822
So those were the two recommendations that came out.

792
01:00:57,422 --> 01:01:01,763
National Grid also, to be in compliance with the two state statutes,

793
01:01:02,287 --> 01:01:08,811
a recommended language that would still allow them to put cell towers on their telephone poles.

794
01:01:08,891 --> 01:01:13,854
And I won't speak for the city solicitor, but I think that's something that we're obligated to do.

795
01:01:14,275 --> 01:01:16,936
We want to adhere to whatever state statute is.

796
01:01:17,637 --> 01:01:22,080
And this paper, Mr. President, I believe addresses all those concerns.

797
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:24,461
And it's a combination of all that input.

798
01:01:24,961 --> 01:01:30,005
I would also ask that my paper be referred to the committee of the whole.

799
01:01:30,665 --> 01:01:31,105
So paper 17-1.

800
01:01:32,885 --> 01:01:35,066
417 be referred to the Committee of the Whole.

801
01:01:35,506 --> 01:02:01,698
Once we get a response back from the city solicitor on paper 11-477 on the language, we can meet in the Committee of the Whole and hopefully we can push this ordinance through after three readings, Mr. President, and give the neighborhood the safeguards and the peace of mind that they deserve that these towers won't be popping up, Mr. President, in places that they're not welcomed.

802
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:02,912
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

803
01:02:03,613 --> 01:02:04,353
Counselor Knight.

804
01:02:04,873 --> 01:02:10,936
Mr. President, I feel as though the course of action that Counselor Marks just laid out makes perfect sense, and I would second the motion.

805
01:02:11,156 --> 01:02:11,656
Move approved.

806
01:02:13,017 --> 01:02:16,058
On the motion by Counselor Marks, seconded by Counselor Knight.

807
01:02:17,619 --> 01:02:18,339
All those in favor?

808
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:18,900
Aye.

809
01:02:20,561 --> 01:02:21,501
Motion passes.

810
01:02:23,222 --> 01:02:29,965
We will do our best to get a Council of the Whole within the next two weeks, seeing that our Council of the Whole's a little on the full side right now,

811
01:02:30,624 --> 01:02:32,285
Hopefully we can get it in before budget season.

812
01:02:34,447 --> 01:02:37,249
Yes, I'm sure the city solicitor will work diligently on it.

813
01:02:37,269 --> 01:02:38,089
Am I correct?

814
01:02:38,149 --> 01:02:41,372
Thank you.

815
01:02:41,392 --> 01:02:44,294
17-409 offered by Councilor Falco.

816
01:02:45,334 --> 01:02:59,084
Whereas the Memphis City Council will soon be reviewing the proposed city budget, be it resolved that the city administration send summarized seed clicks fixed data to the Memphis City Council

817
01:02:59,815 --> 01:03:03,136
to help aid budget decision making.

818
01:03:04,736 --> 01:03:05,936
Councilor Falco.

819
01:03:06,676 --> 01:03:07,736
Thank you, Mr. President.

820
01:03:07,996 --> 01:03:14,337
As we all know, budget season is upon us, and we will be meeting hopefully sooner than later with regard to the city budget.

821
01:03:14,978 --> 01:03:24,679
But I know during the budget deliberations, there's always plenty of questions as to what the different departments do and whatnot and what's being accomplished.

822
01:03:25,099 --> 01:03:29,060
So I just wanted to be proactive here and see if we could get a report.

823
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:34,181
a C-Click Fix report with regard to the items that are being reported.

824
01:03:34,201 --> 01:03:46,103
So I guess the issues that are being reported, the date they're being reported, the department that the issue is being assigned to, and the duration that it's taking for these issues to get fixed.

825
01:03:46,843 --> 01:03:51,444
I think it would be good to actually have that information when we go into budget deliberations.

826
01:03:52,704 --> 01:03:55,145
Data-driven decision-making I don't think is a bad thing.

827
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:56,965
I think it's good to actually have that information

828
01:03:57,507 --> 01:04:11,915
when we're negotiating the budget, I think it would benefit all of us to get a true picture as to, you know, what different departments are doing on a daily basis and to see what, you know, different problems are occurring throughout the city and, you know, how long it's taking to get these fixed.

829
01:04:12,656 --> 01:04:16,818
So I would ask for some support and move approval.

830
01:04:17,459 --> 01:04:17,679
Thank you.

831
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:34,136
Mr. President, this is a great resolution, and I don't think anybody behind this rail is going to vote against it, especially based on the fact that when C-Click Fix was rolled out, we've asked for quarterly reports, and those quarterly reports were not forthcoming.

832
01:04:34,956 --> 01:04:37,217
I thank Councilor Falco for putting this resolution on.

833
01:04:37,337 --> 01:04:44,220
I also thank him for his foresight in starting to think about the budget at this early time, not really early, but earlier than usual.

834
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:49,942
So I certainly wholeheartedly support this request, Mr. President, and I would like to add a B paper.

835
01:04:50,466 --> 01:04:55,410
uh, requesting that the council reiterate its request to receive quarterly reports from C-Click fix.

836
01:04:58,833 --> 01:05:04,498
On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso as amended by Councilor Knight.

837
01:05:05,659 --> 01:05:06,439
All those in favor?

838
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,863
Motion passes.

839
01:05:10,883 --> 01:05:14,846
17 4 1 0 offered by Councilor Scott Pelli.

840
01:05:15,767 --> 01:05:19,430
Be it resolved that the city council discuss signage

841
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,182
located on public lands.

842
01:05:22,802 --> 01:05:24,083
Councilor Scarpelli.

843
01:05:24,163 --> 01:05:25,804
Thank you, Mr. President.

844
01:05:27,686 --> 01:05:49,882
This is multifaceted, but I think that a few of the concerns that I'd like to address that we like answered from the Department of Public Works is looking at our ordinances and what we're asking our constituents to follow at our local ball fields and looking at the signs that are there now and making sure they're

845
01:05:50,283 --> 01:05:57,886
They're updated and the graffiti is removed from some of them or replaced if we can.

846
01:05:58,446 --> 01:06:09,050
And second, that we look at, I've had a few phone calls that the private entities are using public land to advertise.

847
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:18,533
One constituent called and mentioned that there was a painting company that was putting their signage in front of their

848
01:06:19,098 --> 01:06:20,378
public land in front of their home.

849
01:06:20,719 --> 01:06:24,000
And they thought the question was the city approving that.

850
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,320
Is that something that I have to keep there?

851
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:31,902
So, um, I'd like to get, uh, you know what, if we can look into what department can answer that for us.

852
01:06:32,422 --> 01:06:46,067
And if there is no such go to the code enforcement officer, if you look at the code enforcement officer and ask that, that they then remove all the signs located on islands and in front of homes that have

853
01:06:47,115 --> 01:06:55,420
patches of grass that they're just putting down these lawn signs of private entities for advertising.

854
01:06:55,480 --> 01:07:01,823
So, other than the Scott Pelley for Council, I think that we should definitely look into that.

855
01:07:02,203 --> 01:07:03,104
Thank you.

856
01:07:03,624 --> 01:07:13,809
If I could amend that, that the building department also look at all the A-frames that are littering our sidewalks, which aren't supposed to be there either.

857
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:14,930
Thank you.

858
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:20,992
On the motion by Councilor Scott Pelley, seconded by Councilor Falco.

859
01:07:21,052 --> 01:07:21,652
All those in favor?

860
01:07:21,672 --> 01:07:21,772
Aye.

861
01:07:22,732 --> 01:07:25,834
Motion passes.

862
01:07:25,854 --> 01:07:27,655
17-411 offered by Councilor Knight.

863
01:07:28,735 --> 01:07:45,422
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council thank Heidi Riccio for her four years of service to Medford Public Schools as vocational school principal and be it further resolved that the Medford City Council wish her all the best of luck in her new position at

864
01:07:46,283 --> 01:07:51,108
of Career and Technical Education Director at Essex Technical High School.

865
01:07:54,933 --> 01:07:55,573
Councilor Knight.

866
01:07:56,014 --> 01:07:57,476
Mr. President, thank you very much.

867
01:07:57,496 --> 01:07:59,618
I think I might need a box of tissues for this one.

868
01:08:00,379 --> 01:08:07,226
A couple of weeks ago we saw Director Riccio here and she put in a great presentation concerning the capital needs and a request for

869
01:08:08,502 --> 01:08:11,684
authorizing a grant proposal to go up to the Department of Education.

870
01:08:12,324 --> 01:08:20,508
And we all commented about the work that she's done in her short time here in Medford and how she's moved the vocational school eons and eons ahead of where it was.

871
01:08:20,548 --> 01:08:25,051
She's broke down the invisible wall between the high school and the vocational school.

872
01:08:25,071 --> 01:08:26,252
She's added programming.

873
01:08:26,892 --> 01:08:29,773
The programming that's been added has had a great impact on our bottom line.

874
01:08:29,873 --> 01:08:34,636
It's had an ability to prevent kids from transferring out of district to go to other schools that provide

875
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:37,642
programming that we didn't provide.

876
01:08:37,722 --> 01:08:46,648
So, Mr. President, it's with great sadness, but also great pleasure to see Heidi moving on to something that is really worthwhile.

877
01:08:46,988 --> 01:08:49,110
And it's an opportunity that she can't say no to.

878
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:52,912
But it's with great sadness to see her to go because she's done great things in the city of Medford.

879
01:08:53,493 --> 01:08:56,955
And it's really just too bad that we have to see her go.

880
01:08:56,995 --> 01:09:01,478
I wish we could have done more to recruit and keep her here, but we can't make people move closer to Medford, Mr. President.

881
01:09:01,518 --> 01:09:03,620
She had quite a commute coming in there every day.

882
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:09,663
With that being said, I'd ask my colleagues to support this resolution and wish her the best of luck and thank her for her service to the city.

883
01:09:10,123 --> 01:09:10,463
Thank you.

884
01:09:11,664 --> 01:09:12,504
Councilor Scott Pelli.

885
01:09:12,865 --> 01:09:16,446
If I can, when the news broke, I did contact Ms.

886
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:32,375
Riccio and as she wept over the phone and the decisions she had to make, I think the key decision to make her in this move was that her family,

887
01:09:33,042 --> 01:09:33,904
needed to come first.

888
01:09:33,925 --> 01:09:41,445
She had two children that she was commuting up to four hours a day and her commute is now, would be 20 minutes.

889
01:09:42,513 --> 01:09:49,078
Her commitment to finishing the projects that she envisioned and she shared with us in the last month.

890
01:09:50,039 --> 01:10:01,468
She has already told her future employer that she would make sure that she needs to finish those jobs and make sure they're completed before she moves on.

891
01:10:01,928 --> 01:10:04,010
That's typical Heidi Riccio.

892
01:10:05,691 --> 01:10:08,513
Again, being one of the school committee members that

893
01:10:10,856 --> 01:10:19,621
brought her to Medford and to see her vision come to fruition was amazing.

894
01:10:19,701 --> 01:10:23,823
So I'm going to miss her in many different ways.

895
01:10:24,744 --> 01:10:33,989
She's been a great example how you can use different avenues to grow a major part of our community.

896
01:10:34,009 --> 01:10:35,090
That's our vocational school.

897
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:38,792
So thank you, Councilor Knight, for bringing this forward.

898
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:40,911
And we also wish her luck.

899
01:10:41,972 --> 01:10:43,112
Thank you, Councilor Scott Pelli.

900
01:10:43,132 --> 01:10:43,913
Councilor Falco.

901
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:45,634
Thank you, President Calvillo.

902
01:10:45,994 --> 01:10:48,415
And also thank you to Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

903
01:10:48,996 --> 01:10:55,639
I had the opportunity, along with Councilor Scott Pelli, when we were on the school committee, to hire Heidi Riccio.

904
01:10:55,739 --> 01:11:00,882
And hands down, I think one of the best moves that we made when we were on the school committee.

905
01:11:03,104 --> 01:11:07,326
Heidi was just, I mean, her commitment is unquestionable.

906
01:11:07,446 --> 01:11:09,087
I mean, the work that she did in four years,

907
01:11:09,595 --> 01:11:17,936
to really turn that school around and to just bring vocational education back to life is amazing.

908
01:11:18,016 --> 01:11:25,558
I mean, the programs that she brought to the school, just the passion that she brings to the job is amazing.

909
01:11:26,058 --> 01:11:28,858
And she just did a phenomenal job over four years.

910
01:11:28,898 --> 01:11:34,859
She's going to definitely be missed, but she did a fabulous job while she was here.

911
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:36,200
So I just want to say good luck.

912
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:38,640
And I think, you know, I mean,

913
01:11:39,183 --> 01:11:42,624
It's hard to see her go, but family comes first, and I understand that completely.

914
01:11:42,804 --> 01:11:44,284
And I just want to wish her well.

915
01:11:44,624 --> 01:11:44,964
Thank you.

916
01:11:46,605 --> 01:11:47,325
Council Member Kern.

917
01:11:47,625 --> 01:11:48,985
Thank you, President Carvillo.

918
01:11:49,005 --> 01:11:51,986
I just want to thank Councilman Lanai for bringing this forward.

919
01:11:52,006 --> 01:11:53,546
I thank Ms.

920
01:11:53,586 --> 01:11:55,187
Riccio for all the work she's done.

921
01:11:55,207 --> 01:12:03,489
It goes to show how much she has done when you have parents calling you upset that a director is leaving.

922
01:12:03,589 --> 01:12:08,830
So it goes to show all the hard work that she's put into the program, which she explained to us in part.

923
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:17,086
a few weeks ago, and she really impressed me before the council that night, and then a week later, she is now leaving.

924
01:12:17,186 --> 01:12:30,116
But I wish her the best of luck, and I hope that we are able to find somebody as enthusiastic and hardworking as her to keep the programs alive and going strong, and create more opportunities for our younger generation.

925
01:12:30,156 --> 01:12:35,921
So I want to thank her for that, and hope that we can fill her shoes to the best of our ability.

926
01:12:36,982 --> 01:12:38,323
Thank you, Councilwoman O'Connor.

927
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:43,911
Again, to that point, again, Mr. President, I know I forgot, but I wanted to make sure that when I talked to Ms.

928
01:12:43,951 --> 01:13:08,397
Riccio, one of the things she was so proud of was the fact that when we as a school committee years ago looked for a new director, I believe we classified the three finalists as used car salesmen, and then coming across Heidi Riccio, what she mentioned to me that four years ago, Medford wasn't even,

929
01:13:08,890 --> 01:13:13,091
in the world of vocational education wasn't even on the map.

930
01:13:14,691 --> 01:13:27,074
And the interest gathered already from phone calls that vocational experts have been contacting her to apply for this job is astonishing.

931
01:13:27,154 --> 01:13:35,556
So I can't wait to see what happens, but I know she's definitely helping with that piece, moving it forward.

932
01:13:35,616 --> 01:13:38,237
So I want to let our parents know that

933
01:13:38,725 --> 01:13:40,646
It's definitely different than it was four years ago.

934
01:13:41,146 --> 01:13:50,730
There'll be a line at the superintendent's door waiting to pass in their resumes for an opportunity to be the director of that program, so thank you.

935
01:13:50,930 --> 01:13:52,470
Thank you, Counselor Scott Pelley.

936
01:13:53,291 --> 01:13:56,832
Very big shoes to fill there, and I wish her well on her new endeavor.

937
01:13:57,212 --> 01:14:00,433
On the motion by Counselor Knight, seconded by Counselor Scott Pelley.

938
01:14:00,473 --> 01:14:01,114
All those in favor?

939
01:14:01,134 --> 01:14:01,194
Aye.

940
01:14:02,074 --> 01:14:02,974
Motion passes.

941
01:14:03,575 --> 01:14:06,976
Motion by Counselor Knight to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

942
01:14:08,813 --> 01:14:10,494
seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

943
01:14:10,774 --> 01:14:15,435
All those in favor?

944
01:14:15,495 --> 01:14:15,995
Aye.

945
01:14:16,015 --> 01:14:26,559
17415, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council wish lifelong resident, Mary O'Sullivan, a very happy 90th birthday.

946
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:27,919
Councilor Knight.

947
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:31,142
Yes, Mr. President, hopefully Mary's still at home watching this evening.

948
01:14:31,402 --> 01:14:35,525
I know we had a few things we had to take care of at the beginning of the meeting, and we couldn't take this up under suspension.

949
01:14:36,365 --> 01:14:39,948
But Mary was born and raised in the city of Medford, has been a lifelong resident.

950
01:14:40,128 --> 01:14:43,650
She raised her four children, Maureen, Paul, John, and Julie here in the community.

951
01:14:44,451 --> 01:14:47,052
Her sister Anne still resides in Medford with her husband.

952
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:51,375
And she has three grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

953
01:14:51,415 --> 01:14:53,537
So we'd like to join me in wishing

954
01:14:54,767 --> 01:14:54,947
Ms.

955
01:14:55,007 --> 01:14:58,550
O'Sullivan, a very happy 90th birthday, Mr. President, and many more to come.

956
01:14:59,131 --> 01:15:01,052
Thank you, Counselor Knight, and happy birthday.

957
01:15:03,915 --> 01:15:15,445
Offered by Counselor Marks, be it resolved that Mae Marbrek, founder of Friends of Cheval Auditorium and GMAC gym, be recognized for her 25 years of distinguished service.

958
01:15:15,525 --> 01:15:16,466
Vice President Marks.

959
01:15:17,326 --> 01:15:18,367
Thank you, Mr. President.

960
01:15:18,467 --> 01:15:20,289
It's my honor to stand up for

961
01:15:20,991 --> 01:15:23,873
such a tremendous person in this community.

962
01:15:24,874 --> 01:15:31,358
We all know May Makibrecht very well for her passion and her commitment to this community.

963
01:15:31,378 --> 01:15:42,106
You know, May was the founder of the Friends of Chevalier Auditorium in Gene Mack Gym, and she served for the past 25 years as a board member.

964
01:15:42,506 --> 01:15:43,847
I think that speaks volumes

965
01:15:44,332 --> 01:15:54,864
on her commitment, not only to Chevalier Auditorium, but also to the Method Boys and Girls Club, which she was very passionate about, Mr. President.

966
01:15:55,765 --> 01:15:59,550
May also served as a board member on the Brooks Estates Land Trust.

967
01:16:00,097 --> 01:16:12,504
I believe for, is still serving, close to 18 or 19 years, a member of CACHE, and also the Method Arts Council, and numerous other activities in the community.

968
01:16:13,765 --> 01:16:23,250
May has been there, she's someone that you can count on, someone that will always listen, Mr. President, and try to assist, and never look for anything in return.

969
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:28,653
And I just wanna really wish her well, and honor her

970
01:16:29,089 --> 01:16:37,975
before the Memphis City Council for her many years of community service through a citation of this council, Mr. President.

971
01:16:38,615 --> 01:16:52,244
And I would ask that that be done within the next week or so to get May up here and congratulate her for not only being the founding member of the Friends of Chevalier Auditorium, but also for

972
01:16:52,633 --> 01:16:56,036
her commitment to the community at large, Mr. President.

973
01:16:56,596 --> 01:17:02,400
She is going to be honored at the next board meeting of the Friends of Chevalier, if anyone wants to go to that.

974
01:17:02,981 --> 01:17:03,621
Councilor Nights.

975
01:17:04,622 --> 01:17:06,784
I second the resolution, Mr. President, move for approval.

976
01:17:06,804 --> 01:17:10,607
I think it's also important to point out she is a member of the Medford Mustang Hall of Fame.

977
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:13,269
Former Citizen of the Year, also.

978
01:17:13,329 --> 01:17:14,269
Former Citizen of the Year.

979
01:17:15,731 --> 01:17:16,531
Councilor Lococoon.

980
01:17:16,631 --> 01:17:17,692
Thank you, President Carvalho.

981
01:17:17,712 --> 01:17:19,894
I was gonna mention that, former Citizen of the Year.

982
01:17:21,914 --> 01:17:29,860
done so much for this city on a volunteer basis, which is the reason why she was the citizen of the year a few years back.

983
01:17:30,361 --> 01:17:32,462
And I want to thank her for her service.

984
01:17:33,163 --> 01:17:41,609
She is being honored on May 18 at 7 PM at Maple Park Condominiums Community Room, 65 Valley Street in Medford.

985
01:17:42,390 --> 01:17:48,275
So whether we give her a citation here or at that meeting, I just want to thank her for all her service.

986
01:17:49,367 --> 01:17:49,827
Tremendous.

987
01:17:50,027 --> 01:17:50,827
Thank you, Counselor.

988
01:17:51,027 --> 01:17:58,829
An outstanding woman, and not only has she been a mentor to me, but she's been a good friend for many years.

989
01:17:59,649 --> 01:18:00,309
Counselor Falco.

990
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:01,109
Thank you.

991
01:18:01,149 --> 01:18:04,890
I just want to say thank you to Maya.

992
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:13,291
She's been an amazing citizen, been involved in so many organizations through the years, and her commitment is fabulous.

993
01:18:13,311 --> 01:18:17,772
She's done a great job, and I just want to say thank you for all your years of service to our community.

994
01:18:18,212 --> 01:18:18,472
Thank you.

995
01:18:19,188 --> 01:18:26,114
On the motion by Councilor Mox that we have May Marbrick come up here for a citation, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

996
01:18:27,175 --> 01:18:27,875
All those in favor?

997
01:18:27,895 --> 01:18:27,955
Aye.

998
01:18:28,896 --> 01:18:29,717
Motion passes.

999
01:18:31,638 --> 01:18:43,448
Offered by Vice President Mox be it resolved that the tree stumps located at 51 Woods Road, 56 Woods Road and 18 Wellington Road be removed.

1000
01:18:44,109 --> 01:18:45,150
Vice President Mox.

1001
01:18:46,111 --> 01:18:47,131
Thank you, Mr. President.

1002
01:18:48,997 --> 01:19:00,506
There are still a number of stumps, Mr. President, throughout this community that appear to be on the stump list, but for whatever reason are taking forever to remove from in front of residents' homes.

1003
01:19:01,167 --> 01:19:10,775
These are three that were brought to my attention just recently over the weekend, and I know there are literally tens and tens more, Mr. President.

1004
01:19:10,795 --> 01:19:16,119
I would ask that these be removed immediately in the interest of public safety.

1005
01:19:16,597 --> 01:19:19,799
And also, Mr. President, that we receive an updated list.

1006
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:28,345
We were asked, I believe it was eight months ago, maybe a year, for monies to do sidewalk and stump removal.

1007
01:19:28,705 --> 01:19:42,955
If we can get an updated list on where we stand with that, and the age of the stumps, as we've talked about, Mr. President, ad nauseum before this council, and that we get a report back from the Commissioner, Brian Kerentz.

1008
01:19:44,032 --> 01:19:44,852
Council Member Kern.

1009
01:19:45,112 --> 01:19:46,273
Thank you, President Carviello.

1010
01:19:47,413 --> 01:19:49,013
Thank you for bringing this up, Councilor Marks.

1011
01:19:49,073 --> 01:19:56,115
I also have been getting repeated emails if we could add 17, 48, and 61 Doonan Street.

1012
01:19:56,675 --> 01:20:09,099
Those stumps have been there for a very long time, and I did request through an email to Mr. Cairns that they would be removed if we could get a status on that and vote in favor of removing those stumps.

1013
01:20:09,932 --> 01:20:14,313
People get sick and tired of stumps in their neighborhoods and on their streets.

1014
01:20:14,393 --> 01:20:15,873
And it's understandable.

1015
01:20:15,933 --> 01:20:16,653
It's an eyesore.

1016
01:20:17,193 --> 01:20:18,693
So if we could get those removed.

1017
01:20:18,874 --> 01:20:21,054
It's also a public safety issue.

1018
01:20:21,254 --> 01:20:21,934
So thank you.

1019
01:20:23,294 --> 01:20:23,854
Councilor Knight.

1020
01:20:24,274 --> 01:20:25,295
Yes, Mr. President.

1021
01:20:25,375 --> 01:20:27,555
Thank you very much, Councilor Moxley, for bringing this resolution forward.

1022
01:20:27,615 --> 01:20:30,856
I, too, had a conversation with Public Works Director Cairns this afternoon.

1023
01:20:31,396 --> 01:20:36,216
And he's informed me that there will be two sidewalk crews that will be out in the coming weeks.

1024
01:20:36,737 --> 01:20:38,077
One of the crews is a city crew.

1025
01:20:38,137 --> 01:20:39,617
One of the crews is a National Grid crew.

1026
01:20:40,418 --> 01:20:55,065
The National Grid crew will be dealing with sidewalk panels that they've disturbed during their construction over the last year, and the city crew will be working on the stump and sidewalk money that we appropriated some months back, Mr. President.

1027
01:20:55,365 --> 01:20:56,986
But I appreciate the resolution going forward.

1028
01:20:57,026 --> 01:20:58,627
I support it wholeheartedly, and I move for approval.

1029
01:20:59,207 --> 01:20:59,867
Councilor Falco.

1030
01:21:00,908 --> 01:21:01,788
Thank you, President Caviello.

1031
01:21:01,808 --> 01:21:03,829
I just want to thank Councilor Moxley for bringing this forward.

1032
01:21:03,889 --> 01:21:06,610
If we could also add 23 Fulton Street to the list.

1033
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:24,984
I got a call about that recently, and I'm glad, and actually, I believe the list that Councilor Mox had mentioned was supposed to be forwarded to us a while ago, so I'm glad that you mentioned that as well, because we should get an updated list to see what kind of progress is being made.

1034
01:21:25,464 --> 01:21:27,085
A lot of money has gone into this, so.

1035
01:21:27,965 --> 01:21:28,285
Thank you.

1036
01:21:28,325 --> 01:21:28,625
Thank you.

1037
01:21:30,106 --> 01:21:38,248
On the motion by Councilor, by Vice President Mox, as amended by Councilor Longo Kern and Councilor Falco,

1038
01:21:38,887 --> 01:21:40,789
and seconded by Councilor Longo Kern.

1039
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:42,370
All those in favor?

1040
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:42,450
Aye.

1041
01:21:43,611 --> 01:21:44,692
Motion passes.

1042
01:21:45,493 --> 01:22:03,930
Offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the city administration provide a copy of the city's affordable housing plan and be it further resolved that the city report back to the council that the percentage of housing units in the city that are considered affordable.

1043
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:04,771
Councilor Knight.

1044
01:22:05,996 --> 01:22:07,257
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1045
01:22:07,297 --> 01:22:10,818
There's been much discussion about development in the community, much discussion about zoning.

1046
01:22:12,058 --> 01:22:23,283
One thing that we all need to be wary of is Chapter 40B of the General Laws, which allows developers to bypass the local zoning laws if the city of Medford is not at its threshold established by the state standard for affordable housing.

1047
01:22:23,903 --> 01:22:28,265
So I'd ask that the administration provide those reports to us so that we can take a look at them as we prepare our discussions.

1048
01:22:29,745 --> 01:22:30,106
Thank you.

1049
01:22:30,166 --> 01:22:33,567
On the motion by Councilor Naife, seconded by Councilor Dela Rousseau,

1050
01:22:34,703 --> 01:22:35,483
All those in favour?

1051
01:22:36,344 --> 01:22:37,265
Motion passes.

1052
01:22:38,766 --> 01:22:44,249
If I can set a reminder out, Saturday is Clippership Day in the city of Medford.

1053
01:22:45,229 --> 01:22:52,834
If everyone can come out and attend, it's something that's been brought back, that's been gone for a while, and I hope everybody can attend.

1054
01:22:53,274 --> 01:22:54,255
Councillor Longo-Kearns.

1055
01:22:54,832 --> 01:22:59,173
Thank you, I just had a feeling you were going to maybe forget the details by the way you were ending that.

1056
01:23:00,193 --> 01:23:02,994
12 to, 12 p.m.

1057
01:23:03,054 --> 01:23:03,894
to 9 p.m.

1058
01:23:03,974 --> 01:23:18,777
right in the center of Medford Square, there's going to be a cornhole tournament, a number of activities for the children, beer and wine, a stage, you may know better more of what's going on on the stage, I forget, but it's going to be a great family event.

1059
01:23:18,977 --> 01:23:21,057
The street's going to be closed off, hopefully

1060
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:29,722
parking won't, I don't think parking's gonna be an issue if that issue is cleared up, but it's gonna be a great day, a lot of family fun, and great community day.

1061
01:23:30,142 --> 01:23:30,903
Good community fun.

1062
01:23:32,423 --> 01:23:32,763
Thank you.

1063
01:23:34,824 --> 01:23:35,564
Vice President Mox.

1064
01:23:36,324 --> 01:23:44,226
Just if I could, Mr. President, I had the opportunity this past Saturday to attend the community cleanup, which we refer to as Earth Day.

1065
01:23:45,967 --> 01:23:51,068
We had cleanups in Haines Square, West Meffitt Square, right here in the heart of Meffitt Square,

1066
01:23:51,552 --> 01:23:55,955
The Brooks Estates held a cleanup, McDonnell Park, along the Mystic River.

1067
01:23:56,736 --> 01:23:59,178
And there were many, many volunteers out that day.

1068
01:23:59,878 --> 01:24:00,979
It was a beautiful day.

1069
01:24:01,759 --> 01:24:05,622
The Mystic River Watershed Association had many volunteers.

1070
01:24:06,103 --> 01:24:11,366
Meffitt Community Coalition organized their group, and they did a tremendous job here in Meffitt Square.

1071
01:24:12,127 --> 01:24:15,149
The Chamber of Commerce also was very instrumental.

1072
01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:18,952
Members of MBELT helped at the Brooks Estates.

1073
01:24:21,015 --> 01:24:34,587
DPW, I just want to thank personally Steve Tanaglia, who did a tremendous job, Mr. President, in making sure that there were brooms and rakes and bags and things were picked up after all this trash was picked up.

1074
01:24:34,967 --> 01:24:38,970
So I want to thank everyone in the community for a great cleanup day.

1075
01:24:39,711 --> 01:24:42,153
And secondly, Mr. President,

1076
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:47,101
I think it's only appropriate that the Farmer's Market will be moving.

1077
01:24:47,861 --> 01:24:56,703
We all know it's been in Meffitt Square for a number of years, and they have a new location, which will be the Condon Shell on Mystic Valley Parkway.

1078
01:24:57,464 --> 01:25:03,025
And the first Farmer's Market will be June 8th, and it's gonna run until October 12th.

1079
01:25:03,565 --> 01:25:05,605
It's gonna be from three to seven p.m.

1080
01:25:06,366 --> 01:25:09,046
every Thursday from June 8th to October 12th.

1081
01:25:09,806 --> 01:25:11,807
And there's plenty of parking there,

1082
01:25:12,821 --> 01:25:19,144
running water and electricity, and supposedly it's gonna be a great location for the market itself.

1083
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:24,007
Also, Mr. President, I just wanna bring up Circle the Square.

1084
01:25:24,707 --> 01:25:35,232
We all know that for several weeks during the June, July months, I believe up until August, they run Circle the Square.

1085
01:25:36,053 --> 01:25:38,254
This year, they're only gonna run it once.

1086
01:25:39,034 --> 01:25:42,156
There's gonna be one Circle the Square date, that is Thursday,

1087
01:25:42,609 --> 01:25:44,911
June 15th from 3.30 to 7.30.

1088
01:25:46,632 --> 01:25:56,098
And the reasoning they're only gonna have one is because there is exciting renovations being made on Riverside Plaza, on Riverside Ave.

1089
01:25:56,998 --> 01:26:09,387
And I guess for that reason, Circle the Square will only have one date this year, which I'm not sure why they can't use other parts of the square, but that's the notice that went out.

1090
01:26:10,007 --> 01:26:11,508
Also, Mr. President, if I could,

1091
01:26:12,119 --> 01:26:13,461
I've got a wealth of knowledge tonight.

1092
01:26:13,741 --> 01:26:14,042
What's that?

1093
01:26:14,222 --> 01:26:15,123
Wealth of knowledge tonight.

1094
01:26:15,263 --> 01:26:16,925
Well, it's important, Mr. President.

1095
01:26:18,187 --> 01:26:18,988
Upcoming events.

1096
01:26:19,148 --> 01:26:21,551
Cachet has an arts and cultural calendar.

1097
01:26:22,392 --> 01:26:23,553
Back pocket dances.

1098
01:26:23,634 --> 01:26:25,135
I think Councilor Scott Pelley.

1099
01:26:26,477 --> 01:26:28,680
I've heard people say you're in the back pocket.

1100
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:29,601
Is it not dances?

1101
01:26:30,746 --> 01:26:32,447
Oh, it's dance, okay.

1102
01:26:33,207 --> 01:26:37,889
Back Pocket Dance is Saturday, May 6th from 3 p.m.

1103
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:39,330
and 7.30 p.m.

1104
01:26:39,710 --> 01:26:53,857
at the Meffitt Senior Center, 101 Riverside Ave, and then Bluegrass and Beyond, I think Councilor De La Russa likes Bluegrass, a night of American music, and that's gonna be Saturday, May 13th at Chevalier Theater at 8 p.m.

1105
01:26:54,257 --> 01:26:55,518
Mr. President, all welcomed.

1106
01:26:56,112 --> 01:27:03,656
and the Friends of the Memphis Public Library book sale, Saturday, May 20th, and Sunday, the 21st, at all various times.

1107
01:27:05,077 --> 01:27:06,978
And that's all for today, Mr. President.

1108
01:27:06,998 --> 01:27:07,839
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1109
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:08,799
Councilor Knight.

1110
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:12,382
Mr. President, I'm very surprised that Councilor Marks missed one.

1111
01:27:13,382 --> 01:27:14,623
The airplane noise meeting.

1112
01:27:14,683 --> 01:27:15,043
That's right.

1113
01:27:15,083 --> 01:27:15,463
Monday.

1114
01:27:15,683 --> 01:27:16,144
Monday night.

1115
01:27:17,384 --> 01:27:17,745
7 p.m.

1116
01:27:18,005 --> 01:27:23,368
in the council chambers, and representatives from the Massport CLC will be there.

1117
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:25,460
Thank you, Councilor Layton.

1118
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:26,521
Councilor Falco.

1119
01:27:26,661 --> 01:27:28,021
Thank you, President Caviello.

1120
01:27:28,041 --> 01:27:29,202
You have more information for us.

1121
01:27:29,302 --> 01:27:35,324
I actually, I am surprised that everyone missed this one, but tomorrow night is the Medford Police Community Meeting.

1122
01:27:35,804 --> 01:27:38,765
It is at the Medford Senior Center, and it starts at 6 p.m.

1123
01:27:39,365 --> 01:27:40,165
Everyone is welcome.

1124
01:27:40,486 --> 01:27:41,526
Thank you, Councilor Falco.

1125
01:27:41,546 --> 01:27:50,549
Oh, and if I may really quick, I was also at the cleanup this weekend in the square, so thank you to the Medford Community Coalition and to the DPW department as well.

1126
01:27:50,569 --> 01:27:51,649
Everybody did a fine job.

1127
01:27:51,889 --> 01:27:53,210
Many of our city councilors were there.

1128
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:56,520
Would you like to speak?

1129
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:57,761
Name and address for the record, please.

1130
01:27:57,801 --> 01:28:00,262
Valerie Geiselman, Medford, Massachusetts.

1131
01:28:00,562 --> 01:28:12,046
I wanted to thank Councilor Marks for just giving a list of all those dates, and I wondered if there's a place where we can easily find all the dates of the events that are happening in Medford, and I'll tell you my reason why.

1132
01:28:12,927 --> 01:28:21,230
On the way here to the meeting, I stopped in at this new restaurant, and I think it's pronounced Zam Zam, and they have Pakistani and

1133
01:28:22,087 --> 01:28:26,328
Indian Cuisine, it's the second time I've stopped in there, and they seem like a lovely place.

1134
01:28:26,728 --> 01:28:32,389
I asked them if they knew about participating in the June 4th event, Medford Day, they didn't even know about it.

1135
01:28:32,869 --> 01:28:34,549
And I mentioned a few other things to them.

1136
01:28:34,909 --> 01:28:45,691
And when the new petitioners, we're also speaking tonight, the ones that are, let's see, taking over the, I'm trying to see.

1137
01:28:45,731 --> 01:28:47,211
Picky's Pizza and Helen's Roast Beef.

1138
01:28:47,792 --> 01:28:48,192
What'd you say?

1139
01:28:48,592 --> 01:28:50,312
Picky's Pizza and Helen's Roast Beef.

1140
01:28:51,193 --> 01:28:55,015
Yes, Pinky's Pizza and Helen's Roast Beef.

1141
01:28:55,635 --> 01:29:05,319
And I went out to speak to them and welcomed them to Medford, and I was so happy some of these are in my neighborhood, and I'd be happy when they're opening up and the places aren't empty anymore.

1142
01:29:05,699 --> 01:29:10,201
And I asked them about June 4th, if they would be interested in participating, and they didn't even know about it.

1143
01:29:10,241 --> 01:29:15,123
And they didn't know about the events that happen up at Tufts College, where they might be able to participate.

1144
01:29:15,487 --> 01:29:21,410
And I just wonder if there's any way we could have some ambassadors to welcome these new businesses in Medford.

1145
01:29:21,450 --> 01:29:29,574
It's so wonderful to have them coming in, and we know what a risk it is for, especially young people or anybody, any age, to start a new business in Medford.

1146
01:29:29,674 --> 01:29:30,194
That would be you.

1147
01:29:32,656 --> 01:29:32,996
Thank you.

1148
01:29:34,817 --> 01:29:35,937
How about the high school kids?

1149
01:29:35,997 --> 01:29:37,258
I mean, this is a wonderful thing.

1150
01:29:37,298 --> 01:29:38,419
We have a chamber of commerce.

1151
01:29:38,459 --> 01:29:39,719
There's Facebook.

1152
01:29:39,739 --> 01:29:42,341
There's multiple outlets for these people

1153
01:29:43,817 --> 01:29:45,779
uh, multiple resources for them to find out.

1154
01:29:45,819 --> 01:29:46,860
They don't know about them.

1155
01:29:46,940 --> 01:29:48,302
And I think we need to reach out.

1156
01:29:48,362 --> 01:29:50,884
If they were good business people, they would, they would know.

1157
01:29:51,325 --> 01:29:53,026
We want them to be good business people.

1158
01:29:53,167 --> 01:29:59,673
So if we have to help educate them so they can have a successful business of Medford, I think it would be good to have some ambassadors to do that.

1159
01:30:00,053 --> 01:30:00,414
Thank you.

1160
01:30:00,714 --> 01:30:01,275
Counselor knife.

1161
01:30:01,515 --> 01:30:06,560
Mr. President motion to request that the administration examined the feasibility of allowing the senior citizen

1162
01:30:07,019 --> 01:30:14,261
Abatement program to work as ambassadors between new businesses in the community in City Hall Thank you on the motion by councillor night seconded by councillor.

1163
01:30:14,501 --> 01:30:15,961
I'll go all those in favor.

1164
01:30:15,981 --> 01:30:25,223
All right motion passes the records were passed to Vice-president mocks, but mr. Vice president.

1165
01:30:25,483 --> 01:30:26,643
How did you find those records?

1166
01:30:29,104 --> 01:30:31,965
I thank you seconded by night

1167
01:30:33,577 --> 01:30:37,929
Motion to adjourn by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1168
01:30:38,230 --> 01:30:39,473
All those in favor?

1169
01:30:39,874 --> 01:30:40,736
Motion passes.
