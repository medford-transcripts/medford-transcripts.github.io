    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=56.439s">Communications</a>  from the mayor, 17414, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=57.68s">17414,</a>  one second, please.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=76.136s">17414</a>  to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=81.638s">Dear</a>  Mr. President, City Council, I respectfully request to recommend that your honorable body approve the following transfer of funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=90.0s">Amount</a>  $22,400 from account 010-102-5110-1112. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=91.301s">Account</a>  010-151-5110. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=109.401s">The</a>  purpose of this transfer is to appropriate the funds for the assistant city solicitor position as classification was changed from CAF 10, CAF 12 per request of the city council during the fiscal 17 budget deliberations. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=125.725s">In</a>  addition, solicitor Romley had a request in this budget narrative that the law office assistant position be reclassified from CAF 3, <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=135.81s">to</a>  CF4. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=137.091s">Solicitor</a>  Rumley will be here to answer any questions that we may have. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=144.976s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=146.157s">Move</a>  approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=147.598s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=151.4s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=152.681s">Mr.</a>  President, this appears to be housekeeping to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=154.763s">The</a>  council had voted to approve a change in the classification of the Assistant City Solicitor during last year's budget debates. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=160.086s">And</a>  this looks like it's housekeeping to make sure that the accounts line up. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=162.952s">I'm</a>  hoping that the city solicitor will be able to come up here and confirm that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=165.715s">And</a>  then I'd be happy to second council Dello Russo's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=169.899s">Mr.</a>  Solicitor.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=175.123s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=175.584s">I</a>  was distracted. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=176.345s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=178.386s">Oh,</a>  I am Mr. Solicitor.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=179.387s">I'm</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=179.828s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=180.408s">Um,</a>  the question that I would like to have it back, um, would be, <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=184.596s">This</a>  is just a housekeeping matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=185.757s">During</a>  the budget debates last year, we voted to approve an increase in the salary of the Assistant City Solicitor, and this is just a- Yes, this is the appropriation which would take care of the increase.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=194.524s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=195.265s">That's</a>  really the long and short of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=197.006s">It</a>  would have been nice if this had been done concurrently with the reclassification, but it wasn't, so this is necessary in order for us to be able to finish the fiscal year, everything square.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=209.596s">Mr.</a>  President, based on that explanation, I would second Councilor Dello Russo's motion for approval.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=214.918s">Mr.</a>  Solicitor, is this not in change of classification?</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=218.96s">No,</a>  it is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=219.6s">It's</a>  to fund the change in classification that was presented by Councilor Lungo-Koehn back last year at the beginning of the budgetary year, dealing with the Assistant City Solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=230.064s">And</a>  no, it is not a classification change. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=232.624s">It's</a>  to fund the change that was made.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=235.245s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=236.626s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=241.848s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=243.408s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=249.052s">Councilor</a>  DelaRosso? <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=250.033s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=250.834s">Councilor</a>  Falco? <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=251.674s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=252.355s">Councilor</a>  Naik? <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=253.176s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=253.716s">Councilor</a>  Locker? <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=255.337s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=255.517s">Vice</a>  President Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=256.638s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=257.399s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli? <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=258.6s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=259.44s">President</a>  Caravielloli?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=260.481s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=260.962s">Seven</a>  in the affirmative, none in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=263.904s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=264.744s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Solis.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=265.385s">On</a>  behalf of the law department, we thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=268.607s">While</a>  we're in suspension, <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=274.172s">17351.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=274.412s">Dear</a>  Mr. President, city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body approve the combining of the Water Enterprise Fund and the Sewer Enterprise Fund into one enterprise fund per Mass General Law Chapter 44, Section 53, F12. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=296.424s">To</a>  that end, I recommend your approval of the following resolution be it resolved that the City of Medford accepts <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=303.804s">the</a>  provisions of Chapter 44, Section 53F12 of the Massachusetts General Laws and combines the Water Enterprise Fund and the Sewer Enterprise Fund into one enterprise fund effective fiscal year 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=318.62s">Attached</a>  is the combined Water and Sewer Enterprise Funds Memorandum that was provided to the Water and Sewer Commission <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=326.481s">highlighting</a>  benefits of consolidating two enterprise funds into one enterprise fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=333.527s">A</a>  letter from the Water and Sewer Commission is provided which demonstrates their support. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=339.412s">Finance</a>  Director Aleesha Nunley is present to answer any of the council's questions regarding this matter sincerely. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=347.379s">Mayor</a>  Stephanie Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=351.287s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=352.648s">As</a>  this paper was tabled some weeks ago, we've had sufficient time to review, inquire, and be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=360.034s">As</a>  I did several weeks ago, I would like to, this week, move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=365.478s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=367.78s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=368.881s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President, it's my understanding that this matter was brought forward by the administration in an effort to reduce the duplication of efforts and to streamline some of the accounting principles and practices that they have in the office downstairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=380.403s">We</a>  have a finance director here, and maybe she can confirm that and talk a little bit about how this is going to work, and then I'll be happy to second Councilor de la Rousseau's motion, provided that the questions are answered appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=389.805s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=390.125s">Name</a>  and address of the director, please.</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=391.986s">Good</a>  evening, Honourable Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=393.326s">Aleesha</a>  Nunley, Finance Director for the City of Medford, and through the Chair to Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=398.547s">Yes,</a>  this would be streamlining the whole accounting. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=401.628s">It</a>  would be a lot easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=402.608s">We</a>  would still have two revenue streams to account for the sewer and water, but all expenses would be shared between the two.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=410.15s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=410.83s">Mr.</a>  President, I'm satisfied with the explanation that the finance director gave a couple weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=416.292s">This</a>  couple, but the committee of the whole meeting that we had and the reinforcement of such and her statement again this evening would lead me to believe that this is something that I can support and I would second Councilor Dello Russo's motion for approval.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=425.736s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=427.577s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=435.82s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=437.06s">Robert</a>  Penza, Zero Summit Road, Miffin, Mass., former member of the Saugus party. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=441.161s">I</a>  can appreciate the fact that you folks want to incorporate the water and sewer count together. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=444.962s">And</a>  as Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=445.402s">Nutley</a>  just indicated, you got permission from the Department of Revenue, from my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=449.623s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=450.083s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=451.403s">But</a>  with that being said, the water and sewer rate does have a section in there that talks about any surplus that's in there for a period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=460.621s">And</a>  if, in fact, the surplus is not being used for a project that will begin within a 90-day period of time, and they're sitting on approximately $8 million, that those monies should be returned back to the Medford taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=474.51s">Now,</a>  you just had a committee of the whole meeting tonight to talk about a new connectivity charge that is being proposed by the Water and Sewer Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=481.874s">But</a>  there was no discussion as it related to what's going to happen to the $8.5 million that's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=487.397s">And</a>  I would like to make a strong suggestion that the council amend your vote or make it a B paper asking either for the city solicitor, I mean for the city engineer and or the water and sewer department to have a plan presented to folks ready to go within 90 days or that those monies are revert back to the Metro taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=510.958s">I</a>  think it's just fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=512.255s">We</a>  keep talking, and we keep hearing over and beyond, over and over, that we have money in this surplus account. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=518.256s">And</a>  as it was explained to us.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=520.717s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=521.517s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=522.697s">Am</a>  I correct that the paper before us is as to whether or not we want to combine the accounts, not whether or not we're really looking at how the accounts are utilized, but whether or not we're really just allowing the finance director to combine the two accounts for accounting purposes and to eliminate duplication of efforts? <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=536.24s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=536.6s">That</a>  is the purpose of the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=537.62s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=950.938s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=952.499s">I</a>  had the opportunity last week to attend a business neighborhood meeting regarding the proposed work that's gonna be done at Bogginsport Liquors, the West Medford parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=966.75s">It</a>  has been mentioned before this council on a number of occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=970.092s">There</a>  has been contamination found underground and the city is in the process of removing the contaminants through a high water injection, multiple injections into the ground over a sustained period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=988.7s">While</a>  this takes place, Mr. President, we were told by the city engineer, as well as the chief of police, <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=995.067s">and</a>  as well as the consultant that was hired by the city that this parking lot will not be able to have any parking accommodations for a three-phased approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1011.579s">The</a>  first phase, I believe, will last at least <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1015.57s">I</a>  think it was 21 to 30 days, that was mentioned, of injections, followed by a phase two process, depending on how successful they are with phase one, that could range anywhere from five to 10 days, depending on what's left over, and then an eventual phase three. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1034.822s">The</a>  reason why I offer this resolution, Mr. President, is the parking lot behind the Bargain Spot Liquors is a place where many <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1044.949s">patron's</a>  park to frequent the West Method businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1048.67s">And</a>  actually many businesses will also use that as a place where deliveries can be had, a place where people can come and do some temporary parking to run in and <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1064.647s">do</a>  deliveries and other things in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1068.409s">And</a>  when we remove these 35 spots, it's going to become increasingly difficult for people to come in and traverse this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1077.373s">There</a>  is a plan by the police department to relax some of the parking restrictions in the area for a period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1085.647s">There's</a>  discussion about also using the tip of Playstead Park for some additional parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1093.648s">And</a>  this resolution actually was from business owners that approached me after the meeting asking that if we could temporarily relocate the bus stop in front of Bargain Spot Liquors, they could pick up four spots in the heart of West Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1110.411s">And</a>  we took a walk along the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1113.012s">We</a>  took a walk up to <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1116.175s">422</a>  High Street, and also in front of Brookline Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1119.338s">And</a>  I think we found a perfect location, temporary location, that's handicap accessible, because that'll be the first thing the MBTA requires of the city if we move the spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1131.25s">And</a>  indeed, we did see accessibility ramps on the corner of Canal and High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1139.712s">And</a>  I would ask at this time, Mr. President, in the interest of providing more parking at a time that it's needed in West Medford Square, that this council vote tonight to request immediately that the MBTA go out there and move the spot between Brookline Bank and 422 High Street in the interest of adding additional parking spots in West Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1165.152s">We</a>  also have a number of the business owners, Mr. President, that would like <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1170.315s">I</a>  think one or two would like to come up and say a few words regarding how important this is to business and the general vicinity. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1178.459s">And</a>  at this time, if we can allow business owners to get up, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1182.86s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1184.201s">Would</a>  anyone like to speak in this matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1189.403s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1189.863s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1191.064s">Ginny</a>  Roach, 64 Bower Street, Manfred. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1194.105s">I</a>  own CB Scoops. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1196.426s">I've</a>  been asking, actually, for this bus stop to be moved <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1199.833s">quite</a>  a bit for quite a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1202.914s">Just</a>  the location, the liquor store, there's a bench there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1205.294s">A</a>  lot of people tend to hang there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1207.294s">They</a>  go get whatever they get, come and sit. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1210.635s">I</a>  see elderly. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1211.635s">I</a>  see children. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1212.615s">I</a>  see all kinds of people just trying to navigate away from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1217.576s">It's</a>  just a bad location. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1218.856s">You</a>  shouldn't be able to bring your kids in front of a liquor store to get on a bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1223.077s">It</a>  should be moved permanently. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1225.137s">I</a>  agree with definitely temporary, and I appreciate that first step, but I would like <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1230.103s">you</a>  also to consider talking to the MBTA about moving it permanently.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1234.565s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1235.026s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1237.387s">Second,</a>  Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1240.448s">Would</a>  anyone else like to speak on this matter?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1243.81s">They're</a>  all shy now, the business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1246.311s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1247.052s">You</a>  did such a good job, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1248.853s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1250.454s">Mr.</a>  President, I certainly support this paper wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1252.935s">And</a>  I also think that in light of the fact that the majority of these business owners in West Medford do purchase <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1259.3s">business</a>  permits, and this is the business permit law, that there should be a pro-ratio abatement to the business permit holder for the period of time equivalent to the amount of days that the law is closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1271.786s">So</a>  I'd like to include that as part of the paper, that the Traffic Commission provide a pro-ratio abatement to the cost of a business permit in the equivalent of the number of days that the individuals that are in possession of the business permit <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1288.359s">are</a>  unable to access the lot.</p>

    <p>[Steven Pompeo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1290.36s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1290.7s">Name</a>  and address of the wreckage. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1293.261s">Stephen</a>  Pompeo, 18 Newton Road, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1295.862s">Thank</a>  you to Councilor Marks for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1297.823s">This</a>  is going to be very helpful during this process where they're taking away the 35 parking spots in the parking lot for that period of 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1307.346s">It'll</a>  also give an opportunity to test out that spot temporarily to see if it is potentially a long-term solution for moving that bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1315.849s">But</a>  at least temporarily for the short term, <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1318.312s">I'd</a>  like the council to support that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1321.676s">This</a>  is a project I've been involved in since 2009 when it became a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1325.961s">And</a>  I know a lot of the business owners can't be here tonight because most of them in West Medford are still open and working. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1331.424s">But</a>  during the meeting that Councilor Mark spoke about and at other meetings we've had, the consensus has generally been that moving that bus stop temporarily would be great to providing more spots right in the heart during this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1345.417s">There's</a>  been a number of other suggestions made to help with this situation as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1351.864s">One</a>  of them <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1354.06s">would</a>  be to step up the enforcement of High Street during this, rather than, there's been some suggestions to, and they're in good faith, to eliminate <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1366.423s">paid</a>  parking during this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1368.743s">And</a>  if that discussion comes up, I'd just like to say that most of the businesses in West Medford would prefer to have the enforcement stepped up during this process because the businesses want to leave High Street itself for the customers and try to find alternative places for the business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1385.567s">The</a>  tip of Placedead Park was one that's going to come up in front of the Park Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1390.568s">And</a>  that's a great suggestion on where to put the business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1393.038s">But</a>  if it does come up, we'd like to also have support to double the parking enforcement on high street so that the traffic gets moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1400.503s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1401.183s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1404.946s">Name</a>  and address of the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1406.507s">DJ</a>  Dabbingo, 470 High Street, West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1409.169s">I</a>  own Dabbs Lark. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1411.05s">Thank</a>  you for Councilor Marks for bringing this up and Councilor Knight for your suggestion on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1415.453s">I</a>  brought this actually up to Park Medford back in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1418.995s">When</a>  we were initially talking about this, I stood at this podium and asked why the work couldn't be done at night, what they were going to do about parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1424.958s">And</a>  I asked, when I was giving over my $100 for the parking permit, I said, is there going to be any kind of leeway given where they're going to be shutting our lot down for probably close to a quarter of the year? <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1435.144s">So</a>  we should be getting a quarter of that money back. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1437.505s">I</a>  mean, as business owners, we already spend in taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1440.407s">We</a>  already spend for utilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1441.627s">Now</a>  we have to spend for an unguaranteed parking spot, which now, for upwards of 30 days, <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1446.86s">We're</a>  just going to be at our own mercy to try to hopefully get a spot on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1450.682s">And</a>  then the other issue is the bus stop being moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1454.623s">It's</a>  a great thing, but I think it should be permanently over in front of the bank, where it's more ADA and compliant accessible by wheelchairs, people on crutches, where it's not so much in front of the liquor store. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1464.748s">Because</a>  the next project they're going to do after the parking lot is they're going to be putting curb bump outs there to narrow high street to increase pedestrian safety, traffic flow kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1475.337s">And</a>  when talking with the city engineer, I said, if you put the bump out where you're putting it, and the bus now has to go around it to get into the bus stop, now you're going to have the buses back in, sticking onto High Street, thus causing more traffic jams than there already are on High Street during the rush hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1490.607s">So</a>  I think a permanent solution is permanently putting the bus down in front of Brookline Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1494.689s">They</a>  have their own small parking lot behind the bank for their customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1498.312s">And</a>  I think it's a way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1501.095s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1501.915s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1502.195s">I</a>  think there is a proposal to maybe use some land on a place to park, which has been proposed also.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1510.457s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1512.138s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1513.998s">I</a>  thank my colleague, Michael Marks, for bringing this forward, and I appreciate all the business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1519.7s">I</a>  think that as the chairperson of transportation, I think that I wholeheartedly support the temporary movement, but call for a subcommittee meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1530.032s">and</a>  request the powers to be from the T to make this a full-time change. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1536.994s">So</a>  I'll be looking for a meeting relatively soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1539.855s">I</a>  think that we still haven't heard anything back about the resolution we put in about the Main Street and High Street issues again this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1548.977s">There</a>  were work trucks again in front of that location, that T stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1553.358s">And</a>  again, it left the buses out onto High Street and off the curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1559.479s">So</a>  I know they told us last meeting pretty arrogantly that that doesn't happen, and no one's called them. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1565.161s">But</a>  some people are calling me again. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1567.281s">And</a>  I think that we need to move quickly on these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1572.763s">I</a>  know we've talked to the director of ADA, and I know that we've heard some concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1578.305s">But</a>  there are other issues on the other side why people aren't speaking up. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1584.186s">So</a>  we need to enforce that, and hopefully the clerk <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1589.648s">reach</a>  out again to the department of transportation and the T to get a meeting as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1598.65s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1599.21s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1599.531s">Councilor</a>  Scott Billy. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1601.591s">Councilor</a>  Falco.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1651.538s">I</a>  don't think we've done, I don't know if anyone's talked to Brookline Bank yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1653.699s">They</a>  do have a parking lot on the rail.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1664.281s">Probably</a>  two, maybe three. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1666.942s">I</a>  know there's a mailbox there that might have to be moved.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1671.062s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1671.223s">If</a>  I could, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1674.405s">Vice</a>  President Max.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1675.526s">The</a>  benefit is that we're picking up the spots more in the heart of the square, where this is a little further out. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1680.389s">So</a>  it accommodates more business where it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1682.19s">So</a>  that's what we're hoping to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1684.431s">And</a>  eventually, I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1685.452s">I</a>  think, as my colleagues agree, we'd like to see it permanent. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1688.934s">And</a>  this may be a great way of just getting it in and then saying it's been working, it's successful, and let's stick with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1696.078s">Mr.</a>  President, I just want to thank the businesses for showing up tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1699.601s">You</a>  know, it's amazing when you sit down with business owners and people in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1703.616s">what</a>  great suggestions you can get, Mr. President, and move forward with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1707.617s">I</a>  just want to thank the business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1709.398s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1710.278s">And</a>  if I may, through the chair, with regards to everything that's been discussed tonight, proposals, I hear there's a lot of proposals out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1718.58s">When</a>  will the, I know this is starting fairly quickly and there are a lot of concerns from the business owners down in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1726.123s">So</a>  when will these proposals be more set in stone so that the business owners can <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1731.412s">comment</a>  and maybe make additional suggestions and recommendations to alleviate some concerns because as a business owner, I would not want to be put out like this for 30 days, 40 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1742.697s">So</a>  I just, through the chair, if I could recommend that the mayor's office work with the business owners, maybe whether that be another meeting once their proposals are, you know, kind of set in stone so that we can make sure everybody's happy and we can do whatever we can for the business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1757.86s">This</a>  is just one step in the many that probably need to be done in the next couple of months. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1761.722s">But</a>  whatever we have to do, we want to make sure the doors stay open and moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1766.363s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1767.564s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1769.104s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1770.145s">I'm</a>  wondering if maybe someone in the business community can answer this question for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1772.846s">But</a>  we also have a bus stop on the corner of Warren coming, I guess that would be West, into West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1779.949s">And</a>  we have a bus stop at the corner of Placedead Road at Irving Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1784.541s">Have</a>  those also been looked at as potential bus stops to move further away from the square to create some more parking on the opposite side of the street?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1794.443s">There's</a>  a spot on Warren and High.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1797.103s">The</a>  bus stop right in front of the spot.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1799.584s">That's</a>  the only other spot.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1801.484s">And</a>  then there's a bus stop on the corner of Irving Street in place of the road.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1804.784s">I</a>  think that's got to stay there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1806.325s">There's</a>  nowhere else to go over there.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1807.765s">And</a>  even if they move it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1809.185s">Nowhere</a>  to move there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1809.825s">But</a>  I think the proposal was to talk to the Park Commission and <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1814.33s">take</a>  that small section of Placid Park where they... Well, I'm well aware what the proposal is.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1818.851s">The</a>  question is whether or not those locations have been examined. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1821.652s">So</a>  hopefully that'll be an area for them to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1824.273s">If</a>  I can amend the paper to request that those two locations be examined, the corner of High Street and Warren Street, and the corner of Placid Road and Irving Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1831.835s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1944.428s">Mr.</a>  President, this is a great resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1946.108s">I</a>  think Mitchell Ave's been in rough shape since Testis was opened. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1950.169s">It's</a>  been long overdue that the street needs to be repaved, piggybacking on some of Councilor Mock's concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1957.048s">Between</a>  Route 16 at Winthrop Street and South Street, due to the detour that's in place with the closure of the Craddock Bridge, we're seeing an increased volume of cars that are being detoured down to the Winthrop Street and South Street, Winthrop to High and Winthrop to South. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1974.692s">And</a>  in front of the baseball park, we're seeing the street fall apart as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1978.673s">And</a>  we're seeing the exposed red rip rock like we're seeing on Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1982.734s">And</a>  we know that that's not something that we can just patch. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1985.877s">I</a>  think this is something that may require a little bit of help from our friends at the state delegation in relation to the Craddock Bridge project and the request that we made last week for mitigation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=1995.704s">So</a>  I'd ask that this matter be put on a B paper and request that we receive some help in repaving and resurfacing the roadway between Route 16 and South Street as a result of the increased traffic volume on the roadway due to the detour that's in place because of the ramp closure. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2014.337s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2083.096s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Locker. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2084.478s">And</a>  if I could add something to that paper, if we could ask why the raised crosswalk on Boston Avenue, where Tufts was doing construction, was taken down by the city of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2098.332s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2099.398s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2100.619s">I</a>  actually had a conversation with Commissioner Kerins before the Committee of the Whole today, and he informed me that Paris Street would be going underneath, I'm sorry, Evans Street, not Paris Street, would have the ground broken in the next two weeks for that project to start up. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2116.285s">So</a>  I'm looking forward to seeing that happen to answer Councilor Scarpelli's question. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2119.747s">And</a>  also on your question, I spoke with Rocco DiRico from- I spoke with Rocco myself today. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2125.575s">Tufts</a>  University relative to the speed bump. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2127.255s">And</a>  that was a temporary speed bump that was put up during the construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2130.236s">The</a>  construction is nearing an end. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2131.356s">So</a>  they've taken the temporary speed bump down and they're going to move forward with the striping and safety markers and so on.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2208.926s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2209.687s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2211.623s">I</a>  offer this resolution tonight, Mr. President, to hopefully go back and have the city solicitor look into a resolution that was offered by this council and debated back in 2011. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2226.57s">And</a>  the reason why I offer this resolution is, Mr. President, there's a proposal by a company called In Motion Wireless and Corp. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2237.216s">And</a>  they just actually put, <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2240.882s">an</a>  announcement in the transcript recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2244.183s">It</a>  appeared in the April 20th edition of the transcript. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2248.425s">There</a>  was a legal notice, and the legal notice stated that they were going to erect two 70-foot cell phone towers, proposed, and when I saw the addresses, I said, you gotta be kidding me. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2262.67s">The</a>  first address, Mr. President, was 63 Tyler Ave, which we all know is a residential area that abuts train tracks, <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2270.409s">and</a>  also 59 Charnwood Road, which is another residential area that abuts train tracks, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2278.435s">Both</a>  towers would be located in smack dab in neighborhoods and, in my opinion, would create a major visual impact in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2293.296s">Currently,</a>  there is no city ordinance that governs the placement of cell phone towers. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2300.045s">The</a>  current ordinance only regulates TV and radio antennas. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2305.593s">And</a>  it was back in 2008, believe it or not, <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2309.185s">I</a>  offered a resolution, paper 08-510, that would put into our city ordinance cell phone towers. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2319.913s">And</a>  what it would do is it would prohibit cell phone towers in residential areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2326.717s">And</a>  I'll talk about that a little bit later on, but that paper went through a lot of debate back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2333.762s">National</a>  Grid spoke on the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2335.706s">The</a>  paper was sent to the Office of Community Development, which all ordinances need to be sent to dealing with zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2346.231s">And</a>  the paper trail kind of dies off after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2350.432s">But</a>  the reason why I offer this tonight, Mr. President, is, as I stated, there is no ordinance right now that prohibits towers in residential areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2363.938s">And</a>  there was a resolution to amend ordinances only allowing cell towers in industrial and commercial zones and also by special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2372.945s">The</a>  matter was tabled by the council when a representative from National Grid raised an issue that was at least two state statutes allow wireless communication companies to attach antennas and amplifiers on utility poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2390.165s">And</a>  at the time we were prohibiting any cell towers within neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2396.306s">And</a>  they said that was in direct conflict with state statute, which allows these utility companies to put them on top of telephone poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2406.989s">Needless</a>  to say, this is not the request that was put in the transcript recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2414.19s">I'm</a>  asking tonight, Mr. President, that <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2418.039s">This</a>  paper be looked at by the city solicitor, Mark Rumley, and the building commissioner, and provide the input that the Community Development Board already gave us, and the input language that National Grid gave us, which came out with, I believe, was a great city ordinance back in 2011 that would address the issue of erecting cell phone towers in residential neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2447.608s">And</a>  so that's my first motion that the city solicitor and the building commissioner look into the 2011 city ordinance draft that was proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2460.057s">And</a>  also, Mr. President, the legal notice that was posted deals strictly with locating a cell tower near an historical preservation, national historic preservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2476.025s">And</a>  it's the acts of 1966 and the 2005 nationwide programmatic agreement that allows for public comment when you're putting a cell phone tower within a half mile of a historic preservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2495.499s">And</a>  they're looking for input right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2498.661s">And</a>  I would ask the city solicitor what legal <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2505.418s">Maneuvers</a>  can be done to, first of all, look at the Royal House, which is probably within, I'd say, a half a mile or very close to Charnwood Road to see if there's anything we can do on possibly putting a halt to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2523.628s">And</a>  secondly, Mr. President, it's vital now that we act. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2530.172s">I</a>  had some people come to me and say, well, there's a lot of areas in the city where <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2535.715s">they're</a>  considered dead zones and you can't get cell phone connections and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2541.179s">That</a>  may not even be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2542.78s">These</a>  may not even be phone cell towers. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2545.081s">They</a>  may be cell towers for use of the railways. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2549.685s">And</a>  I don't have that information, but I know that City Solicitor Rumley did reach out to the attorneys that were on the notice I received just tonight <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2564.725s">from</a>  the Federal Communication Commission, Washington, D.C. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2568.246s">It's</a>  called Information Notice of Section 106 Filings. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2572.628s">They</a>  list both addresses and who the petitioner is for both and the consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2580.971s">And</a>  I think Solicitor Rumley reached out. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2583.632s">I'm</a>  not sure if he got a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2585.373s">But</a>  I would ask at this time if the city solicitor can get up, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2589.594s">He</a>  was involved in 2011 <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2592.847s">crafting</a>  the language and working on this with the council, and I'd like to hear from him. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2597.669s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2597.929s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2599.449s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2599.69s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2600.57s">My</a>  name is Mark Rumley. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2602.17s">I'm</a>  the city solicitor and I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2607.332s">There's</a>  a lot of different things going on with this particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2610.713s">So</a>  if we start and put to the side just for a second, although I appreciate it, the ordinance that was proposed a few years back, that really should be revived because procedurally <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2621.007s">It</a>  did reach some type of a death procedurally years ago for different reasons, none of which really are easy to ascertain, but nonetheless, it should be revived and it should be revived because it was a good idea that it's a good idea now, even if these notices didn't come forward right now, dealing with, uh, uh, Charnwood and Tyler now. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2643.897s">to</a>  go according to what I've come across in the last few days. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2648.559s">I</a>  received from the city clerk two very vanilla notices under 106, and I really didn't know what they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2657.323s">And</a>  it did say Tyler, it did say Charnwood on it, it did say something about cell phone towers and that sort of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2665.247s">After</a>  I received it, and almost concurrently with that, <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2667.924s">Councilor</a>  Marks called me and said, do you know anything about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2670.445s">And</a>  honestly, I didn't know anything more than those two simple notices. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2674.826s">So</a>  I called the consultant who were in Wisconsin this morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2678.527s">They</a>  called me back this afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2680.848s">And</a>  this notification under chapter, under 106, which is a federal regulation, begins a comment period during which time a municipality, in this case, could comment on this particular proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2694.431s">And</a>  it is, as Councilor Marks had stated, <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2697.287s">to</a>  put up these two towers at this particular address. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2700.449s">Now,</a>  the consultants were hired, of course, and they were hired by the entity that's serving the MTA, MBTA, excuse me, for these two towers, because ostensibly, the use of the towers would be to serve the ridership on the trains. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2715.917s">It</a>  may not simply be a cell tower like servicing our cell phones. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2720.859s">It</a>  could be to provide Wi-Fi services to the people on the train. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2727.494s">And</a>  it is for the MBTA that this was planned. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2730.916s">So</a>  the person on the other end was very informative, a very professional gentleman named Andrew Rice. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2737.339s">And</a>  I said, is this going to service the MBTA only? <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2740.58s">Because</a>  I wanted to know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2742.321s">And</a>  he said, well, yes, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2744.402s">Well,</a>  of course, over the years, we all learned a little bit about cell towers. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2747.78s">And</a>  a cell tower is not necessarily just for the one use, which is on that tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2752.623s">Because</a>  there's a whole industry, a billion dollar industry in cell towers, where the spots on that tower are sold. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2759.808s">So</a>  I asked Mr. Rice today, is it the intention of the MBTA to sell any other spaces on this tower, on these towers, if they build them for commercial use? <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2769.775s">And</a>  the reason that I asked that is, Mr. Rice indicated, well, for many purposes, although he didn't enumerate the purposes, <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2777.53s">For</a>  many purposes, the MBTA is exempt from local rule, and there's something to say about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2783.513s">There</a>  is some validity to that, depending upon the use. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2786.874s">But</a>  I said, if you're going to sell or you're going to rent out any of the spots on that tower, then you're not just simply using it for MBTA uses, you're using it for commercial uses, for a for-profit use, and that brings things out of many areas of exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2802.341s">Now,</a>  of course, that's the first time we talked about it, so there's a little bit of, <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2806.923s">I</a>  would say silence for a few seconds after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2809.045s">I</a>  was just lifted at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2810.666s">So,</a>  the second thing is, when this notice went in the transcript, that began what under 106 is a 30-day comment period. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2820.794s">A</a>  30-day comment period for everyone to send in their sentiments, concerns, and questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2826.438s">Now,</a>  I believe that the direct communication to the city was sent to the city clerk, the historic commission, I believe, and also it said generically the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2837.498s">Well,</a>  we can all say it was sent to the city of Medford, but you need to have a little bit of meat on the bones when you use that particular term. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2845.125s">So</a>  to make sure the city of Medford received it, I asked Mr. Rice to send me the full packet this afternoon, which he did by email, and I flipped it out to nine or 10 department heads, and I shared it with the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2858.556s">But</a>  I think you might have had it anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2860.137s">I</a>  didn't know, but I wanted to make sure that you had it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2862.96s">So</a>  where does that leave us? <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2865.058s">That</a>  leaves us, one, with an ordinance that probably needs a little bit of shaping and a little bit of polish for present day, which is a good idea anyway, should look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2874.261s">And</a>  two, it puts us smack dab in the middle of a comment period where the city, its departments, its executive branch, and all other entities that have been notified should give their concern into the FCC under this notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2891.29s">Third,</a>  it puts us in the position of examining what the exact use would be by the MBTA and whether or not, if they do have any exemptions, whether or not those exemptions are waived or in any other way altered because of any intended commercial use of the cell tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2908.158s">Finally,</a>  if the ordinance which was not passed a few years back is enacted in some way, shape, or form right now, then the question could be, and there is no definitive answer to this, what effect <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2919.877s">a</a>  newly passed ordinance would be on this particular project. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2924.119s">Because</a>  the effective date or the notice date for the world, for the general public, so to speak, and you should always keep this in mind with a zoning enactment, is the date of publication before the planning board. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2939.848s">For</a>  example, about 20 years ago or 25 years ago, there was a moratorium put in place for certain uses in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2947.779s">that</a>  became effective when it was advertised before the planning board. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2951.582s">So</a>  if this ordinance went forth and was advertised before the planning board, that may well have some effect on this particular project, but that also would beg some other questions, like what exactly will the MBTA be using this tower for outside of serving its ridership? <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2968.573s">I</a>  know that sounds like a lot, but everything has to be broken down to its simplest elements, and we have to begin at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2976.186s">So</a>  the first domino to fall, and there are two concurrently, would be for the council to revive a look at that older ordinance that was proposed because procedurally it's not alive. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=2990.229s">And</a>  secondly, for all of the entities in the city of Medford, the various departments, et cetera, to craft carefully their concerns and to submit them under this notice period. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3002.331s">And</a>  the very last thing I'd say before I yield to my good friend, <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3006.593s">is</a>  that the purpose of this notice period is, under the NEPA, to make certain determinations as to historical uses in the area, which is why the Royal House is a pertinent, in its distance away from this particular proposed cell tower, is pertinent. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3027.606s">And</a>  that comes up under the National Environmental Policy Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3031.888s">So</a>  there are the various elements of this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3035.166s">and</a>  the various nuances that were presented with.</p>

    <p>[Tom Lincoln]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3037.627s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3042.989s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3044.53s">Tom</a>  Lincoln, I'm an executive director of the Royal House and Slave Quarters at 15 George Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3049.392s">I</a>  live at 27 Gleason Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3053.634s">I'd</a>  like to thank Councilor Marks and also the city solicitor and Ken Kraus, who actually brought this in front of <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3060.968s">some</a>  of us in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3062.489s">The</a>  Royal House and Slave Quarters, as we can best figure it, is about 2,000 feet away. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3068.071s">One</a>  thing that I think needs clarification, as I understand it, is that these are legal addresses, but the cell phone towers are actually proposed on the railroad right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3078.58s">I</a>  think you probably have to give the closest street address to there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3083.004s">But</a>  that said, the Royal House and Slave Quarters is a National Historic Landmark, which is the highest category of historic sites right here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3093.495s">We</a>  certainly preceded these cell phones by about 287 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3099.791s">And</a>  we're concerned, as I've talked to some of my colleagues and people on the board at the Royal House and Slave Quarters, about the visual impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3108.357s">74</a>  feet, I'm not an expert on visual impacts, but 74 feet is 65, 75, 74 feet, whatever it is, is pretty high. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3117.324s">I</a>  think it's higher than any building in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3119.986s">It's</a>  certainly higher than our, than the 1737 house that we have, as well as the Slave Quarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3128.494s">It's</a>  also not clear, and I think it will be good to know, exactly what the consequences are of commenting. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3135.556s">If</a>  it's just a comment period just to gather information, and if you don't have any statutory rights, et cetera, I'm not sure how much good that would do. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3147.801s">So</a>  we're certainly, at the Royal House of Slave Hoarders, are concerned about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3151.962s">We're</a>  certainly going to comment, along with the city departments, <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3158.372s">One</a>  thing, if you haven't been on a tour at the Royal House Slave Quarters recently, one thing we try to convey with our one acre left of 500 historic acres is the extent of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3170.101s">And</a>  so we do talk about the surrounding landscape and people certainly get a view of the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3176.065s">And</a>  I'm trying to imagine what it might look like with the cell phone tower sticking up above every other house off of George Street and back in that adjacent neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3187.877s">The</a>  second place, which I wear several hats here, but the second place which may be affected, although I think visually may be not affected, is the Brooks Estate, which I believe is about a half a mile from the Tyler Avenue location. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3204.842s">63,</a>  is it 63 Tyler? <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3208.303s">Is</a>  very close to Grove Street, up on the north end of Tyler there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3216.483s">The</a>  last point I would make, and I think this is certainly in the back of people's minds, if there are two towers being proposed today, what's in the future here? <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3227.466s">There</a>  are clearly some interesting and perhaps difficult jurisdictional issues in terms of the MBTA, et cetera, but the demand for bandwidth, as I understand it, the demand for services is certainly not going down. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3246.257s">Going</a>  back to the cell phone side, there are certainly dead spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3249.14s">In</a>  fact, the Royal House, if you're inside the Royal House, it's very hard to get cell phone service for some reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3256.285s">And</a>  I think that precedent is a thing to worry about here in terms of. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3261.728s">And</a>  these are really, any way you look at it, these are really tall structures. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3269.594s">In</a>  the past, in fact, this has happened in West Bedford, <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3272.988s">cell</a>  phone transmitters or whatever they are, or amplifiers, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3276.949s">Cell</a>  phone service have been placed atop buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3279.45s">They've</a>  been disguised. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3281.511s">There's</a>  no disguising these towers. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3284.032s">So</a>  we look forward to learning more about this, and we look forward both to an effective ordinance and to a resolution of some of these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3294.915s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3299.176s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3300.677s">Name</a>  and address of the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3302.957s">Doug</a>  Carr, 124 Boston Avenue in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3306.16s">I,</a>  like Mr. Lincoln, I wear several hats here. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3308.982s">I'm</a>  on the Medford Historic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3311.884s">I'm</a>  a director of the Brooks City Land Trust, and I've also served as the former chair of the Green Line Extension Design and Working Group, which is currently dormant, but this is affected by the Green Line because of the property on Charnwood, which is directly abuts the <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3327.983s">future</a>  Green Line extension to Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3330.844s">I</a>  want to echo what was said before. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3332.205s">I</a>  think there's a, these are insanely large, very disruptive visually. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3338.107s">They</a>  lower property values, frankly, for anyone within sight of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3341.509s">Certainly</a>  the backyards of the people along Charnwood are not going to be enhanced by them. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3347.151s">On</a>  the Medford Historic Commission, we have reviewed at least a half a dozen cell tower proposals in the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3355.115s">They've</a>  all been <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3356.982s">penthouses.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3357.682s">They've</a>  all been on the sides of buildings, buried amongst mechanical equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3361.844s">They've</a>  never been freestanding because it's insane to even propose that in a dense city like the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3367.846s">It's</a>  too disruptive. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3369.306s">We've</a>  approved them because, well we didn't actually approve them, but we commented on them and we sometimes were able to guide them on things like paint colors or maybe shifting their location to be less visually intrusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3380.73s">But</a>  we <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3382.102s">They've</a>  always been rather intelligently proposed, and these are not. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3385.543s">These</a>  are obviously in smack dab in the navel of the West Medford and the Hillside neighborhoods, and they're going to cause immeasurable damage. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3392.944s">So</a>  there are plenty of buildings that are about 70 feet tall all along the railway, not far from these locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3400.505s">We</a>  just need to push them a little bit to come up with a better design rather than the plain, simple drop. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3405.086s">It's</a>  75 feet to the top of equipment is what the drawings say that we all received today. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3411.065s">basically</a>  go back to the drawing board and try again, try a better way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3414.867s">Think</a>  of the Cummings building on Boston Ave, the U-Haul building. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3417.848s">Think</a>  of several buildings along Tufts, not too far from Charnwood. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3422.05s">Those</a>  are perfectly logical places we could put these towers and nobody would ever see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3427.252s">We</a>  just need to work better and start a dialogue, but tell them this is simply unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3433.58s">I</a>  mean, the Grove Street slave wall is probably within 700 feet of the one in Playstead. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3438.403s">This</a>  would be looming over the ball fields on Playstead. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3441.105s">I</a>  believe the royal house is within, I know the Brooks Estate, at least a portion with the ponds is within that half mile. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3445.908s">So</a>  there's clearly some historic resources that the documents say there's no negative effect on in the 33 page document you all received today, which is simply not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3457.236s">So</a>  we just need to basically pause <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3460.228s">and</a>  come up with a better solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3461.388s">I'm</a>  convinced there is a good one here. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3463.009s">We</a>  don't need to reinvent the wheel. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3465.289s">It</a>  should not be put in these residential neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3467.01s">We</a>  do need to revise our zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3468.41s">I</a>  completely agree with the council on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3470.41s">And</a>  I look forward to helping that make, make that occur in the very near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3474.511s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3477.452s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3479.373s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3481.253s">I</a>  know that back in the day when this resolution that council Mark's talking about was directly involved in the field of dreams committee and <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3490.238s">One</a>  of the biggest issues we had was that cell phone tower and the operation being built behind the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3498.24s">And</a>  one of the biggest benefits for that American cell phone tower company at the time was how quickly and how much money they would make off of selling parts of that tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3507.642s">What</a>  would be interesting to me is to see where else on the line that the T would be looking to put other towers. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3516.104s">Because</a>  if you can, I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3518.165s">would</a>  be a direct correlation. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3519.326s">If</a>  you see it just, you know, not just Medford, but you see it down the line, I think it might help us in really understanding that they're using, I mean, let's all, you know, state the facts, the T's in huge financial difficulties. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3534.818s">So</a>  I'd like to see that maybe if there's a way to ask them in our conversations, are we just looking in Medford or are they looking all the way down the line? <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3543.565s">Because</a>  if I think they, if they are doing that, <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3546.811s">I</a>  think this would be just a clear punch in the face that shows that they're using this for a revenue stream rather than what might be just discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3558.056s">So</a>  that'd be interesting to see if we can reach out and ask that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3564.998s">If</a>  it's just Medford, are they putting those towers elsewhere? <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3568.32s">It</a>  would be an interesting information. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3571.221s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3571.861s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3573.682s">Vice</a>  President Max. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3574.902s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3577.102s">Just</a>  if I could, in addition to what was mentioned about the legal notice regarding the public input on national registered or historic places, I did speak to Paul Mulkey, the building commissioner, and he stated that the only requirement that he is aware of as building commissioner, if someone wants to erect a cell phone tower, is a building permit and an electrical permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3602.734s">There's</a>  no other, there's no special permit, <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3605.287s">There's</a>  no other hoops that you have to jump through. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3608.548s">And</a>  there may be a question regarding zoning setbacks, and that's something that's being looked at currently right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3616.21s">So</a>  at this point, Mr. President, I would ask that the original paper, 11-477, be sent to Solicitor Rumley, and that is the paper that includes <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3633.478s">The</a>  recommendations from the Community Development Board, which recommended that wireless towers only be constructed in the two most industrial zoning districts in the city, and that also, the board recommended the city council be the granting authority for special permits for towers in those zones. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3654.862s">So</a>  those were the two recommendations that came out. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3657.422s">National</a>  Grid also, to be in compliance with the two state statutes, <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3662.287s">a</a>  recommended language that would still allow them to put cell towers on their telephone poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3668.891s">And</a>  I won't speak for the city solicitor, but I think that's something that we're obligated to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3674.275s">We</a>  want to adhere to whatever state statute is. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3677.637s">And</a>  this paper, Mr. President, I believe addresses all those concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3682.12s">And</a>  it's a combination of all that input. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3684.961s">I</a>  would also ask that my paper be referred to the committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3690.665s">So</a>  paper 17-1. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3692.885s">417</a>  be referred to the Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3695.506s">Once</a>  we get a response back from the city solicitor on paper 11-477 on the language, we can meet in the Committee of the Whole and hopefully we can push this ordinance through after three readings, Mr. President, and give the neighborhood the safeguards and the peace of mind that they deserve that these towers won't be popping up, Mr. President, in places that they're not welcomed.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3784.736s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3786.676s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3787.996s">As</a>  we all know, budget season is upon us, and we will be meeting hopefully sooner than later with regard to the city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3794.978s">But</a>  I know during the budget deliberations, there's always plenty of questions as to what the different departments do and whatnot and what's being accomplished. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3805.099s">So</a>  I just wanted to be proactive here and see if we could get a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3809.72s">a</a>  C-Click Fix report with regard to the items that are being reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3814.201s">So</a>  I guess the issues that are being reported, the date they're being reported, the department that the issue is being assigned to, and the duration that it's taking for these issues to get fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3826.843s">I</a>  think it would be good to actually have that information when we go into budget deliberations. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3832.704s">Data-driven</a>  decision-making I don't think is a bad thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3835.165s">I</a>  think it's good to actually have that information <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3837.507s">when</a>  we're negotiating the budget, I think it would benefit all of us to get a true picture as to, you know, what different departments are doing on a daily basis and to see what, you know, different problems are occurring throughout the city and, you know, how long it's taking to get these fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3852.656s">So</a>  I would ask for some support and move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3857.459s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3860.83s">Mr.</a>  President, this is a great resolution, and I don't think anybody behind this rail is going to vote against it, especially based on the fact that when C-Click Fix was rolled out, we've asked for quarterly reports, and those quarterly reports were not forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3874.956s">I</a>  thank Councilor Falco for putting this resolution on. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3877.337s">I</a>  also thank him for his foresight in starting to think about the budget at this early time, not really early, but earlier than usual. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3884.98s">So</a>  I certainly wholeheartedly support this request, Mr. President, and I would like to add a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=3890.466s">uh,</a>  requesting that the council reiterate its request to receive quarterly reports from C-Click fix.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4076.014s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4077.496s">I</a>  think I might need a box of tissues for this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4080.379s">A</a>  couple of weeks ago we saw Director Riccio here and she put in a great presentation concerning the capital needs and a request for <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4088.502s">authorizing</a>  a grant proposal to go up to the Department of Education. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4092.324s">And</a>  we all commented about the work that she's done in her short time here in Medford and how she's moved the vocational school eons and eons ahead of where it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4100.548s">She's</a>  broke down the invisible wall between the high school and the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4105.071s">She's</a>  added programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4106.892s">The</a>  programming that's been added has had a great impact on our bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4109.873s">It's</a>  had an ability to prevent kids from transferring out of district to go to other schools that provide <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4115.66s">programming</a>  that we didn't provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4117.722s">So,</a>  Mr. President, it's with great sadness, but also great pleasure to see Heidi moving on to something that is really worthwhile. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4126.988s">And</a>  it's an opportunity that she can't say no to. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4129.43s">But</a>  it's with great sadness to see her to go because she's done great things in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4133.493s">And</a>  it's really just too bad that we have to see her go. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4136.995s">I</a>  wish we could have done more to recruit and keep her here, but we can't make people move closer to Medford, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4141.518s">She</a>  had quite a commute coming in there every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4144.36s">With</a>  that being said, I'd ask my colleagues to support this resolution and wish her the best of luck and thank her for her service to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4150.123s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4785.112s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4787.413s">Thank</a>  you for bringing this up, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4789.073s">I</a>  also have been getting repeated emails if we could add 17, 48, and 61 Doonan Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4796.675s">Those</a>  stumps have been there for a very long time, and I did request through an email to Mr. Cairns that they would be removed if we could get a status on that and vote in favor of removing those stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4809.932s">People</a>  get sick and tired of stumps in their neighborhoods and on their streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4814.393s">And</a>  it's understandable. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4815.933s">It's</a>  an eyesore. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4817.193s">So</a>  if we could get those removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4818.874s">It's</a>  also a public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=4821.254s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=5372.656s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=5374.817s">How</a>  about the high school kids? <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=5375.997s">I</a>  mean, this is a wonderful thing.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=5377.298s">We</a>  have a chamber of commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=5378.459s">There's</a>  Facebook. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=5379.739s">There's</a>  multiple outlets for these people <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=5383.817s">uh,</a>  multiple resources for them to find out.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=5385.819s">They</a>  don't know about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=5386.94s">And</a>  I think we need to reach out.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=5388.362s">If</a>  they were good business people, they would, they would know.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=5391.325s">We</a>  want them to be good business people. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=5393.167s">So</a>  if we have to help educate them so they can have a successful business of Medford, I think it would be good to have some ambassadors to do that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=5400.053s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=5400.714s">Councilor</a>  knife. <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=5401.515s">Mr.</a>  President motion to request that the administration examined the feasibility of allowing the senior citizen <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=5407.019s">Abatement</a>  program to work as ambassadors between new businesses in the community in City Hall Thank you on the motion by councillor night seconded by councillor.</p>
