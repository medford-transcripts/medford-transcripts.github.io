00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:06,592
Hi, Medford Bites listeners.

2
00:00:07,152 --> 00:00:16,798
On today's episode, you will hear from the Medford Public Library's Children's Librarian, Sam Sednik, community member and the owner of Book Wonder, Melanie Raylan, and a special guest.

3
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:22,361
Important dates and other information mentioned by today's guests will be in the show notes for easy access.

4
00:00:22,942 --> 00:00:23,462
Hope you enjoy.

5
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:30,126
All right, thank you so much for meeting with me today.

6
00:00:30,507 --> 00:00:33,188
Do you mind just introducing yourself, saying your name and your pronouns?

7
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:33,909
Sure.

8
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:37,831
My name is Sam Sednick, and my pronouns are she, her.

9
00:00:38,812 --> 00:00:42,754
And yeah, I'm the children's librarian at Medford Public Library.

10
00:00:43,054 --> 00:00:43,335
Awesome.

11
00:00:44,636 --> 00:00:48,182
Yeah, we're sitting here in the new recording space in the new library.

12
00:00:48,202 --> 00:00:49,724
I know, we snuck in.

13
00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:52,468
Yeah, I'm very grateful to be here.

14
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:59,159
So the first question I've been asking folks is just what their favorite place to eat is in Medford and what they like to eat there.

15
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:13,822
Well, I definitely think that everyone calls out Colleen's, because as a person with an extreme sweet tooth, having ice cream for breakfast, lunch, or dinner seems like a great life choice.

16
00:01:15,003 --> 00:01:17,526
And occasionally, I guess I have to eat cheese sandwiches, too.

17
00:01:18,967 --> 00:01:27,271
Colleen says that, but we've been out in West Medford in our temporary space and Simple Fare has been a really delightful place.

18
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:29,172
I could eat their chips all day long.

19
00:01:29,512 --> 00:01:31,894
So clearly healthy options.

20
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:34,215
Chips, cheese, and ice cream.

21
00:01:34,355 --> 00:01:35,035
Yeah.

22
00:01:35,075 --> 00:01:35,696
Can't go wrong.

23
00:01:35,876 --> 00:01:38,877
All of the food groups.

24
00:01:39,357 --> 00:01:39,558
Awesome.

25
00:01:39,578 --> 00:01:40,418
Well, thank you, Sam.

26
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,439
You mentioned that you're the children's librarian.

27
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,142
So I wanted to kind of hear about that, like kind of what led you to your role here in Medford.

28
00:01:48,563 --> 00:02:03,326
Yeah, so I graduated from Boston University a very long time ago, and didn't really know what to do with a bachelor's in English, because it doesn't really pin you into a job.

29
00:02:03,426 --> 00:02:09,828
So I signed up for the Peace Corps, and I ended up serving in the country of Lesotho in southern Africa.

30
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:18,170
And while I was there, I was teaching English and science there, but I ended up doing a lot of community library development.

31
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:31,013
And seeing how important access to information can be to a community that doesn't have a ton of it really kind of opened my eye to what a library can be.

32
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:39,135
So when I came back, I got my master's in library and information science at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana.

33
00:02:40,115 --> 00:02:45,276
And then I made my way back to Massachusetts, because I kind of fell in love with it when I was at BU.

34
00:02:46,577 --> 00:02:54,178
So I started as a children's librarian here in 2013, and I've just been kind of kicking around Medford ever since.

35
00:02:54,498 --> 00:02:54,858
Nice.

36
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:58,479
Yeah, you mentioned kind of thinking about what a library could be.

37
00:02:58,539 --> 00:03:04,881
And I think some of us are familiar with the old library, and lots of us, I think, are excited for the new library.

38
00:03:05,941 --> 00:03:09,742
What's that process been like for you, sort of transitioning here?

39
00:03:10,222 --> 00:03:15,286
Yeah, so I've been very fortunate to be part of the building crew for this.

40
00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:26,215
We've been on a building team, so I've been in the design phase and in the planning phase and kind of in the back of it all along with Barbara Kerr, our director.

41
00:03:26,975 --> 00:03:29,176
Nicole Perreault, the teen services librarian.

42
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:35,037
So it doesn't feel as startling to me because I've been like plodding along all the way through.

43
00:03:35,837 --> 00:03:43,159
But it's really delightful to see it coming, coming to the point where we're going to be opening doors here soon.

44
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:52,101
And I really hope that the folks that have been just really waiting for it have all of their boxes ticked.

45
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:56,042
But what I'm really excited about with this new library is that

46
00:03:56,842 --> 00:03:59,723
There are people that haven't used the library in a long time.

47
00:03:59,943 --> 00:04:18,991
The old library wasn't a space for them, or they never had a chance to drop in, and I hope that just the sheer curiosity of new building and Medford brings them in, because I think there's a little something for everyone here, and I hope to help people find that for themselves.

48
00:04:19,351 --> 00:04:43,202
yeah thank you yeah and it's uh i think it's been really cool to see all the ways that the library has adapted to the pandemic the i remember like doing making a reservation and we could finally go back into the library getting lots of requesting lots of books and being able to pick them up and seeing some of the like art kits that you all are preparing for um for for folks to like bring home and what's uh so again it sounds like a lot of that's going to be

49
00:04:44,002 --> 00:04:46,763
like in person now, where people will be able to come to the library.

50
00:04:46,783 --> 00:04:50,444
So do you want to talk at all about what people can expect when the library opens?

51
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:57,786
Yeah, so we're hoping to open in early January, and we are going to go back to live programming in the space.

52
00:04:58,347 --> 00:05:02,588
We have a little bit more space here, like in temporary space we had no space, so it was a thing.

53
00:05:03,408 --> 00:05:17,934
For children's programming for a while, we'll probably be asking folks to wear masks if they're over the age of two, but we can see each other, we can do some story times and some projects, and we have a lot more programming spaces in the new library.

54
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:25,958
So we would like to start doing programs where we're doing stop motion animation, or we have a green screen so we can play around with that.

55
00:05:26,418 --> 00:05:30,780
We have a maker space so we can build and do wild, creative things in there.

56
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,322
And then, of course, we have our story time rooms.

57
00:05:33,402 --> 00:05:35,203
And so those story times will be coming back.

58
00:05:36,484 --> 00:05:39,346
And we are just really looking forward to seeing folks again.

59
00:05:39,987 --> 00:05:47,252
But yeah, we learned a lot during the pandemic about making things accessible, even if people can't come into the space.

60
00:05:47,552 --> 00:05:50,214
And our hope is to try and continue some of that.

61
00:05:51,415 --> 00:05:57,480
Like the take and make programs will probably stay for a while, where we'll occasionally do a craft where, you know,

62
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:03,647
You can't come and spend an hour in our space and make something, but you can grab the supplies and do it at home sometime.

63
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:10,456
So look forward to having some of that be part of our regular way that we do programming in the future.

64
00:06:10,476 --> 00:06:11,237
That's awesome.

65
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,415
Yeah, and I was lucky enough to get a tour from you before we sat down for this interview.

66
00:06:15,495 --> 00:06:21,162
And it's like, it looks like I mean, there's no furniture in here, but a huge space and the kids area looks awesome.

67
00:06:21,202 --> 00:06:23,666
And I'm excited for everybody to get to see it.

68
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:29,093
Can you give us an idea of like the timeline of when things will open?

69
00:06:29,373 --> 00:06:30,314
Yeah, absolutely.

70
00:06:30,434 --> 00:06:35,076
So the really important thing is we are closing the temporary space on December 4th.

71
00:06:35,116 --> 00:06:36,737
That's the last day it's open.

72
00:06:37,738 --> 00:06:46,362
And I know there's like winter holidays coming up, so if you need to stock up on books for December, now is the time to do it.

73
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:52,846
Get into the temporary space with your like wagon so that you can fill it up with books and take it out.

74
00:06:54,466 --> 00:06:59,147
We'd love to see everyone get all the things that they need for that month.

75
00:06:59,727 --> 00:07:04,668
But then we will close on December 4th, and hopefully we will be reopening on January 3rd.

76
00:07:05,609 --> 00:07:09,009
And we hope to see everyone.

77
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:12,050
And we will, that week, be starting programming again.

78
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:21,512
So we'll do a slow start with some of the story times that have been gone for a while, and then we'll roll into a lot of exciting programs.

79
00:07:22,552 --> 00:07:24,953
Yeah, is there anything else that you want to mention about the library?

80
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:32,356
I mean it's super amazing and I can't wait to see everyone come in and check out our space.

81
00:07:33,017 --> 00:07:51,845
So whatever thing excites you in the world, whether it is you're really into building things or you know you have a band that you've been performing with and you want to cut your single or you want to try out a new way to code a program, we have

82
00:07:52,545 --> 00:08:02,315
equipment and spaces for you to play around and explore and create and learn and discover and it's all here at the Bedford Public Library and we can't wait to see everyone.

83
00:08:02,335 --> 00:08:12,386
Yeah it's really cool to hear you talk about that because I think people think about libraries and they think about like books right and it sounds like so much more that you guys are planning here and so much more that you've been doing for so long.

84
00:08:12,766 --> 00:08:12,966
Yeah.

85
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:16,049
I mean, books are amazing because that's where you get your ideas.

86
00:08:16,549 --> 00:08:20,712
But then you've got to take those ideas outside of the books and do something amazing with it.

87
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:34,864
And so we're trying to give you some space to take those crazy crafts from the books or the wild engineering project and give you a little space to get that to the next level and go on from there.

88
00:08:35,484 --> 00:08:35,765
Great.

89
00:08:35,805 --> 00:08:37,566
Well, I'm really excited for everything to open up.

90
00:08:38,006 --> 00:08:38,627
Thank you so much.

91
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:38,887
Us too.

92
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:49,157
Thanks so much to Sam for sharing your excitement and for all the work of you and your colleagues that helped bring this awesome new library.

93
00:08:50,058 --> 00:08:54,340
Before we get to our next interview, I have a special guest who's also excited about the new library.

94
00:08:55,841 --> 00:08:56,762
Could you tell us your name?

95
00:08:57,422 --> 00:08:57,822
Cole.

96
00:08:58,463 --> 00:08:59,403
Nicole, how old are you?

97
00:08:59,423 --> 00:09:00,784
Five and a half.

98
00:09:00,864 --> 00:09:01,725
And what are your pronouns?

99
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:02,785
He and him.

100
00:09:04,186 --> 00:09:04,627
He and him?

101
00:09:05,347 --> 00:09:06,148
He and him.

102
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:06,588
Right.

103
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:10,050
Nicole, I was wondering, do you have a favorite book that you like to read?

104
00:09:10,798 --> 00:09:12,799
I like Captain Underpants books.

105
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,101
Yeah, and what do you like about Captain Underpants?

106
00:09:16,082 --> 00:09:17,663
I like the flapping pages.

107
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:18,784
The flapping pages.

108
00:09:19,524 --> 00:09:22,206
They make action in the book, kind of brings the book to life.

109
00:09:23,587 --> 00:09:24,287
Yeah, that's right.

110
00:09:24,587 --> 00:09:28,230
And I was wondering, is there anything that you're excited for about the new library?

111
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,391
Um, the quiet space.

112
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:31,772
The quiet space.

113
00:09:31,852 --> 00:09:34,294
Yeah, the quiet space with like the cool chair, you said.

114
00:09:34,314 --> 00:09:36,696
Yeah, Sam was able to show that to me.

115
00:09:36,716 --> 00:09:37,536
It was really cool.

116
00:09:38,237 --> 00:09:40,138
Well, thank you so much, Cole, for being on the podcast.

117
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:46,496
Alright, well, please enjoy the next interview after a brief ad from Reimagim.

118
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:51,906
Looking for a little party this holiday season?

119
00:09:52,566 --> 00:09:55,348
Why not try Reimagined's Holiday Party of Fitness?

120
00:09:56,228 --> 00:10:02,491
It's our 14-day trial we'll be hosting in December where you'll get to try a little bit of all the fitness training we offer.

121
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:06,893
It's like an extended date, but better because we won't ghost you.

122
00:10:07,854 --> 00:10:13,757
This 14-day trial includes a one-on-one fitness strategy session to discuss your fitness history and goals.

123
00:10:14,717 --> 00:10:23,142
Your first workout will be your one personal training session, where you'll go through a program that is designed for you, your body, and your goals.

124
00:10:23,863 --> 00:10:32,328
You'll also receive three small group personal training sessions, where you'll be coached through your training program, but with two new friends as your training buddies.

125
00:10:33,068 --> 00:10:36,949
And lastly, you'll receive two of our small group fitness classes.

126
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:45,713
These classes have pre-planned workouts where you'll enjoy the camaraderie of the other participants in class as you all go through the workout together.

127
00:10:46,373 --> 00:10:48,954
So don't forget to join our party for 14 days.

128
00:10:49,494 --> 00:10:55,296
Claim your spot by visiting our website www.reimagined.com, that's spelt

129
00:10:56,097 --> 00:11:01,284
R-E-I-M-A-G-Y-M and clicking the 14 day trial link.

130
00:11:01,825 --> 00:11:05,430
This party lasts all of December, but you don't want to miss out.

131
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:06,972
So claim yours today.

132
00:11:09,884 --> 00:11:12,486
All right, so thank you so much for making time for me today.

133
00:11:12,526 --> 00:11:15,028
If you wouldn't mind just introducing yourself with your name and pronouns.

134
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:15,549
Sure.

135
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:19,312
My name is Melanie Raylin and my pronouns are she, her, they, them.

136
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:19,872
Great.

137
00:11:19,932 --> 00:11:20,312
Thank you.

138
00:11:20,893 --> 00:11:27,658
Um, so I wanted to hear a little bit about kind of your professional work in Medford and some of the other stuff that you're kind of doing.

139
00:11:27,718 --> 00:11:29,820
It sounds like on maybe a more grassroots level.

140
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,262
Um, so could you talk a little bit about those things?

141
00:11:32,502 --> 00:11:38,803
Sure, so I run a bookstore and it's a diverse representative bookstore called Book Wonder.

142
00:11:39,123 --> 00:11:43,304
It's in South Medford and we're housed inside the For Good Vibes gift shop.

143
00:11:43,764 --> 00:11:56,387
So Becca Pierce-Whelan and Emily Pierce are a big reason why I was able to start Book Wonder because they keep the lights on and they keep us staffed and they helped me get started back last fall of 2019.

144
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:07,954
So, which, I kind of forget the year because of COVID, but yeah, so it's been, we just celebrated our two-year anniversary, which is pretty exciting for Book Wonder.

145
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:25,708
But anyway, so Book Wonder, we feature books and graphic novels that center on black and brown lives, AAPI, people of color, gender diverse and individuals, women and girls.

146
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:33,776
the LGBTQ plus community, as well as neurodiverse individuals and people with disabilities.

147
00:12:34,056 --> 00:12:40,844
It's a mouthful, but very important that we are reading those stories, putting those in front of our kids and our teens are having access to that.

148
00:12:41,024 --> 00:12:42,926
And I also have those books for adults.

149
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:46,911
Can you say a little bit about kind of what led you to start this company?

150
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:47,711
Sure.

151
00:12:47,951 --> 00:12:52,055
So, um, uh, you'll have to excuse me as I figure this out.

152
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:57,560
I'm not used to doing podcasts, but, uh, um, so I started book wonder.

153
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,341
Um, I actually started it.

154
00:12:59,481 --> 00:13:03,024
I'm one of these people who I get ideas and I think about it for a long time.

155
00:13:03,164 --> 00:13:09,149
And I was spending a lot of time as a new mom in, um, some of my favorite comic book shops.

156
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,551
And, um,

157
00:13:11,231 --> 00:13:18,592
I started to realize that when I was introduced to graphic novels, I was introduced to the Sandman series by Neil Gaiman.

158
00:13:19,902 --> 00:13:28,790
It's fun, it's dark, I do like fun and dark, but it was very, it was very, it was too much for that period of my life.

159
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:41,962
I wanted to read about interesting perspectives, I didn't necessarily want to read from the male perspective, and I wanted to see just different stories that would kind of get me out of my own brain in the new parenthood world.

160
00:13:43,883 --> 00:13:51,166
And I've always loved Marvel and comic books and to some extent I was always interested in them but I never thought they were for me.

161
00:13:51,646 --> 00:14:09,674
And then I started going to these comic stores and I started to realize there were a kids section and the first one that really stood out for me was one called Nimona by Noelle Stevenson who Noelle I believe is now they them and is exploring their gender and what I loved about Nimona was it was this amazing character

162
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:14,298
That I think actually if we look at pneumonia now pneumonia probably is gender expansive or non-binary.

163
00:14:14,358 --> 00:14:29,552
I think in that book they are Female but I think it was interesting that they kind of were standing outside of the gender norm and they were countering the whole like good people versus bad people and they were like poking fun at like how these stories are kind of

164
00:14:31,763 --> 00:14:53,321
created quite frankly in a binary way without any gray areas and it just poked at all of that and threw it to the wind and Nimona was this amazing shape-shifting character that I just fell in love with and wanted to be and then I just started to get hungry for more and I started to see more like they were coming out slowly but they were coming out and

165
00:14:55,022 --> 00:15:02,588
Around the time where I started to realize that Marvel was doing something amazing, not in the cinematic universe, but in their comics, they were creating

166
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,784
these comics geared for teens and young readers.

167
00:15:05,984 --> 00:15:28,134
And actually, thanks to Sam and Nicole at the library, I was pointed in the direction of the world of, for example, Latina queer superhero America Chavez and Squirrel Girl, a female superhero who eats nuts and kicks butts, and Miss Marvel, a Pakistani-American hero who's Muslim and had the choice to become a blonde, blue-eyed,

168
00:15:28,634 --> 00:15:56,950
superhero like Carol Danvers her predecessor and decide no I'm gonna be myself and make that into a superhero and it was so inspiring and I just I felt like my fellow community and parents didn't really know these existed I would talk about them and and people would just be like what are you talking about like a hero is Captain America here is Iron Man and maybe if we saw a woman here I was Black Widow I was like but wait and then I started to read even more about Captain Marvel Carol Danvers and realized like that she actually

169
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:17,892
she both has a history of being in heterosexual and in a queer relationship and I was like why aren't why aren't we seeing that in the media and so I got really fascinated by that and then um I realized that there was this real I guess I should I should pause because I was thinking about it a lot in terms of the lgbtq plus community and then I was also thinking about

170
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:28,043
stories featuring non-white characters particularly where we're talking about anti-racist education and reading these books specifically on that it's like well part of that is to read

171
00:16:28,628 --> 00:16:37,076
like Jerry Craft's New Kid and Class Act series, which are focusing on black and brown characters and the microaggressions they feel at school.

172
00:16:37,136 --> 00:16:39,698
And like, why isn't that a required reading for all of our kids?

173
00:16:40,419 --> 00:16:52,890
And being inspired by local community members like Dr. Divyanand, who you had on your podcast, who has taught me so much and has opened my mind so much about the whole idea of like, who is this book, not just like

174
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,190
Who is this book featuring?

175
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,311
But who is it written for?

176
00:16:55,371 --> 00:16:56,411
Who is it benefiting?

177
00:16:57,011 --> 00:17:02,493
And I just, I realized we needed to make that stuff, all these books more accessible.

178
00:17:02,793 --> 00:17:05,914
And when you go to a comic book store, your bill is usually very high.

179
00:17:05,934 --> 00:17:11,736
And I mean, yay for comic book stores and keeping the illustrators paid and keeping those bookstores open.

180
00:17:11,816 --> 00:17:17,338
But also there had to be a way to get these books in our school libraries, in our classrooms.

181
00:17:18,511 --> 00:17:29,387
Honestly, for a lot of the focus for me, it was in the hands of children during COVID when our big library was closed for renovations and there was a brief period where they were closed entirely.

182
00:17:30,035 --> 00:17:31,776
And our school libraries weren't accessible.

183
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:34,138
And obviously our classrooms weren't because our kids were home.

184
00:17:34,258 --> 00:17:43,425
And so it became this very like, how do I create a space where these books are both accessible, affordable, and potentially also free?

185
00:17:43,886 --> 00:17:53,973
And so that's a very long-winded way to say that I felt like there wasn't a space for me or for my parent friends or for women, gender fluid folks.

186
00:17:55,414 --> 00:18:00,500
In this like general comic book environment, it felt very male centered and male focused.

187
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:09,230
And even when they didn't, when they tried to reach out to perhaps women, it would be like, well, we have an event for women, but you can't bring your sons because it's for women.

188
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,354
It was just like, well, that's not very doable for a parent.

189
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:13,034
So.

190
00:18:15,346 --> 00:18:23,491
And I don't wanna talk badly about any of the wonderful places that I've been because I do love to support stores and keep local businesses open.

191
00:18:23,551 --> 00:18:26,593
So I think it was just like, how can I add to what the offer is?

192
00:18:26,613 --> 00:18:35,298
Sure, it sounds like you had this experience of going into comic book stores, places that you loved and not seeing yourself reflected in some of the books there, right?

193
00:18:35,338 --> 00:18:42,883
And having had that experience sort of using that to create this business and then be expansive of gender, but also inclusive of race.

194
00:18:43,843 --> 00:18:44,804
ethnic diversity as well.

195
00:18:45,124 --> 00:19:00,117
Yeah and even beyond myself I mean it was even the way interactions with staff would go it was just very like dismissive or that's the kids section or it's over there and it wasn't a priority in those establishments and I say that now having

196
00:19:00,857 --> 00:19:17,210
encountered amazing, amazing stores like All She Wrote Books and Assembly, which is a feminist and queer bookstore, and Omar's in Lexington, which has taught me so much about zines and queer graphic novels and is run by an individual with Down syndrome.

197
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,932
And so it's just a beautiful, wonderful establishment.

198
00:19:20,012 --> 00:19:23,475
So there are definitely places like that that are now becoming

199
00:19:24,415 --> 00:19:27,676
They are now rising up and becoming more prevalent, which is so wonderful.

200
00:19:28,117 --> 00:19:34,179
But I wanted to be able to kind of cut a slice of that into the used model, where my books would be priced lower.

201
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:39,261
I could buy books from local library sales and local shops.

202
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:43,042
One of my favorites being Book Rack in Arlington, which they're just such wonderful people over there.

203
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:50,705
And support local while also kind of like this double mission of like, let's keep local businesses alive.

204
00:19:51,185 --> 00:19:55,307
Let's get these very important stories easy to find and in front of people.

205
00:19:55,967 --> 00:20:00,149
And then what later developed into, oh, let's create a little free diverse library.

206
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:04,952
And I'm going to pause because that is an idea that's not original to me.

207
00:20:05,212 --> 00:20:08,453
It's Sarah Kramer who started the little free diverse library.

208
00:20:09,754 --> 00:20:12,495
initiative, which is now known as Diverse Stories.

209
00:20:13,215 --> 00:20:17,017
And Sarah was an Arlington resident, I believe she's now in New York City.

210
00:20:17,997 --> 00:20:26,220
And she, I had reached out to her when she started a whole movement to diversify the kind of books we were seeing in our little free libraries.

211
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:37,044
And so she, it was particularly after George Floyd, she was like, look, I'm not going to just sit here, I'm going to, I'm going to push this and anyone who wants to start a diverse library, reach out to me, I'm going to help you.

212
00:20:37,104 --> 00:20:39,045
And she was able to raise money, she gave us all

213
00:20:39,442 --> 00:20:44,244
Anyone who reached out to her, a seed, kind of a bag of several diverse books.

214
00:20:45,105 --> 00:20:46,446
And off we went.

215
00:20:48,447 --> 00:21:03,894
And she, I will credit her for helping me start the Little Free Diverse Library outside of the Book Wonder store in South Medford, which I think the location is very important, being in South Medford, in a place where our local school just changed its name to the Missittuck School from Columbus.

216
00:21:03,994 --> 00:21:07,536
And race is a very, very charged topic.

217
00:21:10,275 --> 00:21:23,421
as well as LGBTQ plus issues where we've had a local trans family who was the victim of homophobic graffiti a couple, several times in fact.

218
00:21:24,822 --> 00:21:32,006
So it feels very, very important to have these stories right there in the Mulva community for the kids, teens, adults, people taking the bus, anyone can get a hold of.

219
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:34,949
I have so many questions I could ask you.

220
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:38,153
You're making me think about a couple of things.

221
00:21:39,555 --> 00:21:49,427
One thing that Dr. Anand had said about being critical, thinking critically about these books and thinking critically about who they're for and making that available to people.

222
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:59,533
And I also talked to Sam at the library earlier today, and she was talking about how books are important, because I was struck by all the different things the library offers besides books, right?

223
00:21:59,593 --> 00:22:04,475
And she was saying, books are really important, but you need to take what you learn from those books and put it into practice, create something.

224
00:22:04,515 --> 00:22:10,878
And so I'm wondering about what your hope is and what that will mean for these little diverse libraries.

225
00:22:10,918 --> 00:22:14,920
So how do you hope the city of Medford will sort of use these offerings?

226
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,462
Or how do you hope that it will create change?

227
00:22:18,322 --> 00:22:19,963
do you hope it'll create change within the city?

228
00:22:20,683 --> 00:22:46,273
Thanks for asking that and I think I just want to give credit where credit is due that I'm not the first to you know as you mentioned Sam Sednick is an amazing treasure in our community as well as Nicole Perreault the teen librarian at the library really everybody at the library but those two individuals in particular have shown me from the beginning how we can provide these representative stories and put them in front of our kids

229
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:54,573
And I've seen Sam's work firsthand, providing these kind of programming at the schools, and have been an admiration.

230
00:22:54,613 --> 00:23:03,636
And I think my hope, and then there's friends like, I'm sure my friend's gonna kill me for saying her name out loud, but my friend Ingrid, I'll just leave it at that, is so inspiring.

231
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:13,480
And she has started a very important diverse book initiative at the Missittook School Library, where we have books of many different languages.

232
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,782
The Missittook has many different languages spoken there, including,

233
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:22,084
Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese, an Arabic dialect.

234
00:23:24,124 --> 00:23:25,585
I feel like I'm missing a very important one.

235
00:23:25,685 --> 00:23:33,568
Oh, Haitian Creole and Ingrid had worked with library staff to kind of expand that selection as well as just

236
00:23:34,828 --> 00:23:57,729
adding diverse books into the library along with my friend Christina and and myself and Michelle and Claire and there I could go on but there's a big parent network that wants to support this diverse initiative and as well as queer books because and we've we've met a little resistance along the way with some queer books and it's just getting those in the hands of kids who are as young as kindergartners

237
00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:07,953
And part of the difficulty is the industry and like you and I have spoken off podcasts, it's hard because the industry is still catching up in many ways.

238
00:24:07,973 --> 00:24:16,036
I mean it's still really hard to find a middle grade book with queer protagonists, transgender, non-binary.

239
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:18,157
It's like we need those stories written.

240
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:28,223
we're starting to see more and more of these like owl diary type books featuring black and brown characters, Asian characters, Indian characters.

241
00:24:28,644 --> 00:24:41,913
And talking to Melanie McLaughlin, our school committee member, you know, she had funded an initiative to buy many books on neurodiversity and people with disabilities and

242
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:57,153
I found how difficult it was even to find those kind of books, like you have a smattering, maybe a few in YA, some in middle grade, and picture books, those kind of books read off like a grocery list right now, and we need some really much deeper journeys into those worlds.

243
00:24:59,013 --> 00:25:07,924
I guess I'm rambling, but I think my point here is that it's very important that these books are available both at the school library, but also within the classrooms themselves.

244
00:25:07,984 --> 00:25:12,430
I see with my kid who's in third grade, you know, they pick a book out of the classroom library every day.

245
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,834
And something that's worth noting is that the teachers are funding those.

246
00:25:17,268 --> 00:25:22,031
I mean, I'm just gonna say our poor teachers, they're expected to do so much, including create an entire classroom library.

247
00:25:22,052 --> 00:25:30,718
And so what I've done kind of in a griot type way, I guess is the way to say it, is work with teachers on an individual level to say, can I provide these books to you?

248
00:25:31,138 --> 00:25:31,919
Let me help you.

249
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:43,747
And I take the proceeds, a portion of the proceeds from Book Wonder to fund both my little free diverse library, to add these diverse books to libraries throughout the city, particularly at schools, and

250
00:25:45,408 --> 00:25:48,911
to put these books within school libraries and the school classroom.

251
00:25:48,951 --> 00:26:12,047
So that is the hope, is to eventually have, whether it's somebody who steps up, I mean, wouldn't it be amazing to have Dr. Anand in that role, or somebody with those kind of credentials to be a diversity and inclusion, I guess librarian is the right term, or book expert or inclusion expert who is literally working with teachers, making these books available,

252
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:19,153
And not just giving the books, but as my friend Ingrid always reminds me, also providing curriculum and real training to how to do that.

253
00:26:19,894 --> 00:26:24,678
But at the same time I'm saying that, I still am reflecting upon what Dr. Anand said about

254
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:43,154
is the point of this to educate our white teachers to teach our diverse kids or to provide these resources so diverse kids see their experience and I think the purpose is hopefully both the window and mirror experience you know to see into other cultures to open your perspective to widen your view

255
00:26:44,776 --> 00:27:11,038
But I do I also see and I'm not blind to the fact that as a white person doing this that I have a lot to learn and a lot to listen to and I feel like I'm constantly in the state of Please you know and I hope people listening feel like they can call me up and talk to me and say you know what actually I prefer you say it this way or think about it that way I mean, I feel like I always need to be open-minded about how I'm approaching that and not just to come in and

256
00:27:11,518 --> 00:27:37,420
do the hey here I am white volunteer gonna save the day because that's not my intention at all I want to support what has been done work like dr. Nand has done in the Medford school system and work that the teachers are doing and the training they've done and training like Sam and Nicole have that I don't have you know that how can I support those efforts I think the big thing I've always thought about with anything I do in Medford is how do I help a

257
00:27:38,261 --> 00:27:47,325
process, understanding that there's probably been steps taken before me, and it's not about tromping over those steps and doing it my way, but how can I support what exists?

258
00:27:48,145 --> 00:27:53,948
And sometimes that means ripping it all down and trying again, but is there a way to support some efforts that have been done in the past?

259
00:27:54,008 --> 00:27:57,890
And so it's never so easy as, oh, I just want to give books to a teacher.

260
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,751
It's, okay, how can we really structurally address this?

261
00:28:01,571 --> 00:28:21,579
So I guess my dream is I'll have a beautiful, wonderful bookstore of my own and somehow we'll be able to address the structural issues of why most of the books in classrooms and in libraries still focus on white, cis, heterosexual characters and how can we expand that to really reflect our student population and our world at large.

262
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:21,999
Sure.

263
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,200
And can you tell us where to find the diverse library?

264
00:28:24,561 --> 00:28:24,841
Sure.

265
00:28:25,201 --> 00:28:28,842
So the diverse library, first of all, my store is Book Wonder at Four Good Vibes in South Medford.

266
00:28:28,882 --> 00:28:29,503
It's at 392 Main Street.

267
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:36,764
I'm not very good with websites, but I'm on Facebook and Instagram at Bee Book Wonder.

268
00:28:36,845 --> 00:28:38,749
So that's B-E Book Wonder.

269
00:28:39,448 --> 00:28:44,469
with the idea being that we're all book wonder, and it's kind of a restyle of boy wonder.

270
00:28:44,729 --> 00:28:47,150
It's like, nope, we're all the superhero here.

271
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:50,771
We can all step in and put on that cape, and we don't even need a cape.

272
00:28:50,851 --> 00:28:52,451
We can just be superheroes in our own way.

273
00:28:53,591 --> 00:28:56,252
And the Little Freed Library is located in front of our store.

274
00:28:56,272 --> 00:29:06,174
It's bright teal, and hopefully we'll get an arts grant, and then it will have some really cool art on it that reflects Black Lives Matter sentiments and trans lives.

275
00:29:07,065 --> 00:29:11,348
positivity and LGBTQ plus positivity and all that good stuff.

276
00:29:11,388 --> 00:29:17,773
So I was like really excited to get going on this topic that I forgot to ask you the question in the beginning about food.

277
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:20,474
So if we could go back to that.

278
00:29:20,494 --> 00:29:25,418
So everything I've been asking all of my guests about their favorite spot to eat in Medford, what they like to eat there.

279
00:29:26,338 --> 00:29:26,519
Okay.

280
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:27,479
I love this question.

281
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:31,322
And I've every time I listened to your episodes, I'm like, what would I say?

282
00:29:31,622 --> 00:29:32,543
So I'm going to, um,

283
00:29:34,838 --> 00:29:41,925
I have to say, especially during the pandemic where we ordered out a lot, and let's be honest, we don't really like to cook in our house, so we order out a lot.

284
00:29:42,425 --> 00:29:54,797
But one of my absolute favorite places is Real Gusto in Medford, and part of it is just Mateo and Francesca have always been supportive of our community work, whether we do cleanups or just bringing the community together.

285
00:29:56,465 --> 00:29:58,406
particularly when I was part of the Medford Community Coalition.

286
00:29:58,446 --> 00:29:59,466
They were always so supportive.

287
00:29:59,606 --> 00:30:01,286
But also their food is just so delicious.

288
00:30:01,547 --> 00:30:05,108
And I have a garlic allergy, which is really tough.

289
00:30:05,448 --> 00:30:09,669
And they cook things in the Tuscan style.

290
00:30:09,729 --> 00:30:11,410
So they don't use garlic in their sauce.

291
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,530
They use celery roots.

292
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,050
So I can eat all their sauces.

293
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:14,570
Wow.

294
00:30:14,871 --> 00:30:17,371
And so I dream about their ravioli and their carbonara.

295
00:30:17,591 --> 00:30:20,332
Oh, that sounds awesome.

296
00:30:20,992 --> 00:30:21,793
Well, thank you so much.

297
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:24,333
Is there anything that we haven't talked about that you'd like to add?

298
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:40,713
I guess I just want to acknowledge, particularly the episode from this season with Simi and Divya, that I'm so in admiration of the work that they're doing.

299
00:30:41,313 --> 00:30:46,818
I hope that what Book Wonder is doing can benefit them or benefit their efforts.

300
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:48,479
I have donated to

301
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:55,502
Divya, and I believe her partner's name is Kate on that project, the housing community calendar.

302
00:30:55,722 --> 00:31:00,703
And I hope that I can do more to support what Dr. Nhan's doing in the community.

303
00:31:00,723 --> 00:31:06,524
And I also just really appreciate what Simi is doing with her Loving Little Minds company.

304
00:31:06,544 --> 00:31:13,166
And it looks like there may be a future partnership where we work together to try to get diverse books into the schools.

305
00:31:13,426 --> 00:31:15,267
So more diverse books, I should say.

306
00:31:15,547 --> 00:31:16,807
There are diverse books in the schools.

307
00:31:17,387 --> 00:31:19,229
enhancing the selection that is there.

308
00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:31,277
Great, well I really appreciate your time today and I was able to get Divya shared an advanced copy of the calendar with me and it's beautiful so I hope people are donating to the campaign and getting their own copy.

309
00:31:31,337 --> 00:31:34,038
Yes, everyone donate to Divya's campaign, it's amazing.

310
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:36,480
Well Melanie, thank you so much.

311
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,761
Thank you, awesome.

312
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,392
Thank you to Melanie, Sam, and Cole.

313
00:31:47,493 --> 00:31:58,005
As Sam mentioned, the current temporary space for the library will close on Saturday, December 4th at 5 p.m., and the new library on High Street will open on Monday, January 3rd.

314
00:31:58,986 --> 00:32:03,711
On Saturday, January 15th, there will be a public open house and ribbon-cutting ceremony at 10 a.m.
