[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Perez.

6
00:00:37,398 --> 00:00:46,861
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion from Vice President Perez to take 22-569 and 22-561 under suspension, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

7
00:00:46,902 --> 00:00:47,522
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

8
00:00:48,162 --> 00:00:48,982
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

9
00:00:49,042 --> 00:00:49,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

10
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:53,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Where is... All right, so 22-561 appears after.

11
00:00:53,064 --> 00:00:53,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, 22-569.

12
00:00:57,216 --> 00:00:59,737
[SPEAKER_08]: offered by Councilor Collins, Vice President Bears, and Councilor Tseng.

13
00:01:00,997 --> 00:01:23,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas, over a super majority of Tufts residents assistants employed by the Tufts Office of Residential Life and Learning, ORLL, have signed union authorization at cards indicating their intention to form a union named the United Labor of Tufts Residents Assistants and engage in collective bargaining with the university through affiliation with the Office of Professional Employees International Union, OPEIU Local 153,

14
00:01:24,962 --> 00:01:39,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas Tufts residential assistants perform a role that is essential to the university and to residential life on campus yet receive no wages nor fringe benefits beyond a room credit as part of their compensation package and are required to attend over two weeks of unpaid training annually.

15
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:44,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas resident assistants are seeking fair compensation, better treatment by supervisors and ORLL,

16
00:01:45,532 --> 00:01:58,208
[SPEAKER_08]: and a clear contract with better articulation of expectations and responsibilities, whereas student workers of color and first generation slash low income student workers are disproportionately represented in the resident assistant workforce, making the fair treatment

17
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:22,492
[SPEAKER_08]: and compensation of RA's integral to Tufts University's stated commitment to equity and support for marginalized groups, whereas union representation and collective bargaining would allow resident assistants to have a say over the terms of their employment, providing an avenue through which to seek adequate compensation and clarity in the employment contract, whereas the spread of student worker unionization efforts represents an important piece of strengthening the labor movement nationwide.

18
00:02:23,993 --> 00:02:31,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council express its support for the Tufts Resident Assistance Union and calls upon Tufts University to voluntarily recognize their unit.

19
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:40,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it further resolved that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the Director of Government and Community Relations at Tufts University, and the Director of Residential Life.

20
00:02:42,047 --> 00:02:43,548
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion of Councilor, Councilor Collins.

21
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:46,430
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Morell and thank you.

22
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:49,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight, for your motion to approve.

23
00:02:50,322 --> 00:02:51,783
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this resolution speaks for itself.

24
00:02:51,843 --> 00:03:00,249
[SPEAKER_14]: I also wanna flag that we have a few representatives of the Resident Assistance Union here tonight to speak.

25
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:09,016
[SPEAKER_14]: And just to emphasize that this is a call for Tufts University, my alma mater, to voluntarily recognize the union.

26
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:11,778
[SPEAKER_14]: We hope that they will do so swiftly as it's the right thing to do.

27
00:03:12,078 --> 00:03:12,338
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

28
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:13,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

29
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:32,819
[SPEAKER_10]: As one of the two main municipalities on this side of Tufts campus, I think it's incumbent upon us as elected officials to help those who are seeking fairness and equity in the work that they perform.

30
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:38,861
[SPEAKER_10]: which is why supporting the RA union is so important for our city council to do.

31
00:03:40,162 --> 00:03:55,168
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this resolution itself already walks through a lot of the fundamental reasons for why we should express support for the Resident Assistance Union and call upon TOPS to voluntarily recognize the union.

32
00:03:55,907 --> 00:04:02,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but I also believe that, um, the stories behind it are as powerful and as important as well.

33
00:04:02,732 --> 00:04:07,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, a lot of my best friends growing up, they went to Tufts university and worked as RAs.

34
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:13,599
[SPEAKER_10]: And I, I, you know, I, I hung around, uh, campus sometimes just to, just to catch up with them.

35
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:18,222
[SPEAKER_10]: And I saw that, you know, the hours that they were putting into that work and.

36
00:04:19,382 --> 00:04:20,822
[SPEAKER_10]: the compensation that they received.

37
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:27,104
[SPEAKER_10]: And oftentimes they would talk to me about how it didn't seem fair.

38
00:04:27,724 --> 00:04:40,886
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I believe that such a step, I really have to congratulate the members of the RA union for being so bold as to fight for their own benefits and fight for what's right.

39
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:51,972
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wanted to shine a spotlight on their community petition, which is out there and open for anyone to sign.

40
00:04:52,032 --> 00:05:02,257
[SPEAKER_10]: If you search up Tufts RA Union, you'll be able to find the link to attach your name, sign your name to the petition.

41
00:05:02,698 --> 00:05:03,518
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you very much.

42
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:04,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Catherine.

43
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:05,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Bears.

44
00:05:05,402 --> 00:05:06,262
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Madam President.

45
00:05:06,443 --> 00:05:12,506
[SPEAKER_12]: I've spent the better part of the last 12 years in student organizing and worker organizing.

46
00:05:12,566 --> 00:05:17,109
[SPEAKER_12]: And some of the most powerful work that we've been able to do is student worker organizing.

47
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:19,810
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm a huge supporter of the work that you're doing.

48
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:23,733
[SPEAKER_12]: You happen to come up with a great name, Ultra.

49
00:05:23,953 --> 00:05:25,053
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty good stuff.

50
00:05:26,614 --> 00:05:30,477
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was also the beneficiary during my time at UMass Amherst

51
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:32,880
[SPEAKER_12]: where our RAs were unionized.

52
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:45,985
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know that they were able to fight hard for good contracts that really took a fair look at the amount of hours that they were putting in, the on-call status and all the other things RAs face on campus.

53
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:55,409
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know that I was proud to support those campaigns when I was a student and work with that union in years after that as well.

54
00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:57,130
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think it's great that you're doing this.

55
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:00,685
[SPEAKER_12]: It's tough to just voluntarily recognize it.

56
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:03,426
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you said you had two-thirds of people had already signed a card.

57
00:06:03,526 --> 00:06:04,626
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you know, you got it.

58
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:05,507
[SPEAKER_12]: You held an election.

59
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:06,107
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to win it.

60
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:10,488
[SPEAKER_12]: So let's recognize the union, bargain a fair contract, and make sure you get what you deserve.

61
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,829
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you for being here, and we're glad to support you.

62
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:14,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Vice President Bears.

63
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion from the council?

64
00:06:18,492 --> 00:06:19,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Would anyone like to come up and speak?

65
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:25,268
[SPEAKER_04]: please just your name and address for the record.

66
00:06:25,788 --> 00:06:27,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, my name is Julie Francois.

67
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:32,412
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to say thank you very much Councilor Collins for introducing this resolution and thank you to the City Council for your time.

68
00:06:33,112 --> 00:06:38,415
[SPEAKER_01]: We are undergraduate student workers employed as residential assistants at Tufts University Office of Residential Life and Learning.

69
00:06:39,096 --> 00:06:45,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the past several months, we have organized our workplace as a union under the Office of Professional Employees International Union Local 153.

70
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:56,088
[SPEAKER_01]: To date, 122 residential assistants, totaling over 85% of the workplace, have signed authorization cards indicating our desire to form the union and begin collective bargaining with the university.

71
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:00,772
[SPEAKER_01]: And on last Wednesday, we delivered our petition for voluntary recognition to university administration.

72
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:07,718
[SPEAKER_01]: As RA, we provide essential services to Tufts, upholding a crisis and lockout response line for residents at all hours of the night and on weekends.

73
00:07:08,258 --> 00:07:14,163
[SPEAKER_01]: We also host programs to foster community in our residence halls and perform administrative tasks vital to Tufts residential operations.

74
00:07:14,872 --> 00:07:22,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Despite the valuable work that we do for our employer, RAs receive no wages or any fringe benefits beyond a room credit and are required to attend 80 hours of unpaid training annually.

75
00:07:23,657 --> 00:07:28,560
[SPEAKER_01]: To cope with this inadequate compensation, many of us seek second or third jobs on or off campus to meet our needs.

76
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:36,424
[SPEAKER_01]: RAs have further experienced a lack of flexibility in scheduling while in turn being expected to be readily flexible to the requests of our supervisors.

77
00:07:37,105 --> 00:07:40,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Further, we have little to no say over our employment contract, which contains

78
00:07:41,047 --> 00:07:47,230
[SPEAKER_01]: and ambiguities, and is subject to unforeseen changes at the discretion of the Res Life office.

79
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:54,074
[SPEAKER_01]: These issues are uniquely amplified by the over-representation of first-generation and low-income students and students of color among RAs.

80
00:07:54,374 --> 00:08:00,257
[SPEAKER_01]: The university has committed to ensuring equity for its marginalized communities, but has fallen short on this duty with regard to residential assistance.

81
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:10,003
[SPEAKER_01]: To summarize, through unionization, we are seeking fair compensation, better treatment, and a real voice in our jobs, and we expect Tufts to voluntarily recognize our union as part of its commitment to its students and workers.

82
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,463
[SPEAKER_01]: We also want to be clear about why our union efforts warrant the attention of Medford.

83
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:20,747
[SPEAKER_01]: As a significant economic presence in the city, how Tufts treats its workers and has potential to impact working conditions across the area.

84
00:08:21,507 --> 00:08:30,574
[SPEAKER_01]: We further note, should we be successful, our union will not only benefit its members, but also serve to increase union density and build worker power across Tufts campus and throughout the city.

85
00:08:31,474 --> 00:08:36,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Even more broadly, we find ourselves in a promising moment for labor, with workers across the country organizing to improve their lot.

86
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:40,411
[SPEAKER_01]: And the potential for a renowned labor union is now on the horizon.

87
00:08:41,111 --> 00:09:00,360
[SPEAKER_01]: As a concentration of economic power that the labor movement has always fought against continues to erode the ability of the vast majority of the country to work and live with dignity, and as many of the rights won with the support of the labor movement over the past century come increasingly under threat, now is the time to stand with organizing workers of all kinds.

88
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,842
[SPEAKER_01]: We thus hope that the city council will support our union of student workers as we collectively exercise our rights

89
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:11,015
[SPEAKER_01]: When we asked the city council, make it clear to tell us that the city of Medford expects employers to respect its workers and their will.

90
00:09:11,275 --> 00:09:12,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for your time.

91
00:09:12,996 --> 00:09:13,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

92
00:09:14,537 --> 00:09:16,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone else who would like to speak on this paper?

93
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:24,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Bears.

94
00:09:24,884 --> 00:09:25,465
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

95
00:09:25,485 --> 00:09:25,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

96
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:27,106
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

97
00:09:27,746 --> 00:09:28,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

98
00:09:28,347 --> 00:09:30,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Bears.

99
00:09:30,794 --> 00:09:35,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Can we take a two minute recess to take a photo with our union folks and show our support?

100
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone opposed to that?

101
00:09:39,341 --> 00:09:39,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

102
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:39,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

103
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:40,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a two minute recess.

104
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:08,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

105
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:55,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Squeeze in a little bit.

106
00:10:59,328 --> 00:10:59,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Fabulous.

107
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was going to tell you to take the mask off.

108
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:03,211
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

109
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:03,611
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

110
00:11:04,592 --> 00:11:05,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a couple with this phone.

111
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:08,375
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

112
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:10,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see if we can squeeze more people in this way.

113
00:11:13,015 --> 00:11:15,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Steve, Councilor Tsengh, squeeze in more, we're doing this vertical.

114
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:44,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else got cameras?

115
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:26,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

116
00:12:36,453 --> 00:12:42,995
[SPEAKER_08]: 22-561, to President Nicole Morell and honorable members of the Medford City Council from Mayor Brant Olungokorin.

117
00:12:43,775 --> 00:13:04,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Regarding appropriation request for finance director, I respectfully request use of available funds in the amount of $1,205 in finance salaries, account 010-135-5110, to provide for a step increase for the finance director associated with the request before you to change the finance director position from a CAF 20 to a CAF 21, paper number 22-023.

118
00:13:06,283 --> 00:13:13,466
[SPEAKER_08]: The finance director was hired at a CAF 20 step five and is due to receive a step increase on the one year anniversary of his hire date, April 25th, 2022.

119
00:13:13,986 --> 00:13:23,509
[SPEAKER_08]: This appropriation request provides for an increase in weekly salary for the position of CAF, for the position to CAF 21 step five, starting April 23rd, 2025 through the end of FY23.

120
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:32,112
[SPEAKER_08]: This appropriation will be funded using available funds in the finance salaries account that have accumulated due to the vacancy and the assistant finance director slash budget manager position.

121
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:34,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Ian Nazarian is available to speak to this request.

122
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,526
[SPEAKER_08]: as well as paper 22-023 and answer any questions you may have.

123
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Respectfully submitted, Breanna Lungo-Koehn mayor.

124
00:13:45,334 --> 00:13:46,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi Madam President, thank you.

125
00:13:48,994 --> 00:14:16,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, I'm gonna stand with my previous stance that anything we do with any money papers have to be halted until we get definition of questions we've asked that clearly affect our decisions moving forward financially in hopes that we understand what the forecast looks like moving into the next budget season.

126
00:14:18,074 --> 00:14:19,659
[SPEAKER_11]: don't know what's going on financially.

127
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:22,507
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe our finance director has already stressed that.

128
00:14:23,778 --> 00:14:26,840
[SPEAKER_11]: There's too much going on right now to get a hold of it, a hold on it.

129
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:34,046
[SPEAKER_11]: And then again, we have our union representation in the audience again.

130
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:43,554
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, when this room is full with all of our union members, everybody stands tall about these money papers, making sure we're showing the true support.

131
00:14:44,394 --> 00:14:48,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Every penny that goes out, making sure that you handle the people that

132
00:14:49,677 --> 00:14:53,462
[SPEAKER_11]: have been working without a contract and are at a stalemate right now.

133
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:58,448
[SPEAKER_11]: And until that's done, I will not vote on any money paper moving forward.

134
00:14:58,528 --> 00:15:01,372
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is something I will not support.

135
00:15:01,752 --> 00:15:02,473
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe

136
00:15:03,062 --> 00:15:30,234
[SPEAKER_11]: anything dealing with salaries, especially when we have questions out there that haven't been answered, that we've been waiting for a legal response from that gave us guidance, whether that, you know, what we've done and what the mayor has done in the past and city administration's done in the past with upgrades and not getting a true understanding if it was done, when it was done without our knowledge, was it against our own city ordinances, which we believe they were.

137
00:15:30,354 --> 00:15:30,474
[SPEAKER_11]: So,

138
00:15:33,137 --> 00:15:38,120
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a trend, unless we figure out a way to stop it.

139
00:15:39,061 --> 00:15:44,724
[SPEAKER_11]: I also understand the other side of this, saying that we can't move forward unless we have these positions in place.

140
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:45,885
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know what?

141
00:15:45,905 --> 00:15:48,806
[SPEAKER_11]: There aren't too many offices full anyway in the city.

142
00:15:49,187 --> 00:15:58,632
[SPEAKER_11]: And it seems like we're just piecemealing things and nothing is really truly happening to support our union brothers and sisters.

143
00:15:58,652 --> 00:15:59,593
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

144
00:16:00,153 --> 00:16:00,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

145
00:16:00,954 --> 00:16:01,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice Mayor Bears.

146
00:16:02,382 --> 00:16:03,222
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Madam President.

147
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:20,068
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think specifically as pertains to this paper, you know, we received a letter now three weeks ago outlining some potential opportunities for us to receive information regarding the city's finances and budget, but we haven't received any further communication.

148
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:26,590
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't believe we've received any requests to schedule any meetings or have warrant articles placed on the agenda or anything of that sort.

149
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:30,692
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, to the point that we've been making as a council for

150
00:16:32,273 --> 00:16:39,418
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't even say how long at this point, at least 11 months, if not 36 months, we really need that information.

151
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,020
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the role of the finance director.

152
00:16:42,361 --> 00:16:53,929
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, I'm certainly open to hear more about why the folks think this is needed, but given the fact that we still haven't had those meetings and discussions or information presented to us, I don't think I would support moving forward with this paper at this time.

153
00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:58,132
[SPEAKER_12]: And we also got a legal opinion that this paper specifically will require five votes.

154
00:16:58,312 --> 00:17:00,034
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'll leave it at that.

155
00:17:00,174 --> 00:17:00,414
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

156
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Vice President Ferris.

157
00:17:02,951 --> 00:17:03,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Caraviello.

158
00:17:03,752 --> 00:17:05,854
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

159
00:17:05,874 --> 00:17:12,259
[SPEAKER_13]: The $1,205, is that per week, or is that just over for the rest of the year?

160
00:17:15,241 --> 00:17:16,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair Stephanie Zarian.

161
00:17:16,642 --> 00:17:17,663
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of vague on the amount.

162
00:17:17,683 --> 00:17:19,985
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Morell.

163
00:17:20,145 --> 00:17:24,789
[SPEAKER_17]: And to answer Councilor Caraviello's question, can you hear me okay, Councilor?

164
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:26,130
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

165
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,410
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

166
00:17:28,258 --> 00:17:43,124
[SPEAKER_17]: To answer your question, Councilor Caraviello, that would be the total annual amount that would be essentially from when the higher date of the finance director began, prorated through the end of that fiscal year.

167
00:17:43,184 --> 00:17:54,309
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's the total increase, or I should say, the total impact to the FY23 budget alone, above and beyond what's been previously appropriated.

168
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:55,429
[SPEAKER_17]: Does that make sense?

169
00:17:57,388 --> 00:17:59,709
[SPEAKER_13]: So his pay will get raised an additional $1,200, correct?

170
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:01,849
[SPEAKER_17]: It wouldn't raise an additional $1,200?

171
00:18:01,949 --> 00:18:05,170
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm afraid of the classification.

172
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,210
[SPEAKER_15]: He didn't give him a step.

173
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,851
[SPEAKER_15]: So he's getting like a $20 a week raise.

174
00:18:10,351 --> 00:18:12,011
[SPEAKER_15]: No, because he's going up from a $20 to a $21.

175
00:18:12,051 --> 00:18:15,332
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's probably like a $300 a week, $400 a week.

176
00:18:15,432 --> 00:18:16,593
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, well, the same thing.

177
00:18:16,973 --> 00:18:19,113
[SPEAKER_13]: If it's $1,200, that's like $20 a week.

178
00:18:19,493 --> 00:18:19,953
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

179
00:18:20,253 --> 00:18:22,754
[SPEAKER_16]: The difference between what was budgeted for this fiscal year and the upgrade.

180
00:18:22,914 --> 00:18:23,234
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

181
00:18:23,714 --> 00:18:23,794
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

182
00:18:23,814 --> 00:18:26,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilmember Falco.

183
00:18:28,123 --> 00:18:30,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion from the council?

184
00:18:30,364 --> 00:18:38,609
[SPEAKER_16]: Can the chief of staff explain to us when exactly we are gonna receive any of this financial information that we requested in January of 2020 at the first meeting of this Medford City Council?

185
00:18:38,629 --> 00:18:47,133
[SPEAKER_16]: And I believe if we look at the agenda here, the 33rd, we're now at the 33rd regular meeting at the first meeting, we requested quarterly financial updates.

186
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:52,516
[SPEAKER_16]: And we also requested that we receive monthly copies of the Warren articles with 33 meetings in.

187
00:18:52,656 --> 00:18:55,638
[SPEAKER_16]: We've never ever once received any of it.

188
00:18:57,058 --> 00:19:07,702
[SPEAKER_16]: But yet, week after week, we are asked to make votes on financial appropriations, on spending, on upgrades, on items that really revolve around finances in this community.

189
00:19:08,302 --> 00:19:17,605
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't think it's fair to us that you're gonna keep us here in the dark and make us beg for information that we've been asking for for the better part of a year now, 33 regular meetings.

190
00:19:19,646 --> 00:19:20,286
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not fair to us.

191
00:19:21,189 --> 00:19:27,313
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not fair to us to put us in a position where you're not going to give us the information and the tools necessary to make good decisions.

192
00:19:28,153 --> 00:19:30,535
[SPEAKER_16]: So here we are again, treated like mushrooms, right?

193
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:35,398
[SPEAKER_16]: Put them in the closet, shut the lights off, throw one on them and see what grows.

194
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:35,658
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

195
00:19:35,678 --> 00:19:36,658
[SPEAKER_16]: Cause that's what it is.

196
00:19:36,978 --> 00:19:39,020
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, ultimately at the end of the day, that's what's happening here.

197
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,702
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, week in and week out, it's the same reiteration.

198
00:19:43,262 --> 00:19:44,003
[SPEAKER_16]: We haven't asked for much.

199
00:19:44,023 --> 00:19:44,723
[SPEAKER_16]: We've said the same thing.

200
00:19:44,743 --> 00:19:45,283
[SPEAKER_16]: Give us a lawyer.

201
00:19:45,303 --> 00:19:46,544
[SPEAKER_16]: We had to fight for that for nine months.

202
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:47,405
[SPEAKER_16]: Still don't have one.

203
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:52,273
[SPEAKER_16]: 10 months we've been asking for just simple, basic financial information so that we could make good financial decisions.

204
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:52,954
[SPEAKER_16]: We still don't have that.

205
00:19:53,874 --> 00:19:55,736
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm at a loss.

206
00:19:55,776 --> 00:19:56,557
[SPEAKER_16]: The city's falling apart.

207
00:19:57,358 --> 00:19:58,138
[SPEAKER_16]: The city's falling apart.

208
00:19:58,178 --> 00:19:58,919
[SPEAKER_16]: Our schools aren't safe.

209
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,681
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't know what the financial picture is.

210
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:08,668
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a finance director who told us right now that he can't give us an update because the reconciliations are off and the information that I give you is probably gonna be wrong.

211
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:12,912
[SPEAKER_16]: But we're being asked to spend week in and week out.

212
00:20:13,927 --> 00:20:14,627
[SPEAKER_16]: week in and week out.

213
00:20:14,827 --> 00:20:15,388
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll say it again.

214
00:20:15,888 --> 00:20:16,768
[SPEAKER_16]: The city's falling apart.

215
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:17,429
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

216
00:20:17,489 --> 00:20:18,769
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't know what our financial picture is.

217
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:19,670
[SPEAKER_16]: And our schools aren't safe.

218
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,331
[SPEAKER_16]: What more is there?

219
00:20:22,311 --> 00:20:22,931
[SPEAKER_16]: What more is there?

220
00:20:23,132 --> 00:20:32,796
[SPEAKER_16]: A strong financial background, a strong, stable, local finance department, you know, strong public education system.

221
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:33,857
[SPEAKER_16]: We're failing in both aspects.

222
00:20:34,837 --> 00:20:38,279
[SPEAKER_16]: At least I feel as though we are, because I'm not receiving any information to the contrary.

223
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,560
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Madam President.

224
00:20:41,914 --> 00:20:46,658
[SPEAKER_08]: to provide an update on when we might be the council might be receiving those financial papers.

225
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:50,240
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Madam President and through you to Council night.

226
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:59,206
[SPEAKER_17]: As was stated by our finance director, as a result of the communication that was presented, and a city council agenda item.

227
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:12,449
[SPEAKER_17]: The finance director has stated that that information preliminary first quarter reports would be available and provided by mid November it is mid November so I anticipate that information will be forthcoming very soon to the city council.

228
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:21,759
[SPEAKER_17]: As far as the information being preliminary, as was stated by the finance director, the finance director because the absence

229
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:24,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of, sorry, point of information, Councilor Knight.

230
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:27,883
[SPEAKER_16]: So point, it's first quarter for this fiscal year, all right?

231
00:21:28,303 --> 00:21:30,165
[SPEAKER_16]: But what about the fiscal year that just passed?

232
00:21:30,465 --> 00:21:33,147
[SPEAKER_16]: The one that we've been asking for for that fiscal year too, all right?

233
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,509
[SPEAKER_16]: So you want to talk about the first quarter of this fiscal year?

234
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:43,275
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all well and good, but we've been asking for this for four, four, four quarters now, three from the previous fiscal year and one from this fiscal year.

235
00:21:47,017 --> 00:21:47,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Nina, please continue.

236
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:49,929
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Madam President.

237
00:21:50,349 --> 00:21:54,192
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, through you to Councilor Knight, we have had a vacancy.

238
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:58,375
[SPEAKER_17]: I know the Council knows this, but we've had a vacancy in the position of the Finance Director.

239
00:21:58,976 --> 00:22:04,720
[SPEAKER_17]: We subsequently had a vacancy in the position of the Assistant Finance Director and Budget Manager, which has now been filled.

240
00:22:05,281 --> 00:22:06,401
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm happy to report on that.

241
00:22:06,462 --> 00:22:08,463
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a tremendous asset that's come on board.

242
00:22:08,783 --> 00:22:13,167
[SPEAKER_17]: We're looking forward to Courtney Cardello getting her feet planted on the ground.

243
00:22:13,227 --> 00:22:15,288
[SPEAKER_17]: She's already begun discussions.

244
00:22:15,469 --> 00:22:18,551
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm in meetings with her and with the Finance Director to begin

245
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:33,458
[SPEAKER_17]: discussions on next year's budget at this point, those are preliminary, but we're working very hard in a circumstance where there are very few staff members in the community or the public at large who are qualified for these kinds of positions.

246
00:22:33,778 --> 00:22:48,843
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'll just say one other thing that's really important on this specific topic, and that is the state actually recognized this is the shortage that exists with finance professionals and is instituting a program to develop and recruit and train

247
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:50,486
[SPEAKER_17]: finance professionals.

248
00:22:50,966 --> 00:22:56,729
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, this is more of the same issue that we faced for quite some time with regard to a shortage.

249
00:22:57,009 --> 00:23:04,193
[SPEAKER_17]: We wanted to make sure that when we hired a finance director, we hired a qualified finance director and the same for the assistant finance director.

250
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:12,918
[SPEAKER_17]: We are essentially basically in this process where we're struggling, where we had been struggling.

251
00:23:13,378 --> 00:23:16,600
[SPEAKER_17]: Happy to announce we have filled all of our positions at this point.

252
00:23:17,091 --> 00:23:18,833
[SPEAKER_17]: trying to find the qualified staff.

253
00:23:18,893 --> 00:23:27,079
[SPEAKER_17]: And now that we've found them, I'm sure that things will be moving more rapidly and there will be a freer flow of information through this process.

254
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:34,305
[SPEAKER_17]: So all I can say is we've been struggling with finding qualified candidates and we have since found them, which is great news.

255
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:39,630
[SPEAKER_17]: As far as the assistant city solicitor position, we're interviewing for those right now.

256
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,912
[SPEAKER_17]: It takes time, we're in a difficult labor market.

257
00:23:42,352 --> 00:23:44,694
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll end there and I won't attempt to address all comments.

258
00:23:44,734 --> 00:23:45,635
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for your time.

259
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:51,796
[SPEAKER_16]: It appears that we're the only people in the world that can't hire 100 people that want to work $100,000 a year jobs.

260
00:23:51,836 --> 00:23:53,177
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what I mean?

261
00:23:53,197 --> 00:23:53,757
[SPEAKER_16]: It's crazy, huh?

262
00:23:54,297 --> 00:23:54,777
[SPEAKER_16]: Imagine that.

263
00:23:55,057 --> 00:23:59,539
[SPEAKER_16]: Manhattan, Mass, the only city in the world that can't hire people into jobs that get paid $100,000 a year.

264
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:01,240
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we had a finance director.

265
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,800
[SPEAKER_16]: We had a very capable finance director.

266
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,461
[SPEAKER_16]: He ran out of town, right?

267
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:06,222
[SPEAKER_16]: Ran out of the town to do discriminatory actions.

268
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:07,302
[SPEAKER_16]: We had one.

269
00:24:07,982 --> 00:24:09,003
[SPEAKER_16]: We had a finance director.

270
00:24:09,043 --> 00:24:10,123
[SPEAKER_16]: We weren't in this situation.

271
00:24:10,423 --> 00:24:12,024
[SPEAKER_16]: We created this situation that we're in.

272
00:24:12,504 --> 00:24:14,865
[SPEAKER_16]: The administration's actions caused a reaction.

273
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:17,771
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why we're in this situation.

274
00:24:18,251 --> 00:24:23,254
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not because of a lack of interest or the inability to hire.

275
00:24:23,594 --> 00:24:25,555
[SPEAKER_16]: We had somebody in the job, but we ran out of town.

276
00:24:28,257 --> 00:24:33,220
[SPEAKER_16]: And then for 10 months, because we ran that person out of town, this city was left with its pants down.

277
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,802
[SPEAKER_16]: And the taxpayers in this community are the ones that are suffering.

278
00:24:38,523 --> 00:24:43,766
[SPEAKER_16]: So we can sit up here and we can make all the excuses in the world and talk about, well, this happens over here and this happens over there.

279
00:24:43,806 --> 00:24:44,547
[SPEAKER_16]: Or we can be leaders.

280
00:24:45,591 --> 00:24:48,192
[SPEAKER_16]: We can be leaders and we can say, hey, listen, this is the problems that are at hand.

281
00:24:48,212 --> 00:24:49,413
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's tackle them and let's fix them.

282
00:24:49,853 --> 00:24:52,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's not make excuses for them and they go cut ribbons every time something goes wrong.

283
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:55,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

284
00:24:56,797 --> 00:24:58,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further discussion from the council?

285
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:02,560
[SPEAKER_04]: President Bears.

286
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:08,023
[SPEAKER_12]: Just to clarify, this would not go into effect until April 23rd of 2023, April 23rd of next year.

287
00:25:13,385 --> 00:25:17,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Chief of Staff, can you confirm that this wouldn't go into effect until April 23rd of next year?

288
00:25:18,609 --> 00:25:20,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

289
00:25:21,672 --> 00:25:22,812
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, that would be correct.

290
00:25:22,852 --> 00:25:34,521
[SPEAKER_17]: It would be April 23rd of this coming April 23rd, essentially, because that would be one year from the date of hire in accordance with the CAF system.

291
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:38,865
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we have an error in our paper.

292
00:25:38,885 --> 00:25:40,166
[SPEAKER_05]: The paper does say 2025.

293
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:42,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, thank you.

294
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,076
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be a Scrivener's Hour, yes.

295
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,398
[SPEAKER_17]: It would be 2023.

296
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:46,379
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for catching that.

297
00:25:48,661 --> 00:25:54,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, again, I've heard what was said.

298
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:58,110
[SPEAKER_12]: It is mid-November, and the documents aren't in front of us.

299
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:02,655
[SPEAKER_12]: Since this wouldn't even go into effect until next April, I would motion to table.

300
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:20,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm fine with that, too, if we want to correct, amend the paper, ask the mayor to amend the paper to reflect the correct date.

301
00:26:24,427 --> 00:26:26,548
[SPEAKER_04]: What would be the process for that?

302
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:42,656
[SPEAKER_06]: I would, not having done this before, I'm going to jump to a couple of conclusions that ultimately we'd probably have to vote to refer the paper back to the mayor and request a correction.

303
00:26:57,808 --> 00:27:00,129
[SPEAKER_08]: members of the public to step in as Aaron for you.

304
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:02,991
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

305
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:10,595
[SPEAKER_17]: I just the only thing I'd like to add as part of this discussion is Councilor and I made a comment regarding $100,000 jobs.

306
00:27:10,675 --> 00:27:22,801
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to note that the city of Somerville has had several city solicitor positions posted to the Mass Municipal Association website for what seems to be several months years.

307
00:27:23,261 --> 00:27:25,803
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe they have five or six vacancies at present.

308
00:27:26,303 --> 00:27:26,583
[SPEAKER_17]: I just

309
00:27:27,618 --> 00:27:34,385
[SPEAKER_17]: point of information to show that there is a genuine qualification issue that exists out there.

310
00:27:34,465 --> 00:27:36,206
[SPEAKER_17]: And I can't comment on personnel matters.

311
00:27:36,527 --> 00:27:43,553
[SPEAKER_17]: So I won't even attempt to comment on the other implication or matter that was implied with the former finance director.

312
00:27:43,733 --> 00:27:44,014
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

313
00:27:48,148 --> 00:28:08,504
[SPEAKER_16]: that served in an acting capacity, and again, was also kept in the dock, well, hundreds of thousands of dollars were funneled to KP Law to perform the legal services, KP Law being the mayor's private legal counsel, not the city's counsel, not legal counsel that works in the interest of the taxpayer, but legal counsel that works under contract for the mayor, not for the residents of this community.

314
00:28:09,524 --> 00:28:16,830
[SPEAKER_16]: So when we had a city solicitor that sat in the city solicitor's office, which is now vacant, we have nobody in there except for an office administrator,

315
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:20,821
[SPEAKER_16]: No lawyers, no lawyers at all in City Hall.

316
00:28:21,861 --> 00:28:23,763
[SPEAKER_16]: No lawyer in City Hall, none.

317
00:28:24,183 --> 00:28:28,185
[SPEAKER_16]: KP Law on speed dial, probably $800 to $500, $800 an hour.

318
00:28:28,205 --> 00:28:30,707
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're calling them on speed dial.

319
00:28:31,407 --> 00:28:37,631
[SPEAKER_16]: We have an office right there, vacant, with two positions that probably total close to $200,000.

320
00:28:39,198 --> 00:28:43,500
[SPEAKER_16]: So, well, we can look over in the city of Somerville and say, well, they're doing such great things.

321
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,942
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, look at Pothouse Circle, for example, that doesn't make it get vertical.

322
00:28:46,962 --> 00:28:48,803
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what does, you know what I mean?

323
00:28:48,843 --> 00:28:53,305
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'd like to compare ourselves again, to be leaders and to be people are the first, not followers.

324
00:28:53,866 --> 00:28:55,346
[SPEAKER_16]: So I really don't care what they're doing next door.

325
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:58,328
[SPEAKER_16]: I care what we're doing here and I know we can do a better job here.

326
00:28:58,348 --> 00:29:00,489
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's right.

327
00:29:01,838 --> 00:29:02,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Bears.

328
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:10,162
[SPEAKER_12]: Just to clarify my motion, it would be to refer the paper back to the mayor's office for amendment of the typo.

329
00:29:12,763 --> 00:29:14,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion from the council?

330
00:29:15,645 --> 00:29:16,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Members of the public who wish to speak?

331
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:22,588
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the motion of Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

332
00:29:23,648 --> 00:29:24,349
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

00:29:25,169 --> 00:29:25,889
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:26,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

335
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:31,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I have a motion to revert back to regular order of business?

336
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:38,176
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, to revert back to regular order of business, seconded by Vice Mayor Bears.

337
00:29:38,216 --> 00:29:38,817
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

338
00:29:38,837 --> 00:29:40,380
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

339
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,001

340
00:29:44,211 --> 00:29:47,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Announcements, act weights, remembrances, reports, and records.

341

[SPEAKER_08]: 22-567 offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council send its deepest condolences, I'm sorry, deepest and sincere condolences to the family of William Matarazzo on his recent passing.

342
00:29:58,442 --> 00:30:02,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Matarazzo is the father of Janice DePace in the city's clerk's office.

343
00:30:02,906 --> 00:30:06,448
[SPEAKER_08]: He served his country during the Korean War as a Marine and was active in youth sports.

344
00:30:06,508 --> 00:30:08,350
[SPEAKER_08]: He was the man of the year for the sons of Italy.

345
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,851
[SPEAKER_08]: His presence in our community will be missed.

346
00:30:09,911 --> 00:30:10,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Caraviello.

347
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,511
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

348
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:14,813
[SPEAKER_13]: Another sad passing, Gary.

349
00:30:15,954 --> 00:30:21,980
[SPEAKER_13]: We all know Janice from the clerk's office, and her dad was a well-respected man in our community.

350
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,664
[SPEAKER_13]: He was very active in youth sports.

351
00:30:26,704 --> 00:30:29,106
[SPEAKER_13]: He was Man of the Year with Sons of Italy at one time.

352
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:36,232
[SPEAKER_13]: But you'd always see him around town, always have a happy face, and always a good, pleasant man to talk to.

353
00:30:37,823 --> 00:30:43,371
[SPEAKER_13]: They say it's another veteran that's passed away in that community.

354
00:30:43,411 --> 00:30:47,777
[SPEAKER_13]: So just condolences to his family.

355
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:49,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

356
00:30:50,424 --> 00:30:51,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further tonight?

357
00:30:51,845 --> 00:30:52,585
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Madam President.

358
00:30:52,605 --> 00:30:53,226
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

359
00:30:53,246 --> 00:30:54,386
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, through you to the family.

360
00:30:54,566 --> 00:30:56,467
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to offer my sincere condolences as well.

361
00:30:57,168 --> 00:30:58,708
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Matarazzo was a friend, a friend.

362
00:30:58,748 --> 00:31:01,350
[SPEAKER_16]: My father's known each other for a long time through the membership.

363
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:06,433
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I had the pleasure to meet him on a number of occasions.

364
00:31:06,473 --> 00:31:10,355
[SPEAKER_16]: Janice and Frank have been good friends for a long time, and I'm very sad they heard that loss.

365
00:31:10,395 --> 00:31:13,576
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just want to join Councilor Caraviello in expressing my condolences personally.

366
00:31:15,137 --> 00:31:15,698

[SPEAKER_04]: Opposed?

[SPEAKER_04]: Please rise for a moment of silence.

[SPEAKER_08]: Babe Kelowna will be traveling from California and will be honored at Fenway Park before the Medford Malden Thanksgiving Day football game.

[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

379

386
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,571
[SPEAKER_13]: He may want to say a few words about the game.

387
00:32:46,211 --> 00:32:46,892
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a nice honor.

388
00:32:47,052 --> 00:32:50,513
[SPEAKER_13]: And like I said, it's a record that's held for the last 50 years.

396
00:33:11,177 --> 00:33:17,282
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to come up with being a week before the game and just give a couple quick things about the game.

397
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I'm happy that constant cover yellow brought this up.

[SPEAKER_09]: They're gonna be honorary captains for the team.

400
00:33:30,032 --> 00:33:31,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are no mystery and pal.

401
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:35,712
[SPEAKER_09]: He's basically the godfather of Mustang Nation at this point.

402
00:33:37,472 --> 00:33:46,054
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to get the schools having the pleasure of honoring two great guys who have done a lot to build on the history of this team.

403
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:51,796
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a lot of great things going on with the school and with the team also in the week.

00:33:51,916 --> 00:34:00,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Tomorrow night they're doing a unified flag football game at McDonnell Field at four o'clock tomorrow with the Medford Malden school students.

405
00:34:02,058 --> 00:34:05,939
[SPEAKER_09]: The school team will be there also to cheer them on, help them out.

406
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:11,900
[SPEAKER_09]: We're also going to be doing a sub-varsity game after that at 5.30, which has become kind of like a little tradition.

407
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:20,142
[SPEAKER_09]: The week before our sub-varsity, our more sophomores and freshmen will be playing Malden sophomores and freshmen.

408
00:34:20,822 --> 00:34:23,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we also have a lot of dinners coming up with the Malden Rotary Club.

409

411
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:37,429
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanna remind the people, the public, that you have to buy your tickets for the game in advance.

412
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:39,570
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not gonna be selling tickets at the door.

413
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:45,873
[SPEAKER_09]: You can go to the Red Sox website on their ticket section and buy them their $20 a ticket.

414
00:34:45,913 --> 00:34:47,594
[SPEAKER_09]: That gets you into both games as well.

415
00:34:47,734 --> 00:34:50,675
[SPEAKER_09]: We are playing the second game.

416
00:34:50,715 --> 00:34:52,616
[SPEAKER_09]: We're hoping for like a 7.30, 7.45 kickoff, depending on how long

417
00:34:56,635 --> 00:35:02,480
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe it's O'Brient and Boston English game, which is gonna be played before Oscos.

418
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,283
[SPEAKER_09]: This is really an exciting thing.

419
00:35:06,303 --> 00:35:11,267
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, this is the 135th time that this game is gonna be played.

420
00:35:11,287 --> 00:35:14,090
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been the third oldest in the country.

421
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,971
[SPEAKER_09]: First game was played November 25th, 1889.

422
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,893
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been played every year since 1891.

423
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:26,305
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's been a lot of great history with this game.

424
00:35:26,365 --> 00:35:31,089
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad that this is going to build off that history.

425
00:35:31,149 --> 00:35:36,092
[SPEAKER_09]: The record doesn't show the great strides that this team has made.

426
00:35:36,373 --> 00:35:37,353
[SPEAKER_09]: They have an amazing coach.

427
00:35:37,393 --> 00:35:41,937
[SPEAKER_09]: John Curley has done a wonderful job with this team these last four years.

428
00:35:43,578 --> 00:35:46,700
[SPEAKER_09]: This team is a young team, a lot of first-year starters.

429
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,484
[SPEAKER_09]: They've done only two wins right now, but they've been in a lot of games this year.

430
00:35:52,407 --> 00:35:53,748
[SPEAKER_09]: We're hoping to end it on a great note.

431
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:56,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Hope to see you all there.

432
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:00,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Hope to see a great presence from the city and go Mustangs.

433
00:36:01,073 --> 00:36:02,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Murphy, yes.

434
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,515
[SPEAKER_05]: You know the words for the Mustang fights, huh?

435
00:36:04,936 --> 00:36:07,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yes.

436
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:14,482
[SPEAKER_09]: And the kids know and hopefully we'll be singing that a lot next Tuesday at Fenway.

437
00:36:15,203 --> 00:36:16,904
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of great things will be on podcast.

438
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they're covering the games are going to have a great.

439
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:24,405
[SPEAKER_09]: hosting, there's gonna be a lot of coverage on their stuff.

440
00:36:24,505 --> 00:36:28,808
[SPEAKER_09]: I know they have to do with the athletic directors and they're gonna be at a couple of the things we have leading up to.

441
00:36:28,868 --> 00:36:35,313
[SPEAKER_09]: So people can go on their site to check out some of the build up to this game.

442
00:36:37,435 --> 00:36:38,236
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't imagine.

443
00:36:39,216 --> 00:36:39,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

444
00:36:39,476 --> 00:36:41,838
[SPEAKER_11]: While you're here, Chris and talk about the football team.

445
00:36:42,478 --> 00:36:46,221
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, what I find amazing is we're talking method.

446
00:36:46,241 --> 00:37:00,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Maldon football game and its history and how much pride that we have is former Mustangs and what it means to everybody in Medford that that whether new or old, understanding how old this game is and what it means to us.

447
00:37:00,289 --> 00:37:01,850
[SPEAKER_11]: So it is important.

448
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:06,513
[SPEAKER_11]: But I also wanted I've noticed something that I haven't seen in a long time here.

449
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:12,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, the football team were raking leaves this past weekend.

450
00:37:12,766 --> 00:37:12,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

451
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:13,766
[SPEAKER_09]: They were out there.

452
00:37:13,927 --> 00:37:16,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, we did, uh, we got about six people that requested us.

453
00:37:17,827 --> 00:37:19,968
[SPEAKER_09]: I did have to teach a couple of kids how to rake a leaf.

454
00:37:20,448 --> 00:37:23,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, there was, uh, definitely some teaching going on, but yeah.

455
00:37:23,889 --> 00:37:28,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and it just, I go back to how awesome of a coach John Curley's baton is.

456
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:34,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, we sat down, uh, a couple of days after he was hired and.

457
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:40,411
[SPEAKER_09]: He said, I want to make them good players, I want to make them good students, and I want to make them good human beings.

458
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:49,739
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is definitely a tough thing, not being able to do a lot of stuff with COVID, now that it's kind of eased up, we'll be able to go out there and do these things.

459
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:56,145
[SPEAKER_09]: And you see them at cheerleading competitions, and at the unified basketball games, and all this stuff.

460
00:37:56,165 --> 00:38:01,550
[SPEAKER_09]: They've become very visible in the community, and they've done a great job with, you know,

461
00:38:02,536 --> 00:38:09,140
[SPEAKER_09]: I always say you're a student athlete second, but you're a model citizen first.

462
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,181
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one thing I always stress to them.

463
00:38:11,781 --> 00:38:15,023
[SPEAKER_09]: They've taken that to heart and we've gotten them out there and they've done some great things.

464
00:38:15,103 --> 00:38:16,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's my point.

465
00:38:16,584 --> 00:38:21,066
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that what we're saying is, I know you brought up the record, but eliminate the record.

466
00:38:22,847 --> 00:38:26,969
[SPEAKER_11]: huge number of kids now, I think it's 60, 70 kids that are playing football.

467
00:38:26,989 --> 00:38:32,052
[SPEAKER_11]: We have, we have, if you see them, it's volunteering at all the recreation events.

468
00:38:32,092 --> 00:38:37,035
[SPEAKER_11]: You see them volunteering at raking, raking people's yards and needs assistance.

469
00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:44,299
[SPEAKER_11]: You see them when, uh, push pulling on the pushing for their, their, um, pro other programs, whether it's a,

470
00:38:44,799 --> 00:38:48,642
[SPEAKER_11]: whether it's a show in the school or whether it's another athletic event.

471
00:38:48,662 --> 00:38:51,344
[SPEAKER_11]: So I give our Medford Mustangs a lot of credit.

472
00:38:51,384 --> 00:38:53,986
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's truly what it's really meant to be.

473
00:38:54,066 --> 00:39:00,130
[SPEAKER_11]: The old days of, you know, the jocks having some sort of persona.

474
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:06,855
[SPEAKER_11]: I commend our, that stigma has now disappeared, at least in my eyes.

475
00:39:06,915 --> 00:39:10,358
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that we are one big family at Medford High School and

476
00:39:10,834 --> 00:39:14,696
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think what keeps them together right now, especially through tough times, are the kids.

477
00:39:14,776 --> 00:39:19,558
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the kids have really stood strong with each other and got them through some tough times.

478
00:39:19,598 --> 00:39:22,339
[SPEAKER_11]: So I commend Coach Curley and your organization.

479
00:39:22,379 --> 00:39:29,403
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wouldn't be, I wouldn't be remiss to sit here and say that John and, John and I are both kind of products of you.

480
00:39:29,423 --> 00:39:38,227
[SPEAKER_09]: And you, I would say that, you know, the 20, 24 years ago that I met you and you and Coach Pear got together and said,

481
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:44,289
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not just soccer players and football players, you guys are Mustangs and got us out there.

482
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:55,219
[SPEAKER_09]: That's rubbed off on John, that's rubbed off on me, and now, gratefully, you're, 24 years later, it's rubbing off on the future generation of Mustangs.

483
00:39:55,279 --> 00:39:56,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, God, I just remember that.

484
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,341
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, we traded right before Thanksgiving.

485
00:39:58,742 --> 00:39:59,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we did.

486
00:39:59,222 --> 00:40:03,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Coach Pierre took a penalty shot on the soccer field, and I took a hand off.

487
00:40:04,346 --> 00:40:05,848
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think Chris lit me up.

488
00:40:08,513 --> 00:40:19,924
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say when you talk about the tradition of this game, I mean, not to knock, this is the first, I think, city council in the last seven decades that hasn't had a football alumni on it.

489
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:23,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Falco, Councilor Miyako, Councilor Skerry.

490
00:40:24,573 --> 00:40:29,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Freshman, I'm sorry, a freshman, we have a freshman football alumni over here.

491
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:36,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello doesn't have that Caraviello blood in him, so we still have that Caraviello blood going through it.

492
00:40:36,617 --> 00:40:48,281
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will say, I tell people this, the four greatest feelings in my life have been the birth of my children, the day I married my wife,

493
00:40:48,937 --> 00:40:49,598
[SPEAKER_09]: and beating Malden.

494
00:40:49,618 --> 00:40:53,260
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to tell you what order they are.

495
00:40:56,283 --> 00:41:07,151
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy that this rivalry is starting to take a good shape and that we have this great opportunity to build some excitement for the program.

496
00:41:11,412 --> 00:41:12,153
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Madam President.

497
00:41:12,193 --> 00:41:19,116
[SPEAKER_12]: It sounds like not only great rivalry, but great sportsmanship, given that they're going to be doing some unified stuff in advance as well, which is fantastic.

498
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:27,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, we have two great, the two FI directors have been awesome with trying to build a great week leading up to this.

499
00:41:27,921 --> 00:41:34,184
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, there is that, you know, I hate to use the word hatred, but there also is that, you know,

500
00:41:36,158 --> 00:41:45,043
[SPEAKER_09]: respect for the tradition of this game and what it means to not only us as Mustangs, but also to the Golden Tornadoes.

501
00:41:46,144 --> 00:41:53,449
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've been president of this organization now for about eight years on the board for the last 10 or 11.

502
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:59,833
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just have, to continue being part of this game every year, it's just, it's amazing.

503
00:41:59,873 --> 00:42:04,256
[SPEAKER_09]: My kids, I was able to take my son to his first Method Molding game last year.

504
00:42:05,496 --> 00:42:12,985
[SPEAKER_09]: My daughter, one of our annual traditions, we take a photo at every first home game, and she loves it.

505
00:42:13,866 --> 00:42:24,338
[SPEAKER_09]: She's a huge fan, and it brings me back to, and I'm sure a lot of you here remember your dad taking you to your first Medford-Malden game, and I'm glad that I've been able to

506
00:42:25,074 --> 00:42:25,574
[SPEAKER_09]: do that.

507
00:42:25,655 --> 00:42:33,821
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, like I said, 100 and 135 games is, you know, we have a, I believe one kid, Justin Marino is a sophomore.

508
00:42:33,841 --> 00:42:35,022
[SPEAKER_09]: He's going to be the third member.

509
00:42:35,062 --> 00:42:37,404
[SPEAKER_09]: He's a third member of his family who's played in this game.

510
00:42:37,444 --> 00:42:47,693
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's, it's one of those multi-generational traditions that you're happy, like, you know, there's, like I said, I've talked to people who don't have that kind of tradition that we have.

511
00:42:47,793 --> 00:42:50,435
[SPEAKER_09]: And they've, like some of them has played

512
00:42:51,793 --> 00:42:54,134
[SPEAKER_09]: multiple different Thanksgiving rivalries.

513
00:42:54,314 --> 00:43:00,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Everett doesn't even have a Thanksgiving game and we're lucky enough to know we're in our 130th game.

514
00:43:00,776 --> 00:43:05,677
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's something that we can be very proud of as a city to be able to have.

515
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:10,879
[SPEAKER_12]: And just if I could, are we going to have a show at halftime by the band?

516
00:43:10,899 --> 00:43:13,040
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the band is going to be there doing the

517
00:43:14,298 --> 00:43:19,460
[SPEAKER_09]: doing the, I believe I talked to Director Miller, the band will be doing the National Anthem.

518
00:43:20,721 --> 00:43:26,063
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the Medford Police, Medford Mountain Police Honor Guard will also be there doing, I'm not sure about halftime though.

519
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:26,383
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

520
00:43:27,144 --> 00:43:30,045
[SPEAKER_09]: I know they will be there doing the National Anthem.

521
00:43:30,585 --> 00:43:31,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, great program.

522
00:43:31,886 --> 00:43:37,688
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I know, and the reason I ask is I wasn't on the field during the game, but I was on the field at halftime in the band.

523
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:37,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

524
00:43:38,188 --> 00:43:41,150
[SPEAKER_12]: And I probably couldn't sing the fight song, but I think I could still play it.

525
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:42,931
[SPEAKER_09]: You could play it.

526
00:43:44,643 --> 00:43:46,424
[SPEAKER_09]: And like I said, you know, it's not just us.

527
00:43:46,564 --> 00:43:49,866
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like I said, the band, the cheerleaders.

528
00:43:51,067 --> 00:43:53,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Chris doesn't have much passion for this.

529
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:57,151
[SPEAKER_09]: I can sit up here and talk all day.

530
00:43:57,171 --> 00:43:57,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Caraviello.

531
00:43:58,091 --> 00:43:58,592
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, ma'am.

532
00:43:58,632 --> 00:44:06,657
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's a special honor for me because it was Amon Caraviello who coached that team for the 16 years.

533
00:44:08,717 --> 00:44:13,979
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, no matter what kind of season you had, if you won on Thanksgiving Day, you were a winner.

534
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:19,762
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, good luck to the team, and I'll be there to root you on.

535
00:44:20,222 --> 00:44:20,662
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't wait.

536
00:44:21,063 --> 00:44:30,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, these seniors this year have a chance to be the first senior class in a long time to have a chance to go out with two wins against Malden.

537
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:33,648
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll be there cheering them on.

538
00:44:33,688 --> 00:44:36,770
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope I'll have you all there cheering them on, and the whole city there cheering them on.

539
00:44:38,845 --> 00:44:44,887
[SPEAKER_10]: As a recent alum and a proud Mustang, I wanted to convey my best wishes.

540
00:44:45,267 --> 00:44:51,770
[SPEAKER_10]: Good luck to the Mustangs, beat Malden, and I am so proud of our team and all that they're doing.

541
00:44:52,629 --> 00:44:55,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam President, if I can, I know that Justin and I already decided.

542
00:44:56,011 --> 00:45:02,335
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna paint an M, Justin's gonna be the E. If anybody'd like to join us to fill in the rest of the Metro.

543
00:45:03,416 --> 00:45:05,357
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see, Justin, we'll see, we're fine.

544
00:45:05,738 --> 00:45:08,199
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll get Larry out.

545
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:10,141
[SPEAKER_09]: 38 degrees right now is what they're called.

546
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:12,002
[SPEAKER_09]: 38 degrees.

547
00:45:12,022 --> 00:45:18,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you're both missing for next week's meeting, we'll know.

548
00:45:20,527 --> 00:45:21,128
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thanks, Chris.

549
00:45:21,648 --> 00:45:22,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys so much for your time.

550
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:23,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion?

551
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:24,490
[SPEAKER_11]: No, sorry.

552
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:28,113
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

553
00:45:28,173 --> 00:45:28,813
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

554
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:28,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

555
00:45:29,013 --> 00:45:29,874
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

556
00:45:29,914 --> 00:45:30,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

557
00:45:31,615 --> 00:45:35,298
[SPEAKER_08]: The records of the meeting of October 25th, 2022 are passed to Councilor Knight.

558
00:45:35,338 --> 00:45:36,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight, how did you find them?

559
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:39,901
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam President, I find that in the subsequent committee reports.

560
00:45:39,941 --> 00:45:40,681
[SPEAKER_15]: In order, I move approval.

561
00:45:41,622 --> 00:45:47,386
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to move approval on the records and committee reports, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

562
00:45:47,406 --> 00:45:47,906
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

563
00:45:47,926 --> 00:45:47,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

564
00:45:48,046 --> 00:45:49,227
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

565
00:45:49,307 --> 00:45:49,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

566
00:45:51,509 --> 00:45:54,771
[SPEAKER_08]: motions, orders and resolutions.

567
00:45:54,791 --> 00:45:56,753
[SPEAKER_08]: 22-570 offered by Councilor Tseng.

568
00:45:57,313 --> 00:46:02,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it so resolved that the City Council ask the City Administration to update the list of permanent parking streets on the City website.

569
00:46:02,697 --> 00:46:03,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Tseng.

570
00:46:03,598 --> 00:46:05,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Morell.

571
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:09,382
[SPEAKER_10]: This resolution comes out of the many meetings that we've had on parking.

572
00:46:09,918 --> 00:46:15,962
[SPEAKER_10]: And something I had heard repeated by a lot of residents was that the list on the website was not updated.

573
00:46:16,402 --> 00:46:28,989
[SPEAKER_10]: And given all the flux that's going on, especially with parking in South Medford and Hillside with the arrival of the Green Line, residents have been frankly just confused about which streets are permitted, which streets aren't.

574
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:32,732
[SPEAKER_10]: And they don't know where they can park.

575
00:46:33,552 --> 00:46:34,513
[SPEAKER_10]: or what the rules are.

576
00:46:34,693 --> 00:46:44,437
[SPEAKER_10]: And so something like this, something like this, that it's updated would really help residents, I think, know exactly where they can park and where they can't park.

577
00:46:44,998 --> 00:46:46,278
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's common sense.

578
00:46:46,919 --> 00:46:54,142
[SPEAKER_10]: And we, you know, this is something that should be consistently updated, but I think we need to give it a little bit of a jolt.

579
00:46:54,162 --> 00:46:55,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Saik.

580
00:46:57,962 --> 00:47:04,608
[SPEAKER_16]: If we could just take that list and send it to the parking office as well, so that they don't put streets to permit parking I think that might be helpful for them as well.

581
00:47:05,408 --> 00:47:06,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

582
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:08,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other discussion from the council.

583
00:47:09,232 --> 00:47:10,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you like to make that an amendment.

584
00:47:11,654 --> 00:47:14,076
[SPEAKER_16]: I just more of a suggestion I know the chief of staffs on the call.

585
00:47:14,436 --> 00:47:15,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

586
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion from the council.

587
00:47:18,868 --> 00:47:23,977
[SPEAKER_08]: being members of the public on the motion of Councilor Tseng second by Councilor Carlyle all those in favor.

588
00:47:23,997 --> 00:47:27,964
[SPEAKER_08]: I was opposed motion passes to do that price and one offered by Councilor Tseng.

589
00:47:28,757 --> 00:47:45,563
[SPEAKER_08]: piece of resolve that the committee of the whole meet and discuss desired improvements to the city website and serve as a public forum to listen to resident feedback on the existing website Councilor Tseng, Thank you, President Morell, this one, this resolution comes out of a lot of conversations I have in the doors last year during campaign season.

590
00:47:47,144 --> 00:47:53,766
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of residents, especially newer residents, when they were moving into Medford, you know, they want to know how the city government works, they want to know

591
00:47:54,466 --> 00:48:00,211
[SPEAKER_10]: what the services are, and a lot of them complained about the navigability of the website as a problem.

592
00:48:00,531 --> 00:48:15,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Furthermore, a lot of residents of color, especially immigrant residents, have told me that they don't really know how to navigate the website because the translation is so poor, because it's not a naturally translated website that uses Google Translate.

593
00:48:16,504 --> 00:48:26,054
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually in an email from the administration this week, we've learned that it's widgets like that that caused the website to crash so frequently, which is yet another problem with our city website.

594
00:48:28,396 --> 00:48:32,801
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we talked about infrastructure as the gateway to our city, which is definitely true.

595
00:48:33,101 --> 00:48:34,402
[SPEAKER_10]: This is digital infrastructure.

596
00:48:35,083 --> 00:48:35,824
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is

597
00:48:37,242 --> 00:48:38,643
[SPEAKER_10]: 21st century gateway to our city.

598
00:48:38,703 --> 00:48:45,067
[SPEAKER_10]: When people think of Medford, when they think about moving here, oftentimes they look on the city website.

599
00:48:45,487 --> 00:48:52,791
[SPEAKER_10]: They look at the city website as a reflection of our city, of the things that we're doing as a community and the services that they can get here.

600
00:48:52,811 --> 00:48:52,871
[SPEAKER_10]: And

601
00:48:55,740 --> 00:49:00,062
[SPEAKER_10]: the level of transparency and communication there is between the city and between its residents.

602
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:20,813
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I believe that meeting in the committee of whole would give us a chance to hear from residents about what the vision that they want to see from our website to gather more feedback for our administration and for our city in general, moving forward as we do move on to a new platform, which I believe is we're in the process of currently.

603
00:49:21,693 --> 00:49:24,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion from the council?

604
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,241
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just want to thank you for bringing this up.

605
00:49:28,301 --> 00:49:37,243
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think so often sometimes as Councilors, we help with information that folks are trying to self-serve, they're trying to find out the website, they're trying to do it themselves and it simply doesn't exist.

606
00:49:37,283 --> 00:49:38,804
[SPEAKER_08]: They hit dead ends, they hit dead pages.

607
00:49:38,864 --> 00:49:49,467
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think not only meeting the committee of the whole, I do understand that the administration is working on updating the website, but meeting the committee of the whole and really having that opportunity for folks to come out and say what they'd like to say, I think that's a great idea.

608
00:49:49,507 --> 00:49:51,028
[SPEAKER_08]: So I appreciate you bringing this paper forward.

609
00:49:52,008 --> 00:49:54,429
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the motion of Councilor Tseng a second by,

610
00:49:56,025 --> 00:49:57,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Caraviello, all those in favor?

611
00:49:57,406 --> 00:49:59,568
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

612
00:49:59,588 --> 00:50:02,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

613
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:03,671
[SPEAKER_08]: 22-572 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

614
00:50:03,811 --> 00:50:15,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it so resolved that the Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability update the Council on the plan to assist residents who will be needing assistance with home heating and energy costs and later the recent increases in oil, gas, and electricity costs.

615
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Caraviello.

616
00:50:16,641 --> 00:50:17,641
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

617
00:50:19,062 --> 00:50:20,363
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we've all seen

618
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:31,518
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the things that have gone on the last couple of months about national grid doubling this rate, oil prices, $5 a gallon and up.

619
00:50:33,093 --> 00:50:40,699
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, in the past, it was always, we were always helping the people out with fuel assistance, but now there's gas, which they're talking about maybe running out of gas.

620
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,681
[SPEAKER_13]: The rates of gas have gone up, electric's gone up.

621
00:50:43,761 --> 00:50:44,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Everything's gone up.

622
00:50:44,782 --> 00:50:49,766
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, now it's, the word is now, it's either heat or eat for some of these people.

623
00:50:50,126 --> 00:50:58,593
[SPEAKER_13]: So I did speak with Alicia on this, and she will come back and let the residents know

624
00:50:59,073 --> 00:51:04,075
[SPEAKER_13]: what programs and what things are going to be available to them, because this is going to be a tough winter.

625
00:51:04,656 --> 00:51:15,200
[SPEAKER_13]: Some people, especially with the cost, and, you know, forget about the oil and gas, you know, you're going to see people going with space heaters and this is how fires happen.

626
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:21,843
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's see what we can do to help the residents going forward with whatever programs available to them.

627
00:51:22,404 --> 00:51:23,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

628
00:51:23,864 --> 00:51:25,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion from the Council?

629
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:35,048
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do just wanna know, I do just wanna know, I know off the top of my head, there's LIHEAP, L-I-H-E-A-P, that's offered through ABCD.

630
00:51:35,108 --> 00:51:47,455
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you Google, anyone may be watching or know someone, if you Google fuel assistance, ABCD, there are programs there for fuel assistance, but it's one of many programs, that's just the one I'm most familiar with.

631
00:51:47,495 --> 00:51:53,119
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Tseng, all those in favor?

632
00:51:53,139 --> 00:51:54,359
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

633
00:51:54,379 --> 00:51:54,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

634
00:51:56,678 --> 00:51:58,519
[SPEAKER_08]: petitions, presentations and similar papers.

635
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:08,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Petition for a second hand articles licensed by Cameron Javido, 48 Gold Street, Boston, Massachusetts code 2132 for pro repair 19 Salem Street, Medford Mass code 2155.

636
00:52:09,887 --> 00:52:14,289
[SPEAKER_08]: So we actually did have a committee of the whole on this last week that addressed some of the council's questions and concerns.

637
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:19,333
[SPEAKER_08]: We did land I think on adding some conditions for approval.

638
00:52:19,893 --> 00:52:33,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I know that I talked to City Clerk this evening, and the fire was put out by our meeting, and I thank you, Council President, for putting that through.

639
00:52:35,387 --> 00:52:41,613
[SPEAKER_11]: This business will not be what is feared to be a pawn shop, so with that part of the record,

640
00:52:42,253 --> 00:52:57,921
[SPEAKER_11]: We would have special conditions to this special permit that this this will be allowed only to sell used and new phones and uses a repair shop for only phones, tablets and computers.

641
00:53:00,563 --> 00:53:10,128
[SPEAKER_11]: With those stipulations that would go with the with the permit and, um, stay with the person that, um, that has petitions.

642
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:10,568
[SPEAKER_11]: Perfect.

643
00:53:10,588 --> 00:53:11,589
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

644
00:53:12,645 --> 00:53:13,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other discussion on this paper?

645
00:53:16,107 --> 00:53:20,070
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight to move for approval as amended.

646
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, do you have that language for the conditions?

647
00:53:25,353 --> 00:53:28,255
[SPEAKER_08]: So motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice Chair Bears.

648
00:53:28,275 --> 00:53:30,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry?

649
00:53:30,756 --> 00:53:31,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Approve with conditions.

650
00:53:32,277 --> 00:53:33,318
[SPEAKER_07]: To approve with conditions.

651
00:53:34,829 --> 00:53:37,451
[SPEAKER_06]: I write it up, when I write it up, it says approved.

652
00:53:37,831 --> 00:53:40,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Assuming you approve, it says approved with conditions as amended.

653
00:53:40,533 --> 00:53:41,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.

654
00:53:41,033 --> 00:53:41,473
[SPEAKER_08]: So everything.

655
00:53:42,014 --> 00:53:44,495
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice Mayor Bears.

656
00:53:45,016 --> 00:53:45,756
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

657
00:53:45,776 --> 00:53:45,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

658
00:53:45,976 --> 00:53:47,357
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

659
00:53:47,597 --> 00:53:48,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

660
00:53:50,530 --> 00:54:00,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Communications from the mayor, 22-560, to President Fulmerill and honorable members of the Medford City Council, from Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn, regarding appropriation requests for new senior planner position.

661
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:14,402
[SPEAKER_08]: I respectfully request use of available funds in the amount of $55,267 in planning development sustainability salaries, account 0102975110, to establish the new position of senior planner.

662
00:54:14,802 --> 00:54:18,564
[SPEAKER_08]: I request this before you to add the senior planner position to cap 14, paper number 22-502,

663
00:54:20,606 --> 00:54:27,941
[SPEAKER_08]: This appropriation funds the position for a total of 32.4 weeks in FY23, with an expected hire date of November 15, 2022.

664
00:54:30,023 --> 00:54:49,300
[SPEAKER_08]: As discussed in the September 9, 2022 memo from myself and PDS director, Alicia Hunt explaining this CAP request, this position will be funded using the available salary for the land use planner position included in the FY23 PDS budget, a position that is currently vacant and which PDS will not fill if the senior planner position is approved.

665
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:49,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

666
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:55,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Hunt, I don't see her when this was originally presented, is available to speak to this request as well as paper 22-502.

667
00:54:56,656 --> 00:55:00,022
[SPEAKER_08]: and answer any questions you may have respectfully submitted.

668
00:55:00,203 --> 00:55:02,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor.

669
00:55:02,988 --> 00:55:07,055
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam President, we talked about this extensively at our last regular meeting.

670
00:55:08,157 --> 00:55:08,378
[SPEAKER_12]: And I

671
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:14,874
[SPEAKER_12]: brought up the point that I think we should look at these cases on the merits.

672
00:55:16,455 --> 00:55:31,207
[SPEAKER_12]: In this case, we have a vacant position planning position, and the request is coming from an office that has worked closely in partnership with this council in spite of the communication and leadership issues that we've seen in the city administration.

673
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:37,052
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a position that would directly assist us in advancing the core work that we've been doing around zoning.

674
00:55:37,832 --> 00:55:41,256
[SPEAKER_12]: that has already borne fruit, big fruits for this community.

675
00:55:42,857 --> 00:55:44,939
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, it would not appropriate any new funding.

676
00:55:45,019 --> 00:55:49,544
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a reappropriation of existing funding to fill a currently vacant planning position.

677
00:55:49,564 --> 00:55:55,329
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that on those case points, this meets the merits of approval.

678
00:55:56,409 --> 00:56:10,095
[SPEAKER_12]: I was very clear earlier on a similar on a not necessarily similar request on a different request from the administration for additional funding for an existing petition for a raise for a position where we haven't been receiving the information we need that I don't support that.

679
00:56:10,776 --> 00:56:14,177
[SPEAKER_12]: In this case and I said it last time and I'll try not to belabor it more right now.

680
00:56:14,197 --> 00:56:20,440
[SPEAKER_12]: This is an office that's working with us on our core goals to advance our priorities so that we can win major benefits for the city.

681
00:56:20,974 --> 00:56:28,756
[SPEAKER_12]: that's happening in spite of the fact that, you know, the mayor has never been here for a conversation on zoning in the three years that we've, that I've been on this council working on zoning.

682
00:56:28,916 --> 00:56:42,419
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is something that I can support because I think it advances our work directly and makes sure that we have the necessary support that we need in an office that is working on planning and bringing in the development that we need to move the city forward.

683
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:43,679
[SPEAKER_12]: So I will be supporting this.

684
00:56:43,719 --> 00:56:44,039
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

685
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:47,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Madam President.

686
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:48,800
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate Councilor Villes.

687
00:56:49,476 --> 00:56:51,197
[SPEAKER_11]: comments, I think they are important.

688
00:56:51,217 --> 00:56:58,163
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, it brings us back to where are we going to be once we see these numbers?

689
00:57:01,565 --> 00:57:12,534
[SPEAKER_11]: My fear is once we start to see these numbers and we see the dire fiscal emergency we'll be in, you're talking about a position that will probably be gone in three months anyway.

690
00:57:13,795 --> 00:57:16,697
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the first thing you're going to do is start

691
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,260
[SPEAKER_11]: letting go of people.

692
00:57:20,401 --> 00:57:26,744
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's all that I can think of because of the lack of information.

693
00:57:28,645 --> 00:57:32,367
[SPEAKER_11]: We were bleeding last year, and we pushed through in the final minute.

694
00:57:33,205 --> 00:57:43,269
[SPEAKER_11]: for our budget last year, and I don't see any new growth, I don't see anything that shows us financially that we'll be stable.

695
00:57:43,569 --> 00:57:53,533
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, it's putting in a position that's going to get somebody ready to go, in a position to support what we need, which in turn

696
00:57:54,195 --> 00:58:06,045
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been waiting, and we've started a dialogue with bringing in a representative, legal representative, hopefully Attorney Hrabowski to help us with the zoning, continue with our zoning information.

697
00:58:07,438 --> 00:58:15,305
[SPEAKER_11]: We're gonna be in the same situation that this person's gonna work for a few months and then they're gonna be let go because we can't sustain their position.

698
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:16,846
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my fear.

699
00:58:17,707 --> 00:58:22,011
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is why I can't vote for any money paper because I don't know.

700
00:58:22,251 --> 00:58:29,698
[SPEAKER_11]: So what we're going to do is we're gonna vote for a position that right now is pretty, it's not secure.

701
00:58:29,898 --> 00:58:32,820
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it's open, I know the money's there, but

702
00:58:33,733 --> 00:58:48,416
[SPEAKER_11]: What's gonna happen in a few months when we finally get paperwork that shows that we're in dire straits and we're looking at teachers, we're looking at fire, we're looking at policemen, we're looking at custodians, you're looking at paraprofessionals, you're looking at city hall staff.

703
00:58:50,136 --> 00:58:56,337
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the only thing that I fear, putting the next few months into someone's position and then letting them go.

704
00:58:57,377 --> 00:59:00,118
[SPEAKER_11]: There isn't a clear dialogue, that's what I'm trying to get at right now.

705
00:59:01,118 --> 00:59:03,898
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have a clear vision of what our budget's going to look like.

706
00:59:04,899 --> 00:59:29,363
[SPEAKER_11]: So when we keep putting money and putting these caps through and putting these upgrades, trying to keep putting these upgrades in, the uncertainty is so clear that all we're going to be doing is hiring people right now and approving positions that are gonna serve as time cost and time wasted because it'll be time to move forward past these people.

707
00:59:31,158 --> 00:59:31,998
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what I fear.

708
00:59:32,098 --> 00:59:46,501
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that, like again, I said, I cannot support any money position right now without a clear understanding what our financial and fiscal weaknesses and strengths are moving forward.

709
00:59:47,181 --> 00:59:56,843
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, we have teachers, you saw what happened in Malden yesterday, work to rule, I believe our teachers already started work to rule.

710
00:59:57,843 --> 01:00:00,784
[SPEAKER_11]: Melrose, excuse me, I think our teachers already did that without the fanfare.

711
01:00:01,463 --> 01:00:03,284
[SPEAKER_11]: But, and we haven't heard anything.

712
01:00:03,344 --> 01:00:04,164
[SPEAKER_11]: There's been no movement.

713
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,044
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we haven't heard.

714
01:00:06,285 --> 01:00:08,425
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's, it's, you know, firemen as well.

715
01:00:09,185 --> 01:00:11,486
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's, it's been, you know, a lot more.

716
01:00:11,586 --> 01:00:18,288
[SPEAKER_11]: So until we get a true understanding what's happening financial in this community, I can't support any money paper.

717
01:00:18,328 --> 01:00:19,829
[SPEAKER_11]: So I, I believe me, I, I,

718
01:00:20,977 --> 01:00:24,082
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand my fellow Councilors and their vision.

719
01:00:24,142 --> 01:00:26,605
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it makes a lot of sense.

720
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:30,471
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think that on the other side, this is where I stand.

721
01:00:31,072 --> 01:00:33,996
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just appreciate the conversation.

722
01:00:34,016 --> 01:00:35,037
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you, Madam President.

723
01:00:35,057 --> 01:00:35,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

724
01:00:35,879 --> 01:00:36,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Collins.

725
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:40,879
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Morell, and I appreciate the discussion around this.

726
01:00:41,899 --> 01:00:48,724
[SPEAKER_14]: I also don't want to belabor the points that I made the last time this was on our agenda, but I want to say, you know, I'm sympathetic to some of the other concerns that I'm hearing tonight.

727
01:00:48,744 --> 01:00:55,989
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember after we, you know, finally passed the budget in June, on July 1st, what was on my mind was fiscal year 24.

728
01:00:57,110 --> 01:01:00,392
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it was, it was so immediately apparent, you know,

729
01:01:01,647 --> 01:01:03,349
[SPEAKER_14]: Our issues are not behind us.

730
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:06,031
[SPEAKER_14]: Our budgetary concerns are not behind us.

731
01:01:06,111 --> 01:01:11,535
[SPEAKER_14]: We're already kind of staring down the barrel of what we're going to hear about in, you know, hopefully May of next year.

732
01:01:11,555 --> 01:01:12,676
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully it's not June again.

733
01:01:13,477 --> 01:01:26,748
[SPEAKER_14]: But that being said, you know, like we talked about last month, or like I said last month, you know, to me, I'll be supporting this paper tonight because Medford is experiencing growing pains.

734
01:01:27,325 --> 01:01:33,989
[SPEAKER_14]: and this position I feel is necessary to help us evolve thoughtfully and appropriately and intentionally and plan for the future that we want.

735
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:38,112
[SPEAKER_14]: And to me, leaving this position unfilled is leaving opportunity on the table.

736
01:01:38,752 --> 01:01:47,477
[SPEAKER_14]: The Planning Development and Sustainability Office is, you know, one of the most productive departments that we have in the city hall for actually increasing revenue for our city.

737
01:01:49,279 --> 01:01:51,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, the future is incredibly uncertain and that

738
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:56,603
[SPEAKER_14]: creates a lot of anxiety for me and for so many other people who care about this community.

739
01:01:58,104 --> 01:02:10,051
[SPEAKER_14]: But I am fearful of what will happen, the opportunities we'll leave on the table, the people that will lose to other communities if we don't create opportunities for growth within our city hierarchy.

740
01:02:10,851 --> 01:02:11,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

741
01:02:11,992 --> 01:02:12,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

742
01:02:12,772 --> 01:02:13,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Tse.

743
01:02:14,133 --> 01:02:14,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Morell.

744
01:02:15,054 --> 01:02:18,956
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe a lot of the points I wanted to make have been made by fellow councilors.

745
01:02:20,516 --> 01:02:28,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, I think it's important to address the fact that we have a revenue problem in the city, that we have a new growth problem in the city.

746
01:02:29,263 --> 01:02:43,054
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that's off of anyone's minds, but when I think about how we get out of that problem, how we get out of the hole, a position like this is key to getting out of that situation.

747
01:02:44,158 --> 01:02:54,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Having a senior planner who can bring revenue to our city, I think, is an integral part to both the council and the city more broadly.

748
01:02:55,168 --> 01:03:02,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Both of our approaches to getting out of the revenue situation and to making Medford a better place when it comes to

749
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:08,716
[SPEAKER_10]: having vibrant squares when it comes to affordable housing, when it comes to climate goals.

750
01:03:10,037 --> 01:03:12,720
[SPEAKER_10]: This is exactly the position that we need in Medford.

751
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:20,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I believe strongly that we need to look at these things on a case-by-case basis, particularly because of the financial situation.

752
01:03:21,109 --> 01:03:26,234
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but I believe that this case as Councilor bear said, um, has its merits.

753
01:03:27,015 --> 01:03:31,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and I think we I think that is why I will personally vote.

754
01:03:31,999 --> 01:03:33,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, yes, on this.

755
01:03:34,061 --> 01:03:35,703
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, again, we've heard.

756
01:03:36,824 --> 01:03:43,232
[SPEAKER_10]: a few times now that the appropriations for this position in particular are coming from re-appropriation.

757
01:03:43,272 --> 01:03:48,058
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not like we're taking the money out of the bank.

758
01:03:48,459 --> 01:03:53,846
[SPEAKER_10]: This is money that we've already appropriated to a similar goal.

759
01:03:54,446 --> 01:04:05,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, another reason why I think we are particularly pressed to address this now is because we are competing with other municipalities to fill roles like this as well.

760
01:04:07,055 --> 01:04:14,260
[SPEAKER_10]: And when we are competing on that market, we need to make sure that we're getting out there first, getting out there early.

761
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:20,464
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're already, you know, I mean, I think residents in the city know that we already have work to do to catch up.

762
01:04:21,925 --> 01:04:40,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, this, this is a lesson that my fellow Councilors, Councilor Caraviello comes to mind, but I've taught have taught me that it's important to be proactive to act out in front, and to put, to put out the hiring signs early, and this is something that we need to do, in my opinion.

763
01:04:40,814 --> 01:04:42,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Caraviello.

764
01:04:42,054 --> 01:04:42,695
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you Madam President.

765
01:04:45,208 --> 01:04:47,770
[SPEAKER_13]: As I look at the position, this is a position that's needed.

766
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:48,931
[SPEAKER_13]: I can tell you it's not.

767
01:04:49,852 --> 01:04:54,476
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, Councilor Tseng made a comment about positions being put out early.

768
01:04:54,496 --> 01:04:56,358
[SPEAKER_13]: This position's not put out early.

769
01:04:56,878 --> 01:04:58,199
[SPEAKER_13]: We're three years late on this position.

770
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:08,148
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we're on the end of this boom, this bioscience or life science boom.

771
01:05:09,249 --> 01:05:10,169
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kind of at the end now.

772
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:12,972
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, we've gone,

773
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:19,213
[SPEAKER_13]: three years of this administration with no shovel in the ground on any project.

774
01:05:20,013 --> 01:05:27,978
[SPEAKER_13]: We've had projects that we fought in court that probably could have been ready to be moved into now.

775
01:05:28,198 --> 01:05:30,019
[SPEAKER_13]: And we talked about the affordable housing.

776
01:05:34,121 --> 01:05:41,165
[SPEAKER_13]: The city fought three projects of affordable housing, which probably would have given us 300 to 400 units of affordable housing.

777
01:05:42,743 --> 01:05:43,803
[SPEAKER_13]: And what did we do?

778
01:05:44,063 --> 01:05:47,165
[SPEAKER_13]: We probably spent a million dollars in legal fees on court.

779
01:05:47,585 --> 01:05:51,266
[SPEAKER_13]: And here we are now, three years later, and nothing is growing.

780
01:05:52,287 --> 01:05:57,448
[SPEAKER_13]: If a project were to start tomorrow, we're not going to see the fruits of those labors for another three years.

781
01:05:59,029 --> 01:06:10,013
[SPEAKER_13]: If we started this three years ago, when we should have started them, when these people came in, we probably would have had $8 to $10 million in building payment fees, and we would have been generating some taxes on those things.

782
01:06:10,393 --> 01:06:11,714
[SPEAKER_13]: So do we need a plan?

783
01:06:12,314 --> 01:06:13,835
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, we do.

784
01:06:14,035 --> 01:06:16,896
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do want to support this, because I think it's needed.

785
01:06:16,936 --> 01:06:19,137
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that department needs help.

786
01:06:19,777 --> 01:06:22,278
[SPEAKER_13]: But we need to have a partner in

787
01:06:23,493 --> 01:06:25,274
[SPEAKER_13]: the Conora and then the center office there.

788
01:06:26,114 --> 01:06:32,916
[SPEAKER_13]: And I say, everyone's made good points on this, but again, I just don't know.

789
01:06:32,976 --> 01:06:34,276
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know where to go with this anymore.

790
01:06:35,417 --> 01:06:37,697
[SPEAKER_13]: We're always late to the table with everything.

791
01:06:39,858 --> 01:06:40,858
[SPEAKER_13]: That's about it for me at the moment.

792
01:06:41,499 --> 01:06:42,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

793
01:06:42,819 --> 01:06:43,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion from the council?

794
01:06:43,859 --> 01:06:44,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

795
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:50,941
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam President, apparently this paper that was before us tonight, November 15th, 2022,

796
01:06:53,331 --> 01:06:57,492
[SPEAKER_16]: with an expected hire date for the person in the position of tonight, November 15th, 2022.

797
01:06:58,092 --> 01:07:06,994
[SPEAKER_16]: This position must obviously not fall under this nationwide municipal hiring crisis, obviously, right?

798
01:07:07,234 --> 01:07:15,116
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, geez, we talked about all these positions that couldn't be filled, but here we are, we have a paper that was given to us at our last meeting, and they expect it to be filled today.

799
01:07:15,596 --> 01:07:16,596
[SPEAKER_16]: This is amazing to me.

800
01:07:17,137 --> 01:07:18,237
[SPEAKER_16]: You know why it's amazing to me?

801
01:07:18,497 --> 01:07:19,977
[SPEAKER_16]: Because it's not fair and it's not equitable.

802
01:07:20,637 --> 01:07:22,998
[SPEAKER_16]: Because when we had a presentation last week,

803
01:07:23,675 --> 01:07:26,217
[SPEAKER_16]: it became very clear to me that this job was spoken for.

804
01:07:27,498 --> 01:07:27,778
[SPEAKER_16]: All right?

805
01:07:28,018 --> 01:07:29,439
[SPEAKER_16]: This isn't a job that's being posted.

806
01:07:30,159 --> 01:07:32,681
[SPEAKER_16]: This isn't a job where we're going out and recruiting talent.

807
01:07:33,302 --> 01:07:36,844
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a job where we're creating a job on the inside to take care of somebody.

808
01:07:37,384 --> 01:07:37,584
[SPEAKER_16]: All right?

809
01:07:37,645 --> 01:07:38,205
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's be clear.

810
01:07:38,585 --> 01:07:40,727
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, let's really see what's going on here.

811
01:07:40,847 --> 01:07:41,067
[SPEAKER_16]: All right?

812
01:07:41,227 --> 01:07:47,771
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's look at the history of personnel and employment in this community, in labor relations in this community over the last three years.

813
01:07:48,512 --> 01:07:48,772
[SPEAKER_16]: All right?

814
01:07:49,913 --> 01:07:52,875
[SPEAKER_16]: If you're a friend of the mayor, we're going to create a job for you and give you a raise.

815
01:07:54,033 --> 01:07:58,536
[SPEAKER_16]: If you're not, if you're not, we're going to investigate you.

816
01:08:01,437 --> 01:08:02,158
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to fire you.

817
01:08:03,078 --> 01:08:04,599
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to have you taken out in handcuffs.

818
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:08,301
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to make you submit to psychological evaluations.

819
01:08:10,803 --> 01:08:12,924
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you're part of organized labor, forget about it.

820
01:08:14,024 --> 01:08:14,545
[SPEAKER_16]: Forget about it.

821
01:08:14,845 --> 01:08:20,248
[SPEAKER_16]: The way that you get treated if you're part of organized labor in this community is like dog meat, chopped liver.

822
01:08:20,882 --> 01:08:25,764
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, how dare you be part of an organization that stands up for itself and fights for equity and rights in the workplace?

823
01:08:27,485 --> 01:08:30,386
[SPEAKER_16]: What I look at this as, what I see this as, is it's an end around.

824
01:08:30,866 --> 01:08:36,969
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, they want to give somebody a raise, but they can't do it under the confines of the existing cap position.

825
01:08:37,329 --> 01:08:40,911
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, they want to take care of one of their own, and they want to increase somebody's wealth.

826
01:08:41,531 --> 01:08:48,694
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, we have how many workers that have come up before us fighting, fighting for a fair and equitable cost of living adjustment?

827
01:08:48,974 --> 01:08:49,695
[SPEAKER_16]: That's far less.

828
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:53,076
[SPEAKER_16]: in the race that comes with these reclassification papers.

829
01:08:53,936 --> 01:09:06,022
[SPEAKER_16]: So week in and week out, we get select papers to give select individuals select raises that well exceed the mayor's 2.5% target, resistance point.

830
01:09:06,622 --> 01:09:07,362
[SPEAKER_16]: Well exceed that.

831
01:09:07,822 --> 01:09:08,823
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's good for those people.

832
01:09:09,543 --> 01:09:17,246
[SPEAKER_16]: But when it comes to the rank and file working people that carry the city on their back, it's not good enough for them.

833
01:09:17,266 --> 01:09:18,527
[SPEAKER_16]: So we want to talk about equity.

834
01:09:19,803 --> 01:09:22,785
[SPEAKER_16]: which I know is a big, big topic among some of us in this council.

835
01:09:23,205 --> 01:09:24,346
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to talk about fairness.

836
01:09:26,047 --> 01:09:26,667
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's look at that.

837
01:09:28,108 --> 01:09:29,229
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's look at equity and fairness.

838
01:09:29,249 --> 01:09:30,549
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's look at the morale in this building.

839
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,591
[SPEAKER_16]: What message are we sending these workers?

840
01:09:33,571 --> 01:09:36,533
[SPEAKER_16]: We are creating positions and giving people raises, left and right.

841
01:09:37,794 --> 01:09:46,019
[SPEAKER_16]: We have organized labor coming up here, week in and week out, week in and week out, asking for our support, asking for our help.

842
01:09:46,859 --> 01:09:48,340
[SPEAKER_16]: I cannot support this paper this evening.

843
01:09:49,408 --> 01:09:52,610
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't like the idea of making an appropriation before we create the classification.

844
01:09:55,651 --> 01:09:57,592
[SPEAKER_04]: The classification doesn't pass, the money's still gone.

845
01:09:58,293 --> 01:09:59,153
[SPEAKER_04]: We've shipped the money away.

846
01:10:01,655 --> 01:10:02,935
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't support this paper this evening.

847
01:10:03,415 --> 01:10:07,558
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think it's fair, I don't think it's equitable, and I don't think it falls in line with the values that this council has.

848
01:10:08,918 --> 01:10:10,379
[SPEAKER_16]: We talk the talk, let's walk the walk.

849
01:10:10,619 --> 01:10:11,940
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's stand with these working people.

850
01:10:12,571 --> 01:10:15,113
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's stand with organized labor, and let's say, no, enough's enough.

851
01:10:15,153 --> 01:10:16,093
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not playing favorites.

852
01:10:16,674 --> 01:10:21,157
[SPEAKER_16]: A rising tide is going to float all ships, not just the ones that go along to get along.

853
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:24,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

854
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:26,701
[SPEAKER_04]: President Barros.

855
01:10:27,201 --> 01:10:28,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

856
01:10:28,142 --> 01:10:31,264
[SPEAKER_12]: And I appreciate the discussion that we've all had tonight.

857
01:10:32,065 --> 01:10:36,728
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can understand how folks could vote either way on this paper.

858
01:10:37,188 --> 01:10:39,390
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we all share the frustration with the budget.

859
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:42,152
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we all share the frustration with the communication.

860
01:10:42,696 --> 01:10:44,598
[SPEAKER_12]: from the mayor's office.

861
01:10:45,899 --> 01:10:49,001
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think we all share the fear that Councilor Scarpelli raised.

862
01:10:50,242 --> 01:10:51,363
[SPEAKER_12]: Last year's budget was a mess.

863
01:10:52,404 --> 01:10:54,906
[SPEAKER_12]: We're six months in, or five, right?

864
01:10:54,946 --> 01:10:58,349
[SPEAKER_12]: Five, whatever, four and a half, five, almost six months in.

865
01:10:58,369 --> 01:10:59,810
[SPEAKER_12]: We're almost halfway through the fiscal year.

866
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:07,436
[SPEAKER_12]: We haven't had the updates and we've been sent letters that give deadlines that haven't been met yet.

867
01:11:09,277 --> 01:11:12,180
[SPEAKER_12]: Now they're vague deadlines, so maybe they, you know,

868
01:11:12,899 --> 01:11:13,679
[SPEAKER_12]: They're vague deadlines.

869
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:18,201
[SPEAKER_12]: But I can say one thing about this position.

870
01:11:19,001 --> 01:11:19,902
[SPEAKER_12]: We talk about new growth.

871
01:11:21,422 --> 01:11:22,963
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a position that helps with new growth.

872
01:11:23,523 --> 01:11:33,107
[SPEAKER_12]: We talk about capacity in the planning office to maybe move faster on a couple of projects to bring in some permit fees that could come through quickly under the plan development district.

873
01:11:33,993 --> 01:11:37,934
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know it wears socks for us to also put the plan development district fee in, which could bring in money.

874
01:11:38,714 --> 01:11:48,535
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are things that will directly support the staff and workers of this community because they will potentially prevent reductions in force that we're worried about.

875
01:11:49,796 --> 01:11:57,997
[SPEAKER_12]: If we can bring in $500,000 or a million dollars that we wouldn't have otherwise brought in because we can move through a process a little faster, that's job saved.

876
01:11:59,397 --> 01:12:00,998
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think we should be real clear about that.

877
01:12:02,338 --> 01:12:03,298
[SPEAKER_12]: I completely agree.

878
01:12:04,104 --> 01:12:12,686
[SPEAKER_12]: with what Councilor Knight said about the disrespect and disdain that the administration has shown to almost all, if not all, of the labor partners in our community.

879
01:12:13,767 --> 01:12:15,227
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's completely true.

880
01:12:15,267 --> 01:12:15,727
[SPEAKER_12]: We've seen it.

881
01:12:17,508 --> 01:12:31,912
[SPEAKER_12]: Multiple units, unfair labor practices, completely no practices filed, rulings made that are clearly against the city, and then the city doubling down after a negative ruling to keep pushing on something that they've just been told is unacceptable.

882
01:12:31,932 --> 01:12:33,272
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's all horrible.

883
01:12:34,513 --> 01:12:36,834
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think you're completely right that we need to stand up and stop it.

884
01:12:38,415 --> 01:12:43,197
[SPEAKER_12]: This position, you know, we're not handing out things left and right.

885
01:12:43,438 --> 01:12:49,981
[SPEAKER_12]: This council has shot down, I think almost every single CAF request and appropriation request that's come before us since January.

886
01:12:51,181 --> 01:12:59,005
[SPEAKER_12]: We've shot them down for the department heads who work directly for the mayor, for the people who you're talking about maybe on the go along to get along train.

887
01:12:59,686 --> 01:13:01,126
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not what this position is.

888
01:13:02,127 --> 01:13:03,608
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't think that voting this through

889
01:13:04,613 --> 01:13:07,055
[SPEAKER_12]: is a slap in the face to anybody.

890
01:13:07,455 --> 01:13:10,358
[SPEAKER_12]: Now I'm willing to hear again, more discussion, more arguments on it.

891
01:13:10,938 --> 01:13:21,047
[SPEAKER_12]: We're talking about a rank and file person in the department, a position that needs to be filled, and from the presentation that was made three weeks ago at our regular meeting when this was presented,

892
01:13:21,746 --> 01:13:25,008
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not that there's someone the fix is in and there's someone who's going to get this position.

893
01:13:25,749 --> 01:13:49,647
[SPEAKER_12]: It's that there have been, you know, basically that there's a person who's sharing two positions right now, and they've come to a determination that you could have a housing planner, a CPA administrator, and if you can create this position, this position, and actually boost the capacity and leverage CPA funding on the other end so that you have a full-time CPA administrator as well, like they do in many other communities.

894
01:13:51,506 --> 01:14:01,518
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, again, I'm not 100% sure, but it would also seem to me that these are positions that could be organized, if they're not already organized, they could be additional membership for labor in our community.

895
01:14:01,578 --> 01:14:08,426
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, I don't see this as being in any way in conflict with the fact that we've stood strong and said,

896
01:14:09,938 --> 01:14:14,881
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't agree with the legal opinion on acting positions and raises that have been approved without this council.

897
01:14:15,661 --> 01:14:20,684
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we have, how many are sitting on here?

898
01:14:20,704 --> 01:14:29,869
[SPEAKER_12]: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 CAF proposals and amendments that have been sitting on the table for over a year because we've been unsatisfied.

899
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:31,990
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't think we're handing things out left and right.

900
01:14:33,313 --> 01:14:39,714
[SPEAKER_12]: And this one meets the grade for me and I'm not moving forward on the other 12 and we just didn't move forward on another one tonight because we're unsatisfied.

901
01:14:40,055 --> 01:14:45,456
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think we can stand hand in hand with the workers of the city who make the city work.

902
01:14:47,356 --> 01:14:58,959
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's what, quite frankly, we'd be doing to this worker here who's going to be bringing in new growth and support for the city and in an ideal world and hopefully what will be happening over the next six months helping this council

903
01:14:59,506 --> 01:15:13,654
[SPEAKER_12]: bring in the long needed revenue that has been needed in the permit fees and the planning development district fees so that we can be the leaders who help to prevent reductions in force because of a bad budget that, you know, the mayor told us we're gonna get.

904
01:15:14,075 --> 01:15:16,036
[SPEAKER_12]: She told us six months ago, the next one's gonna be bad.

905
01:15:16,336 --> 01:15:19,458
[SPEAKER_12]: And then hasn't told us any updates on anything that they're doing to try to fix it.

906
01:15:19,738 --> 01:15:21,759
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's how I see this position.

907
01:15:21,779 --> 01:15:23,800
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, I respect how anyone votes on this tonight.

908
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,381
[SPEAKER_12]: We are in a real mess.

909
01:15:29,061 --> 01:15:30,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, ma'am.

910
01:15:31,223 --> 01:15:34,085
[SPEAKER_13]: How many applicants do we have for this positions?

911
01:15:34,685 --> 01:15:35,205
[SPEAKER_13]: This position.

912
01:15:36,986 --> 01:15:39,188
[SPEAKER_08]: No, uh, to next step is Aaron.

913
01:15:39,208 --> 01:15:39,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you speak to that?

914
01:15:39,888 --> 01:15:41,289
[SPEAKER_08]: The number of applicants for this position?

915
01:15:41,309 --> 01:15:43,951
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have the answer to that question.

916
01:15:43,971 --> 01:15:44,611
[SPEAKER_17]: President morale.

917
01:15:44,631 --> 01:15:47,673
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello for the question, but I can certainly ask.

918
01:15:47,733 --> 01:15:54,458
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe it's to be posted and on the comment by Councilor Knight with regard to this position and the

919
01:15:57,417 --> 01:16:01,161
[SPEAKER_17]: audacious I'll say claims that if you're friends with the mayor.

920
01:16:02,042 --> 01:16:09,129
[SPEAKER_17]: I vehemently disagree with that statement it's accountability that's being done here in terms of responsibilities and employees.

921
01:16:09,469 --> 01:16:18,138
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a select few people and the mayor spoke to those issues back in June when she was before this council as to her expectations on accountability and taxpayer dollars.

922
01:16:18,778 --> 01:16:24,482
[SPEAKER_17]: and the work that's being done has nothing to do with the vast majority of employees who are doing a tremendous job.

923
01:16:24,522 --> 01:16:26,743
[SPEAKER_17]: We're in labor negotiations with the labor unions.

924
01:16:27,103 --> 01:16:31,586
[SPEAKER_17]: We're coming to the table on a regular basis and negotiating in good faith.

925
01:16:33,127 --> 01:16:41,832
[SPEAKER_17]: Certain members of the city council are painting a picture that's completely inaccurate and false, but I won't sit here and go one for one on each item.

926
01:16:42,252 --> 01:16:45,794
[SPEAKER_17]: Happy to identify once the position is posted.

927
01:16:46,374 --> 01:16:47,455
[SPEAKER_17]: As a final note on this,

928
01:16:49,154 --> 01:16:55,319
[SPEAKER_17]: this position in particular, or this paper in particular, was presented to the council some time ago.

929
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:05,788
[SPEAKER_17]: And as you know, the council, section 21, by one motion of a city councilor, and as a result, that November 15th date would now have to move.

930
01:17:06,289 --> 01:17:14,876
[SPEAKER_17]: It is now being presented again two weeks later because the city council had no choice based on one member's motion to section 21 this.

931
01:17:15,497 --> 01:17:15,817
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

932
01:17:17,096 --> 01:17:26,389
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam President, just to clear the record, I just want to make sure that she's aware I was the counsel to section 21 that all right, I'm not afraid to say that I did it.

933
01:17:26,910 --> 01:17:27,351
[SPEAKER_16]: And I did it.

934
01:17:28,011 --> 01:17:29,774
[SPEAKER_16]: And I did it on behalf of.

935
01:17:30,804 --> 01:17:33,986
[SPEAKER_16]: the fiscal responsibility that I have here in this community, all right?

936
01:17:34,346 --> 01:17:39,548
[SPEAKER_16]: So when we sit here and we look at what's going on, and we look at the narrative, and we look at the actual realities, all right?

937
01:17:39,808 --> 01:17:43,770
[SPEAKER_16]: Enough with the lies, the spin, you know, the puppeting.

938
01:17:44,471 --> 01:17:45,831
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not getting sold anymore.

939
01:17:45,971 --> 01:17:46,412
[SPEAKER_16]: It's over.

940
01:17:46,792 --> 01:17:47,472
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it's over.

941
01:17:47,552 --> 01:17:48,593
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not buying it anymore.

942
01:17:48,613 --> 01:17:49,333
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what I mean?

943
01:17:49,553 --> 01:17:51,774
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just the fact of the matter, all right?

944
01:17:51,794 --> 01:17:52,475
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what I mean?

945
01:17:52,495 --> 01:17:53,575
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just the fact of the matter.

946
01:17:53,915 --> 01:17:58,678
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not buying the story anymore, because the narrative never lines up with the fact patterns.

947
01:17:59,538 --> 01:18:01,620
[SPEAKER_16]: The narrative never lines up with the fact that.

948
01:18:02,601 --> 01:18:05,744
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, so we could sit here all week and we could say, well, that's not true.

949
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:06,264
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not true.

950
01:18:06,284 --> 01:18:10,108
[SPEAKER_16]: The man came up here and she said someone said that there was a rumor that someone was doing this.

951
01:18:10,148 --> 01:18:14,893
[SPEAKER_16]: So she spent 60 grand on a private investigator instead of calling the employee in saying, hey, there's a rumor.

952
01:18:15,113 --> 01:18:16,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a reminder, Councilor Caraviello has the floor.

953
01:18:17,015 --> 01:18:17,515
[SPEAKER_16]: Rick, do you mind?

954
01:18:18,236 --> 01:18:19,016
[SPEAKER_16]: I yield my time.

955
01:18:19,036 --> 01:18:19,337
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

956
01:18:20,257 --> 01:18:22,118
[SPEAKER_16]: So, at the end of the day, let's be clear.

957
01:18:22,138 --> 01:18:30,462
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, this is coming from the person who, when we had four members of the DPW report that they've been exposed to COVID, she drove to their house and said, they better not be lying and they better come to work at Snowplow.

958
01:18:31,082 --> 01:18:31,623
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what I mean?

959
01:18:31,903 --> 01:18:34,424
[SPEAKER_16]: So, what's good for the goose is good for the gander.

960
01:18:34,844 --> 01:18:37,245
[SPEAKER_16]: Quite frankly, there's a haphazard application of policy.

961
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:39,727
[SPEAKER_16]: A haphazard application of policy.

962
01:18:40,287 --> 01:18:40,507
[SPEAKER_16]: All right?

963
01:18:40,887 --> 01:18:42,508
[SPEAKER_16]: What's good for the goose is not good for the gander.

964
01:18:42,708 --> 01:18:42,988
[SPEAKER_16]: All right?

965
01:18:43,268 --> 01:18:44,289
[SPEAKER_16]: It depends on who you are.

966
01:18:46,128 --> 01:18:46,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor.

967
01:18:46,848 --> 01:18:47,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead, Madam Chief of Staff.

968
01:18:47,829 --> 01:18:52,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I just encourage you both to please not go one for one on this?

969
01:18:53,753 --> 01:18:54,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

970
01:18:55,494 --> 01:18:55,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

971
01:18:56,655 --> 01:18:58,956
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I apologize.

972
01:18:59,116 --> 01:18:59,997
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm correct.

973
01:19:00,017 --> 01:19:02,278
[SPEAKER_13]: This paper, this hasn't even been posted yet, correct?

974
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:05,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Has this been posted yet?

975
01:19:06,441 --> 01:19:10,283
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam President, through you to Councilor Caraviello, no, the position has not yet been posted.

976
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:17,956
[SPEAKER_17]: As far as I am, I will admit I'm coming back from leave and there are some things I'm still catching up on.

977
01:19:18,116 --> 01:19:19,297
[SPEAKER_17]: I do not believe it's been posted.

978
01:19:19,317 --> 01:19:19,958
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me restate.

979
01:19:23,602 --> 01:19:24,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further discussion from the council?

980
01:19:27,206 --> 01:19:28,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Any members of the public who would like to speak?

981
01:19:32,618 --> 01:19:38,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening Councilors Stephen South 106 Damon Road also Secretary Treasurer of Teamsters local 25.

982
01:19:39,005 --> 01:19:49,677
[SPEAKER_00]: I currently represent eight separate bargaining units that are all working are all have are working without a contract without an active contract.

983
01:19:51,419 --> 01:19:56,465
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier, one of you said that voting for this would not be a slap in the face to the workers.

984
01:19:57,045 --> 01:19:58,587
[SPEAKER_00]: I disagree wholeheartedly.

985
01:20:00,269 --> 01:20:08,237
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, I represent everybody from custodians in the schools all the way up to department heads and assistant department heads.

986
01:20:09,178 --> 01:20:09,958
[SPEAKER_00]: in this building.

987
01:20:11,539 --> 01:20:14,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's had a raise in one year, two years, three years.

988
01:20:15,241 --> 01:20:23,225
[SPEAKER_00]: The clerical employees, including most of the workers in this building, have not had a raise since July 1 of 2019.

989
01:20:23,726 --> 01:20:35,652
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a slap in the face when every single meeting, when I come and sit here or watch online, there's papers coming in for the mayor asking for

990
01:20:37,093 --> 01:20:40,795
[SPEAKER_00]: for certain positions to get raises, individuals.

991
01:20:41,355 --> 01:20:47,919
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I certainly agree with Councilor Knight that this position is already spoken for.

992
01:20:48,099 --> 01:20:49,860
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an upgrade for somebody.

993
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,781
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a nationwide search.

994
01:20:53,322 --> 01:20:55,483
[SPEAKER_00]: So while you see meeting after meeting,

995
01:20:56,303 --> 01:21:01,408
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor putting in papers asking to upgrade individuals, to take care of certain people.

996
01:21:01,928 --> 01:21:10,957
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the hardworking members of Local 25 and other unions, including the teachers, police, fire, many of the other workers.

997
01:21:10,977 --> 01:21:15,080
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of the workers in this city are working without a contract.

998
01:21:15,101 --> 01:21:17,042
[SPEAKER_00]: But yet, meeting after meeting,

999
01:21:17,992 --> 01:21:24,578
[SPEAKER_00]: you see the mayor's staff wanting, the mayor's administration wanting to take care of certain individuals.

1000
01:21:25,158 --> 01:21:34,226
[SPEAKER_00]: I was even called multiple times in the last few months asking if I would agree to sit down and take care of certain individuals in one of our bargaining units.

1001
01:21:34,347 --> 01:21:37,429
[SPEAKER_00]: And my answer is exactly what Councilor Knight said.

1002
01:21:37,770 --> 01:21:38,550
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely not.

1003
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:40,192
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give everybody a raise.

1004
01:21:40,532 --> 01:21:43,254
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's sign a contract for everybody.

1005
01:21:44,035 --> 01:21:47,316
[SPEAKER_00]: and the rising tide does raise all boats.

1006
01:21:47,796 --> 01:21:50,197
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's raise all the boats, not individuals.

1007
01:21:50,718 --> 01:22:00,681
[SPEAKER_00]: So to the councilors, Councilor Tseng Collins and Councilor Bears, who I respect, all three of them, I disagree wholeheartedly.

1008
01:22:00,781 --> 01:22:09,885
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that you have to hold out and let's take care of all the workers of the city that haven't had raises up to

1009
01:22:10,725 --> 01:22:11,626
[SPEAKER_00]: almost four years.

1010
01:22:11,726 --> 01:22:17,110
[SPEAKER_00]: The department heads and assistant department heads in this building haven't had a race in almost 3.5 years.

1011
01:22:17,371 --> 01:22:18,332
[SPEAKER_00]: That's disgraceful.

1012
01:22:18,552 --> 01:22:21,054
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going on in any of the other communities.

1013
01:22:21,374 --> 01:22:27,279
[SPEAKER_00]: I know because I represent and bargain on behalf of all of them, all the surrounding communities.

1014
01:22:27,559 --> 01:22:29,781
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to bring up a couple other things.

1015
01:22:29,881 --> 01:22:34,025
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys forgot that in June and I was in that in that meeting to

1016
01:22:34,705 --> 01:22:37,687
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was a seven or eight hour meeting, the budget meeting.

1017
01:22:38,167 --> 01:22:48,952
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember that, and I commend all of you for fighting hard for your $50,000 legal line item that you all would be represented by council.

1018
01:22:49,652 --> 01:22:52,034
[SPEAKER_00]: I've yet to see that person here to represent you all.

1019
01:22:53,234 --> 01:22:57,796
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember you fought hard for the assistant city solicitor, which is vacant.

1020
01:22:57,876 --> 01:23:02,359
[SPEAKER_00]: And since then we actually lost the chief solicitor.

1021
01:23:03,099 --> 01:23:07,742
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of things that, financially, the city's still waiting for.

1022
01:23:08,502 --> 01:23:22,471
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think to take care of a certain individual, or one or two individuals, based on the papers presented here tonight, is very disrespectful to the upwards of 1,000 people that are working without a contract in this city.

1023
01:23:22,811 --> 01:23:25,553
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, I wanna touch on one last thing.

1024
01:23:25,633 --> 01:23:29,896
[SPEAKER_00]: The info that we've all requested, including the council,

1025
01:23:30,336 --> 01:23:52,153
[SPEAKER_00]: including local 25 and me as a private citizen, regarding the legal bills, unredacted legal bills for the city of Medford, which we've filed complaints with the Secretary of State on because, and I provided you all with the 100% redacted legal bills, which speaking with previous city solicitors in this,

1026
01:23:52,954 --> 01:23:56,916
[SPEAKER_00]: City, that is not privileged information, legal bills.

1027
01:23:57,136 --> 01:24:06,240
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very common that citizens and organizations request them and provided them in Medford and in other communities.

1028
01:24:07,381 --> 01:24:09,702
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're all still waiting for those to see where

1029
01:24:11,062 --> 01:24:12,444
[SPEAKER_00]: our taxpayer money is going.

1030
01:24:12,524 --> 01:24:22,972
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I would request all of you to vote no on this and to show respect for all of the workers in the city of Medford and also for the taxpayers.

1031
01:24:23,352 --> 01:24:30,598
[SPEAKER_00]: And until we can give everybody a raise, we should not allow the mayor to cherry pick certain individuals to take care of.

1032
01:24:30,898 --> 01:24:34,621
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thank you all for your kind attention and your hard work for the city of Medford.

1033
01:24:35,081 --> 01:24:35,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1034
01:24:37,542 --> 01:24:38,222
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madam President.

1035
01:24:38,702 --> 01:24:39,923
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. South, if I may.

1036
01:24:40,023 --> 01:24:41,003
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1037
01:24:43,164 --> 01:24:43,584
[SPEAKER_12]: I hear you.

1038
01:24:44,824 --> 01:24:54,867
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think you would note that this council, you say the many, many papers that have come to us, cherry picking, asking for cap changes and position changes and all of that, that have come before this council from the mayor's office.

1039
01:24:55,627 --> 01:24:59,168
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd have to double check the record, but I believe we've turned them all down.

1040
01:25:01,133 --> 01:25:09,080
[SPEAKER_12]: All of them that have come before us, because I think in, basically, we agree with you on the principle of what's going on in the city, and then it's not right.

1041
01:25:11,102 --> 01:25:21,011
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, I believe also the only calf changes we have approved this year are calf changes that were based on collective bargaining agreements you know we have one tonight from the library union.

1042
01:25:22,152 --> 01:25:22,852
[SPEAKER_12]: We approved one.

1043
01:25:24,178 --> 01:25:25,739
[SPEAKER_12]: few weeks ago as well.

1044
01:25:27,521 --> 01:25:27,761
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

1045
01:25:28,141 --> 01:25:33,505
[SPEAKER_12]: And I guess all I'm saying is, you know, I hear you that you don't that what's going on is wrong.

1046
01:25:33,525 --> 01:25:39,770
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think we've all said about a million times that we agree with you that what's going on is wrong and that these contracts should be negotiated and a fair agreement should be reached.

1047
01:25:41,391 --> 01:25:43,072
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess my question is just

1048
01:25:44,010 --> 01:25:55,117
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, my understanding this position is, we are basically being able by doing this to create two positions where one position currently exists to add to the workforce to increase our capacity for planning.

1049
01:25:56,518 --> 01:26:07,566
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that is your position that something, and you're saying I guess what your position is, you can clarify I don't want to mischaracterize you at all, is that this is someone is getting a raise because the mayor likes them.

1050
01:26:08,633 --> 01:26:14,776
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm saying is there's vacancies all over the city, including a vacancy in this office.

1051
01:26:16,037 --> 01:26:25,882
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think that this isn't already earmarked for somebody, then I would assume that all of you have seen how the city has done business in the last few years.

1052
01:26:26,463 --> 01:26:28,064
[SPEAKER_00]: Something's posted, it's an upgrade.

1053
01:26:28,104 --> 01:26:30,065
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't for somebody off the street.

1054
01:26:31,138 --> 01:26:33,241
[SPEAKER_00]: This is to upgrade somebody already here.

1055
01:26:33,462 --> 01:26:34,984
[SPEAKER_00]: There's already a vacant position.

1056
01:26:35,244 --> 01:26:37,988
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was to be filled, why isn't it filled already?

1057
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:39,290
[SPEAKER_00]: And again,

1058
01:26:40,888 --> 01:26:53,651
[SPEAKER_00]: All the other employees in this building, the clerical people that you all walk by every day when you're in this building, many of them are watching this right now, watching this live, they haven't had a raise in almost four years.

1059
01:26:53,731 --> 01:26:55,131
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be four years, January 1.

1060
01:26:55,691 --> 01:27:02,193
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would we take care of one, and I say we, meaning the taxpayers, why would we take care of one person

1061
01:27:03,086 --> 01:27:04,946
[SPEAKER_00]: when everyone's waiting for a race.

1062
01:27:05,006 --> 01:27:09,487
[SPEAKER_00]: The department heads and assistant department heads haven't had a race in almost three and a half years.

1063
01:27:09,547 --> 01:27:11,188
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's get everybody a race first.

1064
01:27:11,228 --> 01:27:20,070
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's prioritize the masses rather than these one-off upgrades for people that are looking to be taken care of.

1065
01:27:20,230 --> 01:27:24,531
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that is the message that I'm sending to the council.

1066
01:27:25,051 --> 01:27:30,532
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, again, when this room is packed, you hear it from a lot of people right now.

1067
01:27:31,594 --> 01:27:36,337
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to be empty besides me, but it's.

1068
01:27:37,417 --> 01:27:38,318
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1069
01:27:38,498 --> 01:27:41,640
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big issue, and I think it needs to be addressed.

1070
01:27:43,021 --> 01:27:51,465
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that there are so many vacancies, we've talked about it for several months, is there are no contracts, there are no raises.

1071
01:27:52,006 --> 01:27:57,349
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at open jobs on the Medford website or posted on a board somewhere,

1072
01:27:58,537 --> 01:28:01,561
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know that the people haven't had a raise in four years.

1073
01:28:02,121 --> 01:28:03,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you gonna go there?

1074
01:28:03,042 --> 01:28:10,551
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you gonna go to Malden or one of the communities where they have active contracts, where they get raises every single year?

1075
01:28:10,891 --> 01:28:11,632
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you gonna go?

1076
01:28:11,732 --> 01:28:13,514
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, come on, it's common sense.

1077
01:28:13,554 --> 01:28:14,375
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm right there with you.

1078
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:15,637
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we just voted down a raise.

1079
01:28:16,057 --> 01:28:17,058
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, I get it.

1080
01:28:17,498 --> 01:28:21,700
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm asking you guys to vote down this race until everybody gets a race.

1081
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:26,562
[SPEAKER_00]: Every, every, every employee in this city should be getting raises every year.

1082
01:28:26,882 --> 01:28:27,042
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

1083
01:28:27,182 --> 01:28:32,385
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just saying my understanding of this paper is that this is not a race for a position, it's a way to fill a vacant position.

1084
01:28:33,045 --> 01:28:38,388
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, we can agree to disagree on on the facts on what you say about

1085
01:28:39,456 --> 01:28:53,741
[SPEAKER_12]: Whether or not this is respectful or disrespectful, but I want to be very clear, because I hear from workers all the time in the clerical union and every unit in this building who are equally frustrated on the school side, all the units that are out there were real frustrated with the labor relations in this community.

1086
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:58,201
[SPEAKER_12]: And I stand with them, and this council has been steadfast in standing with them.

1087
01:28:58,421 --> 01:29:07,244
[SPEAKER_12]: And if someone came in and this was presented as, we want to give a raise to someone in this department because we think they deserve a raise, it wouldn't be going anywhere.

1088
01:29:07,965 --> 01:29:09,305
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not what was presented to us.

1089
01:29:09,345 --> 01:29:16,868
[SPEAKER_12]: The person came here, the department head came here and said, if we do this, we can have two positions instead of one position in an essential office.

1090
01:29:17,762 --> 01:29:18,642
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's how I see it.

1091
01:29:18,903 --> 01:29:23,385
[SPEAKER_12]: I respect your position, but you could have 500 people in the room, or one person in the room.

1092
01:29:24,285 --> 01:29:26,526
[SPEAKER_12]: The facts to me wouldn't change my opinion on it.

1093
01:29:27,347 --> 01:29:34,190
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that Councilor bears and respectfully if I can make one last comment we earlier about an hour ago a little more.

1094
01:29:34,210 --> 01:29:34,250
[SPEAKER_00]: We.

1095
01:29:36,567 --> 01:29:53,712
[SPEAKER_00]: took a picture with supporting RAs at Tufts who aren't even employees of the city of Medford, but yet we have employees that work right here in this building that have to get state assistance because they haven't had a raise in so many years, they can't pay their bills.

1096
01:29:53,772 --> 01:29:55,172
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll leave you all with that.

1097
01:29:55,472 --> 01:29:56,853
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect all your opinions.

1098
01:29:57,413 --> 01:30:05,915
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard mine and obviously this is the democratic process and you all get the vote and I appreciate what you guys do week in and week out and thank you.

1099
01:30:06,155 --> 01:30:06,635
[SPEAKER_00]: No, thank you.

1100
01:30:06,675 --> 01:30:07,496
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate that.

1101
01:30:07,556 --> 01:30:17,221
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I could just finish, I want to remind everyone of rule 15 on all debatable matters members shall speak no more than three times or more than 15 minutes on the same issue.

1102
01:30:17,261 --> 01:30:19,342
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're number three continue.

1103
01:30:19,542 --> 01:30:19,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

1104
01:30:20,502 --> 01:30:28,046
[SPEAKER_12]: Just to say that, you know, that's why we've been working hard on minimum wage ordinance for all city and school employees sick leave bank.

1105
01:30:28,106 --> 01:30:29,487
[SPEAKER_12]: We're having a meeting tomorrow.

1106
01:30:29,547 --> 01:30:32,829
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm trying to bring paid family medical leave to every worker in this community.

1107
01:30:32,849 --> 01:30:34,810
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we've been

1108
01:30:35,512 --> 01:30:37,753
[SPEAKER_12]: working really hard on supporting the workers in this community.

1109
01:30:37,773 --> 01:30:43,356
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've been standing strong for one, two, three years on the fact of all the labor disputes that are going on.

1110
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:48,078
[SPEAKER_12]: So basically all I'm saying is we seem to have an honest disagreement on the substance of this paper.

1111
01:30:48,478 --> 01:31:02,224
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't want you or anyone else to think that that means that we are in any way changing our position because we've been consistent and strong that we believe that the way that the administration is approaching labor relations is not acceptable.

1112
01:31:02,424 --> 01:31:02,704
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1113
01:31:05,101 --> 01:31:06,062
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Morell.

1114
01:31:06,282 --> 01:31:10,386
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, I appreciate all the perspectives being shared on this.

1115
01:31:10,446 --> 01:31:11,547
[SPEAKER_14]: I really appreciate this discussion.

1116
01:31:11,567 --> 01:31:14,910
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's an important one for the public to hear.

1117
01:31:16,111 --> 01:31:32,245
[SPEAKER_14]: To me, kind of in summation, I believe that this council has been doing the work of seeking to change the financial conditions of the city to get us to an environment where all city employees

1118
01:31:32,954 --> 01:31:39,680
[SPEAKER_14]: can count on getting raises, can count on being fairly compensated, can count on getting wage increases every year.

1119
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:45,664
[SPEAKER_14]: That is very obviously has been well documented and talked about at great length.

1120
01:31:46,085 --> 01:31:46,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Not the case.

1121
01:31:46,605 --> 01:31:48,707
[SPEAKER_14]: It has not been the case for a long time.

1122
01:31:49,390 --> 01:31:50,791
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it is truly astonishing.

1123
01:31:50,851 --> 01:31:58,997
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that all of the city employees who have chosen to remain public servants in light of that is, it's truly astonishing.

1124
01:31:59,057 --> 01:32:14,909
[SPEAKER_14]: It's heroic, including many people, I'd say probably in the departments that we've talked about tonight, that they remain committed to this work to serve this community, even as they are going under compensated and without having a light at the end of the tunnel for when that condition is going to change.

1125
01:32:16,992 --> 01:32:29,417
[SPEAKER_14]: At the same time, this body has been doing the work of trying to change the financial conditions so we can get to a place where all workers can be fairly compensated, can count on fair raises every year.

1126
01:32:29,677 --> 01:32:33,279
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish that we were seeing more of that type of leadership from the executive office.

1127
01:32:33,699 --> 01:32:35,720
[SPEAKER_14]: In my opinion, we have not been.

1128
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:42,423
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been doing what we can in our limited jurisdiction to create the conditions for development, to create the

1129
01:32:43,183 --> 01:32:50,229
[SPEAKER_14]: space and capacity and funding for people who will help us do that development, because at the end of the day, we allocate the resources that we have.

1130
01:32:51,229 --> 01:32:56,954
[SPEAKER_14]: We have been trying to do the work to create more resources to give the people who take care of this community what they deserve.

1131
01:32:58,995 --> 01:33:03,779
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think that this is a worker versus worker issue.

1132
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:12,786
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope that the people of Medford, especially those who work for our city, and in many cases, in spite of how the city treats them,

1133
01:33:13,509 --> 01:33:19,430
[SPEAKER_14]: know that this council stands with them and wants to fight for them.

1134
01:33:19,450 --> 01:33:30,632
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that this particular position is in service of our work to try to better the conditions of the city so that conditions can be better for everybody who works for the city.

1135
01:33:31,193 --> 01:33:32,333
[SPEAKER_14]: And with that, I'll motion for approval.

1136
01:33:33,293 --> 01:33:34,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1137
01:33:35,313 --> 01:33:36,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further discussion from the council?

1138
01:33:36,614 --> 01:33:41,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further motion?

1139
01:33:42,175 --> 01:33:42,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Chief of Staff Ms.

1140
01:33:42,835 --> 01:33:43,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Aaron.

1141
01:33:46,308 --> 01:33:47,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Morell.

1142
01:33:47,469 --> 01:33:53,291
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel I must address the number of different issues that have been brought up, but I promise I won't go tit for tat.

1143
01:33:53,872 --> 01:33:55,853
[SPEAKER_17]: I just ask for the same respect that was given to others.

1144
01:33:56,893 --> 01:34:04,297
[SPEAKER_17]: Many of, if not all the characterizations that on the work of the mayor or the intent of the mayor that have been made this evening are false, simply false.

1145
01:34:06,538 --> 01:34:12,741
[SPEAKER_17]: As far as the city solicitors concerned, Councilor Knight, the city solicitor was informed of all matters that went before

1146
01:34:13,837 --> 01:34:16,138
[SPEAKER_17]: the consulting firm that we've been using.

1147
01:34:16,698 --> 01:34:18,299
[SPEAKER_17]: So that was an earlier comment that you made.

1148
01:34:19,019 --> 01:34:27,302
[SPEAKER_17]: As far as negotiations, Madam President, I don't believe.

1149
01:34:27,542 --> 01:34:29,743
[SPEAKER_08]: I promise to be brief.

1150
01:34:29,803 --> 01:34:30,484
[SPEAKER_17]: I was, thank you.

1151
01:34:30,504 --> 01:34:31,684
[SPEAKER_17]: I promise to be brief.

1152
01:34:32,925 --> 01:34:34,085
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll be no more than two minutes.

1153
01:34:37,206 --> 01:34:37,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Please continue.

1154
01:34:38,387 --> 01:34:38,667
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1155
01:34:39,733 --> 01:34:43,434
[SPEAKER_17]: As far as the clerical union is concerned, that was raised a couple of times this evening.

1156
01:34:43,834 --> 01:34:56,936
[SPEAKER_17]: That unit has changed representation a couple of times, and that change in representation has taken time to occur because there's a formal legal process that it must go through, and it is completely out of the control of the city.

1157
01:34:57,076 --> 01:35:00,597
[SPEAKER_17]: So that has added to the time in which that unit has not had a contract.

1158
01:35:01,537 --> 01:35:07,518
[SPEAKER_17]: We have successfully negotiated traffic supervisor's contract and a library unit contract.

1159
01:35:09,632 --> 01:35:21,875
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Caraviello on your point with regard to economic development, the mayor brought in for the first ever an economic development director and that economic development directors have been hard at work for the last two plus years.

1160
01:35:22,256 --> 01:35:30,078
[SPEAKER_17]: And to your point, yes, if a project would start tomorrow, it wouldn't be see the fruits of the labor for three years, which is why we're starting to see those groups.

1161
01:35:39,347 --> 01:35:40,768
[SPEAKER_16]: The campaign starts in January.

1162
01:35:45,890 --> 01:35:54,334
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just attempting to inform the public of the issues that pertain to false statements that are being made on the city council floor.

1163
01:35:56,235 --> 01:35:57,655
[SPEAKER_08]: If we could keep comments to this paper.

1164
01:35:59,456 --> 01:36:01,317
[SPEAKER_17]: My last comment is pertaining to this paper.

1165
01:36:09,273 --> 01:36:10,053
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President.

1166
01:36:11,394 --> 01:36:27,222
[SPEAKER_17]: The director of planning development and sustainability stood before this council two weeks ago, and noted that there is somebody in her office that would potentially be interested in applying, if this position was posted, and I believe it was made clear at that time by the director that

1167
01:36:28,529 --> 01:36:31,450
[SPEAKER_17]: That person would be a candidate like any other position.

1168
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:34,390
[SPEAKER_17]: The position would be posted and that candidate would be a position.

1169
01:36:34,710 --> 01:36:38,111
[SPEAKER_17]: The city always hires the best candidate for every position.

1170
01:36:38,231 --> 01:36:46,753
[SPEAKER_17]: And there have been promotions from inside different units to different positions out to other locations inside the city.

1171
01:36:46,773 --> 01:36:51,434
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanna push those points forward because I think they're very relevant.

1172
01:36:51,654 --> 01:36:52,034
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1173
01:36:53,295 --> 01:36:54,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam Chair and staff.

1174
01:36:54,695 --> 01:36:55,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I have a motion?

1175
01:36:56,175 --> 01:37:04,839
[SPEAKER_12]: have a motion to approve that's been seconded, I just truly don't understand why we start saying things like we were in a decent place, and now we're in a worse on the motion.

1176
01:37:04,859 --> 01:37:05,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Councilor Collins.

1177
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:11,381
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion to approve from Councilor Collins seconded by Councilor Tseng Council prevail.

1178
01:37:11,841 --> 01:37:12,642
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

1179
01:37:13,762 --> 01:37:16,883
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, the Chief of State just made Council a nice point.

1180
01:37:18,364 --> 01:37:19,565
[SPEAKER_13]: Make it as you make a nice point.

1181
01:37:21,448 --> 01:37:22,408
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1182
01:37:22,608 --> 01:37:24,549
[SPEAKER_08]: That information was presented to us three weeks ago.

1183
01:37:24,569 --> 01:37:26,009
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not, it's not hidden information.

1184
01:37:26,029 --> 01:37:27,649
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't presented to the council three weeks ago.

1185
01:37:27,709 --> 01:37:38,011
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't get, you know, as much as I want to support this thing, I just can't, you know, I just can't support it until we start getting answers and figure out where we are as a community.

1186
01:37:39,151 --> 01:37:42,092
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I said, they already have the kids.

1187
01:37:43,472 --> 01:37:47,433
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng to approve.

1188
01:37:47,633 --> 01:37:48,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1189
01:37:52,922 --> 01:37:53,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Bears.

1190
01:37:53,902 --> 01:37:55,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, under protest.

1191
01:37:57,564 --> 01:37:58,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello.

1192
01:38:00,726 --> 01:38:01,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Collins.

1193
01:38:01,606 --> 01:38:01,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1194
01:38:03,127 --> 01:38:03,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

1195
01:38:04,067 --> 01:38:04,387
No.

1196
01:38:05,828 --> 01:38:06,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scripp-Kelly.

1197
01:38:06,729 --> 01:38:06,929
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1198
01:38:07,989 --> 01:38:08,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Tseng.

1199
01:38:08,609 --> 01:38:08,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1200
01:38:09,830 --> 01:38:10,350
[SPEAKER_06]: President Morell.

1201
01:38:10,670 --> 01:38:10,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1202
01:38:11,531 --> 01:38:13,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Four in the affirmative, three in the negative, the motion passes.

1203
01:38:15,273 --> 01:38:17,474
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam President, motion to take papers 22-502 and 22-562 off the table.

1204
01:38:20,343 --> 01:38:28,213
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of vice-president Barrett to take 22 dash, motion of vice-president Barrett to take papers, can you repeat those numbers?

1205
01:38:28,233 --> 01:38:28,654
[SPEAKER_12]: 22-502 and 22-562.

1206
01:38:28,674 --> 01:38:28,914
[SPEAKER_12]: 52 and 22-562.

1207
01:38:28,954 --> 01:38:29,735
[SPEAKER_12]: For third reading.

1208
01:38:29,755 --> 01:38:30,256
[SPEAKER_12]: For third reading.

1209
01:38:37,328 --> 01:38:38,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1210
01:38:38,269 --> 01:38:38,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, this is a

1211
01:39:02,585 --> 01:39:04,926
[SPEAKER_12]: CAF proposal associated with the previous paper.

1212
01:39:05,506 --> 01:39:09,987
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I think this is on balance a good thing for the community to have additional planning staff.

1213
01:39:11,087 --> 01:39:19,310
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if I can further disassociate my position with the words that were just said by the chief of staff.

1214
01:39:19,330 --> 01:39:21,290
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I don't agree with what they're saying.

1215
01:39:21,310 --> 01:39:23,871
[SPEAKER_12]: I do agree with what Alicia Hunt said three weeks ago.

1216
01:39:24,751 --> 01:39:25,871
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why I support this.

1217
01:39:26,672 --> 01:39:27,872
[SPEAKER_12]: I truly don't understand.

1218
01:39:27,892 --> 01:39:30,373
