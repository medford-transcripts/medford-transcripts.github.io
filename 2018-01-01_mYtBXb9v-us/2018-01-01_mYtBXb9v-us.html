    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=0.487s">Good</a>  morning and welcome to the Marsha Caron Theater here at Medford High School for the inauguration of our Mayor, City Council, and School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=12.035s">An</a>  inauguration is a ceremony that provides us with an opportunity to rededicate ourselves, our leaders, our citizens, to the promotion and achievement of a high quality of life for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=24.816s">In</a>  Medford, we have a firm foundation of quality that can be built upon to meet the challenges and aspirations of the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=32.981s">My</a>  name is Roy Bellson. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=34.963s">I'm</a>  your Master of Ceremonies for this program today. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=39.706s">At</a>  this time, we would ask the Medford Police Honor Guard to present the colors. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=110.707s">At</a>  this time, let's have a warm welcome for Deacon Mark Rumley of St. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=118.313s">Raphael's</a>  Parish, Pastor Bell of the Baptist Church, and Reverend Wendy Olapade of the Sanctuary UCC. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=175.102s">And</a>  now it is my privilege and pleasure to welcome our honored guests. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=196.239s">His</a>  Excellency, the Honorable Charles D.

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=685.677s">As</a>  we stand for the invocation, I ask that we be mindful of the many freedoms that we enjoy as Americans. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=696.64s">freedoms</a>  which have been protected at such great cost by the women and men who have served us in the military. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=704.668s">And</a>  among those freedoms, primary is the freedom of religion, the freedom to worship, so that when we gather together today for the invocation, <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=716.817s">We</a>  will hold in our hearts each one of our distinct faith traditions, and all of our beliefs, all of our personal beliefs, and we are respectful of those personal beliefs, because we are Americans. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=733.46s">And</a>  I am a Catholic, and when I begin to pray, I pray with a sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=740.042s">I</a>  begin in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, amen. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=748.967s">Gentle</a>  and loving God, we thank you for the gift of this day. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=755.329s">As</a>  we begin a new year and undertake the responsibilities of school and government, we ask your guidance, your wisdom, and your assistance so that we can better nurture the bonds of our community, engage in meaningful discussion, <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=779.52s">understand</a>  when change is needed and when change is not, to know when to speak, when to ponder, and when to share. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=793.843s">Allow</a>  us, O Lord, the joy of having the ordinary and unnoticed tasks of each day go well. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=803.664s">And</a>  in those moments of challenge, bring us your wisdom, <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=808.764s">and</a>  your strength. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=811.885s">In</a>  a special way, oh God, remind all those elected officials who take their oaths today of the truth that each one of them is a servant. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=826.347s">For</a>  as Jesus said, if anyone seeks to be first, they must be the very last. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=834.028s">They</a>  must be the servant of all. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=839.375s">Almighty</a>  God, be with us as we serve the city that we love, and keep us mindful that here on earth, your work must be our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=852.561s">In</a>  the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, amen.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=864.006s">Thank</a>  you, Deacon. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=867.942s">Our</a>  opening speaker, please be seated. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=879.031s">Our</a>  opening speaker today has significant and substantial leadership expertise and experience in both the public and private sectors. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=890.2s">He</a>  comes from a family with a rich and distinguished career in public service. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=894.966s">Here</a>  in Medford, we are particularly appreciating his commitment to career and technical education. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=901.928s">This</a>  year, a $500,000 grant for capital skills helped create Bistro 489, which you will all enjoy at the conclusion of these ceremonies. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=918.133s">He</a>  has had a strong support for substance abuse prevention, <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=922.557s">facing</a>  the crisis of opiates in our Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=927.502s">His</a>  actions have helped DCF with staffing and clinical services so needed by the children and families of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=937.933s">His</a>  Washington advocacy for sensible health care legislation provides needed expertise. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=945.948s">His</a>  recent extension of the group insurance discount that supports homeowners and vehicle owners provides relief to all of us on a financial way. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=957.013s">It</a>  is a great pleasure and privilege to introduce His Excellency, the Honorable Charles D. Baker, Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=974.461s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=979.205s">So</a>  let me just start first of all by thanking the superintendent for that sterling introduction. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=986.45s">My</a>  parents, my dad would have liked it, my mom would have believed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=992.014s">Can</a>  I take you with me for the next 12 months or so? <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=997.979s">I'm</a>  really pleased and honored to be here today for a couple of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1002.142s">The</a>  first is, <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1004.268s">I'm</a>  fond of reminding people that Lieutenant Governor Karen Polito and I both started our elected careers in local government. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1011.514s">We</a>  both served on our boards of selectmen, she in Shrewsbury and me in Swampscott. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1016.197s">And</a>  we used to joke about the fact that there's really nothing quite like the accountability that comes with serving the communities you live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1025.405s">Everybody</a>  knows where you live. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1027.923s">Everybody</a>  knows where you buy your coffee and when on the weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1032.307s">They</a>  know what sports your kids play and what fields you're likely to be on. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1037.771s">And</a>  most of the time, when they come to pay you a visit, it's not usually because they're happy about something that you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1047.636s">But</a>  it's a wonderful lesson in true representative government and the beauty that comes from the proximity that exists between local elected and appointed officials and the people who put them there and that they're there to serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1065.049s">And</a>  in the case of <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1067.077s">the</a>  newly reelected mayor here in Medford, I just want to say how much we have enjoyed our opportunity to work collaboratively with her and with the members of your local government. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1080.339s">Superintendent</a>  talked about that $500,000 skills and capital grant for the culinary program here at this technical school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1090.881s">This</a>  wasn't something we cooked up on our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1096.082s">This</a>  whole program in capital skill building, yeah, I know, that was a pretty bad pun. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1103.208s">I</a>  appreciate somebody providing me with that local response right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1107.752s">That</a>  wasn't something that just kind of came to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1113.037s">That</a>  whole notion of creating that capital skills program came because of conversations and dialogue we had had, both during the campaign and afterward, <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1124.486s">with</a>  folks in the vocational and technical community, with local officials, with local school committees, about the fact that we could do some really great things for our communities, for our students, for our faculty, and for our employers, in many cases, who were looking for young adults who had experience on what I would call the latest and greatest technology <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1149.68s">whether</a>  it's in hospitality or culinary arts or robotics or advanced manufacturing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1156.642s">This</a>  came through a dialogue and a conversation with a lot of folks in local government. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1162.483s">We</a>  then pitched the idea to your colleagues in the legislature, and thankfully, they agreed that this was a good idea, and they appropriated about $50 million to be spent over several years on programs just like this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1177.909s">But</a>  whether it's that program or it's the Complete Streets program, which Medford has also participated in, which makes it possible for the state to work with local communities on how to improve infrastructures in downtowns and sidewalks and other local infrastructure, or it's the work we've done on green communities, where again, Medford is a leader here in the Commonwealth, or the simple things we do with respect to our shared assets, <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1206.003s">There's</a>  a lot of state land in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1208.025s">I'm</a>  sure you all know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1210.186s">We</a>  work collaboratively with our colleagues in local government to ensure that we're doing the things that make it possible for people here to benefit from those properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1219.514s">And</a>  we also have property that in some cases we're just not using, which is an asset that really isn't generating a heck of a lot of activity, which in Medford led to a conversation about what we could do with the DOT property <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1234.268s">that</a>  if we could figure out a way to move it would make it possible for Medford to create housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1242.771s">I</a>  may work in state government, but I'm a big believer that a strong Commonwealth is built on the backs and on the work and the sweat of 351 cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1255.294s">And</a>  for us as an administration, part of my presence here today <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1261.295s">is</a>  about sending a message to all of you and to the people who are here on the stage with me that we believe in collaborative government. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1271.446s">We</a>  believe that if we succeed, it will be because of the work we do with our colleagues in local government and with the private sector and with the citizens of Massachusetts to push this state forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1284.657s">And</a>  that's why you're going to see the Lieutenant Governor and myself attending a number of these events over the course of the next couple days. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1290.383s">And</a>  by the way, does municipal government have to have every single inauguration on New Year's Eve, New Year's Day, and the day after? <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1306.118s">At</a>  least she didn't do it in the middle of the Patriots game. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1316.557s">But</a>  I know for many folks here today, this is a very special occasion, but the interesting and the important stuff starts when the clock turns from 17 into 18. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1326.121s">And</a>  I know I speak on behalf of the Lieutenant Governor and our whole team when I say how much we look forward to continuing to work collaboratively and productively with Mayor Burke and with her team here in Medford to continue to make this place the great community that it can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1344.269s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1364.412s">I</a>  would now call upon our City Clerk, Edward Finn, to administer the oath of office to our Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1372.926s">Please</a>  stand.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1784.043s">Thank</a>  you, Roy. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1785.663s">It's</a>  my pleasure and honor to be here with all the local, state, and federal officials that are with us today. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1794.625s">In</a>  1936, my grandfather moved his family from the north end of Boston to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1801.126s">Little</a>  did he know, <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1803.28s">that</a>  he was coming to, he was bringing his family to the eventual fourth hottest city in the country, perilla.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1815.743s">According</a>  to their assessments, Medford has the it factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1821.545s">What</a>  is the it factor? <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1824.067s">The</a>  real estate website goes on to say, once overlooked as a sleepy city northwest of downtown Boston, Medford is now known for its lively dining options, and for recreation opportunities at Rice Pond along the Mystic River, and the annual Mystic River Celebration devoted to the arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1843.978s">The</a>  area is home to the renowned Tufts University, and the T provides easy public transportation access to downtown Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1853.779s">and</a>  residents also enjoy a low tax rate compared to the other cities in our region. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1864.302s">The</a>  it factor is what people outside of Medford have discovered and see the beauty and encompass all the things that I have just mentioned, but are the same things we as Medfordites have taken for granted over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1881.215s">Since</a>  this article, our story continues to get better. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1885.038s">New</a>  management team has taken over Chevalier Auditorium and will be bringing 50 named shows to Medford in 2018, which in turn will help our businesses in and around the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1897.95s">In</a>  addition, the revitalization of the Meadow Glen Shopping Center and the buzz that has created around the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1908.502s">In</a>  this social media driven world, we tend not to always focus on the positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1914.828s">We</a>  debate many issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1917.231s">Old</a>  Medford versus new Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1919.433s">Develop,</a>  don't develop. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1921.214s">What</a>  direction is our city going? <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1923.076s">Somerville</a>  does it better. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1924.397s">Cambridge</a>  does it this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1927.2s">All</a>  the way down to the way we decorate City Hall at Christmas time. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1932.768s">I</a>  ask that we all take a step back, open our eyes, and truly see what a great and remarkable community we live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1940.791s">You</a>  may think the grass is greener on the other side, but if you take the time to water your own grass, it'll be just as green over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1955.356s">Method</a>  is not perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1957.098s">But</a>  together, as your leaders, the mayor, city council and school committee, we can help guide the city to even greater heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1965.461s">Andrew</a>  Carnegie said it best, teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1971.744s">It</a>  is a fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1977.666s">I</a>  know we can come together on behalf of all of those who have sent us here. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1982.819s">In</a>  these days and months ahead, we will be asked to bring judgment on matters both large and small. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1989.805s">The</a>  bottom line is the residents of Medford want results and it's up to us in this room to deliver them. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=1997.032s">Let</a>  us be honored and humbled by our responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2001.116s">Be</a>  innovative and determined in their execution. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2004.979s">Our</a>  role is not to fight the future, but to be the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2009.633s">So,</a>  82 years later, I stand here, a father, a grandfather, who followed in my grandfather's footsteps, choosing to raise my family in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2019.561s">And</a>  hopefully my children and grandchildren will continue to live in Medford and strive to make Medford the number fourth rated city in the country into the number one rated city in the country.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2296.539s">Thank</a>  you, Superintendent Belson, for your lifetime of dedication to the children, to the future of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2306.729s">It</a>  has been your life's work. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2308.511s">Thank</a>  you for everything that you have done for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2315.82s">We</a>  thank the governor for being here today and all of the other dignitaries who have joined us here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2325.808s">And</a>  it is a great honor for me to be here with someone who I admire greatly, the mayor of the city of Medford, Mayor Brooke. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2336.456s">Thank</a>  you so much for inviting me. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2339.038s">to</a>  be here with you today. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2341.019s">You</a>  have done a phenomenal job, and that's why today is such a great day. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2349.002s">When</a>  Lyndon Johnson was asked about being president, he said that when the burdens of the presidency seem unusually heavy, I always remind myself that it could be worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2363.608s">I</a>  could be the mayor of a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2366.049s">Because</a>  no one is more accountable than the mayor and every person here is a part of this effort to make Medford as great as it has become. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2379.552s">Because</a>  being a mayor today is more challenging than it has ever been. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2384.794s">Budgets</a>  are tight, the need for services are high, and then there is Twitter. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2390.595s">That</a>  is a level of accountability which mayors in the past have not had to have dealt with and in just two years She has made it look easy She has done a phenomenal job of moving <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2406.428s">of</a>  Medford on this path of progress, securing funding for a new police station, adding nine new programs at the vocational high school, overseeing Medford's development during the Green Line extension, hiring Medford's first full-time addiction recovery coach to help combat the opioid epidemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2429.212s">Stephanie</a>  Burke is a mayor on a mission. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2433.393s">And</a>  Medford is already <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2435.993s">home</a>  of so many great things, but it can and will become the home of so many more, because she has spent the last two years moving towards that goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2449.459s">Just</a>  look at the Chevalier Theatre. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2451.92s">It</a>  is a great resource that the city has had for many decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2455.982s">And</a>  now, through the efforts of Mayor Burke <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2458.943s">and</a>  the Chevalier Theatre Commission to bring in top management, it is poised to become a prime time venue right here in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2475.39s">Medford</a>  is going to be the place to be with renowned acts like Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons coming here to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2485.195s">Just</a>  this week, President Bush's daughters, Jenna and Barbara, will be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2490.538s">And</a>  Vice President Joe Biden is coming in February. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2494.901s">So,</a>  not a mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2500.423s">She's</a>  like the Ed Sullivan now of mayors in the city and in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2506.568s">And</a>  I know that you are working to improve the quality of every single neighborhood from West Medford to Wellington. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2516.095s">She</a>  has the vision to see what is possible and the political skills to make it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2523.881s">And</a>  we are in <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2525.582s">very</a>  tricky, perilous times for mayors with a tax law that has just been changed and fundamentally is going to alter the way in which state and local taxes are deducted. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2543.375s">And</a>  the impacts on cities and towns could be very profound, which is why it is so great that we have here in <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2553.743s">Medford,</a>  the only mayor in America with a master's degree in taxation and is a certified public accountant. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2564.487s">We</a>  will need you, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2566.988s">We</a>  can loan you out to the other cities and towns over this next <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2572.631s">two</a>  year period. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2574.772s">So</a>  we thank you for everything which you have done because under you, CPA doesn't just stand for Certified Public Accountant, it stands for Commitment to Progress and Action. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2588.016s">And</a>  that is what this city has as her mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2594.128s">So</a>  we thank you for everything that you have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2598.595s">It</a>  is the home of great businesses, of great families, of a great university, a center for scientific <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2609.11s">and</a>  technological change, a place where job growth is amazing, 2.8% unemployment, the lowest unemployment rate in the history of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2623.402s">This</a>  is the place where the mayor has been a leader ensuring that we have all of these incredible opportunities before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2635.092s">Paul</a>  Revere famously made his midnight ride through Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2642.256s">saying</a>  that there was a revolution that was on its way. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2648.038s">And</a>  Mayor Burke is creating her own revolution here in Medford, making her own history in the same way that Paul Revere did. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2658.8s">And</a>  it is all of our honor to be here with you at the swearing in of your second inauguration. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2665.522s">So</a>  if you would, Madam Mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2668.869s">Please</a>  come forward so that I can administer the oath of office to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2673.993s">And</a>  if the mayor's family would please come up onto the stage so that you can join with her in this historic moment.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2737.212s">all</a>  the duties incumbent upon me as the Mayor of the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2745.538s">according</a>  to the best of my ability and understanding, agreeable to the rules and regulations of the Constitution, the laws of this Commonwealth, and the ordinances of the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2752.722s">So</a>  help me God. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2753.222s">Congratulations.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2800.568s">In</a>  two short years, our mayor has made great strides moving Medford forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2807.631s">She</a>  has touched all the bases. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2809.732s">Public</a>  safety, health, education, economic development, arts and culture, preservation of the environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2818.01s">But</a>  perhaps most importantly, she has worked diligently to ensure that Medford is a safe and welcoming environment, a home for all, rejecting hate and discrimination in all its forms and promoting constructive dialogue and community building. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2836.114s">It</a>  is my great pleasure to introduce to you our mayor, Stephanie Muccini-Burke.</p>

href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2867.21s">Welcome</a>  to the Honorable Governor Baker, Senator Markey, all elected officials, clergy, family, and friends here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2876.733s">Congratulations</a>  to the elected officials taking their oath of office this morning, especially to those newly elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2883.576s">May</a>  our oaths be indicative of a common commitment to present our varied viewpoints with civility and willingness to listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2892.579s">That</a>  is the hallmark of democratic discourse. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2896.361s">Two</a>  years ago in this same theater, I began my administration with a call to service by saying, it starts today. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2904.348s">Certainly</a>  within this call was a recognition of past accomplishments, but it was also a reminder to our residents that we are embarking on a fresh start, a new vision, and an invitation to creativity as we work together for the good of our precious Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2922.79s">Much</a>  has been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2923.671s">The</a>  building blocks of a better tomorrow have been put in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2928.916s">We</a>  stand on a firm foundation of open government and a willingness to work cooperatively so that change is made where change is needed, and we can foster a future that is both fluid and deliberate. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2942.888s">It</a>  is a firm foundation centered on planning, such as the master plan for Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2949.17s">This</a>  plan was crafted with the input of many. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2951.35s">It</a>  will showcase and embrace our historic Mystic River and is aimed at enhancing and refreshing our downtown area in many ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2960.913s">including</a>  taking steps to address traffic flow so that High Street, Riverside Ave, and Salem Street no longer become a slingshot to get to the other side, but the center of our city to be repurposed to serve the businesses and the residents of the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2977.357s">The</a>  plan is challenging, but my administration is up to execute this plan and will work in full collaboration with the city council, stakeholders, and developers to create a dynamic mixed-use area. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2991.58s">It</a>  is a firm foundation characterized by prioritized investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2996.122s">We</a>  continue to progress through the City's five-year capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=2999.924s">Working</a>  with the City Council, my administration has systematically invested in the City's infrastructure and equipment needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3006.987s">At</a>  the center of this investment is a new police headquarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3011.329s">The</a>  team has been meeting weekly to develop the layout, space needs, and features for this state-of-the-art facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3017.756s">Their</a>  hard work continues and we are growing closer to having a schematic design and then the demolition. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3024.464s">This</a>  resilient project will be solar ready and meet the high demands of attempting to be carbon neutral. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3031.985s">It</a>  is a firm foundation enhanced by collaboration. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3035.688s">Governor</a>  Baker initiated an office called Open for Business. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3039.031s">With</a>  the assistance of this office, a parcel of state land along Mystic Avenue has been made available for development. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3045.897s">Assistance</a>  of this type will greatly aid the City of Medford to create a Mystic Ave corridor that we can rightly call the gateway to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3055.242s">Consistent</a>  with this effort, the city has received a grant from the Metropolitan Area Planning Council and Mass Housing to assist in drafting a zoning amendment that will take into consideration the current businesses along the corridor and make recommendations to reshape zoning to allow for development that fosters responsible growth and at the same time acknowledges and preserves the residential character of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3081.035s">Of</a>  course, the city council will play a pivotal role in this action, and I look forward to this collaboration. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3088.317s">In</a>  the same way, I have committed, along with the metropolitan mayors and our governor, to embrace housing initiatives and significantly increase the residential housing stock in our city and the metro region. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3100.961s">Medford</a>  is the place to live. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3104.422s">It</a>  is a firm foundation that is based on results. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3108.277s">But</a>  change requires more than words. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3110.678s">It</a>  requires work that bears results. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3113.58s">This</a>  very day, the Chevalier Theater will host its first performance under the stewardship of Bill Blumenreich Presents. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3120.444s">This</a>  is the result of months of collaboration between the administration, the city council, the Chevalier Auditorium Commission, the licensing commission, and our state delegation, and so many others, all working toward the goal of utilizing our beautiful theater <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3136.873s">to</a>  raise the profile of the arts and benefit the life of our downtown businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3142.815s">It</a>  is a firm foundation that is comprehensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3146.237s">I</a>  am very proud of our Complete Streets program, with the assistance of the Governor's Office once again. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3151.579s">They</a>  have been fabulous to the City of Medford, I might say. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3155.179s">We've</a>  put an emphasis on multimodal transportation and it is being implemented as we speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3160.863s">To</a>  date, we have completed four projects from the priority list. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3164.506s">The</a>  most visible are on High Street in West Medford and the Winthrop Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3169.07s">Through</a>  this program, pedestrians and bicycle access has been and will continue to be addressed in every municipal road project in the community and also private projects that come into our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3185.835s">For</a>  this, we say thank you, Governor Baker. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3195.038s">He</a>  claims to be a Republican, but I don't really know for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3208.201s">It</a>  is a firm foundation whose key ingredient is the dedication of its public servants. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3215.717s">Bricks,</a>  mortar, infrastructure and the needs of public safety will always be central municipal concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3223.042s">But</a>  these concerns are addressed by real people. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3226.404s">They</a>  are people who serve day in and day out. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3229.366s">Many</a>  are with us today and I thank you for your dedication, the department heads of the City of Medford and those employees that are here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3235.39s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3246.226s">In</a>  this new year, we will experience the retirement of two key figures in our city government. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3251.91s">Our</a>  esteemed Superintendent of Schools, Roy Belson. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3260.755s">And</a>  our respected Chief of Police, Leo Badisacco. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3269.957s">Both</a>  of these individuals have devoted their entire professional careers to serving the citizens of Medford, and they have both set and met extraordinary high standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3280.362s">They</a>  are leaders of vision and mentors to their department. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3284.284s">To</a>  them, we say with all our heart, thank you so very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3307.387s">I</a>  also want to say a word about our women and men who participate in our senior tax abatement program, led by the Vivian Wright, who's in attendance today. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3322.892s">The</a>  benefit that they derive from this program is much less than the benefit that the various departments receive from their years of experience, their pleasant demeanor, and obvious love of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3337.147s">We</a>  are blessed with their contributions of time and talent. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3340.911s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3349.74s">It</a>  is a foundation so firm that it will not suffer hate or judgment, but will embrace understanding and justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3358.086s">At</a>  the start of my comments today, I said that civility and listening are the cornerstones of democratic discourse. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3364.491s">This</a>  is true for many reasons, but the primary reason is that civility and listening have the effect of erasing fear. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3372.455s">They</a>  erase the fears which feed bigotry and racism. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3376.278s">They</a>  level all playing fields to ensure that inequality and entitlement will not prevail. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3383.65s">Medford</a>  embraces the ideals of equality in so many ways through the big table led by Reverend Wendy, community coalition, the Medford Health Matters conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3394.837s">We</a>  endeavor by action to continually make Medford a better and welcoming community. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3401.942s">And</a>  as I look out, I see advisors, directors, and students from our CCSR program, which stands for Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3420.808s">They</a>  have committed their time and talents to form themselves as global citizens and thus make Medford a place of responsibility, invitation, and inclusivity. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3432.843s">The</a>  students are our future leaders and I could not be prouder of you today. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3437.589s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3456.445s">So</a>  this day, I say again, happy new year. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3459.507s">Let</a>  us begin anew, filled with optimism, hope, and a sense of pride in our community, our city, our Medford, to plan its future and to bring the plan into reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3471.813s">It</a>  starts today. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3473.513s">May</a>  God bless you, your families, and God bless this precious city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3480.977s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3482.018s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3507.025s">At</a>  this time, I would like to recognize the family members of the various elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3515.233s">Will</a>  all the family members who are here today of the Medford School Committee please stand up and be recognized. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3535.45s">I'm</a>  sure they really appreciate your support because I'm going to keep them really busy the next six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3543.451s">And</a>  now I'd like to have the family members of the Medford City Council stand up and be recognized. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3561.995s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3562.815s">I</a>  plan to keep them busy too. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3566.473s">At</a>  this time, I would like to call upon Pastor Gerald Bell of the Shiloh Baptist Church for an invocation.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3575.416s">For</a>  the benediction, let us all stand, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3588.498s">First</a>  Timothy chapter 2 says, I urge then first of all that petitions and prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people, for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3612.198s">This</a>  is good and pleases God, our Savior, who wants all people to be saved, to come to a knowledge of the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3622.492s">Let</a>  us bow our heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3623.934s">Eternal</a>  God, our Heavenly Father, we pray for wisdom. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3628.121s">for</a>  light, and for boundaries to protect our city, to protect our leaders, and to protect our families. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3638.305s">We</a>  pray from the least of these to the greatest. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3641.806s">May</a>  our city be open and welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3644.887s">to</a>  all and any persons who would join our common purpose to serve all of humanity. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3651.468s">We</a>  thank you for the opportunity to serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3654.349s">We</a>  thank you for the mayor, the senator, the governor, all of our elected officials and their families who support them. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3662.091s">Come,</a>  Holy Spirit, come. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3664.451s">Give</a>  us favor in 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3668.132s">We</a>  bless your name and we pray in the mighty matchless name of Jesus. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3674.311s">Amen.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3699.499s">I</a>  want to take this opportunity to thank all of those who've participated in making this day and making this ceremony a meaningful and important event in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3712.651s">I'd</a>  like to start by thanking our band from the high school and our string quartet. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3725.163s">Music</a>  always inspires the soul, and we've got great music in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3729.766s">And</a>  thank you, Anthony, for your work and your dedication as Director of Fine Arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3734.97s">We</a>  also want to thank all the people that donated non-perishable goods for the food pantry in Medford, in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3743.716s">Appreciate</a>  that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3745.057s">There's</a>  so many people out there who absolutely need this. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3748.799s">And</a>  the more we can do in that account, the better off we are in helping our neighbors and friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3754.423s">I</a>  want to thank Wegmans for their support of our collation which will take place at the close of this ceremony at Bistro 489. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3763.596s">You're</a>  all invited to see this great facility funded in great part by our governor. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3767.942s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3773.755s">It's</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3774.135s">It's</a>  a great place. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3775.196s">It's</a>  a great place. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3775.837s">It's</a>  going to be a great place for the community to gather and for our young people to develop culinary arts skills that will give them the opportunity to earn successful jobs in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3786.304s">It's</a>  a terrific opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3787.605s">We</a>  really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3789.186s">I</a>  also want to thank all the volunteers who helped to make today special. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3794.289s">The</a>  mayor's staff, the buildings and ground staff of the public schools, <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3798.65s">Corey</a>  Barrasso, the chef instructor of the Bistro 489, and Chad Fallon, the director of the Vocational Technical School for preparing the collation. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3810.713s">And</a>  to all of you for coming out in the cold and braving it to be part of an important community event. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3818.314s">At</a>  this time, I would ask the police honor guard to retire the colors. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3869.738s">Please</a>  stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3944.107s">You</a>  may be seated. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3952.092s">As</a>  we close today's ceremonies, we leave with renewed commitment and hope and confidence that our community will move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3960.853s">The</a>  first and last task of any leader is to keep hope alive and I think today you know that hope is alive and well in Medford and we are moving forward under the leadership of our mayor, our school committee and city council, as well as our state government, the governor, our congressmen, our <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3980.083s">leaders</a>  in the state legislature and the United States Senate. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3984.628s">We</a>  have terrific people leading us and all we need to do is get with it and support them so that we can continue to make Medford a great place. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=4008.536s">As</a>  we allow our city officials and honored guests to leave, please remain seated so they can leave the hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=4015.32s">And</a>  then afterwards, you're all invited to Bistro 489 on the second floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=4019.622s">We'll</a>  have guides to show you there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=4021.483s">Come</a>  and join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=4022.604s">They've</a>  prepared a wonderful collation for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=4024.925s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>
