Student rep, you're asking us also, Mayor.

00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:47,690

24
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,030

00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:34,208

31
00:01:34,949 --> 00:01:40,054
Motion to sever the public hearing minutes and the behavioral and special ed.

32
00:01:41,796 --> 00:01:46,481
Motion to sever by Member Reinfeldt, seconded by Member Rousseau.

33
00:01:46,602 --> 00:01:47,362
All those in favor?

34
00:01:48,695 --> 00:01:50,356
Motion to sever has been approved.

35
00:01:51,216 --> 00:02:06,461
I'd like to amend the minutes to the Special Education and Behavioral Health Subcommittee to include a link to the meeting recording because I believe that the feedback provided by the representatives from Curtis Tufts should be easily accessible with the record of the votes.

36
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:13,423
Motion to include a link on those meeting minutes by Member Rheinfeld, seconded by?

37
00:02:13,443 --> 00:02:13,563
Second.

38
00:02:15,152 --> 00:02:17,293
Member Ntapa, all those in favor?

39
00:02:17,313 --> 00:02:17,754
Aye.

40
00:02:18,314 --> 00:02:19,115
All those opposed?

41
00:02:20,496 --> 00:02:28,101
And I'd also like to strike from the public hearing minutes the home address of the students who provided public comment for privacy reasons.

42
00:02:29,642 --> 00:02:34,085
Strike the home address from the meeting minutes from May 6th, 2024 public budget hearing.

43
00:02:34,105 --> 00:02:39,589
And just put the- Just put their names that they spoke.

44
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:44,192
I don't think their home address should be on public record for students.

45
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:53,995
Motion to amend the public hearing meeting minutes from May 6, 2024 regarding the budget by Member Reinfeld, is there a second?

54
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:10,641
Member Ntapa, all those in favor?

55
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:10,721
Aye.

56
00:03:11,662 --> 00:03:12,402
All those opposed?

57
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:14,543

58
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:22,091
We have reports of subcommittees, ad hoc, subcommittee on handbook process, May 8th, 2024.

59
00:03:25,994 --> 00:03:30,657
CHCAB, handbook review and schedule, the school committee's report.

60
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:31,878
Member Russo?

61
00:03:32,038 --> 00:03:32,919
Motion to waive the reading.

62
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:36,001
Motion to waive the reading with an explanation.

63
00:03:37,382 --> 00:03:39,563
It's on the agenda and it's quite long.

64
00:03:39,724 --> 00:03:43,066
I'm happy to talk about it too, but if you wanna read it, you're welcome to.

65
00:03:44,508 --> 00:03:46,109
What is the committee, would they like me to read it?

66
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:46,830
Second.

67
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:49,312
To waive the reading.

68
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:55,337
Motion for approval by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Graham.

69
00:03:55,557 --> 00:03:56,438
All those in favor?

70
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,199
Aye.

71
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,600
Okay, meeting is waived.

72
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,101
If you could give a synopsis.

73
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:01,022
Absolutely.

74
00:04:01,422 --> 00:04:06,106
So the, sorry, as I have to take the minutes at the same time, give me just a moment.

75
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:09,569
Here we go.

76
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:12,712
So on,

77
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:14,668
When did we actually meet?

78
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:19,834
We met on May 8th to discuss the process for doing school handbooks.

79
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:24,679
The school committee is required annually by law to approve school handbooks and we have...

80
00:04:26,153 --> 00:04:29,095
done that some years and not done that some or many years.

81
00:04:29,596 --> 00:04:44,048
So we worked up a process, we reviewed, I reviewed, I took some example policy from other districts, notably Cambridge, and worked up a timeline policy that we, the rest of the committee members,

82
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:55,473
fleshed out the synopsis is that there's three phases of the handbook process that we would like to see implemented.

83
00:04:56,033 --> 00:05:01,396
The first phase is the initiation of the handbook update process, which the superintendent's office will manage.

84
00:05:02,696 --> 00:05:08,039
And there's quite a long date range of August 1st to September 30th for them to accomplish that.

85
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:14,803
Then those go over to the site school councils, excuse me, at each of the buildings.

86
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:23,769
And those individual councils, one of their required, well, one of their tasks as a school council is to draft changes to the handbook.

87
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:31,034
And they get a pretty big, October 1st to January 31st is the expected time when they would do that work.

88
00:05:32,094 --> 00:05:37,238
And then finally, this comes back to the school committee for approval sometime between February 1st and April 30th.

89
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:51,611
There's a whole, it's, there's a lot of language, but those are the most important things is that there's dates, and there's expectations and I think that the big improvement here, aside from having dates, the big improvement is that.

90
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:56,473
there's these two memorandums that will accompany these changes.

91
00:05:56,693 --> 00:06:02,114
So the laws change every year, court cases, et cetera.

92
00:06:02,514 --> 00:06:06,795
And so we often have to update our school handbooks because we don't have a choice.

93
00:06:07,675 --> 00:06:15,177
But when the school councils, and I've heard this from school councils, they get to make these changes and they don't have any idea why.

94
00:06:15,697 --> 00:06:22,138
So there'll be a memorandum that goes to them explaining exactly why these are changes that you don't really have a choice on.

95
00:06:23,158 --> 00:06:42,449
And then if the school council wishes to make further changes to the handbooks, things like school pickup at elementary schools, they would also write that up so that when we get the actual handbooks for approval, we're not reading them like just this gigantic set of documents with no idea what changed from last year.

96
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:50,214
So hopefully that will improve the process and make it so that we actually do the approvals because, I mean,

97
00:06:50,594 --> 00:06:58,169
all the school handbooks stacked together is quite a thing, and having no clue what changed year to year is sort of a monumental task.

98
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:01,635
So that's the policy proposal.

99
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:09,773
We didn't have administration in the meeting, and that was on purpose, because we wanted to just focus on what the school committee wanted.

100
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:19,981
So if the dates do not work for the administration or the school councils, we're certainly happy to hear feedback on that, and adjust those dates.

101
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,883
So that is the synopsis.

102
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:29,048
Is there a motion to approve?

103
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:31,770
Or do you want to?

104
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,806
Motion to approve, first reading.

105
00:07:35,326 --> 00:07:37,887
Motion to approve first reading by Member Russo, seconded by?

106
00:07:37,907 --> 00:07:38,468
Second.

107
00:07:39,128 --> 00:07:40,469
Member Ntopper, all those in favor?

108
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:41,069
Aye.

109
00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:42,030
All those opposed?

110
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,111
First reading is passed.

111
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:48,893
We have Behavioral Health and Special Education Subcommittee, then meeting was held.

112
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:50,174
Member Graham.

113
00:07:50,394 --> 00:07:52,115
Can I motion to waive the second reading?

114
00:07:55,156 --> 00:08:00,139
Of the handbook review and schedule, motion to waive the second reading by Member Graham.

115
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,721
Yeah, we would like- Member Reinfeldt?

116
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:08,345
We would like to give the administration and school councils a chance to confirm that this works for them.

117
00:08:08,825 --> 00:08:09,566
Oh, okay, fine.

118
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:10,326
With John.

119
00:08:11,187 --> 00:08:11,527
With John.

120
00:08:11,547 --> 00:08:19,792
Behavioral health and special education subcommittee meeting was held on May 15th, 2024.

121
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:24,455
Recommendation to co-localize Curtis Tufts and the main high school campus.

122
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,497
Would anybody like to give an update on this?

123
00:08:27,597 --> 00:08:28,158
Member Roussell?

124
00:08:28,638 --> 00:08:29,058
Certainly.

125
00:08:31,896 --> 00:08:34,987
So the last school committee meeting was the last one, I believe.

126
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:37,656
Actually, it's in here.

127
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:58,613
On April 29th, not the last school committee meeting, there was a resolution to have the subcommittee discuss the possibility of co-locating the Curtis Tufts with the Medford High School when we are actually reimagining slash rebuilding Medford High.

128
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:03,637
And there were a lot of reasons for that, such as some of the more obvious ones is that

129
00:09:04,532 --> 00:09:11,838
Medford High students not at Curtis-Tufts would be in a beautiful facility, and the Curtis-Tufts, if you've seen it, is not exactly that.

130
00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:26,210
But facilities aside, there were all these opportunities that Curtis-Tufts students cannot actually participate in, or it's very, very difficult to get across town between classes, and club participation is low.

131
00:09:28,592 --> 00:09:42,361
At the last meeting, there was also the director of the program in Somerville, and they used to have a separate program, like Medford does, and they co located when they built a new Somerville High School, and the reviews were amazing.

132
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:46,584
You know, students there, their therapeutic learning program are

133
00:09:47,565 --> 00:09:51,231
You know, captains of sports teams participating in all of the clubs.

134
00:09:51,731 --> 00:09:58,543
So, the, the quality of education experience for those students went very much through the roof.

135
00:09:59,024 --> 00:10:00,146
So we listened to.

136
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:18,815
I believe it was a survey or maybe just gathered information from current students, staff were in the meeting of the Curtis-Tufts, and in my opinion, the unanimous opinion of everyone who participated was that this made sense to make this recommendation.

137
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:24,882
So this is the recommendation of the subcommittee that we co-locate

138
00:10:25,522 --> 00:10:32,748
the Curtis Tufts at some point, probably when we do the high school over with the main campus.

139
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:35,470
Great, thank you for the work.

140
00:10:36,191 --> 00:10:38,233
Motion for approval by Member Rousseau, seconded by?

141
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:38,373
Second.

142
00:10:39,474 --> 00:10:40,975
Member Olopade, all those in favor?

143
00:10:40,995 --> 00:10:41,055
Aye.

144
00:10:42,056 --> 00:10:42,696
All those opposed?

145
00:10:42,997 --> 00:10:45,599
Thank you, we'll send that to the MSPA subcommittee.

146
00:10:47,861 --> 00:10:50,783
Report of Superintendent, Dr. Maurice-Edward Vincent.

147
00:10:50,963 --> 00:10:51,764
Updates and comments.

148
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,069
Thank you.

149
00:11:03,332 --> 00:11:07,175
having several presentations to recognize some of our student accomplishments.

150
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:14,620
But later, after we get through our first additional four reports, we will be presenting the budget update.

151
00:11:15,901 --> 00:11:29,711
During this presentation, we hope that we are able to answer many of the questions that have come in to the district through email or through direct conversations, specifically regarding the arts and

152
00:11:30,932 --> 00:11:34,993
change in programming that is going to be recommended for the arts.

153
00:11:35,753 --> 00:11:53,898
So I am asking all of you who are here this evening to please let us get through the agenda and once we're done with that we'll have a budget update and presentation in time for questions and for us to be able to explain the rationale and

154
00:11:54,818 --> 00:11:58,279
work that went behind the decisions that did have to be made.

155
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:15,326
I can say, just for the purposes of the audience that is here, there have been a lot of questions about no longer having a marching band or anything related to the performing arts, and that is complete misinformation.

156
00:12:15,346 --> 00:12:22,069
The student experience in the Medford Public Schools will be an identical student experience.

157
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:35,899
The one arts related position that was cut was due to a resignation that we received, and that resignation has taken place already.

158
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:45,146
The individual has resigned from the district and is no longer employed with Medford Public Schools, and that was a theater arts position.

159
00:12:45,587 --> 00:12:46,367
So that was a

160
00:12:47,368 --> 00:12:49,768
cut without a face or a name.

161
00:12:50,169 --> 00:13:05,011
So I do want to call that out because there have been many communications about arts programming ending in Medford and I deeply, deeply support the arts and so does the entire Method Public Schools.

162
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:14,053
So I wanted to just put that information out there and try to correct some of the misinformation that was spread.

163
00:13:14,893 --> 00:13:19,116
I do want to recognize today we'll have our CCSR update.

164
00:13:19,736 --> 00:13:32,583
Mr. Trotter will be here with our students and recognize two of our book students, Savannah McLaughlin and Adam Costello, who will talk about their special project that they did this year.

165
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:35,745
We're very excited and happy to hear about you.

166
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:41,649
I want to recognize Dr. Nicole Hughes, our Director of Humanities, who will be recognizing

167
00:13:42,469 --> 00:13:49,393
many of our students that have performed wonderful outstanding achievements over the course of this year.

168
00:13:50,093 --> 00:13:59,779
And then we will have a high school update from Miss Cabral, the principal of the high school, and Mr. Chad Fallon, principal director of the vocational school.

169
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:04,962
And Miss Cabral will be discussing the high school survey results.

170
00:14:05,622 --> 00:14:23,048
And then following those presentations, Mr. Jerry McHugh, our Director of Finance, will be presenting a finance update to provide context and additional background, followed by a vote of the school committee.

171
00:14:23,849 --> 00:14:24,229
Thank you.

172
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,570
Thank you, Dr. Edwardson.

173
00:14:31,812 --> 00:14:32,192
We have

174
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:38,023
Like our superintendent said, next up is CCSR update and student recognition.

175
00:14:38,864 --> 00:14:45,253
Mr. Richard Trotter, director of CCSR, accompanied by Brooks Elementary School students, Savannah McLaughlin and Adam Costello.

176
00:14:45,613 --> 00:14:46,455
Welcome to our meeting.

177
00:14:56,893 --> 00:15:00,556
Okay, I should know that I used to run the media tech department.

178
00:15:01,517 --> 00:15:05,521
My name is Richard Trotter, I'm director of the CCSR, I'm happy to be here.

179
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:13,187
I want to thank the school committee, the mayor and superintendent for supporting the program.

180
00:15:13,207 --> 00:15:16,951
I also want to thank the advisors, you have the list in your report.

181
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:25,201
The executive team of the high school have been very active and supportive of the program, doing a lot of work.

182
00:15:25,781 --> 00:15:33,467
Oprah and Anna Marika, who just got accepted to Harvard University, I think that was in the news.

183
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:38,170
Sophia Suho and Jonah Siegel.

184
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:44,474
Those four students were very instrumental in getting the whole high school programs accomplished in the last two years.

185
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:50,587
And mostly I want to thank the students of the CCSR for all their fine work.

186
00:15:51,588 --> 00:15:55,730
And we also want to thank the benefactors.

187
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:00,792
We have two benefactors that have provided $700,000 in funds for the program.

188
00:16:00,812 --> 00:16:08,055
The Cummings Foundation, Crystal Campbell Community Fund, and Bloomberg Foundation making this possible.

189
00:16:08,536 --> 00:16:13,078
And we're funding through the next six years under the Cummings Foundation grant.

190
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:21,835
As you know, the mission of the program is to develop leaders, social entrepreneurs, who work to make the world a better place.

191
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,615
It's that simple.

192
00:16:23,276 --> 00:16:28,359
And we've had, this year, 400 students, approximately, 70 projects.

193
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:36,324
In my full report, which you have, I think it's 80 pages long, you will find all those projects.

194
00:16:36,644 --> 00:16:40,306
And so we're very proud of the work the students did and advisors did this year.

195
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,965
I just want to mention one more thing before I bring the students up.

196
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:52,529
We have a summer art studio program that's going to be run through from Cummings Foundation funds.

197
00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:59,213
And that will be publicized once we get the schedule set and it will take place in the month of July.

198
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:06,639
And so I look forward to that and we'll be putting out there to the public and hopefully we'll get some good response this year.

199
00:17:10,101 --> 00:17:13,206
I'd like to have Jonas Segal over here just shortly.

200
00:17:13,226 --> 00:17:14,809
I'd like to have Jonas say a few words.

201
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,652
He represents the high school.

202
00:17:16,732 --> 00:17:18,035
He's one of the executive team leaders.

203
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:20,459
And then we're gonna bring up Adam and Savannah.

204
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:21,881
Thank you.

205
00:17:25,828 --> 00:17:31,394
Hello, my name is Jonah Siegel I'm part of the executive team of the CCSR at the high school.

206
00:17:32,795 --> 00:17:49,612
I joined the CCSR as a freshman, and since then I began a project of river cleanups with my friend Maggie, and we've partnered with the Missick River Watershed Association and held many successful cleanups.

207
00:17:50,232 --> 00:17:55,816
and we were the youngest ever winners of a Tufts community grant for our effort.

208
00:17:56,896 --> 00:18:04,701
And I wanted to talk about how CCSR, what I think is really special about it is how it changes your mindset on leadership.

209
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:14,147
I can remember when I was a freshman and I just joined the CCSR, when I looked around and I saw things around me that needed improving, I,

210
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,991
Before I would just walk and continue about my day.

211
00:18:19,452 --> 00:18:23,614
But now I would think about it and I would say, how could I make a CCSR project about this?

212
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:25,094
How could I change this?

213
00:18:25,675 --> 00:18:29,477
And I think that's what's great about the CCSR is it gives you a platform.

214
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:42,443
It gives you a resources, not only financial resources and in terms of mentors, but it also gives you a community that really encourages the mindset of just go out and do it.

215
00:18:42,563 --> 00:18:44,504
Like be the change you wanna see in the world.

216
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:56,882
And I think that's really special for children to develop, which is why I think it's great that we have this program all throughout the district in the elementary schools and the middle schools and the high schools.

217
00:18:57,342 --> 00:19:08,412
And I hope it can continue to expand and be a part of more children's lives, because it's really just a great place for them to learn that they can make a change.

218
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:27,977
By the way, I recognize two former CCR members, Aaron O'Roddick and John N. Topper.

219
00:19:29,037 --> 00:19:29,638
Good morning, guys.

220
00:19:29,658 --> 00:19:40,224
Now I'll introduce the two students from the Brook School who did the excellent report, a project on the postal safety, and they are Savannah and Adam.

221
00:19:40,425 --> 00:19:40,765
Come on up.

222
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:50,784
Hello.

223
00:19:52,353 --> 00:19:53,400
I'm going to read the letter.

224
00:19:58,193 --> 00:20:01,955
My name is Savannah McLaughlin, along with my classmate Adam Costello.

225
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:06,558
We are fifth grade students from the Brooks Elementary School on High Street.

226
00:20:07,258 --> 00:20:12,361
We both learned about the terrible attack of one of your co-workers this past Halloween.

227
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:15,262
I live in the neighborhood where the assault took place.

228
00:20:15,623 --> 00:20:21,566
I saw all the news trucks and reporters at the end of my street while my friends and me were trick-or-treating.

229
00:20:22,326 --> 00:20:28,829
I didn't know why they were there, but I remember being excited to have a chance to be seen on TV.

230
00:20:29,749 --> 00:20:32,330
It wasn't until the next day I read what happened.

231
00:20:32,951 --> 00:20:38,693
Adam heard the news by overhearing some students talking about it in school.

232
00:20:38,973 --> 00:20:45,096
We both felt so sad for the victim and so angry about the cowardly attackers.

233
00:20:45,476 --> 00:20:47,497
They had no way to put a finger on him.

234
00:20:48,017 --> 00:20:49,978
Male carriers are very important.

235
00:20:50,658 --> 00:20:54,642
and deserve to be treated with the highest degree of respect.

236
00:20:55,002 --> 00:20:57,705
He was just doing his job delivering our mail.

237
00:20:58,606 --> 00:21:03,030
We've been told there has been a rise of attacks on postal workers.

238
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,932
We want this to stop.

239
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:07,314
Luckily, the members of our schools

240
00:21:08,575 --> 00:21:13,136
Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

241
00:21:13,456 --> 00:21:22,439
It is a district-wide after-school program that's dedicated to making the community and the world a better place to live.

242
00:21:22,939 --> 00:21:26,440
Each year, students are asked to think of a project that will help

243
00:21:28,889 --> 00:21:35,815
make a positive impact, we decided on track, and we'll help my friends weather carriers to feel safe.

244
00:21:36,635 --> 00:21:45,343
We were first thinking of supplying you with pepper spray or tasers, but after some teacher guidance, we thought it was best to build safety vessels.

245
00:21:45,823 --> 00:21:49,867
First, we co-hosted a school fundraiser at the Brooks to raise enough money.

246
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:53,748
to provide all seven of you a neon orange whistle.

247
00:21:54,048 --> 00:22:01,370
The emergency whistles have an adjustable reflective ring and can emit high and low frequency sounds.

248
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:04,850
If you ever feel unsafe on the job, roll on this whistle.

249
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:08,751
Hopefully, help will come quickly or the danger will leave quickly.

250
00:22:08,771 --> 00:22:12,972
We hope you find this gift useful.

251
00:22:13,392 --> 00:22:15,933
Please always know we appreciate and care about you.

252
00:22:16,353 --> 00:22:17,773
Thank you for serving MET through.

253
00:22:18,174 --> 00:22:19,954
Sincerely, Adam and Savannah.

254
00:22:34,849 --> 00:22:35,649
Amazing job.

255
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:37,952
And you're a great presenter too.

256
00:22:38,552 --> 00:22:40,174
Thank you.

257
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:40,374
Ms.

258
00:22:40,394 --> 00:22:41,355
Bramley and then Ms.

259
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:41,956
Schoentopper.

260
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:49,899
I just want to thank everybody that is part of the CCSR it is a huge, a huge undertaking.

261
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:52,041
And I think it's a huge.

262
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,100
Amazing.

263
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,161
It's really amazing that this was happening in our city.

264
00:22:57,362 --> 00:23:08,667
I love that Jonas said that this is making him be, you know, a better person he's not walking by something and what more do we want in our community than someone to say, hey, this needs to be fixed or this isn't right.

265
00:23:09,128 --> 00:23:11,189
I think that it's one of the most important things that you can do.

266
00:23:11,729 --> 00:23:14,731
It is so hard to get up to that podium and speak.

267
00:23:15,691 --> 00:23:18,253
Jonah you did it without any writing.

268
00:23:18,913 --> 00:23:22,435
I stood at that podium many times I couldn't do without writing something ahead of time.

269
00:23:22,775 --> 00:23:28,318
You're very well spoken I've watched you grow at the Brooks, and I'm so grateful that you're here so thank you so much.

270
00:23:28,438 --> 00:23:28,938
Savannah.

271
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:33,241
I'm a huge fan of your mama but you might have moved ahead.

272
00:23:34,241 --> 00:23:36,142
in the McLaughlin chain for me tonight.

273
00:23:36,342 --> 00:23:37,223
That was awesome.

274
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:38,503
You and Adam are amazing.

275
00:23:38,923 --> 00:23:43,326
I've loved watching all these Brooks bees come up here, especially once a bee, always a bee, right?

276
00:23:43,926 --> 00:23:45,347
So my heart is always there.

277
00:23:45,387 --> 00:23:47,588
So thank you guys so much for making a difference.

278
00:23:47,628 --> 00:23:51,890
And thanks for switching on the taser and the pepper spray.

279
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:52,791
Good job.

280
00:23:54,732 --> 00:23:55,312
Membrane topper.

281
00:23:56,241 --> 00:24:01,143
I also just wanted to take a second and just recognize how important this program is to our students.

282
00:24:01,883 --> 00:24:10,986
I actually, unfortunately, only got a chance to be a part of it my senior year in high school, but that was the cohort that witnessed it go to the elementary and middle school level.

283
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:19,488
And just seeing how much it's grown in only what I like to say two years, but it's been like five or six now, is absolutely amazing.

284
00:24:19,548 --> 00:24:24,610
And I'm so proud of you guys and everyone who's involved to get up here and speak and do what you do.

285
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:47,213
this program really takes you know when you take a moment and look at students special interests and you look at what they want to do to give back to the community and you fund that and you encourage them to do it you see such an increase in their overall academic success and their participation in our community the social emotional learning skills that you get and I just I really

286
00:24:47,814 --> 00:24:54,001
you know, seeing what happened and seeing the unfortunate incident that happened and just immediately coming to action and then doing this.

287
00:24:54,101 --> 00:24:58,345
I just, I can't commend you guys enough and I can't wait to see what you guys do next.

288
00:24:58,385 --> 00:24:59,046
I really can't.

289
00:24:59,086 --> 00:24:59,927
So thank you.

290
00:25:00,187 --> 00:25:00,868
Thank you so much.

291
00:25:00,908 --> 00:25:01,408
You're welcome.

292
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:10,708
Number seven.

293
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,729
Yes, thank you.

294
00:25:12,329 --> 00:25:16,790
I just want to comment that I feel like I see Jonah more than some of my own children.

295
00:25:18,011 --> 00:25:25,513
Everywhere I go I see Jonah whether it's a play or at the State House on May 10 or the ninth, sixth, whatever.

296
00:25:27,274 --> 00:25:29,775
He seems to always be everywhere which is sort of

297
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:38,542
what you'd expect from our students who are, and not just Jonah, there are several other students who are also at the State House.

298
00:25:38,862 --> 00:25:46,809
And I don't think that's a CCSR project, but their participation doesn't just start and end with the club times.

299
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,291
And I think that's really impressive.

300
00:25:49,512 --> 00:25:55,497
I do wonder how anybody manages that much in their schedule, but thank you for all of your efforts.

301
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,241
Yes.

302
00:26:00,301 --> 00:26:04,064
I just want to say thank you again to all of you, you did a wonderful job.

303
00:26:04,644 --> 00:26:07,346
Savannah, Adam, and thank you Jonah as well.

304
00:26:07,546 --> 00:26:20,034
I want to thank Mr. Trotter, I know we wouldn't have this program without the generous support of Cummings Foundation and our other partners, but the Cummings Foundation truly

305
00:26:21,715 --> 00:26:33,524
keeps giving back to Medford and this is a worthwhile program to continue investing in and so I just want to send another special thank you to them for their continued support of our school programming.

306
00:26:34,024 --> 00:26:34,645
Thank you again.

307
00:26:34,665 --> 00:26:37,427
Member Graham.

308
00:26:38,947 --> 00:26:41,029
I just wanted to say thank you, Adam and Savannah.

309
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:55,121
Savannah and I live in the same neighborhood, and I happen to be home when the attack took place, and I happened to be driving by as the police were responding, so it was sort of hard to understand what was happening at the time.

310
00:26:55,561 --> 00:27:01,566
But I sure am glad the news media didn't ruin Halloween for us in the neighborhood, because that would have been terrible.

311
00:27:01,646 --> 00:27:03,948
But thank you both for taking care of our mail carriers.

312
00:27:04,028 --> 00:27:05,149
It's really important work.

313
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:05,710
Thank you.

314
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:22,429
Just before we finish, I just want to mention the fact that the advisor, Michael Coates, couldn't be here because of a family issue.

315
00:27:22,989 --> 00:27:25,751
And he does a fantastic job with the students.

316
00:27:26,032 --> 00:27:29,734
This is not the first time that he's done an outstanding project with the students.

317
00:27:30,155 --> 00:27:33,697
And finally, I'm very proud of the program.

318
00:27:33,757 --> 00:27:34,818
I'm very proud of these students.

319
00:27:35,518 --> 00:27:37,860
It makes me happy, and I'm sure it makes you happy.

320
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:38,781
So thank you.

321
00:27:39,861 --> 00:27:40,182
Thank you.

322
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:52,205
We have number three, Humanities Student Recognition, Dr. Nicole Chiesa, Director of Humanities.

323
00:27:52,566 --> 00:27:52,867
Welcome.

324
00:28:04,395 --> 00:28:05,015
Good evening.

325
00:28:06,456 --> 00:28:15,662
Thank you for the opportunity tonight to honor several of our students who have really accomplished so many amazing achievements throughout the year.

326
00:28:15,922 --> 00:28:22,586
So we won't bring them all up because we know that would take too much time, but we're happy for those that were able to attend tonight.

327
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:25,387
We know there are games going on and other things happening.

328
00:28:26,308 --> 00:28:31,151
And as I go through the names, we'll ask people to stand so that we can honor them.

329
00:28:31,571 --> 00:28:32,492
slide-by-slides.

330
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:39,797
But first, I do want to take a moment on the next slide to thank the school committee, to thank Ms.

331
00:28:39,837 --> 00:28:43,100
Cabral, Mr. Fallon, Mr. Tucci, and Ms.

332
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,982
Skane for supporting these endeavors because we could not do it alone.

333
00:28:47,383 --> 00:28:51,125
Certainly for thanking you for funding and supporting us throughout the school year.

334
00:28:51,165 --> 00:28:51,706
So thank you.

335
00:28:54,585 --> 00:29:07,770
So I'm going to be reading a lot of names, you do have the report that you were provided with that explains several of these different endeavors but if there's any questions, I am more than happy to explain anything.

336
00:29:08,511 --> 00:29:13,813
We are going to start with the writing achievements, some of the writing achievements certainly this is not.

337
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:19,280
encompassing every achievement of the year, but some of the ones that we haven't had a chance to honor.

338
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,666
And so we do have the Boston Playwrights Theatres Young Playwrights Project.

339
00:29:24,106 --> 00:29:29,093
Why don't I read the names and then people could stand after, would that work for the group, the committee?

340
00:29:29,593 --> 00:29:30,034
Okay, great.

341
00:29:30,794 --> 00:29:48,250
So for the Boston Playwrights Theater's Young Playwrights Project, we have Michaela Callahan, Mandy Chow, Julia Hanratty, Kian Liu, Jonah Segal, Bethea Pierce, Kira Tramble, Stanley Sunwoo, Becky Wang, and Maria Zara.

342
00:29:48,831 --> 00:29:53,115
And we want to thank Mr. Bowen Flynn for supporting the students throughout that.

343
00:29:53,595 --> 00:29:57,599
We were also able to have the Shakespearean monologue competition.

344
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:10,272
We had one of our students who's here tonight, Jonah Siegel, who spoke so eloquently, really advance quite far and Mr. Bowen Flynn and all of us were just so proud of the efforts.

345
00:30:10,933 --> 00:30:21,218
For Boston Globe Scholastic Writing Award, we have our student here tonight, Christine Dehotel, who received both an Honorable Mention and a Silver Key.

346
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:31,003
She is a student of Mr. Ambrose, who shared with me today that she has a whole collection of writings, so we're very excited to see future works down the line, hopefully.

347
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:35,785
And finally, we have the Immigration Learning Center Teen Perspective.

348
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,386
We had three students from Ms.

349
00:30:37,426 --> 00:30:44,150
Sanford's class receive awards, Mosamed Habiba, Michael Pak, Madagalit Takale.

350
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:49,613
So if we could have the students that were able to come tonight stand and honor them, thank you so much and congratulations.

351
00:31:06,095 --> 00:31:08,158
And of course, thank you to their teachers as well.

352
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:11,121
The next slide is our students in action.

353
00:31:11,341 --> 00:31:21,093
So every year we have the opportunity to have some students go and actually go to different activities where they can engage in government

354
00:31:21,669 --> 00:31:22,109
actions.

355
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:25,491
We had the MASC Day on the Hill.

356
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:29,593
We had four students attend with Mr. Bowen Flynn.

357
00:31:30,234 --> 00:31:41,580
And we also wanted to give a special thank you to the school committee members who were able to attend, committee member Graham, Reinfeld, and Rousseau, as well as Senator Jalen for supporting the students at the event.

358
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,703
The students that were chosen for that were Mandy Chow, Ann Dupes, Sierra Isbell, and Jonah Segal.

359
00:31:48,544 --> 00:31:49,244
Segal, sorry.

360
00:31:50,765 --> 00:31:57,032
In addition to that, and I'm sorry I know I'm talking fast I'll slow down, I just want to make sure I get through the names.

361
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:07,144
We also had students participate in student government day, and we do have pictures up there, showing them in action as they attended government day.

362
00:32:07,644 --> 00:32:20,538
That was Helen Lucas, and Noah Uroskow, I apologize, and Mr. Bowen Flynn, who's our English teacher, was able to accompany them, said what a wonderful day it was for them.

363
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:23,101
And we were appreciative of their time as well.

364
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:40,176
We also had the geography be at our middle school, and we had finalists come and attend, and we had some really strong winners come out of that, we shared with you in the narrative, some of the questions that they had to answer.

365
00:32:41,036 --> 00:32:42,517
They were superb.

366
00:32:42,857 --> 00:32:59,661
So we did want to take a minute to recognize Joe Hogan, Richard Mongle, Stanley Tong, and Stefano Lozaro, who achieved first place, Elliot Traber-Hill, who achieved second place, and Emmett Berryman, who achieved third place.

367
00:33:00,121 --> 00:33:05,443
We are really, really proud of them, really proud of Mr. McCarthy, Mr. Villard, Ms.

368
00:33:05,503 --> 00:33:09,144
O'Donohue, and Mr. Zizzo for supporting them through this.

369
00:33:09,724 --> 00:33:18,454
So all the students who I just named, if they could take a moment, if they're here, and we could maybe congratulate them for such an excellent job well done, that would be wonderful.

370
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:45,192
I should also mention that they will be receiving certificates within their buildings, just not tonight in the interest of just a lot of wonderful success stories.

371
00:33:46,473 --> 00:33:51,895
The next event that we wanted to make sure we recognized were our simulations.

372
00:33:52,195 --> 00:34:00,379
So we have a few different groups that engage in various simulations through clubs or through classroom activities.

373
00:34:01,099 --> 00:34:03,460
And we begin with our model United Nations.

374
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:22,006
This year model United Nations was run by Mr. Matthew Brophy, and he did it as more of an after school activity and he accomplished so many wonderful things that I did share with you in the narratives, but we're really proud of him to be able to do this after school as opposed to in class.

375
00:34:22,946 --> 00:34:28,751
And he you approved the Dartmouth overnight field trip they had a wonderful time and did quite well.

376
00:34:29,291 --> 00:34:39,359
And they have a amazing team i've put a picture in the background for you and i'll just read the names through and hopefully those who are here can be honored.

377
00:34:39,803 --> 00:34:48,852
So we have Emma Van Wee, Man Chow, Shahan Kadri, who did receive an Honorable Mention recipient at one of the simulations.

378
00:34:49,412 --> 00:34:52,795
Brian DiPlazido, who received a People's Choice Award.

379
00:34:53,736 --> 00:35:04,206
Jack Dodd, Anne Dupes, Yamile Etienne, Sierra Godley, Bridget Inman, Sierra Isbell, Mohamed Jamaluddin, Sean Johnson,

380
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:20,801
Margaret Carroll, Leanne Lam, Evan Russell, Kira Tremble, Kiana Tran, Darren Chong, who also received both a Model United Nations Outstanding Delegate and Best Orator recipient, both two awards.

381
00:35:21,902 --> 00:35:31,506
Daviana Vega, Jaden Ville, Noah Urasko, and Maria Zasra.

382
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:33,567
They did an amazing job.

383
00:35:34,067 --> 00:35:36,868
Love the energy and a huge thank you to Mr. Brophy as well.

384
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:41,830
If anyone's here tonight, if they'd like to stand to be honored, we would love to congratulate you for all of your efforts.

385
00:35:57,954 --> 00:35:58,514
Okay.

386
00:35:59,455 --> 00:36:04,497
And last but not least, we have our mock trial and our ethics bowl.

387
00:36:05,237 --> 00:36:12,080
Our mock trial, as you read in the narrative, engaged in multiple trials throughout the school year.

388
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,661
They were led by our advisor, Ms.

389
00:36:15,681 --> 00:36:17,402
Dineu, and they

390
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:31,510
both worked in the classroom to prepare for these mock trials, as well as after school, and then were able to really go in, get different points based on their arguments, and achieve some very strong success.

391
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:48,124
Participants in mock trial were Michelle vegan Genevieve blot Eric Brown, Michael could a clay can have been Nathan Chevalier, Sophia de Mello, Brian de Placido, Gavin gain.

392
00:36:49,105 --> 00:37:05,458
DeFord Guerra, Nathaniel Hopper, Maria Lima Costa, Helen Lucas, Anna Sophia Marrera, Madeline Morris, Theodore Norton, Mark Parr, Tenzin Richen, and Christopher Rothermel.

393
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:10,722
And then we had our EPICS Bowl, which I've already presented on before.

394
00:37:11,163 --> 00:37:14,766
And thanks to your generosity, they did go to nationals.

395
00:37:15,006 --> 00:37:16,447
They had a wonderful time.

396
00:37:17,004 --> 00:37:20,425
They performed exceptionally well, as you read.

397
00:37:20,445 --> 00:37:28,048
And we just wanted to take, again, I know I already thanked you, but we are very appreciative of your support for that trip.

398
00:37:28,688 --> 00:37:31,189
And I wanted to read the names of the students who attended.

399
00:37:31,209 --> 00:37:33,450
So we have Sonia Benapal.

400
00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:47,148
Anne Dupes, Andre Duriti, Claire Gingo, Amira Laflamme, Carmen Morgante, Bahaba Sahil, and we also have our wonderful advisor, Mr. Esner.

401
00:37:47,608 --> 00:37:55,110
I also failed to mention in the slide previous to that, for Model UN, the other advisor in addition to Mr. Brophy is Ms.

402
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:55,470
Gates.

403
00:37:56,430 --> 00:38:02,352
If you could stand, if you were able to attend, and we could honor you and thank you for all of your hard work.

404
00:38:21,308 --> 00:38:28,552
Thank you again for your time, for supporting these students, and a huge congratulations to the students, the teachers, and everybody else.

405
00:38:28,692 --> 00:38:29,452
Thank you so much.

406
00:38:29,552 --> 00:38:34,455
I'm happy to answer any questions, but yeah, I'm happy to answer any questions.

407
00:38:34,635 --> 00:38:34,915
Thank you.

408
00:38:34,935 --> 00:38:36,176
Great presentation.

409
00:38:36,236 --> 00:38:36,996
Congratulations.

410
00:38:37,176 --> 00:38:37,516
Thank you.

411
00:38:37,776 --> 00:38:38,477
Thank you very much.

412
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:45,841
I noticed a few people stood up more than once too, so we'll get some.

413
00:38:47,252 --> 00:38:48,673
Great students, well-rounded.

414
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:53,014
We have our Medford High School update and survey results.

415
00:38:53,215 --> 00:38:54,175
Our principal, Ms.

416
00:38:54,195 --> 00:38:55,375
Manta Cabral, welcome.

417
00:38:55,936 --> 00:39:12,183
Am I on?

418
00:39:12,603 --> 00:39:12,743
Yes.

419
00:39:15,095 --> 00:39:19,920
Good evening, Mayor, members of the School Committee, and Superintendent, Dr. Eduardo Vinson.

420
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:29,029
It is hard to believe that in less than two weeks, we'll be wishing our seniors well as they cross the stage to graduate and continue on with post-secondary in our careers.

421
00:39:29,649 --> 00:39:38,378
The end of the school year is a busy time with exams, events, and celebrations, but it's also a time to reflect on the accomplishments and growth of the school.

422
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:47,634
Tonight, we'll review and highlight the school year.

423
00:39:47,774 --> 00:39:58,752
Specifically, we'll review the culture and climate survey, share new core values and community norms, highlight the accomplishments of our CTE programs, along with what is next for MHS.

424
00:40:00,354 --> 00:40:07,879
The Culture and Climate Survey was administered in May of 2023, 2024, sorry, was administered in May of 2023 and again most recently in late April of 2024.

425
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:11,161
A total of 711 MHS students in grades 9 through 12 participated in the survey during advisory block.

426
00:40:20,907 --> 00:40:31,780
The survey is composed of eight categories, cultural awareness and action, diversity and inclusion, school belonging, school climate, school engagement,

427
00:40:33,138 --> 00:40:37,781
school safety, student-teacher relationships, and valuing of school.

428
00:40:38,821 --> 00:40:48,827
When presented with the 2022-2023 school year data, MHS identified and shared at a previous school committee member three categories.

429
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:56,152
The categories included areas of strength, areas with varied results, and areas for growth.

430
00:40:57,462 --> 00:41:02,306
In slide 68, I've provided statistical comparison between the two years.

431
00:41:02,867 --> 00:41:18,521
It's important to note that Panorama, the survey platform, identifies increases of more than two percentage points as statistically significant, meaning it could have not happened by chance based on our survey size.

432
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:27,193
have identified questions from the survey to share with you tonight and represent areas of strength and continued areas of growth for Medford High School.

433
00:41:28,173 --> 00:41:34,994
As shown on slide six, school belonging is how much students feel they're valued members of the school community.

434
00:41:35,634 --> 00:41:38,775
In all three questions, students showed 5% or more increase from the 2022-2023 school year.

435
00:41:43,536 --> 00:41:44,477
School engagement.

436
00:41:45,057 --> 00:41:48,640
Students' attentiveness and investment in school remains stable at 91%.

437
00:41:49,101 --> 00:41:52,323
And lastly, valuing of school.

438
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:58,088
How much students feel that school is interesting, important, and useful showed an increase of between 7% to 9%.

439
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,581
In slide seven, student-teacher relationships.

440
00:42:04,341 --> 00:42:10,563
Strength of the social connections between students and teachers within and beyond school.

441
00:42:11,464 --> 00:42:20,447
This year, I would identify student-teacher relationships as a strength at MHS, with an eight to 10% increase in the five questions shared.

442
00:42:20,907 --> 00:42:24,128
This is a testament to the dedication of our valued faculty.

443
00:42:25,174 --> 00:42:30,939
School safety demonstrated a nine to 15% shift in the questions identified.

444
00:42:31,659 --> 00:42:42,748
Students at school feel safe, students at the school get along with each other, students at school threaten to hurt other students, and students at this school fight a lot.

445
00:42:43,449 --> 00:42:47,212
I consider school safety to remain in the varied results category.

446
00:42:48,593 --> 00:43:00,017
On slide eight, school climate, overall social and learning climate of the school, this category showed significant growth from the 2022-2023 school year.

447
00:43:00,537 --> 00:43:15,683
The questions with the greatest change are, adults at this school reward students for positive behavior, students at this school try to work out their disagreements with other students by talking to them, and school rules and discipline are applied equally and fairly.

448
00:43:17,023 --> 00:43:24,646
Lastly, cultural awareness and action, along with diversity inclusion, show that they are trending in a positive direction.

449
00:43:25,906 --> 00:43:31,288
Medford High School has focused on creating environments where students feel welcomed, supported, and safe.

450
00:43:31,908 --> 00:43:41,952
We've made an assertive effort and commitment to hear students and staff voices, and have not only listened, but made changes at MHS to incorporate feedback and suggestions.

451
00:43:42,672 --> 00:43:45,816
We held more community gatherings to build school spirit and pride.

452
00:43:46,357 --> 00:44:00,195
We work together on core values and have continuously incorporated restorative practices into our work with students, along with providing professional development on restorative and tiered model intervention strategies in the classroom.

453
00:44:01,176 --> 00:44:13,701
We understand that culture and climate shifts at Medford High School will take time, but we're committed to providing an inclusive, safe, and academically rigorous learning environment that our students and staff deserve.

454
00:44:14,342 --> 00:44:21,204
I'm pleased to see the positive shifts are being made and that growth is noted over an 11th month span between surveys.

455
00:44:21,805 --> 00:44:27,047
Consensus among educational researchers note a three to five year period for change.

456
00:44:31,069 --> 00:44:36,795
Shifting to some of the work done this year, together as students and staff, we developed our new core values.

457
00:44:37,155 --> 00:44:46,244
After conversations and advisory and small group panels, students selected the three core values of respect, responsibility, and empathy and kindness.

458
00:44:46,865 --> 00:44:54,432
For staff, we held a workshop along with discussion and house meetings and surveys to identify the three shared core values.

459
00:44:55,133 --> 00:44:59,417
Community norms were developed in January and discussed as a community and advisory.

460
00:44:59,437 --> 00:45:03,861
We started working on a shared vision, along with a portrait of a graduate.

461
00:45:05,403 --> 00:45:12,410
At this time, I'm going to pause and I'm going to hand it over to Mr. Fallon to highlight our CTE programs and students.

462
00:45:17,429 --> 00:45:20,751
Good evening, Madam Superintendent, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

463
00:45:20,771 --> 00:45:24,114
I'm gonna provide a brief update on career and technical education for this year.

464
00:45:25,214 --> 00:45:29,758
We did have 304 students, which was our highest number ever, participate in Freshman Exploratory.

465
00:45:30,418 --> 00:45:36,682
Of those students, 185 were placed in CTE programs, and 72 students chose a traditional high school pathway.

466
00:45:37,563 --> 00:45:39,905
At this time, we have 47 students on a wait list.

467
00:45:40,787 --> 00:45:43,069
For cooperative education, we had 58 students.

468
00:45:43,329 --> 00:45:48,613
Some of our stellar juniors who are ready ahead of time are out working and making money.

469
00:45:49,154 --> 00:45:52,436
Over 50 employee partners make up our partnerships now.

470
00:45:52,997 --> 00:45:56,059
Many of our seniors will continue employment after their graduation.

471
00:45:56,459 --> 00:46:02,764
And two companies that I know of as of this week have offered complete college tuition for these two students that are working.

472
00:46:02,804 --> 00:46:03,505
So that's exciting.

473
00:46:05,418 --> 00:46:07,200
Some more updates, if you could click the link.

474
00:46:07,801 --> 00:46:14,847
I've been talking about the sheds the few times I've been in front of you, and I think that's another good time to highlight what our students can do in the community.

475
00:46:18,391 --> 00:46:26,478
So we started pretty basic, and as you'll see, the pictures, as they increase, they've become a little bit better each time, because practice makes perfect.

476
00:46:26,498 --> 00:46:29,121
So that's what we call a man cave at this point, or woman cave.

477
00:46:32,073 --> 00:46:33,796
That was a shed that they just did recently.

478
00:46:33,856 --> 00:46:35,058
That's at the Andrew School.

479
00:46:35,158 --> 00:46:40,768
So just to give you an idea of our carpentry students, it's our version of a house building project, but a little bit smaller.

480
00:46:42,607 --> 00:46:46,010
In health assisting, we had seven of our students pass their CNA exam.

481
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,572
We have one certified dental assistant now.

482
00:46:49,513 --> 00:46:57,099
We are finding success with the Bunker Hill Community College dual enrollment program, and we're exploring a new partnership for clinical rotations with Winchester Hospital.

483
00:46:57,919 --> 00:47:07,927
Our construction and craft laborer students, the picture on the right, received their hoisting apprenticeship license this past week, and 15 students were inducted into the National Technical Honor Society.

484
00:47:08,925 --> 00:47:13,730
For our electrical students, two students have been chosen to join the IBEW Electrical Union.

485
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:18,294
Nine students will be entering the workforce as apprentices immediately after graduation.

486
00:47:18,975 --> 00:47:26,583
Pictured in the lower right is a picture of our graphic design program that made the Mustang pride t-shirt for some new swag that can be sold in the Mustang mall.

487
00:47:29,648 --> 00:47:31,009
Two more things to share with you tonight.

488
00:47:31,129 --> 00:47:35,712
One being the biodiesel project that was a collaborative effort between multiple CTE programs.

489
00:47:35,732 --> 00:47:38,834
So this all started by collecting waste vegetable oil from culinary.

490
00:47:39,335 --> 00:47:43,838
Biotech students began the process of converting and using the cooking oil into clean burning fuel.

491
00:47:44,518 --> 00:47:52,844
Then the students proceeded to learn and master the techniques to how to successfully produce several gallons of refined biodiesel, which burns cleaner than regular diesel fuel.

492
00:47:53,524 --> 00:47:58,408
They also received a $2,000 grant from the Medford Educational Foundation to help pay for supplies.

493
00:47:59,188 --> 00:48:06,532
Metal Fab and Auto Tech completed an engine swap of a go-kart, and Business Marketing explored the feasibility of starting a biodiesel production business.

494
00:48:07,053 --> 00:48:14,277
They also took a field trip to the biodiesel factory, Northeast Biodiesel, which is out in Greenfield, to observe it on a much larger scale.

495
00:48:15,527 --> 00:48:20,431
Coral Chavez will present our biodiesel project at the MAVA Connecting for Success conference in June.

496
00:48:21,192 --> 00:48:26,936
Along with that, if you're in the neighborhood, Friday we're having an open house of sorts to showcase some of our students' accomplishments this year.

497
00:48:27,176 --> 00:48:29,118
We will be highlighting the biodiesel project.

498
00:48:31,059 --> 00:48:40,747
The last thing I'd like to share, and if members of the team are here, if you could come up and join me, is to honor our robotics team, who has once again, are they here?

499
00:48:46,658 --> 00:48:53,143
So this is the third year in a row that our students have competed.

500
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:54,164
Let me get my notes here.

501
00:48:55,025 --> 00:48:56,186
And I wanna honor the students.

502
00:48:56,206 --> 00:49:02,551
So I'm thrilled to announce that Medford's MVTHS Mate Robotics Team has again won the Mate Rove New England Regional Championship.

503
00:49:03,092 --> 00:49:08,336
This year, they narrowly edged out Phillips Exeter Academy by a score of 445 to 437.

504
00:49:09,977 --> 00:49:14,781
Now they'll be representing New England at the competition in Tennessee, correct?

505
00:49:15,962 --> 00:49:29,050
I'd like to honor Tim Hunt, Ben Santana, Miles Hilliard, Scott Campbell, Jonas Wurz, Matt Harris, Aaron Van Daniel, Zach Bertocchi, Franklin Soto-Ortiz, Noah Reed, and Ben Wertz.

506
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:29,751
Congratulations.

507
00:49:43,304 --> 00:49:46,625
I never even try to explain anything in engineering and robotics.

508
00:49:46,725 --> 00:49:50,066
I leave it for the students, so please tell us what you did.

509
00:49:50,086 --> 00:49:52,006
Sure.

510
00:49:52,026 --> 00:49:57,888
Hey there, I'm Matty Harris, member of SecRobotics, obviously, our MPTHS robotics team.

511
00:49:58,268 --> 00:50:11,252
As we mentioned, we compete in the MATE ROV competition, and so we design underwater robots that are designed to compete in a competition where we perform tasks that mimic real-world environmental tasks like

512
00:50:12,032 --> 00:50:24,720
like cleaning up, say, trash in the ocean, or finding data on marine life, improving habitats, and stuff like that.

513
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:34,726
It's a really amazing experience, combination of a lot of different disciplines in engineering, hardware, electrical, software.

514
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:38,489
I found it to be a really awesome learning experience.

515
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:49,702
And we also like to acknowledge that we couldn't do this without the support of our vocational teachers, Mr. Christie, he spent countless hours with us and Ms.

516
00:50:49,722 --> 00:50:54,827
Miller as well, our programming teacher, and say it's a really great opportunity.

517
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:55,688
I'm very thankful.

518
00:50:55,988 --> 00:50:56,249
Thank you.

519
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:07,899
Also, I just want to thank Ms.

520
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:13,244
Rachel Perry, who was really good in helping us find some lanes in the pool to test our robots.

521
00:51:13,285 --> 00:51:14,966
So thank you, Rachel, for that.

522
00:51:15,747 --> 00:51:16,868
OK, back to you, Marta.

523
00:51:18,891 --> 00:51:19,511
All right.

524
00:51:21,073 --> 00:51:21,994
So I believe we're on slide 14.

525
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:41,487
So alongside school site council for Medford High School and aligned with the district strategic plan we identified this year for strategic priorities for MHS and they're included in the school improvement plan for Medford High School.

526
00:51:42,127 --> 00:51:52,078
This plan will span over three years and the four priorities are as followed that we want to improve or to improve student academic and technical achievement.

527
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:59,167
The second is to implement practices to ensure a safe inclusive and supportive school climate and culture for all community members.

528
00:51:59,747 --> 00:52:18,064
Number three is to improve community engagement and collaboration and routine regular and transparent communications with all stakeholders in Medford and to create a strategic list of facility needs in order to provide students and staff with clean, safe and academically conducive learning environment.

529
00:52:18,384 --> 00:52:20,886
So those can be found in the school improvement plan.

530
00:52:23,184 --> 00:52:34,451
On slide 15, I would like to update on the status of the Welsh report recommendations that were provided last year and that were reviewed at the beginning of this school year.

531
00:52:37,603 --> 00:52:42,444
For the first recommendation, a creation of MHS committees were recommended.

532
00:52:42,824 --> 00:52:50,846
There were a total of four that were recommended to the school and to the committee, them being safety and security team.

533
00:52:51,267 --> 00:52:56,808
We have implemented this by weekly meetings with our SRO, administration and director of school counseling.

534
00:52:57,288 --> 00:53:03,390
Monthly meetings are also held with the district attorney's office to discuss support for youth in Medford.

535
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:08,196
Diversity, equity, and inclusion committee was recommended.

536
00:53:08,637 --> 00:53:13,845
We've not formalized a committee yet, but we'll have one implemented for the 24-25 school year.

537
00:53:14,125 --> 00:53:18,832
We recognize and believe that inclusion, diversity, and equity need to be at the center of our work.

538
00:53:20,178 --> 00:53:23,441
Community on norms for student behavior, shared values.

539
00:53:23,561 --> 00:53:37,493
This is something that we decided to do as a whole school and to develop shared norms and shared core values along with as a whole school have a shared vision for next year along with a portrait of a graduate.

540
00:53:38,414 --> 00:53:45,480
And lastly, the schedule committee, a consultant was hired by MPS and we're continuing to review their recommendations for implementation.

541
00:53:47,212 --> 00:53:54,600
The second recommendation was to provide more opportunities for teachers input and decision making and build relationships between teachers and administration.

542
00:53:55,520 --> 00:54:05,911
Feedback is continuously incorporated into all staff meetings, along with processes on how to collect feedback and suggestions throughout the year virtually.

543
00:54:07,032 --> 00:54:21,181
Number three parent caregiver surveys about culture and climate, and they just during the 2023 2024 school year, we're currently working on creating this survey and distributing it at the end of the school year to our caregivers and parents.

544
00:54:22,121 --> 00:54:25,805
Number four, MHS associate or assistant principal.

545
00:54:26,345 --> 00:54:44,202
We did shift administration and we did hire a assistant principal for operations and student engagement, who is now part of the administrative team at Medford High School.

546
00:54:44,882 --> 00:54:56,250
Mentoring for new administrators, new assistant principals attended this year the regional AP conference and mentoring is continuously provided to APs through both Chad and myself.

547
00:54:57,071 --> 00:55:03,335
They also attended workshops and other professional development opportunities offered to APs in our region.

548
00:55:03,355 --> 00:55:12,162
MPS has also provided me with a coach this year, which has been wonderful through the school administrator association.

549
00:55:14,475 --> 00:55:20,797
Lastly, the last slide is stops for the horizon.

550
00:55:21,477 --> 00:55:26,539
Medford High School, and this is a program proposal that we would like to pilot at the high school.

551
00:55:27,399 --> 00:55:35,342
Medford High School has identified a need for an alternative program for at risk students who do not qualify for special education at the high school.

552
00:55:35,422 --> 00:55:39,363
Currently, we have the therapeutic learning program, but we're looking at

553
00:55:39,943 --> 00:55:44,869
piloting a alternative program within the high school for our students.

554
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:57,325
These students are currently not making adequate academic progress, and they've been identified, are repeating a grade for the first and or second time, so they're overage, undercredited, and they're at risk of dropping out due to that.

555
00:55:57,966 --> 00:56:08,129
Their struggles consist of student-related, family-related, school-related, or community-related barriers that we have identified that are hindering their academic progress towards graduation.

556
00:56:08,749 --> 00:56:27,335
By creating an alternative setting, we're able to individualize education, provide supports towards graduation and graduating with their cohort, and we're able to be more flexible in understanding student barriers that are preventing them from making the academic progress that they need in order to graduate on time.

557
00:56:29,306 --> 00:56:46,757
At this time, we have concluded our presentation, but most importantly, and probably the most exciting part of this time in May is the commencement ceremony that is quickly approaching as our seniors, the class of 2024 are about to graduate.

558
00:56:47,157 --> 00:56:54,161
So we would like to formally invite you to June 5th at Hormel Stadium for the graduation of the class of 2024.

559
00:56:56,634 --> 00:57:01,978
I thank you for your continued support, and if you have any questions or comments, or we could take them offline.

560
00:57:03,159 --> 00:57:03,720
Member Russo?

561
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:05,101
Thank you for the report.

562
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:16,149
The headliner for me was actually the survey, and while there's lots of good stuff in there, but in the survey data, everything went in the right direction.

563
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:17,170
Everything.

564
00:57:17,931 --> 00:57:20,172
And I think that's really awesome.

565
00:57:20,493 --> 00:57:20,793
Thank you.

566
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,632
I mean, this is your first principalship, right?

567
00:57:30,032 --> 00:57:30,452
First.

568
00:57:30,753 --> 00:57:33,855
So I think there's, you should be very proud.

569
00:57:33,995 --> 00:57:37,658
I mean, not even a full school year and it's, I'm impressed.

570
00:57:37,758 --> 00:57:48,287
So I just, there's a lot in here that we could talk all night about, but the survey data I've been waiting with bated breath and thank you for the great work you've been doing.

571
00:57:48,447 --> 00:57:50,509
And I look forward to what you can do in the future.

572
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:51,270
Thank you.

573
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:54,213
I couldn't do it without the staff and with students this year.

574
00:57:54,233 --> 00:58:02,942
They've been extremely supportive, and they've really rolled their sleeves up, the staff at MHS, and really taken this on with me because it's for our students.

575
00:58:03,022 --> 00:58:04,143
So I thank them.

576
00:58:04,183 --> 00:58:10,088
I know there's several in the room, but I really do thank them because I couldn't have done it on my own, neither could Chad or the admin team.

577
00:58:13,292 --> 00:58:14,593
Member Graham and Member Bramley?

578
00:58:15,994 --> 00:58:16,454
Thank you.

579
00:58:16,474 --> 00:58:21,237
I just had a couple of questions about the alternative program proposal.

580
00:58:21,257 --> 00:58:41,029
This actually came up when we were having some discussions to start to feed some of the work that we have to do for MSBA to describe the kind of programming that happens currently in the building, and then also start to think about what programming would we want to have happen in the building, and Ms.

581
00:58:41,049 --> 00:58:42,190
Cabral brought this forward.

582
00:58:42,899 --> 00:58:49,166
And I asked her to share her thoughts with all of us so that we could understand sort of the goals here.

583
00:58:49,246 --> 00:59:03,643
So can you talk a little bit about this, when you think you can do this and the staffing that you think you need in order to do it and any other like barriers that are in your way of helping these students right now?

584
00:59:05,272 --> 00:59:09,118
Yes, so I did propose two models of how it could work.

585
00:59:09,298 --> 00:59:15,808
One is to have a humanities, to have less staff and have a humanities and a STEM teacher.

586
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:19,854
And then the other one is to have four core academics in the classroom.

587
00:59:22,643 --> 00:59:30,790
We have identified students, like I had mentioned, that are overage, undercredited, and there's an urgency to get them through the 10th grade.

588
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:42,379
We know that once we get students through the 10th grade, their graduation rate is much higher than if they were to repeat 9th grade or repeat twice 9th grade, which we do have students on track to do that.

589
00:59:42,899 --> 00:59:59,907
So when it comes to barriers that I have currently, it would definitely be staffing and strategically looking at how that staffing may work in order to best support the students because I don't want to create a program that is not fully supportive of the needs that they they currently need each day.

590
01:00:01,388 --> 01:00:08,392
And then also space, we would need to look at the space and where that would be best placed within the high school.

591
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:18,958
I have lots of ideas for when we re-imagine the high school, but there is an urgency right now based off the data that we're presented with, with some of our students that are at risk for dropping out.

592
01:00:20,299 --> 01:00:25,922
And so do you think that you can start this program next year and

593
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:32,902
Is that reflected in your current scheduling dynamic?

594
01:00:33,242 --> 01:00:35,684
So we're currently still doing the schedule.

595
01:00:35,864 --> 01:00:42,807
I hope to identify if we can and propose to central office if we do have staffing that would allow for it.

596
01:00:43,928 --> 01:00:51,052
We are also, at the moment, identifying teachers that can provide interventions to all MHS students.

597
01:00:51,372 --> 01:00:56,775
So it's a little bit of a puzzle piece right now as to if we have the current staffing needed.

598
01:00:57,315 --> 01:01:07,717
If we do have the current staffing needed, I would like to take a very small cohort of students and be able to do something and pilot it within this school year, within the coming school year.

599
01:01:09,558 --> 01:01:18,300
But it really, I will not know until probably the next two weeks when it comes to that, because I do wanna provide interventions for math and ELA support for all students.

600
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:23,241
I just wanna say that this is the kind of strategic,

601
01:01:24,997 --> 01:01:31,185
project and initiative that the committee has sort of been begging to be put forward from the high school campus.

602
01:01:31,445 --> 01:01:42,700
And I'm just so happy to hear that we are looking at the data, we are identifying students that are at risk, and we know how specifically to help them and where and when to intervene.

603
01:01:45,181 --> 01:01:49,322
since I have been on the school committee, I have like literally been waiting for this presentation.

604
01:01:49,362 --> 01:02:01,087
So I'm so happy that it's finally here and it's only been four and a half years and it's not been a decade, but I do want to sort of like, we're all here, this room is full because we're having a budget presentation soon.

605
01:02:01,167 --> 01:02:03,888
So I would like to make a motion that Ms.

606
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:10,610
Cabral gets the staffing that she needs to pilot this program next year, no matter what happens with the budget.

607
01:02:13,094 --> 01:02:13,635
I'll second that.

608
01:02:15,797 --> 01:02:18,961
Motion by Member Graham, seconded by Member Branley.

609
01:02:18,982 --> 01:02:20,323
All those in favor?

610
01:02:20,343 --> 01:02:21,004
Aye.

611
01:02:21,805 --> 01:02:22,506
All those opposed?

612
01:02:23,587 --> 01:02:24,268
Motion passes.

613
01:02:25,249 --> 01:02:25,930
Thank you, that's it.

614
01:02:26,551 --> 01:02:26,851
Thank you.

615
01:02:27,032 --> 01:02:27,592
Member Branley?

616
01:02:30,047 --> 01:02:32,230
I think I may be one of your biggest fans.

617
01:02:32,691 --> 01:02:34,493
I've said from day one that I thought you were a unicorn.

618
01:02:34,774 --> 01:02:36,777
I was on the committee to hire you.

619
01:02:37,498 --> 01:02:38,639
Member Graham was there also.

620
01:02:38,699 --> 01:02:43,226
There was maybe 10 to 15 of us that were in that room when you came in to interview.

621
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:46,670
And you walked out and there was this silence.

622
01:02:48,107 --> 01:02:52,390
And I remember just saying, if all of you don't wanna give her a hug right now, I'm moving.

623
01:02:53,751 --> 01:02:58,554
And luckily you are still the unicorn and I just can't, I don't wanna become emotional.

624
01:02:58,574 --> 01:02:59,675
I promise I would never cry here.

625
01:02:59,755 --> 01:03:02,917
And every time, every week I say, I'm not gonna cry.

626
01:03:03,638 --> 01:03:06,900
But these are happy, this makes me very, very happy.

627
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,542
I have really, really pushed for accountability in this district.

628
01:03:10,603 --> 01:03:16,567
I have really begged for safety, accountability, yes, more than anything.

629
01:03:17,988 --> 01:03:18,649
I'm proud of you.

630
01:03:18,989 --> 01:03:19,950
I thank you so much.

631
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:20,590
I really do.

632
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:24,253
You and Chad are rock stars in my book, so thank you very much.

633
01:03:24,273 --> 01:03:24,974
I'm still not gonna cry.

634
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:30,838
But I think that there's always still work to be done.

635
01:03:30,898 --> 01:03:36,543
The amount of emails that we get about day-to-day basis, things that are happening in the building still concern me.

636
01:03:36,683 --> 01:03:41,867
I'm not trying to be a Debbie Downer by any means because I am really Medford's cheerleader here.

637
01:03:42,427 --> 01:03:46,391
But I just wanna make sure that we don't lose sight of the day-to-day

638
01:03:47,111 --> 01:03:47,992
things that are going on.

639
01:03:49,453 --> 01:03:52,215
The Welch page was not in our packet.

640
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:54,077
Could we have a copy?

641
01:03:54,357 --> 01:03:54,658
Yes.

642
01:03:54,818 --> 01:03:55,018
Okay.

643
01:03:55,058 --> 01:03:55,899
We'll reshare that.

644
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:58,401
That was asked to be added yesterday.

645
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:59,722
So we added it this morning.

646
01:04:00,182 --> 01:04:00,923
Yeah.

647
01:04:01,323 --> 01:04:01,624
Awesome.

648
01:04:01,924 --> 01:04:02,344
Thank you.

649
01:04:02,524 --> 01:04:02,965
Thank you.

650
01:04:03,265 --> 01:04:03,625
Thank you.

651
01:04:03,645 --> 01:04:04,426
Thank you.

652
01:04:04,486 --> 01:04:05,207
Keep up the great work.

653
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:06,919
Member Rheintald.

654
01:04:07,259 --> 01:04:09,560
Yeah, I have a question about the survey.

655
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,962
So I would also incredibly encouraged by the numbers.

656
01:04:13,202 --> 01:04:31,249
I am wondering if there's gonna be any effort to break down particularly cultural awareness and action and diversity inclusion, those questions by some of the more vulnerable populations to see whether the average across the student population may not be representative of the rough and targeted by some of these challenges.

657
01:04:31,269 --> 01:04:34,871
So I'm wondering if we can look a little more closely to see

658
01:04:36,354 --> 01:04:38,576
what that sub data looks like there.

659
01:04:38,856 --> 01:04:39,937
Yes, I can't agree more.

660
01:04:40,017 --> 01:04:42,298
We had a very quick turnaround for the presentation.

661
01:04:42,358 --> 01:04:45,921
We really just did like an overall brief summary.

662
01:04:45,961 --> 01:04:50,624
We really do need to break it down in order to continue making shifts and progress.

663
01:04:50,684 --> 01:04:57,529
So yes, that will be done over the summer months to really focus in and hone in onto the work that we need to do.

664
01:04:58,009 --> 01:04:58,230
I agree.

665
01:04:58,830 --> 01:04:59,251
Thank you.

666
01:04:59,471 --> 01:05:11,868
And then this might be a question for the superintendent so the Welch report had a lot of focus on the high school on there was also some of this mentoring for other schools in the district and looking at climate, kind of, more broadly across the district.

667
01:05:12,168 --> 01:05:14,751
And so I'm wondering what's happening on that front.

668
01:05:18,469 --> 01:05:35,203
So we are definitely primary focus this year really was the high school to get it up and running and have it be a different experience for and staff within the building which this current survey reflects.

669
01:05:35,823 --> 01:05:52,257
The, the broad feedback from the Welsh report, we did not do panorama surveys in the other schools to be able to this is concrete data, but we do have support for some of the new administrators who did come on board.

670
01:05:54,579 --> 01:06:07,795
global context, there has been support and implementation, but the real focus this year for us was the high school to really see this data shift and start to move in the right direction.

671
01:06:08,036 --> 01:06:12,301
And we're all very, very pleased that that's what is happening right now.

672
01:06:12,561 --> 01:06:14,702
Yeah, absolutely, I agree completely.

673
01:06:14,882 --> 01:06:21,224
And I just want to make on record the comment that our, you know, our middle school students are the next high schoolers and elementary.

674
01:06:21,244 --> 01:06:24,265
So this, all this work really has to be district wide.

675
01:06:24,385 --> 01:06:25,985
And I'm so encouraged by this.

676
01:06:26,346 --> 01:06:26,886
So thank you.

677
01:06:27,026 --> 01:06:28,686
And thanks to everyone who made it possible.

678
01:06:29,327 --> 01:06:30,967
Thank you.

679
01:06:32,328 --> 01:06:33,828
Yes, our student rep, come on up.

680
01:06:33,848 --> 01:06:36,529
Then we have somebody online.

681
01:06:42,046 --> 01:06:42,947
Yes, absolutely.

682
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:52,561
Should be on.

683
01:06:55,365 --> 01:07:16,750
Well, I'd just like to say when it comes to the slide on student engagement, especially when it comes to student voice, in my experience, and Darren can certainly speak to it too, the administration's, MHS administration's support for student voice has definitely discernibly increased over the past year.

684
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:23,972
It's definitely been a big help as we've tried to flesh out our role on the student advisory committee and how we can work to get kids more involved at school.

685
01:07:24,512 --> 01:07:27,817
That has definitely been, especially thanks to Ms.

686
01:07:27,857 --> 01:07:28,437
Cabral and Ms.

687
01:07:28,457 --> 01:07:33,484
Freitas-Haley, who have worked closely with us to try to get, implement very meaningful changes.

688
01:07:35,547 --> 01:07:38,611
And just sort of to add off of what Noah said, sorry.

689
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:58,637
When it's starting with core values, I believe these core values really represent Medford High School as a whole, and just speaking with students and being out in the general student body and I think we've noticed a general positive trends at the high school with student involvement, as well as a student

690
01:08:00,604 --> 01:08:04,327
students' well-being and their kind of like will to be in the schools.

691
01:08:05,107 --> 01:08:06,188
We've worked carefully with Ms.

692
01:08:06,228 --> 01:08:17,496
Cabral on numerous occasions for some of the events that she mentioned, such as like the pep rally or student risk staff basketball games or other games, as well as on policy making as well.

693
01:08:17,616 --> 01:08:27,023
She has really stepped up and allowed us to give her input when it comes to important things that affect students, such as the homework policy, as well as other policies that we are currently working with her.

694
01:08:32,047 --> 01:08:32,427
Thank you.

695
01:08:32,748 --> 01:08:35,950
You two are involved in everything, just like some of our students that stood up.

696
01:08:36,030 --> 01:08:37,851
So we appreciate all your involvement.

697
01:08:39,412 --> 01:08:41,234
And we do have somebody, one person.

698
01:08:41,734 --> 01:08:44,296
Chris, if you could just name your name and address for the record, please.

699
01:08:44,316 --> 01:08:46,318
I'm gonna unmute you right now.

700
01:08:46,338 --> 01:08:54,604
Hello?

701
01:08:55,784 --> 01:08:56,925
Yes, name and address for the record.

702
01:08:56,945 --> 01:09:00,288
My name is Christine Bennett.

703
01:09:01,645 --> 01:09:03,206
from 19 Martin Street in Medford.

704
01:09:03,987 --> 01:09:05,268
I just had one quick question.

705
01:09:05,468 --> 01:09:08,711
I'm hearing about this program that will begin at Metro High that we're aiming for.

706
01:09:09,391 --> 01:09:11,073
Would that be in place of Curtis Tufts?

707
01:09:14,195 --> 01:09:16,157
The one we just took a vote on would not.

708
01:09:16,597 --> 01:09:17,638
Okay, thank you.

709
01:09:17,658 --> 01:09:20,200
You're welcome.

710
01:09:21,041 --> 01:09:25,205
Thank you to both of our principals for being here tonight for the presentation.

711
01:09:25,225 --> 01:09:27,887
If there's no further questions, we'll move on.

712
01:09:34,355 --> 01:09:36,038
I'm to read number six and seven.

713
01:09:36,078 --> 01:09:39,483
We have the budget update by Mr. Jerry McHugh, director of finance.

714
01:09:41,246 --> 01:09:41,787
Number five.

715
01:09:43,169 --> 01:09:43,710
Oh, okay.

716
01:09:44,171 --> 01:09:44,952
Mr. Fallon spoke.

717
01:09:46,473 --> 01:10:07,444
method career technical education cte update mr chad fallon principal director of medical vocational technical high school and dr peter cushing assistant superintendent my apologies mayor can i can i just interrupt member graham um just so that um the committee knows why um these folks are here um as we have been planning

718
01:10:08,864 --> 01:10:24,352
For the MSBA work, one of the things that we have to do because we have such a huge vocational school is some documentation around what programs we have, how big they are, and how big we want to be as we look forward to a new building of some kind.

719
01:10:25,127 --> 01:10:38,691
And the other thing that this form asks us to do is lay out, if you need space for programs that don't exist today, what are those and how much enrollment are you anticipating in these programs that are yet to exist?

720
01:10:39,311 --> 01:10:44,852
And MSBA goes on to describe a set of requirements around what constitutes something they will aim.

721
01:10:45,333 --> 01:10:49,414
So Mr. Fallon and Dr. Cushing have been working hard to articulate that.

722
01:10:50,174 --> 01:10:53,695
My hope is that when they are done, we will take a vote here to,

723
01:10:54,515 --> 01:11:13,347
direct them to continue to explore these things because that will be needed to the MSBA with our Chapter 70 or viability plan documentation so that they can sort of consider all of this as part of our sort of input to what ultimately will become a feasibility study.

724
01:11:13,387 --> 01:11:15,608
So I will turn it over to Dr. Cushing.

725
01:11:15,628 --> 01:11:18,590
I just wanted to set that sort of groundwork for everybody else.

726
01:11:19,045 --> 01:11:19,605
Thank you, yes.

727
01:11:20,186 --> 01:11:21,907
Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

728
01:11:21,987 --> 01:11:40,702
First, I want to thank Mr. Fallon and all the CTE teachers for the amazing work that they do every day, giving our kids real world experiences and the work that Mr. Fallon and staff have done over the last several years to really bolster and expand the programs in an amazing manner up to this point.

729
01:11:41,143 --> 01:11:44,966
So we'll share our presentation and then just jump right in.

730
01:11:48,663 --> 01:11:52,826
So DESE approves Chapter 74 programs.

731
01:11:53,546 --> 01:12:03,073
Right now, Medford High School has 15 of them, and we've seen an increase in demand and enrollment with several programs requiring a wait list.

732
01:12:03,453 --> 01:12:07,115
Mr. Fallon mentioned, how many students are on a wait list right now?

733
01:12:07,615 --> 01:12:08,636
47 students, right?

734
01:12:09,076 --> 01:12:15,981
We are not accepting students from outside of Medford anymore, which I think is really something that the citizens of Medford should know.

735
01:12:17,802 --> 01:12:30,098
More than 50% of MHS students are selecting a CTE pathway and a new master schedule will hopefully align academic and vocational technical opportunities as we move forward.

736
01:12:33,203 --> 01:12:34,264
You want to talk about survey demand?

737
01:12:37,121 --> 01:12:43,867
So as part of the documents we have to provide to MSBA, they wanna see what our waitlist data looks like for the last three or four years.

738
01:12:43,907 --> 01:12:56,038
So this just gives a snapshot and I highlighted in bold of the programs that every year we do see students on a list that most likely never make it in because in order to come off a waitlist, somebody has to leave and that doesn't typically happen.

739
01:12:56,638 --> 01:13:10,913
So, you know, in our research with looking past in past years and also what industry trends are telling us auto technology cosmetology electrical and health assisting our areas that we would want to seek expansion and in our new building as we reimagine.

740
01:13:13,647 --> 01:13:26,811
This next slide shows some data of students participating in CTE, so beginning in 21-22, we had just about 195 students in Exploratory, we placed 163, and it had a wait list of 14.

741
01:13:27,251 --> 01:13:41,115
So you can see between 21 and 22 in this current year, the wait list is at or about the same, a little bit less than last year, but there was also other pathways that could have taken this year with the expansion of our arts electives.

742
01:13:41,715 --> 01:13:44,116
So this year we had 72 choose a high school path.

743
01:13:45,236 --> 01:14:01,443
So when we surveyed the Andrews and the McGlynn Middle School, we provided some context in a survey, which was a brief presentation from myself explaining about the survey, and then we provided the programs we currently have, and then we gave them some ideas of programs we're thinking about.

744
01:14:02,043 --> 01:14:05,664
Criminal Justice and Protective Services, we had about 83% of the students.

745
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:09,266
By the way, this was based on 344 student responses.

746
01:14:09,386 --> 01:14:10,306
As of today, though, there was 357.

747
01:14:10,526 --> 01:14:15,788
So I think the little guys and gals are still hacking away at the survey, which is pretty funny.

748
01:14:15,828 --> 01:14:17,088
Wait till you see some of the results.

749
01:14:17,668 --> 01:14:19,049
Who knew they want sewing?

750
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:23,092
More than five people want sewing, we'll get to that.

751
01:14:24,292 --> 01:14:25,633
We also looked at dental assistance.

752
01:14:25,693 --> 01:14:31,197
This one, we had about half of them that thought that this would be something cool to have a dental assisting program.

753
01:14:31,518 --> 01:14:38,943
We're also looking at things that other vocational schools in the state have had success with, so we're also taking that into consideration.

754
01:14:40,564 --> 01:14:44,047
Criminal justice, we talked about IT and networking.

755
01:14:44,107 --> 01:14:46,388
We had close to 86%, is that 86?

756
01:14:49,771 --> 01:14:59,018
And then plumbers 66.9 was for it plumbing I had less than I thought.

757
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:05,743
The vet science program yielded about 63% of students thought that that would be cool.

758
01:15:05,803 --> 01:15:12,128
And these are just some of the survey responses when I said, well, is there something that you have in mind that you would like us to think about?

759
01:15:12,748 --> 01:15:14,109
And a lot of these were repetitive.

760
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:19,013
Meteorology, I thought that was cool, but sewing, that came up a lot.

761
01:15:19,033 --> 01:15:22,235
So it reminded me of kind of that need for that home economics.

762
01:15:22,895 --> 01:15:24,837
So those are some of the survey results we used from that.

763
01:15:27,907 --> 01:15:29,727
So some proposed new programs.

764
01:15:30,608 --> 01:15:36,289
When we're considering proposing new programs for the CT, there are multiple factors to take into consideration.

765
01:15:37,109 --> 01:15:43,090
One is the survey data you just saw, but then we also wanna look at what the workforce is telling us, all right?

766
01:15:43,671 --> 01:15:46,711
And what are the types of jobs that are being posted?

767
01:15:47,271 --> 01:15:53,813
And so when we talk about criminal justice to open up, you can see the number of jobs that are there, but there are also jobs that,

768
01:15:54,713 --> 01:16:02,457
A criminal justice path may lead to such as being an attorney, working in the courthouse, anything within the criminal justice realm.

769
01:16:02,957 --> 01:16:15,264
But you can see the typical entry level education correlating across the table for security guards, detective and criminal investigators, police officers, EMTs, so on and so forth down through firefighters.

770
01:16:16,124 --> 01:16:31,211
This type of program would not really require much for the school to start up, other than a classroom and perhaps, you know, not perhaps but a specific dedicated teacher to work with students in this, whereas dental assisting.

771
01:16:33,156 --> 01:16:44,042
for demand, looks at 525 unique job opportunities within our catchment area, with 70% of those for dental assistance.

772
01:16:44,662 --> 01:16:51,526
And you can see in our catchment area where those jobs are posted in relation to Medford.

773
01:16:55,345 --> 01:16:57,528
IT networking, a unique 1,482 jobs.

774
01:16:57,568 --> 01:17:03,136
All right, computer user support specialist for 1,389 and network, computer network support specialist for 93.

775
01:17:10,683 --> 01:17:16,270
plumbing and HVAC, a total of 191 unique job postings for plumbers, pipefitters and seamfitters.

776
01:17:16,811 --> 01:17:29,706
This data definitely surprised Mr. Fallon and myself because plumbing has been one of those shops when you look at Medford High School right now, where we have CCL, electrical, automotive, carpentry, this is a more traditional

777
01:17:30,667 --> 01:17:35,272
C. T. E. Path shop that we thought would have more interest in more support.

778
01:17:35,953 --> 01:17:40,918
But we definitely think it is still something for the committee and for Medford to consider as we move forward.

779
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:55,448
And veterinary science, a total of 266 unique job openings for veterinary technologists and technicians, and veterinary assistants, laboratory animals, caretakers with 73% of that category.

780
01:17:55,948 --> 01:18:03,313
This is the type of track that could lead students to becoming not only vet techs, vet assistants, but being veterinary doctors themselves.

781
01:18:08,097 --> 01:18:12,800
Peter and I like to joke with Maurice that there'll be cows and horses running around the new Medford campus with our

782
01:18:14,274 --> 01:18:14,994
that tech program.

783
01:18:16,595 --> 01:18:30,002
So when we talk about the four programs we're thinking about expanding, this doesn't mean that we couldn't seek to expand before the new building is in place, but just to give the committee a breakdown, we're looking at seven years of student waitlist data.

784
01:18:30,042 --> 01:18:33,824
We know that there's demand, but there's also costs associated with this.

785
01:18:33,884 --> 01:18:41,448
So as you saw in your packet, we've labeled kind of estimated as best we could, which it comes down to additional teaching staff and some equipment.

786
01:18:42,208 --> 01:18:54,458
You know you're looking at an investment of just under 400,000 to expand these programs, whether it be now or within the new building, but if we take build out and furnishings and the cost of a structure out of it.

787
01:18:55,239 --> 01:18:58,882
This is what we're looking at to expand the current program so the idea tonight was to provide you.

788
01:19:00,467 --> 01:19:03,051
information about the new programs and then the jobs that we're expanding.

789
01:19:03,632 --> 01:19:08,339
The last two slides really just show about the auto tech and cosmetology expansion.

790
01:19:08,359 --> 01:19:10,162
There certainly are jobs in the community.

791
01:19:10,623 --> 01:19:13,827
So this would not be something that was a wasted endeavor.

792
01:19:15,612 --> 01:19:34,858
The last thing to mention is that based on the greater Boston regional blueprint, by the way, all the data that we shared tonight came from the mass hire, which their job is really to scout the area and find out where the highest demand is and then they work with people to help them get jobs or get into job programs, even though healthcare and professional and technical services won't listed weren't listed in one of the

793
01:19:35,818 --> 01:19:39,719
reports, it's important to note that they're still listed as critical to the region.

794
01:19:39,759 --> 01:19:43,521
So we may not have posted about culinary jobs, but it's still something that's very needed.

795
01:19:43,561 --> 01:19:59,306
So I thought it was important to mention tonight that although certain things aren't mentioned in the regional blueprint, which by the way is out of date, it's from 2018, and there's a supplemental piece from 2020, we should just be thinking as we look for new programs, what things are critical to the region, and that's hospitality, construction, finance, et cetera.

796
01:20:00,967 --> 01:20:01,987
Any questions at this point?

797
01:20:05,345 --> 01:20:05,846
Member Graham.

798
01:20:06,667 --> 01:20:07,067
Thank you.

799
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:20,042
In terms of the expansion of auto tech cosmetology, electrical and health assisting, can those expansions happen in the current space or are you space constrained?

800
01:20:20,725 --> 01:20:28,174
Yes, auto tech would require a third teacher, cosmetology would require a third teacher, and electrical would be another teacher.

801
01:20:28,615 --> 01:20:32,279
Electrical, we would need more space.

802
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:34,302
Health assisting, you could do with a third teacher.

803
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:36,424
So at this point, it comes down to teaching staff.

804
01:20:41,484 --> 01:20:44,886
None of those are currently budgeted for FY25, is that correct?

805
01:20:45,246 --> 01:20:50,809
We've had an auto tech position, but for the past two years we remove it for many reasons.

806
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:57,793
We can function without three right now, so we usually end up foregoing that position, but it's been talked about for sure.

807
01:20:59,958 --> 01:21:17,135
Okay, in terms of the expansion of those programs, I would love to see a report at some point early next year about sort of a proposal from you all to implement those expansions like over the course of the next

808
01:21:17,856 --> 01:21:20,338
number of years where space is not a constraint.

809
01:21:20,378 --> 01:21:22,559
So obviously electrical would be a sort of a separate issue.

810
01:21:22,579 --> 01:21:28,523
But for the three shops where we could expand, what would you recommend that timeline be?

811
01:21:28,703 --> 01:21:30,264
And do they all go at the same time?

812
01:21:30,304 --> 01:21:31,685
Does one come first or second?

813
01:21:32,445 --> 01:21:36,868
But I would like to see that, you know, it does not have to be now, it does not have to be before the end of the year.

814
01:21:36,908 --> 01:21:46,774
But as we think about like next fall, really having you come to us with a sort of a proposal of like what we should be planning for and expecting in the in the coming years, if that's possible.

815
01:21:47,372 --> 01:21:48,232
very much so, yes.

816
01:21:48,312 --> 01:21:49,433
Okay.

817
01:21:49,533 --> 01:22:03,278
And then I'm gonna make a motion that the school committee request that the MSBA explore the program expansions and new programs outlined in this presentation as part of the feasibility study.

818
01:22:04,559 --> 01:22:04,839
Second.

819
01:22:04,879 --> 01:22:05,559
Did you get all of that?

820
01:22:11,542 --> 01:22:11,862
What's that?

821
01:22:12,408 --> 01:22:18,592
the MSBA explore all the expansion requests in this proposal.

822
01:22:20,573 --> 01:22:23,415
Motion by Member Graham, seconded by Member Reinfeld.

823
01:22:23,495 --> 01:22:24,255
All those in favor?

824
01:22:24,275 --> 01:22:24,955
Aye.

825
01:22:26,096 --> 01:22:26,977
Actually, can we roll call?

826
01:22:27,477 --> 01:22:28,397
Roll call, please.

827
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:33,521
Sorry, quick question.

828
01:22:34,041 --> 01:22:36,802
Member Graham, do you mean MSBA or school building committee?

829
01:22:37,943 --> 01:22:40,845
Sorry, school building committee to feed the MSBA.

830
01:22:41,594 --> 01:22:41,994
application.

831
01:22:42,274 --> 01:22:42,575
Thank you.

832
01:22:43,575 --> 01:22:45,456
MSK School building committee.

833
01:22:45,757 --> 01:22:46,097
Thank you.

834
01:22:46,557 --> 01:22:47,958
Um, number Brandly.

835
01:22:48,118 --> 01:22:48,338
Yes.

836
01:22:49,319 --> 01:22:49,759
Remember, Graham?

837
01:22:49,919 --> 01:22:50,139
Yes.

838
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:51,340
Remember on top?

839
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:51,720
Yes.

840
01:22:52,241 --> 01:22:52,981
Remember all about?

841
01:22:53,041 --> 01:22:53,321
Yes.

842
01:22:53,982 --> 01:22:54,762
Remember rental?

843
01:22:54,882 --> 01:22:55,082
Yes.

844
01:22:55,643 --> 01:22:55,923
Remember?

845
01:22:56,023 --> 01:22:57,043
So yes, Marilyn Goker.

846
01:22:57,244 --> 01:22:57,804
Yes.

847
01:22:57,824 --> 01:22:59,705
70 affirmative zero negative motion passes.

848
01:23:01,406 --> 01:23:02,707
Were you finished with your presentation?

849
01:23:02,727 --> 01:23:03,127
Thank you.

850
01:23:03,147 --> 01:23:03,587
Great job.

851
01:23:03,888 --> 01:23:04,168
Thank you.

852
01:23:14,922 --> 01:23:22,909
We have our budget update, Mr. Jerry McHugh, finance director, estimated start time, right on schedule, about 50 seconds.

853
01:23:22,929 --> 01:23:24,150
I don't know if we should wait.

854
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:28,373
And then right after that, we'll have our budget vote of the Medford School Committee.

855
01:23:28,393 --> 01:23:39,142
And for disclosure, my sister is back to Medford B. She is a teacher at the McGlynn, so I'm gonna abstain from the vote, and I'm gonna ask member Graham to come up and chair the meeting, please.

856
01:23:43,263 --> 01:23:44,504
Are we gonna need a break in the middle?

857
01:23:44,544 --> 01:23:47,465
Do we need to take our two-minute break now?

858
01:23:48,505 --> 01:23:51,086
If you want a motion to recess for five minutes, that's fine.

859
01:23:51,106 --> 01:23:57,029
I think- Motion to recess for five minutes by Member Reintel, seconded by Member Bramley.

860
01:23:57,089 --> 01:23:57,829
All those in favor?

861
01:23:57,849 --> 01:23:58,410
Aye.

862
01:23:58,530 --> 01:23:59,250
All those opposed?

863
01:23:59,470 --> 01:24:00,491
We are in recess until 6.35.

864
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:30,097
So just so that everyone knows, thank you all for being here.

865
01:24:30,117 --> 01:24:34,161
I know it's very hot in here and that's not on purpose, I promise.

866
01:24:35,182 --> 01:24:38,324
But I'm afraid to consider opening the windows because I don't think that'll work.

867
01:24:38,745 --> 01:24:43,089
So hopefully we can just bear with the heat.

868
01:24:43,329 --> 01:24:47,333
Item number six is a budget update from Mr. Jerry McHugh, our Director of Finance.

869
01:24:47,873 --> 01:24:49,795
He's gonna provide his presentation.

870
01:24:49,815 --> 01:24:52,878
I'm gonna let the committee ask some questions.

871
01:24:53,819 --> 01:25:02,849
And get their questions answered and then we will be happy to take public comment from all of you I assume many of you are here to speak, just to set your expectations.

872
01:25:03,230 --> 01:25:10,017
We do ask that folks speaking at public comment limit their comments to three minutes and one time.

873
01:25:10,038 --> 01:25:12,460
So please bear with us.

874
01:25:14,462 --> 01:25:25,268
please feel free to speak from the heart or wherever it is that you need to speak from, but also just remember to do it briefly so that we can all have a chance to speak.

875
01:25:25,949 --> 01:25:33,393
So, Mr. McHugh, it's all yours.

876
01:25:33,613 --> 01:25:34,154
Good evening.

877
01:25:34,814 --> 01:25:39,377
Tonight, I wanted to just give a brief follow-up.

878
01:25:39,477 --> 01:25:40,297
We had a lot of

879
01:25:42,201 --> 01:25:44,623
comments and suggestions at the public hearing.

880
01:25:47,085 --> 01:25:52,030
Some of those comments I'd like to address tonight.

881
01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:58,035
And of course at the end we'll have time to answer any other questions that you might have.

882
01:26:00,337 --> 01:26:02,118
So just to reiterate,

883
01:26:03,638 --> 01:26:15,910
We did have, we had, this is an extremely difficult budget, and at the public hearing, we talked about just a lot of needs to get this.

884
01:26:16,050 --> 01:26:23,617
I like to use the metaphor of a, you know, a house where,

885
01:26:24,642 --> 01:26:35,435
We want to do some renovations, we'd like to add on, create a family room, but this is a year that we have to fix the foundation because the foundation is cracking.

886
01:26:35,916 --> 01:26:38,980
We don't want it to crumble for the future.

887
01:26:40,061 --> 01:26:53,413
So we did propose reductions in our administrative assistant ranks and our administrators to try to gain some efficiencies in administration to achieve some budget savings.

888
01:26:53,974 --> 01:27:01,141
We have had three administrative assistants take advantage of early retirement incentive.

889
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:13,675
and we'll be working with their union representatives to see how we can best meet the needs of the membership with these reductions.

890
01:27:14,375 --> 01:27:19,037
We also looked at class size and looked at scheduling.

891
01:27:20,818 --> 01:27:29,941
We had to propose a net reduction of five teachers at the elementary level, one at the middle grades, and six at the high school.

892
01:27:33,667 --> 01:27:41,969
And then there was this notion brought up at the public hearing that, you know, what's going on with performing arts?

893
01:27:42,649 --> 01:27:53,032
You know, I've been on email chains and several members of the community are very concerned about, you know, we're trying to eliminate the band.

894
01:27:54,312 --> 01:27:59,695
or the color guide, are we eliminating drama programs?

895
01:28:00,376 --> 01:28:07,920
One email suggested that we were trying to eliminate all the performing arts programs, and that certainly is not the case.

896
01:28:08,641 --> 01:28:17,246
The budget does provide for over $1.7 million for performing arts and fine arts programs.

897
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:26,864
What we did propose was to return the management of that program to one coordinator.

898
01:28:27,924 --> 01:28:36,468
It had recently expanded to two coordinators, but in light of our budget situation, we brought that back to one.

899
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:42,551
And then we did discuss this theater teacher position that had a,

900
01:28:45,122 --> 01:29:01,436
resignation, actually there were two teachers in this position over the course of the year, and the students weren't really selecting the courses that that position was teaching.

901
01:29:03,782 --> 01:29:18,273
So that's it, everything else in this program is funded, and that includes the marching band stipends, the guard stipends, drama programs are fully funded.

902
01:29:19,994 --> 01:29:27,920
We will seek to offer certain theater sections within the teaching assignment of an existing teacher.

903
01:29:29,763 --> 01:29:31,864
that would better align with student interests.

904
01:29:32,585 --> 01:29:46,452
And you could see with the exception of the theater teacher, all the current teachers funded in the performing and visual arts programs are funded in FY25.

905
01:29:52,414 --> 01:29:56,276
The other, another concern was with our health services program.

906
01:29:56,776 --> 01:29:59,537
You know, how did we come up with these recommended cuts?

907
01:30:02,158 --> 01:30:08,560
We looked at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health recommended cuts.

908
01:30:10,348 --> 01:30:15,270
teaches nurses per student, which is between 250 and 500 students.

909
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:31,277
The National School Nurses Association recommends one nurse for every 750 students, but we're really focused on the Mass Department of Public Health for our criteria.

910
01:30:34,887 --> 01:30:39,010
So currently, we have 15.6 teachers.

911
01:30:39,811 --> 01:30:45,196
I went back and I looked at the FY 2019-2020 budget, which was the budget before COVID.

912
01:30:51,841 --> 01:31:00,423
And at that point in time, we had 12.6 nurses for roughly the same total enrollment.

913
01:31:01,683 --> 01:31:09,405
Of course, it makes complete sense that we wanted to expand these ranks during COVID and return to school protocols.

914
01:31:11,245 --> 01:31:14,766
But you can see that we are, you know,

915
01:31:16,001 --> 01:31:21,964
in decent shape in terms of per-student staffing in FY24.

916
01:31:22,645 --> 01:31:26,887
And across the board, we have one nurse for every 268 students.

917
01:31:26,907 --> 01:31:31,369
So in FY25, with the reductions that we proposed, in FY25,

918
01:31:37,527 --> 01:31:44,954
We still achieve a cross-board staffing of 361 nurses per student.

919
01:31:46,616 --> 01:31:47,877
We will have a staff of 11.6.

920
01:31:51,941 --> 01:31:58,748
Myself, I'm a little bit concerned about the Brooks that's on the high end, but I believe that the,

921
01:32:01,045 --> 01:32:07,970
the incoming director can recommend staffing adjustments to kind of even that out.

922
01:32:09,011 --> 01:32:13,455
But that's essentially how we arrived at those reductions.

923
01:32:15,636 --> 01:32:20,520
And the next area was guidance counselors.

924
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:28,486
Very similar to the nurses, we looked at recommended staffing levels.

925
01:32:33,443 --> 01:32:35,984
students per guidance counselor is recommended.

926
01:32:37,884 --> 01:33:00,629
DESE published a study in 2019 to take a look at how we were doing against those averages, and on average in Massachusetts, there were 404 students per guidance counselor, and then the national average was between 600 and almost 800 for middle school, and then 200 to 243 for high school.

927
01:33:04,811 --> 01:33:23,065
So in FY24, we had two counselors at each of the middle schools, and then we had, slide please, and then we had six counselors at the high school.

928
01:33:24,826 --> 01:33:31,671
So we had a very, our staffing was even,

929
01:33:33,489 --> 01:33:35,131
better than the recommended average.

930
01:33:38,475 --> 01:33:50,188
And then in FY25, with those reductions, we will have a higher average at the two middle schools, and we kind of maintain our staffing level at the high school.

931
01:33:51,568 --> 01:34:00,993
So even with those reductions, there's on average is one guidance counselor per 258 students.

932
01:34:07,110 --> 01:34:33,306
And then kind of another comment was, you know, are we, these nurses and guidance counselors are important in social emotional learning programs, and that is absolutely true, but we have a number of other staff that support students' social emotional well-being.

933
01:34:33,386 --> 01:34:34,907
We have adjustment counselors,

934
01:34:37,333 --> 01:34:44,036
BCBAs, and Nexus specialists, and those all are fully funded in FY25.

935
01:34:45,516 --> 01:34:53,960
And just to take a look at the staffing loads for the Adjustment Council, as you see that, you know, they are pretty reasonable.

936
01:34:57,201 --> 01:34:58,262
On average, we have

937
01:35:00,429 --> 01:35:03,053
246 students per adjustment counselor.

938
01:35:04,816 --> 01:35:06,979
So we feel pretty good about that staffing.

939
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:15,232
And to address SEL priorities next year.

940
01:35:17,956 --> 01:35:24,820
We did talk about at the public hearing the possibility that our Chapter 70 state aid would increase from $135,000 over FY24 to $470,000.

941
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:28,962
There was an initiative in the House budget which raised the minimum student aid from $30 per student to $104,000.

942
01:35:41,921 --> 01:35:52,669
The good news is that this $104 per student was included in the Senate Ways and Means budget, and that budget is currently being debated in the Senate.

943
01:35:53,370 --> 01:36:02,036
So while there's no absolute guarantee that we'll get that money until the governor signs the budget, it is a good thing.

944
01:36:03,718 --> 01:36:08,122
very good news that both the House and the Senate are recommending the same number.

945
01:36:08,182 --> 01:36:14,348
So when they go to conference committee to work out the differences, there will be no difference in this line item.

946
01:36:18,391 --> 01:36:25,158
So just to kind of recap where we left off, our current budget is $71.2 million.

947
01:36:29,073 --> 01:36:32,114
We went through and we talked about the need.

948
01:36:32,194 --> 01:36:41,397
We have collective bargaining agreements and other school staff that are in line for salary increases.

949
01:36:41,457 --> 01:36:48,859
Some of these collective bargaining agreements are already agreed to, so they're binding obligation of the school department.

950
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:56,062
Approximately $4 million of this $8.2 million budget increase is

951
01:36:57,222 --> 01:36:59,305
strictly to salary increases.

952
01:37:00,847 --> 01:37:11,679
And then we identified three other areas that make up the other half of that increase, which include a number of accounts that have been historically underfunded.

953
01:37:14,318 --> 01:37:24,205
A number of positions that are currently funded on ESSA that really need to be in the general fund next year because they represent core programming.

954
01:37:26,107 --> 01:37:29,289
And then some new spending initiatives.

955
01:37:31,010 --> 01:37:40,418
special ed tuition is going up, a Chromebook and tablet refresh was $477,000 and other

956
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:51,826
increases as well, which would mean that we would need a budget of $79.4 million to meet all those needs.

957
01:37:51,846 --> 01:37:52,287
We felt like that was

958
01:38:01,475 --> 01:38:05,378
unrealistic ask to make to the city.

959
01:38:06,419 --> 01:38:18,708
And we developed a plan to identify savings, which got our budget, which totaled just under $2.3 million.

960
01:38:19,789 --> 01:38:24,192
And we identified some new funding.

961
01:38:25,433 --> 01:38:28,515
We have an initiative that we would

962
01:38:30,458 --> 01:38:42,630
charge back programs that charge fees in our school system to recoup some administrative and facilities costs involved in supporting those programs.

963
01:38:43,411 --> 01:38:52,400
We identified $200,000 in revolving funds in addition to what's already being charged to revolving funds to

964
01:38:54,002 --> 01:38:59,525
to also supplement the budget and came in at the public hearing with a budget of $76,684,000.

965
01:38:59,645 --> 01:39:12,513
So I'm happy to answer any questions about this presentation or anything else that you might wanna talk about from the public hearing.

966
01:39:25,592 --> 01:39:26,472
Questions from the committee?

967
01:39:26,492 --> 01:39:28,833
Member Rousseau?

968
01:39:30,094 --> 01:39:30,534
Thank you.

969
01:39:30,554 --> 01:39:33,435
I greatly appreciate the presentation.

970
01:39:34,076 --> 01:39:36,217
The additional clarity is always welcome.

971
01:39:36,957 --> 01:39:45,480
As I said in the last meeting, I am deeply grateful that you have removed some of the

972
01:39:48,907 --> 01:39:57,130
removed the veil of solvency that we have lived with in Medford for a generation or more.

973
01:39:58,531 --> 01:40:12,056
When we have an expense of $2 million, we have a line item of $200,000 to pay for it, and we pay the $2 million, it is reasonable for the public to conclude that we didn't need that money.

974
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:17,438
But we got that other $1.8 million by scraping it out of this leftover grant for,

975
01:40:18,624 --> 01:40:38,273
You know, reading or whatever we you know we scraped it up from all of these other places, and so that when you look at our budget, you think we spent $200,000 on an item that actually costs $2 million, and that is the opposite of transparency in any and every sense of the word, no matter what you think transparency means.

976
01:40:38,833 --> 01:40:42,776
And believe me, everyone in this room has a different definition of transparency.

977
01:40:43,276 --> 01:40:52,022
We all do agree probably that if something costs $2 million, we will tell you it costs $2 million, and we'll put a $2 million item in the budget to pay for it.

978
01:40:52,823 --> 01:41:00,328
And that has not existed in Medford public schools for as long as I've been here for seven and a half years and my understanding is for long before that.

979
01:41:01,929 --> 01:41:09,335
And it's an incredible disservice to the community to continue thinking that something that costs $2 million is only going to cost us $200,000.

980
01:41:09,615 --> 01:41:16,561
And that is the, you know, as horrible as this budget is that is.

981
01:41:19,307 --> 01:41:32,530
frankly, I can never thank you enough for that, because it is something for my seven and a half years I have been asking for, and it has not been something that I've been able to get.

982
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:45,513
So in light of that, and in light of the fact, you did say one other thing that, you mentioned whether it was a reasonable request, the $79 million, and we can,

983
01:41:49,905 --> 01:41:51,306
Your job is your job.

984
01:41:52,046 --> 01:41:57,527
But in my opinion, the request is the school committee's request and we sort of decide what's reasonable.

985
01:41:58,828 --> 01:42:03,229
And, you know, in light of that, I'm going to make a motion.

986
01:42:03,249 --> 01:42:19,074
The school committee budget request in the amount of $79,399,704 for the responsible operations of the Medford Public Schools in 2024-25 be submitted in writing to the Medford City Council and the Mayor of Medford within force of this motion.

987
01:42:25,032 --> 01:42:34,958
Thank you, Mr so before we continue talking about Mr so his motion is on the floor if there is a second it can stay on the floor.

988
01:42:35,599 --> 01:42:36,499
Second, thank you.

989
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:41,662
But we're not going to take a vote on that until we have heard the questions of the rest of the committee.

990
01:42:41,682 --> 01:42:44,604
And we have heard from all of you so.

991
01:42:45,905 --> 01:42:51,249
Everyone can just take a breath, exhale, we're going to get to all of you before we get to any sort of voting.

992
01:42:52,249 --> 01:42:57,373
Mr. Russo, can you please sort of explain those numbers one more time just so that everybody understands what you just said.

993
01:42:58,214 --> 01:43:01,017
Certainly, I'll read the language and then explain it.

994
01:43:02,358 --> 01:43:04,260
Zoom keeps coming.

995
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:08,524
The Medford School Committee budget request in the amount of $79,399,774 for the responsible operations of the Medford Public Schools in 2024-2025

996
01:43:16,712 --> 01:43:21,616
be submitted in writing to the Medford City Council and the mayor of Medford within 48 hours of this motion.

997
01:43:21,796 --> 01:43:26,259
So that is the number that was calculated and displayed at the last meeting.

998
01:43:26,719 --> 01:43:28,801
It is the number that was on one of these slides.

999
01:43:29,161 --> 01:43:36,767
And I do have a spreadsheet that I've shared with Dr. Cushing, if he could put it up, which actually explains that.

1000
01:43:40,049 --> 01:43:40,529
Did you get it?

1001
01:43:42,691 --> 01:43:44,212
That's because my Zoom is in and out.

1002
01:43:44,352 --> 01:43:45,133
Sorry, one second.

1003
01:43:46,902 --> 01:43:50,104
So before we take any vote, we'll make sure that we can look at that spreadsheet.

1004
01:43:50,124 --> 01:43:51,345
So take your time, Dr. Cushing.

1005
01:43:52,766 --> 01:43:54,787
Are there questions from the rest of the committee?

1006
01:43:56,088 --> 01:44:02,212
Member Brantley.

1007
01:44:02,253 --> 01:44:03,053
My voice is so loud.

1008
01:44:04,654 --> 01:44:07,496
Can we specify the elementary positions by building that are being cut?

1009
01:44:09,858 --> 01:44:10,038
Yes.

1010
01:44:37,383 --> 01:44:48,189
Um, two at McGlynn Elementary, five at Missituck, one at Roberts.

1011
01:44:50,430 --> 01:45:04,958
Um, two at McGlynn Elementary, five at Missituck, one at Roberts for a total of eight.

1012
01:45:08,738 --> 01:45:27,072
We're adding three teachers, one at McGlynn Elementary for the newcomers program, and two at the Roberts for special education, one classroom teacher, one inclusion for a net production of five.

1013
01:45:35,334 --> 01:45:38,436
I think seeing five at the Missittuck is devastating.

1014
01:45:40,296 --> 01:45:46,359
And as someone who has worked at the Brooks, I know that the staff is short, but can I ask why there are no staff at the Brooks being cut?

1015
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:51,522
Not that I wanna see anybody cut, I'm just curious where the discrepancies are.

1016
01:45:51,942 --> 01:45:55,844
Well, it's based on class size, you know?

1017
01:45:55,944 --> 01:45:59,566
So if the class size at Missittuck was,

1018
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:03,042
low compared to the other schools.

1019
01:46:04,042 --> 01:46:07,525
With the Brooks, I think there's just a switch.

1020
01:46:09,086 --> 01:46:28,080
My memory is maybe the second grade, which happens to be a low cohort in the elementary, that there was one less teacher needed in the second grade, but there was an additional teacher needed in the third grade, so that was a wash.

1021
01:46:30,686 --> 01:46:31,466
Other questions?

1022
01:46:31,486 --> 01:46:33,348
Member Branley, do you want the exact numbers?

1023
01:46:33,408 --> 01:46:35,429
I have the proposal from last week in front of me.

1024
01:46:35,470 --> 01:46:35,910
I have it too.

1025
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:36,270
Okay.

1026
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:37,731
I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page.

1027
01:46:39,833 --> 01:46:48,360
With the reduction of the administrative assistance, are we still suggesting six are being cut even though three are taking the early retirement?

1028
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:48,920
No.

1029
01:46:51,182 --> 01:46:51,983
So there's only three?

1030
01:46:52,003 --> 01:46:54,945
There's only three now, yeah.

1031
01:46:55,466 --> 01:46:57,647
So only three administrative assistants will be cut?

1032
01:46:58,868 --> 01:46:59,269
Not six?

1033
01:47:00,718 --> 01:47:05,981
Correct, well, the positions, three positions are retired.

1034
01:47:06,021 --> 01:47:10,243
I don't like that word, Jerry, we talked about that last week, because three positions are three people at the end of the day.

1035
01:47:10,263 --> 01:47:13,144
Yeah, well, three of those positions have retired.

1036
01:47:15,806 --> 01:47:26,231
And then that leaves, there's three other positions that we would wanna find other work for if we can.

1037
01:47:27,447 --> 01:47:30,592
So is the elementary position at the McGlynn being cut?

1038
01:47:32,354 --> 01:47:32,535
Yes.

1039
01:47:36,753 --> 01:47:40,975
I don't understand how a building secretary is cut.

1040
01:47:41,095 --> 01:47:44,016
If she was six miles away, would she be cut?

1041
01:47:44,216 --> 01:47:49,558
I don't understand how that is an equivalent.

1042
01:47:49,899 --> 01:47:51,499
This one, I cannot wrap my brain around.

1043
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:53,820
I really cannot wrap my brain around this.

1044
01:47:54,501 --> 01:47:57,642
How can you go a whole school without the school secretary?

1045
01:47:58,342 --> 01:47:59,803
I don't understand how this is gonna be possible.

1046
01:48:02,237 --> 01:48:05,960
If someone else is gonna do her job, so does that mean we're paying the other person double?

1047
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:08,482
Where are we saving?

1048
01:48:09,302 --> 01:48:11,344
Because someone else is gonna have to do her whole job.

1049
01:48:12,284 --> 01:48:15,707
It's not, well, someone will pick up the slack.

1050
01:48:15,827 --> 01:48:17,528
This is a whole position.

1051
01:48:17,548 --> 01:48:20,210
Has anybody shadowed a school secretary?

1052
01:48:21,671 --> 01:48:23,732
Superintendent, have you shadowed a school secretary?

1053
01:48:23,752 --> 01:48:27,135
Member Brantley, would you like the superintendent to weigh in here?

1054
01:48:27,155 --> 01:48:28,115
Yeah, that would be great.

1055
01:48:28,195 --> 01:48:28,416
Great.

1056
01:48:29,636 --> 01:48:29,937
Thank you.

1057
01:48:31,458 --> 01:48:37,639
We still have an additional floor position that will be part of the ranks.

1058
01:48:38,499 --> 01:48:46,141
And so that is one of the other positions that we plan on using to support the McGlynn complex.

1059
01:48:51,141 --> 01:48:54,042
If she's there every day, how are we saving money?

1060
01:48:55,382 --> 01:48:56,082
Does she get paid less?

1061
01:48:56,122 --> 01:48:56,862
Is she not in the union?

1062
01:48:57,222 --> 01:48:57,722
What happens?

1063
01:48:58,023 --> 01:48:58,603
I don't understand.

1064
01:48:58,623 --> 01:49:00,383
I really do not understand.

1065
01:49:00,810 --> 01:49:01,931
I don't understand the question.

1066
01:49:01,971 --> 01:49:03,693
Can you restate that question, please?

1067
01:49:03,713 --> 01:49:06,816
We have a floater who needs to be in a building all the time.

1068
01:49:06,836 --> 01:49:09,119
Yes, but they can have saving money.

1069
01:49:12,252 --> 01:49:15,675
That person would be allowed to move to other buildings.

1070
01:49:15,695 --> 01:49:25,483
So case in point, if one of the secretaries were to be absent today, there would be one secretary in the office.

1071
01:49:26,223 --> 01:49:32,408
And then if there was an opportunity to assign a floater there, the floater would be the second person assigned.

1072
01:49:33,229 --> 01:49:35,210
So one of the things that we're

1073
01:49:36,371 --> 01:49:49,357
Still working on is having that photo based out of the complex and as we prepare to negotiate with the administrative assistant.

1074
01:49:51,422 --> 01:50:04,714
In the McGlynn Complex, there is also an additional administrative assistant that falls under the special education umbrella, but is an administrative assistant.

1075
01:50:05,575 --> 01:50:12,380
And so if needed, that individual could be deployed to support the McGlynn Complex.

1076
01:50:14,242 --> 01:50:16,844
Okay, so if you need a floater when someone's absent,

1077
01:50:17,909 --> 01:50:23,810
for one day, why wouldn't we need the position filled for the 180 days?

1078
01:50:23,830 --> 01:50:38,633
I'm sorry, that just seems like such a disservice to the McGlynn Elementary community.

1079
01:50:39,574 --> 01:50:46,235
I just, I think that we're, I really wanna see our district thrive, and I feel like

1080
01:50:48,547 --> 01:50:53,231
We survive every day because I know everybody here is working their butt off.

1081
01:50:54,071 --> 01:51:01,636
And I'm listening, I watched a mom nurse her baby out here who's been at school all day, and another one that has her toddler on the floor.

1082
01:51:01,656 --> 01:51:04,958
These are people who are doing other people's jobs all the time.

1083
01:51:05,699 --> 01:51:07,360
When you work in a school, you're pitching in.

1084
01:51:07,900 --> 01:51:10,202
It's not as easy just to close the door and walk away.

1085
01:51:10,222 --> 01:51:11,643
It's not how it works.

1086
01:51:11,983 --> 01:51:15,965
When you walk in that building, you are a hundred people to a hundred different,

1087
01:51:16,866 --> 01:51:17,688
different avenues.

1088
01:51:18,109 --> 01:51:23,439
And I really, I think that we're giving the McGlynn Elementary such a huge disservice.

1089
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,887
Great, we have a floater, but if Mrs. Hardy's absent at the Brooks and she's at the Brooks,

1090
01:51:28,677 --> 01:51:31,440
then now the McGlynn doesn't have a secretary.

1091
01:51:31,460 --> 01:51:43,051
And why is Mrs. Hardy's position, no offense, Mrs. Hardy, but why is her position for one day so important that she gets covered, but the 180 days of the McGlynn doesn't get covered?

1092
01:51:43,292 --> 01:51:47,736
So if I may be the chair, I appreciate your feedback, Ms.

1093
01:51:47,776 --> 01:51:48,176
Bradley.

1094
01:51:51,153 --> 01:52:15,012
In situations which have happened this past year as well, when both administrative assistants are not available, we still have a fairly significant administrative assistant pool, and we tapped into administrative assistants that are located at the high school campus.

1095
01:52:15,752 --> 01:52:20,634
And they too went down to support schools on an as needed basis.

1096
01:52:21,155 --> 01:52:26,657
It was not something that was temporary, a permanent fix, but on an as needed basis.

1097
01:52:27,138 --> 01:52:35,082
So I agree and I'm not denying and saying that people are not working hard, but at the same time, if there is a problem and we need to redeploy,

1098
01:52:36,202 --> 01:52:46,266
an administrative assistant from the high school, which had nearly 20 individuals located on that one campus.

1099
01:52:47,347 --> 01:52:55,290
We should be able to deploy them so they could go and support one of the other buildings or another department within the district.

1100
01:52:56,031 --> 01:52:59,292
We are one district, we need to work together as one team.

1101
01:52:59,772 --> 01:53:05,935
This is not an easy situation for anyone involved, and I don't want

1102
01:53:06,175 --> 01:53:13,279
or anyone in the audience to think that we're not trying to think this through properly.

1103
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:34,853
We have spoken with one another, we've looked at the numbers, we had to make some tough decisions, but we, in comparison to districts that are of comparable size, we still have a significantly larger administrative assistant pool than Medford Public Schools.

1104
01:53:36,491 --> 01:53:38,592
Okay, well, I guess we remain to be seen.

1105
01:53:40,113 --> 01:53:42,735
Under nursing, four nurses still being cut?

1106
01:53:43,795 --> 01:53:47,658
Yes.

1107
01:53:47,738 --> 01:53:57,084
As a parent whose child needed emergency services at our school, this is such a disservice to every single child, and it's such a disservice to these nurses who are working.

1108
01:53:58,083 --> 01:54:05,587
overtime, some in my own family, you know, some from my own family, they helped save my daughter's life one day.

1109
01:54:05,987 --> 01:54:13,971
So to think that we could go for less, or we could go one less assistant, it's such a disservice to our school.

1110
01:54:14,071 --> 01:54:15,512
We are barely surviving.

1111
01:54:16,072 --> 01:54:23,416
And this is really devastating, in my opinion, that this is gonna happen, that we've got to this point.

1112
01:54:26,005 --> 01:54:28,947
I'm concerned about the Brooks, the staffing there.

1113
01:54:29,047 --> 01:54:33,511
You said, you know, you're concerned about the Brooks with the health services?

1114
01:54:35,612 --> 01:54:44,539
Well, I said that that per student enrollment was higher than the rest of the district.

1115
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:46,601
So we would wanna look at that.

1116
01:54:47,281 --> 01:54:50,704
And, you know, I wish I didn't have to,

1117
01:54:52,003 --> 01:54:53,743
prepare a plan that included cuts.

1118
01:54:53,964 --> 01:54:56,764
I mean, everybody wants the cut position.

1119
01:54:56,784 --> 01:55:03,246
But it's a lot of difficult choices.

1120
01:55:03,646 --> 01:55:05,887
So we are going to be hiring an incoming director.

1121
01:55:06,327 --> 01:55:07,927
Someone's going to take Avery Hines' place.

1122
01:55:08,207 --> 01:55:08,427
Yes.

1123
01:55:08,948 --> 01:55:10,468
So that position is going to be filled.

1124
01:55:10,808 --> 01:55:13,649
That's already been posted for how long now?

1125
01:55:14,710 --> 01:55:29,875
The position has been posted since February, when the director, previous director went to the Department of Public Health, and I have one applicant who has applied and that applicant is.

1126
01:55:31,075 --> 01:55:32,595
a part of Metro Public Schools.

1127
01:55:33,235 --> 01:55:48,398
We have an interview scheduled for next week to interview the one candidate who has applied, and we will include members of the nursing team who expressed interest at the time of Ms.

1128
01:55:48,438 --> 01:55:49,538
Hines' departure.

1129
01:55:50,138 --> 01:55:55,459
So the nursing director position still exists.

1130
01:55:55,639 --> 01:55:59,120
It's part of the administrative unit, and that position will be filled

1131
01:56:00,474 --> 01:56:28,442
And the comment that you were making earlier, I heard that Medford High School will still have 3.0 nurses, and that the McGlynn Complex will have three nurses at the McGlynn, but the FTE is equal to 2.6 FTE, but it's three individuals assigned to the McGlynn Complex, and three also assigned to the Medford High School Complex.

1132
01:56:29,541 --> 01:56:30,842
How many are assigned to the high school now?

1133
01:56:30,862 --> 01:56:31,762
Three.

1134
01:56:32,602 --> 01:56:33,323
So that won't change?

1135
01:56:33,343 --> 01:56:35,043
That will not change.

1136
01:56:35,263 --> 01:56:35,544
Okay.

1137
01:56:36,544 --> 01:56:42,446
For guidance, I believe last week we discussed, or two weeks ago, we discussed that they also teach a class.

1138
01:56:43,767 --> 01:56:47,028
So if we're cutting them by half, who's teaching the class?

1139
01:56:49,750 --> 01:56:50,650
The remaining staff.

1140
01:56:50,670 --> 01:56:57,433
Do you want me to repeat that?

1141
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:06,689
So the guidance counselors at the middle school, I believe last week we talked about, or two weeks ago, I'm sorry, that we talked about that they also teach classes.

1142
01:57:08,071 --> 01:57:13,136
So I'm curious, who's gonna teach those classes now that there's one less person?

1143
01:57:13,817 --> 01:57:18,783
How are we managing them to teach the class plus service the students?

1144
01:57:20,703 --> 01:57:23,865
Well, that's a scheduling issue for the principal.

1145
01:57:24,025 --> 01:57:29,769
And so, you know, there still be one counselor assigned to each school.

1146
01:57:30,609 --> 01:57:35,853
So one counselor, and how many students are at the middle schools?

1147
01:57:35,953 --> 01:57:39,555
Projected for next year, I think it's 440 for the Glenn Middle and 442 for Andrews.

1148
01:57:39,575 --> 01:57:39,955
So in 180 days,

1149
01:57:47,672 --> 01:57:51,334
they are gonna service 440 students plus teach classes.

1150
01:57:53,235 --> 01:58:00,200
And then at the Andrews, one person is gonna take care of 442 students plus teach classes to 442 students?

1151
01:58:04,885 --> 01:58:05,765
I'm just trying to figure out the math.

1152
01:58:05,805 --> 01:58:07,165
I'm not too good at division in my head.

1153
01:58:07,185 --> 01:58:10,966
I'm not suggesting that everything is gonna happen exactly the same next year.

1154
01:58:11,006 --> 01:58:11,846
It's not gonna happen.

1155
01:58:11,886 --> 01:58:12,507
This is what I'm afraid of.

1156
01:58:12,527 --> 01:58:13,487
We're gonna have different staff.

1157
01:58:13,807 --> 01:58:15,707
I'm afraid it's not gonna happen, and this is what scares me.

1158
01:58:16,207 --> 01:58:17,127
This is what scares me.

1159
01:58:17,988 --> 01:58:18,588
Superintendent?

1160
01:58:18,868 --> 01:58:29,030
Yes, Member Bramley, in addition to the positions that were stated in Mr. McHugh's presentation, we do carry

1161
01:58:30,771 --> 01:58:41,540
17 FTEs as adjustment counselors, we do have BCBAs, we do have Nexus specialists, we don't even have school psychologists listed.

1162
01:58:42,101 --> 01:58:51,269
So under the leadership of Stacey Shulman, our Director of Behavioral Health and School Counseling, there are approximately 45

1163
01:58:54,110 --> 01:59:00,832
individuals, it could even be as high as 48 right now, that provide counseling supports to students.

1164
01:59:01,333 --> 01:59:08,495
So if it's not in the person of an adjustment counselor, it may be a guidance counselor, it could be a school psychologist.

1165
01:59:09,675 --> 01:59:17,558
We, as a district, actually have a very robust offering in terms of cell supports for our students.

1166
01:59:18,338 --> 01:59:21,219
So I know that there is a cut that was

1167
01:59:23,940 --> 01:59:25,121
slated to take place.

1168
01:59:25,961 --> 01:59:41,893
And if you look really closely at the numbers, we truly tried our best to stay away from the teaching core and not impact the teaching core because the teaching core is the closest to the students.

1169
01:59:42,533 --> 01:59:47,476
So I just want to say for the record that although there is one cut that has been identified,

1170
01:59:49,858 --> 01:59:53,420
we still have the other support services that are in place.

1171
01:59:54,240 --> 02:00:04,545
And through grant writing, we actually still have partnerships with outside agencies that are supporting some of our school programs as well.

1172
02:00:05,405 --> 02:00:07,026
Do adjustment counselors teach classes?

1173
02:00:09,287 --> 02:00:09,688
No, right?

1174
02:00:09,708 --> 02:00:11,268
No.

1175
02:00:11,308 --> 02:00:15,250
Okay, and then do you need to have an IEP to see an adjustment counselor?

1176
02:00:22,655 --> 02:00:23,996
Yep.

1177
02:00:24,196 --> 02:00:25,576
Adjustment counselor.

1178
02:00:25,716 --> 02:00:26,656
I think Ms.

1179
02:00:26,717 --> 02:00:27,697
Bowen is saying no.

1180
02:00:28,137 --> 02:00:29,538
You do not need to have an IEP.

1181
02:00:32,899 --> 02:00:34,039
What about a school psychologist?

1182
02:00:36,420 --> 02:00:37,701
Okay, I'm just asking.

1183
02:00:37,881 --> 02:00:47,504
So the answer, just so that people that are on the phone can understand the questions and answers, the question was, do an IEP just mean an adjustment counselor or school psychologist?

1184
02:00:47,544 --> 02:00:48,625
And the answer to both is no.

1185
02:00:49,165 --> 02:00:49,365
Okay.

1186
02:00:52,319 --> 02:00:55,920
For staffing adjustment councils, you said it was reasonable.

1187
02:00:57,401 --> 02:01:01,402
That's a scary word to me that we're just reasonable.

1188
02:01:03,663 --> 02:01:04,484
I think that's it for me.

1189
02:01:04,664 --> 02:01:05,204
Thank you, Jerry.

1190
02:01:05,244 --> 02:01:06,084
I appreciate your help.

1191
02:01:06,564 --> 02:01:07,605
I appreciate these numbers.

1192
02:01:07,985 --> 02:01:08,565
I don't like them.

1193
02:01:09,366 --> 02:01:11,767
I can't help but be cranky about it because it's devastating.

1194
02:01:12,147 --> 02:01:16,008
Like I said before, there's nothing more I want than to see us thrive, not to survive.

1195
02:01:17,489 --> 02:01:18,549
My children are in this district.

1196
02:01:21,546 --> 02:01:22,646
This is our family.

1197
02:01:22,746 --> 02:01:24,527
To me, this is what community is all about.

1198
02:01:24,807 --> 02:01:26,487
We need to fight for these students.

1199
02:01:26,667 --> 02:01:27,708
We need to fight for these teachers.

1200
02:01:27,728 --> 02:01:33,409
We need to fight for these administrators that are in the building that are on the ground every single day.

1201
02:01:35,250 --> 02:01:37,830
Program directors, I mean, the whole marching band is here.

1202
02:01:38,591 --> 02:01:41,671
It's not just cutting a position, it's cutting the heart of a program.

1203
02:01:41,691 --> 02:01:44,692
I can't agree with that.

1204
02:01:44,712 --> 02:01:46,853
I haven't slept in two weeks.

1205
02:01:52,878 --> 02:01:53,318
Thank you.

1206
02:01:53,798 --> 02:01:54,139
Thank you.

1207
02:01:54,159 --> 02:01:55,539
Thank you, superintendent for your comments.

1208
02:01:55,700 --> 02:01:57,020
I appreciate you answering the questions.

1209
02:01:57,060 --> 02:01:57,421
Thank you.

1210
02:01:58,902 --> 02:01:59,742
Thank you, member Bramley.

1211
02:01:59,882 --> 02:02:00,483
Member Rousseau.

1212
02:02:00,863 --> 02:02:01,243
Thank you.

1213
02:02:01,603 --> 02:02:04,165
I just want to clarify, ask a question.

1214
02:02:04,445 --> 02:02:09,008
So as the finance, technically the finance director right now, right?

1215
02:02:09,088 --> 02:02:09,729
Yes.

1216
02:02:10,129 --> 02:02:11,790
You made none of these decisions, correct?

1217
02:02:12,270 --> 02:02:12,571
Pardon?

1218
02:02:12,691 --> 02:02:14,192
Did you make any of these decisions?

1219
02:02:15,212 --> 02:02:27,767
Well, we, I did as part of a team, you know I came up with some recommendations I mean not, not all the recommendations were accepted, and some, you know, turned out to be non workable but.

1220
02:02:29,518 --> 02:02:40,204
The first task was to figure out how much does it cost to provide a level service budget to Medford Public Schools.

1221
02:02:40,945 --> 02:02:45,667
And then from there, I completely agree with you.

1222
02:02:45,727 --> 02:02:49,670
My job is to present the school committee with a plan.

1223
02:02:50,710 --> 02:02:56,093
I think it's very reasonable to bring up issues where

1224
02:02:57,175 --> 02:03:00,703
Some folks might not think that that plan is working but.

1225
02:03:04,634 --> 02:03:13,882
We were part, it was a group decision, program directors would talk to see if things were workable.

1226
02:03:14,422 --> 02:03:32,476
And again, when you get into those discussions, I mean, nobody, people would prefer to have the exact same staff they had last year because they kind of know what that program is like, but then they, it's up to them to kind of see how they would make it work with less staff.

1227
02:03:34,208 --> 02:03:34,548
Thank you.

1228
02:03:35,189 --> 02:03:44,111
I think that, you know, all of us here have received many emails, and some of us here have discussed disliking.

1229
02:03:44,451 --> 02:03:45,952
Well, we all dislike the cuts.

1230
02:03:46,812 --> 02:03:52,274
I think that, you know, if in fact we do not get more money from the mayor from the city budget.

1231
02:03:53,274 --> 02:03:55,115
This is nowhere near enough cuts.

1232
02:03:55,875 --> 02:04:07,486
And even if we got enough to avoid additional cuts, any additional, if we decide to keep any position, it is a different position that must be cut.

1233
02:04:07,966 --> 02:04:09,387
Well, equivalent amounts of money.

1234
02:04:09,547 --> 02:04:12,870
So I think it's important to remember that.

1235
02:04:14,122 --> 02:04:19,646
And that group of people, just to clarify, Mr. McHugh, did not include school committee members, correct?

1236
02:04:20,006 --> 02:04:20,387
Did not.

1237
02:04:20,707 --> 02:04:21,027
That's right.

1238
02:04:21,448 --> 02:04:42,143
I think that's important because there's, not to be defensive, but as the senior member, which Paulette used to do that, I guess it's on me now, it's really important to note that we're not in the rooms making these decisions, that we hire the superintendent and it is the superintendent's job to present a budget and

1239
02:04:43,924 --> 02:04:49,229
we can vehemently disagree, and we can vote or not vote for the budget.

1240
02:04:50,049 --> 02:05:04,281
In the last budget hearing, I made a statement that in Massachusetts, no school committee has refused to pass a budget, so there was no understanding of what happens on July 1 if we refuse.

1241
02:05:04,841 --> 02:05:06,523
In that intervening two weeks,

1242
02:05:07,647 --> 02:05:10,949
Uxbridge actually did not pass a school budget.

1243
02:05:11,389 --> 02:05:15,311
They are sending out layoff notices to all their staff.

1244
02:05:15,951 --> 02:05:20,254
And the state has said on July 1, they have $0 and will not have a school district.

1245
02:05:22,255 --> 02:05:29,319
So let's really hope for Uxbridge that somebody passes a special law to find a way around this for them.

1246
02:05:30,019 --> 02:05:31,240
I do not envy them.

1247
02:05:31,780 --> 02:05:35,162
But unfortunately, the answer we now have from their

1248
02:05:36,513 --> 02:05:46,799
disaster they're going through, is that if we do not approve any budget on July 1, the Medford Public Schools closes every employee, HR, by the way, included.

1249
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,481
So if you have a question about your benefits, too bad.

1250
02:05:49,501 --> 02:05:52,143
The superintendent, everybody goes home.

1251
02:05:54,301 --> 02:05:56,182
until we figure out how to pass a budget.

1252
02:05:56,662 --> 02:06:10,788
So we are not in a situation where we can grandstand, and I don't mean that in any way, but sometimes, well, I mean, frankly, all of us grandstand at different times, but we can disagree with this all we want.

1253
02:06:10,928 --> 02:06:16,030
But if we do not pass a budget by July 1, there will be no public school system.

1254
02:06:16,551 --> 02:06:18,892
And that's kind of hard to wrap your head around because you're like,

1255
02:06:19,976 --> 02:06:30,225
It's the law there has to be one, but the state just clarified in the last two weeks to Uxbridge that no they're actually, you will have $0 to spend, nobody will get a paycheck.

1256
02:06:30,825 --> 02:06:34,148
There will be no HR person when you have a change in benefits.

1257
02:06:34,748 --> 02:06:38,572
It's kind of a catastrophe catastrophic level of.

1258
02:06:40,035 --> 02:06:42,416
anarchy almost that is hard to comprehend.

1259
02:06:44,878 --> 02:06:50,360
And I'm sort of glad it's not us that's going through it, but we're gonna try and get more money.

1260
02:06:50,540 --> 02:06:59,245
That's what my motion is for, is to do that level service budget so that we have dramatically fewer layoffs.

1261
02:07:01,046 --> 02:07:07,849
But at the end of the day, if that number is how we are given, we either pass a budget that we dislike immensely,

1262
02:07:09,346 --> 02:07:11,387
or there's no map for public schools on July one.

1263
02:07:11,627 --> 02:07:12,868
Those are the two options.

1264
02:07:14,068 --> 02:07:19,771
And so I have a spreadsheet I shared with Dr. Cushing, if he wouldn't mind sharing it.

1265
02:07:22,397 --> 02:07:35,504
And if I can interrupt from the chair, for those of you who may be joining us for the first time, lucky you, because we do this every year and it is five years and counting of being pretty bad.

1266
02:07:36,084 --> 02:07:45,689
So what we have tried to do in the last couple of years is do two things when we are talking about the budget.

1267
02:07:45,870 --> 02:07:47,991
The first is to request

1268
02:07:49,093 --> 02:07:51,642
what we need from the municipal government.

1269
02:07:52,003 --> 02:07:55,535
So that is the motion that Member Rousseau put on the floor.

1270
02:07:57,052 --> 02:08:08,055
then we need to wait patiently or impatiently, as it may be, for the mayor to finish her work citywide and for the council to pass their budget.

1271
02:08:08,196 --> 02:08:17,478
And once those two things happen, the preliminary number that was provided by the mayor under the budget ordinance by the city council was preliminary.

1272
02:08:17,859 --> 02:08:19,379
That means it's not final.

1273
02:08:19,819 --> 02:08:21,800
So we will

1274
02:08:22,660 --> 02:08:28,922
get a number through a past budget via the mayor and the city council at some point between now and the end of June.

1275
02:08:29,642 --> 02:08:39,106
And at that time, we typically will pass a second request or a second motion that actually spends the money appropriated.

1276
02:08:39,626 --> 02:08:47,268
So what Mr. Rousseau put on the floor tonight, just for you all to be clear, is our request to the municipal government.

1277
02:08:48,009 --> 02:08:49,769
I don't think it outlines any cuts.

1278
02:08:49,829 --> 02:08:51,430
You said level service, is that correct?

1279
02:08:52,915 --> 02:08:53,875
Correct level service.

1280
02:08:54,756 --> 02:09:07,600
Okay, it also adds for lit well, some of these things were things that were savings like for literacy interventionists we don't actually have any right now, even though we had budgeted for them so this adds them back in.

1281
02:09:08,200 --> 02:09:11,421
And then for professional behavioral specialists as well.

1282
02:09:12,642 --> 02:09:13,002
Thank you.

1283
02:09:13,742 --> 02:09:24,507
And you can see that on the screen now so that request will go to the mayor, obviously she's here tonight but that will go to the mayor, it will go to the finance team at the city, it'll be considered by the city council.

1284
02:09:30,970 --> 02:09:39,221
to the city council, then we all have to let them do their work and wait patiently or impatiently, depending on who you are.

1285
02:09:39,881 --> 02:09:45,589
And when they finish their work, they'll come back around to us and say, here's your number.

1286
02:09:45,949 --> 02:09:50,851
And then we will be back here if the number is not what we requested.

1287
02:09:50,871 --> 02:09:52,292
It never is, spoiler.

1288
02:09:53,252 --> 02:09:57,094
And we will talk about the brass tacks of exactly what happens.

1289
02:09:57,594 --> 02:09:58,575
So that's the process.

1290
02:09:58,615 --> 02:10:00,456
I just want to make sure everybody knows what that is.

1291
02:10:01,496 --> 02:10:04,297
Where we are right now is we're making a request.

1292
02:10:04,938 --> 02:10:09,720
What Jerry has laid out is something in the middle of what we might request.

1293
02:10:10,340 --> 02:10:13,523
and what is responsive to that preliminary number.

1294
02:10:13,603 --> 02:10:21,769
So I just want to make sure everybody is clear on that before we take public comment, but there are no other comments from the school committee.

1295
02:10:21,789 --> 02:10:24,552
Member Russo, did you have another comment?

1296
02:10:24,852 --> 02:10:25,352
Oh, I did not.

1297
02:10:25,392 --> 02:10:26,533
I just turned my mic off.

1298
02:10:27,774 --> 02:10:29,356
Member Ntapa.

1299
02:10:30,706 --> 02:10:31,506
Thank you very much.

1300
02:10:32,567 --> 02:10:54,058
I again wanna just say that my comments are more comments than questions, maybe a little bit of both, but wanted to take the opportunity to sort of give my concerns to also let people know that they are heard because a lot of them are from the many, many emails that we have gotten over the last two to three weeks, I believe.

1301
02:10:54,978 --> 02:10:58,060
And I just wanna take a moment and apologize to those who I wasn't able to get to

1302
02:10:58,440 --> 02:11:06,607
immediately right away, but really appreciate you reaching out with your personal experience and things that are going on and your concerns.

1303
02:11:08,288 --> 02:11:15,974
Again, some of the things I'm really concerned about us bouncing back and sort of not bouncing back, really relying on the

1304
02:11:16,955 --> 02:11:18,277
staffing recommendations.

1305
02:11:18,477 --> 02:11:24,122
I feel like, you know, May is mental health awareness month and we are in a mental health epidemic in crisis.

1306
02:11:24,743 --> 02:11:31,610
And I'm really, really concerned about the amount of nursing, the health cuts as well as the guidance counselor cuts.

1307
02:11:31,670 --> 02:11:32,831
I know there are adjustment counselors.

1308
02:11:32,891 --> 02:11:35,674
I know we still have 17 of those in this proposed budget.

1309
02:11:36,055 --> 02:11:36,415
However,

1310
02:11:37,536 --> 02:11:39,657
The ease of access to students are the nurses.

1311
02:11:39,697 --> 02:11:42,799
Those are the people who, if you are having a panic attack, you go right to the nurses.

1312
02:11:42,979 --> 02:11:45,301
I have done that numerous times at the high school.

1313
02:11:45,401 --> 02:11:48,562
It is someone where if you don't know where to go, that is a safe haven.

1314
02:11:48,843 --> 02:11:53,385
And I know the high school still has three, but that's just an example of, you know, later on.

1315
02:11:53,465 --> 02:11:57,408
However, I worry about the ones, you know, the one full time.

1316
02:11:57,448 --> 02:11:59,089
I know there's some sharing going on.

1317
02:11:59,909 --> 02:12:07,914
I made the comment at the last meeting, and we'll make it again, about how one can be a little dangerous, especially when it comes to medication at all levels.

1318
02:12:08,234 --> 02:12:10,415
You know, you can't be administered education.

1319
02:12:10,435 --> 02:12:15,678
I mean, you can't be administered medication without a nurse present.

1320
02:12:15,738 --> 02:12:18,900
You can't not give it to yourself, whether you are seven or you are 19.

1321
02:12:19,180 --> 02:12:20,801
That is just not a possibility.

1322
02:12:22,870 --> 02:12:24,911
And so I wanted to really push back on that.

1323
02:12:25,871 --> 02:12:30,372
You know, I'm, you know, seeing go from six to four, but still really concerned about that.

1324
02:12:31,072 --> 02:12:33,293
A lot of my other concerns have already been echoed.

1325
02:12:34,474 --> 02:12:38,835
When it comes to the performing arts, I'm really happy to hear that, you know, there's going to be a stipend position.

1326
02:12:38,955 --> 02:12:39,275
However,

1327
02:12:39,695 --> 02:12:47,517
I'm really concerned about a stipend position to fund the marching band and color guard because that is such an intensive program in our education system.

1328
02:12:47,657 --> 02:12:52,378
I was an orchestra kid, so I got to witness firsthand how much work they put in.

1329
02:12:52,518 --> 02:13:07,202
And I also wanna make a comment that I didn't make earlier, but we made a comment about how many people were repeating and repeatedly standing up with our students, but I wanna notice how many of our humanity success stories had a performing arts, marching band and color guard garments on.

1330
02:13:25,775 --> 02:13:37,686
It's a lot, it's a lot of work and I've seen it and I worry that when we start to stipend or we start to do that the work may not be, I don't want to say appealing to someone, but it's not enough.

1331
02:13:38,587 --> 02:13:45,954
And oftentimes what that happens is it creates a work environment that is too tiring and then people leave and then we don't want people you know that we've had here for 14 years that

1332
02:13:47,255 --> 02:13:56,799
really love the work, but then can't afford to do the work anymore, so they make that tough decision to leave, and then we can't find someone to replace them because no one wants to do that work for however much money that is.

1333
02:13:58,220 --> 02:13:59,260
So those are some of the big concerns.

1334
02:13:59,280 --> 02:14:04,643
That was a lot of the concerns we had gotten in emails was about the performing arts position directly in the state of that.

1335
02:14:04,683 --> 02:14:05,943
I know there was a lot of misinformation.

1336
02:14:06,003 --> 02:14:07,204
I know there was a lot of talk about

1337
02:14:07,604 --> 02:14:10,285
the Performing Arts program being slashed or cut entirely.

1338
02:14:11,406 --> 02:14:21,370
But that's one of the main concerns I have as someone who sees that sort of on a day-to-day about, you know, people being underpaid, people wanting to have these ambitions and not being able to fulfill them because of that.

1339
02:14:22,370 --> 02:14:33,474
The Performing Arts, there's a huge, you know, it was actually said in an email that reminded me of the term social-emotional learning and, you know, how the academic access, again, what we just showed, the academic success that our

1340
02:14:34,875 --> 02:14:36,556
our students have when they are in that.

1341
02:14:38,398 --> 02:14:42,801
So that's sort of where my now new concern is with the stipend positions.

1342
02:14:42,841 --> 02:14:45,683
I appreciate there's money being put there, however, that condition.

1343
02:14:46,723 --> 02:14:48,104
That also translates to the Missittuck.

1344
02:14:48,244 --> 02:15:00,213
I was talking to some of my former teachers, which is crazy to think that, you know, seeing them here today, I was reminded by one of my teachers that was pregnant when I had them, and they showed me a photo of their 16-year-old son.

1345
02:15:00,993 --> 02:15:20,802
And it made me just really, really think back to the time that I was there, and it was the Missittuck, really concerned at the number of positions that's being cut there, especially, you know, a lot of people had said that the class sizes aren't what are as advertised, that we have a lot of staff members really doing the part of their job description that's other duties is assigned, covering for each other.

1346
02:15:20,822 --> 02:15:23,663
And how many of our, you know,

1347
02:15:24,003 --> 02:15:31,666
language learning students are there and how we are cutting down at a school where we send a lot of people who need maybe extra aid there.

1348
02:15:32,086 --> 02:15:39,409
And so that's a huge concern of mine and one that I wanted to echo from the thousands of comments and people who are here today to talk about that.

1349
02:15:41,430 --> 02:15:48,072
I feel like there's definitely some more comments that have definitely been reshared, so I won't go through some of that, but I just wanna, again, thank everyone who's here today.

1350
02:15:48,720 --> 02:15:51,324
And thank you, Jerry, for, again, being transparent.

1351
02:15:51,384 --> 02:15:56,170
I know this isn't easy to do, and I appreciate being able to look at the numbers and see them.

1352
02:15:57,512 --> 02:16:01,056
But those are sort of some of my high-level concerns, so thank you.

1353
02:16:04,262 --> 02:16:04,742
Thank you.

1354
02:16:05,303 --> 02:16:09,166
Thank you, Member Ntapa for summarizing some of those emails because we all got them.

1355
02:16:10,267 --> 02:16:13,750
So these numbers didn't change since the last meeting.

1356
02:16:15,131 --> 02:16:20,436
So I will also repeat myself from the last meeting, which is to say there are no good solutions here.

1357
02:16:20,476 --> 02:16:21,717
There's only least bad.

1358
02:16:22,718 --> 02:16:26,081
But what I want to know is what are the other options here?

1359
02:16:26,101 --> 02:16:26,881
You know, we

1360
02:16:27,682 --> 02:16:28,663
This looks terrible.

1361
02:16:29,263 --> 02:16:31,885
Having no money and shutting down the schools is also terrible.

1362
02:16:32,525 --> 02:16:34,046
What other things were considered?

1363
02:16:34,126 --> 02:16:36,708
What can we expect?

1364
02:16:38,389 --> 02:16:43,052
If this is the best, what did we not do to make this happen?

1365
02:16:44,033 --> 02:16:57,649
And then, particularly in terms of the extenuating circumstances numbers I think we've done a great job of presenting the big picture and how much money is here, but we got a lot of information about what those on the ground numbers are how many appointments are happening how many.

1366
02:16:59,511 --> 02:17:04,035
IEPs, how many particular needs are happening at the Mississauga cross health services.

1367
02:17:04,295 --> 02:17:10,800
And I don't see any of that here to understand what makes this the least bad solution.

1368
02:17:10,880 --> 02:17:13,623
So we're gonna have to figure out with the money.

1369
02:17:13,643 --> 02:17:18,166
And I know it is the role of the district to do that.

1370
02:17:19,227 --> 02:17:21,109
Jerry, thank you for absorbing these comments.

1371
02:17:21,289 --> 02:17:24,472
You did the numbers, but that's not where

1372
02:17:26,107 --> 02:17:45,183
You took the data that was given, but I feel like I just don't have any of that information about other than hearsay what people have sent me and knowing that this was sat down and said this was the possible course of action, and it wasn't feasible because of this, but this is feasible and I want to know that it really is I need to know.

1373
02:17:45,783 --> 02:18:00,231
that there's a plan can say this, this person is going away again I'm going to repeat myself because this is the same presentation, the work isn't going away and so who's going to be doing it right if you're cutting the person who's leading the effort to roll out our new health curriculum.

1374
02:18:01,071 --> 02:18:02,213
Where is that happening now?

1375
02:18:02,353 --> 02:18:04,776
What will this look like in practice?

1376
02:18:04,896 --> 02:18:05,917
Because these are the numbers.

1377
02:18:06,418 --> 02:18:20,495
So I don't know that we have time to get into those nitty gritties, but I would really like to see some information, not just on numbers, but the on the ground numbers, the qualitative reasons that this is the least bad plan.

1378
02:18:24,032 --> 02:18:28,519
I think we have a question from our student reps too, so Jerry do you have an answer?

1379
02:18:28,559 --> 02:18:38,673
I think that's perfectly reasonable and I think the member Graham pointed out that you know that we're still kind of in the middle of a process but

1380
02:18:40,195 --> 02:18:43,758
we need to see how much money we'll actually have to spend.

1381
02:18:44,138 --> 02:18:55,387
And then we can put some of that information in terms of plans going forward with some of the programs that are affected by cuts.

1382
02:19:00,691 --> 02:19:01,972
Noah and Darren, do you want to speak?

1383
02:19:01,992 --> 02:19:07,417
Yeah, of course.

1384
02:19:08,760 --> 02:19:15,642
just responding to something member Reinfeldt said, in terms of like other alternatives, other options, sort of like least bad options.

1385
02:19:16,762 --> 02:19:31,245
Me and Darren had heard, I don't know how feasible it is, but the idea of a prop 2.5% override from the city, if in the event the city doesn't grant the full level budget that we would be asking for.

1386
02:19:31,265 --> 02:19:34,086
I'm not sure, again, how feasible that is.

1387
02:19:34,126 --> 02:19:35,726
I'm not a finance guy, but I feel like if,

1388
02:19:36,618 --> 02:19:38,501
It sounds like that's not going to be what's happening.

1389
02:19:38,541 --> 02:19:42,586
Even if we ask for that budget, even if we ask for that money, it doesn't sound like the city is really going to give it.

1390
02:19:43,147 --> 02:19:50,837
So my thought is like, if that doesn't happen, is that a possibility to ask the city to ask the people for more money if we can't get more money from the city?

1391
02:19:52,248 --> 02:19:53,028
I can take a shot at that.

1392
02:19:53,068 --> 02:19:53,569
How's that sound.

1393
02:19:54,049 --> 02:19:54,829
Right.

1394
02:19:54,849 --> 02:20:01,072
So, so, in order to put forward a proposition two and a half override to the city.

1395
02:20:01,092 --> 02:20:03,954
The mayor and the council need to agree to that.

1396
02:20:05,174 --> 02:20:10,317
I sit on the city's finance task force and I know that that is very much part of the discussion happening right now so

1397
02:20:11,397 --> 02:20:18,024
I believe that we will see a request from both the council and the mayor to do a proposition to an app override.

1398
02:20:18,645 --> 02:20:23,390
There is, there are still a lot of questions to be sort of asked and answered.

1399
02:20:23,450 --> 02:20:26,714
We've never even tried this in Medford before in history.

1400
02:20:26,814 --> 02:20:31,499
We are one of like three communities in the entire state that hasn't even tried.

1401
02:20:31,519 --> 02:20:32,681
So we have a lot of questions.

1402
02:20:33,161 --> 02:20:34,422
We're trying to collect answers.

1403
02:20:34,883 --> 02:20:38,045
And those answers might include or could include.

1404
02:20:38,626 --> 02:20:44,191
If we do a proposition to an app override, and it passes how quickly can that money flow to the schools.

1405
02:20:45,112 --> 02:20:45,652
That is going to.

1406
02:20:46,153 --> 02:20:50,576
And that's why I say we have to let the mayor and the council do their work.

1407
02:20:51,777 --> 02:20:56,319
because they have a lot of questions to ask and answer to figure out what is that path forward.

1408
02:20:56,740 --> 02:21:02,002
There's all kinds of other stuff that goes on in budgeting that the mayor is still working on as she puts her budget out.

1409
02:21:02,042 --> 02:21:10,226
So she may find that, for example, local receipts were higher than expected and so the revenue forecast can change.

1410
02:21:10,266 --> 02:21:14,868
So there's a lot of variables still happening, but I think to answer your question,

1411
02:21:15,388 --> 02:21:30,544
Yes, a proposition to have override is very much on the table and that would allow us and the first time in history to ask the community to tell us how much they value our schools, and I've said it a million times I've campaigned three times.

1412
02:21:30,965 --> 02:21:35,450
I'm a supporter, I will knock on your door and I will convince you when we get there but

1413
02:21:35,830 --> 02:21:36,990
Yeah, it's a good question.

1414
02:21:37,050 --> 02:21:47,372
And I think that's where what we're gonna do tonight is we're gonna make a request so that everybody in the city knows what we need to help Medford thrive, not survive.

1415
02:21:48,092 --> 02:21:56,674
What Jerry has presented is like that sort of middle of the road response that includes both like, what do we want to thrive?

1416
02:21:57,094 --> 02:22:00,315
And then what do we think we might actually have at our disposal?

1417
02:22:00,355 --> 02:22:02,175
And how do we sort of close that gap?

1418
02:22:02,895 --> 02:22:13,221
And if that number that comes back from the city is something less than what we have asked for, then this committee will have to make the choices about what is funded and what is not.

1419
02:22:13,341 --> 02:22:21,505
So, but to answer your question, absolutely raising revenue is one way that you balance the scales.

1420
02:22:22,325 --> 02:22:24,006
So you're right on target.

1421
02:22:24,927 --> 02:22:28,228
It's just not something this group has the authority to do or I would do it tonight.

1422
02:22:30,610 --> 02:22:30,930
Darren?

1423
02:22:34,894 --> 02:22:38,376
There are a lot of things I want to touch on.

1424
02:22:39,557 --> 02:22:41,118
So first, I just want to address the cuts.

1425
02:22:41,138 --> 02:22:51,525
So I was discussing with Noah as well, and we strongly believe that any sort of cuts

1426
02:23:01,784 --> 02:23:16,141
whether directly to teaching staff or to the supporting staff that support the students or the faculty or the administration, will affect the so-called teaching core of students and cause irreversible damage.

1427
02:23:18,182 --> 02:23:31,487
And furthermore, I just had some questions regarding additional proposed spending since we're talking about cuts, yet there seems to be, in my opinion, some questionable spending so I just had some questions regarding that.

1428
02:23:33,168 --> 02:23:45,219
So on page 14 of the presentation, there's proposed 20% of our Apple and Chromebook inventory technologies be refreshed, and that will cost roughly $477,000.

1429
02:23:45,259 --> 02:23:58,171
So just wondering roughly how much of that needs to be immediately replaced versus how much can be delayed until further funding is available.

1430
02:23:59,585 --> 02:24:04,250
So that represents 20% of the inventory.

1431
02:24:04,590 --> 02:24:15,480
So our approach was to have a five-year plan, a five-year cycle to have a complete refresh.

1432
02:24:17,613 --> 02:24:28,349
The problem that we have is that many of these Chromebooks were purchased during COVID, and of course that was absolutely necessary because of remote learning.

1433
02:24:29,891 --> 02:24:31,694
So now we are faced with the problem of

1434
02:24:32,655 --> 02:24:36,116
you know, all these Chromebooks are like aging out at the same time.

1435
02:24:36,896 --> 02:24:47,519
So, it's going to be still a couple of rocky years, I think, because the need will be greater in the beginning of the year.

1436
02:24:47,559 --> 02:24:55,361
But if we can get on one-fifth refresh, I think that will put us on a good path.

1437
02:24:57,101 --> 02:25:04,729
The staff actually wanted something shorter, and I just didn't think that this was a year that we could entertain that.

1438
02:25:07,510 --> 02:25:23,527
Jerry, can I just also say from the chair that when you look at the depreciation life cycle of laptops that are frankly like more powerful and sophisticated than the Chromebook, the typical depreciation life cycle is like two or three years in any corporation.

1439
02:25:24,007 --> 02:25:28,452
So when we talk about a five year life cycle, we're actually talking about a pretty extended life cycle.

1440
02:25:29,592 --> 02:25:31,113
for our equipment for our students.

1441
02:25:31,173 --> 02:25:41,876
So luckily Chromebooks have fewer moving parts and so that's a little bit more feasible than in a laptop situation, but this depreciation cycle is very long already in today's time.

1442
02:25:43,237 --> 02:25:47,078
And it includes tablets too, which I used in the lower grades.

1443
02:25:51,112 --> 02:25:52,113
I had another question.

1444
02:25:53,033 --> 02:25:54,114
Can I just add to that?

1445
02:25:54,134 --> 02:25:54,994
Of course, yeah.

1446
02:25:55,114 --> 02:26:09,561
The Chromebooks have a designated life cycle, not because only of the durability of the device itself, but the license, the Chromebooks are licensed and the license expires at a set date and they cannot be extended.

1447
02:26:10,302 --> 02:26:18,186
So the Chromebooks not only is it the device, it's the device license that comes with it, that once that terminates, that's it for the Chromebook.

1448
02:26:23,202 --> 02:26:23,642
Thank you.

1449
02:26:26,203 --> 02:26:27,663
Okay.

1450
02:26:27,703 --> 02:26:30,303
And this is another question regarding buses on page 15.

1451
02:26:30,423 --> 02:26:39,585
I just had a question on this proposed that there'd be two additional buses costing roughly $165,000.

1452
02:26:40,465 --> 02:26:51,607
I was just wondering where those buses would be going and based on what sort of studies or data would back up the need for two additional buses?

1453
02:26:52,402 --> 02:26:58,244
Well, that was in speaking with the person in charge of transportation.

1454
02:26:58,264 --> 02:27:06,507
There was a lot of concern in the community about overcrowded buses at the beginning of the school year.

1455
02:27:07,647 --> 02:27:12,069
So two buses would alleviate some of that overcrowding.

1456
02:27:12,329 --> 02:27:15,310
And if that funding was ultimately provided,

1457
02:27:15,990 --> 02:27:30,341
then we would work with the bus company to redesign the routes in order to spread out the riders through an increased number of buses.

1458
02:27:33,650 --> 02:27:47,893
Yes, I just wanted to comment that the Brooks and Roberts schools, both schools which had high ridership on the buses, the elementary buses were really packed.

1459
02:27:48,853 --> 02:27:52,693
And there was a lot of, we were trying to switch routes around.

1460
02:27:53,193 --> 02:28:01,415
So we do need at least two additional buses in order to alleviate overcrowding on those bus routes.

1461
02:28:02,916 --> 02:28:06,744
Thank you, Darren, did you have more questions.

1462
02:28:09,979 --> 02:28:17,265
And then my last question is regarding the payrolls as HR new positions capacity in supervision to FTEs costing roughly $150,000.

1463
02:28:17,405 --> 02:28:32,918
I'm just wondering if there's any possibility that instead of adding those new positions, if those can be kind of rolled into the existing positions that we have and have those positions fill it out based on doing like cross trainings or any other.

1464
02:28:34,019 --> 02:28:38,303
positions so that we don't have to add two more while we're cutting the positions.

1465
02:28:43,158 --> 02:29:03,177
I did not like the idea of trying to ask for these two positions at the same time we're making all these cuts, but I felt like I would be given, I would be providing a disservice to the school committee if I didn't identify this particular need.

1466
02:29:03,858 --> 02:29:05,960
There's the,

1467
02:29:07,854 --> 02:29:20,070
There was a maternity leave in payroll this year, which resulted in a 50% cut to the staff, because there's only two payroll people for the entire district.

1468
02:29:24,616 --> 02:29:33,022
There's a lot of demands with MTRS reporting now and that has been behind and we're trying to get that current.

1469
02:29:34,723 --> 02:29:39,307
Many employees participate in benefit programs and

1470
02:29:39,967 --> 02:29:53,101
tax-deferred programs that require weekly maintenance when those, when changes, when employees want to make changes to those programs.

1471
02:29:53,882 --> 02:29:54,002
And

1472
02:29:56,258 --> 02:30:00,700
So somebody has to be there to answer questions and direct the work.

1473
02:30:00,720 --> 02:30:13,387
So my vision for that, the business office, is we have two people in accounts payable that could be supervised by the assistant director.

1474
02:30:14,127 --> 02:30:18,189
We have two people in payroll that could be supervised by this new position.

1475
02:30:18,209 --> 02:30:20,150
There's a grants manager, and

1476
02:30:22,495 --> 02:30:23,595
and of course, the director.

1477
02:30:23,635 --> 02:30:29,777
So that to me is kind of a better organization of the office.

1478
02:30:31,878 --> 02:30:37,500
When I worked for Chelsea Public Schools, there was 14 positions in the business office.

1479
02:30:38,380 --> 02:30:43,042
And granted, they get a lot more money in Chapter 70, so they have

1480
02:30:44,082 --> 02:30:47,025
kind of the bandwidth to provide that staffing.

1481
02:30:47,686 --> 02:30:55,635
And the enrollment is also larger than MedFit, but it's just, it's too low.

1482
02:30:57,156 --> 02:31:03,003
The same thing with HR, there's three people in HR, including the HR director.

1483
02:31:04,744 --> 02:31:12,249
There's one staff assigned to our absence management application, which has to be maintained.

1484
02:31:12,269 --> 02:31:18,053
It takes up most of that person's time just maintaining that to make sure it's accurate.

1485
02:31:18,573 --> 02:31:20,014
It feeds the payroll system.

1486
02:31:21,175 --> 02:31:25,098
It provides information to school principals about their staffing.

1487
02:31:25,118 --> 02:31:27,960
There's another position that deals with

1488
02:31:30,480 --> 02:31:32,287
fringe benefits is within HR and

1489
02:31:37,759 --> 02:31:50,729
The amount of onboarding that has to be done, getting back to individuals who would like to be substitute teachers, the beginning of the year, it's very difficult to keep up with that.

1490
02:31:52,510 --> 02:31:58,494
There's no offboarding protocol right now that really should be implemented.

1491
02:31:58,534 --> 02:32:01,997
When somebody leaves, there's a lot of things that have to be buttoned up.

1492
02:32:04,118 --> 02:32:10,045
So again, it's just too lean.

1493
02:32:10,325 --> 02:32:16,453
At one time, I was told that there was additional staff in the payroll and additional staff in HR.

1494
02:32:16,493 --> 02:32:22,059
And then over the course of trying to deal with competing needs,

1495
02:32:23,741 --> 02:32:30,207
and not sufficient resources to address those needs that those positions have kind of gone away.

1496
02:32:30,267 --> 02:32:33,870
So I'm recommending that they be restored.

1497
02:32:33,890 --> 02:32:38,574
I just had a question for the chair.

1498
02:32:38,994 --> 02:32:39,434
Sure.

1499
02:32:39,494 --> 02:32:44,439
When would be a good time to introduce like a petition to the school committee?

1500
02:32:45,079 --> 02:32:47,081
You can describe it right now if you want.

1501
02:32:49,743 --> 02:32:51,745
Point of clarification before we move on.

1502
02:32:52,453 --> 02:32:53,934
Can you put your microphone on so we can hear you?

1503
02:32:54,274 --> 02:32:55,194
Point of clarification.

1504
02:32:55,254 --> 02:32:56,154
Yeah.

1505
02:32:56,495 --> 02:33:10,100
I just wanted to not to stir the pot, but in reference to student members' wrongs with the payroll managerial positions, I think there was some also concern from the union about those usually being administrative assistant roles and then them being non-union.

1506
02:33:10,280 --> 02:33:10,660
Is that?

1507
02:33:11,560 --> 02:33:13,243
proposed effort?

1508
02:33:13,303 --> 02:33:15,306
I just want to get clarification if that's changed.

1509
02:33:15,967 --> 02:33:25,442
No, we're not trying to take work away from the administrative assistance, but we do believe that the work that the

1510
02:33:26,583 --> 02:33:42,852
administrative assistants have should be supervised and kind of somebody that can lead what work will be done, you know, particularly at the beginning of the school year, at the end of the school year, and then at different times.

1511
02:33:42,952 --> 02:33:43,432
There's just

1512
02:33:45,294 --> 02:33:58,267
there's not enough time to get all the work done, it's just too much coming in and somebody has to be able to act as a traffic controller to see what needs to be done immediately and what can be put off.

1513
02:33:59,188 --> 02:33:59,708
Okay, thank you.

1514
02:34:02,131 --> 02:34:02,431
Chair?

1515
02:34:03,812 --> 02:34:04,413
Member Hussain?

1516
02:34:04,553 --> 02:34:06,715
While we wait for that, I think, you know,

1517
02:34:08,627 --> 02:34:12,851
We've been asking for additional payroll and business staff for years now.

1518
02:34:14,352 --> 02:34:22,920
And we are the ones that hear that we pass a union, we get a ratified union contract and it can take months before people get their check.

1519
02:34:23,681 --> 02:34:28,405
And maybe in 1950, that was 100% reasonable.

1520
02:34:29,166 --> 02:34:33,510
In this day and age, if it's less than a week, something's really, really wrong.

1521
02:34:34,942 --> 02:34:41,308
You type the numbers into a computer system, it does the calculations, but we don't have that in Medford.

1522
02:34:42,769 --> 02:34:46,072
And so, considering how manual it is at the moment,

1523
02:34:47,905 --> 02:34:59,338
We need more staff because so folks should not have to wait weeks or months, get a partial for the retroactive stuff and then another month goes by and they get their longevity from three years ago.

1524
02:34:59,819 --> 02:35:03,583
And it's like, nobody can figure it out if you're especially on the receiving end.

1525
02:35:05,024 --> 02:35:08,648
And, you know, last, I believe it was last year.

1526
02:35:09,269 --> 02:35:21,531
We had a presentation, I forget who gave it to us, but we had asked for a, what would it cost for Medford Public Schools to become modernized computer systems?

1527
02:35:22,051 --> 02:35:24,892
Munis is pretty much what everybody buys.

1528
02:35:26,552 --> 02:35:37,954
And it was 18 months and like 1.7 million, I think, if my memory is correct, to buy the software, to train all of the staff, to have the consultants

1529
02:35:38,934 --> 02:35:43,878
helping all of the staff because, you know, like the payroll will have to happen the day after we have Munis.

1530
02:35:44,258 --> 02:35:48,982
And with all the training in the world, you can't just like walk in and just make it happen.

1531
02:35:49,082 --> 02:35:56,788
So we definitely, you know, and if we had Munis, we might be able to reasonably have conversations about adding staff.

1532
02:35:56,869 --> 02:36:03,214
But when I look at other districts, Malden, I believe has 20 people in their business office.

1533
02:36:03,434 --> 02:36:04,715
They're not much bigger than us.

1534
02:36:05,415 --> 02:36:07,097
And we have five?

1535
02:36:08,463 --> 02:36:08,863
Is that right?

1536
02:36:09,564 --> 02:36:09,824
Six.

1537
02:36:10,004 --> 02:36:11,025
Six.

1538
02:36:11,986 --> 02:36:13,227
There's not less work here.

1539
02:36:13,247 --> 02:36:16,369
There's more work here because we don't have the systems.

1540
02:36:17,050 --> 02:36:31,240
So I know that choosing between nurses, administrative assistants, administrators, teachers, and the business office is a pretty ugly choice to have to make.

1541
02:36:31,761 --> 02:36:34,323
But when people are,

1542
02:36:35,042 --> 02:36:40,986
become employed here, it'd be nice if they could start getting a paycheck within a reasonable number of weeks of actually being an employee.

1543
02:36:41,566 --> 02:36:46,949
Or when you retire, it'd be nice if you can find out, hey, can I retire now?

1544
02:36:47,469 --> 02:36:53,433
And we can help you instead of by the time you get an answer, you've already decided, well, I guess I'm not retiring this year.

1545
02:36:54,714 --> 02:36:59,857
So it is an ugly choice, but it is one we have been pushing for for several years.

1546
02:37:00,637 --> 02:37:00,757
And,

1547
02:37:01,838 --> 02:37:11,244
I hope we can keep that in the budget because in addition to everything I just described, the school committee has asked for reports that are not possible with the staffing levels we have.

1548
02:37:11,725 --> 02:37:16,188
Some of them are possible because of the systems and the software can't just push them out.

1549
02:37:17,108 --> 02:37:21,952
And these reports are not just another report to throw in the recycling bin.

1550
02:37:22,032 --> 02:37:27,695
They're reports to help us guide the district and understand where we want Metro Public Schools to go.

1551
02:37:27,715 --> 02:37:29,677
And without that information,

1552
02:37:31,286 --> 02:37:36,790
you know, it's you're steering without a map and it's just not a good situation.

1553
02:37:36,850 --> 02:37:38,371
So I appreciate that they're in there.

1554
02:37:38,391 --> 02:37:39,972
I hope we can keep them in there.

1555
02:37:40,072 --> 02:37:44,675
But I also just hope we can get the 79 million and stop being all worried.

1556
02:37:44,695 --> 02:37:45,575
Thank you.

1557
02:37:48,497 --> 02:37:51,259
Darren, did you want to tell us about your petition?

1558
02:37:58,528 --> 02:38:18,279
So on behalf of the students of Medford High School, Technical Vocational High School, along with faculty members, with over 200 student signatures and over a dozen faculty member signatures, including the Medford Teachers Association Union President, Mr. Guillen, we'd like to introduce this petition to the school committee.

1559
02:38:20,946 --> 02:38:37,870
The students of Medford Public Schools are formally writing this petition to Madam Mayor Brianna Lungo Kern, Medford City Council, and Medford School Committee to ask that the Rainy Day Fund be utilized to fully reconcile the Medford Public Schools funding deficit for the Medford Public Schools 2024 to 2025 school year.

1560
02:38:38,430 --> 02:38:48,153
We believe this action is not only possible, but necessary to preserve the quality of education and well-being of students and faculty attending educational facilities throughout the district.

1561
02:38:48,733 --> 02:38:55,120
We believe that the budget cuts proposed constitutes an immediate emergency to the students of Medford Public Schools.

1562
02:38:56,333 --> 02:39:01,096
The stakeholders petitioning the city acknowledge that the city of Medford is presently experiencing a budget deficit.

1563
02:39:01,536 --> 02:39:16,526
If approved, however, the school committee's proposed cuts of 2024-2025 budget will have a detrimental effect on the quality of education and wellbeing of students and faculty, and may further drive away families from considering enrollment in our city's public schools.

1564
02:39:17,246 --> 02:39:23,931
In particular, cuts proposed to the numerous school nurse positions, administrative assistants, guidance counselors, teachers,

1565
02:39:24,531 --> 02:39:33,101
coordinator of music, et cetera, put Medford public school students at an educational, emotional, and social disadvantage compared to the surrounding public and private schools.

1566
02:39:33,782 --> 02:39:42,672
While surrounding school districts will be investing more resources to improve quality of education and address student wellbeing, Medford will be stripping away the already limited systems in place.

1567
02:39:44,085 --> 02:39:55,796
If the aforementioned positions are cut, student athletic enrollment, arts involvement, academic self-efficacy, and the ability to seek medical examination will be severely reduced and or delayed.

1568
02:39:56,256 --> 02:40:05,165
Students with medical conditions may not be able to receive treatment within an adequate timeframe, engage in extracurricular activities, or enjoy field trips due to shortage of staffing.

1569
02:40:05,625 --> 02:40:15,130
Necessary forms and paperwork will take significantly longer to process, and students will meet with their guidance counselors less frequently and may miss many educational opportunities.

1570
02:40:15,650 --> 02:40:23,974
Furthermore, teachers will have larger class sizes, putting more strain on our already overburdened faculty, irrevocably harming our school committee.

1571
02:40:25,257 --> 02:40:39,557
One specific area that will be systematically quote guided as a result of the proposed budget cuts is our beloved music and fine arts department, the current position of coordinator of fine arts plays a vital role in the daily operations of the music and fine arts department.

1572
02:40:42,710 --> 02:40:56,137
coordinates numerous activities, including but not limited to scheduling all fine arts concerts and performances, band classes, marching band, color guard, drama club, and any music and fine art field trips.

1573
02:40:56,617 --> 02:41:02,961
We are especially concerned that this action will set a dangerous precedent and will become a larger issue if ignored slash sidelined.

1574
02:41:03,721 --> 02:41:12,443
Students deserve an exceptional learning environment with well-paid teachers and faculty, as well as safe and operable facilities in order to thrive in a fast-paced learning environment.

1575
02:41:12,883 --> 02:41:24,286
It is for all the reasons highlighted in this petition, and many more, that we request that just $5 million of the $25 million currently stored in the rainy day fund be used to fill the operational deficit for the 2024-2025 Medford public school budget.

1576
02:41:26,627 --> 02:41:37,513
This action will give the Medford City Government time to propose a 2.5% override tax measure for property taxes and provide the Medford community crucial time to vote on said tax measures.

1577
02:41:37,933 --> 02:41:43,896
Again, this is not only possible, but necessary in order to ensure that students get the education they deserve.

1578
02:42:18,431 --> 02:42:18,992
Thank you, Darren.

1579
02:42:19,012 --> 02:42:19,653
Thank you, Noah.

1580
02:42:19,693 --> 02:42:22,517
There's many, many pages of signatures here, so thank you.

1581
02:42:22,537 --> 02:42:28,726
And I think, you know, sorry, I'm gonna maybe step away.

1582
02:42:29,327 --> 02:42:30,929
Oh, is it, can you turn your mic off?

1583
02:42:30,949 --> 02:42:32,372
I hope that's what's causing the feedback.

1584
02:42:33,793 --> 02:42:35,094
Okay, I think that's better.

1585
02:42:35,294 --> 02:42:36,115
I'll stand back.

1586
02:42:39,137 --> 02:42:42,080
I know that this has been particularly hard on students.

1587
02:42:42,540 --> 02:42:44,342
Thank you all for being here tonight.

1588
02:42:44,362 --> 02:42:52,168
I long for a day where our students can just be kids, and they don't have to worry about budget cuts.

1589
02:42:52,508 --> 02:42:56,831
And we're not there yet, obviously, judging by how many students are in the audience.

1590
02:42:57,712 --> 02:42:58,453
But you're

1591
02:42:59,193 --> 02:43:01,533
You've all been heard, you've all been heard by all of us.

1592
02:43:01,994 --> 02:43:07,555
I don't think there's a single person in this room that wants to make the kinds of cuts that we are talking about having to make.

1593
02:43:08,835 --> 02:43:13,176
And we will get to a vote that sort of solidifies that in just a little bit.

1594
02:43:13,316 --> 02:43:19,517
But before we do that, I do want to hear from the community if there are folks who would like to speak.

1595
02:43:20,437 --> 02:43:23,517
So as a reminder, three minutes, please be brief.

1596
02:43:23,937 --> 02:43:26,558
And if you come to, oh, sorry, member of the party, go ahead.

1597
02:43:27,450 --> 02:43:27,831
Thank you.

1598
02:43:27,851 --> 02:43:36,367
Um, I think I just want to echo what our student representatives are saying and I think what we're hearing from the community and email and other communications and just passing.

1599
02:43:38,942 --> 02:43:51,333
I said something about this in the previous meeting where how do we weigh the costs of education to student preferences, student interests, and how we support our students in every aspect of their experience in the classroom and outside of the classroom.

1600
02:43:51,934 --> 02:43:56,658
And I think that what's happening here is that we are all noticing and recognizing that this can't happen.

1601
02:43:56,698 --> 02:43:57,699
We can't do it this way.

1602
02:43:57,719 --> 02:43:59,060
Our students deserve more.

1603
02:43:59,080 --> 02:44:04,225
And I hope that we continue to advocate for that and work towards finding some way that we can

1604
02:44:04,785 --> 02:44:14,196
avoid these cuts or in ways when if we do have to have these cuts how we can consolidate properly so that student experience inside out to the classroom is not being affected in any direct way.

1605
02:44:14,216 --> 02:44:23,207
I think what's most important to recognize is that our students here are speaking not only from their personal experience from the experiences of those they

1606
02:44:24,448 --> 02:44:30,973
are part of their kinship, the people that they're recognizing, people that they're seeing as being ones who need to speak for what they believe in.

1607
02:44:31,373 --> 02:44:34,975
And I can't thank you enough for being here and speaking for your experience.

1608
02:44:35,876 --> 02:44:38,558
I wanted to speak to Jerry if he's still here.

1609
02:44:38,778 --> 02:44:39,218
Did he leave?

1610
02:44:39,619 --> 02:44:39,699
Oh.

1611
02:44:40,379 --> 02:44:40,759
Thank you.

1612
02:44:40,780 --> 02:44:54,913
I said two quick questions on the slideshow so on slide five, and I just mentioned before from the previous meeting on May 6, you know, the the bullet points some theater sections will be offered as part of a teaching assignment to align with student interest.

1613
02:44:55,734 --> 02:44:58,496
How are we clarifying or how do we determine student interest?

1614
02:44:58,516 --> 02:45:00,878
Because evidently students want these types of programs.

1615
02:45:00,918 --> 02:45:09,545
I understand that this particular point suggests that students are not as interested in the in school, you know, theater program necessarily, but out of school, of course, that's the case.

1616
02:45:09,866 --> 02:45:10,146
Yes.

1617
02:45:10,386 --> 02:45:10,566
Yeah.

1618
02:45:10,967 --> 02:45:14,329
So the out of school, you know, I think we've covered that that's

1619
02:45:15,370 --> 02:45:15,911
in the budget.

1620
02:45:17,692 --> 02:45:28,720
This particular position, I think students fill out their schedule preferences that just went through a process on that.

1621
02:45:29,320 --> 02:45:38,266
I think for this particular position, there were only 11 students over three sections that chose.

1622
02:45:38,287 --> 02:45:38,327
So,

1623
02:45:41,396 --> 02:45:46,322
It could be a section for those 11 students, but it doesn't necessarily command.

1624
02:45:48,885 --> 02:45:57,955
And then on slide 11 with the guidance counselor for the FY 25 staff, according to this, that you're not going to reduce the MHS staffing in any way, but for the McGlynn and the Andrews.

1625
02:45:58,943 --> 02:46:13,536
If we just, you know, just do the basic math, if you were to reduce the MHS from six to four and then move to those counselors to the ones that make land one of the answers to maintain those staffing numbers from FY 24 at the middle school levels, I mean at the elementary, you would have a, you know, 200 220.

1626
02:46:15,297 --> 02:46:23,107
students to one counselor, and then you would have a 295 to one counselor at the MHS, which is more consistent with the national averages you're suggesting.

1627
02:46:23,948 --> 02:46:25,330
I don't love using national averages.

1628
02:46:25,650 --> 02:46:27,152
I'm sure most of us would not like to.

1629
02:46:27,172 --> 02:46:31,638
I understand that we might have to in this unfortunate case, but that seems to be more consistent with that.

1630
02:46:31,998 --> 02:46:38,720
Yeah, well, I think the main point, I am not the last word on this.

1631
02:46:39,380 --> 02:46:45,142
There's the feedback from school committee, and then we have a program director.

1632
02:46:45,182 --> 02:46:49,083
So I think the bottom line for guidance counselors is,

1633
02:46:50,712 --> 02:46:51,193
very good.

1634
02:46:52,835 --> 02:46:53,936
Was it better this year?

1635
02:46:53,996 --> 02:46:54,276
Yes.

1636
02:46:55,998 --> 02:47:08,072
But, you know, the directors now can weigh in and kind of smooth out those, make those staffing decisions to make sure there's as much equity as possible.

1637
02:47:09,549 --> 02:47:13,551
And then I think the last comment is kind of piggyback off what I said previously.

1638
02:47:13,571 --> 02:47:25,516
I think that when we are receiving emails and communications from people in the public, and we're seeing parents and students, most primarily saying, how do we advocate for our students when we're not seeing that from our government?

1639
02:47:25,977 --> 02:47:28,898
We're not noticing how they're being supported, and that's their responsibility.

1640
02:47:28,918 --> 02:47:31,539
And I think it's our responsibility to find ways that we're actually doing that.

1641
02:47:31,979 --> 02:47:32,620
And I think that

1642
02:47:33,500 --> 02:47:34,741
At what point does it stop?

1643
02:47:35,182 --> 02:47:48,775
Because I think that member Graham mentioned that if we continue this the previous meeting when we if we continue the system of not making decisions that are going to financially support our students, people are going to come here and people are going to stay here and we're seeing that trend at the middle school and high school level.

1644
02:47:49,216 --> 02:47:49,876
And I think that

1645
02:47:50,917 --> 02:47:57,321
I don't know how to make the immediate fix, I'm not sure we necessarily have one direct fix and I think cuts is not the way, especially at this level.

1646
02:47:58,041 --> 02:48:03,445
And then we have the other amount of money that isn't really being discussed that could be even more cuts potentially and so I think that.

1647
02:48:05,205 --> 02:48:11,167
I just don't know what we do if cuts is the only fix, because at what point do we then start cutting programs?

1648
02:48:11,647 --> 02:48:17,168
Because that's not on the table now, but that will become a problem if we continue down this path.

1649
02:48:17,188 --> 02:48:24,930
And I understand that you're not the one that created the system that we currently live in financially, but I think that we need to continue figuring out ways to avoid cuts.

1650
02:48:25,550 --> 02:48:31,692
I know that our student representative suggested a prop two and a half and other ways that we can improve our financial situation here at Medford.

1651
02:48:32,828 --> 02:48:35,050
I mean, we will continue to look for resources.

1652
02:48:35,770 --> 02:48:48,659
We've corresponded by email, but the interim health director is interested in Medicaid reimbursement, which we received some, but we could actually

1653
02:48:49,700 --> 02:48:57,343
improve our reimbursement potential, that might provide some resources for extra staff as well.

1654
02:48:58,243 --> 02:49:06,346
But I completely agree with you that, you know, this is a trajectory that we don't want to be on.

1655
02:49:07,227 --> 02:49:10,068
And, you know, the

1656
02:49:11,989 --> 02:49:30,094
the school committee is right to kind of advocate with city representatives and our Department of Education, our governor, field reps, you know, you should continue your advocacy to get the adequate funding that we need.

1657
02:49:31,554 --> 02:49:31,814
Thank you.

1658
02:49:33,272 --> 02:49:33,452
member.

1659
02:49:33,592 --> 02:49:34,433
So thank you.

1660
02:49:34,453 --> 02:49:41,937
I'll just be quick because, um, um, Darren actually said something really important about, um, time.

1661
02:49:41,957 --> 02:49:47,881
Um, and, um, Jerry, have you already begun projections for next year?

1662
02:49:47,901 --> 02:49:55,505
For next for FY 26 on, you know, I mean, some of those things you can just stick them in a spreadsheet.

1663
02:49:55,586 --> 02:49:55,966
Find out.

1664
02:49:56,506 --> 02:49:57,947
Here's what the teacher contract says.

1665
02:49:57,987 --> 02:49:59,668
Here's what the custodial contract says.

1666
02:50:00,088 --> 02:50:01,149
Here's how much it's going up.

1667
02:50:01,669 --> 02:50:02,590
Have you started that already?

1668
02:50:03,360 --> 02:50:12,164
Yes, yes, so the salary increase of $4 million was based on projections for FY25.

1669
02:50:12,324 --> 02:50:17,506
I meant for FY26, you can see into the future on some things.

1670
02:50:17,766 --> 02:50:20,968
Open contracts, you can't necessarily, but you can make a guess.

1671
02:50:21,748 --> 02:50:30,752
Am I correct that we will have a very similar nightmare next year if we do not dramatically increase revenue?

1672
02:50:33,054 --> 02:50:33,754
You are correct.

1673
02:50:34,294 --> 02:50:34,514
Thank you.

1674
02:50:34,755 --> 02:50:38,976
I think that's important for anybody who might be on the fence about a rubber ride.

1675
02:50:39,156 --> 02:50:47,278
Because if we don't, then what we're doing right now is going to seem like the good old days.

1676
02:50:47,678 --> 02:50:54,521
Because if we have to go through with these cuts next year, all those things are gone already.

1677
02:50:54,941 --> 02:50:56,261
What else is it we're cutting?

1678
02:50:57,061 --> 02:50:58,802
And I said in the last meeting,

1679
02:50:59,582 --> 02:51:04,823
arts, and I don't mean all of arts this year, obviously, so $1.75 million.

1680
02:51:06,264 --> 02:51:14,126
But if we are multiple millions of dollars short next year, we're not cutting math, we're not cutting science, we're not cutting English, and we're not cutting history.

1681
02:51:14,746 --> 02:51:15,546
Can I get all of those?

1682
02:51:17,126 --> 02:51:18,707
Those aren't really, those are not options.

1683
02:51:18,927 --> 02:51:21,547
We're not getting rid of elementary schools or middle schools.

1684
02:51:22,007 --> 02:51:24,268
So when you look at what we will not be

1685
02:51:26,247 --> 02:51:27,909
in trouble with the state.

1686
02:51:28,570 --> 02:51:31,053
If we cut, we all know what programs those are.

1687
02:51:31,073 --> 02:51:34,036
And there's a lot of people here from those programs.

1688
02:51:35,097 --> 02:51:45,269
And so we have this nightmare to get through right now, but the moment we finish and pass some budget, we are, it's like,

1689
02:51:46,697 --> 02:51:47,438
Rinse and repeat.

1690
02:51:47,718 --> 02:51:52,882
If we do not find dramatically more revenue for the city and the state is not going to come and save us at all.

1691
02:51:53,382 --> 02:51:54,163
They are really aren't.

1692
02:51:55,184 --> 02:52:04,711
And I think, you know, I certainly advocate with my, my state senator and state rep, and, you know, there's some improvement, but as I said in the last meeting.

1693
02:52:06,182 --> 02:52:19,715
There's no formula to fix Medford because our property taxes, and everybody wants to say their property taxes are too high because nobody likes taxes, but our property taxes are the seventh lowest in the state.

1694
02:52:19,735 --> 02:52:19,795
And

1695
02:52:24,260 --> 02:52:30,386
You may not feel it, I may not feel it, and I certainly don't look forward to paying more in taxes, but the facts are the facts.

1696
02:52:30,546 --> 02:52:32,588
So the state will not fix this problem.

1697
02:52:32,928 --> 02:52:42,797
So if we do wanna have a public school system we'd be willing to send our kids to, we have to pay more in property taxes is the only actual option, the only option.

1698
02:52:43,297 --> 02:52:47,019
Because we don't want to say to the teachers, oh, you're going to get 0% for the next three years.

1699
02:52:47,639 --> 02:52:49,840
Everybody's like, you get 2 and 1⁄2 every year.

1700
02:52:49,880 --> 02:52:50,501
That's too much.

1701
02:52:50,601 --> 02:52:53,642
And then in the same breath, we're going to give teachers 3% a year.

1702
02:52:53,922 --> 02:52:55,123
And I'm not saying they don't deserve it.

1703
02:52:56,263 --> 02:53:01,466
But second grade math says, you get 2 and 1⁄2% more, and you're going to give out 3% more.

1704
02:53:01,506 --> 02:53:05,608
Where's it supposed to come from?

1705
02:53:05,908 --> 02:53:10,090
The answer is, it's supposed to come from increasing property taxes going up more than 2 and 1⁄2.

1706
02:53:13,485 --> 02:53:17,747
That's not a school committee problem to solve, although we can scream about it till the end of days.

1707
02:53:18,647 --> 02:53:20,228
That's a city problem.

1708
02:53:20,248 --> 02:53:28,912
You know, Mayor and City Council problem and then the voters, and hopefully lots of you all will join in the drive to get people to vote.

1709
02:53:30,192 --> 02:53:31,053
Because if you don't.

1710
02:53:32,115 --> 02:53:40,998
Next year, we're gonna have this conversation again, and we're not gonna be cutting a coordinator or a non-filled theater teacher.

1711
02:53:41,278 --> 02:53:53,303
If we have to cut many millions of dollars next year, I mean, I don't wanna say those words out loud, but we all know it is not math, it's not science, it's not English, and it's not history, it's arts.

1712
02:53:57,408 --> 02:53:58,049
That's what it is.

1713
02:53:58,069 --> 02:54:11,484
So I hope we can get past just tonight and this budget and recognize this is your engagement has got to continue because showing up once a year isn't gonna fix it.

1714
02:54:12,626 --> 02:54:12,886
Thank you.

1715
02:54:23,027 --> 02:54:35,094
Member Brandling, so just to follow up, Jerry, you had mentioned that when things are cut, we would then talk to the directors about how that would happen, but didn't we cut the directors?

1716
02:54:43,259 --> 02:54:44,359
It says six, right?

1717
02:54:44,419 --> 02:54:47,421
Departments affected, administrators, is that the same thing?

1718
02:54:48,602 --> 02:54:50,083
Yep, but that's not all.

1719
02:54:51,103 --> 02:54:55,166
But I think the point is they're still employed at Medford Public Schools through the end of this year.

1720
02:54:55,246 --> 02:54:59,489
So that work would have to happen in the right now in order to be ready for next year.

1721
02:54:59,609 --> 02:55:03,932
So if the contract ends June 30th and we get the numbers on June 30th, didn't you mention that date?

1722
02:55:04,572 --> 02:55:06,733
How do we ask somebody who's no longer in the position?

1723
02:55:07,594 --> 02:55:10,056
I think the hope is that we would have those numbers long before June 30th.

1724
02:55:10,096 --> 02:55:11,897
Well, I have a lot of hopes tonight.

1725
02:55:13,278 --> 02:55:14,679
And I'm not sure that they're all gonna happen.

1726
02:55:14,719 --> 02:55:16,700
So we can hope that that's the case.

1727
02:55:17,461 --> 02:55:20,503
But is that really the reality if we've got those positions?

1728
02:55:22,044 --> 02:55:29,790
There are still a number of directors and coordinators employed to make those decisions.

1729
02:55:29,810 --> 02:55:30,611
But in different departments?

1730
02:55:31,491 --> 02:55:31,711
Yes.

1731
02:55:32,712 --> 02:55:36,135
But why would I want someone in a different department to answer the question about a different department?

1732
02:55:37,976 --> 02:55:39,077
Am I missing something?

1733
02:55:44,101 --> 02:55:45,582
The superintendent can answer if she'd like.

1734
02:55:48,298 --> 02:55:50,839
I'm asking for clarification.

1735
02:55:51,439 --> 02:56:00,763
You are asking if the directors and administrators have been informed about the potential cuts and what would happen?

1736
02:56:01,084 --> 02:56:08,007
Yeah, so I know that they've been informed and Jerry, he doesn't have the final answers that he would consult with the directors and they would, they would, you know, figure things out then.

1737
02:56:08,047 --> 02:56:10,148
But if we've cut the directors, how do we ask them?

1738
02:56:10,588 --> 02:56:16,709
So we have had, I have had direct conversations with all of the impacted individuals.

1739
02:56:17,870 --> 02:56:32,553
And what would happen is once we have the final numbers that we're working with, at that point in time, we will impact bargain with the representatives and look at where the work would be redistributed.

1740
02:56:33,353 --> 02:56:39,036
So I've been in ongoing communication with their residents as well.

1741
02:56:39,357 --> 02:56:47,361
And so we're just kind of in a holding pattern right now, but there has been communication.

1742
02:56:47,381 --> 02:56:50,663
It has been clearly communicated.

1743
02:56:50,683 --> 02:56:52,284
Okay.

1744
02:56:52,404 --> 02:56:57,727
On the payroll positions, it says that there are times people are waiting weeks or months.

1745
02:56:58,107 --> 02:56:58,808
It'd be nice.

1746
02:57:00,027 --> 02:57:07,589
if we could get some of these reports that we've been asking for, that some of the things we asked for is a system issue, but some is a person issue.

1747
02:57:08,309 --> 02:57:17,331
So if it's a system issue and we hire two people, we still have the system that we have to deal with that we're not getting a new one up.

1748
02:57:17,992 --> 02:57:23,173
So if we have two people that still can't get those numbers out of the system, is it really worth hiring the two people?

1749
02:57:25,611 --> 02:57:30,195
Well, for payroll, we're suggesting going from two people to three people.

1750
02:57:30,215 --> 02:57:35,359
Okay, and then for the retirement, does retirement not go through City Hall?

1751
02:57:37,781 --> 02:57:53,313
Even, I mean, I know- Yeah, the city administers the local retirement system, and we have school staff that are members of the local retirement system, and then the teachers and certified administrators belong to the Mass Teachers Retirement System.

1752
02:57:53,802 --> 02:57:56,585
So that comes from that office you're talking about in payroll?

1753
02:57:56,625 --> 02:57:57,045
Well, both.

1754
02:57:57,305 --> 02:57:59,908
I mean, they both have needs.

1755
02:58:00,949 --> 02:58:05,133
So do we know if the holdup is city side or school side?

1756
02:58:05,873 --> 02:58:06,054
No.

1757
02:58:06,334 --> 02:58:07,555
Am I misunderstanding that?

1758
02:58:07,615 --> 02:58:08,776
I just want to make sure.

1759
02:58:08,996 --> 02:58:12,420
There's a lot of requests for information.

1760
02:58:12,500 --> 02:58:15,502
So if people are going to retire, that's going to trigger.

1761
02:58:17,744 --> 02:58:19,905
requests from information from MTRS.

1762
02:58:20,846 --> 02:58:23,507
Some people might be planning their retirement.

1763
02:58:23,667 --> 02:58:27,109
So they ask MTRS, you know, what are my options?

1764
02:58:27,269 --> 02:58:28,210
When can I retire?

1765
02:58:28,430 --> 02:58:33,373
And so they have to come and request information from us to try to figure that out.

1766
02:58:33,533 --> 02:58:42,117
And then there's every time we run a payroll, we have a need to do reporting to MTRS as well.

1767
02:58:42,417 --> 02:58:43,518
Okay.

1768
02:58:43,598 --> 02:58:44,679
And then just in the,

1769
02:58:46,387 --> 02:58:47,653
sake of education.

1770
02:58:50,968 --> 02:58:52,828
I just want to give the definition of grandstanding.

1771
02:58:53,589 --> 02:58:55,489
It's a noun and it's derogatory.

1772
02:58:56,369 --> 02:59:02,450
And it says, it's the action of behaving in a showy manner in an attempt to attract favorable attention from spectators or the media.

1773
02:59:03,030 --> 02:59:06,371
So I in no way ever want to be grandstanding.

1774
02:59:06,731 --> 02:59:10,292
If I seem grandstanding to you, this is just who I am.

1775
02:59:10,792 --> 02:59:12,392
Can I show my heart on my sleeve?

1776
02:59:13,032 --> 02:59:15,052
And I have passion for things that I care about.

1777
02:59:15,512 --> 02:59:17,153
And this is what I care about.

1778
02:59:17,273 --> 02:59:18,353
This is why I'm in this seat.

1779
02:59:27,846 --> 02:59:30,147
Are there members of the public that would like to speak?

1780
02:59:42,752 --> 02:59:46,134
Can you state your name and address for the record?

1781
02:59:46,194 --> 02:59:54,817
Benjamin Rhodes, 17 Palmer.

1782
02:59:54,857 --> 02:59:56,318
Benjamin Rhodes, 17 Palmer Street.

1783
02:59:58,431 --> 02:59:59,911
Kean Leow, 9L Avenue.

1784
03:00:02,252 --> 03:00:03,192
Members of the school committee.

1785
03:00:03,713 --> 03:00:04,693
My name is Benjamin Vertz.

1786
03:00:04,833 --> 03:00:08,634
I'm a junior at Medford High School and one of the drum majors for the Medford High School Marching Band.

1787
03:00:09,254 --> 03:00:13,016
I've been part of the band program in Medford since fifth grade.

1788
03:00:13,996 --> 03:00:14,896
My name is Kean Leow.

1789
03:00:15,076 --> 03:00:21,118
I'm also a drum major and also a junior at Medford High School, and I've also been a part of the band program since fifth grade.

1790
03:00:21,678 --> 03:00:27,220
And we just would like to share, I guess, our perspective on this and how it affects us.

1791
03:00:28,657 --> 03:00:42,077
We stand before you today to advocate for the position of the coordinator of performing arts within the metro public schools, the coordinator of performing arts plays a pivotal role in creating and growing a vibrant and successful arts community in Medford.

1792
03:00:44,354 --> 03:00:58,996
They provide invaluable support to many performing groups, including marching band, high school, the marching band, high school concert band, and middle school concert band, as well as elementary band, color guard, theater program, and the music camp.

1793
03:00:59,717 --> 03:01:04,199
We are sure you already understand the numerous benefits of performing arts for us as students.

1794
03:01:04,739 --> 03:01:07,461
It's a valuable extracurricular activity.

1795
03:01:07,921 --> 03:01:14,344
It provides avenues for self-expression, connection, and it creates a sense of self-belonging and camaraderie.

1796
03:01:14,884 --> 03:01:16,365
And it also fosters school spirit.

1797
03:01:17,065 --> 03:01:23,348
We would also like to make it very clear that we understand that you do not intend to get rid of these programs.

1798
03:01:24,780 --> 03:01:31,806
However, by removing the coordinator of performing arts, you risk dismantling the infrastructure that sustains these programs.

1799
03:01:32,587 --> 03:01:40,594
Without adequate guidance and support, these groups will struggle to operate efficiently, leading to a decline in participation and quality.

1800
03:01:41,295 --> 03:01:50,282
So the marching band was hit especially hard by the pandemic, and we dropped from about 80 students every year to this year, only 14 win players.

1801
03:01:51,758 --> 03:01:55,061
And evidently, the past few years have been rebuilding years for us.

1802
03:01:55,661 --> 03:01:59,765
And you can see this if you look at our elementary bands and our middle school bands today.

1803
03:02:01,186 --> 03:02:09,432
Just two weeks ago, at our annual spring band concert, we had an elementary band of 125 students perform for hundreds at Chevalier Theater.

1804
03:02:10,615 --> 03:02:22,591
And in just a few more years, with the continued support of this position, this director, the high school marching band will grow back to and possibly even surpass its former state.

1805
03:02:23,112 --> 03:02:27,278
And enrollment in the band class at the high school level tells a similar story.

1806
03:02:28,663 --> 03:02:31,724
this position risks halting all the momentum that we've gained.

1807
03:02:32,424 --> 03:02:37,826
When momentum is lost, it is easy for a program to decline until it disappears altogether.

1808
03:02:38,466 --> 03:02:40,066
This by no means is a new story.

1809
03:02:40,687 --> 03:02:48,709
Other programs and clubs, like the dance department, or more recently, Interact Club, have disappeared because of a loss of vital leadership and support.

1810
03:02:49,949 --> 03:02:54,691
Again, we understand that you don't want to do these cuts, but

1811
03:02:57,703 --> 03:03:03,306
However, we also urge you to understand that the performing arts cannot succeed without this position.

1812
03:03:04,186 --> 03:03:04,426
Thank you.

1813
03:03:17,667 --> 03:03:36,705
Okay, so I'm a junior at Medford high and I'm the captain of the color guard team, and I've been in color guard for almost five years now color guard has taught me the importance of leadership commitment and dedication and it has taught me to deal with my anxieties and just perform in front of large crowds.

1814
03:03:39,378 --> 03:03:44,422
The next two seasons of marching band and winter guard are going to be my very last seasons.

1815
03:03:44,503 --> 03:03:53,811
And I am beyond excited because I know that we will be able to bring home even more trophies and medals to add to our undefeated status.

1816
03:03:54,431 --> 03:04:03,720
During our competitions, parents and students from other schools will come to us and tell us about how excited they are to see our shows and how much they love us.

1817
03:04:04,420 --> 03:04:12,983
But this reputation that we have built as the Medford Mustang Marching Band and Color Guard will crash and fall without the support of Ms.

1818
03:04:13,023 --> 03:04:13,323
Rello.

1819
03:04:13,944 --> 03:04:14,104
Ms.

1820
03:04:14,124 --> 03:04:21,466
Rello has had many obstacles in her time in Medford High, and she has persevered through all of them for her students.

1821
03:04:22,207 --> 03:04:30,250
Whenever we lacked proper funding, she single-handedly started fundraisers or even paid out of her own pocket to help us win season after season.

1822
03:04:31,190 --> 03:04:41,222
Whenever we had nowhere to practice and prepare for our competitions, she fought relentlessly to get us at least an elementary school cafeteria to practice in.

1823
03:04:41,623 --> 03:04:42,964
It was certainly better than nothing.

1824
03:04:44,050 --> 03:04:52,418
In her position, as you've heard, she is not only responsible for Marching Band and Color Guard, but also the Drama Club and Jumpstart Music Camp.

1825
03:04:52,598 --> 03:04:58,324
And all of these have had the most successful productions and seasons in this year than ever before.

1826
03:04:59,065 --> 03:05:00,926
So I urge you not to make this decision.

1827
03:05:01,727 --> 03:05:06,733
You will struggle to find someone else qualified enough to fill such an involved position.

1828
03:05:07,354 --> 03:05:15,665
Everything we have built will mean nothing because we may never be able to reach the same amount of success without her persistent efforts.

1829
03:05:17,131 --> 03:05:18,831
And I want to bring up one more thing.

1830
03:05:19,412 --> 03:05:35,195
The reason why we have such a small amount of students taking band classes is because of our poor scheduling in our school currently, like CTE exploration and the fact that there are not enough classes offered throughout the day.

1831
03:05:35,855 --> 03:05:44,878
And because of these poor scheduling problems, we have to make up for the time lost after school with added practice days.

1832
03:05:45,178 --> 03:05:46,978
So I just wanted to add that on.

1833
03:05:47,458 --> 03:05:48,099
Thank you.

1834
03:05:53,022 --> 03:05:54,062
Name and address for the record.

1835
03:05:54,102 --> 03:05:57,344
I'm Amanda Chow, 65 Fountain Street.

1836
03:05:58,325 --> 03:06:03,368
So I'm one of the captains of the Color Guard, and I've been part of the marching band for three years.

1837
03:06:04,069 --> 03:06:15,136
And next year is my last and final year, and I can't wait to perform the last final show, wear my last final costume, and look at the last final props that I'll be seeing.

1838
03:06:15,816 --> 03:06:26,119
For the past 14 years, Mrs. Rello and our coach Jackie Gaffney started a marching band in Color Guard from nothing and organized each show for their students, for us.

1839
03:06:26,859 --> 03:06:38,322
And they have worked tirelessly so that we can have a show every season and even a better show every year and inspired us to continue our passion every single time.

1840
03:06:38,342 --> 03:06:42,303
And along the way, they faced a series of challenges

1841
03:06:42,763 --> 03:06:49,912
such as losing our winter guard floor and chasing after it, and dealing with understaffed positions dependent on stipends.

1842
03:06:50,713 --> 03:06:58,322
And the school only provides three marching band stipends, yet we have 11 marching band staff members during the fall.

1843
03:06:59,203 --> 03:07:13,585
And to support us, Mrs. Rello started a band parent organization to fund competition fees, buses, uniforms, flags, and instruments, ensuring that we can have a show or even the thought of having a show.

1844
03:07:14,586 --> 03:07:29,519
And in my time with the band, I have never seen one moment where Miss Rello is not thinking about us, or working on the marching band show, or even organizing concerts for the high school, middle school, and elementary school.

1845
03:07:30,220 --> 03:07:34,624
The marching band is a place of musical enrichment and belonging.

1846
03:07:35,024 --> 03:07:41,210
And the fine arts program may be identical without her, but the experience will not be the same.

1847
03:07:41,930 --> 03:07:47,334
And this place is our family, and it's become my family as well.

1848
03:07:48,094 --> 03:07:51,116
And taking this experience away from us would change everything.

1849
03:07:51,196 --> 03:07:55,079
So I ask you, please reconsider Mrs. Rello's position on the budget, please.

1850
03:07:55,759 --> 03:07:56,059
Thank you.

1851
03:07:56,079 --> 03:07:56,820
Thank you, Mandy.

1852
03:08:01,203 --> 03:08:05,346
Name and address for the record.

1853
03:08:06,266 --> 03:08:06,746
Good evening.

1854
03:08:06,827 --> 03:08:08,948
I'm here to represent the Banned Parent Organization.

1855
03:08:09,767 --> 03:08:13,470
I've been volunteering for the past 13 years, and some of you may have seen me around.

1856
03:08:13,490 --> 03:08:19,113
I've also volunteered in events that take place throughout the school, such as arts and drama.

1857
03:08:19,133 --> 03:08:26,939
And the main reason we're still around after all these kids, my kids have graduated, for the kids in the school.

1858
03:08:27,259 --> 03:08:28,059
I can go all night.

1859
03:08:29,288 --> 03:08:33,270
on why this is so important to the school and the band, Color Guard and drama.

1860
03:08:33,970 --> 03:08:38,152
The changes to so many of these kids' lives, friendships, bonds been made.

1861
03:08:38,412 --> 03:08:44,834
I believe it's time that she puts in into place to take.

1862
03:08:45,054 --> 03:08:49,116
I'm not sure if everyone knows how much time that she puts into this.

1863
03:08:49,716 --> 03:08:51,737
I'm pretty positive that no one does.

1864
03:08:52,837 --> 03:08:56,719
I'm talking about Mrs. Rallo, the endless hours that she puts in above and beyond us.

1865
03:08:57,768 --> 03:09:00,249
in the stipends that pay out in these positions.

1866
03:09:00,469 --> 03:09:01,709
Let me run through them.

1867
03:09:02,870 --> 03:09:10,332
Spring band camp, 15 hours equals five days, excuse me, five days per, three hours per day.

1868
03:09:11,573 --> 03:09:13,874
August band camp, 70 hours, 10 days, seven days.

1869
03:09:17,149 --> 03:09:23,453
We got weekly practices, 72 hours, 10 weeks, Tuesdays and Wednesdays practices, three hours each.

1870
03:09:23,893 --> 03:09:26,035
Three Saturday practices, four hours each.

1871
03:09:26,595 --> 03:09:33,821
NESBA competitions, 72 hours, equals six competitions with practice in the morning, 12 hour days.

1872
03:09:34,501 --> 03:09:35,282
There are long days.

1873
03:09:36,202 --> 03:09:39,324
Football games, 16 hours, four games, four hours each.

1874
03:09:40,145 --> 03:09:43,570
game to set up and break down parades for fundraising.

1875
03:09:44,151 --> 03:09:46,655
Two parades, four hours each, and that's on her own time.

1876
03:09:47,316 --> 03:09:49,178
That's a total of 283 hours.

1877
03:09:50,020 --> 03:09:53,765
So if you break that wage down of what she gets for stipends of $3,700, it breaks down to about $13 an hour.

1878
03:09:58,152 --> 03:10:08,655
That's not including the trips that we go on, such as the Marching Down Main Street in Disney and Six Flags competitions, Hershey Park, NESPA meetings that take place 30, 35 hours a year.

1879
03:10:09,355 --> 03:10:13,016
We have a couple of trophies, which you've probably seen in the audience with us.

1880
03:10:13,436 --> 03:10:15,617
Over 100 plus have been won because of her.

1881
03:10:16,197 --> 03:10:20,118
She's always been trying to make Medford, the schools to where everyone wants to be.

1882
03:10:21,318 --> 03:10:22,578
There is no stipends for that.

1883
03:10:23,419 --> 03:10:24,459
So who can we,

1884
03:10:25,847 --> 03:10:31,991
get to do all that with the heart of what she has to put into it for less than $13 an hour.

1885
03:10:33,152 --> 03:10:37,054
I hope this will give you some information towards what she does in the city.

1886
03:10:37,274 --> 03:10:40,236
And she's so proud of us in the city that she provides.

1887
03:10:41,457 --> 03:10:47,921
So I keep hearing that she has, that we're not getting rid of Machu Picchu drama.

1888
03:10:49,082 --> 03:10:51,344
So she's the backbone of all this.

1889
03:10:51,884 --> 03:10:53,985
So is she walking out?

1890
03:10:54,085 --> 03:10:55,046
Who's taking the position?

1891
03:10:56,705 --> 03:10:59,306
I mean, it sounds like we're not keeping her position.

1892
03:11:00,426 --> 03:11:10,630
So I'd just like to know who's gonna fulfill all these drama, color guard, marching band, and all these other programs that she provides.

1893
03:11:11,771 --> 03:11:12,071
Thank you.

1894
03:11:25,590 --> 03:11:30,035
I'm gonna ask the superintendent to answer your question once we get through some of this public comment.

1895
03:11:30,815 --> 03:11:31,196
Thank you.

1896
03:11:31,636 --> 03:11:33,698
Point of clarification, vice chair.

1897
03:11:33,918 --> 03:11:35,180
Point of clarification.

1898
03:11:35,660 --> 03:11:41,126
I know that we made a motion earlier to strike the addresses of our student members in the minutes.

1899
03:11:41,226 --> 03:11:49,254
Would it make sense to suspend the rules or make a motion to strike the students who have to speak further to give their address when they speak at the podium for minutes or?

1900
03:11:50,957 --> 03:11:54,838
I mean, most people aren't giving it anyway, or it can't be heard, so I think we're okay.

1901
03:11:54,878 --> 03:11:57,099
If you just wanna tell us your name, that's fine.

1902
03:11:57,159 --> 03:12:00,660
I just wanna clarify and make that note to the students that they don't have to.

1903
03:12:01,260 --> 03:12:01,600
Sure.

1904
03:12:01,740 --> 03:12:02,720
Thank you, because they have.

1905
03:12:02,740 --> 03:12:03,781
Your name and address for the record.

1906
03:12:04,201 --> 03:12:05,821
Brendan Crow, 10 Stickney Road.

1907
03:12:05,841 --> 03:12:10,502
I'm 19 years old, and I graduated from Metrovocational Technical High School last year.

1908
03:12:11,063 --> 03:12:19,425
I have been a part of the marching band for a total of 11 years, four years helping my dad load and unload the trailer while my brother was playing the drums.

1909
03:12:20,085 --> 03:12:25,653
six years playing bass drum and one year coming back as staffed up march band after I graduated.

1910
03:12:27,115 --> 03:12:28,237
Now was I good at the drums?

1911
03:12:28,577 --> 03:12:28,777
No.

1912
03:12:29,378 --> 03:12:30,259
But did I enjoy it?

1913
03:12:30,480 --> 03:12:30,980
Yes I did.

1914
03:12:35,052 --> 03:12:51,405
When I first joined the fifth grade band class at the Roberts, Mrs. Rallo taught us how to play our choice of instruments and was already talking about students that they're able to join marching in when they get to middle school, trying to recruit them early.

1915
03:13:01,632 --> 03:13:04,078
As you have probably already heard multiple times.

1916
03:13:04,118 --> 03:13:05,240
This is not a full time.

1917
03:13:05,280 --> 03:13:07,606
I mean, it's not a part time job to full time job.

1918
03:13:08,207 --> 03:13:09,570
It requires a lot of

1919
03:13:11,205 --> 03:13:14,328
lost hours of sleep in preparation just for March at Mandalay.

1920
03:13:15,208 --> 03:13:25,858
Adding on the hours to plan for the concerts, field trips, events around the city, winter guard, and school musical adds a lot more hours of work and late nights at school getting ready for these events.

1921
03:13:26,698 --> 03:13:28,760
Without Mrs. Rolo, the band will fall apart.

1922
03:13:28,920 --> 03:13:35,906
And without the band and the other fine arts, we lose creative outlets for children who really need them.

1923
03:13:36,266 --> 03:13:36,567
Thank you.

1924
03:13:44,452 --> 03:13:45,954
Is there somebody else who would like to speak?

1925
03:13:45,974 --> 03:13:50,659
Name and address for the record, please.

1926
03:13:50,940 --> 03:13:52,562
Hi, my name is Jovia Morembe.

1927
03:13:52,582 --> 03:13:55,445
I live at 50 Hicks Avenue, Medford, Mass.

1928
03:13:57,447 --> 03:14:04,515
Honestly, to clear up most of the confusion, which I'm sure you've heard, is there's not a concern of

1929
03:14:06,810 --> 03:14:09,552
removing Performing Arts, it's the concern of Ms.

1930
03:14:09,632 --> 03:14:12,034
Rello, because she is the Performing Arts.

1931
03:14:12,635 --> 03:14:17,278
And if her position is eliminated, the question is, where does she stand?

1932
03:14:17,699 --> 03:14:21,882
Because without her, she is, and I love all the teachers here.

1933
03:14:21,902 --> 03:14:24,404
I grew up in Medford, I've gone to school.

1934
03:14:24,924 --> 03:14:25,865
I love all these teachers.

1935
03:14:25,905 --> 03:14:29,408
I see some of my elementary school teachers here, and I'm so happy they're here.

1936
03:14:30,189 --> 03:14:32,350
And the one thing that I can say is Ms.

1937
03:14:32,390 --> 03:14:33,491
Rello, hands down,

1938
03:14:34,552 --> 03:14:37,194
is the heart of Medford.

1939
03:14:37,514 --> 03:14:41,157
She is one of the most hardworking teachers I have ever met in my life.

1940
03:14:41,557 --> 03:14:49,263
When I was auditioning for drum corps in 2020 before COVID, she would stay with me up until 8 p.m.

1941
03:14:49,923 --> 03:14:52,565
some nights just to help me rehearse.

1942
03:14:53,065 --> 03:14:58,770
The concern about her position is, yes, we understand that

1943
03:15:01,363 --> 03:15:07,584
that her job could, her position can be removed or replaced with more cost effective solutions.

1944
03:15:08,185 --> 03:15:14,406
But there are hours, countless hours that go into such a position that you do not even see.

1945
03:15:14,926 --> 03:15:17,707
There are many hours that are unpaid that go behind.

1946
03:15:17,867 --> 03:15:31,090
And if taking away her position and finding more cost effective ways to solve the problem are put into place, the integrity of our programs, of the drama club, of the marching band,

1947
03:15:31,290 --> 03:15:46,566
Even just other musical arts in the school there, the integrity of them fall short because they're, as you see leaders in the Medford public school system, and there is an understanding that of course subjects math history they're important.

1948
03:15:46,606 --> 03:15:46,846
Yes.

1949
03:15:47,607 --> 03:15:49,327
And there's an understanding of that.

1950
03:15:49,387 --> 03:15:52,168
But I, as an educator, I teach the Medford band.

1951
03:15:52,208 --> 03:15:52,808
I'm an alum.

1952
03:15:53,348 --> 03:15:58,430
And I put my hours are unpaid, honestly, like I received a very little check this year.

1953
03:15:59,050 --> 03:16:08,012
And that wasn't even a concern of mine, because there's nothing more rewarding than seeing children who have such a love for something.

1954
03:16:08,372 --> 03:16:13,613
You don't find that love a lot of places, but you see kids who are marginalized every day.

1955
03:16:13,993 --> 03:16:17,254
If you hear some of these stories of these kids who struggle in school,

1956
03:16:17,874 --> 03:16:23,696
and they have a lot of, children have mental health disorders and they're really struggling.

1957
03:16:23,736 --> 03:16:30,337
A lot of these places that they find healing, that they find connection is in these performing arts, is in arts in general.

1958
03:16:30,838 --> 03:16:44,321
And honestly, if we say that you guys are here for the schools, you're here for the children, why is there not a concern for what these children need to be able to thrive emotionally, mentally, physically?

1959
03:16:44,721 --> 03:16:46,202
Because this is why they're all here.

1960
03:16:47,082 --> 03:16:52,166
This is why they're all standing right here, because they feel like this is the only place they have.

1961
03:16:52,766 --> 03:16:55,868
And so Miss Relo, she'll sit with you at lunch.

1962
03:16:56,829 --> 03:16:57,690
She'll talk with you.

1963
03:16:57,770 --> 03:17:02,353
She's someone, she's some of the only people that she helps kids get into college.

1964
03:17:02,373 --> 03:17:03,894
She helped me with my college applications.

1965
03:17:03,914 --> 03:17:07,137
Those are hours that can't be paid, that can't be made up.

1966
03:17:08,487 --> 03:17:13,190
So I urge you, the school committee, I don't care about the positions, I care about Ms.

1967
03:17:13,230 --> 03:17:15,111
Rello and who she is to this community.

1968
03:17:15,531 --> 03:17:18,613
And if you take her away, where do the rest of us stand?

1969
03:17:19,493 --> 03:17:19,914
Thank you.

1970
03:17:19,934 --> 03:17:33,141
Thank you.

1971
03:17:37,415 --> 03:18:04,256
I'm a senior at Medford High School and I've been in the band for like six years and this is really hard for me to talk about but I deal with mental health struggles and stuff and a lot of my friends are in band and I want to see them thrive next year when I come back from college and I'm gonna join

1972
03:18:06,112 --> 03:18:07,433
college band and stuff.

1973
03:18:08,514 --> 03:18:10,315
And that's all because of the band here.

1974
03:18:10,335 --> 03:18:15,018
And it's really important to me that, like, I see them thrive.

1975
03:18:16,338 --> 03:18:21,742
And it's such a family.

1976
03:18:23,546 --> 03:18:27,967
I feel like we all look out for each other and we all help each other.

1977
03:18:28,447 --> 03:18:38,869
Like Jovia helped me with my college applications, like during finals, during finals, during a band competition, she helped me with my college applications.

1978
03:18:40,089 --> 03:18:45,750
And that's like, I feel like that's something you won't find anywhere else.

1979
03:18:46,831 --> 03:18:52,772
That's like a community you won't find anywhere else other than like the arts and with band.

1980
03:18:54,462 --> 03:18:57,124
And Ms.

1981
03:18:57,164 --> 03:18:58,685
Rallo runs it all.

1982
03:19:02,628 --> 03:19:03,088
That's all.

1983
03:19:03,769 --> 03:19:04,169
Thank you.

1984
03:19:04,189 --> 03:19:14,757
Are there other participants who would like to talk?

1985
03:19:16,779 --> 03:19:16,979
No?

1986
03:19:17,119 --> 03:19:17,759
Okay.

1987
03:19:17,900 --> 03:19:22,163
Superintendent, can you respond to the question that was posed earlier before we continue?

1988
03:19:23,760 --> 03:19:30,789
I hope I'm responding to the question appropriately, but for miss fellow, I have met with her.

1989
03:19:30,809 --> 03:19:38,218
We have spoken about other positions within the district that would be available where she would be able to have.

1990
03:19:39,899 --> 03:19:47,641
some flexibility, basically some of the work looking very similar to what was happening like two years ago.

1991
03:19:47,661 --> 03:20:08,526
So we have had discussions, we have not fully identified what that could potentially look like, but the idea would be that if she was in some type of a teaching capacity, whether it could be at the high school level or working with elementary band, she would still be involved in the arts,

1992
03:20:09,266 --> 03:20:16,487
And we would work collaboratively to figure out the additional band responsibilities.

1993
03:20:17,788 --> 03:20:23,749
There is impact bargaining, which I said earlier needs to happen because she is part of a unit.

1994
03:20:24,329 --> 03:20:32,791
But prior to two years ago, we had one administrative role which covered the arts.

1995
03:20:35,442 --> 03:20:48,693
We're going back to one administrative role working with the arts, but seeing how we could be creative to still allow our students to have an identical arts experience.

1996
03:20:49,213 --> 03:21:00,202
And so based on all of the work that we've been doing and looking at from a student perspective, the students would still be having access to all of the arts.

1997
03:21:01,023 --> 03:21:16,539
The one position that was reduced, we talked about at the high school level, that was one theater position where 11 students signed up out of 1,200 students for three sections, and that's just not financially sustainable.

1998
03:21:17,893 --> 03:21:27,618
But aside from that, that is the only official position that had been reduced, but it was reduced due to enrollment.

1999
03:21:28,198 --> 03:21:34,261
So even if we weren't in this predicament, there would have been a reduction there because it just wasn't sustainable.

2000
03:21:36,502 --> 03:21:36,843
Thank you.

2001
03:21:39,395 --> 03:21:40,476
Your name and address for the record.

2002
03:21:40,756 --> 03:21:51,442
Good evening, my name is Kristen Turner 38 a deadly street Arlington I'm currently a teacher in the Metro Public Schools, the finance department performing arts specifically.

2003
03:21:52,002 --> 03:21:55,504
I've worked with this as well over 1514 years.

2004
03:21:56,105 --> 03:21:59,727
I have also been instrumental no pun intended.

2005
03:22:00,307 --> 03:22:11,356
in developing the elementary music and the middle school program, as well as currently the last three years as an instructor in the Jump Start Music Program.

2006
03:22:12,056 --> 03:22:18,181
And so I just want to stand with our students and advocate for the clarification.

2007
03:22:18,221 --> 03:22:23,005
Thank you, Dr. Vincent, for that clarification and what may take place

2008
03:22:23,845 --> 03:22:38,912
going forward, and advocating for our students at the high school level, because I'm most concerned about a comprehensive music program for general music, band, strings, grades K to 12.

2009
03:22:40,232 --> 03:22:48,419
And yes, this does vitally impact our marching band, but it also impacts all our programs K to 12.

2010
03:22:49,019 --> 03:22:55,885
And for 15 years, I advocated and was the instructor for the district at the elementary level.

2011
03:22:56,285 --> 03:23:03,972
And in three years now, I heard the numbers for the Jump Start and the program going forward, we have over 120 students.

2012
03:23:05,633 --> 03:23:15,860
performing at the elementary and middle school level, there needs to be an opportunity at the high school level to have that comprehensive arts program.

2013
03:23:16,160 --> 03:23:16,960
Thank you very much.

2014
03:23:16,980 --> 03:23:17,321
Thank you.

2015
03:23:23,545 --> 03:23:24,646
Your name and address for the record.

2016
03:23:24,706 --> 03:23:27,268
Yeah, Jennifer Silva, 49 Winthrop Street.

2017
03:23:28,209 --> 03:23:30,070
Hello, school committee superintendent and mayor.

2018
03:23:31,191 --> 03:23:31,952
I am a school nurse.

2019
03:23:32,132 --> 03:23:35,615
I am also the chairperson of the Mefford chapter of the Massachusetts School Nurse Association.

2020
03:23:35,975 --> 03:23:37,757
I'm a parent with children in the Mefford Public Schools.

2021
03:23:38,537 --> 03:23:40,999
Students are always a tough act to follow, but they did an awesome job.

2022
03:23:41,059 --> 03:23:47,584
And I want to echo as a parent who has a student in the elementary band, that Haley Velo is the heart and soul of our band program.

2023
03:23:47,625 --> 03:23:48,685
So she is really amazing.

2024
03:23:49,366 --> 03:23:51,408
And so kudos, all these kids back here.

2025
03:23:56,167 --> 03:23:59,510
I also want to speak a little bit about the proposed staff cuts of the Mississippi.

2026
03:23:59,710 --> 03:24:04,254
I am a Mississippi parent, but I know there's tons of educators and parents behind me, so they will speak to that some more.

2027
03:24:05,395 --> 03:24:12,981
Just to sort of clarify some things that were said during the presentation, I want to remind everybody that we do not currently have a director of health services.

2028
03:24:13,882 --> 03:24:21,449
Our outgoing director did give recommendations prior to her departure, but those do not match what's in the proposed budget that's been presented, okay?

2029
03:24:22,530 --> 03:24:25,014
Nurse staffing really needs to be based on acuity, not numbers.

2030
03:24:25,815 --> 03:24:29,361
The numbers that were brought up earlier, the Massachusetts recommendation of 1 to 250, 500 students, that data is from 1998.

2031
03:24:33,377 --> 03:24:41,181
The information from NASN, National Association of School Nurses, of one nurse to 750 is from 2011, so I think there have been a lot of changes since then.

2032
03:24:42,562 --> 03:24:47,305
Currently, the NASN position statement was reviewed and revised in June 2020, and I'd like to read it.

2033
03:24:48,085 --> 03:24:56,750
It says, this is the position of the National Association of School Nurses that access to a registered professional nurse all day, every day, can improve students' health, safety, and educational achievement.

2034
03:24:57,590 --> 03:25:01,873
Student acuity and school community indicators should be assessed to determine appropriate staffing levels.

2035
03:25:02,653 --> 03:25:07,517
Access to a school nurse may mean that more than one school nurse is necessary to meet the needs of the school population.

2036
03:25:07,538 --> 03:25:13,523
A couple of things that I just wanna give some real life scenarios of what these proposed cuts mean for nursing.

2037
03:25:14,444 --> 03:25:16,886
So it's been mentioned many times that the high school is not being cut.

2038
03:25:17,767 --> 03:25:20,649
Who do you think is gonna go to the other schools when nurses are out?

2039
03:25:21,490 --> 03:25:22,571
The nurses from the high school.

2040
03:25:22,631 --> 03:25:28,997
So we will be cut essentially because we'll probably have two nurses on most days if we have to go cover other schools without subs.

2041
03:25:30,091 --> 03:25:32,353
I'm currently based on seniority.

2042
03:25:33,214 --> 03:25:36,057
One of the nurses that sort of on the proposed cuts is a high school nurse.

2043
03:25:36,417 --> 03:25:44,144
We also have a high school nurse will be on maternity leave in the fall, which means one next high school nurse in that office, and having to bring people up from other offices and move people around.

2044
03:25:44,324 --> 03:25:48,908
So when we talk about a one nurse at the box or 1.5 here, those people are going to get shifted.

2045
03:25:50,750 --> 03:25:55,438
The Brooks, one school nurse proposed, sees almost 90 visits a day.

2046
03:25:56,480 --> 03:26:00,085
I don't know how one school nurse could see 90 visits in one day.

2047
03:26:00,166 --> 03:26:00,807
That's impossible.

2048
03:26:02,372 --> 03:26:12,940
Quick story, last week we had a situation in one of our buildings where one student was exhibiting signs of a seizure, while at the same time another student with diabetes was having a hypoglycemic episode, which means they were having really low blood sugar.

2049
03:26:13,901 --> 03:26:19,706
Both of these could have resulted in two emergencies, but luckily there were two nurses in the building who could manage both emergencies while they were happening.

2050
03:26:20,687 --> 03:26:24,910
If there was only one nurse available, that nurse would have to decide which student to care for.

2051
03:26:24,930 --> 03:26:27,533
I don't think any parent wants us to make that decision.

2052
03:26:30,546 --> 03:26:35,729
If there had been one nurse, one of those would have truly resulted in a medical emergency that honestly could have resulted in death.

2053
03:26:36,050 --> 03:26:39,031
Seizures, hypoglycemia, those are medical emergencies.

2054
03:26:39,072 --> 03:26:41,193
We need nurses on staff to manage those emergencies.

2055
03:26:42,434 --> 03:26:47,617
So I urge you not to pass this budget as is, find a way to keep approaching staffing, and remember that safe staffing, safe lives.

2056
03:26:47,637 --> 03:26:54,702
Thank you.

2057
03:26:54,742 --> 03:26:56,663
Can you name an address for the record?

2058
03:26:58,080 --> 03:26:59,020
Hi, I'm Theodore Norton.

2059
03:26:59,381 --> 03:27:01,321
I live at 9th Avenue Street.

2060
03:27:01,381 --> 03:27:07,103
Superintendent Edward Vincent, at the start of this meeting, you said that the student experience at Medford High would not be affected by the budget cuts.

2061
03:27:07,764 --> 03:27:09,864
Anyone with a brain can tell you that is a blatant lie.

2062
03:27:10,645 --> 03:27:15,707
With the help of a performing arts director, the Drama Club provides the best show in recent, in my memories, history with Mamma Mia.

2063
03:27:16,407 --> 03:27:22,009
The band, with their trophies, has won a myriad of awards across the last, you know, four years of me being here, with the help of Ms.

2064
03:27:22,029 --> 03:27:22,329
Rello.

2065
03:27:23,149 --> 03:27:27,051
The loss of this position, along with every other position being cut, will set Medford back years.

2066
03:27:27,751 --> 03:27:32,255
Classes are already overcrowded, and at every level of schooling, teachers and faculty are ridiculously overworked.

2067
03:27:32,775 --> 03:27:39,641
I'm an AP student, a class that thrives on individual attention from teachers and small class sizes for discussion and growth of individual students.

2068
03:27:40,262 --> 03:27:44,685
One of the AP English classes in my year has 29 students, one less than the required maximum.

2069
03:27:45,106 --> 03:27:47,908
That is not a safe place to foster a good learning environment.

2070
03:27:48,409 --> 03:27:52,692
Cutting these members will only ruin these classes more and take away from individual student attention.

2071
03:27:53,213 --> 03:27:55,515
To quote Nicole Branley, we are barely surviving.

2072
03:27:56,175 --> 03:27:58,757
These budget cuts will rip the heart and soul of Medford out.

2073
03:27:59,458 --> 03:28:07,244
Furthermore, in my four years at Medford High, I have never seen you once sit in on a class, talk to a teacher or faculty member, or talk to a student.

2074
03:28:07,644 --> 03:28:14,290
If you want to make these cuts, please know who you're talking to, make a connection, speak to anyone, I beg of you.

2075
03:28:15,191 --> 03:28:15,491
Thank you.

2076
03:28:15,511 --> 03:28:17,472
Thank you.

2077
03:28:20,585 --> 03:28:21,846
Your name and address for the record.

2078
03:28:21,866 --> 03:28:26,168
Hi, Stephanie Lomansky, 37, Hicks Avenue, Massachusetts.

2079
03:28:26,789 --> 03:28:27,329
Good evening.

2080
03:28:27,849 --> 03:28:31,391
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak tonight on the proposed school budget.

2081
03:28:32,512 --> 03:28:33,432
We are the Mississippi.

2082
03:28:34,113 --> 03:28:40,917
We are here tonight to talk to you about how cutting five teaching positions will impact our school and our students.

2083
03:28:41,597 --> 03:28:42,658
We love our students.

2084
03:28:43,298 --> 03:28:44,599
Our students are the future.

2085
03:28:45,379 --> 03:28:46,520
Our students are priceless.

2086
03:28:47,733 --> 03:29:08,608
While we understand the complexities around the school budget deficit, cutting five teaching positions from one elementary school, an elementary school that is currently in search of a new principal, with all of these changes on the horizon for our student population, we're asking you to rethink this very unwise decision.

2087
03:29:10,189 --> 03:29:14,251
Let's strive to do what is right for the Missituck Elementary students.

2088
03:29:14,892 --> 03:29:15,212
Thank you.

2089
03:29:21,652 --> 03:29:23,034
You name and address for the record?

2090
03:29:23,254 --> 03:29:23,374
Yes.

2091
03:29:23,474 --> 03:29:25,477
Paula Burke, 37 Hicks Avenue, Medford.

2092
03:29:26,298 --> 03:29:30,162
Good evening, Superintendent, Chair, and Mayor.

2093
03:29:30,222 --> 03:29:32,825
Thank you for giving us this opportunity to speak this evening.

2094
03:29:35,507 --> 03:29:39,868
I'm speaking on behalf of the teachers, the families, and the students of Medford.

2095
03:29:40,008 --> 03:29:41,108
I actually grew up in Medford.

2096
03:29:41,129 --> 03:29:48,290
I am a former graduate of Medford High School, and currently I'm a first grade teacher with over 24 years of service to our city.

2097
03:29:48,310 --> 03:29:50,711
And there'll always be a budget to balance.

2098
03:29:51,071 --> 03:29:52,892
Above all, it takes knowledge and good judgment.

2099
03:29:53,252 --> 03:29:56,453
The original proposed budget, if it's passed,

2100
03:29:58,213 --> 03:30:03,995
that proposes these cuts to our school department, especially the Miss Tech School will affect us in the following ways.

2101
03:30:04,915 --> 03:30:09,976
We'll have bigger class sizes that will affect our social and emotional needs of our most needy children.

2102
03:30:10,577 --> 03:30:18,439
Since the pandemic Medfin made it a priority to support all students with enough educators and programs in the schools to address their needs.

2103
03:30:19,219 --> 03:30:23,663
These cuts will not allow for these programs and teachers to continue to provide this support.

2104
03:30:24,303 --> 03:30:30,629
The Missitech school will be impacted the most by these cuts which also includes the therapeutic learning program as well as the newcomers.

2105
03:30:31,730 --> 03:30:40,418
We can all agree that the early elementary years are very important years that as we are building these necessary foundational skills for learning in life.

2106
03:30:41,018 --> 03:30:55,987
Research shows that having large class sizes impacts the students in many ways, including less individualized support for students, overpopulated classrooms can cause more anxiety in children, and is a challenge to provide consistent communication with families.

2107
03:30:56,767 --> 03:31:00,109
Please put yourself in these little shoes of our youngest population.

2108
03:31:00,149 --> 03:31:04,392
Make a decision, put them first when making important decisions with our school budget.

2109
03:31:04,472 --> 03:31:05,152
Thank you so much.

2110
03:31:05,553 --> 03:31:05,873
Thank you.

2111
03:31:14,234 --> 03:31:20,698
I'm also a teacher at the computer technology teacher here to represent the specialist.

2112
03:31:21,739 --> 03:31:32,006
If this proposed budget doesn't pass and class sizes are adjusted to 22 plus, most classes will be even larger with the push in of the TLP and the EL newcomers.

2113
03:31:32,566 --> 03:31:36,169
Making our classes maxed out for individualized teacher support

2114
03:31:36,789 --> 03:31:45,297
student engagement, access to all, all the materials, and not to mention the physical space, which for some classrooms is already at capacity.

2115
03:31:46,338 --> 03:31:56,408
Currently, we are able to provide that individualized support and attention to those that need as well as engage with students on a one-to-one basis at some point during

2116
03:31:57,269 --> 03:31:57,770
the class.

2117
03:31:58,050 --> 03:32:01,754
As specialists, we service the whole school for only five minutes each week.

2118
03:32:02,334 --> 03:32:11,624
Having smaller class sizes enables us to cultivate engaging, interactive lessons and meet all student needs even at the Mesa Tuck.

2119
03:32:11,985 --> 03:32:12,345
Thank you.

2120
03:32:12,645 --> 03:32:12,986
Thank you.

2121
03:32:19,174 --> 03:32:20,255
Can you name and address for the record?

2122
03:32:21,495 --> 03:32:23,616
Kathleen Fader, 37 Hicks Ave.

2123
03:32:24,737 --> 03:32:26,218
So my name is, can you hear me?

2124
03:32:26,318 --> 03:32:29,860
My name is Kathleen Fader, and I'm a School Adjustment Counselor at the Missitech.

2125
03:32:30,560 --> 03:32:32,822
I've been at the Missitech and with the district for six years now.

2126
03:32:33,562 --> 03:32:35,623
I'm here to speak on behalf of the therapeutic group.

2127
03:32:36,043 --> 03:32:40,366
We believe our students will be negatively impacted by the proposed teacher position cuts to the building.

2128
03:32:41,146 --> 03:32:47,390
This year, over 25% of the Missitech student population has been individually supported by one of the therapeutic staff members.

2129
03:32:48,130 --> 03:32:59,275
On top of our 25% identified caseload, we also provide many more with in-the-moment counseling, crisis response, and or social-emotional regulation, and teacher consultation.

2130
03:33:00,595 --> 03:33:06,358
The students we serve require social-emotional accommodations and supports to be implemented in the classroom by those teachers.

2131
03:33:07,521 --> 03:33:17,467
These accommodations can vary and may include reinforcement systems, break schedules, specific communication plans for families, specific engagement strategies with each student.

2132
03:33:18,227 --> 03:33:21,829
Our success hinges on the hard work of the teachers to implement these for our students.

2133
03:33:22,530 --> 03:33:24,791
We have an extremely strong teaching team at Missittuck.

2134
03:33:25,211 --> 03:33:28,493
They are relentless in their willingness to support all aspects of our students.

2135
03:33:29,073 --> 03:33:36,558
They are constantly seeking our insight, our ideas, our expertise to make sure every single Missittuck student is given everything they need to succeed.

2136
03:33:37,318 --> 03:33:48,628
The current plan to cut positions will directly impact the ability of our amazing teachers to do the exceptional work they do, ultimately impacting the social emotional well being and learning for our students.

2137
03:33:49,229 --> 03:33:49,529
Thank you.

2138
03:33:49,869 --> 03:33:50,210
Thank you.

2139
03:33:58,821 --> 03:34:04,563
I am a special educator in the therapeutic learning program at the Missittuck School in my fourth year.

2140
03:34:05,563 --> 03:34:17,986
With all the challenges our students and our staff face throughout the school day, one of the most rewarding experiences for the TLP staff is seeing our students flourish and thrive in general education inclusion.

2141
03:34:19,364 --> 03:34:27,391
Many of our students use the skills they gain in the TLP to rejoin their general education peers.

2142
03:34:27,411 --> 03:34:32,795
30% of our program currently includes in general education classes and are not on those rosters.

2143
03:34:34,036 --> 03:34:38,159
When there's more students including in your room, there are more challenges.

2144
03:34:38,580 --> 03:34:45,105
There are more voices that need to be heard, more accommodations that needed to be provided and consults that need to be attended.

2145
03:34:46,709 --> 03:34:54,093
What I've found working at the Messatech Elementary School when I go to a grade level meeting is that our students are welcomed with open arms.

2146
03:34:54,854 --> 03:35:01,457
Teachers work with our staff to learn what our students need and how they can work collaboratively as a team.

2147
03:35:02,358 --> 03:35:11,223
When we choose classrooms for our students to include in, we look at things like class sizes, student need already in the classroom and best fit.

2148
03:35:12,180 --> 03:35:18,164
The best fit is smaller class sizes where teachers can give the students the time and energy they need.

2149
03:35:19,045 --> 03:35:26,751
When a student in the TLP is in a classroom for one hour or two, the attention from the teacher that they receive is vital.

2150
03:35:27,912 --> 03:35:33,836
During these times, teachers are providing accommodations not only academically, but behaviorally as well.

2151
03:35:35,180 --> 03:35:43,623
With increased class sizes, we're not considering the students who are not on those rosters, like our newcomer and therapeutic students.

2152
03:35:44,544 --> 03:35:50,666
Our gen ed teachers treat all of the students in their building as their own and welcome everyone as they walk through the door.

2153
03:35:51,987 --> 03:35:57,049
Teachers meet these needs when they have the time and the ability and the resources to do so.

2154
03:35:57,789 --> 03:36:02,951
We are taking away resources from our district's most vulnerable students.

2155
03:36:04,877 --> 03:36:14,342
I was recently asked what the most important piece of the Missittuck school is, and that is the fierceness of our teachers and how we fight for our students.

2156
03:36:14,843 --> 03:36:16,284
And that's what we're doing right now.

2157
03:36:23,027 --> 03:36:30,852
I urge you to consider how these cuts will affect our most vulnerable students in every piece of their day.

2158
03:36:31,072 --> 03:36:31,392
Thank you.

2159
03:36:35,860 --> 03:36:37,104
Your name and address will be recorded.

2160
03:36:37,986 --> 03:36:41,697
Hi there, Kathleen Kay, I'm the present principal at the Miss Tuck Elementary School.

2161
03:36:42,363 --> 03:36:46,845
And I'm here tonight before you, thank you for listening to us and hearing our thoughts and ideas.

2162
03:36:47,386 --> 03:36:50,928
But I'm basically here to support the staff because they are wonderful.

2163
03:36:51,128 --> 03:36:56,931
They really are truly, truly, and I think anything I'm gonna say right now, they've said better than I have.

2164
03:36:57,631 --> 03:37:03,854
And I'm not surprised because that's how wonderful they are, collectively, individually, as educators.

2165
03:37:04,535 --> 03:37:05,895
And I've seen them for 12 years.

2166
03:37:06,976 --> 03:37:12,860
And I've watched them grow, I've watched them come together, and collaboratively, it's really a great place to work.

2167
03:37:12,920 --> 03:37:15,381
The Mississauga really is Medford's hidden gem.

2168
03:37:15,902 --> 03:37:19,344
And I've been here for 12 years, so I think I have the right to say that.

2169
03:37:19,604 --> 03:37:22,926
Maybe I don't, but it's my bias, but I feel that.

2170
03:37:23,026 --> 03:37:33,293
But I think what's important is, first of all, our adjustment counselors do sometimes teach classes, because that was brought up before, and I think it was said that they don't, but they do at the Mississauga.

2171
03:37:34,283 --> 03:37:37,104
The other thing is, I just wanted to give some numbers.

2172
03:37:37,685 --> 03:37:43,227
And I know that the McGlynn also has the EL newcomer group, but they don't have the TLP.

2173
03:37:43,827 --> 03:37:45,648
And that's the therapeutic learning program.

2174
03:37:45,728 --> 03:37:47,869
And they do, they're lovely children.

2175
03:37:47,949 --> 03:37:52,952
And as the teacher said, they're welcomed with open arms, but they do require a little bit more manpower.

2176
03:37:53,592 --> 03:38:02,596
And so looking at some of the proposals, if we go down to two, pretty much except for kindergarten, because we don't know who the EL newcomers will be, and they're all new.

2177
03:38:04,095 --> 03:38:19,422
Every class what I've done with the numbers that I have is once they go to their specialists, there's going to be at least 27 to 28 kids in that specialist class, many of whom do not speak English at all as a first language, and also one or two.

2178
03:38:20,362 --> 03:38:24,226
of those TLP kids, because on some of the grade levels, there's only going to be two classes.

2179
03:38:24,866 --> 03:38:38,119
And as you well know, when you do placements and we try, like Julia, I believe, had said, that we want to do the best balance we can for the kids so that they're getting the best education and the teachers are able to give that to them.

2180
03:38:38,920 --> 03:38:44,545
And when you add children into these classes that don't speak English, they want to be part of the group.

2181
03:38:45,066 --> 03:38:54,795
But sometimes when there's not enough teacher ability to help them, then they kind of hang by themselves, and they don't really get fully what they need in those specialist classes.

2182
03:38:55,540 --> 03:38:58,624
Now you add the TLP that bring their own challenges.

2183
03:38:59,105 --> 03:39:00,968
And like I said, they're welcome with open arms.

2184
03:39:01,308 --> 03:39:06,716
But I just do worry with the larger class sizes that there will be something lost for those kids.

2185
03:39:06,976 --> 03:39:10,521
So I just want to thank you for your time and thank you for my 12 year share.

2186
03:39:10,541 --> 03:39:10,942
Thank you.

2187
03:39:10,982 --> 03:39:12,244
And thank you to my wonderful staff.

2188
03:39:24,519 --> 03:39:25,511
I think that might be.

2189
03:39:26,415 --> 03:39:27,635
Can you name and address for the record, please?

2190
03:39:27,675 --> 03:39:30,056
Hi, I'm Tara Hennessy, 59 Bowdoin Street.

2191
03:39:30,176 --> 03:39:35,498
I think you all received my nice, long email that I sent earlier this week.

2192
03:39:36,638 --> 03:39:41,040
Obviously, my children go to the Mississippi, so I have one in fourth grade in Ms.

2193
03:39:41,060 --> 03:39:43,181
Schrammowitz's class, one in kindergarten in Ms.

2194
03:39:43,221 --> 03:39:44,021
Penta's class.

2195
03:39:44,421 --> 03:39:45,381
Sorry about my voice.

2196
03:39:45,862 --> 03:39:54,064
I'm also the PTO president and have luckily served on the PTO for the past four years now.

2197
03:39:56,145 --> 03:40:04,528
One of the things, and I think all of these teachers have said it so much better than I could have, about the welcoming and about the community.

2198
03:40:05,029 --> 03:40:11,591
That's one word that I think they didn't say, but is so important about the Mississaugas, and that's community.

2199
03:40:11,611 --> 03:40:18,054
I think each one of them, I knew something about their personal lives, and they knew something about mine and my children's as well.

2200
03:40:18,874 --> 03:40:21,536
One thing I wanted to point out is that, you know, Ms.

2201
03:40:21,556 --> 03:40:30,402
Penta, she has 16 kids in her class, of which some were EL students, but we wouldn't know and identify them in the kindergarten yet.

2202
03:40:31,182 --> 03:40:37,126
My son already knew how to read, how to write, how to add, how to subtract when we came into kindergarten.

2203
03:40:37,727 --> 03:40:38,727
And so what did she do?

2204
03:40:38,827 --> 03:40:42,850
She quickly noticed that, and she noticed he can help.

2205
03:40:43,831 --> 03:40:46,853
He can turn around and he can help some of these other students.

2206
03:40:48,635 --> 03:40:54,322
If there was more 22, 23, 24 in their class, would he have been identified?

2207
03:40:54,342 --> 03:40:55,744
Maybe?

2208
03:40:57,108 --> 03:40:57,588
I don't know.

2209
03:40:58,309 --> 03:41:01,391
That also happened to my younger son when he was in kindergarten.

2210
03:41:01,591 --> 03:41:05,993
That happened to be the COVID year where they got cut short, but that's okay.

2211
03:41:06,874 --> 03:41:14,699
Some of the other things I wanted to bring up, which I did bring up in my email as well, is how many of our students are on IEPs and 504s.

2212
03:41:15,419 --> 03:41:21,823
They're in our classrooms, they're being assisted with our teachers, but they're being pulled out for special services.

2213
03:41:22,804 --> 03:41:24,225
They're included in those numbers.

2214
03:41:25,384 --> 03:41:32,070
But now you're going from a class of 16 to a class of 25.

2215
03:41:32,571 --> 03:41:37,776
In fourth and fifth grade, you'll go from a class of 20 to a class of 30.

2216
03:41:38,977 --> 03:41:47,405
And then when you add in those EL students for our specialty classes or TLP students into our core curriculum, now you're jumping to 35, 36, 38.

2217
03:41:50,709 --> 03:41:52,250
in those other courses?

2218
03:41:53,271 --> 03:42:04,539
How is a specialist going to be able to notice that my child loves coding so much and is giving him extra work in her computer class because he's already done it?

2219
03:42:05,080 --> 03:42:12,005
And instead of him just sitting there twiddling his thumbs, is being given coding in third grade, now fourth grade.

2220
03:42:13,846 --> 03:42:18,770
So those are the things I want you to think about when you're thinking about cutting five teachers

2221
03:42:19,775 --> 03:42:27,461
from the Mississippi, as well as thinking about, we don't have anyone that helps out when someone is missing.

2222
03:42:28,561 --> 03:42:35,106
So someone's sick, now that specialist, instead of having that specialist class is now in the classroom.

2223
03:42:36,247 --> 03:42:43,052
So what happens then to that 36 students that are supposed to be going to that specialist, now they're still with the teacher.

2224
03:42:44,804 --> 03:42:49,546
So please think about this when you're thinking about cutting those five people from the mistletoe.

2225
03:42:49,966 --> 03:42:50,347
Thank you.

2226
03:42:50,827 --> 03:42:51,227
Thank you.

2227
03:42:54,368 --> 03:42:55,849
Your name and address for the record?

2228
03:42:56,489 --> 03:42:58,550
Jessica White, 138 Mitchell Ave.

2229
03:42:59,531 --> 03:43:01,532
I am a speech pathologist at the Brooks.

2230
03:43:02,485 --> 03:43:14,558
And I'm here representing the related services department, because I haven't really heard anyone here talking about the fact that the head of related services position has been proposed to be cut.

2231
03:43:14,578 --> 03:43:16,721
So I'm going to read a letter that we wrote.

2232
03:43:18,367 --> 03:43:22,669
As presented at the May 6 2024 initial budget proposal meeting.

2233
03:43:23,249 --> 03:43:29,432
We as a department were disheartened to learn that a special education administrator position has been eliminated.

2234
03:43:29,952 --> 03:43:34,855
It is our understanding that specifically this administrator is the coordinator of related services.

2235
03:43:35,635 --> 03:43:47,623
This is a decision that directly impacts the most vulnerable members of our school community, and we strongly urge this position be reinstated in the 2024-2025 budget update.

2236
03:43:48,444 --> 03:43:55,849
As was discussed in the May 6th meeting, our district leadership and staff are already stretched in their responsibilities.

2237
03:43:56,549 --> 03:44:11,560
Like Member Brandley pointed out in that preliminary budget hearing, without administrators who are experts in the fields they are overseeing, we risk burnout of the already overextended leadership and over-reliance on senior staff members.

2238
03:44:12,401 --> 03:44:30,650
As coordinator of related services Catherine cook works tirelessly behind the scenes to make sure our special education students have access to the assistive technology they need, as well as ensuring they are getting the support they need for their speech therapy occupational therapy physical therapy vision and hearing services.

2239
03:44:31,390 --> 03:44:34,172
We simply could not do our job without this position.

2240
03:44:34,792 --> 03:44:52,904
Whether it is making sure a nonverbal student has timely access to a working iPad with a highly specialized communication app, which is no easy technological feat in this district, or ensuring our vision impaired students have access to high quality orientation and mobility and vision specialists.

2241
03:44:54,105 --> 03:44:58,228
Catherine is behind the scenes making sure that our students are getting what they need.

2242
03:44:59,487 --> 03:45:04,552
As a certified speech language pathologist, Catherine is a related service provider herself.

2243
03:45:05,032 --> 03:45:09,276
Having a coordinator with a background in the related service field is essential.

2244
03:45:09,737 --> 03:45:13,120
This is a highly specialized field, different from teachers.

2245
03:45:13,520 --> 03:45:17,163
We are evaluated on a different DESE evaluation rubric from teachers.

2246
03:45:17,644 --> 03:45:23,669
There are no other members of the administration that have the background to effectively evaluate related service providers.

2247
03:45:24,290 --> 03:45:31,552
Having a coordinator who is an expert in the field overseeing our department ensures we can continue to deliver high quality certified.

2248
03:45:32,232 --> 03:45:41,835
Catherine stays on top of the issues facing our disciplines when providing and supports us in implementing evidence based treatment across the district while upholding IDA.

2249
03:45:42,595 --> 03:45:52,385
She understands what to look for in the quality of our therapies and what professional development we need and is a resource for us in both ethical and clinical issues.

2250
03:45:52,926 --> 03:45:58,591
We are deeply concerned about the trickle down effects of not being overseen by an expert in our field.

2251
03:45:59,352 --> 03:46:19,989
As a speech-language pathologist, speech-language pathology assistants, occupational therapist, occupational therapy assistants, physical therapist, physical therapy assistants, teacher of the deaf, teacher of the visually impaired, and orientation and mobility specialist of the Medford Public Schools, we simply could not do our jobs effectively without a dedicated administrator.

2252
03:46:21,290 --> 03:46:31,981
In line with the district's mission of providing equity to all students, the coordinator of related services ensures that our city's most vulnerable students get that equitable access.

2253
03:46:32,501 --> 03:46:36,666
Please reconsider reinstating the special education administrator position.

2254
03:46:37,166 --> 03:46:38,388
And I just want to add that

2255
03:46:39,789 --> 03:46:44,212
I've already stated this, but we really serve a unique role in the school.

2256
03:46:44,232 --> 03:46:50,355
And I don't think that other people really understand what our licensing requirements are.

2257
03:46:50,375 --> 03:46:54,918
And it's really important that we have someone who can help us with

2258
03:46:56,679 --> 03:47:02,222
not only following DESE regulations, but the regulations of our state and federal guidelines.

2259
03:47:03,443 --> 03:47:16,352
Additionally, Catherine makes sure that we have people from Perkins contracted to the school district to make sure that our visually impaired students have services with the TBI and the

2260
03:47:17,172 --> 03:47:19,193
orientation and mobility specialist.

2261
03:47:19,594 --> 03:47:22,876
So I think it's really important that we have someone here who can help with that.

2262
03:47:23,016 --> 03:47:29,080
I know it was mentioned earlier that we're considering looking at Medicaid reimbursement for

2263
03:47:30,440 --> 03:47:33,101
in terms of having more resources for the school.

2264
03:47:33,761 --> 03:47:40,284
Related service providers are able to bill for Medicaid services, and it's quite complicated.

2265
03:47:40,344 --> 03:47:42,285
We've been trying to figure it out for a while.

2266
03:47:42,425 --> 03:47:49,107
I think it would be helpful if we had somebody who understood our roles and responsibilities who could help us with that.

2267
03:47:49,947 --> 03:47:50,348
Thank you.

2268
03:47:50,568 --> 03:47:50,888
Thank you.

2269
03:47:59,992 --> 03:48:01,812
Hi there.

2270
03:48:01,852 --> 03:48:03,693
Hello, my name is Simon.

2271
03:48:05,373 --> 03:48:11,395
I live on 38 Corey Street and I'm a third grade student at the Mississippi Elementary School.

2272
03:48:11,835 --> 03:48:27,959
I think cutting the teachers is a bad idea because I think having more students would make it harder to learn and because I would miss my teachers who helped me throughout the years.

2273
03:48:29,809 --> 03:48:30,950
Thank you, Simon.

2274
03:48:42,657 --> 03:48:44,919
Proud to follow your name and address for the record.

2275
03:48:44,939 --> 03:48:46,940
I want to say I'm very proud of you, Simon.

2276
03:48:46,960 --> 03:48:47,840
That was amazing.

2277
03:48:48,241 --> 03:48:50,782
I'm Christina McGordy, 24 North Street.

2278
03:48:51,683 --> 03:48:57,006
I wasn't going to say anything because I feel like the principal and the teachers and the specialists that spoke up

2279
03:48:58,647 --> 03:49:04,974
on behalf of advocating against the cuts at the Mississippi really covered all the, you know, a lot of important points.

2280
03:49:05,835 --> 03:49:15,845
But I wanted to speak just because since I'm here, I want to urge the mayor to please, please advocate or allocate more money to the school budget.

2281
03:49:16,406 --> 03:49:18,908
And please, please move forward with that prop two and a half.

2282
03:49:19,069 --> 03:49:20,730
I remember sitting here last year,

2283
03:49:21,491 --> 03:49:31,339
And other years, and last year we were talking about it was gonna come to the 2024 budget, and it was going to be worse.

2284
03:49:32,020 --> 03:49:35,803
And the only way we can break the cycle is to get more money.

2285
03:49:36,323 --> 03:49:41,627
I don't wanna see any of these things cuts, but I do wanna talk about the Mississippi.

2286
03:49:41,687 --> 03:49:48,393
I think cutting five, really six full-time educators when you include the kindergarten, it's not feasible.

2287
03:49:49,954 --> 03:50:00,506
I was pulled into subbing at the mist attack, because over the years of being in the PTO and working in the after school clubs and getting to show the kids.

2288
03:50:01,026 --> 03:50:03,249
I fell in love with the kids of the mist attack.

2289
03:50:04,030 --> 03:50:05,591
And it's a great community.

2290
03:50:07,373 --> 03:50:14,035
I can say that when I have been subbing, I did two long term positions this year.

2291
03:50:14,575 --> 03:50:17,476
One was a class of 20 and one was a class of 14.

2292
03:50:18,097 --> 03:50:23,538
And in that class of 20, it was the hardest 12 weeks of my life.

2293
03:50:24,278 --> 03:50:26,399
And it's not even funny.

2294
03:50:27,239 --> 03:50:28,720
It was really just

2295
03:50:29,080 --> 03:50:34,303
you know, there is not enough in Medford just to really service the needs of these kids.

2296
03:50:34,343 --> 03:50:43,987
You have kids who need social, emotional help and, you know, there are not enough people to like serve them because they're tied up in crisis.

2297
03:50:44,608 --> 03:50:54,113
But just having, you know, when you look at the numbers and you're like, oh, okay, these all come out looking around the same, but you really have to think about, you know, equity and not equality.

2298
03:50:55,433 --> 03:51:00,396
Looking at the data from all the different schools, we have 60% high needs.

2299
03:51:00,436 --> 03:51:07,560
So 22 students in your class, where you have a school with a higher percentage of high needs, you have more high needs kids in your class.

2300
03:51:07,620 --> 03:51:11,242
And like they talked about, we have more kids pulled in.

2301
03:51:11,262 --> 03:51:13,424
So that 22 isn't really accurate.

2302
03:51:14,484 --> 03:51:17,446
So we need more funds.

2303
03:51:17,846 --> 03:51:19,547
We need to keep all our teachers.

2304
03:51:19,908 --> 03:51:22,189
We need more than what we currently have.

2305
03:51:22,809 --> 03:51:37,816
We need to pay subs, like I said, I went to sub because I was so sad hearing so many teachers losing their preps and so many specialists having to do other jobs and not serve their kids.

2306
03:51:37,836 --> 03:51:44,699
So we need more if we really wanna get to where we're thriving and not just scraping by.

2307
03:51:45,080 --> 03:51:47,261
We're scraping by now with these cuts.

2308
03:51:48,201 --> 03:51:48,822
It's worse.

2309
03:51:49,302 --> 03:51:53,565
And yes, come in, shadow people, see what the reality is.

2310
03:51:53,625 --> 03:51:59,870
I'm speaking to the superintendent and the people who look at what cuts can be made.

2311
03:52:00,090 --> 03:52:00,750
Come see.

2312
03:52:01,491 --> 03:52:04,893
And I'm not saying that in trying to be defensive.

2313
03:52:04,953 --> 03:52:05,454
It's true.

2314
03:52:05,634 --> 03:52:11,078
I think there's a big disconnect when you don't spend every day in the school.

2315
03:52:11,238 --> 03:52:12,058
But that's all.

2316
03:52:12,099 --> 03:52:12,559
Thank you.

2317
03:52:13,059 --> 03:52:13,780
Thank you, Christina.

2318
03:52:19,530 --> 03:52:28,335
Hi, I'm Anthony Guillaume, I live at 45 Elm Hill Avenue in Leamington, Massachusetts, and I'm the president of the Medford Teachers Association.

2319
03:52:29,175 --> 03:52:31,617
I tried to bribe Simon to let me go first, but he wouldn't take it.

2320
03:52:34,424 --> 03:52:44,506
Quick indulgence, I wanna say that this time of the year is really hard to teach in between the weather getting nicer, budget season, closing finals, MCAS, all that.

2321
03:52:44,566 --> 03:52:52,308
So I just wanna say to see so many of my students here, a few of my students behind this back, and all the members who came out to do this, this reinvigorates me.

2322
03:52:52,768 --> 03:53:00,910
So I'd just like to say thank you and I'm proud of all of you.

2323
03:53:02,628 --> 03:53:07,674
And to be directed like just put my full support behind the budget that's currently on the floor of the level budget.

2324
03:53:08,575 --> 03:53:12,961
And to push this is not a radical budget, this is not a progressive budget, this is what we have now.

2325
03:53:14,042 --> 03:53:17,005
This is not to change things, this is to keep things as they are.

2326
03:53:18,572 --> 03:53:23,075
The changes that were recommended before would leave us in shambles.

2327
03:53:24,736 --> 03:53:41,648
Guidance counselors at the middle schools come to mind first, the guidance counselors have a special set of skills, and we can have adjustment counselors, the adjustment counselors are extremely important, but guidance counselors help with class placement, they have help with social emotional, and if you only have one guidance counselor per school, sickness happens.

2328
03:53:42,477 --> 03:53:46,042
One gets sick, you're all of a sudden getting another position to cover the guidance council's position.

2329
03:53:46,783 --> 03:53:48,625
So it's not feasible.

2330
03:53:52,238 --> 03:53:55,200
We had a presentation today that basically said, MHS is trending in the right direction.

2331
03:53:55,541 --> 03:53:58,183
And I've been in MHS for seven years now.

2332
03:53:58,983 --> 03:54:08,130
And while I am impressed with it, what Principal Cabral has done is she has implemented the staff we have to make it run better.

2333
03:54:08,791 --> 03:54:13,494
And to say, you're doing well, now do better with less, isn't reasonable.

2334
03:54:14,635 --> 03:54:20,620
So to congratulate the high school and then to cut six positions from it, doesn't seem to make much sense.

2335
03:54:23,842 --> 03:54:33,264
We had the last meeting, we had it said that the administrative assistant said when she goes to lunch, she has to close the office.

2336
03:54:33,944 --> 03:54:38,085
So all of this talk of like, we need information, we need the schools to run smoothly, we need this.

2337
03:54:38,886 --> 03:54:42,426
If you cut staff, eventually there's not gonna be somebody in that office to answer the phone.

2338
03:54:42,586 --> 03:54:44,867
And if that phone calls an emergency, we're gonna be out of luck.

2339
03:54:46,761 --> 03:54:51,303
There's a lot of numbers being thrown around about what is the ratio of counselors to students.

2340
03:54:52,223 --> 03:54:57,625
I'm gonna trust the American School Counselor Association, which is made of school counselors, run by school counselors.

2341
03:54:57,665 --> 03:55:01,067
They recommend a ratio of 250 students per school counselor.

2342
03:55:03,548 --> 03:55:11,291
As far as the voter program and as far as it having low numbers, there are restrictions on the way things are scheduled as the schedule currently stands.

2343
03:55:11,371 --> 03:55:13,612
We also ran this for a year, right?

2344
03:55:14,675 --> 03:55:18,357
Yes, students pick classes based off of their interest.

2345
03:55:18,397 --> 03:55:20,858
They also pick classes based off of the recommendation of their friends.

2346
03:55:21,538 --> 03:55:22,858
So we basically ran this for one year.

2347
03:55:22,878 --> 03:55:25,980
We had two teachers in the position, so we had no stability.

2348
03:55:26,700 --> 03:55:28,941
And now we're saying, well, nobody wants to take it this year.

2349
03:55:28,981 --> 03:55:35,344
But again, if you run anything free, you don't have the stability of a singular teacher to sort of make that recommendation.

2350
03:55:35,384 --> 03:55:36,804
You're not going to get student entry.

2351
03:55:36,824 --> 03:55:37,845
You have to run it for a while.

2352
03:55:38,988 --> 03:55:47,808
And the idea that we have the drama club in the budget ignores the fact we don't have somebody assigned to that it is a stipend that somebody has to.

2353
03:55:49,717 --> 03:55:50,377
volunteer into.

2354
03:55:51,057 --> 03:55:58,042
And I've had a lot of experience talking to teachers who have done the drama club and talk about the labor that they put into it and how labor intensive it is.

2355
03:55:58,963 --> 03:56:08,550
So if we want someone to run the drama club, but we also want to cut down on staff and make the job harder, no one's going to take that position because they're going to have to focus on what they contractually have to do.

2356
03:56:11,863 --> 03:56:18,907
And almost every award and congratulations given tonight before the budget talk is based off of a statement of volunteer position that one of my members takes.

2357
03:56:20,068 --> 03:56:26,492
And there is a limited amount of time, a limited amount of energy that a member has to do this.

2358
03:56:26,712 --> 03:56:28,113
They want to do it, they love it.

2359
03:56:28,613 --> 03:56:32,796
I ran a club for four years before I had to stop because of budgetary reasons.

2360
03:56:33,839 --> 03:56:45,222
So I just wanna say that like for all the awards we're giving out and for all the thanks we're giving and for all the celebration of these students, it's really based off of teachers who are willing to take it on.

2361
03:56:45,462 --> 03:56:50,624
And if we increase their load now, they're not gonna take it on later and we're gonna lose these things.

2362
03:56:50,904 --> 03:57:00,126
So again, I support the level budget and I ask the mayor and city council, I'll be there tomorrow and I ask that this be funded fully.

2363
03:57:00,426 --> 03:57:00,727
Thank you.

2364
03:57:01,007 --> 03:57:01,627
Thank you, Anthony.

2365
03:57:06,418 --> 03:57:08,921
Good evening.

2366
03:57:09,141 --> 03:57:10,962
Lily Scott, 30 College Avenue.

2367
03:57:12,204 --> 03:57:19,050
I wasn't planning on getting up to speak tonight, but hearing that the Missituck could lose five teachers was a real punch to the gut.

2368
03:57:20,391 --> 03:57:24,835
I'm the mother of a current first grade student at the Missituck and an incoming kindergartner.

2369
03:57:25,836 --> 03:57:29,659
Our experience at the Missituck has been incredible over the last two years.

2370
03:57:30,890 --> 03:57:41,012
The community that they teach, many of whom are here today, the admins, also present, the parents and the students, has been amazingly impressive.

2371
03:57:42,183 --> 03:57:48,671
I know everyone here wants what is best for our students, and these are really tough conversations that no one wants to have.

2372
03:57:49,612 --> 03:57:54,037
I personally agree with you, committee member Rosso, about needing to raise taxes.

2373
03:57:55,399 --> 03:58:00,444
It's embarrassing that we've grown so much as a city but haven't seemed to be able to harness the commensurate revenue.

2374
03:58:01,925 --> 03:58:08,009
However, I don't think it's possible to understand the full picture by looking solely at student-teacher ratios.

2375
03:58:09,630 --> 03:58:14,674
As someone who accompanied the first grade class on their field trip last week, thank you, Ms.

2376
03:58:14,714 --> 03:58:23,659
Atakpiteo, I bore witness to the incredible challenges that our teachers in Paris deal with every day, including having to physically restrain a student.

2377
03:58:25,340 --> 03:58:33,183
The Missitech supports populations of students that needs lots of extra help, and we know what happens when there's less individualized support for these students.

2378
03:58:33,623 --> 03:58:34,583
Everyone loses.

2379
03:58:35,564 --> 03:58:44,046
Our elementary schools set the path for academic success for our students' careers for the rest of their lives, and let's not cut them down before they even get a chance to start.

2380
03:58:44,787 --> 03:58:45,127
Thank you.

2381
03:58:51,266 --> 03:58:52,387
We need an address for the record.

2382
03:58:52,407 --> 03:58:58,392
I'm Michelle Whalen, Pembroke Street, president of the Medford Marching Band Parent Association organization.

2383
03:58:59,152 --> 03:58:59,813
Oh, wait a minute.

2384
03:58:59,893 --> 03:59:00,513
I need these.

2385
03:59:01,614 --> 03:59:06,658
Okay, like you, Member Brinley, I can't read without having it written down either.

2386
03:59:07,238 --> 03:59:18,127
So as members of the Medford Band Parent Organization, both past and present in the room here tonight, we'd like to address the assumption that the extracurricular activities of Marching Band Color Guard and Winter Guard will

2387
03:59:20,547 --> 03:59:26,190
continue with the enthusiastic support of the district.

2388
03:59:27,171 --> 03:59:37,376
The Medford Banned Parent Organization has and will always continue to fully fund the programs that these kids put on every single year.

2389
03:59:37,416 --> 03:59:38,097
You all know it.

2390
03:59:38,177 --> 03:59:39,798
We come out to you for fundraising.

2391
03:59:40,078 --> 03:59:42,579
We ask you to place ads in our program books.

2392
03:59:44,100 --> 03:59:44,840
It's not easy.

2393
03:59:44,860 --> 03:59:48,963
I would not be able to do your job, however,

2394
03:59:50,628 --> 03:59:53,030
Our kids are the ones that are losing here.

2395
03:59:54,931 --> 04:00:02,156
If Mrs. Relo's position of coordinator of performing arts is completely eliminated, that's exactly what you're doing.

2396
04:00:02,396 --> 04:00:04,397
You're taking away the pride and power of these kids.

2397
04:00:05,638 --> 04:00:07,339
There's nothing left for them.

2398
04:00:08,780 --> 04:00:14,104
To have it as an extracurricular activity, it's funded by a stipend, that's right.

2399
04:00:14,364 --> 04:00:15,805
Mr. Crowley brought that up earlier.

2400
04:00:16,408 --> 04:00:21,291
283 volunteer hours is done by that stipend position.

2401
04:00:22,231 --> 04:00:28,535
So I ask you, if we don't have that coordinator performing arts position, who are we gonna have?

2402
04:00:29,556 --> 04:00:30,636
Do you have somebody in place?

2403
04:00:31,116 --> 04:00:33,298
These kids have spring band camp in one month from today.

2404
04:00:34,719 --> 04:00:36,540
Do you know who is going to take on that role?

2405
04:00:37,620 --> 04:00:38,681
I don't think anybody is.

2406
04:00:40,222 --> 04:00:45,945
I'll continue with, this is hard.

2407
04:00:46,768 --> 04:00:48,569
I am a band parent for a life.

2408
04:00:49,650 --> 04:00:52,532
My oldest child joined in 2012 when the band first started.

2409
04:00:53,133 --> 04:00:56,135
My 13 year old now has been a member for three years.

2410
04:00:56,756 --> 04:01:04,962
And just to think that the possibility of that extracurricular activity is not gonna be available to him, that's disheartening.

2411
04:01:06,923 --> 04:01:13,728
I would like to bring up, I think we'd like to know how the,

2412
04:01:16,732 --> 04:01:21,156
current two coordinator positions were absorbed into one.

2413
04:01:22,057 --> 04:01:25,681
How was that decision made and what was the process?

2414
04:01:26,361 --> 04:01:35,350
Did these two coordinators of arts have a application process or was it just deemed that one was better than the other?

2415
04:01:40,642 --> 04:01:57,519
If I may say on the floor, not getting into specifics, both candidates that are currently in the room are highly qualified artists in different venues or different domains.

2416
04:01:58,880 --> 04:02:13,263
In the past, when we had an arts role, it was one position, and that person oversaw all arts programming, both fine arts and performing arts.

2417
04:02:14,103 --> 04:02:24,045
When we had the abundance of ESSER funding, we went back to the arts programming and we added two positions, so we essentially took

2418
04:02:24,925 --> 04:02:31,950
the arts, divided the arts into two sections, and brought on two coordinators.

2419
04:02:32,230 --> 04:02:38,134
So what we're doing is going back to one administrator overseeing the arts.

2420
04:02:39,354 --> 04:02:44,978
What I can say is that Miss Rallo has been with Buffett Public Schools for 14 years,

2421
04:02:46,699 --> 04:02:52,024
And the other coordinator has been at Metro Public Schools for 21 years.

2422
04:02:52,864 --> 04:02:55,967
So they are both wonderful Mustangs.

2423
04:02:56,968 --> 04:03:01,492
So we have been looking at just other pieces of data.

2424
04:03:04,514 --> 04:03:10,037
We had to make a decision, and the decisions were really, really difficult decisions that had to be made.

2425
04:03:11,037 --> 04:03:18,361
And they both have strengths in different areas, and they both value and support the arts.

2426
04:03:18,681 --> 04:03:25,864
So a decision was made, but we are not impacting arts programming.

2427
04:03:26,004 --> 04:03:31,627
I'm gonna continue to say that we're not impacting it or stopping it, because we're not cutting programs.

2428
04:03:32,985 --> 04:03:36,768
The offerings will still be the same for students.

2429
04:03:37,429 --> 04:03:54,982
If someone would choose to not do something, then we would have to open it up to the other 20 staff members that are part of the, or 19 members that are part of the arts programming to see if they would be interested in doing that.

2430
04:03:55,503 --> 04:04:01,167
So essentially you're saying that there is a possibility that there will be no competitive marching band season next year.

2431
04:04:02,618 --> 04:04:04,720
I'm not saying that, actually.

2432
04:04:04,880 --> 04:04:06,020
That is not what I'm saying.

2433
04:04:06,040 --> 04:04:06,921
Not at all.

2434
04:04:06,941 --> 04:04:10,884
So let me bring up to history of Medford Public Schools.

2435
04:04:10,904 --> 04:04:12,805
I just want to remind you that you have three minutes.

2436
04:04:13,325 --> 04:04:20,671
There's still a lot of people that need to speak, and I just want to be respectful of everyone's time.

2437
04:04:20,691 --> 04:04:29,597
So let me just end it with this, that the history of the Medford Public Schools Director of Arts has always been somebody in the music, not the visual arts.

2438
04:04:32,252 --> 04:04:43,771
It doesn't make any sense that you're going to give a director of arts position for somebody that's going to cover the performing arts who has no experience, education, or knowledge.

2439
04:04:44,312 --> 04:04:44,632
Thank you.

2440
04:04:44,993 --> 04:04:45,353
Thank you.

2441
04:05:00,724 --> 04:05:05,950
We are here to address an issue that is not only close to our hearts but vital to the fabric of our community.

2442
04:05:06,611 --> 04:05:12,038
The proposed budget cuts that jeopardize the continuity of the band program and the performing arts at our schools.

2443
04:05:12,995 --> 04:05:14,456
Bailu and I are both alumni.

2444
04:05:14,736 --> 04:05:17,957
I graduated in 2019 and Bailu in 2021.

2445
04:05:18,797 --> 04:05:23,959
I first joined band in fifth grade, inspired by my mom, who had been a part of it and encouraged me to give it a try.

2446
04:05:24,759 --> 04:05:31,341
My passion for band grew over the years, leading me to join the marching band in high school, where I served as drum major and treasurer.

2447
04:05:32,462 --> 04:05:42,525
Band has always been a way for me to connect with my mom and has become an integral part of my life, bringing me some of my closest friends and has been instrumental in forming connections throughout my adult life.

2448
04:05:44,437 --> 04:05:51,563
When I first joined the marching band in seventh grade, I was excited but nervous and wondered how I would be perceived as I was one of the youngest members that year.

2449
04:05:52,203 --> 04:05:57,708
But after the first day at band camp, despite the scorching sun, I instantly felt like I found my group of people.

2450
04:05:58,188 --> 04:06:01,731
For example, I met Megan there and now we've been friends for 10 years.

2451
04:06:02,411 --> 04:06:09,056
As my passion deepened over the years, I took on more leadership roles, ultimately serving as president during both my junior and senior years.

2452
04:06:12,078 --> 04:06:15,579
Our band director, Haley Rello, has been the cornerstone of this program.

2453
04:06:16,199 --> 04:06:23,500
Her dedication, passion, and relentless effort over the past decade have elevated the band and its accomplishments to a national level.

2454
04:06:24,260 --> 04:06:31,822
She has not only taught us how to read notes and play our instruments, but also instilled in us the values of discipline, teamwork, and perseverance.

2455
04:06:32,582 --> 04:06:38,963
Under her guidance, we learned that our success depends not just on individual talent, but on our collective effort and harmony.

2456
04:06:41,443 --> 04:06:47,948
Now faced with the possibility of budget cuts, we are at risk of losing this irreplaceable mentor and the program she has built.

2457
04:06:48,609 --> 04:06:57,416
This decision will not only impact current students, but also deprive future generations of the opportunity to experience the transformative power of the performing arts.

2458
04:06:58,136 --> 04:07:00,998
The ripple effect of this loss would be felt throughout our community.

2459
04:07:01,559 --> 04:07:07,563
Parents, families, alumni, and local supporters who have all marched alongside the band throughout the years.

2460
04:07:08,284 --> 04:07:10,706
The performing arts are more than just entertainment.

2461
04:07:11,146 --> 04:07:18,232
The arts foster creativity, critical thinking, and emotional expression, skills that are essential in every aspect of life.

2462
04:07:19,068 --> 04:07:23,830
Moreover, band and drama are often safe havens for students who may not find their place elsewhere.

2463
04:07:24,330 --> 04:07:28,432
They provide a sense of belonging and purpose, a chance to shine and to be heard.

2464
04:07:29,113 --> 04:07:33,374
Band was not merely an extracurricular activity for us, it was a safe space.

2465
04:07:33,915 --> 04:07:38,957
It was a place where we felt welcomed, valued, and truly a part of something larger than ourselves.

2466
04:07:39,697 --> 04:07:45,360
Removing these programs would strip away these safe spaces and the opportunities they provide for self-discovery and growth.

2467
04:07:47,618 --> 04:07:54,021
We stand before you today, not just as former band members, but as a testament to the profound impact this program has had.

2468
04:07:54,761 --> 04:07:58,283
We implore you to consider the far-reaching consequences of these budget cuts.

2469
04:07:58,863 --> 04:08:04,566
We must invest in our students' futures by preserving the programs that nurture their talents, their spirits, and their hearts.

2470
04:08:05,366 --> 04:08:07,328
Let us not take away the heartbeat of Medford.

2471
04:08:07,748 --> 04:08:12,071
Let us fight to keep our band director, our band, and our performing arts programs alive.

2472
04:08:12,652 --> 04:08:20,198
For the sake of our students, our community, and the legacy we leave behind, we must stand together and ensure that these vital programs continue to flourish.

2473
04:08:20,718 --> 04:08:21,098
Thank you.

2474
04:08:21,439 --> 04:08:21,839
Thank you.

2475
04:08:21,859 --> 04:08:30,386
We need an adjust for the record.

2476
04:08:31,175 --> 04:08:33,216
Rick McLaughlin, 87 West Street.

2477
04:08:33,817 --> 04:08:36,739
I'm compelled to speak with you today for three reasons.

2478
04:08:37,339 --> 04:08:45,165
The first is as the father of an alumna who was in the marching band, I've seen other things, the same things that the students have already spoken about and what other parents have spoken about.

2479
04:08:45,185 --> 04:08:49,227
So I'm not gonna, I'll just say yes to what they've said.

2480
04:08:49,628 --> 04:08:55,391
The second reason is I'm the son of a career music educator who taught music in public schools for 40 years.

2481
04:08:56,392 --> 04:08:58,754
And he told me in the 1970s that this would happen.

2482
04:08:59,234 --> 04:09:00,495
I'm going to tell you about that in a second.

2483
04:09:00,555 --> 04:09:11,301
The third reason is because as a professional musician myself and professor at the most influential school of music in the world, I've seen the power of music on four continents, both as a performer and as a clinician.

2484
04:09:12,162 --> 04:09:16,645
So my dad, he taught music in public schools for 40 years.

2485
04:09:16,665 --> 04:09:27,832
I remember in the 1970s, he told me that one day what would happen is the school committee or principals or whoever was actually managing money would cut the music program enough

2486
04:09:28,592 --> 04:09:36,139
that it just wouldn't cut it completely, just enough to let it die, which is what is happening.

2487
04:09:36,319 --> 04:09:39,562
You say that you're going to still support the arts, that's not true.

2488
04:09:40,663 --> 04:09:44,227
The impact that other people have already discussed

2489
04:09:44,987 --> 04:09:47,228
you should take to heart because it's very important.

2490
04:09:47,248 --> 04:09:57,133
But there's another element that's very important, which is the mission of the Medford Public Schools is to provide a supportive and effective educational environment that helps students successfully meet their individualized goals.

2491
04:09:57,193 --> 04:09:59,894
This will no longer be true when you cut Ms.

2492
04:09:59,914 --> 04:10:00,734
Ferrello's position.

2493
04:10:01,394 --> 04:10:04,176
By cutting her position, you will make it so that

2494
04:10:04,956 --> 04:10:07,237
Future students do not sign up for music.

2495
04:10:07,678 --> 04:10:15,422
A previous student spoke about how it's virtually impossible to do it anyway because of the ways that the scheduling conflicts prevent them from actually taking these courses.

2496
04:10:17,122 --> 04:10:20,384
M-Y-E-L-I-N, myelin.

2497
04:10:20,884 --> 04:10:31,329
That is the aspect of the brain, the neurological neuron wrapping that actually makes your brain process information more effectively and more quickly.

2498
04:10:31,989 --> 04:10:45,016
None of the things that you teach in school, none of the things Mr. Rousseau referred to earlier, English, math, science, history, I can't remember what the rest was on his list, none of those things actually improve or increase brain processing speed

2499
04:10:45,756 --> 04:10:48,317
The only thing that does is music.

2500
04:10:48,918 --> 04:10:49,718
By cutting Ms.

2501
04:10:49,778 --> 04:10:54,220
Rello's position, you no longer support the arts.

2502
04:10:54,640 --> 04:11:01,723
You also no longer support the mission of the school because you no longer support the brain health of the students who go here.

2503
04:11:02,383 --> 04:11:02,703
Thank you.

2504
04:11:03,164 --> 04:11:03,584
Thank you.

2505
04:11:03,604 --> 04:11:10,507
Do you need an address for the record?

2506
04:11:11,930 --> 04:11:12,130
Nice.

2507
04:11:12,431 --> 04:11:16,975
My name is Jerry her splits I live at 72 Wareham Street.

2508
04:11:16,995 --> 04:11:17,796
I have.

2509
04:11:17,836 --> 04:11:21,259
See, so I have a child in fourth grade at the Mississippi school.

2510
04:11:21,279 --> 04:11:28,687
I also happen to be the PTO treasurer of the Mississippi school so I understand some of these challenges with trying to balance the budget.

2511
04:11:31,027 --> 04:11:39,394
I want to mention one of the practical things of potentially larger class sizes with fewer teachers at the Missittuck next year.

2512
04:11:41,575 --> 04:11:49,362
So in my child's class this year, a class of 20, as I understand it, there are disciplinary problems in the class.

2513
04:11:50,590 --> 04:11:52,270
Teachers haven't told me about them.

2514
04:11:52,310 --> 04:11:58,531
I hear it from my child, so I don't think my child is the cause of them, but there are problems in the class.

2515
04:11:58,751 --> 04:12:02,732
And with a class of 20, as I understand it, it's close to overbearing.

2516
04:12:02,992 --> 04:12:12,594
And I can't imagine what the mix of kids would be with even larger class sizes and how the teacher would have to deal with those disciplinary problems.

2517
04:12:13,034 --> 04:12:18,595
So think about that as we're thinking about how we manage things for next year.

2518
04:12:19,455 --> 04:12:19,935
Thank you.

2519
04:12:19,975 --> 04:12:26,018
Your name and address for the record?

2520
04:12:26,978 --> 04:12:28,919
Sharon Hayes, 69 Ripley Road.

2521
04:12:28,939 --> 04:12:30,960
I think I'm more nervous on this side.

2522
04:12:30,980 --> 04:12:46,027
I'm not here to advocate for any particular position or program because as a parent, I realize that every single one of these cuts will affect my children

2523
04:12:47,132 --> 04:12:54,140
directly or indirectly immediately or in the future as a long term impact, and that's true for all of our students.

2524
04:12:56,747 --> 04:13:16,911
As a parent of an elementary school student who's at the largest school with the currently largest class size, I can echo the worries that the Missittook has about what larger class size, what the impact is on students.

2525
04:13:16,931 --> 04:13:25,993
We similarly at the Roberts in our class sizes of 20 or more, there are a bunch of classes that have some significant

2526
04:13:27,085 --> 04:13:35,412
emotional behavioral needs, ones that don't qualify for special education supports, but who need supports.

2527
04:13:35,953 --> 04:13:39,836
And as a school district, we have been lean for a very long time.

2528
04:13:40,456 --> 04:13:49,804
And so we also don't have those extra supports that a lot of other schools, other school districts might have.

2529
04:13:50,225 --> 04:13:52,647
We don't have a lot of reading specialists.

2530
04:13:52,667 --> 04:13:54,689
We don't have math specialists.

2531
04:13:56,119 --> 04:14:02,223
we don't have probably as many adjustment counselors as we need, given the needs of our students.

2532
04:14:02,863 --> 04:14:14,731
So when you then increase class sizes, and even if it's only by one, two, three students, the impact on the students, the impact on the teachers is huge.

2533
04:14:15,091 --> 04:14:20,715
And we know that across the country, and certainly in our district, teachers are burned out.

2534
04:14:21,495 --> 04:14:25,638
And if you then add to that by increasing the class sizes,

2535
04:14:26,276 --> 04:14:36,846
You know, I'm also the parent of a marching band student, orchestra student, a regular band student.

2536
04:14:37,226 --> 04:14:50,940
So I know the impact that that will have if we cut, if we cut anywhere in the performing arts, any position that's going to necessarily have a ripple effect.

2537
04:14:53,106 --> 04:14:54,566
Again, I could go through many of these.

2538
04:14:54,746 --> 04:14:56,247
One more, just I took some notes.

2539
04:14:56,707 --> 04:15:06,992
When I think of the nursing staff, I can say from personal experience where my kids were very little, both of them had some real school anxiety.

2540
04:15:07,552 --> 04:15:14,275
And when they needed a break from the classroom, where they had somatic responses to their anxiety, where did the teacher send them?

2541
04:15:14,735 --> 04:15:15,976
To a nurse's office.

2542
04:15:16,456 --> 04:15:19,938
Not because they were sick, but because that was a place they could have a break.

2543
04:15:21,690 --> 04:15:23,532
Maybe they could lie down on one of the little beds.

2544
04:15:23,932 --> 04:15:29,957
They got a little TLC from the nurses who were absolutely amazing, who would just want you to know that he's here.

2545
04:15:32,019 --> 04:15:45,650
So it kind of, as I was sitting back there, you know, my stomach started to twist just hearing people come up and, you know, everybody's fighting for the pennies and the nickels and the dimes.

2546
04:15:48,700 --> 04:16:01,302
I think we as a community, and I know I think member Graham said this earlier, and I think every school committee member said this at some point, we need to come together and decide how much do we value our educational system?

2547
04:16:01,822 --> 04:16:04,143
How much do we value our public schools?

2548
04:16:04,483 --> 04:16:11,724
And what are we willing to do to fund them to a level that meets that value that we get from them?

2549
04:16:12,324 --> 04:16:15,385
And so I hope people will take away from this not just

2550
04:16:17,415 --> 04:16:34,599
You know my my program may be cut that my child's in or, you know, something in particular my child needs is being cut, but as a whole, our school system is being decimated, which might be a little strong but we're being cut after cut after year their positions.

2551
04:16:35,046 --> 04:16:46,976
that the school committee, I can say having been on the school committee, wanted, not just wanted, but felt were really necessary to really have a high quality education for our students.

2552
04:16:47,296 --> 04:16:53,401
And they would get cut, those positions like literacy specialists would get cut very early in the budget season.

2553
04:16:55,097 --> 04:17:01,300
The people walk away from this just thinking about what do we do to make sure we have more money in the future.

2554
04:17:01,320 --> 04:17:10,485
I hope people will walk away with that because this isn't going to get solved by one program being reinstated or one teacher being reinstated.

2555
04:17:10,945 --> 04:17:12,466
This is going to, I think,

2556
04:17:14,222 --> 04:17:22,131
As member Rousseau asked and as Jerry McHugh answered, this is gonna happen again next year if we don't do something about it.

2557
04:17:22,291 --> 04:17:30,259
We're gonna be back in these meetings talking about what positions are we gonna cut now and what impact is that gonna have on our kids and our teachers.

2558
04:17:30,359 --> 04:17:34,824
So I hope people think a lot about that and think about what we need.

2559
04:17:34,844 --> 04:17:36,025
Thank you.

2560
04:17:38,007 --> 04:17:40,289
Can you name an address for the record?

2561
04:17:40,829 --> 04:17:43,231
Michelle Hardy, 59 Fourth Street.

2562
04:17:43,671 --> 04:17:45,773
I'm the Vice President of the Secretaries Union.

2563
04:17:46,193 --> 04:17:47,814
Yes, I say secretaries, I'm old school.

2564
04:17:48,655 --> 04:17:57,862
So, first I'd like to, again this week, I'd like you to reconsider the McGlynn School position for the secretaries.

2565
04:17:59,603 --> 04:18:05,708
Let's see, so they only have 192 students less than the high school invoke.

2566
04:18:07,035 --> 04:18:16,364
And the high school has the vocational secretary, the main office, and next year we'll be cutting one for the bulk.

2567
04:18:16,504 --> 04:18:23,611
So it will be two assistant principals also, because we're downgrading them too.

2568
04:18:25,255 --> 04:18:28,038
So I'd like you to reconsider that.

2569
04:18:28,719 --> 04:18:37,608
And we already have a floater, so who would the first floater, would the McGlynn School be pulled first, or would the other floater be pulled first?

2570
04:18:38,528 --> 04:18:39,409
That's one question.

2571
04:18:40,591 --> 04:18:45,556
And then, regarding the HR and payroll position,

2572
04:18:47,093 --> 04:19:00,780
We already have the Grants Manager, Kate Moscos, I'm probably killing her name, but I'm sorry, the Finance Director, Mr. McHugh, Accounting Manager, Mr. Vales, and then HR, Mrs. Camuso.

2573
04:19:02,241 --> 04:19:14,708
Any payroll work has to fall under our union, unless you're hiring two more administrators, which is kind of over the top, but I don't understand why we can't try to hire

2574
04:19:16,155 --> 04:19:25,082
To save one of our secretaries, who makes 20,000 less than this $70,000 salary you want to give to two people.

2575
04:19:25,842 --> 04:19:29,405
So just by saving one secretary, you'd be saving 90,000.

2576
04:19:34,453 --> 04:19:55,575
Okay, HR, you would have HR, I understand that one, for underneath Janine, but I'd really like you to take that into consideration, too, so we can save at least one more secretary, and we're already losing three, and then three retiring, which wasn't really their choice to retire now, but had no choice.

2577
04:19:57,623 --> 04:20:01,204
I'm Mary Jo Petroni, I'm the President of the Administrative Assistance Union.

2578
04:20:01,804 --> 04:20:06,686
And as Michelle stated, we're very concerned, again, on the safety.

2579
04:20:07,346 --> 04:20:18,810
And I'm even more concerned about the safety at Bedford High School, eliminating an assistant principal administrative assistant, because I'm very fortunate, I have a radio in my office, and on a daily basis,

2580
04:20:19,470 --> 04:20:26,319
They're calling the assistant principals are calling their assistants and saying, I'm sending students to you they need a break.

2581
04:20:26,639 --> 04:20:31,926
We're having an issue we had a fight at the high school on Friday, we had to separate some students.

2582
04:20:32,346 --> 04:20:37,092
We need to make sure that the students know they have a safe place to go.

2583
04:20:37,673 --> 04:20:53,722
If you have nobody on the second floor as an administrative assistant, only the third and the first, one person is out, now you have one administrative assistant covering the entire high school, that's a scary thing to me.

2584
04:20:53,862 --> 04:20:55,903
And students are very smart.

2585
04:20:56,384 --> 04:20:58,585
They recognize when there are people missing.

2586
04:20:58,745 --> 04:21:06,570
If there's an assistant principal out, if there's a teacher out, we have a lot of roamers and they're gonna be much more roaming at that point.

2587
04:21:07,597 --> 04:21:17,465
The McGlynn School is the big concern, because that's younger students, much younger students, lot of parent concerns, and that's a big issue.

2588
04:21:17,866 --> 04:21:29,536
With regards to the payroll, I have to say this, because I did work in payroll, I was deployed to another department because they needed help in another department, when we had the 2009, 10, 11 changes, re-organization.

2589
04:21:33,699 --> 04:21:44,228
I did the MTRS report, and it was perfection until a person who we don't speak about anymore decided it shouldn't be done by me but he couldn't figure out who should do it.

2590
04:21:44,648 --> 04:21:45,709
So he dropped the ball.

2591
04:21:46,289 --> 04:21:49,192
I was fine doing the report until he said that.

2592
04:21:50,270 --> 04:21:56,158
I also feel like there's been a huge amount of changes in the way the finances are done.

2593
04:21:56,198 --> 04:22:06,771
We've had numerous finance directors, so I'm hoping, and I think Mr. Rousseau does, that we finally get one way to do finances because it's been done.

2594
04:22:07,492 --> 04:22:08,773
multiple different ways.

2595
04:22:09,013 --> 04:22:21,278
And it seems like Jerry has a much better handle on finding the hidden monies and helping on buildings and grounds is a perfect example of a department that has to buy, it has to fix things no matter what.

2596
04:22:21,919 --> 04:22:27,781
So we just, he is able to approve our over budget POs with our request.

2597
04:22:29,282 --> 04:22:34,966
and allow us to keep the students in the safe positions that they are, or repair the problems that we have.

2598
04:22:35,426 --> 04:22:45,873
So I do appreciate Jerry's, but I mean, I think a lot of our problem is the number of finance operators we've had in this district over the last 24 years that I've been here.

2599
04:22:46,773 --> 04:22:54,476
And the last thing is, I did make a decision to retire, they changed my job, and for my own family, it makes more sense for me to leave.

2600
04:22:54,996 --> 04:23:03,200
But I'm walking out the door with knowledge in my head, as are the other two people, and also the administrators that are gonna be walking out the door.

2601
04:23:03,780 --> 04:23:16,005
I hope you understand what you're losing with knowledge that these people are given, and a bad taste in their mouth, because it was not a very nice way that any of it was done.

2602
04:23:16,605 --> 04:23:20,226
So that being said, I'm just sharing that information on my end.

2603
04:23:20,887 --> 04:23:21,927
And with regards to Ms.

2604
04:23:21,947 --> 04:23:28,929
Rallo, today I was counting $12,000 she raised on the Mama Mia play, because I also do student activities.

2605
04:23:29,470 --> 04:23:29,690
Ms.

2606
04:23:29,730 --> 04:23:33,411
Rallo has done an incredible job in the time that I've worked with her.

2607
04:23:33,811 --> 04:23:34,391
But Ms.

2608
04:23:34,471 --> 04:23:36,892
Fee is bringing in grant money like you wouldn't believe.

2609
04:23:36,952 --> 04:23:39,153
And if she's going to have a lot more work to do,

2610
04:23:39,733 --> 04:23:45,074
running a whole department, you're going to lose the ability to write those grants, to run those programs that she's running.

2611
04:23:45,114 --> 04:23:52,576
So please remember, when you combine a job, you lose the ability to do extra things that they are both doing right now.

2612
04:23:53,056 --> 04:23:53,937
So I do thank you.

2613
04:23:54,017 --> 04:23:55,677
I appreciate what you're going through.

2614
04:23:55,717 --> 04:23:59,958
But honestly, I think you're losing a lot more than staff.

2615
04:24:00,598 --> 04:24:01,899
And that's a big problem.

2616
04:24:02,339 --> 04:24:02,899
Thank you.

2617
04:24:09,135 --> 04:24:10,555
You name and address for the record.

2618
04:24:11,976 --> 04:24:14,296
My name is Enoch Liao, I live at 9 Earl Avenue.

2619
04:24:15,197 --> 04:24:17,998
Madam Mayor, Madam Superintendent, and the committee.

2620
04:24:18,418 --> 04:24:19,218
Thank you for being here.

2621
04:24:19,258 --> 04:24:21,419
Also, thanks for listening to us.

2622
04:24:21,619 --> 04:24:22,339
It's not easy.

2623
04:24:22,639 --> 04:24:25,060
These are not glamorous positions you plug your way into.

2624
04:24:25,080 --> 04:24:33,122
Medford is a wonderful city to live in, but it's a challenging district to attract and retain great talent, and I think no one knows that better than you, Superintendent.

2625
04:24:33,822 --> 04:24:36,724
My wife and I moved from Los Angeles to come to serve.

2626
04:24:36,805 --> 04:24:40,728
I'm a pastor in this church, of a church in Boston, in the city of Newton.

2627
04:24:41,148 --> 04:24:46,132
So I'm familiar with the Boston Public Schools and the Newton Public Schools, but all my three boys have grown up in Medford.

2628
04:24:46,873 --> 04:24:52,057
Three in the Roberts, two in McGlynn, one in Andrews, and two have gone through the high school.

2629
04:24:52,097 --> 04:24:53,498
One just graduated yesterday from Tufts.

2630
04:24:53,618 --> 04:24:54,739
The other one is also in Tufts.

2631
04:24:55,099 --> 04:24:59,102
And my other son is the one that's one of the two drum majors who's hoping for a season next year.

2632
04:25:00,203 --> 04:25:03,526
In terms of what we can say I know you're making a lot of hard decisions.

2633
04:25:03,946 --> 04:25:05,507
So as I understand the situation.

2634
04:25:06,428 --> 04:25:08,269
You've got lots of other folks that can tell you.

2635
04:25:09,419 --> 04:25:12,880
in greater detail, the emotions and the impact.

2636
04:25:13,020 --> 04:25:15,181
And I know you weigh up each one, each person's story.

2637
04:25:15,661 --> 04:25:25,604
So what I can share a little differently would be to just, I can't advocate for the other groups either, because I don't have the privilege of being a parent of every, I feel like my kid in all those sports and teams and clubs and nurses.

2638
04:25:25,624 --> 04:25:26,965
So I know you're making hard decisions.

2639
04:25:27,025 --> 04:25:33,087
And I do believe this committee and all the administration has poured over the budget to really try to figure out how we can make it work.

2640
04:25:34,067 --> 04:25:34,768
just a few angles.

2641
04:25:35,508 --> 04:25:41,191
Superintendent, I think respectfully, some folks may have a different perspective of the impact of losing Ms.

2642
04:25:41,251 --> 04:25:41,411
Raul.

2643
04:25:41,911 --> 04:25:44,973
So I understand you're doing your best, and so I appreciate that.

2644
04:25:45,333 --> 04:25:49,676
But I think if there's time to dialogue, if it's appropriate, I'd be happy to connect with that about those things.

2645
04:25:49,696 --> 04:25:51,957
But I do think there's a pretty big disconnect.

2646
04:25:52,417 --> 04:25:57,660
I know at the last committee meeting, like, you know, superintendent and committee members showing up, I understand there's laws about that.

2647
04:25:57,900 --> 04:26:02,783
There's a lot of good reasons why superintendent and committee members can't just walk all over the buildings they want, so I appreciate that.

2648
04:26:03,543 --> 04:26:04,743
Oh, actually she can, that's good.

2649
04:26:04,824 --> 04:26:05,164
She can.

2650
04:26:05,264 --> 04:26:06,724
She can, that's awesome, that's good.

2651
04:26:06,764 --> 04:26:12,366
But all that's to say that I recognize it's a lot of people have a lot of issues to try to understand, so I appreciate that.

2652
04:26:12,386 --> 04:26:20,710
But that being said, what I do know in my work as a pastor and in different agencies and cities is you try to keep essential personnel.

2653
04:26:21,110 --> 04:26:22,450
And there's two kinds of essential personnel.

2654
04:26:22,690 --> 04:26:28,893
There's the high performers, and that stays in your room as you discuss the realities of performance.

2655
04:26:29,773 --> 04:26:35,538
and what they can bring to the city, making the best use of every city dollar to the best education of our city and our kids.

2656
04:26:35,558 --> 04:26:36,218
I understand that.

2657
04:26:36,558 --> 04:26:48,148
But then there's also an essential personnel that without that person, it really is a critical linchpin to the functioning of that program at the quality and level that we really want to see.

2658
04:26:48,828 --> 04:27:05,389
So that's the thing I would say appealing for really the creativity appreciate that to make it work I guess I'm just another voice to say, I actually think it'd be incredibly hard to hire someone to do the kind of commitment and work them Israel has I know school districts right now, that would salivate at the thought that she would be on the market.

2659
04:27:06,330 --> 04:27:13,432
So I know you know that but I guess, as you go back to make the hard decisions I am pleading with you to consider that to make those hard decisions with creativity.

2660
04:27:13,832 --> 04:27:23,695
Secondly, and just trying to add two things that haven't been said tonight, not because I need to be original but, and I didn't want it to get spicy but um, when I first came to the city hall for as a parent.

2661
04:27:24,295 --> 04:27:26,737
it was probably in the middle school, my oldest was orchestra.

2662
04:27:27,177 --> 04:27:36,823
And the funny thing was the wonderful committee members of which at that point were all white, had a hard time pronouncing all the names of the vastly diverse orchestra at that point.

2663
04:27:37,143 --> 04:27:41,706
And I realized, oh, all the kids that are not white kind of coalesce into some of these programs.

2664
04:27:42,907 --> 04:27:53,654
I haven't gone to every football game, every basketball game, every cheerleader competition, I haven't gone to all those things, but it seems to me that there is a potentially high concentration of people of color

2665
04:27:54,698 --> 04:27:59,079
And I don't know for a fact, but LGBTQIA plus are in some of these programs.

2666
04:27:59,659 --> 04:28:10,161
And I, you know, we could do a study, you guys could commission it, but you might be inadvertently disproportionately impacting some of the few programs that actually, that's what I think they mean by the safe spaces.

2667
04:28:10,561 --> 04:28:19,403
So I guess whether that's a study you conduct or whether that's just another assessment, as you're making those hard choices to reprioritize that, I think these are one of the places where

2668
04:28:20,424 --> 04:28:26,348
My wife and I were the only, our son was one of the only East Asians in the member schools when he was a kid.

2669
04:28:26,808 --> 04:28:28,929
They said, look at all his friends, they're all diverse.

2670
04:28:29,009 --> 04:28:32,131
I said, it's like a WB TV show sitcom cast.

2671
04:28:32,671 --> 04:28:33,912
But I said, they're not diverse.

2672
04:28:34,032 --> 04:28:37,474
And actually some of the parents of the class of 20, they disagree with me.

2673
04:28:37,514 --> 04:28:38,275
They look so diverse.

2674
04:28:38,295 --> 04:28:40,916
No, these are the non-white kids in their class.

2675
04:28:41,196 --> 04:28:43,678
They all hang out together, because at the time, there are so few.

2676
04:28:44,618 --> 04:28:48,441
So I think whether there's so many great programs, so many great things, but in terms of the,

2677
04:28:49,472 --> 04:28:53,315
really trying to make Medford a welcoming city for all, that's something to consider.

2678
04:28:53,675 --> 04:29:04,682
The third and final thing is I want you to know that we do pray for you regularly, and pray for you and your decisions, so thank you for all that you're doing, and just appreciate the work, and we've only lived in Medford our entire time at St.

2679
04:29:04,702 --> 04:29:06,684
Jude's, and we're really grateful the Lord brought us here.

2680
04:29:07,024 --> 04:29:07,564
Thank you for your time.

2681
04:29:07,804 --> 04:29:08,285
Thank you.

2682
04:29:08,305 --> 04:29:13,988
Can you name and address for the record?

2683
04:29:16,017 --> 04:29:20,580
I'm Maggie Fowler, 28 Wedgmere Road, and I am a junior at Medford High School.

2684
04:29:21,020 --> 04:29:33,427
So I know that so many points have been brought up tonight, and I don't want to run over anything that's already been said, but I feel like there is an aspect of this whole entire situation that we've been sort of missing.

2685
04:29:34,632 --> 04:29:55,968
And as a member of eight years of the Medford Performing Arts Department, I've been part of the marching band, I've been part of the Medford High School Orchestra, as well as the middle school orchestra, string ensemble, and elementary school orchestras, and I've also been part of the drama club for every year that I've been in high school.

2686
04:29:56,949 --> 04:29:57,109
And

2687
04:29:57,914 --> 04:30:11,542
I would like to vouch for the fact that the removal of this performing arts coordinator position would trickle down into every single organization that falls under the performing arts umbrella.

2688
04:30:11,622 --> 04:30:27,271
And this includes the marching band, but as well as the drama club and the orchestra and the percussion groups that are a part of these and the winter guard and every single elementary and middle school group that reflects these organizations from the high school.

2689
04:30:27,811 --> 04:30:31,613
every single one of these organizations would be impacted by this removal.

2690
04:30:32,213 --> 04:30:48,702
And I've seen a lot of mention of the band, and I've seen a lot of mention of the drama club, but all of our organizations rely on Miss Rello's transportation management, her organization, and her communication between just the people of these organizations.

2691
04:30:49,482 --> 04:30:53,765
And these activities without her would be nearly impossible to run.

2692
04:30:55,050 --> 04:31:01,176
Because of this, I strongly advise a consideration of these position cuts.

2693
04:31:01,516 --> 04:31:02,757
Thank you.

2694
04:31:11,372 --> 04:31:16,753
So me personally, I started out as a kid who went to another school in another city.

2695
04:31:16,913 --> 04:31:22,494
I had no idea what band was until I got a little older and then realized my sisters are in this.

2696
04:31:23,095 --> 04:31:25,875
My sisters are creating a legacy and they left behind for me.

2697
04:31:26,655 --> 04:31:29,416
And when I came into band, I've been here for years.

2698
04:31:30,156 --> 04:31:35,277
And then I was like, I don't want to be known as my sister's brother.

2699
04:31:35,557 --> 04:31:37,298
I want to make my own legacy.

2700
04:31:38,118 --> 04:31:39,198
I want to leave a mark here.

2701
04:31:41,557 --> 04:31:45,506
Like, I want to be here for everyone.

2702
04:31:46,168 --> 04:31:47,891
I want to help, like.

2703
04:31:49,303 --> 04:31:58,385
Division is like when you take away the arts, when you break it up, or like when you give it to one person.

2704
04:31:58,825 --> 04:32:02,046
Think of Miss V. Miss V is like, think of her.

2705
04:32:02,206 --> 04:32:06,287
She has to do so much more if you're giving all that to her or that whoever's next.

2706
04:32:06,827 --> 04:32:09,487
It's not gonna be one person with all that stress.

2707
04:32:10,048 --> 04:32:11,588
And then you have like,

2708
04:32:12,418 --> 04:32:15,880
Think of it like a train, Miss Rella couplers that hold the train carts together.

2709
04:32:16,320 --> 04:32:25,225
If you take the couplers out, you take Miss Rella out, the train, which is the band or the entire department, it falls apart and then it could crash.

2710
04:32:26,025 --> 04:32:30,307
Crash and like break, like everything burns.

2711
04:32:32,208 --> 04:32:39,672
Like if you take the most important component, like nothing will work properly.

2712
04:32:41,575 --> 04:32:41,915
Thank you.

2713
04:32:42,295 --> 04:32:42,795
Thank you.

2714
04:32:49,618 --> 04:32:50,678
Your name and address for the record?

2715
04:32:51,219 --> 04:32:54,980
My name is Gavin Gagne, often mispronounced as Gagne.

2716
04:32:55,000 --> 04:32:59,522
I know it is.

2717
04:33:00,502 --> 04:33:03,823
Unfortunately, I really don't have much to say.

2718
04:33:03,843 --> 04:33:09,365
I kind of only joined two friends here for the ride, as I usually do, really.

2719
04:33:11,917 --> 04:33:14,399
But since I'm up here, I might as well have something to say.

2720
04:33:15,480 --> 04:33:22,906
So I have this quote from a guitarist that I look up to, which is ironic since I myself am a drummer.

2721
04:33:24,067 --> 04:33:25,087
I'm a bit more than that.

2722
04:33:25,107 --> 04:33:30,332
The quote is, music is our friend.

2723
04:33:32,640 --> 04:33:40,603
And that was said by Robert Fripp, who's a member of a band that I really admire called King Crimson.

2724
04:33:41,403 --> 04:33:46,584
Not like that information is relevant or anything, but I particularly like that quote.

2725
04:33:50,043 --> 04:33:57,273
Because I feel like we all can agree in the band on the fact that music is our friend.

2726
04:33:58,334 --> 04:34:02,560
And for most of us, it's all that we have, really.

2727
04:34:02,881 --> 04:34:04,643
And if you

2728
04:34:07,087 --> 04:34:12,589
If you take that, if you take away that position, what was it again?

2729
04:34:12,870 --> 04:34:16,551
The director of, coordinator of performing arts.

2730
04:34:16,591 --> 04:34:25,855
If you take that away, you're probably going to be taking away what is pretty much all we have.

2731
04:34:26,035 --> 04:34:35,920
I mean, sure, we can connect with music some other way, but it won't be the same as with a group of people, which is,

2732
04:34:37,465 --> 04:34:39,706
what I personally am grateful for.

2733
04:34:39,726 --> 04:34:45,729
I do not know where else to go with this, so I'm just gonna leave it here.

2734
04:34:45,929 --> 04:34:46,490
Thank you.

2735
04:34:55,083 --> 04:34:56,324
My name and address for the record.

2736
04:34:56,644 --> 04:34:58,545
Colby Robbins, 37 Hicks Ave.

2737
04:34:58,885 --> 04:35:01,467
I'm the librarian at the Missituck.

2738
04:35:02,267 --> 04:35:06,010
I just want to quickly echo what my colleagues have said about cutting the Missituck positions.

2739
04:35:06,190 --> 04:35:07,931
I do think it would be a great disservice.

2740
04:35:09,032 --> 04:35:16,977
But I would also remiss if I didn't talk about another position that is being cut, and that is the director of technology and libraries.

2741
04:35:17,897 --> 04:35:21,300
Molly does an incredible job at what she does.

2742
04:35:21,860 --> 04:35:25,903
She has cultivated devotion within her staff.

2743
04:35:26,904 --> 04:35:29,246
I can speak of nothing but good things about Molly.

2744
04:35:31,188 --> 04:35:39,054
She has advocated for the library in a way that I have not seen anyone else do in this administration.

2745
04:35:41,432 --> 04:35:52,865
The library provides such an amazing resource and safe space for our kids that to get rid of that position and just lump it somewhere else takes away all of that.

2746
04:35:54,123 --> 04:36:00,770
So I really hope that you take that into consideration when you look at these cuts.

2747
04:36:00,870 --> 04:36:02,992
It's not just a position.

2748
04:36:03,953 --> 04:36:11,361
She's an advocator for not just her staff, but all of these students from kindergarten all the way up to 12th grade.

2749
04:36:13,363 --> 04:36:25,710
And we also mentioned on the technology side, all of our Chromebooks that were bought in COVID are getting to the end of their life cycle, which means somebody needs to focus on repurchasing, replacing.

2750
04:36:26,863 --> 04:36:34,489
all of that, and heading up tech support, which provides vital, vital support to our students.

2751
04:36:34,709 --> 04:36:41,454
I can't count how many times a day I have students coming into the library going, Mr. Robbins, my Chromebook's broken, can you fix it?

2752
04:36:41,474 --> 04:36:43,156
And I go, I am teaching a class.

2753
04:36:43,876 --> 04:36:46,899
I will try to get to it when I can, but I don't have the time right now.

2754
04:36:48,280 --> 04:36:52,643
So we really need somebody in that position to guide that.

2755
04:36:53,524 --> 04:36:55,305
That's really all I had to say, but thank you.

2756
04:37:01,599 --> 04:37:04,411
Good evening, Jessica Bruno, Saunders Street.

2757
04:37:05,691 --> 04:37:10,573
I'm here tonight to advocate for the performing arts and specifically for Mrs. Wallow.

2758
04:37:10,693 --> 04:37:15,795
I emailed several of you and did not receive responses from most of you.

2759
04:37:16,235 --> 04:37:27,279
So I'm going to not bore you with my long, lengthy address, but I'm gonna just read one excerpt because I only heard one other parent mention this group, but just please bear with me.

2760
04:37:27,299 --> 04:37:30,021
Another point that I wanna bring to your attention is,

2761
04:37:31,321 --> 04:37:36,425
Two is the educational exclusion this cut will have on a subset of the student body.

2762
04:37:36,885 --> 04:37:39,647
Let's be honest, not all students are athletes.

2763
04:37:40,288 --> 04:37:49,294
Some students can't participate in sports due to disabilities and have physical limitations, and others who may be neurodivergent can't do to do.

2764
04:37:50,595 --> 04:37:53,059
to cognitive and developmental limitations.

2765
04:37:53,319 --> 04:37:57,985
So eliminating a program accessible to all abilities is discriminatory.

2766
04:37:58,306 --> 04:38:07,819
Research shows that neurodivergent people excel creatively and inclusive programs such as those overseen by Mrs. Rallo positively affect peer relationships

2767
04:38:08,219 --> 04:38:11,542
social, emotional health and incentivize good behavior.

2768
04:38:12,042 --> 04:38:25,433
In addition to the disabled and neurodivergent populations, research also shows more LGBTQ students participate in sports at a much lower rate than their non-LGBTQ peers.

2769
04:38:25,933 --> 04:38:27,695
And of those LGBTQ students,

2770
04:38:28,015 --> 04:38:32,518
students, performing arts have proven to be a safe haven for those youth.

2771
04:38:33,018 --> 04:38:45,305
Robust performing arts programs, like the current MPS Performing Arts Program, led by Mrs. Rallo, have been shown to empower youth, improve mental health and well-being, and create a sense of belonging and inclusiveness.

2772
04:38:45,626 --> 04:38:50,288
So I please urge you to find the funding, reallocate fundings.

2773
04:38:50,969 --> 04:38:55,832
Mayor Rhianna Lungo-Kern, please look into the override,

2774
04:38:56,772 --> 04:39:02,897
and just support the Medford youth and continue on with this program because these stipends are not gonna cut it.

2775
04:39:03,537 --> 04:39:23,633
Let's be real, we saw how many hours go into a program like this, how many elementary and middle school students are rising up and have taken on orchestra band and are promoting into the high school without these programs in place, it's not gonna empower our youth for the next generation.

2776
04:39:24,073 --> 04:39:24,393
Thank you.

2777
04:39:29,751 --> 04:39:33,213
We do have a couple of folks who have been waiting very patiently on Zoom.

2778
04:39:33,294 --> 04:39:35,315
So is it Chris Bennett?

2779
04:39:39,557 --> 04:39:39,818
Yes.

2780
04:39:41,500 --> 04:39:43,563
Good evening and thank you for being patient.

2781
04:39:44,584 --> 04:39:46,486
I have a couple of concerns.

2782
04:39:46,767 --> 04:39:59,762
One of my, the biggest issue that I'm finding is that we're defining cuts from the number of students rather than the raw data from DOE, which breaks down diversity, special needs in an identified therapeutic school.

2783
04:40:00,830 --> 04:40:05,733
So by eliminating that type of information, it's just blowing my mind.

2784
04:40:06,234 --> 04:40:13,678
I'm looking at the data from DOE, and I'm looking at the McGlynn specifically right now, which is the most diverse.

2785
04:40:14,759 --> 04:40:25,946
It's got the most high needs, 71.34%, most ELL, you have 64 incoming kindergarten students, and you have students with disabilities that are 15%.

2786
04:40:27,187 --> 04:40:29,569
Now, although the MSITUC is considered

2787
04:40:31,185 --> 04:40:48,370
less amount of students, we have, we're at 33.24% of non-English or English not as their first language, 22% of students with disabilities and 57% with high needs.

2788
04:40:49,310 --> 04:40:53,411
They have the lowest MCAS scores in our city.

2789
04:40:55,012 --> 04:40:59,373
Now the Brooks, although they have a high percentage of students,

2790
04:41:00,538 --> 04:41:02,701
They have the highest MCAS scores.

2791
04:41:03,261 --> 04:41:06,405
They are the least diverse of all of the schools.

2792
04:41:07,106 --> 04:41:09,669
We came from 11 elementary schools.

2793
04:41:09,910 --> 04:41:10,390
I'm old.

2794
04:41:11,632 --> 04:41:14,675
I have four children who went through Medford Public Schools.

2795
04:41:15,496 --> 04:41:17,179
I have four grandchildren.

2796
04:41:18,395 --> 04:41:29,149
I'm seeing that Medford that had 11 elementary schools, we watched maintenance get cut, cut, cut, so the schools weren't even able to be replenished.

2797
04:41:29,589 --> 04:41:32,653
We've gone down to a total of four.

2798
04:41:32,673 --> 04:41:35,537
We have two middle schools and one high school.

2799
04:41:38,078 --> 04:41:47,642
Okay, so now we're looking at cuts on specifics on how many students per school, which is what's giving them the ability to break down.

2800
04:41:48,062 --> 04:41:50,823
I'm also an advocate for children with special needs.

2801
04:41:51,543 --> 04:41:53,484
I've placed a lot of children

2802
04:41:54,750 --> 04:42:03,672
with the school system to the Missittuck School because they were the most able to handle the therapeutic needs of a lot of these kids.

2803
04:42:03,732 --> 04:42:13,675
Some of them had autism, some of them had other areas that had concerns, and all of the school worked together, which is why it's a therapeutic school.

2804
04:42:14,135 --> 04:42:16,835
Everybody worked together to work with all of these children.

2805
04:42:17,936 --> 04:42:23,197
Now, if we have to think out of the box, maybe we need to make it that all schools

2806
04:42:24,417 --> 04:42:32,939
are thrown together and the kids get to go whatever school that they were assigned instead of everybody going to one particular school.

2807
04:42:33,999 --> 04:42:37,420
So everybody wants to get into the Brooks because they have great MCAS scores.

2808
04:42:38,141 --> 04:42:39,901
What about all the kids that have special needs?

2809
04:42:39,941 --> 04:42:40,801
They don't make it there.

2810
04:42:41,441 --> 04:42:42,042
You know why?

2811
04:42:42,182 --> 04:42:44,722
Because the class sizes are kind of big.

2812
04:42:45,222 --> 04:42:47,183
It's not really tolerated as easily over there.

2813
04:42:48,298 --> 04:42:50,298
All of the kids are tolerated at the MISATEC.

2814
04:42:50,559 --> 04:42:54,359
We have a lot of kids that don't speak English or they're English language learners.

2815
04:42:55,300 --> 04:42:57,620
And all of a sudden, we're gonna start cutting.

2816
04:42:58,360 --> 04:43:03,762
So how are we gonna implement those students going into the regular education classes?

2817
04:43:04,262 --> 04:43:06,602
They're supposed to be in the least restrictive environment.

2818
04:43:07,162 --> 04:43:15,164
If a child shows the ability to be able to access the standard curriculum with support, they should be allowed to be doing that.

2819
04:43:15,644 --> 04:43:16,765
If you have 22 kids in there,

2820
04:43:18,345 --> 04:43:19,809
are 23 or 24.

2821
04:43:19,889 --> 04:43:20,852
We're going backwards.

2822
04:43:21,353 --> 04:43:23,860
That's the kind of stuff that went on in the 80s and 90s.

2823
04:43:25,952 --> 04:43:28,554
If we are talking about doing fair.

2824
04:43:28,954 --> 04:43:32,297
Watch, but I just wanted to remind you that you have three minutes.

2825
04:43:32,517 --> 04:43:36,781
Okay, if we're gonna be fair, then we need to make sure that we are equitable.

2826
04:43:37,321 --> 04:43:40,103
Right now, we are not.

2827
04:43:40,884 --> 04:43:42,465
We're not equitable at all.

2828
04:43:43,146 --> 04:43:46,308
I'm looking at the numbers that are from the Department of Education.

2829
04:43:46,468 --> 04:43:51,412
I encourage all of the school committee members to really, really pull that apart to see that.

2830
04:43:52,673 --> 04:43:53,674
We're in trouble.

2831
04:43:54,877 --> 04:43:58,160
We need to make sure legally they're in the least restrictive environment.

2832
04:43:58,760 --> 04:44:01,703
We need to legally make sure that they have an appropriate supports.

2833
04:44:02,303 --> 04:44:11,391
We legally have to make sure that those students who were supposed to be receiving services are getting the services and those service providers are not taking care of another class.

2834
04:44:12,172 --> 04:44:18,957
So I'm looking at the legal issues of this and how difficult this is going to be if we don't resolve this.

2835
04:44:19,938 --> 04:44:29,403
Maybe we need to start from scratch and put all of the schools together in a big jumping pot, because a lot of people that are in walking distance to the Brooks School have to go to the Missittuck.

2836
04:44:30,423 --> 04:44:32,064
So we got to figure that out.

2837
04:44:32,324 --> 04:44:34,125
It's just wrong what's happening right now.

2838
04:44:34,445 --> 04:44:37,887
We are not diverse in our schools at all.

2839
04:44:37,907 --> 04:44:43,209
Jessica Hill.

2840
04:44:47,207 --> 04:44:49,327
Hi, Jessica Haley full off road method.

2841
04:44:50,368 --> 04:44:53,868
Um, so I just have a few things, few questions, few statements.

2842
04:44:54,969 --> 04:45:01,270
Um, when we're talking about the budget, two things come to mind.

2843
04:45:02,150 --> 04:45:09,592
Um, I know the school committee got their raise, not sure how much is being taken out of the budget for that.

2844
04:45:10,602 --> 04:45:14,524
And also we are now paying three doctorate salaries.

2845
04:45:15,124 --> 04:45:20,046
Our superintendent and two superintendents are now both doctorate salaries.

2846
04:45:20,487 --> 04:45:30,331
So I'm wondering how much with the school committee raise and now three doctorates in the administration, how much is coming out of just those salaries?

2847
04:45:32,032 --> 04:45:38,135
Also cutting nurses, cutting secretaries, adjustment counselors,

2848
04:45:39,165 --> 04:45:41,787
Those are the three people that my son goes to.

2849
04:45:43,168 --> 04:45:46,251
He's on an IEP, suffers from anxiety.

2850
04:45:47,452 --> 04:45:55,459
And when he's having an issue, which happens not too often, but he definitely needs it sometimes, they send him to the nurse.

2851
04:45:56,500 --> 04:45:58,221
They send him to the adjustment counselor.

2852
04:45:58,581 --> 04:46:01,424
So they'll send him to the office to sit with the secretary.

2853
04:46:02,685 --> 04:46:05,087
And those are the people that we think we can get rid of.

2854
04:46:06,401 --> 04:46:13,725
My son's going to the middle school, the McLean, and you're telling me that we're gonna have one adjustment counselor for all those kids?

2855
04:46:16,166 --> 04:46:18,487
Hardly any secretaries, nurses.

2856
04:46:19,187 --> 04:46:21,108
So where's my son gonna go when he needs the help?

2857
04:46:22,109 --> 04:46:22,849
Because he'll need it.

2858
04:46:22,869 --> 04:46:24,950
It's not middle school.

2859
04:46:29,052 --> 04:46:32,994
Also, we're using Nexus as a form of mental health.

2860
04:46:33,958 --> 04:46:38,821
I want to know, does any of these Nexus teachers have mental health credentials?

2861
04:46:40,783 --> 04:46:51,910
Or are we just saying that Nexus is helping kids with mental health, but are these adjustment counselors are, what kind of degrees do they have in mental health?

2862
04:46:56,914 --> 04:47:01,217
Also with the arts, I think my son will kind of thrive in the arts as he gets older.

2863
04:47:04,215 --> 04:47:08,956
with him having different disabilities, I think that would be a good place for him to go.

2864
04:47:10,116 --> 04:47:26,660
Granted, I don't know much about it yet, as he's only hitting sixth grade, he hasn't been really into it yet, but I think that getting rid of the arts directors, obviously you're hearing all the children, they need that lady and they rely on her.

2865
04:47:28,801 --> 04:47:32,302
So I would like to say to the mayor,

2866
04:47:34,458 --> 04:47:37,720
the money and the extra cash, which is technically our money.

2867
04:47:39,040 --> 04:47:41,221
And I think we should have a say of where it goes.

2868
04:47:42,942 --> 04:47:45,483
I know everyone's talking about the 2.5 override.

2869
04:47:45,803 --> 04:47:47,264
Well, right now we don't have that.

2870
04:47:48,184 --> 04:47:50,025
But what we do have is the extra cash.

2871
04:47:51,046 --> 04:47:59,990
And what we need to do is keep our secretaries, keep our nurses, keep our guidance counselors, keep the arts program.

2872
04:48:01,330 --> 04:48:02,651
We need this for our children.

2873
04:48:04,368 --> 04:48:10,869
They are not someone that can come in, you know, second and let's just figure out the money because you know what?

2874
04:48:11,470 --> 04:48:15,050
All the administrators, the school committee, everyone's getting their money.

2875
04:48:16,351 --> 04:48:22,572
But the people who are really working with these kids day in and day out, those are the people you want to help.

2876
04:48:23,312 --> 04:48:25,572
I've finished my time.

2877
04:48:28,877 --> 04:48:35,125
Okay, so I'll email to get some of these responses, because I know I said a lot, you're not going to remember it all.

2878
04:48:36,186 --> 04:48:37,007
Thank you, Jessica.

2879
04:48:37,107 --> 04:48:38,729
Thank you for taking it into consideration.

2880
04:48:38,969 --> 04:48:39,410
Thank you.

2881
04:48:39,430 --> 04:48:42,093
Amanda Gass.

2882
04:48:46,265 --> 04:48:49,546
Hi, I know you guys are all very tired and probably want to go home.

2883
04:48:50,786 --> 04:48:51,846
I'm Amanda gas.

2884
04:48:51,926 --> 04:48:54,327
I teach at the Roberts elementary school.

2885
04:48:54,787 --> 04:49:01,088
This is my 14th year teaching and I wanted to commend everyone who's spoken tonight because.

2886
04:49:03,089 --> 04:49:07,850
It's I feel like people have been very eloquent and really stood up for.

2887
04:49:09,731 --> 04:49:23,150
I am a kindergarten teacher, so I wanted to call attention to the additional kindergarten classrooms that are not.

2888
04:49:23,351 --> 04:49:23,971
I'm not.

2889
04:49:28,356 --> 04:49:37,283
And I know that that's based on enrollment, but I wanted to call your attention to it so that you can keep an eye on it.

2890
04:49:37,343 --> 04:49:39,645
Because what happened last year was that we.

2891
04:49:39,665 --> 04:49:41,467
We had a very, very large number of teachers.

2892
04:49:41,747 --> 04:49:56,178
Um, lost a good teacher and ended up having to scramble to hire new teachers at all the elementary schools for additional kindergarten classrooms because of enrollment and especially at the Roberts.

2893
04:49:56,358 --> 04:49:57,719
I know it's true at other schools.

2894
04:49:59,000 --> 04:50:06,904
Well, but we have students who enroll, you know, way past now, right?

2895
04:50:06,964 --> 04:50:11,607
They're enrolling in August, even in September, but definitely throughout the summer.

2896
04:50:12,847 --> 04:50:24,614
And I just think that we should look at the trends in enrollment in the different schools and make sure that we're prepared because we have an excellent new teacher.

2897
04:50:26,054 --> 04:50:35,279
teaching at the Robertson Kindergarten, and I would hate to lose her and be scrambling to hire someone again in the fall.

2898
04:50:35,759 --> 04:50:52,628
Kindergarten is, anyone who has stepped foot in a kindergarten classroom knows that we really need good teachers, that these kids need the support, and that if you are talking about having four classrooms, if you're talking about having

2899
04:50:53,664 --> 04:50:54,885
Thank you, Ms.

2900
04:50:55,105 --> 04:50:55,486
Gass.

2901
04:51:20,115 --> 04:51:22,317
I see one more hand.

2902
04:51:24,398 --> 04:51:25,299
Hello.

2903
04:51:27,220 --> 04:51:27,861
Can you hear me?

2904
04:51:29,081 --> 04:51:29,502
Yes, we can.

2905
04:51:29,522 --> 04:51:31,523
Can you name and address for the record, please?

2906
04:51:31,863 --> 04:51:34,445
Lucille Mello, East Border Circle in Medford.

2907
04:51:35,045 --> 04:51:38,988
I've just been watching this all night, and I normally don't say too much.

2908
04:51:39,108 --> 04:51:46,353
But as a former educator in Medford and whose child has gone to Medford, I'm a little disappointed.

2909
04:51:48,975 --> 04:51:50,857
about a lot of these cuts.

2910
04:51:50,917 --> 04:52:04,247
And I just think right now that we should keep these cuts, use that rainy day fund, then work on the prop two and a half, because the only people who are losing out are our schools and our students.

2911
04:52:04,847 --> 04:52:11,152
And just to add, my daughter did all her band and music in elementary school and in Medford High School.

2912
04:52:11,532 --> 04:52:15,938
And the band was good, but it's even been better now.

2913
04:52:16,318 --> 04:52:18,361
And she used that to get into college.

2914
04:52:19,041 --> 04:52:19,422
Okay.

2915
04:52:19,702 --> 04:52:24,949
And she was in one of the largest well-known marching bands in this country.

2916
04:52:25,349 --> 04:52:27,211
And it all started in Medford High School.

2917
04:52:27,612 --> 04:52:29,374
And some people as a prior

2918
04:52:30,054 --> 04:52:33,635
speaker said was some kids are not into sports and athletics.

2919
04:52:33,975 --> 04:52:36,756
My daughter did do sports, but she wasn't the best.

2920
04:52:37,176 --> 04:52:38,696
Music was where she thrived.

2921
04:52:39,016 --> 04:52:51,379
And I just think that so many kids, and as a former special ed teacher, I've had students who music was their thing, be it violin, be it flute, be it whatever, and they found their place in their home.

2922
04:52:51,759 --> 04:52:56,480
So I'm just giving my two cents that we just need to right now, that rainy day fund,

2923
04:52:57,140 --> 04:52:58,221
is there for a purpose.

2924
04:52:58,561 --> 04:53:15,168
Yes, we don't wanna use it all the time, but use it this year and then work on that two and a half thing, because there are also places in this city where money is also mismanaged and spent and not at the expense of our school and our students and our community.

2925
04:53:15,428 --> 04:53:16,688
And that's where it needs to go.

2926
04:53:17,069 --> 04:53:18,149
So thank you very much.

2927
04:53:18,229 --> 04:53:20,990
And I appreciate all your time and effort for everybody there.

2928
04:53:21,390 --> 04:53:21,751
Thank you.

2929
04:53:21,771 --> 04:53:24,472
Thank you, Lucille.

2930
04:53:28,838 --> 04:53:32,660
Could you please put the spreadsheet back up on the screen.

2931
04:53:33,260 --> 04:53:39,444
And so could you please remember it.

2932
04:53:44,186 --> 04:53:48,529
The motion was the member school committee budget request in the amount of $79,399,774 for the

2933
04:53:52,950 --> 04:54:03,814
responsible operations of the member public schools in 2024 2025 be submitted in writing to the Medford City Council and the mayor of Medford within 48 hours of this motion.

2934
04:54:04,034 --> 04:54:07,595
I made the motion, it was seconded by member Olopade.

2935
04:54:09,556 --> 04:54:10,296
Roll call.

2936
04:54:11,897 --> 04:54:17,358
Point of clarification, is this number with all the cuts or without the cuts?

2937
04:54:17,418 --> 04:54:19,619
There are no cuts in this number.

2938
04:54:19,639 --> 04:54:21,640
So this number that we're putting forward

2939
04:54:22,296 --> 04:54:25,980
is our request to the municipal government.

2940
04:54:26,140 --> 04:54:27,461
Yes, it's just a request.

2941
04:54:27,501 --> 04:54:28,823
That's all it is right now, guys.

2942
04:54:28,903 --> 04:54:30,885
It's a request, but it is the first step.

2943
04:54:31,025 --> 04:54:32,606
I understand.

2944
04:54:32,666 --> 04:54:43,857
What I should clarify in my clarification is, is this number, because I'm getting confused with the language again, a month from the job, is this number one that reflects

2945
04:54:44,638 --> 04:55:12,400
the cuts in our packet or is this one that is the level one that is if this is level service level service if we do not so this does not include the cutting of the director of performing arts correct okay that's that's all i will yes thank you very much okay roll call please it's very important to know what we vote on everyone else understands what we're voting yes i do not feel comfortable voting on a budget that has this many cuts but if this number that we are putting forward then

2946
04:55:12,860 --> 04:55:15,242
Yes, it's the bottom number, not the top number.

2947
04:55:15,282 --> 04:55:16,423
Yes, that we are voting on.

2948
04:55:16,483 --> 04:55:17,743
On the bottom and both, correct.

2949
04:55:18,584 --> 04:55:19,204
Member Branley?

2950
04:55:19,305 --> 04:55:19,525
Yes.

2951
04:55:22,927 --> 04:55:23,367
Member Graham?

2952
04:55:23,487 --> 04:55:23,768
Yes.

2953
04:55:24,508 --> 04:55:25,129
Member Ntapa?

2954
04:55:25,189 --> 04:55:25,489
Yes.

2955
04:55:26,109 --> 04:55:26,830
Member Olopade?

2956
04:55:26,870 --> 04:55:27,190
Yes.

2957
04:55:27,570 --> 04:55:28,291
Member Reinfeldt?

2958
04:55:28,411 --> 04:55:28,751
Yes.

2959
04:55:29,492 --> 04:55:30,172
Member Rossell?

2960
04:55:30,192 --> 04:55:31,933
Yes, and I believe the mayor must abstain.

2961
04:55:33,474 --> 04:55:33,775
Abstain.

2962
04:55:35,391 --> 04:55:37,992
So, five in the affirmative, one abstention.

2963
04:55:38,012 --> 04:55:40,453
Our request to the municipal budget is $79,399,774.

2964
04:55:41,173 --> 04:55:48,595
I'm sorry, six in the affirmative, one abstention.

2965
04:55:48,615 --> 04:55:59,778
Our request to the municipal government is a level of service budget, which also includes four literacy interventionists, four power behavior specialists, for a grand total of $79,399,774.

2966
04:56:05,922 --> 04:56:06,683
Motion passes.

2967
04:56:06,843 --> 04:56:18,400
We're going to move on here.

2968
04:56:20,572 --> 04:56:21,273
11 past 10.

2969
04:56:22,853 --> 04:56:25,075
We don't have any presentations of the public tonight.

2970
04:56:25,095 --> 04:56:32,078
Item number, I can't count the number of emails anymore, seven, thank you.

2971
04:56:32,158 --> 04:56:36,381
Continued businesses and MSBA update and is there a motion to table that?

2972
04:56:36,861 --> 04:56:37,921
Oh, motion to table.

2973

04:56:44,445 --> 04:56:44,585
Aye.

2976
04:56:44,885 --> 04:56:45,606
All those opposed?

2977
04:56:52,627 --> 04:56:53,688
can you turn on your mic?

2978
04:56:53,708 --> 04:56:54,789
Yes, thank you so much.

2979
04:56:55,670 --> 04:56:57,291
So clarification for the fifth time.

2980
04:56:57,392 --> 04:57:02,477
Recommendation on the consent agenda, we did not vote to recommend to approve the $3,000 grant.

2981
04:57:03,177 --> 04:57:04,519
It was in the consent agenda.

2982
04:57:04,579 --> 04:57:07,622
We motioned to approve that agenda and it was unanimously approved.

2983
04:57:07,942 --> 04:57:08,163
Okay.

2984
04:57:08,263 --> 04:57:08,963
So we're all set there.

2985
04:57:10,926 --> 04:57:14,308
There is no new business and no reports requested.

2986
04:57:14,329 --> 04:57:16,791
We do have a number of condolences.

2987
04:57:17,771 --> 04:57:29,021
Members of the Medford School Committee express their sincerest condolences to the family of Danny DiGiacomo, Jr., father of Denise Greco, McGlynn paraprofessional and afterschool program assistant.

2990
04:57:48,634 --> 04:57:50,575
If we could all rise for a moment of silence.

2991
04:58:05,758 --> 04:58:12,800
Our next regular meeting is on June 3, 2024 here in Alden Memorial Chambers, Medford City Hall, in addition to Zoom.

2992
04:58:12,820 --> 04:58:16,822
I hope you all join us again soon for happier times.

2993
04:58:17,542 --> 04:58:22,784
And I want to say a special thank you to all the students that celebrated at the beginning of tonight.

2994
04:58:24,444 --> 04:58:30,026
I was really worried about asking people to come to this meeting to be celebrated because it wasn't going to be a fun meeting.

2995
04:58:30,106 --> 04:58:31,827
But honestly, it was what I needed.

2996
04:58:33,267 --> 04:58:35,671
to make it to 10 p.m so thank you.

2997
04:58:36,592 --> 04:58:37,473

2998
04:58:37,513 --> 04:58:39,196

3000
04:58:42,821 --> 04:58:43,502

Have a good evening.
