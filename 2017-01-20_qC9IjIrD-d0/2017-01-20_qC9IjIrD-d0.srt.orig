[SPEAKER_06]: Council President Caviello.

24
00:01:21,955 --> 00:01:22,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

25
00:01:22,775 --> 00:01:31,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, every year I'm taught a service along with Councilor Falco at the corners.

26
00:01:32,455 --> 00:01:37,817
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a service put on by Sam Terabelsi from Hallmark Health and Strong Ambulance.

27
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:47,400
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we're taught every year for the past ten plus years is we're taught CPR, choking, and how to operate a defibrillator.

28
00:01:48,180 --> 00:02:01,165
[SPEAKER_09]: And fortunately, I've never had the opportunity to ever have to use these services, but someone in the audience had to perform CPR on a train going to work one day.

29
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:02,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris Curtin.

30
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:03,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris, do you wanna stand up?

31
00:02:06,401 --> 00:02:07,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris, if you come up to the mic.

32
00:02:07,282 --> 00:02:15,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Those of you who know Chris, Chris is a quiet guy, very reserved.

33
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:22,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris, if you wanna tell the story of what happened on the train, and you know a little bit better than me.

34
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:30,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, well, I took the training from Sean the last couple of years, actually, and stayed at home,

35
00:02:31,723 --> 00:02:36,327
[SPEAKER_05]: the Haymarket T Station on Halloween Day, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon.

36
00:02:36,847 --> 00:02:42,231
[SPEAKER_05]: And John sat down next to me and lost consciousness, but was struggling for breath.

37
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:48,637
[SPEAKER_05]: So one person went down to the end of the platform to hit the panic button, and I called 911.

38
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:53,120
[SPEAKER_05]: And then John stopped struggling.

39
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,121
[SPEAKER_05]: He stopped breathing.

40
00:02:54,181 --> 00:03:00,386
[SPEAKER_05]: So I put him down onto the platform of the train and did exactly what Shawn Mangan taught us to do.

41
00:03:01,508 --> 00:03:08,452
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the points that the pointers that he and teachings that he gave us just kicked right in.

42
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:20,399
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was able to do, I don't know how long I was doing chest compressions on John, but the EMTs and the paramedics showed up.

43
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:24,301
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how many minutes it was, if it was 10 or more, but it felt like a lifetime.

44
00:03:25,422 --> 00:03:27,403
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll tell you, I never,

45
00:03:28,118 --> 00:03:35,340
[SPEAKER_05]: felt a more greater feeling of relief than the moment I saw all the professionals show up in the work that they did.

46
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Incredibly impressive.

47
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:54,164
[SPEAKER_05]: I walked away from that experience really dumbfounded that day and incredibly impressed with the type of work that they do every day without, with very little recognition.

48
00:03:54,224 --> 00:03:56,545
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm incredibly pleased that

49
00:03:57,063 --> 00:04:04,205
[SPEAKER_05]: the city council and you, Mr. President, Mr. Carvey, uh, counsel Caraviello, uh, recognizing Armstrong ambulance and Hallmark health.

50
00:04:04,805 --> 00:04:16,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Sean Mangan and Sam Tara Belsey in particular, uh, for the, for the generous, uh, uh, volunteer work that they do, uh, to teach us this, you'd never think you're going to need to use this.

51
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:22,549
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, I wish, uh, I, I don't, I hope I never have to use it again, but, um, I'm so happy it worked out.

52
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,870
[SPEAKER_05]: And Pauline, uh, John's wife reached out to me.

53
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:29,126
[SPEAKER_05]: five weeks after the incident and she wrote a really nice letter.

54
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:43,228
[SPEAKER_05]: She got the police report, the T police report and got my contact information and wrote a really nice card and a beautiful letter and we got together for lunch and then the rest kind of took off from there.

55
00:04:43,248 --> 00:04:53,011
[SPEAKER_05]: A colleague of mine in the juvenile court wrote a letter to the Kiwanis and that's how the council, Mr Rick, you became aware of this.

56
00:04:53,131 --> 00:04:55,351
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I really appreciate the,

57
00:04:55,899 --> 00:05:01,302
[SPEAKER_05]: all the kind words, all the flattering compliments that I've received from family, friends, and colleagues.

58
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:16,952
[SPEAKER_05]: But I really want to point out that the most important and the people that really deserve the credit and should get all the congratulations are the people like Sean and all of the first responders, police, fire, EMTs, paramedics.

59
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:23,937
[SPEAKER_05]: When you see them at work, up close and personal, it's just beyond impressive.

60
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really glad that they're here tonight to be honored by the council.

61
00:05:28,252 --> 00:05:28,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

62
00:05:29,092 --> 00:05:30,653
[SPEAKER_09]: If you could introduce the family.

63
00:05:33,635 --> 00:05:35,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris, if you could introduce the family.

64
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:57,902
[SPEAKER_05]: who tells me he's recovering nicely, thanks to the paramedics at EMTs and the people at, the professionals at Mass General Hospital.

65
00:05:58,403 --> 00:06:00,585
[SPEAKER_05]: And John tells me he's doing well.

66
00:06:01,265 --> 00:06:02,226
[SPEAKER_09]: John, if you'd like to say something.

67
00:06:03,106 --> 00:06:06,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much for him and for the EMTs.

68
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:11,573
[SPEAKER_09]: And Sean, Sean Manganer, John, if you could stand up and be recognized, and Sam.

69
00:06:18,206 --> 00:06:24,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the guys that make it happen, and they teach us every year, because CPR changes every year.

70
00:06:24,888 --> 00:06:33,690
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I've never had a chance, I've never had an opportunity to use it, and I hope I never do, but again, Chris, he learned it, and it came right up, and Chris, I want to thank you.

71
00:06:34,531 --> 00:06:45,914
[SPEAKER_09]: And Sam, and Sean, again, Sean is a great ambassador for Armstrong Ambulance, and Sam is a great ambassador for Hallmark Health, and they're great community partners.

72
00:06:46,522 --> 00:06:49,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, as you can tell, they're in credit.

73
00:06:49,307 --> 00:06:54,917
[SPEAKER_05]: They do not seek out the spotlight, but they really deserve a lot of credit and recognition.

74
00:06:55,018 --> 00:06:55,879
[SPEAKER_09]: They do.

75
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:58,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris, I'd like to give you a citation.

76
00:06:58,724 --> 00:06:58,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

77
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:20,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

78
00:07:21,587 --> 00:07:30,115
[SPEAKER_09]: The Memphis City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council accommodation to Chris Curtin in recognition for his life-saving actions performed on a Memphis resident.

79
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:35,421
[SPEAKER_09]: The Memphis City Council extends a sincere congratulations on your heroic action.

80
00:07:36,702 --> 00:07:36,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

81
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:06,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair will be in recess for one minute.

82
00:09:40,207 --> 00:09:50,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Just if I also could, I just want to recognize one of Medford's own that was just recognized here tonight, Sean Magnin.

83
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:59,592
[SPEAKER_06]: He received back a few years back a distinct honor by the American Ambulance Association regarding the Boston Marathon.

84
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Sean was the first responder

85
00:10:02,347 --> 00:10:04,268
[SPEAKER_06]: and was recognized nationally.

86
00:10:05,008 --> 00:10:10,270
[SPEAKER_06]: And really, he's done yeoman's work in this effort, and we appreciate, Sean, all your work.

87
00:10:18,954 --> 00:10:19,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

88
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:30,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Before we get back, I want to introduce our new reporter for the transcript, Ethan Hartley.

89
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:41,318
[SPEAKER_09]: It can be taken over, so I hope to see some good writing from you in the future.

90
00:10:41,578 --> 00:10:43,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Positive good writing.

91
00:10:49,162 --> 00:10:53,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Positive, that's right.

92
00:10:53,605 --> 00:10:55,886
[SPEAKER_09]: 16, 17, 030, offered by Councilor Lungo-Kern.

93
00:10:56,486 --> 00:11:03,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the administration reach out to Park Medford with regards to improperly ticketing those who have paid accordingly.

94
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it further resolved that a representative from Park Medford

95
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:12,951
[SPEAKER_09]: 10 day metric city council meeting of the whole to discuss the issues or problems that are still occurring.

96
00:11:13,932 --> 00:11:15,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Council member Kern.

97
00:11:16,193 --> 00:11:16,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

98
00:11:16,613 --> 00:11:18,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, president Caraviello.

99
00:11:19,715 --> 00:11:28,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that I think yourself has been requesting that park method come to a committee of the whole meeting or a city council meeting.

100
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:33,803
[SPEAKER_03]: So we could sit down and discuss what has been going on in the last several months with park Medford.

101
00:11:34,342 --> 00:11:41,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially since now we had, it was sold, bought and sold, and we're dealing with a new contract.

102
00:11:41,544 --> 00:11:47,086
[SPEAKER_03]: And as of recent, the complaints have really been coming in.

103
00:11:47,126 --> 00:11:52,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if my colleagues have realized or witnessed the same thing.

104
00:11:53,350 --> 00:12:06,119
[SPEAKER_03]: One complaint leads to another, and people are now going public with their complaints, which leads to a whole host of issues that bring light to our eyes and make us realize what is going on.

105
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:12,743
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like there was a lot of kinks that needed to be worked out and a lot of changes that should have been made with the old administration.

106
00:12:13,224 --> 00:12:17,006
[SPEAKER_03]: But now, the last nine months, it seems like things are going downhill.

107
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:19,768
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if that's because of the purchase and sale.

108
00:12:20,363 --> 00:12:22,525
[SPEAKER_03]: or what's really going on in that office.

109
00:12:22,605 --> 00:12:26,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear it's really a disgrace to work with.

110
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:30,213
[SPEAKER_03]: When you go in, nobody has the correct information.

111
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:35,758
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a complaint this week with regards to somebody who was just going down to get her parking permit pass.

112
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:39,622
[SPEAKER_03]: She brought the proper documentation with her to get that pass.

113
00:12:39,982 --> 00:12:44,207
[SPEAKER_03]: They sent her out the door without the pass telling her she needed A, B, and C.

114
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:48,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, she went back with somebody that knew exactly what she needed.

115
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:53,622
[SPEAKER_03]: She had brought the correct documentation the first time, and it was corrected the second time she went in.

116
00:12:54,122 --> 00:13:06,106
[SPEAKER_03]: But she should have been saved that second trip if people at Park Medford knew exactly the rules and regulations and what needs to be collected in order to get that parking permit pass.

117
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:14,869
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also had several complaints with regards to people that are, one of the big ones that was upsetting was a woman

118
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:24,684
[SPEAKER_03]: taking her child out of the car, went and paid for parking to head into the Medford Public Library, and paid for parking, and then five minutes later, got a ticket.

119
00:13:25,284 --> 00:13:31,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you got that complaint, you realize that this is happening to several people.

120
00:13:31,187 --> 00:13:37,289
[SPEAKER_03]: They're paying for parking accordingly, and five, 10 minutes later, they're getting a ticket incorrectly.

121
00:13:37,749 --> 00:13:44,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, for that to happen maybe once or twice, it's one thing, but I've got about six complaints with regards to that in the last couple weeks.

122
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:47,396
[SPEAKER_03]: So something needs to be corrected.

123
00:13:47,496 --> 00:13:48,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Something needs to be done.

124
00:13:49,457 --> 00:13:59,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Another issue is with regards to when you do get a ticket and you pay that ticket, that should obviously be recorded in some sort of system that Park Medford has.

125
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:04,359
[SPEAKER_03]: But people have been complaining that they've gone to the registry to try to renew their license.

126
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,620
[SPEAKER_03]: And for some reason, it hasn't been recorded.

127
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,661
[SPEAKER_03]: And those tickets have been improperly sent to the registry.

128
00:14:11,281 --> 00:14:13,361
[SPEAKER_03]: And people have been turned away from the registry.

129
00:14:14,408 --> 00:14:20,992
[SPEAKER_03]: not being able to renew their license because it's showing that they had a ticket, although they have their receipts and they've paid for those tickets.

130
00:14:21,892 --> 00:14:27,575
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are three, three or four different issues that I've got complaints of in the last four to six weeks.

131
00:14:28,256 --> 00:14:30,657
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I've, I have emailed the chief of police.

132
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:36,880
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he's helped me with a couple things, but I've also requested, and hopefully I'll hear back from him soon.

133
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,082
[SPEAKER_03]: I've asked that he specifically talk to Park Medford.

134
00:14:40,102 --> 00:14:41,863
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he was almost the ambassador

135
00:14:42,622 --> 00:14:51,070
[SPEAKER_03]: of what has been going on, and he's done a tremendous amount of work to try to get the—within the last two years to try to get it up and running.

136
00:14:51,150 --> 00:15:03,882
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's just so many improper things that are going on, and people seem to—I don't know if they're not trained correctly or they're—some people even online are saying that they feel like these tickets are given out of spite at some point.

137
00:15:04,302 --> 00:15:07,305
[SPEAKER_03]: They're joking with the people, saying, yeah, of course I'm going to give—you know, it's

138
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,042
[SPEAKER_03]: what I hear is going on is not right and we need to get a grasp on it.

139
00:15:12,142 --> 00:15:25,209
[SPEAKER_03]: The chief of police hopefully will reach out to Park Medford, but I think it's really important that also this city council sits down and ask the appropriate questions, make sure we let them know how unhappy we are and what our residents are going through.

140
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:30,272
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got complaints from people outside of the city as well, which you know, can't be unnoticed.

141
00:15:30,912 --> 00:15:36,595
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope the administration, you know, is, is getting these complaints to, or, you know, reading up online when,

142
00:15:36,998 --> 00:15:41,300
[SPEAKER_03]: things are posted because the administration needs to get a grasp on this.

143
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:46,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Little tweaks were made, I believe, in January, but that's just not enough.

144
00:15:46,723 --> 00:15:51,725
[SPEAKER_03]: What has been going on is people are not happy, and again, it's going downhill.

145
00:15:52,206 --> 00:15:55,647
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we need to get a grasp on it, and this council needs to take the lead.

146
00:15:55,708 --> 00:16:06,433
[SPEAKER_03]: So I ask that, Council President, we try to get Park Medford down to a Committee of the Whole meeting so we can sit and roundtable it and discuss what's been going on and the complaints we've been hearing.

147
00:16:06,843 --> 00:16:08,404
[SPEAKER_03]: and why they're not being corrected.

148
00:16:08,424 --> 00:16:11,927
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been asking since January for a meeting of last year.

149
00:16:12,387 --> 00:16:15,630
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe now that you're in control, we can get that done.

150
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:20,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I would say that we should have Dan Nash down here within the next two weeks.

151
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a committee of the whole meeting, just so we have the full hour.

152
00:16:24,056 --> 00:16:28,700
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think he needs to come and talk to the people too, publicly, because people are not happy.

153
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:34,364
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really a shame that after two, three years we can't get it

154
00:16:35,078 --> 00:17:02,276
[SPEAKER_03]: we can't get under control and whether that's because it was bought and sold or what's, I don't know what's going on, but at least people in the office should be educated and people who are out there giving tickets should be taking the time to make sure they're certain this A, B, and C haven't paid for parking so that they can't, you know, cause then people have to number one, either pay the ticket, fight the ticket, get upset, go to Diane McLeod to appeal it, go to Park Medford.

155
00:17:02,296 --> 00:17:04,297
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to take time out of their busy schedule.

156
00:17:05,005 --> 00:17:08,168
[SPEAKER_03]: that they could be doing other things to try to fight these tickets, and it's not right.

157
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:10,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

158
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:13,973
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion, second?

159
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:14,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call.

160
00:17:15,054 --> 00:17:17,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call is seconded by Councillor Falco.

161
00:17:17,956 --> 00:17:20,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call has been requested.

162
00:17:21,139 --> 00:17:22,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

163

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

165
00:17:25,983 --> 00:17:26,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Councillor Falco.

166
00:17:26,803 --> 00:17:27,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

167
00:17:27,764 --> 00:17:28,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Councillor Knight.

168
00:17:29,686 --> 00:17:29,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

169
00:17:29,866 --> 00:17:30,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Councillor McKernan.

170
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:30,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

171
00:17:31,569 --> 00:17:32,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Marx.

172
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:32,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

173
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scafelli.

174
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:34,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

175
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Cabrillo.

176
00:17:37,031 --> 00:17:37,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

177
00:17:38,011 --> 00:17:38,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven in the affirmative.

178
00:17:39,212 --> 00:17:40,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Then the motion passes.

179
00:17:41,413 --> 00:17:47,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion by Councilor Dela Ruzzo to take paper 17-029 out of order.

180
00:17:51,377 --> 00:17:54,418
[SPEAKER_09]: All in favor?

181
00:17:54,498 --> 00:17:54,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

182
00:17:54,938 --> 00:17:55,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

183
00:17:55,218 --> 00:18:00,460
[SPEAKER_09]: 17029, petition for a signed denial reversal by Edward Batten, Batten Brothers, Inc.

184
00:18:01,162 --> 00:18:05,624
[SPEAKER_09]: For Maple Park condominiums, 65 Valley Street, Medford.

185
00:18:05,864 --> 00:18:17,370
[SPEAKER_09]: OCD application 01-17 exceeds allowable size 94-306-5C.

186
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks of the signed committee.

187
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:21,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

188
00:18:22,372 --> 00:18:25,894
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have a gentleman here from, I believe, the sign company.

189
00:18:26,174 --> 00:18:26,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

190
00:18:26,394 --> 00:18:28,015
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can address the council.

191
00:18:29,015 --> 00:18:29,896
[SPEAKER_01]: My name's Ed Badden.

192
00:18:30,641 --> 00:18:31,981
[SPEAKER_01]: work with Batten Brother Signs.

193
00:18:32,842 --> 00:18:38,283
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now we're just requesting approval for the size of our signage.

194
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:46,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now it's at four by six feet, which is, I'm about five foot 10, a couple inches wider than my wingspan.

195
00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:51,107
[SPEAKER_01]: And we feel a sign of this size is necessary for the property where it's located.

196
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Maple Park Condominiums,

197
00:18:55,127 --> 00:19:00,250
[SPEAKER_01]: occupies the entire building at this, excuse me, at this address.

198
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:07,414
[SPEAKER_01]: And the business also occupies a whole street block, which comes into close to 34,000 square feet.

199
00:19:07,594 --> 00:19:14,518
[SPEAKER_01]: And we feel as though one 24 square foot sign should be acceptable for the amount of space that they are occupying.

200
00:19:14,538 --> 00:19:15,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

201
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:18,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

202
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, this is purely a request to seek variance just based upon the size of the sign.

203
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:30,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Presently, the current sign ordinance would read that the square footage of the sign cannot exceed 12 feet.

204
00:19:31,114 --> 00:19:32,715
[SPEAKER_07]: So that sign would be six by two.

205
00:19:33,316 --> 00:19:34,737
[SPEAKER_07]: The sign here is six by four.

206
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:39,200
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that this is a measure that I wholeheartedly support.

207
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:44,623
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it will not have much of an impact on the quality of life in the neighborhood by passing traffic, so on and so forth.

208
00:19:45,931 --> 00:19:46,392
[SPEAKER_07]: renderings.

209
00:19:46,492 --> 00:19:51,376
[SPEAKER_07]: The sign is about a six or so feet off of the sidewalk, Mr. President.

210
00:19:51,396 --> 00:19:53,038
[SPEAKER_07]: So it has a ample setback.

211
00:19:53,218 --> 00:19:58,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, really all it is is just so that the letters on the sign can be larger so people can have an easier time reading it, which I think will make it safer actually.

212
00:19:59,104 --> 00:19:59,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

213
00:19:59,484 --> 00:20:00,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Move approval.

214
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Del Rosso.

215
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I concur with my colleague.

216
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:08,673
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this sign would make a wonderful addition, uh, aesthetically to the neighborhood.

217
00:20:09,047 --> 00:20:20,815
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll identify the domicile there, uh, in an area that, uh, suffers from a brisk rate of traffic with also abrupt stopping at the stoplights at Fulton street.

218
00:20:21,476 --> 00:20:25,979
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, this will help people in search of the condo complex.

219
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:26,759
[SPEAKER_08]: I second.

220
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:27,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

221
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have a motion by Councilor Marks, the science chairman?

222
00:20:30,702 --> 00:20:31,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Mr. President.

223
00:20:32,003 --> 00:20:38,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, this is, um, a newly constructed, uh, entrance, uh, into the building itself.

224
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:44,235
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was beautiful craftsmanship done constructing this new entrance.

225
00:20:44,975 --> 00:20:47,356
[SPEAKER_06]: And I see no problem with this particular sign.

226
00:20:47,736 --> 00:20:52,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I think aesthetically it fits in to the property and the neighborhood.

227
00:20:53,178 --> 00:20:55,359
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would motion for approval, Mr. President.

228
00:20:55,439 --> 00:21:00,441
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

229
00:21:00,481 --> 00:21:01,281
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

230
00:21:02,822 --> 00:21:03,902
[SPEAKER_09]: All said, thank you very much.

231
00:21:04,242 --> 00:21:04,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

232
00:21:04,983 --> 00:21:05,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

233
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:11,170
[SPEAKER_09]: We have one more, one thing I want to say, Mr. Councilor Knight.

234
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:28,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved, offered by Councilor Scott Pelley, be it resolved that the council and the, Councilor Scott, I can't read your writing.

235
00:21:28,318 --> 00:21:34,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it offered by Councilor Scott Pelley that we get an update on the focus group on recreation.

236
00:21:34,981 --> 00:21:35,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scott Pelley.

237
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:38,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't thank you, Mr. President.

238
00:21:39,437 --> 00:21:45,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been the chairperson for the focus group on recreation for the last three months.

239
00:21:46,201 --> 00:22:01,690
[SPEAKER_04]: And the group has been working diligently making sure that we are covering all of our bases and making sure that we're getting all the information that the administration would need to bring a full time recreation department in the city of Medford.

240
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:05,212
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why I bring this up, we'll have a full report soon.

241
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:34,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, this week we'll be sending out a, uh, the administration will be sending out a survey that we're asking all of our constituents to spend about two or three minutes and it will be very helpful to see what, what, um, not just a few people, not just the 20 people that are on the focus group or myself, but what, uh, most of our constituents are looking for and, um, and give us a better idea in which direction we'll go when this council have to make, have to make a decision.

242
00:22:34,537 --> 00:22:35,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

243
00:22:35,963 --> 00:22:40,786
[SPEAKER_04]: and the city administration has to make a decision to allow this wonderful opportunity.

244
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:42,327
[SPEAKER_04]: So look out for that.

245
00:22:42,387 --> 00:22:44,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that, uh, it'll be on the city website.

246
00:22:44,969 --> 00:22:50,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, there'll be a press release soon and there'll be, um, there'll be doing a verse nine one one.

247
00:22:50,513 --> 00:22:57,878
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that, um, for all the students in, um, in the school systems that will have that online too.

248
00:22:57,978 --> 00:22:59,899
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, thank you very much.

249
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

250
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,461
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Councilor Scott, probably for all your hard work.

251
00:23:02,801 --> 00:23:03,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor DelaRusso.

252
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:04,963
[SPEAKER_08]: President, I just want to,

253
00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:19,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Lord, Councilor Scarpelli and the group who've done great work in advancing a central clearinghouse of sorts for all the recreational entities within the community.

254
00:23:20,061 --> 00:23:31,743
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great thing that fosters cohesion in our community and provides great opportunity for the young ones and also for parents to get involved and stay connected to the generation coming up.

255
00:23:32,103 --> 00:23:33,763
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a wonderful thing and I think

256
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:36,769
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, the counselor in the group for their good work.

257
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:37,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President.

258
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:38,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

259
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Counselor Mox.

260
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

261
00:23:40,832 --> 00:23:43,134
[SPEAKER_06]: I too want to thank a counselor, Scott Pelly.

262
00:23:43,154 --> 00:23:56,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, you couldn't have appointed a better person that has the insight and knowledge already, uh, regarding, uh, recreation, how departments established, what the needs are, uh, staffing wise for a city this size.

263
00:23:57,166 --> 00:24:02,550
[SPEAKER_06]: And I look forward to, uh, the, or eventual recommendations and implementation, Mr. President.

264
00:24:03,057 --> 00:24:06,640
[SPEAKER_06]: of a long needed recreational department in this city.

265
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:08,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

266
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Counselor Monks, counselor Falco.

267
00:24:11,663 --> 00:24:12,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

268
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:15,226
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to thank councilor Scott Pelley for his hard work on this issue.

269
00:24:15,927 --> 00:24:24,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, uh, I know him and his, uh, committee has been working on this for a while and, uh, they've had a lot of meetings and, um, I'm hearing a lot of great things.

270
00:24:24,773 --> 00:24:29,977
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look forward to, uh, the results of the survey and the, uh, the formal report from the committee.

271
00:24:30,654 --> 00:24:40,657
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this, uh, recreation department, in my opinion, and I think you'd agree is long overdue and a city of this size, I think could benefit greatly from a recreation department.

272
00:24:40,677 --> 00:24:41,937
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for your hard work on this.

273
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:42,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

274
00:24:42,697 --> 00:24:46,819
[SPEAKER_09]: The council member motion to receive council.

275
00:24:46,879 --> 00:24:47,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

276
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:47,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, thank you.

277
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, president Carviello.

278
00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:51,860
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to thank the committee and council Scarpelli.

279
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:59,102
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could just reiterate, when will the survey be coming out and how will we get a, how will we be able to access it?

280
00:24:59,142 --> 00:24:59,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Just,

281
00:25:00,377 --> 00:25:00,817
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed that.

282
00:25:00,837 --> 00:25:01,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

283
00:25:01,137 --> 00:25:08,381
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will, we will have it, uh, there'll be, um, uh, survey monkey, uh, attachment on the city's website.

284
00:25:09,261 --> 00:25:16,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we'll have hard copies at a few locations like the library and some other visible sites.

285
00:25:17,406 --> 00:25:20,307
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, we'll be doing reverse nine one one.

286
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:30,052
[SPEAKER_04]: So everyone, uh, from, uh, preschool to seniors have an opportunity to, uh, add their opinions and what they feel.

287
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:35,252
[SPEAKER_04]: or if they feel that a recreation department would do without to our community for our community.

288
00:25:35,852 --> 00:25:49,717
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, uh, we'll also be reaching out to all the schools via the, via the, uh, the student sites for their parents and students work together and to get the most information that we can get to make, uh,

289
00:25:50,343 --> 00:25:51,643
[SPEAKER_04]: prudent decision moving forward.

290
00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:52,884
[SPEAKER_04]: So pretty excited about it.

291
00:25:53,164 --> 00:25:53,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

292
00:25:53,624 --> 00:25:59,406
[SPEAKER_03]: And when should we look at this and what, how long, how long a timeframe will they be serving?

293
00:25:59,466 --> 00:26:00,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Like 30 days?

294
00:26:00,787 --> 00:26:14,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually it should be going out by the end of this week and we'll, we've given two weeks as a timeline to, um, so it's a coordinated effort with, um, you know, with, um, reverse nine one one.

295
00:26:14,903 --> 00:26:25,691
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, city's website and their, their, uh, the news, uh, uh, news release and, uh, and that's, we're looking for for this week.

00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:26,672
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

297
00:26:26,732 --> 00:26:27,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

298
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion by counselor Knight to receive a place in file.

299
00:26:31,575 --> 00:26:32,075
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor.

300
00:26:32,095 --> 00:26:32,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

301
00:26:32,876 --> 00:26:33,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Opposed?

302
00:26:33,496 --> 00:26:34,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

303
00:26:36,739 --> 00:26:38,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion by counselor Knight to revert back to regular business.

304
00:26:40,241 --> 00:26:40,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, brief announcement.

305
00:26:40,802 --> 00:26:41,022
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

306
00:26:42,655 --> 00:26:51,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Mr. President, recently I did have a conversation with our highway superintendent and he asked that, uh, I announced that they will be accepting applications for pothole filling.

307
00:26:51,699 --> 00:26:57,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, uh, always through Seekick click fix or through seven, eight, one, three, nine, three, two, four, four, five.

308
00:26:57,121 --> 00:27:01,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, uh, the highway superintendent did ask that I announce this at the meeting because they have been out patching.

309
00:27:03,743 --> 00:27:04,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

310
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion by Councilor Knight to revert back to regular business.

311
00:27:12,018 --> 00:27:28,730
[SPEAKER_09]: 17-028 offered by Councilor Knight and President Caraviello, being resolved that the Memphis City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of former Memphis High Boys Varsity hockey coach, Charlie Driscoll, on his recent passing.

312
00:27:29,151 --> 00:27:29,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

313
00:27:30,572 --> 00:27:32,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

314
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:40,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone, being someone who doesn't know how to ice skate, but who certainly enjoyed watching hockey games growing up, I remember sitting in the stands at La Conte rink and

315
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:47,502
[SPEAKER_07]: listening to Mr. Driscoll, Coach Driscoll, coach at the top of his lungs from across the rink.

316
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:48,563
[SPEAKER_07]: But he did a great job.

317
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:50,744
[SPEAKER_07]: He really put Medford hockey on the map.

318
00:27:50,764 --> 00:27:55,366
[SPEAKER_07]: And as a child growing up, the greater Boston league was very competitive in the sport of hockey.

319
00:27:55,386 --> 00:27:58,128
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was always Arlington and Medford battling for the top spot.

320
00:27:58,728 --> 00:28:00,569
[SPEAKER_07]: And then everybody else fell in behind us.

321
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:03,671
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of that had to do with great players and a lot of it had to do with great coaching.

322
00:28:04,171 --> 00:28:07,513
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mr. Driscoll had a great deal of success here in the city of Medford.

323
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:17,417
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember my freshman year in high school watching Sean Bates and Eddie Buckley skate at the Boston Garden in the Super 8 Tournament versus Catholic Memorial with Coach Driscoll on the bench, and it brings back great memories.

324
00:28:17,477 --> 00:28:19,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very sad to see him go.

325
00:28:19,138 --> 00:28:25,142
[SPEAKER_07]: He was someone that meant to a lot of young men in this community, and he will be sorely and sadly missed, Mr. President.

326
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:29,265
[SPEAKER_07]: I offer my deep condolences to his family, and I ask that the council join me.

327
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:29,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

328
00:28:30,906 --> 00:28:31,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Counsel Scott Pellett.

329
00:28:32,164 --> 00:28:50,115
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can, as a former colleague and fellow coach in the Method System, we often sat in meetings together with Coach Driscoll, and we'd be fighting for different awards for our Mustangs, and there wasn't a person that fought harder for their kid, his kids, than Coach Driscoll.

330
00:28:50,535 --> 00:28:59,180
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a charisma about him and an aura about him that you could really appreciate today's world of coaching.

331
00:29:00,336 --> 00:29:03,937
[SPEAKER_04]: He was special, and he'll definitely greatly be missed.

332
00:29:04,557 --> 00:29:10,839
[SPEAKER_04]: He's laid the groundwork for a lot of great coaches today that he has mentored, and he'll be missed.

333
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:12,299
[SPEAKER_04]: The President Thank you.

334
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:13,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks.

335
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:15,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks Thank you, Mr. President.

336
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,481
[SPEAKER_06]: I, too, got to know Mr. Driscoll when I served as a member of the school committee.

337
00:29:21,181 --> 00:29:28,403
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can tell you, he was not only respected in this community, but he was well respected across the entire state.

338
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:29,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

339
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,443
[SPEAKER_06]: And as Counselor Scott Pelley mentioned, he always put the kids first, no matter what it was.

340
00:29:35,963 --> 00:29:37,764
[SPEAKER_06]: And he'd go to bat and fight for the kids.

341
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:51,432
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was at meetings where he would stand up, Mr. President, against school administration and against anyone else that he felt was doing something that was against his students and his hockey players.

342
00:29:52,012 --> 00:29:55,634
[SPEAKER_06]: And I respected him for that, and he will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

343
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:58,116
[SPEAKER_09]: The President Thank you, Counselor Marks.

344
00:29:59,095 --> 00:30:03,257
[SPEAKER_09]: I've known Charlie Driscoll for many years, you know, through the Meffitt hockey community.

345
00:30:03,277 --> 00:30:09,541
[SPEAKER_09]: And Charlie is responsible for many kids going to college and the pros, um, Olympic hockey teams.

346
00:30:09,981 --> 00:30:11,762
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, Charlie is a good man.

347
00:30:11,822 --> 00:30:13,583
[SPEAKER_09]: And they say he, Councillor Knight was right.

348
00:30:13,623 --> 00:30:17,345
[SPEAKER_09]: He put, he put Meffitt hockey on the map and again, he will be missed.

349
00:30:17,385 --> 00:30:18,706
[SPEAKER_09]: If we could have a moment of silence, please.

350
00:30:35,332 --> 00:30:44,760
[SPEAKER_09]: 17-031 offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council send its condolences to the family of Ernest Casasa on his recent passing.

351
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:49,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Casasa was a Navy veteran who served our country in World War II.

352
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:55,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Casasa is a neighbor of mine, and again, his presence in my neighborhood will be missed.

353
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:58,592
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, if we could have a moment of silence for him also.

354
00:31:12,656 --> 00:31:16,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion by Councilor Scott Pelli to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

355
00:31:18,958 --> 00:31:19,558
[SPEAKER_09]: I can move it.

356
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:33,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Offered by Councilor Mox, be it resolved that the owner of Wet Cuts, Kathy Bianco, be recognized for being in business for the past 22 years in the city of Medford.

357
00:31:33,943 --> 00:31:34,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Mox.

358
00:31:35,364 --> 00:31:36,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

359
00:31:36,624 --> 00:31:39,525
[SPEAKER_06]: If anyone's aware of Kathy Bianco and Wet Cuts,

360
00:31:40,308 --> 00:31:59,556
[SPEAKER_06]: She was located on Boston Ave for a number of years and has been in business in this city for over 22 years, Mr. President, and has been an outstanding businessperson in this community and has serviced thousands of Meffitt residents, Mr. President, with a hair coloring, a perm, or a wiffle.

361
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:03,497
[SPEAKER_06]: She ran the Gambit in that particular shop over there.

362
00:32:03,778 --> 00:32:09,920
[SPEAKER_06]: And she is still going to be cutting hair, but will no longer be at that location, Mr. President.

363
00:32:10,593 --> 00:32:13,474
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to wish her well on her future endeavors.

364
00:32:14,155 --> 00:32:19,977
[SPEAKER_06]: She will be, she was a staple in the Boston Ave area, and she will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

365
00:32:20,057 --> 00:32:20,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Where she will be to?

366
00:32:21,437 --> 00:32:25,459
[SPEAKER_06]: She will be on the road, I guess, so she doesn't have a fixed location.

367
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:32,342
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, she had a number of distinguished people in this community, former President Robert Mayorko.

368
00:32:32,981 --> 00:32:33,962
[SPEAKER_06]: got his haircut there.

369
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:36,644
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, very quickly.

370
00:32:38,146 --> 00:32:39,227
[SPEAKER_06]: He was a great customer.

371
00:32:39,347 --> 00:32:40,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Very little work.

372
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:42,750
[SPEAKER_06]: But he got his haircut there.

373
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:48,095
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I said, Mr. President, it was like the neighborhood coffee shop.

374
00:32:48,135 --> 00:32:50,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone would go in there, get your haircut, make small talk.

375
00:32:51,518 --> 00:32:56,583
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to thank Kathy Bianco for her many years of business in this community, Mr. President.

376
00:32:57,283 --> 00:32:57,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

377
00:32:57,924 --> 00:33:00,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Receive a council citation for years of service.

378
00:33:00,065 --> 00:33:00,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

379
00:33:00,305 --> 00:33:00,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

380
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:05,448
[SPEAKER_09]: We will, uh, if you'd like to, uh, better up here in the next couple of weeks, we can get, we can get her a citation.

381
00:33:05,588 --> 00:33:08,350
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if she's much for the public eye, but, uh, we'll see.

382
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,031
[SPEAKER_06]: You can invite her up.

383
00:33:09,271 --> 00:33:09,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

384
00:33:11,972 --> 00:33:23,860
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion by, uh, customer night, all in favor of the post motion passes offered by counselor night and counselor carrier of yellow being resolved at the Memphis city council.

385
00:33:24,332 --> 00:33:32,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Send his condolences to the family of Grace Richmond, longtime Medford resident and election inspector for the city of Medford.

386
00:33:33,731 --> 00:33:34,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

387
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:36,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

388
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:37,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

389
00:33:37,393 --> 00:33:39,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Richmond will be sorely missed in our community.

390
00:33:39,815 --> 00:33:46,119
[SPEAKER_07]: She was a member of our faith-based community here in West Medford with relationships with St.

391
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:46,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Rayfield's Church.

392
00:33:46,779 --> 00:33:59,127
[SPEAKER_07]: And she was also an election official here in the city of Medford who gave a great deal of her time dedicated to the public to make sure that our elections moved smoothly and made sure that Clerk Finn had an easier time on election day because of the hard work that she did.

393
00:33:59,187 --> 00:34:00,888
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, Mr. President,

394
00:34:01,851 --> 00:34:05,137
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to extend my deep condolences to her family and ask that the council join me in doing so.

395
00:34:05,197 --> 00:34:05,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

396
00:34:05,938 --> 00:34:06,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Dela Rosa.

397
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, council.

398
00:34:09,825 --> 00:34:10,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

399
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:12,930
[SPEAKER_09]: If we could stand for a moment of silence, please.

400
00:34:24,775 --> 00:34:25,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Dela Ruzzo.

401
00:34:26,738 --> 00:34:37,834
[SPEAKER_08]: May I take this opportunity to kindly recommend with the change of leadership in our body that yourself and Councilor Marks be

402
00:34:40,217 --> 00:34:49,307
[SPEAKER_08]: take the helm as being the two spokespersons for this body with regards to a legal matter pending in the courts.

403
00:34:49,848 --> 00:34:55,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, we will make that change and I will notify the attorney and Councilor Marks.

404
00:34:56,855 --> 00:34:59,418
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to keep Councilor Longo on the position where she is an attorney.

405
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:06,953
[SPEAKER_09]: and neither one of us are attorneys, and I think we can use Councilor Lango's legal expertise.

406
00:35:07,253 --> 00:35:14,257
[SPEAKER_08]: I found that the attorney that we're paying to engage brings great legal expertise to this.

407
00:35:14,457 --> 00:35:14,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

408
00:35:16,858 --> 00:35:18,279
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion, Councilor Del Rosso.

409
00:35:18,319 --> 00:35:19,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lango-Grant.

410
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:27,523
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to know what the resolution was, because I, too, I mean, it's been quite a while I've been dealing with it.

411
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:29,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Currently, yourself and Councilor Del Rosso

412
00:35:29,865 --> 00:35:32,387
[SPEAKER_09]: are the go-to person for the suit in regards to Love Street.

413
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:36,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I'd be happy to stay on and communicate with.

414
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:40,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, so we would just change it to myself and Councilor Moxley to say if you wouldn't mind.

415
00:35:41,192 --> 00:35:42,112
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to stay on, please.

416
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:43,173
[SPEAKER_09]: If you wouldn't mind staying on.

417
00:35:43,193 --> 00:35:48,456
