    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=8.58s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=10.08s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=11.101s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=12.041s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=13.062s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=13.982s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=15.303s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=16.283s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=17.984s">Vice</a>  President Marks.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=29.849s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=34.232s">and</a>  to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=50.219s">Motions,</a>  orders, and resolutions, paper 17-027, offered by President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=57.662s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council commend and congratulate Chris Curtin, <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=62.289s">for</a>  his life-saving actions performed on a Medford resident that he be presented with a council accommodation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=69.031s">Be</a>  it further resolved that we recognize Sean Magnin of Armstrong Ambulance and Sam Tabalesi of Hallmark Health for making the life-saving classes available. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=79.814s">Council</a>  President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=81.955s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=82.775s">Mr.</a>  President, every year I'm taught a service along with Councilor Falco at the corners. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=92.455s">This</a>  is a service put on by Sam Terabelsi from Hallmark Health and Strong Ambulance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=98.417s">And</a>  what we're taught every year for the past ten plus years is we're taught CPR, choking, and how to operate a defibrillator. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=108.18s">And</a>  fortunately, I've never had the opportunity to ever have to use these services, but someone in the audience had to perform CPR on a train going to work one day. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=121.939s">Chris</a>  Curtin. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=122.959s">Chris,</a>  do you wanna stand up? <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=126.401s">Chris,</a>  if you come up to the mic. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=127.282s">Those</a>  of you who know Chris, Chris is a quiet guy, very reserved. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=137.967s">Chris,</a>  if you wanna tell the story of what happened on the train, and you know a little bit better than me.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=142.869s">Sure,</a>  well, I took the training from Sean the last couple of years, actually, and stayed at home, <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=151.723s">the</a>  Haymarket T Station on Halloween Day, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=156.847s">And</a>  John sat down next to me and lost consciousness, but was struggling for breath. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=162.311s">So</a>  one person went down to the end of the platform to hit the panic button, and I called 911. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=169.237s">And</a>  then John stopped struggling. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=173.14s">He</a>  stopped breathing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=174.181s">So</a>  I put him down onto the platform of the train and did exactly what Shawn Mangan taught us to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=181.508s">All</a>  of the points that the pointers that he and teachings that he gave us just kicked right in. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=189.333s">And</a>  I was able to do, I don't know how long I was doing chest compressions on John, but the EMTs and the paramedics showed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=201.139s">I</a>  don't know how many minutes it was, if it was 10 or more, but it felt like a lifetime. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=205.422s">And</a>  I'll tell you, I never, <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=208.118s">felt</a>  a more greater feeling of relief than the moment I saw all the professionals show up in the work that they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=216.5s">Incredibly</a>  impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=218.06s">I</a>  walked away from that experience really dumbfounded that day and incredibly impressed with the type of work that they do every day without, with very little recognition. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=234.224s">So</a>  I'm incredibly pleased that <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=237.063s">the</a>  city council and you, Mr. President, Mr. Carvey, uh, Councilor Caraviello, uh, recognizing Armstrong ambulance and Hallmark health. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=244.805s">Um,</a>  Sean Mangan and Sam Tara Belsey in particular, uh, for the, for the generous, uh, uh, volunteer work that they do, uh, to teach us this, you'd never think you're going to need to use this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=256.048s">And</a>  I, I wish, uh, I, I don't, I hope I never have to use it again, but, um, I'm so happy it worked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=262.929s">And</a>  Pauline, uh, John's wife reached out to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=266.365s">five</a>  weeks after the incident and she wrote a really nice letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=270.286s">She</a>  got the police report, the T police report and got my contact information and wrote a really nice card and a beautiful letter and we got together for lunch and then the rest kind of took off from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=283.248s">A</a>  colleague of mine in the juvenile court wrote a letter to the Kiwanis and that's how the council, Mr. Rick, you became aware of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=293.131s">And</a>  so I really appreciate the, <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=295.899s">all</a>  the kind words, all the flattering compliments that I've received from family, friends, and colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=301.583s">But</a>  I really want to point out that the most important and the people that really deserve the credit and should get all the congratulations are the people like Sean and all of the first responders, police, fire, EMTs, paramedics. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=317.693s">When</a>  you see them at work, up close and personal, it's just beyond impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=324.51s">I'm</a>  really glad that they're here tonight to be honored by the council.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=328.252s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=329.092s">If</a>  you could introduce the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=333.635s">Chris,</a>  if you could introduce the family.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=348.115s">who</a>  tells me he's recovering nicely, thanks to the paramedics at EMTs and the people at, the professionals at Mass General Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=358.403s">And</a>  John tells me he's doing well.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=361.265s">John,</a>  if you'd like to say something.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=363.106s">Thank</a>  you very much for him and for the EMTs.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=366.209s">And</a>  Sean, Sean Manganer, John, if you could stand up and be recognized, and Sam. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=378.206s">Those</a>  are the guys that make it happen, and they teach us every year, because CPR changes every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=384.888s">And</a>  again, I've never had a chance, I've never had an opportunity to use it, and I hope I never do, but again, Chris, he learned it, and it came right up, and Chris, I want to thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=394.531s">And</a>  Sam, and Sean, again, Sean is a great ambassador for Armstrong Ambulance, and Sam is a great ambassador for Hallmark Health, and they're great community partners.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=406.522s">Well,</a>  as you can tell, they're in credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=409.307s">They</a>  do not seek out the spotlight, but they really deserve a lot of credit and recognition.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=415.018s">They</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=415.899s">Chris,</a>  I'd like to give you a citation.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=418.724s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=439.965s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=441.587s">The</a>  Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council accommodation to Chris Curtin in recognition for his life-saving actions performed on a Medford resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=450.716s">The</a>  Medford City Council extends a sincere congratulations on your heroic action. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=456.702s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=485.101s">Chair</a>  will be in recess for one minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=580.207s">Just</a>  if I also could, I just want to recognize one of Medford's own that was just recognized here tonight, Sean Magnin. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=590.649s">He</a>  received back a few years back a distinct honor by the American Ambulance Association regarding the Boston Marathon. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=600.232s">Sean</a>  was the first responder <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=602.347s">and</a>  was recognized nationally. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=605.008s">And</a>  really, he's done yeoman's work in this effort, and we appreciate, Sean, all your work.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=618.954s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=622.555s">Before</a>  we get back, I want to introduce our new reporter for the transcript, Ethan Hartley. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=637.236s">It</a>  can be taken over, so I hope to see some good writing from you in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=641.578s">Positive</a>  good writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=649.162s">Positive,</a>  that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=653.605s">16,</a>  17, 030, offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=656.486s">Be</a>  it resolved that the administration reach out to Park Medford with regards to improperly ticketing those who have paid accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=664.11s">Be</a>  it further resolved that a representative from Park Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=667.528s">10</a>  day metric city council meeting of the whole to discuss the issues or problems that are still occurring. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=673.932s">Council</a>  member Kern.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=676.193s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=676.613s">Um,</a>  president Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=679.715s">I</a>  know that I think yourself has been requesting that park method come to a committee of the whole meeting or a city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=688.78s">So</a>  we could sit down and discuss what has been going on in the last several months with park Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=694.342s">Especially</a>  since now we had, it was sold, bought and sold, and we're dealing with a new contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=701.544s">And</a>  as of recent, the complaints have really been coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=707.126s">I'm</a>  not sure if my colleagues have realized or witnessed the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=713.35s">One</a>  complaint leads to another, and people are now going public with their complaints, which leads to a whole host of issues that bring light to our eyes and make us realize what is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=726.519s">It</a>  seems like there was a lot of kinks that needed to be worked out and a lot of changes that should have been made with the old administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=733.224s">But</a>  now, the last nine months, it seems like things are going downhill. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=737.066s">And</a>  I don't know if that's because of the purchase and sale. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=740.363s">or</a>  what's really going on in that office. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=742.605s">I</a>  hear it's really a disgrace to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=747.13s">When</a>  you go in, nobody has the correct information. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=750.233s">I</a>  had a complaint this week with regards to somebody who was just going down to get her parking permit pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=756.159s">She</a>  brought the proper documentation with her to get that pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=759.982s">They</a>  sent her out the door without the pass telling her she needed A, B, and C. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=765.139s">Finally,</a>  she went back with somebody that knew exactly what she needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=768.54s">She</a>  had brought the correct documentation the first time, and it was corrected the second time she went in. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=774.122s">But</a>  she should have been saved that second trip if people at Park Medford knew exactly the rules and regulations and what needs to be collected in order to get that parking permit pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=786.886s">I've</a>  also had several complaints with regards to people that are, one of the big ones that was upsetting was a woman <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=795.46s">taking</a>  her child out of the car, went and paid for parking to head into the Medford Public Library, and paid for parking, and then five minutes later, got a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=805.284s">Once</a>  you got that complaint, you realize that this is happening to several people. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=811.187s">They're</a>  paying for parking accordingly, and five, 10 minutes later, they're getting a ticket incorrectly. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=817.749s">Now,</a>  for that to happen maybe once or twice, it's one thing, but I've got about six complaints with regards to that in the last couple weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=825.056s">So</a>  something needs to be corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=827.496s">Something</a>  needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=829.457s">Another</a>  issue is with regards to when you do get a ticket and you pay that ticket, that should obviously be recorded in some sort of system that Park Medford has. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=839.719s">But</a>  people have been complaining that they've gone to the registry to try to renew their license. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=845.1s">And</a>  for some reason, it hasn't been recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=847.68s">And</a>  those tickets have been improperly sent to the registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=851.281s">And</a>  people have been turned away from the registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=854.408s">not</a>  being able to renew their license because it's showing that they had a ticket, although they have their receipts and they've paid for those tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=861.892s">So</a>  those are three, three or four different issues that I've got complaints of in the last four to six weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=868.256s">And</a>  I think I've, I have emailed the chief of police. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=870.737s">I</a>  know he's helped me with a couple things, but I've also requested, and hopefully I'll hear back from him soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=876.96s">I've</a>  asked that he specifically talk to Park Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=880.102s">I</a>  know he was almost the ambassador <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=882.622s">of</a>  what has been going on, and he's done a tremendous amount of work to try to get the—within the last two years to try to get it up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=891.15s">But</a>  there's just so many improper things that are going on, and people seem to—I don't know if they're not trained correctly or they're—some people even online are saying that they feel like these tickets are given out of spite at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=904.302s">They're</a>  joking with the people, saying, yeah, of course I'm going to give—you know, it's <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=908.2s">what</a>  I hear is going on is not right and we need to get a grasp on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=912.142s">The</a>  chief of police hopefully will reach out to Park Medford, but I think it's really important that also this city council sits down and ask the appropriate questions, make sure we let them know how unhappy we are and what our residents are going through. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=925.709s">I've</a>  got complaints from people outside of the city as well, which you know, can't be unnoticed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=930.912s">And</a>  I hope the administration, you know, is, is getting these complaints to, or, you know, reading up online when, <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=936.998s">things</a>  are posted because the administration needs to get a grasp on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=942.501s">Little</a>  tweaks were made, I believe, in January, but that's just not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=946.723s">What</a>  has been going on is people are not happy, and again, it's going downhill. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=952.206s">And</a>  I think we need to get a grasp on it, and this council needs to take the lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=955.708s">So</a>  I ask that, Council President, we try to get Park Medford down to a Committee of the Whole meeting so we can sit and roundtable it and discuss what's been going on and the complaints we've been hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=966.843s">and</a>  why they're not being corrected.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=968.424s">We've</a>  been asking since January for a meeting of last year.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=972.387s">So</a>  maybe now that you're in control, we can get that done.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=976.23s">Yes,</a>  I would say that we should have Dan Nash down here within the next two weeks.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=981.214s">I</a>  think a committee of the whole meeting, just so we have the full hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=984.056s">And</a>  I think he needs to come and talk to the people too, publicly, because people are not happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=991.642s">It's</a>  really a shame that after two, three years we can't get it <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=995.078s">we</a>  can't get under control and whether that's because it was bought and sold or what's, I don't know what's going on, but at least people in the office should be educated and people who are out there giving tickets should be taking the time to make sure they're certain this A, B, and C haven't paid for parking so that they can't, you know, cause then people have to number one, either pay the ticket, fight the ticket, get upset, go to Diane McLeod to appeal it, go to Park Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1022.296s">They</a>  have to take time out of their busy schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1025.005s">that</a>  they could be doing other things to try to fight these tickets, and it's not right.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1154.538s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1157.519s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1158.72s">Mr.</a>  President, this is purely a request to seek variance just based upon the size of the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1165.01s">Presently,</a>  the current sign ordinance would read that the square footage of the sign cannot exceed 12 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1171.114s">So</a>  that sign would be six by two. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1173.316s">The</a>  sign here is six by four. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1175.417s">And</a>  I think that this is a measure that I wholeheartedly support. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1179.26s">I</a>  think it will not have much of an impact on the quality of life in the neighborhood by passing traffic, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1185.931s">renderings.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1186.492s">The</a>  sign is about a six or so feet off of the sidewalk, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1191.396s">So</a>  it has a ample setback. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1193.218s">Um,</a>  really all it is is just so that the letters on the sign can be larger so people can have an easier time reading it, which I think will make it safer actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1199.104s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1199.484s">Move</a>  approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1201.166s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1202.327s">Mr.</a>  President, I concur with my colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1204.509s">I</a>  think this sign would make a wonderful addition, uh, aesthetically to the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1209.047s">We'll</a>  identify the domicile there, uh, in an area that, uh, suffers from a brisk rate of traffic with also abrupt stopping at the stoplights at Fulton street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1221.476s">And,</a>  uh, this will help people in search of the condo complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1226.219s">I</a>  second.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1227.139s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1227.74s">Do</a>  we have a motion by Councilor Marks, the science chairman?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1230.702s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1232.003s">Um,</a>  this is, um, a newly constructed, uh, entrance, uh, into the building itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1238.933s">And</a>  it was beautiful craftsmanship done constructing this new entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1244.975s">And</a>  I see no problem with this particular sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1247.736s">I</a>  think aesthetically it fits in to the property and the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1253.178s">And</a>  I would motion for approval, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1255.439s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1260.481s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1262.822s">All</a>  said, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1264.242s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1264.983s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1268.168s">We</a>  have one more, one thing I want to say, Mr. Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1272.81s">Be</a>  it resolved, offered by Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved that the council and the, Councilor Scott, I can't read your writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1288.318s">Be</a>  it offered by Councilor Scarpelli that we get an update on the focus group on recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qC9IjIrD-d0&t=1294.981s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>
