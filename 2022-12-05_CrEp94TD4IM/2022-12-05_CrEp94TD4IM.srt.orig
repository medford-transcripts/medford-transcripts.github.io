[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to welcome Marky here tonight.

00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:11,882

[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for being here.

14
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:01,242
[SPEAKER_15]: If we can all rise to salute the flag.

15
00:01:22,742 --> 00:01:24,126
[SPEAKER_11]: We have number three, good of the order.

16
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,894
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe we have that last meeting too.

17
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:28,659
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if anybody has anything they'd like to add.

18
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Hayes.

19
00:01:31,223 --> 00:01:32,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, I just had two very quick things.

20
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:37,766
[SPEAKER_03]: One, well, first I'd like to mention that it's great we've already got the microphone for our student representative.

21
00:01:38,226 --> 00:01:54,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I did want to check on the follow through with the idea of putting student participation on the agenda and just, I brought it up, but I don't think we talked about how that would, we'd follow through on that, whether that needs to go to maybe the rules subcommittee to talk about.

22
00:01:55,333 --> 00:02:00,175
[SPEAKER_09]: So motion to- Motion to move the student participation to the rules subcommittee.

23
00:02:00,795 --> 00:02:01,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

24
00:02:01,693 --> 00:02:03,957
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Hayes.

25
00:02:04,097 --> 00:02:04,898
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

26
00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:05,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

27
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,481
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

28
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

29
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:22,514
[SPEAKER_03]: One other quick thing, so we had a training meeting back in October, was it, about the superintendent evaluation, and I know we've talked a little bit about, there were some things that came up that we need to either update or refine.

30
00:02:23,535 --> 00:02:30,756
[SPEAKER_03]: If we could put, I think we were talking about maybe doing a committee of the whole for that, I just wanted to make sure, again, there's a lot going on that got followed through with.

31
00:02:31,316 --> 00:02:33,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but I think we decided at 5 p.m.

32
00:02:33,777 --> 00:02:37,898
[SPEAKER_11]: for a January meeting, so you just pick one and let us know, and we'll hold the date and time.

33
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:42,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Superintendent will get us a date and time, 5 p.m., one of the meetings in January.

34
00:02:48,837 --> 00:02:54,400
[SPEAKER_09]: And just a reminder that we have the meeting for the school committee goals, right?

35
00:02:55,181 --> 00:03:00,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, that could be next, at the December meeting, or was that the second one in January?

36
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:03,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, sounds great.

37
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:13,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we also have the consent agenda, number four, bills and payrolls, regular school committee meeting minutes, 22, November 21st.

38
00:03:13,913 --> 00:03:14,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a motion for approval?

39
00:03:15,534 --> 00:03:16,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to approve.

40
00:03:16,635 --> 00:03:18,175
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin, seconded by?

41
00:03:18,676 --> 00:03:19,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded.

42
00:03:19,316 --> 00:03:20,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Kretz, all those in favor?

43
00:03:20,897 --> 00:03:22,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

44
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:22,557
[SPEAKER_11]: Opposed?

45
00:03:22,957 --> 00:03:23,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

46
00:03:25,078 --> 00:03:28,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Number five, we have report of the superintendent, superintendent's updates and comments.

47
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent, superintendent.

48
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:39,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

49
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:43,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

50
00:03:49,922 --> 00:03:56,247
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope that everyone had a nice Thanksgiving break and that some of you were able to join us at Fenway Park.

51
00:03:57,248 --> 00:04:02,713
[SPEAKER_16]: Although the outcome wasn't what we would have wanted, the Mustangs gave it their all.

52
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:05,095
[SPEAKER_16]: And for that, we are very proud of them.

53
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:14,649
[SPEAKER_16]: I also want to say a special thanks to our Mustang students, families, and alumni who supported the event.

54
00:04:16,051 --> 00:04:16,732
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to thank

55
00:04:18,232 --> 00:04:32,761
[SPEAKER_16]: Our athletic team, Dr. Cushing, Principal DeLeva, Mr. Galluzzi, all the students who planned and participated in the entertaining pep rally that preceded the game as well.

56
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:38,124
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you to all of you, the band, and everyone did a fabulous job.

57
00:04:40,618 --> 00:04:57,051
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, I would like to take this opportunity to thank state representative Christine Barber and the rest of our state delegation for the inclusion of an act to ensure dependent health coverage for adults with disabilities in the legislature's mental health bill.

58
00:04:58,512 --> 00:05:07,199
[SPEAKER_16]: This act restores a provision that allows people with severe disabilities to remain on their parents' health plan without an age limit.

59
00:05:08,168 --> 00:05:17,516
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a critical issue for our Mustang families of children with disabilities, and we appreciate the hard work of Representative Barber.

60
00:05:19,438 --> 00:05:28,105
[SPEAKER_16]: I would also like to thank the following partners for supporting the Missittuck School for this holiday season.

61
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:48,098
[SPEAKER_16]: The Missittuck hosted a holiday giving program in collaboration with the Malden YMCA, Bank of America, the United Way, Kirkland and Ellis, and the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority, which provided gift cards and funds to the Missittuck community.

62
00:05:48,998 --> 00:05:57,404
[SPEAKER_16]: Due to everyone's generosity, a number of food bags and gift cards were able to be donated to families at the Missittuck School.

63
00:05:58,595 --> 00:06:05,552
[SPEAKER_16]: The Missittuck PTO is continuing to collect gift cards and donations until December 9th.

64
00:06:06,715 --> 00:06:07,698
[SPEAKER_16]: Great work, everyone.

65
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:18,769
[SPEAKER_16]: I also would like to recognize our Buddhist family and friends who are celebrating a significant holiday called Bodhi Holiday.

66
00:06:19,609 --> 00:06:26,651
[SPEAKER_16]: Bodhi Day is celebrated December 8th and notes the day that Lord Buddha's enlightenment occurred.

67
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:32,713
[SPEAKER_16]: The colors of Bodhi Day are often red, green, silver, and white.

68
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:39,275
[SPEAKER_16]: Buddhists decorate pine trees and come together to worship and to celebrate fellowship and joy.

69
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:49,154
[SPEAKER_16]: Since we have a Buddhist temple here in Medford, the Karukala Center, I take this opportunity to wish our Buddhist community a blessed Bodhi Day.

70
00:06:50,755 --> 00:06:54,476
[SPEAKER_16]: There are two historical days to keep in mind, dates.

71
00:06:55,877 --> 00:07:05,180
[SPEAKER_16]: December 7th is the 81st commemoration of National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, and December 15th

72
00:07:07,549 --> 00:07:15,935
[SPEAKER_16]: is the United States Bill of Rights Day, which was ratified on December 15th, 1791.

73
00:07:17,557 --> 00:07:27,564
[SPEAKER_16]: The Bill of Rights are the first 10 amendments to our Constitution, which protects some of the most indispensable rights and liberties that define us as Americans.

74
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:33,869
[SPEAKER_16]: There are several upcoming events happening in Medford between now and our next meeting.

75
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,791
[SPEAKER_16]: December 7th this week,

76
00:07:37,532 --> 00:07:43,016
[SPEAKER_16]: is both a booster and a flu clinic at the high school from three to 7 p.m.

77
00:07:45,558 --> 00:07:51,022
[SPEAKER_16]: On December 10th and 11th, our band parents continue to have the tree and reef sale.

78
00:07:52,223 --> 00:08:00,189
[SPEAKER_16]: Despite the rain, it's been very successful and I wanna thank the Medford community for supporting our band parents during this fundraiser.

79
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:03,892
[SPEAKER_16]: It takes place from 10 to five at the high school parking lot.

80
00:08:05,612 --> 00:08:11,435
[SPEAKER_16]: Medford Family Network is going to be hosting their annual book and toy swap.

81
00:08:12,335 --> 00:08:13,515
[SPEAKER_16]: That's December 11th.

82
00:08:13,695 --> 00:08:17,557
[SPEAKER_16]: It's by appointment only from one to five o'clock at the high school.

83
00:08:20,118 --> 00:08:31,103
[SPEAKER_16]: Also on December 11th, we have the Tufts men's basketball team hosting a free youth clinic for our students here in grades five through eight.

84
00:08:32,369 --> 00:08:37,530
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to take place at Tufts University in the Cousins Gym from 430 to 6.

85
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:49,553
[SPEAKER_16]: Tufts University is asking that you support them by bringing an item for their donation, their support of the Home for Little Wanderers.

86
00:08:50,153 --> 00:08:59,816
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you decide to participate in that, feel free to bring a new toy or a personal care item, and it will be donated to the Home for Little Wanderers.

87
00:09:01,027 --> 00:09:09,421
[SPEAKER_16]: On December 14th, we have a CPAC meeting, which is going to be about basic rights, evaluation, and eligibility.

88
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,324
[SPEAKER_16]: That's from 6 to 8 p.m.

89
00:09:11,364 --> 00:09:11,865
[SPEAKER_16]: by Zoom.

90
00:09:13,388 --> 00:09:18,411
[SPEAKER_16]: On December 14th and December 15th, we have our winter concerts.

91
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:27,695
[SPEAKER_16]: December 14th is our band, and that concert will be taking place in the Caron Theater at 7 p.m.

92
00:09:27,855 --> 00:09:29,356
[SPEAKER_16]: It's $5 per person.

93
00:09:29,976 --> 00:09:38,941
[SPEAKER_16]: And on December 15th, it will be our orchestra winter concert taking place also in the Caron Theater at 7 p.m.

94
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:40,181
[SPEAKER_16]: Tickets are $5 per person.

95
00:09:42,697 --> 00:09:48,639
[SPEAKER_16]: Lastly, before we meet again, December 18th marks the beginning of Hanukkah.

96
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:54,201
[SPEAKER_16]: Hanukkah begins at sundown and continues until December 26th.

97
00:09:55,082 --> 00:10:00,143
[SPEAKER_16]: It celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and the freedom to worship God.

98
00:10:00,604 --> 00:10:03,965
[SPEAKER_16]: Happy Hanukkah to our Jewish families and friends.

99
00:10:05,154 --> 00:10:13,396
[SPEAKER_16]: Later in the agenda, we will be having several presentations, and one of the key presentations today will be a labor update.

100
00:10:14,036 --> 00:10:15,396
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, and have a good evening.

101
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

102
00:10:19,997 --> 00:10:23,057
[SPEAKER_11]: We have number two, before and after school presentation by Ms.

103
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:29,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Megan Fidler-Carey, Director of Family and Community Engagement, who I'm assuming is on Zoom?

104
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:31,339
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

105
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:31,999
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

106
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:32,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Fidler-Carey.

107
00:10:40,862 --> 00:10:41,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

108
00:10:41,362 --> 00:10:43,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

109
00:10:43,244 --> 00:10:46,487
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, I had to get to my camera.

110
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:47,227
[SPEAKER_18]: How are you?

111
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:50,950
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you again.

112
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:54,113
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for the opportunity to present on afterschool.

113
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:57,856
[SPEAKER_18]: We wanted to answer some questions that came up earlier in the fall.

114
00:10:58,396 --> 00:11:00,878
[SPEAKER_18]: So this presentation is just quick.

115
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,159
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not comprehensive.

116
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:10,506
[SPEAKER_18]: As expected, we plan to present again in the spring when we have some better ideas about what the next year will look like.

117
00:11:11,482 --> 00:11:22,134
[SPEAKER_18]: But today we just wanted to answer some of those questions that have come up throughout the fall, just because we know that some people are still curious about it.

118
00:11:22,334 --> 00:11:27,240
[SPEAKER_18]: So these were specific questions that some families have asked us.

119
00:11:27,816 --> 00:11:34,219
[SPEAKER_18]: And so we just wanted to respond directly to those questions there about specific statistics about our programming.

120
00:11:34,619 --> 00:11:45,604
[SPEAKER_18]: We can't unfortunately answer questions about other programs in the city because they're their own entities, but we are happy to answer the questions about our school programs.

121
00:11:46,485 --> 00:11:53,128
[SPEAKER_18]: So one of the first questions that came up specifically was how many families are enrolled in afterschool

122
00:11:53,641 --> 00:11:56,403
[SPEAKER_18]: versus applicants to the lottery.

123
00:11:56,443 --> 00:11:57,905
[SPEAKER_18]: And this was from last spring.

124
00:11:58,645 --> 00:12:05,991
[SPEAKER_18]: So as you know, our programs are very full and we have wait lists at every program at the four elementary schools.

125
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:16,620
[SPEAKER_18]: And every spring we run a lottery to fill the open spots, the spots that become available as fifth graders graduate out or people move or drop out of the program.

126
00:12:17,031 --> 00:12:20,752
[SPEAKER_18]: So to answer these questions specifically, these are our current numbers.

127
00:12:21,873 --> 00:12:23,874
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, these were our current numbers last week.

128
00:12:24,174 --> 00:12:27,655
[SPEAKER_18]: And the problem with this sort of data is it's completely dynamic.

129
00:12:27,755 --> 00:12:28,856
[SPEAKER_18]: It's changing every day.

130
00:12:29,376 --> 00:12:35,558
[SPEAKER_18]: So some of these numbers are already obsolete, but this gives you a good sense of where we are.

131
00:12:36,118 --> 00:12:41,620
[SPEAKER_18]: So the total number of students enrolled is 330 across the district at the four schools.

132
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:42,741
[SPEAKER_18]: Again,

133
00:12:43,206 --> 00:12:50,812
[SPEAKER_18]: What we talked about last spring was the difference of thinking about this in terms of families who are enrolled in the program versus seats available.

134
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:55,956
[SPEAKER_18]: Because we do offer spots for two days a week, three days a week, or five days a week.

135
00:12:56,516 --> 00:13:06,724
[SPEAKER_18]: So it doesn't necessarily capture the data if we tell you how many families are enrolled in afterschool, because some of them might be two days, some might be three, some might be five.

136
00:13:07,404 --> 00:13:08,185
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have 330 students enrolled.

137
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,711
[SPEAKER_18]: but across the district, there are only 300 seats.

138
00:13:16,552 --> 00:13:21,913
[SPEAKER_18]: So last spring, this was a question that was specifically asked, how many applicants were there to the lottery?

139
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:22,293
[SPEAKER_18]: And there were 152.

140
00:13:22,673 --> 00:13:26,094
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the total that got spots was 47.

141
00:13:26,954 --> 00:13:30,395
[SPEAKER_18]: We only had 47 open seats that we could enter the lottery.

142
00:13:30,615 --> 00:13:32,076
[SPEAKER_18]: Since then, we've entered more.

143
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:39,598
[SPEAKER_18]: We've had more students come off of the wait list this year, but that's the direct answer to the lottery question.

144
00:13:41,108 --> 00:13:44,390
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the question was asked specifically about the waitlist.

145
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:48,953
[SPEAKER_18]: People would like more clarification about what the waitlist looks like.

146
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:52,495
[SPEAKER_18]: And so the question was asked, could we spread it out across grades?

147
00:13:52,635 --> 00:14:02,681
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'll let people who are interested in this take a moment to look at this table that shows you what the waitlist numbers look like at every grade level at every school.

148
00:14:04,591 --> 00:14:11,494
[SPEAKER_18]: You do notice that it, the numbers, if we could go back to that slide, you'll notice that the numbers drop off in the older grades.

149
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:13,655
[SPEAKER_18]: And we think that's for two different reasons.

150
00:14:14,075 --> 00:14:24,040
[SPEAKER_18]: First of all, maybe students got into the program who had been on the wait list, but second of all, you know, some students just become more independent and can take care and don't necessarily need afterschool care.

151
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,221
[SPEAKER_18]: And it definitely depends on, you know, what time.

152
00:14:27,796 --> 00:14:36,962
[SPEAKER_18]: families come home if they need, you know, the full three hours of afterschool care, or if they only needed a little bit, then, you know, fourth and fifth graders are more independent to be on their own.

153
00:14:38,402 --> 00:14:39,283
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, now we can go forward.

154
00:14:43,025 --> 00:14:54,112
[SPEAKER_18]: Another question that was asked based on what we presented in the spring, some of our solutions for increasing staff

155
00:14:55,484 --> 00:14:55,964
[SPEAKER_18]: Applicants.

156
00:14:56,084 --> 00:15:04,970
[SPEAKER_18]: So one of our problems for maintaining our maximum spots at each of the schools is that it's very difficult to hire for after school.

157
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,753
[SPEAKER_18]: So one of the solutions that we came up with that was, you know, has been suggested

158
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:13,854
[SPEAKER_18]: was to increase pay rates and someone asked if that had in fact been done.

159
00:15:13,994 --> 00:15:21,420
[SPEAKER_18]: So the answer is yes, we're glad to say yes, we increased pay rates pretty significantly for last year.

160
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:28,064
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we did a standard cost of living increase for this year and kept most of our staff.

161
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,967
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's been working and it's definitely a competitive rate.

162
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:36,731
[SPEAKER_18]: We noticed that we started a trend, other districts around us have been increasing their pay rates as well.

163
00:15:37,211 --> 00:15:37,851
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think,

164
00:15:38,982 --> 00:15:44,504
[SPEAKER_18]: As I say, every year and every time I'm in front of this body, this is a problem that's not unique to Medford.

165
00:15:44,884 --> 00:15:53,848
[SPEAKER_18]: There are wait lists at all sorts of afterschool programs, private and district run, and staffing is one of the biggest challenges we face.

166
00:15:54,628 --> 00:15:55,249
[SPEAKER_18]: So we can move on.

167
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:02,271
[SPEAKER_18]: Another solution that we've talked about is to think about tuition rates.

168
00:16:02,651 --> 00:16:06,293
[SPEAKER_18]: If staffing, to increase staffing pay,

169
00:16:06,823 --> 00:16:11,006
[SPEAKER_18]: we thought we'd need to increase tuition rates, which we did just a little bit.

170
00:16:11,527 --> 00:16:13,809
[SPEAKER_18]: As you know, we try and keep it as affordable as possible.

171
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:23,697
[SPEAKER_18]: Last spring, I also asked the school committee to honor the idea of doing away with the EEC vouchers.

172
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,880
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you'll recall, I know that that meeting is recorded somewhere.

173
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,884
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you wanted more information about that, I encourage you to go find that meeting, but we did that.

174
00:16:32,944 --> 00:16:36,407
[SPEAKER_18]: So starting at the beginning of this year, we no longer accept vouchers from EEC.

175
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:41,261
[SPEAKER_18]: Instead, we're doing a sliding scale financial assistance rate.

176
00:16:41,481 --> 00:16:49,244
[SPEAKER_18]: And the eligibility is based on the same eligibility criteria that the Community Development Block Grant uses for their funding.

177
00:16:49,924 --> 00:16:57,367
[SPEAKER_18]: So we've got currently, I think I have it on here, 21 families that are paying discounted tuition who filled out those forms.

178
00:16:57,807 --> 00:17:01,969
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're going to reach out to all families in the program again after the new year

179
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:16,023
[SPEAKER_18]: to to say if anything changes and you feel like you need to apply for this tuition discount now they can do that so the idea will be that at the beginning of the year, and then halfway through the year people can apply for financial assistance.

180
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:22,029
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll give people a minute to hold on let's give people a minute to look at this slide.

181
00:17:25,185 --> 00:17:27,946
[SPEAKER_18]: From last spring, we increased the pay rate just a little bit.

182
00:17:28,186 --> 00:17:34,327
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, the tuition rate just a little bit based on the trend.

183
00:17:34,648 --> 00:17:41,229
[SPEAKER_18]: We based it on what voucher was reimbursing, even though we weren't gonna be taking vouchers, that was our sort of benchmark that we used.

184
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,070
[SPEAKER_18]: So we increased just a bit.

185
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:52,913
[SPEAKER_18]: We're looking at that again, and there may be a chance that we'll have to increase some more for next year, but that's a report that we'll give you in the spring when we have a better sense of what our budget truly looks like.

186
00:17:53,813 --> 00:17:54,613
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, now we can go forward.

187
00:17:56,437 --> 00:18:01,061
[SPEAKER_18]: Speaking of budget, that was another question that came up transparency for what the budget looks like.

188
00:18:01,361 --> 00:18:09,527
[SPEAKER_18]: Now these numbers are, this is very dynamic and this may change as we're looking at it, especially noting that we're, we're trying

189
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,441
[SPEAKER_18]: to keep creative with staffing.

190
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:16,183
[SPEAKER_18]: We're looking at how, I told you that other districts have been raising their pay rates.

191
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,863
[SPEAKER_18]: So again, we wanna stay competitive.

192
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:23,065
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're looking at our own pay rates to think about what that might look like and what changes we might need to make.

193
00:18:23,446 --> 00:18:31,289
[SPEAKER_18]: So these budget estimates are very crude at this point, and we'll have a much better sense in the spring of what this will look like for you.

194
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:39,052
[SPEAKER_18]: But I wanted to make sure that all of the questions that were asked earlier this fall, both at school committee

195
00:18:40,003 --> 00:18:42,145
[SPEAKER_18]: meetings and in some emails that we've received.

196
00:18:42,225 --> 00:18:47,290
[SPEAKER_18]: I tried to answer every question that's come across our desk, and I hope I got to all of them.

197
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:53,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Ms.

198
00:18:53,756 --> 00:18:54,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Fiblikary.

199
00:18:54,377 --> 00:18:55,458
[SPEAKER_11]: Appreciate the update.

200
00:18:55,498 --> 00:18:57,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham, thank you for this.

201
00:18:58,181 --> 00:19:04,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you just tell us how many students are enrolled in each of the programs

202
00:19:05,205 --> 00:19:09,767
[SPEAKER_08]: today, like how many of the 330 enrolled are at each school?

203
00:19:09,927 --> 00:19:11,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know roughly?

204
00:19:11,888 --> 00:19:18,972
[SPEAKER_18]: So again, I hesitate to talk about students, but if we talk about seats, that's the one that I can say very definitively.

205
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:22,654
[SPEAKER_18]: So at the Brooks School, for example, we have 120 seats.

206
00:19:23,214 --> 00:19:29,497
[SPEAKER_18]: We've got a grade group for each grade, and that's 20 students per grade group.

207
00:19:30,258 --> 00:19:33,999
[SPEAKER_18]: And then at the other schools, we've got 60 seats, 60 seats, and 60 seats.

208
00:19:35,316 --> 00:19:37,937
[SPEAKER_18]: We've got three grade groups at each of the other schools.

209
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:48,582
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I am recalling the history of that, correct, it's actually fairly new that there are wait lists outside of the Brooks School.

210
00:19:48,662 --> 00:19:49,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that true?

211
00:19:51,143 --> 00:19:52,524
[SPEAKER_18]: At the length that they are, yes.

212
00:19:52,804 --> 00:19:56,586
[SPEAKER_18]: We've had sort of five and six students on a wait list.

213
00:19:57,506 --> 00:20:02,909
[SPEAKER_18]: And that might be because they had specific needs that we needed specific staffing for,

214
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:12,150
[SPEAKER_18]: You know it was it was one grade group that had just too many and so we had five on that grade group wait lists, but this year, yes, it has gotten a lot.

215
00:20:12,571 --> 00:20:14,574
[SPEAKER_18]: It's at every school that we've got wait lists.

216
00:20:18,374 --> 00:20:35,139
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you've also talked at times about particularly at the Brooks, there really not being a lot of opportunity to expand that program further because it poses some challenges and some safety issues and that kind of thing for that group to expand beyond its current number of seats.

217
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that still true at the Brooks?

218
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,600
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, definitely.

219
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:47,703
[SPEAKER_08]: And does that mean then that if we were able to find more staff that the other programs could expand?

220
00:20:48,726 --> 00:21:00,315
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, that's, yes, in fact, so if I were to hire more staff, and in fact, it feels so defeatist to say it, but we've had so few applicants.

221
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:02,737
[SPEAKER_18]: We're advertising everywhere.

222
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:08,121
[SPEAKER_18]: We've got it posted in all of the same places we always have before and beyond.

223
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:15,426
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm constantly asking other districts if they've figured out any secret new place to advertise or recruit from.

224
00:21:17,803 --> 00:21:23,989
[SPEAKER_18]: But if we did get new applicants, they would go to the Roberts first, which is where our next biggest wait list is.

225
00:21:24,469 --> 00:21:26,751
[SPEAKER_18]: And we would expand that program first.

226
00:21:28,753 --> 00:21:29,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thank you.

227
00:21:29,874 --> 00:21:30,054
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

228
00:21:32,076 --> 00:21:32,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin.

229
00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:36,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, thank you for the report.

230
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:46,442
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I'm understanding correctly, the 120 across the grades compared to the 60 at the other schools is just, it's a demand issue, right?

231
00:21:46,522 --> 00:21:47,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Like there's more demand at the Brooks.

232
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:52,444
[SPEAKER_18]: There was there in the past, there was more demand.

233
00:21:52,504 --> 00:21:58,025
[SPEAKER_18]: So we grew that program bigger, but now the demand is pretty high at the other schools as well.

234
00:21:58,265 --> 00:22:01,566
[SPEAKER_18]: Certainly the Roberts and Missituck are close behind.

235
00:22:02,568 --> 00:22:03,908
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're all at 60.

236
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:07,950
[SPEAKER_18]: They're at 60 because we hadn't grown them yet.

237
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:12,971
[SPEAKER_18]: So the Brooks, the demand has been that high for longer.

238
00:22:13,412 --> 00:22:15,272
[SPEAKER_18]: So we grew that program so big.

239
00:22:15,392 --> 00:22:22,294
[SPEAKER_18]: And so since the way that we do this as current students get their spot the next year, so it's stayed that big.

240
00:22:25,714 --> 00:22:26,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

241
00:22:26,535 --> 00:22:38,483
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you do the report for the spring, can I ask respectfully that you might include data specific to our English learner population and our student with disability population?

242
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:39,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Certainly, yes.

243
00:22:44,085 --> 00:22:45,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a question from the chair, Ms.

244
00:22:45,646 --> 00:22:54,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Igbukeri, do we, I know we did some outreach to try to gain new employees to apply for jobs.

245
00:22:55,728 --> 00:23:11,771
[SPEAKER_11]: How is our staffing looking and are we continuing to do that so that we could hopefully, even if it's after the new year or even gearing up for the next academic year, we can try to fulfill our goal of raising capacity at those three other elementary schools?

246
00:23:12,472 --> 00:23:14,434
[SPEAKER_18]: So all of the positions are still posted.

247
00:23:14,634 --> 00:23:21,259
[SPEAKER_18]: And like I said, I've had, I've had like two applicants and they were actually word of mouth applicants.

248
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:25,543
[SPEAKER_18]: They weren't from, it wasn't somebody looking for a job.

249
00:23:25,563 --> 00:23:29,486
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been, it's been really difficult.

250
00:23:29,626 --> 00:23:34,530
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know, I, I, I, we face, we face the same,

251
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,812
[SPEAKER_18]: problems that a lot of other industries face.

252
00:23:37,952 --> 00:23:54,264
[SPEAKER_18]: So on Indeed, we have it posted and we got a lot of applicants over the summer from Indeed and then they didn't show up for the interviews, which was very painful because I blocked a whole day for the leadership team from the afterschool program to participate in the interviews with me.

253
00:23:54,845 --> 00:23:57,066
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was really tough when people didn't show up.

254
00:23:58,167 --> 00:24:00,269
[SPEAKER_18]: But I mean, we definitely are still recruiting.

255
00:24:00,329 --> 00:24:03,051
[SPEAKER_18]: So yes, we're still hiring, but the hiring

256
00:24:03,826 --> 00:24:06,769
[SPEAKER_18]: hasn't been successful, I wouldn't say that it has.

257
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:18,319
[SPEAKER_18]: The few people that we've hired are either internal paras, which is wonderful, or a couple of people that learned about it from word of mouth that, you know, are friends of current staff.

258
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:27,348
[SPEAKER_18]: But unfortunately, none of them are five day a week kind of committed to this people, it's more, you know, kind of filling some holes.

259
00:24:29,226 --> 00:24:29,586
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

260
00:24:29,706 --> 00:24:34,911
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and I know just if I may, from the chair on the city side, I know you, Megan, you, Ms.

261
00:24:35,112 --> 00:24:40,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Fidelicari, you and I met with the West Medford Community Center leadership and Lisa was great.

262
00:24:40,537 --> 00:24:42,939
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that they were able to add a few spots.

263
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:50,827
[SPEAKER_11]: And I also just want to point out that our economic development director has been meeting with me and communicating with me and trying to

264
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,300
[SPEAKER_11]: reach out to companies.

265
00:24:53,201 --> 00:25:02,083
[SPEAKER_11]: I know there's two or three, including the YMCA, that are interested in expanding to Medford or the YMCA, expanding in general.

266
00:25:02,603 --> 00:25:03,643
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are working with them.

267
00:25:03,984 --> 00:25:09,005
[SPEAKER_11]: The issue we need to conquer is space, and then they'll have to deal with their staffing as well.

268
00:25:09,605 --> 00:25:16,607
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know our rec department is brainstorming ideas, so we are trying to cover every avenue to try to increase capacity here.

269
00:25:17,147 --> 00:25:19,148
[SPEAKER_11]: We know it's an issue in every city and town,

270
00:25:19,748 --> 00:25:22,750
[SPEAKER_11]: we want something we do want to try to solve here in Medford.

271
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,691
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

272
00:25:25,452 --> 00:25:27,674
[SPEAKER_15]: There are two people with hands up.

273
00:25:27,754 --> 00:25:29,115
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you want to take questions.

274
00:25:29,536 --> 00:25:32,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Emily, if you could state your name and address for the record, please.

275
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,321
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so this is this is Andre Quinn Emily's husband.

276
00:25:38,341 --> 00:25:46,682
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess I have a couple of questions, so we've been on the wait list for three years where I think you want to say this this where we are.

277
00:25:46,702 --> 00:25:49,003
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're at night on Johnson Ave in Medford.

278
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:53,704
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been on the wait list for three years and I guess my first question is.

279
00:25:55,324 --> 00:25:57,545
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you thought about the equity of the program?

280
00:25:57,665 --> 00:26:02,886
[SPEAKER_12]: So I know some families get access to the program and it's for all of the.

281
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:09,749
[SPEAKER_12]: the siblings and it's for the entirety of their enrollment at the school.

282
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:24,737
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess my question is, you know, as a parent that's never had access to the program, my question is, we asked the question three years ago about equity and we haven't seen any changes there.

283
00:26:24,757 --> 00:26:30,340
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the original answer was that there's, you know, guidance or

284
00:26:31,926 --> 00:26:38,649
[SPEAKER_12]: or evidence that suggests that that leads to the best outcomes for the students who are in the program.

285
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:51,534
[SPEAKER_12]: My question is, from an equity perspective, I struggled to see how that leads to the best outcomes for my son, never having access to the program over three years.

286
00:26:51,554 --> 00:26:53,215
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's my question.

287
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,771
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you're right.

288
00:27:01,851 --> 00:27:04,852
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't have a great answer for that.

289
00:27:06,472 --> 00:27:09,913
[SPEAKER_18]: It is considered best practice.

290
00:27:10,413 --> 00:27:13,214
[SPEAKER_18]: And when I say best practice, I guess I mean most common practice.

291
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:26,859
[SPEAKER_18]: I think what they mean when they say that is, you know, whatever, hopefully alternate program or babysitter or alternative you find.

292
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:30,160
[SPEAKER_18]: as long as that's consistent would be best for your child.

293
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,821
[SPEAKER_18]: I know it's a terrible, it's not a welcome answer, and I wish I had better information.

294
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:44,783
[SPEAKER_18]: I wish we could serve everybody who needs it, but yeah, I don't have a good answer for that equity question.

295
00:27:46,803 --> 00:27:50,484
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe we've had that conversation on the phone before, so I'm sorry.

296
00:27:50,504 --> 00:27:54,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin, and then we're gonna go to Teresa.

297
00:27:55,086 --> 00:28:07,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I guess what I'm hearing in terms of the equity and I'm not sure that there's a quick answer to this, but I think what I'm hearing is that part of the equity issue is the longstanding practice of

298
00:28:08,879 --> 00:28:10,400
[SPEAKER_09]: if you have the slot, you retain the slot.

299
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,423
[SPEAKER_09]: And then if you have siblings, then they get access to the slot.

300
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:29,534
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I guess it begs the question, and again, not one that I think could be answered tonight, but one that perhaps should be considered among the afterschool program and the district as a whole is, you know, is it wipe the slate clean and start with the lottery every year?

301
00:28:30,114 --> 00:28:33,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Or what's the more equitable solution?

302
00:28:33,677 --> 00:28:37,820
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know what that is, but I'm just putting that out there, because I think that's what I'm hearing

303
00:28:38,442 --> 00:28:39,622
[SPEAKER_09]: this particular individual?

304
00:28:41,143 --> 00:28:42,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address of the record.

305
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:48,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Member, John, can you just make sure the microphone's on, please?

306
00:28:50,487 --> 00:28:53,528
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just the person with the voice, if you wanna just touch the button.

307
00:28:53,988 --> 00:28:54,949
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, it's on, it's on, thank you.

308
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:56,269
[SPEAKER_07]: There, okay.

309
00:28:56,289 --> 00:28:57,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Shanine Peliquin, 108 Bella.

310
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Ms.

311
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:00,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Fidler-Carey.

312
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:04,513
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't met, but I did my grad internship at the National Institute on Out-of-School Time.

313
00:29:04,613 --> 00:29:06,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you been connected with their programs?

314
00:29:06,654 --> 00:29:06,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

315
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:17,407
[SPEAKER_07]: I would assume that Betsy Starr might be a person to ask some of these questions with, because she's the person that does their workforce development, and I don't know if that might be a resource.

316
00:29:17,627 --> 00:29:19,648
[SPEAKER_07]: I know they can help with quality improvement stuff.

317
00:29:19,689 --> 00:29:20,689
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm one of their observers.

318
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:31,398
[SPEAKER_07]: But they might have suggestions for people to talk to and what the actual best practices are and how districts are kind of creatively solving this problem.

319
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:37,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I mean, being able to use the paras and having it not be overtime, I don't know what that might even entail.

320
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:38,939
[SPEAKER_18]: We do that.

321
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:39,379
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep.

322
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:40,000
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we do that.

323
00:29:41,001 --> 00:29:42,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

324
00:29:43,203 --> 00:29:46,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Having been able to use the paras without it being overtime.

325
00:29:46,345 --> 00:29:48,127
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's budget prohibitive for all the programs.

326
00:29:48,167 --> 00:29:49,688
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know how that might work.

327
00:29:49,728 --> 00:29:51,010
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know other programs do it.

328
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:56,735
[SPEAKER_07]: They do it to leverage teacher salaries so that they can work in that summer camps over the summer.

329
00:29:56,755 --> 00:30:02,480
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's all sorts of different ways that programs are getting more stuff from the existing HR resources.

330
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,421
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, thank you.

331
00:30:04,922 --> 00:30:05,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

332
00:30:05,947 --> 00:30:06,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

333
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Teresa, name and address for the record, please.

334
00:30:12,092 --> 00:30:15,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, this is Teresa Fernald, 13 Whittier Road.

335
00:30:16,195 --> 00:30:22,039
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to double click on what Andre was saying and Melanie followed up with in that.

336
00:30:24,021 --> 00:30:27,163
[SPEAKER_00]: And before I ask my question, I thank you for today's presentation.

337
00:30:27,183 --> 00:30:30,866
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes and takes a step towards greater transparency.

338
00:30:30,886 --> 00:30:35,149
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a big theme here is transparency and making the information

339
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:38,327
[SPEAKER_00]: more accessible for parents.

340
00:30:39,528 --> 00:30:47,171
[SPEAKER_00]: It's challenging, as you know, for parents even to get on a school committee, even on Zoom, much less I wish I could attend in person.

341
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:51,393
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're all dealing with dinner and bath time and all that.

342
00:30:53,087 --> 00:31:02,189
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing very specifically on transparency is you've been mentioning for years about how Medford is similar.

343
00:31:02,809 --> 00:31:17,191
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet when a number of parents more than a year and a half, almost two years ago started a campaign to get more information, to advocate for more capacity, not just at the school, but within the city, we were asked to bring comps.

344
00:31:17,611 --> 00:31:20,692
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my question for you is, are you able,

345
00:31:22,176 --> 00:31:23,997
[SPEAKER_00]: What information are you able to share?

346
00:31:24,017 --> 00:31:31,899
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you share it in an accessible way, like a website, email blast through the school, the superintendent's messages to show us that data?

347
00:31:32,439 --> 00:31:37,100
[SPEAKER_00]: How is this Medford compared to our neighbors, to Winchester, to Arlington, to Malden, to Melrose?

348
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,742
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many where we don't see that it is the same problem from Medford.

349
00:31:42,822 --> 00:31:50,564
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're asking for that transparency on how you're comparing Medford and how you can say we have the same problems.

350
00:31:51,224 --> 00:31:51,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

351
00:31:54,953 --> 00:31:55,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Teresa.

352
00:31:58,015 --> 00:32:01,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Michelle?

353
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:04,478
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, thank you for this presentation.

354
00:32:04,498 --> 00:32:07,459
[SPEAKER_19]: My name is Michelle Barks and I live at 23 Diane Road in Medford.

355
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,640
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate everyone's time and energy with this.

356
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:13,502
[SPEAKER_19]: So I have a couple of questions here.

357
00:32:14,022 --> 00:32:22,386
[SPEAKER_19]: One with equity, I was wondering, something I've been thinking about with this is the idea of, so I know that

358
00:32:23,018 --> 00:32:28,779
[SPEAKER_19]: the days are offered two, three, four, five, or maybe not four, but at least there's some part-time offerings.

359
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:33,280
[SPEAKER_19]: Something about having all families have some access to the program.

360
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:41,402
[SPEAKER_19]: So two or three days versus all five, that way it puts people in a similar position of having some care.

361
00:32:41,422 --> 00:32:47,883
[SPEAKER_19]: So it feels more equitable in terms of some people having, everyone having some care instead of all people

362
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:53,287
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry, instead of some people having all care and some people having none for years and years and years.

363
00:32:54,108 --> 00:32:56,388
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm wondering if that's been thought of at all.

364
00:32:56,408 --> 00:33:05,031
[SPEAKER_19]: And anyway, and then the other thing around transparency, can our parents able to see what number they are on the waitlist, just to know.

365
00:33:06,393 --> 00:33:08,735
[SPEAKER_19]: the chances of getting into the program in the future.

366
00:33:08,935 --> 00:33:28,710
[SPEAKER_19]: And I also was wondering, I keep hearing that it's a lottery, which I know it is, but I'm wondering if the process for parents getting picked could be explained, like how then, is it just like a random website that kind of uses the, that pulls out the names, like how, I'm wondering if those transparency questions can be addressed.

367
00:33:30,131 --> 00:33:30,452
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

368
00:33:32,273 --> 00:33:34,255
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep, I can try and answer that just quickly.

369
00:33:35,469 --> 00:33:38,552
[SPEAKER_18]: I go over that every spring, how the lottery system works.

370
00:33:39,012 --> 00:33:42,916
[SPEAKER_18]: We do, we use a number generator called random.org.

371
00:33:43,436 --> 00:33:56,527
[SPEAKER_18]: So I have all families who are applying for the lottery sign up through a Google form and then put all of their names in the random, find out how many numbers there are and put it through random.org to regenerate the lottery numbers.

372
00:33:58,348 --> 00:34:03,773
[SPEAKER_18]: So I have at one point written that up and on one of the iterations of our website that is

373
00:34:04,665 --> 00:34:08,387
[SPEAKER_18]: spelled out, I can't guarantee that that made it to our new website.

374
00:34:08,868 --> 00:34:16,673
[SPEAKER_18]: I will double check, and I'm happy to put it on to the step-by-step of how our lottery system works and how, for transparency purposes, because I agree with you.

375
00:34:17,073 --> 00:34:26,739
[SPEAKER_18]: First of all, I think that the random.org website option is really, and encourage people to use it if it comes up in any way, and I'm happy to share how it's used.

376
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:34,044
[SPEAKER_18]: As far as sharing where students are on the wait list, again, that's a best practice shared across the state.

377
00:34:34,988 --> 00:34:44,473
[SPEAKER_18]: There are emergency situations that we have where we've sometimes got to let students in to jump a waitlist for safety reasons or for McKinney-Vento reasons.

378
00:34:44,513 --> 00:34:49,675
[SPEAKER_18]: McKinney-Vento is the Homeless Students Act, and there are rights to privacy.

379
00:34:50,322 --> 00:35:11,839
[SPEAKER_18]: where if I had told somebody that they were number one on the wait list and that they would be next, and somehow they found out that another student was let in before them, that would be revealing a lot of confidential information about that student that is not the business of the person who's number one on the wait list, who then would be pretty annoyed that they didn't get the next spot and they would know about it.

380
00:35:11,899 --> 00:35:14,501
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's the guidance.

381
00:35:15,014 --> 00:35:20,737
[SPEAKER_18]: from the state and from other districts about why revealing the number on the wait list.

382
00:35:20,797 --> 00:35:27,760
[SPEAKER_18]: So I try as much as I can to tell people whether they're in the top 10 or the top 20, and whether they should kind of hold out.

383
00:35:28,281 --> 00:35:32,703
[SPEAKER_18]: My best advice is always going to be that people should just make alternative arrangements.

384
00:35:32,783 --> 00:35:38,346
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're on the wait list, do your best to make alternative arrangements, assuming that the wait list isn't gonna move.

385
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:42,588
[SPEAKER_18]: I know there are other districts that either, number one, don't do wait lists at all,

386
00:35:43,243 --> 00:35:50,928
[SPEAKER_18]: number two cap their wait lists at 10 students knowing that the chances of anybody more than 10 probably isn't going to get in.

387
00:35:51,469 --> 00:36:04,517
[SPEAKER_18]: We haven't done that partially because I'm curious as everyone to know what the demand is for after school and also because you know my thinking is you just never know what's going to happen.

388
00:36:04,597 --> 00:36:05,458
[SPEAKER_18]: It's possible that

389
00:36:06,343 --> 00:36:07,825
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, all sorts of things could shift.

390
00:36:07,905 --> 00:36:14,452
[SPEAKER_18]: And so even though somebody is number 23 on the waitlist, if enough people move or come up with alternatives, they might still get in.

391
00:36:14,492 --> 00:36:17,455
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I find that information valuable.

392
00:36:17,515 --> 00:36:28,287
[SPEAKER_18]: So we haven't opted to move to the waitlist cap, but it's something that we might consider if other districts, say, are proving that it's successful.

393
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:33,180
[SPEAKER_18]: But that's my explanation for why we don't reveal people spots on the waitlist.

394
00:36:33,501 --> 00:36:35,621
[SPEAKER_18]: But as far as transparency, the lottery.

395
00:36:35,721 --> 00:36:39,743
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm happy to to make that as transparent as possible.

396
00:36:40,843 --> 00:36:42,704
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll make sure that the step by step is on the waitlist.

397
00:36:42,764 --> 00:36:45,365
[SPEAKER_18]: I can do that this week because I know that I've written it out before.

398
00:36:45,445 --> 00:36:46,245
[SPEAKER_18]: So if it's not on our

399
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:48,566
[SPEAKER_18]: new website, I'll make sure that it gets on there.

400
00:36:49,146 --> 00:36:58,109
[SPEAKER_18]: And look for me again in the spring, when I present to school committee and let them know when the lottery, the lottery will be sometime in early April.

401
00:36:58,629 --> 00:37:04,771
[SPEAKER_18]: And so when I say when that's coming, we'll be, we'll again be saying what the step by step process is for how the lottery works.

402
00:37:04,951 --> 00:37:05,912
[SPEAKER_18]: So please watch out for that.

403
00:37:07,632 --> 00:37:07,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

404
00:37:08,712 --> 00:37:09,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Next up is Vanessa.

405
00:37:11,044 --> 00:37:13,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, sorry, Member Russo and then Vanessa, you're next.

406
00:37:13,725 --> 00:37:14,105
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

407
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:17,866
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, the word equity is being mentioned an awful lot.

408
00:37:18,166 --> 00:37:25,849
[SPEAKER_15]: And while the definition is relatively simple, it's that people get what they need rather than people getting an equal amount of everything.

409
00:37:26,949 --> 00:37:30,571
[SPEAKER_15]: That definition is only valid when there's enough.

410
00:37:31,911 --> 00:37:40,054
[SPEAKER_15]: When there is not enough, it then becomes a policy decision about, well, when we have more demand,

411
00:37:41,121 --> 00:37:45,267
[SPEAKER_15]: How are we as a committee or as a district going to decide who gets it?

412
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:48,691
[SPEAKER_15]: When I looked at that chart, I was quite surprised.

413
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:55,480
[SPEAKER_15]: And frankly, if I was just a dictator, the books would be losing a lot of spots right now.

414
00:37:56,806 --> 00:38:02,409
[SPEAKER_15]: because it's not equitable right now that the Brooks has twice as many spots as the other elementary schools.

415
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:13,496
[SPEAKER_15]: And next year, unless we had some huge influx of 150 additional staff, I expect the Brooks to get not one more seat until the other schools are being matched.

416
00:38:14,256 --> 00:38:15,437
[SPEAKER_15]: That's equity, folks.

417
00:38:15,897 --> 00:38:17,558
[SPEAKER_15]: It does not mean you get what you want.

418
00:38:17,918 --> 00:38:18,698
[SPEAKER_15]: It means you get,

419
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:26,905
[SPEAKER_15]: Folks get what they need, and if there isn't enough, somebody other than the people who need it make the decision as to who gets it.

420
00:38:27,665 --> 00:38:33,590
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, I was shocked by these wait lists for the other elementary schools.

421
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:34,190
[SPEAKER_15]: Shocked.

422
00:38:34,631 --> 00:38:44,859
[SPEAKER_15]: Because, I mean, my memory of conversations around this stuff is, you know, there's a couple people at this school, a couple people on the wait list at this school, and often they can get off of those wait lists.

423
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:47,341
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's all fine.

424
00:38:49,122 --> 00:38:56,927
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, the Senator Jalen sent out a newsletter today about this crisis.

425
00:38:57,647 --> 00:39:06,713
[SPEAKER_15]: And I can't remember the number because I didn't have, I wasn't fast enough, but it was like 18% of child care centers closed during the pandemic that did not reopen.

426
00:39:08,265 --> 00:39:14,229
[SPEAKER_15]: So that there isn't enough isn't really new, but the pandemic has made it far worse.

427
00:39:14,689 --> 00:39:24,734
[SPEAKER_15]: And I also did note that she listed what childcare workers are getting paid on average in the state, and we are more than double it.

428
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:29,777
[SPEAKER_15]: So it isn't a throw money at it problem.

429
00:39:31,058 --> 00:39:33,159
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, at some point, I suppose we could throw

430
00:39:34,158 --> 00:39:38,740
[SPEAKER_15]: quadruple the pay we have right now, we'd find a lot of people who'd quit their jobs to come take those jobs.

431
00:39:40,801 --> 00:39:47,364
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think equity is not some solution when there's not enough of

432
00:39:48,126 --> 00:39:50,027
[SPEAKER_15]: the thing that we want to distribute.

433
00:39:50,407 --> 00:40:05,617
[SPEAKER_15]: And so, I'm not asking the administration right at this moment in time to talk about what next year's gonna look like, but I really hope that the distribution among the elementary schools looks a heck of a lot more equitable than it does now.

434
00:40:06,417 --> 00:40:06,758
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

435
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:08,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Member Russo.

436
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:10,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Vanessa, name and address for the record, please.

437
00:40:16,183 --> 00:40:17,124
[SPEAKER_11]: We are muting Vanessa.

438
00:40:19,321 --> 00:40:23,104
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, Vanessa Farsner, 17, Barbara Lane.

439
00:40:23,824 --> 00:40:29,188
[SPEAKER_13]: And first, I just want to say that thank you to everyone for having this as an agenda item again.

440
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:32,211
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it's been many years now that we've been talking about it.

441
00:40:33,692 --> 00:40:36,634
[SPEAKER_13]: But I did want to piggyback on what Michelle said.

442
00:40:36,794 --> 00:40:45,300
[SPEAKER_13]: I do think that just as Paul said, the equity amongst the schools, you only have so many seats, right?

443
00:40:46,181 --> 00:40:57,046
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, said there's only so many seats at a school, but you do have the availability to serve more families for those seats if different things were offered.

444
00:40:57,306 --> 00:41:15,715
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, my concern over redoing the lottery is that there are many families who could just end up by chance of not getting on the lottery again, where other families could just end up getting it again, as opposed to, I would just encourage the committee and the staff to think about

445
00:41:16,195 --> 00:41:30,120
[SPEAKER_13]: if there are things you can do with the days so that every child in Medford that wants the opportunity to have at least two days after care maybe has that opportunity.

446
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:41,204
[SPEAKER_13]: The second thing that I'll say that I've said many times before is that I really look to the mayor's office to support these outside organizations in finding space

447
00:41:41,684 --> 00:41:51,486
[SPEAKER_13]: or looking to our own Medford track or other organizations, we realized that there is a limit at the elementary schools, because of the space that is being used.

448
00:41:51,726 --> 00:42:01,569
[SPEAKER_13]: So we really need the city's help in solving this problem, because saying, you know, just find another option if you don't get a spot.

449
00:42:02,409 --> 00:42:13,251
[SPEAKER_13]: there is no other option right like people don't have an option in Medford and I think that's one of the things that really makes us such such a bigger problem here than maybe in other cities.

450
00:42:13,491 --> 00:42:13,951
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

451
00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:16,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Vanessa.

452
00:42:17,352 --> 00:42:19,352
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's member Graham.

453
00:42:20,612 --> 00:42:21,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

454
00:42:21,092 --> 00:42:28,794
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to mention as well that I at one point I had pulled some of our school committee colleagues across the state about this very issue.

455
00:42:28,814 --> 00:42:28,874
[SPEAKER_08]: And

456
00:42:32,475 --> 00:42:41,246
[SPEAKER_08]: universally everyone said we have the same problem and they also and some some folks went on to say

457
00:42:43,109 --> 00:42:47,013
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you mean your community thinks our community has solved this problem?

458
00:42:47,053 --> 00:42:47,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we have not.

459
00:42:48,994 --> 00:42:50,195
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have wait lists.

460
00:42:50,696 --> 00:42:56,181
[SPEAKER_08]: There are a lot of communities across the state who have just sort of gotten out of this business altogether because it's problematic.

461
00:42:56,341 --> 00:43:03,287
[SPEAKER_08]: And those folks said, even though we have done away with our programs, we still get constant complaints.

462
00:43:03,927 --> 00:43:07,752
[SPEAKER_08]: about the lack of afterschool care available in our community.

463
00:43:08,192 --> 00:43:13,237
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're not even in the business of doing this anymore because we have made those decisions.

464
00:43:13,778 --> 00:43:22,908
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not saying that to suggest that we should stop trying, but I am saying that to suggest that like, we are truly not unique.

465
00:43:23,468 --> 00:43:31,855
[SPEAKER_08]: in terms of the problem statement, which is that more people require care for their children after school than is available.

466
00:43:32,475 --> 00:43:43,904
[SPEAKER_08]: That problem statement is a problem statement that communities across the state and definitely in this area, Melrose, Somerville, Arlington, as far as I am aware, all of them have these same issues.

467
00:43:44,645 --> 00:43:48,568
[SPEAKER_08]: they look different, their programs look really different in some cases than ours.

468
00:43:48,588 --> 00:43:52,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I think Arlington is an example where their program looks really, really different than ours.

469
00:43:53,592 --> 00:43:56,735
[SPEAKER_08]: But it doesn't mean that they don't have the same problem that we do.

470
00:43:57,556 --> 00:44:00,899
[SPEAKER_08]: And I say that because I know that it is

471
00:44:01,815 --> 00:44:04,718
[SPEAKER_08]: super frustrating for me personally.

472
00:44:04,738 --> 00:44:07,660
[SPEAKER_08]: The program wasn't ever even an option for my family.

473
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:12,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we just, A, we didn't know about it, but B, even if we knew about it, it didn't meet our needs.

474
00:44:12,164 --> 00:44:26,156
[SPEAKER_08]: So as much as we talk about all the people who the program can serve, like we also are not serving a whole other population of members of our community who the program just doesn't work for them from a logistical perspective for other reasons.

475
00:44:26,216 --> 00:44:26,336
[SPEAKER_08]: So

476
00:44:26,892 --> 00:44:31,855
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it is a big and complex problem and I think that we are still trying to like work to solve it.

477
00:44:31,875 --> 00:44:47,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the work we've done with the power contract this year was aimed at creating another role that would help us feed this after school program, but these things are not, you know, they're not quick fixes, they do take time and we need to make sure that

478
00:44:48,647 --> 00:44:53,551
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, our ask of the administration is clear that the time be spent to try to cultivate additional staff.

479
00:44:54,812 --> 00:44:59,756
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, I truly don't want to be in a position where we have to

480
00:45:01,274 --> 00:45:03,215
[SPEAKER_08]: decrease capacity in a program.

481
00:45:03,255 --> 00:45:13,261
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the only way to not have that decision to make is to make sure that all the other programs can come up to some sort of reasonable equivalency.

482
00:45:13,321 --> 00:45:18,424
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that is a lot of work that probably needs to start, and I know that it is.

483
00:45:19,204 --> 00:45:23,666
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we need to figure out how do we create some more interest.

484
00:45:23,827 --> 00:45:32,571
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, Superintendent, if you can include our needs in your weekly memo for a couple of weeks to see if there's some additional interest out there.

485
00:45:34,605 --> 00:45:42,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think there's a lot of, you know, there's a lot of stones still to turn over, but I wanna make sure we're still doing that.

486
00:45:43,969 --> 00:45:50,952
[SPEAKER_08]: And as for the books, I know that is the biggest program and there really is no opportunity to expand it.

487
00:45:52,892 --> 00:45:57,034
[SPEAKER_08]: That is where another location, that is where another alternative comes into play.

488
00:45:57,134 --> 00:45:59,615
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we have to continue to try to be creative about that as well.

489
00:46:01,156 --> 00:46:01,876
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, member Graham.

490
00:46:03,196 --> 00:46:04,297
[SPEAKER_11]: We have Melanie.

491
00:46:04,961 --> 00:46:07,544
[SPEAKER_11]: North name and address for the record, please.

492
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:09,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we're gonna move on to McGlynn playground update.

493
00:46:12,048 --> 00:46:15,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Melanie North 45 cross street and Medford.

494
00:46:15,511 --> 00:46:17,072
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question about

495
00:46:18,197 --> 00:46:24,503
[SPEAKER_01]: the way the school handles each elementary school in terms of numbers.

496
00:46:25,064 --> 00:46:30,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Why does the Brooks have a larger program than per se the McGlynn or the Michitak?

497
00:46:32,571 --> 00:46:38,677
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that I've been on the wait list myself and I work in the district for over two years now.

498
00:46:39,178 --> 00:46:42,041
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little bit difficult for somebody like me

499
00:46:42,481 --> 00:46:47,583
[SPEAKER_01]: that I have to find outside care for my children, especially on those 130 days.

500
00:46:48,043 --> 00:46:51,785
[SPEAKER_01]: So why does other schools have more opportunities than the other?

501
00:46:53,565 --> 00:47:04,850
[SPEAKER_18]: So the Brooks program is so much bigger because several years ago, and when I say several, I mean probably five, five or six years ago, the demand was higher there.

502
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:09,371
[SPEAKER_18]: So we were meeting, we didn't have such big wait lists at every school.

503
00:47:11,206 --> 00:47:12,867
[SPEAKER_18]: The demand at the Brooks was the highest.

504
00:47:12,967 --> 00:47:14,869
[SPEAKER_18]: So that program grew the fastest.

505
00:47:15,429 --> 00:47:22,135
[SPEAKER_18]: I grew to meet the demand until we couldn't meet the demand at all the schools anymore.

506
00:47:22,395 --> 00:47:32,503
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's as big as it is because the demand was so high and the demand was not as high at the other schools and we could meet the needs at the other schools, but we kept growing the Brooks.

507
00:47:32,843 --> 00:47:39,689
[SPEAKER_18]: And then because of the way that we have our program that every current student is guaranteed their same spot for the next year.

508
00:47:40,396 --> 00:47:44,568
[SPEAKER_18]: It just stayed so big because they all just move up one, one year.

509
00:47:46,835 --> 00:47:47,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham.

510
00:47:49,457 --> 00:47:49,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

511
00:47:49,637 --> 00:47:57,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Fidler-Carey, I think the other thing that's relevant when you talk about the differences in the programs is that there's a real enrollment difference between our elementary schools.

512
00:47:57,945 --> 00:48:04,171
[SPEAKER_08]: So I believe the Brooks has 150 more students every day than Mnistutak does.

513
00:48:04,251 --> 00:48:07,274
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is not, like, I think it is a very complicated picture.

514
00:48:07,374 --> 00:48:13,540
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to look at all of those variables, but our enrollment is not the same in all of our schools either.

515
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:13,600
[SPEAKER_08]: So

516
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:21,885
[SPEAKER_08]: when you start talking about what percentage of students you're serving, I think that's just another dimension that makes this really complicated.

517
00:48:24,707 --> 00:48:25,027
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

518
00:48:26,868 --> 00:48:27,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ms.

519
00:48:27,288 --> 00:48:29,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Fibbocari, and for all that participated.

520
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:39,755
[SPEAKER_11]: We have number three, McGlynn Playground Update, Dr. Peter Cushing, Assistant Superintendent of Enrichment and Innovation, and Shanine Peliquin, the Playful Pelican LLC.

521
00:48:40,115 --> 00:48:40,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for being here.

522
00:48:41,736 --> 00:48:42,757
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll turn it over to you both.

523
00:48:45,202 --> 00:48:47,024
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening, Madam Mayor and members of the School Committee.

524
00:48:47,104 --> 00:48:53,009
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much for this opportunity to present the work that the McGlynn Inclusive Playground Committee has done.

525
00:48:53,289 --> 00:49:00,936
[SPEAKER_17]: Two members, Member Graham and Member McLaughlin, are also here with us today, and we have a number of parents

526
00:49:01,556 --> 00:49:08,321
[SPEAKER_17]: community members, teachers serving on this committee that has really made it a very inclusive process.

527
00:49:08,721 --> 00:49:14,686
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're excited to present our almost final design schematics.

528
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:19,710
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm here with the co-chair of that, Shanine Peliquin, who's been extraordinarily helpful in this process.

529
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,704
[SPEAKER_17]: So wanna quickly just review the existing site.

530
00:49:24,764 --> 00:49:26,425
[SPEAKER_17]: And by quickly, I mean very quickly.

531
00:49:27,126 --> 00:49:29,168
[SPEAKER_17]: It's approximately 25,000 square feet.

532
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:36,455
[SPEAKER_17]: Just so you know, around those existing playground structures and concrete, there should only be six feet of poured-in-place.

533
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:46,424
[SPEAKER_17]: When this site was built, there was an excessive use of poured-in-place used well in advance of anything that's actually needed for the safety of our students.

534
00:49:47,565 --> 00:49:55,011
[SPEAKER_17]: And after playground inspections have been completed, we have confirmed that this playground is at the end of its useful life.

535
00:49:55,351 --> 00:50:08,802
[SPEAKER_17]: And while it looks fun from afar, as our playground inspector stated, it actually adds very little play value for any students, not only those students who are otherwise abled.

536
00:50:09,282 --> 00:50:10,603
[SPEAKER_17]: I see member McLaughlin.

537
00:50:10,623 --> 00:50:15,007
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to ask if you can, can you, for folks that are listening that might not know, put in place

538
00:50:15,327 --> 00:50:31,130
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep, so poured in place is the rubber surface, that is this, the blue that is meant to mimic the Mystic River, the green, and then this other shade of green, which is the water damaged that you can see from the satellite imagery, that is the water damage poured in place.

539
00:50:32,271 --> 00:50:36,412
[SPEAKER_17]: All the head drop testing proves that we're fine on this, but I just wanted to give a quick update on that.

540
00:50:36,532 --> 00:50:38,172
[SPEAKER_17]: We are also extraordinarily grateful

541
00:50:38,852 --> 00:50:50,556
[SPEAKER_17]: to the Medford DPW for this past summer restoring the drainage and that has been very helpful to make sure that the site is largely clear of water throughout this year.

542
00:50:50,676 --> 00:50:51,936
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was a temporary fix?

543
00:50:52,196 --> 00:50:53,677
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, that is temporary.

544
00:50:55,019 --> 00:51:02,405
[SPEAKER_17]: So our project goals are first, we want to create something that's fun, safe, accessible, and reflects the identity of the students.

545
00:51:02,465 --> 00:51:07,990
[SPEAKER_17]: To that end, there's been considerable work to interview and speak to students throughout.

546
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:10,872
[SPEAKER_17]: And so that, their voice has really come through.

547
00:51:11,393 --> 00:51:14,716
[SPEAKER_17]: The staff want to make sure that it's first for the McGlynn students,

548
00:51:16,177 --> 00:51:31,090
[SPEAKER_17]: if a construction, if a phase construction is needed, but this is a central playground for a large number of Medford's populations that live close by in the towers and other housing developments and in other residential properties.

549
00:51:31,551 --> 00:51:34,454
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is a destination playground throughout the summer.

550
00:51:34,494 --> 00:51:36,636
[SPEAKER_17]: You can see people playing on it all the time.

551
00:51:38,336 --> 00:51:40,177
[SPEAKER_17]: offers a wide range of challenges.

552
00:51:40,437 --> 00:51:47,360
[SPEAKER_17]: So one of the challenges you have when building an inclusive playground is to make sure that it's challenging for everybody and that it offers fun play for everybody.

553
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:54,823
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think the committee has done a really good job addressing these concerns, considers the wider benefit to the broader Medford community.

554
00:51:55,363 --> 00:51:58,985
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not going to be able to build this without complete support from all of Medford.

555
00:51:59,545 --> 00:52:02,466
[SPEAKER_17]: And so that's something that we'll discuss later in the presentation.

556
00:52:03,027 --> 00:52:06,248
[SPEAKER_17]: And then another final thing is maintenance, right?

557
00:52:06,688 --> 00:52:12,415
[SPEAKER_17]: It is fundamentally critical throughout the life of these playgrounds, which is about 25 years, all right?

558
00:52:12,455 --> 00:52:12,995
[SPEAKER_07]: On the high end.

559
00:52:13,216 --> 00:52:13,756
[SPEAKER_17]: On the high end.

560
00:52:15,478 --> 00:52:24,368
[SPEAKER_17]: For us to maintain, for us to be doing annual inspections, semi-annual inspections, to really be looking at our play structures and making sure that they're well maintained.

561
00:52:25,236 --> 00:52:27,517
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, so community outreach, what have we done?

562
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:49,468
[SPEAKER_17]: We've done a number of onsite events, tabling, meeting parents as they come on the Wednesday early dismissals, staff survey that had well over 50% of the staff responding, staff interviews, survey that was sent to all elementary families to get a broader sense as we see this project as being the first of the replacements that need to be done.

563
00:52:50,149 --> 00:52:50,669
[SPEAKER_17]: As we said,

564
00:52:51,509 --> 00:52:52,690
[SPEAKER_17]: 25 years on the high end.

565
00:52:53,150 --> 00:53:01,997
[SPEAKER_17]: You all know when the new elementary schools were built and where we are in the current Julian calendar.

566
00:53:02,237 --> 00:53:03,998
[SPEAKER_17]: Survey said that already.

567
00:53:04,138 --> 00:53:06,980
[SPEAKER_17]: Playground observations that have been conducted.

568
00:53:08,261 --> 00:53:18,088
[SPEAKER_17]: Shanine did a number of those, myself and assistant superintendent Kalusi also did some at the McGlynn playground to see how students utilize the play and how staff

569
00:53:18,459 --> 00:53:21,500
[SPEAKER_17]: does a great job observing that plane, keeping our students safe.

570
00:53:22,121 --> 00:53:31,545
[SPEAKER_17]: And then finally, we redoubled our efforts to make sure that CPAC was involved and made sure that they helped us to get the word out as well.

571
00:53:31,885 --> 00:53:36,348
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we're extraordinarily grateful to CPAC for their support in this process.

572
00:53:37,888 --> 00:53:42,851
[SPEAKER_17]: So we had a number of designs submitted.

573
00:53:43,331 --> 00:53:45,012
[SPEAKER_17]: And so there were three.

574
00:53:45,984 --> 00:53:53,068
[SPEAKER_17]: that came through, and this one that I'll then turn over to Shanine is the one that the committee really selected.

575
00:53:53,408 --> 00:53:55,509
[SPEAKER_17]: So Shanine.

576
00:53:55,529 --> 00:54:09,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, for any of you who don't know me, my background, I'm a recreation therapist and a developmental specialist, and I've really taken, I've been working with the city since 2006, increasing access to recreation services for youth and adults with disabilities.

577
00:54:10,076 --> 00:54:12,078
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in the last bit, it's just been kids.

578
00:54:13,467 --> 00:54:14,808
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're taking that away.

579
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:31,446
[SPEAKER_07]: So this design really addresses what we heard most, which was that we needed to separate the preschool play area, because while DESE doesn't have any requirements about separating playgrounds that are designed for two to five year olds,

580
00:54:32,166 --> 00:54:38,351
[SPEAKER_07]: from sites for five to 12-year-olds, EEC does, and the industry standards are to separate that.

581
00:54:38,811 --> 00:54:47,698
[SPEAKER_07]: You end up with, and what's happening on the current playground is that preschoolers are falling through the slides, and their ladder steps are too big for them, because there's three, right?

582
00:54:47,758 --> 00:54:50,160
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're- Excuse me, Shanine, sorry, point of information.

583
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:57,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I just ask, when we use acronyms, if we can just say that, yes, so DESE, EEC, and EI, no- EEC.

584
00:55:00,748 --> 00:55:01,829
[SPEAKER_07]: I just said industry standard.

585
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:14,198
[SPEAKER_07]: So the Department of Early, sorry, the Department of Education, Elementary and Secondary Education does not have guidelines that should that say that you have to separate those.

586
00:55:14,538 --> 00:55:20,102
[SPEAKER_07]: The Early Education and Care Department that licenses other programs does require that.

587
00:55:20,122 --> 00:55:23,365
[SPEAKER_07]: So like I work with a preschool and we are not allowed to have our students

588
00:55:24,105 --> 00:55:29,167
[SPEAKER_07]: who are under the like any of them on the 5 to 12 structures at all for licensing.

589
00:55:31,147 --> 00:55:44,331
[SPEAKER_07]: So it also adds a field because right now on the concrete space that's between the two structures, we have kids who are playing soccer and football and big tag games, but you actually have to go through the soccer

590
00:55:44,751 --> 00:55:53,702
[SPEAKER_07]: game to get to the rest of the playground and there's a lot of balls going in places and a lot of concern of just kids running into each other.

591
00:55:54,082 --> 00:56:00,850
[SPEAKER_07]: So this separates the field area and keeps it within the structure of the playground.

592
00:56:02,895 --> 00:56:15,126
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also more concrete area, which is a cost savings, as well as shovelable and plowable area so that this really can be a four season playground.

593
00:56:15,586 --> 00:56:22,832
[SPEAKER_07]: What's happening right now is that because of the flooding, but also because the port in place rubber can't be plowed.

594
00:56:23,633 --> 00:56:29,759
[SPEAKER_07]: kids are having more indoor recess than the other schools because there is no concrete place for them to play.

595
00:56:30,139 --> 00:56:34,504
[SPEAKER_07]: So this allows that more inclement weather recess play.

596
00:56:36,683 --> 00:56:45,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Just for those of you who aren't familiar, prairie in place rubber or any playground surfacing, whether it's mulch or sand or anything, is not designed to prevent injury.

597
00:56:45,445 --> 00:56:48,266
[SPEAKER_07]: It is designed to prevent critical head injury and death.

598
00:56:48,886 --> 00:56:59,408
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's only supposed to be within a six foot radius around any structure so that if a kid falls, they're going to be generally okay, but they might break their arm and they might break their leg.

599
00:56:59,448 --> 00:57:00,849
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not how it's designed.

600
00:57:02,409 --> 00:57:03,550
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's very expensive.

601
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:05,491
[SPEAKER_07]: It's $20 to $30 per square foot.

602
00:57:05,951 --> 00:57:10,574
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're really trying to make sure that we are thoughtful about how things are arranged.

603
00:57:10,714 --> 00:57:17,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Each piece of equipment has to have a six foot barrier around it and some of those can overlap and some of them can't depending on the pieces of equipment.

604
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:20,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.

605
00:57:20,501 --> 00:57:21,641
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'll see you've got

606
00:57:23,271 --> 00:57:26,652
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a doggle ball pit, a basketball court, which the kids asked for.

607
00:57:26,692 --> 00:57:31,493
[SPEAKER_07]: The older kids wanted two heights of hoops because they wanted the little kids to be able to play too.

608
00:57:32,413 --> 00:57:36,074
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a four square court that preserves the tree in the middle.

609
00:57:36,114 --> 00:57:39,975
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're familiar with the playground, there's this really giant, beautiful tree that the children love.

610
00:57:40,616 --> 00:57:45,977
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've said this at many meetings, but the kids told us that if we did anything to that tree, they would cry for the rest of their lives.

611
00:57:47,792 --> 00:57:54,896
[SPEAKER_07]: So this actually puts a really thoughtful deck area around that tree with two ramps that go up to it and seating.

612
00:57:55,656 --> 00:58:03,280
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there will be more tree area that's accessible as well to the students for quiet retreat places and hangout spots and fully accessible.

613
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:14,286
[SPEAKER_07]: There are two areas of elevation that we'll show you in other images, but the gray circle to the gray oval to the left is actually

614
00:58:15,851 --> 00:58:21,814
[SPEAKER_07]: a covered hangout and picnic area with big steps that lead down to the field.

615
00:58:21,894 --> 00:58:23,195
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a good hangout space.

616
00:58:23,255 --> 00:58:27,076
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good gathering space for classes if they want to go out and use it there.

617
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:33,840
[SPEAKER_07]: And the whole slope, you'll see the gray path around the outside is a circulation path.

618
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:38,642
[SPEAKER_07]: that maintains ADA slope throughout without having to add a ramp.

619
00:58:39,262 --> 00:58:49,468
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a gentle slope all the way around and again, adds more concrete as opposed to put in place as a cost saving, but also allows for a lot of interesting play.

620
00:58:49,908 --> 00:59:01,914
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll be adding sensory pathways and, you know, hopping spots and hopscotch, et cetera, to that as informed by the therapy staff at the school.

621
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:05,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and then we just go back really quickly.

622
00:59:06,412 --> 00:59:09,253
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll see adjacent to the school, there's actually an outdoor classroom.

623
00:59:10,033 --> 00:59:28,139
[SPEAKER_07]: So the only thing that's, they're up against a first grade classroom, so it will be a quieter space, but this is a request from the staff to have places to go when they have guest speakers to do science curriculum activities, to do gardening, et cetera, and it will be an accessible space as well.

624
00:59:28,834 --> 00:59:32,399
[SPEAKER_17]: The other thing too is that this oval at the end of the field can also double as a stage.

625
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:41,191
[SPEAKER_17]: So you get out multiple classes out for a presentation, speakers, something along those lines to have students outside and in their environment.

626
00:59:41,707 --> 00:59:53,617
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the two to five area is accessible via the gate that they're currently using, which is closest to the kindergarten and preschool doors and provides age appropriate and developmentally appropriate equipment.

627
00:59:54,458 --> 00:59:58,841
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a hill that kind of meets between the two structures.

628
00:59:59,402 --> 01:00:00,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you go across that path?

629
01:00:00,402 --> 01:00:00,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

630
01:00:01,383 --> 01:00:10,611
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a gate so that during the school day that can be closed to keep the two age ranges separate, but then on the weekends it can be opened so that parents can supervise kids on both sites.

631
01:00:11,954 --> 01:00:23,306
[SPEAKER_17]: The other thing too about this is you'll notice down here on the path, we are gating off access to the pathway closest to the building while still preserving a fire lane if we need to get apparatus back there.

632
01:00:23,767 --> 01:00:30,895
[SPEAKER_17]: But one of the major goals was to divert any pedestrian traffic away from the rear of the building for obvious safety concerns.

633
01:00:32,967 --> 01:00:45,756
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a perspective image from the corner of the, so I guess the lower right of that image we were just looking at, looking into the two to five structure or the two to five area.

634
01:00:45,796 --> 01:00:47,758
[SPEAKER_07]: So there will be an inclusive playhouse.

635
01:00:47,838 --> 01:00:55,343
[SPEAKER_07]: We decided with it, with the preschool staff decided that that would be a better option with more play value than a structure because the,

636
01:00:55,803 --> 01:00:58,165
[SPEAKER_07]: small two to five structures tend to be pretty boring.

637
01:00:58,325 --> 01:01:00,167
[SPEAKER_07]: They go up across and down and that's about it.

638
01:01:01,388 --> 01:01:07,172
[SPEAKER_07]: So there will be some sort of teeter-totter seesaw bit with trunk support.

639
01:01:07,252 --> 01:01:13,737
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a basket swing because little kids can transfer easier if they use adaptive mobility equipment.

640
01:01:14,498 --> 01:01:18,161
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a hill slide and a sand area.

641
01:01:18,481 --> 01:01:23,645
[SPEAKER_07]: And also we just added this area where they can go and kind of be in the trees over on the left.

642
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:30,124
[SPEAKER_07]: as well as, I think, musical equipment and some tree stumps for hopping.

643
01:01:30,224 --> 01:01:30,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

644
01:01:30,784 --> 01:01:33,946
[SPEAKER_07]: And then along, you'll see that gray path that's on the right.

645
01:01:34,907 --> 01:01:41,892
[SPEAKER_07]: It leads up and around to the top of the hill at that gentle slope, and we'll be able to put more of those hopping spots and balance lines, et cetera, there.

646
01:01:42,012 --> 01:01:44,213
[SPEAKER_07]: So adding play value in little areas.

647
01:01:44,954 --> 01:01:45,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Russo?

648
01:01:46,855 --> 01:01:47,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

649
01:01:47,456 --> 01:01:47,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Russo?

650
01:01:48,276 --> 01:01:48,596
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

651
01:01:51,362 --> 01:01:52,383
[SPEAKER_15]: around the sensory stuff.

652
01:01:52,403 --> 01:01:54,725
[SPEAKER_15]: Was there any conversation around the water feature?

653
01:01:58,208 --> 01:02:02,031
[SPEAKER_17]: So we had extensive conversations about various water features.

654
01:02:03,572 --> 01:02:16,962
[SPEAKER_17]: And the reality is, is that that poses an extraordinary challenge during the school day, but then, you know, maintaining clean water in those is also another significant challenge.

655
01:02:17,577 --> 01:02:24,083
[SPEAKER_17]: that for the scope of this current project, it just didn't fit within what we were looking for.

656
01:02:24,904 --> 01:02:35,973
[SPEAKER_07]: The sand table will be able to have water access, I believe, but that sand table is actually going to be lockable is the plan so that it is usable only by the school during school hours.

657
01:02:36,013 --> 01:02:44,461
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the teachers can have water and sand access for the preschool, but that that wouldn't become an accessible piece during the school day or during community hours.

658
01:02:45,232 --> 01:02:47,533
[SPEAKER_15]: So what you mean is it won't be a kitty litter box.

659
01:02:48,493 --> 01:02:56,215
[SPEAKER_07]: So actually, what's interesting is litter ones become kitty litter boxes, but this is like there are lockable ones where you can close the top.

660
01:02:57,176 --> 01:03:03,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Big sand areas don't actually become kitty litter boxes because I mean, if so, we'd have to be covering Wright's Pond, right?

661
01:03:03,558 --> 01:03:04,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, but we don't.

662
01:03:05,678 --> 01:03:09,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's one of those concerns that people think about, but it's not actually panning out.

663
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:10,240
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

664
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,421
[SPEAKER_07]: So then this is from

665
01:03:15,005 --> 01:03:22,310
[SPEAKER_07]: A little left of the entrance to the 5 to 12 playground looking toward the road.

666
01:03:23,091 --> 01:03:23,932
[SPEAKER_07]: You see the structure.

667
01:03:23,952 --> 01:03:27,094
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not this particular image is kind of quirky.

668
01:03:27,134 --> 01:03:29,916
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the structure we're currently looking at those slides.

669
01:03:30,236 --> 01:03:32,478
[SPEAKER_07]: The kids said very specifically they do not want.

670
01:03:33,018 --> 01:03:34,039
[SPEAKER_07]: twisty slides like this.

671
01:03:34,179 --> 01:03:39,202
[SPEAKER_07]: A spiral slide is one thing, but they don't like the ones that go out like this because they're too slow.

672
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:43,204
[SPEAKER_07]: And because once you hit about fourth grade, your legs are too long for the slide.

673
01:03:43,244 --> 01:03:51,089
[SPEAKER_07]: And we want to make sure, because that was the number one complaint, even some of the third graders were saying they had outgrown the play equipment that was currently there.

674
01:03:51,984 --> 01:03:55,606
[SPEAKER_07]: So we want to make sure that we maintain challenge for our older students.

675
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:56,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

676
01:03:56,286 --> 01:03:59,487
[SPEAKER_17]: Students want to go as fast as possible.

677
01:03:59,607 --> 01:04:01,388
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the same as the double side that they have now.

678
01:04:01,728 --> 01:04:02,268
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Russo.

679
01:04:02,548 --> 01:04:03,208
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

680
01:04:03,749 --> 01:04:07,350
[SPEAKER_15]: In all of these images, the trees are mature.

681
01:04:10,671 --> 01:04:17,534
[SPEAKER_15]: You might get to this later on, but are we looking at like a 10 or 20 year progression or are we going to have little tiny

682
01:04:18,405 --> 01:04:24,696
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, twigs that you can get at Home Depot for 50 bucks for the next generation or two.

683
01:04:24,716 --> 01:04:29,565
[SPEAKER_07]: The trees that will be on the playground, like the one that's kind of in the center here,

684
01:04:32,053 --> 01:04:35,714
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's on the playground and accessible by the kids, it will be a four to five inch caliber tree.

685
01:04:35,854 --> 01:04:36,814
[SPEAKER_07]: So a more mature tree.

686
01:04:37,514 --> 01:04:41,155
[SPEAKER_07]: If they are behind a fence, they will be younger trees, but like a two to three inch.

687
01:04:41,455 --> 01:04:45,276
[SPEAKER_07]: So they will take a little longer, but then we will have more of that shade.

688
01:04:45,876 --> 01:04:52,077
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reality is we're going to have to wait a little bit to get the shade that we want, but this will be a more sustainable way to get it.

689
01:04:52,457 --> 01:04:55,418
[SPEAKER_17]: Smaller trees also offer a bit of cost savings measure.

690
01:04:56,365 --> 01:05:02,424
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, we're thinking of other ways that we can bring greenery into this because one of the things with a turf field.

691
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:04,971
[SPEAKER_17]: It's an unfortunate reality.

692
01:05:05,271 --> 01:05:09,233
[SPEAKER_17]: There is no way to have a grass field.

693
01:05:09,793 --> 01:05:16,396
[SPEAKER_17]: You'd need to seed it for a minimum of two years and let it just lay fallow to grow and establish an appropriate root system.

694
01:05:16,836 --> 01:05:20,317
[SPEAKER_17]: And the reality is, is that grass fields are destroyed quickly.

695
01:05:20,578 --> 01:05:30,182
[SPEAKER_17]: So I guess a necessary issue is to have a artificial turf field, but it provides the play value that we need

696
01:05:31,144 --> 01:05:32,305
[SPEAKER_07]: but unfortunately it's artificial.

697
01:05:32,525 --> 01:05:37,909
[SPEAKER_07]: And as evidenced by the Brooks and how many times they tried to plant it with grass before they finally said, fine.

698
01:05:38,049 --> 01:05:38,209
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

699
01:05:38,249 --> 01:05:47,997
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I just, aside from the appearance and the shade, you know, unless you place a guard there, kids are going to be trying to climb the trees no matter how small they are.

700
01:05:48,017 --> 01:05:48,938
[SPEAKER_01]: They will be trimmed.

701
01:05:48,958 --> 01:05:49,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

702
01:05:49,558 --> 01:05:50,319
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

703
01:05:53,986 --> 01:05:58,190
[SPEAKER_07]: So you also see an inclusive swing, and we'll have some more close-ups of some of the equipment there.

704
01:05:58,571 --> 01:06:01,573
[SPEAKER_07]: But that is the first swing.

705
01:06:01,954 --> 01:06:03,095
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called the Guigo swing.

706
01:06:03,175 --> 01:06:09,460
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the first commercially available swing that you can put on a public playground, and it is an inclusive wheelchair swing.

707
01:06:10,021 --> 01:06:17,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Every other wheelchair swing has to be behind its own fence, and it requires special training, and they are always broken.

708
01:06:18,228 --> 01:06:23,332
[SPEAKER_07]: So this actually allows, it doesn't have any special chains, et cetera.

709
01:06:24,292 --> 01:06:30,236
[SPEAKER_07]: And it allows a wheelchair user to be on the swing with ambulatory people at the same time.

710
01:06:30,256 --> 01:06:31,777
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a really truly inclusive swing.

711
01:06:32,098 --> 01:06:41,384
[SPEAKER_17]: We also have a spinner right here that we'll give you another image of later on, but that also allows a wheelchair and ambulatory users to be on as well.

712
01:06:41,877 --> 01:06:48,018
[SPEAKER_07]: the gaga ball pit will have both the kind of scooped out hop over gate and an ADA accessible gate.

713
01:06:48,779 --> 01:06:54,200
[SPEAKER_17]: And some people may notice gaga ball pits in other communities that I've seen are filled with mulch.

714
01:06:55,500 --> 01:07:04,382
[SPEAKER_17]: Ours will not because the mulch limits accessibility for those in a chair or with other ambulatory disabilities.

715
01:07:05,606 --> 01:07:09,371
[SPEAKER_11]: from the chair I've played at one of the middle schools, great game.

716
01:07:10,012 --> 01:07:17,242
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was in with a child, it was in a wheelchair and everybody was having a blast.

717
01:07:18,533 --> 01:07:20,814
[SPEAKER_07]: So gaga ball is a more inclusive dodgeball game.

718
01:07:20,854 --> 01:07:22,854
[SPEAKER_07]: You play it with an open hand and you have to hit it.

719
01:07:23,234 --> 01:07:31,076
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't catch it and huck it at somebody and you are out if you hit somebody above the knees and you just hop out and then you wait your turn and the next 15 kids come in.

720
01:07:31,577 --> 01:07:32,197
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really great.

721
01:07:32,277 --> 01:07:38,338
[SPEAKER_07]: And the PE teacher is excited to do a unit to teach the kids the rules of gaga ball so that they will just be able to play.

722
01:07:39,299 --> 01:07:47,761
[SPEAKER_17]: Last week I shared the plans and the designs just because I was so excited with our student reps and I won't speak for them, but you know,

723
01:07:48,134 --> 01:07:48,894
[SPEAKER_17]: were pretty pumped.

724
01:07:49,074 --> 01:07:50,615
[SPEAKER_17]: They were like, wait, can we come and play on this?

725
01:07:51,955 --> 01:07:53,656
[SPEAKER_17]: So yes.

726
01:07:54,456 --> 01:08:03,139
[SPEAKER_17]: And I guess so overall, as we move through this, like this is an awesome project to be a part of, because this is something great for our kids.

727
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:04,660
[SPEAKER_17]: This will give them

728
01:08:05,276 --> 01:08:13,639
[SPEAKER_17]: an opportunity for creative play, for fun, traditional play, but also to be inclusive of everyone within the school.

729
01:08:14,099 --> 01:08:16,400
[SPEAKER_17]: We've tried to think of every opportunity.

730
01:08:17,341 --> 01:08:18,841
[SPEAKER_17]: We've had some challenging meetings.

731
01:08:19,121 --> 01:08:29,685
[SPEAKER_17]: We've had some really awesome meetings, but we've had a good give and take back and forth to try to develop the absolute best product for our students and then for our teachers to support our students.

732
01:08:29,725 --> 01:08:31,046
[SPEAKER_17]: So enough of my

733
01:08:32,449 --> 01:08:44,818
[SPEAKER_17]: I may get weepy later on when I talk about how the whole city came together in a meeting last week of various department heads around this, but it's really amazing to see how Medford is coming together around this.

734
01:08:44,978 --> 01:08:49,721
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's really confidence building to see this taking place in our city.

735
01:08:51,042 --> 01:08:54,364
[SPEAKER_17]: So here's another view of the stage and the turf field.

736
01:08:54,804 --> 01:09:01,629
[SPEAKER_17]: You'll see seating available around greenery, around new trees and an opportunity

737
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:16,991
[SPEAKER_17]: for students to walk off to the right around this area here with the laser pointer will be one of our sensory paths that will allow students to engage with the paintings and other artwork that are there.

738
01:09:17,011 --> 01:09:20,232
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can see a little bit here how the elevation goes up.

739
01:09:20,292 --> 01:09:23,053
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not very high, but it adds visual interest.

740
01:09:23,073 --> 01:09:26,235
[SPEAKER_07]: It adds some protection for drainage.

741
01:09:27,115 --> 01:09:31,817
[SPEAKER_07]: And then around the edges of that, there will be rain gardens to also absorb the extra water coming in.

742
01:09:32,855 --> 01:09:36,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Both turf and the board in place rubber are permeable.

743
01:09:37,216 --> 01:09:40,877
[SPEAKER_07]: So just so we know that that's got that will catch some of the that.

744
01:09:42,417 --> 01:09:44,077
[SPEAKER_07]: The extra surface runoff.

745
01:09:45,798 --> 01:09:50,679
[SPEAKER_17]: And over here is another slide built into the embankment with some tree stumps for kids to be able to jump.

746
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:52,619
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe a little American Ninja Warrior.

747
01:09:53,359 --> 01:10:01,401
[SPEAKER_17]: The stage, however it may be, and then moving forward here are you can see a better opportunity here for the Wigo swing.

748
01:10:02,512 --> 01:10:03,874
[SPEAKER_07]: And then this is the outdoor classroom.

749
01:10:04,315 --> 01:10:12,846
[SPEAKER_07]: So the outdoor classroom has one side with like with a whiteboard and some stumps as well as accessible seating or just a space for chair users to sit.

750
01:10:14,188 --> 01:10:16,391
[SPEAKER_07]: The teachers really were excited about having guest speakers.

751
01:10:16,431 --> 01:10:19,876
[SPEAKER_07]: They currently use this concrete circle that's kind of out toward

752
01:10:20,436 --> 01:10:24,958
[SPEAKER_07]: the river but it's too big to be able to hear a speaker so they were looking forward to this.

753
01:10:26,018 --> 01:10:41,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Then there's a pollinator garden that will have a path through it and then on the other side past the tree where you can kind of see the child wearing red are raised garden beds that will be accessible as well as a couple of picnic tables for a whole class to be able to fit.

754
01:10:45,086 --> 01:10:50,751
[SPEAKER_07]: So some of the features and the inspiration we've taken, this is a small double basketball hoop.

755
01:10:51,732 --> 01:10:53,514
[SPEAKER_07]: So the kids asked for this.

756
01:10:53,634 --> 01:10:55,315
[SPEAKER_07]: The kids wanted swings.

757
01:10:56,556 --> 01:10:57,697
[SPEAKER_07]: They wanted swings so much.

758
01:10:58,158 --> 01:11:07,066
[SPEAKER_07]: They wanted multiple heights of monkey bars because they wanted the little kids to be able to have monkey bars, but they also recognized that by fourth grade, they were all too tall for what exists now.

759
01:11:08,519 --> 01:11:23,112
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are making sure that little kids can't get on to the big monkey bars, that the design actually helps the teachers supervise by preventing first graders from getting on the tallest monkey bars, because if they can't reach it, then they're not going to fall from a height they can't handle.

760
01:11:24,876 --> 01:11:26,436
[SPEAKER_07]: The left image is of a field.

761
01:11:26,456 --> 01:11:29,578
[SPEAKER_07]: The center one is a giant rope swing.

762
01:11:30,978 --> 01:11:33,320
[SPEAKER_07]: This particular one is called the Viking swing.

763
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:38,022
[SPEAKER_07]: That's from one manufacturer, but there are similar products, and we may end up with one of the others.

764
01:11:38,082 --> 01:11:44,625
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's about a six to eight inch diameter rope, and it's very solid.

765
01:11:46,045 --> 01:11:47,726
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a multi-user swing.

766
01:11:47,846 --> 01:11:52,528
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the concerns that we heard from the teachers is the teachers were very split on the swing issue.

767
01:11:52,569 --> 01:11:53,469
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fascinating.

768
01:11:55,488 --> 01:11:59,649
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd say it was about 50-50 teachers saying, oh my God, we have to have swings.

769
01:11:59,669 --> 01:12:00,770
[SPEAKER_07]: These kids need to move.

770
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:08,071
[SPEAKER_07]: And others being very concerned about turn taking, about impact injuries, mostly about managing kids taking turns.

771
01:12:09,731 --> 01:12:15,193
[SPEAKER_07]: So this and the swing to the right, which is a dish swing, allow multiple users.

772
01:12:15,533 --> 01:12:20,614
[SPEAKER_07]: So the kids are getting that sensory motion without the turn taking and without the,

773
01:12:21,694 --> 01:12:30,439
[SPEAKER_07]: massive space that a swing bay, a typical swing bay takes up and the concern for people running across and getting whacked by someone swinging.

774
01:12:30,939 --> 01:12:41,905
[SPEAKER_07]: So the PT was excited because the rope swing piece would allow her to take a kid out who was working on trunk support and sit over it and be able to help them practice.

775
01:12:41,925 --> 01:12:43,326
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's inclusive in that way.

776
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:47,488
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the kids can transfer, the dish swings are at transfer height.

777
01:12:47,888 --> 01:12:52,713
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the kid can actually lie down in it and play with other kids, because everybody can pile on it at the same time.

778
01:12:54,774 --> 01:12:58,598
[SPEAKER_17]: And so here are some other opportunities for inclusive play that we've already spoken about.

779
01:12:59,318 --> 01:13:02,281
[SPEAKER_17]: In the lower left-hand corner, this is what's known as the WeGo Swing.

780
01:13:03,342 --> 01:13:11,889
[SPEAKER_17]: If you search WeGo Swing on YouTube, you'll see some great videos of how easily people can get on, move the swing, and then move off with inclusive persons as well.

781
01:13:14,252 --> 01:13:25,511
[SPEAKER_17]: making sure that we also have a playhouse for creative play, the gaga ball pit with access, the Wego swing, and then a gathering space around the tree with sustainable decking.

782
01:13:26,906 --> 01:13:29,068
[SPEAKER_17]: Here's the playground structure, our climber.

783
01:13:29,268 --> 01:13:31,170
[SPEAKER_17]: This is designed by Little Tikes right now.

784
01:13:32,051 --> 01:13:35,094
[SPEAKER_07]: We may end up with a different vendor, but this is the structure we're working with right now.

785
01:13:35,114 --> 01:13:35,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

786
01:13:36,475 --> 01:13:38,857
[SPEAKER_17]: But so this is what we're really looking for.

787
01:13:39,638 --> 01:13:46,384
[SPEAKER_17]: As we move through, you'll see over here a significant amount of hanging and climbing elements for students that the students said they wanted.

788
01:13:46,404 --> 01:13:51,569
[SPEAKER_17]: The ability for a double wide slide for their racing and another double slide over here.

789
01:13:52,729 --> 01:13:58,511
[SPEAKER_17]: multiple opportunities for climbing, for play underneath, for that creative outlet for students.

790
01:13:59,492 --> 01:14:04,113
[SPEAKER_17]: Here, this is, just want to be clear to everybody, this is not a bridge to nowhere.

791
01:14:04,133 --> 01:14:08,275
[SPEAKER_17]: This will actually go into the hill that is built between the

792
01:14:08,895 --> 01:14:11,077
[SPEAKER_17]: the two to five area, all right?

793
01:14:11,137 --> 01:14:24,306
[SPEAKER_17]: So this will be an accessible area for students to be able to go up on a wheelchair or for other students with mobility issues to access the play structure, to get on it, and to enjoy various multiple elements, including slides.

794
01:14:25,486 --> 01:14:29,269
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're literally, this is, this is not the structure I would have wanted.

795
01:14:29,329 --> 01:14:34,172
[SPEAKER_07]: But we, because there's so much more play value in the rest of the playground,

796
01:14:36,631 --> 01:14:40,014
[SPEAKER_07]: It's light years better than even a structure.

797
01:14:40,054 --> 01:14:48,601
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the tricks with ramp structures, which we really needed to make sure we have, is that for every one foot of elevation, you have to have 12 feet.

798
01:14:50,226 --> 01:14:56,169
[SPEAKER_07]: of ramp, which means the structure takes up a huge footprint with very little play value added.

799
01:14:56,710 --> 01:15:04,834
[SPEAKER_07]: So being able to access this from the hills, we're already up four and a half feet, and they can just go straight across, makes it a lot more usable.

800
01:15:04,854 --> 01:15:08,556
[SPEAKER_07]: We're also making sure that the slides have transfer spots already.

801
01:15:08,616 --> 01:15:12,859
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the tricks is if you next time you go to a playground, if you see a ramped playground,

802
01:15:13,559 --> 01:15:23,128
[SPEAKER_07]: like imagine you're in a chair and imagine like count the number of things you can actually do because if you get all the way to the top and the slide is on the ground you can't use it.

803
01:15:23,608 --> 01:15:27,372
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's a great playground locally that has lots of ramps and not a lot of fun.

804
01:15:27,752 --> 01:15:30,735
[SPEAKER_17]: It's known as the McGlynn playground and we're looking to replace it.

805
01:15:32,099 --> 01:15:36,340
[SPEAKER_07]: So the kids wanted monkey bars, the kids wanted horizontal bars, you see those on the lower right.

806
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:47,764
[SPEAKER_07]: There's gonna be a storefront that has knee clearance and ignore the kind of the non-attached bits, that's Little Sikes trying to sell us more of their stuff, but we have our stuff picked out.

807
01:15:49,324 --> 01:15:58,187
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not as much ramp as I would have initially envisioned, but it is A, what we can afford and B, is offering as much play value and as consistently

808
01:15:59,833 --> 01:16:07,755
[SPEAKER_07]: we are including the input of the students and the supervision concerns of the teachers into this structure as we can.

809
01:16:09,015 --> 01:16:19,917
[SPEAKER_17]: So as we move through, you know, the master plan really was about a separate preschool area, developmentally and size appropriate equipment for those two to five-year-olds, but while also making sure that it's still fun.

810
01:16:21,117 --> 01:16:28,519
[SPEAKER_17]: Having a four-year-old, I can tell you, she can't stand her play structure because it doesn't provide enough challenge for her, but it is appropriate based on standards.

811
01:16:29,179 --> 01:16:33,580
[SPEAKER_17]: ages 5 to 12, we're providing inclusion in play for all, challenge for all.

812
01:16:34,581 --> 01:16:43,424
[SPEAKER_17]: The multiple things that we have mentioned tonight, from basketball to climber to field to fill in the blank, is going to give students the opportunity to be engaged.

813
01:16:43,604 --> 01:16:53,167
[SPEAKER_17]: That flexible use field allows for us to have really a lot of play that kids can create on their own, whether it's ball, running, tag, however it may be,

814
01:16:54,147 --> 01:16:58,929
[SPEAKER_17]: And the outdoor classroom really offers staff something that they've requested as well.

815
01:16:59,149 --> 01:17:00,669
[SPEAKER_17]: So what's our budget?

816
01:17:00,769 --> 01:17:14,153
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, the play area that's inclusive of the courts, the basketball court, the gaga ball, the Viking swing, the play structures, all those elements comes in at the neighborhood of $2 million.

817
01:17:14,473 --> 01:17:16,594
[SPEAKER_17]: Our preschool play area is about $250,000.

818
01:17:16,654 --> 01:17:17,314
[SPEAKER_17]: Our turf field is another $250,000.

819
01:17:17,434 --> 01:17:18,715
[SPEAKER_17]: Our outdoor classroom is $100,000.

820
01:17:23,676 --> 01:17:27,203
[SPEAKER_17]: for a project total in the neighborhood of $2.6 million.

821
01:17:27,644 --> 01:17:31,111
[SPEAKER_07]: To be very clear, I know that that sounds like a ridiculous amount of money.

822
01:17:31,312 --> 01:17:33,356
[SPEAKER_07]: This is pretty standard for playgrounds right now.

823
01:17:34,726 --> 01:17:37,387
[SPEAKER_07]: The equipment is more expensive, the shipping is more expensive.

824
01:17:37,847 --> 01:17:50,732
[SPEAKER_07]: We learned there was a landscape architect who's not on this project who spoke with us at the community preservation commission meeting the other day and just confirmed that this is the neighborhood of the playgrounds that she's looking at as well.

825
01:17:51,192 --> 01:17:55,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Inclusive play elements are more expensive, unfortunately.

826
01:17:55,494 --> 01:17:56,934
[SPEAKER_07]: The swing is $50,000 without install.

827
01:17:59,614 --> 01:18:13,368
[SPEAKER_07]: It's wild, but this is consistent with with playground design and we're we haven't gotten to the kind of value decisions where we may have to make some of the harder decisions, but we have a solid budget and.

828
01:18:15,010 --> 01:18:16,251
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is this is what they cost.

829
01:18:16,856 --> 01:18:23,938
[SPEAKER_11]: And just something to point out, if I may, from the chair, I met with Shanine and Dr. Cushing last week, and first of all, thank you for everybody.

830
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:24,818
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the committee.

831
01:18:24,858 --> 01:18:34,121
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Shani and Melanie have been part of it, as well as the committee, but I want to point out that the funding sources are not going to come from the general budget.

832
01:18:34,161 --> 01:18:37,082
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you're going to put in, like you said, a CPA application.

833
01:18:37,722 --> 01:18:40,123
[SPEAKER_11]: The two of you will also be before the city council.

834
01:18:40,203 --> 01:18:40,603
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

835
01:18:40,643 --> 01:18:43,784
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm assuming you'll do some similar presentation or the same one.

836
01:18:44,605 --> 01:18:55,660
[SPEAKER_11]: That's because we're going to be asking the city council to give comment on $750,000 going to this from our opera funding that was top of our survey.

837
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:59,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably top three was outdoor space, outdoor play area, open space.

838
01:19:00,066 --> 01:19:01,227
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's a large chunk of this.

839
01:19:01,267 --> 01:19:04,629
[SPEAKER_11]: We also have, we're going to be creative CDBG funding linkage.

840
01:19:05,349 --> 01:19:08,931
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we have to do it in two stages, like I said, in the meeting, then we'll have to do that.

841
01:19:09,011 --> 01:19:15,495
[SPEAKER_11]: But we, this is definitely something we want, we want to see happen for our students, for our families and for the entire city.

842
01:19:15,535 --> 01:19:25,181
[SPEAKER_11]: Like you said, everybody uses playground siblings when they're a brother or sister, is that a soccer game or a softball game or a baseball game?

843
01:19:25,702 --> 01:19:26,242
[SPEAKER_11]: People who are

844
01:19:26,701 --> 01:19:29,082
[SPEAKER_11]: frequenting Hormel stadium or the La Conte rink.

845
01:19:29,202 --> 01:19:33,883
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, people are always in this area, so we'll benefit the entire community.

846
01:19:34,263 --> 01:19:35,303
[SPEAKER_11]: So for that, I thank you.

847
01:19:35,403 --> 01:19:39,765
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just wanted to point out the funding sources, which I guess you had next anyway.

848
01:19:40,165 --> 01:19:42,805
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, and I mean, I do want to say thank you to the mayor and her staff.

849
01:19:42,966 --> 01:19:45,646
[SPEAKER_17]: As I said last week, we had, we had a meeting with the mayor.

850
01:19:45,666 --> 01:19:49,367
[SPEAKER_17]: She's been nothing but supportive and really behind this project, a hundred percent.

851
01:19:49,767 --> 01:19:55,269
[SPEAKER_17]: We also had a meeting with multiple members of the mayor staff last week that was scheduled for an hour, went to almost two hours.

852
01:19:55,709 --> 01:20:02,293
[SPEAKER_17]: because there's a commitment by those individuals to make sure that this project is funded.

853
01:20:02,793 --> 01:20:05,275
[SPEAKER_17]: They see the value in it as an inclusive playground.

854
01:20:05,915 --> 01:20:10,278
[SPEAKER_17]: And so if there are any donors out there, feel free to let us know.

855
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:18,883
[SPEAKER_17]: But I guess the other thing too, that I just want to say is that this is a tremendous opportunity for the students of Medford to have play value that they deserve.

856
01:20:19,003 --> 01:20:21,845
[SPEAKER_17]: And it is completely been supported by the mayor and her staff.

857
01:20:23,384 --> 01:20:37,550
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have 900,000 requests to the Community Preservation Commission, which is fees that are paid through property taxes, as well as some matching funds from the state.

858
01:20:37,570 --> 01:20:42,372
[SPEAKER_07]: 750,000 requests of the American Rescue Plan Act for COVID relief funding called ARPA.

859
01:20:43,713 --> 01:20:50,316
[SPEAKER_07]: And then 900,000 through the Community Development Block Grants, which is federal housing and urban development funds the city gets annually.

860
01:20:52,122 --> 01:21:07,333
[SPEAKER_07]: That one, the Community Preservation Commission and the Community Development Block Grants may need to be split between fiscal years, but we're trying to figure out how, and it looks like we might be able to use two different fiscal years of funding, but have one phased project.

861
01:21:07,633 --> 01:21:14,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if there's enough money up front that we can order equipment and those kinds of things, then we could pay the final bills in FY24.

862
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,201
[SPEAKER_07]: with the money that comes in in August.

863
01:21:17,862 --> 01:21:23,587
[SPEAKER_17]: And finally, I had an extensive conversation today with our CCL shop at Medford High School.

864
01:21:24,428 --> 01:21:33,996
[SPEAKER_17]: Any RFP that we put out for this will include using Medford students so that this is a true educational learning opportunity.

865
01:21:34,076 --> 01:21:38,981
[SPEAKER_17]: They're also going to be looking at how we could make an easily accessible point

866
01:21:39,441 --> 01:21:40,422
[SPEAKER_17]: to Hormel Stadium.

867
01:21:40,922 --> 01:22:01,530
[SPEAKER_17]: They'll be out there in the next week to look at adding a gate to Hormel so students would be able to get there if this playground is not ready while students are in session, and that we would be able to access Hormel in a much easier fashion than is currently, and then also looking at their ability to demolish the current.

868
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:06,072
[SPEAKER_17]: But we want to make sure that we use our students from the CCL shop so that they get a learning opportunity.

869
01:22:06,492 --> 01:22:08,993
[SPEAKER_17]: Mark Holm is our student representative here tonight.

870
01:22:09,528 --> 01:22:12,190
[SPEAKER_17]: So as a senior, hopefully she would be a part of this.

871
01:22:12,450 --> 01:22:21,235
[SPEAKER_07]: And to be very clear, because I know there are probably a lot of teachers watching, we will be doing a collaborative recess, interim recess planning process with the teachers.

872
01:22:21,275 --> 01:22:25,898
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not going to make any decisions without the staff about how this interim time is.

873
01:22:26,078 --> 01:22:29,040
[SPEAKER_07]: The reality is the playground will be closed for a while during school.

874
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:30,401
[SPEAKER_07]: It just will.

875
01:22:30,661 --> 01:22:33,483
[SPEAKER_17]: But we will be connecting with teachers to make sure it is collaborative.

876
01:22:34,778 --> 01:22:40,881
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're wondering, the last question is, what is the desire for this work to be supported by fundraising and corporate grants?

877
01:22:40,921 --> 01:22:42,702
[SPEAKER_07]: I was looking at a bunch of bank grants the other day.

878
01:22:42,722 --> 01:22:45,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want us doing a brick walkway program?

879
01:22:45,884 --> 01:22:57,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Because this really sets the precedent, the other three schools, not to mention the two playgrounds, the preschool playgrounds at the high school, will need to be replaced in the next five to 10 years.

880
01:22:59,410 --> 01:23:10,295
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't have to be answered right now, but maybe by the next meeting, if you could have some decisions made on if you would like us to pursue fundraising and if that's the precedent you want to set for these projects.

881
01:23:11,395 --> 01:23:14,877
[SPEAKER_11]: And by staff that you met with, was that

882
01:23:15,444 --> 01:23:20,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Director Hunt from PDS, who knows of all the grants that we could apply for for this and any other playground?

883
01:23:20,847 --> 01:23:39,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so we met with members of the planning department, including Alicia Hunt and Danielle Evans, and multiple planning, and both the director of the CPC and the ARPA manager, the federal funds manager.

884
01:23:39,879 --> 01:23:40,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

885
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:44,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Edward-Vincent, then Member McLaughlin, Member Rousseau, Member Graham.

886
01:23:44,827 --> 01:23:50,932
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to say thank you so much for lending your expertise to the district.

887
01:23:50,992 --> 01:23:58,157
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing for this comprehensive presentation and to our members who are also part of this committee.

888
01:23:58,938 --> 01:24:04,882
[SPEAKER_16]: This really looks exciting and I can't wait to see it actually come into fruition.

889
01:24:04,922 --> 01:24:06,503
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you for all of your support.

890
01:24:06,523 --> 01:24:11,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

891
01:24:11,747 --> 01:24:12,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin.

892
01:24:13,458 --> 01:24:13,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

893
01:24:13,818 --> 01:24:18,299
[SPEAKER_09]: I also wanted to say thank you for the presentation, for the commitment, Janine.

894
01:24:18,499 --> 01:24:27,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Janine and I first met at Communitas today, at Swim Lessons for my baby daughter with a disability.

895
01:24:27,441 --> 01:24:28,961
[SPEAKER_09]: She was five.

896
01:24:29,101 --> 01:24:32,701
[SPEAKER_09]: She's about to be 15 for Swim Lessons.

897
01:24:32,782 --> 01:24:37,262
[SPEAKER_09]: And the commitment that you have to persons with disability is really outstanding.

898
01:24:37,302 --> 01:24:40,463
[SPEAKER_09]: And the commitment that you've had to this project has been so remarkable into your community.

899
01:24:41,263 --> 01:24:57,475
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to say thank you so much for that and also to all of the committee members who have been so active and we had such good dialogue and, you know, I think good heartedness and people really wanting to do the right thing by our children and Medford as a whole, all of our children, all of our community.

900
01:24:57,495 --> 01:25:02,499
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's such a relief, frankly, to have something really positive in our community.

901
01:25:03,178 --> 01:25:05,080
[SPEAKER_09]: to be looking at and to be looking forward to.

902
01:25:05,821 --> 01:25:14,990
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did want to share this story, and I know you folks have heard it, but not everybody has, and so I do want to share it, is that years ago, there was a family here in Medford.

903
01:25:15,430 --> 01:25:18,213
[SPEAKER_09]: I was first learning about disability and disability advocacy.

904
01:25:18,233 --> 01:25:24,559
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a mother who was working with a family leadership series as part of a state organization.

905
01:25:24,599 --> 01:25:25,440
[SPEAKER_09]: She's a Medford mom.

906
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:32,068
[SPEAKER_09]: She had a teenage daughter at the time, who was in a wheelchair very complex medical needs and about.

907
01:25:32,949 --> 01:25:43,423
[SPEAKER_09]: She had a birth injury, and her daughter was about 15 but had sort of the intellectual ability of a less than one year old and very physically not mobile.

908
01:25:44,176 --> 01:25:49,501
[SPEAKER_09]: and was in Metro Public Schools, but was in a residential program because of her complex medical needs.

909
01:25:50,322 --> 01:26:02,073
[SPEAKER_09]: But even in residential programs, our complex medically, complex children with medical needs come home, right, for holidays, vacations, summer vacations, what have you.

910
01:26:03,334 --> 01:26:12,658
[SPEAKER_09]: This particular little girl, when she would come home with her mom, who did not have access to a vehicle, what have you, to get around as much as she wanted to, had no place to take her daughter.

911
01:26:12,698 --> 01:26:15,399
[SPEAKER_09]: She had no playground to go to, and all her daughter wanted to do was swing.

912
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:16,359
[SPEAKER_09]: She loved to swing.

913
01:26:17,079 --> 01:26:19,360
[SPEAKER_09]: And she was in a wheelchair, and there was no ability for her to swing.

914
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:31,685
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I knew when this project came about that I really wanted to work on it, and also that I really wanted to make sure that there was an ability for a person with a disability in a wheelchair to be able to get on a swing with their child, who really needed it.

915
01:26:32,305 --> 01:26:54,430
[SPEAKER_09]: and you know this is probably the thing I'll be most proud of having worked on as a school committee member and I'm really so you know honored that you guys are part of this and that member Graham and everybody else in the community is part of this and I really want to know in terms of donating sign me up if you need you know I'm happy to donate whatever whatever we need to try to make this happen I think this is really critical so thank you so much.

916
01:26:54,901 --> 01:27:02,766
[SPEAKER_07]: I did reach out to the library as well to ask for any lessons learned in their fundraising process will have information on that as well if you decide that you'd like us to proceed.

917
01:27:04,387 --> 01:27:06,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you member so the member Graham.

918
01:27:07,589 --> 01:27:08,049
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

919
01:27:08,309 --> 01:27:10,611
[SPEAKER_15]: I really appreciate all the hard work.

920
01:27:10,691 --> 01:27:14,333
[SPEAKER_15]: I know it was a lot of work and of course it's not done by.

921
01:27:15,013 --> 01:27:17,315
[SPEAKER_15]: I had a couple of questions.

922
01:27:19,936 --> 01:27:22,338
[SPEAKER_15]: for the process of actually performing the build.

923
01:27:23,819 --> 01:27:26,521
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not doing our own project management, I assume.

924
01:27:28,842 --> 01:27:32,765
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm always happy to have the vote.

925
01:27:33,803 --> 01:27:37,364
[SPEAKER_15]: participating in whatever they can.

926
01:27:37,384 --> 01:27:56,607
[SPEAKER_15]: I also get very nervous when we think of them as a free workforce, which I don't mean to suggest that's what you were saying, but the reason I asked about the project management company is because I can't fathom a project management company being willing to insert into their critical path.

927
01:27:57,787 --> 01:28:00,208
[SPEAKER_15]: The Vogue students will do something.

928
01:28:01,124 --> 01:28:04,586
[SPEAKER_15]: That that's just not how you build anything.

929
01:28:04,806 --> 01:28:16,934
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, so I think, you know, if there's something that the students can be brought into, and it is definitely specifically educational related rather than they're just like free labor.

930
01:28:17,575 --> 01:28:18,395
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm all for it.

931
01:28:19,176 --> 01:28:22,478
[SPEAKER_15]: I just, I get both excited and really like

932
01:28:23,338 --> 01:28:26,459
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's my fifth year and I've heard a hundred times.

933
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:28,560
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's have the Volk students build it for us.

934
01:28:29,341 --> 01:28:32,662
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's always been a response to, we don't have any money.

935
01:28:33,082 --> 01:28:36,703
[SPEAKER_15]: It's never been a response to, we think the Volk students would get a great education.

936
01:28:36,743 --> 01:28:38,024
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe we should do a project.

937
01:28:38,344 --> 01:28:39,244
[SPEAKER_15]: And here's the project.

938
01:28:39,284 --> 01:28:40,385
[SPEAKER_15]: It's always been, we're broke.

939
01:28:41,365 --> 01:28:43,987
[SPEAKER_15]: let's see if we can get some free labor out of our student body.

940
01:28:44,708 --> 01:28:53,915
[SPEAKER_15]: So I have a very visceral response to every time I hear it brought up, and I don't mean to suggest that this project was doing that same thing, so.

941
01:28:54,075 --> 01:28:56,858
[SPEAKER_17]: If I could just, this is actually the opposite of that.

942
01:28:57,238 --> 01:29:04,504
[SPEAKER_17]: This is making, our CCL shop has very strong connections with the laborers union.

943
01:29:05,284 --> 01:29:21,018
[SPEAKER_17]: And by partnering through the laborers union, we're hoping we're going to be able to give students a real authentic educational experience to be able to learn how play structures and structures of these that require special certifications to install.

944
01:29:21,516 --> 01:29:28,082
[SPEAKER_17]: that this is yet another thing that our students can put a feather in their cap when they enter the workforce.

945
01:29:28,242 --> 01:29:35,970
[SPEAKER_17]: As an example, I believe that by partnering with the DPW, you're going to be able to get two additional certifications and licenses.

946
01:29:36,370 --> 01:29:39,473
[SPEAKER_17]: So if our students can have that type of an experience,

947
01:29:39,893 --> 01:29:51,905
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I'm really looking for, is to have a double-edged sword of, we can build an awesome play structure, an awesome environment for our students, but also have the Medford students be invested in it in a real sense.

948
01:29:52,926 --> 01:29:53,427
[SPEAKER_15]: That's great.

949
01:29:53,587 --> 01:29:55,909
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm happy and really excited to hear that.

950
01:29:56,069 --> 01:30:00,414
[SPEAKER_15]: And I did not expect you to have thought of them as a work, as free labor.

951
01:30:00,474 --> 01:30:02,616
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to bring it up.

952
01:30:02,756 --> 01:30:03,337
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great point.

953
01:30:03,817 --> 01:30:08,264
[SPEAKER_15]: And then my other question, which I hope will come to me in a moment.

954
01:30:08,665 --> 01:30:10,347
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yes, about fundraising.

955
01:30:11,088 --> 01:30:11,349
[SPEAKER_15]: You know,

956
01:30:14,397 --> 01:30:18,879
[SPEAKER_15]: But the corporate grants part, I mean, hey, if anybody's got money they want to hand out, that's fine.

957
01:30:19,239 --> 01:30:41,691
[SPEAKER_15]: I just also do not, I'm not comfortable with the playground getting named after some rich person or the Chase Bank Playground, you know, like, not picking on Chase specifically, but, you know, I do feel very much like this is a public good, the public should pay for it.

958
01:30:43,044 --> 01:30:53,092
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we want the companies and the rich to pay for it, then we should tax them properly, not beg them for their tax deduction so they cannot pay more taxes.

959
01:30:54,032 --> 01:31:01,498
[SPEAKER_15]: So I feel pretty strongly I'm opposed to corporate grants, unless there are really companies that are handing out money and not expecting their name on anything.

960
01:31:01,558 --> 01:31:03,039
[SPEAKER_15]: But I don't think that's a thing.

961
01:31:04,681 --> 01:31:07,583
[SPEAKER_15]: And as for fundraising, other than the corporate part,

962
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:12,722
[SPEAKER_15]: look mad for public schools will take a check from anybody any day of the week.

963
01:31:13,522 --> 01:31:17,725
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that's fine that we, you know, offer that up.

964
01:31:18,585 --> 01:31:24,549
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think that we should be cautious that it's not a critical part of the funding plan.

965
01:31:24,569 --> 01:31:31,073
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, because then when if, you know, inflation is high,

966
01:31:33,137 --> 01:31:46,501
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, there's a lot of reasons why I think expecting the public to come out with $100,000, $500,000 of checks to write seems to me to be a bit of a stretch.

967
01:31:47,862 --> 01:31:56,705
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm all for the raising money from the public, but I do think we should not make it a key element of the financing part.

968
01:31:56,885 --> 01:31:57,185
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

969
01:32:02,234 --> 01:32:03,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

970
01:32:07,257 --> 01:32:07,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

971
01:32:07,837 --> 01:32:09,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a couple of things.

972
01:32:10,399 --> 01:32:11,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Shanine, for all your work.

973
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:24,807
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's been a spirited group and we've had a lot of good discussion and sometimes spirited groups are really hard to manage and you've done a really lovely job listening to everybody.

974
01:32:24,867 --> 01:32:25,667
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for that.

975
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:29,151
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember Ms.

976
01:32:29,171 --> 01:32:33,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Stone was just asking me about the timeline of like, when can a shovel go in the ground?

977
01:32:33,994 --> 01:32:41,139
[SPEAKER_08]: And I told her what I thought, but I think you guys should answer that question more officially.

978
01:32:41,419 --> 01:32:50,206
[SPEAKER_08]: And just to reiterate, like, if you look at the planned funding, the funding is not coming out of our operating budget.

979
01:32:50,366 --> 01:32:52,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are capital budget requests.

980
01:32:53,328 --> 01:32:54,389
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one-time funds.

981
01:32:54,849 --> 01:32:56,270
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think, you know,

982
01:32:57,196 --> 01:33:09,962
[SPEAKER_08]: where uniquely in a place where there is one-time funding available for this, which is great, because I don't believe we would see it out of our operating budget in any way, shape, or form.

983
01:33:11,923 --> 01:33:20,907
[SPEAKER_08]: But the other thing I wanted to suggest to the committee is that, or I'll make a motion that we send the funding

984
01:33:22,148 --> 01:33:33,295
[SPEAKER_08]: the naming to the sorry, we'll send a request to the strategic planning subcommittee that they work on and create

985
01:33:34,076 --> 01:33:37,819
[SPEAKER_08]: a naming and fundraising policy for Medford Public Schools.

986
01:33:38,780 --> 01:34:01,897
[SPEAKER_08]: That would certainly be guidance for this program, but I think as we look forward to hopefully some other really big, amazing projects in Medford Public Schools that having some guidance and some precedent around naming and fundraising on behalf of our schools can be sort of thoughtfully entertained now rather than in the heat of those moments.

987
01:34:03,197 --> 01:34:06,260
[SPEAKER_08]: That is my motion to send to the strategic planning subcommittee.

988
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:07,380
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be really helpful.

989
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:10,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion for approval by member Graham, seconded by member McLaughlin.

990
01:34:10,783 --> 01:34:11,603
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

991
01:34:12,204 --> 01:34:12,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

992
01:34:12,624 --> 01:34:13,404
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

993
01:34:14,025 --> 01:34:14,705
[SPEAKER_11]: The ayes have it.

994
01:34:14,725 --> 01:34:30,016
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if y'all also wanna potentially have a roll call vote to support our funding, just as a way to show the city council, the school committees on board and wants the project to move forward, as I know, the week before the city council in the next few meetings.

995
01:34:32,022 --> 01:34:44,190
[SPEAKER_11]: to support 750,000 coming from APA towards the McGlynn Playground project by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Hayes.

996
01:34:44,951 --> 01:34:45,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call, please.

997
01:34:48,773 --> 01:34:49,333
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Graham.

998
01:34:49,434 --> 01:34:50,114
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

999
01:34:51,615 --> 01:34:52,095
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Hayes.

1000
01:34:52,375 --> 01:34:52,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1001
01:34:53,456 --> 01:34:54,117
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Betz.

1002
01:34:54,197 --> 01:34:54,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1003
01:34:55,057 --> 01:34:55,778
[SPEAKER_15]: Member McLaughlin.

1004
01:34:57,979 --> 01:34:58,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1005
01:35:00,180 --> 01:35:00,801
[SPEAKER_15]: Member McDowell.

1006
01:35:00,841 --> 01:35:00,981
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1007
01:35:02,745 --> 01:35:02,965
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1008
01:35:03,486 --> 01:35:03,666
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1009
01:35:03,906 --> 01:35:05,006
[SPEAKER_15]: I just had an additional question.

1010
01:35:05,027 --> 01:35:09,269
[SPEAKER_15]: If you would let us know when this city council presentation is going to be, that would be really helpful.

1011
01:35:09,289 --> 01:35:10,690
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe we're scheduled for the 20th.

1012
01:35:21,724 --> 01:35:22,705
[SPEAKER_07]: of this month, is that?

1013
01:35:22,785 --> 01:35:25,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the day you picked the money to get you on the agenda?

1014
01:35:25,886 --> 01:35:31,550
[SPEAKER_07]: So the earlier we can get, and the willingness to make this work was very clear.

1015
01:35:31,670 --> 01:35:36,272
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the questions that everybody has about where we're going to get all the other pieces.

1016
01:35:36,512 --> 01:35:49,780
[SPEAKER_07]: So the more quickly we can do things like get the council to approve the ARPA funding tells the Community Preservation Commission how much they need to put in and how much the planning department needs to plan for this year's fiscal

1017
01:35:50,710 --> 01:35:52,291
[SPEAKER_07]: contribution versus next year's.

1018
01:35:53,272 --> 01:35:57,656
[SPEAKER_07]: So as quickly as we can make those decisions will help us get the shovels in the ground faster.

1019
01:35:57,676 --> 01:35:59,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.

1020
01:35:59,257 --> 01:35:59,497
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1021
01:35:59,557 --> 01:36:01,579
[SPEAKER_17]: And to speak to that shovel on the ground question.

1022
01:36:01,759 --> 01:36:15,909
[SPEAKER_17]: So that is also one of those major questions because of delays in procurements of delays in items while we hope to have this out to bid in the February timeframe, February, March timeframe.

1023
01:36:17,070 --> 01:36:18,311
[SPEAKER_17]: The reality is that

1024
01:36:19,812 --> 01:36:26,915
[SPEAKER_17]: the companies that bid may come back and say that the start date is not July 1, that it's some other point.

1025
01:36:27,376 --> 01:36:32,258
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's one of those things that we still have to figure out as we approach it.

1026
01:36:32,838 --> 01:36:46,044
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things is that we'll be able to order, one of the vendors has a state contract, so we're going to be able to order the swing and the merry-go-round piece at the discounted rate with the state contract, and then we won't have to have any substitute equipment.

1027
01:36:46,784 --> 01:36:51,207
[SPEAKER_07]: So as many of the pieces that we can buy like that will save us money and we can order them now.

1028
01:36:51,267 --> 01:36:58,652
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's, I believe there's 400,000 in community development block grant funding that we can use now to start ordering equipment once these are done.

1029
01:36:58,892 --> 01:37:08,738
[SPEAKER_07]: And the funding that did the design study also included our construction documents, which as soon as we vote on this final design as a committee will be underway.

1030
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:09,419
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

1031
01:37:09,919 --> 01:37:10,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1032
01:37:10,299 --> 01:37:12,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Rousseau, and then we're going to get to the labor relations report.

1033
01:37:12,998 --> 01:37:13,319
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1034
01:37:13,980 --> 01:37:22,739
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there any specialized equipment that will be required for maintenance and would that be something the DPW or the schools would need to purchase?

1035
01:37:24,235 --> 01:37:30,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I will be happy to present on a system I think that the schools need to undergo to do inspections, et cetera.

1036
01:37:30,517 --> 01:37:41,000
[SPEAKER_07]: We're working with both DPW and John McLaughlin Building and Grounds to increase the capacity of both departments who are managing playgrounds in the city to keep them safer.

1037
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:42,180
[SPEAKER_07]: We do need to budget.

1038
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:50,263
[SPEAKER_07]: So if, for example, we paid $900 for the initial inspection of this playground, and then we got a grant for

1039
01:37:52,677 --> 01:38:02,340
[SPEAKER_07]: for about, yeah, that was including, so it was about 4,000 to do all the other playgrounds that are owned by the school department.

1040
01:38:02,420 --> 01:38:04,161
[SPEAKER_07]: And that really needs to be an annual process.

1041
01:38:04,181 --> 01:38:13,664
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's something that while CPC did fund it this time as an assessment, because we don't know what our playgrounds need, they won't fund it again because it's maintenance.

1042
01:38:13,925 --> 01:38:14,925
[SPEAKER_07]: They won't fund maintenance.

1043
01:38:14,965 --> 01:38:20,807
[SPEAKER_07]: So we need to start thinking about how we're budgeting for not only repairs, but preventative maintenance and replacement slides, et cetera.

1044
01:38:21,591 --> 01:38:30,437
[SPEAKER_07]: so that we can maintain our current playgrounds longer, extend their lives and not run into this playground where it really needed to be bulldozed several years ago, because it hasn't been maintained.

1045
01:38:30,838 --> 01:38:31,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1046
01:38:32,579 --> 01:38:32,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1047
01:38:33,059 --> 01:38:33,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1048
01:38:36,482 --> 01:38:42,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Next up, we have number four, Labor Relations Report, Mr. David Murphy, Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations.

1049
01:38:43,527 --> 01:38:43,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Murphy.

1050
01:38:51,991 --> 01:38:54,092
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening, Mayor, members of the school committee.

1051
01:38:54,112 --> 01:39:00,334
[SPEAKER_14]: That wasn't a call and response.

1052
01:39:00,374 --> 01:39:07,076
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just slowly warming up for our latest labor relations update.

1053
01:39:07,116 --> 01:39:12,578
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you for the opportunity to address you tonight.

1054
01:39:13,418 --> 01:39:18,380
[SPEAKER_14]: And I hope to answer some questions that you may have with respect to

1055
01:39:19,790 --> 01:39:26,595
[SPEAKER_14]: where we are with our negotiations and where it is that we hope to go.

1056
01:39:28,337 --> 01:39:43,269
[SPEAKER_14]: And as the committee knows, I've had the privilege of presenting a number of these presentations over the past several years, and particularly over the last four or five months.

1057
01:39:44,790 --> 01:39:45,610
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think

1058
01:39:47,561 --> 01:40:04,020
[SPEAKER_14]: In situations like ongoing negotiations, there's always a certain calibration or thoughtfulness that you want to put in with respect to what it is that you are conveying publicly.

1059
01:40:07,598 --> 01:40:13,002
[SPEAKER_14]: sort of the public narrative that gets wrapped around a particular negotiation.

1060
01:40:13,222 --> 01:40:22,089
[SPEAKER_14]: And as has been the case in our negotiation with our teachers, and as is the case in essentially all collective bargaining in the public sphere,

1061
01:40:23,092 --> 01:40:39,458
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not at all uncommon for the bargaining unit and the bargaining unit leadership in particular to spend more time communicating publicly than the governing body of the school system does or the district leadership does.

1062
01:40:40,078 --> 01:40:41,579
[SPEAKER_14]: And that makes sense.

1063
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:46,400
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it has to do with the dynamic, the legal dynamic, for one.

1064
01:40:48,479 --> 01:40:59,589
[SPEAKER_14]: And the fact that their union leadership is fulfilling their responsibilities that they have to advocate zealously on behalf of their members.

1065
01:41:02,358 --> 01:41:20,152
[SPEAKER_14]: It's also, again, not uncommon that as a negotiation plays out, there becomes a responsibility on the part of the district to speak more frequently and at times more explicitly so as to ensure the members of the community

1066
01:41:20,993 --> 01:41:36,032
[SPEAKER_14]: who at the end of the day are footing the bill for this contract and every other contract that we as an employer enter into, have an accurate set of information and data so as to make their assessment.

1067
01:41:38,843 --> 01:41:54,346
[SPEAKER_14]: As this negotiation now has now stretched into a month 13, I know that it's the case that the tenor and the tone at times has been a challenge.

1068
01:41:55,467 --> 01:41:58,907
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's been a challenge, I think, for those of us that have been at the bargaining table

1069
01:42:02,045 --> 01:42:07,329
[SPEAKER_14]: feel compelled to respond to what we believe to be inaccurate information that's disseminated.

1070
01:42:08,170 --> 01:42:18,498
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know it's a challenge for members of the school committee, as well as the city administration, to be reading about and hearing about

1071
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:37,128
[SPEAKER_14]: a set of facts, and I'm using that sort of as a term of art for the moment, that is very different than the information that we have conveyed to you as an administration, that we have provided to you a voluminous amount of documentation to support.

1072
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:54,969
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to start by extending, on behalf of the administration, gratitude to the members of the school committee for your patience and for your support that you've demonstrated in a variety of ways as we've gone through this process.

1073
01:42:55,889 --> 01:43:01,692
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to say clearly that I think for whatever

1074
01:43:03,095 --> 01:43:09,040
[SPEAKER_14]: assertions that folks may make with regard to the narrative that's attached to these negotiations.

1075
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:20,529
[SPEAKER_14]: I think our strategic decision to not speak publicly over the course of the vast majority of months of negotiation was the correct one.

1076
01:43:21,209 --> 01:43:29,836
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it is in the interest of the community to have a nonstop back and forth

1077
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:56,869
[SPEAKER_14]: between union leaders that are doing their job representing their members and the district that is doing its job trying to make decisions that will ensure whoever has the honor to serve in the roles that the seven of you and the five of us serve in in the years ahead are positioned to make investments necessary to serve students.

1078
01:43:58,570 --> 01:43:59,711
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that was the right decision.

1079
01:44:01,283 --> 01:44:10,089
[SPEAKER_14]: At the same time, there does come a point at which there is so much misinformation that gets shared.

1080
01:44:11,429 --> 01:44:24,938
[SPEAKER_14]: And the work that we as an administration and you as a governing body have done is mischaracterized to such an extent that I don't believe we have any other choice

1081
01:44:26,032 --> 01:44:32,358
[SPEAKER_14]: but to speak clearly and to do our best to clarify what's true and what's not.

1082
01:44:33,279 --> 01:44:42,287
[SPEAKER_14]: And when we do that, because we're the employer, and at no point, particularly in the realm of social media, are we ever going to be considered the good guys.

1083
01:44:43,048 --> 01:44:48,333
[SPEAKER_14]: And if anyone signed up for any of these roles hoping to be the good guy in this dynamic, I can assure you it's not going to happen.

1084
01:44:49,114 --> 01:44:49,554
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's OK.

1085
01:44:51,977 --> 01:44:53,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Because this really isn't about good or bad.

1086
01:44:54,802 --> 01:44:57,746
[SPEAKER_14]: It is about accurate and inaccurate.

1087
01:44:59,269 --> 01:45:03,656
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think our obligation is to try to share as much accurate information as possible.

1088
01:45:04,932 --> 01:45:10,116
[SPEAKER_14]: A very quick antidote before we go through this deck, and I promise we'll be quick because you've seen a lot of it before.

1089
01:45:10,136 --> 01:45:20,865
[SPEAKER_14]: I had occasion to have a conversation with a Medford community leader, not someone who is in this room at the moment, but someone I respect and someone who was thoughtful enough to share.

1090
01:45:23,354 --> 01:45:24,955
[SPEAKER_14]: the person's take perspective.

1091
01:45:25,615 --> 01:45:38,399
[SPEAKER_14]: And the person said that the facts and the law support the information that we are sharing and that the administration has shared with you routinely in these public updates.

1092
01:45:39,379 --> 01:45:42,360
[SPEAKER_14]: And they said that, but there's a lot of emotion.

1093
01:45:43,421 --> 01:45:49,983
[SPEAKER_14]: And then for that reason, we had to understand that we shouldn't, that we should just essentially

1094
01:45:51,488 --> 01:45:55,430
[SPEAKER_14]: hand over exactly what's being asked for, despite the financial implications.

1095
01:45:56,251 --> 01:46:07,738
[SPEAKER_14]: And as you've heard me say many, many times, when a district enters into an agreement that it cannot afford, it is the students who are most vulnerable, who need services the most, who suffer.

1096
01:46:08,498 --> 01:46:09,659
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not a scare tactic.

1097
01:46:10,239 --> 01:46:13,882
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not an appeal to anyone's emotion.

1098
01:46:14,262 --> 01:46:16,943
[SPEAKER_14]: As I've said, apparently I only have facts and the law on my side.

1099
01:46:18,164 --> 01:46:19,305
[SPEAKER_14]: That's just reality.

1100
01:46:20,256 --> 01:46:26,458
[SPEAKER_14]: And when a school committee makes that type of mistake, well, it's not overnight.

1101
01:46:26,939 --> 01:46:33,581
[SPEAKER_14]: The services we provide to students today will be the services that we provide tomorrow, regardless of what you vote for, regardless of what the Teachers Union ratifies.

1102
01:46:34,201 --> 01:46:37,403
[SPEAKER_14]: But over time, structural deficits have a cost.

1103
01:46:38,203 --> 01:46:40,704
[SPEAKER_14]: And the cost is paid by students.

1104
01:46:41,884 --> 01:46:42,225
[SPEAKER_14]: And so,

1105
01:46:43,800 --> 01:47:01,932
[SPEAKER_14]: As you've heard me start every single one of these presentations saying that we have the utmost respect for our teachers and we recognize that it is the educators of this district and I include teachers and paraprofessionals and support staff and everyone else who populates our school communities day in and day out.

1106
01:47:02,493 --> 01:47:05,275
[SPEAKER_14]: They are the reason that this community has made it through the pandemic.

1107
01:47:06,195 --> 01:47:12,960
[SPEAKER_14]: And they are the reason that we are situated as well as we are to try to continue to serve students in the years ahead.

1108
01:47:14,582 --> 01:47:19,084
[SPEAKER_14]: But that doesn't mean information that's being shared is accurate.

1109
01:47:19,744 --> 01:47:20,925
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't mean that it's truthful.

1110
01:47:21,785 --> 01:47:24,987
[SPEAKER_14]: And it does mean, I think, that we have a responsibility to correct it.

1111
01:47:25,047 --> 01:47:34,851
[SPEAKER_14]: And so with respect to my friend who said that we were relying too much on facts and the law, I would say that I've had the privilege to serve this community for two and a half years.

1112
01:47:35,931 --> 01:47:38,012
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've found the people of this community to be smart.

1113
01:47:39,213 --> 01:47:40,253
[SPEAKER_14]: I've found them to listen.

1114
01:47:41,394 --> 01:47:44,155
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've found them to be respectful of accurate information.

1115
01:47:45,319 --> 01:48:05,256
[SPEAKER_14]: And I am confident that regardless of whatever other types of appeals are made to the people of this community, that the people of the community, as well as its elected leaders, and I do include the 70 of you in that, will continue to be cognizant of the implications of the decisions that you have to make.

1116
01:48:06,056 --> 01:48:09,960
[SPEAKER_14]: And so with that, I'm gonna walk you through a few things on this presentation.

1117
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,521
[SPEAKER_14]: If we can go to the slides, Dr. Cushing.

1118
01:48:16,305 --> 01:48:16,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.

1119
01:48:16,785 --> 01:48:18,926
[SPEAKER_14]: So then you've seen this stuff first.

1120
01:48:18,966 --> 01:48:20,307
[SPEAKER_14]: The first table there is just an update.

1121
01:48:20,327 --> 01:48:22,267
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's where we are with respect to our negotiations.

1122
01:48:22,327 --> 01:48:29,750
[SPEAKER_14]: There's very little change from when I updated you on October 17th with the very notable exception of where we are with respect to the teachers.

1123
01:48:30,551 --> 01:48:31,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Then we'll move on.

1124
01:48:33,479 --> 01:48:45,163
[SPEAKER_14]: And then in the second table, what you see here are the financials for the tentative agreement that was reached on October 13th.

1125
01:48:46,044 --> 01:48:49,325
[SPEAKER_14]: And the district, as you know, fulfilled our legal obligation.

1126
01:48:50,305 --> 01:48:56,709
[SPEAKER_14]: to support that agreement, to advocate for that agreement, and to urge your approval of that agreement.

1127
01:48:57,470 --> 01:49:05,415
[SPEAKER_14]: And just with respect to the specifics, that's 2.5% a year per fiscal year, with 1% on the final day of the final fiscal year.

1128
01:49:06,355 --> 01:49:22,714
[SPEAKER_14]: And then as we go to the next slide, as you've heard me say many times that for purposes of this discussion and wanting to essentially be efficient, we haven't gotten too much into, and I'll just say really quickly for those watching along, these are documents that are available on our website, as all the documents that are shared with the school committee are.

1129
01:49:24,716 --> 01:49:34,659
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand it's very small print, and we're going to move fast, but the purpose of this is for those that are talking about listening to this presentation in the days ahead.

1130
01:49:35,380 --> 01:49:39,561
[SPEAKER_14]: These are resources that you can go back to, and we hope that you enjoy it when you do.

1131
01:49:40,361 --> 01:49:49,965
[SPEAKER_14]: So the purpose of that first table at the top is to demonstrate that the tentative agreement that was reached

1132
01:49:51,408 --> 01:50:01,255
[SPEAKER_14]: is a more favorable agreement from the employer's perspective than the previous collective bargaining agreements going back over a decade.

1133
01:50:03,336 --> 01:50:11,961
[SPEAKER_14]: To be clear, there is no one suggesting that this is what teachers in society should be paid.

1134
01:50:13,703 --> 01:50:15,544
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, you've heard me say many times

1135
01:50:16,704 --> 01:50:24,102
[SPEAKER_14]: Most of us who have decided that this is how we're going to spend our professional lives think that education is pretty important.

1136
01:50:25,239 --> 01:50:35,607
[SPEAKER_14]: Most of us believe that for a community like Medford, its future is going to be defined by the investment that you as a community make in public education.

1137
01:50:36,327 --> 01:50:48,016
[SPEAKER_14]: And part of making an investment in public education is making sure that educators receive a competitive and a sustainable wage increase.

1138
01:50:49,898 --> 01:50:50,979
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's also true

1139
01:50:52,298 --> 01:51:08,883
[SPEAKER_14]: that given the circumstances under which we are operating and have operated under for some time, now is the time that educators should receive a more competitive increase than they have previously.

1140
01:51:09,683 --> 01:51:14,105
[SPEAKER_14]: That is a premise that we began the negotiation with.

1141
01:51:15,165 --> 01:51:20,167
[SPEAKER_14]: It is a premise that we shared with the teachers union routinely.

1142
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:27,786
[SPEAKER_14]: And by shared, I mean we certainly share the sentiment, more than share the sentiment, but we communicated that routinely.

1143
01:51:28,827 --> 01:51:39,117
[SPEAKER_14]: When members of the Teachers Union bargaining team were taking to social media and saying that we were disrespecting them and that we did not value them,

1144
01:51:41,474 --> 01:51:52,918
[SPEAKER_14]: At the same time that that was happening, we were having conversations with their leadership, telling them that we understood the need for a more competitive wage increase.

1145
01:51:53,699 --> 01:51:57,580
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not to say that this is the morally correct number.

1146
01:51:57,860 --> 01:52:00,021
[SPEAKER_14]: There is no morally correct number.

1147
01:52:01,122 --> 01:52:09,825
[SPEAKER_14]: But to suggest that it is somehow less than, that it is not competitive, or that it is disrespectful

1148
01:52:11,300 --> 01:52:15,003
[SPEAKER_14]: is an assertion that I do not believe is supported by the facts.

1149
01:52:16,184 --> 01:52:20,047
[SPEAKER_14]: And the facts are that this is the history of the increase.

1150
01:52:22,209 --> 01:52:39,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Rodness, one of the teachers from the high school, stood at this podium some time ago and relayed that on his commute, there were no fewer than seven communities in which their teachers were paid more.

1151
01:52:42,418 --> 01:52:43,839
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a disturbing assertion.

1152
01:52:44,859 --> 01:52:59,285
[SPEAKER_14]: It's one that prompted us to do an analysis of the region in general and of the districts that, under the state's framework, we are most similar to with respect to socioeconomic demographics, size, and funding, and whatnot.

1153
01:53:00,505 --> 01:53:07,988
[SPEAKER_14]: And the assertion that Medford pays less than districts is not true, nor should it be.

1154
01:53:09,321 --> 01:53:29,706
[SPEAKER_14]: Any education finance administrator who comes up and seeks accolades for keeping teacher wages as low as humanly possible is not someone who's going to contribute to what's happening in the classroom, and it's not someone that's going to help move a district forward with respect to the quality of the education being offered in that district.

1155
01:53:30,919 --> 01:53:34,363
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I want to be clear, I'm glad that it's not true.

1156
01:53:35,064 --> 01:53:48,239
[SPEAKER_14]: And the people of Medford, even those who are not directly connected to the school system and who wonder why so much of their tax dollars have to go into our public school system that they never stepped foot in and that they have no direct connection to, even those members of the community.

1157
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:57,425
[SPEAKER_14]: who are just as much a member of your constituents as everyone else, the people who follow it more closely because they're more directly connected, they should be grateful.

1158
01:53:57,685 --> 01:54:04,469
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know with certainty that many are, that educators in Medford are paid a competitive wage.

1159
01:54:05,350 --> 01:54:11,573
[SPEAKER_14]: And under the agreement that was reached on October 13th, they would continue to be paid a competitive wage.

1160
01:54:12,113 --> 01:54:15,736
[SPEAKER_14]: So much so that at the meeting in which the agreement was signed,

1161
01:54:16,656 --> 01:54:38,016
[SPEAKER_14]: While the teacher union leadership and the state representative from the Massachusetts Teacher Association did not agree with the premise that, frankly, we didn't spend a lot of time showing the documentation that proved that our teachers are paid a competitive wage, they agreed at the time that, quote, now they will be.

1162
01:54:39,125 --> 01:54:47,798
[SPEAKER_14]: as in upon implementation of this agreement that was reached on October 13th, the teachers would be paid in a competitive way.

1163
01:54:48,059 --> 01:54:51,624
[SPEAKER_14]: To be clear, if we're actually talking about facts,

1164
01:54:52,847 --> 01:54:54,268
[SPEAKER_14]: the competitive wage is already there.

1165
01:54:54,709 --> 01:55:00,194
[SPEAKER_14]: But as is the case with every, the nature of competition, you have to keep moving the needle forward.

1166
01:55:00,234 --> 01:55:01,856
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to keep building that momentum.

1167
01:55:02,596 --> 01:55:04,799
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not okay to just have stagnant wages.

1168
01:55:04,899 --> 01:55:10,324
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to be competitive or you will not be able to recruit and retain the talent that the students of Bedford deserve.

1169
01:55:11,205 --> 01:55:17,371
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is why it was a priority from the very beginning for us to institute a competitive but sustainable wage increase.

1170
01:55:19,343 --> 01:55:20,623
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's enough for those tables.

1171
01:55:20,663 --> 01:55:24,064
[SPEAKER_14]: Excuse me, actually, if I could just point out at the bottom, I apologize, Dr. Cushing.

1172
01:55:26,844 --> 01:55:46,628
[SPEAKER_14]: The crux of the disagreement now, after the union's failure to ratify the October 13th agreement, is that the union has put forth what it has dubbed a proposal, and they have identified it as cost neutral.

1173
01:55:48,982 --> 01:55:57,193
[SPEAKER_14]: If it were a cost-neutral option, frankly, I don't know that we'd have a lot to talk about because there's an eagerness, I think, on everyone's part to bring this to a conclusion.

1174
01:55:59,697 --> 01:56:04,464
[SPEAKER_14]: Mathematically speaking, it is not a cost-neutral option.

1175
01:56:05,407 --> 01:56:09,929
[SPEAKER_14]: to move a wage increase up in time adds a compounding element.

1176
01:56:10,730 --> 01:56:20,554
[SPEAKER_14]: And as I said before, we haven't frankly talked about the specifics of interest because one, we're trying to keep everyone awake in these meetings, and two, we're trying to keep it moving forward.

1177
01:56:21,234 --> 01:56:30,939
[SPEAKER_14]: But where we refer to 7.5% in over a three-year period in the tentative agreement, it's actually technically a 7.69% increase.

1178
01:56:33,649 --> 01:56:51,974
[SPEAKER_14]: To move what is in effect an FY25 increase that would be instituted under the tentative agreement on the final day of FY24 up in time as the union has proposed, and as they have spoken about publicly, brings that increase to 8.74%.

1179
01:56:52,014 --> 01:56:52,554
[SPEAKER_14]: 8.74% is more than 7.69%.

1180
01:56:52,594 --> 01:56:55,014
[SPEAKER_14]: And when you look at that from a citywide perspective,

1181
01:57:02,665 --> 01:57:04,686
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not just the principle that's violated.

1182
01:57:05,306 --> 01:57:08,688
[SPEAKER_14]: It is a dollars and cents issue that it becomes unsustainable.

1183
01:57:11,069 --> 01:57:11,909
[SPEAKER_14]: We can move to the next one.

1184
01:57:14,410 --> 01:57:22,754
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to talk briefly about the timeline of this negotiation, but I'm going to spare you these first two slides because you've already seen them several times.

1185
01:57:23,875 --> 01:57:29,277
[SPEAKER_14]: We started in June of 2021, and then we negotiated for a while.

1186
01:57:29,297 --> 01:57:31,458
[SPEAKER_14]: Why don't we go to part three?

1187
01:57:34,209 --> 01:57:36,531
[SPEAKER_14]: will pick up our history in the beginning of October.

1188
01:57:38,232 --> 01:57:53,103
[SPEAKER_14]: October 4th, the Department of Labor Relations informed the teachers union in the district that parties would essentially be given a month before a mediator was appointed to help resolve the stalemate.

1189
01:57:55,785 --> 01:57:59,308
[SPEAKER_14]: At that point over the course of the next week, the dialogue picked up considerably.

1190
01:58:00,697 --> 01:58:10,197
[SPEAKER_14]: And while I'm not going to go into every single blow by blow specific as to what was happening at the bargaining table, I will say there was a third party who intervened and functioned as a mediator.

1191
01:58:11,199 --> 01:58:11,640
[SPEAKER_14]: The district

1192
01:58:12,219 --> 01:58:15,621
[SPEAKER_14]: had said at the end of August that we felt a mediator was necessary.

1193
01:58:15,641 --> 01:58:17,122
[SPEAKER_14]: The union objected.

1194
01:58:17,142 --> 01:58:23,826
[SPEAKER_14]: This did, in fact, slow the timeline down because there was a need for the parties to stake out their positions with the Department of Labor Relations.

1195
01:58:24,627 --> 01:58:30,611
[SPEAKER_14]: And then immediately after being given a timeline before the mediator would be appointed,

1196
01:58:31,351 --> 01:58:42,896
[SPEAKER_14]: the parties found themselves as part of a three-part dialogue in which a mediator was helpful and provided assistance in helping to facilitate the dialogue.

1197
01:58:43,576 --> 01:58:47,958
[SPEAKER_14]: That led to the tentative agreement that was reached and signed on October 13th.

1198
01:58:50,540 --> 01:58:59,524
[SPEAKER_14]: As I said, I briefed you on October 17th, and then the Teachers Union took a vote to ratify, which failed to pass, on October 24th.

1199
01:59:01,494 --> 01:59:06,836
[SPEAKER_14]: On October 25th, the district contacted the MTA leadership.

1200
01:59:08,656 --> 01:59:19,760
[SPEAKER_14]: We had been told through various sources that the vote was close, and so the reasonable question seemed to be, do you plan to vote again, and is there something we can do to help facilitate that?

1201
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:26,982
[SPEAKER_14]: The union responded immediately that yes, they did want to vote again, and that the issue that needed to be discussed

1202
01:59:27,967 --> 01:59:41,293
[SPEAKER_14]: was the elementary release time, which as you know, has been discussed publicly, including initially when it was introduced into the public sphere in June of 2022 by representatives from the teachers union.

1203
01:59:44,754 --> 01:59:54,819
[SPEAKER_14]: Over the next week or two, the district met with the teachers union to identify clarifying language

1204
01:59:56,001 --> 02:00:01,888
[SPEAKER_14]: And I received some correspondence from teachers saying that this wouldn't have been a problem had we provided better language to begin with.

1205
02:00:02,789 --> 02:00:11,120
[SPEAKER_14]: And all I can say to that is there were two parties at the bargaining table, and the language that was originally sent for a vote of ratification did not come from the district.

1206
02:00:12,912 --> 02:00:20,058
[SPEAKER_14]: We then worked on that language and we clarified it, and it was a productive dialogue, and Ms.

1207
02:00:20,078 --> 02:00:39,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Galuzzi, as our resident expert in elementary matters, joined me in a few different conversations, some of which slightly late at night, with the teachers union to try to iron out specifics that would position the union to do as they said they wanted to do, which was to take a vote to ratify.

1208
02:00:41,058 --> 02:00:51,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Initially, during that window of time, the Teachers Union leadership communicated to the district that they understood that we would not be revisiting the financial package that had been agreed to.

1209
02:00:52,661 --> 02:00:56,521
[SPEAKER_14]: They stated that they felt it was a good financial package.

1210
02:00:57,202 --> 02:01:07,664
[SPEAKER_14]: They stated repeatedly that they had met their obligation willingly to enthusiastically support the agreement that had been reached.

1211
02:01:11,394 --> 02:01:17,538
[SPEAKER_14]: We then finalized language that they said they were comfortable with respect to the elementary issue.

1212
02:01:18,679 --> 02:01:32,629
[SPEAKER_14]: And upon completing that language, they completed a transition that admittedly began during that two-week window in which they first said that they understood the financial package would not be revisited.

1213
02:01:33,697 --> 02:01:42,683
[SPEAKER_14]: They then said that they just wanted us to know that some individuals were not happy with the financial package, to which the district responded that that was true for every negotiation in the history of time.

1214
02:01:42,743 --> 02:01:46,285
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think there's ever been one that was completed and everyone agreed that it was perfect.

1215
02:01:46,966 --> 02:01:49,788
[SPEAKER_14]: They then said that they might have to revisit the financial package.

1216
02:01:50,608 --> 02:02:02,356
[SPEAKER_14]: And then finally, at the conclusion of the two-week window, they demanded to revisit the financial package and submitted the quote, unquote, cost-neutral option that I referenced earlier.

1217
02:02:04,991 --> 02:02:06,112
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we can go to part four now.

1218
02:02:07,953 --> 02:02:34,433
[SPEAKER_14]: And this brings us up to the last week, which, as I said at the beginning, as a general rule, I prefer to not go over every single detail, but at some point when public buildings are being blocked with rallies and information is being disseminated in every medium available, again, I think we have an obligation to explain to the community what actually happened.

1219
02:02:36,090 --> 02:02:50,616
[SPEAKER_14]: On November 29th, last week, I think that was Tuesday, the union leadership announced to their members that they would be delivering a vote of no confidence.

1220
02:02:52,516 --> 02:02:54,257
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't say I really know who it was directed at.

1221
02:02:54,357 --> 02:03:02,340
[SPEAKER_14]: I assume the mayor and perhaps all of you and maybe myself and the superintendent, I don't know, but maybe they can come in and clarify sometime.

1222
02:03:05,319 --> 02:03:10,402
[SPEAKER_14]: They wanted everyone to know that there would be a rally on the steps of City Hall before your meeting.

1223
02:03:12,683 --> 02:03:26,090
[SPEAKER_14]: The following day, after announcing to the 500 members that they would declare no confidence in the people that they were attempting to negotiate and had already reached a tentative agreement with, they asked for a meeting.

1224
02:03:27,571 --> 02:03:34,095
[SPEAKER_14]: The mayor, along with myself and the superintendent, responded in under 24 hours that we would agree to meet,

1225
02:03:34,980 --> 02:03:40,662
[SPEAKER_14]: We thought it was important to meet, and we gave a list of days and times that the union could choose from.

1226
02:03:40,682 --> 02:03:43,942
[SPEAKER_14]: The union chose December 7th.

1227
02:03:45,623 --> 02:04:00,607
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I will say, I inferred from the request to meet that came in after the announcement of no confidence that

1228
02:04:03,922 --> 02:04:08,203
[SPEAKER_14]: we were gonna have an opportunity to have a conversation and that we were gonna have a dialogue.

1229
02:04:10,204 --> 02:04:32,490
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I was surprised at 843 on Saturday night when the union asked to move the meeting up to Sunday night, almost as if there was a desire for some type of pretextual meeting before the delivery of the aforementioned no confidence vote.

1230
02:04:34,474 --> 02:04:36,875
[SPEAKER_14]: On Sunday morning, the superintendent, the mayor, and I had a conference call.

1231
02:04:38,235 --> 02:04:40,876
[SPEAKER_14]: I imagine the superintendent and mayor were engaged in family activities.

1232
02:04:41,116 --> 02:04:45,037
[SPEAKER_14]: I missed the first period of a 10-year-old's hockey game on that conference call.

1233
02:04:45,838 --> 02:04:48,639
[SPEAKER_14]: And I imagine the mayor and the superintendent had a few things going on in their lives as well.

1234
02:04:50,519 --> 02:04:59,462
[SPEAKER_14]: And we discussed, can we rearrange everything that we're doing to have a meeting on Sunday night that Ms.

1235
02:04:59,482 --> 02:05:01,303
[SPEAKER_14]: Douglas requested at 843 on Saturday night?

1236
02:05:04,352 --> 02:05:15,719
[SPEAKER_14]: And we decided that we couldn't, but we certainly wanted to hear the union president out, and so the mayor agreed that there would be a phone conversation on Monday morning.

1237
02:05:17,319 --> 02:05:19,100
[SPEAKER_14]: The mayor can certainly relay the details of that.

1238
02:05:19,381 --> 02:05:21,482
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not a lot, because it was a fairly short call, as I understand it.

1239
02:05:22,462 --> 02:05:28,466
[SPEAKER_14]: But the call was to inform the mayor that the union had declared no confidence.

1240
02:05:30,455 --> 02:05:35,016
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to talk a little bit about the implications of a no-confidence vote.

1241
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:51,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dr. Kushner.

1242
02:05:56,261 --> 02:06:00,062
[SPEAKER_14]: And so now we have two meetings scheduled.

1243
02:06:01,121 --> 02:06:18,645
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a meeting on December 7th in which we will continue to bring this process to a conclusion so that the competitive and sustainable wage increase that we've negotiated can be implemented as quickly as possible.

1244
02:06:21,294 --> 02:06:36,199
[SPEAKER_14]: With respect to the reforms that were negotiated, as the committee knows, the primary reform that we were initially told was the hang up with regard to the length of the elementary school day, we've already agreed that that won't be implemented this year.

1245
02:06:37,799 --> 02:06:44,641
[SPEAKER_14]: So the reforms that the district had prioritized in the course of this process have now either been dropped or delayed.

1246
02:06:48,903 --> 02:06:49,023
[SPEAKER_14]: And

1247
02:06:50,302 --> 02:07:08,535
[SPEAKER_14]: With respect to the financial compensation, I know one of the talking points that's been circulated is that we are threatening to pull back on the one-time payments totaling $4,500 per teacher if an agreement is not reached.

1248
02:07:09,416 --> 02:07:15,000
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I don't think we need any more slides, Dr. Cushman, but I'll just speak very briefly about that and then I'm happy to take your questions.

1249
02:07:19,835 --> 02:07:30,925
[SPEAKER_14]: $1,500 per year, per fiscal year, one-time payments, that's the non-based pay compensation, is made possible through the grant funding that the district and other districts have.

1250
02:07:31,206 --> 02:07:33,208
[SPEAKER_14]: We refer to it typically as ESSER funding.

1251
02:07:34,108 --> 02:07:35,570
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's time-sensitive funding.

1252
02:07:35,890 --> 02:07:43,998
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's a date, there's two different buckets, and one ends at the end of, or in the first quarter of the next fiscal year, and one ends in the first quarter of the following fiscal year.

1253
02:07:45,545 --> 02:07:53,176
[SPEAKER_14]: And based on the agreements, it's about $2 million that we've tied up in the hope of paying these one-time payments.

1254
02:07:53,717 --> 02:08:00,687
[SPEAKER_14]: I said at the beginning, given the circumstances and the context in which we're negotiating, in which we're operating, there's widespread agreement.

1255
02:08:01,368 --> 02:08:05,552
[SPEAKER_14]: that this should be a highly favorable agreement for teachers.

1256
02:08:06,113 --> 02:08:19,046
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a need to recognize the sacrifice, there's a need to recognize the hard work, there's a need to recognize the debt that we owe educators generally and educators in Medford specifically.

1257
02:08:20,233 --> 02:08:24,137
[SPEAKER_14]: But there's also a need to do that in a fiscally sustainable way.

1258
02:08:24,838 --> 02:08:31,145
[SPEAKER_14]: And so from the very beginning, we've communicated that while we intend to use these resources,

1259
02:08:32,799 --> 02:08:43,349
[SPEAKER_14]: to supplement the base pay increase of teachers, it's also true that we can't just sit on a bucket of money that is going to go away eventually.

1260
02:08:43,930 --> 02:08:48,334
[SPEAKER_14]: And it is not a matter of if we don't have an agreement in the next week, the money has to go away.

1261
02:08:48,734 --> 02:08:56,421
[SPEAKER_14]: It is a matter that if we're not going to spend it as we would prefer, supplementing teacher pay, then we have to plan for its responsible use.

1262
02:08:57,302 --> 02:09:21,860
[SPEAKER_14]: And in the absence of a thoughtful strategic plan that we develop as to how that money will be used this spring during school breaks, things like acceleration academies, this coming summer, things like Camp Mustang version 17, whatever we're up to at this point, to support student social emotional growth, or whatever else, after school programs, tutoring programs, all the things that we've discussed with you each time we presented on the ESSER budget, all of it has been on hold.

1263
02:09:22,677 --> 02:09:27,801
[SPEAKER_14]: because we don't know what the number is going to be in order to supplement teacher pay the way that we want.

1264
02:09:28,682 --> 02:09:40,811
[SPEAKER_14]: And so the reason that we have communicated that at some point that money has to start, we have to start to adjust those numbers, is that if we don't thoughtfully plan for it, we're going to have the equivalent of a financial bonfire

1265
02:09:41,923 --> 02:09:45,484
[SPEAKER_14]: this summer, and then it's not gonna be of use to anyone.

1266
02:09:45,944 --> 02:09:50,026
[SPEAKER_14]: Teachers will continue to not be paid what we would all prefer that they be paid.

1267
02:09:50,546 --> 02:09:59,849
[SPEAKER_14]: Students will not receive the type of targeted supports that we can provide if we have enough time to thoughtfully plan these things out.

1268
02:10:00,549 --> 02:10:02,410
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that is why it's time sensitive.

1269
02:10:02,510 --> 02:10:07,412
[SPEAKER_14]: In addition, frankly, we really wanted to provide the compensation before the holiday break.

1270
02:10:08,496 --> 02:10:09,817
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why we did that.

1271
02:10:10,217 --> 02:10:11,397
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not a scare tactic.

1272
02:10:11,457 --> 02:10:13,018
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not an attempt to intimidate anyone.

1273
02:10:13,538 --> 02:10:16,919
[SPEAKER_14]: It is just the reality of the calendar.

1274
02:10:17,600 --> 02:10:29,424
[SPEAKER_14]: And we can't rush through pay increases, and we can't rush through programming and design initiatives, because all of a sudden, we have $2 million more than we were anticipating having.

1275
02:10:31,645 --> 02:10:33,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Just one final thought.

1276
02:10:34,380 --> 02:10:38,181
[SPEAKER_14]: We know that the vote to ratify failed by 17 votes.

1277
02:10:39,861 --> 02:10:49,524
[SPEAKER_14]: We know that there was this issue that needed further clarification that I'd like to think that we've now provided based on several meetings over the last month on the elementary release time.

1278
02:10:51,905 --> 02:11:02,748
[SPEAKER_14]: According to the communication that we received within the last day, the no confidence vote, and it's not entirely clear how or when that was declared, was at 94%.

1279
02:11:05,239 --> 02:11:29,389
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I would say to the union leadership that has claimed that they supported the TA and they tried to get it passed, that has also now apparently led in the direction that we were 17 votes from ratification and now we're at a 94% rate of no confidence, that we will continue this dialogue and we'll continue this conversation

1280
02:11:30,720 --> 02:11:37,922
[SPEAKER_14]: And we will be as constructive as we can and we'll be as creative as we can, but we will not be financially reckless.

1281
02:11:39,063 --> 02:11:54,928
[SPEAKER_14]: No matter how many rallies there are, how much information is put on social media, how many vague personal threats are alluded to, how many times they reference the political cycle or the calendar,

1282
02:11:57,805 --> 02:12:05,271
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to continue to act in a way that we believe is responsible for the interests of the district and its future.

1283
02:12:06,252 --> 02:12:08,714
[SPEAKER_14]: And it is my sincere hope that they will join us in that effort.

1284
02:12:09,574 --> 02:12:10,615
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm happy to take your questions.

1285
02:12:14,258 --> 02:12:14,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1286
02:12:15,019 --> 02:12:19,162
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if there's any questions from the committee.

1287
02:12:19,382 --> 02:12:21,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Rousseau?

1288
02:12:22,304 --> 02:12:22,604
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1289
02:12:23,553 --> 02:12:33,644
[SPEAKER_15]: As always, I'd like to make a motion going forward during any bargaining sessions that a minimum of one school committee member will be present.

1290
02:12:36,027 --> 02:12:43,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion on the floor by Member Rousseau that one school committee member be present at any negotiating sessions, seconded by

1291
02:12:46,778 --> 02:12:48,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Second, member Graham.

1292
02:12:48,719 --> 02:13:03,366
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor, if I could just say, the administration would welcome that, and certainly try to keep you as informed as possible, but I think given that, to the best of my knowledge, no one is claiming that there are any issues remaining with the exception of the finances.

1293
02:13:03,426 --> 02:13:10,469
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that, I think it's more, it's helpful to have representatives of the governing body there, and so.

1294
02:13:12,341 --> 02:13:20,106
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't promise it will be fun, but I certainly will let you know that you'll be more than welcome to join us.

1295
02:13:20,126 --> 02:13:23,128
[SPEAKER_11]: Is real call or all those in favor aye.

1296
02:13:23,629 --> 02:13:26,030
[SPEAKER_11]: I was opposed motion passes.

1297
02:13:28,052 --> 02:13:31,154
[SPEAKER_09]: If I if I may from me and the chair member of the nation.

1298
02:13:31,334 --> 02:13:32,935
[SPEAKER_09]: How is it how is that being chosen.

1299
02:13:35,302 --> 02:13:47,915
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, honestly, I think it's going to, I prefer to depend on the specifics and logistics because what I don't want to do is if we have an opportunity to make a mediator, have to wait for a designated member to be available.

1300
02:13:47,955 --> 02:13:52,220
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think we'll continue to keep you all fully updated and informed.

1301
02:13:53,421 --> 02:13:56,164
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think, you know, frankly, at this point, the mayor,

1302
02:13:57,797 --> 02:13:59,238
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, just back up for one second, if I could, Ms.

1303
02:13:59,258 --> 02:13:59,698
[SPEAKER_14]: McLaughlin.

1304
02:14:00,239 --> 02:14:03,500
[SPEAKER_14]: You just, you opened the door for something that I do wanna clarify.

1305
02:14:04,241 --> 02:14:20,630
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the assertions that has been made, and I, having served in a similar capacity that you do now, I can understand the frustration that some of you may feel when this misinformation is shared, is that the committee has been disengaged.

1306
02:14:21,430 --> 02:14:23,772
[SPEAKER_14]: And I will say that

1307
02:14:25,563 --> 02:14:33,007
[SPEAKER_14]: If there's one thing I'll say about the Medford School Committee, it is that you are not disengaged by any stretch of the imagination.

1308
02:14:33,908 --> 02:14:37,529
[SPEAKER_14]: And I mean that as praise.

1309
02:14:38,632 --> 02:14:46,495
[SPEAKER_14]: because I've worked with many, I've served on one, and I've frankly never really seen a committee as engaged as the seven of you.

1310
02:14:47,035 --> 02:14:50,336
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think we as a school district are better off and you as a community are better off for it.

1311
02:14:50,997 --> 02:15:02,341
[SPEAKER_14]: But in addition to meeting on a regular basis, in addition to asking questions on a regular basis, in addition to having frequent executive sessions in which we engage in dialogue and you set the agenda and you set the goals and you gave us our parameters to negotiate under,

1312
02:15:03,521 --> 02:15:03,721
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

1313
02:15:03,741 --> 02:15:08,623
[SPEAKER_14]: Graham as the vice chair and the mayor have attended multiple meetings with the union leadership.

1314
02:15:09,463 --> 02:15:17,226
[SPEAKER_14]: And the suggestion that somehow the mayor or the committee have not been involved in this process is completely inaccurate.

1315
02:15:17,506 --> 02:15:18,686
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not fair to any of you.

1316
02:15:19,266 --> 02:15:23,468
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's not fair to the members of the community who are receiving that type of misinformation.

1317
02:15:23,928 --> 02:15:29,990
[SPEAKER_14]: But with respect to going forward, what I would say is I think we'll continue to keep you informed.

1318
02:15:32,073 --> 02:15:43,197
[SPEAKER_14]: The mayor, by the nature of her role, is gonna need to be present, frankly, more often than I think the people of the city would prefer, given the other tasks that she has to do.

1319
02:15:44,858 --> 02:15:46,439
[SPEAKER_14]: But we'll make sure that you're informed.

1320
02:15:46,479 --> 02:15:53,041
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, there's not really a myriad of issues to discuss, but if there is something that we tell you you're gonna discuss and one of you wants to attend, then by all means.

1321
02:15:57,683 --> 02:16:00,704
[SPEAKER_11]: If I may, from the chair, I don't wanna be repetitive in any way,

1322
02:16:01,263 --> 02:16:11,668
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe just speak a couple minutes because I know Mr. Murphy, Dr. Edward Vincent, we were working all through the weekend on this.

1323
02:16:12,008 --> 02:16:16,250
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know the committee has been inundated with emails.

1324
02:16:18,672 --> 02:16:26,120
[SPEAKER_11]: I know they're hard to read, and I myself, I felt as mayor, I did need to respond.

1325
02:16:26,240 --> 02:16:37,652
[SPEAKER_11]: So the number that came from Pennsylvania or California or Arizona, obviously I did not respond to, but I did take the time one morning, 5 to 7, 7.30, and this morning at 4 to respond to

1326
02:16:40,334 --> 02:16:42,796
[SPEAKER_11]: several hundred emails, and it was very simple.

1327
02:16:42,816 --> 02:16:55,465
[SPEAKER_11]: I stated that, of course, this committee, as well as the city and school staff, I said, we aimed to do what's right, because I think that was part of the email.

1328
02:16:56,366 --> 02:16:56,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Do what's right.

1329
02:16:57,346 --> 02:16:58,847
[SPEAKER_11]: We always aim to do what's right.

1330
02:17:00,028 --> 02:17:03,831
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's how we did get to a signed tentative agreement.

1331
02:17:05,111 --> 02:17:10,875
[SPEAKER_11]: The union leadership, our administration, with the vote of the council, got to a signed tentative agreement.

1332
02:17:11,255 --> 02:17:26,306
[SPEAKER_11]: That wasn't easy because, as you can see on the documentation, the average is 6.5 potentially on a three-year contract over the 10, 12 prior years, and we're at

1333
02:17:27,156 --> 02:17:29,558
[SPEAKER_11]: something and we saw what happened budget time.

1334
02:17:29,598 --> 02:17:36,041
[SPEAKER_11]: It was tough budget with the numbers of the average of 2% for most unions per year, sometimes a little bit more.

1335
02:17:38,463 --> 02:17:40,344
[SPEAKER_11]: We wanted to get this done so badly.

1336
02:17:40,564 --> 02:17:45,147
[SPEAKER_11]: We know our teachers, we all know our teachers deserve a fair salary.

1337
02:17:45,567 --> 02:17:48,689
[SPEAKER_11]: We wanted to bring them up over 90,000 average.

1338
02:17:48,909 --> 02:17:56,634
[SPEAKER_11]: This contract would bring our teachers up to an average of $93,000 a year plus bonus checks that we want to give our teachers.

1339
02:17:58,578 --> 02:18:15,249
[SPEAKER_11]: So I took the time to respond, and I did say that even though we have the tentative agreement, it was signed in October, that I was asked to have a meeting within 24 hours, like Mr. Murphy said.

1340
02:18:15,269 --> 02:18:17,971
[SPEAKER_11]: I gave my times and dates that I'm available this week.

1341
02:18:18,311 --> 02:18:22,334
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a meeting scheduled on the 7th, which is this Wednesday.

1342
02:18:23,275 --> 02:18:24,416
[SPEAKER_11]: When I did speak to Ms.

1343
02:18:24,436 --> 02:18:26,957
[SPEAKER_11]: Douglas this morning, I was a little heated.

1344
02:18:27,197 --> 02:18:32,599
[SPEAKER_11]: She mentioned, she called to let me know that there'll be no confidence vote against the school committee and myself.

1345
02:18:33,259 --> 02:18:35,681
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just don't think that's fair to the committee.

1346
02:18:35,701 --> 02:18:42,143
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's against me, that's one thing because in the email, it also mentioned be a leader.

1347
02:18:42,444 --> 02:18:43,484
[SPEAKER_11]: They want us to be leaders.

1348
02:18:44,144 --> 02:18:48,546
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just have to tell you as my colleagues that I do feel you are leaders.

1349
02:18:49,246 --> 02:18:52,508
[SPEAKER_11]: We are leaders together because we've stuck together to understand

1350
02:18:53,343 --> 02:18:55,506
[SPEAKER_11]: And you have the responsibility of the school committee.

1351
02:18:56,387 --> 02:19:03,536
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like I have been a leader as mayor because I have a lot to juggle as the schools, but also the city.

1352
02:19:04,136 --> 02:19:12,286
[SPEAKER_11]: We have almost 20 CBAs, 20 unions that we have negotiated with, are currently negotiating with, and need to continue to negotiate with.

1353
02:19:13,052 --> 02:19:18,197
[SPEAKER_11]: We have an annual budget that is maxed out, and we can get into that argument.

1354
02:19:18,717 --> 02:19:23,702
[SPEAKER_11]: Potentially, we will need an override, potentially, even just with 2% raises.

1355
02:19:24,122 --> 02:19:25,223
[SPEAKER_11]: But we went above and beyond.

1356
02:19:25,283 --> 02:19:26,865
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to get this done.

1357
02:19:30,868 --> 02:19:32,650
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's really hard.

1358
02:19:33,351 --> 02:19:37,094
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, as to get those emails and to know you're doing the right thing.

1359
02:19:37,114 --> 02:19:41,637
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've, we, we listened to, you know, the park, the needs of the parks at the schools.

1360
02:19:42,158 --> 02:19:50,764
[SPEAKER_11]: So, so as a leader of the community, not only worried about the 20 CBAs and keeping our personnel, um, getting cooler percentages each year,

1361
02:19:51,411 --> 02:19:53,913
[SPEAKER_11]: We have streets and sidewalks that are falling apart.

1362
02:19:54,093 --> 02:20:03,961
[SPEAKER_11]: We have parks that we are finally getting ahead of, not ahead, we finally have 50, 70 projects in the works, some complete, some we're working on.

1363
02:20:04,382 --> 02:20:09,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Four, including the McGlynn, or five large-scale park projects that we're working on.

1364
02:20:09,626 --> 02:20:11,928
[SPEAKER_11]: We have funding sources that we're being creative with.

1365
02:20:12,298 --> 02:20:15,339
[SPEAKER_11]: We have personnel issues that we're dealing with on a daily basis.

1366
02:20:15,759 --> 02:20:18,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Maurice, Dave, and I know that, and they're not fun.

1367
02:20:19,020 --> 02:20:22,522
[SPEAKER_11]: So a leader to me is what we have done.

1368
02:20:22,542 --> 02:20:30,784
[SPEAKER_11]: A leader to me is to say, Charlene, if you have to take a no-confidence vote, I can't lead this city into receivership.

1369
02:20:31,565 --> 02:20:41,048
[SPEAKER_11]: I have mayors who are colleagues that, you know, a lot of cities and towns are going through this, and they're dealing with the pressure

1370
02:20:41,860 --> 02:20:46,001
[SPEAKER_11]: And to a couple of them, I've said, how are you going to afford that?

1371
02:20:47,082 --> 02:20:52,684
[SPEAKER_11]: And in person, I've seen a couple of them and they say to me, I don't know.

1372
02:20:53,824 --> 02:20:54,124
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1373
02:20:54,164 --> 02:20:56,845
[SPEAKER_11]: I said, where are you going to cut?

1374
02:20:56,865 --> 02:20:59,466
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you going to fund something like that?

1375
02:20:59,686 --> 02:21:02,687
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've said to even one, I said, you have a responsibility.

1376
02:21:03,154 --> 02:21:10,997
[SPEAKER_11]: to the entire community, to the taxpayers, not just one union, you have responsibility to the entire community.

1377
02:21:12,337 --> 02:21:18,740
[SPEAKER_11]: So it is a struggle, there is pressure, we're all feeling it, but we are sticking together and I feel like we are being leaders.

1378
02:21:19,360 --> 02:21:26,803
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's unfortunate, from the very beginning, it was the narrative that was being portrayed as we're disrespectful, we're disrespectful.

1379
02:21:27,481 --> 02:21:35,507
[SPEAKER_11]: At one point, it was a few months in, and I said, I called Dave, Mr. Murphy right away, and I said, what was our first offer?

1380
02:21:35,547 --> 02:21:38,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Because all I keep hearing is we're disrespectful.

1381
02:21:38,529 --> 02:21:39,550
[SPEAKER_11]: What did you offer?

1382
02:21:39,570 --> 02:21:44,333
[SPEAKER_11]: And the answer was, well, the teachers are asking for 6% a year.

1383
02:21:45,689 --> 02:21:50,991
[SPEAKER_11]: So we offered, I forget exactly what it was, 1.5 to- To 1.75 and 1.5.

1384
02:21:51,331 --> 02:21:56,854
[SPEAKER_14]: It was communicated publicly that we offered the lowest proposal that had ever been shared.

1385
02:21:57,254 --> 02:22:00,515
[SPEAKER_14]: That was not true, but it was to 1.75 and 1.5.

1386
02:22:00,835 --> 02:22:08,818
[SPEAKER_14]: And as the mayor said, the reason for that, and this is spelled out in your materials, was that with the union coming in and asking for 18% over three years,

1387
02:22:10,805 --> 02:22:11,847
[SPEAKER_14]: We had two choices.

1388
02:22:12,468 --> 02:22:21,083
[SPEAKER_14]: We could offer something in the ballpark of we knew that we could afford, at which point we would then be stuck at that position over an extended period of time.

1389
02:22:22,026 --> 02:22:25,710
[SPEAKER_14]: and most likely be called disrespectful for not demonstrating movement.

1390
02:22:26,330 --> 02:22:34,678
[SPEAKER_14]: Or we could start very low, leave ourselves room for some movement, but understand that we would be accused of being disrespectful based on the initial offer.

1391
02:22:36,299 --> 02:22:40,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Frankly, we tried to take a middle approach.

1392
02:22:40,183 --> 02:22:46,629
[SPEAKER_14]: We did 2175, 1.5, and communicated regularly with the union leadership

1393
02:22:47,967 --> 02:22:49,971
[SPEAKER_14]: that this was just an initial offer.

1394
02:22:50,873 --> 02:22:57,766
[SPEAKER_14]: That offer was weaponized against us, and it began the narrative of how disrespectful we are.

1395
02:22:58,287 --> 02:22:59,149
[SPEAKER_14]: And to be clear,

1396
02:23:00,737 --> 02:23:15,686
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, you're never gonna get to a place where you are demonstrating sufficient support for the individuals who, as to a person and as a community, a community of educators, are responsible for delivering what these people deliver day in and day out.

1397
02:23:15,986 --> 02:23:18,488
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't demonstrate too much respect, okay?

1398
02:23:18,928 --> 02:23:24,852
[SPEAKER_14]: All of us have teachers, some of whom, some of us were raised by some, who we know the impact that they have.

1399
02:23:24,952 --> 02:23:28,674
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're never gonna get to the point where you check a box and say, well, now we've respected teachers enough.

1400
02:23:28,774 --> 02:23:29,775
[SPEAKER_14]: It's never gonna happen.

1401
02:23:30,515 --> 02:23:32,596
[SPEAKER_14]: We are dependent upon them for our lives.

1402
02:23:33,236 --> 02:23:34,076
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the reality.

1403
02:23:34,136 --> 02:23:35,956
[SPEAKER_14]: And for those that are looking, Ms.

1404
02:23:35,976 --> 02:23:41,818
[SPEAKER_14]: Douglas and others who want to quote me on social media and try to weaponize that quote, by all means, I mean it, say it.

1405
02:23:42,318 --> 02:23:44,639
[SPEAKER_14]: Teachers are the reason we are here.

1406
02:23:45,039 --> 02:23:48,520
[SPEAKER_14]: They are the reason that some of us have been able to do with our lives what we want to do.

1407
02:23:49,520 --> 02:24:02,303
[SPEAKER_14]: But to make sure that that continues to be the case and to make sure that kids who have not come into the school system yet will be able to get the services that they need so that they can have a chance to have the lives that they need, we can't be reckless.

1408
02:24:03,323 --> 02:24:06,924
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to be responsible, even when that means being unpopular.

1409
02:24:07,484 --> 02:24:09,425
[SPEAKER_14]: So take as many no confidence votes as you want.

1410
02:24:09,945 --> 02:24:11,805
[SPEAKER_14]: Have as many rallies as you want.

1411
02:24:13,826 --> 02:24:14,506
[SPEAKER_14]: That's reality.

1412
02:24:15,717 --> 02:24:17,678
[SPEAKER_11]: And my point, thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1413
02:24:17,958 --> 02:24:26,781
[SPEAKER_11]: And my point is when I initially heard the offer and 6%, I said, you know, I went back and I said that it's not disrespect.

1414
02:24:27,322 --> 02:24:28,962
[SPEAKER_11]: To me, that's negotiations.

1415
02:24:29,022 --> 02:24:30,503
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how it works, back and forth.

1416
02:24:30,563 --> 02:24:32,364
[SPEAKER_11]: And you get to that number just like we did.

1417
02:24:32,704 --> 02:24:37,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Higher than I think we should be, but we're at 7.25 with 1% at the end of the year, plus three $1,500 bonuses.

1418
02:24:43,174 --> 02:24:44,234
[SPEAKER_14]: Could you say that again, though?

1419
02:24:44,334 --> 02:24:45,214
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, let me be clear.

1420
02:24:45,915 --> 02:24:48,535
[SPEAKER_14]: It's never going to be enough, OK?

1421
02:24:49,035 --> 02:24:51,316
[SPEAKER_14]: We're never going to say, well, now we've paid teachers enough.

1422
02:24:51,336 --> 02:24:52,936
[SPEAKER_14]: We're certainly never going to say we paid them too much.

1423
02:24:52,956 --> 02:24:54,516
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not possible, OK?

1424
02:24:55,036 --> 02:24:58,197
[SPEAKER_14]: Just like we were talking about the after school staff, OK?

1425
02:24:58,577 --> 02:24:59,557
[SPEAKER_14]: We raised our rates.

1426
02:25:00,257 --> 02:25:00,998
[SPEAKER_14]: People know that.

1427
02:25:01,378 --> 02:25:03,298
[SPEAKER_14]: We're competing against other communities.

1428
02:25:03,658 --> 02:25:06,479
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not surprising that they raised their rates as well, OK?

1429
02:25:06,799 --> 02:25:08,319
[SPEAKER_14]: You're never going to be able to pay enough.

1430
02:25:09,179 --> 02:25:12,940
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we never would ever, ever want to disrespect

1431
02:25:13,624 --> 02:25:14,485
[SPEAKER_11]: any of our teachers.

1432
02:25:14,765 --> 02:25:17,006
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't feel that we have.

1433
02:25:17,106 --> 02:25:27,013
[SPEAKER_11]: But the narrative got everybody so anxious and angry that we had to do something to calm it down.

1434
02:25:27,453 --> 02:25:28,234
[SPEAKER_11]: And we did.

1435
02:25:28,254 --> 02:25:30,415
[SPEAKER_11]: And we reached this tentative agreement.

1436
02:25:30,455 --> 02:25:32,637
[SPEAKER_11]: We had the union leadership sign.

1437
02:25:32,837 --> 02:25:33,297
[SPEAKER_11]: We did sign.

1438
02:25:35,373 --> 02:25:37,955
[SPEAKER_11]: could, for some reason it wasn't ratified.

1439
02:25:38,315 --> 02:25:39,316
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that was Ms.

1440
02:25:39,336 --> 02:25:42,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Douglas's job to get it ratified and it didn't, it didn't happen.

1441
02:25:42,698 --> 02:25:43,318
[SPEAKER_11]: So here we are.

1442
02:25:43,979 --> 02:25:48,001
[SPEAKER_11]: So we go and agree to a meeting on Wednesday, hoping to get it done.

1443
02:25:48,102 --> 02:25:52,665
[SPEAKER_11]: We also have mediation on the 20th, but instead what I told Ms.

1444
02:25:52,685 --> 02:26:00,049
[SPEAKER_11]: Douglas this morning, and I'll say it publicly is it was disingenuous to ask me for a meeting, which I agreed to.

1445
02:26:01,911 --> 02:26:05,193
[SPEAKER_11]: We have it scheduled and then to go back

1446
02:26:05,874 --> 02:26:10,379
[SPEAKER_11]: another rally, declare no confidence to rile the membership up again.

1447
02:26:11,340 --> 02:26:13,201
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, are we going to lead this to the spring?

1448
02:26:13,221 --> 02:26:14,443
[SPEAKER_11]: I sure hope not.

1449
02:26:15,324 --> 02:26:23,212
[SPEAKER_11]: But what I would ask is, could we, or would somebody propose that we take a vote to ask Ms.

1450
02:26:23,232 --> 02:26:24,333
[SPEAKER_11]: Douglas the same thing?

1451
02:26:25,494 --> 02:26:26,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Please do what's right.

1452
02:26:27,516 --> 02:26:28,337
[SPEAKER_11]: Please be a leader.

1453
02:26:29,164 --> 02:26:41,615
[SPEAKER_11]: Please bring this back to the membership in a meeting to do one thing, not to hear whatever he has to say, and then some people don't show up because they don't want to hear it, because there's many teachers not showing up.

1454
02:26:41,875 --> 02:26:42,956
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't want to be there.

1455
02:26:42,976 --> 02:26:43,777
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't want to deal with it.

1456
02:26:44,278 --> 02:26:46,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a meeting this week to just take a vote.

1457
02:26:47,821 --> 02:26:48,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Take a vote.

1458
02:26:49,302 --> 02:26:51,604
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody can take a little time and look at these slides.

1459
02:26:52,325 --> 02:26:52,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Take a vote.

1460
02:26:53,166 --> 02:26:54,647
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to get our teachers

1461
02:26:55,287 --> 02:26:58,070
[SPEAKER_11]: this average of 93,000 as soon as possible.

1462
02:26:58,190 --> 02:27:02,775
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to get them to two checks would be issued in the next several weeks.

1463
02:27:02,815 --> 02:27:06,860
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you'd start the process right away for $1,500 a piece.

1464
02:27:07,380 --> 02:27:10,824
[SPEAKER_11]: We agreed to move up the third payment to July one, I believe.

1465
02:27:12,695 --> 02:27:17,000
[SPEAKER_11]: We have made movements since the tentative agreement, because we are really trying to do this.

1466
02:27:18,282 --> 02:27:20,364
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to flesh that point out, though, Mayor, if I could really quickly.

1467
02:27:20,424 --> 02:27:33,679
[SPEAKER_14]: So, as I said, the tentative agreement that the union has, and I'm not entirely clear why, good question for them, have filed an unfair labor practice against us for acknowledging the tentative agreement.

1468
02:27:35,247 --> 02:27:41,931
[SPEAKER_14]: To be honest with you, that's a first I've never seen in a fair labor practice on the grounds that we're acknowledging a tentative agreement that the union president signed, but nevertheless.

1469
02:27:44,766 --> 02:27:46,747
[SPEAKER_14]: Our position is that this is a tentative agreement.

1470
02:27:47,848 --> 02:27:55,691
[SPEAKER_14]: With respect to its validity, I would point to the fact that we were told that they wanted to take another vote.

1471
02:27:56,392 --> 02:28:03,135
[SPEAKER_14]: We were told that this board is continuing to represent the MTA, so we continue to work with them.

1472
02:28:03,155 --> 02:28:11,479
[SPEAKER_14]: But what we've said is, in an attempt to be a partner, we've identified clarifying language that could be provided in a side letter

1473
02:28:12,711 --> 02:28:15,112
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what we were told that they wanted.

1474
02:28:16,672 --> 02:28:22,934
[SPEAKER_14]: And the moving up the one-time payments, just to be clear, we're not the base pay.

1475
02:28:23,474 --> 02:28:24,774
[SPEAKER_14]: That is what makes it unsustainable.

1476
02:28:25,175 --> 02:28:29,416
[SPEAKER_14]: But moving up the timeline on the one-time payments was designed to get teachers

1477
02:28:30,495 --> 02:28:38,740
[SPEAKER_14]: Many of whom, again, have been through a very challenging period, as many others have, to get that compensation as quickly as possible.

1478
02:28:38,860 --> 02:28:45,223
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, I think the discussion for the rest is really for the ongoing dialogue, which

1479
02:28:48,985 --> 02:28:53,149
[SPEAKER_14]: despite the declaration of no confidence is still scheduled for December 7th.

1480
02:28:53,369 --> 02:29:04,079
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to, in two days, we're going to, I don't, I'm a little confused because to be honest with you, I've never like had someone declare our team to be quote proven, proven ineffective.

1481
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:07,402
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, we negotiated, we came to an agreement.

1482
02:29:07,422 --> 02:29:15,008
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't totally understand the definition of proven ineffective, and I don't totally understand meeting with a group that you've decided you have no confidence in, but

1483
02:29:16,447 --> 02:29:18,009
[SPEAKER_14]: We're really just focused on trying to get it done.

1484
02:29:18,569 --> 02:29:23,333
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what the mayor is referencing is that clarifying points to try to expedite that.

1485
02:29:24,174 --> 02:29:28,638
[SPEAKER_11]: And if no confidence vote came after the meeting, that's one thing.

1486
02:29:29,038 --> 02:29:32,642
[SPEAKER_11]: But now it's the narrative that we're disrespecting them again.

1487
02:29:32,742 --> 02:29:40,528
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, I think it kills us all because you all have children in the schools or had children in the schools.

1488
02:29:41,389 --> 02:29:45,810
[SPEAKER_11]: These teachers have been and are my children's teachers.

1489
02:29:46,331 --> 02:29:53,993
[SPEAKER_11]: They're my children's, have been tutored by our wonderful teachers, have been coached by our teachers.

1490
02:29:54,433 --> 02:29:55,414
[SPEAKER_11]: They're my friends.

1491
02:29:56,374 --> 02:30:05,617
[SPEAKER_11]: My sister left the district recently, but they're family, some of whom won't even look at us, won't write recommendations for our kids.

1492
02:30:06,697 --> 02:30:08,638
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I can't talk personally about that,

1493
02:30:10,339 --> 02:30:17,885
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to be clear though, Mayor, I mean, as I've said before, the withholding of services typically rendered is a prohibited practice.

1494
02:30:18,725 --> 02:30:26,631
[SPEAKER_14]: In the communication that the union put out about the, quote, walk to rule, there was a vague reference to letters of recommendation.

1495
02:30:27,351 --> 02:30:39,080
[SPEAKER_14]: The district, keeping in mind the implications for our students, directly asked the union three times whether or not they were suggesting that they would refuse to do that, and the union never responded affirmatively.

1496
02:30:40,302 --> 02:30:41,303
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to be really clear.

1497
02:30:41,923 --> 02:30:55,291
[SPEAKER_14]: It is my sense and my experience being here now for some time, that the vast majority of teachers, and I want to be clear, I think the vast majority of the community, have not been sucked into the vortex of this back and forth.

1498
02:30:55,852 --> 02:31:02,616
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think they think that teachers are being really greedy, and I don't think they think the district is being really disrespectful.

1499
02:31:03,196 --> 02:31:08,860
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the vast majority of members of the public schools community, our internal stakeholders, including our staff,

1500
02:31:09,660 --> 02:31:13,183
[SPEAKER_14]: and the community are just looking for a resolution.

1501
02:31:14,024 --> 02:31:24,152
[SPEAKER_14]: And we share that sentiment, but a reckless solution is not one that the district can in good faith endorse.

1502
02:31:24,292 --> 02:31:29,436
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think I would say with respect to the specifics, I think we've got a meeting on the 7th.

1503
02:31:30,097 --> 02:31:32,398
[SPEAKER_14]: I think my hope is that that's a constructive dialogue.

1504
02:31:33,119 --> 02:31:37,543
[SPEAKER_14]: My recommendation there would be we leave the conversation there and pick it up again on the 7th.

1505
02:31:39,113 --> 02:31:39,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin.

1506
02:31:40,714 --> 02:31:41,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1507
02:31:41,094 --> 02:31:46,076
[SPEAKER_09]: I just had a question for, again, the lay person who doesn't understand or needs clarification or whatever.

1508
02:31:46,976 --> 02:31:48,997
[SPEAKER_09]: What exactly is a tentative agreement?

1509
02:31:49,017 --> 02:31:49,217
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

1510
02:31:49,277 --> 02:31:49,537
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1511
02:31:49,557 --> 02:31:50,337
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a good question, Ms.

1512
02:31:50,357 --> 02:31:50,858
[SPEAKER_14]: McLaughlin.

1513
02:31:51,218 --> 02:31:56,260
[SPEAKER_14]: So, under, I know I always started toward a statute, which is not gonna be helpful based on that.

1514
02:31:57,040 --> 02:32:09,890
[SPEAKER_14]: From the family of the question, the law in Massachusetts is that both parties enter into a negotiating relationship, and the parties are responsible for reaching what we refer to as a tentative agreement.

1515
02:32:10,471 --> 02:32:24,201
[SPEAKER_14]: Once that tentative agreement is reached, under the DLR decisions, which is the, I'm sorry, under the law, the parties who negotiated

1516
02:32:25,482 --> 02:32:29,403
[SPEAKER_14]: are legally bound to support the agreement, okay?

1517
02:32:29,703 --> 02:32:35,245
[SPEAKER_14]: It is meant to avoid representatives from either party sabotaging an agreement.

1518
02:32:35,745 --> 02:32:38,966
[SPEAKER_14]: For instance, just a hypothetical, and I really, again, I appreciate Ms.

1519
02:32:38,986 --> 02:32:42,187
[SPEAKER_14]: McLaughlin for you leaving the door ajar for a nice illustration.

1520
02:32:43,047 --> 02:33:00,176
[SPEAKER_14]: If the district leadership had brought on October 17th back to you this tentative agreement, the 2.5% a year plus 1% in the final day of the fiscal year, and you, the fiscal hawks that you are, looked at us and said, I think that's too rich for our blood.

1521
02:33:01,316 --> 02:33:02,697
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to vote this down.

1522
02:33:03,377 --> 02:33:04,838
[SPEAKER_14]: Why don't you go back to the bargaining table?

1523
02:33:07,173 --> 02:33:14,375
[SPEAKER_14]: And our response was to sort of shrug our shoulders and say, all right, if you guys don't want that, then I guess we can try to negotiate again.

1524
02:33:14,395 --> 02:33:19,096
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we went back to the union and asked them to take a lower wage increase.

1525
02:33:19,577 --> 02:33:21,017
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be a prohibited practice.

1526
02:33:21,557 --> 02:33:28,439
[SPEAKER_14]: And so what played out was the inverse of that, where the union leadership represents the membership.

1527
02:33:29,259 --> 02:33:30,600
[SPEAKER_14]: That was voted down.

1528
02:33:31,758 --> 02:33:44,038
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, if this unfortunately proceeds, they'll have the union which will have the opportunity to furnish the documentation to indicate that they truly supported the agreement, along with testimony from folks who were in the meeting.

1529
02:33:48,423 --> 02:34:05,179
[SPEAKER_14]: They were bound to do that because the point of the TA is to help the parties get to an agreement, which is why once the superintendent signed on October 13th, we as an administration were responsible and legally obligated to urge you to support it.

1530
02:34:05,239 --> 02:34:06,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, it's true, you could vote it down.

1531
02:34:07,875 --> 02:34:14,299
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's not true that we can be indifferent or neutral or just throw our arms up and claim that's part of the democratic process.

1532
02:34:14,819 --> 02:34:21,884
[SPEAKER_14]: Part of the democratic process is we elect a legislature, they write laws, and the law is that the parties have to support the tentative agreements that were reached.

1533
02:34:22,784 --> 02:34:30,129
[SPEAKER_14]: So it is a step in the negotiating process designed to help facilitate resolution to ongoing negotiations.

1534
02:34:34,772 --> 02:34:35,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham.

1535
02:34:36,084 --> 02:34:36,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1536
02:34:36,505 --> 02:34:43,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen a question floating around in a couple of different places.

1537
02:34:44,643 --> 02:34:50,526
[SPEAKER_08]: that goes something like if you wanted to give the teachers a bonus, you could just do it.

1538
02:34:50,727 --> 02:34:53,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Or could you just do it?

1539
02:34:53,408 --> 02:34:56,310
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's actually a question, a genuine one, like we don't know.

1540
02:34:56,530 --> 02:34:57,451
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely not.

1541
02:34:57,491 --> 02:34:59,693
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't unilaterally just increase a party's pay.

1542
02:34:59,913 --> 02:35:08,899
[SPEAKER_08]: So because we are under a collective bargaining agreement, any and all compensation must be driven through collective agreement with our bargaining partners.

1543
02:35:08,919 --> 02:35:09,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that true?

1544
02:35:09,539 --> 02:35:09,999
[SPEAKER_14]: That's correct.

1545
02:35:10,039 --> 02:35:13,602
[SPEAKER_14]: There are a few exceptions with respect to like declaring an impasse over like

1546
02:35:14,042 --> 02:35:23,491
[SPEAKER_14]: But I saw that there was a communication that went out saying that essentially the school committee can increase their pay any time you want.

1547
02:35:23,511 --> 02:35:24,512
[SPEAKER_14]: The answer is no, you can't.

1548
02:35:26,614 --> 02:35:27,635
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to bargain that.

1549
02:35:28,256 --> 02:35:38,804
[SPEAKER_14]: If we could, you could, I mean, there's a whole rationale, public policy rationale that I'm not gonna go into at 8.35 tonight, but if you're interested, you can give me a call.

1550
02:35:39,184 --> 02:35:41,767
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, you can't unilaterally just increase people's pay.

1551
02:35:42,527 --> 02:35:42,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor?

1552
02:35:43,028 --> 02:35:43,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1553
02:35:43,928 --> 02:35:44,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Russo?

1554
02:35:44,689 --> 02:35:45,229
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, yes.

1555
02:35:45,329 --> 02:35:52,595
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, the most obvious example of that is that we could not decide as a committee that we would give high-performing teachers a

1556
02:35:53,564 --> 02:35:59,769
[SPEAKER_15]: bonus every year and we get to decide what high performing is, that would totally be insane.

1557
02:36:01,230 --> 02:36:12,278
[SPEAKER_15]: And we just, you know, all compensation, although I imagine there's some situations you're mentioning, not mentioning, but it has to go through this process.

1558
02:36:13,018 --> 02:36:14,819
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a mandatory bargaining issue.

1559
02:36:16,093 --> 02:36:25,380
[SPEAKER_15]: I just also, you know, I think I've sort of given a version of this tiny speech before, you know, we're all

1560
02:36:26,932 --> 02:36:37,240
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody, and I mean the teachers, the administration, the public of Medford, all of us are running around trying to, you know, at each other's throats for the scraps.

1561
02:36:38,041 --> 02:36:45,686
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, the 1993 Ed Reform Act, which we, there was much in it that was great, but there was also much in it that we don't talk about.

1562
02:36:45,767 --> 02:36:52,071
[SPEAKER_15]: And that is that the defund public education folks won, the charter school folks won, the anti-tax folks won.

1563
02:36:53,012 --> 02:37:11,687
[SPEAKER_15]: The anti-union folks won in this landmark legislation that puts the school committee, you know, and when we think about unions and we think about negotiating, we think of businesses who can raise their rates, they can lower the profits they're sending to their shareholders.

1564
02:37:13,248 --> 02:37:18,292
[SPEAKER_15]: But school committees got this very fascinating little, I can't think of a non,

1565
02:37:19,193 --> 02:37:22,034
[SPEAKER_15]: vulgar word, so I'll just, it's not good.

1566
02:37:22,434 --> 02:37:30,797
[SPEAKER_15]: We were given the authority to negotiate something with no authority to have anything to do with the amount of money we have to spend.

1567
02:37:31,257 --> 02:37:35,058
[SPEAKER_15]: It is truly one of the most insane things that exists.

1568
02:37:36,519 --> 02:37:38,621
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, it's not an accident.

1569
02:37:38,781 --> 02:37:39,482
[SPEAKER_15]: It's on purpose.

1570
02:37:39,742 --> 02:37:40,543
[SPEAKER_15]: And who benefits?

1571
02:37:40,643 --> 02:37:41,284
[SPEAKER_15]: The rich do.

1572
02:37:41,404 --> 02:37:49,272
[SPEAKER_15]: The people in Wellesley, Reston, and Winchester who can raise their taxes every year, sometimes twice a year, to get what they want.

1573
02:37:50,474 --> 02:37:58,022
[SPEAKER_15]: And they know that the rest of us won't be doing that and instead will be at each other's throat, tearing each other apart, rather than

1574
02:37:59,929 --> 02:38:07,558
[SPEAKER_15]: doing the stuff that everybody wants us to do, including this committee, including the teachers, the superintendent, Mr. Murphy, I mean, you know,

1575
02:38:10,191 --> 02:38:10,952
[SPEAKER_15]: It's absurd.

1576
02:38:10,972 --> 02:38:28,612
[SPEAKER_15]: It's where we are, and I'm not suggesting that we just all throw up our hands and walk out of the room, but I think it's also really, really important to not forget there are winners and losers, and the community of Medford, all of us, we're on the loser's side of this equation.

1577
02:38:29,553 --> 02:38:30,233
[SPEAKER_15]: The State House,

1578
02:38:30,894 --> 02:38:36,000
[SPEAKER_15]: could change the school funding model for the entire state like Vermont did.

1579
02:38:36,460 --> 02:38:50,755
[SPEAKER_15]: They could say this is stupid to have 351 communities trying to figure this out and have a single funding model that the state does and then places like Cambridge would have to cut their poor people spending in half

1580
02:38:53,766 --> 02:38:56,147
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can imagine why that's not going to be a popular thing.

1581
02:38:57,468 --> 02:38:59,769
[SPEAKER_15]: But we don't have a legislature.

1582
02:39:00,529 --> 02:39:02,050
[SPEAKER_15]: We think we're a liberal state.

1583
02:39:02,070 --> 02:39:03,290
[SPEAKER_15]: We are not a liberal state.

1584
02:39:03,610 --> 02:39:06,652
[SPEAKER_15]: We are a protection of the wealthy state.

1585
02:39:07,072 --> 02:39:11,974
[SPEAKER_15]: We just also wear a giant D on our foreheads, regardless of whether we're really a Democrat.

1586
02:39:12,514 --> 02:39:21,238
[SPEAKER_15]: So I say all this probably the fifth time since I've been in office, because I think it's really

1587
02:39:22,867 --> 02:39:26,669
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a detriment to all of us to think of any of us as the enemy.

1588
02:39:27,850 --> 02:39:40,836
[SPEAKER_15]: We are all just a part of the other side of the equation and the rich and powerful and corporations who are people too in this country, they are benefiting very clearly.

1589
02:39:41,176 --> 02:39:48,880
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just also wanna add like the Student Opportunity Act, the millionaires tax that just passed, those are all really big deals.

1590
02:39:49,281 --> 02:39:51,602
[SPEAKER_15]: They are also just taking the edge off of this.

1591
02:39:53,100 --> 02:40:04,815
[SPEAKER_15]: The millionaires didn't let us get this millionaires tax pass, you know, it was a lot of work to get it done by a lot of people, it barely passed, which shocks me to my core.

1592
02:40:07,935 --> 02:40:09,836
[SPEAKER_15]: This is about taking the edge off.

1593
02:40:10,417 --> 02:40:12,578
[SPEAKER_15]: This isn't about fixing the problem.

1594
02:40:13,139 --> 02:40:18,323
[SPEAKER_15]: So those, that new tax, the Student Opportunity Act gave Medford pretty much nothing.

1595
02:40:18,843 --> 02:40:24,847
[SPEAKER_15]: But the millionaire's tax, I hope nobody thinks that everything's gonna be rosy in a couple of years.

1596
02:40:25,128 --> 02:40:27,710
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not, it's gonna be a little less awful.

1597
02:40:29,270 --> 02:40:30,611
[SPEAKER_15]: from a tax perspective.

1598
02:40:30,731 --> 02:40:39,335
[SPEAKER_15]: So I hope people can not feel like we've succeeded and move on, because we have an awful lot to do to fix this system.

1599
02:40:39,975 --> 02:40:44,917
[SPEAKER_15]: We're gonna be doing this again next year for the next contract, assuming we get this one done.

1600
02:40:45,637 --> 02:40:50,820
[SPEAKER_15]: And the math isn't gonna look any better, and it's not gonna look any better at the contract after that.

1601
02:40:51,020 --> 02:40:55,862
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we want it to look better, then we need a state legislature to do something

1602
02:40:56,789 --> 02:41:00,778
[SPEAKER_15]: to change the entire model, because this model will not ever work.

1603
02:41:02,361 --> 02:41:02,682
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1604
02:41:04,606 --> 02:41:05,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Hudson.

1605
02:41:07,862 --> 02:41:08,343
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening.

1606
02:41:08,483 --> 02:41:15,308
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to make a few remarks to all the teachers that are online listening right now.

1607
02:41:16,049 --> 02:41:23,715
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's critically important that everyone knows that we are trying our best to get this contract ratified.

1608
02:41:23,795 --> 02:41:25,336
[SPEAKER_16]: You've heard everything this evening.

1609
02:41:26,037 --> 02:41:28,359
[SPEAKER_16]: We wanted to get the money to the teachers.

1610
02:41:29,039 --> 02:41:30,683
[SPEAKER_16]: It was the holiday time of year.

1611
02:41:30,763 --> 02:41:35,212
[SPEAKER_16]: We were hoping to have those one-time payments by the end of this year.

1612
02:41:35,753 --> 02:41:39,921
[SPEAKER_16]: And now the clock is winding down in terms of it even being able to be possible.

1613
02:41:40,646 --> 02:41:51,728
[SPEAKER_16]: What I can say to the membership, when we had the big meeting in the library, after we went back to renegotiate, the only thing that was put on the table was the elementary schedule.

1614
02:41:52,228 --> 02:42:00,530
[SPEAKER_16]: So at this point in time, everything has been tabled or deferred until next year, including the elementary schedule.

1615
02:42:01,170 --> 02:42:08,092
[SPEAKER_16]: So the only thing that is left now, which has been clearly stated this evening, is about the money, the finances.

1616
02:42:08,852 --> 02:42:11,235
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is a totally different conversation.

1617
02:42:12,296 --> 02:42:15,219
[SPEAKER_16]: What Medford is offering is compatible.

1618
02:42:15,239 --> 02:42:18,422
[SPEAKER_16]: It is competitive with our neighboring districts.

1619
02:42:18,942 --> 02:42:23,527
[SPEAKER_16]: I have been in communication with superintendents and other colleagues.

1620
02:42:24,088 --> 02:42:31,796
[SPEAKER_16]: We are not, the narrative that's being said that Medford is at the bottom of the barrel, that is so far from the truth.

1621
02:42:32,336 --> 02:42:37,519
[SPEAKER_16]: We are actually in pretty good standing in comparison to the neighboring districts.

1622
02:42:38,020 --> 02:42:40,341
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to have this contract ratified.

1623
02:42:40,681 --> 02:42:42,462
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to be able to move forward.

1624
02:42:42,903 --> 02:42:43,863
[SPEAKER_16]: I am in the schools.

1625
02:42:44,344 --> 02:42:52,208
[SPEAKER_16]: I see the teachers working very hard, working with all of our students, no matter what their needs may be, meeting the needs of their students.

1626
02:42:52,729 --> 02:42:56,491
[SPEAKER_16]: We wanna be able to come to resolution as soon as possible.

1627
02:42:56,951 --> 02:42:59,493
[SPEAKER_16]: And I hope those of you who are listening on the call

1628
02:42:59,953 --> 02:43:05,420
[SPEAKER_16]: You hear that we are truly being sincere and we are not trying to disrespect anyone.

1629
02:43:05,861 --> 02:43:07,643
[SPEAKER_16]: That narrative needs to stop.

1630
02:43:08,144 --> 02:43:12,970
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to work together and think about all of our students, keeping them front and center.

1631
02:43:13,410 --> 02:43:13,751
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1632
02:43:16,547 --> 02:43:17,307
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Superintendent.

1633
02:43:17,327 --> 02:43:19,948
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, we'll be there December 7th.

1634
02:43:20,008 --> 02:43:26,851
[SPEAKER_14]: We look forward to the conversation and our positions will be reflective of what we've discussed tonight.

1635
02:43:27,591 --> 02:43:31,032
[SPEAKER_14]: I look forward to keeping you all apprised going forward.

1636
02:43:32,613 --> 02:43:33,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1637
02:43:34,138 --> 02:43:49,593
[SPEAKER_11]: We have no presentations of the public, no continued business or new business, and number 11, reports requested dyslexia screening and intervention update requested by member Hayes, member Graham, member Rousseau, questions to be answered.

1638
02:43:50,314 --> 02:43:58,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Number one, NWEA map does not include assessments of non-sense word decoding or rapid automatic naming of letters,

1639
02:43:58,800 --> 02:44:00,581
[SPEAKER_11]: both recommended and DSEE guidelines.

1640
02:44:00,741 --> 02:44:02,142
[SPEAKER_11]: How are we addressing those areas?

1641
02:44:02,623 --> 02:44:04,864
[SPEAKER_11]: How are we screening prior to map?

1642
02:44:05,565 --> 02:44:13,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Number two, what number of students have been identified as at risk for dyslexia, lacking specific foundational skills each year and grades?

1643
02:44:15,012 --> 02:44:15,252
[SPEAKER_11]: K-1-2.

1644
02:44:15,432 --> 02:44:19,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Number three, how many K-1-2 students are receiving target intervention?

1645
02:44:23,226 --> 02:44:26,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to read the reading by Member Hayes, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1646
02:44:26,187 --> 02:44:26,908
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1647
02:44:26,928 --> 02:44:26,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

1648
02:44:27,668 --> 02:44:28,528
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1649
02:44:28,608 --> 02:44:34,871
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll turn it over to, would like to, would anybody like, Member Hayes?

1650
02:44:38,233 --> 02:44:38,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make this brief.

1651
02:44:39,713 --> 02:44:42,394
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we are talking a lot about reading this year.

1652
02:44:42,414 --> 02:44:49,818
[SPEAKER_03]: We already have another report requested about looking into our, how we're following the science of reading and the new,

1653
02:44:51,271 --> 02:44:57,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess it's not too new, but the research that's out there about how to the right way to teach reading and this just kind of falls in line with that.

1654
02:44:57,754 --> 02:45:05,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that we, the state within the last few years has mandated the dyslexia screening and they are now looking towards also, um,

1655
02:45:07,677 --> 02:45:10,759
[SPEAKER_03]: requiring interventions to be put in place.

1656
02:45:10,919 --> 02:45:18,003
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this particular motion or request for report is just looking at what are we doing now?

1657
02:45:18,784 --> 02:45:20,325
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a dyslexia screener.

1658
02:45:21,466 --> 02:45:26,589
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we have in place for students who are shown at risk by the screener?

1659
02:45:27,269 --> 02:45:31,572
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of data do we have and what interventions do we have in place?

1660
02:45:34,721 --> 02:45:37,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion by Member Hayes, seconded by Member Rousseau.

1661
02:45:37,824 --> 02:45:38,725
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1662
02:45:39,106 --> 02:45:39,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

1663
02:45:39,606 --> 02:45:40,387
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1664
02:45:40,948 --> 02:45:41,728
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

1665
02:45:43,410 --> 02:45:48,555
[SPEAKER_11]: We have no condolences, and our next meeting is December 19th, 2022.

1666
02:45:48,595 --> 02:45:52,500
[SPEAKER_11]: That will be a regular school committee meeting in Alden Memorial Chambers, Memphis City Hall.

1667
02:45:53,961 --> 02:45:55,443
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a wonderful rest of the week, everybody.

1668
02:45:56,103 --> 02:45:59,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to adjourn by Member Graham, seconded by
