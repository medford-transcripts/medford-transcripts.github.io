    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=0.234s">hope</a>  everybody had a wonderful Thanksgiving. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1.675s">I'd</a>  like to welcome Marky here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=7.439s">So</a>  happy to have you, the superintendent's assistant, new assistant. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=11.982s">Thank</a>  you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=13.123s">We're</a>  going to start the seventh regular meeting of the Medford School Committee, Monday, December 5th, 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=25.111s">Regular</a>  meeting, 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=26.271s">held</a>  at the Howard Alden Memorial Chambers, Medford City Hall, as well as on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=30.742s">You</a>  can also call in by dialing 1-309-205-3325 and join by Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=33.546s">Roll</a>  call, member Ruseau, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=35.048s">Member</a>  Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=35.508s">Here.</a> </p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=54.016s">We</a>  also have our student rep Melanie Chavez.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=57.139s">Thank</a>  you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=58.179s">If</a>  we can all rise to salute the flag.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=82.742s">We</a>  have number three, good of the order. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=85.49s">I</a>  believe we have that last meeting too. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=86.954s">I</a>  don't know if anybody has anything they'd like to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=89.02s">Member</a>  Hays.</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=91.223s">Thank</a>  you, I just had two very quick things. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=93.184s">One,</a>  well, first I'd like to mention that it's great we've already got the microphone for our student representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=98.226s">I</a>  did want to check on the follow through with the idea of putting student participation on the agenda and just, I brought it up, but I don't think we talked about how that would, we'd follow through on that, whether that needs to go to maybe the rules subcommittee to talk about.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=115.333s">So</a>  motion to- Motion to move the student participation to the rules subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=120.795s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=121.693s">Motion</a>  by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Hays. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=124.097s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=125.419s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=125.84s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=126.501s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=128.291s">One</a>  other quick thing, so we had a training meeting back in October, was it, about the superintendent evaluation, and I know we've talked a little bit about, there were some things that came up that we need to either update or refine. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=143.535s">If</a>  we could put, I think we were talking about maybe doing a committee of the whole for that, I just wanted to make sure, again, there's a lot going on that got followed through with.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=151.316s">Yeah,</a>  but I think we decided at 5 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=153.777s">for</a>  a January meeting, so you just pick one and let us know, and we'll hold the date and time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=158.592s">Okay,</a>  Superintendent will get us a date and time, 5 p.m., one of the meetings in January.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=168.837s">And</a>  just a reminder that we have the meeting for the school committee goals, right?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=175.181s">Yes,</a>  that could be next, at the December meeting, or was that the second one in January? <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=180.083s">Okay,</a>  sounds great. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=185.93s">Then</a>  we also have the consent agenda, number four, bills and payrolls, regular school committee meeting minutes, 22, November 21st. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=193.913s">Is</a>  there a motion for approval? <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=195.534s">Motion</a>  to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=196.635s">Member</a>  McLaughlin, seconded by? <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=198.676s">Seconded.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=199.316s">Member</a>  Kreatz, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=200.897s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=202.077s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=202.957s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=205.078s">Number</a>  five, we have report of the superintendent, superintendent's updates and comments.</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=208.9s">Dr.</a>  Marice Edouard-Vincent, superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=217.571s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=223.256s">Good</a>  evening.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=229.922s">I</a>  hope that everyone had a nice Thanksgiving break and that some of you were able to join us at Fenway Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=237.248s">Although</a>  the outcome wasn't what we would have wanted, the Mustangs gave it their all. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=243.433s">And</a>  for that, we are very proud of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=246.454s">I</a>  also want to say a special thanks to our Mustang students, families, and alumni who supported the event. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=256.051s">I</a>  want to thank <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=258.232s">Our</a>  athletic team, Dr. Cushing, Principal DeLeva, Mr. Galusi, all the students who planned and participated in the entertaining pep rally that preceded the game as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=273.541s">So</a>  thank you to all of you, the band, and everyone did a fabulous job. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=280.618s">Also,</a>  I would like to take this opportunity to thank state representative Christine Barber and the rest of our state delegation for the inclusion of an act to ensure dependent health coverage for adults with disabilities in the legislature's mental health bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=298.512s">This</a>  act restores a provision that allows people with severe disabilities to remain on their parents' health plan without an age limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=308.168s">This</a>  is a critical issue for our Mustang families of children with disabilities, and we appreciate the hard work of Representative Barber. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=319.438s">I</a>  would also like to thank the following partners for supporting the Missittuck School for this holiday season. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=329.246s">The</a>  Missittuck hosted a holiday giving program in collaboration with the Malden YMCA, Bank of America, the United Way, Kirkland and Ellis, and the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority, which provided gift cards and funds to the Missittuck community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=348.998s">Due</a>  to everyone's generosity, a number of food bags and gift cards were able to be donated to families at the Missittuck School. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=358.595s">The</a>  Missittuck PTO is continuing to collect gift cards and donations until December 9th. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=366.715s">Great</a>  work, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=369.966s">I</a>  also would like to recognize our Buddhist family and friends who are celebrating a significant holiday called Bodhi Holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=379.609s">Bodhi</a>  Day is celebrated December 8th and notes the day that Lord Buddha's enlightenment occurred. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=387.611s">The</a>  colors of Bodhi Day are often red, green, silver, and white. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=393.573s">Buddhists</a>  decorate pine trees and come together to worship and to celebrate fellowship and joy. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=400.211s">Since</a>  we have a Buddhist temple here in Medford, the Karukala Center, I take this opportunity to wish our Buddhist community a blessed Bodhi Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=410.755s">There</a>  are two historical days to keep in mind, dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=415.877s">December</a>  7th is the 81st commemoration of National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, and December 15th <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=427.549s">is</a>  the United States Bill of Rights Day, which was ratified on December 15th, 1791. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=437.557s">The</a>  Bill of Rights are the first 10 amendments to our Constitution, which protects some of the most indispensable rights and liberties that define us as Americans. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=449.165s">There</a>  are several upcoming events happening in Medford between now and our next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=455.25s">December</a>  7th this week, <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=457.532s">is</a>  both a booster and a flu clinic at the high school from three to 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=465.558s">On</a>  December 10th and 11th, our band parents continue to have the tree and reef sale. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=472.223s">Despite</a>  the rain, it's been very successful and I wanna thank the Medford community for supporting our band parents during this fundraiser. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=480.409s">It</a>  takes place from 10 to five at the high school parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=485.612s">Medford</a>  Family Network is going to be hosting their annual book and toy swap. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=492.335s">That's</a>  December 11th. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=493.695s">It's</a>  by appointment only from one to five o'clock at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=500.118s">Also</a>  on December 11th, we have the Tufts men's basketball team hosting a free youth clinic for our students here in grades five through eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=512.369s">It's</a>  going to take place at Tufts University in the Cousins Gym from 430 to 6. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=518.751s">Tufts</a>  University is asking that you support them by bringing an item for their donation, their support of the Home for Little Wanderers. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=530.153s">So</a>  if you decide to participate in that, feel free to bring a new toy or a personal care item, and it will be donated to the Home for Little Wanderers. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=541.027s">On</a>  December 14th, we have a CPAC meeting, which is going to be about basic rights, evaluation, and eligibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=549.841s">That's</a>  from 6 to 8 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=551.364s">by</a>  Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=553.388s">On</a>  December 14th and December 15th, we have our winter concerts. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=558.991s">December</a>  14th is our band, and that concert will be taking place in the Caron Theater at 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=567.855s">It's</a>  $5 per person. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=569.976s">And</a>  on December 15th, it will be our orchestra winter concert taking place also in the Caron Theater at 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=579.361s">Tickets</a>  are $5 per person. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=582.697s">Lastly,</a>  before we meet again, December 18th marks the beginning of Hanukkah. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=589.139s">Hanukkah</a>  begins at sundown and continues until December 26th. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=595.082s">It</a>  celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and the freedom to worship God. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=600.604s">Happy</a>  Hanukkah to our Jewish families and friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=605.154s">Later</a>  in the agenda, we will be having several presentations, and one of the key presentations today will be a labor update. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=614.036s">Thank</a>  you, and have a good evening.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=617.216s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edward-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=619.997s">We</a>  have number two, before and after school presentation by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=623.957s">Megan</a>  Fidler-Carey, Director of Family and Community Engagement, who I'm assuming is on Zoom? <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=631.159s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=631.819s">Ms.</a> </p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=632.039s">Fidler-Carey.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=640.862s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=641.362s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Megan Fidler-Carey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=643.244s">Sorry,</a>  I had to get to my camera. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=646.667s">How</a>  are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=649.789s">Thank</a>  you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=650.99s">Thank</a>  you for the opportunity to present on afterschool. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=654.553s">We</a>  wanted to answer some questions that came up earlier in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=658.396s">So</a>  this presentation is just quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=660.958s">It's</a>  not comprehensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=663.5s">As</a>  expected, we plan to present again in the spring when we have some better ideas about what the next year will look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=671.482s">But</a>  today we just wanted to answer some of those questions that have come up throughout the fall, just because we know that some people are still curious about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=682.334s">So</a>  these were specific questions that some families have asked us. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=687.816s">And</a>  so we just wanted to respond directly to those questions there about specific statistics about our programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=694.619s">We</a>  can't unfortunately answer questions about other programs in the city because they're their own entities, but we are happy to answer the questions about our school programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=706.485s">So</a>  one of the first questions that came up specifically was how many families are enrolled in afterschool <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=713.641s">versus</a>  applicants to the lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=716.443s">And</a>  this was from last spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=718.645s">So</a>  as you know, our programs are very full and we have wait lists at every program at the four elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=726.852s">And</a>  every spring we run a lottery to fill the open spots, the spots that become available as fifth graders graduate out or people move or drop out of the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=737.031s">So</a>  to answer these questions specifically, these are our current numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=741.873s">Actually,</a>  these were our current numbers last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=744.174s">And</a>  the problem with this sort of data is it's completely dynamic. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=747.755s">It's</a>  changing every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=749.376s">So</a>  some of these numbers are already obsolete, but this gives you a good sense of where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=756.118s">So</a>  the total number of students enrolled is 330 across the district at the four schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=762.461s">Again,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=763.206s">What</a>  we talked about last spring was the difference of thinking about this in terms of families who are enrolled in the program versus seats available. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=771.392s">Because</a>  we do offer spots for two days a week, three days a week, or five days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=776.516s">So</a>  it doesn't necessarily capture the data if we tell you how many families are enrolled in afterschool, because some of them might be two days, some might be three, some might be five. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=787.404s">So</a>  we have 330 students enrolled. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=790.97s">but</a>  across the district, there are only 300 seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=796.552s">So</a>  last spring, this was a question that was specifically asked, how many applicants were there to the lottery? <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=801.933s">And</a>  there were 152. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=802.673s">And</a>  then the total that got spots was 47. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=806.954s">We</a>  only had 47 open seats that we could enter the lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=810.615s">Since</a>  then, we've entered more. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=812.916s">We've</a>  had more students come off of the wait list this year, but that's the direct answer to the lottery question. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=821.108s">And</a>  then the question was asked specifically about the waitlist. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=825.131s">People</a>  would like more clarification about what the waitlist looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=829.293s">And</a>  so the question was asked, could we spread it out across grades? <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=832.635s">So</a>  I'll let people who are interested in this take a moment to look at this table that shows you what the waitlist numbers look like at every grade level at every school. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=844.591s">You</a>  do notice that it, the numbers, if we could go back to that slide, you'll notice that the numbers drop off in the older grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=851.834s">And</a>  we think that's for two different reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=854.075s">First</a>  of all, maybe students got into the program who had been on the wait list, but second of all, you know, some students just become more independent and can take care and don't necessarily need afterschool care. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=864.58s">And</a>  it definitely depends on, you know, what time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=867.796s">families</a>  come home if they need, you know, the full three hours of afterschool care, or if they only needed a little bit, then, you know, fourth and fifth graders are more independent to be on their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=878.402s">Okay,</a>  now we can go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=883.025s">Another</a>  question that was asked based on what we presented in the spring, some of our solutions for increasing staff <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=895.484s">Applicants.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=896.084s">So</a>  one of our problems for maintaining our maximum spots at each of the schools is that it's very difficult to hire for after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=905.07s">So</a>  one of the solutions that we came up with that was, you know, has been suggested <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=909.451s">was</a>  to increase pay rates and someone asked if that had in fact been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=913.994s">So</a>  the answer is yes, we're glad to say yes, we increased pay rates pretty significantly for last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=921.84s">And</a>  then we did a standard cost of living increase for this year and kept most of our staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=928.385s">So</a>  that's been working and it's definitely a competitive rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=931.327s">We</a>  noticed that we started a trend, other districts around us have been increasing their pay rates as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=937.211s">So</a>  I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=938.982s">As</a>  I say, every year and every time I'm in front of this body, this is a problem that's not unique to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=944.884s">There</a>  are wait lists at all sorts of afterschool programs, private and district run, and staffing is one of the biggest challenges we face. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=954.628s">So</a>  we can move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=957.77s">Another</a>  solution that we've talked about is to think about tuition rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=962.651s">If</a>  staffing, to increase staffing pay, <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=966.823s">we</a>  thought we'd need to increase tuition rates, which we did just a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=971.527s">As</a>  you know, we try and keep it as affordable as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=974.95s">Last</a>  spring, I also asked the school committee to honor the idea of doing away with the EEC vouchers. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=984.317s">So</a>  if you'll recall, I know that that meeting is recorded somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=987.92s">So</a>  if you wanted more information about that, I encourage you to go find that meeting, but we did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=992.944s">So</a>  starting at the beginning of this year, we no longer accept vouchers from EEC. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=997.139s">Instead,</a>  we're doing a sliding scale financial assistance rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1001.481s">And</a>  the eligibility is based on the same eligibility criteria that the Community Development Block Grant uses for their funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1009.924s">So</a>  we've got currently, I think I have it on here, 21 families that are paying discounted tuition who filled out those forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1017.807s">And</a>  we're going to reach out to all families in the program again after the new year <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1022.449s">to</a>  to say if anything changes and you feel like you need to apply for this tuition discount now they can do that so the idea will be that at the beginning of the year, and then halfway through the year people can apply for financial assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1037.904s">So</a>  we'll give people a minute to hold on let's give people a minute to look at this slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1045.185s">From</a>  last spring, we increased the pay rate just a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1048.186s">I</a>  mean, the tuition rate just a little bit based on the trend. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1054.648s">We</a>  based it on what voucher was reimbursing, even though we weren't gonna be taking vouchers, that was our sort of benchmark that we used. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1062.03s">So</a>  we increased just a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1063.59s">We're</a>  looking at that again, and there may be a chance that we'll have to increase some more for next year, but that's a report that we'll give you in the spring when we have a better sense of what our budget truly looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1073.813s">Okay,</a>  now we can go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1076.437s">Speaking</a>  of budget, that was another question that came up transparency for what the budget looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1081.361s">Now</a>  these numbers are, this is very dynamic and this may change as we're looking at it, especially noting that we're, we're trying <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1089.98s">to</a>  keep creative with staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1091.841s">We're</a>  looking at how, I told you that other districts have been raising their pay rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1096.303s">So</a>  again, we wanna stay competitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1098.263s">So</a>  we're looking at our own pay rates to think about what that might look like and what changes we might need to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1103.446s">So</a>  these budget estimates are very crude at this point, and we'll have a much better sense in the spring of what this will look like for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1112.149s">But</a>  I wanted to make sure that all of the questions that were asked earlier this fall, both at school committee <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1120.003s">meetings</a>  and in some emails that we've received. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1122.225s">I</a>  tried to answer every question that's come across our desk, and I hope I got to all of them.</p>

    <p>[Announcer]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1132.916s">Thank</a>  you, Ms.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1133.756s">Fiblikary.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1134.377s">Appreciate</a>  the update.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1135.498s">Member</a>  Graham, thank you for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1138.181s">Can</a>  you just tell us how many students are enrolled in each of the programs <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1145.205s">today,</a>  like how many of the 330 enrolled are at each school? <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1149.927s">Do</a>  you know roughly?</p>

    <p>[Megan Fidler-Carey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1151.888s">So</a>  again, I hesitate to talk about students, but if we talk about seats, that's the one that I can say very definitively. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1159.092s">So</a>  at the Brooks School, for example, we have 120 seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1163.214s">We've</a>  got a grade group for each grade, and that's 20 students per grade group. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1170.258s">And</a>  then at the other schools, we've got 60 seats, 60 seats, and 60 seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1175.316s">We've</a>  got three grade groups at each of the other schools.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1180.138s">And</a>  if I am recalling the history of that, correct, it's actually fairly new that there are wait lists outside of the Brooks School. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1188.662s">Is</a>  that true?</p>

    <p>[Megan Fidler-Carey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1191.143s">At</a>  the length that they are, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1192.804s">We've</a>  had sort of five and six students on a wait list. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1197.506s">And</a>  that might be because they had specific needs that we needed specific staffing for, <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1204.039s">You</a>  know it was it was one grade group that had just too many and so we had five on that grade group wait lists, but this year, yes, it has gotten a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1212.571s">It's</a>  at every school that we've got wait lists.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1218.374s">I</a>  think you've also talked at times about particularly at the Brooks, there really not being a lot of opportunity to expand that program further because it poses some challenges and some safety issues and that kind of thing for that group to expand beyond its current number of seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1235.199s">Is</a>  that still true at the Brooks?</p>

    <p>[Megan Fidler-Carey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1237.32s">Yes,</a>  definitely.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1238.62s">And</a>  does that mean then that if we were able to find more staff that the other programs could expand?</p>

    <p>[Megan Fidler-Carey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1248.726s">Yes,</a>  that's, yes, in fact, so if I were to hire more staff, and in fact, it feels so defeatist to say it, but we've had so few applicants. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1260.955s">We're</a>  advertising everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1262.777s">We've</a>  got it posted in all of the same places we always have before and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1268.621s">I'm</a>  constantly asking other districts if they've figured out any secret new place to advertise or recruit from. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1277.803s">But</a>  if we did get new applicants, they would go to the Roberts first, which is where our next biggest wait list is. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1284.469s">And</a>  we would expand that program first.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1288.753s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Megan Fidler-Carey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1289.874s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1292.076s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1293.499s">Yes,</a>  thank you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1296.92s">And</a>  if I'm understanding correctly, the 120 across the grades compared to the 60 at the other schools is just, it's a demand issue, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1306.522s">Like</a>  there's more demand at the Brooks.</p>

    <p>[Megan Fidler-Carey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1309.643s">There</a>  was there in the past, there was more demand. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1312.504s">So</a>  we grew that program bigger, but now the demand is pretty high at the other schools as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1318.265s">Certainly</a>  the Roberts and Missituk are close behind.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1322.568s">But</a>  they're all at 60.</p>

    <p>[Megan Fidler-Carey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1324.609s">They're</a>  at 60 because we hadn't grown them yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1328.43s">So</a>  the Brooks, the demand has been that high for longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1333.412s">So</a>  we grew that program so big. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1335.392s">And</a>  so since the way that we do this as current students get their spot the next year, so it's stayed that big.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1345.714s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1346.535s">And</a>  when you do the report for the spring, can I ask respectfully that you might include data specific to our English learner population and our student with disability population?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1358.923s">Certainly,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1364.085s">Just</a>  a question from the chair, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1365.646s">Igbukeri,</a>  do we, I know we did some outreach to try to gain new employees to apply for jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1375.728s">How</a>  is our staffing looking and are we continuing to do that so that we could hopefully, even if it's after the new year or even gearing up for the next academic year, we can try to fulfill our goal of raising capacity at those three other elementary schools?</p>

    <p>[Megan Fidler-Carey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1392.472s">So</a>  all of the positions are still posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1394.634s">And</a>  like I said, I've had, I've had like two applicants and they were actually word of mouth applicants. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1401.439s">They</a>  weren't from, it wasn't somebody looking for a job. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1405.563s">It's</a>  been, it's been really difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1409.626s">And</a>  you know, I, I, I, we face, we face the same, <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1415.27s">problems</a>  that a lot of other industries face. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1417.952s">So</a>  on Indeed, we have it posted and we got a lot of applicants over the summer from Indeed and then they didn't show up for the interviews, which was very painful because I blocked a whole day for the leadership team from the afterschool program to participate in the interviews with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1434.845s">And</a>  it was really tough when people didn't show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1438.167s">But</a>  I mean, we definitely are still recruiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1440.329s">So</a>  yes, we're still hiring, but the hiring <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1443.826s">hasn't</a>  been successful, I wouldn't say that it has. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1447.59s">The</a>  few people that we've hired are either internal paras, which is wonderful, or a couple of people that learned about it from word of mouth that, you know, are friends of current staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1459.24s">But</a>  unfortunately, none of them are five day a week kind of committed to this people, it's more, you know, kind of filling some holes.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1469.226s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1469.706s">And,</a>  and I know just if I may, from the chair on the city side, I know you, Megan, you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1475.112s">Fidelicari,</a>  you and I met with the West Medford Community Center leadership and Lisa was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1480.537s">I</a>  know that they were able to add a few spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1483.48s">And</a>  I also just want to point out that our economic development director has been meeting with me and communicating with me and trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1491.36s">reach</a>  out to companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1493.201s">I</a>  know there's two or three, including the YMCA, that are interested in expanding to Medford or the YMCA, expanding in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1502.603s">So</a>  we are working with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1503.984s">The</a>  issue we need to conquer is space, and then they'll have to deal with their staffing as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1509.605s">And</a>  I know our rec department is brainstorming ideas, so we are trying to cover every avenue to try to increase capacity here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1517.147s">We</a>  know it's an issue in every city and town, <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1519.748s">we</a>  want something we do want to try to solve here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1522.79s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1525.452s">There</a>  are two people with hands up. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1527.754s">I</a>  don't know if you want to take questions.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1529.536s">Emily,</a>  if you could state your name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Andre Quinn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1535.08s">Yeah,</a>  so this is this is Andre Quinn Emily's husband. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1538.341s">I</a>  guess I have a couple of questions, so we've been on the wait list for three years where I think you want to say this this where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1546.702s">So</a>  we're at night on Johnson Ave in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1549.923s">We've</a>  been on the wait list for three years and I guess my first question is. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1555.324s">Have</a>  you thought about the equity of the program? <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1557.665s">So</a>  I know some families get access to the program and it's for all of the. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1563.746s">the</a>  siblings and it's for the entirety of their enrollment at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1569.769s">I</a>  guess my question is, you know, as a parent that's never had access to the program, my question is, we asked the question three years ago about equity and we haven't seen any changes there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1584.757s">I</a>  think the original answer was that there's, you know, guidance or <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1591.926s">or</a>  evidence that suggests that that leads to the best outcomes for the students who are in the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1599.649s">My</a>  question is, from an equity perspective, I struggled to see how that leads to the best outcomes for my son, never having access to the program over three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1611.554s">So</a>  that's my question.</p>

    <p>[Megan Fidler-Carey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1620.35s">Yeah,</a>  you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1621.851s">I</a>  don't have a great answer for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1626.472s">It</a>  is considered best practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1630.413s">And</a>  when I say best practice, I guess I mean most common practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1633.875s">I</a>  think what they mean when they say that is, you know, whatever, hopefully alternate program or babysitter or alternative you find. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1647.719s">as</a>  long as that's consistent would be best for your child. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1650.32s">I</a>  know it's a terrible, it's not a welcome answer, and I wish I had better information. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1656.421s">I</a>  wish we could serve everybody who needs it, but yeah, I don't have a good answer for that equity question. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1666.803s">I</a>  believe we've had that conversation on the phone before, so I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1670.504s">Member</a>  McLaughlin, and then we're gonna go to Teresa.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1675.086s">Yeah,</a>  I guess what I'm hearing in terms of the equity and I'm not sure that there's a quick answer to this, but I think what I'm hearing is that part of the equity issue is the longstanding practice of <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1688.879s">if</a>  you have the slot, you retain the slot. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1690.44s">And</a>  then if you have siblings, then they get access to the slot. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1693.483s">And</a>  so I guess it begs the question, and again, not one that I think could be answered tonight, but one that perhaps should be considered among the afterschool program and the district as a whole is, you know, is it wipe the slate clean and start with the lottery every year? <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1710.114s">Or</a>  what's the more equitable solution? <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1713.677s">And</a>  I don't know what that is, but I'm just putting that out there, because I think that's what I'm hearing <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1718.442s">this</a>  particular individual?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1721.143s">Name</a>  and address of the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1725.625s">Member,</a>  John, can you just make sure the microphone's on, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1730.487s">It's</a>  just the person with the voice, if you wanna just touch the button. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1733.988s">Oh,</a>  it's on, it's on, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Chenine Peloquin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1735.069s">There,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1736.289s">Shanine</a>  Peliquin, 108 Bella. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1738.37s">Hi,</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1739.291s">Fidler-Carey.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1740.391s">We</a>  haven't met, but I did my grad internship at the National Institute on Out-of-School Time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1744.613s">Have</a>  you been connected with their programs?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1746.654s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Chenine Peloquin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1748.7s">I</a>  would assume that Betsy Starr might be a person to ask some of these questions with, because she's the person that does their workforce development, and I don't know if that might be a resource. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1757.627s">I</a>  know they can help with quality improvement stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1759.689s">I'm</a>  one of their observers. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1761.65s">But</a>  they might have suggestions for people to talk to and what the actual best practices are and how districts are kind of creatively solving this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1772.398s">Also,</a>  I mean, being able to use the paras and having it not be overtime, I don't know what that might even entail.</p>

    <p>[Megan Fidler-Carey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1778.038s">We</a>  do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1779.179s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1779.419s">Yeah,</a>  we do that.</p>

    <p>[Chenine Peloquin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1781.001s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1783.203s">Having</a>  been able to use the paras without it being overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1786.345s">So</a>  it's budget prohibitive for all the programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1788.167s">And</a>  I don't know how that might work. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1789.728s">But</a>  I know other programs do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1791.93s">They</a>  do it to leverage teacher salaries so that they can work in that summer camps over the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1796.755s">You</a>  know, there's all sorts of different ways that programs are getting more stuff from the existing HR resources.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1802.52s">So</a>  anyway, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Announcer]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1804.922s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1805.947s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1806.848s">Teresa,</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Fernald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1812.092s">Hi,</a>  this is Teresa Fernald, 13 Whittier Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1816.195s">I</a>  wanted to double click on what Andre was saying and Melanie followed up with in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1824.021s">And</a>  before I ask my question, I thank you for today's presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1827.183s">It</a>  goes and takes a step towards greater transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1830.886s">I</a>  think a big theme here is transparency and making the information <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1836.266s">more</a>  accessible for parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1839.528s">It's</a>  challenging, as you know, for parents even to get on a school committee, even on Zoom, much less I wish I could attend in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1848.112s">But</a>  we're all dealing with dinner and bath time and all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1853.087s">One</a>  thing very specifically on transparency is you've been mentioning for years about how Medford is similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1862.809s">And</a>  yet when a number of parents more than a year and a half, almost two years ago started a campaign to get more information, to advocate for more capacity, not just at the school, but within the city, we were asked to bring comps. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1877.611s">And</a>  so my question for you is, are you able, <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1882.176s">What</a>  information are you able to share? <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1884.017s">And</a>  can you share it in an accessible way, like a website, email blast through the school, the superintendent's messages to show us that data? <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1892.439s">How</a>  is this Medford compared to our neighbors, to Winchester, to Arlington, to Malden, to Melrose? <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1897.4s">There's</a>  so many where we don't see that it is the same problem from Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1902.822s">So</a>  we're asking for that transparency on how you're comparing Medford and how you can say we have the same problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1911.224s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Announcer]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1914.953s">Thank</a>  you, Teresa.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1918.015s">Michelle?</a> </p>

    <p>[Barkson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1922.417s">Hi,</a>  thank you for this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1924.498s">My</a>  name is Michelle Barks and I live at 23 Diane Road in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1928.359s">I</a>  appreciate everyone's time and energy with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1931.541s">So</a>  I have a couple of questions here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1934.022s">One</a>  with equity, I was wondering, something I've been thinking about with this is the idea of, so I know that <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1943.018s">the</a>  days are offered two, three, four, five, or maybe not four, but at least there's some part-time offerings. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1949.779s">Something</a>  about having all families have some access to the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1953.36s">So</a>  two or three days versus all five, that way it puts people in a similar position of having some care. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1961.422s">So</a>  it feels more equitable in terms of some people having, everyone having some care instead of all people <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1968.766s">I'm</a>  sorry, instead of some people having all care and some people having none for years and years and years. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1974.108s">So</a>  I'm wondering if that's been thought of at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1976.408s">And</a>  anyway, and then the other thing around transparency, can our parents able to see what number they are on the waitlist, just to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1986.393s">the</a>  chances of getting into the program in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=1988.935s">And</a>  I also was wondering, I keep hearing that it's a lottery, which I know it is, but I'm wondering if the process for parents getting picked could be explained, like how then, is it just like a random website that kind of uses the, that pulls out the names, like how, I'm wondering if those transparency questions can be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2010.131s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Megan Fidler-Carey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2012.273s">Yep,</a>  I can try and answer that just quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2015.469s">I</a>  go over that every spring, how the lottery system works. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2019.012s">We</a>  do, we use a number generator called random.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2023.436s">So</a>  I have all families who are applying for the lottery sign up through a Google form and then put all of their names in the random, find out how many numbers there are and put it through random.org to regenerate the lottery numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2038.348s">So</a>  I have at one point written that up and on one of the iterations of our website that is <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2044.665s">spelled</a>  out, I can't guarantee that that made it to our new website. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2048.868s">I</a>  will double check, and I'm happy to put it on to the step-by-step of how our lottery system works and how, for transparency purposes, because I agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2057.073s">First</a>  of all, I think that the random.org website option is really, and encourage people to use it if it comes up in any way, and I'm happy to share how it's used. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2067.62s">As</a>  far as sharing where students are on the wait list, again, that's a best practice shared across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2074.988s">There</a>  are emergency situations that we have where we've sometimes got to let students in to jump a waitlist for safety reasons or for McKinney-Vento reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2084.513s">McKinney-Vento</a>  is the Homeless Students Act, and there are rights to privacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2090.322s">where</a>  if I had told somebody that they were number one on the wait list and that they would be next, and somehow they found out that another student was let in before them, that would be revealing a lot of confidential information about that student that is not the business of the person who's number one on the wait list, who then would be pretty annoyed that they didn't get the next spot and they would know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2111.899s">So</a>  that's the guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2115.014s">from</a>  the state and from other districts about why revealing the number on the wait list. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2120.797s">So</a>  I try as much as I can to tell people whether they're in the top 10 or the top 20, and whether they should kind of hold out. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2128.281s">My</a>  best advice is always going to be that people should just make alternative arrangements. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2132.783s">If</a>  you're on the wait list, do your best to make alternative arrangements, assuming that the wait list isn't gonna move. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2138.886s">I</a>  know there are other districts that either, number one, don't do wait lists at all, <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2143.243s">number</a>  two cap their wait lists at 10 students knowing that the chances of anybody more than 10 probably isn't going to get in. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2151.469s">We</a>  haven't done that partially because I'm curious as everyone to know what the demand is for after school and also because you know my thinking is you just never know what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2164.597s">It's</a>  possible that <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2166.343s">you</a>  know, all sorts of things could shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2167.905s">And</a>  so even though somebody is number 23 on the waitlist, if enough people move or come up with alternatives, they might still get in. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2174.492s">And</a>  so I find that information valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2177.515s">So</a>  we haven't opted to move to the waitlist cap, but it's something that we might consider if other districts, say, are proving that it's successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2189.439s">But</a>  that's my explanation for why we don't reveal people spots on the waitlist. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2193.501s">But</a>  as far as transparency, the lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2195.721s">I'm</a>  happy to to make that as transparent as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2200.843s">I'll</a>  make sure that the step by step is on the waitlist. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2202.764s">I</a>  can do that this week because I know that I've written it out before. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2205.445s">So</a>  if it's not on our <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2206.705s">new</a>  website, I'll make sure that it gets on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2209.146s">And</a>  look for me again in the spring, when I present to school committee and let them know when the lottery, the lottery will be sometime in early April. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2218.629s">And</a>  so when I say when that's coming, we'll be, we'll again be saying what the step by step process is for how the lottery works. <a

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2227.632s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2228.712s">Next</a>  up is Vanessa. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2231.044s">Oh,</a>  sorry, Member Ruseau and then Vanessa, you're next.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2233.725s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2234.125s">You</a>  know, the word equity is being mentioned an awful lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2238.166s">And</a>  while the definition is relatively simple, it's that people get what they need rather than people getting an equal amount of everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2246.949s">That</a>  definition is only valid when there's enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2251.911s">When</a>  there is not enough, it then becomes a policy decision about, well, when we have more demand, <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2261.121s">How</a>  are we as a committee or as a district going to decide who gets it? <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2265.847s">When</a>  I looked at that chart, I was quite surprised. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2268.891s">And</a>  frankly, if I was just a dictator, the books would be losing a lot of spots right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2276.806s">because</a>  it's not equitable right now that the Brooks has twice as many spots as the other elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2282.849s">And</a>  next year, unless we had some huge influx of 150 additional staff, I expect the Brooks to get not one more seat until the other schools are being matched. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2294.256s">That's</a>  equity, folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2295.897s">It</a>  does not mean you get what you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2297.918s">It</a>  means you get, <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2299.719s">Folks</a>  get what they need, and if there isn't enough, somebody other than the people who need it make the decision as to who gets it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2307.665s">And,</a>  you know, I was shocked by these wait lists for the other elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2313.81s">Shocked.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2314.631s">Because,</a>  I mean, my memory of conversations around this stuff is, you know, there's a couple people at this school, a couple people on the wait list at this school, and often they can get off of those wait lists. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2325.619s">And</a>  that's all fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2329.122s">You</a>  know, the Senator Jalen sent out a newsletter today about this crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2337.647s">And</a>  I can't remember the number because I didn't have, I wasn't fast enough, but it was like 18% of child care centers closed during the pandemic that did not reopen. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2348.265s">So</a>  that there isn't enough isn't really new, but the pandemic has made it far worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2354.689s">And</a>  I also did note that she listed what childcare workers are getting paid on average in the state, and we are more than double it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2365.655s">So</a>  it isn't a throw money at it problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2371.058s">Well,</a>  at some point, I suppose we could throw <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2374.158s">quadruple</a>  the pay we have right now, we'd find a lot of people who'd quit their jobs to come take those jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2380.801s">So</a>  I think equity is not some solution when there's not enough of <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2388.126s">the</a>  thing that we want to distribute. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2390.407s">And</a>  so, I'm not asking the administration right at this moment in time to talk about what next year's gonna look like, but I really hope that the distribution among the elementary schools looks a heck of a lot more equitable than it does now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrEp94TD4IM&t=2406.417s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
