1
00:00:00,171 --> 00:00:03,233
Monday, December 9th, I'll call the meeting to order at 7.03.

2
00:00:03,993 --> 00:00:10,937
Pursuant to Chapter 20 of the Acts of 2021, this meeting of the City of Medford Historical Commission will be conducted via remote means.

3
00:00:11,337 --> 00:00:16,100
Members of the public who wish to access the meeting may do so by using the Zoom link provided for in the agenda.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:24,965
No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted and public participation in any public hearing during this meeting shall be by remote means only.

5
00:00:27,448 --> 00:00:32,013
Okay, so first up on the agenda tonight, we have 56 Wareham Street.

6
00:00:33,094 --> 00:00:36,217
Our goal tonight is to vote to lift their demo delay.

7
00:00:37,818 --> 00:00:45,386
I know the subcommittee has been working hard with the property owners to mitigate the demolition for that as much as possible.

8
00:00:46,006 --> 00:00:46,887
I think we're there.

9
00:00:46,907 --> 00:00:49,069
I know Yale is here.

10
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:49,570
Hi, Yale.

11
00:00:51,514 --> 00:00:57,695
Um, so I think Doug and Peter, do you guys want to go over the plans and present them to commission and then we can take a vote.

12
00:00:59,156 --> 00:01:03,437
Um, well, 1 year went through, we commission was very satisfied with the redesign.

13
00:01:03,477 --> 00:01:04,977
We had to kind of go back and kind of.

14
00:01:05,657 --> 00:01:10,118
Rethink our assumptions, but I think the end result looks cohesive and we're satisfied.

15
00:01:10,338 --> 00:01:13,319
So, you want to give us the 3 minute summary here and we'll be good to go.

16
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:13,399
And.

17
00:01:18,697 --> 00:01:19,458
Do you want to see?

18
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:20,338
Do you want to share?

19
00:01:20,758 --> 00:01:21,478
Yeah, let me.

20
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,120
I can't make you a co host.

21
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:29,761
OK, thanks Dennis.

22
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:32,922
Yeah, we're going to give you permission so you can share your screen.

23
00:01:32,942 --> 00:01:43,826
Tell me when you see.

24
00:01:47,187 --> 00:01:47,327
Yep.

25
00:01:50,097 --> 00:01:55,692
Okay, so we discussed a few things, the major thing was to raise the roof

26
00:01:56,352 --> 00:02:14,542
of the historic house facing the front, so keeping the roof shape and the slope and everything, but basically to raise it so it becomes part of the roof of the addition in the back, which is going to continue higher because the building extends also beyond it.

27
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:20,326
And then it doesn't look like there's two separate buildings and one is higher than the other.

28
00:02:20,366 --> 00:02:21,687
It looks like it's, you know, it's

29
00:02:22,807 --> 00:02:24,328
one coherent building, right?

30
00:02:24,828 --> 00:02:26,489
So that's one thing that we did.

31
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:28,969
Then another discussion was about the windows.

32
00:02:29,029 --> 00:02:34,972
So we decided to change all the windows to be a little bit more traditional relative to what I've shown before.

33
00:02:35,092 --> 00:02:43,975
So if, you know, whatever I showed that works with the more traditional front facade, I just carried them through the rest of the building.

34
00:02:44,035 --> 00:02:45,636
So they're the two over two.

35
00:02:47,113 --> 00:02:49,715
I changed also the dormers.

36
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:56,120
I made them a little bit smaller, a little bit more traditional looking, smaller windows also.

37
00:02:59,142 --> 00:03:05,307
Before I had only this one and this one, it didn't work with the way the roof is.

38
00:03:05,447 --> 00:03:06,528
I decided that now it's

39
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:11,870
I added it because the existing house does have the two dormers on this side.

40
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:18,872
It's not quite where the existing dormer is, but this one aligns with the window that I have below in the stair.

41
00:03:20,532 --> 00:03:36,856
We discussed keeping the pilasters that exist kind of on the front facade and then repeating some kind of a detail that resembles them in the base that protrudes in the addition in the back.

42
00:03:37,936 --> 00:03:39,878
We also discussed changing the siding.

43
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:42,280
So it's all one continuous siding.

44
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:45,223
I'm showing just white horizontal siding.

45
00:03:45,243 --> 00:03:47,966
It could be anything, but I think this looks nice.

46
00:03:47,986 --> 00:03:49,107
So this is what I propose.

47
00:03:49,787 --> 00:03:51,489
But I'm showing it throughout.

48
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:56,453
And then wherever we wanted some kind of accent, that is going to be different.

49
00:03:56,493 --> 00:03:58,395
But that's not part of the historic house.

50
00:03:59,216 --> 00:04:02,639
And what other changes did we do?

51
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,022
I can show you over this just the existing house.

52
00:04:07,082 --> 00:04:12,826
Now I put it over in yellow, so you see that now this roof is now higher.

53
00:04:12,906 --> 00:04:15,407
You see the two dormers of the existing house.

54
00:04:15,427 --> 00:04:17,088
So I have two dormers.

55
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:23,132
They're not spaced quite like the existing, but they do repeat the massing of the existing house.

56
00:04:25,394 --> 00:04:27,575
And let me just take it off.

57
00:04:30,097 --> 00:04:31,338
And I think that's about it.

58
00:04:36,368 --> 00:04:41,512
Yeah, the goal was to make it feel like one continuous house.

59
00:04:41,552 --> 00:04:49,519
So we're keeping the existing, and then we're just continuing it into a bigger house beyond, which is what we tried to do.

60
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:52,753
Yeah, let me just jump in here.

61
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,534
I think EO's done a tremendous job.

62
00:04:54,574 --> 00:05:06,357
This has really been a design challenge because we're not really preserving the house per se, but it's an echo of the house and we're keeping obviously as much as we can.

63
00:05:06,997 --> 00:05:11,198
But I feel it's successful because especially with the window change, it didn't feel like

64
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:15,501
The windows in the back used to be a lot bigger, and you could really tell that it was different.

65
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:18,943
And now, obviously, you could tell that the back is new.

66
00:05:18,983 --> 00:05:19,983
It's obviously new.

67
00:05:20,043 --> 00:05:23,366
But I feel like the spirit of the front house is at least maintained to some level.

68
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:27,268
We're satisfied as a subcommittee.

69
00:05:27,308 --> 00:05:31,431
And I don't know if Eleni or Peter want to jump in, but go right ahead.

70
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,092
Yeah, I agree.

71
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,475
kind of summarizes our last discussion really nicely.

72
00:05:38,535 --> 00:05:41,776
And again, it's the look and feel is still there.

73
00:05:41,796 --> 00:05:44,977
And I think that's a preservation win.

74
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:48,938
So yeah, but I can see how this would be a really challenging project.

75
00:05:48,978 --> 00:05:52,179
I know I missed the first meeting, but I think this is a very successful design.

76
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,140
It looks so good.

77
00:05:57,241 --> 00:05:58,201
Glad you like it.

78
00:05:58,301 --> 00:06:00,802
Yeah, hopefully it's going to look like this when it's built.

79
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:07,420
It's always a little bit different, but try to stay as close as possible.

80
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:16,684
As a fellow architect, it's hard to not blow up what you did, but reimagine what you did.

81
00:06:17,004 --> 00:06:22,687
I think you did a good job on this one because it did require some radical rethinking, but keeping the spirit of it.

82
00:06:22,707 --> 00:06:23,707
I appreciate your efforts.

83
00:06:24,387 --> 00:06:24,868
Thank you.

84
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:30,270
Ed, Ryan, any comments?

85
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,920
Okay, thank you.

86
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,643
Thank you, Doug and Peter and Eleni for working on this.

87
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:44,932
I know it was a little bit of back and forth, but it looks like we, I agree Eleni, we have a nice preservation win here, so.

88
00:06:46,454 --> 00:06:51,400
Okay, so if there are no other comments, then I'll open it up for a vote.

89
00:06:53,343 --> 00:07:06,715
So for 56 Wareham Street to lift the demo delay and to proceed with the design as agreed upon by the subcommittee, I will go around and do a roll call vote as I see folks on my screen.

90
00:07:07,295 --> 00:07:07,676
Peter.

91
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:09,497
Oh, sorry.

92
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:20,587
Make a motion to make a motion that 56 Wareham has made a continuing and bonafide effort to mitigate the demo delay and to lift the demo delay on the building.

93
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:23,498
Second.

94
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,000
I heard Elainey first, I'll give it to him.

95
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:36,463
Okay, motion to approve the mitigated design for 56 Wareham Street and to lift the demo delay.

96
00:07:36,963 --> 00:07:37,343
Peter?

97
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:38,903
Yes.

98
00:07:39,764 --> 00:07:40,124
Doug?

99
00:07:40,584 --> 00:07:40,864
Yes.

100
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:41,844
Ed?

101
00:07:43,825 --> 00:07:44,886
Yes, lift the delay.

102
00:07:45,886 --> 00:07:46,286
Ryan?

103
00:07:46,606 --> 00:07:46,866
Yes.

104
00:07:47,706 --> 00:07:48,167
Elainey?

105
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:48,887
Yes.

106
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:52,393
OK, so that is 1, 2, 3, 5, 0.

107
00:07:57,595 --> 00:07:58,575
Thank you very much.

108
00:07:58,875 --> 00:07:59,635
Thank you, Yael.

109
00:07:59,715 --> 00:08:10,439
So if you could tell, I'll email Sid, but just upload the plans and I can release the permit hold in the system.

110
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,640
We'll get your letter out to you.

111
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:15,501
Thanks, Yael.

112
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:16,201
Bye.

113
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:16,602
See you soon.

114
00:08:17,422 --> 00:08:17,762
Bye bye.

115
00:08:20,573 --> 00:08:23,235
Okay, all right, thanks everybody.

116
00:08:24,476 --> 00:08:27,778
Okay, next up, we have 140 Summer Street.

117
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,420
So I can give a little background on this.

118
00:08:31,841 --> 00:08:34,763
I got a call from the building department a couple of weeks ago.

119
00:08:34,783 --> 00:08:42,229
140 Summer Street is a tiny little house that is adjacent or next door to, I think it's 156.

120
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:49,294
So we had that one on the corner that Gina did the Fumbel Design Group.

121
00:08:50,314 --> 00:08:53,497
And then they did the one to the left of it on Summer Street.

122
00:08:53,877 --> 00:08:55,839
So this is the next house down.

123
00:08:55,859 --> 00:09:01,985
So I got a call from one of the building staff members.

124
00:09:03,006 --> 00:09:09,712
And basically, they're like, we want to tear it down, but we don't want to have to wait 18 months.

125
00:09:11,553 --> 00:09:15,354
And my answer to them was, well, I don't know that it's going to be delayed.

126
00:09:15,674 --> 00:09:16,975
We need to know what's going on.

127
00:09:17,075 --> 00:09:22,656
So I encouraged them to get the application in so that we could start the process.

128
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,437
So I put them on the agenda.

129
00:09:24,537 --> 00:09:26,838
Actually, I don't have their application yet.

130
00:09:28,118 --> 00:09:36,500
But in anticipation of an application coming in and knowing that we would like to start to move them along,

131
00:09:39,561 --> 00:09:44,344
I talked to Ryan about ordering a Form B so that we could get everything kind of started and ready.

132
00:09:44,364 --> 00:09:55,289
We didn't get it in time for tonight, so for next month we'll be able to determine significance on this.

133
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,891
Do we know if it's pre-1900, Ryan?

134
00:09:57,911 --> 00:09:59,632
It definitely is.

135
00:09:59,672 --> 00:10:02,253
Yeah, it's an important building.

136
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:13,476
So the building inspector was telling me that inside the ceilings are shorter than seven feet.

137
00:10:13,997 --> 00:10:19,962
They're like, we want to do something with this house, but there's nothing we can do as it is.

138
00:10:19,982 --> 00:10:26,247
And I think with the projects to the right of it that have been

139
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,382
done over and in spirit with what's on the street.

140
00:10:31,722 --> 00:10:36,544
You know, my hope is that maybe there's kind of a consensus here.

141
00:10:39,218 --> 00:10:41,860
you know, letting these folks move forward.

142
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,221
And I don't know, I don't have anything yet.

143
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:52,567
So they actually did upload a couple of renderings in the building permit system that I just saw like 20 minutes ago.

144
00:10:52,587 --> 00:10:58,710
If you guys want me to share them, I can show them to you what it looks like, but we don't officially have an application.

145
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:02,633
So it might be a little premature.

146
00:11:02,653 --> 00:11:04,714
I don't think we should waste our time.

147
00:11:05,215 --> 00:11:05,555
Okay.

148
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:16,523
Yeah, so, but anyway, I think they're starting to think about what they want to go there and, you know, what they want to replace this house with.

149
00:11:18,404 --> 00:11:20,364
So, so just keep that in mind.

150
00:11:20,384 --> 00:11:25,306
And we, we did put the order in Ryan for the Form B. Okay.

151
00:11:25,966 --> 00:11:26,226
Okay.

152
00:11:26,707 --> 00:11:30,748
So I'm going to table this till next month, but that's the background and what's happening there.

153
00:11:36,441 --> 00:11:36,741
OK.

154
00:11:38,902 --> 00:11:42,504
Ryan, do you want to tackle anything next in a certain order?

155
00:11:42,564 --> 00:11:47,186
We have the preservation ordinance discussion, our meeting dates, officer positions.

156
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:51,808
Let's do the rest of the other stuff before we get into the ordinance.

157
00:11:52,989 --> 00:11:53,249
OK.

158
00:11:53,749 --> 00:11:54,309
That'll be easy.

159
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,130
All right.

160
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:00,032
Why don't we start with the officer positions and boards and committees?

161
00:12:03,651 --> 00:12:09,132
So we had a little discussion behind the scenes about officers.

162
00:12:09,713 --> 00:12:17,314
And I am trying to take a little bit of a step back, just in the sense of the administrative work that's happening.

163
00:12:17,955 --> 00:12:30,778
So we talked about adding a second vice chair, so that I'm happy to still stay as chair, run the meetings, and kind of be like the,

164
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:40,220
you know, I don't know, face of the commission, for lack of a better description, like when it comes to trying to navigate things in City Hall and whatnot.

165
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:50,910
And Ryan and Eleni has graciously offered to be a second vice chair so that they can tackle the administrative work.

166
00:12:52,552 --> 00:13:05,780
And kind of like the emails and some of that stuff and I'm going to keep doing the permitting stuff and being the liaison with the building department since I have, I don't want to interrupt that connection that we've made there.

167
00:13:08,943 --> 00:13:11,104
What am I missing in this discretion, Ryan?

168
00:13:12,004 --> 00:13:12,324
Nothing.

169
00:13:12,344 --> 00:13:22,148
So the only changes that we made to the list are that Eleni will be first vice chair and I will be second vice chair.

170
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:27,831
And then Doug, I have your comments in there that I incorporated into the local design review.

171
00:13:27,871 --> 00:13:28,971
We added Eleni to that.

172
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,174
Anything else?

173
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:39,068
No, not on my end.

174
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:41,110
Yeah, comments, questions?

175
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:48,516
I move to approve the slate of officers as amended as just discussed.

176
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,278
Do you mind putting it on screen, Ryan, just so everyone can just take a quick look at it?

177
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:55,662
There's actually a ton of positions when you think about it.

178
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,991
Yeah, we like divide up the work.

179
00:13:58,011 --> 00:14:02,895
Yeah, I just, it's a nice, like summary document, how we divide up our work.

180
00:14:03,115 --> 00:14:06,518
I actually like that everyone really has a lot of pieces on this.

181
00:14:06,598 --> 00:14:07,579
Everyone wears a lot of hats.

182
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:09,681
I think that's, that's not typical for a lot of boys.

183
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:11,302
And I really appreciate that for everyone.

184
00:14:11,502 --> 00:14:22,225
Well, and one of the things we were talking about was that, you know, when before I came on the commission, like Ryan did like the majority of the heavy lifting.

185
00:14:22,705 --> 00:14:28,287
And then, you know, I feel him and I have really tried to almost be co-chairs.

186
00:14:28,527 --> 00:14:28,787
Right.

187
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:33,528
And we like we can easily come in and for each other and we know what needs to get done.

188
00:14:33,968 --> 00:14:40,850
And we were talking that it makes sense to bring in a third so that there's just a level of continuity and that

189
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:47,198
You know, I'm so proud of our board that all of us take a role and we're all active.

190
00:14:47,819 --> 00:14:52,024
And I think even more so like if something were to happen, like, you know,

191
00:14:53,412 --> 00:15:02,115
You know, you see other examples of boards and committees where like something happens to one of their staff and then they just don't meet for months because the other people don't know what to do.

192
00:15:02,575 --> 00:15:13,439
And I think it's important for us to just have people like, you know, if something were to happen, you guys know how to run the meeting, you know how to contact Dennis and file the agenda and whatever.

193
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:15,740
And so I think anything we can do to just

194
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:22,425
keep the train moving and having backups and backups and having other people there.

195
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:29,811
Because our stuff, if we don't meet, it could really affect property owners and developers.

196
00:15:31,592 --> 00:15:32,593
Time is money, right?

197
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:40,820
So we need to keep our train moving, I think, more than maybe some other commissions, for lack of a better way to say that, if that makes sense.

198
00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:42,505
Now, this is great.

199
00:15:43,186 --> 00:15:44,046
I really liked it.

200
00:15:44,606 --> 00:15:48,467
Every board should have a level of redundancy, and I think you're adding to that, which I think is fantastic.

201
00:15:50,468 --> 00:15:55,910
I don't know if my markups, Ryan, actually use the word design.

202
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:56,630
I don't know.

203
00:15:56,751 --> 00:15:57,031
Is that a...

204
00:15:58,169 --> 00:16:00,850
Yeah, so I divided it up.

205
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:06,072
You guys are the, I say design committee for the design subcommittee.

206
00:16:06,092 --> 00:16:15,356
Demo delay, this is really us for garages and just making sure that they're not confirming that they're not carriage houses.

207
00:16:15,836 --> 00:16:21,078
And then permit review is really just Jen asking you and Peter if you want to

208
00:16:21,418 --> 00:16:22,199
go or pass.

209
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,343
And Eleni could be on this too as well.

210
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:29,011
Sometimes Jen throws it at Eleni, sometimes she throws it at me.

211
00:16:29,892 --> 00:16:34,279
So it just really is who the person of the day is, really.

212
00:16:35,736 --> 00:16:39,860
Yeah, just trying to like, yeah.

213
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,203
If something's really questionable, I have Ryan look at it first and then I might throw it out to you guys.

214
00:16:44,223 --> 00:16:44,964
Like, what do you think?

215
00:16:45,364 --> 00:16:46,225
Yeah.

216
00:16:46,245 --> 00:16:54,092
But I feel like, you know, there's the way that they've done the permits now in the system where there's like kind of major review and minor review.

217
00:16:56,314 --> 00:16:57,655
It's a little bit easier to

218
00:16:59,206 --> 00:17:03,589
like say yes, yes, yes, because it's like not our wheelhouse.

219
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:09,532
So as you guys have noticed, like some of them are easy calls, I feel.

220
00:17:09,832 --> 00:17:11,513
So anyway.

221
00:17:13,114 --> 00:17:16,096
Okay, do we need a motion to vote on this?

222
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:26,842
Still moved to approve this slate of officers and committee members as displayed

223
00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:29,908
Second.

224
00:17:30,989 --> 00:17:35,770
Okay, motion to approve the 2025 Historical Commission slate of officers.

225
00:17:36,691 --> 00:17:37,091
Peter?

226
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,111
Yes.

227
00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:39,112
Doug?

228
00:17:39,632 --> 00:17:39,912
Yes.

229
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:40,772
Ed?

230
00:17:42,653 --> 00:17:43,013
Yes.

231
00:17:44,093 --> 00:17:44,494
Ryan?

232
00:17:44,874 --> 00:17:45,154
Yes.

233
00:17:45,914 --> 00:17:46,434
And Eleni?

234
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:47,134
Yes.

235
00:17:47,815 --> 00:17:48,675
Okay, great.

236
00:17:49,655 --> 00:17:51,996
Because Kit's not here, we should have made her like, you know.

237
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:52,957
Right.

238
00:17:53,497 --> 00:17:55,678
Czar of the world or something.

239
00:17:55,698 --> 00:17:56,378
She's in charge.

240
00:17:57,658 --> 00:17:58,758
Fundraising committee.

241
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,161
She's now paying the tab of every time we go out.

242
00:18:05,181 --> 00:18:11,163
I could get Steve gas, right?

243
00:18:11,263 --> 00:18:13,884
Ryan, do you want to pull up the 2025 meeting dates?

244
00:18:14,124 --> 00:18:15,765
Yep, doing that next.

245
00:18:25,368 --> 00:18:25,969
Here we are for 2025.

246
00:18:28,452 --> 00:18:52,136
January 13th, February 10th, March 10th, April 14th, May 12th, June 9th, July 14th, August 11th, September 8th, October 6th is a contingency, October 20th moves it for the holiday, November 11th is a Tuesday this year, so we actually can meet on Monday the 10th, unless we wanna move it, but I don't think we should, and December 8th.

247
00:18:53,876 --> 00:18:56,817
Do we need, okay, so should we plan to meet

248
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,892
Alright, this is the only is the 13th.

249
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:07,436
So is the contingency the 6th or the contingency is the actual meeting?

250
00:19:07,656 --> 00:19:09,417
The contingency is the 20th.

251
00:19:09,517 --> 00:19:10,778
The contingency is the 6th.

252
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:15,641
We don't need it if because it's left that we don't need it unless we need to meet that 30 day deadline.

253
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:17,302
OK.

254
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:20,905
Because this year was the opposite, yes.

255
00:19:24,885 --> 00:19:31,148
Okay, but yeah, I agree that we should still meet on the 10th of November.

256
00:19:31,168 --> 00:19:35,931
Okay.

257
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:37,592
Yeah, these all look good to me.

258
00:19:39,653 --> 00:19:43,975
I move to approve the 2025 meeting dates.

259
00:19:46,396 --> 00:19:46,756
Second.

260
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:53,200
Are you taking the motion, Ryan, or you want me to?

261
00:19:54,335 --> 00:19:57,377
No, I took the motion and then you can second it if you want.

262
00:19:58,158 --> 00:19:58,778
I seconded it.

263
00:20:03,342 --> 00:20:04,583
So who's taking the roll call vote?

264
00:20:04,643 --> 00:20:04,983
Me or you?

265
00:20:05,023 --> 00:20:05,484
That's you.

266
00:20:05,624 --> 00:20:06,044
No, you.

267
00:20:06,144 --> 00:20:06,244
OK.

268
00:20:06,264 --> 00:20:07,285
So all right.

269
00:20:07,345 --> 00:20:10,528
So roll call vote to approve the 2025 meeting schedule.

270
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:10,968
Peter?

271
00:20:11,748 --> 00:20:12,069
Yes.

272
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:13,049
Doug?

273
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:14,270
Yes.

274
00:20:14,871 --> 00:20:15,071
Ed?

275
00:20:17,213 --> 00:20:17,513
Yeah.

276
00:20:18,254 --> 00:20:18,694
Ryan?

277
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:19,314
Yes.

278
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:20,295
Eleni?

279
00:20:20,876 --> 00:20:21,216
Yes.

280
00:20:22,377 --> 00:20:22,577
Great.

281
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,541
Dennis, I will send you this list so that we can get the city calendar populated.

282
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:33,982
Okay, I see your thumbs up, thanks.

283
00:20:41,443 --> 00:20:50,825
Okay, do we need to talk about the position opening, Ryan, that we were gonna go over the description?

284
00:20:51,839 --> 00:21:07,267
Oh, uh, yeah, I think, um, I think I will send around, um, for next month, uh, between now and then we should just review the press release that we do, uh, for while we're looking for new members.

285
00:21:07,647 --> 00:21:09,748
So we have that all lined up and ready to go.

286
00:21:09,908 --> 00:21:14,011
So that at like, say the six month mark, when we're in, um,

287
00:21:16,286 --> 00:21:22,630
into 2025, we can just ask the mayor to put it on the city's distribution list and we can send it around.

288
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:27,153
Um, yeah, I think that's that's about it.

289
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:39,421
And I did ask for Peter and kids, uh, terms to be renewed because their term expired December one of this year.

290
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:44,524
So, um, I had you guys have you guys reappointed for a three year term?

291
00:21:45,385 --> 00:21:45,525
So

292
00:21:47,911 --> 00:21:49,091
You're with us for the next three years.

293
00:21:49,332 --> 00:21:50,652
Yeah, you can't leave.

294
00:21:53,373 --> 00:21:54,274
I will if I can.

295
00:21:54,734 --> 00:21:56,214
Just a formality.

296
00:21:57,895 --> 00:22:01,256
As long as you are able to, Peter, we would love to have you.

297
00:22:01,817 --> 00:22:04,018
Yes.

298
00:22:05,478 --> 00:22:14,482
And then do we need to check the website, Ryan, and the city's website on those term end dates?

299
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,501
Just because they're always wrong.

300
00:22:17,521 --> 00:22:20,164
I was just looking for those.

301
00:22:21,665 --> 00:22:24,108
On our website or on the city website, our website.

302
00:22:26,615 --> 00:22:27,675
I don't know if I don't.

303
00:22:27,755 --> 00:22:31,816
I'm sure they're on our website somewhere, but the city website is where they're usually wrong.

304
00:22:31,856 --> 00:22:36,477
Yeah, our website is usually correct because I keep track of it.

305
00:22:38,078 --> 00:22:45,780
It's where the city decides to appoint terms willy nilly and they may have paperwork that supports their dates, but they're not the right dates.

306
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,341
As a third of the Commission has to expire every year to be in compliance, so.

307
00:22:54,302 --> 00:22:55,742
Yeah, OK, we'll work on that.

308
00:22:56,281 --> 00:23:01,466
All right, so I'll send out the description between now and next meeting so we can take a look at that.

309
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,188
Get that rolling.

310
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:06,451
And then there's a process with the mayor.

311
00:23:06,471 --> 00:23:08,293
You apply through the mayor's office.

312
00:23:09,094 --> 00:23:12,257
I mean, they can still apply through us if we want to do it that way.

313
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:18,444
And you do know that you'll be consulting with us forever as our resident attorney.

314
00:23:19,991 --> 00:23:26,116
So the city's website says that Peter's term expired eight days ago, as it is, no, as is next year.

315
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:29,738
That's not right.

316
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:30,479
Yeah.

317
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:34,842
Kit should, should have, according to my record.

318
00:23:34,862 --> 00:23:36,143
You just said Kit and Peter.

319
00:23:36,183 --> 00:23:37,984
So that means the city website might be correct.

320
00:23:38,505 --> 00:23:38,785
Yeah.

321
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:39,565
For once.

322
00:23:39,866 --> 00:23:42,187
Or at least, at least these two terms are correct.

323
00:23:42,808 --> 00:23:43,348
Yeah.

324
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:45,730
Okay.

325
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:49,693
All right, Ryan, do you want to talk about the preservation ordinance?

326
00:23:50,114 --> 00:23:51,135
Yep, I do.

327
00:23:51,155 --> 00:23:52,176
All right.

328
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:55,699
So I sent out information a little while ago.

329
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:07,611
I think, in general, we need to give the city every available tool possible to help them

330
00:24:10,362 --> 00:24:16,767
create housing while not undermining our efforts for historic preservation.

331
00:24:16,927 --> 00:24:32,839
So I sent along a couple of, I think last meeting I sent the North Reading Ordinance, which is specifically geared towards relief, zoning relief for properties that focus on

332
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:41,446
historic buildings, but there are other towns that have different bylaws that would kind of connect to this one.

333
00:24:41,966 --> 00:24:53,515
For example, Redding has a municipal code that allows, by right, the conversion of any of their single-family homes constructed before 1942 to a two-family

334
00:24:56,157 --> 00:25:03,263
by special permit if they need to change the square footage of the building, but otherwise they can just do it by right.

335
00:25:03,943 --> 00:25:09,408
And if they have to have a special permit, the trade-off is that once you've made that addition,

336
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:13,452
You are not allowed to add more to it.

337
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:17,094
In other words, somebody can't go back and continuously add more.

338
00:25:17,235 --> 00:25:18,495
It's a one and done deal.

339
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:28,763
And if you demo the building that existed prior to 1942, after you've converted it over into a two-family, the two-family use ceases.

340
00:25:28,823 --> 00:25:31,885
So you have to maintain the existing building.

341
00:25:32,766 --> 00:25:33,826
Medford has

342
00:25:35,173 --> 00:26:00,554
what they call a plan development district process, where if there was a need to have an older building kind of conform to zoning, the city can change the zoning for an individual property or a group of properties to make it conforming, but it's not really small project friendly, whereas the, you know,

343
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:05,937
The North Reading ordinance that I sent around is more small project friendly.

344
00:26:05,977 --> 00:26:14,021
It's more geared towards smaller buildings and making sure that the conversion process is, you know, it's not geared towards major development.

345
00:26:14,081 --> 00:26:19,244
It's it's geared towards their communities, which is smaller and more not as dense as ours.

346
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:27,708
But you know, it's not something that we certainly couldn't tweak or look at coming into play for all of this in February.

347
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:30,770
The state passed the accessory dwelling unit.

348
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:31,470
law.

349
00:26:32,211 --> 00:26:39,436
So it's going to allow the city to take ADUs to the next level, I hope.

350
00:26:40,417 --> 00:26:53,687
And it removes a lot of the previous limitations that communities were enforcing, like it no longer allows you to limit the occupancy to homeowner-occupied main buildings or ADUs.

351
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:55,348
You can rent them.

352
00:26:55,808 --> 00:26:59,111
It does limit the size of an ADU to 900 square feet.

353
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:00,052
That doesn't mean that the

354
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:08,134
They can't be bigger at the local level, but it really encourages density in existing neighborhoods.

355
00:27:08,174 --> 00:27:12,435
It encourages people to use carriage houses and garages.

356
00:27:12,515 --> 00:27:21,577
Basically, almost an invisible background increase in density while not really changing the landscape of the neighborhood.

357
00:27:21,597 --> 00:27:23,677
You're not coming in and building big buildings.

358
00:27:23,697 --> 00:27:25,038
You're using what's already there.

359
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:30,419
Or if you are building a building, it's small and at scale or smaller than the existing neighborhood.

360
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:50,852
So, you know, and I just provided a couple of reasons, you know why we might want to consider this demo this ordinance, such as adding much needed housing stock encourages the reuse of existing buildings creates because the units are smaller, it creates something that's a little bit more affordable to first time families or.

361
00:27:51,352 --> 00:27:53,653
young couples or seniors.

362
00:27:55,174 --> 00:28:10,600
And it may work in collaboration with CPC funding, depends on, you know, if they can maybe take advantage of the housing, you know, the housing component of it to maybe buy out an affordable restriction on it or something like that, so.

363
00:28:12,748 --> 00:28:14,689
So that's my thoughts.

364
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:38,144
I'm interested in if people had a chance to take a look at the bylaw that I sent around, because I would be interested in bringing it to, I know Dennis and Alicia already kind of checked up on this, but it'd be good to maybe bring it to their attention to see if it'd be something that the zoning board would support, and then we'd just work it up the ladder at that point.

365
00:28:40,646 --> 00:28:44,990
So do you think that we should create a preservation ordinance?

366
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,191
Is that what your thoughts are?

367
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:50,095
Yeah, so this is why does zoning have anything to do with it?

368
00:28:50,455 --> 00:28:53,077
Well, it's a it's a tool for zoning, right?

369
00:28:53,097 --> 00:28:54,198
So they would be the one.

370
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:57,842
So it would be under our.

371
00:28:59,262 --> 00:29:12,387
I think the right place for it would be under the Chapter 48 Historic Preservation Bylaw, but it would be a tool for the zoning bylaw because it's zoning relief in that case.

372
00:29:12,428 --> 00:29:21,931
A lot of times they used to say, and Doug correct me if I'm wrong, they used to say that really historic preservation was not a reason for granting zoning relief.

373
00:29:23,712 --> 00:29:35,816
at least the North Reading Ordinance gives them the direct power to say historic preservation is a tool in this case that they can use for leverage for the public good and for a neighborhood.

374
00:29:35,836 --> 00:29:41,218
You know what kind of relief we're talking about?

375
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:45,940
A lot of times it's dimensional, could be height, could be setback.

376
00:29:47,417 --> 00:30:09,745
big in some cases in the case of north reading in but a lot of cases they specifically say if there's an existing building on the site their priority number one is to keep that building and to work new construction understanding that there is problems created by leaving that building that they give relief to the new construction provided that they leave the existing building alone

377
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:16,068
Or at last resort, they move it somewhere on the site, not off the site.

378
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:18,329
The priority is always to keep the existing building.

379
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:29,376
So say you had the opportunity to take a building, move it over six inches, and get a large development on site, like three, four, five more units.

380
00:30:29,656 --> 00:30:38,761
Not that that's going to happen, but that is where you can say, all right, rather than move the building, we can just give you dimensional relief on the new construction.

381
00:30:41,916 --> 00:30:45,119
Yeah, because most existing are nonconforming.

382
00:30:47,421 --> 00:30:54,947
But I mean, they're not to play devil's advocate, but they're often are nonconforming, but they're always grandfathered in.

383
00:30:56,968 --> 00:31:00,371
It's hard for me to see what this changes.

384
00:31:01,232 --> 00:31:01,913
Yeah, I want.

385
00:31:02,513 --> 00:31:05,435
I tried to read their code and I

386
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:17,732
not being a lawyer and not being really super savvy at real estate, I just couldn't figure out what it meant, to be honest with you.

387
00:31:18,072 --> 00:31:24,577
So that's why I'm curious as to what it really does, because I couldn't figure it out.

388
00:31:25,742 --> 00:31:45,255
Yeah, I do have a call into their board, because I have to get a hold of whoever their chair is, because I want to have somebody come talk to us about how they utilize this, both from the Historical Commission, because they're involved, but also their zoning board.

389
00:31:45,275 --> 00:31:51,179
I think both of those kind of work hand in hand, and how many cases they've had, and what sort of cases they've had, and why they created it.

390
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:54,195
Yeah, yeah, that was my question.

391
00:31:54,235 --> 00:31:56,657
Ryan is they've got a track record now.

392
00:31:56,697 --> 00:31:58,358
This is this is not a new ordinance, right?

393
00:31:58,379 --> 00:32:03,783
They've got a 1995. yeah, so that's, that's, you know, almost 30 years.

394
00:32:03,803 --> 00:32:11,029
It's like, this should be some, especially in the last 5 or 10 years when when the pressure on housing and the pressure on.

395
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:19,578
accessory dwelling units and just maximizing the potential of sites seems like it's never been greater.

396
00:32:20,058 --> 00:32:21,560
I want to know the same thing.

397
00:32:22,381 --> 00:32:23,262
What's the result?

398
00:32:23,582 --> 00:32:25,304
Are there any lessons learned?

399
00:32:25,324 --> 00:32:29,768
Did the ordinance do what you said or did it go sideways on a few cases?

400
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,972
How many units did it actually generate?

401
00:32:33,889 --> 00:32:35,130
Yeah, that's a good question.

402
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:45,053
I think in the time from 95 to today, the community has really been on the ball.

403
00:32:45,274 --> 00:32:47,875
I haven't seen much change.

404
00:32:48,135 --> 00:32:53,557
Where normal communities you might see large parcels and stuff turn into subdivisions, they've really

405
00:32:54,438 --> 00:32:57,001
you know, they've really kind of slowed their role.

406
00:32:57,041 --> 00:33:06,752
There are things that change, there are subdivisions that go in and move, but not to the pace that the inner ring suburbs kind of see that destruction.

407
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:08,254
So I'd be really interested to know,

408
00:33:10,341 --> 00:33:30,000
know that and i do know that they i do know that they meet their public housing threshold because they stopped a 40b project fairly recently it was they had the a save the ipswich river campaign and they found that they were very much they very much met their affordable housing threshold so

409
00:33:30,744 --> 00:33:32,344
Yeah, I think we need to talk to them.

410
00:33:32,404 --> 00:33:33,105
I agree with that.

411
00:33:33,705 --> 00:33:36,886
But I also think, you know, obviously we're not doing this in a vacuum.

412
00:33:36,906 --> 00:33:41,207
There's so many people in the city of Medford who need to be educated on this.

413
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:49,989
So I, I don't know, we almost, this is like a, it feels like a year long campaign to actually, you know, between city council and zoning and.

414
00:33:50,489 --> 00:33:55,771
Well, I want to know, is any of this being tackled in the current zoning overhaul that they're already working on?

415
00:33:56,589 --> 00:34:11,218
So there's got to be something because the state, the moment that the state bylaw, and Dennis maybe you'll know, the moment that the state bylaw goes into effect for the ADU, it immediately overrides all of the local prescriptions.

416
00:34:11,318 --> 00:34:19,543
So like any of the restrictions that are not, that are enforceable at the higher level, for example, you can no longer restrict

417
00:34:20,524 --> 00:34:24,667
to homeowner occupancy and the ADU that gets abolished at all the local levels.

418
00:34:25,168 --> 00:34:30,532
So, you know, there will have to be a revision if there's not already one started.

419
00:34:30,592 --> 00:34:40,259
And I know the today's meeting at the Metropolitan Planning Council, they basically said that there were a lot of the towns are already well on their way to revising it.

420
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:43,462
So it wouldn't surprise me if city council has already started

421
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:47,705
looking at here's the changes and here's what's going to propose.

422
00:34:47,765 --> 00:34:57,092
I think it would be good just maybe to have a sit down meeting too with the commission and the planning board and say, yes, what else is happening?

423
00:34:57,112 --> 00:35:07,180
Hey, we have this idea, can we roll this into all this other stuff that you're doing so that we can say you're not missing a key item in your toolbox?

424
00:35:11,184 --> 00:35:24,113
Yeah, I'm always in favor of updating zoning ordinances like this just to make them more reflective of current housing needs, development trends, that sort of thing, and just make ordinances generally more flexible.

425
00:35:26,075 --> 00:35:37,163
So would this be a process that we work with the planning department of the city to help write, or are we just making recommendations?

426
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:56,234
I think at some point, rather than, I would normally say that we could probably take a stab at writing, but I don't see the need to if the mayor's office and the planning department will okay working with KP Law.

427
00:35:56,294 --> 00:36:01,735
I mean, Robin Stein, when she came to us for, when we were having issues with the

428
00:36:02,675 --> 00:36:05,536
administration of the demo delay, she always said reach out.

429
00:36:05,676 --> 00:36:17,081
So, you know, if we can take advantage of KP Law's expertise, and they represent a number of municipalities, they would know, you know, other communities that have these type of bylaws.

430
00:36:17,121 --> 00:36:18,722
There's no need to reinvent the wheel.

431
00:36:18,922 --> 00:36:23,744
And, you know, we can pick and choose from the best communities and say, you know, here's what works, here's what doesn't.

432
00:36:23,804 --> 00:36:27,566
You know, not just Redding, but like, you know, all of Massachusetts.

433
00:36:28,566 --> 00:36:34,347
And we might as well ping Massachusetts Historical Commission and just say, we're thinking about this.

434
00:36:34,747 --> 00:36:37,948
Who else has this type of bylaw?

435
00:36:37,968 --> 00:36:50,910
Because Jen Daugherty, who's the chair of the Local Preservation Commission Outreach, is doing a really good job on all of her, basically sharing what all the communities are doing across the state.

436
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:55,231
So this sounds like it might be another good topic for her to explore with us.

437
00:36:56,754 --> 00:37:08,929
I feel like we should get to Alicia or City Council ASAP because I feel like City Council is about to roll out zoning changes and I'm worried that we missed the boat.

438
00:37:12,025 --> 00:37:38,796
even if they roll out zoning changes first of all i don't want to if this if this change is a potential redundancy to something that they've already planned it is fine and you know show us the key and show us the way to get it you know to roll out this in another way but if it's not and they just say okay no this isn't redundant but we didn't think about this i think it's fine to present it to the community with another change you know rather than just simply roll it out with everything i do

439
00:37:40,277 --> 00:37:41,718
I don't want it to get lost.

440
00:37:41,798 --> 00:37:45,539
I want the general public to know that it's available to them.

441
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:49,381
I certainly want to be transparent about that.

442
00:37:49,861 --> 00:37:54,322
I know everybody says that a lot of change is happening.

443
00:37:54,423 --> 00:37:57,764
So I'd almost want it to roll out by itself.

444
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:05,287
Dan, my understanding from these conversations with Alicia and Danielle in the planning department

445
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:30,342
unrelated to store commission stuff is that there's a, I would say it's a, an openness, uh, to, I mean, to, if somebody has an idea for zoning at a certain site and they like it, they're going to build that zoning around that, you know, because they want, it's, it's kind of driven almost by what they think is a reasonable approach for density and mark, you know, uh,

446
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,996
number of units and all kinds of things.

447
00:38:33,036 --> 00:38:34,877
So I feel like I agree with Ryan.

448
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:41,282
I don't think it's not a hard and fast date for zoning that I can see from my conversation with Alicia.

449
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,383
It appears to be a rolling thing that's going to happen.

450
00:38:44,103 --> 00:38:47,386
It's going to be accelerated over the next year, but I don't think we're going to miss anything.

451
00:38:47,446 --> 00:38:53,490
If we get this into the mix and we take our time doing it, it's going to pay dividends if we can get people behind it.

452
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,871
And I think there's a lot to offer here.

453
00:38:55,731 --> 00:38:58,974
I don't quite know where the 1942 cutoff comes from, Ryan.

454
00:38:59,014 --> 00:39:01,916
I don't know if that's from Reading, or what do you think about that?

455
00:39:02,136 --> 00:39:07,641
I think that was originally when they wrote their, well, for 42 from 95, I don't know.

456
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:11,804
That might have been 50 years, but I don't know.

457
00:39:12,144 --> 00:39:14,606
95, no, it might have been close to 50 years.

458
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:18,149
That might have been the date that they had taken back in the day.

459
00:39:18,169 --> 00:39:20,190
I would say 75 years or older.

460
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,411
I would just leave it at that.

461
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:24,751
Why?

462
00:39:25,011 --> 00:39:25,851
What's driving that?

463
00:39:25,891 --> 00:39:29,793
Why would you not take a 1970s building and turn it into a two-family if it made sense?

464
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,914
I'm just curious.

465
00:39:32,554 --> 00:39:35,195
It's about preserving history.

466
00:39:35,795 --> 00:39:40,257
We have to certify, so as part of the reading, if you read through the whole thing,

467
00:39:40,577 --> 00:40:08,316
as part of it the historic commission certifies that the building is a historic building national park services definition immediately starting they usually don't look at anything fifty years or all younger unless it's an extraordinary case so you know usually something that's fifty years or older that's fine i mean i'm i'd be good with fifty years if if we want to do a rolling date on that uh... you know but we're gonna there's like a

468
00:40:09,478 --> 00:40:13,025
a disconnect at that point than from the demo delay.

469
00:40:13,045 --> 00:40:19,517
If we don't have a project to the ability to review it, then why give them the tool to go along with it?

470
00:40:20,817 --> 00:40:41,668
make sense i will say i will say yeah the to build zoning that's the plan development district that i mentioned that the city can certainly alter their zoning to meet the demands of a particular parcel and a particular project plan for that parcel but it's not it's not small project friendly i think it's very there are

471
00:40:42,848 --> 00:40:47,930
restrictions and limitations and they can waive things for projects less than 5,000 square feet or something like that.

472
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:54,371
But, you know, something a little bit friendlier that makes some things easier.

473
00:40:55,372 --> 00:41:03,314
You know, we could even say, you know, it says two-family, you know, we could even say three-family, you know, but then it kicks in a different code, right?

474
00:41:03,434 --> 00:41:09,696
So, as you know, the move from two to three units is a big difference.

475
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:19,347
You know, we could say, you know, you could say two in a detached ADU, you know, because then it's technically two separate buildings.

476
00:41:22,289 --> 00:41:22,529
So.

477
00:41:22,909 --> 00:41:31,176
So I think our next step should be to check with Medford to see if they're even tossing any of this around and if the answer is no.

478
00:41:32,941 --> 00:41:37,863
Well, assuming it's no, we should get, you know, talk to Redding and talk to whoever.

479
00:41:37,883 --> 00:41:49,987
Yeah, let's hop in on the department meetings for the planning department to start, because I think that would be good to know where everybody would go and whether they think it's a good idea.

480
00:41:50,167 --> 00:41:59,610
If it's in with everything else, we can loop in Zach and say, you know, after that, we loop in Zach and say to city council, here's what we're thinking.

481
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,711
Would this be something you entertain?

482
00:42:02,698 --> 00:42:03,959
You know, did you think about this?

483
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:09,941
And if we get the green light on moving forward with it, then we can talk to reading, see what their track record is.

484
00:42:10,401 --> 00:42:14,703
You can ask gender already to see if there are other communities that I should be talking to to come to our meeting.

485
00:42:15,203 --> 00:42:17,064
And I suggested this to Jen earlier.

486
00:42:17,084 --> 00:42:19,705
I think we should have a board meeting.

487
00:42:20,325 --> 00:42:21,606
You know, it can be a posted meeting.

488
00:42:21,806 --> 00:42:32,953
Anybody can come just talking about where all of our different responsibilities are in the new year, like, you know, where does I'm sure some of you guys think of, like, where does section 106 come from and where does our.

489
00:42:35,475 --> 00:42:39,857
Where do we fall within the comments of planning review or site plan review?

490
00:42:40,497 --> 00:42:45,559
I think maybe just taking an evening and just talking about those responsibilities might not be a bad thing.

491
00:42:46,379 --> 00:42:50,341
No set agenda, just talking about all of our roles and responsibilities.

492
00:42:52,001 --> 00:42:52,922
Just a refresher.

493
00:42:53,462 --> 00:42:56,443
Yeah.

494
00:42:57,123 --> 00:42:58,984
We could even do that in person if we wanted to.

495
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:11,502
Oh, one of the things we forgot to talk about, Ryan, the meeting dates, is people's thoughts on getting together in person again.

496
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:13,543
Oh, yeah.

497
00:43:14,323 --> 00:43:23,345
Like, what are people... Ryan and I maybe tossed out, like, every other month or, you know, giving it six months and I don't know.

498
00:43:23,405 --> 00:43:24,165
What do you guys think?

499
00:43:24,925 --> 00:43:26,166
I mean, I'm not gonna lie.

500
00:43:26,286 --> 00:43:31,587
I like to be home, but... Doug, how does... It's also nice to hang out in person, too.

501
00:43:32,266 --> 00:43:35,347
CPC has use of the city staff.

502
00:43:35,788 --> 00:43:38,148
Is it Teresa that manages the OWL or is it?

503
00:43:38,429 --> 00:43:38,749
It is.

504
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:45,512
We've had about 50% participation in CPC in person versus remote.

505
00:43:46,232 --> 00:43:48,373
And I'm not going to lie, that starts at 630.

506
00:43:48,473 --> 00:43:50,974
It's much harder for me to make that in person.

507
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:59,734
But also Mondays I'm in the car and the rest of the week I'm in Boston on a T. So it's a little, sure it's different for everyone.

508
00:43:59,855 --> 00:44:02,837
So I mean, we should try it, but I think we need to have the capacity, obviously.

509
00:44:02,857 --> 00:44:09,423
It's just like the people attending in person or remote, because we're getting a really mix of both for CPC.

510
00:44:09,443 --> 00:44:11,745
And that's for most of the last, most of this year, actually.

511
00:44:13,948 --> 00:44:26,616
Well, one of the things that we haven't looked at either is like just even room availability, you know, since, you know, we used to obviously have 201, like pretty much standard.

512
00:44:26,676 --> 00:44:32,900
And I don't know now, you know, who's booking what and when and all that, so.

513
00:44:33,821 --> 00:44:35,722
Well, Dennis would be able to tell us that.

514
00:44:35,742 --> 00:44:43,467
Yeah, I mean, we can check, but I don't know, Peter, Eleni, what do you, do you guys have any thoughts on meeting in person?

515
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:57,073
I mean, maybe if it's, you know, a meeting where, I don't know if it would work better if there are a lot of members of the public present or if it would work better if it was just us and we had like other items to discuss like the zoning ordinance.

516
00:44:58,134 --> 00:45:01,235
But yeah, I'd be open to doing it, you know, here and there.

517
00:45:01,255 --> 00:45:07,638
Yeah, as long as people have the ability to tune in.

518
00:45:07,678 --> 00:45:07,758
Yeah.

519
00:45:09,058 --> 00:45:10,599
Because I feel like it's,

520
00:45:13,433 --> 00:45:14,935
People are all about convenience.

521
00:45:14,955 --> 00:45:24,927
I just wouldn't want to exclude people because they can't get down there.

522
00:45:33,088 --> 00:45:34,469
older or whatever, I don't know.

523
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:37,131
I think we have to have the online capability.

524
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,434
Yeah, it's got to be a hybrid, like if we're meeting in person.

525
00:45:40,474 --> 00:45:42,495
Not first on the agenda, but fifth.

526
00:45:42,555 --> 00:45:45,257
I mean, she'd be down there for like an hour and a half or two hours.

527
00:45:45,397 --> 00:45:48,580
I don't know how local she is actually.

528
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,001
She could be traveling a half hour.

529
00:45:50,901 --> 00:45:52,383
It's just so much more convenient.

530
00:45:52,423 --> 00:45:53,624
We get more participation.

531
00:45:54,344 --> 00:45:55,525
virtual, I know that.

532
00:45:55,705 --> 00:45:57,306
We definitely do.

533
00:45:57,766 --> 00:46:00,368
It's really about us interacting more than anything else.

534
00:46:00,468 --> 00:46:01,769
I agree with Aline.

535
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:06,392
If we have a city department or we want to be across the table, I think there's some value there.

536
00:46:06,492 --> 00:46:12,676
But I guess I wouldn't do it just to do it unless we really had something really drawing us there.

537
00:46:16,178 --> 00:46:23,182
Like the policy refresher talks that you were talking about, Ryan, or something like the zoning ordinance, I think would be productive in person.

538
00:46:24,415 --> 00:46:41,456
I don't yeah I think the members of the public like being able to just tune in whenever they they can because you know we've all been to commission meetings where you know you're there for like three hours and or if you're presenting you're like you know the last one on the agenda that's like excruciating so.

539
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:56,448
All right, so why don't we say maybe then if we have a demo delay that we know is getting a lot of attention, maybe the public hearing could be in person.

540
00:46:56,508 --> 00:47:00,010
So if people want to come either in person or digitally via Zoom, they could.

541
00:47:00,511 --> 00:47:05,134
If we have any policy, like we're having that meeting with, like,

542
00:47:05,934 --> 00:47:08,216
By law, and that's gaining traction ordinance.

543
00:47:08,416 --> 00:47:10,477
I think the right word is ordinance in Medford.

544
00:47:11,698 --> 00:47:21,025
Then we can certainly have a public hearing on that so that the public can come in person or via zoom because, you know, as we know, not everybody uses zoom.

545
00:47:21,225 --> 00:47:23,587
So some people may want to physically voice their opinion.

546
00:47:24,076 --> 00:47:40,685
But we definitely need, you know, if I assume or Dennis or somebody need a staffer to technology side has to be there because it's, it's back and forth, you know, there's, there's a little bit more work to make those meetings actually function to have a true hybrid meeting.

547
00:47:41,285 --> 00:47:45,948
And they have the tools in the city, but if someone's got to set it up, it's got to be set up, it's got to be working.

548
00:47:46,768 --> 00:47:51,432
The Wi-Fi is going to be working and sometimes the presentations and CPC are in person.

549
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,774
Sometimes we're online and it's pretty seamless.

550
00:47:53,835 --> 00:47:55,756
Teresa is very good on the technology.

551
00:47:56,377 --> 00:47:59,900
And so she's been able to, she's like the master of ceremonies of those meetings.

552
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,865
She's running things a lot in within the meeting, you know, that's key.

553
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:08,252
Yeah, so we'll have to coordinate that.

554
00:48:08,312 --> 00:48:21,347
If we think we might want to do one, obviously we'll have to work with, you know, Dennis and anybody at, you know, scheduling and making sure that we have somebody, not only a room, but somebody available to help us as well.

555
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:26,662
Yeah, because the last thing I would want to have happen is that it's not well run.

556
00:48:26,682 --> 00:48:33,565
Yeah, I get the feeling like Historic District Commission, their staff person, Jess Martinez.

557
00:48:33,985 --> 00:48:37,627
I mean, at some point they have they have four new people on coming on their board.

558
00:48:38,087 --> 00:48:42,089
It would be great to get them to transition to a hybrid meeting.

559
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:50,393
I mean, they meet in person, which is good, but they just need to continue on with the zoom, the zoom component of it too as well so.

560
00:48:51,865 --> 00:48:56,709
And, you know, obviously CPC will, you guys will continue on with that, so.

561
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:02,993
Yeah, and it's easier to record and put it on MCM, too.

562
00:49:03,513 --> 00:49:03,774
Yeah.

563
00:49:04,634 --> 00:49:08,016
Yeah, my first experience with the OWL was up in Bedford Town Hall.

564
00:49:08,037 --> 00:49:14,481
It's really cool how it tracks the people that are speaking and grabs the board and kind of displays, so it's neat.

565
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:16,442
It did have one brief problem where it was,

566
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:22,187
Oh, painting off the wall in the meeting.

567
00:49:22,207 --> 00:49:23,929
So they were frozen.

568
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:27,715
Yeah, Richard Lee was coming back.

569
00:49:27,735 --> 00:49:30,619
He was there in spirit, if not in person.

570
00:49:30,739 --> 00:49:32,241
That's hilarious.

571
00:49:32,281 --> 00:49:32,842
That's funny.

572
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:43,871
I just real quick back to the, the ordinance that we were discussing for preservation and had his hand up at the very beginning.

573
00:49:43,911 --> 00:49:49,479
I wasn't sure if he had anything that he wanted to add to the discussion while he was there.

574
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:52,043
I know he's up walking around, but he.

575
00:49:53,736 --> 00:49:55,237
I didn't know if he had anything to add.

576
00:49:56,557 --> 00:49:58,258
I had nothing particular.

577
00:49:58,338 --> 00:50:11,322
I think I had some observations last month about, again, the relationship between easements and whatever the historic body is, but that was about it.

578
00:50:12,053 --> 00:50:39,696
Yeah, and I did see that it is residential only, and because Medford has much more commercial than North Redding, I mean, North Redding has a nice little community core, but Medford has a lot of little sub-villages like Haynes Square and West Medford, and as we know, with the city trying to increase the density in some of those locations, we might want to consider the need to include commercial properties in this, you know,

579
00:50:41,158 --> 00:50:45,661
Anyways, because we would, you know, you want to encourage mixed use development.

580
00:50:46,322 --> 00:50:49,024
That's just normal for inner city buildings, so.

581
00:50:52,786 --> 00:50:53,687
Okay, great.

582
00:50:55,148 --> 00:50:57,670
Does anybody have any more new business for tonight?

583
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:02,862
Okay, so move on to old business.

584
00:51:03,962 --> 00:51:05,703
Properties under demo delay.

585
00:51:05,783 --> 00:51:08,924
The only one we'll have left after tonight is 27 Allmont.

586
00:51:09,925 --> 00:51:12,165
Peter and Doug, did you guys meet with them?

587
00:51:12,466 --> 00:51:14,006
You wanna give us an update?

588
00:51:14,026 --> 00:51:21,529
Yeah, we met with the gentleman.

589
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:27,011
He had an interesting angle, I'll say.

590
00:51:27,071 --> 00:51:27,931
He wanted us to...

591
00:51:31,227 --> 00:51:35,789
He essentially wanted to do an end around on the demo delay.

592
00:51:35,809 --> 00:51:50,456
I forget exactly what his angle was, but oh, I know he wanted to build the back building first over 18 months and then demo the whole house right after that.

593
00:51:52,477 --> 00:51:58,520
So I said, well, you're still gonna have to apply for a demolition permit to demo that building.

594
00:51:59,347 --> 00:52:09,971
So I said, well, you can apply for it now, or you can apply for it in 18 months, but then it just, you know, whenever you apply for the demolition permit, that's what triggers our board.

595
00:52:10,011 --> 00:52:24,296
So I said, we couldn't just like, give it to you on a technicality because then I told him that every developer on the East coast would be coming over and figured out how to get around the historical commission, you know?

596
00:52:24,356 --> 00:52:28,097
So he seemed like by the end of the meeting, he was kind of,

597
00:52:29,219 --> 00:52:32,326
maybe open to it, but I couldn't tell for sure.

598
00:52:32,587 --> 00:52:39,782
Like maybe open to working with us and trying to maybe incorporate the existing building into a design.

599
00:52:41,022 --> 00:52:52,231
Yeah, I mean, it's a demo delay, so it's no permits are issued until the demo delay expires or until we believe that he's made a modified effort.

600
00:52:52,291 --> 00:52:59,137
So his thoughts on trying to proceed with a building permit to build the building as opposed to...

601
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,381
just waiting out the delay doesn't work.

602
00:53:06,841 --> 00:53:18,564
If he wanted to do that, I would entertain that contingent that he withdraw his current proposal with the understanding that he start over upon application.

603
00:53:19,324 --> 00:53:24,765
So if he applies to demo the building again in the future, he starts over and has wasted six months, eight months.

604
00:53:28,046 --> 00:53:31,867
But I'm not sure that he totally understood what we're saying.

605
00:53:33,614 --> 00:53:35,275
Eleni, did you have any comments on this?

606
00:53:35,315 --> 00:53:58,994
Yeah, I think by the end of the conversation, my understanding was that he understood that he couldn't do that and seemed open to incorporating the original building into the new design once we kind of highlighted what we would like to see preserved and certain features, like character-defining features of the building.

607
00:53:59,735 --> 00:54:02,137
So we'll see if that sunk in.

608
00:54:03,594 --> 00:54:06,016
I mean, it's really just the forward mass.

609
00:54:06,136 --> 00:54:11,619
I think that that's, you know, it's not a huge component, you know.

610
00:54:11,919 --> 00:54:21,404
There's obviously three bedrooms or two bedrooms in that space now, you know, so build an addition to the back of that and, you know, and build up.

611
00:54:21,484 --> 00:54:27,067
I mean, he was there, he witnessed the kind of process we went through with Yale.

612
00:54:28,488 --> 00:54:29,388
Yeah.

613
00:54:29,789 --> 00:54:32,010
And about raising the roof and all that.

614
00:54:33,422 --> 00:54:37,505
I think he kind of caught onto that raising the roof thing.

615
00:54:38,686 --> 00:54:40,007
Anyway, we'll see.

616
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:41,248
We'll see if he comes back.

617
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:46,892
It can't be a cookie cutter solution.

618
00:54:46,912 --> 00:54:48,253
He's proposing to build a building

619
00:54:49,403 --> 00:54:58,710
now that would literally touch the back of that building, right, which is, as Per Ryan said, that's not the spirit or the letter of what their ordinance says.

620
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:04,754
So he was trying, you know, once we disabused him of that direction, that that was not going to be a successful direction.

621
00:55:04,774 --> 00:55:08,536
I think, as Eleni said, we started thinking that you got to

622
00:55:09,477 --> 00:55:19,422
work with us a little bit, be creative about the front house, come back with some ideas like Yale did, really good ideas, and she got through it.

623
00:55:19,442 --> 00:55:22,784
It took a few tries, but it wasn't for a lack of effort.

624
00:55:23,604 --> 00:55:25,085
It was a challenging situation.

625
00:55:25,165 --> 00:55:26,166
It needed a designer.

626
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:28,227
Right.

627
00:55:29,147 --> 00:55:32,209
Yeah.

628
00:55:32,249 --> 00:55:35,991
Anyway, that'll work itself out, so we should just move on, I think.

629
00:55:36,451 --> 00:55:36,711
Okay.

630
00:55:37,311 --> 00:55:38,152
Thanks for that update.

631
00:55:39,858 --> 00:55:43,360
Um, Ryan, are there any form B's that we need to order?

632
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:45,121
I think we're caught up on everything.

633
00:55:45,782 --> 00:55:46,822
No, I ordered them.

634
00:55:47,563 --> 00:55:47,863
Okay.

635
00:55:47,883 --> 00:55:50,845
Form B for 140 Summer Street.

636
00:55:51,065 --> 00:55:53,026
And did you want to talk about four Grove?

637
00:55:53,987 --> 00:55:55,668
Oh, yeah, for Grove Street.

638
00:55:56,468 --> 00:55:58,469
Um, so they've been working on this house.

639
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:01,271
I drive by it four times a day.

640
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:01,351
And

641
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:12,329
I come home from vacation last week and the whole front porch had been ripped off and poorly replaced.

642
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:18,296
So I sent a note to the billing department and I said, hey, what's happening here?

643
00:56:18,316 --> 00:56:20,919
And then they went out and looked at it and they said,

644
00:56:22,525 --> 00:56:28,952
Not only were they not supposed to do that, but what they built was so poorly done and didn't have the proper footings.

645
00:56:29,593 --> 00:56:33,718
He's like, yeah, the whole thing's going to be coming off again, and they're gonna have to redo it.

646
00:56:34,098 --> 00:56:37,482
And he's like, I'm making them get an engineer to do the whole thing.

647
00:56:37,562 --> 00:56:40,886
So they were going to stop what was happening there.

648
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:45,816
So it was really unfortunate because the front porch was beautiful.

649
00:56:45,856 --> 00:56:54,087
It had these beautiful like triple columns on each side and and the base of the porch had some was covered but

650
00:56:55,631 --> 00:57:02,958
When I saw it all stripped off, there were big piles of boulders in the front lawn.

651
00:57:02,998 --> 00:57:11,327
And I thought, oh, no, it had like a stone foundation like the other house on Grove Street that we looked at.

652
00:57:11,387 --> 00:57:14,170
And so when I said something to the building department,

653
00:57:15,655 --> 00:57:16,855
And he's like, do you have pictures of that?

654
00:57:16,895 --> 00:57:18,656
I said, no, but I just saw the stones.

655
00:57:18,696 --> 00:57:24,758
He's like, well, yeah, that's a fair assertion that it probably had those stones, you know, so.

656
00:57:25,118 --> 00:57:26,878
And the columns were let go?

657
00:57:26,958 --> 00:57:28,079
They tossed the columns?

658
00:57:28,999 --> 00:57:29,339
Oh, yeah.

659
00:57:29,439 --> 00:57:36,101
Now there is a single, like, pressure-treated post, and they put plastic lattice around the bottom.

660
00:57:36,121 --> 00:57:38,722
It's awful.

661
00:57:39,782 --> 00:57:40,362
It's awful.

662
00:57:40,862 --> 00:57:43,323
Like, all the historic detail on that porch is gone.

663
00:57:44,488 --> 00:57:45,669
Yeah, that was a nice porch.

664
00:57:45,769 --> 00:57:47,490
It's still on Google Maps.

665
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:48,350
Yes, it is.

666
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:49,811
It is still on Google Maps.

667
00:57:49,971 --> 00:57:52,672
Wouldn't that be our inspiration for the restoration?

668
00:57:53,032 --> 00:57:55,914
Yes, it will be once they come before us.

669
00:57:56,534 --> 00:57:57,595
What's the address again?

670
00:57:57,615 --> 00:57:59,536
4 Grove Street.

671
00:57:59,816 --> 00:58:01,457
It's sort of almost on the corner, right?

672
00:58:01,977 --> 00:58:04,238
It's right on the corner of High Street.

673
00:58:04,258 --> 00:58:04,698
Yeah.

674
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:07,900
And they added on a couple of little shed dormers at the top.

675
00:58:09,804 --> 00:58:15,009
Which I'm pretty sure I approved because they, you know, they've been working on this house for a while.

676
00:58:15,089 --> 00:58:19,173
In fact, I was, you know, for a while, I'm like, what are they doing?

677
00:58:19,213 --> 00:58:20,394
It's taking them forever.

678
00:58:20,434 --> 00:58:24,358
And they had the windows open for a long time, like, and it was starting to get cold.

679
00:58:24,398 --> 00:58:27,421
I'm like, they better, they better button up this house, you know.

680
00:58:29,979 --> 00:58:39,729
So, you know, I'm like, well, they're just taking a little time and they're, you know, and they've, they've, you know, kind of trimmed up the trees now and they took that hedge line out in front.

681
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:49,380
Used to be you come to the end of the Grove Street and you couldn't see around the corner because there was a hedge line and they took it all out and they trimmed up the trees to the second story of the house.

682
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,982
So now you have a nice, beautiful view of the house.

683
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:58,215
And the porches, if you guys drive over here, you're going to see how horrible it is.

684
00:58:58,276 --> 00:59:00,498
You can see it on Google Street View pretty easily.

685
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:02,460
Yeah, the original one.

686
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,982
But what's there now is just horrific.

687
00:59:05,002 --> 00:59:06,023
That's right.

688
00:59:06,544 --> 00:59:11,069
So anyway, so that'll be coming before us at some point when they get their act together.

689
00:59:17,065 --> 00:59:18,706
Permits are going well.

690
00:59:18,826 --> 00:59:19,326
I don't know.

691
00:59:19,486 --> 00:59:20,486
I feel like I forgot.

692
00:59:20,506 --> 00:59:22,487
I missed last month's meeting, so I didn't tell you guys.

693
00:59:22,927 --> 00:59:24,867
I had a great meeting with the building department.

694
00:59:26,748 --> 00:59:29,889
They meet every Wednesday at, I think, 4 or 4.30.

695
00:59:29,929 --> 00:59:32,010
So I was invited to come to their meeting.

696
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:40,532
And I sat down and talked to them and talked about kind of the things we look for and just encouraged communication.

697
00:59:40,632 --> 00:59:42,193
And I gave them all my cell phone number.

698
00:59:43,433 --> 00:59:50,640
vice versa we had a really good meeting we we were there for about an hour just talking through things and you know I just said you know

699
00:59:51,826 --> 00:59:58,371
They didn't have to be the bad guys if there was a problem with something, like it's on us to work with the property owner.

700
00:59:58,391 --> 01:00:09,979
And I think, you know, Scott is really, the commissioner is, you know, understands what our purview is and what we're trying to do.

701
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:16,284
And, you know, he came from, I think it was Gloucester or Salisbury.

702
01:00:16,384 --> 01:00:18,686
So he's very familiar with working

703
01:00:19,326 --> 01:00:20,447
with historic commissions.

704
01:00:21,088 --> 01:00:22,169
So anyway, it was a good meeting.

705
01:00:22,189 --> 01:00:24,271
I feel like we're in a really good place with them.

706
01:00:27,174 --> 01:00:30,137
So just want to keep the lines of communication open there.

707
01:00:30,517 --> 01:00:32,920
So it's all good.

708
01:00:37,284 --> 01:00:38,966
Ryan, any update on the cemetery?

709
01:00:38,986 --> 01:00:42,309
Oh, you're muted.

710
01:00:44,832 --> 01:00:45,772
Whoops, that was weird.

711
01:00:46,993 --> 01:00:50,634
Just to let people know, I sent some pictures around too on Redfin or Ford Grove.

712
01:00:52,174 --> 01:01:02,778
For Cross Street, I called the consultant to see where they were to try to put the foot in motion for finishing up that assessment project.

713
01:01:03,418 --> 01:01:06,879
So should be finished, need to be finished by the end of the year.

714
01:01:06,999 --> 01:01:08,860
So I'm hoping that they'll be finished by the end of the year.

715
01:01:10,001 --> 01:01:18,127
The consultant is under contract as is the excavator under contract for the former cross street site.

716
01:01:18,267 --> 01:01:22,951
So I'm just trying to set up a startup meeting with the archaeologist and the.

717
01:01:25,088 --> 01:01:31,511
City departments to get in the ground, hopefully before winter is becomes too bad.

718
01:01:31,591 --> 01:01:32,851
It's been snowing.

719
01:01:32,911 --> 01:01:39,014
So obviously winter is threatening and, um, up north country, they've gotten a lot of snow.

720
01:01:39,094 --> 01:01:41,435
So I'm thinking winter is going to come in pretty quickly.

721
01:01:42,055 --> 01:01:52,500
So, but, uh, PAL who got hired for that project is pretty confident that they are, um, that they can do it as long as the ground doesn't freeze.

722
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:52,560
So.

723
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:55,754
Should be good.

724
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:03,552
Thomas Brooks Park, I forget where we left off on that.

725
01:02:04,492 --> 01:02:08,954
So the archaeologist component of the project went out to bid.

726
01:02:08,974 --> 01:02:20,139
I have two bids, one from PAL and one from SWCA, which is a firm out in Amherst, Massachusetts.

727
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,700
I am reviewing proposals.

728
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:27,882
Would anybody like to help me review the other proposal?

729
01:02:28,482 --> 01:02:29,043
Happy to.

730
01:02:30,827 --> 01:02:34,689
I just need a second body to kind of review their scope of work.

731
01:02:35,849 --> 01:02:44,813
And, uh, confirm the findings cause it's, it's so very close that I just, I need a second set of eyes on it for the procurement officer.

732
01:02:45,693 --> 01:02:47,034
When do we have to get back to them by?

733
01:02:47,894 --> 01:02:48,955
We don't have a deadline.

734
01:02:49,035 --> 01:02:51,316
It's in our own wheelhouse.

735
01:02:51,416 --> 01:02:54,177
Ideally we would get back to them within the next 30 days or so.

736
01:02:54,197 --> 01:02:55,918
Oh, I can do it.

737
01:02:56,778 --> 01:02:56,918
Okay.

738
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:02,565
All right, I'll send you over the proposals tonight and you can read through them at your leisure.

739
01:03:02,585 --> 01:03:03,526
Okay.

740
01:03:05,288 --> 01:03:10,434
So we should be, we'll just have to confirm which consultant we're going with.

741
01:03:11,803 --> 01:03:12,884
And then we can get that started.

742
01:03:13,004 --> 01:03:16,148
I did start to poke the city on tree work.

743
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:28,139
They're a little bit hesitant, but a little bit difficult to get Aggie Tudin out there and Tim McGivern, the DPW director out there to review the scope of work.

744
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:33,164
But I'm gonna, as soon as the archaeologist is under contract there,

745
01:03:33,985 --> 01:03:37,286
Scope assumes they're not going to start until spring 2025.

746
01:03:38,427 --> 01:03:44,950
So as soon as I have them under contract, I can turn my full attention to bidding out that tree work, because the tree work can be done in the middle of winter.

747
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:48,431
I think it should be done in the wintertime while the ground is frozen.

748
01:03:52,218 --> 01:03:53,039
Yeah, hopefully.

749
01:03:53,999 --> 01:03:57,322
Well, they're going to get rid of the some of the deadwood that's on the ground, right?

750
01:03:58,623 --> 01:04:00,445
Deadwood on the ground, deadwood in the trees.

751
01:04:00,465 --> 01:04:02,006
You should be able to see widow makers.

752
01:04:02,666 --> 01:04:05,789
You should be able to see all the dead foliage and pick it out really quickly.

753
01:04:05,809 --> 01:04:13,215
While there's no foliage on the trees, you'll be able to clearly see the dead trees that are in the park and what needs to come down immediately.

754
01:04:13,235 --> 01:04:15,516
It's kind of like an all inclusive.

755
01:04:16,437 --> 01:04:17,438
pretty hefty budget.

756
01:04:17,638 --> 01:04:30,845
And if I go out to bid, I'm kind of hoping that actually the bid might come in cheaper because in the instance of the excavation, when I went out to bid, it actually came in cheaper than I thought it was going to be.

757
01:04:31,086 --> 01:04:38,270
So yeah, my only thought was if there's if we end up with a couple of feet of snow on the ground, it might be hard to see the piles of trees that are there.

758
01:04:38,330 --> 01:04:38,470
But

759
01:04:38,972 --> 01:04:47,558
Yeah, as long as the I think I'm mainly concerned about the trees up overhead the rest of the stuff once it gets down to the ground can be cleaned up in the early spring.

760
01:04:47,638 --> 01:04:49,359
I mean, even if they have to divide their work.

761
01:04:49,479 --> 01:04:53,481
I know they're not gonna want to, but we may just have to say.

762
01:04:55,175 --> 01:04:59,796
you gotta come back and do a final cleanup in the springtime, even if you don't wanna mobilize.

763
01:04:59,856 --> 01:05:10,918
But for the archeology component of it, it's beneficial to have it in there while the ground is frozen, because it's not gonna make a mess, like really frozen, not just like soft frozen.

764
01:05:12,078 --> 01:05:12,338
So.

765
01:05:12,738 --> 01:05:12,998
Okay.

766
01:05:15,118 --> 01:05:18,979
Well, I'm hoping for a not super snowy winter, but we'll see.

767
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:19,679
Yep.

768
01:05:21,579 --> 01:05:22,360
Cold is fine.

769
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,420
Not snowy would be great.

770
01:05:27,169 --> 01:05:30,214
Okay, anything on the survey projects, Ryan?

771
01:05:31,096 --> 01:05:32,338
Yes, I have.

772
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:45,609
We applied for, let's do the other one, I applied for the S&P grant for Hastings Park and Hastings Heights.

773
01:05:46,349 --> 01:05:50,914
So we should be hearing back from them relatively soon.

774
01:05:50,934 --> 01:05:57,880
And then Eleni and I will look at the large application that we get if we get selected and do that.

775
01:05:58,581 --> 01:05:59,721
do that application.

776
01:05:59,741 --> 01:06:04,443
For Sagamore Vale, we had two proposals.

777
01:06:05,643 --> 01:06:16,506
I did not qualify the first proposal that I received because they did not include a comprehensive scope of work, so that left Claire Dempsey and John

778
01:06:18,166 --> 01:06:45,034
john clemson as the only qualified proposer and the lowest qualified bidder so we selected them and it's in the hands of fiona who just has to review the information and i'll follow up with her i believe she was on vacation when i sent it to her so i'll just follow up and make sure we can get them under contract because i'm hoping to get them to start work in january and then they'll have six months to finish the project great

779
01:06:47,755 --> 01:06:52,419
Okay, does anybody have anything else before we go over the meeting minutes?

780
01:06:56,322 --> 01:06:58,564
No, okay, Peter circulated the meeting minutes.

781
01:07:00,866 --> 01:07:01,426
Motion to approve.

782
01:07:02,107 --> 01:07:02,988
Okay, thanks Ryan.

783
01:07:03,008 --> 01:07:05,850
Second.

784
01:07:09,914 --> 01:07:14,437
Okay, motion to approve the meeting minutes from November 2024.

785
01:07:18,683 --> 01:07:19,404
So moved.

786
01:07:21,185 --> 01:07:21,606
Thanks, Ed.

787
01:07:21,626 --> 01:07:23,347
I'm going to go around and do a roll call vote.

788
01:07:23,407 --> 01:07:23,747
Peter?

789
01:07:25,909 --> 01:07:26,730
You're on mute, Peter.

790
01:07:31,093 --> 01:07:32,314
OK, Doug?

791
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:33,655
Yes.

792
01:07:34,476 --> 01:07:34,656
Ed?

793
01:07:38,058 --> 01:07:38,419
Yes.

794
01:07:39,259 --> 01:07:39,660
Ryan?

795
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:40,200
Yes.

796
01:07:40,781 --> 01:07:41,161
Eleni?

797
01:07:41,681 --> 01:07:41,981
Yes.

798
01:07:42,722 --> 01:07:43,623
OK, great.

799
01:07:45,141 --> 01:07:49,422
Um, just a reminder of our holiday get together.

800
01:07:50,663 --> 01:07:52,223
Tuesday the 17th.

801
01:07:53,384 --> 01:07:56,005
And we're still going to go to Great American Beer Hall is the plan.

802
01:07:56,025 --> 01:07:58,525
I have to call them.

803
01:07:59,066 --> 01:08:02,487
Yeah, we should probably call them and get a make sure that they can accommodate us.

804
01:08:03,127 --> 01:08:03,727
I believe there's.

805
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:09,209
I believe everybody can go plus Teresa and Dennis.

806
01:08:09,269 --> 01:08:11,750
Yeah, I don't think Dennis is available this year.

807
01:08:12,933 --> 01:08:21,038
Dennis has a, remind me, Dennis, it's a show you're going to down in New York, I wanna say?

808
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:22,980
Or is it Boston?

809
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,742
Yeah, and that's the thing I was talking about earlier when I screwed up the dates.

810
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:27,443
Oh, all right.

811
01:08:28,123 --> 01:08:28,483
Yeah.

812
01:08:30,024 --> 01:08:32,666
Okay, fine, we'll miss you.

813
01:08:33,006 --> 01:08:34,107
We get Teresa this time.

814
01:08:34,127 --> 01:08:36,269
All right, so there's eight of us then.

815
01:08:36,829 --> 01:08:37,109
Yes.

816
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:38,010
Okay.

817
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,081
I think on a Tuesday night they're going to need a reservation for that.

818
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:43,883
Well, just making sure they don't have another party or something.

819
01:08:44,904 --> 01:08:52,168
Yeah, Teresa told us that we should ask them to reserve a spot up on their upper deck, because they have like an upper upper area that.

820
01:08:53,008 --> 01:08:57,011
They have that supposedly really nice, so OK, I'll give them a call.

821
01:08:59,452 --> 01:09:00,953
OK, does anybody have anything else?

822
01:09:03,755 --> 01:09:05,636
OK, motion to adjourn at 812 PM.

823
01:09:09,133 --> 01:09:09,694
All moved.

824
01:09:10,236 --> 01:09:10,597
Okay.

825
01:09:11,138 --> 01:09:11,960
Motion to adjourn.

826
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:12,421
Peter?

827
01:09:13,163 --> 01:09:13,503
Yes.

828
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:14,365
Doug?

829
01:09:14,826 --> 01:09:15,147
Yes.

830
01:09:15,668 --> 01:09:15,869
Ed?

831
01:09:17,613 --> 01:09:17,954
Yes.

832
01:09:18,756 --> 01:09:19,157
Ryan?

833
01:09:19,497 --> 01:09:19,758
Yes.

834
01:09:20,279 --> 01:09:20,660
Eleni?

835
01:09:21,221 --> 01:09:21,682
Yes.

836
01:09:22,464 --> 01:09:22,765
All right.

837
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:24,649
See you guys next week.
