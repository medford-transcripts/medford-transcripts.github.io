[SPEAKER_19]: Check, check two.

[SPEAKER_19]: Check microphone one, two, microphone one, two, one, two.

5
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:10,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Collins.

[SPEAKER_10]: I see her on zoom, I'm going to mark her as present because I see her on zoom.

00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:19,189

[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor saying, President bears present seven present and absent, please rise to salute the flag.

11
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:49,054
[SPEAKER_18]: Communications from the mayor to 4468 submitted by Mayor Brianna lingo current draft city charter as amended by city council on April 8 2025.

12
00:18:51,992 --> 00:19:16,983
[SPEAKER_18]: We have before us tonight, the draft city charter proposal as amended by the council on April 8 2025 and referred to this special meeting as follow the submission of the mayor by the mayor of an amended draft on March 31 2025 that followed the approval by the council on March 11 by a six zero vote, one absent of a draft charter referred from committee of the whole after governance committee review.

13
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:24,670
[SPEAKER_18]: If approved by the council, this draft charter as amended by the council will be resubmitted to the mayor for consideration for submission to the legislature.

14
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:41,613
[SPEAKER_18]: Subsequently, if the mayor submits a draft city charter to the legislature and the legislature approved said draft prior to the printing ballots for the November 4th, 2025 municipal election, the voters of the city will approve or deny the draft city charter on the November 4th, 2025 municipal election ballot.

15
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:44,994
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Lemming.

16
00:19:47,106 --> 00:19:47,486
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

17
00:19:47,506 --> 00:20:06,148
[SPEAKER_16]: I do realize that we have a few other things to discuss regarding this but I would like to bring up some very last minute edits that I don't believe were discussed previously to previously in the charter.

18
00:20:08,495 --> 00:20:26,668
[SPEAKER_16]: I would like to make a motion to amend Article 3, Section 3.1 to delete the word consecutive, amend Section 4-1 to add subsection e to say no person shall be

19
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:41,168
[SPEAKER_16]: elected to the office of school committee member for more than eight terms and to elect section two and then section two dash one to add subsection D to say no person shall be elected the office of city councilor for more than eight terms.

20
00:20:45,068 --> 00:20:52,710
[SPEAKER_16]: It was pointed out to me that the survey that was put out by the charter study committee, which we have discussed a lot here, but

21
00:20:53,637 --> 00:21:09,161
[SPEAKER_16]: that I think they did have a skewed sample, but still a majority of respondents did say that they would like to see term limits for city councilors.

22
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:19,164
[SPEAKER_16]: We have term limits for the mayor in there, so I would like to motion to add in the eight term limits, so a total of 16.

23
00:21:20,598 --> 00:21:24,280
[SPEAKER_16]: years in order to keep that consistent.

24
00:21:26,941 --> 00:21:40,527
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would also like to delete the word consecutive just because I think that it is the case from, I did a bit of research on this.

25
00:21:40,587 --> 00:21:45,250
[SPEAKER_16]: It is the case that in other municipalities, they do have a ban against

26
00:21:46,664 --> 00:21:56,388
[SPEAKER_16]: multiple consecutive terms, but I, from what I've seen, it's mostly like other municipalities more commonly have 12 year limits on these sorts of positions.

27
00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:02,491
[SPEAKER_16]: So there is, so you can have, serve for 12 years, be forced to take break and then continue serving.

28
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:05,412
[SPEAKER_16]: But in this case, we'll have 16 year limits.

29
00:22:05,752 --> 00:22:10,354
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I think that I just, I just feel like having that

30
00:22:11,755 --> 00:22:16,021
[SPEAKER_16]: having somebody serve for 16 years, take a break for two or four years and serve another 16.

31
00:22:16,161 --> 00:22:18,364
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't really make sense to me.

32
00:22:20,808 --> 00:22:22,991
[SPEAKER_16]: But anyway, that's my motion.

33
00:22:23,211 --> 00:22:23,491
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry.

34
00:22:24,312 --> 00:22:25,394
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a motion.

35
00:22:25,734 --> 00:22:26,656
[SPEAKER_18]: The first one was 3-1-C.

36
00:22:29,031 --> 00:22:29,771
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

37
00:22:30,052 --> 00:22:32,493
[SPEAKER_16]: Remove a consecutive from 3-1-C.

38
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:54,225
[SPEAKER_16]: It was, sorry, it was, I'll check just to make sure that I have my sections right, but it was essentially to, the intent of the motion is to make it so that currently the way it's written is, I believe it says, although I may, I believe I was looking at the latest version, but it says that the mayor can't serve

39
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,181
[SPEAKER_18]: More than one C reads no person shall be elected to the office of mayor for more than four consecutive terms.

40
00:23:00,282 --> 00:23:06,883
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, and I wanted to yes and the motion was to remove consecutive from three one C. Yes.

41
00:23:07,143 --> 00:23:07,443
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

42
00:23:09,784 --> 00:23:23,408
[SPEAKER_16]: Which is kind of a different discussion but the, the other part of the motion was essentially to add on term limits for school committee members and okay city councilors so is there a specific so you would amend to one.

43
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:36,219
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, so section 2.1 add subsection D to say no person shall be elected to the office of city council for more than eight terms, which a total of 16 years in that case.

44
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:48,662
[SPEAKER_16]: And section 4.1 to add in subsection E to say no person shall be elected to the office of school committee member for more than eight terms.

45
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,260
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

46
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,221
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's one motion, not three motions.

47
00:24:00,304 --> 00:24:02,886
[SPEAKER_16]: I can split into separate motions if we want to discuss it.

48
00:24:02,926 --> 00:24:04,667
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the question I'm asking you.

49
00:24:04,927 --> 00:24:07,429
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyone else can make a motion to sever if they'd like.

50
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:07,969
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

51
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:08,890
[SPEAKER_18]: One motion then.

52
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:09,890
[SPEAKER_18]: One motion.

53
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:09,990
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

54
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:12,272
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a second?

55
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:17,915
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

56
00:24:20,857 --> 00:24:23,539
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to do all the motions and all the discussion.

57
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:25,633
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm gonna take the motions in order.

58
00:24:25,653 --> 00:24:31,355
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there anything I have, Councilor Lazaro?

59
00:24:34,356 --> 00:24:35,716
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if this is the moment.

60
00:24:36,196 --> 00:24:41,878
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a comment on Councilor Lemming's motion.

61
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:43,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a separate motion.

62
00:24:43,218 --> 00:24:45,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

63
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:50,100
[SPEAKER_04]: This is about the mayor on the school committee.

64
00:24:52,189 --> 00:24:56,692
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a few things I want to say about that.

65
00:24:56,712 --> 00:25:13,603
[SPEAKER_04]: I very much understand why Vice President Collins suggested that we remove the mayor from the school committee, a plurality of people who responded to the CSC survey suggested that they

66
00:25:14,622 --> 00:25:16,722
[SPEAKER_04]: would prefer the mayor not be on the school committee.

67
00:25:17,022 --> 00:25:19,743
[SPEAKER_04]: It was something like 45% of the people surveyed.

68
00:25:19,763 --> 00:25:22,283
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't a scientific survey, but it was something that we were going on.

69
00:25:23,984 --> 00:25:28,305
[SPEAKER_04]: The CSC based a lot of the suggestions that they offered on that survey.

70
00:25:29,105 --> 00:25:38,026
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a good thing to start on, but they did not use that answer for their recommendation.

71
00:25:39,367 --> 00:25:41,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it seemed like things were,

72
00:25:42,213 --> 00:25:56,885
[SPEAKER_04]: And the recommendations were cherry picked based on what was the preference of various members because of their expertise, because of their background, because of reasons complicating why we all choose to believe the things that we believe.

73
00:25:58,686 --> 00:26:05,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Members of our current school committee have expressed to me reasons why they think that the mayor should not be a member of the school committee.

74
00:26:06,484 --> 00:26:18,969
[SPEAKER_04]: And members of our school committee have expressed to me that they would like the school committee to reflect the city council's composition, which have been roundly ignored.

75
00:26:19,689 --> 00:26:24,651
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the things that our school committee members have expressed as preferences have been roundly ignored.

76
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:29,733
[SPEAKER_04]: I find that really frustrating.

77
00:26:29,753 --> 00:26:34,355
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that our school committee deserves

78
00:26:35,487 --> 00:26:40,690
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot more attention when we are having these conversations.

79
00:26:43,592 --> 00:26:56,019
[SPEAKER_04]: However, we are, unfortunately, reaching a point where we have lost time and we've lost the opportunity to

80
00:27:01,114 --> 00:27:06,780
[SPEAKER_04]: PB, Lisa Smith-Miyazaki, she, her, hers, we make drastic changes to this draft and I think that.

81
00:27:08,421 --> 00:27:10,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of the way the timing is working out.

82
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:27,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I am going to make the motion to put the mayor back on the school committee in this draft that we are offering to the mayor, so that we can offer a draft that she will feel comfortable sending to the legislature.

83
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:35,490
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can have something that is closer to a document that we

84
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:49,217
[SPEAKER_04]: feel will move ahead, and then get passed to the voters, and is a compromise, a true compromise document where almost nobody is completely satisfied with it.

85
00:27:50,237 --> 00:27:51,758
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how these things go, oftentimes.

86
00:27:52,622 --> 00:28:04,615
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that what we are frequently losing sight of is that we have agreed on 95% of what is in this document and that that is a real triumph for all of us.

87
00:28:04,915 --> 00:28:07,718
[SPEAKER_04]: So, when we are down to the last

88
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,000
[SPEAKER_04]: few details.

89
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:15,103
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when it seems like we're not agreeing but we've actually gotten very very far.

90
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:17,184
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a really really hefty document.

91
00:28:17,204 --> 00:28:18,505
[SPEAKER_04]: It's taken a really long time to get here.

92
00:28:18,565 --> 00:28:25,449
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 40 pages and it's like it's almost entirely things that we're happy with.

93
00:28:25,769 --> 00:28:30,772
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think on this one detail, it's not a detail.

94
00:28:30,812 --> 00:28:34,755
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big part of the way the city operates but it's something a lot of us don't agree on.

95
00:28:36,356 --> 00:28:37,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I however think that since we've

96
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:51,143
[SPEAKER_04]: gotten this far, I would motion to put, to strike the change Vice President Collins made last week to remove the mayor from the school committee.

97
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:54,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember the exact line.

98
00:28:55,886 --> 00:28:57,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Can somebody help me with that?

99
00:28:57,326 --> 00:28:58,287
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's my motion.

100
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:03,442
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

101
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:13,427
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I just realized, my apologies, that counselor let me just made a motion to amend he not did not make a motion to approve as amended Is that correct.

102
00:29:14,668 --> 00:29:17,950
[SPEAKER_18]: You just wanted to amend the paper under consideration.

103
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:23,290
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

104
00:29:23,831 --> 00:29:26,491
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I shouldn't have had you start talking on your motion.

105
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:27,992
[SPEAKER_18]: My apologies.

106
00:29:28,012 --> 00:29:28,992
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay.

107
00:29:29,012 --> 00:29:35,414
[SPEAKER_18]: What we did last time was someone had moved to amend and approve, and we considered a number of amendments to that motion.

108
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:37,395
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's why we took them in order.

109
00:29:38,155 --> 00:29:41,876
[SPEAKER_18]: These are separate motions to amend the main paper so we should take them consecutively.

110
00:29:43,017 --> 00:29:45,438
[SPEAKER_18]: So we should talk about going to go back to counselor lemmings.

111
00:29:47,367 --> 00:29:54,213
[SPEAKER_18]: which has a second from Councillor Callahan to remove consecutive from 3.1c to add more than eight terms under 2.1 and 4.1.

112
00:29:54,313 --> 00:29:58,957
[SPEAKER_18]: So essentially to set eight term limits for the council and the school committee.

113
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,500
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a discussion on that motion?

114
00:30:05,062 --> 00:30:05,703
[SPEAKER_18]: Councillor Sang.

115
00:30:08,879 --> 00:30:09,279
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

116
00:30:09,579 --> 00:30:15,462
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I, I think I have comments that kind of break break into two general categories.

117
00:30:15,502 --> 00:30:24,766
[SPEAKER_17]: The first one is about just process, because I think counselors are spoke a little bit to process and I disagree with her understanding of things.

118
00:30:25,506 --> 00:30:30,469
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the other one is more about the substance, and I'm a bit more.

119
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:32,509
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm still deciding on that.

120
00:30:34,937 --> 00:30:35,678
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, is this about.

121
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:38,680
[SPEAKER_17]: This is about the lemming motion.

122
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,701
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

123
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:41,662
[SPEAKER_18]: I completely heard lemming as Lazaro.

124
00:30:42,183 --> 00:30:42,483
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry.

125
00:30:42,603 --> 00:30:42,923
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

126
00:30:45,525 --> 00:30:50,309
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a discussion on the lemming motion seconded by Councillor Callahan regarding term limits.

127
00:30:50,569 --> 00:30:51,710
[SPEAKER_18]: Councillor Scarpelli.

128
00:30:52,411 --> 00:30:52,571
[SPEAKER_18]: Nope.

129
00:30:53,331 --> 00:30:54,292
[SPEAKER_18]: Councillor Callahan.

130
00:30:55,653 --> 00:31:00,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Just I think I'm really happy that you brought this up, I think term limits for all.

131
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:07,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Like fairly extended like eight terms that's a lot of time, I feel very comfortable with that.

132
00:31:08,357 --> 00:31:13,903
[SPEAKER_06]: I also think that, you know, nobody should be able to start 32 years with a tiny two year break in the middle.

133
00:31:14,463 --> 00:31:17,506
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'm, I'm in favor also of taking up the consecutive.

134
00:31:18,087 --> 00:31:18,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

135
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:24,414
[SPEAKER_18]: Any further discussion on the motion of Councilor let me a second by Councilor Callahan.

136
00:31:30,965 --> 00:31:33,186
[SPEAKER_18]: We do have Vice President Collins as co host.

137
00:31:35,767 --> 00:31:37,168
[SPEAKER_18]: So, she should be able to vote.

138
00:31:39,389 --> 00:31:40,089
[SPEAKER_18]: Seeing that, yep.

139
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:45,912
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, on the motion of Councilor Lemming, seconded by Councilor Callahan, Callahan, Callahan, interesting.

140
00:31:46,693 --> 00:31:48,434
[SPEAKER_18]: Callahan, regarding term limits.

141
00:31:49,934 --> 00:31:51,055
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

142
00:31:52,956 --> 00:31:53,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Callahan.

143
00:31:55,477 --> 00:31:56,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Collins.

144
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:07,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Councils are also lemming.

145
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:09,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor scarpelli.

146
00:32:11,822 --> 00:32:20,472
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor saying President bears, no to the affirmative five in the negative the motion fails.

147
00:32:26,957 --> 00:32:29,919
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, Councilor Lazaro, now is the time.

148
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:32,240
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for making your speech already.

149
00:32:33,181 --> 00:32:42,326
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't have to say it again, but just to reiterate, your motion was to revert to the mayor on the school committee, but not as the chair.

150
00:32:43,687 --> 00:32:44,027
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

151
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,991
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a second on that motion?

152
00:32:53,613 --> 00:32:55,074
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure, Councilor Scarpelli.

153
00:32:55,844 --> 00:32:56,765
[SPEAKER_15]: I would second that.

154
00:32:56,905 --> 00:33:08,754
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that as one member of this council that the only member of this council that served many years on the school committee, I think the focus has to be that this isn't about this mayor.

155
00:33:09,555 --> 00:33:11,477
[SPEAKER_15]: This isn't all about this school committee.

156
00:33:12,177 --> 00:33:15,820
[SPEAKER_15]: This is about what we think are important changes.

157
00:33:16,581 --> 00:33:19,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, I felt it was very important that the mayor was the chair.

158
00:33:20,185 --> 00:33:37,969
[SPEAKER_15]: of the school committee and that that person held that seat because it brought that committee a certain amount of knowledge and institutional knowledge that could really support the school department.

159
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:48,792
[SPEAKER_15]: Now I understand in the negotiations back and forth there was the acceptance of the mayor coming back and saying okay I can step down as the chair but

160
00:33:49,752 --> 00:33:54,535
[SPEAKER_15]: keeping that position on as a school voting school member is vital.

161
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:55,515
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that's true.

162
00:33:56,556 --> 00:34:09,923
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that the people that made these decisions that brought it to our attention again, sometimes I think we don't look and give people like Melvin McDonald enough credit because one regret I have was last week.

163
00:34:10,663 --> 00:34:18,027
[SPEAKER_15]: We had all these questions, we have all these problems and issues and we didn't ask Melvin to come up once to give her input

164
00:34:19,317 --> 00:34:29,341
[SPEAKER_15]: because she was the person that shared all those meetings, put everything in place and made sure that every what everybody wanted wasn't exactly what she wanted, but was fair.

165
00:34:30,681 --> 00:34:39,604
[SPEAKER_15]: And that it went to it got us to a point where we can vote together as a council, send this off to the mayor's office where she'll prove and then send this off to the state house.

166
00:34:40,384 --> 00:34:43,125
[SPEAKER_15]: So it was exciting to see that.

167
00:34:44,146 --> 00:34:47,667
[SPEAKER_15]: Now what we hear is the call and center

168
00:34:49,013 --> 00:35:05,820
[SPEAKER_15]: the residents of our community, and I'm sure you've all received emails and phone calls and text messages supporting at least the fact having the mayor at least being voting member of the school committee is a vital piece of this of this charter change in this charter review.

169
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,262
[SPEAKER_15]: And what I'm hearing back from people in the public is

170
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:26,553
[SPEAKER_15]: the ego sometimes getting in the way and the back and forth that, you know, sometimes elected officials want to make themselves feel stronger or play the gotcha game to beat you.

171
00:35:27,213 --> 00:35:40,002
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's funny as you, as I got sent a lot of information of different counselors that wrote blogs and wrote disparagingly about people that work so hard for this process.

172
00:35:40,981 --> 00:35:44,264
[SPEAKER_15]: It's disheartening because it's not just about us either.

173
00:35:45,445 --> 00:35:47,566
[SPEAKER_15]: It's about the community and what the community wants.

174
00:35:47,627 --> 00:35:49,028
[SPEAKER_15]: And this has been a challenge.

175
00:35:49,068 --> 00:35:51,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I said, I've been against charter review.

176
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,551
[SPEAKER_15]: When I first ran for office, I was supporting it.

177
00:35:53,571 --> 00:35:58,495
[SPEAKER_15]: And then as I leaned away from ward representation, I voted against it.

178
00:35:58,696 --> 00:36:06,462
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I did my due diligence and really did some homework and met with a lot of different communities about ward representation.

179
00:36:07,022 --> 00:36:08,684
[SPEAKER_15]: And we realized that

180
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:18,815
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the biggest factors we see the issues we have in Medford is the lack of participation by new candidates, people getting involved.

181
00:36:19,796 --> 00:36:22,458
[SPEAKER_15]: And what's happening is you're seeing what we are today.

182
00:36:22,518 --> 00:36:29,282
[SPEAKER_15]: We have, um, candidates that run on a slate and work together to get themselves elected, and it's working.

183
00:36:29,402 --> 00:36:30,243
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't begrudge them.

184
00:36:30,283 --> 00:36:32,544
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the way this is the way you win the seat.

185
00:36:32,564 --> 00:36:33,125
[SPEAKER_15]: They win the seat.

186
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:39,028
[SPEAKER_15]: But we've also seen how that affects government and how people truly feel.

187
00:36:39,048 --> 00:36:39,789
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't have a voice.

188
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,746
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've been saying this for a long time now.

189
00:36:43,626 --> 00:36:49,071
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot of issues that come to this council and we talk about what's best for your voting block.

190
00:36:50,031 --> 00:36:55,876
[SPEAKER_15]: But when we're sworn in in January, we swear that we're representing 60,000 members of this community.

191
00:36:56,577 --> 00:37:07,145
[SPEAKER_15]: And there isn't a document or a scenario more visible and more involved than the charter review process.

192
00:37:08,106 --> 00:37:10,308
[SPEAKER_15]: An independent group of people that were brought in

193
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:24,267
[SPEAKER_15]: that did their due diligence and had hundreds of meetings, talked to everybody in every corner of this community, then met with the Collins Center that were the ultimate professionals.

194
00:37:24,307 --> 00:37:27,429
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe 80 years of experience between the two people that were working with us.

195
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:33,513
[SPEAKER_15]: And they came back and gave us a document that really looked really, really good that could work for our community.

196
00:37:35,892 --> 00:37:39,494
[SPEAKER_15]: As government works, we go back and forth and you see tweaks here and there.

197
00:37:40,074 --> 00:37:44,976
[SPEAKER_15]: And to be honest with you, if I was the mayor, I wouldn't give into half of what you're asking for.

198
00:37:45,076 --> 00:37:46,556
[SPEAKER_15]: But she did, and I respect that.

199
00:37:47,517 --> 00:37:50,638
[SPEAKER_15]: The eight and three, it's good to see that we made moves with that.

200
00:37:51,858 --> 00:37:58,901
[SPEAKER_15]: But I agree that this can't move forward without the mayor's process, the mayor's ability staying on the school committee.

201
00:37:59,422 --> 00:38:00,522
[SPEAKER_15]: Not this mayor per se.

202
00:38:01,342 --> 00:38:03,163
[SPEAKER_15]: It could be three mayors from now that we've done this.

203
00:38:03,723 --> 00:38:05,384
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's important that that person is there.

204
00:38:06,558 --> 00:38:14,643
[SPEAKER_15]: So when I hear my colleagues talk about, school committee members talk about A, B and C and how they feel this, how they feel that, it's really not about them.

205
00:38:15,503 --> 00:38:16,624
[SPEAKER_15]: It's about this community.

206
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:18,085
[SPEAKER_15]: It's about their document.

207
00:38:19,185 --> 00:38:29,011
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, I implore my colleagues, because as we went through last week's meeting, in the 12th hour, we keep hearing it's 6-0 vote, the meeting hours in here.

208
00:38:29,031 --> 00:38:35,775
[SPEAKER_15]: It would have been 6-1, but you're hearing in the 12th hour that now

209
00:38:37,517 --> 00:38:41,558
[SPEAKER_15]: never heard it before, but now we want the mayor off of the school committee completely.

210
00:38:42,419 --> 00:38:47,480
[SPEAKER_15]: We talked about that the process of the charter committee was put together fraudulently, it was wrong.

211
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,141
[SPEAKER_15]: It wasn't thought out.

212
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:51,801
[SPEAKER_15]: Then it was this process went too fast.

213
00:38:54,342 --> 00:39:06,186
[SPEAKER_15]: What it sounds like to the community, and this is both many different sides of our community where they stand and reached out to me and said, wow, it sounds like I'm taking my ball and going home.

214
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:21,546
[SPEAKER_15]: And so all I'm asking my colleagues to do is, we might not see eye at eye in many things, but this is something that could really move our community forward, that in a seven nothing vote, we can move this to the mayor's office, we can get this sent off to the state.

215
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:27,549
[SPEAKER_15]: And it seems like there's really one piece left and that's the mayor staying on the school committee.

216
00:39:28,049 --> 00:39:32,491
[SPEAKER_15]: And being a former member of the school committee, I know how important it was under Mayor McGlynn.

217
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:35,933
[SPEAKER_15]: Now maybe under the new mayor with the new school committee,

218
00:39:36,881 --> 00:39:37,924
[SPEAKER_15]: you'll see that importance.

219
00:39:39,608 --> 00:39:45,584
[SPEAKER_15]: But don't hold the weight just because this school committee says that they feel a B and C because it's just not about them.

220
00:39:46,922 --> 00:39:54,807
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would second Councilor Lazaro's motion to leave the mayor in as not the chair, but a voting member.

221
00:39:55,468 --> 00:40:12,259
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would ask this council to move favorably on a seven zero vote to move this to the mayor's office in the state, because I will tell you if this, they're watching and our delegates are watching and they're listening to their residents because their residents are reaching out to the state delegates and

222
00:40:14,124 --> 00:40:16,086
[SPEAKER_15]: We want something that's going to go to the state house and pass.

223
00:40:16,106 --> 00:40:17,186
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's on the, on the ballot.

224
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:21,150
[SPEAKER_15]: So I appreciate, uh, the efforts from Milva and her team.

225
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:26,614
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, again, I, I publicly apologize that I've had questions last week.

226
00:40:26,734 --> 00:40:28,696
[SPEAKER_15]: I should have asked you to come up to that podium.

227
00:40:28,816 --> 00:40:29,236
[SPEAKER_15]: One regret.

228
00:40:29,256 --> 00:40:35,741
[SPEAKER_15]: I realized when I went home, um, that some of the questions I did have, I didn't ask the person directly.

229
00:40:35,761 --> 00:40:37,543
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, but, um,

230
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:42,332
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, thank you, Mr. President, for my winded dialogue.

231
00:40:42,572 --> 00:40:43,493
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Sang.

232
00:40:44,354 --> 00:40:44,714
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

233
00:40:45,295 --> 00:40:55,104
[SPEAKER_17]: Going back to what I was saying, again, I want to kind of split my comments into process and substance, because I think I can speak to both.

234
00:40:56,245 --> 00:41:04,653
[SPEAKER_17]: When it comes to process, President Behrs and I have been really working closely with the mayor's office for a very, very long time to get this on our agenda.

235
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:06,054
[SPEAKER_17]: for a very long time.

236
00:41:06,174 --> 00:41:12,938
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know, you know, I've heard residents ask, you know, why is this all happening so last minute?

237
00:41:13,258 --> 00:41:15,800
[SPEAKER_17]: Why do things feel quick at the end?

238
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,982
[SPEAKER_17]: Why are we having so many substantive conversations towards the end?

239
00:41:19,662 --> 00:41:31,390
[SPEAKER_17]: And I really do think a lot of this could have been mitigated had we had the mayor's office helped us, gave us the green light to move on this forward earlier.

240
00:41:31,837 --> 00:41:47,071
[SPEAKER_17]: If you go to our governing agenda, you'll find that us as the city council we place this pretty early on to address in the governance can be early last year, like, March, April, and February.

241
00:41:49,680 --> 00:42:16,197
[SPEAKER_17]: That was the goal, the goal was to start conversation so we wouldn't have to end up in the place where we might have disagreements last minute, where we, you know, didn't have to, you know, have these conversations about balance of power last minute, where we weren't dealing with last minute, small edits that you know actually make a big difference from the mayor's office that get placed on our agenda, where, you know, counselors feel very pressured to approve something even though we haven't, there were substantive edits that we had didn't have time to scrutinize.

242
00:42:18,777 --> 00:42:37,330
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to also note that, you know, even besides the governing agenda I wrote the mayor on August 8, and I CC president bears I wrote the mayor and the chief of staff, reaching out as the chair of the governance committee set to set up those meetings early on so that we could jump right into things in September.

243
00:42:38,352 --> 00:42:48,397
[SPEAKER_17]: And the mayor asked us to go offline to do a phone call, we called, and, you know, in that phone call she asked us to delay those meetings.

244
00:42:49,758 --> 00:42:54,200
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, we talked through it about why we thought we might need more time.

245
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:57,162
[SPEAKER_17]: We ultimately decided to respect the mayor.

246
00:42:58,322 --> 00:43:02,883
[SPEAKER_17]: and the Charter Review Committee's decision to send us the product later in the calendar.

247
00:43:03,043 --> 00:43:04,024
[SPEAKER_17]: So we did that.

248
00:43:04,304 --> 00:43:05,404
[SPEAKER_17]: We scheduled a meeting then.

249
00:43:06,004 --> 00:43:21,128
[SPEAKER_17]: And at that meeting, we were then asked again to delay by a month or any substantive conversation that we might have because the Charter Review Committee hadn't yet delivered their products to the mayor's office.

250
00:43:21,448 --> 00:43:22,248
[SPEAKER_17]: We respected that.

251
00:43:23,588 --> 00:43:34,195
[SPEAKER_17]: And then once, but at that meeting, you know, we talked about some substantive edits that are substantive proposals from the Charter Review Committee.

252
00:43:35,274 --> 00:43:36,475
[SPEAKER_17]: during their times meeting.

253
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:40,799
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know, you know, members of the committee have asked, you know, our meetings were public.

254
00:43:40,999 --> 00:43:44,942
[SPEAKER_17]: Why, you know, why didn't you, why, why didn't you just follow then?

255
00:43:45,342 --> 00:43:46,163
[SPEAKER_17]: And we did follow.

256
00:43:46,603 --> 00:43:54,109
[SPEAKER_17]: And I compiled, at the time I compiled a list of the motions the committee had made to give us a sense of what this draft charter would look like.

257
00:43:54,229 --> 00:44:00,954
[SPEAKER_17]: But then, you know, I was asked to not send that list of motions out because, you know,

258
00:44:01,955 --> 00:44:11,904
[SPEAKER_17]: because apparently the motions would make more sense in context of the whole charter, and that it would make sense for us to look at things piece by piece, which is still eventually what we did.

259
00:44:13,065 --> 00:44:20,572
[SPEAKER_17]: But I respected that as the chair of the Governance Committee, respecting the wish of the Charter Review Committee as well.

260
00:44:21,153 --> 00:44:27,458
[SPEAKER_17]: And all of that is to say our timeline got pushed to be crammed towards the very end,

261
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:37,809
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we were notified late last year that we were expected to push out a product by mid-April.

262
00:44:38,149 --> 00:44:41,893
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's why we find ourselves timeline-wise where we are today.

263
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:45,277
[SPEAKER_17]: And I also want to note that we made sure to get

264
00:44:45,837 --> 00:44:52,802
[SPEAKER_17]: the draft charter committee out of the governance committee as soon as possible we scheduled a committee of the whole as soon as possible.

265
00:44:53,362 --> 00:45:00,387
[SPEAKER_17]: So we sent this, you know, we got this out of the city council as soon as possible to get to the mayor's office while still trying to do our due diligence.

266
00:45:02,128 --> 00:45:04,930
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, we gave the mayor time to and

267
00:45:06,131 --> 00:45:16,042
[SPEAKER_17]: We could have gotten the product back enough back early enough for us to scrutinize the small edits that had been made since the council gave the mayor our version.

268
00:45:17,353 --> 00:45:22,258
[SPEAKER_17]: But then we were given just a little bit less than a week to review that.

269
00:45:22,398 --> 00:45:31,046
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we were, you know, through press releases, pressured to, you know, rubber stamp what had been sent to us.

270
00:45:31,446 --> 00:45:37,352
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, that's my perspective of what's happened from, you know, as the chair of the governance committee.

271
00:45:38,813 --> 00:45:39,173
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course,

272
00:45:41,335 --> 00:45:50,763
[SPEAKER_17]: I can see you know where folks might disagree but those are just based on the emails, based on what's been published, based on the phone calls that have been made, that's the timeline.

273
00:45:51,344 --> 00:45:58,730
[SPEAKER_17]: So the City Council has been trying really hard to make sure that we aren't in a position where we're kind of rushing against the deadline.

274
00:45:59,551 --> 00:46:02,113
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to note that at that last meeting we could have

275
00:46:02,553 --> 00:46:09,996
[SPEAKER_17]: chosen not to hold special city council meeting today as well, which would have gotten us past the April 15th deadline.

276
00:46:10,897 --> 00:46:20,381
[SPEAKER_17]: And so that's why I disagree with councillors Lazaro and Scarpelli on their kind of characterization of the timeline.

277
00:46:21,141 --> 00:46:30,886
[SPEAKER_17]: I also believe very strongly that it is our job to scrutinize, to do our due diligence, and that can lead us different places.

278
00:46:31,446 --> 00:46:31,586
[SPEAKER_17]: And

279
00:46:32,593 --> 00:46:38,619
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I'll put my hands up I did my due diligence I ended up in a different place than what the draft we have in front of us today.

280
00:46:38,999 --> 00:46:41,902
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I compromised and I gave up on big things that I supported.

281
00:46:42,403 --> 00:46:51,692
[SPEAKER_17]: And even honestly even a lot of this in the first place is me deciding not to bring up things that I had concerns with, because I thought they were good enough.

282
00:46:54,280 --> 00:47:01,687
[SPEAKER_17]: I, you know, I think this is all a complicated conversation, which is fair, because the Charter is a foundational document.

283
00:47:02,688 --> 00:47:10,436
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the Constitution for a city, and so going through small edits, going through the details actually does mean a lot.

284
00:47:11,076 --> 00:47:14,039
[SPEAKER_17]: I find it not helpful when

285
00:47:15,592 --> 00:47:38,443
[SPEAKER_17]: when a councillor might suggest that parts of this charter are to take power away from certain groups in the city or to reverse the decision of the electorate at the last two or three elections to get new people onto the council or to get different people onto different bodies.

286
00:47:38,563 --> 00:47:40,864
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think that's what any of this should be about.

287
00:47:40,884 --> 00:47:43,285
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's wrong to bring that into this conversation.

288
00:47:43,326 --> 00:47:44,026
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we should just

289
00:47:44,546 --> 00:47:46,147
[SPEAKER_17]: look at the policies as is.

290
00:47:47,628 --> 00:47:57,214
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we shouldn't suggest that any of these proposals are here to undermine anyone in this room or any voter and their preference in the city.

291
00:47:57,354 --> 00:48:03,838
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that's what it means to support a charter that represents all 60,000 people of our city.

292
00:48:04,918 --> 00:48:11,322
[SPEAKER_17]: Moving on to the substance of it, I think, and in particular, Councilor Lazaro's

293
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:20,019
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the mayor on and off the school committee is a really tough decision.

294
00:48:20,139 --> 00:48:21,861
[SPEAKER_17]: It's one that I've been grappling with a lot.

295
00:48:22,021 --> 00:48:37,251
[SPEAKER_17]: The reason why I voted yes to send it here tonight was because I had gotten a lot of feedback from residents, especially towards the end of our consideration period, that they didn't think that the balance of power shift was enough.

296
00:48:38,071 --> 00:48:41,834
[SPEAKER_17]: And that if we are going to take this,

297
00:48:42,804 --> 00:49:02,402
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, majoritarian stance when it comes to looking at the survey results, we should be consistent in that approach and consistent in, you know, recognizing that most people, or at least the plurality of people, voted to take the mayor off the school committee.

298
00:49:03,723 --> 00:49:06,045
[SPEAKER_17]: I have to be honest, I can see the argument in both ways.

299
00:49:07,146 --> 00:49:09,268
[SPEAKER_17]: I think there's a decent argument that

300
00:49:10,145 --> 00:49:23,712
[SPEAKER_17]: The mayor as the CEO of our city should be obliged to attend all the school committee meetings and have a deeper understanding of what that school committee process is like and what challenges the schools face.

301
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:33,738
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the mayor has made to me a compelling point that certain really important reforms that we've had as a city like

302
00:49:34,317 --> 00:49:44,670
[SPEAKER_17]: The override vote wouldn't have happened if she weren't on on the school committee and gotten that perspective and that budget seasons might look really different.

303
00:49:46,553 --> 00:49:49,416
[SPEAKER_17]: And that the schools might have been fighting for even more money.

304
00:49:50,378 --> 00:49:52,540
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I think that's compelling.

305
00:49:53,446 --> 00:50:04,412
[SPEAKER_17]: I think some other parts that I don't find as compelling, and what the mayor has kind of indicated through press releases and to us is, you know, the idea that the mayor plays a really important role in negotiating.

306
00:50:04,492 --> 00:50:13,257
[SPEAKER_17]: As we know, our mayor has to step away from a lot of our negotiating, the school committee's negotiating because of conflict of interest.

307
00:50:13,737 --> 00:50:20,440
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that's actually a decent argument for taking the mayor off of school committee, because there are so many conflicts of interest.

308
00:50:23,746 --> 00:50:41,735
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been talking, I've been reaching out to members of the school committee and people who have, you know, recently served in the school committee to get their perspective on the issue because I think it's worth having a deeper conversation about this policy wise.

309
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:46,558
[SPEAKER_17]: I think member Reinfeldt said

310
00:50:48,127 --> 00:50:54,329
[SPEAKER_17]: I, she made an interesting point to me which I, which I want to read out because she said I could read out her message.

311
00:50:55,130 --> 00:51:03,533
[SPEAKER_17]: And she said, I was a firm maybe in my interview and also one of the 15.3 not sure respondents in the survey, because I saw both pros and cons.

312
00:51:03,773 --> 00:51:11,356
[SPEAKER_17]: After 15 months in the role I still see arguments on both sides but lean no, no being mayor off of school committee, mostly because of the budget process.

313
00:51:12,116 --> 00:51:15,699
[SPEAKER_17]: I also think it is challenging to have a city executive in a legislative role.

314
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:23,424
[SPEAKER_17]: The arguments in favor for me are mostly about the two-way flow of information rather than the practice of running slash governing a school district.

315
00:51:24,025 --> 00:51:33,731
[SPEAKER_17]: Ultimately, while I appreciate the perspective that a mayor can bring to the table, I think it makes sense that anyone serving on the school committee be elected for the primary purpose of serving on the school committee.

316
00:51:34,872 --> 00:51:36,253
[SPEAKER_17]: And then she said,

317
00:51:38,753 --> 00:51:47,377
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the mayor's chair is challenging because it takes on a new meeting and takes on a weird power dynamic.

318
00:51:48,438 --> 00:52:02,284
[SPEAKER_17]: Non-chair is also weird because of subcommittees, because that's also extra time commitments, and chosen based on particular school-related expertise, which is not the basis of the mayor's election to office.

319
00:52:04,477 --> 00:52:07,358
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that's a fair substantive argument against.

320
00:52:09,819 --> 00:52:16,162
[SPEAKER_17]: I think you know what I what I wanted to say right now is that I can see strong arguments for and against.

321
00:52:16,823 --> 00:52:20,484
[SPEAKER_17]: I haven't settled completely on where I fall in that debate.

322
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:31,667
[SPEAKER_17]: And I wanna hear a lively discussion and I wanna hear viewpoints and make a decision off of that.

323
00:52:31,947 --> 00:52:47,541
[SPEAKER_17]: But I ultimately do wanna see this charter succeed, but also to make sure that we're making or passing a charter that truly does work for all of our residents in the city and to really take on the responsibility of what that means.

324
00:52:48,701 --> 00:52:51,544
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it's preferable that this makes the fall ballot

325
00:52:52,243 --> 00:52:58,508
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we should also acknowledge that even if this goes on the ballot next year, it would still go into effect at the exact same time.

326
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:03,692
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think I'll close with the debate that I was having at the last meeting.

327
00:53:03,712 --> 00:53:09,257
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's important not to let perfect bait be the enemy of good.

328
00:53:09,877 --> 00:53:16,743
[SPEAKER_17]: But I also worry about creating a situation where it's so hard to say yes to better.

329
00:53:18,031 --> 00:53:23,795
[SPEAKER_17]: So essentially a situation where things feel good enough, but they're not actually working optimally.

330
00:53:24,756 --> 00:53:29,799
[SPEAKER_17]: And that there's that kind of like inertia to get to that optimal place.

331
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:34,722
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I worry also about deferring better for the future.

332
00:53:34,882 --> 00:53:45,849
[SPEAKER_17]: And someone made the point to me in the two emails that I got supporting the mayor on school committee, someone made the point that, you know, we could just,

333
00:53:47,717 --> 00:53:48,959
[SPEAKER_17]: revisit this next time.

334
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:53,964
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think 10 years sometimes doesn't feel like a long time.

335
00:53:55,446 --> 00:54:02,293
[SPEAKER_17]: But doing the math, if this charter were to go into effect in 2027, 10 years after that would be 2037.

336
00:54:02,413 --> 00:54:05,497
[SPEAKER_17]: And the next time a new charter would take effect would be 2039.

337
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:09,624
[SPEAKER_17]: And by that time, I plan to have kids in the school system.

338
00:54:09,644 --> 00:54:14,046
[SPEAKER_17]: I hope to own a home here in Medford.

339
00:54:15,166 --> 00:54:17,868
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a wildly different time than now.

340
00:54:19,568 --> 00:54:21,509
[SPEAKER_17]: And so that's also weighing on my mind.

341
00:54:21,989 --> 00:54:25,271
[SPEAKER_17]: But I just wanted to be transparent with the public about where my mind is at right now.

342
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:28,430
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Lemme.

343
00:54:30,031 --> 00:54:30,411
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

344
00:54:31,611 --> 00:54:37,433
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll just briefly state my case about the Mayor on School Committee.

345
00:54:39,233 --> 00:54:48,336
[SPEAKER_16]: I did write a pretty lengthy post to my website about the process of this charter review.

346
00:54:48,776 --> 00:54:50,597
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not going to summarize the whole thing here.

347
00:54:50,677 --> 00:54:51,457
[SPEAKER_16]: It's nuanced.

348
00:54:52,557 --> 00:54:54,838
[SPEAKER_16]: I've had a lot of thoughts about it that have

349
00:54:56,322 --> 00:55:00,825
[SPEAKER_16]: that have changed over time, particularly since December.

350
00:55:01,486 --> 00:55:04,448
[SPEAKER_16]: If you're interested in reading about that, just mattlemming.com.

351
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:08,184
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think anybody's a bad guy here.

352
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:11,645
[SPEAKER_16]: I respect everybody on the charter study committee.

353
00:55:11,665 --> 00:55:29,612
[SPEAKER_16]: I respect the mayor, school committee, my colleagues, but I did outline some of my issues with that process in that post.

354
00:55:30,873 --> 00:55:35,675
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, not gonna try to summarize all of it right here, but this is just a case where

355
00:55:36,467 --> 00:55:43,669
[SPEAKER_16]: people who want to do what they think is best for the city are disagreeing on what that is and the means of getting there.

356
00:55:44,209 --> 00:55:47,750
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that's where we're at right now.

357
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:50,270
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's how I see it.

358
00:55:51,411 --> 00:56:06,094
[SPEAKER_16]: With the mayor and school committee issue, just the reasons I think are one, charter study committees on survey said it was the more popular decision with the respondents to keep the mayor off

359
00:56:06,787 --> 00:56:12,172
[SPEAKER_16]: of school committee, it was pointed out to me that council term limits was also very popular.

360
00:56:12,732 --> 00:56:14,293
[SPEAKER_16]: Just took a vote on that, didn't pass.

361
00:56:14,614 --> 00:56:19,718
[SPEAKER_16]: So I do, but I do, after thinking about that argument, I do agree that we should have term limits.

362
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:33,789
[SPEAKER_16]: I also recognize that current and former school committee members, including my colleague here, as he's just expressed, do disagree on the mayor being on school committee issue.

363
00:56:33,809 --> 00:56:35,731
[SPEAKER_16]: There are a lot of pros and cons against it.

364
00:56:37,856 --> 00:56:57,243
[SPEAKER_16]: The ones who are against it have expressed to me the argument that Councillor Seng just expressed in which they say that it can be very, it can lead to a lot of conflicts of interest behind the scenes, particularly in union negotiations.

365
00:56:58,243 --> 00:57:05,286
[SPEAKER_16]: I also do have sympathy for the school committee members that I have spoken with who don't want to

366
00:57:07,177 --> 00:57:29,681
[SPEAKER_16]: publicly or as publicly express their position that the mayor shouldn't be on school committee because I think it's very easy being on school committee to say that you want the mayor to be on school committee because then you are supporting the position of your colleague but saying that you don't want the mayor to be on school committee is a little bit more difficult because that that can end up burning bridges.

367
00:57:29,701 --> 00:57:30,221
[SPEAKER_16]: So I

368
00:57:33,582 --> 00:57:38,245
[SPEAKER_16]: I have taken current and former school committee members' views on this into account.

369
00:57:38,866 --> 00:57:43,528
[SPEAKER_16]: I do think there needs to be a stronger balance between the mayor, the council, and the school committee.

370
00:57:44,029 --> 00:57:49,192
[SPEAKER_16]: Currently, this charter, plan A strong mayor system, I think it does give the mayor a lot far too much power.

371
00:57:49,812 --> 00:57:54,295
[SPEAKER_16]: And this kind of resets the balance there.

372
00:57:58,377 --> 00:57:59,638
[SPEAKER_16]: Besides chairing the school committee,

373
00:58:00,655 --> 00:58:14,287
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think that the mayor, and this is just hearing from what other members have told me, I don't think the mayor has a whole lot of time to really dedicate to the day-to-day work of running the school system just because of time commitment issues.

374
00:58:14,347 --> 00:58:17,429
[SPEAKER_16]: And so having the mayor off does give one extra person there.

375
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:23,835
[SPEAKER_16]: The other, and last, I know it's a trend to have the mayor on school committee in Massachusetts.

376
00:58:23,935 --> 00:58:27,578
[SPEAKER_16]: It is the default setup under Massachusetts general law.

377
00:58:28,968 --> 00:58:33,090
[SPEAKER_16]: To have that six school committee member with the mayor's chair setup.

378
00:58:33,751 --> 00:58:44,316
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not the case in other states, and I think if other states have a setup like that, like can survive with different setups and I think, and I think Medford.

379
00:58:44,696 --> 00:58:45,336
[SPEAKER_16]: can as well.

380
00:58:46,057 --> 00:58:55,501
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, it's not it's not like no other state has the mayor on school committees just that this is not a uniform picture and so there are different systems in different localities.

381
00:58:56,161 --> 00:59:01,723
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why I'll be voting to keep the mayor off school committee, and thank you everybody for listening.

382
00:59:06,105 --> 00:59:07,746
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

383
00:59:09,353 --> 00:59:10,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

384
00:59:11,774 --> 00:59:17,935
[SPEAKER_06]: I am not happy with how this process has gone for the charter in general.

385
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:25,077
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate Councilor Lozaro's description of a two compromise where no one is happy with the product.

386
00:59:25,277 --> 00:59:27,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that is also accurate.

387
00:59:28,838 --> 00:59:35,800
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that if we do not put the mayor back on the school committee, this charter will not make it to the state.

388
00:59:37,461 --> 00:59:37,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

389
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:43,994
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there any further discussion by members of the council on Council Lazaro's motion?

390
00:59:44,114 --> 00:59:45,295
[SPEAKER_18]: Vice President Collins.

391
00:59:53,504 --> 00:59:54,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Bereson.

392
00:59:54,665 --> 00:59:56,667
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize to my colleagues for being late to the chambers.

393
00:59:56,787 --> 01:00:00,431
[SPEAKER_03]: I was listening on Zoom while commuting through heavy traffic.

394
01:00:04,304 --> 01:00:10,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the discussion so far and I appreciate everybody's patience with giving this process the time that it needs to get to the voting stage.

395
01:00:12,947 --> 01:00:20,110
[SPEAKER_03]: And though we disagree, I appreciate Councilor Lozaro's thoughtful consideration of my motion in our last meeting and the conversation that's followed.

396
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:26,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we have a couple of ideas being floated in the past half hour or so, and one of the questions is, should we

397
01:00:27,593 --> 01:00:30,235
[SPEAKER_03]: vote to reinstate the mayor on the school committee or not.

398
01:00:31,756 --> 01:00:36,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I said a lot about my reasons for making the motion to remove the mayor from school committee.

399
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:46,588
[SPEAKER_03]: A week ago and I won't give that same spiel again, because all of my colleagues have heard it already and anybody else who's interested can find it online.

400
01:00:46,788 --> 01:00:51,452
[SPEAKER_03]: So, just to with more brevity, explain my thinking.

401
01:00:57,427 --> 01:01:22,024
[SPEAKER_03]: I think with our review of the city charter, something that has been kind of in the back of my mind as we have considered various possible changes and adjustments that we could make to our current city charter, something that I have been kind of coming back to as we go along is this question of when is it worthwhile to make changes for the sake of change?

402
01:01:22,084 --> 01:01:26,647
[SPEAKER_03]: When is it worthwhile to make progress for the sake of doing things differently?

403
01:01:27,908 --> 01:01:33,337
[SPEAKER_03]: When is it important to hold out for different changes?

404
01:01:36,904 --> 01:01:39,188
[SPEAKER_03]: A reason that I have not been more

405
01:01:40,001 --> 01:01:53,576
[SPEAKER_03]: along throughout this process is that I am wary of Medford, all of us invested in things such as a new charter that will make our community better.

406
01:01:53,656 --> 01:02:01,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I am wary of us spending momentum on changes, on a new charter

407
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:14,096
[SPEAKER_03]: that I believe that a new charter should meaningfully engage with the question of power and balance because that is a fundamental thing that the city charter decides for the city and then we live with that for a long time.

408
01:02:14,756 --> 01:02:30,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wary of the city charter process that allowed us to spend our momentum and our energy for positive progress and change in productive ways but in ways that also deferred progress that I think that we really need to see such as renegotiating that question of power and balance.

409
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:44,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying I'm the only one with the right opinion about this I'm saying that that has been heavy on my mind throughout this process because we deserve a product that is not only good, but great.

410
01:02:45,448 --> 01:02:55,016
[SPEAKER_03]: And as counselors we sign up to have the conversations and take as long as it takes to try to get to the product that we think best does that.

411
01:02:59,193 --> 01:03:04,596
[SPEAKER_03]: To that end, thinking about what is my role, I want to speak for other counselors, what is my role as a counselor in this process?

412
01:03:04,616 --> 01:03:06,477
[SPEAKER_03]: This was not a process that was initiated by the council.

413
01:03:07,077 --> 01:03:18,143
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a process that was initiated by the mayor, and it is our statutory responsibility to review the charter, make amendments, and then approve a version that will then go to the mayor and hopefully the voters.

414
01:03:20,044 --> 01:03:25,727
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one way of looking at my role as a counselor on this process, saying my role is to

415
01:03:27,623 --> 01:03:38,949
[SPEAKER_03]: look at the draft city charter, make sure there's nothing glaringly problematic, and then vote it out so that the voters can decide either yes, this is worth doing or no, this is not meaningfully better than what we currently have.

416
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:53,236
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's another way of characterizing my role as a counselor in this process, which is to say my role is to insist on an outcome that I think is so good, so meaningful, so important, that I would personally endorse and campaign for the outcome.

417
01:03:54,837 --> 01:03:57,118
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the attitude with which I have been approaching this project.

418
01:03:58,425 --> 01:04:00,066
[SPEAKER_03]: to the inconvenience of many, including myself.

419
01:04:03,988 --> 01:04:18,176
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that this charter, unless it reimagines the balance of power in regard to the school committee and the city council, in regard to the other branches of government, I'm not saying it's not a good charter unless it does that.

420
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:25,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying it does not represent a meaningful change to the level of representation that residents will enjoy.

421
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:26,380
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why

422
01:04:28,763 --> 01:04:31,505
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I made my motion last week, and that's why this has been important to me.

423
01:04:32,806 --> 01:04:44,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as we've taken time to assimilate what we've been hearing in our inboxes and on phone calls and from the surveys and with our meetings, that has, at least to me, been what I interpret as the through line of this.

424
01:04:44,233 --> 01:04:46,415
[SPEAKER_03]: People are asking for increased representativeness.

425
01:04:47,075 --> 01:04:50,417
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a lot of fights about what that meant for the city council, and I think those were productive.

426
01:04:50,537 --> 01:04:52,519
[SPEAKER_03]: And as everybody knows, I backed off on 5-4.

427
01:04:52,539 --> 01:04:53,099
[SPEAKER_03]: 8-3, I think, is

428
01:04:59,046 --> 01:05:01,827
[SPEAKER_03]: clearly what most people would like to get the chance to vote on.

429
01:05:05,489 --> 01:05:11,431
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I hear is that people want better representation, full stop, and they don't just mean the city council.

430
01:05:11,511 --> 01:05:21,415
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that that has to include at least a beginning to ask the question of the balance of power between the mayor and the other two branches of government.

431
01:05:21,475 --> 01:05:25,397
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is why I will not be supporting the motion to put the mayor back on the school committee.

432
01:05:31,294 --> 01:05:33,455
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there any further discussion by members of the council?

433
01:05:33,495 --> 01:05:34,316
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Lazaro.

434
01:05:35,416 --> 01:05:35,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

435
01:05:37,357 --> 01:05:39,559
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate this conversation.

436
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:43,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's, I mean, I agree with what everybody has said.

437
01:05:46,222 --> 01:05:50,305
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did just want to say that I also wanted to offer a B paper.

438
01:05:50,325 --> 01:05:59,229
[SPEAKER_04]: I drafted a press release after we take a vote to send out that I emailed to the clerk.

439
01:06:02,071 --> 01:06:16,220
[SPEAKER_04]: if Clerk Herderbys can send it to councilors, would that be best President Behrs to send the draft to councilors to review or should we read it out loud?

440
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:23,085
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll do both, but we're gonna do that after we finish this motion to amend for the school committee.

441
01:06:23,125 --> 01:06:23,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great.

442
01:06:25,561 --> 01:06:31,124
[SPEAKER_04]: I would motion to, is there a motion to, my motion is already there.

443
01:06:31,144 --> 01:06:42,451
[SPEAKER_18]: Your motion is a motion to amend the main paper to amend the main paper to restore the merit of the school committee, but not in the role as chair so voting member but not chair that has a second from Councilor Scarpelli.

444
01:06:42,551 --> 01:06:45,213
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there any more discussion on that specific motion?

445
01:06:47,073 --> 01:06:48,894
[SPEAKER_18]: for members of the council and I did see the mayor's hand.

446
01:06:49,094 --> 01:06:53,675
[SPEAKER_18]: And so once we go through members of the council, I will recognize the mayor since she is the presenter of the paper.

447
01:06:58,256 --> 01:06:59,377
[SPEAKER_18]: Mayor, I saw your hand earlier.

448
01:07:00,217 --> 01:07:06,919
[SPEAKER_18]: If you want to re-raise it to speak on specifically this question about restoring the mayor to the school committee.

449
01:07:16,709 --> 01:07:18,590
[SPEAKER_18]: and you should also be able to start video if you want.

450
01:07:21,311 --> 01:07:27,254
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually ended up lowering my hand when I realized that the votes weren't there.

451
01:07:27,474 --> 01:07:38,999
[SPEAKER_07]: I was gonna try to speak beforehand to encourage the committee to reconsider and support the motion put forward by member Lazaro.

452
01:07:39,699 --> 01:07:45,122
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's important to know these negotiations have gone on for a long time.

453
01:07:46,612 --> 01:08:03,498
[SPEAKER_07]: part of, I know Councilor Singh gave a timeline and part of the reason why I asked for some delay in the council starting to meet on the charter was not for personal reasons, but more for, to allow the study committee to do their due diligence.

454
01:08:03,558 --> 01:08:07,659
[SPEAKER_07]: And they worked extremely, extremely hard on the entire document.

455
01:08:07,859 --> 01:08:15,842
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when it came to me, I did, you know, I took a few weeks of course, and made the amendments that I felt

456
01:08:16,845 --> 01:08:21,069
[SPEAKER_07]: They were, I thought they were minor and most of them were guided by the Collins Center.

457
01:08:22,350 --> 01:08:38,887
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and then I feel like the council did their due diligence, but I'd be remiss to just say that from the Collins Center's review of many, many charters throughout the Commonwealth,

458
01:08:40,898 --> 01:08:45,321
[SPEAKER_07]: The balance of power in Medford is normal for our form of government.

459
01:08:46,202 --> 01:08:55,568
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not showing any disrespect, but what we have is 10 members out of 14 that are from one organization.

460
01:08:55,608 --> 01:08:56,568
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's fine.

461
01:08:56,608 --> 01:08:58,670
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what the electorate wants.

462
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:01,452
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're all great people and hard workers.

463
01:09:02,785 --> 01:09:09,949
[SPEAKER_07]: I would argue that, especially on the school committee, because it's not personal for me, I'd actually rather not be on the school committee.

464
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:16,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I tend to be viewing this from the future and what should be in the future.

465
01:09:16,253 --> 01:09:24,037
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that serving on the committee for almost six years has opened my eyes to the needs in the schools.

466
01:09:25,158 --> 01:09:28,540
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't buy the argument of the conflict of interest because I've only had one.

467
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,622
[SPEAKER_07]: That was at the most recent teacher negotiations.

468
01:09:32,142 --> 01:09:34,103
[SPEAKER_07]: member Bramley and I had a conflict.

469
01:09:34,643 --> 01:09:37,243
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see that I've had any other conflicts.

470
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:40,905
[SPEAKER_07]: I see that there's a balance of power struggle as is.

471
01:09:40,945 --> 01:09:45,046
[SPEAKER_07]: And at least I'm a voice to say, you know, this is what we do on the city side.

472
01:09:45,086 --> 01:09:49,567
[SPEAKER_07]: This is, I love to, you know, this is how I think what we can afford.

473
01:09:49,627 --> 01:10:00,350
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there is, I said it online and I'll say it again, 99% of the time, I'm trying to caution the spending on the school side because

474
01:10:01,493 --> 01:10:17,009
[SPEAKER_07]: there needs to be somebody that has factual information on where we are, not even just come budget time, but knowing like, Hey, we can't go give X, Y, and Z because it's so out of balance with what we're doing on the city side.

475
01:10:17,189 --> 01:10:19,832
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's something we really can't afford.

476
01:10:20,473 --> 01:10:23,396
[SPEAKER_07]: So I feel like having the mayor on is important.

477
01:10:24,221 --> 01:10:40,133
[SPEAKER_07]: believe the mayor should be chair but I wanted to negotiate in good faith and and that's fine if the council doesn't want the mayor's chair moving forward but I think the mayor should be on the school committee and I said it in my press release I'd rather have the night night off to either be with my kids or to work on other

478
01:10:40,553 --> 01:11:03,711
[SPEAKER_07]: city issues because yeah, there is a lot of my plate, but the amount that I've learned, the amount that I've seen get right size and I've helped get right size, the amount of conversation that is brought between, especially the vice chair and I over the years and what we've been able to accomplish, um, the two of us and as a committee of the whole, as a whole, along with our superintendents that would not have all been able to get done.

479
01:11:04,471 --> 01:11:06,193
[SPEAKER_07]: without the mayor on the school committee.

480
01:11:06,814 --> 01:11:09,417
[SPEAKER_07]: So I, this is something that will be reviewed.

481
01:11:09,477 --> 01:11:13,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I know it's not two years from now, but it's 10 years.

482
01:11:14,223 --> 01:11:21,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't we change that to five and see how it goes with just the mayor on as a, as a, just about one voting member and not as the chair.

483
01:11:22,268 --> 01:11:24,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't we amend that tonight and compromise even more?

484
01:11:24,669 --> 01:11:27,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Relook at it in five years after this passes.

485
01:11:28,091 --> 01:11:31,333
[SPEAKER_07]: This is our last opportunity to get a charter passed.

486
01:11:31,673 --> 01:11:41,539
[SPEAKER_07]: And believe me, the frustration comes more for the fact that there was a politically diverse committee put together, and nobody can say that I interfered whatsoever.

487
01:11:41,719 --> 01:11:42,680
[SPEAKER_07]: It's quite the opposite.

488
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:51,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Anthony Andreatola from that committee interviewed me, and I felt his frustration because every question he asked, I believe except one, you know what I said?

489
01:11:51,146 --> 01:11:52,727
[SPEAKER_07]: What do the people want?

490
01:11:53,368 --> 01:11:54,328
[SPEAKER_07]: What does the survey say?

491
01:11:54,368 --> 01:11:56,190
[SPEAKER_07]: What does the call-in center say?

492
01:11:56,210 --> 01:11:59,692
[SPEAKER_07]: What does the charter study committee say?

493
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:03,675
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what I moved forward, because it's not about me.

494
01:12:04,156 --> 01:12:06,157
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's not about the current politicians.

495
01:12:06,217 --> 01:12:09,100
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about what we're going to see for potentially decades.

496
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:20,498
[SPEAKER_07]: So the compromise, change it to a five year and you wanted a study committee, which I think is normally made up of council and mayor appointments, but you want school committee appointments.

497
01:12:21,039 --> 01:12:21,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine.

498
01:12:21,941 --> 01:12:23,263
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll compromise on that too.

499
01:12:23,997 --> 01:12:27,040
[SPEAKER_07]: but let's get something done tonight so we can move this forward for the people.

500
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:28,000
[SPEAKER_07]: They deserve it.

501
01:12:28,301 --> 01:12:29,762
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been fighting for this for 10 years.

502
01:12:30,102 --> 01:12:35,266
[SPEAKER_07]: The first vote I took, I believe it was in 2000, either 15 or 16, Councilor Marks put it forward.

503
01:12:35,667 --> 01:12:38,989
[SPEAKER_07]: And then as mayor, I put it forward at least two more times, I believe.

504
01:12:39,049 --> 01:12:41,211
[SPEAKER_07]: So three times we got that four, three vote.

505
01:12:41,752 --> 01:12:47,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Our only other option was to put a study committee together, mostly left-leaning people, but it was politically diverse.

506
01:12:48,437 --> 01:12:51,860
[SPEAKER_07]: So to say like, we should have been all left-leaning because 70% of the population

507
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,641
[SPEAKER_07]: population is Democrat.

508
01:12:53,701 --> 01:12:57,824
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's argument.

509
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:02,507
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would, I would respectfully ask that we take a little bit of time to get this done.

510
01:13:05,448 --> 01:13:06,809
[SPEAKER_07]: We know that we're at the final hour.

511
01:13:06,829 --> 01:13:09,011
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it was, it was calling center.

512
01:13:09,031 --> 01:13:12,753
[SPEAKER_07]: We said we should have got this by the end of March, the latest by mid April.

513
01:13:12,873 --> 01:13:13,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here, here we are.

514
01:13:13,654 --> 01:13:15,615
[SPEAKER_07]: We're in the 15th, you know, of April.

515
01:13:17,497 --> 01:13:17,897
[SPEAKER_07]: and center.

516
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:23,521
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there's some votes that are going to be no, but I just asked you to take a hard look to reconsider.

517
01:13:23,621 --> 01:13:30,607
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we can make further amendments to when we review the charter again, um, that's just something that came to, came to my head.

518
01:13:30,627 --> 01:13:32,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, thank you for the time.

519
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:38,012
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know a couple of the committee members from the study committee want to speak, but I appreciate the time.

520
01:13:44,473 --> 01:13:45,953
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mayor.

521
01:13:46,234 --> 01:14:00,618
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm gonna go to Councilor Skarpel and Councilor Collins in just a second, but, okay, well, then I'll go to Councilor Skarpel and then Councilor Sang, but I just wanna note that we did submit a draft March 11th, three weeks before the end of March, six weeks before now.

522
01:14:01,758 --> 01:14:13,442
[SPEAKER_18]: And I also wanna note, I don't think anyone here has said that, has commented once about the political leanings of the members of the Charter Study Committee.

523
01:14:14,278 --> 01:14:26,143
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think there's a difference between quote unquote politically diverse representation decided by a single person making that determination and representativeness on a committee.

524
01:14:27,143 --> 01:14:33,286
[SPEAKER_18]: I think what the council has said and that really I think is troubling to me.

525
01:14:34,987 --> 01:14:37,168
[SPEAKER_18]: You started with saying you didn't think you had the votes.

526
01:14:37,328 --> 01:14:38,088
[SPEAKER_18]: I think you did.

527
01:14:38,788 --> 01:14:40,389
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think I'm the swing vote.

528
01:14:43,488 --> 01:14:52,149
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think anyone here has said, oh, we wanted, we're mad because of the political opinions of people on the study committee.

529
01:14:52,970 --> 01:14:56,030
[SPEAKER_18]: That is not been said here.

530
01:14:56,390 --> 01:15:01,011
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the question was, what was the council's and school committee's involvements in the creation of the study committee?

531
01:15:01,711 --> 01:15:07,312
[SPEAKER_18]: And does the study committee reflect the representation of the voters of the city?

532
01:15:08,512 --> 01:15:12,293
[SPEAKER_18]: And the answer is the council and the school committee were not involved at all in forming the study committee.

533
01:15:13,138 --> 01:15:24,523
[SPEAKER_18]: And the study committee was appointed by one person who apparently just said that their main consideration was political diversity based on their opinion of political diversity, not the representation of the city.

534
01:15:25,163 --> 01:15:33,827
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm not gonna comment further than that, but no one here has said, oh, the charter study committee is a problem because of people, the political opinions of the people on it.

535
01:15:34,268 --> 01:15:36,209
[SPEAKER_18]: And I include the person who made a death threat against me.

536
01:15:38,490 --> 01:15:39,350
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Scarpelli.

537
01:15:42,048 --> 01:15:52,318
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been reminded for the council to maybe read some of the blogs from members of this council, because I believe the word right wing was thrown around as part of that committee.

538
01:15:52,358 --> 01:15:56,041
[SPEAKER_15]: So just so you know, just an FYI, just an FYI.

539
01:15:56,502 --> 01:16:04,449
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think that, let's say everything my fellow colleagues are saying, that it wasn't enough time.

540
01:16:04,509 --> 01:16:07,512
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's say that all these issues we had were true.

541
01:16:09,548 --> 01:16:23,453
[SPEAKER_15]: But the document that we've had has gone back and forth to the mayor and we're all very bright, smart, involved counselors that have made some changes that the mayor has come back and said, fine, make those changes.

542
01:16:24,533 --> 01:16:25,193
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've done that.

543
01:16:25,273 --> 01:16:36,877
[SPEAKER_15]: We've done a lot of movement and we've had things that, to be honest with you, the mayor and I, that's public, I don't see eye to eye with many things the mayor has done.

544
01:16:37,853 --> 01:16:47,319
[SPEAKER_15]: But for this situation, I think she has looked for the greater good, what's right for our community, and what was put forth by the residents of this community.

545
01:16:47,779 --> 01:16:49,380
[SPEAKER_15]: We seem not to be mentioning this.

546
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:53,282
[SPEAKER_15]: The residents of the community have spoken.

547
01:16:54,623 --> 01:17:01,347
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's a resounding support of this document even before the changes.

548
01:17:02,908 --> 01:17:04,028
[SPEAKER_15]: We've seen some changes.

549
01:17:04,068 --> 01:17:05,069
[SPEAKER_15]: We've seen some movements.

550
01:17:05,089 --> 01:17:06,330
[SPEAKER_15]: We've seen the mayor step away.

551
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:08,981
[SPEAKER_15]: big piece of the eight and three.

552
01:17:09,001 --> 01:17:12,003
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate everybody seeing that and sticking with it.

553
01:17:13,825 --> 01:17:20,550
[SPEAKER_15]: But imagine from what I'm hearing tonight, the piece that's going to hold this up is the process.

554
01:17:20,790 --> 01:17:34,440
[SPEAKER_15]: If the mayor is a voting member of the school committee, imagine that being the only piece that doesn't allow this document through to the state that will give put this on the ballot so our residents can vote on it.

555
01:17:38,371 --> 01:17:41,153
[SPEAKER_15]: It just doesn't look good.

556
01:17:41,193 --> 01:17:48,139
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't show you or the community, the average person in this community that wants to know why this isn't happening.

557
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:49,560
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very simple.

558
01:17:51,161 --> 01:17:55,705
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks like there's alternative reasons behind it.

559
01:17:56,926 --> 01:18:02,711
[SPEAKER_15]: You could say no, but it looks like you're gonna hang your hat on this one issue

560
01:18:05,317 --> 01:18:13,964
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's so minimal and so minuscule to say that the importance of the mayor not being on the council for power.

561
01:18:14,484 --> 01:18:15,205
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on, guys.

562
01:18:15,765 --> 01:18:18,287
[SPEAKER_15]: Listen, I was on the council.

563
01:18:18,628 --> 01:18:23,612
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand when the mayor had total control of that council and that committee.

564
01:18:24,673 --> 01:18:27,475
[SPEAKER_15]: And this school committee is definitely not that anymore.

565
01:18:28,556 --> 01:18:30,537
[SPEAKER_15]: The mayor takes the back seat, and we've seen it.

566
01:18:32,059 --> 01:18:34,741
[SPEAKER_15]: We've seen it good in my eyes, and we've seen it bad in my eyes.

567
01:18:36,175 --> 01:18:53,859
[SPEAKER_15]: But to say that this is the reason why we're not gonna vote for this favorably is a sad description of what this council truly feels about what the residents want, what the residents have been asking for.

568
01:18:57,163 --> 01:18:58,664
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's not me against you.

569
01:19:00,224 --> 01:19:02,125
[SPEAKER_15]: You've been getting emails and phone calls.

570
01:19:02,145 --> 01:19:05,106
[SPEAKER_15]: So have I. I've gotten more than two.

571
01:19:05,746 --> 01:19:16,211
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've got a lot of people that never supported George Scott Pelley in the last eight years that are reaching out to me to try to be their voice because they feel they don't have a voice anymore.

572
01:19:18,632 --> 01:19:20,672
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm actually employed.

573
01:19:20,692 --> 01:19:24,494
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, I believe the Collins Center didn't say that.

574
01:19:24,514 --> 01:19:26,575
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe they said we don't have to wait 10 years.

575
01:19:27,917 --> 01:19:36,084
[SPEAKER_15]: If that's the case, I know this council said the representation of the committee, the charter review committee, switching the power around, right?

576
01:19:36,144 --> 01:19:39,948
[SPEAKER_15]: Giving more, more, put more councils, more school committee members.

577
01:19:40,228 --> 01:19:40,989
[SPEAKER_15]: No one questioned it.

578
01:19:41,029 --> 01:19:42,130
[SPEAKER_15]: They said, okay, that's what you want.

579
01:19:42,170 --> 01:19:42,610
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's do it.

580
01:19:43,591 --> 01:19:44,752
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's, it's put forth.

581
01:19:44,812 --> 01:19:45,433
[SPEAKER_15]: It's in front of you.

582
01:19:45,493 --> 01:19:48,896
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything you're at, we're asking for every change that you've asked for, they've made.

583
01:19:50,124 --> 01:19:55,085
[SPEAKER_15]: But there are two very important pieces, the eight and three, that I believe my fellow councilors, correct me if I'm wrong.

584
01:19:55,705 --> 01:19:58,066
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, let's do the eight, they've listened, eight and three.

585
01:19:59,286 --> 01:20:04,207
[SPEAKER_15]: So the last piece, the sticking piece, is going to be the mayor on the school committee.

586
01:20:05,147 --> 01:20:09,328
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, it's not this mayor, it's not this school committee alone.

587
01:20:10,188 --> 01:20:15,009
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the mayor and the school committee in two years, in four years, in eight years, in 10 years.

588
01:20:16,069 --> 01:20:18,630
[SPEAKER_15]: So I please, open your minds and please,

589
01:20:20,188 --> 01:20:21,269
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's put this forward.

590
01:20:21,309 --> 01:20:22,730
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's take that off the table.

591
01:20:23,111 --> 01:20:25,693
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's put forth Councilor Zaro's motion.

592
01:20:26,554 --> 01:20:28,475
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's send this to the Mayor 7-0.

593
01:20:28,735 --> 01:20:30,057
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's get this to the Statehouse.

594
01:20:30,337 --> 01:20:31,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's vote on this in November.

595
01:20:33,179 --> 01:20:34,560
[SPEAKER_15]: Because you know it as well as I do.

596
01:20:35,181 --> 01:20:36,062
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree with the Mayor.

597
01:20:36,991 --> 01:20:41,953
[SPEAKER_15]: if those changes, I feel strongly enough that I wouldn't want her to send this to the state house.

598
01:20:42,293 --> 01:20:55,079
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're taking the mayor out of that, because the truth of the matter is you're drastically changing the power of this, that committee away from the community and to individual people.

599
01:20:55,459 --> 01:20:56,500
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's not right.

600
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:58,261
[SPEAKER_15]: It's actually, I feel the opposite.

601
01:20:58,821 --> 01:20:58,941
[SPEAKER_15]: So

602
01:20:59,990 --> 01:21:01,870
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you again, Mr President, for hearing me out.

603
01:21:01,910 --> 01:21:09,612
[SPEAKER_15]: But I really think that we're at a very vulnerable crossroads, and it's we have an opportunity to do the right thing.

604
01:21:10,773 --> 01:21:24,156
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think that we're far, far away, and I think it's it's it's time that we maybe put some personal or political beliefs aside and say what's best for this community and listen to our residents.

605
01:21:24,856 --> 01:21:25,136
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

606
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:26,590
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

607
01:21:26,690 --> 01:21:33,654
[SPEAKER_18]: Was that a proposal to further amend the motion to move the first charter review to five years instead of 10 years?

608
01:21:34,895 --> 01:21:37,056
[SPEAKER_18]: You mentioned that we could do the first charter review earlier.

609
01:21:37,076 --> 01:21:38,677
[SPEAKER_18]: Right now it listed as 10 years.

610
01:21:38,737 --> 01:21:40,718
[SPEAKER_18]: The mayor suggested doing it in five years.

611
01:21:43,779 --> 01:21:44,520
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if it would help.

612
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:45,340
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just asking.

613
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:47,461
[SPEAKER_15]: I would say let's move that to five years.

614
01:21:47,842 --> 01:21:52,084
[SPEAKER_15]: If that would help this council to say, you know, I think there's been concessions.

615
01:21:52,244 --> 01:21:53,825
[SPEAKER_15]: I would make that motion if that would help.

616
01:21:55,893 --> 01:22:00,115
[SPEAKER_18]: Great, it doesn't need a second it just needs the main proponent to agree to it.

617
01:22:00,375 --> 01:22:00,655
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

618
01:22:01,835 --> 01:22:09,298
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, so the motion is now to restore the merit of the school committee but not as the chair and to have the first charter review in five years instead of 10 years.

619
01:22:09,618 --> 01:22:09,958
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

620
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:11,339
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, counselor saying.

621
01:22:12,739 --> 01:22:13,120
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

622
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:18,382
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I just want the public to note that they're kind of their two narratives out there.

623
01:22:18,622 --> 01:22:21,503
[SPEAKER_17]: One is, I think one is more.

624
01:22:22,427 --> 01:22:36,195
[SPEAKER_17]: realistic that everyone wants to do good, we disagree about the details, and that we're having a real deep conversation about how these policies would change our city and how they would apply, right?

625
01:22:36,955 --> 01:22:39,097
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's the camp I fall in.

626
01:22:39,637 --> 01:22:41,278
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want people to know that

627
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:49,977
[SPEAKER_17]: There's that more sinister narrative out there about ulterior motives, about political considerations.

628
01:22:50,798 --> 01:22:53,301
[SPEAKER_17]: I just think it's worth noting who's pushing what.

629
01:22:53,721 --> 01:23:06,033
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's worth noting that that's exactly the type of rhetoric at the national scale that's gotten us to political violence, to the governor of Pennsylvania's house being burnt down, to January 6th.

630
01:23:08,475 --> 01:23:10,096
[SPEAKER_17]: to things like that, right?

631
01:23:10,356 --> 01:23:13,959
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just want us to calm everything a little bit.

632
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:20,023
[SPEAKER_17]: Just let's be able to acknowledge that we can disagree agreeably.

633
01:23:21,524 --> 01:23:26,048
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know, I hear like gasps from the audience and stuff like that, but it's not crazy.

634
01:23:27,028 --> 01:23:32,472
[SPEAKER_17]: We've had, I know one member of this council has had multiple death threats in the last few months.

635
01:23:33,213 --> 01:23:37,496
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that, and from a member of the Charter Study Committee too,

636
01:23:38,462 --> 01:23:56,033
[SPEAKER_17]: And another member of the Charter Study Committee was posting misinformation about what our governance committees were doing, was doing, and the things that we talked about, the procedural things, me supposedly not inviting members of the committee to meetings, which I did, which I have email proof for.

637
01:23:56,794 --> 01:24:01,237
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I think it's really important for us to recognize

638
01:24:02,648 --> 01:24:07,869
[SPEAKER_17]: that we shouldn't fall into the trap that we're seeing all around the country and that we dislike.

639
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:13,571
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we can all agree, every single one of us in this room, that those things are bad.

640
01:24:14,371 --> 01:24:16,172
[SPEAKER_17]: And we shouldn't encourage that.

641
01:24:16,492 --> 01:24:17,632
[SPEAKER_17]: We shouldn't feed that.

642
01:24:18,252 --> 01:24:22,513
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we should all work to lower the tenor a little bit.

643
01:24:22,813 --> 01:24:25,274
[SPEAKER_17]: But I do think we need to call it out when it happens.

644
01:24:25,414 --> 01:24:30,556
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think for far too long on the city council, over the last two years, we haven't been doing that.

645
01:24:36,169 --> 01:24:43,472
[SPEAKER_17]: I respectfully disagree that the mayor and school committee or off the school committee is not a small question.

646
01:24:43,492 --> 01:24:51,336
[SPEAKER_17]: I do think it's quite literally the biggest question you could ask for one of our three branches of government here in Medford.

647
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:55,299
[SPEAKER_17]: Which is why it merits an actual conversation.

648
01:24:55,319 --> 01:25:00,423
[SPEAKER_17]: I know all of us approached it from different degrees from different angles.

649
01:25:01,123 --> 01:25:08,589
[SPEAKER_17]: I, you know, the one of the reasons why I didn't push for this earlier on was because number one I was chairing those meetings I couldn't make motions.

650
01:25:10,069 --> 01:25:18,052
[SPEAKER_17]: At those motions, I tried to present different viewpoints on different issues, make sure that all of that was articulated.

651
01:25:18,953 --> 01:25:22,294
[SPEAKER_17]: And we had comments from the school committee members that did that.

652
01:25:22,314 --> 01:25:32,898
[SPEAKER_17]: But I also didn't bring it up because I thought that we could get a better faith negotiation with the position that the city council took earlier on.

653
01:25:32,958 --> 01:25:35,599
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think maybe I was a little silly to assume that.

654
01:25:37,599 --> 01:25:47,486
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe it was a little silly to assume that people would be listening, that the people I'd be negotiating with would listen to policy concerns I had about different things, about a whole litany of things.

655
01:25:47,646 --> 01:25:51,128
[SPEAKER_17]: And I didn't completely feel listened to about that.

656
01:25:52,329 --> 01:25:57,153
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think with that being said, I'm still not completely decided on this vote yet either.

657
01:26:01,262 --> 01:26:02,823
[SPEAKER_17]: I recognize the reality on the ground.

658
01:26:03,064 --> 01:26:06,026
[SPEAKER_17]: I recognize the policy principles that cut in both directions.

659
01:26:07,928 --> 01:26:16,675
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the mayor is misunderstanding the points that members of the public, that school committee members, that I brought up with regards to conflict of interest.

660
01:26:17,115 --> 01:26:28,385
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not necessarily purely financial, but I actually think in the mayor's remarks, she brought up the very conflict of interest that is at the core of the mayor being on school committee, which is that

661
01:26:29,942 --> 01:26:37,328
[SPEAKER_17]: the mayor, you know, their job is to make sure that the running of the city, you know, like cities running in a certain way.

662
01:26:38,129 --> 01:26:42,953
[SPEAKER_17]: And the job of the school committee is to advocate for the schools to the best extent that they can.

663
01:26:43,413 --> 01:26:47,797
[SPEAKER_17]: And those two jobs, those two things often do clash.

664
01:26:48,277 --> 01:26:55,043
[SPEAKER_17]: And so asking the school committee to hold back on important recommendations that would help our teachers, that would help our students,

665
01:26:55,859 --> 01:27:01,183
[SPEAKER_17]: that is inherently a conflict of interest, and that goes against what the school committee is for.

666
01:27:01,923 --> 01:27:05,005
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, I mean, I'll leave that there.

667
01:27:05,766 --> 01:27:16,433
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that, I still think that there are policy arguments that are caught in favor of having the mayor on the school committee, but I think I wanted to explain that point in more depth.

668
01:27:18,873 --> 01:27:31,760
[SPEAKER_17]: I think, to the point of the representativeness of the Charter Study Committee, I think there are a million ways to go about it, but I don't even think the average conservative in our city would

669
01:27:33,169 --> 01:27:37,773
[SPEAKER_17]: send death threats to members of this body.

670
01:27:38,273 --> 01:27:48,181
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think the average conservative in this city would be posting targeted misinformation on social media about things that we've been doing.

671
01:27:49,021 --> 01:27:55,286
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I can respect the push for political representativeness.

672
01:27:56,107 --> 01:27:58,769
[SPEAKER_17]: But if that's the metric, we're still failing.

673
01:28:00,310 --> 01:28:01,451
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's really important.

674
01:28:02,742 --> 01:28:09,504
[SPEAKER_17]: to note that there's been a real lack of BIPOC representation on the Charter Study Committee as well.

675
01:28:11,985 --> 01:28:16,666
[SPEAKER_17]: The Asian community is the biggest minority community in our city, and there weren't any Asian people on the committee.

676
01:28:16,686 --> 01:28:21,847
[SPEAKER_17]: A historically Black community wasn't represented on the committee.

677
01:28:22,247 --> 01:28:25,308
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know what?

678
01:28:26,849 --> 01:28:32,070
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that it's really important for us going forward to make sure that that representation is there.

679
01:28:33,390 --> 01:28:37,920
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's a major qualm I have about the process.

680
01:28:38,221 --> 01:28:42,169
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if it's enough to have me

681
01:28:42,962 --> 01:28:45,124
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, vote to kill any effort.

682
01:28:45,284 --> 01:28:46,745
[SPEAKER_17]: That's certainly not my intention.

683
01:28:47,265 --> 01:28:59,755
[SPEAKER_17]: And I actually, that's another thing I want to clear up, is I actually do think, I haven't like asked, but I do actually think, judging from our comments on the floor, every single one of us wants to vote on something tonight.

684
01:29:00,135 --> 01:29:02,517
[SPEAKER_17]: And we all want to vote out a version of the charter tonight.

685
01:29:02,957 --> 01:29:10,183
[SPEAKER_17]: Whether we all vote yes or no is another question, because we might disagree on what's best in that charter, and what the

686
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:24,068
[SPEAKER_17]: the balance of considerations looks like, but I do think that we all are approaching this with good intent, that we're all trying to create a product that would work for our city.

687
01:29:25,889 --> 01:29:32,793
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll just end with being grateful to Councillor Scarpelli for introducing the five-year review or asking for that amendment.

688
01:29:33,753 --> 01:29:35,414
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that would make a lot of sense here.

689
01:29:35,915 --> 01:29:37,435
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it would alleviate a lot of my worries.

690
01:29:40,786 --> 01:29:41,286
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

691
01:29:41,386 --> 01:29:46,590
[SPEAKER_18]: And to Councillor Sang's point, you know, I know a lot of people have been saying, well, what does the council think about this?

692
01:29:47,311 --> 01:30:07,506
[SPEAKER_18]: Because there's been press releases and statements and social media posts really encourage people to watch what is certainly now approaching the 20 hours of public meetings, where I believe everyone, at least when it comes to our comments about what we think about the charter, has said, this is what I think, and I take that in good faith.

693
01:30:09,349 --> 01:30:18,159
[SPEAKER_18]: the comments to the otherwise from anyone saying actually, they're lying, and they're liars, I don't think are really helpful or accurate.

694
01:30:20,041 --> 01:30:21,242
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you had your hand raised.

695
01:30:21,483 --> 01:30:21,643
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

696
01:30:21,923 --> 01:30:26,909
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, I'll go to Councilor Collins and then I did see the mayor, who I will go back to Councilor Collins.

697
01:30:28,482 --> 01:30:29,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President bears quickly.

698
01:30:30,164 --> 01:30:44,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, while I was looking at the amendment proposed by counselors Carpelli in section nine for to change the first periodic review of the charter to within five years of the charter's approval I noticed in section nine for subsection

699
01:30:46,525 --> 01:30:58,395
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe a motion was passed one week ago to amend that section so that it would reflect three appointees of the mayor, three appointees of the city council, and three appointees of the school committee, but that is still reflected as four, three, and two.

700
01:30:58,415 --> 01:31:00,557
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe that motion passed.

701
01:31:00,897 --> 01:31:10,245
[SPEAKER_18]: So I want to make sure that- Sorry, that may have been a clerical error by me as we have not had assistance on any of this in terms of putting together red line drafts.

702
01:31:10,285 --> 01:31:12,127
[SPEAKER_18]: So yes, that should read three, three, three.

703
01:31:12,147 --> 01:31:12,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

704
01:31:13,845 --> 01:31:14,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

705
01:31:14,265 --> 01:31:18,047
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to flag that and make sure that it made it into the final version that we take a vote on tonight.

706
01:31:20,808 --> 01:31:33,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there will be things that will have a variety of contentment with the draft that we vote on tonight, but I also want to make sure that our procedure for going forward is at least reflective of the motions that we made.

707
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:44,203
[SPEAKER_03]: not about emotion, but I just want to state because of a couple of comments from a couple of different people that I've heard in this.

708
01:31:44,543 --> 01:31:57,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it's a couple of comments that I've heard from elected in the past 15 minutes or so, and something that has characterized this process, not to mention a lot of other discussion topics before this Council this entire term.

709
01:31:58,789 --> 01:32:02,491
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that we do a really good job of talking to each other productively when we share

710
01:32:03,659 --> 01:32:09,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Our feelings and our preferences and our rationales and we make a lot of ground we have a lot of meetings we have a lot of productive conversations.

711
01:32:10,604 --> 01:32:15,888
[SPEAKER_03]: When we engage with a topic and we say why we feel a certain way on that topic.

712
01:32:17,068 --> 01:32:21,852
[SPEAKER_03]: This chart review process in the city council chambers, in particular, has been characterized by.

713
01:32:25,495 --> 01:32:34,442
[SPEAKER_03]: some people choosing not to explain why they feel the way that they do, but rather illustratively ascribing motivations to other people.

714
01:32:38,497 --> 01:32:54,147
[SPEAKER_03]: It is really frustrating that not all electeds can just rest on the laurels of their own opinions and have to time and time again resort to the political manipulation of putting words in people's mouths, speculating about what the public will perceive in other people's actions.

715
01:32:54,207 --> 01:32:55,949
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think it cheapens this process.

716
01:32:56,489 --> 01:32:57,750
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish we could leave it in behind.

717
01:32:58,310 --> 01:32:59,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that can die with this process.

718
01:32:59,931 --> 01:33:00,932
[SPEAKER_03]: It is really tiring.

719
01:33:02,093 --> 01:33:03,494
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't make any of us look good.

720
01:33:05,775 --> 01:33:07,056
[SPEAKER_03]: But I hope that all electeds

721
01:33:13,861 --> 01:33:14,321
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

722
01:33:17,462 --> 01:33:19,382
[SPEAKER_18]: And just an FYI for members of the public.

723
01:33:19,862 --> 01:33:22,743
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going through Council discussion and Council motions on this paper.

724
01:33:23,543 --> 01:33:34,285
[SPEAKER_18]: Once all counselors have made discussion items or other motions that they want to make on this paper, and it has been amended, then we will open public participation on the paper before a final vote.

725
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:38,947
[SPEAKER_18]: And it also sounds like a lot of B paper, so we'd be doing that for both of those papers.

726
01:33:40,172 --> 01:34:01,267
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there any further discussion by members of the council or the mayor who is the petitioner who put this before the council on the question, the motion before us, which is to restore the mayor to the school committee, but not as the chair and to further amend that motion to have in section nine for the first charter review in five years.

727
01:34:02,127 --> 01:34:05,950
[SPEAKER_18]: And then every 10 years thereafter, vice president Collins.

728
01:34:06,702 --> 01:34:10,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I wanted to make a request that we sever the different aspects of that motion.

729
01:34:11,105 --> 01:34:11,706
[SPEAKER_03]: When we take a vote.

730
01:34:12,526 --> 01:34:12,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

731
01:34:17,990 --> 01:34:24,555
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion to sever seconded by Councilor Lazaro Mr. Clear, all those in favor, actually first time in a little bit we've had everyone.

732
01:34:25,476 --> 01:34:27,237
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor, I opposed.

733
01:34:28,698 --> 01:34:30,780
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, we'll vote separately on those two questions.

734
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:34,683
[SPEAKER_18]: Madam Mayor, feel free if you want to raise your hand, I did see you earlier.

735
01:34:36,197 --> 01:34:40,799
[SPEAKER_18]: If you wanted to say anything more on this since you were the one who submitted this to us.

736
01:34:46,021 --> 01:34:47,882
[SPEAKER_18]: Not seeing the hand will vote.

737
01:34:49,643 --> 01:34:50,183
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, she just did.

738
01:34:50,263 --> 01:34:51,283
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, we'll go to the mayor.

739
01:34:56,265 --> 01:34:59,067
[SPEAKER_18]: Floor is yours Madam Mayor, I just, I didn't want to.

740
01:35:00,638 --> 01:35:01,879
[SPEAKER_07]: misspeak, that was never.

741
01:35:01,899 --> 01:35:03,860
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't mean to upset you either.

742
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:06,321
[SPEAKER_07]: That wasn't never said on the floor that I'm aware of.

743
01:35:06,621 --> 01:35:10,843
[SPEAKER_07]: It was said to me personally, but I would never vouch who made what argument.

744
01:35:11,243 --> 01:35:13,944
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I just wanted to point out that somebody else has their hand up.

745
01:35:14,265 --> 01:35:15,525
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you're letting the public speak.

746
01:35:16,085 --> 01:35:16,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

747
01:35:17,326 --> 01:35:26,590
[SPEAKER_18]: The public will speak on the papers once we finish council discussion and motions to amend, but we will have public participation once we've gone through all of the council discussions and motions.

748
01:35:27,251 --> 01:35:28,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

749
01:35:29,172 --> 01:35:29,872
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

750
01:35:34,368 --> 01:35:38,691
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, any further discussion by members of the council on the motion to amend as severed?

751
01:35:39,972 --> 01:35:50,360
[SPEAKER_18]: Seeing none, the first vote would be on the motion to amend for the first charter review in five years and then every 10 years thereafter.

752
01:35:52,162 --> 01:35:52,982
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

753
01:35:55,784 --> 01:35:55,905
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

754
01:35:56,245 --> 01:35:56,725
[SPEAKER_18]: Opposed?

755
01:35:57,886 --> 01:35:58,627
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes.

756
01:36:02,951 --> 01:36:07,774
[SPEAKER_18]: And I might ask Councilor Collins to do a copy of it before I send this final, final thing back.

757
01:36:07,794 --> 01:36:09,935
[SPEAKER_18]: So I make sure that we captured everything we voted on.

758
01:36:13,276 --> 01:36:19,039
[SPEAKER_18]: That leaves the first half of this motion, which is to restore the mayor to the school committee, but not as chair.

759
01:36:20,740 --> 01:36:23,262
[SPEAKER_18]: Both of these are councilors are seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

760
01:36:25,183 --> 01:36:27,044
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Scarpelli has requested a roll call vote.

761
01:36:27,104 --> 01:36:29,425
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

762
01:36:49,850 --> 01:36:53,171
[SPEAKER_10]: roll call vote to on the on the question of putting the mayor on the school committee.

763
01:36:54,131 --> 01:36:54,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Council Callahan.

764
01:36:56,892 --> 01:36:57,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Collins.

765
01:36:59,452 --> 01:37:00,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Lazaro.

766
01:37:01,913 --> 01:37:02,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Lemming.

767
01:37:04,553 --> 01:37:05,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli.

768
01:37:07,054 --> 01:37:10,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor saying President bears.

769
01:37:13,636 --> 01:37:15,096
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I thought it'd be this way and I was wrong.

770
01:37:16,656 --> 01:37:19,157
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

771
01:37:20,242 --> 01:37:21,062
[SPEAKER_18]: motion passes.

772
01:37:22,763 --> 01:37:27,164
[SPEAKER_18]: So clearly groupthink and our ulterior motives are absolutely true.

773
01:37:38,486 --> 01:37:38,866
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

774
01:37:39,747 --> 01:37:41,447
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Zaro, you had mentioned a B paper.

775
01:37:48,670 --> 01:37:49,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

776
01:37:49,971 --> 01:38:01,678
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to release a press release we don't often have the opportunity to share with the public a cohesive version of our

777
01:38:03,772 --> 01:38:14,740
[SPEAKER_04]: actions here, short of the monthly newsletter that's released as part of our, there's like four members who are not listening to me.

778
01:38:15,721 --> 01:38:17,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Five members maybe, while I'm talking right now.

779
01:38:17,803 --> 01:38:20,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to members of the council, if we could.

780
01:38:20,585 --> 01:38:21,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Should I wait?

781
01:38:21,045 --> 01:38:21,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I can wait.

782
01:38:21,846 --> 01:38:22,266
[SPEAKER_18]: We can wait.

783
01:38:22,406 --> 01:38:22,766
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll wait.

784
01:38:22,786 --> 01:38:23,247
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll wait.

785
01:38:23,427 --> 01:38:24,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's wait a second.

786
01:38:24,027 --> 01:38:24,307
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll wait.

787
01:38:24,608 --> 01:38:24,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

788
01:38:25,208 --> 01:38:27,630
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll wait for everyone to be paying attention before we keep moving forward.

789
01:38:27,670 --> 01:38:27,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we ready?

790
01:38:28,110 --> 01:38:28,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

791
01:38:28,751 --> 01:38:29,131
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

792
01:38:29,271 --> 01:38:29,611
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay.

793
01:38:32,173 --> 01:38:33,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, that's okay.

794
01:38:33,534 --> 01:38:34,454
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was multiple.

795
01:38:34,514 --> 01:38:34,974
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay.

796
01:38:35,295 --> 01:38:36,095
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just you guys.

797
01:38:38,436 --> 01:38:44,359
[SPEAKER_18]: Before I go to, sorry, before I go to the motion to be paper, actually, I do have the mayor.

798
01:38:44,819 --> 01:38:44,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

799
01:38:45,079 --> 01:38:45,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

800
01:38:45,719 --> 01:38:46,800
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

801
01:38:50,962 --> 01:38:51,962
[SPEAKER_18]: Just want to recognize you mayor.

802
01:38:51,982 --> 01:38:52,523
[SPEAKER_18]: I saw your hand up.

803
01:38:52,563 --> 01:38:54,844
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know if it was, Oh, no, I'm so sorry.

804
01:38:54,864 --> 01:38:55,604
[SPEAKER_07]: It must've been left up.

805
01:38:55,624 --> 01:38:57,085
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

806
01:38:57,325 --> 01:38:57,725
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

807
01:39:01,984 --> 01:39:03,425
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, continue counselors are.

808
01:39:05,206 --> 01:39:16,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so we don't often have opportunities to release a cohesive version of events for large votes that we take.

809
01:39:16,535 --> 01:39:19,817
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I would like to offer an opportunity for us to.

810
01:39:21,879 --> 01:39:26,384
[SPEAKER_04]: With the exception of our newsletter that we put out once a month from the Resident Services Committee.

811
01:39:27,545 --> 01:39:38,637
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would like to offer a press release that we can vote on to have the city clerk send electronically

812
01:39:39,941 --> 01:40:01,948
[SPEAKER_04]: and uh i think we should personally if this is a press release yes i think we should ask to be posted the way any other press released via the um communications director the mayor's office would that be possible is that are we do we have access to that well i think we're we're a city body asking for a press release so have it distributed the way they all are um so i emailed it to

813
01:40:03,408 --> 01:40:10,375
[SPEAKER_04]: The clerk, if that is something that we can circulate it to the council, but I can read it out.

814
01:40:11,696 --> 01:40:13,497
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's sure.

815
01:40:15,174 --> 01:40:27,538
[SPEAKER_04]: So it says for immediate release, April 16, 2025, this would be for tomorrow with President Bair's contact, Medford City Council submit second amended charter to mayor for submission to the state legislature.

816
01:40:27,558 --> 01:40:43,382
[SPEAKER_04]: The city council voted if once we were to take the vote, we would adjust this based on how the vote goes to approve the amended charter, which would go before voters in November, 2025, if approved by the mayor and the legislature.

817
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:45,342
[SPEAKER_04]: PB, Lisa Smith-Miyazaki, she, her, hers.

818
01:40:52,503 --> 01:41:08,577
[SPEAKER_04]: quote, with Tuesday's vote, the Medford City Council has once again fulfilled its role in the charter review process by approving a new city charter for consideration by Medford voters, this vote followed three months of deliberation by the city council on a new version of the city's core governing document.

819
01:41:08,957 --> 01:41:13,862
[SPEAKER_04]: During these meetings counselors considered the research and evidence presented by each counselor the final report

820
01:41:14,422 --> 01:41:22,123
[SPEAKER_04]: of the Charter Study Committee, edits made by the mayor in January and April, information and comments made by staff from the Edward J. Collins, Jr.

821
01:41:22,163 --> 01:41:27,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Center for Public Management at UMass Boston, and comments and ideas from Medford residents.

822
01:41:27,544 --> 01:41:42,987
[SPEAKER_04]: This charter review process began in 2022, following an insufficient number of signatures being collected to initiate a home rule charter process and an insufficient 4-3 vote by the Medford City Council to request state legislative approval for an appointed Charter Review Committee.

823
01:41:43,767 --> 01:41:52,610
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2022, the Mayor appointed a Charter Study Committee, CSC, charged with developing a draft charter for the Mayor to submit to the City Council for consideration.

824
01:41:53,250 --> 01:42:01,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Over the next two years, the CSC collected public feedback and met with the Collins Center, resulting in a final report and a draft charter submitted to the Mayor in December 2024.

825
01:42:03,249 --> 01:42:17,145
[SPEAKER_04]: The city council began considerations, when the mayor submitted her edited version of the CSC draft charter in January 2025 with a short timeline to approve a draft by early April, to ensure it was approved by the legislature in time for the November 2025 election.

826
01:42:18,767 --> 01:42:32,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Council President Behrs and Councilor Sang, chair of the council's governance committee, had requested earlier meetings to begin council consideration of the CSC's proposals, but accepted a request by the mayor's office to wait until the CSC had submitted its final report.

827
01:42:33,793 --> 01:42:42,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Over several meetings, the city council made amendments to the mayor's draft and approved an amended city charter to submit to the mayor on March 11, 2025 by a six to zero vote, one absent.

828
01:42:45,038 --> 01:43:00,845
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor returned this draft to the council on April 1 2025 with further amendments, which the city council considered on April 8 2025 and discussed further amended and approved imagining again that'll be subject to change at its April 15 2025 special meeting.

829
01:43:02,832 --> 01:43:18,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Per the standard practices of the Medford House of Representatives and Massachusetts Senate, as well as advised from the Collins Center, the legislature is much more likely to approve Home Rule petitions like the Special Act Charter when the local legislative body approves them by a unanimous or near unanimous vote.

830
01:43:19,243 --> 01:43:31,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Both of the council's votes on amended city charter drafts fulfilled this condition, assuming obviously, with a six to zero vote, one absent for the March 11, 2025 version and a X to X vote for the April 15, 2025 version.

831
01:43:33,092 --> 01:43:39,914
[SPEAKER_04]: The council encourages the mayor to submit either approved version for the new city charter to the legislature for its approval.

832
01:43:40,374 --> 01:43:44,074
[SPEAKER_04]: So voters can adopt or reject a new city charter at the ballot box in November 2025.

833
01:43:44,374 --> 01:43:54,837
[SPEAKER_04]: The city council strongly believes that voters will adopt a new charter and that either of the documents the council has submitted to the mayor would serve as a strong governing document for the future of Medford.

834
01:43:58,718 --> 01:44:00,038
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councillor Lazaro.

835
01:44:01,729 --> 01:44:20,992
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there any discussion by members of the council on the B paper proposed by Councilors are seconded by Councillor Callahan to have this press release sent out through the city's press release, posting on the city website and however, any other press releases are sent out.

836
01:44:24,293 --> 01:44:30,334
[SPEAKER_18]: Any discussion on specific language, or, or any other elements of it, Councillor Callahan.

837
01:44:32,542 --> 01:44:38,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we going to vote on the charter approval before we vote on this one?

838
01:44:38,565 --> 01:44:40,005
[SPEAKER_18]: No, we'll vote on the B paper first.

839
01:44:41,386 --> 01:44:43,107
[SPEAKER_18]: There are highlighted sections in here.

840
01:44:45,088 --> 01:44:50,010
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Lazaro, it looks like those are the ones that would describe what happens in the vote.

841
01:44:50,150 --> 01:44:53,011
[SPEAKER_18]: Technically, it's an A. We have to vote on the main paper last.

842
01:44:54,112 --> 01:44:59,274
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there are a number of sections that

843
01:45:01,013 --> 01:45:04,134
[SPEAKER_04]: are highlighted that are subject to change.

844
01:45:04,154 --> 01:45:11,197
[SPEAKER_04]: So the motion would be to approve and the highlighted sections will be changed after the final vote.

845
01:45:11,297 --> 01:45:16,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's the one that says both of the- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

846
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:18,561
[SPEAKER_06]: So that one is a little- I can highlight that one.

847
01:45:18,601 --> 01:45:22,802
[SPEAKER_18]: If you want to increase that highlight to- I can highlight that one.

848
01:45:23,383 --> 01:45:23,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

849
01:45:24,763 --> 01:45:28,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if you just want to say that- I just don't want to approve this if that language isn't there because we haven't taken it out yet.

850
01:45:30,488 --> 01:45:38,371
[SPEAKER_18]: Could we put an amendment forward that the clerk and I will adjust any sections that councilors deem necessary to reflect the final decision of the council on the main paper?

851
01:45:38,391 --> 01:45:40,772
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that a fair amendment?

852
01:45:41,392 --> 01:45:42,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm comfortable with that.

853
01:45:43,413 --> 01:45:44,673
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, so we'll work on that.

854
01:45:45,353 --> 01:45:47,794
[SPEAKER_18]: Make sure that the final docket reflects what we vote on.

855
01:45:50,435 --> 01:45:51,075
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Sang.

856
01:45:52,516 --> 01:45:54,997
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Zara for putting this together.

857
01:45:55,017 --> 01:45:57,338
[SPEAKER_17]: I think all in all, this looks good.

858
01:45:59,425 --> 01:46:06,809
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if it really is representative of our discussions completely as a council.

859
01:46:07,689 --> 01:46:25,138
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think even one sentence in there, even if it's framed in the conciliatory tone, a nice tone, would be helpful to kind of just say like, councillors registered the satisfaction with the process or

860
01:46:26,312 --> 01:46:28,213
[SPEAKER_17]: balance of power issues or something like that.

861
01:46:28,353 --> 01:46:33,736
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that would help me feel like this is a bit more accurate.

862
01:46:34,016 --> 01:46:47,144
[SPEAKER_17]: And then of course, in the same sentence, we can say that we talked through it and got to this place where, you know, and hope, you know, we hope this moves on and we hope this, you know, but I think that would be more realistic about what actually happened.

863
01:46:47,924 --> 01:46:49,325
[SPEAKER_17]: So maybe at the end of the

864
01:46:51,664 --> 01:47:10,699
[SPEAKER_18]: Paragraph ending over several meetings so the fabric beginning over several meetings some sort of sentence that says, you know, if you want to characterize it or counselors are if you have a suggestion, whichever one of you wants to make a proposal for a sentence that indicates that the council had significant disagreements about the process and the outcomes.

865
01:47:15,891 --> 01:47:44,962
[SPEAKER_04]: So my thinking here is that since this is representative of the whole council, I am hesitant to put, I mean, I think that we could put something in that says, in the spirit of compromise, differing opinions, like something that indicates that we, this is why it's hard to, and I've received, as councilors have all mentioned, we've received messages from the public talking about how like,

866
01:47:47,334 --> 01:47:49,475
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you guys should communicate something to us.

867
01:47:49,536 --> 01:47:51,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us where you're at with the charter.

868
01:47:51,637 --> 01:47:57,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Explain to us why, you know, and we can't, because we're seven individual people.

869
01:47:57,562 --> 01:47:59,063
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't speak with one voice.

870
01:47:59,123 --> 01:48:12,733
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't really, you know, this doesn't have, it doesn't have like a, you know, we all have different thoughts and opinions and feelings.

871
01:48:15,332 --> 01:48:30,283
[SPEAKER_04]: on like so many different things in this charter that I feel like if we are to put out a press release that says anything about an opinion, it's gonna be not really representative of everybody on the council.

872
01:48:30,303 --> 01:48:31,724
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's my hesitation.

873
01:48:31,825 --> 01:48:43,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we could say over several meetings, compromises were reached with degrees of

874
01:48:43,882 --> 01:48:45,162
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't know.

875
01:48:45,302 --> 01:48:57,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you have to kind of not say that like, you can say that councilors expressed a variety of different opinions, but like, it's kind of, it almost at that point feels unnecessary to me till then.

876
01:48:57,547 --> 01:49:00,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, right, cause it's like.

877
01:49:00,948 --> 01:49:02,168
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President.

878
01:49:02,188 --> 01:49:10,831
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not saying that we, you know, say as a council that we like disagreed with different things about the thing.

879
01:49:11,071 --> 01:49:12,912
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we just say like, I think we can just say like,

880
01:49:13,905 --> 01:49:18,589
[SPEAKER_17]: a number of city councilors shared opinions about something.

881
01:49:19,090 --> 01:49:28,358
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm drafting something quick right now, and then end on the note of, but reach this version of the draft charter in the spirit of compromise.

882
01:49:29,279 --> 01:49:29,479
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

883
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:35,544
[SPEAKER_17]: But I do think it'd be worth it to note some of the things that did come up.

884
01:49:36,766 --> 01:49:45,693
[SPEAKER_17]: Even if it's five years on, 10 years on, we're reviewing the charter and we're just reviewing the record to see what issues that come up.

885
01:49:47,975 --> 01:49:56,661
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think there's a way to do it by not saying that the whole committee, the whole council thought that way, or that we disagreed with the final product.

886
01:49:56,702 --> 01:50:03,507
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we still wanna emphasize that if this passes, that it is the product of compromise.

887
01:50:04,311 --> 01:50:26,089
[SPEAKER_18]: Something like while many counselors raised serious questions and voice strong opinions about issues of policy and process, and we could get more specific if we wanted to say issues of representation, balance of power and other elements of the other policies and elements of the process in the experience of compromise the council voted to a drop this draft unanimously.

888
01:50:26,109 --> 01:50:27,571
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I think that sounds perfect.

889
01:50:27,731 --> 01:50:28,051
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

890
01:50:29,993 --> 01:50:31,113
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll say representation.

891
01:50:33,394 --> 01:50:34,274
[SPEAKER_18]: Balance of power.

892
01:50:34,294 --> 01:50:38,696
[SPEAKER_17]: I do want this to be a strong statement.

893
01:50:38,716 --> 01:50:42,717
[SPEAKER_17]: I also think it should reflect the conversations that we actually had.

894
01:50:43,078 --> 01:50:47,279
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, 20 hours if people want to watch and hear what we actually think and not what people say we think.

895
01:50:52,181 --> 01:50:59,624
[SPEAKER_18]: Issues of representation, balance of power, other policies, and the process.

896
01:51:01,882 --> 01:51:02,462
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's OK.

897
01:51:02,703 --> 01:51:14,109
[SPEAKER_18]: So it reads, while many councilors raise serious questions and voice strong opinions about issues of representation, balance of power, other policies, and the process in the spirit of compromise, the council adopted this draft unanimously.

898
01:51:14,770 --> 01:51:16,651
[SPEAKER_18]: And obviously, that assumes we adopted it unanimously.

899
01:51:17,431 --> 01:51:21,914
[SPEAKER_18]: So if not, I would change that to adopted this draft by a vote of whatever.

900
01:51:23,515 --> 01:51:23,775
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

901
01:51:25,356 --> 01:51:31,500
[SPEAKER_18]: Any further discussion on this B paper?

902
01:51:36,625 --> 01:51:39,647
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, is there any discussion by members of the public on the B paper?

903
01:51:39,687 --> 01:51:53,095
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, the B paper is the council's press release regarding the vote that we will take on the A paper after we dispose of the B paper.

904
01:51:55,776 --> 01:52:02,820
[SPEAKER_18]: Please come to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom if you have a public comment on the press release draft B paper.

905
01:52:04,161 --> 01:52:05,742
[SPEAKER_18]: I see Pete Morrison on Zoom.

906
01:52:14,615 --> 01:52:16,356
[SPEAKER_18]: name and address for the record, you have three minutes.

907
01:52:17,397 --> 01:52:21,360
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is on the B paper of the council press release.

908
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:24,622
[SPEAKER_02]: I have had my hand up for almost an hour.

909
01:52:25,082 --> 01:52:36,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no comment on the paper, but I don't want to take my hand on because I have comments to make about several, about a dozen of the points that were brought up in conversations.

910
01:52:36,871 --> 01:52:43,135
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't have one so much on the release, but I still want to be heard about why I've had my hand up for almost an hour.

911
01:52:44,171 --> 01:52:45,272
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely yes we will.

912
01:52:45,292 --> 01:52:45,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

913
01:52:46,372 --> 01:52:46,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

914
01:52:52,095 --> 01:53:11,906
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyone else who wants to talk about the B paper the press release on the motion of Councilor Lazaro seconded by Councilor Callahan as amended by Councilor saying that we have this press release to be posted on the city website and released through the city's press release outlets.

915
01:53:14,064 --> 01:53:14,805
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

916
01:53:16,526 --> 01:53:17,147
[SPEAKER_18]: Opposed?

917
01:53:18,148 --> 01:53:19,049
[SPEAKER_18]: The motion passes.

918
01:53:20,830 --> 01:53:40,508
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, we have the A paper, which has one amendment, which is to restore the mayor to the school committee, but not as the chair and to further amend section nine dash four so that the first charter review occurs within five years and every 10 years thereafter.

919
01:53:42,262 --> 01:53:45,385
[SPEAKER_18]: And I can read through the other changes if we want to do that just to make sure.

920
01:53:45,405 --> 01:53:50,489
[SPEAKER_18]: These will be changes from the draft submitted by the mayor so this would include the votes taken on April 8.

921
01:54:07,612 --> 01:54:18,559
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, the first changes in section two dash one see, which just says a word counselor shall be a voter in the word from which election is sought, removing the words for at least one year prior to the date of inauguration.

922
01:54:21,941 --> 01:54:23,642
[SPEAKER_18]: The second change.

923
01:54:25,488 --> 01:54:42,894
[SPEAKER_18]: is in section to dash nine, where the first sentence reads the mayor shall refer to the city council and simultaneously file with the city clerk, the name of each person the mayor desires to appoint as a city officer department head or member of the multiple member body for whom no other method of appointment or selection is provided by charter or ordinance.

924
01:54:46,917 --> 01:55:02,568
[SPEAKER_18]: Under section three, it reads the same, the mayor shall appoint subject to the review of such appointments by the city council under section two dash nine all city officers and department heads and the members of multiple member bodies for whom no other method of appointment or selection is provided by charter or ordinance words or ordinance or what is added.

925
01:55:08,172 --> 01:55:15,377
[SPEAKER_18]: In section three six be the words and the city website were added after tell me immediately posted on the city bulletin boards.

926
01:55:17,367 --> 01:55:20,028
[SPEAKER_18]: That's for if the mayor calls a special meeting of the council.

927
01:55:25,990 --> 01:55:42,017
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, section 4-1, we would restore the language that says the school committee shall consist of seven members, two members elected at large by the voters of the city and one each elected from the following districts combined of the combined wards within the city, wards one and seven.

928
01:55:43,948 --> 01:55:52,676
[SPEAKER_18]: words two and three words four and five and word six and eight and then it would restore the language the mayor shall serve as the seventh member of the school committee.

929
01:56:04,246 --> 01:56:06,808
[SPEAKER_18]: It's only 40 pages I promise I will flip quickly.

930
01:56:17,313 --> 01:56:19,899
[SPEAKER_18]: There was some language removed because it was redundant.

931
01:56:19,919 --> 01:56:25,250
[SPEAKER_18]: This is in section 8.2 subsection B.

932
01:56:29,958 --> 01:56:44,194
[SPEAKER_18]: that just removed basically there's a sentence that says that the city solicitor shall advise the city council or school committee in writing as to whether the measure as proposed may lawfully be proposed by the initiative process and whether in its present form it may be lawfully adopted by the city council or school committee.

933
01:56:44,935 --> 01:56:50,822
[SPEAKER_18]: This strikes and whether in its present form it may be lawfully adopted by the city council or school committee because that's redundant to the first sentence.

934
01:56:52,177 --> 01:56:53,998
[SPEAKER_18]: PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

935
01:56:54,018 --> 01:56:54,938
[SPEAKER_18]: PB – Harmon Zuckerman.

936
01:56:54,958 --> 01:56:55,659
[SPEAKER_18]: PB – Harmon Zuckerman.

937
01:57:21,887 --> 01:57:31,595
[SPEAKER_18]: And then in section 9-4, section A, the charter shall be subject to review by a charter review committee as defined below within five years of the charter's approval by the voters and every 10 years thereafter.

938
01:57:31,615 --> 01:57:36,760
[SPEAKER_18]: So that changes it to five within five years instead of within 10 years.

939
01:57:37,200 --> 01:57:38,501
[SPEAKER_18]: And then every 10 years after that.

940
01:57:39,262 --> 01:57:47,830
[SPEAKER_18]: And then B, this review shall be made by a special committee composed of three appointees of the mayor, three appointees of the council and three appointees of the school committee.

941
01:57:48,921 --> 01:57:59,088
[SPEAKER_18]: That reverts to the council's vote from March 11, and reverses the change the mayor made on April 1 which would have had four of the mayor three of the Council to the school committee.

942
01:58:06,253 --> 01:58:08,415
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that's it.

943
01:58:08,955 --> 01:58:11,117
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there anything that folks think I miss.

944
01:58:16,295 --> 01:58:20,156
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, any discussion by members of the council on the draft as amended?

945
01:58:23,737 --> 01:58:24,557
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a motion.

946
01:58:25,037 --> 01:58:27,178
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a motion on that draft?

947
01:58:27,198 --> 01:58:28,198
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have actually a motion yet.

948
01:58:30,399 --> 01:58:41,102
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a motion to approve by Councilor Lazaro, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli on the draft as amended.

949
01:58:45,398 --> 01:58:48,979
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, seeing no further discussion by members of the council, we'll go to discussion by members of the public.

950
01:58:49,079 --> 01:58:51,720
[SPEAKER_18]: Please approach the podium or raise your hand on Zoom.

951
01:58:52,420 --> 01:58:53,881
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, sorry, I see the mayor.

952
01:58:53,941 --> 01:58:56,301
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll go to the mayor and then we will go to public participation.

953
01:58:56,702 --> 01:58:57,202
[SPEAKER_18]: Madam Mayor.

954
01:59:01,703 --> 01:59:02,923
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I had to log off.

955
01:59:03,103 --> 01:59:08,725
[SPEAKER_07]: I was leaving my daughter's lacrosse game, but I, so I missed, I thought you were just talking about the press release.

956
01:59:08,805 --> 01:59:14,327
[SPEAKER_07]: I just missed the discussion on what I emailed

957
01:59:16,708 --> 01:59:18,950
[SPEAKER_07]: today like it was potential on it.

958
01:59:20,052 --> 01:59:20,993
[SPEAKER_18]: Mayor could you.

959
01:59:22,995 --> 01:59:24,857
[SPEAKER_18]: We didn't hear what you said could you just repeat your comment.

960
01:59:25,778 --> 01:59:26,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, can you hear me now.

961
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:29,622
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, you were cutting.

962
01:59:30,202 --> 01:59:33,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay sorry I'm heading home from my daughter's lacrosse game with.

963
01:59:33,406 --> 01:59:36,088
[SPEAKER_07]: She wanted me to be at, while I was listening on the meeting.

964
01:59:37,105 --> 01:59:45,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and I just logged off cause I thought the discussion was over when you were talking about the press release, but it just wanted to check about the email I sent today.

965
01:59:45,589 --> 01:59:48,610
[SPEAKER_07]: It seemed like the red line version for the first time I saw.

966
01:59:48,630 --> 02:00:04,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I don't know if it was just a comment or if you were voting to have, um, appointment power, rejection power of all department heads or the city council was should have appointment and rejection power of all department heads and

967
02:00:06,862 --> 02:00:07,943
[SPEAKER_07]: if that was the case?

968
02:00:09,623 --> 02:00:32,053
[SPEAKER_18]: We had voted, this was in the March 11th draft, and it was in the vote we took last week that section three, three would read the mayor shall appoint subject to the review of such appointments by the city council under section 2.9, all city officers and department heads and members of multiple member bodies for whom whom no other method of appointment or selection is provided by charter or ordinance.

969
02:00:33,411 --> 02:00:40,636
[SPEAKER_18]: So if at the charter or and we added the words or ordinance so if the charter or a city ordinance provided another method of selection.

970
02:00:40,656 --> 02:00:44,979
[SPEAKER_18]: Then that would be who makes the selection.

971
02:00:47,747 --> 02:01:01,391
[SPEAKER_18]: As I was reviewing, I did see a comment that did not get incorporated from the Collins Center in section 2.9, which was, we recommend replacing this text with the following text.

972
02:01:01,671 --> 02:01:16,935
[SPEAKER_18]: So it would read, the mayor shall refer to the city council and simultaneously file with the city clerk the name of each person the mayor desires to appoint as a city officer, department head, or member of the multiple member body for whom no other method of appointment or selection is provided by the charter.

973
02:01:18,613 --> 02:01:27,077
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, so I had added or ordinance because I felt it aligned with the three, three vote that we had taken to add the words or ordinance.

974
02:01:28,678 --> 02:01:43,986
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, as I read it, at least the change to three, three would say that if an ordinance said that someone else appointed either a city officer department head or member of a multiple member body, then the ordinance would define who appointed them, not the mayor.

975
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:52,061
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if that maybe an error, I shouldn't have changed to nine.

976
02:01:52,081 --> 02:02:07,326
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, counselor saying digestible for me that I just wanted to make sure it wasn't mayors in the future would have to run all department head appointments

977
02:02:07,756 --> 02:02:08,796
[SPEAKER_07]: by the council.

978
02:02:08,976 --> 02:02:13,838
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why I sent a compromise today, because I just wasn't sure if that it was red lines that way.

979
02:02:14,598 --> 02:02:15,879
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think I understand what you're saying.

980
02:02:15,919 --> 02:02:16,799
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not part of it.

981
02:02:16,859 --> 02:02:22,801
[SPEAKER_07]: But you did add the words or ordinance to both to both sections, which I have seen in the past.

982
02:02:23,801 --> 02:02:33,585
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I mean, I think that the section three three change would say that if an ordinance said that someone else makes that appointment, whether that's the council or

983
02:02:35,037 --> 02:02:36,257
[SPEAKER_18]: that that would be how that would work.

984
02:02:36,297 --> 02:02:51,102
[SPEAKER_18]: But now that I'm reading two nine, I think it makes sense what you're saying that if the, for whom no other method of appointment or selection is provided by a charter or ordinance, the mayor would have to refer to the city council.

985
02:02:51,822 --> 02:02:57,124
[SPEAKER_18]: So that should probably just say by charter in two nine.

986
02:02:58,604 --> 02:03:01,645
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought they were making self-referential references.

987
02:03:03,609 --> 02:03:10,292
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to be sure, because I don't have an issue with if there's a department head interview that somebody wants to sit in on.

988
02:03:11,032 --> 02:03:13,653
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't, you know, I think the mayor can allow that in the future.

989
02:03:13,673 --> 02:03:31,080
[SPEAKER_07]: I just having every single department head, and because we know what the turnover's like throughout all municipalities, having every single department head come before you and you, the city council having to set up a whole subcommittee to do additional interviews, it could really stall the process.

990
02:03:31,817 --> 02:03:36,019
[SPEAKER_07]: dissuade people from applying to be part of city government.

991
02:03:36,059 --> 02:03:45,643
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to make sure that was not what I saw in the red line version last night.

992
02:03:50,045 --> 02:03:50,745
[SPEAKER_18]: Councillor Seng.

993
02:03:52,306 --> 02:03:53,627
[SPEAKER_17]: I think reading it,

994
02:03:58,127 --> 02:04:03,011
[SPEAKER_17]: I think reading it, the text should still stay in, but we can clarify it.

995
02:04:05,073 --> 02:04:10,978
[SPEAKER_17]: Honestly, I think it not having a comma means that it only applies to the member of the multi-member body.

996
02:04:13,460 --> 02:04:14,401
[SPEAKER_17]: That's my reading of it.

997
02:04:14,781 --> 02:04:20,766
[SPEAKER_17]: We can also just cover our bases by passing a motion that we support that reading of it.

998
02:04:21,947 --> 02:04:23,128
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

999
02:04:24,289 --> 02:04:26,070
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I was reading it was under 3-3.

1000
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:52,216
[SPEAKER_18]: that it says the mayor shall appoint subject to the review of such appointments by the city council under section two dash nine all city officers and department heads and the members of multiple member bodies for whom no other method of appointment or selection is provided by the charter or ordinance so if the charter or an ordinance were to say who should be appointing

1001
02:04:53,525 --> 02:04:59,289
[SPEAKER_18]: a city officer or department head or a multi-member body, then that would be what defines who makes the appointment.

1002
02:05:01,271 --> 02:05:22,927
[SPEAKER_18]: But I'm wondering if separately in section 2.9 where it says, the mayor shall refer to the city council and simultaneously file with the clerk the name of each person the mayor desires to appoint as a city officer, department head, or member of a multi-member body for whom no other method of appointment or selection is provided by charter or ordinance would mean if no ordinance existed, she would have to submit it to us.

1003
02:05:27,747 --> 02:05:37,749
[SPEAKER_18]: So what we don't want is that if there's nothing in the charter or the ordinance, then it doesn't start automatically everyone, but what we do want is that if it is in the charter ordinance it has to be followed.

1004
02:05:38,650 --> 02:05:43,071
[SPEAKER_18]: So I mean leaving or ordinance and three three, removing it from tonight.

1005
02:05:49,632 --> 02:05:50,053
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that any.

1006
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:07,474
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, move forward with this, we move forward with the vote but this issue was defined with you and the mayor and clarify I don't think it's a big issue I think just, you know,

1007
02:06:16,975 --> 02:06:21,639
[SPEAKER_15]: clerical, maybe some punctuation or whatnot could just be handled between you and the mayor.

1008
02:06:21,679 --> 02:06:25,002
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to confirm my understanding with all of us here.

1009
02:06:25,202 --> 02:06:32,468
[SPEAKER_18]: What we're voting on is that if the charter or the ordinance says that there's an appointment, that's what follows.

1010
02:06:32,748 --> 02:06:37,972
[SPEAKER_18]: But that if there's nothing in the charter or ordinance, then we do not have to appoint.

1011
02:06:38,513 --> 02:06:38,873
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree.

1012
02:06:39,293 --> 02:06:44,598
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that talking with just to make sure that I don't want to go in that room later and say, oh, that's not what

1013
02:06:45,049 --> 02:06:46,689
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so that's what we're.

1014
02:06:46,750 --> 02:06:48,930
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so that's what we're doing, counselor.

1015
02:06:50,671 --> 02:06:52,811
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to check my understanding of what you just paraphrased.

1016
02:06:54,652 --> 02:07:00,433
[SPEAKER_03]: If a method for appointing a city officer department head or member of a multi member body.

1017
02:07:01,534 --> 02:07:05,435
[SPEAKER_03]: The process for that if it is prescribed in the city charter or an ordinance, we just do that.

1018
02:07:05,595 --> 02:07:12,757
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's not spoken to in the city charter or in any ordinance, then the process described in section two dash nine applies.

1019
02:07:16,183 --> 02:07:16,403
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1020
02:07:16,743 --> 02:07:17,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1021
02:07:17,223 --> 02:07:18,004
[SPEAKER_03]: That is my understanding.

1022
02:07:18,244 --> 02:07:18,364
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1023
02:07:18,444 --> 02:07:18,724
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1024
02:07:19,804 --> 02:07:19,904
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1025
02:07:19,924 --> 02:07:20,204
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1026
02:07:20,985 --> 02:07:23,265
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll work out this, make sure we get the thing right.

1027
02:07:23,285 --> 02:07:27,127
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we actually have exactly what it needs to say right now, but we'll confirm that.

1028
02:07:28,387 --> 02:07:43,272
[SPEAKER_18]: So the motion as further amended is that the council leadership will work on, we'll just confirm the language as discussed and the intent, confirm the intent of the council.

1029
02:07:50,021 --> 02:07:54,883
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I just can take one more moment before I hop off, I just want to thank the council.

1030
02:07:54,963 --> 02:07:56,664
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like it's moving in the right direction.

1031
02:07:56,684 --> 02:08:00,365
[SPEAKER_07]: And I, I just really appreciate the collaboration.

1032
02:08:00,405 --> 02:08:03,086
[SPEAKER_07]: This was probably the toughest thing we've, we've worked on.

1033
02:08:03,126 --> 02:08:08,489
[SPEAKER_07]: It took several months and years in the making, and I just think it's monumental and it's going to be just.

1034
02:08:09,209 --> 02:08:16,712
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you very much, everybody, whether we disagreed on many issues or not at all, I, it was,

1035
02:08:19,232 --> 02:08:19,953
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you so much.

1036
02:08:20,333 --> 02:08:25,095
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you to the committee, the study committee and the residents who got involved in the public meetings.

1037
02:08:25,415 --> 02:08:26,236
[SPEAKER_07]: This was a team effort.

1038
02:08:27,936 --> 02:08:28,457
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1039
02:08:28,777 --> 02:08:32,559
[SPEAKER_18]: And we will have a press release for you and Steve for tomorrow to go out from us.

1040
02:08:32,939 --> 02:08:34,540
[SPEAKER_18]: So look forward to it.

1041
02:08:36,581 --> 02:08:38,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you just want that from the council?

1042
02:08:39,302 --> 02:08:45,465
[SPEAKER_18]: We'd like it to go out as a press just to the same places where the last press release about this issue went out, if you don't mind.

1043
02:08:52,925 --> 02:08:53,245
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1044
02:08:55,387 --> 02:09:00,630
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a motion, as amended, just to confirm that in section 29 and 33.

1045
02:09:01,050 --> 02:09:09,015
[SPEAKER_18]: And we'll get that to the mayor motion by Councils are seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1046
02:09:09,676 --> 02:09:11,157
[SPEAKER_18]: Now we'll go to public comment and you can please

1047
02:09:14,325 --> 02:09:17,467
[SPEAKER_18]: No, Lazarus Scarpelli.

1048
02:09:18,968 --> 02:09:20,909
[SPEAKER_18]: And so we will go to public comment.

1049
02:09:20,929 --> 02:09:25,131
[SPEAKER_18]: If you'd like to comment at the podium, please come to the podium or on Zoom.

1050
02:09:25,371 --> 02:09:27,952
[SPEAKER_18]: And Phyllis, you have had your hand raised, so we will go to you first.

1051
02:09:29,033 --> 02:09:30,414
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record, please.

1052
02:09:37,797 --> 02:09:38,698
[SPEAKER_18]: And Phyllis, you have the floor.

1053
02:09:39,342 --> 02:09:40,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, my name is Phyllis Morrison.

1054
02:09:41,003 --> 02:09:44,186
[SPEAKER_02]: My address is 32 Andrew Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

1055
02:09:46,928 --> 02:09:48,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I raised my hand quite a while back.

1056
02:09:49,289 --> 02:09:57,836
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to say that a lot of what I might have said has been brought up and to some great extent clarified and we've moved on.

1057
02:09:58,645 --> 02:10:02,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I do feel very strongly that I have to make the following comments.

1058
02:10:02,826 --> 02:10:25,574
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my first thoughts when the conflict about the struggle between the balance of power and the mayor and this committee, I made myself clear last meeting that I thought the power struggle was getting in the way of actually what was best for the residents of Medford.

1059
02:10:26,409 --> 02:10:32,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very happy to have been part of this conversation tonight, although I was mostly listening, which is my role.

1060
02:10:35,133 --> 02:10:41,696
[SPEAKER_02]: To see that compromise was made, I disagree that the mayor should not chair the school committee.

1061
02:10:41,956 --> 02:10:49,260
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an educator, and I think that one of our best investments as a city always is our young people.

1062
02:10:49,740 --> 02:10:55,483
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that the mayor should have full knowledge, full participation in that,

1063
02:10:55,967 --> 02:11:03,689
[SPEAKER_02]: And as some of the council persons have brought up, she has other things to do, but I think that that role in the school committee is vital.

1064
02:11:04,289 --> 02:11:07,170
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm happy with the compromise that she be a voting member.

1065
02:11:07,991 --> 02:11:11,712
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to address a couple of comments that were brought forth.

1066
02:11:12,232 --> 02:11:18,334
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, to say that this isn't political is really an untrue statement.

1067
02:11:18,434 --> 02:11:19,494
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a political body.

1068
02:11:20,207 --> 02:11:25,189
[SPEAKER_02]: We could get into the differences of parties in that, but this is a political arena.

1069
02:11:26,510 --> 02:11:32,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to address specifically the same thing that I addressed at the last meeting.

1070
02:11:33,082 --> 02:11:38,823
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I became a member of the Charter Study because I was concerned about the city of Medford.

1071
02:11:39,763 --> 02:11:45,385
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only been a resident here since 1997, but I really am invested in this community.

1072
02:11:46,145 --> 02:11:50,846
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never had a child go to school in this community, but I value education.

1073
02:11:50,906 --> 02:11:52,306
[SPEAKER_02]: I want the best for our children.

1074
02:11:53,006 --> 02:11:54,426
[SPEAKER_02]: I want the best for our city.

1075
02:11:55,667 --> 02:12:02,088
[SPEAKER_02]: To hear comments about there was not enough representation on the Charter Study Committee

1076
02:12:02,822 --> 02:12:04,843
[SPEAKER_02]: is very upsetting to me.

1077
02:12:06,424 --> 02:12:08,305
[SPEAKER_02]: We encourage people to join us.

1078
02:12:08,605 --> 02:12:12,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to apply to be a member of the Charter Study Committee.

1079
02:12:13,087 --> 02:12:15,048
[SPEAKER_02]: This was not a hand-select group.

1080
02:12:15,588 --> 02:12:31,796
[SPEAKER_02]: And might I add that we spent hours, and many of the other Charter Study members more than myself, interviewing people, setting up opportunities for people to speak, offering opportunities to have people have input,

1081
02:12:32,380 --> 02:12:33,001
[SPEAKER_02]: all around.

1082
02:12:33,461 --> 02:12:42,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't tell you the work that this committee has done, but people are only going to do what they want.

1083
02:12:42,349 --> 02:12:45,813
[SPEAKER_02]: We couldn't beg people to come in to be on the charter study.

1084
02:12:46,573 --> 02:12:56,503
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea that there was some sort of select or select kind of committee that was on this charter study is really a fallacy and the public needs to know that.

1085
02:12:57,922 --> 02:13:12,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that anyone who had applied to be on this study and that brought a certain anything with them and a great interest and an attitude to invest in this city's growth and greatness, they would have been a welcomed member of that committee.

1086
02:13:12,869 --> 02:13:22,893
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanna clear the record on that because this is now three meetings in a row that I have heard from several members of the council

1087
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:27,043
[SPEAKER_02]: that they thought there was some kind of selection process there.

1088
02:13:27,463 --> 02:13:38,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know any other group who decided to put in hundreds and hundreds of hours on their own time to help bring this charter to the table.

1089
02:13:40,073 --> 02:13:44,296
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the other things I wanted to say have been worked through.

1090
02:13:44,877 --> 02:13:46,178
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do want to say this.

1091
02:13:47,179 --> 02:13:52,603
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my great pleasure to hear the great collaboration and compromise being made.

1092
02:13:53,432 --> 02:13:58,414
[SPEAKER_02]: for the good of the city of Medford, for all 60,000 residents.

1093
02:13:58,814 --> 02:14:11,239
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one thing I'd like to remind the council is this, whatever happens with this vote this evening, I heard a lot of people say, I, or I heard from people, or I, I this and that, we all have opinions.

1094
02:14:12,199 --> 02:14:14,820
[SPEAKER_02]: We all have a different understanding of what's best for.

1095
02:14:16,213 --> 02:14:26,397
[SPEAKER_02]: But your job is to vote on this and then let the residents of this city say, yes, we agree with this charter or we don't.

1096
02:14:27,037 --> 02:14:29,117
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't rely on two or three people.

1097
02:14:29,458 --> 02:14:31,598
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't rely on one group or another group.

1098
02:14:32,179 --> 02:14:44,883
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that has to now, if it's passed, and I am hopeful that it will pass, this goes to our public and they get to decide, is this the best way for our city to move forward by this charter?

1099
02:14:45,399 --> 02:14:46,199
[SPEAKER_02]: or if it isn't.

1100
02:14:46,879 --> 02:14:53,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to end by saying I have sincere gratitude and thanks for everyone involved in all of this.

1101
02:14:53,621 --> 02:14:55,162
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope for the best for our city.

1102
02:14:55,722 --> 02:14:56,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1103
02:14:57,882 --> 02:14:58,523
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Phyllis.

1104
02:14:58,623 --> 02:14:59,663
[SPEAKER_18]: And thanks for waiting.

1105
02:14:59,723 --> 02:15:09,626
[SPEAKER_18]: And, um, members of the study committee who want to say anything, I just want to say, and I, you know, I appreciate you directing your comments generally to the chair.

1106
02:15:09,646 --> 02:15:13,767
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, but I did say some things about, um,

1107
02:15:15,248 --> 02:15:37,664
[SPEAKER_18]: about politics and my point being that the mayor tonight said that, and the process for appointing the study committee was that people applied and then the mayor and her office made a decision on who would serve on the committee, that the mayor said that her goal was to have a politically diverse representation.

1108
02:15:37,704 --> 02:15:41,087
[SPEAKER_18]: So essentially to appoint people based on their political beliefs.

1109
02:15:42,190 --> 02:15:49,698
[SPEAKER_18]: and that the council didn't like the Charter Study Committee because we didn't like the political beliefs of the Charter Study Committee or some of the members.

1110
02:15:50,479 --> 02:16:04,514
[SPEAKER_18]: And my point that I was trying to make was that no one on this floor in a public meeting certainly that I ever heard said the Charter Study Committee's members and their politics is why we disagree with the Charter Study Committee.

1111
02:16:05,173 --> 02:16:07,574
[SPEAKER_18]: So I appreciate your comment.

1112
02:16:08,114 --> 02:16:10,836
[SPEAKER_18]: And I appreciate that, you know, it can be frustrating to hear that.

1113
02:16:11,616 --> 02:16:13,697
[SPEAKER_18]: I was frustrated to hear it when the mayor said it.

1114
02:16:14,037 --> 02:16:23,742
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's why I said, we, no one here in this forum has said, I don't like the study committee because I don't like the politics of some members of the study committee.

1115
02:16:24,942 --> 02:16:29,565
[SPEAKER_18]: Or I don't like the study committee because I don't like this person on the study committee.

1116
02:16:30,545 --> 02:16:32,006
[SPEAKER_18]: And I took that even to the point of saying,

1117
02:16:32,940 --> 02:16:40,866
[SPEAKER_18]: someone who said some very horrible things about me, I have never once said, I'm disagreeing or I'm voting this way because that person served on that committee.

1118
02:16:43,407 --> 02:16:47,090
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to go to Jean Zotter, another member of the study committee.

1119
02:16:47,110 --> 02:16:49,352
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record, Jean.

1120
02:16:50,012 --> 02:16:50,913
[SPEAKER_18]: And you'll have three minutes.

1121
02:16:53,455 --> 02:16:53,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

1122
02:16:54,015 --> 02:16:55,436
[SPEAKER_18]: Two more since you're on the study committee.

1123
02:16:56,300 --> 02:17:00,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1124
02:17:00,943 --> 02:17:02,824
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a member of the Charter Study Committee.

1125
02:17:02,924 --> 02:17:08,748
[SPEAKER_00]: My opinions are reflecting just my own opinions, not that of the Charter Study Committee.

1126
02:17:09,249 --> 02:17:15,813
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I just want to recognize how excited I am that it seems like we're close to having a charter.

1127
02:17:19,006 --> 02:17:23,807
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanna thank the city council and the mayor for coming together on some compromise.

1128
02:17:23,827 --> 02:17:31,149
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a thoughtful deliberation process and I really appreciate the time that you put into this.

1129
02:17:32,169 --> 02:17:35,570
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanna thank my charter study committee members also.

1130
02:17:35,590 --> 02:17:39,971
[SPEAKER_00]: On the charter study committee, I didn't get everything I wanted.

1131
02:17:39,991 --> 02:17:43,572
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anyone did and compromise is not easy.

1132
02:17:44,212 --> 02:17:50,796
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we've set up a process so we can have regular review and improve the charter going forward.

1133
02:17:50,976 --> 02:17:55,479
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanna clap my hands and thank everybody for this.

1134
02:17:55,599 --> 02:17:59,862
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope it passes and thanks for all your work on this.

1135
02:17:59,922 --> 02:18:00,722
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.

1136
02:18:03,144 --> 02:18:03,784
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Jean.

1137
02:18:06,206 --> 02:18:09,868
[SPEAKER_18]: Any further comments by members of the public either in person or on Zoom?

1138
02:18:18,590 --> 02:18:19,671
[SPEAKER_18]: PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

1139
02:18:19,711 --> 02:18:20,452
[SPEAKER_18]: PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

1140
02:18:20,472 --> 02:18:20,912
[SPEAKER_18]: PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

1141
02:18:20,932 --> 02:18:21,593
[SPEAKER_18]: PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

1142
02:18:21,613 --> 02:18:24,015
[SPEAKER_18]: PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

1143
02:18:24,035 --> 02:18:25,776
[SPEAKER_18]: PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

1144
02:18:25,796 --> 02:18:26,176
[SPEAKER_18]: PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

1145
02:18:48,379 --> 02:18:48,919
[SPEAKER_18]: Just a minute.

1146
02:18:48,939 --> 02:18:53,621
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, you should be able to start your video.

1147
02:18:57,923 --> 02:18:58,223
[SPEAKER_18]: Go ahead.

1148
02:18:58,703 --> 02:19:01,984
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, Ellen Epstein, 15 Grove Street.

1149
02:19:03,425 --> 02:19:05,906
[SPEAKER_20]: I have a comment and then a question.

1150
02:19:05,926 --> 02:19:14,609
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to support what Councilor Collins expressed a little ways before because

1151
02:19:16,110 --> 02:19:31,163
[SPEAKER_20]: I think this city council is extraordinarily responsive and thoughtful, and I'm always glad to hear what each individual councillor feels and thinks about any issue that comes before the council.

1152
02:19:32,104 --> 02:19:41,172
[SPEAKER_20]: But my hackles do go up when I hear a councillor saying that this council is not listening to the public.

1153
02:19:42,298 --> 02:19:48,059
[SPEAKER_20]: because I feel very listened to, extremely listened to by this particular city council.

1154
02:19:48,739 --> 02:19:54,921
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just want to confirm what Councillor Collins said.

1155
02:19:54,941 --> 02:20:07,743
[SPEAKER_20]: I think there's many of us who feel misrepresented when a councillor states that the public feels that they are not being listened to because I don't feel part of that particular public.

1156
02:20:09,964 --> 02:20:11,044
[SPEAKER_20]: A question I have,

1157
02:20:12,797 --> 02:20:25,967
[SPEAKER_20]: If this version, this compromise version of the charter does not pass unanimously tonight, what happens next?

1158
02:20:26,588 --> 02:20:36,856
[SPEAKER_20]: Because my understanding is that if we make the deadline of the state house, which I know is also in question, no matter what the vote is tonight,

1159
02:20:38,157 --> 02:20:46,539
[SPEAKER_20]: If the vote is not unanimous, or at least six to one, they may deny our home rule petition anyway.

1160
02:20:47,399 --> 02:20:56,381
[SPEAKER_20]: And if that happens, do we get another chance at this next year, or where are we left if that happens?

1161
02:20:57,562 --> 02:20:58,002
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1162
02:20:59,522 --> 02:20:59,922
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Ellen.

1163
02:20:59,942 --> 02:21:02,223
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you have anything else you want to add before I answer your question?

1164
02:21:02,243 --> 02:21:03,483
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1165
02:21:04,103 --> 02:21:07,144
[SPEAKER_18]: So the answer is that, and I hope

1166
02:21:07,929 --> 02:21:12,475
[SPEAKER_18]: My colleagues will in the legislature will take this with all due respect the legislature is a great black box.

1167
02:21:13,297 --> 02:21:14,498
[SPEAKER_18]: And there actually is no deadline.

1168
02:21:14,518 --> 02:21:18,183
[SPEAKER_18]: And there actually is no threshold for how the vote needs to be.

1169
02:21:19,866 --> 02:21:23,871
[SPEAKER_18]: All we know is what the legislature tends to do, and what they're kind of.

1170
02:21:25,488 --> 02:21:38,393
[SPEAKER_18]: informal practice is the legislature is starting their budget season, essentially next week so the idea is if you get it in before budget season you'll have a better chance of getting it passed before budget season ends.

1171
02:21:39,473 --> 02:21:44,495
[SPEAKER_18]: The budget should be passed by June 30 but usually goes into July, and then they take a summer break.

1172
02:21:44,955 --> 02:21:48,657
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's all based on kind of the informal workings of the legislature.

1173
02:21:49,812 --> 02:22:01,239
[SPEAKER_18]: Additionally, technically by the law, a four to three vote of the legislative body and the approval of the mayor is legally sufficient for the legislature to advance a home rule petition.

1174
02:22:02,360 --> 02:22:11,925
[SPEAKER_18]: Technically the legislature could pass a law applying to the city, I believe even without the council's assent, they are under the state constitution, essentially all powerful.

1175
02:22:14,046 --> 02:22:17,929
[SPEAKER_18]: But the best practice is that you want a super majority

1176
02:22:18,959 --> 02:22:21,261
[SPEAKER_18]: between a super majority and near unanimity.

1177
02:22:21,501 --> 02:22:26,546
[SPEAKER_18]: So that would be here a five to two, a six to one or a seven to zero vote.

1178
02:22:27,947 --> 02:22:31,810
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, and the higher that is the better chance you get.

1179
02:22:31,870 --> 02:22:35,613
[SPEAKER_18]: But again, that's not a rule or anything that is established by law.

1180
02:22:35,673 --> 02:22:38,316
[SPEAKER_18]: That is kind of an informal practice of the legislature.

1181
02:22:39,317 --> 02:22:44,681
[SPEAKER_18]: So the goal is always to get it in as early as you can and with as many votes as you can, but

1182
02:22:47,505 --> 02:22:52,526
[SPEAKER_18]: Beyond that, there's nothing in the law or the rules of the legislature that defines either of those.

1183
02:22:52,646 --> 02:22:58,448
[SPEAKER_18]: They could, if we voted at four, three, they could take it up in their next session and pass it the next day and we could be done with it.

1184
02:22:58,568 --> 02:23:05,710
[SPEAKER_18]: But it really just is about the leadership setting the calendar in both chambers and what they're comfortable with.

1185
02:23:07,951 --> 02:23:13,172
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd refer you to a lot of the public discussion about transparency in the legislature to talk more about that.

1186
02:23:17,101 --> 02:23:21,003
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to go to Eileen Lerner on Zoom since we don't have anyone in the chamber.

1187
02:23:21,063 --> 02:23:23,865
[SPEAKER_18]: Eileen, name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.

1188
02:23:26,026 --> 02:23:30,828
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Eileen Lerner, and I live at 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1189
02:23:31,729 --> 02:23:43,515
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just want to say that I agree with a previous respondent on Zoom that this meeting has been great to be a witness to.

1190
02:23:45,737 --> 02:23:50,258
[SPEAKER_14]: I really support the work of the council.

1191
02:23:50,898 --> 02:23:52,598
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm very impressed.

1192
02:23:53,558 --> 02:24:05,980
[SPEAKER_14]: I, too, like Ellen, feel this council has done due diligence, has listened to everybody, and I'm just very happy to be represented by them.

1193
02:24:06,721 --> 02:24:07,221
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1194
02:24:09,521 --> 02:24:10,121
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1195
02:24:10,141 --> 02:24:14,442
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll go to Munir Jimenez.

1196
02:24:15,802 --> 02:24:17,884
[SPEAKER_18]: name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.

1197
02:24:21,688 --> 02:24:28,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Dear Dermanis, Summit Road in Medford, and I'll be very brief.

1198
02:24:29,658 --> 02:24:42,621
[SPEAKER_01]: I also listened to most of the discussions of the city council of this process, and I'm very appreciative of the thoughtfulness and thoroughness in discussing this.

1199
02:24:43,682 --> 02:24:52,464
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am fully supportive of their efforts, and I'm happy to go with whatever recommendation they actually vote on tonight.

1200
02:24:53,384 --> 02:24:53,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

1201
02:24:55,965 --> 02:24:56,385
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1202
02:24:59,788 --> 02:25:01,309
[SPEAKER_18]: Any further comment by members of the public?

1203
02:25:02,129 --> 02:25:02,970
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Andrea Tola.

1204
02:25:04,171 --> 02:25:06,832
[SPEAKER_18]: Come on down, we're gonna get you in front of the microphone.

1205
02:25:19,940 --> 02:25:20,701
[SPEAKER_19]: You have the floor.

1206
02:25:21,021 --> 02:25:21,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, good evening.

1207
02:25:22,562 --> 02:25:27,105
[SPEAKER_12]: Anthony Andrea Tola, 75 Lawrence Road, Method Mass, class of Method High 1978.

1208
02:25:29,822 --> 02:25:36,229
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't usually come to city council meetings and I haven't been at this podium since 1977.

1209
02:25:36,789 --> 02:25:40,393
[SPEAKER_12]: So probably before you guys were all born.

1210
02:25:40,694 --> 02:25:41,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome back.

1211
02:25:41,574 --> 02:25:43,597
[SPEAKER_12]: George was around, George was around.

1212
02:25:46,700 --> 02:25:51,725
[SPEAKER_12]: But I like to thank all of you, all seven of you for considering

1213
02:25:52,908 --> 02:25:57,475
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, the recommendations of the Charter Committee and giving it such careful consideration.

1214
02:25:58,256 --> 02:26:00,219
[SPEAKER_12]: I know it's been a difficult process.

1215
02:26:00,560 --> 02:26:01,962
[SPEAKER_12]: It was very difficult for me.

1216
02:26:01,982 --> 02:26:07,070
[SPEAKER_12]: And I also wanted to thank Mayor Brianna for appointing me to the committee.

1217
02:26:07,591 --> 02:26:15,597
[SPEAKER_12]: And just so you know, in five years, I'm not available.

1218
02:26:16,697 --> 02:26:18,939
[SPEAKER_12]: You all have a chance to make history tonight.

1219
02:26:19,299 --> 02:26:24,002
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been over 30 years since we've had a charter change in the city.

1220
02:26:24,523 --> 02:26:26,004
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's been a tough 30 years.

1221
02:26:26,924 --> 02:26:27,585
[SPEAKER_12]: I think, you know,

1222
02:26:28,942 --> 02:26:35,604
[SPEAKER_12]: You hear a lot about the city council, that it's dysfunctional, it's controlled by one group or another.

1223
02:26:35,684 --> 02:26:38,145
[SPEAKER_12]: And just for the record, I'm politically homeless.

1224
02:26:38,565 --> 02:26:46,928
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not a member of the revolution or Medford, the, you know, Mona Lisa's, Manhattan's, whatever we have here in Medford now.

1225
02:26:48,049 --> 02:26:52,070
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, I think everybody wants the best for the city.

1226
02:26:52,390 --> 02:26:57,332
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think people run for office and, you know, you're not making the big bucks.

1227
02:26:58,158 --> 02:27:01,021
[SPEAKER_12]: And I commend you all for being here.

1228
02:27:01,141 --> 02:27:03,102
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's been 30 years.

1229
02:27:03,122 --> 02:27:09,688
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think had this process happened 20 years ago, our city would be in a better place right now.

1230
02:27:10,548 --> 02:27:13,331
[SPEAKER_12]: So I know it's been hard.

1231
02:27:13,731 --> 02:27:20,196
[SPEAKER_12]: I know I myself have not gotten many of the things I wanted to see in the charter.

1232
02:27:21,673 --> 02:27:32,317
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, in five years, you know, a new group, maybe some new city councils will have an opportunity to make changes, to improve our city.

1233
02:27:33,017 --> 02:27:43,900
[SPEAKER_12]: Tonight is like our opportunity to move forward and to, you know, let the new charter kind of shape where we go.

1234
02:27:44,481 --> 02:27:45,921
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's all about the kids.

1235
02:27:46,521 --> 02:27:49,122
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's all about the future.

1236
02:27:49,162 --> 02:27:50,643
[SPEAKER_12]: It's for the young people.

1237
02:27:51,863 --> 02:28:00,987
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, charter change isn't gonna really make a difference much in my life, I hope not anyway, but it may for, you know, the kids in the schools in the future.

1238
02:28:01,648 --> 02:28:04,329
[SPEAKER_12]: And you are all a part of that.

1239
02:28:04,789 --> 02:28:17,495
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I think, you know, we want a great charter, but, you know, we have to take what is available to us tonight and work with it and make it work.

1240
02:28:18,356 --> 02:28:20,717
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just wanna thank you all for,

1241
02:28:21,498 --> 02:28:34,102
[SPEAKER_12]: considering the charter that was presented to you and it needed a few tweaks and thank you for making them, good night.

1242
02:28:34,622 --> 02:28:35,843
[SPEAKER_18]: Good night, thank you very much.

1243
02:28:38,104 --> 02:28:43,085
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, we have one more comment on Zoom and if there's no one else in the chamber, I'm not seeing anybody.

1244
02:28:43,105 --> 02:28:50,768
[SPEAKER_18]: Go to Mr. Castanetti on Zoom, name and address for the record, you have three minutes.

1245
02:29:02,166 --> 02:29:02,766
[SPEAKER_19]: Andy, are you there?

1246
02:29:07,429 --> 02:29:08,630
[SPEAKER_18]: Andy, I'm asking you to unmute.

1247
02:29:11,952 --> 02:29:12,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1248
02:29:12,332 --> 02:29:12,872
[SPEAKER_18]: There you go.

1249
02:29:13,212 --> 02:29:13,633
[SPEAKER_18]: We can hear you.

1250
02:29:13,653 --> 02:29:14,533
[SPEAKER_18]: You got three minutes.

1251
02:29:15,213 --> 02:29:16,694
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Beers.

1252
02:29:16,734 --> 02:29:23,978
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank all the parties involved because this was quite a task and it was a lot of work, I'm sure.

1253
02:29:24,599 --> 02:29:26,400
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm glad to come to an agreement.

1254
02:29:27,120 --> 02:29:29,161
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish you luck in the election in November.

1255
02:29:31,054 --> 02:29:33,856
[SPEAKER_13]: When was the last time we had a charter change?

1256
02:29:33,977 --> 02:29:37,079
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you know?

1257
02:29:37,099 --> 02:29:43,945
[SPEAKER_18]: 1986 election was I think the, and then I went into effect for the 1987 municipal.

1258
02:29:45,046 --> 02:29:46,968
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's been more than 30 years, right?

1259
02:29:48,469 --> 02:29:49,109
[SPEAKER_18]: We're coming on 30, 38.

1260
02:29:49,570 --> 02:29:51,972
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1261
02:29:52,412 --> 02:29:58,858
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's when Michael McGlynn decided to run for mayor with a strong mayor and

1262
02:30:00,136 --> 02:30:01,498
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been quite a long time.

1263
02:30:02,159 --> 02:30:03,301
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish us all luck.

1264
02:30:03,781 --> 02:30:04,562
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

1265
02:30:05,804 --> 02:30:06,225
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1266
02:30:06,245 --> 02:30:15,939
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, I'll go to Councilor Lemming.

1267
02:30:16,917 --> 02:30:33,362
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to point out for those interested in the learning about the history of the last charter review the Charter Study Committee provided some wonderful newspaper clippings in their in their website which has

1268
02:30:35,618 --> 02:30:47,865
[SPEAKER_16]: just some descriptions of the last effort to have a Charter Review Commission, I believe in the 70s, and other newspaper articles from 86 that talk about the chart that passed.

1269
02:30:47,905 --> 02:30:53,168
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you want to read about a little bit of history, it's on the website.

1270
02:30:53,188 --> 02:30:54,789
[SPEAKER_16]: I did appreciate that in their notes.

1271
02:30:56,170 --> 02:30:59,232
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want to take credit for anything, so Milva, correct me right away.

1272
02:30:59,901 --> 02:31:07,384
[SPEAKER_18]: But you may have, I went to the library, got three, four years ago now, and I pulled the mercury on microfilm.

1273
02:31:07,404 --> 02:31:09,425
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think I printed those out and emailed them to Milva.

1274
02:31:10,266 --> 02:31:16,829
[SPEAKER_18]: Probably there were many others that were used, but don't let it be said that I didn't realize I was in the report or may have been.

1275
02:31:17,589 --> 02:31:23,532
[SPEAKER_18]: But yeah, no, it's, oh, Milva might be correcting me right now.

1276
02:31:29,148 --> 02:31:31,850
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not correcting you.

1277
02:31:32,090 --> 02:31:34,652
[SPEAKER_08]: You get credit for digging up those newspaper articles.

1278
02:31:34,772 --> 02:31:35,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1279
02:31:35,653 --> 02:31:38,475
[SPEAKER_08]: I just was able to disseminate them.

1280
02:31:39,055 --> 02:31:45,820
[SPEAKER_08]: But I believe also on the website is the legislative package from 1986, which I collected from the Mass Archives.

1281
02:31:46,101 --> 02:31:48,643
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's another piece of information that people can look at.

1282
02:31:49,748 --> 02:31:59,830
[SPEAKER_09]: and also the report from the 1978 Charter Study Commission in Medford, which created a whole charter that actually didn't make it.

1283
02:32:00,451 --> 02:32:08,733
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a lot of charter history available on the Charter Study Committee website under resources, if anybody's interested.

1284
02:32:09,213 --> 02:32:10,073
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all, thanks.

1285
02:32:10,433 --> 02:32:11,093
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you all.

1286
02:32:12,394 --> 02:32:15,034
[SPEAKER_09]: And sorry, Milva McDonald, 61 Monument Street.

1287
02:32:16,114 --> 02:32:16,515
Thank you.

1288
02:32:17,195 --> 02:32:17,875
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

1289
02:32:19,821 --> 02:32:20,661
[SPEAKER_17]: Councillor Sang.

1290
02:32:22,923 --> 02:32:23,323
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1291
02:32:23,343 --> 02:32:27,425
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think the historic nature of this vote should be lost upon anyone.

1292
02:32:29,126 --> 02:32:31,207
[SPEAKER_17]: We just, you know, talked a lot about history.

1293
02:32:31,227 --> 02:32:39,271
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this is a really prime example of what we can do as a city when we come together.

1294
02:32:41,492 --> 02:32:45,894
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I think the roads, I think the road was a little bit rockier than I would have liked it.

1295
02:32:47,555 --> 02:32:48,115
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think

1296
02:32:49,253 --> 02:32:54,937
[SPEAKER_17]: in the grand scheme of things, this inches us towards the right place for Medford to be.

1297
02:32:55,457 --> 02:33:00,300
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, I haven't been shy to say that I think there's a lot more to do.

1298
02:33:00,320 --> 02:33:02,242
[SPEAKER_17]: I always think there's a lot more to do.

1299
02:33:04,523 --> 02:33:09,646
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to thank the rich conversation that we've had on the City Council.

1300
02:33:10,287 --> 02:33:13,049
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that in scrutinizing anything,

1301
02:33:14,047 --> 02:33:16,108
[SPEAKER_17]: this was the outcome I wanted.

1302
02:33:16,508 --> 02:33:19,650
[SPEAKER_17]: Even if the vote is the vote, the product is the product.

1303
02:33:20,871 --> 02:33:30,996
[SPEAKER_17]: What I think is really important is that we have a deep conversation into the policies that we're talking about, particularly when it comes to our foundational document.

1304
02:33:33,138 --> 02:33:40,962
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanna thank the people who did elect us and gave us this opportunity to be a part of this process as well.

1305
02:33:42,553 --> 02:33:44,975
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a privilege to be a city councillor.

1306
02:33:45,355 --> 02:33:50,397
[SPEAKER_17]: It's even more a privilege to be a city councillor during such a big change for a city.

1307
02:33:52,338 --> 02:34:03,863
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, I hope, I know that, you know, most people have something they're not happy about in this charter, but that is part of compromise.

1308
02:34:04,143 --> 02:34:05,404
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, I think that

1309
02:34:06,635 --> 02:34:12,019
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a qualm with completely accepting that this is, by definition, a compromise.

1310
02:34:12,139 --> 02:34:21,385
[SPEAKER_17]: I think there are worlds in which we could have reached better deals, but I think this is one that, as the gentleman in the audience said, we can make work.

1311
02:34:23,806 --> 02:34:29,050
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the nature of the rich, deep conversations that we've had about

1312
02:34:30,122 --> 02:34:41,437
[SPEAKER_17]: the policies about academic studies, about feedback from community members, from elected officials in other cities, looking at how the system works in practice.

1313
02:34:42,638 --> 02:34:45,021
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it speaks to the fact that we have been listening.

1314
02:34:46,063 --> 02:34:48,165
[SPEAKER_17]: The fact that we disagreed on key votes.

1315
02:34:49,133 --> 02:34:56,714
[SPEAKER_17]: repeatedly throughout the process, I think also underscores the fact that we've been listening, we've been differing, and we've been coming back together.

1316
02:34:56,734 --> 02:35:00,975
[SPEAKER_17]: I do want to thank the Charter Study Committee for their work.

1317
02:35:02,095 --> 02:35:09,997
[SPEAKER_17]: I want them to know that my criticism of the process is more about the, is about the process writ large.

1318
02:35:11,397 --> 02:35:15,658
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that folks really did dedicate a lot of time to put

1319
02:35:17,219 --> 02:35:19,221
[SPEAKER_17]: to put together a product for us to consider.

1320
02:35:20,461 --> 02:35:28,267
[SPEAKER_17]: And I believe strongly that the city council has a role to play, not just ethically, but also statutorily.

1321
02:35:28,527 --> 02:35:31,269
[SPEAKER_17]: So when it comes to the law, we have a legal part of this.

1322
02:35:31,449 --> 02:35:33,811
[SPEAKER_17]: We are a legal part of this process.

1323
02:35:34,251 --> 02:35:36,193
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's where all that scrutiny comes in.

1324
02:35:37,433 --> 02:35:38,514
[SPEAKER_17]: That's us doing our job.

1325
02:35:39,175 --> 02:35:42,277
[SPEAKER_17]: It's us doing the job that we were paid to do.

1326
02:35:43,335 --> 02:35:53,041
[SPEAKER_17]: It's us not just rubber stamping anything, but really considering every single piece of the charter, which we did line by line, section by section.

1327
02:35:55,422 --> 02:36:06,868
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's important to note that the bulk of this charter was agreed on by all parties at play, agreed on by the Charter Study Committee, by the mayor and the city council.

1328
02:36:06,928 --> 02:36:08,389
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that's noteworthy.

1329
02:36:10,903 --> 02:36:15,267
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I'll just finish my thoughts with a note for the future.

1330
02:36:16,648 --> 02:36:25,935
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm hopeful for a future in which we feel less boxed in to options when we revisit this charter.

1331
02:36:26,175 --> 02:36:39,106
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm hopeful for a future where the state house gives us more ability for us to respond to our residents, to hear their innovative ideas about how government can work in Medford to tailor

1332
02:36:39,908 --> 02:36:44,850
[SPEAKER_17]: the design of our political process to what Medford actually needs and wants.

1333
02:36:46,631 --> 02:36:52,714
[SPEAKER_17]: And I hope that that desire doesn't stop with our residents.

1334
02:36:53,034 --> 02:36:59,457
[SPEAKER_17]: I hope that this version of the charter isn't the endpoint of political reform in our city.

1335
02:37:00,058 --> 02:37:09,302
[SPEAKER_17]: I hope that we keep pushing all of our electeds at every single level to do better when it comes to when it comes to things like

1336
02:37:10,880 --> 02:37:26,887
[SPEAKER_17]: autonomy when it comes to things like empowering cities to do what's right for their residents, for empowering cities to actually respond to resident feedback, to consider the more innovative things that cities should be able to do that in other states cities do all the time.

1337
02:37:29,869 --> 02:37:38,793
[SPEAKER_17]: I think a lot of what I wanted to be considered in this process maybe could have come about with a home rule process.

1338
02:37:39,829 --> 02:37:43,032
[SPEAKER_17]: what it could have come about with an elected charter commission.

1339
02:37:43,612 --> 02:37:49,917
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think we are at the point where that's beyond the scope of our conversation.

1340
02:37:50,618 --> 02:37:59,765
[SPEAKER_17]: I hope my counselors will join me in pushing for those reforms in the future and pushing for more flexibility for Medford to do what's right by a residence.

1341
02:38:00,546 --> 02:38:01,146
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much.

1342
02:38:02,468 --> 02:38:03,348
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

1343
02:38:03,388 --> 02:38:05,310
[SPEAKER_18]: Any further discussion by members of the council or the public?

1344
02:38:10,717 --> 02:38:22,700
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, well, I will just say that I really echo, counselor sayings sentiment, and most of what he actually said to not just a sentiment.

1345
02:38:23,800 --> 02:38:30,902
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the great failing of this process and in many ways municipal governance in Massachusetts is.

1346
02:38:32,191 --> 02:38:42,061
[SPEAKER_18]: that the state laws and the state constitution do not give cities and towns in Massachusetts the powers that cities and towns and most other parts of the country have.

1347
02:38:43,262 --> 02:38:52,672
[SPEAKER_18]: Even our home rule constitutional amendment from the 60s, which enables the home rule charter process, makes it hard for that process to be initiated.

1348
02:38:53,613 --> 02:38:55,675
[SPEAKER_18]: And the real question here is we had to jump through

1349
02:38:56,518 --> 02:39:05,496
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, we, this process went the way it went because we had to go outside of the process that the law and the Constitution offers us.

1350
02:39:07,176 --> 02:39:24,009
[SPEAKER_18]: we had to appoint a study committee that actually was just authorized by the mayor as a matter of policy, rather than the general laws or the state constitution, because we didn't collect enough signatures and the legislature denied our home rule petition, which we did approve.

1351
02:39:24,289 --> 02:39:31,394
[SPEAKER_18]: We approved a 4-3 home rule petition to have an elected charter committee here in Medford, but the legislature has the ability to say no.

1352
02:39:32,015 --> 02:39:34,957
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, even though the mayor and the council by majority vote agreed to that,

1353
02:39:36,856 --> 02:39:43,084
[SPEAKER_18]: The legislature didn't even have to consider it they never had to take a vote on it they never had to even say no to us they just never had to say yes.

1354
02:39:48,064 --> 02:39:49,125
[SPEAKER_18]: our options were limited.

1355
02:39:49,685 --> 02:40:05,456
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going through a special act charter process so still the legislature has to approve everything we want to do, even if the residents wanted rank choice voting or multi member districts or, you know, a model of mayoral involvement with the school committee that hasn't been seen before.

1356
02:40:05,996 --> 02:40:15,223
[SPEAKER_18]: We couldn't actually deliver to voters, what they may have wanted and what this city would like to have seen its form of government look like, because the state

1357
02:40:16,405 --> 02:40:19,246
[SPEAKER_18]: processes basically don't let us do that.

1358
02:40:19,467 --> 02:40:25,610
[SPEAKER_18]: Certainly, the ones that might let us do that are very hard for communities to move through.

1359
02:40:27,110 --> 02:40:39,557
[SPEAKER_18]: We see this when it comes to laws that the council may want to pass around housing, around traffic and transportation, around the safety of people on our streets.

1360
02:40:41,710 --> 02:40:45,291
[SPEAKER_18]: up and down on anything this council and the people of the city may want.

1361
02:40:45,371 --> 02:40:54,093
[SPEAKER_18]: How many times have you emailed a counselor, a school committee member, or a mayor, and they've had to say, sorry, call your state rep, or sorry, call your state senator.

1362
02:40:54,133 --> 02:40:58,834
[SPEAKER_18]: And then you call them and they say, sorry, I need to get 160 other people to agree with me.

1363
02:40:59,274 --> 02:41:02,535
[SPEAKER_18]: And it truly does become an act of Congress to put a crosswalk in.

1364
02:41:02,555 --> 02:41:06,216
[SPEAKER_18]: It's an act of the legislature, an act of the general court, right?

1365
02:41:07,476 --> 02:41:10,937
[SPEAKER_18]: The other thing it does is it pits us against each other, right?

1366
02:41:11,907 --> 02:41:28,500
[SPEAKER_18]: We could have had an elected body that made a recommendation that went right to the voters, and none of us would have had to be involved, and the mayor wouldn't have had to be involved, and the legislator wouldn't have had to be involved, and the people themselves could have directly said, this is the kind of government we wanna see, and then the people themselves could have voted for it.

1367
02:41:29,761 --> 02:41:40,569
[SPEAKER_18]: But instead, our egos, and our personalities, and our opinions, and our thoughts, and our research, and our evidence, and all of our data was forced to get in the middle of that.

1368
02:41:41,883 --> 02:41:42,864
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe we're overcoming it.

1369
02:41:43,884 --> 02:41:45,145
[SPEAKER_18]: We've done that a lot this term.

1370
02:41:50,008 --> 02:41:51,910
[SPEAKER_18]: But the last two terms we didn't.

1371
02:41:52,730 --> 02:41:53,711
[SPEAKER_18]: In Somerville, they haven't.

1372
02:41:53,731 --> 02:41:58,574
[SPEAKER_18]: They've been having this fight for six years now, whether the council wouldn't approve it or the mayor wouldn't approve it.

1373
02:41:59,635 --> 02:42:05,578
[SPEAKER_18]: So something we've talked about here throughout this process is that this is for the future.

1374
02:42:05,598 --> 02:42:06,419
[SPEAKER_18]: This is for the people.

1375
02:42:06,479 --> 02:42:09,081
[SPEAKER_18]: This isn't about the people who are in these offices right now.

1376
02:42:10,704 --> 02:42:20,667
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's self serving to say this but we're lucky that the people who are in these offices right now agreed to disagree to move something forward, because most of the time, it doesn't happen.

1377
02:42:21,747 --> 02:42:26,128
[SPEAKER_18]: And the system and the structure that governs this process is designed for the exact opposite.

1378
02:42:26,888 --> 02:42:36,711
[SPEAKER_18]: So I know there's probably some people who are never going to vote for me again because of the things I proposed here and, you know, some people are going to say that this was the power grab and the other thing wasn't the power grab.

1379
02:42:39,252 --> 02:42:58,556
[SPEAKER_18]: For better or worse, the seven of us and the mayor, it looks like, we'll see, I don't know how many of you are going to vote, got together and said, all right, we'll put our opinions and our egos and our differences aside because the system is designed for us to fail and we don't want to fail.

1380
02:42:59,517 --> 02:43:00,977
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that that is a good story.

1381
02:43:01,941 --> 02:43:11,608
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm happy that I was a part of writing it, even for all the parts that I don't like and all the chapters and all the challenges and conflicts in that story that were not particularly fun.

1382
02:43:12,369 --> 02:43:14,270
[SPEAKER_18]: So with that, maybe we'll get done before nine o'clock.

1383
02:43:14,610 --> 02:43:15,411
[SPEAKER_18]: Any further discussion?

1384
02:43:17,463 --> 02:43:32,310
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, on the motion of Councilor Lazaro to approve as amended to have Council leadership work with the mayor on the technical language surrounding sections 29 and 33 to meet the discussed intent of the Council, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1385
02:43:35,591 --> 02:43:36,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1386
02:43:38,973 --> 02:43:39,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Kellyanne.

1387
02:43:40,354 --> 02:43:40,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1388
02:43:42,295 --> 02:43:43,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Collins.

1389
02:43:49,151 --> 02:43:49,311
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1390
02:43:51,852 --> 02:43:52,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Councils are.

1391
02:43:53,013 --> 02:43:53,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1392
02:43:54,333 --> 02:43:54,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Council lemon.

1393
02:43:56,454 --> 02:43:57,194
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor scrub Kelly.

1394
02:43:58,535 --> 02:44:00,796
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor saying, President bears.

1395
02:44:01,096 --> 02:44:04,077
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, six the affirmative one in the negative, the motion passes.

1396
02:44:05,317 --> 02:44:07,938
[SPEAKER_18]: And we have advanced the draft charter as amended.

1397
02:44:15,361 --> 02:44:24,936
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a motion by count and we're also the B papers so that'll go as well on the motion of Councillor Scarpelli to adjourn seconded by seconded by Council is our all those in favor.

1398
02:44:25,256 --> 02:44:27,640
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, I suppose motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.

1399
02:44:27,680 --> 02:44:27,941
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.
