[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

51
00:02:27,143 --> 00:02:27,823
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner Hunt?

52
00:02:28,264 --> 00:02:28,524
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

53
00:02:29,424 --> 00:02:30,545
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

54
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:31,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

55
00:02:31,786 --> 00:02:32,707
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner Silva?

56
00:02:33,247 --> 00:02:33,507
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

57
00:02:34,068 --> 00:02:34,948
[SPEAKER_18]: Lieutenant Cannava?

58
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:38,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

59
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:42,634
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can move on to new business unless anybody has anything else they want to add here.

60
00:02:48,541 --> 00:03:03,653
[SPEAKER_08]: So for the new business, we have 2025-60, handicap placard sign for Don Antigelli, 71 Central Ave.

61
00:03:05,554 --> 00:03:07,376
[SPEAKER_08]: The paperwork is in order, correct?

62
00:03:07,476 --> 00:03:11,379
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, the paperwork is in order.

63
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,581
[SPEAKER_08]: I never got a chance to get down there this weekend.

64
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:14,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

65
00:03:15,807 --> 00:03:26,192
[SPEAKER_08]: John, if you are available on the Zoom, if you could either raise your hand or put a comment in, because I'm just not seeing your name.

66
00:03:26,232 --> 00:03:28,113
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we have some numbers here that are on Zoom.

67
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:34,215
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're just on audio, I'm not sure if audio can message.

68
00:03:34,235 --> 00:03:37,197
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a phone by the phone.

69
00:03:37,757 --> 00:03:39,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have a phone number for him by any chance?

70
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,115
[SPEAKER_18]: There is a phone number here.

71
00:03:46,035 --> 00:03:49,996
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, Catherine, I assume it's his wife, Antoine Angeli.

72
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:57,438
[SPEAKER_18]: She has a placard too, but this application was put in John's name.

73
00:03:57,498 --> 00:03:59,838
[SPEAKER_18]: So I don't know if Catherine might be representing.

74
00:04:00,298 --> 00:04:05,800
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to actually ask the two phone numbers to unmute because I'm not sure they can talk in the chat.

75
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,620
[SPEAKER_08]: The numbers I have.

76
00:04:08,223 --> 00:04:13,746
[SPEAKER_08]: So 781-396-5138, I'm just- No.

77
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:16,347
[SPEAKER_08]: No, or 781-367-4961?

78
00:04:16,607 --> 00:04:16,787
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

79
00:04:18,028 --> 00:04:26,993
[SPEAKER_12]: Lieutenant, for the public, if you want to raise your hand and you're dialed in on a phone, you can push star nine, and then we'll see that you want to speak.

80
00:04:27,713 --> 00:04:29,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you.

81
00:04:29,154 --> 00:04:30,114
[SPEAKER_08]: So star nine, if-

82
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, we just clicked on you to unmute.

83
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:41,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you here to represent John from 71 Central Ave by any chance?

84
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:46,175
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, but you said my number, 367-4961.

85
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:51,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we didn't know if you were representing the first item on here.

86
00:04:52,057 --> 00:04:53,938
[SPEAKER_08]: So I apologize, we just unmuted you.

87
00:04:54,018 --> 00:04:57,879
[SPEAKER_08]: So what are you here for?

88
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:08,584
[SPEAKER_11]: I am here to give my opinion about the EV stations they're going to put on Lyman Avenue at Cummings Park.

89
00:05:09,285 --> 00:05:09,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

90
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:15,450
[SPEAKER_08]: When we get to that item, I will ask you to unmute now that we have your number so we know that.

91
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:15,990
[SPEAKER_08]: But thank you.

92
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,011
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize.

93
00:05:17,031 --> 00:05:18,012
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get back to you shortly.

94
00:05:20,794 --> 00:05:21,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

95
00:05:21,094 --> 00:05:22,335
[SPEAKER_08]: So, John, if you're here.

96
00:05:22,974 --> 00:05:28,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Star six, nine, if you're a three, nine, six, five, one, three, eight, if that's you.

97
00:05:28,618 --> 00:05:29,999
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know who that is.

98
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:30,979
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not John.

99
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:31,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

100
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,881
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a different resident for Evie as well.

101
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:34,201
[SPEAKER_06]: I think.

102
00:05:34,922 --> 00:05:35,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

103
00:05:35,442 --> 00:05:36,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have his number?

104
00:05:36,723 --> 00:05:37,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, cool.

105
00:05:38,344 --> 00:05:38,824
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll call him.

106
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:39,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

107
00:05:39,705 --> 00:05:40,085
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a number.

108
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:42,166
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to give him a call.

109
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:47,149
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, if you guys are okay with that, we'll move on to the next one and then come back to this one.

110
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,870
[SPEAKER_08]: If you guys are okay.

111
00:05:50,325 --> 00:05:52,266
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to make a motion to do that and we can do that.

112
00:05:52,306 --> 00:05:53,967
[SPEAKER_08]: But we'll go to the next one.

113
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:55,967
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to go to 2025-61 permit parking variance 143 Winthrop Street.

114
00:05:55,987 --> 00:05:56,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Joseph, I believe I saw him.

115
00:05:56,928 --> 00:05:57,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Marose is here.

116
00:06:16,468 --> 00:06:21,152
[SPEAKER_18]: He had no email to forward the notice, but I hand-delivered it myself to his house.

117
00:06:21,552 --> 00:06:21,872
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

118
00:06:24,595 --> 00:06:44,331
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Joseph, if you are here, either star 69 to raise your hand, or if you're the other iPhone user, if you would not either mind going through the chat or raising your hand if you are here for Joseph Morose, 143 Winthrop Street.

119
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:45,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there somebody in the chat?

120
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,311
[SPEAKER_08]: I use John there, please.

121
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Joseph, I'm going to ask you on mute.

[SPEAKER_08]: That was you?

141
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:09,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's me.

142
00:08:11,383 --> 00:08:13,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, do you have a driveway in front of your house?

143
00:08:14,565 --> 00:08:23,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I have a driveway, but I don't have enough space because I have a tenant.

144
00:08:24,412 --> 00:08:27,534
[SPEAKER_00]: I need even some visitors coming.

145
00:08:27,634 --> 00:08:30,856
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have space to, you know, they can park.

146
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

147
00:08:38,161 --> 00:08:39,422
[SPEAKER_08]: How many vehicles do you have in the house?

148
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:41,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, three.

149
00:08:44,412 --> 00:08:46,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this your driveway right here in this house that's on the screen?

150
00:08:46,953 --> 00:08:47,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you see the screen?

151
00:08:53,056 --> 00:08:53,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

152
00:08:54,197 --> 00:08:56,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and this is the driveway that you all share?

153
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but it's not enough.

154
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,481
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I'm looking for a variance.

155
00:09:11,262 --> 00:09:12,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Also going to ask.

156
00:09:20,972 --> 00:09:23,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Natalina, that's correct.

157
00:09:23,935 --> 00:09:24,155
[SPEAKER_14]: Good.

158
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:25,797
[SPEAKER_08]: You we're doing well.

159
00:09:25,837 --> 00:09:28,760
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I know that you said that you're on the balance as well, and you live here as well.

160
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,063
[SPEAKER_08]: So we want to give you the opportunity to kind of speak as well.

161
00:09:31,945 --> 00:09:32,886
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

162
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:42,851
[SPEAKER_14]: So like he was saying, it's only a two car driveway situation and I'm on unit one with me, my mom and her fiance and we have three cars.

163
00:09:43,412 --> 00:09:47,474
[SPEAKER_14]: And then upstairs, which is Joseph and his wife and whoever else.

164
00:09:47,774 --> 00:09:49,695
[SPEAKER_14]: And he just said that they have three cars as well.

165
00:09:50,095 --> 00:09:52,877
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's not really much for us to park.

166
00:09:52,997 --> 00:09:54,078
[SPEAKER_14]: There's like six cars.

167
00:09:54,478 --> 00:09:56,299
[SPEAKER_14]: So we can't really park anywhere.

168
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:57,520
[SPEAKER_14]: And then also,

169
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:16,381
[SPEAKER_14]: just that my mom gets home late at night and I don't feel safe with her walking through that street just because of like the dark and all the cracks in the street and she's had a lot of like spinal issues that she's been trying to work out and she needs back surgery and things like that.

170
00:10:17,001 --> 00:10:18,662
[SPEAKER_14]: I also sometimes get home late.

171
00:10:19,837 --> 00:10:21,438
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've tripped on the cracks.

172
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:26,122
[SPEAKER_14]: People have been like coming, I don't know, the street off of it, off the other street.

173
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:37,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I forget the name, but there's no, the, so if you went down George street and then that first left, I don't know the name of that street.

174
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:48,098
[SPEAKER_14]: I forget what it's called, but that's where we've been parking, like down there and down Winthrop place is where we walk through and cars at night are like coming down fast to turn down that street.

175
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:49,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

176
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:56,289
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would just feel safer with us parking where we used to park in the front.

177
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:04,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so we commissioners just so we're not confused here 2025 and 61 and 62.

178
00:11:05,254 --> 00:11:12,478
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Natalina is speaking right now and Joseph Morose is also speaking and it seems like they live in the same house.

179
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:14,360
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's just easier if they just speak at once.

180
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,561
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can kind of clear up two things at once.

181
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:19,963
[SPEAKER_08]: So commissioners just I'll leave it for you all

182
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:22,789
[SPEAKER_08]: ask any questions you have further.

183
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:40,718
[SPEAKER_12]: So, Lieutenant, what I read in the letter that was provided in their backup documentation is that this springs from basically that they had been parking in the street that is perpendicular to their homes off of on Martin Street.

184
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:49,383
[SPEAKER_12]: And as the commissioners may remember, the residents of Martin Street came to us a couple of months in a row petitioning

185
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:58,253
[SPEAKER_12]: to have their street made permit parking because they felt there wasn't enough parking for the residents in the street because people from all over were parking there.

186
00:11:59,274 --> 00:12:04,597
[SPEAKER_12]: And it seems that perhaps a lot of the cars were actually coming from here across the street on Winthrop Street.

187
00:12:05,478 --> 00:12:18,427
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's basically why this is coming in front of us now, because the conditions, it's not that these families moved into this house without parking with many cars,

188
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:25,559
[SPEAKER_12]: They've been living here, they've had parking on other city streets where they're no longer allowed to park.

189
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:32,643
[SPEAKER_12]: This seems to be a result of us not having zoned parking, but having street by street parking.

190
00:12:33,983 --> 00:12:35,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you for that.

191
00:12:35,604 --> 00:12:38,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if I may add something, Jordan.

192
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:39,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, absolutely.

193
00:12:40,472 --> 00:12:45,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I think because winter street is no parking at all in this area.

194
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:50,445
[SPEAKER_06]: If memory serves me in the past, I believe the commission.

195
00:12:51,546 --> 00:12:55,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Has at times granted variances, but typically on the same side.

196
00:12:56,812 --> 00:13:01,554
[SPEAKER_06]: So, for this side of Winthrop Street, it was typically on, say, the Chester Ave.

197
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Greenleaf side.

198
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:06,556
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if you are home on the other side, Winthrop would typically be on that side.

199
00:13:06,776 --> 00:13:11,458
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's how it's been practically divvied up in the past.

200
00:13:12,338 --> 00:13:18,701
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like George is not a permit parking, not part of the G. Clark Street does not look like it's permit.

201
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:24,221
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, um, summer street, I'm not sure, but winter place is private.

202
00:13:25,082 --> 00:13:28,024
[SPEAKER_06]: So it seems like, um, just wanted to add that for.

203
00:13:28,044 --> 00:13:29,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

204
00:13:30,966 --> 00:13:41,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions or.

205
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,356
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have a quick question for the resident.

206
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:47,818
[SPEAKER_09]: How many folks park in the driveway currently?

207
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:55,090
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now, from what I've seen, there's two cars in the driveway.

208
00:13:58,711 --> 00:14:01,991
[SPEAKER_09]: How many cars could possibly park in there too, per EV?

209
00:14:02,532 --> 00:14:02,972
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

210
00:14:03,912 --> 00:14:04,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

211
00:14:10,293 --> 00:14:14,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Sarah, I see you have your hand raised, but you're more than happy.

212
00:14:14,214 --> 00:14:14,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

213
00:14:14,794 --> 00:14:15,334
[SPEAKER_08]: You're good to go.

214
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,695
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you all hear me?

215
00:14:17,255 --> 00:14:17,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

216
00:14:18,055 --> 00:14:18,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

217
00:14:19,045 --> 00:14:35,294
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to throw in there that since Martin street became permitted between resident permits, as in the residents vehicles themselves and visitor permits, there's a total of 56 permits currently issued to Martin street.

218
00:14:35,694 --> 00:14:45,599
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know there's not 56 spaces there and it's unlikely that all will be used at the same time, but I just wanted to throw that in as food for thought for the commission to consider.

219
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:48,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

220
00:14:50,913 --> 00:14:52,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks like a lot of driveways on Martin Street too.

221
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:56,895
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

222
00:14:57,095 --> 00:14:58,275
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that total number?

223
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:03,197
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that how many are visitors and how many are resident parking?

224
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:04,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

225
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:08,779
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess are those all resident or visitor parking passes as well?

226
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,420
[SPEAKER_15]: It would take me a little time to separate that and get you a count.

227
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:13,980
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

228
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,381
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

229
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Just if you knew it, that's all.

230
00:15:18,122 --> 00:15:18,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

231
00:15:18,522 --> 00:15:18,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

232
00:15:18,642 --> 00:15:18,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

233
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:30,492
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I assumed that those were the actual vehicles that got permits and that each vehicle can also get visitor permits.

234
00:15:36,473 --> 00:15:39,533
[SPEAKER_15]: Each unit could get up to two visitor permits.

235
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:44,534
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure if all the units on that street have utilized both visitor permits.

236
00:15:48,235 --> 00:15:49,635
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just looking real quick here.

237
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:55,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I ask a question in regards to the number of spaces on Martin Street that exist?

238
00:15:56,234 --> 00:16:01,816
[SPEAKER_09]: So if there were 50 passes given out, how many spaces actually exist on the street?

239
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:07,619
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so it looks like there's 24 visitor permits.

240
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:09,800
[SPEAKER_15]: So that means 24, 22, no, 27, 22 and 27, 56.

241
00:16:15,398 --> 00:16:17,039
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

242
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:17,039
34.

243
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:19,761
[SPEAKER_15]: Please spare me math.

244
00:16:19,921 --> 00:16:20,161
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

245
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:22,783
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's 20, 24 visitor permits right now.

246
00:16:22,803 --> 00:16:26,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

247
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,006
[SPEAKER_08]: So 32 of those are residential.

248
00:16:29,347 --> 00:16:29,607
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

249
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:30,567
[SPEAKER_15]: That's how math works.

250
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:31,068
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks.

251
00:16:32,088 --> 00:16:38,612
[SPEAKER_12]: So, and I just, so I thought it would be useful to clarify cause it sounds like there is parking on Clark street.

252
00:16:39,693 --> 00:16:44,656
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and it's just that they're concerned about walking from Clark street back around

253
00:16:45,126 --> 00:16:46,006
[SPEAKER_12]: through Winthrop Place.

254
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,607
[SPEAKER_12]: Winthrop Place is a private way.

255
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:48,687
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very small.

256
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:56,030
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks more like an alley than a road to their home.

257
00:16:57,191 --> 00:17:07,635
[SPEAKER_12]: But I do have concern about giving out permits on a permit parking street when there are non-permit parking streets available to park on.

258
00:17:09,547 --> 00:17:17,269
[SPEAKER_12]: It just, it feels like a slippery slope that every person on Winthrop Street would want a permit to park on Martin Street, wouldn't they?

259
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:31,553
[SPEAKER_06]: To answer Jim's question, Jim, I think there's about 26, 27 available spaces on Martin, I think, because one size restricts it.

260
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:56,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think you might, Todd, I think you might be right.

261
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:56,927
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess.

262
00:17:57,647 --> 00:18:01,129
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel bad for people who live somewhere and the conditions have changed.

263
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:02,989
[SPEAKER_12]: I also, like,

264
00:18:05,353 --> 00:18:16,256
[SPEAKER_12]: I also disagree that the spots in front of your home should be your private parking spot, and that the people who live there can say, we don't want you parking from across the street, because we've made the street permit parking.

265
00:18:16,737 --> 00:18:22,338
[SPEAKER_12]: But that is the nature of the system we have here in Medford, is it's street by street and not regional.

266
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,799
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I don't really know what to do with that.

267
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:27,260
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like a catch-22 here.

268
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it unregulated on Clark Street?

269
00:18:31,701 --> 00:18:34,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what we're saying?

270
00:18:35,683 --> 00:18:41,648
[SPEAKER_06]: It appears to be George, Clark, and Summer, although I didn't confirm Summer.

271
00:18:41,668 --> 00:18:48,574
[SPEAKER_05]: And they do have right of passage through a place.

272
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,917
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just maybe not the best route.

273
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:52,717
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

274
00:18:53,078 --> 00:19:03,827
[SPEAKER_12]: And one other suggestion that I would have is that the person whose mother has difficulty walking should look at getting a handicapped tag.

275
00:19:04,649 --> 00:19:07,270
[SPEAKER_12]: that could open up options for them.

276
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:18,213
[SPEAKER_12]: Not that there is necessarily a handicapped spot right around here, but it does make things more, there are more opportunities if there was something like that.

277
00:19:21,775 --> 00:19:23,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Todd, how many spaces available you said, 27?

278
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:26,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's approximately 26, 27 or so.

279
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:34,061
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, did they say they issued twenty five or twenty six permits plus visitor?

280
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:41,609
[SPEAKER_06]: So, as usual, this I've said at public meetings before the on street parking doesn't necessarily match the demand.

281
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:48,035
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's hence why resident permit is popular because it limits the competition.

282
00:19:57,033 --> 00:19:59,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Just FYI, Summer Street is not permitted.

283
00:19:59,554 --> 00:20:00,314
[SPEAKER_15]: I just double-checked.

284
00:20:00,814 --> 00:20:02,815
[SPEAKER_15]: That section doesn't require permits.

285
00:20:02,915 --> 00:20:09,477
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not until Marston Street, and then even then, it's only overnight between Marston and Gourley.

286
00:20:10,077 --> 00:20:15,079
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the odd side, the closest is either Clark, George, or Summer.

287
00:20:15,099 --> 00:20:23,602
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

288
00:20:29,718 --> 00:20:30,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

289
00:20:34,821 --> 00:20:37,843
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a motion on the table or any other questions.

290
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:42,306
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this is a tough one.

291
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:53,734
[SPEAKER_12]: And to be clear, if the answer is either yes or no on the permit parking on Martin Street, because all of these others are unpermitted,

292
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:56,860
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's nothing that prevents them from parking there now.

293
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,961
[SPEAKER_12]: They just would rather park in this other street.

294
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:03,143
[SPEAKER_12]: It's more convenient, closer to their home across Winthrop.

295
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:09,827
[SPEAKER_12]: Is Martin part of the G zone?

296
00:21:10,707 --> 00:21:10,907
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

297
00:21:11,627 --> 00:21:11,768
[SPEAKER_18]: No?

298
00:21:11,868 --> 00:21:12,748
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

299
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:22,873
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a recently permitted street because the residents came to us, and I remember that they were in front of us on two different meetings asking for it.

300
00:21:27,175 --> 00:21:27,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

301
00:21:28,195 --> 00:21:32,217
[SPEAKER_06]: The G zone's just kind of down just beyond George Street to the south.

302
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:38,679
[SPEAKER_06]: The interesting thing is the first street after that, Spencer, was the one street that opted out of the G zone.

303
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:40,160
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's non-perma either.

304
00:21:44,058 --> 00:21:59,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, we don't have control over Winthrop Place to make improvements, but I'm wondering, you know, if the city wanted to support sending a letter to the owners to tell them to make improvements.

305
00:22:03,651 --> 00:22:06,513
[SPEAKER_12]: And is that, when I look at it, it's,

306
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:07,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Should be right.

307
00:22:08,371 --> 00:22:10,553
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks more like a shared use path in a road.

308
00:22:10,593 --> 00:22:12,195
[SPEAKER_12]: Do people actually drive on that?

309
00:22:13,016 --> 00:22:14,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they do from Clark.

310
00:22:14,597 --> 00:22:18,181
[SPEAKER_08]: They a lot good about more than you would think.

311
00:22:19,402 --> 00:22:20,463
[SPEAKER_09]: I ride my bike on it.

312
00:22:22,165 --> 00:22:25,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Right on clock left on winter place.

313
00:22:25,688 --> 00:22:29,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there's a, there's a public interest there.

314
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

315
00:22:48,544 --> 00:22:51,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I guess the parking situation is like on Clark.

316
00:22:51,646 --> 00:22:53,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there like abundant parking or.

317
00:22:57,111 --> 00:22:57,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it clogged.

318
00:23:00,233 --> 00:23:05,838
[SPEAKER_08]: I, I can't say that I've been on Clark street that often, but I feel like there are a decent amount of spots.

319
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:13,624
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't feel like ever any time that I've driven by Clark on the day or night that it was been over populated with vehicles parked there.

320
00:23:14,554 --> 00:23:22,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I've been down there numerous times on complaints and the sample parking.

321
00:23:23,601 --> 00:23:24,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'll drop it on Clark.

322
00:23:24,621 --> 00:23:29,845
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just doing the distances from the house to George and Clark seem about the same actually.

323
00:23:43,892 --> 00:23:55,396
[SPEAKER_12]: And if I was gonna really, really think out of the box, my only sort of solution would be, and I don't know if we would even consider putting a handicap spot on the end of Martin Street.

324
00:23:56,536 --> 00:24:05,079
[SPEAKER_12]: And then if somebody in their household had a handicap placard, they could use that, but that everybody else should be using Clark Street because it's unpermitted.

325
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:08,620
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, if you were commenting, we couldn't hear you.

326
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:19,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Mr. Rose, Joseph, do you have something else to say on that?

327
00:24:20,511 --> 00:24:24,873
[SPEAKER_08]: We just couldn't hear you.

328
00:24:25,013 --> 00:24:31,734
[SPEAKER_17]: This is Moe's wife.

329
00:24:32,475 --> 00:24:41,817
[SPEAKER_17]: Long time ago, I asked her to put Enzika parking for me on the mountain street because I can't walk long, but they never put it.

330
00:24:43,902 --> 00:24:46,443
[SPEAKER_08]: You said you have a handicap like it already, or?

331
00:24:46,764 --> 00:24:47,084
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

332
00:24:47,464 --> 00:24:49,125
[SPEAKER_17]: It's obvious.

333
00:24:50,385 --> 00:24:52,787
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I got it.

334
00:24:53,067 --> 00:24:55,628
[SPEAKER_17]: I got the plate on my car, but I don't have.

335
00:24:57,469 --> 00:25:02,972
[SPEAKER_17]: Before, my co-spot is Medford Police.

336
00:25:03,012 --> 00:25:08,715
[SPEAKER_17]: He asked for me for the parking space on the Martin Street.

337
00:25:13,384 --> 00:25:16,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Todd, does Martin Street have any handicap placards?

338
00:25:17,888 --> 00:25:18,228
[SPEAKER_17]: Not sure.

339
00:25:18,248 --> 00:25:19,990
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't have on Martin Street.

340
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,652
[SPEAKER_17]: I asked to put one for me.

341
00:25:22,792 --> 00:25:23,673
[SPEAKER_17]: They never put it.

342
00:25:24,033 --> 00:25:24,814
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.

343
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:28,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Sarah might have a list handy, potentially.

344
00:25:29,117 --> 00:25:36,544
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to go out on a limb and say that if this was this more than five years ago, was this how long?

345
00:25:40,127 --> 00:25:41,348
[SPEAKER_12]: Was this many years ago?

346
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:43,481
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

347
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:46,542
[SPEAKER_12]: Before the pandemic?

348
00:25:49,063 --> 00:25:49,343
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

349
00:25:49,944 --> 00:25:50,224
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

350
00:25:50,864 --> 00:26:04,610
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to go out on a limb and say that perhaps previous members of the traffic commission would have been reluctant to put a handicapped parking spot in front of someone else's house for someone who lived on a different street.

351
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:10,532
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't know that that's how this commission would

352
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,563
[SPEAKER_12]: would see that we would see it as the nearest available location.

353
00:26:15,944 --> 00:26:19,226
[SPEAKER_12]: Sarah.

354
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:28,774
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm showing an accessible space issued to a resident who's not this resident at 33 Martin Street back in 2015.

355
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:32,757
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all I have for accessible spaces on Martin Street.

356
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:37,363
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's pretty far down on Martin.

357
00:26:37,624 --> 00:26:40,685
[SPEAKER_12]: So that would be the bar, the other end of the block.

358
00:26:41,686 --> 00:26:42,927
[SPEAKER_12]: I just Google mapped it.

359
00:26:46,729 --> 00:26:47,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

360
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:55,215
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess when we would yeah.

361
00:26:56,983 --> 00:26:57,483
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.

362
00:26:57,503 --> 00:26:58,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

363
00:26:59,004 --> 00:27:02,905
[SPEAKER_00]: We live close to Martin Street, face to face to Martin Street.

364
00:27:03,045 --> 00:27:03,745
[SPEAKER_00]: Martin Street.

365
00:27:05,345 --> 00:27:06,305
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we live.

366
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:11,407
[SPEAKER_00]: We live here for a long, long time, since 1999.

367
00:27:11,887 --> 00:27:14,428
[SPEAKER_00]: So we never have a problem to park there.

368
00:27:14,568 --> 00:27:20,069
[SPEAKER_00]: So even at night, we see no car parking.

369
00:27:20,209 --> 00:27:23,730
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why they don't give us a variance to park there.

370
00:27:26,267 --> 00:27:32,530
[SPEAKER_00]: If even some visitors come in to see us, you know, we don't have, they don't, they can pack it.

371
00:27:36,951 --> 00:27:37,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

372
00:27:37,692 --> 00:27:38,292
[SPEAKER_08]: We understand.

373
00:27:39,913 --> 00:27:40,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll throw a plug.

374
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:51,597
[SPEAKER_06]: If, if resident permits zoned, if additional zones ever come up, I would encourage this person and others to attend and be in support of the zones.

375
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,378
[SPEAKER_06]: So this will help the situation.

376
00:27:57,088 --> 00:28:00,730
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess I'd pass it on to the commissioners that are there for the motion.

377
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:08,493
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that their motion is for Martin street, but if I'm kind of catching what Alicia's commissioner hunt is saying.

378
00:28:09,573 --> 00:28:11,694
[SPEAKER_08]: potentially adding it.

379
00:28:11,714 --> 00:28:24,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have a person that lives in this house that has a handicapped placard, and the closest available place is Martin Street, but there's no crossing, there's no handicapped accessible crossing to get over to the other side of Winthrop Street?

380
00:28:24,998 --> 00:28:28,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's my concern.

381
00:28:28,379 --> 00:28:31,020
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate you bringing that up, Tim.

382
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:38,102
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, basically, we'd be encouraging jaywalking right there, and the next crosswalk would be at Clark Street where they could park anyway.

383
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:56,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'd almost be, I mean, if the biggest concern parking on Clark Street is Winthrop Place, maybe there's a way to work with the owners of Winthrop Place to make it a better alleyway, function as an alleyway, actually, and not a rutted out mess.

384
00:28:57,626 --> 00:28:59,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I think police need to get back there.

385
00:29:00,228 --> 00:29:07,134
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys respond to those, you might need to respond to those garage buildings that are only accessed by Winthrop Place, fire department as well.

386
00:29:08,315 --> 00:29:11,157
[SPEAKER_05]: The community uses the path as well, the alley.

387
00:29:12,378 --> 00:29:18,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we've passed it on to fire and the board of health and they've gone out multiple times.

388
00:29:22,907 --> 00:29:30,453
[SPEAKER_08]: We passed, I think Dennis McDonald went out there a couple of times and I think passed an ordinance through them.

389
00:29:30,573 --> 00:29:35,777
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's not a whole lot that we can do if they're on a private property.

390
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:36,557
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more a fire.

391
00:29:39,317 --> 00:29:41,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Health issue or building block.

392
00:29:41,578 --> 00:30:03,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we just they have to they have to keep access to the buildings available So if it's all read it out in a truck or your vehicles can't get down and then it's not up to snuff Yeah, so we write letters of the DPW writes letters to private way owners asking them to make improvements Just to kind of put them on notice like we're not planning on improving it, but you guys should so I guess the question would be if they

393
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:09,010
[SPEAKER_08]: The letters, if they don't improve it, is there what is what is the other options if they don't.

394
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:15,513
[SPEAKER_05]: The city does does something on its own, but that would be have to be like a mayor or city council type action.

395
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:20,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so there's no consequence if they don't replace the road.

396
00:30:21,395 --> 00:30:27,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm just trying to think for the benefit of the community that I'll get folks like this that.

397
00:30:29,817 --> 00:30:38,728
[SPEAKER_05]: are in need of parking spaces and the changing aspect of the city where rights of ways will be used for different ways.

398
00:30:39,229 --> 00:30:42,853
[SPEAKER_05]: People accessing, walking, riding, whatever, driving.

399
00:30:44,193 --> 00:30:46,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Tim, who would contribute to that?

400
00:30:46,776 --> 00:30:48,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't you have to face that street?

401
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:59,468
[SPEAKER_05]: We have an ordinance in Medford that basically allows the city to pay for half, I think, or contribute half the costs for a private way improvement.

402
00:31:00,148 --> 00:31:00,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

403
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:01,269
[SPEAKER_04]: So that can happen.

404
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

405
00:31:02,891 --> 00:31:05,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't see that any of the houses actually front that.

406
00:31:07,452 --> 00:31:10,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it seems like most of the, two of the houses front Clark street.

407
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

408
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:14,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Adjacent borders.

409
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,858
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not really the address.

410
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:16,599
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the border.

411
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:20,321
[SPEAKER_05]: I say front the pure word frontage.

412
00:31:20,381 --> 00:31:22,983
[SPEAKER_05]: They do front on a winter place.

413
00:31:23,203 --> 00:31:24,064
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a writer.

414
00:31:24,344 --> 00:31:25,165
[SPEAKER_05]: They have frontage on it.

415
00:31:25,725 --> 00:31:25,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

416
00:31:26,806 --> 00:31:33,651
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's their road, but you know, the public uses it and has a right to use it because it connects to public ways.

417
00:31:35,622 --> 00:31:39,984
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think anyone's mentioned this yet, but there is a two-car driveway.

418
00:31:40,124 --> 00:31:50,449
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is a possibility, not a definite, of people that are more able-bodied to park further away and allow the person with the placard to use the driveway.

419
00:31:50,469 --> 00:31:59,634
[SPEAKER_12]: And to be clear, I think I heard that each household, one has somebody with a placard and the other has somebody who's having

420
00:32:01,514 --> 00:32:03,356
[SPEAKER_12]: physical difficulties.

421
00:32:03,996 --> 00:32:08,120
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that my suggestion was that they also get a placard if they don't have one already.

422
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:19,131
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe Natalina, if you want to, do you also have, does your mother have a placard or she needs to apply for one, if you want to clarify that?

423
00:32:19,672 --> 00:32:19,832
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

424
00:32:20,052 --> 00:32:23,075
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, no, she doesn't have a placard, so I assume she would have to apply for one.

425
00:32:24,016 --> 00:32:24,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

426
00:32:24,697 --> 00:32:24,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

427
00:32:32,873 --> 00:32:52,684
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess we kind of talked about a lot of options, so I guess I'll just ask if the commissioners want to put a motion for this, or if we have to rework the motion in whatever way, if it's Martin Street or Blackart or Clark from resident parking issue or ordinance.

428
00:32:59,989 --> 00:33:01,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if there's another motion.

429
00:33:03,335 --> 00:33:11,200
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess I'm not, I could be argued, but I'm not inclined to approve the permits for Martin street.

430
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,142
[SPEAKER_12]: It just doesn't feel like the right thing to do.

431
00:33:13,162 --> 00:33:15,103
[SPEAKER_12]: It, it does.

432
00:33:16,464 --> 00:33:29,192
[SPEAKER_12]: It is us saying we approve the jaywalking because if they were not jaywalking, they would be going down to Clark street or Winthrop or they'd be going to Clark street to cross.

433
00:33:29,934 --> 00:33:30,214
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

434
00:33:30,434 --> 00:33:35,719
[SPEAKER_12]: It's it feels unsafe for people to be crossing that at night, although we all do it.

435
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:37,941
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it happens.

436
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:47,109
[SPEAKER_05]: But as a crosswalk density right here, do we have a sufficient amount of crosswalks in Winthrop Street or should we have one at Martin Street?

437
00:33:47,749 --> 00:33:51,312
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it Goldilocks is the next West Street.

438
00:33:51,713 --> 00:33:55,496
[SPEAKER_14]: There's one right at the intersection of Summer Street and then one at George Street.

439
00:33:55,851 --> 00:33:56,912
[SPEAKER_05]: George Street is the one.

440
00:33:58,253 --> 00:33:58,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

441
00:33:58,714 --> 00:34:15,330
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, because I'm wondering, like, if you were to follow a accessible path from the handicap, a handicap spot, either on Martin street or Clark street, you are in this situation where we might have similar paths here or Clark street might even be closer without having a crosswalk.

442
00:34:15,871 --> 00:34:16,612
[SPEAKER_05]: That wouldn't treat.

443
00:34:17,132 --> 00:34:24,597
[SPEAKER_05]: So the way I see it is that, you know, if the city, I think we've put ourselves in this pickle and we've kind of put the residents in this pickle.

444
00:34:24,677 --> 00:34:31,201
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I feel like I can't say yes to this either because of what we've done and the kind of the master plan that's in place.

445
00:34:31,741 --> 00:34:34,683
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think we could make things a little bit easier.

446
00:34:34,703 --> 00:34:41,627
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it might have something to do with Winthrop Place, making that a little bit better to traverse.

447
00:34:44,431 --> 00:34:49,893
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that would have additional extra, like, benefits to other people as well being able.

448
00:34:50,253 --> 00:34:54,435
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we've heard that other people go through that bad air that road.

449
00:34:55,656 --> 00:34:55,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

450
00:34:58,882 --> 00:35:16,711
[SPEAKER_05]: I also that's where I'm on that's where I'm at on this, because if we put up a handicap parking space on Martin, we're not sending someone across with the street was sending them, taking it right down with the street, going to the next nearest crosswalk, going across going on the sidewalk on the other side of the street and then heading down back down the street to get to their property.

451
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:16,771
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

452
00:35:18,672 --> 00:35:24,233
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, it makes a lot more sense to have a handicapped parking space on Clark Street, which is unregulated parking.

453
00:35:24,913 --> 00:35:27,614
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it could be right in the corner of Winthrop Place and Clark.

454
00:35:28,314 --> 00:35:42,197
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the city, and I can't speak for the mayor or city council, but it might be a worthy candidate for doing a half and half thing to put a fresh layer of pavement down.

455
00:35:42,317 --> 00:35:46,418
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just an alley, so it's basically a 10-foot wide piece of pavement.

456
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:49,760
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really not that big of a deal.

457
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,521
[SPEAKER_05]: The city could just do it in-house.

458
00:35:53,302 --> 00:36:02,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't put that on the table officially, but I think we could, as a traffic commission, recommend it because of the parking pickle that we've put ourselves in.

459
00:36:04,169 --> 00:36:16,718
[SPEAKER_12]: And if it's more appropriate, I would be happy to motion that the traffic commission should recommend, if I understand correctly, to the mayor or to the city council

460
00:36:17,736 --> 00:36:18,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're both involved.

461
00:36:18,836 --> 00:36:24,458
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to look at the ordinance, but I think the proposal has to be by the mayor and the city council votes to approve it.

462
00:36:24,798 --> 00:36:33,422
[SPEAKER_12]: To recommend to the mayor that the city repave, is that too strong of a word?

463
00:36:34,982 --> 00:36:36,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Improve, that is generally speaking.

464
00:36:37,263 --> 00:36:41,284
[SPEAKER_12]: Improve Winthrop Place in the interest of public safety.

465
00:36:42,745 --> 00:36:43,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

466
00:36:45,360 --> 00:37:01,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Due to the, I don't know, I mean, due to the parking situation that we put ourselves in, I guess, because we've approved parking, a permit parking on Martin Street, we've sort of displaced unregulated parkers that live on a street that has no parking on it.

467
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:06,310
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, everybody knows when the street has no room for parking at all.

468
00:37:09,011 --> 00:37:12,273
[SPEAKER_04]: And Kim, did you say we could not put a crosswalk there?

469
00:37:14,017 --> 00:37:17,718
[SPEAKER_05]: We could put 1, we could also make that recommendation.

470
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:19,639
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just not something that can happen.

471
00:37:19,659 --> 00:37:26,602
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it would be a more expensive project that would involve outside contractors for sure.

472
00:37:26,722 --> 00:37:26,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

473
00:37:27,182 --> 00:37:28,683
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not sure if it's warranted.

474
00:37:28,703 --> 00:37:34,745
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think Todd chimed in because we have 1 down at the bagel shop and then we have 1 down near Marshall street or George street.

475
00:37:35,225 --> 00:37:41,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the spacing was between winter and George is about 750 feet and, you know, it's sort of.

476
00:37:42,167 --> 00:37:51,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Somewhat normal for a road like that, I would say for ramps, you know, if we had enough money to do a lot more, we could consider that with crosswalks through this commission.

477
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:57,132
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would also say that there are many other potentially higher need areas that are.

478
00:37:58,673 --> 00:37:59,533
[SPEAKER_06]: have needs as well.

479
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:08,019
[SPEAKER_06]: So as usual, it's even if you have the money weighing which one's next in line, how many people it's serving type of thing.

480
00:38:13,232 --> 00:38:19,593
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd also like to mention this might be an opportunity also to look into zone parking.

481
00:38:20,434 --> 00:38:29,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Specifically, we're creating environment where, as Todd alluded to, there are 27 spaces and potentially 34 passes, et cetera.

482
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:31,996
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're creating a bottleneck.

483
00:38:32,556 --> 00:38:40,438
[SPEAKER_09]: This gives us an opportunity to add this as something we should review specifically based on the need here and others.

484
00:38:46,928 --> 00:38:52,393
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm not going to make the motion though, just so you guys know.

485
00:38:52,773 --> 00:39:06,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I guess the motion, I don't think we just can we table it till we can ask the mayor and city council, or is this something I think that the commission should make a formal motion to the mayor about it.

486
00:39:06,965 --> 00:39:10,308
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, that it came from the whole group and it's not like just.

487
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:21,540
[SPEAKER_05]: one person asking, um, but whether we should, we should disconnect it from this particular issue, but this particular issue is evidence that we should do something.

488
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:22,681
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

489
00:39:22,781 --> 00:39:25,742
[SPEAKER_12]: Would that change our decision on this?

490
00:39:26,486 --> 00:39:27,607
[SPEAKER_12]: these variances.

491
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:44,743
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure that I'm not sure that you can make a decision on these two motions until you understand what the mayor and city council is going to say, because if they deny it, then the decision that you all make tonight may be different than if they approved it.

492
00:39:45,973 --> 00:39:49,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I can't get to yes tonight, so I'm not gonna vote to approve this.

493
00:39:50,737 --> 00:39:57,202
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it might be easier to table it until, would an answer be able to be done by the next traffic commission meeting, I'm not sure.

494
00:39:57,902 --> 00:40:02,106
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure we're gonna grant the variances onto Martin Street though, because the numbers don't work.

495
00:40:03,106 --> 00:40:13,334
[SPEAKER_04]: I would rather, if the petitioners would be okay with it, would be to table their requests, and then us as a group make another motion

496
00:40:14,617 --> 00:40:20,040
[SPEAKER_04]: to city council and the mayor's office to look into this and improving Winthrop Place.

497
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Because otherwise, I agree.

498
00:40:21,681 --> 00:40:32,127
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't just approve a parking spot across the street that you're going to risk your life getting to.

499
00:40:32,147 --> 00:40:35,589
[SPEAKER_04]: We can table theirs and then come up with a new motion as Alicia pointed out.

500
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:38,451
[SPEAKER_12]: Does that give them the impression we might approve it later?

501
00:40:43,796 --> 00:40:46,218
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure that that gives an impression that it's going to be approved later.

502
00:40:46,258 --> 00:40:51,282
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think that you'll have more information on whether or not you're.

503
00:40:52,245 --> 00:40:59,489
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, is the decision going to be different from the commissioner's if they don't approve any improvements on their place?

504
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:03,151
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I would think the minutes would support the idea of why we tabled it.

505
00:41:03,171 --> 00:41:05,413
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't necessarily that we would approve it.

506
00:41:07,434 --> 00:41:19,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be clear, I can't support this on Martin Street, but I would love to help them get better access to a street that does have the parking that they need.

507
00:41:20,429 --> 00:41:22,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I string them along.

508
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:26,312
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we're ever going to get to yes on this because the numbers don't work unless it was a handicapped parking space.

509
00:41:27,173 --> 00:41:34,197
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we probably then, because we put ourselves in this pickle, need to come up with something to at least help mitigate the impacts.

510
00:41:34,537 --> 00:41:38,460
[SPEAKER_05]: And that could be making some improvements to Winthrop Place.

511
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Or it could be putting a crosswalk right there across Winthrop Street with proper ramps.

512
00:41:45,198 --> 00:41:51,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I think those are, but I think neither 1 of those solutions involves granting variances for permits on Martin street.

513
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:51,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately.

514
00:41:52,401 --> 00:42:09,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm trying to illustrate here that regardless of what happens with winter place, there's a good condition sidewalk on winter to get to George, which is ultimately it looks longer, but it's only like 50 feet more than going winter place to Clark to get parking.

515
00:42:10,068 --> 00:42:13,850
[SPEAKER_06]: So his 400 to George and here's.

516
00:42:16,663 --> 00:42:20,406
[SPEAKER_06]: here's 400 to Clark or the first space 350.

517
00:42:20,546 --> 00:42:23,628
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not actually that much different.

518
00:42:23,748 --> 00:42:29,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Winthrop Street conditions are good sidewalks, if that helps any.

519
00:42:30,413 --> 00:42:43,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, can I ask a question on the corner of George on that side of the street between Clark and Winthrop, isn't there some conditional parking as a bus stop that's specific to that as well on that first block of Clark?

520
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,721
[SPEAKER_06]: You may be right.

521
00:42:50,102 --> 00:42:53,525
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's check.

522
00:42:53,545 --> 00:42:55,106
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm just in relation.

523
00:42:55,146 --> 00:43:02,793
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like thousands of feet longer is what I'm trying to say, you know, but, um, but there's a bus stop immediately there, but I measure it to this block, I think.

524
00:43:03,894 --> 00:43:05,295
[SPEAKER_06]: So this 1 is, um.

525
00:43:05,933 --> 00:43:09,235
[SPEAKER_17]: Talking about a permit of 30 minutes.

526
00:43:09,395 --> 00:43:12,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so the first block of George actually is permit.

527
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:16,020
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not part of the G zone.

528
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,883
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, it is a little longer, but thank you for that, Jim.

529
00:43:21,664 --> 00:43:22,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Stan corrected.

530
00:43:23,004 --> 00:43:27,187
[SPEAKER_06]: This side of the street, it might have that same stipulation.

531
00:43:28,228 --> 00:43:31,090
[SPEAKER_06]: So apparently the first block of George is permit.

532
00:43:32,503 --> 00:43:42,773
[SPEAKER_05]: And that would actually be a more appropriate spot for a handicapped space because the condition of the sidewalk is better from there to the house then along with the place as it currently stands.

533
00:43:42,793 --> 00:43:45,916
[SPEAKER_05]: So even that would help maybe.

534
00:43:45,936 --> 00:43:50,260
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet you that would probably be just as close as monastery as well.

535
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,242
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't have to be 30 minute parking.

536
00:43:52,462 --> 00:43:54,945
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why it is, but it could be a handicapped space.

537
00:43:58,801 --> 00:44:04,728
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there was a legacy from, there used to be a store on the corner where the bus stop is, and that's no longer the case.

538
00:44:05,789 --> 00:44:06,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

539
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:06,990
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

540
00:44:07,831 --> 00:44:08,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

541
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:12,817
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is a bus stop on both sides of the first space on each side of that George.

542
00:44:12,857 --> 00:44:13,918
[SPEAKER_06]: But then after that, yeah.

543
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:15,460
[SPEAKER_06]: It's closer than Martin.

544
00:44:15,981 --> 00:44:16,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

545
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Good call.

546
00:44:22,854 --> 00:44:37,686
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess we would pass it back to the residents if we made a variance or the commissioners if they made a variance for a handicapped placard to be replaced the 30 minute parking for a handicapped placard.

547
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:46,032
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if the other residents mom would like to apply for a handicapped placard could have another alternative there.

548
00:44:52,888 --> 00:44:53,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

549
00:44:58,593 --> 00:44:59,073
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, sorry.

550
00:44:59,114 --> 00:44:59,734
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to speak.

551
00:44:59,754 --> 00:45:05,119
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if he's going to speak yet, but I can see if my mom would like to do that.

552
00:45:05,499 --> 00:45:18,650
[SPEAKER_14]: But I feel like one of the, like another main concern is that if Clark street does eventually get packed, let's say in a few years, if they start wanting to permit that too, are we just going to keep having to move further and further away?

553
00:45:21,263 --> 00:45:26,486
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is where we as a traffic commission would rather see a zone.

554
00:45:26,927 --> 00:45:34,032
[SPEAKER_12]: And if there was a zone created, then as Winthrop street residents, you would be eligible to get permit parking in that zone.

555
00:45:36,194 --> 00:45:36,494
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

556
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:42,138
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you're at all familiar with the G zone, so it's a little bit closer to the green line.

557
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:45,581
[SPEAKER_12]: That was the first zone ever in the city of Medford.

558
00:45:46,163 --> 00:46:03,408
[SPEAKER_12]: And at that time, we actually tried to pass two zones, the G zone close to the spots, to the T stops, and another zone that would have incorporated your area that's around that area for permit parking as well.

559
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:09,430
[SPEAKER_12]: Only more residents showed up saying, we don't want permit parking on our street.

560
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:11,631
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't want zoned parking.

561
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:15,914
[SPEAKER_12]: in those areas and so that portion didn't get passed.

562
00:46:17,655 --> 00:46:22,958
[SPEAKER_12]: And so now we're seeing the results of not having put in zone parking there.

563
00:46:23,778 --> 00:46:38,647
[SPEAKER_12]: And so partially I'm trying to raise your awareness because this issue isn't going away and exactly what you're predicting, what we're hoping is that people like you would come and show up and say, actually we'd like a zone, not just street by street parking.

564
00:46:39,529 --> 00:46:40,830
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we can try to remember too.

565
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:43,731
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe if we can put a note somehow on Clark street.

566
00:46:44,772 --> 00:46:48,214
[SPEAKER_05]: So when it does come up, we should be aware of that.

567
00:46:48,394 --> 00:46:52,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause we need to advocate too, as a commission for the zone parking.

568
00:46:52,076 --> 00:46:54,158
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think ultimately we get to vote on it.

569
00:46:54,298 --> 00:46:56,379
[SPEAKER_05]: It just needs to be engineered and presented.

570
00:46:56,399 --> 00:46:57,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

571
00:47:01,362 --> 00:47:03,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

572
00:47:03,743 --> 00:47:06,345
[SPEAKER_08]: We definitely talked about a lot of options, so I guess,

573
00:47:09,762 --> 00:47:11,423
[SPEAKER_08]: sit back to the commissioners if they have.

574
00:47:11,963 --> 00:47:13,844
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to move to deny the proposal.

575
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:21,768
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I want to then make a separate motion for a recommendation.

576
00:47:22,008 --> 00:47:30,493
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also kind of want one of my fellow commissioners to step in on that recommendation, just because I'm with the DPW and I've laid out some options that I think are practical.

577
00:47:32,113 --> 00:47:33,394
[SPEAKER_05]: But let my colleagues pick it.

578
00:47:33,454 --> 00:47:37,956
[SPEAKER_05]: But my first motion is to deny the motion, unfortunately.

579
00:47:38,036 --> 00:47:38,977
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the position we're in.

580
00:47:39,911 --> 00:47:40,171
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

581
00:47:40,872 --> 00:47:42,333
[SPEAKER_18]: Both motions 61 and 62.

582
00:47:42,753 --> 00:47:43,554
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

583
00:47:43,574 --> 00:47:47,017
[SPEAKER_08]: So just to clarify both motions, you'll be denying 61.

584
00:47:47,697 --> 00:47:47,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

585
00:47:47,917 --> 00:47:48,938
[SPEAKER_05]: The same address, right?

586
00:47:48,958 --> 00:47:49,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Same requests.

587
00:47:50,139 --> 00:47:50,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

588
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,923
[SPEAKER_08]: If I can package them together, that would be, or we can.

589
00:47:54,943 --> 00:47:55,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

590
00:47:55,363 --> 00:47:55,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

591
00:47:55,743 --> 00:47:56,744
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nothing personal.

592
00:47:57,345 --> 00:48:00,507
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a denial motion by commissioner McKibbin, seconded by.

593
00:48:01,368 --> 00:48:01,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

594
00:48:02,609 --> 00:48:03,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Commissioner Brzezinski.

595
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:05,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call alpha.

596
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:07,953
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner McKibbin.

597
00:48:09,335 --> 00:48:09,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

598
00:48:10,335 --> 00:48:11,095
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner Hunt.

599
00:48:11,576 --> 00:48:11,856
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

600
00:48:14,416 --> 00:48:15,517
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner Brzezinski.

601
00:48:15,997 --> 00:48:16,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

602
00:48:16,917 --> 00:48:17,857
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner Silva.

603
00:48:18,597 --> 00:48:18,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

604
00:48:20,278 --> 00:48:21,218
[SPEAKER_18]: Lieutenant Canaba.

605
00:48:22,078 --> 00:48:22,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

606
00:48:22,839 --> 00:48:35,782
[SPEAKER_08]: So to the residents, the motion has been denied and we will make another motion that Commissioner McKibbin was speaking of that may

607
00:48:36,657 --> 00:48:41,021
[SPEAKER_08]: alleviate some of the issues for your parking meter.

608
00:48:41,422 --> 00:48:43,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, yeah.

609
00:48:43,484 --> 00:48:45,786
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to make the motion if you could just help me with the language.

610
00:48:45,886 --> 00:48:47,568
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you actually, what are we looking for?

611
00:48:48,218 --> 00:48:51,539
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's what we want to do if we want to present a palette of options.

612
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:57,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we can say things like, you know, the parking demand on Clark Street is increasing.

613
00:48:57,982 --> 00:49:14,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Therefore, when their place is becoming more important as an alleyway, and please improve it, it could be proactively putting a handicapped spot on George Street where that 30-minute parking space is, because we know that this person has a handicapped placard, and that may be helpful to them.

614
00:49:16,108 --> 00:49:18,569
[SPEAKER_05]: What would need to go to the mayor's office?

615
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,230
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be Winthrop Place, right?

616
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:22,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Winthrop Place is spending money on Winthrop Place, yeah.

617
00:49:22,831 --> 00:49:32,795
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing we could do just by, I mean, if this homeowner came back and petitioned for a handicap spot on George, would we accept that given the proximity issue?

618
00:49:33,938 --> 00:49:35,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Or we, I mean, that's how it works.

619
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:43,167
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you look at this and you say, okay, what's the closest parking space that's available to this property for an accessible space?

620
00:49:43,227 --> 00:49:45,209
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looks like to me, it would be George street.

621
00:49:47,311 --> 00:49:50,194
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just the way it is now, but we could also say.

622
00:49:51,175 --> 00:49:57,457
[SPEAKER_05]: can have engineering look at putting a crosswalk at the intersection of Martin Street and Winthrop Street.

623
00:49:57,778 --> 00:50:14,124
[SPEAKER_05]: But like Todd said, that just goes in a queue for every other request that we have and wouldn't necessarily rise to the top because from a city perspective, we want to have the right density of crosswalks and we're not looking to individually put crosswalks in to benefit certain individual pathways.

624
00:50:14,604 --> 00:50:17,685
[SPEAKER_05]: We're looking at it as a connectivity map.

625
00:50:19,045 --> 00:50:25,010
[SPEAKER_04]: So if he made a motion, like who would put the presentation together to talk to the mayor's office or city council about it?

626
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:30,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't wanna, that, you know, if I made the motion, I wouldn't prepare the proposal.

627
00:50:31,114 --> 00:50:33,716
[SPEAKER_04]: So would that be your office, Todd's office?

628
00:50:35,437 --> 00:50:35,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

629
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:36,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.

630
00:50:36,638 --> 00:50:47,547
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess my point is, is what, you know, what does this commission feel like is appropriate for this particular, you know, day, this situation that we're presented as a piece of evidence to say, okay, well,

631
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:49,250
[SPEAKER_05]: What do we do here?

632
00:50:49,590 --> 00:51:04,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I would recommend the idea if the resident is open to it today, proactively voting on approving a handicapped spot on George Street, if that seems helpful to them.

633
00:51:05,894 --> 00:51:16,837
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also ask the engineering division to look at the recommendation for connectivity using Winthrop Place and potentially an additional crosswalk on Winthrop Street.

634
00:51:18,904 --> 00:51:34,070
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'd be a motion for public works or transportation to work with the city on coming up with a solution to better improve Winthrop Place to provide access for Winthrop Street residents to Clark Street.

635
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:34,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

636
00:51:36,071 --> 00:51:36,291
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

637
00:51:37,071 --> 00:51:38,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Alva, did you get that?

638
00:51:39,352 --> 00:51:40,313
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I think so.

639
00:51:44,217 --> 00:51:45,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I would make that motion.

640
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:57,302
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's worthwhile if we have a street like that, or an avenue like that, or an alley like that, to not have use of it as not in the best interest of everybody.

641
00:51:58,943 --> 00:51:59,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm with you.

642
00:51:59,743 --> 00:52:01,644
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like it's just a connectivity thing.

643
00:52:01,684 --> 00:52:04,705
[SPEAKER_05]: You look at Clark Street and where it is, and it's kind of got this weird curve.

644
00:52:04,765 --> 00:52:06,426
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not really connected to Withram Court.

645
00:52:07,967 --> 00:52:08,487
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's weird.

646
00:52:08,527 --> 00:52:10,247
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost like they didn't finish this chunk of the city.

647
00:52:11,723 --> 00:52:17,706
[SPEAKER_08]: I also like the idea of a handicap placard on George Street.

648
00:52:17,726 --> 00:52:28,230
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a lot of the residents on George Street would benefit from that area, and I don't think a 30-minute parking sign is beneficial for anybody on George Street.

649
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:32,372
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel that that would be a great area and spot for that as well.

650
00:52:32,392 --> 00:52:34,313
[SPEAKER_18]: I think at one time when that 30-minute

651
00:52:34,813 --> 00:52:36,474
[SPEAKER_08]: a candy store or something like that.

652
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:40,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, and it was a real estate building as well.

653
00:52:41,217 --> 00:52:42,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'd be okay with that.

654
00:52:42,218 --> 00:52:44,039
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to make that as a separate motion though.

655
00:52:44,059 --> 00:52:49,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't, I'd like to submit to the mayor's office and city council exactly what we would like for them to look at.

656
00:52:49,802 --> 00:52:54,845
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't necessarily think approval of a handicap spot on George is something they would need to look at.

657
00:52:55,486 --> 00:52:57,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, I agree.

658
00:52:57,807 --> 00:53:01,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I would make the first complicated motion

659
00:53:03,949 --> 00:53:07,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I'd make a 2nd motion on the handicap spot.

660
00:53:08,741 --> 00:53:11,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'll just have read it and if that's good, we'll make the motion.

661
00:53:13,108 --> 00:53:14,068
[SPEAKER_08]: for what you have?

662
00:53:14,188 --> 00:53:28,374
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not gonna be worded exactly right, but the increase in parking demand to review Wentworth Place for improvements for connectivity to Clark Street.

663
00:53:29,774 --> 00:53:35,496
[SPEAKER_18]: The handicapped spot on George Street, replacing a 30 minute parking space that's presently posted.

664
00:53:37,137 --> 00:53:40,358
[SPEAKER_18]: Have engineering look at the possibility of a crosswalk

665
00:53:42,867 --> 00:53:48,193
[SPEAKER_18]: on Martin at Winthrop Street.

666
00:53:48,533 --> 00:53:49,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to just break those up.

667
00:53:49,975 --> 00:53:56,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever needs to go to city council and the mayor's office, just include that, which I think would just be the Winthrop place.

668
00:53:56,161 --> 00:54:02,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Todd, do we need something to trigger your group to look at the potential for a crosswalk?

669
00:54:05,049 --> 00:54:11,372
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's like, I feel like sending something complicated to the mayor's office or the city council might bog this down.

670
00:54:11,992 --> 00:54:16,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think you said that, that, that keeping it simple, like each thing segregated.

671
00:54:16,495 --> 00:54:27,220
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, I think Tim's suggestion was the only thing to the mayor and the city council is to spend public money on a private way, like up to half, you know, that's, that's the focus.

672
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:28,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything else should be separate.

673
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:28,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

674
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:33,223
[SPEAKER_04]: So we could just clean that up to just be the first part to potentially.

675
00:54:34,573 --> 00:54:40,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Spend city resources and time to improve went through a place to provide connectivity to Clark street from 1 through.

676
00:54:42,096 --> 00:54:42,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, correct.

677
00:54:43,136 --> 00:54:44,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so that would that would be my motion.

678
00:54:45,277 --> 00:54:51,079
[SPEAKER_06]: I would suggest the word safety be included in there somewhere to improve safety and connectivity.

679
00:54:52,058 --> 00:54:57,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I think we have that first motion by Commissioner Brzezinski.

680
00:54:57,183 --> 00:54:58,585
[SPEAKER_08]: If we have a second for that.

681
00:54:58,705 --> 00:54:59,326
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll second it.

682
00:55:00,086 --> 00:55:02,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Commissioner Silva, roll call Alba for the.

683
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:04,391
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner McGibbon.

684
00:55:05,031 --> 00:55:05,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

685
00:55:05,792 --> 00:55:06,493
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner Hunt.

686
00:55:06,953 --> 00:55:07,194
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

687
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,096
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner Brzezinski.

688
00:55:09,116 --> 00:55:09,176
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

689
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,018
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner Silva.

690
00:55:11,604 --> 00:55:11,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

691
00:55:12,385 --> 00:55:13,325
[SPEAKER_18]: Lieutenant Canava.

692
00:55:13,486 --> 00:55:13,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

693
00:55:13,946 --> 00:55:14,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

694
00:55:14,306 --> 00:55:16,728
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we've passed that motion.

695
00:55:17,108 --> 00:55:26,376
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'd like to make a second motion to provide for a handicapped spot near the intersection of George Street at Winthrop.

696
00:55:26,396 --> 00:55:31,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Should be location to be replaced.

697
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,181
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we usually give it to?

698
00:55:33,441 --> 00:55:37,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we give it to Todd's office to determine location or Tim's office?

699
00:55:38,529 --> 00:55:45,431
[SPEAKER_05]: North side, do you want to rescind the 30-minute space and put it on the north side of George Street?

700
00:55:47,591 --> 00:55:47,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

701
00:55:47,851 --> 00:55:54,513
[SPEAKER_04]: So a motion to put a handicapped spot on the north side of George Street location to be determined by public works?

702
00:55:55,173 --> 00:55:57,553
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say it's the first available after the bus stop.

703
00:55:57,613 --> 00:56:00,214
[SPEAKER_06]: I can give you a dimension if you want it.

704
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:01,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

705
00:56:02,254 --> 00:56:05,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever gives you leeway to put it in the best spot.

706
00:56:08,702 --> 00:56:11,723
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like it'll just go in front of somebody's house that's there.

707
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:26,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it looks like about north side of George, about 73 feet east of Winthrop, which, as Alicia pointed out, is in front of number 175.

708
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:27,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Shouldn't they be notified?

709
00:56:36,017 --> 00:56:38,799
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's 30 minute park there, so we're not there.

710
00:56:39,879 --> 00:56:42,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Where was that 30 minute spot?

711
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:47,683
[SPEAKER_08]: 30 minute spot where Todd said is 73 feet east of Winthrop Street, in front of 175 George.

712
00:56:50,245 --> 00:56:54,187
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that motion was, are we good with that motion?

713
00:56:58,130 --> 00:57:01,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Commissioner Brzezinski, anybody second that motion?

714
00:57:02,431 --> 00:57:05,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Commissioner McGiven.

715
00:57:08,493 --> 00:57:09,293
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner McGiven?

716
00:57:10,494 --> 00:57:10,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

717
00:57:11,274 --> 00:57:12,034
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner Hunt?

718
00:57:12,654 --> 00:57:12,935
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

719
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:14,655
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

720
00:57:15,095 --> 00:57:15,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

721
00:57:16,536 --> 00:57:17,416
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner Silva?

722
00:57:17,876 --> 00:57:18,136
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

723
00:57:18,756 --> 00:57:19,717
[SPEAKER_18]: Lieutenant Canava?

724
00:57:20,357 --> 00:57:22,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, second motion is passed as well.

725
00:57:24,477 --> 00:57:36,824
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the last motion would be for Todd's group to visit the intersection of Martin at Winthrop to consider the implementation of a crosswalk.

726
00:57:37,405 --> 00:57:38,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that right?

727
00:57:39,946 --> 00:57:40,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

728
00:57:42,327 --> 00:57:42,888
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct.

729
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:47,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

730
00:57:47,871 --> 00:57:48,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

731
00:57:50,412 --> 00:57:50,932
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll second.

732
00:57:52,053 --> 00:57:53,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Commissioner Silva.

733
00:57:56,169 --> 00:57:57,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call when you're ready, Ella.

734
00:57:57,690 --> 00:57:58,571
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner McGibbon?

735
00:57:59,511 --> 00:57:59,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

736
00:58:00,712 --> 00:58:01,453
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner Hunt?

737
00:58:02,093 --> 00:58:02,373
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

738
00:58:03,094 --> 00:58:04,235
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

739
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:05,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

740
00:58:05,635 --> 00:58:06,496
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner Silva?

741
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:07,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

742
00:58:08,057 --> 00:58:08,918
[SPEAKER_18]: Lieutenant Canava?

743
00:58:09,198 --> 00:58:09,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

744
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:11,980
[SPEAKER_08]: And it seems all these have passed.

745
00:58:13,161 --> 00:58:16,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Commissioners, thank you for working through that and for the residents.

746
00:58:16,323 --> 00:58:19,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully the solution helps in the future.

747
00:58:22,067 --> 00:58:22,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, click in there.

748
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:29,923
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we're going to go back to 2025-60 Handicap Sign.

749
00:58:30,564 --> 00:58:37,949
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe Caitlin, are you speaking on behalf of the resident here at 71 Central Ave?

750
00:58:37,969 --> 00:58:40,210
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to ask you on mute if you are.

751
00:58:42,212 --> 00:58:42,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

752
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:43,513
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I am not.

753
00:58:44,113 --> 00:58:44,393
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

754
00:58:44,493 --> 00:58:44,833
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

755
00:58:45,094 --> 00:58:46,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a Catherine?

756
00:58:46,575 --> 00:58:47,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a Catherine here.

757
00:58:51,658 --> 00:58:54,340
[SPEAKER_09]: She said she could hear us, but we can't hear her.

758
00:58:55,927 --> 00:59:08,670
[SPEAKER_08]: The Catherine or John, if you guys are able to hear us, if you can type into the chat and or hit star six, nine, it should be able to make you raise your hand so that we can see.

759
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:14,251
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's just star nine to raise your hand and star six to unmute.

760
00:59:15,291 --> 00:59:21,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Star nine to raise your hand and star six to unmute and or type into the chat.

761
00:59:24,634 --> 00:59:33,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Once again, star nine to raise your hand, star six to unmute.

762
00:59:39,046 --> 00:59:42,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing in the chat, no.

763
00:59:42,548 --> 00:59:44,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

764
00:59:54,262 --> 00:59:55,342
[SPEAKER_08]: We will move on from this.

765
00:59:55,422 --> 00:59:58,303
[SPEAKER_08]: If something changes, we can come back to it.

766
00:59:58,643 --> 01:00:00,264
[SPEAKER_08]: We have other items to move forward to.

767
01:00:00,344 --> 01:00:03,844
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll move on to the parking variance.

768
01:00:03,904 --> 01:00:07,325
[SPEAKER_08]: I see Daniel here for 612 Main Street, 2025-63.

769
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:09,606
[SPEAKER_08]: I will ask you to unmute.

770
01:00:14,347 --> 01:00:15,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Good afternoon, commissioners.

771
01:00:16,427 --> 01:00:16,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Good afternoon.

772
01:00:17,628 --> 01:00:18,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for being here.

773
01:00:19,421 --> 01:00:22,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me and thanks for the opportunity to speak.

774
01:00:23,443 --> 01:00:31,326
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here to respectfully request a variance parking permit for Henry Street, adjacent to my new residence on 612 Main.

775
01:00:32,347 --> 01:00:40,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Reason being, while Main Street itself does not require a permit, I've encountered some challenges with evening parking availability.

776
01:00:40,951 --> 01:00:45,593
[SPEAKER_03]: This is compounded by nightly street cleaning restrictions.

777
01:00:46,855 --> 01:00:52,099
[SPEAKER_03]: which also further limits the parking and give Henry Street's proximity to the residents.

778
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I would appreciate the freedom to also park there.

779
01:01:00,186 --> 01:01:03,989
[SPEAKER_12]: First question is about parking driveway.

780
01:01:04,509 --> 01:01:06,491
[SPEAKER_12]: Why are you not parking on the property?

781
01:01:07,531 --> 01:01:09,433
[SPEAKER_03]: There is outdoor space in the back.

782
01:01:10,043 --> 01:01:11,143
[SPEAKER_03]: that could be used for parking.

783
01:01:13,124 --> 01:01:15,265
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, we would have to give up outdoor space.

784
01:01:15,285 --> 01:01:15,865
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one thing.

785
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:17,805
[SPEAKER_03]: The other is there's the two of us.

786
01:01:18,406 --> 01:01:19,746
[SPEAKER_03]: We need soon a second car.

787
01:01:19,886 --> 01:01:22,947
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's only one parking spot per residence.

788
01:01:23,087 --> 01:01:27,368
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's three residences, three apartments, and one parking spot for each.

789
01:01:30,529 --> 01:01:32,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Pulling it up on Google Maps right now.

790
01:01:34,711 --> 01:01:36,151
[SPEAKER_08]: So everyone is able to see.

791
01:01:43,725 --> 01:01:46,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'll just share it right now.

792
01:01:46,306 --> 01:01:48,167
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys all able to see that?

793
01:01:50,969 --> 01:01:52,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this your residence, Daniel?

794
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:54,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's the one.

795
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:56,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Used to be commercial space and they just flipped it.

796
01:01:58,033 --> 01:01:58,573
[SPEAKER_03]: So right here?

797
01:02:00,054 --> 01:02:01,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yeah, the store.

798
01:02:04,196 --> 01:02:05,357
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is your parking lot?

799
01:02:06,837 --> 01:02:06,997
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

800
01:02:08,838 --> 01:02:10,279
[SPEAKER_02]: That is sidewalk.

801
01:02:10,619 --> 01:02:11,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not allowed to park there.

802
01:02:13,395 --> 01:02:22,028
[SPEAKER_03]: No, in this alleyway here is this that's the driveway that leads to the parking in the back where we have one spot for each residence.

803
01:02:24,172 --> 01:02:25,133
[SPEAKER_08]: How many spots are back there? 3.

804
01:02:40,172 --> 01:02:50,523
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, when we look from above, it's a hardscaped backyard that looks like if it was commercial, was used for parking, but you're saying you're trying to use this open space now?

805
01:02:51,043 --> 01:02:53,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, ideally, we can use it for outdoor space.

806
01:02:56,589 --> 01:03:00,794
[SPEAKER_03]: And once we have a second car, then we would definitely need the variance.

807
01:03:15,623 --> 01:03:17,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Would it, excuse me, I missed it.

808
01:03:17,644 --> 01:03:18,784
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the variance for?

809
01:03:19,444 --> 01:03:24,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause for Henry street, main streets, unregulated right off front, right?

810
01:03:24,966 --> 01:03:25,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

811
01:03:26,026 --> 01:03:26,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

812
01:03:26,967 --> 01:03:36,950
[SPEAKER_03]: The challenges there in the evenings, um, past, let's say 8 PM, it's almost impossible to find the parking spot in close proximity.

813
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:44,312
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on Tuesdays, I think from 12 AM to 5 AM, there's street cleaning and it will have to move the car.

814
01:03:45,896 --> 01:03:51,500
[SPEAKER_06]: So you being the resident of Main Street, one option is you could petition for resident permit on Main Street.

815
01:03:52,481 --> 01:03:55,203
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that night situation may change.

816
01:03:55,843 --> 01:03:56,143
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

817
01:03:57,104 --> 01:03:57,805
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know that.

818
01:03:57,825 --> 01:03:59,026
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

819
01:03:59,126 --> 01:04:12,035
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the idea, though, what Todd means is to petition is that you would get more than half the residents on Main Street to sign a petition saying we want nighttime permit parking.

820
01:04:13,988 --> 01:04:19,330
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that I'm not clear that in a look, is this how commercial is this part of Main Street?

821
01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:23,931
[SPEAKER_12]: If we would do daytime permit parking on a commercial street.

822
01:04:25,372 --> 01:04:28,052
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm trying to see how far down.

823
01:04:30,213 --> 01:04:33,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we should be residential this area.

824
01:04:33,626 --> 01:04:35,907
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good point, Alicia, that there are options for that.

825
01:04:35,947 --> 01:04:47,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I think just like the block over on Medford Street, where they were, you know, the dental office, there was, you know, something like either two or three hour, except by permit type thing for the daytime to be sensitive.

826
01:04:50,066 --> 01:04:55,049
[SPEAKER_09]: I will mention also, I think in this area, he's one house from the Somerville line.

827
01:04:55,550 --> 01:05:04,815
[SPEAKER_09]: At night, the people in Somerville who are not participating in the resident parking program are parking on Main Street, creating a bottleneck there.

828
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:12,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Both Street is G Zone, which is across the street behind the building to the left from where we're looking currently.

829
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,620
[SPEAKER_09]: So it is creating a problem at night.

830
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:20,681
[SPEAKER_09]: You see that it's problematic with the parking, the summables spill over.

831
01:05:20,701 --> 01:05:30,184
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to mention that the situation on Henry Street is usually good.

832
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:35,265
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's always something free day and night on Henry Street, in my opinion.

833
01:05:35,605 --> 01:05:38,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I live on Edward Street right now, so I pass through there all the time.

834
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:58,672
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, just like with I'm sorry, Todd, just like with Martin, I checked the number of permits on Henry street and Henry street, I think has both side parking and is significantly more parking spaces than Martin.

835
01:05:58,752 --> 01:06:03,717
[SPEAKER_15]: And they've got a sixty two between visitor and resident on Henry street.

836
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:19,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I was just going to mention that this is why each street, Henry, whatever other street goes for permanent parking, because they're trying to displace some of the overflow from Maine or Somerville or whatever.

837
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:21,091
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just a domino effect.

838
01:06:21,171 --> 01:06:28,153
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, I think the Main Street, given Somerville, as Jim said, is people that don't have permits are going over here.

839
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:30,994
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be one of the potential course of action.

840
01:06:32,474 --> 01:06:42,461
[SPEAKER_06]: And possibly the commission, if it's up to them, if they'd consider instead of the whole length of Main Street, just maybe several blocks stretch even.

841
01:06:43,842 --> 01:06:47,864
[SPEAKER_12]: And this really plays into, I think we need to have a couple of different zones.

842
01:06:47,964 --> 01:06:56,810
[SPEAKER_12]: The original proposal had been to do one larger zone outside of the G zone, but like this end of South Medford should have a zone.

843
01:06:56,990 --> 01:07:00,552
[SPEAKER_12]: And then that other area that we were just discussing should have a zone.

844
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:04,391
[SPEAKER_12]: Clearly, they don't need to be part of the same zone that confuses people.

845
01:07:05,172 --> 01:07:11,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there was a study out of the planning office that had a draft of that as well.

846
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:17,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Something similar that had maybe four zones throughout some South Medford hillside.

847
01:07:17,437 --> 01:07:17,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

848
01:07:26,961 --> 01:07:27,401
[SPEAKER_12]: We should be.

849
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:32,262
[SPEAKER_12]: thinking about whether we want to resurface that and bring it back up.

850
01:07:32,442 --> 01:07:37,705
[SPEAKER_12]: That said, what are we doing about this one?

851
01:07:38,706 --> 01:07:44,389
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I do notice, I actually do have that map in front of me that shows all the various permit streets.

852
01:07:45,249 --> 01:07:48,391
[SPEAKER_12]: And there are a lot of permit streets in this area.

853
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:51,853
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure it is dealing with the Somerville overflow.

854
01:07:55,758 --> 01:08:00,679
[SPEAKER_12]: The only unregulated street around here is Dexter, and that's a long block up.

855
01:08:07,461 --> 01:08:12,983
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have any good solution for this resident other than their request to get a permit.

856
01:08:13,023 --> 01:08:17,424
[SPEAKER_12]: And the difference here, though, is that they actually do have allowed parking in front of their house.

857
01:08:18,004 --> 01:08:20,945
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just they can't even get at it because other people beat them to it.

858
01:08:25,056 --> 01:08:36,421
[SPEAKER_12]: As opposed to if there was no, I mean, to be clear, to parallel this to what we were talking about just before, if there was no parking on Main Street, the logical solution would be to give them a permit on Henry.

859
01:08:37,802 --> 01:08:42,104
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be, but in this case, there is parking on Main Street.

860
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:47,667
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why this is different from the previous situation.

861
01:08:49,131 --> 01:08:57,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we get the idea corroborated from our police force, maybe, the idea that Somerville folks are parking on this section of Main Street?

862
01:08:57,696 --> 01:09:05,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Because then, I mean, this guy's fighting them for a parking space on Main Street, and he's a resident of Medford.

863
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:07,401
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't need to cross any streets.

864
01:09:07,441 --> 01:09:08,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Henry Street has capacity.

865
01:09:08,802 --> 01:09:10,323
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what I'm hearing.

866
01:09:10,343 --> 01:09:11,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

867
01:09:13,204 --> 01:09:13,725
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.

868
01:09:13,845 --> 01:09:17,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Traffic Sergeant, are you guys familiar with this effect with Somerville?

869
01:09:18,628 --> 01:09:25,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we, I just tried to look up how many citations we have for this and this area.

870
01:09:25,674 --> 01:09:29,678
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a decent amount of spillover kind of like commissioner silver set up.

871
01:09:29,778 --> 01:09:29,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

872
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:40,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so it's a different set of reasons and Henry street has some capacity.

873
01:09:40,581 --> 01:09:52,164
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, I'd be okay with this, but I also, you know, it comes with an apprehension, um, to, you know, again, to move towards zone quicker sooner rather than later, as quick as we can.

874
01:09:52,184 --> 01:09:56,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess, would you, would that be a motion to approve?

875
01:09:58,305 --> 01:09:59,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I motion to approve it.

876
01:09:59,485 --> 01:09:59,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

877
01:09:59,766 --> 01:10:01,726
[SPEAKER_04]: How many is he asking for before we go forward?

878
01:10:02,686 --> 01:10:03,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

879
01:10:04,107 --> 01:10:05,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking on here.

880
01:10:10,136 --> 01:10:11,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Daniel, that's correct.

881
01:10:11,777 --> 01:10:12,858
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm interested.

882
01:10:12,878 --> 01:10:13,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you repeat the question?

883
01:10:13,779 --> 01:10:14,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Apologies.

884
01:10:14,559 --> 01:10:16,761
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just asking for one vehicle.

885
01:10:16,961 --> 01:10:17,501
[SPEAKER_03]: One vehicle.

886
01:10:17,541 --> 01:10:17,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

887
01:10:18,282 --> 01:10:20,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we have a second one that can park in the back.

888
01:10:21,344 --> 01:10:22,084
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll second.

889
01:10:23,906 --> 01:10:24,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Jim's second.

890
01:10:24,566 --> 01:10:25,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, good.

891
01:10:26,107 --> 01:10:26,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

892
01:10:26,908 --> 01:10:27,508
[SPEAKER_18]: Roll call, Alba.

893
01:10:28,028 --> 01:10:28,909
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner McGiven?

894
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:30,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

895
01:10:30,762 --> 01:10:31,482
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner Hunt.

896
01:10:31,882 --> 01:10:32,162
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

897
01:10:33,143 --> 01:10:34,303
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner Brzezinski.

898
01:10:34,703 --> 01:10:35,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

899
01:10:35,443 --> 01:10:36,404
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner Silva.

900
01:10:36,964 --> 01:10:37,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

901
01:10:37,724 --> 01:10:38,724
[SPEAKER_18]: Lieutenant Canava.

902
01:10:39,064 --> 01:10:39,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

903
01:10:39,664 --> 01:10:40,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passed.

904
01:10:41,005 --> 01:10:42,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, thank you.

905
01:10:48,307 --> 01:10:53,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Daniel, just, just give us some time and then you'll be able to go down to, uh, proof that parents.

906
01:10:55,529 --> 01:10:55,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.

907
01:10:55,869 --> 01:10:59,850
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'll send them a note and then I can, you can, uh,

908
01:11:00,866 --> 01:11:07,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Sarah, who's runs that department and is on this mission as well.

909
01:11:07,211 --> 01:11:11,275
[SPEAKER_08]: So in this meeting, so she'll just, Sarah, I don't know how much time you need for it, but.

910
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:12,620
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no.

911
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,600
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I know he's granted the variance.

912
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:15,881
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll put it on the variance list.

913
01:11:15,921 --> 01:11:19,742
[SPEAKER_15]: So even if I'm not in the office, the parking clerks will be able to help you out, Daniel.

914
01:11:20,502 --> 01:11:23,762
[SPEAKER_15]: They'll see your variances approved on our list of variances.

915
01:11:23,962 --> 01:11:25,383
[SPEAKER_15]: So you can stop by City Hall.

916
01:11:25,423 --> 01:11:29,143
[SPEAKER_15]: That is one, unfortunately, that you would have to stop by City Hall to obtain.

917
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:32,744
[SPEAKER_15]: But that's really the only hindrance at this point.

918
01:11:32,804 --> 01:11:34,404
[SPEAKER_15]: So whenever you want to stop by.

919
01:11:35,305 --> 01:11:35,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, everyone.

920
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:36,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

921
01:11:39,336 --> 01:11:48,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on to 2025-64, request to address permit parking issues on Porter Road from David Palermo, 12 Porter Road.

922
01:11:50,643 --> 01:12:04,833
[SPEAKER_08]: David, if you are here, you can raise your hand or enter in the chat or it's star six to unmute and star nine to raise your hand.

923
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:08,255
[SPEAKER_08]: David for Porter,

924
01:12:13,402 --> 01:12:16,303
[SPEAKER_08]: or if you're under another name, please let us know.

925
01:12:23,166 --> 01:12:26,127
[SPEAKER_18]: If no phone number on his request.

926
01:12:27,068 --> 01:12:30,149
[SPEAKER_08]: One last time here, David.

927
01:12:33,010 --> 01:12:35,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry Palermo for 12 Porter Road.

928
01:12:36,492 --> 01:12:41,974
[SPEAKER_08]: You're here, raise your hand or type in the chat if not, and you're calling from a audio number.

929
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:48,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Star six, I believe, is to unmute yourself.

930
01:12:48,283 --> 01:12:49,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Star nine is to raise your hand.

931
01:12:53,606 --> 01:12:59,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this, excuse me, is this for resident parking on Porter because it is already a resident parking street?

932
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:03,353
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion is request to address permit parking issues.

933
01:13:05,475 --> 01:13:05,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

934
01:13:08,757 --> 01:13:09,838
[SPEAKER_18]: This issue was

935
01:13:10,797 --> 01:13:19,701
[SPEAKER_18]: the issue with permit parking variances to the apartments, Bradley Road apartments for Porter Road.

936
01:13:21,122 --> 01:13:33,728
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just let me know that the issue was that you're bringing forward was that the variances that were granted for Bradley Road for Porter Road are causing an issue, I believe.

937
01:13:35,969 --> 01:13:39,330
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really think the commission can really make a request on this.

938
01:13:41,648 --> 01:13:43,208
[SPEAKER_08]: move on from this one.

939
01:13:43,308 --> 01:13:54,891
[SPEAKER_08]: If he is to come back before the end of the meeting, then we'd hear it, but I don't think that we can really make a motion or anything like that without hearing what his complaints are.

940
01:13:55,751 --> 01:13:58,132
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's move on to 2025-65.

941
01:13:58,232 --> 01:14:02,513
[SPEAKER_08]: One second.

942
01:14:02,733 --> 01:14:05,854
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a quick question for Todd.

943
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:08,354
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like 65 may be a little contentious.

944
01:14:08,514 --> 01:14:10,395
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like that was the majority of the people who are here.

945
01:14:11,770 --> 01:14:19,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Is Todd's a little quicker so we can get that out of the way and then leave the rest of the meeting to 65, or am I the only one thinking that?

946
01:14:20,473 --> 01:14:24,574
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

947
01:14:24,614 --> 01:14:32,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd motion to move 66 up just because it seems like a simple just approval, and that way we can leave the rest of the meeting to 65.

948
01:14:33,277 --> 01:14:35,317
[SPEAKER_04]: If no one supports that though, I'm fine as is.

949
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:37,118
[SPEAKER_04]: I second that.

950
01:14:38,042 --> 01:14:41,666
[SPEAKER_12]: Only as long as it's quick, I'm paying Brandon to be here through this whole meeting.

951
01:14:43,928 --> 01:14:46,570
[SPEAKER_04]: If it gets contentious, we'll shut it down.

952
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:47,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we don't need a roll call for that.

953
01:14:47,732 --> 01:14:52,316
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just going to move 2025-66 up in front of 65.

954
01:14:52,416 --> 01:14:59,543
[SPEAKER_08]: So Todd, you have the floor, crosswalk, daylighting, Placetet Road at Irving Street, all yours.

955
01:15:02,817 --> 01:15:04,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so this is it right here in the street view.

956
01:15:05,138 --> 01:15:09,379
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's the crosswalk that leads from the neighborhood to the communal station.

957
01:15:09,899 --> 01:15:15,720
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no parking after it, but before it, this commuter parking all the way up to the crosswalk.

958
01:15:16,041 --> 01:15:18,981
[SPEAKER_06]: So we just want a daylight like we've been doing elsewhere.

959
01:15:19,001 --> 01:15:29,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, in this case, I was recommended 30 feet in front of this crosswalk so that someone exiting the train station isn't blocked when they're trying to cross street by the park car.

960
01:15:32,017 --> 01:15:50,537
[SPEAKER_08]: If I could speak on this, we had a detail over here for at least a month for McCourt and multiple occasions somebody was crossing this area with a car parked up on against the crosswalk, nearly making it impossible to see the pedestrian trying to cross.

961
01:15:51,258 --> 01:15:52,179
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would highly

962
01:15:53,971 --> 01:16:04,153
[SPEAKER_08]: make a high recommendation for approval on this as it was near impossible with this area with construction and the amount of foot traffic that comes out of this area.

963
01:16:04,714 --> 01:16:10,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody has to almost come 10 feet outside and really be cautious of the surroundings.

964
01:16:10,955 --> 01:16:20,197
[SPEAKER_08]: If they're not from the area, it's near impossible to car park there to make a really safe crosswalk crossing stuff that helps start.

965
01:16:21,647 --> 01:16:23,169
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only the only question I have.

966
01:16:23,229 --> 01:16:26,233
[SPEAKER_04]: I know with the crosswalks on high street.

967
01:16:28,015 --> 01:16:39,368
[SPEAKER_04]: In front of governors, can you sometimes when the commercial vehicles park in those spots, it's still almost impossible to see the people is I mean, what's the largest you can make these.

968
01:16:42,247 --> 01:16:43,028
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good question.

969
01:16:43,048 --> 01:16:46,109
[SPEAKER_06]: 20 feet up, we've been operating as the minimum.

970
01:16:46,129 --> 01:16:47,809
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one car space typically.

971
01:16:48,669 --> 01:16:50,830
[SPEAKER_06]: In some cases, it does warrant more.

972
01:16:50,850 --> 01:16:52,291
[SPEAKER_06]: I was recommending 30.

973
01:16:52,911 --> 01:16:54,851
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought 30 would be enough here, but you could go

974
01:16:59,553 --> 01:17:08,927
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as 50 100, in some cases, but 20, just to be, as we just heard with other items, we're trying to balance the needs of on street parking too.

975
01:17:08,947 --> 01:17:13,614
[SPEAKER_06]: So, usually I'd start with the minimum or in less in this case, I recommend it more, but.

976
01:17:14,755 --> 01:17:22,257
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, once we have it situated and we have it painted and possibly even cones, then we could take it from there.

977
01:17:22,317 --> 01:17:24,337
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, you're right, Steve.

978
01:17:24,437 --> 01:17:29,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes that first car in this image, that the one that's still there, if it's a big vehicle, could still present a problem.

979
01:17:31,038 --> 01:17:35,479
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're trying to, again, balance the number of on-street spaces with all the need there is, right?

980
01:17:35,539 --> 01:17:39,220
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why we're trying to do this safety improvement.

981
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:42,981
[SPEAKER_06]: But then because of that, I just came up with the 30 I thought would be sufficient.

982
01:17:44,615 --> 01:17:46,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I would support that.

983
01:17:46,176 --> 01:17:53,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Because still, like I said, if the vehicle is tall, you still can't see him to the last minute, unfortunately.

984
01:17:53,598 --> 01:17:59,659
[SPEAKER_04]: I would support a motion just for the 30-foot buffer there.

985
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:01,540
Okay.

986
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:04,541
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll second.

987
01:18:05,941 --> 01:18:06,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

988
01:18:06,361 --> 01:18:07,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Second will be roll call vote.

989
01:18:08,222 --> 01:18:09,082
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner McGiven?

990
01:18:10,202 --> 01:18:10,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

991
01:18:11,042 --> 01:18:11,803
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner Hunt?

992
01:18:12,523 --> 01:18:12,723
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

993
01:18:13,798 --> 01:18:14,839
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

994
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:15,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

995
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:16,941
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner Silva?

996
01:18:17,702 --> 01:18:17,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

997
01:18:18,483 --> 01:18:19,324
[SPEAKER_18]: Lieutenant Canava?

998
01:18:19,924 --> 01:18:20,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

999
01:18:20,905 --> 01:18:21,966
[SPEAKER_08]: And this motion passes.

1000
01:18:24,429 --> 01:18:30,115
[SPEAKER_08]: And now we're going back to 2025-65 proposed on EV charging stations.

1001
01:18:31,196 --> 01:18:33,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Brandon Pike, Office of Planning and Development.

1002
01:18:33,619 --> 01:18:34,640
[SPEAKER_08]: The floor is yours.

1003
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:36,702
[SPEAKER_08]: You can unmute yourself as well.

1004
01:18:37,764 --> 01:18:38,044
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1005
01:18:38,184 --> 01:18:40,286
[SPEAKER_16]: And I can share my screen as well.

1006
01:18:40,346 --> 01:18:44,129
[SPEAKER_16]: So you can see the map of where we are talking about.

1007
01:18:45,651 --> 01:18:56,780
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so the city has received a state grant to install on street electric vehicle chargers, um, at various locations around the city.

1008
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:05,908
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, we did some outreach, um, including, um, a survey and, um,

1009
01:19:07,433 --> 01:19:17,600
[SPEAKER_16]: that we distributed online and in person at some events to pin down exactly where in the city we might want to do this.

1010
01:19:18,281 --> 01:19:20,862
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's how we narrowed into these five locations.

1011
01:19:22,604 --> 01:19:28,988
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's Cape and Park, Cummings Park, Berry Park, Magoon Park, and Morrison Park.

1012
01:19:29,569 --> 01:19:34,252
[SPEAKER_16]: And the park thinking is so that they wouldn't be located directly in front of somebody's house.

1013
01:19:35,493 --> 01:19:42,037
[SPEAKER_16]: that there would potentially be more room there.

1014
01:19:43,859 --> 01:19:53,104
[SPEAKER_16]: When we install these chargers to make the two parking spaces adjacent to the charger, EV only while charging.

1015
01:19:53,124 --> 01:20:03,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a cap on how long you can be there?

1016
01:20:07,009 --> 01:20:19,031
[SPEAKER_16]: So with the current EV chargers in city parking lots right now, there is not a cap on how long that you can be there.

1017
01:20:20,591 --> 01:20:32,913
[SPEAKER_16]: What we have done is the pricing for charging includes an extra charge if you're there for longer than four hours.

1018
01:20:33,233 --> 01:20:36,214
[SPEAKER_16]: So the pricing is sort of doing that job

1019
01:20:43,874 --> 01:20:51,195
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you park there 24 hours with the charger in your vehicle, do you have an idea what the charge would be?

1020
01:20:51,215 --> 01:20:53,216
[SPEAKER_04]: What the cost would be?

1021
01:20:53,236 --> 01:20:58,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, is the extra charging trying to prohibit you from being there?

1022
01:20:58,857 --> 01:21:03,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it affordable for me just to use this spot 24 hours a day just by plugging my vehicle in?

1023
01:21:04,478 --> 01:21:10,359
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, so if you're not charging, if you've already completed charging, so you're no longer charging, then you are

1024
01:21:13,343 --> 01:21:20,606
[SPEAKER_16]: You can be fined $50 according to the current rules for EV chargers.

1025
01:21:21,646 --> 01:21:22,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1026
01:21:23,307 --> 01:21:25,748
[SPEAKER_12]: Brenda, is the rate $1 an hour?

1027
01:21:26,608 --> 01:21:30,009
[SPEAKER_16]: The additional amount is $1 an hour after four hours.

1028
01:21:30,949 --> 01:21:32,610
[SPEAKER_12]: $1 an hour whether you're charging or not.

1029
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:33,170
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

1030
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:34,151
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

1031
01:21:34,351 --> 01:21:34,691
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

1032
01:21:35,091 --> 01:21:37,672
[SPEAKER_12]: I know I was part of approving that, but I didn't remember.

1033
01:21:40,459 --> 01:21:50,666
[SPEAKER_12]: So in theory, if you plugged your car in for 24 hours, you would get charged a minimum of $24 or no, $20, but you would get charged.

1034
01:21:50,826 --> 01:21:52,066
[SPEAKER_12]: So, so everybody is clear.

1035
01:21:52,086 --> 01:21:57,890
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the public is clear while you're plugged in, you get charged for the electricity.

1036
01:21:57,990 --> 01:22:00,272
[SPEAKER_12]: Like there's a charge for the rate you're getting.

1037
01:22:02,013 --> 01:22:02,993
[SPEAKER_12]: Your car is charging.

1038
01:22:06,235 --> 01:22:06,496
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1039
01:22:06,556 --> 01:22:08,637
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's 35 cents per kilowatt hour.

1040
01:22:09,208 --> 01:22:12,449
[SPEAKER_16]: And that $1 per hour after four hours is additional to that.

1041
01:22:19,902 --> 01:22:35,514
[SPEAKER_12]: So something that I might add, I know, I think that most of the members of the commission are familiar with this, but just as a general, just sort of for the record, there are different kinds of car charging and this is a level two charging.

1042
01:22:35,934 --> 01:22:38,176
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not what one would consider destination.

1043
01:22:38,216 --> 01:22:42,179
[SPEAKER_12]: As you can see from those green markers, the city already owns a lot of these around the city.

1044
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:48,003
[SPEAKER_12]: And there are private ones as well in a few places in this area and in Medford.

1045
01:22:48,846 --> 01:22:51,969
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so this is not something that would be considered a destination.

1046
01:22:51,989 --> 01:22:59,095
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, if you're looking for a charger of this speed, obviously, and you live in West Medford, you're not going to go down to Cape and park.

1047
01:22:59,115 --> 01:23:02,697
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to go over to the West Medford parking lot or the Brooks school, right?

1048
01:23:03,398 --> 01:23:07,021
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, there's high speed charging, high speed charging.

1049
01:23:07,602 --> 01:23:17,790
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, you can find right now in Medford at BJ's in the Wellington center Plaza, or you can go down to Somerville to assembly row, um, or you can go over to Arlington.

1050
01:23:18,538 --> 01:23:25,264
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's where somebody could charge their car in 20 minutes and get a couple of hundred miles on it.

1051
01:23:26,025 --> 01:23:29,688
[SPEAKER_12]: That is something that people put in their GPS and they search for those.

1052
01:23:29,869 --> 01:23:35,774
[SPEAKER_12]: And they, where, where can I find that within 15 or 20 minutes of my, of where I am?

1053
01:23:36,114 --> 01:23:40,018
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a neighborhood, this is intended to be a neighborhood situation.

1054
01:23:40,598 --> 01:23:40,899
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1055
01:23:40,939 --> 01:23:44,242
[SPEAKER_16]: For these level two chargers, the average,

1056
01:23:44,892 --> 01:23:48,315
[SPEAKER_16]: On average, people spend three to four hours charging at them.

1057
01:23:49,596 --> 01:23:54,640
[SPEAKER_16]: So it tends to be places where they're already going to be like at home or at work.

1058
01:23:55,861 --> 01:23:59,104
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not as appropriate for a commercial location.

1059
01:24:00,145 --> 01:24:09,533
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's why we think that these would be more likely to be used by residents of these neighborhoods who are probably going to use them more overnight or on weekends.

1060
01:24:16,270 --> 01:24:17,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we see the actual spots?

1061
01:24:18,412 --> 01:24:21,694
[SPEAKER_05]: And are these head-in spaces, or are we doing parallel spaces?

1062
01:24:23,616 --> 01:24:26,078
[SPEAKER_16]: So these are all parallel spaces.

1063
01:24:26,098 --> 01:24:28,600
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me zoom in on Morrison Park first.

1064
01:24:31,983 --> 01:24:36,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to read from the chat, Caitlin said, can you share which streets they would be located on?

1065
01:24:36,086 --> 01:24:38,128
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's kind of a question we're getting kind of.

1066
01:24:39,609 --> 01:24:41,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm drilling down on the spots themselves.

1067
01:24:44,556 --> 01:24:47,338
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep, so can you see the Morrison Park location here?

1068
01:24:47,359 --> 01:24:48,259
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep.

1069
01:24:49,821 --> 01:24:50,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1070
01:24:50,641 --> 01:24:58,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and just for the commission, I did assist Brenda, and we scoped it out with the vendor, each one of these locations.

1071
01:24:59,149 --> 01:25:07,596
[SPEAKER_06]: And as everyone knows, there's pros and cons with different locations, and these seem to rise to the top with the survey and the logistical capabilities.

1072
01:25:10,879 --> 01:25:11,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.

1073
01:25:17,218 --> 01:25:22,802
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, like, for this particular spot, you put the tower in between 2 parking spaces.

1074
01:25:24,123 --> 01:25:24,863
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, exactly.

1075
01:25:24,883 --> 01:25:25,904
[SPEAKER_16]: So they'd be parking.

1076
01:25:26,004 --> 01:25:30,307
[SPEAKER_16]: They'd be parallel parked there and the charger would be between the 2 of them.

1077
01:25:31,048 --> 01:25:31,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

1078
01:25:32,228 --> 01:25:34,310
[SPEAKER_05]: In the furniture zone of the sidewalk.

1079
01:25:36,563 --> 01:25:48,107
[SPEAKER_06]: So Tim, I'm working with DPW to stripe a line where the walkway would be next to the fence, in general, to keep cars away from parking right up to the fence.

1080
01:25:48,147 --> 01:25:51,268
[SPEAKER_06]: This is one of those locations where there's no sidewalk along that park.

1081
01:25:52,748 --> 01:25:55,089
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to stripe a double white line.

1082
01:25:55,809 --> 01:26:05,317
[SPEAKER_06]: To indicate a walkway, so that white man would be maybe pushed out 1 foot or so to accommodate the walkway and that's that's separate from this, but it would help.

1083
01:26:05,817 --> 01:26:08,960
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, define where the would go sure.

1084
01:26:11,902 --> 01:26:14,024
[SPEAKER_16]: Should I move on to the next park?

1085
01:26:14,044 --> 01:26:15,585
[SPEAKER_16]: So you can see that street too.

1086
01:26:16,826 --> 01:26:17,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1087
01:26:20,949 --> 01:26:24,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Who actually ends up owning the device or the facility, Brenda?

1088
01:26:25,391 --> 01:26:25,751
[SPEAKER_16]: We would.

1089
01:26:26,532 --> 01:26:27,092
[SPEAKER_05]: We would?

1090
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:27,552
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1091
01:26:30,894 --> 01:26:31,134
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep.

1092
01:26:31,174 --> 01:26:34,456
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is Pembroke Street next to Magoon Park.

1093
01:26:36,697 --> 01:26:37,537
[SPEAKER_16]: And it would be right here.

1094
01:26:41,419 --> 01:26:45,501
[SPEAKER_05]: And would your office manage the ownership of the devices?

1095
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:49,623
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, in the same way that we do for the existing city-owned chargers.

1096
01:26:54,881 --> 01:27:08,703
[SPEAKER_16]: And we have an EV charging revolving fund set up so that the fees, the charges that people pay to charge at the stations goes into a fund to maintain the stations.

1097
01:27:09,503 --> 01:27:10,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, wonderful.

1098
01:27:12,064 --> 01:27:12,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

1099
01:27:13,584 --> 01:27:14,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are really all my questions.

1100
01:27:16,165 --> 01:27:18,045
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I'll move on to the next part.

1101
01:27:20,676 --> 01:27:27,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you've been working with Todd, and we got some good layouts.

1102
01:27:27,982 --> 01:27:28,162
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep.

1103
01:27:28,502 --> 01:27:31,485
[SPEAKER_16]: So with Berry Park, this would be on College Ave.

1104
01:27:37,469 --> 01:27:43,714
[SPEAKER_16]: And as Todd mentioned, our considerations included technical considerations.

1105
01:27:43,774 --> 01:27:48,358
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we would have preferred to have this installed on Gurley over here.

1106
01:27:49,578 --> 01:27:53,741
[SPEAKER_16]: But that has single-phase power as does the street out here.

1107
01:27:53,861 --> 01:27:57,963
[SPEAKER_16]: So college was really the best option because that does have three-phase power.

1108
01:28:04,646 --> 01:28:06,467
[SPEAKER_16]: And then Cummings Park.

1109
01:28:10,329 --> 01:28:14,892
[SPEAKER_16]: It would be on Lyman Street on the side of the road next to the park.

1110
01:28:21,601 --> 01:28:32,145
[SPEAKER_16]: And then Capon would be directly in front of the park on Capon Street.

1111
01:28:46,830 --> 01:28:47,790
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's the five of them.

1112
01:28:49,239 --> 01:29:02,150
[SPEAKER_12]: Of all of these, I was just noticing Capen Street actually has permit parking, but I assume that we usually, when we have permit parking, the area in front of a park is not permit parking.

1113
01:29:05,393 --> 01:29:06,954
[SPEAKER_12]: I just kind of wanted to flag that.

1114
01:29:07,935 --> 01:29:09,216
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have the others.

1115
01:29:10,658 --> 01:29:12,900
[SPEAKER_12]: Cummings is not permit parking over there.

1116
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:15,242
[SPEAKER_12]: I would assume the others are not.

1117
01:29:17,455 --> 01:29:20,316
[SPEAKER_05]: But do the existing stations see a good amount of traffic?

1118
01:29:20,376 --> 01:29:21,677
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of traffic do they see?

1119
01:29:23,478 --> 01:29:24,078
[SPEAKER_16]: They do.

1120
01:29:24,218 --> 01:29:26,959
[SPEAKER_16]: It depends on where they're located.

1121
01:29:27,099 --> 01:29:33,902
[SPEAKER_16]: So there are some places like City Hall and the library that are almost constantly in use.

1122
01:29:36,343 --> 01:29:42,346
[SPEAKER_16]: But then there are other stations that see 30% to 50% usage.

1123
01:29:42,366 --> 01:29:46,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any projections for these?

1124
01:29:49,287 --> 01:30:04,379
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't, because we don't have a way to know exactly how many people with electric vehicles currently live in the neighborhood or would purchase electric vehicles if they had chargers nearby.

1125
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:16,448
[SPEAKER_16]: In the survey that we did, something like 32% of the respondents said that they didn't have electric vehicles, but they would get one if they had a charger nearby.

1126
01:30:17,363 --> 01:30:18,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, OK.

1127
01:30:20,245 --> 01:30:20,886
[SPEAKER_05]: It's promising.

1128
01:30:24,029 --> 01:30:26,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Brenda, I just answered someone in the chat.

1129
01:30:26,050 --> 01:30:30,234
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you confirm, it's saying, how many charging spots per location would be added?

1130
01:30:30,254 --> 01:30:31,255
[SPEAKER_06]: I said two.

1131
01:30:31,735 --> 01:30:33,737
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, that would be two at each location.

1132
01:30:38,601 --> 01:30:39,662
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a couple hands up.

1133
01:30:40,863 --> 01:30:44,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Brenda, if you're OK, if we have

1134
01:30:45,798 --> 01:30:50,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Opened it up to the public and they can ask some questions and answer them.

1135
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:50,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

1136
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:51,121
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're not.

1137
01:30:51,621 --> 01:30:52,441
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, absolutely.

1138
01:30:55,002 --> 01:30:56,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Christine, you have your hand raised.

1139
01:30:56,283 --> 01:30:57,344
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to ask you on mute.

1140
01:30:59,845 --> 01:31:02,366
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, so I'm a resident at Cape and street.

1141
01:31:02,386 --> 01:31:04,467
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually live directly across from Cape and park.

1142
01:31:05,757 --> 01:31:11,941
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of the items we constantly struggle with is speeding and cars racing down to the end.

1143
01:31:12,622 --> 01:31:21,488
[SPEAKER_13]: So the end of Cape and Park where the EV chargers would be, and inherently I'm not against EV chargers whatsoever, it's a dead end street.

1144
01:31:22,088 --> 01:31:30,834
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's six houses in the park from Hamilton, I'm sorry, Harold, to the end of the street.

1145
01:31:31,995 --> 01:31:38,040
[SPEAKER_13]: And as people use GPS, they're constantly getting directed to go to the end of the street and they can't cut through to Route 16.

1146
01:31:39,361 --> 01:31:42,743
[SPEAKER_13]: So a concern for us is the safety of the children and the playground.

1147
01:31:43,699 --> 01:31:48,902
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have added a second dead end street sign on either side now.

1148
01:31:49,842 --> 01:31:55,325
[SPEAKER_13]: So when you cross over onto that last section of Capen street, there's two dead end signs.

1149
01:31:56,166 --> 01:32:11,914
[SPEAKER_13]: So it most certainly has slowed down the traffic, but one of our concerns and one of the neighborhood concerns is, and I know you said to your point, you're not exactly sure what the traffic is gonna look like when these EV chargers get installed, but increasing traffic in that portion of the street,

1150
01:32:13,197 --> 01:32:21,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, because if they do anything like Googling, like, they do right now for directions, the traffic is horrendous and the speed that they go down those streets.

1151
01:32:22,807 --> 01:32:27,852
[SPEAKER_13]: They turn around at the very end our neighbor at the very end constantly they're turning around in his driveway.

1152
01:32:29,131 --> 01:32:30,252
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're coming back up.

1153
01:32:30,732 --> 01:32:34,155
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's our first concern is like, what does the traffic look like?

1154
01:32:34,355 --> 01:32:35,856
[SPEAKER_13]: If perhaps it does get put there.

1155
01:32:36,676 --> 01:32:40,619
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the second piece, I know Alicia just mentioned this is that it is permit parking.

1156
01:32:41,220 --> 01:32:47,784
[SPEAKER_13]: So another piece that we constantly struggle with is when people are at Cape and park, they're parking on the side of the street that is permit parking.

1157
01:32:48,705 --> 01:32:54,469
[SPEAKER_13]: So now if you take additional spaces away, they're going to continue to park on the permitted side.

1158
01:32:55,495 --> 01:33:03,041
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have difficulty finding parking spaces nearby without having to walk pretty far down the street.

1159
01:33:09,806 --> 01:33:18,093
[SPEAKER_12]: Todd and Tim, isn't there something that we can do about the maps, the GPS, that think that this is a cut through?

1160
01:33:18,113 --> 01:33:22,837
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm stunned that they haven't autocorrected themselves.

1161
01:33:23,634 --> 01:33:25,215
[SPEAKER_13]: So one of our, sorry, I don't mean to interrupt.

1162
01:33:25,275 --> 01:33:34,001
[SPEAKER_13]: One of our neighbors has reached out to, um, many different platforms and they continually still send people that way.

1163
01:33:34,361 --> 01:33:42,346
[SPEAKER_13]: So in a credit and a thank you to Medford for putting a second sign up that says dead end, because when it was on one side of the road, they weren't seeing it.

1164
01:33:42,566 --> 01:33:48,150
[SPEAKER_13]: Now that the dead end signs are on both sides of the street, at least it is backing some traffic.

1165
01:33:48,643 --> 01:33:55,025
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, down, but what they're doing is they're stopping short and they're immediately taking the turn so that they don't go fully down the street.

1166
01:33:55,965 --> 01:34:07,468
[SPEAKER_13]: But again, we, and we don't have any little ones in our house, but we are constantly seeing kids, you know, crossing the street, going to the park, there's afterschool programs, there's all sorts of stuff at the park.

1167
01:34:08,288 --> 01:34:14,069
[SPEAKER_13]: And just the thought of additional traffic coming down the street and for good purposes, don't get me wrong.

1168
01:34:14,609 --> 01:34:17,670
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, but the thought of just additional traffic coming down the street is,

1169
01:34:18,308 --> 01:34:22,789
[SPEAKER_13]: is somewhat disheartening, to put it any other way.

1170
01:34:24,970 --> 01:34:28,851
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would add, we did receive four comments specifically about this park.

1171
01:34:29,532 --> 01:34:31,792
[SPEAKER_16]: Two of them were supportive of it.

1172
01:34:33,113 --> 01:34:36,174
[SPEAKER_16]: And one person had said that there was usually plenty of open parking.

1173
01:34:36,594 --> 01:34:39,155
[SPEAKER_16]: And then two were not supportive of it.

1174
01:34:39,275 --> 01:34:46,837
[SPEAKER_16]: And one of them was the person at the end of the dead end street who said that people tend to turn around in his driveway.

1175
01:34:47,799 --> 01:34:48,520
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, it's constant.

1176
01:34:50,021 --> 01:34:53,805
[SPEAKER_13]: Within an hour, you could get 15 cars turning around.

1177
01:34:53,825 --> 01:35:04,616
[SPEAKER_13]: And to your point, right where that marker is, where it shows where it is, that's actually my car right there, sitting right in front of where that marker is.

1178
01:35:04,936 --> 01:35:07,458
[SPEAKER_13]: Because earlier in the day, there was no parking.

1179
01:35:07,559 --> 01:35:11,943
[SPEAKER_13]: So I park on that side if I can't get parking across from my street, my house.

1180
01:35:16,146 --> 01:35:18,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this is Todd Blake.

1181
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:27,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I'm glad the dead ends are helping a little bit, but it doesn't seem like the extra sign's doing more than that, but at least it's something.

1182
01:35:27,576 --> 01:35:31,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if this street were designed today, it wouldn't be designed as a dead end like that.

1183
01:35:31,739 --> 01:35:35,763
[SPEAKER_06]: It would have either a cul-de-sac or at the very least a hammerhead to be able to turn around.

1184
01:35:36,363 --> 01:35:39,788
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is what ends up happening when it wasn't designed properly.

1185
01:35:40,169 --> 01:35:41,611
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't just exist in Medford.

1186
01:35:41,631 --> 01:35:43,854
[SPEAKER_06]: It exists in other cities, unfortunately, too.

1187
01:35:44,495 --> 01:35:51,345
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do feel for the person at the end, each house at the end, that the driveways are used as hammerheads to turn around.

1188
01:35:54,343 --> 01:35:59,925
[SPEAKER_06]: So we could continue to try to work with the community to improve the situation as best we can.

1189
01:36:01,045 --> 01:36:05,126
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know how that factors into the current proposal or not.

1190
01:36:05,166 --> 01:36:07,667
[SPEAKER_06]: But we definitely hear your concerns about that.

1191
01:36:07,727 --> 01:36:09,048
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll continue to try.

1192
01:36:09,108 --> 01:36:11,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we'll try larger signs or something like that.

1193
01:36:11,769 --> 01:36:13,309
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll definitely try.

1194
01:36:13,469 --> 01:36:13,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1195
01:36:14,169 --> 01:36:19,031
[SPEAKER_08]: We could use one of those message boards over there, maybe midway up.

1196
01:36:20,051 --> 01:36:21,552
[SPEAKER_08]: They're a lot larger and kind of

1197
01:36:23,761 --> 01:36:31,846
[SPEAKER_08]: definitely should alleviate some of the issues, not make it perfect, but... Put it by Harris Road, maybe?

1198
01:36:31,867 --> 01:36:36,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we could put it by Harris Road, if you think that, Christine, if you think that would be a good location.

1199
01:36:36,630 --> 01:36:38,251
[SPEAKER_08]: These message boards are pretty large.

1200
01:36:38,271 --> 01:36:41,993
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think... Very, very unnoticeable.

1201
01:36:43,074 --> 01:36:48,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, very noticeable that the drivers should hopefully get the hint.

1202
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:56,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and again, I totally appreciate that you don't know how much this is going to bring in people that come to the street.

1203
01:36:57,024 --> 01:37:02,969
[SPEAKER_13]: But just the idea of more traffic on the street is of concern.

1204
01:37:06,051 --> 01:37:06,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1205
01:37:07,092 --> 01:37:07,492
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1206
01:37:08,633 --> 01:37:17,100
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, if we could just see if there's anybody else that has a comment.

1207
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:19,201
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought the 391 was at 5.

1208
01:37:25,219 --> 01:37:27,320
[SPEAKER_08]: or all of this, I'm just going to ask them to unmute.

1209
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:33,361
[SPEAKER_08]: 37813674961, are you here for this 2025-65 EV charting station?

1210
01:37:33,401 --> 01:37:33,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, this is 3674961.

1211
01:37:33,941 --> 01:37:34,821
[SPEAKER_08]: I am talking about Cummings Park.

1212
01:37:51,811 --> 01:37:55,852
[SPEAKER_11]: And I am not opposed to having EV stations.

1213
01:37:55,912 --> 01:38:08,815
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I think having them on Lima Nav, as you've been talking about, there's very limited parking in the neighborhood, especially in this hillside neighborhood and the streets surrounding it.

1214
01:38:08,855 --> 01:38:10,036
[SPEAKER_11]: I live on Cotting Street.

1215
01:38:11,136 --> 01:38:19,138
[SPEAKER_11]: And to specifically put two parking spaces for an EV vehicle to use.

1216
01:38:20,103 --> 01:38:28,665
[SPEAKER_11]: When I'm sure you didn't come to this neighborhood and find out how many people had EV cars, it will take away valuable parking.

1217
01:38:28,865 --> 01:38:42,868
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so congested that if I have more than three people come over and each one takes a car to come to my house for some gathering, they have to park down at Whole Foods because there's no parking at all.

1218
01:38:43,388 --> 01:38:45,949
[SPEAKER_11]: My neighbor has six cars on her second floor.

1219
01:38:47,189 --> 01:38:48,290
[SPEAKER_11]: and three on the bottom.

1220
01:38:48,450 --> 01:38:50,551
[SPEAKER_11]: I have four cars myself already.

1221
01:38:50,571 --> 01:39:04,857
[SPEAKER_11]: To specifically make these spaces for EV cars to use when the majority of cars on the road in this neighborhood are gas or maybe hybrid.

1222
01:39:04,937 --> 01:39:12,080
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if you were to put them an alternative within a couple of blocks away is Whole Foods are at the,

1223
01:39:13,827 --> 01:39:19,229
[SPEAKER_11]: the part of Auburn Street that has no cars that you can put them there.

1224
01:39:19,669 --> 01:39:26,131
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that would be convenient because then it's near a place, a business.

1225
01:39:26,651 --> 01:39:28,332
[SPEAKER_11]: They could be short-term charges.

1226
01:39:28,892 --> 01:39:30,693
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't need to be long-term.

1227
01:39:30,713 --> 01:39:39,396
[SPEAKER_11]: Then another concern is that in the wintertime, we had odd and even parking on the streets.

1228
01:39:40,056 --> 01:39:42,517
[SPEAKER_11]: If they're on the odd side,

1229
01:39:43,685 --> 01:39:47,413
[SPEAKER_11]: and then it's the even side to park on, who's going to shovel them?

1230
01:39:47,433 --> 01:39:49,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that make sense?

1231
01:39:49,438 --> 01:39:50,300
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't make sense.

1232
01:39:51,102 --> 01:39:55,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus, there's only one side parking on Conning Street, which makes it difficult.

1233
01:39:55,471 --> 01:39:59,741
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been that way for 69 years I've lived here.

1234
01:40:00,502 --> 01:40:02,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I said, I don't think it's feasible.
