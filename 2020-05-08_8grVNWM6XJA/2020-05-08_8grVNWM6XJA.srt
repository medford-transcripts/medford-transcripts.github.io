1
00:00:07,398 --> 00:00:11,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, welcome to the Andrews virtual open house.

2
00:00:12,284 --> 00:00:13,845
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize for the delay.

3
00:00:14,426 --> 00:00:20,253
[SPEAKER_02]: As you know, we are trying to work our way through a new technology to do the virtual open house.

4
00:00:20,613 --> 00:00:22,095
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thank you for your patience.

5
00:00:22,776 --> 00:00:27,561
[SPEAKER_02]: I know many of you are excited to come to the Andrews and we are excited to have you as well.

6
00:00:28,422 --> 00:00:37,052
[SPEAKER_02]: So before I begin the presentation for tonight, I just want to say a few thank yous to some special people who have helped me prepare for this.

7
00:00:37,752 --> 00:00:42,958
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, Dr. Peter Cushing, who is working behind the scenes tonight for our broadcast.

8
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent for helping me make the video.

9
00:00:47,665 --> 00:01:03,588
[SPEAKER_02]: miss sarah grant who also put a video together with staff and students that you will see later on miss abramian for her help with the national junior honor society miss bandoian and the ccs are and then tonight we have some panelists of some teachers

10
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:07,531
[SPEAKER_02]: and guidance Councilors and the assistant principal of the Andrews.

11
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:10,553
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Mr. D. Clemente from 6A.

12
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:11,474
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Ms.

13
00:01:11,534 --> 00:01:12,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Bruce from 6B.

14
00:01:13,495 --> 00:01:14,015
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Ms.

15
00:01:14,035 --> 00:01:17,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Santos who is our guidance Councilor for the A side.

16
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:25,743
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Mr. Maidment who is part of our exploratory team and teaches physical education and our assistant principal, Ms.

17
00:01:25,903 --> 00:01:27,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Julia McEwen.

18
00:01:27,704 --> 00:01:30,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to thank Mr. Jack Dempsey

19
00:01:30,646 --> 00:01:34,928
[SPEAKER_02]: who produced the opening video that you will see in some time.

20
00:01:34,948 --> 00:01:38,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I also wanna thank the assistant superintendent, Ms.

21
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Diane Caldwell, the Andrews teachers, Ms.

22
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:44,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnson, my secretary, and of course the custodians.

23
00:01:44,732 --> 00:01:49,174
[SPEAKER_02]: As you will see in the video, our building is very clean day in and day out.

24
00:01:49,674 --> 00:01:55,417
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course we couldn't do any of this without the help and the support of the Medford Public Schools School Committee.

25
00:01:57,711 --> 00:02:04,615
[SPEAKER_02]: So just before we start, I want to share with you the core values of the Andrews Middle School.

26
00:02:05,015 --> 00:02:10,538
[SPEAKER_02]: The core values of the Andrews Middle School is excellence, the responsibility and respect.

27
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:15,436
[SPEAKER_02]: that will be posted throughout the building, and it's something that you will hear.

28
00:02:15,716 --> 00:02:19,779
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also in our handbook that you will receive this summer.

29
00:02:20,339 --> 00:02:23,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, excellence through responsibility and respect.

30
00:02:23,861 --> 00:02:27,744
[SPEAKER_02]: We expect our students to try to do their best in school and out of school.

31
00:02:28,324 --> 00:02:29,985
[SPEAKER_02]: We ask that they be responsible.

32
00:02:30,486 --> 00:02:41,073
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, we always want them to show respect, not only to the teachers, but their peers, themselves, and of course, those at home who take care of them each and every day.

33
00:02:42,153 --> 00:02:51,075
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you see me sitting in my home studio, I use that term loosely, studio, you will see behind me, if you may, is a picture.

34
00:02:51,335 --> 00:02:56,037
[SPEAKER_02]: That picture represents my 20 years of military service.

35
00:02:56,077 --> 00:03:05,119
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is something that is unique for me as an administrator in public schools, as I am a retired captain of the United States Air Force.

36
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,179
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you will see that in my office.

37
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,101
[SPEAKER_02]: And oftentimes, you'll notice that my hair is much shorter than it is right now.

38
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:17,201
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do our best.

39
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:24,003
[SPEAKER_02]: So before I keep continuing with that, I do want to start with a video that will show you around the Andrews.

40
00:03:24,023 --> 00:03:29,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know many of you sixth graders are very excited to see what the Andrews looks like on the inside.

41
00:03:29,424 --> 00:03:30,624
[SPEAKER_25]: So here comes the video.

42
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:45,837
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello everyone.

43
00:03:46,557 --> 00:03:53,880
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm the superintendent of schools Dr. Edouard-Vincent and I welcome all of you to the Andrews Middle School.

44
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:02,342
[SPEAKER_23]: This is a wonderful school and right now I am standing in front of the portrait of the namesake Miss Madeline Duggar Andrews.

45
00:04:02,882 --> 00:04:05,963
[SPEAKER_23]: She was the first African-American elected official

46
00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:07,017
[SPEAKER_23]: in Medford.

47
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:14,162
[SPEAKER_23]: And by chance, I am the first African-American superintendent of schools for Medford Public Schools.

48
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:20,186
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm so happy to be here today and share this orientation with you.

49
00:04:20,646 --> 00:04:26,910
[SPEAKER_23]: You're going to have a lot of wonderful things happening here at the Andrew School, a lot to learn, excited teachers.

50
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:32,414
[SPEAKER_23]: And as you go on this virtual tour, you're going to be excited about coming here next year.

51
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:33,074
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

52
00:04:35,322 --> 00:04:36,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Andrews.

53
00:04:36,603 --> 00:04:37,784
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Mike Downs.

54
00:04:37,864 --> 00:04:38,824
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the principal here.

55
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:39,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on in.

56
00:04:42,187 --> 00:04:46,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that you're inside the building, right over here is the main office.

57
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:54,355
[SPEAKER_02]: The other place that you might need to come to in the morning is over here to our cafetorium and to over here into our gym.

58
00:04:59,943 --> 00:05:01,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to our gym.

59
00:05:01,304 --> 00:05:06,068
[SPEAKER_02]: As you saw, we have a sign that says, Andrews, excellence through responsibility and respect.

60
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:07,590
[SPEAKER_02]: So come on into our gym.

61
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:22,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in the morning, you can hang out in here and you can shoot baskets or just hang out with your friends.

62
00:05:22,546 --> 00:05:27,753
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also have some great PE classes that go on here.

63
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:32,559
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you can see, we play hard, we play fair, we play safe.

64
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:44,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, we are also part of the GBL, and this is where you'll have your home basketball games, which this year were fantastic.

65
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:47,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Both our boys and our girls made it to the finals this year.

66
00:05:48,386 --> 00:05:51,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, this is where we have some of our after school activities.

67
00:05:52,188 --> 00:05:56,851
[SPEAKER_02]: The favorite one that everybody loves at the Andrews is Mr. Zizzo's dodgeball.

68
00:05:57,171 --> 00:06:02,014
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more activities than that, of course, but that is the number one club that we do have here at the Andrews.

69
00:06:02,354 --> 00:06:03,975
[SPEAKER_02]: So welcome to our gymnasium.

70
00:06:04,395 --> 00:06:05,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's go to our cafeteria.

71
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:12,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to our cafeteria.

72
00:06:12,814 --> 00:06:14,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is where you would come in the morning as well.

73
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:19,255
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the great things about Medford Public Schools is that we offer free breakfast.

74
00:06:19,615 --> 00:06:24,996
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you come to school, make sure you take advantage of our breakfast, but also remember to pick up after yourself.

75
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, this is where you're gonna have your lunch.

76
00:06:28,117 --> 00:06:36,239
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we have great presentations throughout the year, you'll come in here and our presenters will be up here on the stage.

77
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:38,179
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our cafeteria, again,

78
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:46,612
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great space, not only for food and for presentations, but a lot of students like to hang out here after school and do work together.

79
00:06:46,632 --> 00:06:49,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, always do your schoolwork whenever you can.

80
00:06:56,174 --> 00:07:05,956
[SPEAKER_02]: In the morning, when the bell rings, what happens is you either leave the couch or the gym and you go to your side or your team, which is straight this way.

81
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,196
[SPEAKER_02]: A side will be up here.

82
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,509
[SPEAKER_02]: and B side will be over there.

83
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:16,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, you're on either A side or B side in the sixth grade, and you're on the third floor.

84
00:07:19,735 --> 00:07:24,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is our main stairway when you go up to your classes for sixth grade.

85
00:07:24,258 --> 00:07:34,864
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the only stairway that we use here at the Andrews, but just to give you a layout of the building, on this side is eighth grade classrooms, and same for over here.

86
00:07:51,752 --> 00:07:56,015
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we have some other things on this side that you may want to be aware of.

87
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,336
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, our elevator is right here.

88
00:07:58,356 --> 00:08:02,739
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have our tech lab.

89
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:05,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Tech lab is part of our exploratory rotation.

90
00:08:06,281 --> 00:08:07,242
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great class.

91
00:08:07,622 --> 00:08:09,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost every student loves it.

92
00:08:09,183 --> 00:08:10,184
[SPEAKER_02]: So come on this way.

93
00:08:16,223 --> 00:08:17,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to our Tech Lab.

94
00:08:17,884 --> 00:08:20,166
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can tell, there's lots of things that go on here.

95
00:08:20,246 --> 00:08:22,248
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, you can make rockets.

96
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:25,070
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use woodworking materials.

97
00:08:25,591 --> 00:08:26,752
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have computers.

98
00:08:27,332 --> 00:08:31,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, Tech Lab has science and technology and engineering.

99
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:35,419
[SPEAKER_02]: It is for every student of every kind with every interest for our building.

100
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me show you some of the examples of some of the things that they build in Tech Lab.

101
00:08:39,222 --> 00:08:40,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some great examples.

102
00:08:40,783 --> 00:08:42,545
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, some rockets are down here.

103
00:08:43,171 --> 00:08:48,556
[SPEAKER_02]: some bridges, which not only are they beautiful to look at, but there's also some engineering applications.

104
00:08:49,216 --> 00:08:50,837
[SPEAKER_02]: And over here, we have some more bridges.

105
00:08:51,338 --> 00:08:55,521
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the best products that we do this year is we do this with the popsicle sticks.

106
00:08:56,022 --> 00:09:00,145
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to make a bridge with popsicle sticks and see how much weight it can hold.

107
00:09:00,726 --> 00:09:05,189
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, that's one of the favorite projects during the year, and welcome to technology.

108
00:09:07,892 --> 00:09:10,614
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just left the cafeteria or the gymnasium.

109
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:15,173
[SPEAKER_02]: And right across the hall from the technology lab is our nurse's office.

110
00:09:15,673 --> 00:09:21,699
[SPEAKER_02]: If for some reason you're not feeling well or you have some medications that need to be dropped off, please bring them to our nurse.

111
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:31,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, now I'd like to show you some of our outdoor facilities that we have here at the Andrews.

112
00:09:32,412 --> 00:09:38,599
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can tell, we have this ginormous, that's one of the terms that students here like to use, outdoor play area.

113
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:50,052
[SPEAKER_02]: This area is for our recess, for our physical education classes, we do soccer out here, we have running out here, our cross-country practice is out here.

114
00:09:50,072 --> 00:09:52,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, look at how great this space is for us.

115
00:09:54,775 --> 00:10:00,517
[SPEAKER_02]: We have over here, we have a softball field, and a little further over, we have a baseball field.

116
00:10:00,938 --> 00:10:04,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, those are utilized by our physical education classes.

117
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:09,481
[SPEAKER_02]: And right around the corner, in front of the school, is our basketball court.

118
00:10:09,921 --> 00:10:15,844
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the great things about when you come to the Andrews is these outdoor facilities that we're able to offer you.

119
00:10:18,058 --> 00:10:29,521
[SPEAKER_02]: As I mentioned earlier, we have a great basketball court in not only our physical education classes, but also for recess on those days when it's raining a little bit or there's snow on the ground.

120
00:10:29,961 --> 00:10:35,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I want to also show you our baseball field right over here.

121
00:10:36,522 --> 00:10:38,963
[SPEAKER_02]: And then right over there is our softball field.

122
00:10:39,163 --> 00:10:43,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is part of our great athletic complex that we offer here at the end.

123
00:10:46,817 --> 00:10:48,799
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we are on the second floor.

124
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:52,802
[SPEAKER_02]: To my right is the A side for grade seven.

125
00:10:55,283 --> 00:10:58,366
[SPEAKER_02]: To my left is the B side for seventh grade.

126
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:05,311
[SPEAKER_02]: However, even as a sixth grader, you have some great opportunities here at the Andrews on the second floor.

127
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:06,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Come, I'll show you.

128
00:11:14,978 --> 00:11:15,159
Eight.

129
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:23,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to our band and orchestra room.

130
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:28,290
[SPEAKER_02]: We are so fortunate here at the Andrews to have outstanding teachers, Ms.

131
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Chang and Ms.

132
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Baptiste.

133
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:38,537
[SPEAKER_02]: They are both great teachers and both our band and our orchestra perform during the year and they are absolutely fantastic.

134
00:11:39,038 --> 00:11:41,359
[SPEAKER_02]: This is room 202 of the Andrews.

135
00:11:46,823 --> 00:11:48,645
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our talent show each year.

136
00:11:49,036 --> 00:11:51,398
[SPEAKER_02]: which highlights the great talents of many of our students.

137
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,599
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our musical every year.

138
00:11:53,619 --> 00:11:56,702
[SPEAKER_02]: This is done by Miss Grant, whose room you'll see soon.

139
00:11:57,102 --> 00:12:00,564
[SPEAKER_02]: This musical that she puts on every year is absolutely fantastic.

140
00:12:01,645 --> 00:12:04,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some more examples of our other talent show we had.

141
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:09,531
[SPEAKER_02]: And over here, we like to highlight student work throughout the year.

142
00:12:10,852 --> 00:12:13,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're gonna visit Miss Grant's room, room 204.

143
00:12:13,654 --> 00:12:16,416
[SPEAKER_02]: She is our music teacher as part of our exploratory class.

144
00:12:18,444 --> 00:12:19,025
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Ms.

145
00:12:19,065 --> 00:12:19,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Grant's room again.

146
00:12:20,526 --> 00:12:23,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Look behind me and you'll see several types of instruments.

147
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:34,018
[SPEAKER_02]: While in this exploratory, you're not only going to learn how to read music and play different instruments, but the most important part of this music class will teach you the Andrews song.

148
00:12:34,358 --> 00:12:38,562
[SPEAKER_02]: So by the end of your sixth grade year, I expect you to know the song by heart.

149
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:40,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to our library.

150
00:12:40,951 --> 00:12:44,112
[SPEAKER_02]: So this space is a great space for all students.

151
00:12:44,552 --> 00:12:46,413
[SPEAKER_02]: You can come here in the morning before school.

152
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:47,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to Miss Williams.

153
00:12:47,953 --> 00:12:49,393
[SPEAKER_02]: You can come here during lunch.

154
00:12:49,693 --> 00:12:51,434
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to get a pass from your teacher.

155
00:12:51,774 --> 00:12:53,314
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can even come here after school.

156
00:12:53,354 --> 00:12:55,255
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a collaboration space over here.

157
00:12:55,755 --> 00:12:57,875
[SPEAKER_02]: We have computers for you to do research.

158
00:12:58,276 --> 00:13:00,076
[SPEAKER_02]: We have breakout spaces for you.

159
00:13:00,623 --> 00:13:03,604
[SPEAKER_02]: to read books that you may never have heard of before.

160
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:08,246
[SPEAKER_02]: But remember, the key is that you read each and every day.

161
00:13:08,586 --> 00:13:14,168
[SPEAKER_02]: When I walk into your English class, I will ask you, what book are you currently reading other than your English book?

162
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:17,029
[SPEAKER_02]: And I expect something of an answer from you.

163
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:19,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of your exploratory blocks is foreign language.

164
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,151
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, right now, we are in a Spanish room.

165
00:13:23,472 --> 00:13:25,112
[SPEAKER_02]: We also offer Italian.

166
00:13:25,632 --> 00:13:30,034
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I hope that while you're at the Andrews, you'll take advantage of this great opportunity.

167
00:13:35,683 --> 00:13:37,404
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we are in a science room.

168
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:39,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, we're in Mr. Prowson's science room.

169
00:13:39,525 --> 00:13:44,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Now he won't be one of your teachers next year, but as you can tell, this is a great place to learn.

170
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:48,850
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that Mr. Prowson has is a Chromebook cart in his room.

171
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:56,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Here at the Andrews, we have nine Chromebook carts, one for each team and three for anyone else that may need one on that particular day.

172
00:13:57,414 --> 00:14:03,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very proud of the fact that we have nine Chromebook carts to support teaching and learning through the use of technology.

173
00:14:04,617 --> 00:14:07,179
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see Mr. Carlson has a lot going on here.

174
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:09,341
[SPEAKER_02]: He has a water experiment over there.

175
00:14:09,801 --> 00:14:11,222
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got all kinds of science equipment.

176
00:14:12,063 --> 00:14:13,744
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a grinder for homework.

177
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:17,827
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to give you a highlight of his science at the Andrews.

178
00:14:29,476 --> 00:14:30,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Miss Pousa's room.

179
00:14:31,077 --> 00:14:33,939
[SPEAKER_02]: She is one of the sixth grade teachers on Aside

180
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:38,240
[SPEAKER_02]: for English, and today I'm sitting in one of her director chairs.

181
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,421
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can tell, Mrs. Booth has lots of student work on her walls.

182
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:45,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is Mrs. Booth's English class.

183
00:14:46,103 --> 00:14:51,705
[SPEAKER_26]: Here we go.

184
00:14:57,987 --> 00:15:01,488
[SPEAKER_02]: The next classroom we're going to visit is Mr. Gallagher's art class.

185
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:02,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Here are some examples.

186
00:15:03,447 --> 00:15:06,328
[SPEAKER_02]: of some of the work that students have done in the years past.

187
00:15:06,388 --> 00:15:08,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Mr. Gallagher's art room.

188
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:08,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on in.

189
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:16,512
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see some of the activities that he does and some of his beliefs when it comes to art.

190
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:23,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Observe, envision, engage, explore, craft, express, reflect, and understand.

191
00:15:23,754 --> 00:15:31,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some examples of student work here at the Andrews, including, of course, our art way as you walk in.

192
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,440
[SPEAKER_02]: So earlier, I mentioned that we have nine Chromebook carts.

193
00:15:37,781 --> 00:15:39,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven of them are less than a year old.

194
00:15:40,381 --> 00:15:43,122
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also have a great computer lab where Ms.

195
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:48,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Coralie Bacon will teach you everything from coding and basic technology using the computer.

196
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:52,303
[SPEAKER_02]: The computers that you see here today are brand new.

197
00:15:52,603 --> 00:15:58,905
[SPEAKER_02]: We just got these computers about two months ago, and they are here for you when you come to the Andrews.

198
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,745
[SPEAKER_02]: The nurse's office, their office

199
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:03,963
[SPEAKER_02]: and Ms.

200
00:16:03,983 --> 00:16:04,143
[SPEAKER_02]: St.

201
00:16:04,204 --> 00:16:05,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Phyllis is right here.

202
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:08,267
[SPEAKER_02]: They are here to help you during your time at the ambulance.

203
00:16:23,046 --> 00:16:23,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

204
00:16:23,927 --> 00:16:26,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for your time and watching that video.

205
00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:29,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you again, Mr. Dempsey for producing that for us.

206
00:16:30,372 --> 00:16:40,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it lagged a little bit, but if you couldn't hear part of it or you want to see it again, we will post that video on our website very soon after this or by tomorrow.

207
00:16:41,161 --> 00:16:47,203
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's just go back to some of the things about the Andrews, just as a highlight of some of the things that we do.

208
00:16:48,283 --> 00:16:52,044
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that we have, of course, as I mentioned in the video, we have two sides.

209
00:16:52,164 --> 00:16:53,585
[SPEAKER_02]: We have A side and B side.

210
00:16:54,205 --> 00:17:04,048
[SPEAKER_02]: For all you students that are coming here next year, just know that both sides have some fantastic teachers in them, and you have nothing to worry about whatever side you end up on.

211
00:17:04,628 --> 00:17:09,170
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have nine Chromebook carts, as mentioned in there, with an updated computer lab.

212
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:17,954
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that we also have at the Andrews that's one of the best parts of my job is periodically we have a student of the month breakfast.

213
00:17:18,395 --> 00:17:20,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to publicly thank Ms.

214
00:17:20,235 --> 00:17:24,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Santos and Mr. Lynch, as they are the ones that organize the breakfast when we have it.

215
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:27,179
[SPEAKER_02]: So part of doing the best that you can

216
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:38,096
[SPEAKER_02]: is that if you do the best you can and you show excellence through responsibility and respect, maybe your team or the exploratory teachers will nominate you for student of the month.

217
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:42,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, we have several clubs and activities.

218
00:17:42,493 --> 00:17:46,838
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the great parts about being at the Andrews is the number of activities that we have.

219
00:17:47,298 --> 00:17:48,620
[SPEAKER_02]: We have middle school sports.

220
00:17:49,141 --> 00:17:53,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank Mr. Bobby Maloney from the high school and Ms.

221
00:17:53,225 --> 00:17:54,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Rachel Perry, the athletic directors.

222
00:17:55,448 --> 00:17:58,291
[SPEAKER_02]: They really got the ball rolling this year.

223
00:17:58,852 --> 00:17:59,313
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a

224
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,636
[SPEAKER_02]: sports in the fall, the winter, and the spring.

225
00:18:03,156 --> 00:18:06,639
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have several clubs for anyone that has several kinds of interests.

226
00:18:06,739 --> 00:18:14,206
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, we have the Builders Club, Diversity Club, Environmental Club, we have a GSA here, we have a soccer club.

227
00:18:14,646 --> 00:18:17,068
[SPEAKER_02]: We are lucky enough to have the Boston Shakespeare Club.

228
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:22,613
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a club that is sponsored by an outside vendor and they do a great job with our students.

229
00:18:22,974 --> 00:18:26,517
[SPEAKER_02]: We have dodgeball, we have movie club, plus many more.

230
00:18:26,997 --> 00:18:30,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, we also share clubs with the McGlynn.

231
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:42,572
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the great things is if you're a little nervous that some of your friends are not coming to the Andrews, I can tell you there are going to be plenty of opportunities for you to see your friends through these clubs and these activities.

232
00:18:42,972 --> 00:18:46,676
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, we have wonderful opportunities for many people.

233
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:58,685
[SPEAKER_02]: What I want to do now is I'm going to share my screen with you, and I want to show you what your schedule will look like, not as individuals, but what they typically look like for most students.

234
00:18:58,945 --> 00:18:59,986
[SPEAKER_25]: So bear with me here.

235
00:19:14,658 --> 00:19:15,178
[SPEAKER_25]: So this

236
00:19:16,474 --> 00:19:19,555
[SPEAKER_02]: is what a student schedule will look like here.

237
00:19:20,335 --> 00:19:24,437
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see, during the first block, you'll have an academic class.

238
00:19:24,937 --> 00:19:30,299
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, during the second and the last block of the day, you're going to have your exploratories.

239
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:40,623
[SPEAKER_02]: The exploratories vary from student to student, such as band, orchestra, Spanish, Italian, physical education, health, all kinds of great opportunities.

240
00:19:41,243 --> 00:19:44,686
[SPEAKER_02]: For sixth graders, you will eat lunch the fifth block of the day.

241
00:19:45,246 --> 00:19:55,434
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for some of you, you may have already noticed on the third block on Wednesday, you will see it says W-I-N-N, and that stands for what I need now.

242
00:19:58,596 --> 00:20:04,203
[SPEAKER_02]: During this time, your teachers will provide opportunities for you to do many different things.

243
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:07,126
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes that's when we have our presentations.

244
00:20:07,526 --> 00:20:12,092
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, this is just a sample of what a sixth grade schedule will look like.

245
00:20:14,995 --> 00:20:15,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

246
00:20:16,246 --> 00:20:18,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Next, we have a parent fact sheet.

247
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:30,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this parent fact sheet is something that the faculty and some parents came up with for you parents and even students out there, some of the questions you may have.

248
00:20:30,315 --> 00:20:34,597
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm going to do is I'm going to share this again with you.

249
00:20:34,738 --> 00:20:36,799
[SPEAKER_25]: Again, please bear with me for just one second.

250
00:20:45,888 --> 00:20:50,412
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is something that will go out in August to all the families.

251
00:20:51,273 --> 00:20:56,997
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the biggest things, as you get into middle school, you need to be self-advocating for yourself.

252
00:20:57,258 --> 00:21:00,560
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, your parents will want to check on your progress in your grades.

253
00:21:01,201 --> 00:21:02,642
[SPEAKER_02]: That is done through School Brains.

254
00:21:03,022 --> 00:21:07,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Before school starts, make sure you know your School Brains account and your password.

255
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:16,756
[SPEAKER_02]: If for some reason you need to be dismissed or you are absent, this is the main line to the Andrews Middle School.

256
00:21:16,877 --> 00:21:18,218
[SPEAKER_02]: It is posted on the website.

257
00:21:18,818 --> 00:21:33,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Please know for you parents and guardians out there that in order for you to sign out your student, you must check in with a security officer at the front door and you must show an ID and you must physically sign that student out for that time.

258
00:21:34,462 --> 00:21:38,545
[SPEAKER_02]: For meetings, middle school works a little different than the elementary schools.

259
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:40,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Our two guidance Councilors, Ms.

260
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:46,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Santos and Mr. Lynch, are the people that you want to reach out and if you want to meet with a team.

261
00:21:47,191 --> 00:21:55,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I've given you some meeting times here, but please note that although these are the times of the day that they are typically available,

262
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all the days they can meet.

263
00:21:57,758 --> 00:22:05,044
[SPEAKER_02]: They have several other obligations during the week that may preclude them from meeting during a time and a day that you may wish.

264
00:22:05,544 --> 00:22:10,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we do our very best at the Andrews and please reach out to Mr. Lynch or Ms.

265
00:22:10,368 --> 00:22:14,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Santos if you wish to arrange a team meeting with the team.

266
00:22:15,332 --> 00:22:21,998
[SPEAKER_02]: If your son or daughter or student needs to see a specialist, please communicate that directly to that specialist.

267
00:22:22,861 --> 00:22:26,322
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some great events throughout the year through the PTO.

268
00:22:26,902 --> 00:22:30,984
[SPEAKER_02]: I will go back to the PTO at the end of this presentation.

269
00:22:31,724 --> 00:22:33,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, please help out our PTO.

270
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:36,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Our PTO does so much for us.

271
00:22:36,785 --> 00:22:41,087
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't thank them enough for all the generous support they have shown us over the years.

272
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:50,281
[SPEAKER_02]: As a reminder, all forms given out during homeroom and during the year will be posted on our website under Andrews Middle School information.

273
00:22:50,762 --> 00:22:54,685
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be done around August, so please check back in later.

274
00:22:55,526 --> 00:23:02,311
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not sure who our ETL is going to be, for those of you who have students who receive special education services.

275
00:23:02,951 --> 00:23:05,934
[SPEAKER_02]: However, that information will go out as soon as we know.

276
00:23:05,954 --> 00:23:10,437
[SPEAKER_02]: A key for grades in the honor roll, of course, it's in the handbook.

277
00:23:11,218 --> 00:23:14,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Please check the teacher and teacher websites for homework assignments.

278
00:23:15,002 --> 00:23:22,271
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those of you who have gotten used to distance learning, many of the teachers at the Andrews already had Google Classroom.

279
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:30,240
[SPEAKER_02]: And so hopefully by now with this distant learning plan, you are able to go onto Google Classroom and check your work every day.

280
00:23:31,081 --> 00:23:41,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Please check the website for bus information, especially the late buses which will run from Tuesday to Thursday around 3 o'clock 15 on once about September usually.

281
00:23:42,748 --> 00:23:46,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Information on progress reports and report cards can also be found on our website.

282
00:23:47,251 --> 00:23:52,836
[SPEAKER_02]: And before school starts, please check your students bus route and bus number.

283
00:23:52,856 --> 00:23:59,701
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the expectations we have is that when you show up on the first day of school, you know your bus route and your bus number.

284
00:23:59,801 --> 00:24:04,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Please do not wait to school starting to find that out, even if you

285
00:24:04,685 --> 00:24:08,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Not sure your student will take the bus, please know your bus information.

286
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:14,675
[SPEAKER_02]: And the school provide lockers and locks on the first day of school, so please do not use a non-school lock.

287
00:24:14,835 --> 00:24:21,241
[SPEAKER_02]: We ask that you don't do this in case, of course, you forget your combination and then that way we can help you out.

288
00:24:24,324 --> 00:24:29,225
[SPEAKER_02]: One more thing I'd like to touch upon before we open it up for questions is our PTO.

289
00:24:29,785 --> 00:24:39,907
[SPEAKER_02]: And this slide, I'm gonna share a slide with you again to show what the PTO does for us and all the different activities that we have because of the PTO.

290
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,030
[SPEAKER_25]: So the PTO,

291
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:59,012
[SPEAKER_02]: runs our school dances, they run our dodgeball tournament, they catalog fundraisers, they have restaurant fundraisers.

292
00:24:59,192 --> 00:25:05,940
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, we were hoping to have a Wizards basketball game, but unfortunately that was postponed and or canceled.

293
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Every year we do the Jingle Bell run and walk.

294
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:11,705
[SPEAKER_02]: We also, they support our staff.

295
00:25:11,825 --> 00:25:17,668
[SPEAKER_02]: They've, in the last few years, they have been able to support two Chromebooks carts for the entire school.

296
00:25:18,368 --> 00:25:25,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, please join their face group page and also you can email them at ptoandrews at gmail.com.

297
00:25:26,313 --> 00:25:30,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, they need your help and your support, both financially and with time.

298
00:25:31,315 --> 00:25:32,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Please be involved in our PTO.

299
00:25:33,056 --> 00:25:36,258
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said, they do wonderful work for us here at the Andrews.

300
00:25:44,082 --> 00:25:47,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, at this time, I want to bring in my panelists.

301
00:25:48,165 --> 00:25:51,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very lucky to have some great panelists with us tonight.

302
00:25:52,287 --> 00:25:53,328
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Ms.

303
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,730
[SPEAKER_02]: McEwen, the assistant principal, Mr. Maidment.

304
00:25:56,633 --> 00:25:57,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Give them a wave, please.

305
00:25:58,474 --> 00:25:59,375
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now we have Ms.

306
00:25:59,435 --> 00:26:00,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Santos as well.

307
00:26:01,036 --> 00:26:01,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

308
00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:02,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Santos is our guidance Councilor.

309
00:26:03,477 --> 00:26:06,039
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mr. D. Clemente from 6A.

310
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:07,920
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe Ms.

311
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Boots is somewhere in the background.

312
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:12,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not 100% sure, but she might be there somewhere.

313
00:26:12,883 --> 00:26:18,446
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we'd like to open up for questions for you, and we'll do our best to answer them.

314
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:33,807
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the questions, guys, I think was already answered was about what sports we have in the fall.

315
00:26:33,987 --> 00:26:36,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, we have, Mr. Maidment, would you wanna answer that, please?

316
00:26:39,048 --> 00:26:43,869
[SPEAKER_28]: So we have cross country is one of our intramurals that we run.

317
00:26:44,849 --> 00:26:48,530
[SPEAKER_28]: And then in the winter is boys and girls basketball.

318
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,890
[SPEAKER_28]: And those are our three intramurals that we have so far.

319
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,150
[SPEAKER_28]: It was our first year.

320
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:56,051
[SPEAKER_28]: Next year, we potentially could have more.

321
00:26:58,899 --> 00:26:59,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Maidment.

322
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,882
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the questions was about football, and as we said, we do not have football.

323
00:27:04,403 --> 00:27:06,004
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not something that we have.

324
00:27:07,345 --> 00:27:08,766
[SPEAKER_02]: And any other questions?

325
00:27:09,026 --> 00:27:12,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody else see any questions that we have from the live audience?

326
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:14,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see any.

327
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys see any by any chance?

328
00:27:17,352 --> 00:27:17,572
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

329
00:27:19,053 --> 00:27:20,354
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't see any.

330
00:27:21,054 --> 00:27:21,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

331
00:27:21,855 --> 00:27:22,275
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

332
00:27:22,676 --> 00:27:22,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Well,

333
00:27:24,329 --> 00:27:27,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Without further ado, I do thank my panelists for showing up tonight.

334
00:27:28,091 --> 00:27:32,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate your time and your patience and waiting for your moment in the sun.

335
00:27:32,274 --> 00:27:37,978
[SPEAKER_02]: So sixth grade families, here are some of the people that you will see in the fall.

336
00:27:38,378 --> 00:27:41,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, Mr. D. Clemente from 6A, Ms.

337
00:27:42,201 --> 00:27:46,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Santos, who's the guidance Councilor for 6A, Mr. Maidment, our

338
00:27:47,364 --> 00:27:50,668
[SPEAKER_02]: physical education teacher extraordinaire and Ms.

339
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:53,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Julia McEwen, our assistant principal.

340
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:54,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all for showing up.

341
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:55,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for your time.

342
00:27:55,733 --> 00:27:56,594
[SPEAKER_02]: I do appreciate it.

343
00:27:58,216 --> 00:28:00,719
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Downs, can I just ask the panelists a quick question?

344
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:03,062
[SPEAKER_27]: What would be their one piece of advice

345
00:28:04,255 --> 00:28:08,879
[SPEAKER_27]: to the sixth graders coming in for a successful transition to middle school.

346
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:11,041
[SPEAKER_27]: We have really experienced middle school teachers.

347
00:28:11,562 --> 00:28:15,406
[SPEAKER_27]: What would be your one piece of advice for them to come in?

348
00:28:15,466 --> 00:28:27,597
[SPEAKER_27]: And then all of the people who are online looking at Facebook or anything like that, or Facebook or YouTube, put your questions in the comment line and we can put them up on screen so that they can be answered.

349
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,992
[SPEAKER_27]: And now the man behind the curtain is going back.

350
00:28:32,315 --> 00:28:34,059
[SPEAKER_27]: So go ahead, Mr. Bateman.

351
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:44,218
[SPEAKER_28]: I think the first thing is that the incoming sixth graders, for a smooth transition, don't be afraid to ask for help.

352
00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:45,939
[SPEAKER_28]: Ask for questions.

353
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,860
[SPEAKER_28]: We're all here for you.

354
00:28:48,421 --> 00:28:49,321
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, ask us.

355
00:28:49,501 --> 00:28:53,463
[SPEAKER_28]: If you don't know where something is, if you don't know who somebody is, ask us.

356
00:28:53,803 --> 00:28:58,446
[SPEAKER_28]: We have no problem helping anyone out at any moment for any questions.

357
00:29:00,595 --> 00:29:05,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I think even for that first day and that first week, everybody can be a little bit nervous.

358
00:29:05,718 --> 00:29:08,560
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, I, I'm a little bit nervous in that first day.

359
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I know people that have been, even teachers who have been teaching for 20 years get nervous.

360
00:29:13,964 --> 00:29:14,905
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're not alone.

361
00:29:15,205 --> 00:29:18,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Incoming sixth graders, you're going to see teachers in the hallway.

362
00:29:18,127 --> 00:29:22,410
[SPEAKER_03]: That first day can be really overwhelming and kind of just like a little crazy.

363
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:27,353
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely just ask one of the teachers, guidance Councilors, Ms.

364
00:29:27,373 --> 00:29:30,355
[SPEAKER_03]: McEwen and Mr. Downs, who's definitely going to be in the hallway.

365
00:29:30,695 --> 00:29:33,517
[SPEAKER_03]: and we'll get you through that first day in that first week for sure.

366
00:29:35,718 --> 00:29:36,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. DiClemente.

367
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:43,043
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, excuse me, I would say there's plenty of opportunity to try something new.

368
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:50,948
[SPEAKER_30]: I know in the video, the opening video we had, there's clubs, the dodgeball club Mr. Zizo runs is huge.

369
00:29:51,768 --> 00:29:56,932
[SPEAKER_30]: There's a soccer club, there's book club, movie club, language clubs, try something new.

370
00:29:57,872 --> 00:30:01,593
[SPEAKER_30]: And I know a couple of parents, it looks like, are asking about what side they'll be on.

371
00:30:02,173 --> 00:30:08,835
[SPEAKER_30]: We work collaboratively, so we reach out between A and B. So sides are not necessarily important.

372
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:14,436
[SPEAKER_30]: We work together as a huge sixth grade team to make sure everything's running smoothly for everybody.

373
00:30:14,536 --> 00:30:19,377
[SPEAKER_30]: So it's a great opportunity to try something new and meet new people.

374
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:20,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, man.

375
00:30:21,058 --> 00:30:22,078
[SPEAKER_02]: How about you, Mr. McEwen?

376
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:29,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, number one, I think, make sure that you use the agenda that gets given out at the beginning of the school year.

377
00:30:29,678 --> 00:30:31,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you are keeping track.

378
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:41,150
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are going to be going to lots of different classes, lots of different classrooms, and your teachers are going to be giving you different assignments, and it's going to be your responsibility to keep track of those.

379
00:30:41,491 --> 00:30:45,095
[SPEAKER_07]: When I say it's going to be your responsibility, we're going to help you with that big time.

380
00:30:45,655 --> 00:30:50,638
[SPEAKER_07]: But that agenda is going to be, you need to make it your new best friend when you show up for sixth grade.

381
00:30:50,678 --> 00:30:55,361
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mr. DiClemente, I know, is going to make sure that you get very well acquainted with that.

382
00:30:55,461 --> 00:31:00,563
[SPEAKER_07]: But make sure that you're keeping track of assignments, moving around from room to room, going to different floors.

383
00:31:00,603 --> 00:31:03,445
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot to keep track of, and it might feel a little bit overwhelming.

384
00:31:03,485 --> 00:31:06,747
[SPEAKER_07]: And like everybody else on the panel said, we're here to help you with that.

385
00:31:07,087 --> 00:31:10,089
[SPEAKER_07]: But one of the ways that you can help yourself is to keep track of that agenda.

386
00:31:10,109 --> 00:31:11,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you're writing down what you need to do.

387
00:31:13,211 --> 00:31:13,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

388
00:31:13,631 --> 00:31:14,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Ms.

389
00:31:14,171 --> 00:31:14,632
[SPEAKER_02]: McEwen.

390
00:31:15,532 --> 00:31:20,534
[SPEAKER_02]: My piece of advice is, like some of the teachers have already said, just ask.

391
00:31:20,694 --> 00:31:27,117
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you're not really sure what to do or, you know, who to go see or whatever, just ask an adult in the building.

392
00:31:27,557 --> 00:31:31,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Every adult at the Andrews, as you will find out, is there to help every student every day.

393
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,201
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether you, if they're your teacher or not, please just go up to an adult and ask.

394
00:31:36,921 --> 00:31:42,023
[SPEAKER_02]: We find that sometimes students don't do what they're supposed to, because they didn't know, because they didn't ask.

395
00:31:42,063 --> 00:31:44,444
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, ask any adult in the building.

396
00:31:44,784 --> 00:31:46,485
[SPEAKER_02]: They will help you out all the time.

397
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:51,747
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the questions that popped up when we were talking was, is there an art club?

398
00:31:51,847 --> 00:31:52,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there is.

399
00:31:52,907 --> 00:31:55,908
[SPEAKER_02]: That is with Mr. Gallagher after school.

400
00:31:56,449 --> 00:31:59,790
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other question was, how many classes a day do students have?

401
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have an eight-block schedule.

402
00:32:02,652 --> 00:32:10,657
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that means is that we have eight classes a day, but one of those is lunch, two are for exploratory, and the rest are for our academic blocks.

403
00:32:11,118 --> 00:32:14,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Our classes are roughly about 45 minutes long for each one.

404
00:32:18,283 --> 00:32:19,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody has a question.

405
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:21,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Can twins be in the same class?

406
00:32:21,525 --> 00:32:24,187
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually done at random, but sometimes it works out that way.

407
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:28,130
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do have a lot of twins, it seems like.

408
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:33,595
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the questions is, what is the difference between A side and B side?

409
00:32:34,516 --> 00:32:36,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I answer this, Mr. DiClemente?

410
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:39,504
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, there is no difference.

411
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:44,626
[SPEAKER_30]: There's an A and B only because we have more kids that can be accommodated by one team.

412
00:32:45,567 --> 00:32:50,209
[SPEAKER_30]: We work, as I said just a few moments ago, collaboratively.

413
00:32:50,289 --> 00:32:54,631
[SPEAKER_30]: So the ELA, history, math, and science teachers work together.

414
00:32:55,211 --> 00:32:58,533
[SPEAKER_30]: We stay fairly on pace with each other.

415
00:32:59,673 --> 00:33:05,636
[SPEAKER_30]: So, I mean, the only difference is that we need to have the two teams to accommodate the amount of kids that come into the school.

416
00:33:07,264 --> 00:33:07,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, thank you.

417
00:33:08,025 --> 00:33:10,287
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no real difference.

418
00:33:10,807 --> 00:33:14,351
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I said at the beginning, both of our sides are great.

419
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:17,274
[SPEAKER_02]: We have great teachers on 6A and 6B.

420
00:33:18,155 --> 00:33:20,177
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there really isn't a difference between the two.

421
00:33:20,217 --> 00:33:21,638
[SPEAKER_02]: They're both fantastic.

422
00:33:21,658 --> 00:33:23,320
[SPEAKER_02]: And every year, kids love their side.

423
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,182
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the positives of being at the Andrews.

424
00:33:27,584 --> 00:33:33,829
[SPEAKER_03]: And just so the incoming sixth graders know that for your exploratory classes, you're all mixed in.

425
00:33:33,949 --> 00:33:40,616
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're not just with A students, if you're on side A, you're not just with B students, you get to, we mix them up.

426
00:33:40,736 --> 00:33:46,481
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really just a great opportunity to get to know the other kids on the other side in your four exploratories.

427
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:48,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

428
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for that, Ms.

429
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:50,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Santos.

430
00:33:50,479 --> 00:33:57,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything else the panel would like to share that might be of use for any of the students or parents listening right now?

431
00:33:57,783 --> 00:33:58,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Mr. DiClemente.

432
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:07,349
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, I just want to say I know the first day of school is often a big point of anxiety when people are coming in.

433
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:11,051
[SPEAKER_30]: We set it up, and of course, I mean, we can't

434
00:34:11,872 --> 00:34:26,735
[SPEAKER_30]: predict the future, but normally how the first day of school will work, when you come into the physical building, you'll be in either the cafeteria or the gymnasium, as Mr. Downs pointed out in the video we just saw a few moments ago.

435
00:34:27,695 --> 00:34:33,156
[SPEAKER_30]: And the sixth graders will wait in the cafeteria, Mr. Mayment will hold them there.

436
00:34:34,076 --> 00:34:38,477
[SPEAKER_30]: The teachers will come down, the homeroom teachers will come down and get the kids.

437
00:34:39,226 --> 00:34:40,467
[SPEAKER_30]: bring you up to homeroom.

438
00:34:41,208 --> 00:34:42,449
[SPEAKER_30]: We have an extended homeroom.

439
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:48,514
[SPEAKER_30]: We go over all the procedures that would normally happen, get your locks, make sure everything is all squared away.

440
00:34:49,374 --> 00:34:53,538
[SPEAKER_30]: And then we will do that several times throughout the day.

441
00:34:53,558 --> 00:35:03,566
[SPEAKER_30]: And then the sixth graders will go down early at the end of the day, just go through the end of the day procedure for the whole first week of school to get on the buses they need to do.

442
00:35:04,547 --> 00:35:07,309
[SPEAKER_30]: So I know parents and guardians, adults at home,

443
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:09,452
[SPEAKER_30]: are nervous to let their kids go.

444
00:35:09,472 --> 00:35:11,553
[SPEAKER_30]: And I understand that.

445
00:35:11,633 --> 00:35:19,995
[SPEAKER_30]: And all of us on the panel have experience with this or have our own children and realize it can be difficult to let the kids go.

446
00:35:20,055 --> 00:35:33,199
[SPEAKER_30]: But we have very strict procedures in place to make sure that the sixth graders get in to their homerooms, go out the day and back to the bus with someone making sure that they know where they're going.

447
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:36,440
[SPEAKER_30]: And we do that the whole first week of school.

448
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:45,584
[SPEAKER_30]: The second week of school, it starts to let up a little bit, but the whole first month of school, the sixth grade teams work on all the routines and procedures of the school.

449
00:35:45,984 --> 00:35:49,246
[SPEAKER_30]: We stand out in the hallways to make sure that everyone knows where they are going.

450
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:59,871
[SPEAKER_30]: So, I mean, you can hopefully rest assured as much as possible that your kids are in good hands and we're there to make sure they know where they're going and they're not overwhelmed.

451
00:36:01,783 --> 00:36:03,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. DiClemente.

452
00:36:03,425 --> 00:36:06,588
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of the questions are there advanced classes for sixth graders?

453
00:36:06,628 --> 00:36:08,050
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no advanced classes.

454
00:36:08,911 --> 00:36:13,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Every student is in the same level of classes in the sixth grade.

455
00:36:13,836 --> 00:36:18,922
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the other questions was, do we teach students to self-advocate for themselves?

456
00:36:19,142 --> 00:36:19,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

457
00:36:19,322 --> 00:36:23,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Santos, can I give you that question as someone that teaches the guidance classes?

458
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:39,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so what Mr. Lynch and I, and Mr. Lynch is the other guidance Councilor assigned to side B, and we cover lots of different topics in our guidance classes from how to make new friends, transition from elementary to middle school, how to stay organized, how to deal with stress.

459
00:36:39,108 --> 00:36:48,113
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also talk about, sorry, I lost my train of thought, how to advocate for yourself.

460
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:49,834
[SPEAKER_03]: And we talk about, we do,

461
00:36:51,269 --> 00:37:12,181
[SPEAKER_03]: role plays and scenarios and it's a lot of group work and so Kids, it's really it can be a very small class so we can do a lot of things together So we definitely cover that and we also are available for one-on-one chats So if anybody wants to come down for a specific situation to talk about with me or mr. Lynch, we're always available Excellent.

462
00:37:12,221 --> 00:37:12,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

463
00:37:12,621 --> 00:37:12,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

464
00:37:12,861 --> 00:37:13,222
[SPEAKER_02]: McEwen.

465
00:37:13,242 --> 00:37:16,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you go over some of the rules at lunchtime while we have them here?

466
00:37:17,995 --> 00:37:18,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

467
00:37:18,595 --> 00:37:20,496
[SPEAKER_07]: And also just to echo Ms.

468
00:37:20,516 --> 00:37:27,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Santos, Mr. Downs and I are also always available to help problem solve or help figure something out when things are not going so great.

469
00:37:28,709 --> 00:37:30,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Encounter are also here to help.

470
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:35,732
[SPEAKER_07]: At lunch, we make sure that things are as safe as possible.

471
00:37:35,832 --> 00:37:40,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Our top priority is that students have enough time to eat and that they're doing so safely.

472
00:37:40,694 --> 00:37:51,339
[SPEAKER_07]: So typically what we do every day is we have two sides of the cafeteria, the stage side, which is the table closest to the stage, and window side, which is the tables closest to the windows.

473
00:37:51,419 --> 00:37:55,121
[SPEAKER_07]: And usually what we do is we send students up to get their lunch

474
00:37:55,661 --> 00:37:57,402
[SPEAKER_07]: one at a time, one side at a time.

475
00:37:57,962 --> 00:38:00,022
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys can choose where you sit in the cafeteria.

476
00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:06,224
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no assigned seating, but we do reserve the right to change that in case things are getting unruly.

477
00:38:06,725 --> 00:38:12,987
[SPEAKER_07]: We did not have to do that this year, so I don't think it'll be an issue, but just so that it's out there right now, we do reserve that right.

478
00:38:13,427 --> 00:38:15,968
[SPEAKER_07]: We send you guys one side at a time up to get your food.

479
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:18,512
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty open.

480
00:38:18,552 --> 00:38:20,713
[SPEAKER_07]: We make announcements at the beginning of lunch.

481
00:38:20,753 --> 00:38:26,277
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a system where when you see an adult's hand go up, that means that your hand goes up as well.

482
00:38:26,397 --> 00:38:27,818
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you turn your sounds off.

483
00:38:28,298 --> 00:38:29,199
[SPEAKER_07]: It works pretty well.

484
00:38:29,459 --> 00:38:30,820
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something that we practice.

485
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,482
[SPEAKER_07]: And then once people are done eating, we clean up.

486
00:38:34,622 --> 00:38:36,864
[SPEAKER_07]: We make sure that we make an announcement to give you a reminder.

487
00:38:36,884 --> 00:38:41,407
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we all head outside and we pretty much head out in all kinds of weather.

488
00:38:41,427 --> 00:38:47,391
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's really raining hard or snowing, we don't go out because we don't want you guys sitting for the rest of the day in wet clothes.

489
00:38:47,871 --> 00:38:50,593
[SPEAKER_07]: But when it's cold, we expect that you bring your jackets to lunch.

490
00:38:50,653 --> 00:38:56,156
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's too cold to go out, we'll make an announcement before lunches and say, don't bring your stuff down.

491
00:38:56,176 --> 00:38:57,097
[SPEAKER_07]: We're staying inside.

492
00:38:58,418 --> 00:39:00,399
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's pretty much how lunch goes.

493
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:05,042
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that I'm seeing the question, are there vegan options for lunch?

494
00:39:06,203 --> 00:39:07,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes, yes.

495
00:39:07,223 --> 00:39:09,825
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure that there's a regular vegan option, though.

496
00:39:09,845 --> 00:39:12,607
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that Mr. Downs, can you confirm that?

497
00:39:13,527 --> 00:39:16,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, doing I not on a regular basis.

498
00:39:16,948 --> 00:39:19,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's of course left up to the lunch program.

499
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:25,952
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing you can count on though, kids is the fact that you will watch Mr. Downs eat his salad every lunch.

500
00:39:26,352 --> 00:39:27,332
[SPEAKER_07]: That's every single day.

501
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:32,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Downs and I don't tend to take time for lunch for ourselves.

502
00:39:32,854 --> 00:39:33,955
[SPEAKER_07]: So we usually like to.

503
00:39:34,415 --> 00:39:37,418
[SPEAKER_07]: bring our lunch into the lunchroom, sit with you guys, eat with you guys.

504
00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:45,246
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that everybody on this panel can attest to somebody here really eating a lot of Panera every day.

505
00:39:45,266 --> 00:39:47,568
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'll see that happening.

506
00:39:47,588 --> 00:39:49,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

507
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:50,571
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

508
00:39:50,731 --> 00:39:54,555
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, Mr. Maidman, is there anything else you would like to add by any chance?

509
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,941
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, I mean, it says what time does school start?

510
00:39:59,081 --> 00:40:02,342
[SPEAKER_28]: So, uh, I'm usually there around seven 30.

511
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:04,483
[SPEAKER_28]: The doors are open around seven.

512
00:40:05,263 --> 00:40:07,864
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, a lot of the kids come into the gym before I get there.

513
00:40:07,884 --> 00:40:10,445
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh, the first bell will ring at seven 50.

514
00:40:11,365 --> 00:40:17,227
[SPEAKER_28]: And that's when I will dismiss the, each grade out of the gym.

515
00:40:17,347 --> 00:40:26,310
[SPEAKER_28]: And then they go to their classes and then you have homeroom from seven 50 to eight Oh five at eight Oh five, the bell rings and then you go to your first period.

516
00:40:27,651 --> 00:40:28,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

517
00:40:28,212 --> 00:40:28,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

518
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:30,073
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

519
00:40:30,954 --> 00:40:31,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody else?

520
00:40:31,794 --> 00:40:33,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any other questions?

521
00:40:33,356 --> 00:40:34,457
[SPEAKER_02]: What time does school start?

522
00:40:35,237 --> 00:40:40,982
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the questions that we have is how do we address the issue of racial diversity and equity?

523
00:40:41,442 --> 00:40:45,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, part of being at the Andrews, of course, is excellence, responsibility, respect.

524
00:40:46,306 --> 00:40:48,167
[SPEAKER_02]: we instilled that from day one.

525
00:40:48,207 --> 00:41:01,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Maidment started on day one saying that to the students and so therefore as a staff we are very cognizant of the different issues and the different diversity that we have in our building and we make sure especially Ms.

526
00:41:01,713 --> 00:41:10,878
[SPEAKER_02]: McEwen and I that those differences are respected and I would say that all the teachers at the Andrews make sure that everybody's differences are respected and welcomed at the Andrews.

527
00:41:11,198 --> 00:41:13,719
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what makes us such a great school no matter

528
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:17,804
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, whoever you are, wherever you are, it doesn't matter to us.

529
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:22,289
[SPEAKER_02]: We are here for you and we will take care of you as best we can each and every day.

530
00:41:22,509 --> 00:41:23,430
[SPEAKER_02]: That I can assure you.

531
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions that we have here on the side?

532
00:41:29,218 --> 00:41:32,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Downs, I saw one pop up about how to join clubs or activities.

533
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:43,441
[SPEAKER_07]: There's usually a club fair in the fall, and you get to walk through the cafeteria, and everyone who runs a club has set up information about their club.

534
00:41:43,521 --> 00:41:46,302
[SPEAKER_07]: And the time commitments really change from club to club.

535
00:41:46,342 --> 00:41:52,823
[SPEAKER_07]: The gay-straight alliance, the GSA, meets every other week, whereas some clubs meet

536
00:41:54,051 --> 00:41:59,435
[SPEAKER_07]: once a week and so it really depends on the club, but you'll have an opportunity and lots of information will go out to you.

537
00:41:59,455 --> 00:42:02,997
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one of the announcements we make at lunch, lots of reminders for how to sign up.

538
00:42:05,635 --> 00:42:08,196
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the questions is, do we have lunch at the same time as the McGlynn?

539
00:42:08,456 --> 00:42:12,838
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly, I believe we do, but we will never because we're never there for their lunch.

540
00:42:13,478 --> 00:42:16,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless Mr. Tucci wants to come over and do my lunch duty someday.

541
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:18,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I'm not really sure about that.

542
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:25,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, one of the great things, uh, again, being so close to the McGlynn is that if your friends go to the McGlynn, you will see them.

543
00:42:25,662 --> 00:42:27,663
[SPEAKER_02]: You will see them at your clubs and your activities.

544
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:31,184
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in band or orchestra, you will see them in band and orchestra.

545
00:42:31,344 --> 00:42:32,565
[SPEAKER_02]: If you happen to play a sport.

546
00:42:33,085 --> 00:42:37,047
[SPEAKER_02]: and you make the team, you'll see your friends, if they make the team at those sports.

547
00:42:37,447 --> 00:42:39,028
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's plenty of opportunities.

548
00:42:39,368 --> 00:42:41,269
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're right next door to each other.

549
00:42:41,649 --> 00:42:43,329
[SPEAKER_02]: We're both part of Team Medford.

550
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:48,232
[SPEAKER_02]: We are different schools, but we share very much the same philosophies about schools.

551
00:42:48,872 --> 00:42:50,773
[SPEAKER_02]: And so don't worry about missing your friends.

552
00:42:50,813 --> 00:42:52,113
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see them plenty of times.

553
00:42:52,873 --> 00:42:54,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Clemente, you had a question or a comment, sir?

554
00:42:55,715 --> 00:42:57,155
[SPEAKER_30]: No, I'm just looking at a question here.

555
00:42:57,275 --> 00:42:58,796
[SPEAKER_30]: Where's my locker and how does it work?

556
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:12,691
[SPEAKER_30]: As sixth grade teachers, we spend an awful lot of the first day just going over all of that, where your locker is, how the locker works.

557
00:43:12,731 --> 00:43:14,412
[SPEAKER_30]: The school will provide a lock to you.

558
00:43:15,592 --> 00:43:20,715
[SPEAKER_30]: By homeroom and by side, you'll get a locker number that will be yours for the entire year.

559
00:43:22,095 --> 00:43:29,959
[SPEAKER_30]: So those are procedures and routines that we will spend ample amount of time on to make sure you know how all of that works.

560
00:43:30,546 --> 00:43:34,349
[SPEAKER_07]: And your locker is gonna be on the hall where your core classes take place.

561
00:43:34,429 --> 00:43:39,372
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're in Mr. DiClemente's homeroom, your locker is gonna be very close by to that classroom.

562
00:43:39,392 --> 00:43:42,574
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not gonna be going to a different floor or anything like that.

563
00:43:42,614 --> 00:43:48,258
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also, if you're on 6A, your locker is on the A side of the third floor, right near your homeroom.

564
00:43:50,479 --> 00:43:50,980
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. Maidment.

565
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:58,585
[SPEAKER_28]: DiClemente, do you wanna bring up the fact that they have scheduled locker time, that they can't always just be going to their locker when they need to?

566
00:43:59,815 --> 00:44:01,416
[SPEAKER_30]: Uh, yeah, we can do that briefly now.

567
00:44:01,476 --> 00:44:10,461
[SPEAKER_30]: And then obviously that's something we'll go over once the schedules come in and we get into school, but, um, it's, it's not a free for all.

568
00:44:10,501 --> 00:44:16,604
[SPEAKER_30]: So as Mr. Mayman mended in the morning, um, at eight 50, you'll be dismissed.

569
00:44:17,305 --> 00:44:21,707
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, the first few days of school will be a little bit different, but basically you'll be dismissed.

570
00:44:22,267 --> 00:44:22,988
[SPEAKER_30]: Come upstairs.

571
00:44:23,448 --> 00:44:28,671
[SPEAKER_30]: You have seven 50 to eight o'clock to go to your lock and get everything you need and go to homeroom.

572
00:44:29,389 --> 00:44:31,009
[SPEAKER_30]: By 8 o'clock, you should be in homeroom.

573
00:44:31,029 --> 00:44:33,130
[SPEAKER_30]: That's when attendance is officially taken.

574
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:37,511
[SPEAKER_30]: And then 8 to 8.05, you'll do the morning announcements.

575
00:44:39,232 --> 00:44:40,692
[SPEAKER_30]: There will be scheduled time.

576
00:44:40,732 --> 00:44:43,313
[SPEAKER_30]: So it's based off what the schedule is.

577
00:44:44,113 --> 00:44:46,114
[SPEAKER_30]: And Mr. Downs will send those out to you.

578
00:44:46,154 --> 00:44:50,815
[SPEAKER_30]: And then the teachers will make their locker times for you.

579
00:44:51,475 --> 00:44:54,616
[SPEAKER_30]: There'll be at least four or five opportunities to get what you need.

580
00:44:55,436 --> 00:44:57,917
[SPEAKER_30]: But we try to streamline it so you're not spending

581
00:44:58,823 --> 00:45:01,329
[SPEAKER_30]: four or five minutes of class time at your locker.

582
00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:07,525
[SPEAKER_30]: We want to try to maximize the amount of time you're in either your academic class or your exploratory classes.

583
00:45:09,531 --> 00:45:09,871
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

584
00:45:09,891 --> 00:45:13,272
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the questions is, can students start their own club?

585
00:45:14,032 --> 00:45:15,392
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little bit of a tricky one.

586
00:45:15,452 --> 00:45:22,194
[SPEAKER_02]: We have so many clubs between the Andrews and the McGlynn that it's very difficult to start new clubs.

587
00:45:23,134 --> 00:45:33,137
[SPEAKER_02]: New clubs have started in the past, but that's something that is on a case-by-case basis, depending on how many clubs are running and how many students are in those clubs already.

588
00:45:33,257 --> 00:45:37,318
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for the question, but that's what we can say for right now.

589
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:44,638
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. Downs, one question popped up and went away real quick about IDs.

590
00:45:45,339 --> 00:45:46,600
[SPEAKER_28]: My favorite part of the year.

591
00:45:50,423 --> 00:45:53,525
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you want to bring up the fact that we are expected to wear IDs?

592
00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:54,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

593
00:45:55,259 --> 00:45:57,441
[SPEAKER_02]: So every student will get issued an ID.

594
00:45:57,481 --> 00:46:01,884
[SPEAKER_02]: We ask that students have those IDs on them at all times for various reasons.

595
00:46:01,984 --> 00:46:04,026
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest reason is for safety.

596
00:46:04,086 --> 00:46:12,112
[SPEAKER_02]: If we happen to have to, let's say, do a drill and we need to take a head count, we want to make sure that everybody is who they say they are.

597
00:46:12,432 --> 00:46:14,193
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we ask students to do their ID.

598
00:46:14,314 --> 00:46:20,118
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other part of your IDs and your ID number or your lunch number, you're going to need to know your lunch number.

599
00:46:20,858 --> 00:46:24,802
[SPEAKER_02]: or your ID number at lunch, and when you go to the library to sign out a book.

600
00:46:24,842 --> 00:46:27,204
[SPEAKER_02]: So please remember your lunch number.

601
00:46:31,128 --> 00:46:33,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they have a bus for after school clubs?

602
00:46:34,571 --> 00:46:34,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

603
00:46:36,289 --> 00:46:43,771
[SPEAKER_02]: On Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, the school, the buses will come around 3.15 and it's only three buses.

604
00:46:44,252 --> 00:46:55,735
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, when the first day of school, you know, before school starts, check the late bus schedule and the drops because they are further away than your normal bus route is on the regular bus schedule.

605
00:46:56,836 --> 00:46:57,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question though.

606
00:46:59,341 --> 00:47:06,927
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wanted to add that all of those bus listings will be posted and teachers will be there to help you out to let you know which bus to take.

607
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:16,094
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that can be a little bit overwhelming, but for the incoming sixth graders, you know, we'll be able to help you out on which, which are the three late buses to take.

608
00:47:16,114 --> 00:47:17,795
[SPEAKER_28]: Go ahead, Mr. Maidment.

609
00:47:20,424 --> 00:47:32,347
[SPEAKER_28]: So me, Mr. Downs, Mr. Lynch, the first few weeks we'll be outside with every bus stop that the bus goes to.

610
00:47:32,847 --> 00:47:46,590
[SPEAKER_28]: So if you are questioning, we're outside with the piece of papers that says the corner of this street and that street, remember what street in what stop you got on so that we can then give you the correct bus.

611
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:48,310
[SPEAKER_28]: If you forget, we'll be out there.

612
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

613
00:47:50,161 --> 00:48:05,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Matter of fact, I'm going to say that go to Mr. Lynch if you have a question about your bus stop, because he's a lifelong Medford resident, and he's shaking his head because he'll probably get you lost but you know he knows his way around any of us.

614
00:48:08,186 --> 00:48:12,451
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the questions was if my son came from the McGlynn, is the lunch number the same?

615
00:48:12,672 --> 00:48:18,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, your lunch number will follow you all the way to the day you graduate from Medford High School.

616
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:19,381
[SPEAKER_02]: So good question.

617
00:48:22,345 --> 00:48:24,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions or comments from the panelists?

618
00:48:25,612 --> 00:48:39,460
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if there'll be a question, but I wanted to let the incoming sixth graders know about our dances that once a month we have awesome dances and some you can some are buddy dances where you can bring somebody from another middle school has to be a middle school student.

619
00:48:39,981 --> 00:48:43,603
[SPEAKER_03]: We also combine it with the middle Glenn, and they're really fun.

620
00:48:43,623 --> 00:48:46,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that you can see Mr. Downs dancing at one of them.

621
00:48:48,866 --> 00:48:55,132
[SPEAKER_03]: highly recommend that incoming sixth graders go ahead and attend those dances.

622
00:48:55,292 --> 00:48:56,073
[SPEAKER_03]: They're super fun.

623
00:48:56,913 --> 00:48:58,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Miss McEwen dances too.

624
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:02,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Miss McEwen, we wear sneakers.

625
00:49:05,141 --> 00:49:10,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's when we get to let our hair down a little bit and wear sneakers, but mostly we just dance behind the check-in table.

626
00:49:10,806 --> 00:49:11,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

627
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:14,751
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the questions that came up is what time does school end?

628
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:16,492
[SPEAKER_02]: School ends at 2.15.

629
00:49:17,712 --> 00:49:29,877
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, Mr. DiClemente already mentioned your locker, make sure you're organized because the buses leave, but I believe Mr. Mayme at 2.25 is when they typically leave, typically.

630
00:49:32,338 --> 00:49:33,679
[SPEAKER_28]: So make sure you're organized.

631
00:49:36,372 --> 00:49:38,393
[SPEAKER_28]: 225, 225, they start to leave, yes.

632
00:49:38,773 --> 00:49:39,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, all right.

633
00:49:40,635 --> 00:49:42,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else the panels would like to add?

634
00:49:44,144 --> 00:49:44,344
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

635
00:49:44,544 --> 00:49:44,985
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

636
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:47,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you, panelists, for your time.

637
00:49:47,306 --> 00:49:54,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, these people, you'll see them on the first day of school, which is, we come here faster than we know it.

638
00:49:54,110 --> 00:50:04,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, we'll be in the Andrews once the school year starts this year, because as all of us on the screen right now can tell you, we certainly miss the kids.

639
00:50:05,237 --> 00:50:08,058
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, that is Mr. Maidment in the background.

640
00:50:10,434 --> 00:50:11,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Just one more thing, Mr. Jones.

641
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:22,802
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that you guys are all probably really missing your own schools right now and that you're ending your fifth grade year in a way that nobody in any of our lifetimes has ended a school year.

642
00:50:23,002 --> 00:50:26,104
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we just want to let you know that we can't wait to meet you guys.

643
00:50:26,144 --> 00:50:28,666
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't wait to see you in August.

644
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:32,248
[SPEAKER_07]: We're really doing everything we can to make sure that things

645
00:50:32,868 --> 00:50:35,169
[SPEAKER_07]: go back to as normal as possible.

646
00:50:35,289 --> 00:50:37,791
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're so excited to start a new year with you guys.

647
00:50:37,811 --> 00:50:43,354
[SPEAKER_07]: We know that everybody is having such a new and kind of bizarre time right now.

648
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:50,358
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sure you're giving your parents lots and lots of love and being very well behaved and doing all of your work with no issues.

649
00:50:50,838 --> 00:50:52,899
[SPEAKER_07]: But we can't wait to start the new year with you guys.

650
00:50:53,059 --> 00:50:55,100
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're just really looking forward to it.

651
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:59,963
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hope that you take the next couple of weeks and your final weeks as fifth graders to

652
00:51:00,583 --> 00:51:05,447
[SPEAKER_07]: talk to your teachers and enjoy it and we're gonna make next year a really great one and we can't wait to meet you.

653
00:51:05,467 --> 00:51:07,408
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thank you panelists.

654
00:51:07,628 --> 00:51:09,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good night and I will talk to you later.

655
00:51:09,489 --> 00:51:10,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

656
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,223
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

657
00:51:17,243 --> 00:51:18,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, again, thanks to the panelists.

658
00:51:19,425 --> 00:51:28,091
[SPEAKER_02]: And so before we end tonight's presentation, I want to thank all the parents and guardians and caretakers out there and the students who joined us tonight.

659
00:51:28,111 --> 00:51:33,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to end with one simple thing, and that is my philosophy on education.

660
00:51:33,515 --> 00:51:34,997
[SPEAKER_02]: And my simple philosophy is

661
00:51:35,737 --> 00:51:37,298
[SPEAKER_02]: do what's best for kids.

662
00:51:37,919 --> 00:51:41,361
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, we're here to educate your son or daughter.

663
00:51:41,481 --> 00:51:46,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we're here to teach some lessons outside the classroom, and we take that very seriously.

664
00:51:47,005 --> 00:51:52,349
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always believe if we do what's best for kids, at the end of the day, everything will go well.

665
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:56,652
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, without much further ado, we have a video for you.

666
00:51:57,232 --> 00:52:00,154
[SPEAKER_02]: This video was produced by Miss Sarah Grant.

667
00:52:00,234 --> 00:52:01,355
[SPEAKER_02]: She is the music teacher

668
00:52:02,135 --> 00:52:04,918
[SPEAKER_02]: that I highlighted earlier in the opening video.

669
00:52:04,938 --> 00:52:10,322
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys will enjoy her very much as part of the exploratory rotation.

670
00:52:10,843 --> 00:52:14,806
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here comes the video from the students and from the teachers.

671
00:52:39,684 --> 00:52:42,345
[SPEAKER_14]: Greetings and welcome Andrews Middle School Class of 2023.

672
00:52:42,645 --> 00:52:49,427
[SPEAKER_14]: You are about to embark on a three-year adventure that will not only prepare you for high school, but will give you lots of opportunities to shine in and out of the classroom.

673
00:52:49,987 --> 00:52:52,988
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a proud alumni of AMS and a soon-to-be grad of Medford High School.

674
00:52:53,708 --> 00:53:01,990
[SPEAKER_14]: As I head to the University of Rhode Island in the fall, I'll be taking with me many valuable academic, artistic, social lessons, and tools that I learned from AMS.

675
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:05,811
[SPEAKER_14]: enjoy your time at the Endress Middle School because it's truly a special place.

676
00:53:05,871 --> 00:53:06,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi future AMSers.

677
00:53:07,131 --> 00:53:15,313
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my pleasure to introduce to you some of our amazing faculty and staff that are going to be incredibly dedicated to you during your time here.

678
00:53:16,153 --> 00:53:21,854
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we're all just so excited for you to come and join us in the AMS family.

679
00:53:22,154 --> 00:53:23,294
[SPEAKER_05]: So welcome to the school.

680
00:53:24,094 --> 00:53:27,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello to our incoming sixth graders and their families.

681
00:53:28,215 --> 00:53:29,336
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Miss Santos.

682
00:53:29,376 --> 00:53:31,236
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be one of your guidance Councilors next year.

683
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:38,484
[SPEAKER_03]: At the AMS, all of our faculty and staff are dedicated to support and guide all of our AMS students.

684
00:53:38,904 --> 00:53:41,406
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really looking forward to seeing you all in the fall.

685
00:53:42,086 --> 00:53:42,847
[SPEAKER_33]: Hello, everybody.

686
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:43,747
[SPEAKER_33]: My name is Ms.

687
00:53:43,767 --> 00:53:43,807
[SPEAKER_33]: Xu.

688
00:53:44,268 --> 00:53:45,368
[SPEAKER_33]: I teach sixth grade math.

689
00:53:46,589 --> 00:53:49,331
[SPEAKER_33]: I would like to share with you what makes Andrews Middle School special.

690
00:53:50,589 --> 00:53:52,352
[SPEAKER_33]: a special place to learn and grow.

691
00:53:53,254 --> 00:54:02,591
[SPEAKER_33]: When you come to Andrews Middle School next fall, you'll soon discover that it is a place where students find compassion, kindness, and caring from staff, teachers, and students.

692
00:54:03,914 --> 00:54:10,198
[SPEAKER_33]: One piece of advice I would like to give to incoming sixth graders is that you should take advantage of talking to your teachers.

693
00:54:10,918 --> 00:54:23,626
[SPEAKER_33]: If you have any questions on homework, classwork, quiz or test, talking to teachers after class or after school is a good way to get personal attention and to get help from your teachers.

694
00:54:24,546 --> 00:54:27,929
[SPEAKER_33]: I look forward to meeting all of you and hope to see you soon.

00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:32,631
[SPEAKER_34]: Hello, incoming Andrews Middle School sixth graders and families.

697
00:54:33,051 --> 00:54:34,071
[SPEAKER_34]: Hi, I'm Mr. Gallagher.

698
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,612
[SPEAKER_34]: Welcome to the Andrews Middle School.

699
00:54:36,232 --> 00:54:41,233
[SPEAKER_34]: Today, I just wanted to give you one tip on making the transition to middle school, and that is take your time.

700
00:54:41,913 --> 00:54:42,454
[SPEAKER_34]: Be patient.

701
00:54:43,054 --> 00:54:44,434
[SPEAKER_34]: Expect new things to happen.

702
00:54:44,934 --> 00:54:46,715
[SPEAKER_34]: Expect new people to do new things.

703
00:54:47,415 --> 00:54:50,876
[SPEAKER_34]: in new ways, but know that it's still school like it's always been.

704
00:54:51,356 --> 00:54:52,256
[SPEAKER_34]: It's a safe place for you.

705
00:54:52,576 --> 00:54:56,477
[SPEAKER_34]: It's a place for learning, a place for new experiences, and a place for growing.

706
00:54:56,677 --> 00:55:01,318
[SPEAKER_34]: And that's the main point, you growing, becoming more of who you are.

707
00:55:01,338 --> 00:55:04,338
[SPEAKER_31]: Hi everyone, this is Mr. Michi.

708
00:55:04,378 --> 00:55:10,840
[SPEAKER_31]: I'd like to welcome every sixth grader and their families and all new students to Andrews Middle School.

709

[SPEAKER_31]: I teach Italian and I welcome you to the Italian class.

710
00:55:18,904 --> 00:55:21,485
[SPEAKER_31]: So, welcome.

711
00:55:22,985 --> 00:55:29,187
[SPEAKER_31]: This is a song, it's called Felicità by Albano and Romina Power that means happiness.

[SPEAKER_04]: I teach sixth grade at the Andrews.

714
00:55:50,297 --> 00:55:57,220
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that I think makes the Andrews such a special place to go to school is all the supports that we have as students and teachers.

715
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:00,101
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a great custodial staff at the Andrews.

716
00:56:00,161 --> 00:56:03,342
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got great cafeteria workers, an incredibly dedicated group

717
00:56:03,988 --> 00:56:13,040
[SPEAKER_04]: paraprofessionals, great librarians, guidance Councilors, school psychologists, all sorts of folks that are here to make your sixth grade and your whole middle school experience great.

718
00:56:14,301 --> 00:56:15,323
[SPEAKER_21]: Hola, I'm Ms.

722
00:56:22,935 --> 00:56:29,619
[SPEAKER_09]: To know if you ever have any questions or you're confused about something in class, you can always ask either of us to stay after with you.

723
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,661
[SPEAKER_09]: We're both willing to stay after if you have any questions.

724
00:56:32,741 --> 00:56:37,865
[SPEAKER_09]: If you need to review something you didn't understand something or you just need help with your homework or project.

725
00:56:38,405 --> 00:56:42,388
[SPEAKER_09]: So don't be afraid to reach out and ask us after class.

726
00:56:42,788 --> 00:56:44,009
[SPEAKER_09]: If you need some extra help.

727
00:56:45,009 --> 00:56:49,112
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you read a camera and I are so excited to meet you guys in the fall.

728
00:56:49,734 --> 00:56:55,515

729
00:56:55,535 --> 00:56:56,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Adios!

730
00:56:56,735 --> 00:56:57,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Adios!

731
00:56:57,916 --> 00:57:01,036
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Mrs. Baptiste, and I'm the band teacher at the middle school.

732
00:57:01,476 --> 00:57:09,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Middle school is going to be a wonderful phase of your academic career, and I can't wait to see my future band students on week one.

733
00:57:09,638 --> 00:57:14,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Until then, take care, stay well, and keep practicing those instruments.

734
00:57:15,299 --> 00:57:15,660
[SPEAKER_29]: Bye!

735
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:20,306
[SPEAKER_29]: Hello future sixth graders of the Andrews Middle School grade six.

736
00:57:20,807 --> 00:57:25,153
[SPEAKER_29]: My name is Mrs. Boost and I'm an ELA teacher on side 6B.

737
00:57:25,754 --> 00:57:28,177
[SPEAKER_29]: I love the Andrews and I know that you're going to love it too.

738
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,742
[SPEAKER_29]: If I had to give you one piece of advice for the new year,

739
00:57:32,603 --> 00:57:36,028
[SPEAKER_29]: is to come in with an open mind.

740
00:57:36,669 --> 00:57:39,813
[SPEAKER_29]: We promise to take care of you and guide you.

741
00:57:40,093 --> 00:57:42,837
[SPEAKER_29]: There's really nothing to be nervous about at all.

742
00:57:43,337 --> 00:57:44,779

750
00:58:07,342 --> 00:58:08,744
[SPEAKER_28]: We have a really awesome motto.

751
00:58:08,784 --> 00:58:11,106
[SPEAKER_28]: It's called excellence through responsibility and respect.

752
00:58:11,887 --> 00:58:16,430
[SPEAKER_28]: and we abide by that in all of our facets of our school.

00:58:20,133 --> 00:58:21,554

755
00:58:22,125 --> 00:58:37,208

757
00:58:55,024 --> 00:58:58,346
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello, I'm Sarah, President of the NJHS.

758
00:58:58,866 --> 00:59:03,727
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm Lindsay, Vice President, and we are very excited to welcome you to the Andrews Middle School.

759
00:59:04,287 --> 00:59:10,649
[SPEAKER_18]: We can't wait to tell you all about it, but first, here are some messages from the NJHS talking about what to expect and a little advice.

760
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:14,831
[SPEAKER_18]: Make sure you stay kind to all peers, teachers, and other school staff.

761
00:59:15,491 --> 00:59:16,611
[SPEAKER_18]: Form good studying habits.

762
00:59:16,651 --> 00:59:18,372
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't stress, aim for a test or a quiz.

763
00:59:19,844 --> 00:59:20,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Be friendly to one another.

764
00:59:21,265 --> 00:59:22,326
[SPEAKER_10]: We're all in this together.

765
00:59:22,406 --> 00:59:24,547
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you all have a great time here at the Andrews.

766
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:30,172
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey guys, it's really important that you do your homework because homework helps you prepare for tests and quizzes.

767
00:59:31,433 --> 00:59:35,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure you're always going to class prepared with a pencil, necessary books, and materials.

768
00:59:37,397 --> 00:59:38,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't hesitate to ask teachers for help.

769
00:59:38,938 --> 00:59:39,819
[SPEAKER_11]: They're here to help you.

770
00:59:40,339 --> 00:59:45,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Most teachers stay after school to help with classwork or homework to better understand the topics you're learning.

771
00:59:46,408 --> 00:59:48,249
[SPEAKER_18]: Use your agenda and write down assignments.

772
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:49,630
[SPEAKER_18]: It will be your lifesaver.

773
00:59:50,711 --> 00:59:59,976
[SPEAKER_19]: It is very important that you stay on top of all the chapters and pages that your teacher signs for a certain book so that you do not get confused or behind on any of the homework and assignments.

774
01:00:00,976 --> 01:00:04,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Always listen to your teachers because they will provide helpful information that you don't want to miss.

775
01:00:06,199 --> 01:00:08,741
[SPEAKER_14]: Keep your lockers, notes, and everything else organized.

776
01:00:09,942 --> 01:00:12,023
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't be scared to make new friends and talk to new people.

777
01:00:12,591 --> 01:00:17,562
[SPEAKER_20]: You shouldn't fall behind or avoid your schoolwork if it is not good for you or your grades, and it will add up in the end.

778
01:00:18,764 --> 01:00:21,390
[SPEAKER_20]: To all the incoming 6th graders, have fun in middle school.

779
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:22,472
[SPEAKER_20]: It goes by super fast.

780
01:00:49,649 --> 01:00:54,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, my name is Ms.

01:00:54,053 --> 01:00:54,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Van Doyen.

782
01:00:54,894 --> 01:00:57,957
[SPEAKER_08]: I am one of the CCSR advisors at the Andrews Middle School.

783
01:00:58,077 --> 01:01:02,281
[SPEAKER_08]: I am also one of the physical education teachers, so I am looking forward to meeting you all next year.

784
01:01:02,982 --> 01:01:10,209
[SPEAKER_08]: CCSR is a project-based group that focuses on giving back to the community, and we welcome anyone to come and join us.

785
01:01:10,269 --> 01:01:12,331
[SPEAKER_08]: So I hope to see you guys join next year.

786
01:01:13,146 --> 01:01:17,870
[SPEAKER_00]: I joined CCSR in fifth grade because it was on the list of clubs and I decided to try it out.

787
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:20,191
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still in CCSR to this day.

788
01:01:20,892 --> 01:01:27,597
[SPEAKER_12]: I look forward to doing CCSR in the future because it is a place where I can do good things for others and great things for the community.

789
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:29,098
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, I'm Sophia.

790
01:01:29,478 --> 01:01:39,426
[SPEAKER_13]: For CCSR, my group did a fundraiser for an animal shelter called Skylands and basically we made it so that they could get some extra money for the proper food and shelter for their animals.

791
01:01:40,342 --> 01:01:44,806
[SPEAKER_15]: I joined CCSR because you can do really fun projects in a great environment and help out your community at the same time.

792
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:55,397
[SPEAKER_01]: I joined CCSR because I want to be part of the community and have fun and donate money for good causes.

793
01:01:56,747 --> 01:02:00,829
[SPEAKER_17]: Our project was to find ways to decorate the school to make it a happier and more cheerful place.

794
01:02:01,309 --> 01:02:09,072
[SPEAKER_17]: We did this because we feel that kids who are happy will learn better and be able to feel excited about learning in different ways.

795
01:02:09,272 --> 01:02:10,352
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi future Andrews students.

796

798
01:02:33,986 --> 01:02:39,188
[SPEAKER_32]: During this program, you'll have the opportunity to learn about environmental issues and ways to solve those issues.

799
01:02:40,049 --> 01:02:47,392
[SPEAKER_32]: You'll also have the opportunity to create some wonderful digital projects and share them with those international classmates in the eClassroom.

800
01:02:48,372 --> 01:02:55,075
[SPEAKER_32]: I am very much looking forward to meeting you all and can't wait to see you soon when you join the English community.
