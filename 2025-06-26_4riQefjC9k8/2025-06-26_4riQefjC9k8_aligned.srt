21
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:51,781
Yeah.

22
00:01:52,982 --> 00:01:56,923
Listen, Emily, our, our usual board members will not be in attendance today.

23
00:01:58,763 --> 00:02:06,025
Amanda, would you like to say hello and prompt any other city staff in attendance to say hello to members of the public.

24
00:02:07,312 --> 00:02:07,592
Sure.

25
00:02:08,192 --> 00:02:09,373
My name is Amanda Cinchella.

26
00:02:09,673 --> 00:02:13,515
I am a staff planner in the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability.

27
00:02:14,336 --> 00:02:35,107
On the call with us tonight, we have Danielle Evans, who is our senior planner, director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability, Alicia Hunt, the fabulous graduate intern, Rin Paizecki, as well as Bill Fordy, building commissioner, and our director of traffic and transportation, Todd Blake.

28
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:44,392
And I wanted to just acknowledge a quick typo that so David and I had used like a prep document to organize everything.

29
00:02:44,572 --> 00:02:46,513
And I meant to adjust.

30
00:02:47,174 --> 00:02:48,454
It's Ari Goffman Fishman.

31
00:02:50,456 --> 00:02:52,217
Oh, apologies, Ari.

32
00:02:52,257 --> 00:02:52,857
Sorry about that.

33
00:02:54,238 --> 00:02:54,778
No worries.

34
00:02:54,838 --> 00:03:00,441
It's taken three months to get the paperwork in after getting married.

35
00:03:01,902 --> 00:03:02,783
Well, congratulations.

36
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:24,034
Okay, so let's go to the first item on our agenda, which is related to 142 Mystic Ave and Great American Beer Hall public notice was shared on on this matter this is a continuation of a hearing that began last Wednesday.

37
00:03:26,975 --> 00:03:51,064
relative to an amendment to the conditionally approved say plan submitted by Brian's Arthur for the construction of a new 22,025 square foot beer hall at 142 mystic Avenue petitioner has submitted a modified site plan for the review of the board with additional design details, accommodating for the changes conditioned by the board at the October 26 public here.

38
00:03:57,013 --> 00:04:00,596
Welcome to Brian and the team.

39
00:04:01,076 --> 00:04:06,741
I thought, before we hear the latest that you want to share with us tonight.

40
00:04:07,261 --> 00:04:13,266
I thought I'd just try to frame things a little bit, members of the public or board members.

41
00:04:14,427 --> 00:04:16,289
So as you may recall section was approved.

42
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:23,715
Back in the fall, and the site plan had a certain number of conditions I'm looking at the minutes from that being in my hand here.

43
00:04:24,675 --> 00:04:30,020
And there were conditions that were labeled A through P, and we had that.

44
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:35,724
And then there were a number of things that the applicant was going to return to the board to discuss.

45
00:04:36,185 --> 00:04:48,334
And those are identified at least in our minutes here as items A through I. And so last week we were talking about a limited number of items.

46
00:04:48,715 --> 00:04:52,318
I think you've, the applicant has briefed us on

47
00:04:54,188 --> 00:05:06,996
The vast majority of these, it seemed to me that the items were just looking at my list and trying to follow that one G, which dealt with landscape buffers.

48
00:05:07,616 --> 00:05:17,782
And then we had some questions about the traffic mitigation, which was one of the points in the second grouping.

49
00:05:19,064 --> 00:05:30,730
And we had some questions about the parking circulation so I think those are the things that you're going to report to us tonight on and that will exactly.

50
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,332
Yeah, I'll just, I'll just read them out loud.

51
00:05:35,713 --> 00:05:40,235
And so the first one that was the applicant to include a landscape offers on around the main parking lot.

52
00:05:40,564 --> 00:05:45,385
And the second one was applicant to explore the use of one-way vehicle loop and angled parking throughout the site.

53
00:05:45,505 --> 00:05:52,907
And so I think we have a really good solution to this and I am going to hand it off to Michael Giuliano, our site engineer to discuss.

54
00:05:53,607 --> 00:05:53,787
Great.

55
00:05:53,807 --> 00:05:54,807
Thank you.

56
00:05:54,827 --> 00:05:57,028
This is Mike Giuliano with Eagle Brook Engineering.

57
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:58,168
Welcome.

58
00:05:58,528 --> 00:05:59,548
I have, thank you.

59
00:05:59,728 --> 00:06:02,029
I have two layouts to show you.

60
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:05,970
Can I share my screen so I can show the layouts?

61
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,150
Yes.

62
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,110
Just one moment.

63
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:14,881
Okay, you should be good.

64
00:06:27,768 --> 00:06:30,990
Okay, does everybody see the display out?

65
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:32,911
Yes, thank you.

66
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:33,711
In my cursor?

67
00:06:33,991 --> 00:06:34,291
Okay.

68
00:06:34,672 --> 00:06:41,335
So based on the last meeting, what I understood, the board wanted a buffer between the North property line and the parking.

69
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,096
And one of the

70
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:46,592
ideas was some type of angled parking.

71
00:06:47,393 --> 00:06:48,893
And I came up with two layouts.

72
00:06:49,853 --> 00:06:56,934
This angled parking is before you now, I just want to show you how it works, how it relates to the property.

73
00:06:57,494 --> 00:07:02,795
And then we have another layout, which we prefer, which I'll show you after I show you this angled parking.

74
00:07:03,915 --> 00:07:07,776
So the main aisle is still two way shown by the arrows.

75
00:07:09,276 --> 00:07:13,737
And we did angled parking in the parking area.

76
00:07:14,147 --> 00:07:19,292
where it's a one way, so you basically go past the building and then take a left into the parking area.

77
00:07:20,153 --> 00:07:27,960
The angles are at 60 degrees, the parking aisle for these angled spaces is 15 feet wide.

78
00:07:29,341 --> 00:07:36,768
And what it does is it creates a buffer from the edge of the parking to the edge of the parking lot of almost six and a half feet.

79
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:44,581
And what we also did was created three islands of green space within the parking area.

80
00:07:45,821 --> 00:07:49,142
And I think that's a layout that the board wanted to see.

81
00:07:50,082 --> 00:07:58,125
A couple of things we don't like about it is, one, it reduces the number of parking spaces by approximately 15.

82
00:07:58,185 --> 00:08:02,866
So the original layout that was submitted is 102 parking spaces.

83
00:08:02,926 --> 00:08:05,007
This layout is approximately 87 spaces.

84
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:18,895
And the other item is, I think Brian at the meeting showed you the proposed development of the north parcel that they also own, that they would like to develop at some point.

85
00:08:19,816 --> 00:08:31,003
And the angle spaces don't, you know, allow the sharing of spaces and that development to work very well, and the perpendicular works much better.

86
00:08:31,063 --> 00:08:36,187
So those are the two main reasons why, you know, we don't want to

87
00:08:37,593 --> 00:08:42,817
We don't prefer the angle spaces, but I did want to show it to you because that was obviously a request.

88
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:49,762
But what I would like to show to you is the second layout.

89
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,465
And does everybody see the second layout?

90
00:08:57,848 --> 00:08:58,088
Yes.

91
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:01,851
OK.

92
00:09:04,112 --> 00:09:04,392
And so.

93
00:09:05,905 --> 00:09:09,848
I call this the reduced main aisle layout.

94
00:09:10,228 --> 00:09:13,090
The main aisle on the original layout is 28 feet wide.

95
00:09:14,271 --> 00:09:17,394
For a two-way, that aisle can be 24 feet.

96
00:09:18,114 --> 00:09:22,757
What I did was this section of the main aisle is reduced by four feet.

97
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:31,444
By doing so, that allows us to take the entire parking area and bring itself by four feet.

98
00:09:32,618 --> 00:09:37,840
And what happens is the distance from the edge of the parking to the edge of the property line is roughly five and a half feet.

99
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,922
Creates a buffer along that north property line.

100
00:09:42,642 --> 00:09:48,184
So that, you know, this property as it stands alone has a buffer, you know, on that north side.

101
00:09:49,065 --> 00:09:56,808
Obviously at some point in the future with the development of that north parcel, that would change and there'd be some shared parking, shared aisles, whatever that development is.

102
00:09:56,828 --> 00:10:00,249
That lot is the same kind of configuration, long and narrow.

103
00:10:03,248 --> 00:10:10,593
This main aisle remains a two-way, and I show it, the parking area, as a one-way with these arrows.

104
00:10:10,894 --> 00:10:24,904
Now, it can be a two-way because the parking aisle is still 24 feet wide, but I show it as a one-way, and I don't really have a preference which way, whether it's a one-way or two-way, but there's an option to do both, but I'm showing it as a one-way with the arrows.

105
00:10:26,304 --> 00:10:29,766
And the number of spaces is reduced by two.

106
00:10:29,946 --> 00:10:35,950
And the only reason why we lose two spaces is because we opposed the three green islands within the parking area.

107
00:10:36,491 --> 00:10:39,252
So we went from 102 spaces to 100 spaces.

108
00:10:41,394 --> 00:10:44,175
This layout increases the landscape area.

109
00:10:44,195 --> 00:10:48,178
I think on the original layout, we had 9,500 square feet of landscape area.

110
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:50,079
And with this layout, we have 11,500.

111
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:51,980
So we have an additional 2,000 square feet of landscape area.

112
00:10:59,282 --> 00:11:03,723
So the reason why I like this layout is because of increasing the landscape area.

113
00:11:03,743 --> 00:11:06,724
There's a minimal reduction in the number of spaces.

114
00:11:06,744 --> 00:11:11,765
There's a lot of flexibility in the parking area to go one-way or two-way.

115
00:11:13,165 --> 00:11:17,566
I know when Brian talked to the fire department, they just wanted access to three sides of the building.

116
00:11:17,846 --> 00:11:22,247
However, a fire truck can enter the parking area if need be.

117
00:11:22,527 --> 00:11:28,268
I don't know if there would be a need, but at least there's the capability of doing that, of coming in and coming out at the other end.

118
00:11:29,976 --> 00:11:37,416
Um, and most importantly, it's going to work well with a development to the north of the property that they own.

119
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:38,519
And I.

120
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:47,299
believe at the last meeting, Mr. Blake actually kind of commented that the angle spaces don't work with that type of development next door and that perpendicular is preferred.

121
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,501
So, and I would agree with that assessment.

122
00:11:49,581 --> 00:11:59,950
So, you know, based on all the above, you know, this is the layout we would like the board to review and approve if you feel it's satisfactory.

123
00:12:04,998 --> 00:12:07,940
Okay, thank you for the presentation there.

124
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,202
I want to just be cognizant of the public comment period.

125
00:12:13,743 --> 00:12:17,685
And so, with that in mind, maybe the applicant.

126
00:12:18,425 --> 00:12:33,173
The applicant want to talk about traffic mitigation which I think was another another item or what your latest thoughts are there and trying to make sure we get everything out in the open and the public can respond to everything and then we can proceed to the discussion with the board on everything.

127
00:12:35,028 --> 00:12:37,870
Yeah, we talked about it last week.

128
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:50,521
We're going to work with MassDOT in trying to, where the Mystic app turns into two lanes to one lane, we're going to try and cut that back to where Atlas Liquors is.

129
00:12:51,021 --> 00:13:02,451
Also put a crosswalk in where the opening to 142 Mystic is now, so it's easier for bus access on the other side of the street, just makes it safer.

130
00:13:05,187 --> 00:13:05,507
Okay.

131
00:13:06,588 --> 00:13:13,334
And just a comment on that is that obviously MassDOT owns or has approval rights on that.

132
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:18,438
So whatever is presented to them, you know, they may say, well, we don't like it or we do like it.

133
00:13:18,878 --> 00:13:23,782
And so it's, you know, we're under their purview as far as whether or not, you know, something can be done.

134
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:35,357
All right, and before we go to the next step on the on the on the parking.

135
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:52,027
Do you have an idea, just in terms of describing this before the public might participate of the buffer, just going to be green space open space like maybe that that vision hasn't come to 100% fruition for you but

136
00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:58,759
Yeah, are you talking about the buffer that's to the north of the property?

137
00:13:58,779 --> 00:13:59,220
There you go.

138
00:13:59,360 --> 00:13:59,800
Exactly.

139
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,221
Yeah.

140
00:14:00,661 --> 00:14:00,841
Yeah.

141
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,603
So that that would be, you know, landscaping.

142
00:14:03,663 --> 00:14:13,532
So the landscape plan before you obviously had, there wasn't room to do the landscaping, but that area would be landscaped.

143
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:14,673
Okay.

144
00:14:17,455 --> 00:14:17,795
All right.

145
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:23,320
Amanda, could we proceed to invite the public to comment?

146
00:14:24,718 --> 00:14:27,700
Yeah, yeah, go right ahead.

147
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:45,635
Let's see, so yeah, for those who want to provide any comment, you can use the raise hand feature at the bottom of the screen, or if you wanna just make a little message in the chat, if you're not sure how to use it, the raise hand, I mean.

148
00:14:46,495 --> 00:14:47,336
feel free to do that.

149
00:14:47,876 --> 00:14:53,879
In the meantime, I'm gonna take a look at our public, our office's email account.

150
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:03,765
We had not received any emails prior to the meeting with comment, and it looks like we still have not received a further comment there.

151
00:15:04,926 --> 00:15:06,867
And you mentioned the email address, Amanda?

152
00:15:07,527 --> 00:15:15,272
Yes, and I'll just mention ocd at medford-ma.gov, and I can put that in the chat as well.

153
00:15:32,675 --> 00:15:36,137
Any other folks, any raised hands that you can see?

154
00:15:36,197 --> 00:15:37,578
I can't see from my perspective.

155
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:38,979
No worries.

156
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:39,159
Yep.

157
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,621
I see no raised hands.

158
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:42,782
I'm not seeing any comments in the chat either.

159
00:15:43,803 --> 00:15:43,943
Okay.

160
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:58,037
All right, let's move along then to the board deliberation before I invite the board to talk I should add a courtesy invite city staff if there's someone who would like to weigh in.

161
00:15:58,537 --> 00:16:00,198
If not, we'll go to the board discussion.

162
00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:03,740
If I may, please.

163
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:08,103
I thought I would just offer a little clarification.

164
00:16:08,443 --> 00:16:15,167
As you all know, we submitted a PDS memo with sort of a proposal on moving forward.

165
00:16:15,387 --> 00:16:25,132
And one of the one part of that proposal was regarding the traffic mitigation, which Brian and Michael have spoken to.

166
00:16:25,613 --> 00:16:31,696
And Michael made the mention that, you know, it is up to MassDOT to approve or

167
00:16:32,276 --> 00:16:35,959
you know, perhaps deny any proposal or plan that's sent their way.

168
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:57,334
And so the condition that we offer is, you know, in the event that either there is no response by a certain date or there is a denial of the proposal is the alternative would be that then the applicant is only responsible for the painted bump outs.

169
00:16:58,275 --> 00:16:59,696
And then in the event that

170
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:12,630
the proposal for that lane merge shift and the crosswalk shift is accepted by MassDOT, then that is the only piece that the applicant would be responsible for.

171
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,372
So excluding the bump outs.

172
00:17:18,974 --> 00:17:19,955
OK, thank you, Amanda.

173
00:17:22,158 --> 00:17:28,761
With that, let me turn it over to the board and I should clarify that our vice chair is recused from this matter.

174
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:36,365
So that leaves us with the four of us, myself, Christie, Peter and Ari.

175
00:17:39,506 --> 00:17:42,107
Any questions for the applicant?

176
00:17:43,108 --> 00:17:49,491
I would like to, I would just like to commend the applicants engineer for these plans as a speaking as a

177
00:17:50,745 --> 00:17:55,327
Traffic engineer who's worked a good few private site jobs in my time.

178
00:17:55,347 --> 00:17:59,728
These are some very nice proposals to come up with in a week.

179
00:18:00,569 --> 00:18:05,971
And I do like the shifting the drive aisle from 20 to 24.

180
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:09,172
That's a very good way to kind of come up with the extra space.

181
00:18:10,928 --> 00:18:29,546
And there's very little, I mean, I assume that was initially kept wider for delivery trucks, but there's very little in my professional experience that trucks can need 28 feet to do that they can't also do in 24.

182
00:18:29,706 --> 00:18:31,308
So I think that that shouldn't be a problem.

183
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:35,312
Thank you, Peter.

184
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:51,136
Ari, I can't see you on the screen, so I'm calling you out.

185
00:18:52,657 --> 00:18:54,538
But tell me pass if you're passing.

186
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:04,183
OK.

187
00:19:06,184 --> 00:19:07,564
Oh, technical difficulties with Ari.

188
00:19:07,584 --> 00:19:08,305
OK, no problem.

189
00:19:10,226 --> 00:19:12,707
I'd like the, I'll just.

190
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:15,892
make a couple comments and yeah, it's certainly a lot better.

191
00:19:15,912 --> 00:19:23,577
I think having the buffer is really what, you know, this was something that Clayce was raising on behalf of the board at the last meeting.

192
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:28,179
We've certainly met the ask there and that's appreciated.

193
00:19:32,261 --> 00:19:33,222
From my perspective,

194
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,515
I mean that that's more important.

195
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:41,137
I like the one way traffic flow back there I think that's that's a sharp idea.

196
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:47,958
And I just, I don't see a reason for the angled parking, and to make you have fewer, fewer spaces.

197
00:19:49,778 --> 00:19:52,379
So that's, that's my view on that.

198
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:55,100
And I'm pretty open on the mitigation I think.

199
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:05,063
what the office with the city PDF offices proposing makes some sense.

200
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:12,225
I think the crosswalks probably the best, most impactful thing that we can see here.

201
00:20:12,265 --> 00:20:16,887
I think that would really help the community and if DOT goes along with it, that'd be a nice addition.

202
00:20:16,987 --> 00:20:21,708
So those are my comments on those couple of items.

203
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:24,269
Thanks, David.

204
00:20:37,548 --> 00:20:39,409
Christy, you're good?

205
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,591
Yeah, I'm good.

206
00:20:41,811 --> 00:20:51,137
I actually appreciate the thought that went behind this and sharing the two options that have been considered.

207
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:57,661
And I think the option that's up now is reasonable and makes sense.

208
00:20:59,602 --> 00:20:59,842
Great.

209
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:04,480
And then Ari was having technical difficulties.

210
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:09,262
I'm not sure, Ari, we'd like to hear from you if you've had those ironed out.

211
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:11,243
Sure, can you hear me now?

212
00:21:11,743 --> 00:21:12,304
Oh, excellent.

213
00:21:13,144 --> 00:21:13,644
Welcome back.

214
00:21:14,665 --> 00:21:15,285
Fantastic.

215
00:21:15,705 --> 00:21:21,368
Yeah, I similarly like that you brought the two proposals with the pros and cons.

216
00:21:21,428 --> 00:21:26,210
I think this one fits all the things we were looking for last time.

217
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,231
So thanks for getting that in quickly.

218
00:21:30,337 --> 00:21:33,324
Hopefully, we can move this forward in time for your bank.

219
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:35,590
Sorry.

220
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:37,956
Okay, excellent.

221
00:21:40,212 --> 00:21:56,064
So I think we we do have, because just of the nature of the decision conditions, your report back to us and so forth, we have to kind of figure out how we're going to frame any potential decision here.

222
00:21:56,745 --> 00:22:01,288
And so we can talk about that it seems.

223
00:22:02,769 --> 00:22:12,193
let me just sort of lead the discussion and obviously those of you voting tonight if I'm going too far please jump in, pull me back, rein me in, whatever you like.

224
00:22:13,634 --> 00:22:19,896
It seems that we're feeling pretty good about the landscape buffer which was condition 1g which

225
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:24,142
I don't know that we're talking about a waiver anymore.

226
00:22:24,182 --> 00:22:30,005
I think the applicant seems to have satisfied that based on the discussion we just had.

227
00:22:33,126 --> 00:22:37,829
We want to address the mitigation piece.

228
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:50,915
And I guess if anyone on the board is inclined not to go along with the PDS recommendation, we should talk about that and kind of figure out what we want to do with that.

229
00:22:53,811 --> 00:22:59,313
There were, let's see, there was a condition about a raised crosswalk at the building entrance.

230
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,894
I think that came up at the last meeting.

231
00:23:05,274 --> 00:23:14,777
Yeah, so on the layout, I have a note saying raised crosswalk for traffic calming, which makes a lot of sense.

232
00:23:16,058 --> 00:23:23,480
And then I also added in the patio beer garden, permeable pavers in that area.

233
00:23:24,648 --> 00:23:25,749
Oh, that's a nice addition, Mike.

234
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:26,569
We appreciate that.

235
00:23:26,589 --> 00:23:29,452
And I know Emily, who's not here tonight, would especially appreciate that.

236
00:23:30,352 --> 00:23:31,753
She was focused on that for us.

237
00:23:32,934 --> 00:23:33,675
So those are good.

238
00:23:35,276 --> 00:23:45,764
You've got wayfinding, obviously, that will be consistent with the one-way traffic on part of the site and two-way on the other.

239
00:23:45,784 --> 00:23:52,228
Again, I'm just trying to brainstorm on conditions that would be relevant.

240
00:23:55,998 --> 00:24:02,744
We have maybe a question of, is this the site plan or there's also landscaping?

241
00:24:05,307 --> 00:24:07,289
So that might be a conditioner.

242
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:16,838
Amanda, if you or your colleagues want to weigh in on kind of what the updated and approved site plan might consist of.

243
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:45,793
Yeah, I think because, and others correct me if I'm wrong, but I think because this site plan is sort of addressing a couple of the things, the buffer, the one-way circulation, the raised crosswalk, and it also has that note about the permeable pavers, it may be that we could just amend the decision to designate this document as the control plan.

244
00:24:48,614 --> 00:24:49,635
Does that sound...

245
00:24:51,388 --> 00:24:58,337
like the wave and maybe, yeah, does that sound like the way forward?

246
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:21,357
My question for you on that is how do we integrate the landscaping, which I think was done on a separate color coded plan if I recall, and obviously there's a little bit more now because there's a landscape buffer so there's a little bit more greenery that always reflects on that plan.

247
00:25:22,658 --> 00:25:27,802
So we just don't want to lose sight of that as well because I don't think those features are necessarily reflected here in this plan.

248
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:50,571
Yeah, maybe could it be so designating this sheet and integration of the landscaping elements from the landscape plan provided in the April 26 submission?

249
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:50,651
OK.

250
00:25:50,671 --> 00:25:50,711
OK.

251
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:13,905
I'm furiously writing this down so we can keep track of it.

252
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:14,745
OK.

253
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:18,168
There are also a couple of- Danielle has a suggestion on that.

254
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:19,309
Excellent.

255
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:19,729
Thank you.

256
00:26:21,251 --> 00:26:22,972
Hi.

257
00:26:22,992 --> 00:26:24,173
This is Danielle.

258
00:26:24,413 --> 00:26:25,394
Danielle Evans, senior planner.

259
00:26:27,256 --> 00:26:28,577
I know that we had talked about

260
00:26:30,362 --> 00:26:33,684
replacement of trees and some of these landscaped islands.

261
00:26:34,485 --> 00:26:45,112
So they're not on this plan, but I just wanna make sure things are not precluded from being added because this is a control document.

262
00:26:47,554 --> 00:26:49,395
Was there an updated landscaping plan?

263
00:26:49,415 --> 00:26:57,801
I just wanna make sure that we're just conditioning everything that we need to condition so that no one has to come back.

264
00:27:00,497 --> 00:27:06,858
I didn't update the landscaping plan for this meeting, no.

265
00:27:09,099 --> 00:27:21,901
So I think that we can just condition that the plan will comply with the criteria for landscaping

266
00:27:27,823 --> 00:27:32,865
In large parking areas, which outlines the number of trees and.

267
00:27:36,286 --> 00:27:41,928
Maybe some some widths could be just tweaked a bit, but I don't think it's anything that needs.

268
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,950
A full redraft of a site plan.

269
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:53,933
I think they're very de minimis, so I think there could be like a. Kind of a catch all.

270
00:27:55,996 --> 00:28:03,159
To further your thought, Danielle is, as I read the conditions from the initial site plan approval.

271
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:20,669
It seems like there's room to see those requirements as part of these conditions because there is reference to the trees and plantings per landscape requirements in the city ordinance so I would think that that would give you room that when you, when you in your office, take a look at the.

272
00:28:21,969 --> 00:28:31,034
plans, ultimately, to sign off on them and confirm that they're what was approved, you'd have an opportunity to take a look at those items that you're, you just mentioned.

273
00:28:31,054 --> 00:28:33,395
Does that sound sensible to you.

274
00:28:33,935 --> 00:28:40,558
Yeah, I just want to make sure if we, you know, said something like okay this island should be increased and with slightly.

275
00:28:40,578 --> 00:28:46,721
And if that shifted something slightly like a parking space.

276
00:28:48,235 --> 00:28:49,916
we don't want everything to like blow up.

277
00:28:51,437 --> 00:29:03,763
It's pretty much, you know, it's a de minimis change, but still is, you know, satisfies, you know, the essence of everything that's being required.

278
00:29:04,704 --> 00:29:04,984
Sure.

279
00:29:05,464 --> 00:29:05,664
Okay.

280
00:29:15,133 --> 00:29:17,914
And are folks feeling okay about the traffic mitigation?

281
00:29:17,954 --> 00:29:19,695
Anyone want to speak on that point?

282
00:29:19,715 --> 00:29:21,516
Or if not, that's fine.

283
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:32,960
I think the traffic mitigation is kind of the, as with so many other roads in Medford, the best you can hope for with state controlled roadways.

284
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,541
I mean, I think what you guys have is pretty good.

285
00:29:35,921 --> 00:29:40,663
And if DOT allows it, which I hope they do, that'll be great to have.

286
00:29:42,605 --> 00:29:49,731
Peter, what's your sense, if you want to offer this, of what a reasonable deadline is?

287
00:29:50,892 --> 00:29:58,559
PDS has suggested that the applicant would put together and submit professionally prepared plans to DOT by a certain date.

288
00:29:58,579 --> 00:30:04,244
Do you have a sense of what a reasonable expectation would be there for us to

289
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:15,050
or just for the offset mitigation for the crosswalk?

290
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,790
And what else were they?

291
00:30:17,531 --> 00:30:18,551
Just refresh my memory.

292
00:30:18,591 --> 00:30:20,691
I remember the crosswalk.

293
00:30:20,711 --> 00:30:22,312
I don't know if there was anything else specific.

294
00:30:23,852 --> 00:30:30,574
I don't know that the merging of the lanes or the shift of the merge lane would require DOT involvement, but that was the other.

295
00:30:30,594 --> 00:30:30,634
OK.

296
00:30:36,452 --> 00:31:00,168
I'd say you could do probably a basic conceptual in a couple of weeks, depending on how much time there is to get it done.

297
00:31:03,918 --> 00:31:05,520
how quickly.

298
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:21,978
I mean, that's my, my thought is, I don't know how quickly if you get this to mass dot to just probably the district for traffic, what, how quickly they'd address it, even if you did get it in really quickly.

299
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:23,810
Right.

300
00:31:24,691 --> 00:31:36,295
And I think the sense of the suggestion from the, from city staff is to have a deadline to submit the materials, which, you know, demonstrate a good faith effort to try to get the darn thing approved.

301
00:31:36,335 --> 00:31:36,576
Yeah.

302
00:31:37,476 --> 00:31:40,797
I mean, I'd, I mean, I'd say, okay.

303
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:46,680
I mean, I'd say probably.

304
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,380
probably two weeks as a maximum.

305
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:58,406
I mean, that would be allow plenty of time, but still get it in pretty quickly.

306
00:31:58,426 --> 00:31:59,347
Okay.

307
00:31:59,467 --> 00:32:01,048
Maybe June 1st to give everyone.

308
00:32:01,168 --> 00:32:01,468
Oh yeah.

309
00:32:01,488 --> 00:32:04,431
That would be, that would be certainly enough time.

310
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:05,417
Okay.

311
00:32:06,197 --> 00:32:06,398
All right.

312
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:06,838
Very good.

313
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:09,679
All right.

314
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:28,007
So as we, I think, are approaching the point where we want to put together some motions for our board to consider, does the applicant, do anybody have anything else to weigh in on before we huddle here to try to get a motion together?

315
00:32:28,027 --> 00:32:34,590
Okay.

316
00:32:36,542 --> 00:32:39,186
All right, so let's see.

317
00:32:39,646 --> 00:32:44,713
I think what we're suggesting here is to...

318
00:32:51,843 --> 00:33:06,409
is to amend the previously approved site plan to replace the control plan with the one that was presented here that we've all been looking at.

319
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:14,292
With the landscaping plan, all the details from the landscaping plan

320
00:33:16,152 --> 00:33:34,244
added to this plan to consist of one controlling plan and for our approval to be conditioned on the installation of a raised crosswalk at the building entrance

321
00:33:36,772 --> 00:33:55,022
the provision of signage and wayfinding measures to control the two-way and one-way lanes in the large parking areas.

322
00:33:55,042 --> 00:34:03,047
A couple of items also in here that probably should be framed in terms of conditions, one being

323
00:34:05,023 --> 00:34:13,065
the planting plan to prioritize native species and plants with lower water needs, which sounds more like a condition than something to report back to us on.

324
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:29,971
And there was also another one on this list of the second group from our initial decision about providing the solar energy assessment in accordance with section 7.4 of the zoning ordinance.

325
00:34:31,211 --> 00:34:34,572
It should be, again, a condition, not something to report back on.

326
00:34:36,729 --> 00:34:54,221
And for the applicant to take certain measures in the category of traffic mitigation, which would be to submit, let's see,

327
00:34:56,621 --> 00:35:04,548
I want to be respectful of the city staff who put the time to frame framing this and phrasing it properly.

328
00:35:08,671 --> 00:35:09,712
Try to pull up your memo.

329
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:19,100
Okay.

330
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:56,276
So the applicant would submit a professionally prepared plan to MassDOT by June 1st of this year that would provide for

331
00:36:00,301 --> 00:36:01,702
So we have the sidewalk.

332
00:36:03,384 --> 00:36:08,549
And that is reflected on the plan Mike your plan you have the sidewalk showing there.

333
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,291
Yes, on the plan.

334
00:36:10,311 --> 00:36:21,042
Okay, we have to sell up from property line to property line along with the wheelchair access at the existing crosswalk here, and then crosswalk going across the driveway.

335
00:36:21,852 --> 00:36:22,232
Excellent.

336
00:36:22,392 --> 00:36:22,733
Okay.

337
00:36:22,853 --> 00:36:25,474
So as reflected on your plan, that would be the request.

338
00:36:26,275 --> 00:36:37,402
And also to adjust the merge lane as suggested by PDS.

339
00:36:41,585 --> 00:36:50,531
The condition would also provide that if for some reason MassDOT approval is not secured,

340
00:36:54,142 --> 00:37:10,275
that as an alternative, the applicant would be required to provide the painted bump outs identified in Director Blake's memo.

341
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:22,775
But the applicant I think would be encouraged to communicate with city staff and the board on its progress.

342
00:37:23,175 --> 00:37:31,500
If, for some reason, it believes it can still secure mass do T's approval before it proceeds to the bump outs.

343
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,300
I'm looking away because I'm checking my list.

344
00:37:52,682 --> 00:37:53,062
Okay.

345
00:38:04,846 --> 00:38:11,288
Okay, that's a long rambling amendment for approval with conditions, but

346
00:38:13,535 --> 00:38:14,976
consider that as you think about it.

347
00:38:16,016 --> 00:38:20,138
Let me acknowledge Director Blake, whose hand is raised.

348
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:22,079
How are you, sir?

349
00:38:22,939 --> 00:38:23,099
Good.

350
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:23,659
How are you doing?

351
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,020
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

352
00:38:26,481 --> 00:38:29,422
I was just going to recommend if you were searching for language.

353
00:38:30,743 --> 00:38:40,467
So my initial recommendation has one A, B, C, D, two, and I through triple I. So if I

354
00:38:41,797 --> 00:39:10,466
understand pds's suggested compromise if the board were to go with that you could probably just reference the language in my letter 1a and possibly c as well so then you wouldn't necessarily have to re reconstruct that wording and then and then if dot didn't approve that it's i from the recommendations single i so then you could just refer to those numbers or letters versus re

355
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,730
if you chose to.

356
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,691
That might be very helpful.

357
00:39:15,711 --> 00:39:16,431
I appreciate that.

358
00:39:17,791 --> 00:39:29,233
It appears that they're suggesting 1A and possibly C as the compromise that they're proposing, but I'll defer back to Amanda to make sure I'm understanding that correctly.

359
00:39:29,773 --> 00:39:35,074
And then if not, if DOT dismissed it, then it would be single I from the middle.

360
00:39:35,715 --> 00:39:37,475
So then you'd have to rewrite everything.

361
00:39:51,745 --> 00:39:54,527
Director Blake, that's the October memo.

362
00:39:54,627 --> 00:39:56,048
I'm trying to follow along.

363
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,651
Correct, October 20th, 2022.

364
00:40:00,171 --> 00:40:00,411
Okay.

365
00:40:00,492 --> 00:40:01,152
Okay, I see.

366
00:40:01,172 --> 00:40:02,753
1A and 1C.

367
00:40:22,646 --> 00:40:30,728
Again, I don't want to misrepresent what PDS said, so maybe if they could skim that quick to make sure it's accurate with their recommendation.

368
00:40:37,589 --> 00:40:39,529
Yes, sorry, if I may.

369
00:40:40,149 --> 00:40:41,510
Please, please, thank you.

370
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:47,551
Yes, so that is aligned with our recommendation, basically that

371
00:40:49,261 --> 00:41:01,729
yeah, that the decision be amended to require the applicant to submit a professionally prepared plan to MassDOT by June 1st, 2023 per mitigation items 1A and C in Director Blake's memo.

372
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:13,255
And in the event that MassDOT does not approve or is unresponsive by such a time that the applicant applies for a certificate of occupancy, which was just a,

373
00:41:14,356 --> 00:41:22,121
offered time frame, the applicant would be responsible only for providing mitigation item 2i in Director Blake's memo.

374
00:41:23,862 --> 00:41:24,183
Okay.

375
00:41:25,303 --> 00:41:29,026
If that sounds any tidier, I don't know.

376
00:41:29,066 --> 00:41:30,707
No, that sounds pretty good.

377
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:31,127
Thank you.

378
00:41:32,088 --> 00:41:36,531
I'd say just i2 was a different item.

379
00:41:37,811 --> 00:41:39,653
Sorry, the way I wrote that is confusing.

380
00:41:45,857 --> 00:41:49,942
Yes, so it's little i on the bottom of page 9.

381
00:41:50,602 --> 00:41:50,923
Correct.

382
00:41:56,148 --> 00:41:59,152
And that's describing the suggested bump-outs.

383
00:42:13,177 --> 00:42:14,638
All right, and one more question.

384
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:19,361
Mike, on your plan, does your plan show the raised crosswalk already?

385
00:42:19,381 --> 00:42:23,303
You're talking about the one in front of the main entrance?

386
00:42:23,883 --> 00:42:24,424
That's correct.

387
00:42:24,804 --> 00:42:25,004
Right.

388
00:42:25,044 --> 00:42:30,708
So here is the, you can see, here's the main entrance and then a no raised crosswalk for traffic calming.

389
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:31,668
Okay.

390
00:42:32,209 --> 00:42:32,509
All right.

391
00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:33,990
So that's already included as well.

392
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:34,910
Okay, great.

393
00:42:42,575 --> 00:42:42,795
Okay.

394
00:42:45,071 --> 00:42:49,355
Should I suggest what someone might want to present as a motion to the board?

395
00:42:52,498 --> 00:42:54,740
Okay, let's try to recap again.

396
00:42:56,101 --> 00:43:06,771
Looking to amend previously approved site plan with the revised site plan reflected here.

397
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:16,663
plus incorporation of the landscaping details from the separate landscaping plan.

398
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:20,624
Submit reference on what that is.

399
00:43:22,945 --> 00:43:29,508
Date and time of that plan, which we all have in our materials and discussed in detail in the last meeting.

400
00:43:37,744 --> 00:43:53,490
The conditions would include from the items that you're going to report back on, applicant that is, 2F and 2I, plantings and solar assessment.

401
00:43:57,291 --> 00:44:01,853
I don't think we have to have, I guess we could say the raised crosswalk at the building entrance.

402
00:44:04,157 --> 00:44:07,801
is a condition, although that's reflected on the plan, which we appreciate.

403
00:44:09,482 --> 00:44:24,757
Another condition would be the providing clear signage and other traffic wayfinding measures to address the circulation two-way and one-way of the drive lane and the large parking area.

404
00:44:31,407 --> 00:44:54,394
And then as to mitigation, the condition would require the applicant to submit a professionally prepared plan to MassDOT by June 1st of this year, seeking approval for the mitigation items identified as 1A and 1C in Director Blake's October 20th, 2022 memo.

405
00:45:01,957 --> 00:45:29,721
And if approved to perform the work, if MassDOT does not approve the proposed mitigation or is unresponsive to the proposal, by the time the applicant applies for the certificate of occupancy, the applicant would be responsible only for providing the painted bump-outs, which are mitigation item Romanet 1, bottom of page 9 of Director Blake's memo.

406
00:45:31,776 --> 00:45:50,583
but the applicant would first report to the city staff and or board to discuss progress with MassDOT in the event that approval from MassDOT is anticipated or forthcoming before proceeding with the bump out work.

407
00:45:56,727 --> 00:46:03,833
Amanda, as our master note taker, do you think I've swung and missed on issues or conditions?

408
00:46:06,575 --> 00:46:13,901
No, I think that was pretty comprehensive, just taking a last look here, but yeah, I think we've got it.

409
00:46:14,842 --> 00:46:15,162
Okay.

410
00:46:17,564 --> 00:46:24,230
So, board members, are any of you enthused enough to make a motion for that

411
00:46:27,308 --> 00:46:30,570
I will motion whatever long thing you just said.

412
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:32,611
Okay.

413
00:46:33,011 --> 00:46:37,113
I'll let the record reflect that it's in there in the record and you've made a motion.

414
00:46:37,133 --> 00:46:37,653
It's in there.

415
00:46:37,913 --> 00:46:45,657
I trust that it's in there, but I will move to approve the amendments.

416
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:46,837
The amendment and conditions.

417
00:46:46,917 --> 00:46:48,518
Yes, the amendment and the conditions.

418
00:46:49,299 --> 00:46:49,839
Is there a second?

419
00:46:49,919 --> 00:46:50,679
And I can second.

420
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:52,820
Thank you, Ari.

421
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,801
Okay, roll call vote.

422
00:46:55,922 --> 00:46:56,342
I second.

423
00:46:58,125 --> 00:46:58,565
Thank you.

424
00:47:00,326 --> 00:47:00,866
Christy down.

425
00:47:02,366 --> 00:47:02,627
Yes.

426
00:47:04,027 --> 00:47:04,687
Peter comments.

427
00:47:05,648 --> 00:47:05,928
Yes.

428
00:47:06,768 --> 00:47:07,068
All right.

429
00:47:07,088 --> 00:47:08,449
Goffman Fishman.

430
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:11,930
Yes.

431
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:12,770
Okay.

432
00:47:14,151 --> 00:47:15,111
And I'm a yes as well.

433
00:47:16,331 --> 00:47:17,412
Applicant team, how are we doing?

434
00:47:19,913 --> 00:47:20,353
That's great.

435
00:47:20,793 --> 00:47:21,653
No, thank you so much.

436
00:47:22,193 --> 00:47:26,595
Um, no, we had to come back a few times, but I greatly appreciate tonight and going.

437
00:47:29,404 --> 00:47:32,145
late Wednesday night, I greatly, greatly appreciate it.

438
00:47:34,165 --> 00:47:34,785
Well, that's great.

439
00:47:35,425 --> 00:47:36,566
Best of luck with the project.

440
00:47:36,806 --> 00:47:39,006
We look forward to seeing it come together.

441
00:47:39,126 --> 00:47:48,308
And thanks for the cooperation on the updated plans to you and especially to Mike for putting that together for us on short order.

442
00:47:48,928 --> 00:47:51,209
Love to have you guys opening that.

443
00:47:53,109 --> 00:47:53,609
Sounds good.

444
00:47:53,689 --> 00:47:55,289
All right.

445
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:56,450
Thank you.

446
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:56,850
Thanks, guys.

447
00:48:05,918 --> 00:48:06,278
Okay.

448
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,041
We do have some minutes that are available for approval.

449
00:48:11,081 --> 00:48:21,167
We had these on the agenda at the last meeting, and I now have an opportunity to examine the March 15th, 2023 minutes.

450
00:48:22,868 --> 00:48:24,729
Any comments on the minutes?

451
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:28,932
Amanda, these are the same ones that were before us at the last meeting, right?

452
00:48:28,952 --> 00:48:29,972
Correct.

453
00:48:30,633 --> 00:48:31,894
Okay.

454
00:48:31,934 --> 00:48:32,834
For myself, I read them.

455
00:48:32,874 --> 00:48:33,955
I did not have any comments.

456
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:40,923
Anyone else with comments or an alternative motion to approve the minutes?

457
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:49,710
Motion for approval.

458
00:48:51,111 --> 00:48:52,833
This is Christy, I'll make a motion to approve.

459
00:48:53,073 --> 00:48:54,314
Thank you, Christy, is there a second?

460
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,696
This is Jackie, I will second.

461
00:48:57,957 --> 00:48:58,577
Thanks, Jackie.

462
00:48:59,138 --> 00:49:03,181
Okay, so as to the minutes, roll call vote.

463
00:49:03,401 --> 00:49:04,842
Vice Chair, Jackie McPherson.

464
00:49:05,363 --> 00:49:05,563
Yes.

465
00:49:06,254 --> 00:49:06,775
Christy Dowd.

466
00:49:07,215 --> 00:49:07,456
Yes.

467
00:49:08,017 --> 00:49:08,618
Peter Kallis.

468
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:09,639
Yes.

469
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,101
Ari Goffman-Fishman.

470
00:49:12,123 --> 00:49:12,383
Yes.

471
00:49:12,904 --> 00:49:13,966
And I'm a yes as well.

472
00:49:15,088 --> 00:49:15,749
Thank you very much.

473
00:49:15,809 --> 00:49:17,832
Now we're on to miscellaneous items.

474
00:49:18,453 --> 00:49:18,753
Amanda.

475
00:49:20,176 --> 00:49:20,396
questions.

476
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:22,337
I'm going to go ahead and open it up for questions.

477
00:49:22,658 --> 00:49:25,760
I'm going to go ahead and open up the floor is yours.

478
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,220
Yes, I'll be quick.

479
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:26,320
Um.

480
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:31,463
So we do have our next meeting is May 17th and so far the only item on the agenda is actually one.

481
00:49:31,563 --> 00:49:36,727
Some of you may be familiar with, um, the site plan review for and a special

482
00:49:46,553 --> 00:50:01,957
properties and the reason I say that some of you may be familiar it's actually been before the board I think actually twice before and it had gone off to ZBA but then due to kind of

483
00:50:06,823 --> 00:50:12,825
a challenge around how the building commissioners determination for pathway.

484
00:50:13,846 --> 00:50:14,666
They have come back.

485
00:50:15,466 --> 00:50:21,148
And with the new zoning in that district, O2, there's like a slightly different pathway forward.

486
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:24,489
So if it looks familiar to some of you, it's because it is.

487
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:28,891
The project really hasn't changed since the last submission.

488
00:50:31,792 --> 00:50:43,097
And for some of you, it will be new, but it is still a site plan review and there's a special permit attached to that as well in regards to some relief so details on that to come.

489
00:50:45,337 --> 00:50:45,798
Other thing so.

490
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:52,862
I wanted to introduce something of a bit of a dilemma to the board.

491
00:50:54,023 --> 00:51:03,130
We were reached out to by Tufts on a project they're proposing for Eaton Hall, which is sort of in the heart of their campus.

492
00:51:04,191 --> 00:51:14,960
And with the recodification, a result of that was that all projects that are Dover uses

493
00:51:16,775 --> 00:51:23,521
qualify as major projects, regardless of size, which in the past, you know, you would see.

494
00:51:23,761 --> 00:51:25,002
I would caveat it.

495
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,544
It doesn't say they qualify as major projects.

496
00:51:27,724 --> 00:51:31,107
It says all projects that qualify as Dover.

497
00:51:31,207 --> 00:51:35,470
So any building permit must go to site plan review.

498
00:51:36,131 --> 00:51:43,097
And the reason I jump in and correct Amanda is because my concern is these are things that would never have come to the board

499
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:50,261
In the past, they would have been approved as of right by the building commissioner, because they're not major thing.

500
00:51:51,363 --> 00:51:53,967
Go on a minute because you kind of have this prepared this one's like 3500 square feet.

501
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:58,381
Yeah, so it's a C-shaped building.

502
00:51:59,862 --> 00:52:09,326
It's no changes intended for the building itself, except for they're kind of infilling the interior C portion of it.

503
00:52:10,686 --> 00:52:14,788
And actually that feature will make the building far more accessible and energy efficient.

504
00:52:15,988 --> 00:52:17,929
So, you know, some boons to that.

505
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:23,772
And it's yeah, otherwise, you know, besides it being a Dover use.

506
00:52:24,593 --> 00:52:33,297
Would be nowhere near touching any of the other kind of criteria that would trigger or define it as a major project in need of site plan review.

507
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:56,618
Um, so we wanted to ask you guys as a result of some of this back and forth, whether the board would be open to or would want to hear or entertain a request from the applicant to waive certain site plan review requirements or perform a sort of modified site plan review.

508
00:52:58,844 --> 00:53:17,154
And I think this could tie into a future conversation that our office would be interested in having you all with you all about whether we would want to instate some sort of whether the board would want to instate some sort of a rule of regulation, allowing them to bypass hearing some of these really small projects.

509
00:53:19,422 --> 00:53:21,402
So I'll drop it there for a second.

510
00:53:21,542 --> 00:53:27,044
The one other thing that I think is key that Amanda alluded to is this is in the middle of their campus.

511
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:30,544
So the one we just heard, you just heard Bacon Hall.

512
00:53:30,564 --> 00:53:41,247
Sorry, some of these projects are presented to me so many times that I lose track of which boards they've gone in front of versus my individual meetings with the applicants.

513
00:53:43,187 --> 00:53:46,948
That one was actually on a city street and was impacting

514
00:53:49,777 --> 00:53:50,798
the general public.

515
00:53:51,438 --> 00:54:00,924
This one, we actually had them do an analysis of who would be within 400 feet of the project, because usually you notice within 400 feet of a parcel.

516
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:14,651
But if we said who was within 400 feet of the project, there is exactly one property owner in the city of Somerville whose property is actually within 400 feet of this, because it's at the top of their hill.

517
00:54:15,092 --> 00:54:16,672
If you all know Tufts Hill, it's at the top.

518
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:21,591
I just, I feel like that's relevant because I think it's a different question.

519
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:26,994
Maybe if it's literally on a Medford street facing a street versus in the middle of their campus.

520
00:54:27,694 --> 00:54:27,854
Yeah.

521
00:54:27,894 --> 00:54:29,975
You can't even see it from a public way.

522
00:54:29,995 --> 00:54:32,996
Many people are familiar with the Tufts campus.

523
00:54:33,056 --> 00:54:37,918
It's where one of the computer labs is spent many an hour in there.

524
00:54:38,378 --> 00:54:38,559
Yeah.

525
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:46,242
I mean, I think if there's like a square, like so small for in terms of square footage and it's internal and has no visible impact.

526
00:54:50,345 --> 00:54:56,709
Yeah, it doesn't strike me as something that would necessitate a full process.

527
00:54:56,769 --> 00:54:59,991
If it is internal to Tufts campus, it's not on a public way.

528
00:55:00,051 --> 00:55:02,292
It's not impacting a public way in the city of Medford.

529
00:55:04,774 --> 00:55:06,575
It's literally on their quad.

530
00:55:06,635 --> 00:55:08,076
It's on their green space.

531
00:55:08,236 --> 00:55:11,058
Right.

532
00:55:11,318 --> 00:55:19,903
I think, philosophically, to have an institution come in and increase their expenses and just make things more expensive just

533
00:55:20,686 --> 00:55:28,929
It's just going to get passed on to students and less mitigation and benefits to the community, I feel like.

534
00:55:30,649 --> 00:55:35,450
It's expensive every time they come and have their lawyers and everything to go through a process.

535
00:55:35,551 --> 00:55:50,175
Unless this was a city like some others that require institutions to do institutional master plans and every project they do has a design review component through the planning board, it's like I don't

536
00:55:51,064 --> 00:55:57,238
A project like that doesn't seem that it should have to come through a full review.

537
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:14,294
If the board is sort of leaning that way, the way we read the zoning, and I'd be happy to have somebody else have a different opinion of the read, but because the Dover section isn't long, but it just says they must have site plan review.

538
00:56:14,694 --> 00:56:22,501
So what we think has to happen is that it has to appear on an agenda and Tufts has to present something to you and we,

539
00:56:24,389 --> 00:56:28,553
we have this discussion on an agenda with them, right?

540
00:56:28,633 --> 00:56:30,634
And you make a formal thing on that.

541
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:32,035
We can't do that tonight.

542
00:56:32,095 --> 00:56:46,367
This was sort of a making sure that that was, because if that's, if you guys, it sounds like y'all are amenable to that, then we need to figure out sort of what we should tell them maybe to sort of present this, what the project is, like do a five to seven minutes.

543
00:56:46,848 --> 00:56:47,668
Here's what it is.

544
00:56:47,748 --> 00:56:50,431
Here's the size, the scale, where it is on the campus.

545
00:56:51,071 --> 00:56:51,391
And then,

546
00:56:52,172 --> 00:57:02,674
like you all could make a motion to waive site plan review, you can make a motion to approve it, to say we waive the requirements, we waive the requirements of a detailed site plan review.

547
00:57:03,834 --> 00:57:12,476
But what I didn't want to do was if you guys tonight were like, no, they must come, then we would just advise them to file a full thing, right?

548
00:57:12,516 --> 00:57:16,097
Like, it's a big, it's an expense and it's a hassle for them.

549
00:57:17,554 --> 00:57:18,755
So could they do that?

550
00:57:18,955 --> 00:57:27,322
And I think it's tough for them as an institution, because we've tried to, I know in the past, try to encourage them not to overdo it.

551
00:57:27,362 --> 00:57:31,546
But they always bring a lot of people, which to their credit, they're taking it seriously.

552
00:57:32,526 --> 00:57:43,755
But could they really do a five minute presentation where somebody shares a screen and talks about what they're doing, and then we approve it or consider that the site plan review?

553
00:57:44,296 --> 00:57:45,497
If they can do it, I think that's great.

554
00:57:47,106 --> 00:57:55,929
I think we should double check what our there's people can ask for a waiver from site plan review from the details from submitting all these things.

555
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:06,653
And we should maybe just figure out exactly what they should ask for a waiver from and that would be a document submitted to you in advance would be part of the public record.

556
00:58:07,728 --> 00:58:12,734
They presented it to me and Amanda and Danielle in less than seven minutes, right?

557
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:16,740
So they're capable with just Rocco and their lawyer.

558
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:20,511
So what if they could do that all at once?

559
00:58:20,571 --> 00:58:28,195
They show up at the meeting, they do the five minutes and we vote, yes, we'll waive all the requirements and oh, by the way, we're gonna go ahead and approve it.

560
00:58:28,855 --> 00:58:32,797
And we're done.

561
00:58:32,877 --> 00:58:39,301
Let me ask in terms of trying to address this for long-term because we're sort of stuck with what we have now.

562
00:58:40,481 --> 00:58:48,988
Is there something that could be suggested in terms of an amendment here maybe while the city council is looking at the PDD they could they could fix something like this.

563
00:58:49,888 --> 00:59:01,657
So, we, I am talking with Zach like we had said, counselor bears about if there are some what we would consider administrative changes and I just it's this difficulty right.

564
00:59:02,663 --> 00:59:09,640
It's the difference between is this substantive versus administrative, and we all agree it has to go through the legal zoning process.

565
00:59:12,194 --> 00:59:13,514
This doesn't need a zoning study.

566
00:59:13,614 --> 00:59:17,095
This doesn't need like a massing study to tell us how it's going to impact the city.

567
00:59:17,496 --> 00:59:32,880
I think that we could ask for an amendment to the Dover section and the simplest would be to add in, sorry I didn't rethink this, the language that any project that meets the requirements of Medford's

568
00:59:33,831 --> 00:59:47,766
major projects would go through site plan review, or you could say major projects, or is visible is forward facing on a public street right if you wanted to include those.

569
00:59:47,786 --> 00:59:52,552
I just anything more than major projects is more than what we had before.

570
00:59:54,195 --> 01:00:00,662
Um, anything right that was didn't trigger our major projects definition was approved as of right by the building commissioner.

571
01:00:01,563 --> 01:00:04,886
Um, so we don't have to go all the way back to that.

572
01:00:05,987 --> 01:00:13,295
Um, but I think my opinion tops would be happy with anything that said that they didn't always have to come.

573
01:00:15,672 --> 01:00:23,674
Right, because I was really surprised when I saw this, because we were in a meeting and I was like, why is this triggering site plan review?

574
01:00:23,714 --> 01:00:26,955
This is under all of the size thresholds.

575
01:00:26,995 --> 01:00:39,739
If it was a private entity, they just get the building permit, but because it's Tufts or any other use that could qualify as a Dover amendment, all of a sudden it's subject to this.

576
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:43,820
Right, technically under this, any daycare that's small,

577
01:00:45,202 --> 01:00:49,223
which could have been done as of right, now has to come to this board.

578
01:00:50,104 --> 01:01:05,069
Yeah, I mean, I thought it was like an unintended provision, like the way that I had read it, and then I think the Tufts lawyer was like, no, I think Dabrowski did this on purpose.

579
01:01:05,878 --> 01:01:16,747
but I don't know, cause I wasn't part of that, but in my experience, you know, site plan review or Dover uses was always like an abbreviated more streamlined process.

580
01:01:18,208 --> 01:01:22,531
Our last ordinance didn't talk about Dover uses.

581
01:01:22,651 --> 01:01:33,240
So, you know, the lawyer would be like, this qualifies as, you know, as the Dover amendment use, and therefore it does not have to go through this, you know, long process or is allowed, you know,

582
01:01:34,552 --> 01:01:37,817
by right or it has, you know, can't be disapproved.

583
01:01:38,738 --> 01:01:46,049
But the fact that the threshold was lowered to everything right rather than the same standard of

584
01:01:46,591 --> 01:01:48,472
private entities?

585
01:01:49,073 --> 01:01:52,576
If it's helpful, I don't know if we can cut and paste this into the chat if it's easier.

586
01:01:52,716 --> 01:02:16,054
It says site plan review required prior to the issuance of a building permit or certificate of occupancy, the establishment, alteration, change, extension, or reconstruction of uses B3, 4, or 5 as set forth in the table of use and parking regulations shall require site plan approval from the community development board pursuant to this section.

587
01:02:16,861 --> 01:02:21,542
So this is any alteration, change, extension, or reconstruction.

588
01:02:22,062 --> 01:02:26,924
I mean, if the building commissioner wanted, he could say any time you want to pull any kind of building permit.

589
01:02:27,384 --> 01:02:35,946
But he has already said, if it's completely 100% internal, if they're doing plumbing fixtures, he's not sending it here.

590
01:02:36,306 --> 01:02:38,767
There's a level at which it was irrational.

591
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:49,042
Okay, so it sounds like there's a larger issue about where this falls on a list of potential amendments and that sort of thing.

592
01:02:49,142 --> 01:02:57,688
But at least we have kind of a consensus of trying to do something abbreviated for things like this at Tufts and maybe some other ones as well.

593
01:02:58,769 --> 01:03:06,154
Is there any sense from you all that it should be anything more than things that trigger the major projects list?

594
01:03:08,116 --> 01:03:10,061
I think that's 10,000 square feet.

595
01:03:10,081 --> 01:03:13,169
It's not any new buildings.

596
01:03:13,269 --> 01:03:15,514
It's new buildings over 10,000 square feet.

597
01:03:15,534 --> 01:03:16,717
I'd have to find it.

598
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:40,797
there was an interplay I know in the daycares between the large ones and the small ones and and the large ones we wanted to have some site plan review I mean the thing that strikes me about Dover is that Dover can drop things you don't plan to have in your district into your district so you know I think there was a sense that some of these things yeah can't be heavily regulated but maybe maybe some more of them should have

599
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:58,312
know an opportunity for neighbors to be heard and some public discussion and that sort of stuff so I just don't know that you know 10,000 square feet is really the right cut off I agree with you there is definitely a line out there in a way, somehow, to define what's de minimis but

600
01:03:59,266 --> 01:04:04,892
It might be major project or new building, a new construction.

601
01:04:06,854 --> 01:04:16,223
If Tufts was about to put a new 5,000 square foot building in the middle of their campus that we don't see, would we want to have a hearing on it?

602
01:04:16,243 --> 01:04:19,346
I don't know.

603
01:04:19,746 --> 01:04:21,408
That's the house size, right?

604
01:04:21,488 --> 01:04:22,269
It's a large house.

605
01:04:25,748 --> 01:04:37,013
I guess I think maybe we should leave it at people should think about this and we should have another discussion because if it goes into changing zoning, it's gonna come in front of this board for review.

606
01:04:37,713 --> 01:04:43,376
It's in my mind better if it's gonna be something that's under your purview.

607
01:04:43,716 --> 01:04:49,679
If the proposal that goes in for the change, you're already in agreement with, you already have thought about it a little.

608
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:59,071
Like, I don't want to, our office propose something about how you do business that you fundamentally disagree with.

609
01:04:59,411 --> 01:05:03,053
So we should think about it and bring it up again before we make the proposal.

610
01:05:04,813 --> 01:05:19,720
Yeah, so I would have it, you guys should probably, you know, take a look at section 94-11.7.2 applicability, which is what says what's a major project and what is subject to site plan review in general.

611
01:05:21,410 --> 01:05:32,332
And I almost feel like that the Jover uses, which I noticed that there is not a section on applicability, it just kind of goes into changes.

612
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:49,535
But maybe think if there's Jover uses, like David, you were saying about like the larger daycares, like what kind of threshold you might want to require.

613
01:05:52,432 --> 01:05:59,357
Yeah, so I think there was an interplay there with the use table, but that's, again, my recollection.

614
01:05:59,417 --> 01:06:00,958
I'm not obviously looking at it right now.

615
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:08,924
It's something we can certainly put some more thought into, no doubt.

616
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:24,248
Oh yeah, it's churches, don't forget that Dover is churches, B3 is religion, B4 is educational purposes, and B5 is child care center or school age child care program.

617
01:06:24,268 --> 01:06:39,397
I feel like if it's the creation of a new facility, like maybe you'd want to take a look at it, but if it's always been there and they're just like doing something to make an improvement to it, then

618
01:06:41,413 --> 01:06:42,734
seems like overkill.

619
01:06:42,755 --> 01:06:45,978
Depends if it has impact.

620
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:53,586
Like a new large daycare, which is only 10 kids, by the way, a large family daycare, 10 kids, that's it.

621
01:06:54,607 --> 01:06:55,408
It's not that big.

622
01:06:55,808 --> 01:07:03,917
So maybe that would require site plan review.

623
01:07:07,917 --> 01:07:16,461
if it was new, but if it's already there and they just want to add an addition so that they can have a separate place for infants to sleep, then why would we need no increased enrollment?

624
01:07:18,462 --> 01:07:20,663
Well, at least between now and an amendment.

625
01:07:20,723 --> 01:07:20,963
Right.

626
01:07:21,104 --> 01:07:27,146
We can think about it later, but I'll actually point out that our section on Dover does not reference daycares.

627
01:07:28,367 --> 01:07:32,009
Daycare is under K, accessory uses.

628
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:39,383
And as family, you're thinking of family daycare, so it's considered an accessory use.

629
01:07:40,084 --> 01:07:54,352
And literally our thing references B3, 4, and 5, which is religion, schools, and childcare centers.

630
01:07:54,852 --> 01:08:01,416
But the accessory use, the family daycare, a home, large or small, is not

631
01:08:03,077 --> 01:08:05,199
mentioned in our Dover section.

632
01:08:08,142 --> 01:08:15,010
So they may be covered by Dover, but our section doesn't require site plan review for them.

633
01:08:19,895 --> 01:08:25,661
Interesting that it's only an accessory use because there are family daycares that are in units by themselves.

634
01:08:26,917 --> 01:08:27,878
Put it on the list.

635
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:31,920
Sorry, that's my answer to Daniel.

636
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,542
How many pages is our list now?

637
01:08:33,562 --> 01:08:39,466
I mean, it's gotta be like 50 pages of things we need to change.

638
01:08:39,946 --> 01:08:40,526
Okay.

639
01:08:40,766 --> 01:08:43,588
Unintended consequences, domino effects.

640
01:08:43,608 --> 01:08:51,834
So if you change one little thing here and it's just ripples and you only find them when you're applying it to each case.

641
01:08:52,214 --> 01:08:52,815
So yeah.

642
01:08:53,953 --> 01:08:58,038
Well, speaking of lists, Amanda, how are we doing on our list of miscellaneous items?

643
01:08:59,380 --> 01:08:59,960
Nearly there.

644
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:06,749
I'm just going to mention that tomorrow over Zoom, there is a Tufts community meeting in case anyone is interested.

645
01:09:06,849 --> 01:09:07,850
It's at 6pm.

646
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:11,094
I think they're going to be speaking to kind of a lot of sort of

647
01:09:13,278 --> 01:09:22,442
Yeah, different, I think at a larger, larger scale rather than just like project specific things tough tough intentions for future in the city.

648
01:09:22,703 --> 01:09:26,664
So, city details on that in the city calendar.

649
01:09:27,065 --> 01:09:27,785
And that's all I've got.

650
01:09:27,805 --> 01:09:29,426
Okay, great.

651
01:09:31,447 --> 01:09:33,908
Ready motion for adjournment unless anyone else has.

652
01:09:34,517 --> 01:09:39,579
Oh, I want to tell you, we've given and had two job offers received for our office.

653
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:45,420
So CDBG Manager has been filled and the Housing Planner position has been filled.

654
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:53,002
CDBG Manager starts May 15th and Housing Planner a week later, May 22nd.

655
01:09:53,723 --> 01:09:54,143
Yay.

656
01:09:54,783 --> 01:09:59,044
And I hope to have the Economic Development Planner position posted any day now.

657
01:09:59,104 --> 01:10:01,325
I actually need to go nag that one.

658
01:10:03,543 --> 01:10:03,983
That's great.

659
01:10:04,984 --> 01:10:05,344
Thank you.

660
01:10:07,986 --> 01:10:08,466
Any others?

661
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:09,827
If not.

662
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:14,350
Motion to adjourn for today.

663
01:10:16,232 --> 01:10:16,412
Ms.

664
01:10:16,452 --> 01:10:18,093
Chrissy, I'm making a motion to adjourn.

665
01:10:19,294 --> 01:10:20,014
And is there a second?

666
01:10:21,115 --> 01:10:21,515
I second.

667
01:10:22,336 --> 01:10:22,916
Thank you, Peter.

668
01:10:23,496 --> 01:10:23,997
Roll call.

669
01:10:24,577 --> 01:10:26,078
Vice Chair Jackie McPherson.

670
01:10:26,679 --> 01:10:26,959
Yes.

671
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:28,740

01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:29,541

01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:36,272
And I'm a yes as well.

678
01:10:36,292 --> 01:10:37,878
All right, thanks very much.
