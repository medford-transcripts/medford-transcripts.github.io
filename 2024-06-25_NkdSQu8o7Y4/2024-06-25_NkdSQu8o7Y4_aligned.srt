00:00:00,349 --> 00:00:07,413
New tonight here at 11 o'clock, a victory for Medford neighbors who fought to keep a methadone clinic from opening near a school there.

2
00:00:07,854 --> 00:00:12,016
But as Brandon Truitt shows us, that clinic may still open in their neighborhood.

3
00:00:12,697 --> 00:00:18,500
This company applied for a special permit back in April and ever since residents have really been pushing back against the idea.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,283
Tonight, a small win with that company rescinding its request for now.

5
00:00:23,877 --> 00:00:30,578
And it's very tough because I actually walk my children to parks, to school every day, as do many other parents in the neighborhood.

6
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:34,614
Breanne Gallagher has her hands full with two kids under the age of five.

7
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:38,336
She just so happens to live right down from Salem Street.

8
00:00:38,576 --> 00:00:41,038
That's where a methadone clinic hoped to set up shop.

9
00:00:41,558 --> 00:00:48,183
It's just a few blocks from an elementary school, park and businesses with hundreds of families living nearby.

10
00:00:48,203 --> 00:00:54,667
I think it's tough to provide the right meaningful dialogue on that to children that are that young.

11
00:00:55,191 --> 00:01:00,539
especially elementary school children, which is primarily the kids that you see walking around at that time of day.

12
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:11,865
According to a study that measured the center's potential impacts, the facility would consist of a reception area, medical exam rooms, and an in-house dispensary overseen by a medical director.

13
00:01:12,426 --> 00:01:17,571
It was the dispensary service that drove dozens to show up at Tuesday's city council meeting.

14
00:01:17,991 --> 00:01:25,358
Residents were set to express concerns, but it was announced the company, Habit Opco, had rescinded its request.

15
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:31,184
The company, which operates methadone centers in Springfield and Boston, cited community feedback.

16
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:34,507
Nobody was against the process of helping people.

17
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:48,081
But what everybody was looking for was making sure that this facility or a facility like this would be put in a location where it didn't affect residential inhabitants.

18
00:01:48,996 --> 00:02:04,868
In its letter to the City Council, the company says it's not closing the door on a treatment center in Medford, saying, quote, we look forward to working with the city to find an appropriate location for a CTC and thank all those who have provided helpful insights over the last two months.

19
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:07,350
And this fight is not over.

20
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:14,795
People who came to the City Council meeting, making one thing clear, they do not want a dispensary like this anywhere in this city.

21
00:02:15,356 --> 00:02:17,437
In Medford, Brandon Truitt, WBZ News.

22
00:02:17,617 --> 00:02:18,338
Brandon, thank you.
