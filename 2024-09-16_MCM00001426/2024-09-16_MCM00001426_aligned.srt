1
00:00:01,626 --> 00:00:03,007
Welcome everyone to the meeting.

2
00:00:04,427 --> 00:00:10,390
The other two members of our subcommittee are going to try to come late.

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:20,995
So, but first of all, did you all look over the minutes from our July 29th, I think it was?

4
00:00:21,035 --> 00:00:21,715
Yeah.

5
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:23,316
Are we good?

6
00:00:23,896 --> 00:00:24,176
Great.

7
00:00:25,497 --> 00:00:26,017
All in favor?

8
00:00:26,037 --> 00:00:26,837
Aye.

9
00:00:27,377 --> 00:00:27,698
Great.

10
00:00:28,298 --> 00:00:28,618
Okay.

11
00:00:29,335 --> 00:00:36,777
So they were brief, and we're really coming to the end here, which is exciting.

12
00:00:38,297 --> 00:00:41,638
So I thought the minutes might be useful.

13
00:00:41,698 --> 00:00:48,700
We could sort of look at them and see if we completed our tasks from the last meeting, and then we can see what else we need to do.

14
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,041
So the first thing was to include survey demographics.

15
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:54,301
I checked with Danielle.

16
00:00:57,128 --> 00:01:06,210
David is putting together the pie charts, which hopefully he's going to actually also create pie charts for the demographics.

17
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,611
Because last meeting we said we wanted to do that, right?

18
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,972
You gave me- Did he send something today?

19
00:01:14,012 --> 00:01:14,352
He did, yeah.

20
00:01:14,372 --> 00:01:18,413
He did, but- You also gave me a demographic, so they're in the-

21
00:01:19,738 --> 00:01:21,419
I put it in the community engagement.

22
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:22,679
Oh, that's good.

23
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,260
OK.

24
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,001
Do we care if we have pie charts?

25
00:01:28,181 --> 00:01:28,641
No.

26
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:31,242
No, I'm with you, Jean.

27
00:01:31,362 --> 00:01:32,883
I don't think it's a make or break.

28
00:01:33,023 --> 00:01:33,343
OK.

29
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:35,604
I mean, they could be in.

30
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:37,484
Go ahead.

31
00:01:39,145 --> 00:01:42,866
We're going to have a survey appendix, right?

32
00:01:43,566 --> 00:01:44,027
Yeah.

33
00:01:44,127 --> 00:01:47,228
So do you think we should just put the pie charts in the appendix?

34
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:48,956
I think so.

35
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:51,338
The survey report as part of the appendix?

36
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:52,238
Yeah.

37
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,001
Okay.

38
00:01:56,942 --> 00:02:00,285
I said I was going to add public comments to the issue sheets, which I did.

39
00:02:00,305 --> 00:02:03,368
You did?

40
00:02:03,608 --> 00:02:06,611
Then I should update those numbers because I took it.

41
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:13,557
Remember I had how many comments we received overall.

42
00:02:14,102 --> 00:02:25,846
Yeah, I definitely added, so what I did was I went through all the survey, well I added whatever public comments that we hadn't added in, which there were a few, and then there were a bunch of comments on the survey.

43
00:02:26,886 --> 00:02:27,246
Okay.

44
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:32,408
Because remember, in addition to completing the survey, people were invited to comment.

45
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:33,489
Yeah.

46
00:02:33,749 --> 00:02:35,989
So, and I think that I,

47
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:41,298
Where is that document?

48
00:02:41,638 --> 00:02:57,347
I think I reflected in the, I'm trying to find it so I can make sure that I did, but in the actual document that they were comments that were gotten from the survey.

49
00:02:57,587 --> 00:02:57,987
Here we go.

50
00:02:59,408 --> 00:03:03,110
Yeah, because I say we received approximately 900 pieces of feedback

51
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:10,999
Does that include the survey?

52
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,461
No.

53
00:03:13,621 --> 00:03:14,522
OK.

54
00:03:14,982 --> 00:03:16,423
So then the survey is 600.

55
00:03:19,045 --> 00:03:19,965
OK.

56
00:03:20,546 --> 00:03:20,826
Oh, no.

57
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:21,947
It does include the survey.

58
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:24,189
That includes a survey.

59
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:25,089
OK.

60
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:30,633
So on the issue sheet, I thought I had all the code.

61
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:31,074
OK.

62
00:03:31,174 --> 00:03:31,534
I don't know.

63
00:03:31,554 --> 00:03:35,357
I don't know what I did, because it looks weird to me.

64
00:03:35,377 --> 00:03:36,778
But you look at it and see.

65
00:03:38,638 --> 00:03:42,341
Article two, yeah, I put the, okay, yeah, there we go.

66
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:45,184
It's just the preamble that didn't look right.

67
00:03:45,864 --> 00:03:58,835
So if you look at it, you can see that there's, like on the left where it's got emails, June 8th public hearing emails, form, so the comments we got from the email form.

68
00:03:59,336 --> 00:04:04,760
Yeah, circle to square, right spawn, and then at the end there's survey, and there's quite a lot of comments there.

69
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:10,189
So I don't know that I'll, because I said that I include this survey in my 900.

70
00:04:10,589 --> 00:04:11,069
Yeah.

71
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:13,150
Oh, you don't have to change it.

72
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,850
But I don't think I'll change that.

73
00:04:15,051 --> 00:04:18,192
But we're going to include that in our final report, right?

74
00:04:18,752 --> 00:04:20,473
The issue sheets?

75
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:21,273
Yeah.

76
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:27,155
I thought we were going to try it so it wouldn't be so big to put a link in there.

77
00:04:27,175 --> 00:04:28,596
We're going to do a link.

78
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:29,416
Yeah, right.

79
00:04:29,476 --> 00:04:29,916
Exactly.

80
00:04:30,016 --> 00:04:31,036
To the issue sheets.

81
00:04:31,357 --> 00:04:31,717
Yeah.

82
00:04:31,877 --> 00:04:31,977
OK.

83
00:04:35,073 --> 00:04:37,154
Okay, so that piece was done.

84
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:39,574
What else did we do?

85
00:04:40,894 --> 00:04:45,095
Oh, you were going to revise Article 8 recommendations to separate out recall?

86
00:04:46,155 --> 00:04:46,715
I did that.

87
00:04:46,735 --> 00:04:47,655
Okay.

88
00:04:49,316 --> 00:04:50,456
I'm pretty sure I did.

89
00:04:50,596 --> 00:04:55,177
Let me double check.

90
00:04:55,277 --> 00:04:57,237
I don't think I have finalized all the footnotes.

91
00:04:58,357 --> 00:05:01,018
So that, I was just,

92
00:05:02,747 --> 00:05:08,251
I have to get the footnotes for the award representation, diversity.

93
00:05:08,271 --> 00:05:10,392
Yeah, I have to get a few more footnotes.

94
00:05:10,712 --> 00:05:13,114
And I gave you some suggestions, if it helps.

95
00:05:13,674 --> 00:05:13,914
Yeah.

96
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:14,595
OK.

97
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:15,415
So that we need.

98
00:05:15,635 --> 00:05:21,079
So we still need to get footnotes.

99
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:27,643
And I sent you that Mass General Law on the budget, right?

100
00:05:28,624 --> 00:05:29,024
You did.

101
00:05:37,868 --> 00:05:41,791
It's been a while, so I'm just trying to remember what that related to.

102
00:05:41,811 --> 00:05:45,173
Oh, yeah.

103
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:48,255
I put it in section six.

104
00:05:48,596 --> 00:05:49,016
Right, right.

105
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:49,917
Yeah.

106
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:50,317
Yeah.

107
00:05:50,797 --> 00:05:52,338
Put the link in.

108
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:53,279
OK.

109
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,582
And there's a bunch of stuff in the appendix.

110
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:57,823
Maybe we'll add more to it.

111
00:05:57,863 --> 00:06:00,344
Maybe ultimately we'll decide not to include some of it.

112
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:00,785
I don't know.

113
00:06:00,845 --> 00:06:03,327
But there's a bunch of stuff in the appendix folder.

114
00:06:05,562 --> 00:06:07,624
We need to just put it together.

115
00:06:08,444 --> 00:06:14,329
So we also, the other thing I didn't do was ask, we were going to ask if anybody has photos.

116
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:15,650
What do you think?

117
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,071
Do we want to try to do?

118
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:21,594
I mean, it might make a report look nice if we had pictures, but yeah.

119
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:22,355
A few pictures.

120
00:06:22,455 --> 00:06:27,999
Again, if we have a lot of pictures, maybe set up a link, different events with a bright spawn.

121
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,021
Well, we definitely don't have a lot of pictures.

122
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:32,122
I know we don't.

123
00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:34,655
Do we have any pictures?

124
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:35,476
I know.

125
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,036
I don't recall taking.

126
00:06:37,056 --> 00:06:40,137
Stay away from it.

127
00:06:40,698 --> 00:06:41,218
Do we care?

128
00:06:41,238 --> 00:06:42,478
Not really.

129
00:06:42,858 --> 00:06:44,359
Then let's not worry about it.

130
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:52,262
Because even if we did get pictures from events, we don't necessarily have permission from all the people in the pictures to use them.

131
00:06:53,342 --> 00:06:54,623
One thing we could do is,

132
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,042
We do have a banner that we used at events.

133
00:07:00,102 --> 00:07:06,707
If I could somehow put that into a photo and make it a JPEG, we could maybe put that on the cover of the report.

134
00:07:07,808 --> 00:07:08,809
I mean, I don't know.

135
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:09,569
It's just an idea.

136
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,012
I'll try to see if I can capture the banner.

137
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:17,895
So it would be sort of like using it as a logo.

138
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:24,117
I mean, we'll want to put Medford's logo on there, right?

139
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:29,260
I think we should put Gene out there as a logo for all the work you've done.

140
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,323
Yeah, and Milva.

141
00:07:34,683 --> 00:07:40,607
OK, well, I don't know if that's going to work, but we'll see.

142
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:49,633
So Gene, do you have any other thoughts on what else we need to do in terms of actual content?

143
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:58,056
I mean, there's the appendices like the survey.

144
00:07:58,076 --> 00:08:01,697
Is there going to be like a survey report?

145
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:02,498
Is David?

146
00:08:02,518 --> 00:08:06,399
I don't know if David is going to do that.

147
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:09,740
He said he was going to do a survey report.

148
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,281
He's making pie charts.

149
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:15,802
I don't know if that there's going to be any text in it.

150
00:08:17,102 --> 00:08:19,283
So it might just be here's a bunch of

151
00:08:20,817 --> 00:08:21,198
data.

152
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:29,650
I mean, I was thinking about that, but in your community engagement, there is information about the survey.

153
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:33,235
So I think that's probably sufficient.

154
00:08:33,315 --> 00:08:36,540
And that if we just put the graphics in, what do you think?

155
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:42,946
put the graphics in the appendix.

156
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:47,228
Yeah, because we're also going to put the questionnaire, right?

157
00:08:47,268 --> 00:08:50,409
We'll put the blank questionnaire we talked about.

158
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,029
For the survey?

159
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,030
Yeah, the survey.

160
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:58,131
I have to get that from Danielle, see if I can pull that off.

161
00:09:01,212 --> 00:09:04,153
If they would just pull that off the Google survey.

162
00:09:06,474 --> 00:09:07,895
OK, we'll get that.

163
00:09:10,303 --> 00:09:17,226
I think what you put in the community engagement report about the survey is good.

164
00:09:17,586 --> 00:09:21,287
So probably enough in terms of just writing a little text about it.

165
00:09:22,568 --> 00:09:28,230
I mean, if Javid wants to write some sort of analysis, that's fine.

166
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,331
But I don't know that he will.

167
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:31,311
But I don't know.

168
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:32,172
We'll see.

169
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:40,283
And then, you know, I mean, the recommendations have been read through, right?

170
00:09:40,443 --> 00:09:47,566
I added the, I added one to the major recommendations.

171
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:53,009
I added, because we, I put Institute of Financial Reporting Requirement for elected and other officials.

172
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:58,392
And I need to see if I need to add to Article 9 too.

173
00:09:59,907 --> 00:10:04,169
Were there any other changes we voted on recently that we need to talk about?

174
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:06,070
There's the financial reporting.

175
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,811
There's the.

176
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:10,792
Oh, I put it's okay.

177
00:10:10,832 --> 00:10:11,112
Go ahead.

178
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:11,332
Sorry.

179
00:10:15,033 --> 00:10:20,215
That's all there was the vote on, you know, replacing a vacant position.

180
00:10:20,235 --> 00:10:23,656
I don't know that's kind of in the weeds with city council school committee.

181
00:10:24,336 --> 00:10:30,299
Yeah, I felt like the only one that was big enough to put in the major recommendations was the financial disclosures.

182
00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:30,779
Okay.

183
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:31,739
What do you think?

184
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,841
Yeah, I just can't remember all the things.

185
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:40,755
Yeah, I mean, remember, but I, you have a good memory.

186
00:10:41,996 --> 00:10:45,677
I thought that was really the only one that we should have, like, sort of pulled out.

187
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:56,023
The other ones are more sort of like, you know, I'm not saying they're minor, but, you know, um,

188
00:10:57,785 --> 00:11:02,087
They're more sort of standard business, you know, standard practice kind of things.

189
00:11:03,087 --> 00:11:06,008
Okay, so that I added.

190
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:13,992
I don't think there's anything else we need to add since the main thing was the financial disclosures.

191
00:11:15,222 --> 00:11:17,243
In that section nine, right?

192
00:11:17,263 --> 00:11:20,244
So do we have a write up in section nine about that?

193
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:21,584
Yeah, I mean, it's very short.

194
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:25,486
It just says requirement for annual financial disclosures.

195
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:36,190
The committee recommends that elected officials and some city officials be required to submit an annual financial disclosure form to be generated and overseen by an ethics commission.

196
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:37,070
Okay.

197
00:11:38,391 --> 00:11:41,032
And then, you know, they can read the details in the draft chart.

198
00:11:44,964 --> 00:11:54,031
Okay, so adding the footnotes, other than adding the footnotes, I think we're good.

199
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:55,772
I mean, I'll probably read it over.

200
00:11:55,892 --> 00:12:02,237
I was just reading over the introductory letter and making a little few changes, you know, changing some wording and stuff.

201
00:12:03,478 --> 00:12:05,559
I'm probably going to do that until the end.

202
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:08,261
Did the full committee weigh it?

203
00:12:08,842 --> 00:12:11,484
Oh, no, we're going to send it to them once we put it all together.

204
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:17,792
I mean, I sent them the draft versions, but nobody had anything to say.

205
00:12:17,812 --> 00:12:18,892
I don't think anybody read it.

206
00:12:18,912 --> 00:12:21,013
I think they were too busy working on their draft charter.

207
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:41,203
So the idea is that the Collins Center is going to get the revised draft charter with the typos fixed and the things that we added since they sent us the draft charter and the changes that we made.

208
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:51,675
I've asked them to get that to me within the next week to two weeks so that I'm going to proofread it one more time.

209
00:12:51,695 --> 00:13:02,746
Then if we can get this final report part together, we would just put it all in one package and send it to the committee and then we can

210
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:27,845
at our meeting in October, which would be, which is our final meeting, we will just see if anybody has any, I mean, the same thing we did for the draft charter, I don't expect there to be any big, but you know, any big things that we're gonna, but maybe somebody will say, why didn't we say this in the recommendations or, you know, so we'll see.

211
00:13:27,865 --> 00:13:28,145
Yeah.

212
00:13:28,885 --> 00:13:30,787
Oh, I'm sure someone will say something.

213
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:34,269
But I don't think it'll take more than one week.

214
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:35,590
I don't think.

215
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,332
As long as they're not trying to re-vote on the charter.

216
00:13:39,313 --> 00:13:41,235
Yeah.

217
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,037
That part is done.

218
00:13:45,378 --> 00:14:00,069
It's just a question of whether anybody thinks that they don't like the wording in the final report or mostly I think it will be if somebody thinks there should be something else added to the recommendations or we should pull this out and emphasize it.

219
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:04,196
So because I'm pulling it all together.

220
00:14:04,216 --> 00:14:04,296
Yeah.

221
00:14:05,597 --> 00:14:07,658
So that's what I was going to ask.

222
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,040
And you have whatever your software you're going to use?

223
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,641
I was just going to do Microsoft Word.

224
00:14:14,661 --> 00:14:16,182
Yeah, as long as it looks.

225
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,643
I don't care as long as it looks decent.

226
00:14:19,143 --> 00:14:26,886
They have templates that you can have a title and table of contents and appendices and stuff.

227
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:27,787
That's awesome.

228
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,671
So do you need any help?

229
00:14:33,231 --> 00:14:34,071
What do you need for that?

230
00:14:35,191 --> 00:14:38,312
It'd be good if everything is done.

231
00:14:38,392 --> 00:14:40,392
So I think you're doing the footnotes.

232
00:14:40,812 --> 00:14:41,132
Yeah.

233
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,792
I'll do that.

234
00:14:44,113 --> 00:14:45,453
Let me give myself a deadline.

235
00:14:47,573 --> 00:14:47,993
Let's see.

236
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,254
Today's the 12th.

237
00:14:49,654 --> 00:14:54,114
Monday is the 17th.

238
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:56,695
Let me do it by the 18th.

239
00:14:58,123 --> 00:14:58,383
Okay.

240
00:14:59,784 --> 00:15:16,633
And then possibly you could start putting some things together like the, you know, the, the beginning, if, if I can manage to get an image of the banner, otherwise you can probably do something graphic like with Microsoft word.

241
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:25,958
Um, but there's, um, the members, you know, that little, well, we're going to put all the members at the beginning.

242
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:33,245
How do you want the, like what's the order that we want?

243
00:15:33,685 --> 00:15:35,406
Well, I put it in there.

244
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:44,513
What I'm wondering is, yeah, no, I think it's better to put it at the front as opposed to at the end of the introductory letter.

245
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:45,774
I think that makes more sense.

246
00:15:46,314 --> 00:15:49,236
So there'll be a title page, table of contents.

247
00:15:50,357 --> 00:15:52,458
Yeah, and then we'll show the members.

248
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:54,960
Members, then introductory letter.

249
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,190
Yeah.

250
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,972
And then I think major recommendations.

251
00:16:02,692 --> 00:16:03,012
Yeah.

252
00:16:03,392 --> 00:16:08,874
What about the appendix is until the end.

253
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:09,114
Yeah.

254
00:16:09,154 --> 00:16:11,695
So then introductory major recommend, wait a minute.

255
00:16:11,895 --> 00:16:14,956
Introductory letter comes before major recommendations, right?

256
00:16:15,436 --> 00:16:15,656
Yeah.

257
00:16:17,097 --> 00:16:19,297
And then do you think the community engagement summary?

258
00:16:20,738 --> 00:16:24,539
No, maybe the community engagement summary should come before major recommendations.

259
00:16:26,002 --> 00:16:26,282
Okay.

260
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:26,723
Yeah.

261
00:16:26,883 --> 00:16:27,423
What do you think?

262
00:16:27,463 --> 00:16:28,164
Does that make sense?

263
00:16:29,685 --> 00:16:30,406
Yeah, I think so.

264
00:16:30,426 --> 00:16:42,717
Because then after major recommendations, you want to go into the- Then you go into each article, which we don't have any for Article 1, which hopefully, you know, no one's going to be like, what's going on?

265
00:16:42,737 --> 00:16:45,660
But Article 1 is just definitions.

266
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,160
Right.

267
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,464
I mean, the only major recommendation we have for Article 1 is to include an article

268
00:16:53,151 --> 00:16:57,674
Because we don't have one in our current charter, but I don't think it's worth, yeah, we'll just leave that.

269
00:16:58,675 --> 00:17:02,217
And then after that would be the full charter?

270
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:03,738
Yes.

271
00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:05,039
OK.

272
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,381
I think, yeah.

273
00:17:08,421 --> 00:17:10,723
And I think the appendix goes at the very end.

274
00:17:11,744 --> 00:17:14,285
Yeah.

275
00:17:14,425 --> 00:17:18,048
So that's the table of contents materials, right?

276
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:28,161
When we get to the appendix, you know, you can make, you can use your judgment in terms of how to arrange what's in the appendix.

277
00:17:29,503 --> 00:17:29,743
Okay.

278
00:17:30,343 --> 00:17:37,350
The thing, for footnotes, we are, we're just going to

279
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:43,049
Footnote within the text that we're footnoting right those don't go at the end.

280
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:44,229
No, I don't.

281
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:49,251
I think it's easier for the reader, since there aren't any just to have it in the.

282
00:17:49,371 --> 00:17:50,252
Yeah, I agree.

283
00:17:54,142 --> 00:17:55,543
Let's see if I can remember.

284
00:17:55,563 --> 00:18:20,302
Oh, like in the introductory letter, there was reference to, like, we're including a couple of the, we're including the generic modern charter in the appendix that we used as a guide, and we're including the, some memos from the Collins Center, and they're, like, I can change it and take them out, but I made reference to them in the introductory letter,

285
00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:36,468
I put in parentheses appendix number x. But we could take out that if you think it's- No, I can even put a hyperlink so if people want to- Yeah, if you wanted to do that.

286
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:37,849
That would be awesome.

287
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,450
Yeah.

288
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:39,951
Okay.

289
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:41,352
All right.

290
00:18:41,492 --> 00:18:46,857
So that's all you need, just the actual content.

291
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:56,714
Yeah, I think by the time I get into it, I'll probably find questions or something.

292
00:18:57,574 --> 00:19:03,898
And if it would be helpful, I mean, maybe it's just easier for you to do it on your own.

293
00:19:03,938 --> 00:19:11,884
But if it would be helpful for us for me to do anything, or for me to be there and help you just let me know.

294
00:19:11,904 --> 00:19:13,565
Yeah, it's kind of a one person.

295
00:19:13,705 --> 00:19:14,986
Yeah, that's what I figured.

296
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:15,926
Not really.

297
00:19:16,106 --> 00:19:16,346
Yeah.

298
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:18,068
But if I

299
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:20,887
If I need help, I'll let folks know.

300
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:21,868
OK.

301
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,869
Awesome.

302
00:19:24,149 --> 00:19:24,609
OK.

303
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,611
So I don't know.

304
00:19:27,631 --> 00:19:28,772
Can you think of anything else?

305
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:34,656
I mean, I want to go at least another 15 minutes in case David jumps up.

306
00:19:36,517 --> 00:19:37,758
But I knew this would be quick.

307
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:40,920
I mean, basically, we have most of it done.

308
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:45,543
We've just got to wrap up the details and then put it together.

309
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:51,801
You can reach out you can have a conversation with David about this.

310
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,183
It's not really policy.

311
00:19:55,163 --> 00:19:56,104
No, I that's right.

312
00:19:56,364 --> 00:19:57,725
It's planning at this point.

313
00:19:57,745 --> 00:19:58,505
We're not making any.

314
00:19:59,286 --> 00:20:02,468
So we're not making any decisions.

315
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:11,194
Any decisions that are made about the final report that we put together will be made at the final public meeting of our committee.

316
00:20:11,534 --> 00:20:11,654
So

317
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,326
So no, I think we're in good shape.

318
00:20:19,346 --> 00:20:24,113
Oh my gosh, that's good.

319
00:20:25,555 --> 00:20:25,735
Easy.

320
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,621
I'll make a motion to adjourn.

321
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:32,263
You can send them the minutes, Milva.

322
00:20:33,084 --> 00:20:35,385
Not that rush to get on.

323
00:20:35,825 --> 00:20:36,046
Yeah.

324
00:20:36,086 --> 00:20:37,246
Well, we've gone through our list.

325
00:20:37,306 --> 00:20:38,367
We've done our work.

326
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:43,630
The work that needs to be done now is just work sitting at our desks, right?

327
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,451
Yeah.

328
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:50,654
I'm waiting until the 18th, so you'll have your stuff done by then and then I'll start working on it.

329
00:20:50,774 --> 00:20:51,294
Yeah.

330
00:20:51,354 --> 00:20:52,415
How long do you think you'll need?

331
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:58,328
couple of days?

332
00:20:58,348 --> 00:21:02,811
Our next meeting, our committee meeting is, I think, October 3rd.

333
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:15,058
So ideally, you know, if I could get it to the committee two weeks in advance, that would be nice because I can use them, but I don't even know when I'm going to get the charter from the call-in centers.

334
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:20,401
I mean, I've tried to emphasize to them that I wanted it soon.

335
00:21:22,608 --> 00:21:26,529
So that's the 19th.

336
00:21:26,729 --> 00:21:28,430
Oh my gosh, that's really soon.

337
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,091
Yeah, I'll try to do the footnotes this weekend.

338
00:21:32,011 --> 00:21:32,371
Okay.

339
00:21:35,312 --> 00:21:37,373
All right, I'll wait for the 19th.

340
00:21:39,053 --> 00:21:46,956
Yeah, we made a deadline at our last meeting, deadline for edited final report August 12th, but I guess, you know, it's summer.

341
00:21:48,856 --> 00:21:52,242
Well, we had it edited and we just didn't have it all in one place.

342
00:21:52,282 --> 00:21:53,123
That's right, yeah.

343
00:21:53,323 --> 00:21:56,649
And this we are because our final meeting is October 3rd.

344
00:21:56,849 --> 00:22:00,716
Okay, awesome.

345
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:03,059
Maureen, made a motion to adjourn?

346
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:04,221
I second.

347
00:22:05,243 --> 00:22:05,544
Great.

348
00:22:05,864 --> 00:22:06,946
See you all soon.

349
00:22:07,206 --> 00:22:08,048
Thanks, everybody.
