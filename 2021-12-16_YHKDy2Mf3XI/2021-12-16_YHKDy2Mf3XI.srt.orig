1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:11,751
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can call the roll to start and then I'll read our behavioral health and subcommittee announcement agenda.

2
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:15,195
[SPEAKER_03]: So roll, Mia McStone.

3
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:33,752
[SPEAKER_05]: We can see you Mia, but we can't hear you and now you're frozen.

4
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me a minute to get on.

5
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope everyone else is doing well in this busy time of year.

6
00:01:05,144 --> 00:01:07,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Stacey, I'm sure you don't have too much going on, right?

7
00:01:09,328 --> 00:01:09,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha, ha, ha.

8
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

9
00:01:13,612 --> 00:01:14,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, everybody.

10
00:01:14,713 --> 00:01:16,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody looks tired.

11
00:01:16,974 --> 00:01:18,336
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll make this quick, I promise.

12
00:01:18,356 --> 00:01:21,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

13
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Mia cannot unmute, Peter.

14
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,640
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see if I can do it.

15
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

16
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Mia, you should be good to unmute now.

17
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,611
[SPEAKER_04]: We heard you for a minute, but then you went back on mute again.

18
00:01:52,731 --> 00:01:53,352
[SPEAKER_03]: So try again.

19
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:57,435
[SPEAKER_05]: There I am.

20
00:01:57,475 --> 00:02:00,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Melanie McLaughlin here and Paul Rusco.

21
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:05,937
[SPEAKER_03]: is absent, but may join us partially through the meeting.

22
00:02:05,977 --> 00:02:06,637
[SPEAKER_03]: So we shall see.

23
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:12,359
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, this is the meeting of the behavioral health subcommittee.

24
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,521
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll just read our, our posting.

25
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:24,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Please be advised that on Thursday, December 16, from five to six, there'll be a behavioral health subcommittee meeting held through remote participation via zoom.

26
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:30,646
[SPEAKER_03]: The purpose of the Thursday, December 16 2021 behavioral health subcommittee meeting is to formalize the

27
00:02:31,524 --> 00:02:33,366
[SPEAKER_03]: quote, problem of practice, i.e.

28
00:02:33,426 --> 00:02:41,474
[SPEAKER_03]: focus of the group meetings, subcommittee meetings for the remainder of the year, which will be every other month with community input and involvement.

29
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:43,336
[SPEAKER_03]: So we posted the meeting.

30
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:48,101
[SPEAKER_03]: We let folks know that it's been posted on the PTO sites.

31
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:48,921
[SPEAKER_03]: We let folks know.

32
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:51,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I suspect it's just a really busy time of year for everyone.

33
00:02:51,784 --> 00:02:51,844
[SPEAKER_03]: And

34
00:02:56,103 --> 00:03:08,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people have spoken to me about some things that they're interested in, but previously proposed focus areas for discussion include one, identifying resources for behavioral health supports for students and caregivers in our community.

35
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:16,614
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be like wraparound services to the school and working together to propose policy around identified resources.

36
00:03:17,135 --> 00:03:24,899
[SPEAKER_03]: And then two was creating a visual flow chart with interpretation for English as a second language families

37
00:03:26,301 --> 00:03:29,602
[SPEAKER_03]: and others regarding how to access services within the school community.

38
00:03:31,303 --> 00:03:34,104
[SPEAKER_03]: This should be playing on channel 15.

39
00:03:34,244 --> 00:03:35,184
[SPEAKER_03]: You can dial in 929-205-6099 if needed.

40
00:03:35,204 --> 00:03:40,946
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have questions or comments, you can send them to Melanie McLaughlin.

41
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:55,902
[SPEAKER_03]: m-e-l-a-n-i-e-m-c-l-a-u-g-h-l-i-n at medford.k12.ma.us.

42
00:03:56,002 --> 00:04:00,867
[SPEAKER_03]: This meeting can be viewed through Medford Community Media on Comcast channel 22 and Verizon channel 43.

43
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,050
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for joining us.

44
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,061
[SPEAKER_03]: entertaining me through that reading.

45
00:04:09,462 --> 00:04:25,875
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will, again, we want to just identify what we're calling a problem of practice, which is essentially just a focus for the year for the meetings that will be held every other month, the intent of this subcommittee, when it was initially formed as a special education subcommittee, and then it was

46
00:04:27,472 --> 00:04:32,974
[SPEAKER_03]: added on is special education and behavioral health, which are obviously two vast and very different topics.

47
00:04:33,834 --> 00:04:39,456
[SPEAKER_03]: So we decided this year, we would go with every other month going between the topics.

48
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:49,579
[SPEAKER_03]: So last month was special education, where we identified a problem of practice, which is continuing to work on friendships in the community, in the schools, and broke down ways in which we wanted to do that.

49
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:53,480
[SPEAKER_03]: And this month is behavioral health, where we want to

50
00:04:54,228 --> 00:05:12,595
[SPEAKER_03]: solidify what the discussion was in September around what Stacey Shulman, the director of guidance, talked with us about some of the things that would be helpful to focus on.

51
00:05:12,615 --> 00:05:19,557
[SPEAKER_03]: So Stacey, would you give a little bit of a background on sort of what you were saying around the identifying resources and how that would be helpful?

52
00:05:19,637 --> 00:05:21,838
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think, you know, if,

53
00:05:23,686 --> 00:05:27,632
[SPEAKER_03]: we vote to move this forward to the committee, we can just let them know that this is really what we'll be working on.

54
00:05:27,652 --> 00:05:35,164
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to be obviously voting on policy or anything like that.

55
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:37,247
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea is that we sort of do this

56
00:05:38,327 --> 00:05:43,869
[SPEAKER_03]: problem of practice focus on some, you know, putting together some research and minds together around the problem of practice.

57
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:51,952
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at the end of the year, we do a presentation to the school committee with potentially policy proposals.

58
00:05:52,432 --> 00:05:54,833
[SPEAKER_03]: So Stacey, if you'd like to speak.

59
00:05:55,734 --> 00:05:55,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

60
00:05:56,074 --> 00:06:05,597
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the challenges we've seen is that we have identified a lot of resources and, but there are two challenges happening right now.

61
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:06,858
[SPEAKER_07]: One is that

62
00:06:07,605 --> 00:06:11,307
[SPEAKER_07]: For some reason, the information is not getting to everybody that we want it to.

63
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:17,831
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other challenge we're seeing is that the resources identified are just overwhelmed.

64
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:24,194
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not going to be able to solve that problem in terms of the lack of mental health resources in the community right now.

65
00:06:24,295 --> 00:06:28,957
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a pervasive problem that we're seeing.

66
00:06:28,977 --> 00:06:33,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I was on a call yesterday for the

67
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:53,759
[SPEAKER_07]: S3LC, which is the Safe, Supportive Schools Learning Collaborative that we were accepted into, apart with 15 other districts in the US, and they're all seeing the same problem, which is that, you know, community mental health providers in every facet are just completely overwhelmed.

68
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:59,885
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the challenge we're seeing is that is creating a fallback on the schools.

69
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:13,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Melanie, you're on mute.

70
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:21,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I said, can you tell us a little bit more about the S3LC, the Safe, Supportive Schools Learning Collaborative?

71
00:07:21,553 --> 00:07:24,295
[SPEAKER_03]: You said we were included with 15 other districts?

72
00:07:24,595 --> 00:07:28,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, so we applied in the spring and I was grateful we were accepted.

73
00:07:29,797 --> 00:07:33,839
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is a learning collaborative of 15 districts within the US.

74
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,520
[SPEAKER_07]: We meet monthly.

75
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,583
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to analyze our district's mental health services.

76
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:43,724
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we did that already using the SHAPE system.

77
00:07:43,784 --> 00:07:46,605
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a free online assessment that districts utilize.

78
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:54,287
[SPEAKER_07]: And we created our problem of practice that we want to utilize their resources for.

79
00:07:54,387 --> 00:07:57,849
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have a mentor as well, Lisa Barron from AIP in Boston.

80
00:07:57,869 --> 00:08:00,990
[SPEAKER_07]: What's AIP?

81
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,650
[SPEAKER_07]: AIP.

82
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:02,850
[SPEAKER_07]: What is that?

83
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Alliance, Inclusion, and Prevention.

84
00:08:07,871 --> 00:08:23,185
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we have identified mental health screeners as our goal so that we would, by the end of this next school year, 22, 23, be able to screen all of our K through 12 students.

85
00:08:25,206 --> 00:08:32,353
[SPEAKER_07]: And yesterday we were talking about cultural competencies regarding screeners and assessments.

86
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:45,935
[SPEAKER_07]: and we're starting to sort of educate ourselves a little bit more around some of those areas and figure out the early steps regarding what may work best for Medford.

87
00:08:47,456 --> 00:08:48,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that's really great.

88
00:08:48,656 --> 00:08:51,658
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be great to get updates on that.

89
00:08:51,678 --> 00:08:52,819
[SPEAKER_03]: So you said you guys meet monthly?

90
00:08:53,780 --> 00:09:00,144
[SPEAKER_07]: We meet monthly with the larger group and they provide a lot of resources and we have conversations

91
00:09:01,303 --> 00:09:03,224
[SPEAKER_07]: we meet every other week with our internal group.

92
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:04,465
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

93
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:08,387
[SPEAKER_07]: And the internal group is Medford with your mentor or without your mentor?

94
00:09:09,307 --> 00:09:09,907
[SPEAKER_07]: It's either way.

95
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:12,969
[SPEAKER_07]: She is certainly willing to help us.

96
00:09:13,189 --> 00:09:15,510
[SPEAKER_07]: I often end up catching her outside of meetings.

97
00:09:16,811 --> 00:09:21,013
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can imagine these days, it's pretty difficult to have meetings across schools, especially.

98
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:30,598
[SPEAKER_07]: So I, this week ran an asynchronous meeting, which is sort of, here's the information they gave us, you know, read up on this and answer some of these.

99
00:09:31,118 --> 00:09:33,680
[SPEAKER_07]: questions related to that so we can keep the project moving.

100
00:09:35,462 --> 00:09:52,316
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, it's interesting, a lot of what they were talking about, which was contrary to what I had previously been taught, was that using mental health screeners are very off-putting for certain members of our community.

101
00:09:52,436 --> 00:09:56,920
[SPEAKER_07]: So we may want to look at, you know, internalizing and externalizing wellness

102
00:09:58,677 --> 00:09:59,718
[SPEAKER_07]: screeners instead.

103
00:09:59,998 --> 00:10:04,879
[SPEAKER_07]: We're running the Community That Cares survey in conjunction with the Board of Health next week.

104
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:20,342
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a survey we do every two years, and that'll give us some nice, you know, base data to go off of, but we're looking in terms of having in-house screeners so that we can automatically pull kids for follow-up with counselors immediately.

105
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:26,144
[SPEAKER_07]: So what does the Community That Cares survey, sort of, what is that?

106
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:39,487
[SPEAKER_07]: The Community Care Survey asks a variety of questions, including mental health, general wellness, habits, social media habits, how you feel connected to your school, do you have connections with adults?

107
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:46,331
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of it is around alcohol, drugs, and tobacco use as well.

108
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:55,676
[SPEAKER_07]: That was its original sort of platform when it started 20, 30 years ago, and now it's developed to capture more areas.

109
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,951
[SPEAKER_07]: And is that high school?

110
00:10:59,312 --> 00:10:59,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Six through 12.

111
00:11:00,432 --> 00:11:01,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Six through 12.

112
00:11:02,093 --> 00:11:03,174
[SPEAKER_07]: And where does that data go?

113
00:11:04,474 --> 00:11:08,256
[SPEAKER_07]: It goes to the board of health and then they present it to the school committee.

114
00:11:08,857 --> 00:11:09,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

115
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:11,258
[SPEAKER_07]: This year?

116
00:11:12,385 --> 00:11:24,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so we used to run the survey in the spring, and then they would, it takes a little bit of time to correlate and aggregate the data and get everything back, and they would present it in the fall.

117
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:35,292
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we met during the 2020 year, we decided that we would like to switch it so that we were running the survey in the fall and presenting in the spring.

118
00:11:35,412 --> 00:11:37,953
[SPEAKER_07]: It just makes sense in order for planning for the next school year.

119
00:11:38,974 --> 00:11:43,237
[SPEAKER_07]: with resources and budgets and curriculum and supports and everything in place.

120
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:44,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

121
00:11:45,859 --> 00:11:50,142
[SPEAKER_03]: So is there a link to the S3LC2 or something that we can learn more about?

122
00:11:50,162 --> 00:11:58,728
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be great for the December, January, February meeting, Stacey, if we can just get an update too on that again.

123
00:11:58,768 --> 00:12:01,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's really interesting for folks to hear about.

124
00:12:01,831 --> 00:12:02,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

125
00:12:02,131 --> 00:12:03,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I can send you the press release.

126
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:04,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that'd be great.

127
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:05,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

128
00:12:05,618 --> 00:12:15,625
[SPEAKER_07]: So we sent it out to the community, I believe, in August, which is the same time that we were featured on Boston 25 for our mental health supports.

129
00:12:16,446 --> 00:12:17,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's awesome.

130
00:12:18,107 --> 00:12:19,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, see, I think I missed that.

131
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:21,530
[SPEAKER_03]: So I must have been somewhere in August.

132
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,130
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where.

133
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,872
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was someplace nice, actually.

134
00:12:24,932 --> 00:12:26,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that I'm remembering it.

135
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:27,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

136
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:32,717
[SPEAKER_03]: So back to the problem of practice.

137
00:12:32,957 --> 00:12:37,019
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know you're saying there's a lot of identified resources and that already.

138
00:12:39,781 --> 00:12:42,863
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, you know, obviously there's an overwhelmed, you know,

139
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:52,764
[SPEAKER_03]: an issue of mental health services and supports being overwhelmed right now with requests with just so many requests, you know, in and around the community.

140
00:12:52,784 --> 00:12:59,046
[SPEAKER_03]: And that but that the identified resources weren't resources really weren't getting where you wanted.

141
00:12:59,206 --> 00:13:12,672
[SPEAKER_03]: So going back to the problem of practice and thinking back to what we had said at the at the last meeting about identifying resources for health supports for students and caregivers in our community and working together to propose policy around those resources.

142
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:12,872
[SPEAKER_03]: So

143
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:27,298
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you think this could be operationalized as part of the subcommittee in a way that would be useful to the community around behavioral health, mental health supports?

144
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:33,661
[SPEAKER_03]: How can we utilize this group to help identify policy towards this end that would be helpful?

145
00:13:36,022 --> 00:13:36,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think?

146
00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:54,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the discussion that we had before was sort of, you know, starting to have community members sort of, or subcommittee members sort of look at resources and, you know, talk to constituents and, you know, show up and share what resources have been useful to them.

147
00:13:54,364 --> 00:13:59,347
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it was also about how to get those resources and information out into the community.

148
00:14:00,308 --> 00:14:06,071
[SPEAKER_03]: So is it looking at sort of, you know, similar to what your S3LC group is doing around

149
00:14:07,108 --> 00:14:13,931
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, best practices in terms of what that looks like for getting supports out into the community and for collaborating around these.

150
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:22,694
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know that, I know that Paul Rebel at the Graduate School of Education at Harvard does a lot of work around mental health wraparound services and supports.

151
00:14:22,714 --> 00:14:25,755
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure that there's a lot of research and data around that.

152
00:14:25,775 --> 00:14:27,276
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if that's helpful.

153
00:14:27,296 --> 00:14:33,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I guess I'm trying to wrap my mind around what would be helpful to you and to your team and to the community.

154
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:39,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the biggest challenge we're seeing is that I could send out a different email every day.

155
00:14:40,695 --> 00:14:44,337
[SPEAKER_07]: But for some reason, that information is not getting.

156
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Parents are saying, oh, I didn't see it.

157
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:47,819
[SPEAKER_07]: I missed it.

158
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:55,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Even students are saying that they're not getting that information.

159
00:14:57,544 --> 00:15:00,045
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's challenging in that way.

160
00:15:01,715 --> 00:15:05,957
[SPEAKER_07]: just top of mind, I can't think about how that correlates to a school committee policy.

161
00:15:06,477 --> 00:15:09,118
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's certainly a problem of practice we're experiencing.

162
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:11,579
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think we're alone with that.

163
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:16,442
[SPEAKER_07]: I think other areas are experiencing this as well.

164
00:15:18,362 --> 00:15:19,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I think it's interesting.

165
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:27,146
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would love to hear from like, you know, others on the in the meeting, Miss Lucy, Mia, if you have any input that you want to share as well.

166
00:15:27,186 --> 00:15:28,607
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, I think

167
00:15:29,522 --> 00:15:50,713
[SPEAKER_03]: It is interesting just even as a school committee member not realizing like again the Boston 25 piece and the in the press release out to the community around this particular project and so I guess, first I would say, you know, maybe it is breaking down what are the methods of communication now, you know, what do families, potentially feel like is working or isn't working so you know I hate to say, you know,

168
00:15:51,553 --> 00:16:16,533
[SPEAKER_03]: another a survey or whatever around that but sort of I guess maybe thinking about what is the method of communication now and that could be something that we're looking at and maybe saving examples of the communication that's going on and what that looks like and then you know certainly I'm willing to invite people for the next subcommittee meeting to share their experience around how they're getting information and what's useful and I think you know one of the things that I keep hearing from the community

169
00:16:18,365 --> 00:16:31,268
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly even in the last school committee meeting when we were talking about concerns around student health and safety in our schools, was that like, how do we know where to go, right?

170
00:16:31,388 --> 00:16:33,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Where we go, like, where does the student go when they have an issue?

171
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:39,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it in our day, it was guidance counselors, today it might be school adjustment counselors or something else altogether.

172
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,231
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just kind of, you know, that seems sort of unclear.

173
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:46,032
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe that gets to the second point around a visual flowchart around

174
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:55,346
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of here's where things go, here's an example of a concern, here's where you would go in that concern or something like that.

175
00:16:55,747 --> 00:16:58,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there something that exists already for that, Stacey?

176
00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:06,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so we put together from that advisory, I'm sorry, from those comments that we had with students and with families,

177
00:17:07,977 --> 00:17:13,904
[SPEAKER_07]: And we put together a advisory lesson around who do you talk to or what, right?

178
00:17:13,944 --> 00:17:18,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if I have a concern, who do I go to and what are those people's names and where are they located?

179
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:22,654
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we echoed that response for the middle schools as well.

180
00:17:23,495 --> 00:17:26,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Elementary is a little bit more

181
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:55,260
[SPEAKER_07]: um yeah honed in right because you have your teacher and your teacher is your point person and and you you know parents hear from our their elementary teachers all the time once you get up into the secondary schools it's a little bit more fractured um so students need additional support what i also what was really eye-opening from the last few weeks is we front loaded this material in september because we wanted students to be familiar with

182
00:17:55,953 --> 00:17:58,496
[SPEAKER_07]: who their counselors were, we made a lot of visits.

183
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:05,443
[SPEAKER_07]: And what it showed to me was that that information needs to be repeated more throughout the year.

184
00:18:06,023 --> 00:18:09,267
[SPEAKER_07]: And in a time of crisis, that information is not easily recalled.

185
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:12,590
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think students were like, oh, nice to meet you.

186
00:18:14,252 --> 00:18:15,433
[SPEAKER_07]: And great, great, great.

187
00:18:16,068 --> 00:18:21,069
[SPEAKER_07]: but in and we need to make sure that's repeated later on in the year.

188
00:18:21,189 --> 00:18:26,110
[SPEAKER_07]: So we did a lot of work on the first six weeks this year across the board from K through 12.

189
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:35,032
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think what we've learned is that we need definitely another booster at some point around this time of year.

190
00:18:36,112 --> 00:18:41,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and maybe I think that again for the next subcommittee meeting, maybe it could be really helpful to

191
00:18:42,413 --> 00:19:00,407
[SPEAKER_03]: To, you know, to see that flowchart to talk about like where the information was, you know that you got you know it from and how useful it's been and how we can think about, you know, what that looks like in the community and or sharing it, you know, outside of the school with the with families and whoever.

192
00:19:01,087 --> 00:19:02,869
[SPEAKER_03]: and have it be sort of a repeated.

193
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:20,844
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's part of it is, I think sometimes we might think we got the information out and so it's out there, but again, if you missed it, or if it was at a time that was, like you said, potentially traumatic time, or if it's a traumatic time now, trying to have recall through trauma, or when you're triggered again, is like obviously a very difficult thing to be able to do.

194
00:19:20,944 --> 00:19:25,508
[SPEAKER_03]: And so having it easy and at hand, I think is interesting.

195
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:30,687
[SPEAKER_02]: I think being part of the student sessions as well, it was very interesting.

196
00:19:31,288 --> 00:19:31,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I think

197
00:19:37,024 --> 00:19:41,025
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to just echo what was said about this just being a really challenging time.

198
00:19:41,165 --> 00:19:45,626
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think information that's coming in can be overwhelming.

199
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:53,188
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I know my level is pre-K to five, but I'm the mother of two high school students.

200
00:19:53,449 --> 00:19:57,730
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, I know what both of my email inboxes look like.

201
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:03,571
[SPEAKER_02]: And when email is sent and information is sent to families, I think it can be overwhelming.

202
00:20:06,092 --> 00:20:17,746
[SPEAKER_02]: It was interesting to me to listen to the students say that they wanted information almost in methods that we had in place like before technology.

203
00:20:17,766 --> 00:20:22,791
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they wanted those conversations in their homerooms or in their advisory blocks.

204
00:20:22,952 --> 00:20:25,154
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like what Stacey was speaking to, to like

205
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:30,252
[SPEAKER_02]: have it woven through the year and have it like varied modalities.

206
00:20:31,072 --> 00:20:37,094
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if there are things that we can have on, um, even like through the city side.

207
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:46,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if I look to our local community TV stations, um, both the school one and the one that's on the city side, if maybe there's like, yeah.

208
00:20:47,518 --> 00:20:47,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

209
00:20:47,818 --> 00:20:49,839
[SPEAKER_02]: A way to put like a ticker or something on it.

210
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:50,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I know.

211
00:20:54,558 --> 00:21:04,027
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also in the process of updating and creating a new website, which I think will be a little bit more user-friendly to our community.

212
00:21:04,147 --> 00:21:06,029
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that will also be helpful.

213
00:21:06,509 --> 00:21:16,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know during the pandemic, Stacey had created her own kind of resourced website, which is linked to our website.

214
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:19,081
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think sometimes coming up with other

215
00:21:20,222 --> 00:21:49,009
[SPEAKER_03]: uh ways to direct people to that like wealth of information it was all resources um yeah i think the varied modalities is a really good idea um and i think that like so i'm thinking like email email has now become yeah it's overwhelming oh yeah email is probably the least useful form of communication for me at this point because same thing it's it's there's so many ask me amia knows right mia you have to text me if i'm my she's like i sent you an email i'm like oh sorry

216
00:21:49,727 --> 00:21:50,868
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many of them.

217
00:21:51,068 --> 00:21:56,990
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know for my student last year, who was a senior last year at the high school, that was an ongoing problem.

218
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,031
[SPEAKER_03]: He was rarely looking at his email.

219
00:21:59,091 --> 00:22:07,854
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that unless it rises to the surface or it's been flagged in a number of ways, different modalities, like somebody texts you to tell you we have an email, which is a pain in the neck, right?

220
00:22:08,335 --> 00:22:09,675
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's sort of thinking about that.

221
00:22:09,735 --> 00:22:18,719
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a lot of our families, I mean, I certainly see this when there's a problem at the school, and I'm sure administration sees this as well.

222
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:22,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the first place everybody learns about a problem in our school?

223
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:23,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody?

224
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:26,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook.

225
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:28,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, social media, right?

226
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:36,435
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, really using that platform to get information out both through Instagram for our kids or

227
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:50,313
[SPEAKER_03]: social media, or even like, you know, dare I say TikTok, but, you know, there are ways I think that we could be thinking about asking the students to, you know, sort of what are the modalities that we can get information out.

228
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:59,655
[SPEAKER_03]: So getting back to this subcommittee and, you know, sort of being able to focus on a problem of practice, you know, perhaps it's really looking

229
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:25,696
[SPEAKER_03]: taking the time to look at the resources that are gonna be woven into the website, but both from Stacy's appendage, I guess, to the website and some of the information that's on the website currently and this flow chart for the next meeting to really be able to think about, okay, here's sort of the information that really stood out to us as being useful

230
00:23:27,328 --> 00:23:37,058
[SPEAKER_03]: to families and to students, how can we think about pushing that information forward based on both our personal and our professional experience in the schools and as subcommittee members?

231
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Just thinking out loud, again, going back to the problem of practice, what are you folks thinking on that?

232
00:23:45,025 --> 00:23:48,969
[SPEAKER_03]: So it looks like the flow chart exists, so that's great.

233
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:51,091
[SPEAKER_03]: That can come back at the, you know,

234
00:23:53,113 --> 00:23:56,396
[SPEAKER_03]: February meeting so we can look at that and think about how it's actually getting out.

235
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:57,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that interpreted?

236
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Has that been interpreted, Stacey?

237
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:01,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

238
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:08,406
[SPEAKER_07]: So I sent it out to families, and it should have been interpreted because it was under 5,000 words.

239
00:24:08,426 --> 00:24:08,666
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

240
00:24:12,265 --> 00:24:17,426
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you say you sent it out to family, you sent it out to families at where, the high school?

241
00:24:18,146 --> 00:24:24,748
[SPEAKER_07]: High school and both middle schools sent out the link to that sheet as far as like, who do you talk to?

242
00:24:25,908 --> 00:24:30,969
[SPEAKER_07]: And on there, it was also connected to our community resource guide, which is very robust.

243
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,870
[SPEAKER_07]: That is not translated.

244
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,430
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's something we need to work on.

245
00:24:36,151 --> 00:24:37,571
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably,

246
00:24:39,148 --> 00:24:41,990
[SPEAKER_07]: It's definitely over 50 pages, so it's it's a large document.

247
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,532
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, I would.

248
00:24:45,612 --> 00:24:46,693
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll definitely take a look at that.

249
00:24:46,713 --> 00:24:48,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you send that email that you got?

250
00:24:48,894 --> 00:24:59,301
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm assuming out of district students did not get that email, which I'm assuming that services are also available to out of out of district students as well.

251
00:24:59,321 --> 00:24:59,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, yes.

252
00:25:00,181 --> 00:25:05,045
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we utilize our school messenger system, so as long as their emails are in our system.

253
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,046
[SPEAKER_07]: They're getting it.

254
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:15,508
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I'll check with Joan Bowen about that because that's part of the special ed subcommittee conversation around making sure that's out.

255
00:25:15,528 --> 00:25:21,635
[SPEAKER_03]: So OK, the community resource guide and the flowchart went out to six through 12.

256
00:25:23,277 --> 00:25:24,799
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not necessarily a flowchart.

257
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:26,941
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like this is who your counselor is connected to.

258
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:30,167
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, what your last name is.

259
00:25:30,187 --> 00:25:31,828
[SPEAKER_07]: This is how you find out who your counselor is.

260
00:25:31,868 --> 00:25:32,989
[SPEAKER_07]: This is your principal's name.

261
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:34,710
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the adjustment counselor in your building.

262
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,472
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the school psychologist in your building.

263
00:25:37,552 --> 00:25:42,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone, sorry, everyone six through 12 has a counselor, a school counselor.

264
00:25:43,717 --> 00:25:47,860
[SPEAKER_07]: And from there you're referred to either an adjustment counselor or a school psychologist.

265
00:25:48,389 --> 00:25:49,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Mia?

266
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:52,190
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say I got it for Teagan and it was great.

267
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,871
[SPEAKER_01]: And I forwarded to Teagan and said, these are your people if you need them.

268
00:25:54,911 --> 00:25:58,912
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was to the point and what we needed to know.

269
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,293
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

270
00:26:00,413 --> 00:26:01,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to see it.

271
00:26:01,513 --> 00:26:08,756
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe we can do a quick sort of visual for folks that just learned better visually, but we can figure that out.

272
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:09,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

273
00:26:10,196 --> 00:26:15,238
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'm curious to know, Mia, if you received the group counseling email yesterday as well.

274
00:26:16,064 --> 00:26:17,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, right.

275
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:20,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, with all the different groups, which they were, they looked great.

276
00:26:21,786 --> 00:26:23,726
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for doing all those groups.

277
00:26:23,786 --> 00:26:24,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.

278
00:26:24,787 --> 00:26:26,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can forward it to you.

279
00:26:26,287 --> 00:26:26,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I have them.

280
00:26:26,747 --> 00:26:26,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

281
00:26:26,987 --> 00:26:27,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, okay.

282
00:26:27,307 --> 00:26:27,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so

283
00:26:42,122 --> 00:26:51,394
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it sounds like the identifying the resources for health supports for students and caregivers in our community and working together to propose policy regarding access to the services.

284
00:26:52,135 --> 00:26:56,641
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like the community resource guide has been created.

285
00:26:56,841 --> 00:26:59,645
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe it's the subcommittee could be looking at that guide.

286
00:27:00,108 --> 00:27:12,312
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing how updated it is and seeing what the opportunities are for being able to disseminate that to the community in a way that is, whether it's translated or how we can make that happen from a policy perspective.

287
00:27:12,352 --> 00:27:20,154
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you could email the community resource guide, or should we just go online to get it for the subcommittee?

288
00:27:20,315 --> 00:27:21,555
[SPEAKER_07]: It was connected in those emails.

289
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:27,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so when Mia sends the email, I'll make sure that the rest of the subcommittee, that Paul gets it if he hasn't already.

290
00:27:27,626 --> 00:27:37,369
[SPEAKER_03]: And then maybe we can look at that for the agenda for next time as the community resource guide and the visual flow chart for the February meeting.

291
00:27:37,869 --> 00:27:47,272
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in the interim, Stacey and maybe Mia, you could, and Suzanne and Maurice, if you, Dr. Edward, if you're interested or able,

292
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:57,374
[SPEAKER_03]: asking your nephew or what have you, just doing a little bit of informal qualitative data around the folks that you know and sort of how they're getting information and whether that and in what ways that's useful.

293
00:27:57,454 --> 00:27:58,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they getting the information?

294
00:27:58,634 --> 00:27:59,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Have they seen it?

295
00:27:59,234 --> 00:27:59,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Have they heard it?

296
00:28:00,755 --> 00:28:09,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think certainly, you know, we've been hearing a lot from community members in the past month or so feeling like they're not hearing this information.

297
00:28:09,477 --> 00:28:12,917
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that it's like, okay, you know, where's the disconnect?

298
00:28:12,977 --> 00:28:15,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe they're feeling like they are now more after

299
00:28:16,627 --> 00:28:42,247
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the events of last month, but I think Dr. Edwin said, I'm not sure if you were on the call when there was the conversation about repeating information sort of, you know, with trauma, how sort of, it can be hard to access that information when you're in the throes of trauma and forgetting that, like where that was and sort of how to, you know, being sure that it's repeated during, you know, times of difficulty or whatever, so that we're making sure that the message is sort of being repeated over time.

300
00:28:44,148 --> 00:28:47,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, is there anything else that anybody wants to add?

301
00:28:50,832 --> 00:28:51,132
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

302
00:28:51,773 --> 00:29:02,619
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it looks like we're sticking with the problem of practice, if you will, that we had is the proposed one in the agenda with some slight modifications based on our notes.

303
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:10,724
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the next meeting, which is February, I don't have the date in front of me right now, I apologize.

304
00:29:14,531 --> 00:29:28,002
[SPEAKER_03]: I can look it up if folks want but it's February well we'll let them know before you know at the beginning of February at one of the maybe superintendents updates or something that the meeting's coming but it's in February we'll have info on the S3LC group.

305
00:29:28,782 --> 00:29:31,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Stacey a little bit of an update on that if you don't mind right?

306
00:29:31,905 --> 00:29:32,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.

307
00:29:32,886 --> 00:29:35,988
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the link the press release you'll send over to that and the

308
00:29:36,718 --> 00:29:38,119
[SPEAKER_03]: community Boston TV piece.

309
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:38,979
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would be great.

310
00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:45,002
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another, I think that's actually a good example of something to repeat the messaging on that, especially since it was August.

311
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:47,283
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be nice for the community to know that like that happened.

312
00:29:47,323 --> 00:29:48,544
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys were recognized for that.

313
00:29:48,924 --> 00:29:50,184
[SPEAKER_03]: You're working on that and doing that.

314
00:29:50,204 --> 00:29:51,365
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that I didn't realize that.

315
00:29:51,385 --> 00:29:56,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that sounds like a really cool project and it sounds like some, you guys have a great problem or practice for next year.

316
00:29:56,627 --> 00:29:59,789
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, I know that a little sensitivity around the screening piece.

317
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:02,690
[SPEAKER_03]: So I personally also like the wellness screening.

318
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:05,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that's, that really kind of flips the script a bit.

319
00:30:07,124 --> 00:30:07,504
[SPEAKER_03]: for people.

320
00:30:07,704 --> 00:30:14,506
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess the messaging you might be thinking about that, but I think it sounds really, really interesting.

321
00:30:14,566 --> 00:30:18,507
[SPEAKER_03]: So I look forward to hearing from you guys again in February.

322
00:30:19,188 --> 00:30:19,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else?

323
00:30:20,608 --> 00:30:36,113
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing I will just do a small plug because this is a behavioral health subcommittee that we did receive another very large grant for a community mental health clinician to be housed within Medford High School for easier access for counseling.

324
00:30:36,771 --> 00:30:40,734
[SPEAKER_07]: and also for a paraprofessional to support our steps room.

325
00:30:41,455 --> 00:30:49,121
[SPEAKER_07]: And the steps room has a clinical social worker, and it's for students who are reentering school after a significant absence or a mental health crisis.

326
00:30:50,522 --> 00:30:53,824
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that was really amazing to get.

327
00:30:54,885 --> 00:30:58,208
[SPEAKER_07]: We're hoping to have somebody in the building sooner than later.

328
00:30:58,288 --> 00:31:03,231
[SPEAKER_07]: But of course, there's a wait time as we build our staffing,

329
00:31:05,891 --> 00:31:07,672
[SPEAKER_07]: in Massachusetts in terms of more counselors.

330
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:10,874
[SPEAKER_07]: But we have the rooms already set up.

331
00:31:10,894 --> 00:31:11,755
[SPEAKER_07]: We're ready to go.

332
00:31:11,815 --> 00:31:16,058
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just waiting for those people to be housed at the school.

333
00:31:16,118 --> 00:31:17,899
[SPEAKER_03]: But that will be a great resource for students.

334
00:31:18,518 --> 00:31:20,279
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, and that's great news.

335
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:20,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

336
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:29,304
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's the real importance of the subcommittee meetings because we're able to get into some of the nitty gritty in these meetings and to be able to think about how we're sharing this information in the community.

337
00:31:29,364 --> 00:31:35,106
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes we're not always able to get that information sort of on the regular because there's so many other things going on.

338
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:36,267
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's great news.

339
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:37,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

340
00:31:38,268 --> 00:31:44,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Edward-Vincent, I don't know if you've considered including that in your comments for next week, but would you consider including that?

341
00:31:44,311 --> 00:31:45,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think that's really great news.

342
00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:48,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't hear you, you're on mute.

343
00:31:52,962 --> 00:31:55,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see if I can unmute, I asked.

344
00:31:55,203 --> 00:31:57,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, it was a different setting.

345
00:31:58,725 --> 00:32:12,612
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, no, I can definitely, that was kind of hot off the press, so that was great news and you got it first, but we definitely will talk about that wonderful grant that's coming our way.

346
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,333
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you Stacey for that.

347
00:32:14,925 --> 00:32:16,006
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you, Stacy.

348
00:32:16,026 --> 00:32:17,006
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really great news.

349
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:18,527
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was with Avery Hines.

350
00:32:19,008 --> 00:32:20,949
[SPEAKER_07]: So she was the leader on that.

351
00:32:21,089 --> 00:32:30,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I was her secondary assistant with some, you know, I'm always asking her to put in mental health for those grants and she's very amenable to that.

352
00:32:30,775 --> 00:32:31,575
[SPEAKER_07]: So I appreciate her.

353
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:33,176
[SPEAKER_03]: That's excellent.

354
00:32:33,196 --> 00:32:34,417
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really good news.

355
00:32:35,758 --> 00:32:39,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and the steps and just maybe a little bit of an explanation to her on the steps thing would be really helpful.

356
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:44,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I think a lot of folks don't even know that those things exist until you're in that situation, right?

357
00:32:44,622 --> 00:32:46,385
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have to find out the hard way that exists.

358
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:52,456
[SPEAKER_03]: So when people think that there's not, you know, mental health supports, they don't know because maybe they haven't had to access them.

359
00:32:52,576 --> 00:32:53,478
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's great.

360
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:54,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

361
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:58,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and it is 537 and we're 20 minutes early.

362
00:32:58,446 --> 00:32:59,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we get a motion to adjourn?

363
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:00,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Mia?

364
00:33:02,994 --> 00:33:03,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion to adjourn.

365
00:33:04,477 --> 00:33:05,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I second that motion.

366
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,783
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you all.
