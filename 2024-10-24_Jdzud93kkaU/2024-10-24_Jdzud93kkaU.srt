1
00:01:11,182 --> 00:01:13,044
[SPEAKER_08]: It's watching me, it's recording me eat.

2
00:01:15,986 --> 00:01:17,447
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm turning my camera back off.

3
00:01:25,514 --> 00:01:30,998
[SPEAKER_08]: I was at the Chamber of Commerce event this morning, so I talked about this.

4
00:01:31,318 --> 00:01:32,920
[SPEAKER_08]: We may get some Chamber members watching.

5
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,901
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're going to get started in just a second.

6
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:01,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, everybody.

7
00:04:01,081 --> 00:04:22,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President, give me a quick second.

8
00:04:22,188 --> 00:04:24,269
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got to grab a couple of attendance slips.

9
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:25,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be right back.

10
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,430
Go for it.

11
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:44,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for bearing with us, everybody.

12
00:04:57,503 --> 00:05:03,489
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe President Behrs will be joining us in just a minute, so we can give it another couple of moments for folks to get situated.

13
00:05:50,202 --> 00:05:51,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please just let me know whenever you're ready.

14
00:05:57,325 --> 00:05:57,705
[SPEAKER_02]: All set.

15
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:00,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

16
00:06:01,307 --> 00:06:06,309
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, there will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Planning and Permitting Committee, October 23rd, 2024.

00:06:10,151 --> 00:06:12,872
[SPEAKER_04]: by Zoom only due to early voting in the council chambers.

19
00:06:14,232 --> 00:06:15,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_02]: Hang on, I see Councilor Callahan.

23
00:06:39,777 --> 00:06:41,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lemmon.

24
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:41,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

25
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:47,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli?

26
00:06:48,015 --> 00:06:48,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Present.

27
00:06:49,316 --> 00:06:50,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Collins?

28
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:51,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Present.

29
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:53,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Five present, none absent.

30
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,321
[SPEAKER_04]: The meeting is called to order.

31
00:06:55,763 --> 00:07:04,372
[SPEAKER_04]: The action discussion item for this meeting is again 24-033 zoning ordinance updates with the Innis associates team.

32
00:07:06,094 --> 00:07:06,835
[SPEAKER_04]: This is

33
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,994
[SPEAKER_04]: an exciting moment in our journey through our zoning update.

34
00:07:12,114 --> 00:07:18,101
[SPEAKER_04]: We have been meeting, of course, with our zoning consultant and associates since the beginning of this term.

35
00:07:20,424 --> 00:07:40,291
[SPEAKER_04]: beginning in July with our mapping workshop, we started our targeted discussions of the Mystic Avenue corridor district, discussing that through July and August, and having more tweaks and changes to the draft proposal over the past couple months with a lot of input from city staff.

36
00:07:41,771 --> 00:07:46,453
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been continuing those last changes in committee over the past couple meetings.

37
00:07:47,753 --> 00:07:56,896
[SPEAKER_04]: and tonight I believe that we have a mostly finalized proposal that the zoning consultant has put together for us that councilors got a chance to look at over the weekend.

38
00:07:57,717 --> 00:08:10,341
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the intent for tonight is for us to have a final discussion of the Mystic Avenue Corridor District in this committee before it goes out to review by a procedural step at a regular meeting of the City Council.

39
00:08:11,261 --> 00:08:16,323
[SPEAKER_04]: and then review by Community Development Board before it again comes back to the City Council for another hearing.

40
00:08:17,644 --> 00:08:29,729
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a short list of the specific pieces of the zoning proposal within the package that Councillors received in their agenda packets last week.

41
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:37,373
[SPEAKER_04]: That kind of break down the proposal into its constituent parts in terms of how it fits into our zoning bylaws.

42
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:45,836
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to run through those, but I'm sure that our city staff from the planning department or Emily or Paola from Ennis Associates could do a more elegant job.

43
00:08:47,117 --> 00:08:49,898
[SPEAKER_04]: I also want to make sure that we touch on the timeline.

44
00:08:49,918 --> 00:09:06,285
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, just again, we've been doing this at every meeting, but just to again, kind of recenter ourselves and how we got here at this step in the, at this stage of our timeline, going from several years ago with these kind of goals and visions being formed through our housing production plan and comprehensive plan.

45
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:10,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I would be happy to, um, recognize, um, Director Hunt or, um, Emily.

46
00:09:11,002 --> 00:09:13,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Um if either of you would like to start us off an

47
00:09:36,604 --> 00:09:37,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

48
00:09:37,325 --> 00:09:45,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm happy to pass it off to Director Hunt or Emily after a note from Councilor Scarpelli to orient us to what we're reviewing tonight.

49
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,515
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, go ahead, Councilor Scarpelli.

50
00:09:47,975 --> 00:09:48,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

51
00:09:48,336 --> 00:09:49,017
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate the

52
00:09:50,003 --> 00:10:09,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate the hard work, but I think that one of the questions that I've been, um, that I've, I've received from the constituents is that when we wrote this RFP, we're getting to the point where, um, the question is down to a rise that is, is that we need to be answered is that when we wrote the RFP and we asked for

53
00:10:10,598 --> 00:10:13,541
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, in this to be the that were awarded.

54
00:10:13,602 --> 00:10:24,714
[SPEAKER_05]: We were talking about the process of going into the neighborhoods that our zoning changes would be affected so we can have our citizenry be part of that discussion.

55
00:10:24,734 --> 00:10:30,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, are we planning on doing that before we go to a city council final vote as we move

56
00:10:31,403 --> 00:10:55,206
[SPEAKER_05]: forward because that's something that was um stressed pretty pretty strongly when we discussed it with the prior city council so uh again i appreciate the hard work but i've been waiting uh to ask this question for the simple fact that it's what was intended when we first started the process so thank you thank you so much counselor i really appreciate that question um

57
00:10:57,714 --> 00:10:59,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that a couple ways to answer that.

58
00:10:59,956 --> 00:11:07,363
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that there isn't a plan to have community meetings in between this meeting and when it goes to the regular meeting of the City Council.

59
00:11:07,443 --> 00:11:13,088
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say that everything that this proposal is based on was really forged

60
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:20,974
[SPEAKER_04]: through robust community engagement really over the course of years between city staff planning.

61
00:11:21,595 --> 00:11:22,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Pardon me, I'm speaking.

62
00:11:23,056 --> 00:11:28,920
[SPEAKER_04]: That was forged through the comprehensive plan formation, which was a year's long community engagement process.

63
00:11:29,501 --> 00:11:31,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I also know that there were certain parts of

64
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:43,451
[SPEAKER_04]: the Mystic Avenue Corridor District proposal that we actually pulled back on because we decided that there hadn't been enough robust community engagement when it came to including certain residential streets in that corridor.

65
00:11:43,951 --> 00:11:48,235
[SPEAKER_04]: We decided we're actually not ready to pull the trigger on that without engaging those specific residents.

66
00:11:48,255 --> 00:11:55,160
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've been really conscious of the community buy-in aspect throughout this process.

67
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,723
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, you know, we've been really doing our due diligence over these past few months of

68
00:12:03,445 --> 00:12:13,567
[SPEAKER_04]: we are doing on the mystic Avenue quarter district proposal in this committee and giving the public every opportunity to add to the community feedback that was already given over the course of years.

69
00:12:14,407 --> 00:12:17,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Um on the concert him to on the sorry on the comprehensive.

70
00:12:18,328 --> 00:12:18,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Planning.

71
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:23,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Process Um, so I look forward to continuing to welcome the public into these

72
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:33,391
[SPEAKER_04]: this committee is working on and that residents are really, really welcome to part of this process.

73
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:34,632
[SPEAKER_04]: But at this point, um.

74
00:12:35,552 --> 00:12:42,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that I'm excited to get excited to hear from our city staff and our zoning consultant on exactly if I can follow up.

75
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:44,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, sir.

76
00:12:44,495 --> 00:12:45,715
[SPEAKER_04]: You can wait until I'm finished speaking.

77
00:12:46,695 --> 00:12:46,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Um.

78
00:12:47,896 --> 00:12:51,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I think at this point, it would be important for us to first orient and what we're looking at today.

79
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:54,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I want us to get oriented on what we're looking at today from, um.

80
00:12:55,649 --> 00:13:09,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor as a city council, I have a question and for you to deny that question for city staff is a serious issue, Madam Vice President, because I have a follow up to the question that you asked because I asked a specific question.

81
00:13:09,797 --> 00:13:15,380
[SPEAKER_05]: The specific question I asked was when we asked to write the RFP and if I'll bring up the minutes, we will

82
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:27,931
[SPEAKER_05]: that we asked that we were going to take this directly to the neighborhoods and have an open discussion in those neighborhoods with open dialogue and meetings to get everybody's input.

83
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:28,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Not what you just said.

84
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:37,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, this council is working on the transparency factor of what you think is correct, not what we decided on as a council.

85
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:41,135
[SPEAKER_05]: So don't disrespect me.

86
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:41,895
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't do that to you.

87
00:13:41,915 --> 00:13:43,096
[SPEAKER_05]: You've done it three times tonight.

88
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:44,323
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

89
00:13:44,443 --> 00:13:45,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what you're referring to.

90
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the video.

91
00:13:49,945 --> 00:13:51,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just trying to chair a meeting, George.

92
00:13:51,726 --> 00:13:52,606
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say it up top.

93
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:54,207
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a working meeting.

94
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:56,368
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had a lot of working meetings over the past few months.

95
00:13:56,448 --> 00:13:58,148
[SPEAKER_04]: We are not going to be interrupting each other.

96
00:13:58,168 --> 00:13:59,629
[SPEAKER_04]: I am the chair of this meeting.

97
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:02,950
[SPEAKER_04]: I will recognize all participants, including counselors.

98
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,591
[SPEAKER_04]: I will not be interrupted.

99
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,792
[SPEAKER_04]: We are going to go through the zoning memo.

100
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,914
[SPEAKER_04]: We are going to have a respectful conversation.

101
00:14:11,256 --> 00:14:13,358
[SPEAKER_04]: This process was informed by community outreach.

102
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:14,599
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a fact.

103
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:23,567
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you had concerns about the specific way that we've been doing community outreach through this committee process, you could have brought that up at any time starting in July and not at the 11th hour.

104
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:25,529
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just going to say that at the top of the meeting.

105
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:30,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'd like to recognize Director Hunt or Innis Associates to walk us through the memo.

106
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:32,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam Vice President.

107
00:14:34,048 --> 00:14:36,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Madam Vice President, I'm going to give you one more time and then we're going to go.

108
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,071
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I appreciate it.

109
00:14:38,231 --> 00:14:57,323
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that it's important as as make it make it to be clear that I've I've gone to listen to every meeting, gone to every meeting, and this is under the meeting preference that we're waiting on the process that was originally planned and the RFP that this will be taking to the communities.

110
00:14:57,703 --> 00:14:58,884
[SPEAKER_05]: You haven't answered that question yet.

111
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:00,549
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't talked about that.

112
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:03,670
[SPEAKER_05]: You said that we've had open dialogue that we've done this.

113
00:15:03,711 --> 00:15:04,131
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done that.

114
00:15:04,591 --> 00:15:06,152
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, I want to make it clear.

115
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:17,939
[SPEAKER_05]: This counselor hasn't brought this forward because I've been waiting for the process to walk through to see when is the plan and to go into the neighborhoods because that was the original discussion, Madam Vice President.

116
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:18,319
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.

117
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:19,300
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

118
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Burris.

119
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:21,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

120
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,702
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madam President, Madam Chair.

121
00:15:33,462 --> 00:15:42,987
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I think we need to talk about what the process actually was in the RFP, which discussed us having specific public meetings around specific proposals for specific neighborhoods.

122
00:15:45,248 --> 00:15:48,829
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a public meeting on the Mystic App proposal.

123
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,771
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk about the process that got us here.

124
00:15:53,191 --> 00:15:56,333
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, robust, extensive, comprehensive planning over two years.

125
00:15:57,017 --> 00:15:59,239
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback from thousands of residents, et cetera.

126
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:10,788
[SPEAKER_00]: When you read the RFP, when you read the contract that was awarded, we talked about holding public process and public meetings throughout on specific proposals for specific areas.

127
00:16:11,489 --> 00:16:13,891
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had multiple meetings to generate this.

128
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:17,874
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now having a meeting on the final draft proposal coming out of committee.

129
00:16:18,374 --> 00:16:26,341
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes to council for automatic referral to Community Development Board, where there'll be another public hearing on this proposal.

130
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,162
[SPEAKER_00]: a community meeting, whatever we want to call it.

131
00:16:31,204 --> 00:16:35,688
[SPEAKER_00]: There's public meetings ahead on this proposal specific to Mystic Avenue.

132
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:37,990
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the process.

133
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,674
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are having the public meetings and engaging the residents.

134
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:51,434
[SPEAKER_00]: on these proposals based on the two plus years of public engagement and community engagement that's already happened to develop the city comprehensive plan.

135
00:16:51,894 --> 00:16:57,637
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now executing on literally years of community process and engagement around this issue.

136
00:16:57,657 --> 00:17:06,162
[SPEAKER_00]: We've heard from residents around Mystic Avenue multiple times on proposals and on the ideas of what was in the comprehensive plan.

137
00:17:06,202 --> 00:17:07,223
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have a draft.

138
00:17:07,963 --> 00:17:09,324
[SPEAKER_00]: This public meeting is occurring.

139
00:17:09,824 --> 00:17:10,645
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be the meeting

140
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:13,553
[SPEAKER_00]: to refer this to the Community Development Board.

141
00:17:13,593 --> 00:17:28,905
[SPEAKER_00]: The Community Development Board will have a public hearing and at every step along the way, community members will be engaged and are being engaged in that process and will have continued voice even beyond the voice that's already been part of this process to inform this plan.

142
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:34,289
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know specifically what the request is.

143
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:39,413
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is to have a public meeting,

144
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:43,010
[SPEAKER_00]: That's happening and has happened and will continue to happen.

145
00:17:46,411 --> 00:17:47,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Beers.

146
00:17:47,251 --> 00:17:49,632
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go now to Director Hunt.

147
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,993
[SPEAKER_04]: For clarity, George, you got to wait for me to recognize you.

148
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:53,354
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going now to Director Hunt.

149
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:57,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Director Hunt, go ahead.

150
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:24,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam chair, um, as before I introduce, um, Emily, um, in us and the proposal this evening, um, I did actually think it would be useful for me to share some of the outreach that we have been doing, um, that, uh, We sent out a mailer through all the water bills that highlighted a residential side that highlighted our new zoning page and zoning process.

151
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:30,227
[SPEAKER_07]: and a business side that specifically said it was for businesses that directed people.

152
00:18:30,347 --> 00:18:35,489
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to post the URL for the webpage that we've made at medfordma.org slash zoning.

153
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I also had a coffee with the chamber this morning.

154
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:50,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I had about, I didn't count, but I'm going to say 30 to 40 chamber members, including a solid number of business owners from Mystic Ave at the chamber this morning.

155
00:18:51,542 --> 00:19:00,560
[SPEAKER_07]: where we presented, we talked about a lot of the work that the city is doing, but knowing that this is very important to those business owners, we actually did focus on Mystic Ave.

156
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:03,370
[SPEAKER_07]: I encourage them to watch this evening.

157
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:24,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I encourage them to reach out either publicly or privately to myself or members of the council with any thoughts or concerns or questions about this, including let them know about our process, about where there would be public hearings that they could also contribute at that point too.

158
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:29,957
[SPEAKER_07]: And I pointed them to the webpage where they could review the zoning that was circulated on Friday.

159
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:34,397
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to share that there was also some direct outreach.

160
00:19:34,817 --> 00:19:49,402
[SPEAKER_07]: When you see the map for Mystic Ave, there's a little area that seems oddly cut out of residences, and that is an area where residents had petitioned to be taken out of the Commercial 2 Zone about 15 years ago.

161
00:19:51,583 --> 00:20:12,055
[SPEAKER_07]: And we had somebody from the mayor's office reach out to those residents as well to find out to sort of take a temperature of what was going on, but more importantly, let them know that these public meetings are occurring and that they should watch these public meetings or review the documents if they have any questions or concerns about rezoning on there.

162
00:20:12,835 --> 00:20:14,236
[SPEAKER_07]: So while it hasn't been

163
00:20:15,979 --> 00:20:25,803
[SPEAKER_07]: with the council in tow, if there was any meeting that involved all the city counselors, it then becomes a whole question about public meeting process, you know, posting, etc.

164
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:30,024
[SPEAKER_07]: But we have been doing these outreach sessions, as well.

165
00:20:30,505 --> 00:20:34,246
[SPEAKER_07]: I also reached out to the property owner that

166
00:20:34,846 --> 00:20:47,792
[SPEAKER_07]: owns the largest chunk of land on Mystic Ave and asked if they wanted to meet with me and let them know specifically about this proposal and this meeting so that they would also be aware of this.

167
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:54,075
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to share that, that we've been doing a bunch of this outreach.

168
00:20:54,496 --> 00:21:03,360
[SPEAKER_07]: This is different from a block that has a ton of residents living on it, but we've been trying to reach the business owners on this.

169
00:21:05,105 --> 00:21:15,031
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to call out any of the business owners by name without warning them, so I don't want to actually name names, but I'm happy to share with Councilor Scarpelli privately, who I spoke with this morning at the chamber.

170
00:21:15,091 --> 00:21:19,594
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't want to do that in a public session without telling them I was going to name names.

171
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:25,897
[SPEAKER_07]: So let me turn this over to Emily to provide the presentation and from her team tonight.

172
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:27,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

173
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:28,499
[SPEAKER_07]: I recognize Emily Ennis.

174
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Chair Collins.

175
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:36,809
[SPEAKER_10]: So good evening for the record Emily Ennis of Ennis Associates.

176
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:47,655
[SPEAKER_10]: I do want to walk through the primary components of the draft zoning that is in front of you just from a high level.

177
00:21:47,915 --> 00:21:56,100
[SPEAKER_10]: I also want to talk about some of the changes we have made in discussion with President Mayers and Chair Collins and the city staff

178
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,322
[SPEAKER_10]: on our regular check-in calls prior to this meeting.

179
00:21:59,942 --> 00:22:06,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Before I do that, I would like to set what we're doing today in context with the overall effort.

180
00:22:06,646 --> 00:22:10,988
[SPEAKER_10]: So there has been reference to the comprehensive plans and past studies.

181
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:23,716
[SPEAKER_10]: The work that we have done with you so far in this effort has been initially starting off on some of the administrative items that needed to be cleared up post the recodification and moving

182
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:29,298
[SPEAKER_10]: towards this first tackle of an actual geography.

183
00:22:29,378 --> 00:22:33,560
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked about the existing conditions for the Mystic Avenue corridor.

184
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,302
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked about the existing conditions for Salem Street.

185
00:22:36,782 --> 00:22:42,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Started to show you some of our thinking based on past planning efforts and practice.

186
00:22:42,464 --> 00:22:48,267
[SPEAKER_10]: But this is where we're starting to really focus in on, here is a geography.

187
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:57,091
[SPEAKER_10]: here is the uses and the dimensional standards and the development standards and the incentives that would go along with this geography.

188
00:22:57,671 --> 00:23:12,140
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things that we've been talking about in-house with, you know, among ourselves, Paula, Jemmy, myself, the other members of the NS Associates team, is we are understanding that at some point we're going to have to come back to you and we're going to have to say,

189
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember that work that we did in October?

190
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:30,745
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to have to change some of that because now we've done other districts and there will be implications for this district for some of the components based on the work that we do later in the process over the next six to eight months.

191
00:23:30,885 --> 00:23:39,188
[SPEAKER_10]: We want you to be aware of that today that, for example, some of the development standards that we're proposing for Mystic Avenue corridor

192
00:23:39,748 --> 00:23:43,129
[SPEAKER_10]: may be appropriate for other geographies in the city.

193
00:23:43,610 --> 00:24:01,137
[SPEAKER_10]: And we may find, for example, that it is appropriate to create a new section in your zoning ordinance called development standards, point some of the other districts that we're going to be looking at to those development standards, and then come back and modify this to point to that same section.

194
00:24:01,737 --> 00:24:04,078
[SPEAKER_10]: There will be other examples like this.

195
00:24:04,716 --> 00:24:14,590
[SPEAKER_10]: I do want to just note that we are starting with an area that has had significant public participation over the years, including discussion of the comprehensive plan.

196
00:24:15,091 --> 00:24:20,418
[SPEAKER_10]: There are some other geographies that we are looking at that were also mentioned in the comprehensive plan.

197
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,921
[SPEAKER_10]: and past planning efforts.

198
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:26,465
[SPEAKER_10]: So, for example, Medford Square will be coming up to you relatively soon.

199
00:24:27,446 --> 00:24:39,238
[SPEAKER_10]: But there are areas that were not as significantly discussed during the comprehensive planning process or did not have as fully developed planning processes.

200
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:43,202
[SPEAKER_10]: We know we're getting to those later in this planning process,

201
00:24:43,658 --> 00:24:50,704
[SPEAKER_10]: we have set aside budget if we need to assist the city with their public outreach for those areas.

202
00:24:50,784 --> 00:24:52,265
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have planned for that.

203
00:24:53,486 --> 00:24:55,047
[SPEAKER_10]: We are aware that that may be needed.

204
00:24:55,127 --> 00:25:07,017
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just that we're starting off with a district that we understand has already received significant public presentation, but we are aware of the need to assist the city in its communication as required.

205
00:25:07,837 --> 00:25:11,060
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that, I'm going to get a quick overview of the

206
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:15,094
[SPEAKER_10]: districts and the components that we're changing.

207
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:27,928
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I'm going to walk you through verbally some of the changes that we anticipate based on the input from our regular Monday meeting after you receive this on Friday.

208
00:25:28,449 --> 00:25:32,894
[SPEAKER_10]: And then if you have specific questions, I'm happy to share my screen with the actual text.

209
00:25:33,684 --> 00:25:42,593
[SPEAKER_10]: So there are four sections that we are amending and then a brand new section that's going in.

210
00:25:43,514 --> 00:25:57,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the sections that we're amending are basically boilerplate sections or boilerplate amendments that say if you're adding a new zoning district, you have to amend these sections to include that zoning district into the ordinance as a whole.

211
00:25:58,508 --> 00:26:08,580
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're amending section 94 dash 2.1 which divides your city into zoning districts and we're adding this district to that.

212
00:26:09,249 --> 00:26:12,051
[SPEAKER_10]: We are amending the Table of Use Regulations.

213
00:26:12,111 --> 00:26:21,459
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're taking the Table of Uses that we amended earlier this year, amending that again to add the new district, the uses for the new district into that.

214
00:26:21,879 --> 00:26:24,261
[SPEAKER_10]: Same thing for the Table of Dimensional Requirements.

215
00:26:24,401 --> 00:26:28,324
[SPEAKER_10]: So the Table of Use Regulations is 94-3.2.

216
00:26:28,844 --> 00:26:31,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Table of Dimensional Requirements is 94-4.1.

217
00:26:31,066 --> 00:26:32,467
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're amending that to add this.

218
00:26:36,587 --> 00:26:42,052
[SPEAKER_10]: We are amending section 94-12.0, which is definitions.

219
00:26:42,192 --> 00:26:52,022
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to stop here and say that we anticipate amending that definition section pretty much every time you see us for a zoning change.

220
00:26:52,520 --> 00:27:14,680
[SPEAKER_10]: because as we go to the different geographies, as we better understand your, not just the housing goals that you have, which we've certainly talked about, but also your goals for economic development and jobs and how those might affect different districts, we anticipate either adding or modifying definitions as we go through.

221
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,663
[SPEAKER_10]: So don't be surprised to see that more often.

222
00:27:18,754 --> 00:27:31,632
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are the main amendments to your existing zoning ordinance and then we are inserting section 94-9 point whatever the next number is in the sequence there for the Mystic Avenue corridor district.

223
00:27:32,964 --> 00:27:45,610
[SPEAKER_10]: The key things to note when we are adding these pieces is that you are getting some additional uses in your table of uses that are also defined specific to the corridor.

224
00:27:46,351 --> 00:28:02,239
[SPEAKER_10]: We anticipate as we re-look at the other geographic areas that some of those uses will be appropriate and so we will be modifying the table of uses again to either include them in existing districts or to add new districts or revise districts to include

225
00:28:02,979 --> 00:28:04,741
[SPEAKER_10]: the new uses that we're proposing.

226
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:11,347
[SPEAKER_10]: We also anticipate that we're going to be doing the same thing for the Table of Dimensional Requirements.

227
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:20,676
[SPEAKER_10]: We have created for the purposes of today's zoning some sub-districts of the Mystic Avenue Corridor District.

228
00:28:20,716 --> 00:28:28,543
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have a mixed-use 1, a mixed-use 2, a mixed-use 3, and a commercial sub-district for all of these.

229
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:34,372
[SPEAKER_10]: We anticipate that some of those sub districts may be useful in other parts of the city.

230
00:28:34,452 --> 00:28:38,534
[SPEAKER_10]: So that is a change that you may see us bringing back to you.

231
00:28:39,495 --> 00:28:50,119
[SPEAKER_10]: In addition to the standard table of uses and the table of uses and the dimensional standards, we're adding a few other components to the Mystic Avenue Corridor District.

232
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,641
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have definitions of the

233
00:28:54,095 --> 00:28:54,996
[SPEAKER_10]: the sub-districts.

234
00:28:55,157 --> 00:29:01,164
[SPEAKER_10]: We have certain dimensional requirements and waivers of those requirements for the districts.

235
00:29:01,784 --> 00:29:14,459
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have requirements for setbacks allowing for multi-building lots and importantly the transitions from the new district to the adjacent residential districts.

236
00:29:15,663 --> 00:29:31,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are things to watch out for and understand that each district that we propose is likely to have some variations to allow for the appropriate transition, certainly in the quarters and squares to the adjacent residential districts.

237
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:34,889
[SPEAKER_10]: We also have a section for development incentives.

238
00:29:35,349 --> 00:29:46,396
[SPEAKER_10]: You would have seen this for those of you who voted on the Section 3A MBTA Communities Act zoning last fall.

239
00:29:46,496 --> 00:29:54,960
[SPEAKER_10]: We built off the development incentives in there to create the development incentives for the Mystic Avenue corridor.

240
00:29:55,101 --> 00:29:57,182
[SPEAKER_10]: And you'll note that there are some new ones there.

241
00:29:57,902 --> 00:30:05,525
[SPEAKER_10]: We have used the zoning to allow the Community Development Board to develop design guidelines for this district.

242
00:30:06,046 --> 00:30:09,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, that may be something that becomes applicable to more than one.

243
00:30:09,887 --> 00:30:25,514
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have placed development standards, again, based primarily on or initially on the ones that you did for the 3A district, but also looking at other sections of your existing zoning ordinance for appropriate development standards.

244
00:30:26,246 --> 00:30:32,110
[SPEAKER_10]: And then finally, we are tying the affordability requirements to the existing inclusionary housing.

245
00:30:32,671 --> 00:30:37,274
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are the main core components of the new zoning district.

246
00:30:38,014 --> 00:30:43,698
[SPEAKER_10]: The amendments are to, we had referred to special permits in the table of uses.

247
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:49,903
[SPEAKER_10]: We have proposed to clarify those to assign them to the community development board.

248
00:30:51,232 --> 00:30:58,993
[SPEAKER_10]: We are allowing J6 Research and Testing Laboratory as a yes, a permitted use in all of the sub-districts.

249
00:31:00,094 --> 00:31:06,115
[SPEAKER_10]: We realized when talking with city staff that we had inadvertently gotten rid of the C2 district.

250
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:12,096
[SPEAKER_10]: We hadn't realized that that was the only place that adult use was allowed in the city.

251
00:31:12,156 --> 00:31:19,277
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are allowing adult use back in the commercial sub-district, which effectively replaced the C2 district.

252
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:30,878
[SPEAKER_10]: There was some confusion in the recodification between large and small hotels and large and small business professional or government offices.

253
00:31:31,358 --> 00:31:35,001
[SPEAKER_10]: We are deleting the reference to size in the table of uses.

254
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:38,644
[SPEAKER_10]: That's something that will come back for the entire table of use.

255
00:31:39,284 --> 00:31:48,131
[SPEAKER_10]: And we are proposing the next time we talk with you, we will start to show you use standards, which may govern the size in certain districts.

256
00:31:49,673 --> 00:31:57,687
[SPEAKER_10]: We are also changing some of the terminology around, I think we had single dwelling units and it should have been single unit dwellings.

257
00:31:57,747 --> 00:31:59,290
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a typo that went through.

258
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,734
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're fixing those for all dwelling units.

259
00:32:02,349 --> 00:32:16,315
[SPEAKER_10]: We are adding the idea of low income shared community solar under incentive zoning, but it's as a placeholder because we need a better definition, a better zoning definition of what that is and how it would work.

260
00:32:16,415 --> 00:32:20,216
[SPEAKER_10]: But we want that to be available for city councillors to discuss.

261
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,157
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've added it to the table.

262
00:32:23,298 --> 00:32:29,200
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've already mentioned that we're going to add the additional use standards as we move through through the other districts.

263
00:32:29,744 --> 00:32:35,089
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are the primary changes to the document that you saw on Friday.

264
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:39,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, I'm happy to go through and talk about anything specific.

265
00:32:40,054 --> 00:32:52,905
[SPEAKER_10]: We at this point would love to hear with the chair's permission, any questions from city councilors on the language so that we're able to work with city staff to make those changes prior to moving on to the next step.

266
00:32:53,386 --> 00:32:55,608
[SPEAKER_10]: And with that chair Collins, I will defer back to you.

267
00:32:56,906 --> 00:32:57,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much, Emily.

268
00:32:57,887 --> 00:32:58,527
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.

269
00:32:58,567 --> 00:32:59,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the overview.

270
00:32:59,488 --> 00:33:04,132
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that this was a pretty substantial package that counselors received before the weekend.

271
00:33:04,152 --> 00:33:09,637
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I've given it my review, clarified some things in the text.

272
00:33:09,977 --> 00:33:16,382
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to ask my fellow counselors if there's any questions on this section that they want clarification on before we move on.

273
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:21,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, President Burris.

274
00:33:22,948 --> 00:33:24,269
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

275
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:25,650
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just wondering,

276
00:33:26,688 --> 00:33:34,175
[SPEAKER_00]: Paula, in the memo, you noted that we need a little more study on like what the community solar incentive would be.

277
00:33:34,715 --> 00:33:51,410
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we thinking that that would be something that the research could be done like, well, this is being also at the public meetings for the Community Development Board and could maybe be included as a recommendation from the CD board or at the final council hearing on this?

278
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:53,031
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do we need more time than that?

279
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, President Bairstow.

280
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:01,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead, Paola.

281
00:34:02,252 --> 00:34:05,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I think that it might need a bit more time.

282
00:34:05,314 --> 00:34:11,758
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of information and a lot of programs at a federal level and a state level.

283
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,860
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to go a bit through those.

284
00:34:17,662 --> 00:34:23,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we will need to see how that works in making the standards for it.

285
00:34:25,427 --> 00:34:30,630
[SPEAKER_01]: So I consider that we will need a bit more time and more research.

286
00:34:31,591 --> 00:34:33,532
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do want to look into it.

287
00:34:33,592 --> 00:34:35,113
[SPEAKER_01]: We do think it's interesting.

288
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:38,915
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might be something that we will have to bring back.

289
00:34:41,636 --> 00:34:41,996
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

290
00:34:42,076 --> 00:34:44,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Emily, do you have any consideration?

291
00:34:44,498 --> 00:34:48,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that it will be able to do it before the public hearing?

292
00:34:50,201 --> 00:34:52,222
[SPEAKER_10]: With your permission, Chair Collins?

293
00:34:52,662 --> 00:34:53,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead, Emily.

294
00:34:54,056 --> 00:35:00,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I think, so one of the questions is what is the appropriate zoning definition?

295
00:35:01,602 --> 00:35:04,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Paola mentioned the standards that would go along with it.

296
00:35:04,704 --> 00:35:17,814
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the third question that we would want to answer is what level of benefit would it be, you know, is it worth, the incentive structure is based on number of floors at the moment,

297
00:35:18,582 --> 00:35:21,905
[SPEAKER_10]: So is it a half floor, a whole floor?

298
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:26,289
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to do some thinking about that as well to see what that structure would be.

299
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:40,582
[SPEAKER_10]: If we cannot complete that by the time that we go to the CD board, I would anticipate bringing it forward as a modification with the Salem Street corridor zoning, which is the next one on our list.

300
00:35:40,662 --> 00:35:43,685
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't anticipate that it's going to be too long a period.

301
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:51,355
[SPEAKER_10]: But just to give you a timeline in case we can't meet it to the CD board for this zoning.

302
00:35:52,716 --> 00:35:52,996
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.

303
00:35:53,016 --> 00:35:53,396
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

304
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:56,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

305
00:35:57,179 --> 00:35:58,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the question, President Behrs.

306
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for weighing in on that, Emily and Paola.

307
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:09,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any other questions from councillors on this section of the zoning proposal at this time?

308
00:36:13,737 --> 00:36:20,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, Emily, anything else that you wanted to flag from other sections of the four main components of the zoning proposal?

309
00:36:22,479 --> 00:36:24,720
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's primarily it, Chair Collins.

310
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:31,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, we look forward if councillors have questions after this meeting that they want to funnel through city staff.

311
00:36:32,242 --> 00:36:42,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Apologies for volunteering, Director Hunt's department, but we would be happy to work on those in preparation for the next steps in the process.

312
00:36:44,571 --> 00:36:44,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

313
00:36:45,233 --> 00:36:45,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

314
00:36:45,794 --> 00:36:46,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.

315
00:36:50,117 --> 00:37:07,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Director Hunt or Planner Evans, is there any other, I know for myself, there's plenty that we can speak to that we've been speaking to in terms of the main headlines of what we're looking at tonight, how those fit into the overall zoning structure, where these elements come from, why they are important.

316
00:37:07,388 --> 00:37:08,289
[SPEAKER_04]: We've spoken about that before.

317
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:18,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to speak to that again, but I'd like to defer to city staff first, if there's any other pieces of context or especially important points that you'd like to raise before we discuss our next steps on this.

318
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:21,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so thank you, Madam Chair.

319
00:37:23,012 --> 00:37:39,659
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things that as I was going through all of this, I was realizing that we, I just wanna flag for us is something that I think we need to figure out sort of separately at a separate time is how parking works through all of this.

320
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:45,121
[SPEAKER_07]: We've really just taken the parking that we've been using that was previously done

321
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:47,363
[SPEAKER_07]: and we flowed it through all the new uses.

322
00:37:47,743 --> 00:37:52,648
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that is fine for now and for approving these districts.

323
00:37:53,269 --> 00:38:06,282
[SPEAKER_07]: And that one of the things that I'd like to consider on our radar is maybe some sort of separate parking assessments that thinks about what is the number of parking spaces

324
00:38:07,103 --> 00:38:08,625
[SPEAKER_07]: different kinds of uses.

325
00:38:09,025 --> 00:38:10,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it per employee?

326
00:38:10,707 --> 00:38:12,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it per square footage?

327
00:38:13,069 --> 00:38:20,776
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that if we were to do that type of analysis, we could take several years and that we need to do the zoning and get things right.

328
00:38:21,797 --> 00:38:23,959
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what I do want to do is just sort of

329
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:34,228
[SPEAKER_07]: make a note and be clear that the loading requirement, which is for loading docks and the parking, we're kind of carrying that forward.

330
00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:47,060
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to talk to our traffic and transportation director and start to think about how can we do a separate analysis and that we might come back later as we're looking at the whole table for the whole city.

331
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,002
[SPEAKER_07]: And do some adjustments on that as well.

332
00:38:50,383 --> 00:39:02,033
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just, I volunteer that so that nobody feels that what we've what we're putting forward that it is my goal and my hope that the council will generally pass this, you know, there may be tweaks.

333
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:07,158
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying that, but that this will go through the planning board it will go through the council will get passed.

334
00:39:07,398 --> 00:39:12,842
[SPEAKER_07]: but it won't be set in stone, and that nobody should say, we just changed that, we can't touch it again.

335
00:39:13,362 --> 00:39:22,049
[SPEAKER_07]: But actually, we do understand that as we go through each area, we're finding tweaks that need to occur.

336
00:39:22,809 --> 00:39:26,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of those things around hotel and office and large and stuff like that.

337
00:39:27,092 --> 00:39:38,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are actually problems that I discovered, honestly, this morning that have been in our zoning code since the recodification and nobody, I hadn't noticed until today.

338
00:39:39,121 --> 00:39:48,848
[SPEAKER_07]: And as we go into other sections, we will look with a fine tooth comb and other things like that are likely to like pop into our attention.

339
00:39:48,868 --> 00:39:51,710
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I just wanted to flag that for people.

340
00:39:52,884 --> 00:39:57,108
[SPEAKER_07]: that this isn't the be all end all, this is moving us forward.

341
00:39:59,130 --> 00:39:59,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

342
00:39:59,911 --> 00:40:00,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.

343
00:40:00,652 --> 00:40:07,959
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's a really important point that we have to do this work in sections because otherwise it just doesn't make sense.

344
00:40:07,999 --> 00:40:09,060
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not approachable.

345
00:40:09,361 --> 00:40:09,741
[SPEAKER_04]: However,

346
00:40:11,124 --> 00:40:14,545
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, we can take these books back off the shelf.

347
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:31,152
[SPEAKER_04]: All of these components of our zoning, like anything else in our code of ordinances, can be updated, can be amended, we can look at again, we can tweak, we can see what comes up later in this process that informs another change that we decide we actually want to make to the MACD, the Mystic Avenue Border District.

348
00:40:33,032 --> 00:40:33,352
[SPEAKER_04]: we might.

349
00:40:33,953 --> 00:40:39,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Find something later in the process that we decide something can be changed to bring more consistency to the citywide zoning map.

350
00:40:40,716 --> 00:40:50,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Um there's I think it's I'm glad you are reminding us and reminding the public that even though we're kind of breaking this overall project into chunks.

351
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:55,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Um that's not a door that closes and locks and all of these can continue to be considered in tandem.

352
00:41:02,403 --> 00:41:11,331
[SPEAKER_00]: about how we communicate this process, and I mean this for all stakeholders here and those who have been part of this so far.

353
00:41:13,814 --> 00:41:16,696
[SPEAKER_00]: We are doing a comprehensive update to the zoning ordinance.

354
00:41:17,497 --> 00:41:28,327
[SPEAKER_00]: We're breaking that into pieces, as was discussed in the RFP, as was discussed in our first 13 meeting of this committee on this topic so far, because we want

355
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:33,495
[SPEAKER_00]: the public to be able to access the different pieces of the project as we move along.

356
00:41:34,035 --> 00:41:44,599
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead of saying, I mean, we could have met, you know, 25, 30, 40 times, and then had a document at the end of it, you know, and had a 200 page document that here's the new zoning.

357
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:50,081
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anyone would have really been able to understand that in the way that this process is working.

358
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:52,162
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I think we just need to be really clear.

359
00:41:52,182 --> 00:41:58,705
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we need to tighten up a little bit how we're communicating this out, right?

360
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:03,732
[SPEAKER_00]: each of these stages as part of this comprehensive zoning update.

361
00:42:04,072 --> 00:42:06,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we're working on the Mystic Avenue Corridor District.

362
00:42:08,155 --> 00:42:11,437
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the district boundaries.

363
00:42:11,497 --> 00:42:13,298
[SPEAKER_00]: What uses do we want in that area?

364
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:17,001
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that align with the comprehensive plan and all the public participation up to this point?

365
00:42:18,061 --> 00:42:27,467
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of this committee, and I think we need to maybe really put out a very specific calendar and probably work through this together in our

366
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:30,387
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting.

367
00:42:30,407 --> 00:42:30,467
[SPEAKER_00]: Um.

368
00:42:30,487 --> 00:42:30,687
[SPEAKER_00]: Committee.

369
00:42:30,727 --> 00:42:36,690
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, our steering meetings here of the goal was to have essentially two meetings a month.

370
00:42:38,051 --> 00:42:49,116
[SPEAKER_00]: Where one meeting was discussing districts and one meeting was discussing global changes like what director Hunt said around parking, and I think we need to put out a calendar going forward that says.

371
00:42:49,756 --> 00:42:52,437
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the district that we're working on this month.

372
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:58,751
[SPEAKER_00]: here's the global change that we're working on this month.

373
00:42:58,791 --> 00:43:00,251
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the date and the time of that meeting.

374
00:43:00,931 --> 00:43:05,972
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the, and just really like lock that in and lock that down.

375
00:43:05,992 --> 00:43:25,457
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand we need to have some flexibility as questions come up, but, um, I think putting that out is going to just behoove all of us to a, keep us on track, keep us on plan, but also to make sure that, um, folks feel communicated to about this and,

376
00:43:26,235 --> 00:43:36,681
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just really think we should probably sit down in our next meeting and say, OK, November, we're finishing up the Salem Street corridor district.

377
00:43:36,701 --> 00:43:37,941
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we've already talked about.

378
00:43:38,441 --> 00:43:40,743
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at this set of global plans.

379
00:43:40,803 --> 00:43:42,043
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're doing that in memos.

380
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:45,045
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think like those of us who are maybe like in this committee.

381
00:43:45,774 --> 00:43:49,276
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially those who are in the steering part of the process understand what we're doing.

382
00:43:49,737 --> 00:43:53,819
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't think we're like putting that out in a communications way really effectively.

383
00:43:54,039 --> 00:44:01,044
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanna think about how we can do that where we move forward from here.

384
00:44:02,965 --> 00:44:12,311
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I just wanna note, like, I appreciate that we can, you know, look at further studies and look at

385
00:44:12,958 --> 00:44:26,324
[SPEAKER_00]: finding more grants for more studies and things like that, and I think that that's useful in some cases, but I think the goal of this process as outlined in the RFP is to do the comprehensive rezoning of the entire zoning ordinance and to rezone the city.

386
00:44:26,944 --> 00:44:38,670
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there are studies that need to go longer than that, then I think we should think about that in the way that Director Hunt and Vice President Collins were just talking about, right?

387
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:39,350
[SPEAKER_00]: We can

388
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:41,972
[SPEAKER_00]: implement this change now.

389
00:44:42,412 --> 00:44:47,655
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's a study where we're not going to get the grant funding for a year, we can come back and further fine tune that.

390
00:44:48,055 --> 00:45:01,762
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just want to make sure that we keep moving along this plan so that at the end of this process, we have that comprehensive zoning update that matches the goals and action items from the comprehensive plan

391
00:45:03,262 --> 00:45:06,483
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's the thing that can then be further updated, right?

392
00:45:06,524 --> 00:45:11,505
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the base document for the city planning for the next 20 to 30 years.

393
00:45:12,086 --> 00:45:25,331
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll have those additional studies and long-term pieces of things that will further inform tweaks and changes down the road as market conditions change or new industries pop up or whatever it may be.

394
00:45:25,451 --> 00:45:28,492
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just think there's like a little bit of communications work

395
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:31,092
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can be doing that would go a long way.

396
00:45:31,112 --> 00:45:36,376
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I hope that we can work on that going forward.

397
00:45:38,578 --> 00:45:42,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Barrett, I think those I think those points are really well taken, and I think that it.

398
00:45:44,571 --> 00:45:45,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's important.

399
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:49,152
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that this is a really big job this committee has been attempting.

400
00:45:50,752 --> 00:45:56,333
[SPEAKER_04]: The comprehensive zoning update just on the technical stuff is a lot for one committee.

401
00:45:57,593 --> 00:46:12,536
[SPEAKER_04]: And now that we've gone through a couple cycles of packages that this committee has looked at, I'm hoping that we can begin to shoulder a little bit more and pair our next package of updates with indeed improving and adding more to our

402
00:46:12,956 --> 00:46:20,658
[SPEAKER_04]: how we're communicating about it and how we're communicating about that to the public, to the councillors that aren't on this committee, to city staff.

403
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:36,803
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it will help us keep on track and accomplish all that we hope to, to put out that more specific, well, we've put out specific calendars of what we hope to get to and when, and I think that what we need to do now, as you said, is to break that down to an even more granular level.

404
00:46:38,043 --> 00:46:39,664
[SPEAKER_04]: this week and this month, we're looking at this.

405
00:46:39,864 --> 00:46:41,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Two weeks later, we're looking at this.

406
00:46:41,745 --> 00:46:52,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the goal for that month, et cetera, to keep us on track and to make sure that residents, the public business owners, have the best possible chance of knowing, I think I might wanna weigh in on this.

407
00:46:53,131 --> 00:46:56,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm gonna save that date on my calendar and make it really easy for folks.

408
00:46:57,013 --> 00:46:57,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, President Behrs.

409
00:46:58,814 --> 00:47:00,835
[SPEAKER_00]: And even more so, I think it's actually less granular.

410
00:47:00,955 --> 00:47:07,098
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've done that, but it's like a slide in a presentation or a paragraph or a section in a memo

411
00:47:07,922 --> 00:47:20,526
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, I'm just thinking of like how people access information and, you know, if someone doesn't open the memo or watch the meeting or see the presentation, it's really more of a presentation question to me than anything else.

412
00:47:20,566 --> 00:47:30,630
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how do we take that information that we've already kind of discussed and put out a little more formally and turn what is a slide in a presentation into a flyer, something like that.

413
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:32,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally.

414
00:47:33,151 --> 00:47:33,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Director Hunt, go ahead.

415
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:51,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so I think that there's a little conversation we could have tonight on specificity if we don't have questions like on the zoning that's being proposed, but that in my mind it would be probably a good idea.

416
00:47:52,805 --> 00:47:58,148
[SPEAKER_07]: We always, public hearings are legally advertised, and sometimes we push them out a little bit more than that.

417
00:47:58,569 --> 00:48:02,891
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think this is the right time and point to do a press release kind of update.

418
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:14,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe there's a flyer, there's a graphic, and there's a long text that goes with it that says, you know, Mystic Ab, zoning, and this is what we're doing.

419
00:48:14,697 --> 00:48:17,699
[SPEAKER_07]: And these are the dates of the public hearings at the planning board.

420
00:48:17,759 --> 00:48:19,120
[SPEAKER_07]: And we put that out in a way

421
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:22,922
[SPEAKER_07]: that is understandable by the public.

422
00:48:24,323 --> 00:48:27,125
[SPEAKER_07]: We could also do postcard mailings.

423
00:48:27,205 --> 00:48:33,208
[SPEAKER_07]: My office does those for legal notices, and they're easy.

424
00:48:33,228 --> 00:48:43,234
[SPEAKER_07]: They're a little legally looking, but we like the postcards because people, they don't have to open an envelope to figure out what's in there, right?

425
00:48:43,394 --> 00:48:44,755
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that kind of catches your eye.

426
00:48:48,183 --> 00:49:01,130
[SPEAKER_07]: with that listing of the public hearing dates, we could also put out like our draft, here's when we intend to be looking at various other portions of the zoning.

427
00:49:01,871 --> 00:49:14,638
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would hesitate to guarantee dates in a document, but I'd be comfortable saying like during the month of, we'll be focusing on this, and in the spring, we'll be focusing on that.

428
00:49:15,798 --> 00:49:26,041
[SPEAKER_07]: And these public meetings will be listed on the city's website, and you can go to this URL for all the documents and updates.

429
00:49:26,441 --> 00:49:40,045
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we push that out through press release, social media, and maybe a postcard to, at least for the zoning area, the zoning property owners, I think that would really help with setting some context for people.

430
00:49:40,065 --> 00:49:42,326
[SPEAKER_07]: So my suggestion.

431
00:49:44,445 --> 00:49:44,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

432
00:49:45,467 --> 00:49:52,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think there's a lot of things that we could do that would strengthen our signaling overall.

433
00:49:52,926 --> 00:49:53,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, Emily.

434
00:49:56,093 --> 00:49:57,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you Chair Collins.

435
00:49:57,734 --> 00:50:20,367
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to confirm that we would be happy to revisit our schedule and that long spreadsheet and come back at the next working group and then obviously provide this committee with which topics and which geographic areas we expect to bring forward in each month and just confirm that with you so that that document can get out.

436
00:50:20,427 --> 00:50:21,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Be more than happy to do that.

437
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:23,090
[SPEAKER_04]: great.

438
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:23,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Emily.

439
00:50:23,891 --> 00:50:31,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that that would be a great candidate for, uh, the steering committee to look at in advance of the next committee meeting so that we can.

440
00:50:31,815 --> 00:50:32,696
[SPEAKER_04]: We already re center.

441
00:50:33,216 --> 00:50:44,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, once the Mr Court, Mr Gavin Porter District is on its way, um, to the regular meeting and then the CBB and we can touch base on where we go from here and bring that back to the committee.

442
00:50:45,784 --> 00:50:46,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

443
00:50:51,417 --> 00:50:53,018
[SPEAKER_00]: took us on a bit of a tangent there.

444
00:50:53,038 --> 00:50:55,339
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate everybody going through it.

445
00:50:55,759 --> 00:51:02,441
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have one question going back to the development standards.

446
00:51:03,142 --> 00:51:09,684
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that we're hoping, or the plan is that at the end, there's kind of a realignment of the development standards.

447
00:51:11,165 --> 00:51:20,269
[SPEAKER_00]: And that probably coincides with the catching of like the artifacts and other quirks that end up

448
00:51:22,492 --> 00:51:24,733
[SPEAKER_00]: happening because of the way that we're doing this.

449
00:51:26,354 --> 00:51:49,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Would the intent of that be that there would be like a development standard section that's outside of the corridor specific sections and what basically would there then just be like a development standard section and then it would have the corridor separate breakdowns within them or just could we go a little bit more into that?

450
00:51:49,848 --> 00:51:51,769
[SPEAKER_00]: Just want to clarify that for myself.

451
00:51:55,441 --> 00:52:08,790
[SPEAKER_10]: With your permission, yes, that is the idea is that you would have a section 94 dash whatever that is, that is development standards and then within each of the districts.

452
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:21,558
[SPEAKER_10]: So in this case, Mystic Avenue, Salem Avenue or Medford Square or West Medford Square, there would be a section that says points to the development standards and then says, if necessary,

453
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:26,842
[SPEAKER_10]: these are modified in this way for this particular geographic area.

454
00:52:27,262 --> 00:52:45,452
[SPEAKER_10]: So that you would, and it was a question that came out of one of our working group meetings, also a discussion that Paola and I and the rest of the team members had, but this idea that we wanted the development standards to be relatively consistent throughout the city.

455
00:52:46,249 --> 00:52:57,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and then just tweaks for the different type of development needed for, or, you know, the different type of sort of built environment needed for each of the specialized districts.

456
00:52:59,974 --> 00:53:00,255
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.

457
00:53:00,295 --> 00:53:00,655
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

458
00:53:00,695 --> 00:53:01,335
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.

459
00:53:03,916 --> 00:53:04,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

460
00:53:04,696 --> 00:53:05,156
[SPEAKER_04]: President bears.

461
00:53:05,176 --> 00:53:05,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

462
00:53:08,898 --> 00:53:08,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

463
00:53:11,363 --> 00:53:17,586
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a great next step in front of us in terms of the zoning proposal before us.

464
00:53:19,307 --> 00:53:38,875
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we have some really great suggestions for how to go forward with our work plan and also pair that with kind of some renewed efforts around how to structure that, how to be telegraphing that structure and what's coming down the pipeline better to all participants, to all stakeholders as we go on in this process.

465
00:53:39,576 --> 00:53:40,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan?

466
00:53:47,381 --> 00:53:47,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

467
00:53:49,283 --> 00:53:51,787
[SPEAKER_11]: So I did have a very quick question, a comment.

468
00:53:51,807 --> 00:53:59,357
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, I'm extremely impressed with certainly everything that I had suggested language on or had advocated for.

469
00:53:59,497 --> 00:54:00,999
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything has gotten in here.

470
00:54:01,019 --> 00:54:02,040
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitions are great.

471
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:03,802
[SPEAKER_11]: Like everything looks wonderful.

472
00:54:03,902 --> 00:54:05,765
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you so much for all your work.

473
00:54:06,205 --> 00:54:10,828
[SPEAKER_11]: making sure that all of these different pieces from the different counselors made it in here.

474
00:54:10,848 --> 00:54:19,154
[SPEAKER_11]: And my only question looking at this whole thing is really about the environmental resilience piece and the table of development incentive bonuses.

475
00:54:20,675 --> 00:54:31,402
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know we have had a tiny bit of discussion about green score, and here it is, just there's one line, like ideal green score is one additional story.

476
00:54:32,443 --> 00:54:34,384
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just curious, like how does that,

477
00:54:36,025 --> 00:54:47,129
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we haven't passed the green scoring yet, so I'm curious what that looks like if we pass this and we do green score later.

478
00:54:48,889 --> 00:54:50,830
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just curious about how that fits together.

479
00:54:52,964 --> 00:54:53,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, Emily.

480
00:54:53,864 --> 00:54:54,965
[SPEAKER_04]: And great question, Councilor Hillian.

481
00:54:55,645 --> 00:54:56,825
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an excellent question.

482
00:54:56,905 --> 00:55:05,369
[SPEAKER_10]: And in some ways it ties in neatly with what I said earlier about the community solar and the need to bring specific topics back as well as geography.

483
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:09,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Green score, we have been developing, we've been working on it.

484
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:17,953
[SPEAKER_10]: It needs a little bit more attention from the working group before we bring it forward to you, just because it's a complex discussion.

485
00:55:17,973 --> 00:55:19,634
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to make sure that we get it right.

486
00:55:20,355 --> 00:55:23,259
[SPEAKER_10]: There are a couple of other topics in there.

487
00:55:23,459 --> 00:55:33,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Green score covers some of the environmental resiliency and the climate plans recommendations, but not all of it.

488
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,177
[SPEAKER_10]: So we do want to revisit that.

489
00:55:36,098 --> 00:55:43,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Director Hunt mentioned parking, which is something else that we also realized was something that we wanted to pay attention to.

490
00:55:43,304 --> 00:55:58,516
[SPEAKER_10]: But I, for one, would like to include that with a more specific strategy around parking, which would include the transportation demand management that we talked about a little bit earlier in the process would include some other elements.

491
00:55:58,536 --> 00:56:04,261
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think among the topics, I would anticipate that green score is likely to come first.

492
00:56:05,701 --> 00:56:18,966
[SPEAKER_10]: probably then the parking and then the additional, because there's some elements of thinking about parking and transportation demand management that would fit nicely into the climate action plan recommendations.

493
00:56:19,526 --> 00:56:30,730
[SPEAKER_10]: And then after those are done, probably coming back and saying, okay, what else have we not done for the climate action plan and what other topics are missing from this?

494
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:33,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for bringing that the green score up.

495
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,221
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot to mention it earlier.

496
00:56:38,344 --> 00:56:39,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Emily.

497
00:56:39,345 --> 00:56:41,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan, do you have anything else that you want to add to that?

498
00:56:47,733 --> 00:56:48,614
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, sounds like a no.

499
00:56:49,134 --> 00:56:49,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lemmon, go ahead.

500
00:56:51,547 --> 00:56:51,927
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

501
00:56:52,128 --> 00:57:07,060
[SPEAKER_12]: Just like to really quickly request that when, at the meeting when TDM is discussed specifically, I would appreciate some forewarning on that because I think it would be appropriate to invite the Lower Mystic TMA to that meeting.

502
00:57:07,601 --> 00:57:16,208
[SPEAKER_12]: They have been asking about it, so I'm not sure if there will be a specific meeting about that in itself or if it will just come up.

503
00:57:17,529 --> 00:57:21,640
[SPEAKER_12]: as a topic in future meetings, but in any case, I'm forewarning that you'll appreciate it.

504
00:57:23,183 --> 00:57:23,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

505
00:57:24,004 --> 00:57:25,184
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll definitely put a flag on that.

506
00:57:25,244 --> 00:57:26,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Director Hunt, go ahead.

507
00:57:27,085 --> 00:57:38,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Process-wise, I just want to suggest that that's the kind of local expert that we would actually want to talk with in our working group meetings in advance of actually presenting a public presentation.

508
00:57:38,832 --> 00:57:40,893
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to be able to come here with a recommendation.

509
00:57:41,554 --> 00:57:49,138
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I want to hear and have those conversations with the experts before we get public.

510
00:57:56,107 --> 00:57:56,327
[SPEAKER_04]: great.

511
00:57:56,427 --> 00:57:57,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Director.

512
00:57:57,388 --> 00:58:01,111
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Lueb, go ahead.

513
00:58:02,092 --> 00:58:03,413
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I do.

514
00:58:03,453 --> 00:58:16,203
[SPEAKER_12]: There are some folks from there that have been speaking with me, and they even previously met with City staff, but I think it would be

515
00:58:18,084 --> 00:58:21,025
[SPEAKER_12]: wise to invite them to the planning meetings.

516
00:58:21,065 --> 00:58:39,952
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I can't go to them because of, obviously because of open meeting law considerations, but I know that just on some emails, their contact information is available and they previously met with me and Laurel Siegel, but that was a while ago.

517
00:58:40,012 --> 00:58:44,954
[SPEAKER_12]: So just having them be more included in the workflow, I think would be a good idea.

518
00:58:48,444 --> 00:58:48,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

519
00:58:49,164 --> 00:58:49,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

520
00:58:50,125 --> 00:58:50,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Lohmann.

521
00:58:50,846 --> 00:58:51,906
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that suggestion.

522
00:58:51,966 --> 00:58:55,609
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a good idea to bring another local expert in on that conversation.

523
00:58:57,650 --> 00:59:09,918
[SPEAKER_04]: If there aren't any other specific questions or comments at this time, I think it might be valuable before we start talking about next steps, a vote on this package and where it goes after it leaves this committee, if that's how the vote goes.

524
00:59:11,219 --> 00:59:14,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Emily or Paola, if you wouldn't mind pulling the zoning map up on the screen,

525
00:59:15,081 --> 00:59:18,483
[SPEAKER_04]: and just quickly giving us a walk through that visual brief description.

526
00:59:18,543 --> 00:59:29,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I know this is materials we've all seen before, but just to have another look at the updated zoning map with the four sub districts and just to describe once again the characterization of each.

527
00:59:34,532 --> 00:59:34,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

528
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Madam Chair.

529
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,421
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will be, sorry.

530
00:59:49,121 --> 00:59:54,762
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the Mystic Avenue plan that has been, the land use that has been discussed.

531
00:59:55,442 --> 01:00:01,664
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the last one with the latest amendment that were decided in the previous planning.

532
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:13,046
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the four different sub districts in the Mystic Avenue corridor district, mixed use one in the most historical area, smaller scale.

533
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:23,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we have the mix used to in the southern part of Mystic Avenue, uh, small to medium, and then we have, uh, mix, um, three.

534
01:00:23,765 --> 01:00:28,788
[SPEAKER_01]: In the northern part of the Mystic Avenue, uh, next to the highway.

535
01:00:28,808 --> 01:00:33,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is the biggest, uh, scale that we're going to find Mystic Avenue.

536
01:00:33,811 --> 01:00:36,292
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the in pink, we have the commercial.

537
01:00:36,872 --> 01:00:43,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the latest amendment was to bring the mix one again, um, into this area.

538
01:00:44,357 --> 01:00:50,580
[SPEAKER_01]: where the so that the housing and the park was not abutting the commercial.

539
01:00:54,822 --> 01:00:55,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

540
01:00:55,482 --> 01:00:56,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much, Paula.

541
01:00:56,503 --> 01:00:57,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate that overview.

542
01:00:58,904 --> 01:01:08,048
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, committee members know this, but just for any residents that didn't catch the past couple meetings when we were also reviewing this map.

543
01:01:11,246 --> 01:01:15,268
[SPEAKER_04]: on a more, you know, kind of section by section basis.

544
01:01:16,148 --> 01:01:34,597
[SPEAKER_04]: This has gone through a couple of minor changes from the original proposal about a month ago, including, you know, finessing, especially on the southern side of the map, where MX3 ends and commercial begins, making that carve out in the commercial zone on the southern side of Mystic.

545
01:01:35,557 --> 01:01:48,241
[SPEAKER_04]: the Hicks area, creating, yes, as Paola is highlighting, inserting mixed-use one, which seems more appropriate for that area, around the residential, the park, and the school.

546
01:01:48,421 --> 01:01:52,902
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to highlight some of the small changes that this map went through.

547
01:01:52,922 --> 01:01:55,383
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll recognize Councillor Callahan.

548
01:01:57,503 --> 01:01:57,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

549
01:01:57,883 --> 01:02:02,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a quick question, since Director Hunt had mentioned it.

550
01:02:02,966 --> 01:02:06,308
[SPEAKER_11]: There was like a sort of adult stuff allowed.

551
01:02:07,448 --> 01:02:10,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Where is that going to be re-added back in here on this map?

552
01:02:12,911 --> 01:02:15,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, with your permission, Madam Chair.

553
01:02:16,053 --> 01:02:19,895
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be included in only the commercial area.

554
01:02:19,935 --> 01:02:24,338
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will be where you see the pink fuchsia kind of color.

555
01:02:25,092 --> 01:02:29,716
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where we bring back the adult use in this area.

556
01:02:30,376 --> 01:02:30,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

557
01:02:31,878 --> 01:02:32,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

558
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:34,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

559
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:35,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the question, Councillor Callahan.

560
01:02:36,381 --> 01:02:39,023
[SPEAKER_04]: And just on that, in case it wasn't touched on this meeting, I'm not sure.

561
01:02:39,063 --> 01:02:43,627
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my understanding that we are legally required to have that use allowed somewhere in the city.

562
01:02:44,568 --> 01:02:49,051
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that we're going out of our way to make sure that adult use establishments are present on Mystic Ave.

563
01:02:49,091 --> 01:02:53,475
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that we are legally required to have them be allowed somewhere.

564
01:02:55,751 --> 01:02:59,712
[SPEAKER_10]: With your permission, Chair, Madam Chair, that is correct.

565
01:03:00,072 --> 01:03:06,534
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe that, or as our understanding was, that was allowed in the C2 originally.

566
01:03:06,654 --> 01:03:11,135
[SPEAKER_10]: This is where the C2 was, and we are replacing the C2 with this change.

567
01:03:11,175 --> 01:03:17,837
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're merely adding it back just as Paola just mentioned, just to the commercial area of Mystic Avenue.

568
01:03:21,558 --> 01:03:22,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for that clarification.

569
01:03:25,148 --> 01:03:25,388
[SPEAKER_04]: questions.

570
01:03:25,408 --> 01:03:30,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Um if there aren't any other questions or comments on the updated.

571
01:03:30,351 --> 01:03:30,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, go ahead.

572
01:03:30,951 --> 01:03:31,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Planner Evans.

573
01:03:34,573 --> 01:03:36,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

574
01:03:36,334 --> 01:03:38,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to go back to the green score.

575
01:03:38,455 --> 01:03:47,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Um if they're not going to be passed at the same time, will it be some kind of placeholder or, um, previous minimum previous surface?

576
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I just don't want to make sure that we're not in a

577
01:03:53,627 --> 01:03:55,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Um someone could develop a property with.

578
01:03:56,570 --> 01:03:56,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Um.

579
01:03:58,032 --> 01:03:59,654
[SPEAKER_06]: No pervious surface at all.

580
01:04:00,475 --> 01:04:02,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless I'm overlooking something in the.

581
01:04:03,098 --> 01:04:03,799
[SPEAKER_06]: In the draft.

582
01:04:04,219 --> 01:04:13,389
[SPEAKER_06]: But is there some I'm just trying to think of what can we do that won't slow this down while we're waiting to develop the green score, and maybe there's a swap or something once it's established.

583
01:04:14,858 --> 01:04:15,018
[SPEAKER_01]: question.

584
01:04:15,038 --> 01:04:16,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Um with your permission.

585
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:19,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Um yeah, I can start.

586
01:04:19,761 --> 01:04:22,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I believe anything you can add to it.

587
01:04:23,504 --> 01:04:29,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh as I understand in your zoning at the moment, you don't have a requirement for minimum previous surface.

588
01:04:29,928 --> 01:04:32,890
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a requirement for open space landscape.

589
01:04:33,531 --> 01:04:38,674
[SPEAKER_01]: But in open space landscape, you can also have impervious surface like

590
01:04:45,327 --> 01:04:46,768
[SPEAKER_01]: At the moment, we didn't have it.

591
01:04:46,788 --> 01:04:54,475
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's a good suggestion to start with a pervious surface and integrate a minimum surface in this district.

592
01:04:55,416 --> 01:04:56,677
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that that is great.

593
01:04:56,717 --> 01:05:06,185
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I understand in your zoning and your standards and requirements, I don't think that there is a. Correct me if I'm wrong.

594
01:05:08,137 --> 01:05:16,997
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would just add to that, I think that the suggestion that perhaps there's a placeholder until the green score comes in is something that is certainly doable.

595
01:05:17,945 --> 01:05:22,108
[SPEAKER_10]: in this stage and then we can revisit as we talked about reopening the book.

596
01:05:22,548 --> 01:05:25,070
[SPEAKER_10]: We can reopen the book if necessary on this district.

597
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:28,512
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we are hoping to bring the green score as quickly as possible.

598
01:05:28,952 --> 01:05:32,034
[SPEAKER_10]: So probably with the Salem Street corridor.

599
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:46,284
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't think it will be long, but we also don't want to have the possibility of somebody applying on this when the green score might come in two weeks later, but we haven't

600
01:05:46,849 --> 01:05:59,235
[SPEAKER_10]: given it the ability to cover for that application that would then be allowed under this zoning, the green score then wouldn't apply to it because it applied under zoning.

601
01:05:59,296 --> 01:06:04,378
[SPEAKER_10]: So yes, we can look at putting a tweak in here that would be a placeholder until we come back.

602
01:06:04,478 --> 01:06:05,359
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a good suggestion.

603
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:08,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Planner Evans.

604
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:13,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a really important point to make sure that, you know,

605
01:06:14,045 --> 01:06:27,153
[SPEAKER_04]: environmentally unfriendly, highly pervious surface doesn't get inadvertently grandfathered in while we're waiting, you know, a short number of weeks, it sounds like for the green score to be able to be considered as a global strategy.

606
01:06:28,314 --> 01:06:28,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

607
01:06:31,216 --> 01:06:36,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions or notes before I start discussing our next steps after this committee meeting?

608
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:39,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

609
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:39,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

610
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:40,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

611
01:06:40,661 --> 01:06:41,542
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um.

612
01:06:42,682 --> 01:06:45,785
[SPEAKER_04]: As is true of all updates to zoning amendments.

613
01:06:46,825 --> 01:06:47,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Um.

614
01:06:48,286 --> 01:06:56,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that this has been considered in committee if it were to pass into the next step would be to pass it into a regular meeting with the City Council there.

615
01:06:56,072 --> 01:07:00,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Procedurally it must be immediately referred to the Community Development Board for their review and

616
01:07:06,839 --> 01:07:12,923
[SPEAKER_04]: and then the two votes to codify it into our into our code of zoning ordinances.

617
01:07:14,924 --> 01:07:23,629
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is another several slate of meetings that we will have to get the input of the planning board and to have it appear before the full assembly of the City Council.

618
01:07:23,649 --> 01:07:28,092
[SPEAKER_04]: That's three more times before it is fully codified.

619
01:07:29,053 --> 01:07:30,774
[SPEAKER_04]: So I always appreciate that in the

620
01:07:31,627 --> 01:07:32,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Zoning updating process.

621
01:07:32,688 --> 01:07:33,469
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really baked in.

622
01:07:33,489 --> 01:07:46,463
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's really no way to avoid a lot of eyes on this highly technical, very important, very consequential changes, and I'm really glad that that is written into the procedure of how this gets done because, of course, we

623
01:07:47,944 --> 01:07:48,664
[SPEAKER_04]: This step is important.

624
01:07:48,704 --> 01:07:49,285
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very detailed.

625
01:07:49,325 --> 01:07:50,025
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very technical.

626
01:07:50,505 --> 01:07:58,289
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to get it right because what we're doing here is we're implementing the goals and visions of the community that was kind of enshrined in the comprehensive plan.

627
01:07:58,550 --> 01:08:05,473
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm grateful that we get to include a lot of hands onto this process.

628
01:08:07,294 --> 01:08:10,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions about our next steps in moving this package forward?

629
01:08:16,147 --> 01:08:16,687
[SPEAKER_04]: seeing none.

630
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:30,991
[SPEAKER_04]: So I understand that we have, you know, this short list of tweaks that the zoning consultant will consider in between now and when this goes to the Community Development Board, the changes that we discussed on this meeting.

631
01:08:32,232 --> 01:08:42,895
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll be sure in our steering meetings to make sure that those are surfaced and make sure that all those boxes are ticked off before this comes back to the City Council for those final two votes.

632
01:08:48,444 --> 01:08:55,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I hear, before I recognize public participation, is there a motion on the floor?

633
01:08:55,392 --> 01:09:00,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go to public participation first if counselors want to think about it.

634
01:09:04,283 --> 01:09:07,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll recognize Martha Andres.

635
01:09:07,046 --> 01:09:07,787
[SPEAKER_04]: You have three minutes.

636
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:11,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thank you.

637
01:09:13,022 --> 01:09:15,583
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a request and a question.

638
01:09:15,603 --> 01:09:17,205
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess two requests.

639
01:09:17,385 --> 01:09:27,932
[SPEAKER_09]: One is, would you please post the updated maps that are being discussed at this meeting?

640
01:09:28,032 --> 01:09:31,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I believe the website has comments through July.

641
01:09:33,403 --> 01:09:36,485
[SPEAKER_09]: on a June plan, but I'm not sure.

642
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:41,529
[SPEAKER_09]: I was not able to find the plans that you're talking about right now.

643
01:09:41,569 --> 01:09:47,013
[SPEAKER_09]: And I realize the changes are minor, but I appreciate being able to see them.

644
01:09:49,135 --> 01:09:57,061
[SPEAKER_09]: The other question is, I'm glad to hear you're consulting with expert partners.

645
01:09:57,401 --> 01:10:01,824
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would ask that you look at Somerville's zoning.

646
01:10:02,910 --> 01:10:20,717
[SPEAKER_09]: at the border where Mystic Ave goes into Somerville because the high-intensity C2 use abuts, I believe it abuts residential use, and particularly there's a lot of affordable housing along Mystic Ave in the

647
01:10:22,230 --> 01:10:25,632
[SPEAKER_09]: area immediately to the south of this C-2 district.

648
01:10:25,732 --> 01:10:45,986
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would ask that you consider flexibility in the C-2 area that would allow in the future affordable housing or multifamily housing to be developed as it has been in Somerville, both by nonprofit organizations and the housing authority.

649
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:49,699
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

650
01:10:49,999 --> 01:10:50,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Martha.

651
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:51,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Really appreciate that.

652
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:57,581
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to flag what Director Hunt put in the comments, we have these maps up on the website.

653
01:10:57,601 --> 01:11:01,522
[SPEAKER_04]: They are kind of buried, so I don't falter for not being able to find them.

654
01:11:02,382 --> 01:11:06,884
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in the chat under phase two, October 23 meeting.

655
01:11:06,924 --> 01:11:07,804
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also attached to

656
01:11:09,969 --> 01:11:21,011
[SPEAKER_04]: the agenda for this meeting on the City Council's public portal, but I'm gonna, well, maybe we can chat about how to just reorder the items on the city's zoning website so that the most current materials are easier to find.

657
01:11:21,071 --> 01:11:22,912
[SPEAKER_04]: But those are online for you to check out if you'd like.

658
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:24,312
[SPEAKER_04]: President Behrs, go ahead.

659
01:11:25,472 --> 01:11:29,693
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just wanted to say thanks, Martha, and I wanted to know what you just noted.

660
01:11:30,873 --> 01:11:39,295
[SPEAKER_00]: Chair Collins, which is that, you know, the most recent, I mean, I think there's a few language changes that aren't yet up on the Civic Clerk website, but

661
01:11:40,778 --> 01:11:40,838
[SPEAKER_00]: Um.

662
01:11:40,898 --> 01:11:48,082
[SPEAKER_00]: Draft as a Friday on the map as a Friday are up at, um, our council agenda portal and attached his files there.

663
01:11:48,882 --> 01:11:49,042
[SPEAKER_00]: Um.

664
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:53,044
[SPEAKER_00]: And appreciate the comment about flexibility.

665
01:11:54,065 --> 01:11:55,205
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it looks like.

666
01:11:56,366 --> 01:11:58,007
[SPEAKER_00]: The C two.

667
01:11:58,027 --> 01:11:59,948
[SPEAKER_00]: The zoning.

668
01:12:00,748 --> 01:12:03,790
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it actually a but a commercial and an auto

669
01:12:08,914 --> 01:12:12,755
[SPEAKER_00]: In Somerville, and then about so residential, but I think it's worth certainly.

670
01:12:13,476 --> 01:12:17,037
[SPEAKER_00]: As this moves through the planning board, if they want to take a look at that, the community development board.

671
01:12:17,517 --> 01:12:24,880
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if there's something we could do there, but that math inspection site, and then the used auto shop immediately to it's.

672
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,441
[SPEAKER_00]: East those are actually in Somerville.

673
01:12:29,341 --> 01:12:33,763
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it looks like there's, I can't quite read the summerville map right now.

674
01:12:33,783 --> 01:12:33,823
[SPEAKER_00]: Um.

675
01:12:35,362 --> 01:12:37,183
[SPEAKER_00]: or I can't quite tell exactly what they put there.

676
01:12:37,203 --> 01:12:45,787
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it might be a mid-rise three district, because I have seen those very narrow, very thin housing units, which I've always been interested in.

677
01:12:45,847 --> 01:12:49,409
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like a great way to use an interesting lot for affordable housing.

678
01:12:51,050 --> 01:12:57,453
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are actually auto uses on the Somerville side as well, abutting that C2 on Mystic Ave.

679
01:13:02,036 --> 01:13:02,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Behrs.

680
01:13:03,697 --> 01:13:04,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Planner Evans, go ahead.

681
01:13:08,237 --> 01:13:08,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

682
01:13:09,738 --> 01:13:14,422
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to note that the area over there is the least walkable.

683
01:13:15,162 --> 01:13:23,369
[SPEAKER_06]: And one thing about the housing authority units in Somerville is they've always put them on the edges of their city in the least desirable areas.

684
01:13:24,069 --> 01:13:27,772
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to make sure that we're not perpetuating that.

685
01:13:28,132 --> 01:13:32,856
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're allowing housing all throughout this corridor where no housing is allowed currently.

686
01:13:35,421 --> 01:13:39,444
[SPEAKER_06]: We can definitely look at that, but I don't know if that's what we want to do.

687
01:13:42,747 --> 01:13:43,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Planner Evans.

688
01:13:44,068 --> 01:13:45,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I appreciate the suggestion.

689
01:13:45,369 --> 01:13:46,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's important.

690
01:13:47,351 --> 01:13:55,518
[SPEAKER_04]: And certainly we would want to give it a thorough look if that recommendation came back to make sure that it's appropriately cited.

691
01:14:00,342 --> 01:14:00,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lemmon.

692
01:14:03,443 --> 01:14:07,245
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no more public comment or input from staff.

693
01:14:07,365 --> 01:14:11,447
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to make a motion to refer to a regular meeting.

694
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:20,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to refer out the draft zoning proposal to a regular meeting of the City Council.

695
01:14:21,532 --> 01:14:21,712
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

696
01:14:21,732 --> 01:14:24,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a second on the motion?

697
01:14:26,374 --> 01:14:26,734
[SPEAKER_00]: Second.

698
01:14:27,094 --> 01:14:28,495
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a minor amendment

699
01:14:30,796 --> 01:14:30,916
[SPEAKER_04]: motion.

700
01:14:30,936 --> 01:14:32,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Great seconded by President Bears.

701
01:14:33,677 --> 01:14:35,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like to make your amendment motion?

702
01:14:36,018 --> 01:14:36,358
[SPEAKER_04]: We can.

703
01:14:37,359 --> 01:14:44,242
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just a slight language amendment to move to refer the draft Mystic Avenue zoning.

704
01:14:45,022 --> 01:14:46,443
[SPEAKER_00]: Quarter district proposal.

705
01:14:47,363 --> 01:14:48,243
[SPEAKER_00]: To the council.

706

[SPEAKER_00]: Next regular meeting.

707
01:14:51,225 --> 01:14:51,385
[SPEAKER_00]: Um.

708
01:14:52,145 --> 01:14:53,826
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be clear that it's the missing Avenue

709
01:15:03,853 --> 01:15:04,133
[SPEAKER_04]: second.

710
01:15:08,116 --> 01:15:13,259
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a motion to refer the Mystic Avenue corridor district zoning proposal.

711
01:15:14,199 --> 01:15:17,982
[SPEAKER_04]: To the next City Council regular meeting and to keep the main paper committee.

712
01:15:18,722 --> 01:15:18,962
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

713
01:15:19,323 --> 01:15:19,663

[SPEAKER_04]: District zoning proposal is referred to the next regular meeting of the City Council, and we will continue our work of, um.

725
01:16:09,413 --> 01:16:15,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Going through all of the zoning citywide in this committee in tandem with city stakeholders, the
