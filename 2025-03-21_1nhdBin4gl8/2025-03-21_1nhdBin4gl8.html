    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=17.404s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=17.805s">With</a>  the seventh present, none absent, please rise to receive the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=38.678s">Council</a>  accommodations, 15-793. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=39.96s">Council</a>  accommodations to Henry and Evelyn Miller on their continued supporting work within the disability community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=50.193s">This</a>  was offered by Council Penta, so at this time I invite Council Penta to come up.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=82.992s">This</a>  recognition tonight is for a gentleman and his wife, Henry and Evelyn. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=89.518s">They're</a>  like out in the community, there are a lot of silent people that do things on behalf of other folks, not looking for any recognition, not looking for any prestige, just letting folks <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=101.053s">know</a>  that there are other people out there to help them. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=103.434s">And</a>  since I've gotten to know Henry and Elephant, they're very quiet people. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=107.835s">They're</a>  not looking for much praise. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=109.215s">They're</a>  not looking for anything that basically says, hey, look at me, look what I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=113.216s">But</a>  they fortunately got recognized this past November by ARC, a nationally recognized organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=119.782s">group</a>  of individuals, an association for whatever the reason my name might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=124.645s">And</a>  they go out there and they help out folks who are intellectually and physically disabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=129.849s">And</a>  it's not just in the city of Medford, it's in other and surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=133.792s">So</a>  it gives me great pleasure, it gives me great pleasure to make this proclamation be read publicly. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=140.476s">And</a>  it goes as a presentation from the Medford City Council to Henry and Evelyn Milleran. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=147.302s">in</a>  recognition for your continued support within the disability community in Medford and its surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=152.825s">Your</a>  efforts were most recently recognized at the November meeting of ARC, a nationally recognized organization that deals with the intellectual and physical disabilities of those less fortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=162.991s">The</a>  Medford City Council extends its deepest appreciation and gratitude for your efforts in improving the quality of life for the citizenry of Medford and all those that you have helped out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=173.016s">I'd</a>  like to have the both of you come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=174.577s">Andrea</a>  and Evelyn, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=191.147s">And</a>  the interesting component about these two, they're husband and wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=195.371s">And</a>  so not only do they do their husband and wife team, they are a husband and wife team for these intellectual and physical disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=202.679s">And</a>  that's a great compliment to the both of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=204.701s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Henry Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=205.421s">When</a>  my wife is here, I'll talk.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=216.097s">It</a>  is amazing as a parent, you know you are a parent, this is your job to take care of your child, but at the same time, you reach out to other parents because of your experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=229.388s">Raising</a>  a child with disabilities, raising a child is difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=235.193s">In</a>  addition, having a disability, it multiplies by 100. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=239.457s">Our</a>  son used to sleep only two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=244.647s">And</a>  out of the 24 hours, our lives was consumed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=249.47s">22</a>  out of the 24 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=254.734s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=256.235s">We</a>  were doing it just, we love our child. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=261.338s">We</a>  didn't think people would take notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=264.601s">And</a>  we're very grateful for what we're doing and will continue to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=272.435s">And</a>  again, thank you for the recognition.</p>

    <p>[Henry Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=283.669s">You</a>  always let the first go. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=285.91s">I'm</a>  a lucky man. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=287.47s">I'm</a>  a lucky man because I'm living on the city of my birthplace in America. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=293.932s">You</a>  know, with my accent, I was not born here. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=296.533s">I</a>  came here. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=298.033s">I</a>  was going to medical school. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=299.774s">I</a>  ran into issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=301.534s">But</a>  I had a lot of people look around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=303.935s">I</a>  had a lot of friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=304.915s">I</a>  had a lot of support. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=307.256s">And</a>  the most lucky, I had a wonderful wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=310.965s">My</a>  wife stood by me and helped me just like I helped her to do what we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=316.986s">After</a>  our son, we say we got to do for the elders. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=320.787s">We</a>  don't have one son anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=322.268s">We</a>  have a lot of sons. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=323.388s">We</a>  have daughters all across, not city of Medford, but across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=330.13s">It</a>  is touch that <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=332.137s">You</a>  know, I'm standing here, okay, receiving something that we achieved, not because we're doing it for fame, but we're doing it because this is our responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=344.254s">As</a>  citizens, this is our responsibility as parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=347.839s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=368.827s">Cheese.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=369.868s">Fromage.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=372.251s">You</a>  can sit here. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=374.693s">Cheese.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=375.073s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=375.914s">Merry</a>  Christmas. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=376.475s">You</a>  too.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=424.204s">Councilor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=428.045s">Mrs.</a>  Miller and happy birthday to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=441.951s">Motions</a>  orders and resolutions 15-800 offered by Councilor Penta be it resolved that the state of concern regarding the Medford Police Department <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=453.81s">be</a>  discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=454.471s">Councilor?</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=455.591s">Mr.</a>  President, and for those who might be watching and are interested in our public safety and our Medford Police Department, most recently there was an incident, a public health incident that took place in the Medford Police Department building. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=467.658s">And</a>  unfortunately it was a backup and it was a sewage backup into the building, which has caused a huge contamination of probably the basement area where the cells are downstairs and a whole host of other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=481.005s">This</a>  city council has been advocating for the past two years that their first priority would be for a new police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=487.75s">I</a>  in my campaign for mayor advocated that a police station would be my top priority on there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=493.473s">What</a>  I don't understand and what I don't see is the unfortunate need that what our method police officers go through male and female on a daily basis is not being recognized and has not been recognized for the past 28 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=506.382s">The</a>  unfortunate part is simply this. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=509.277s">We</a>  need a new method police station, and we need to have our public safety be brought up to par. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=513.78s">We're</a>  down by at least a minimum of 10 police officers, and that's rank and file. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=518.083s">That's</a>  not management or captains or lieutenants. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=520.124s">That's</a>  just rank and file patrolmen. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=521.625s">You</a>  know, there's a new administration coming on board, and I would hope that they're not looked at, the police department with John Desai, because maybe they didn't take the positive position in coming out and endorsing that particular person. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=534.614s">But</a>  the unfortunate part is, that should not be used against them. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=538.103s">Our</a>  public safety right now is at an all-time low. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=541.546s">Our</a>  police cruises are at an all-time low. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=544.369s">The</a>  building itself, the evidence room, and everything else that surrounds the Medford Police Department on a daily basis is at an all-time low. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=551.636s">It</a>  needs to be addressed now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=552.977s">It</a>  cannot wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=554.358s">Public</a>  safety in our community cannot be put on hold, and it should not be put on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=558.842s">And</a>  I would hope that anyone who might be watching, and anyone who has an interest in public safety, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=563.223s">And</a>  anyone who really believes that our Medford Police Department deserves better, because that's what our taxes are paying for, now is the time to come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=570.508s">You</a>  have a new administration coming on. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=572.089s">You</a>  have two new Councilors coming on. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=573.87s">The</a>  commitment has to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=575.631s">The</a>  finances has to be looked out for and sought out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=578.453s">And</a>  they can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=579.274s">Malden</a>  is a perfect example. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=580.975s">They're</a>  building a brand new police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=583.256s">They</a>  already have $9 million of the $18 million they've already secured in grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=587.699s">Medford</a>  cannot be put on hold any longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=590.362s">in</a>  regards to its police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=592.324s">And</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I would hope that this city council and the incoming city council holds new administration's feet to the fire to build that brand-new police station in behalf of not only the citizens of this community, but because of the public safety that is necessary and it's demanding right now on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=611.842s">All</a>  you have to do is talk to the police officers, talk to the chief of police, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=616.683s">and</a>  ask them what they think should be done as compared to what is being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=621.064s">I</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=622.284s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=623.544s">On</a>  the motion of Council paper that the paper be received and placed on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=629.045s">All</a>  those in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=631.986s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=633.906s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=636.067s">Offered</a>  by Councilor Penta, 15-801. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=638.447s">Be</a>  it resolved that the monthly taking <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=642.323s">since</a>  December of 2013 by the city administration of Comcast and Verizon ratepayers for public access TV be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=652.307s">Councilor</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=653.127s">Mr.</a>  President, since 2013 until now, December of 2015, it's been approximately 2 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=661.39s">And</a>  during that period of time, the city of Medford has intentionally, the city administration has intentionally taken ratepayers' money from Comcast and subsequently, since Verizon has come on board, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=671.443s">for</a>  what they call public access TV here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=674.604s">As</a>  of today, there is approximately $400,000, $450,000 sitting in the city coffers downstairs for public access television. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=684.607s">Public</a>  access television for which the mayor and its current administration has intentionally not allowed here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=692.09s">And</a>  who's at the loss of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=693.37s">And</a>  that's the cable TV subscribers. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=695.631s">Whether</a>  you agree or disagree with anyone running for office, no candidate <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=699.922s">for</a>  this past election had the opportunity to be on public access, to have their position stated, accepted, rejected, or even looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=707.926s">No</a>  citizen of this community has had the opportunity to have their shows relative to sports, family events, or anything that might be educational, historical, to be put on public access television. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=718.832s">During</a>  the past two years, what the mayor did is he implemented a three-member committee person, three-member person committee, for the purposes of reviewing public access here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=728.317s">Coming</a>  up with a concocted story, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=730.165s">that</a>  at some point in time, on or before Memorial Day of 2015, we would have something ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=736.768s">And</a>  we don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=737.349s">This</a>  is now December 2015, almost seven months later. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=741.791s">And</a>  the money just keeps coming out of your cable bill each and every month from Verizon and Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=748.674s">We</a>  had a public access meeting here for contract renewal with Comcast here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=754.577s">It</a>  was another 10-year deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=757.139s">And</a>  no one, not one person from the city administration, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=760.087s">Not</a>  one person showed up to defend and argue on behalf of Comcast customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=765.572s">I,</a>  along with nine other citizens, were here to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=768.634s">And</a>  this isn't because we're for or against. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=771.297s">It's</a>  a 10-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=772.578s">And</a>  in today's day and age, 10-year contracts are basically unheard of, especially when technology is so far advanced and it's ever-changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=780.625s">From</a>  California all the way to Massachusetts, there's a combination of maybe even a collage <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=787.092s">between</a>  Verizon and Comcast technicians working together, sharing their jobs together as they traverse across the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=795.178s">And</a>  yes, there is a movement out there that maybe public access is not the way to go because between Amazon and all these other technological programs that are out there between a combination of streaming or buying on Netflix or whatever it might be, the idea is out there that the city of Medford is not having it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=813.731s">With</a>  a proposal now that seems to be languishing, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=816.642s">of</a>  possibly putting it up in the vocational school, a place that would serve no purpose, especially in the winter months that we have right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=824.445s">It's</a>  dark out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=825.625s">The</a>  bus route would stop the person getting off at the bottom of the hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=828.727s">You</a>  would have to walk up to the top of the hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=830.527s">God</a>  knows where you would have to go into the building to get in. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=833.728s">It</a>  does not serve a purpose because all this type of information on public access needs to be located in a centrally located place. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=842.552s">And</a>  when you have something that's centrally located, it would bring more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=846.645s">City</a>  of Reading, Town of Reading, perfect example. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=849.507s">Not</a>  only do they have it in the downtown area, they have it on every Saturday morning at 11 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=854.051s">It's</a>  open to the public, coffee and donuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=855.992s">People</a>  can come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=857.053s">They</a>  show you how to make your own program. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=858.734s">They</a>  lease out, rent out their equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=861.076s">They</a>  show you how to use the equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=862.397s">They</a>  show you how to make your own programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=864.519s">I</a>  know we've had this discussion before over and over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=867.541s">But</a>  the fact of the matter is when we started this discussion, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=870.379s">There</a>  was nowhere near $450,000 sitting in the coffers downstairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=875.463s">And</a>  when in fact some of that money was used to pay for salaries of three individuals up at the high school in a program out there that has nothing to do and has nothing to do by law with cable access and public TV access here in the city of Medford, and nothing's been challenged in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=890.553s">What</a>  needs to be done in this city is that you need a revolution in thought where people can turn around and say, hey, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=898.193s">These</a>  are your dollars that are being taken out of your cable bill each and every month. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=903.077s">It's</a>  almost like coming out of your check. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=905.059s">You're</a>  paying for something that you're not getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=906.9s">$450,000</a>  is nothing to sneeze at, and you still have nothing for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=912.604s">It's</a>  unfortunate that we have to talk about this thing over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=916.107s">It's</a>  like the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=917.508s">There's</a>  a problem out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=918.948s">It's</a>  being discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=920.309s">It</a>  needs to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=921.569s">It</a>  needs to be revolutionized to the point it needs change. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=926.031s">New</a>  council coming in, new administration coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=928.712s">I</a>  hope the change takes effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=930.933s">But</a>  the people, you, the taxpayers out there, you're paying for this each and every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=935.434s">And</a>  you need to hold every one of the councils accountable, as well as the mayor, to make sure that your tax dollars, your cable bills, your water bills, anything that revolves around you paying for something in this community, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=947.363s">for</a>  a service or a tax or a bill is being accounted for and spent wisely. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=951.806s">I</a>  would hope, and I'll leave this as a thought rather than asking or putting the council on the spot, I would hope as a thought that the incoming city council does not allow this to continue to go on, that you come up and step up forward in demand of the new city administration, that you want cable access television here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=974.702s">That's</a>  what the people have paid for. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=976.802s">If</a>  not, give them the $450,000 back and figure out another way to do business here because it's absolutely wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=982.566s">It's</a>  almost stealing people's money and not doing what they're supposed to be doing with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=987.509s">And</a>  that is just so wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=989.571s">You</a>  don't tell our kids when you're making them grow up, this is the way life is supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=994.674s">You</a>  pay for something you're not getting or you take something that you don't deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=998.677s">That's</a>  exactly what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1000.859s">The</a>  city has taken your money that they don't deserve because they're not doing anything with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1005.041s">And</a>  at the same time, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1006.102s">You're</a>  paying for something that you're not getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1008.703s">It's</a>  a no-win situation for you, the ratepayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1011.905s">So</a>  with that being said, I would hope, Mr. President, and Rick, I know next year, I'm assuming if the deal is the way the deal is supposed to be, you as the president of the council, you would be able to tell, you know, this is where we're going to go with this particular direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1026.932s">And</a>  as far as that goes, Mr. President, I leave my comments as they are.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1035.504s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1036.624s">And</a>  I want to thank my colleague, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1039.567s">There's</a>  been no bigger advocate for public access in this community than Councilor Penta over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1045.612s">But</a>  he hit the nail on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1048.033s">Where</a>  else, Mr. President, can you pay for a service and not receive it, and then no one says anything? <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1055.339s">It'd</a>  be like going to the gas station and saying, give me $10 worth. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1058.302s">They</a>  give you $9, and then you say, thank you very much, and you leave.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1062.765s">It</a>  doesn't happen that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1064.702s">That's</a>  not the way it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1066.162s">And</a>  for several years now, residents of this community have been paying, take a look at your bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1071.663s">You're</a>  paying a franchise fee for local access peg, which is public access, the government and educational channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1079.845s">And</a>  for several years now, public access, in my opinion, which is probably the more important of the three, which allows people to come in and do local programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1089.903s">You</a>  know, it's great to watch 4, 5, 7 and all the History Channel and all those channels. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1094.626s">They</a>  got great programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1096.187s">But</a>  what better to have local access where you can watch a local show and talk about local issues and see local people on TV discussing politics, discussing athletics, discussing education, discussing a myriad of issues in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1112.659s">And</a>  we've been cheated out of that for several years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1115.961s">And</a>  it's unfortunate, as my council colleague mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1119.624s">It's</a>  almost half a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1122.35s">This</a>  is not chump change that we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1125.918s">It's</a>  a half a million dollars of ratepayer money. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1130.245s">And,</a>  you know, for the most part, you know, people may be looking for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1133.426s">But</a>  now public access has been out of the public realm for so many years now, I don't even think people know that they're not getting it anymore, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1142.65s">And</a>  it's a real shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1144.351s">It</a>  really is a real shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1146.112s">And</a>  I agree with my colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1148.373s">I</a>  hope, you know, under the city charter, the only one that signs contracts in the community is the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1154.835s">It's</a>  the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1156.316s">And</a>  the mayor has put together a contract <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1159.457s">with</a>  Verizon and Comcast, which includes public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1164.859s">And</a>  the mayor says, Verizon and Comcast, it's all right for you to charge every person under my city an additional fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1173.423s">But</a>  the mayor has been the one to neglect not to provide the service, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1178.445s">So</a>  the mayor is saying, Comcast, Verizon, go in and tax these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1182.286s">Take</a>  money out of their pocket. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1184.524s">but</a>  I'm not going to provide the service. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1186.504s">That's</a>  what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1187.725s">Because</a>  if you call Comcast and Verizon, they'll tell you they have nothing to do with local programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1193.186s">That's</a>  up to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1195.246s">So</a>  it's been the mayor, Mr. President, that's been reaching his hand in the pockets of each and every ratepayer in this community and not providing the service. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1205.449s">Where</a>  else can you do that, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1208.069s">There</a>  should be a class action suit in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1212.759s">Where</a>  else can you charge people for a service you're not getting? <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1215.7s">It</a>  makes no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1217.761s">It</a>  really doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1219.002s">And</a>  I can appreciate the fact that there were some tough times back a few years ago, but it doesn't take two, three, four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1228.135s">to</a>  put together a cable operation, public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1231.656s">It</a>  doesn't take that long. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1233.397s">We</a>  have plenty of capable people in the community that are willing to step up and run this particular channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1240.439s">We</a>  have students from Medford High School and the elementary and middle schools that want to partake in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1247.621s">We're</a>  missing precious sports events that we could be taping, like the Thanksgiving game, although this game we probably didn't want to tape. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1255.113s">this</a>  past game. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1255.854s">But,</a>  you know, we're missing a lot of things, Mr. President, that are going on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1262.458s">And</a>  it's a real shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1263.778s">It</a>  really is, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1265.66s">And</a>  I hope, you know, before the mayor leaves, I hope that he acts on — there's a number of issues on the table that the mayor is yet to act on. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1273.785s">And</a>  I'm hoping the next week or two he acts on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1276.646s">But</a>  this is one that's too important to let go. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1279.708s">This</a>  is one that, you know, everyone's paying for. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1282.59s">And</a>  if the mayor is against, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1285.184s">public</a>  access, just come out and say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1288.005s">And</a>  then say, okay, we're going to stop charging for public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1291.427s">That</a>  would be the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1293.448s">Maybe</a>  the mayor's opposed to public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1295.549s">Maybe</a>  the mayor doesn't want the laundry issued out on local access and wants to keep everything in a vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1303.112s">And</a>  he's doing a great job of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1304.773s">But</a>  the case is, he's also charging us for that service. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1308.814s">So</a>  I thank my council colleague, Councilor Penta, on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1312.396s">And</a>  I hope maybe under the next administration, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1315.153s">there's</a>  more transparency, and that that administration realizes the need for public access, and especially in a community of this size, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1324.779s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1373.52s">Uh,</a>  that is an amendment of council Caraviello that the mayor's office informed the city council regarding to the status of, uh, Medford being one of four communities nationally under Comcast to, uh, receive special broadcasting channel, open voice, open channel or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1390.265s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1391.026s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1391.846s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1392.186s">Councilor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1392.966s">Is</a>  that all? <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1393.847s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1394.267s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1394.587s">Councilor</a>  chair recognizes vice president Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1398.651s">Thank</a>  you, President De La Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1400.532s">I,</a>  too, agree with my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1402.393s">It's</a>  been two years since TV3 was abolished. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1406.655s">It's</a>  been probably five or six since the Judge Jackson report. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1411.657s">It's</a>  also been over a year since the administration put together a three-person committee that gave recommendations on how to take, I believe it was, almost $200,000 and implement a new TV3 station. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1424.224s">Over</a>  a year, we've been waiting over a year <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1427.578s">to</a>  get those recommendations looked at and implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1431.601s">And</a>  that's pretty sad, especially when you're collecting money off of the rate payers bill and it's just sitting there along with the $10 million in water retained earnings and $10 million in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1443.812s">It's</a>  just another tax that we are charging the rate payers and it's just sitting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1451.058s">Public</a>  access, we spoke out, this council spoke out hard <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1456.224s">very</a>  hard against the prior TV3 board and what was going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1461.167s">And</a>  it finally, you know, things happened that should have happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1465.549s">But</a>  now we've waited two years before any implementation, any use of that money to go towards a good cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1473.594s">We're</a>  robbing our children, our teenagers, our anybody who wants to use public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1479.797s">And</a>  we're just, we're robbing the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1482.218s">It's</a>  unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1483.139s">And</a>  I hope that the new administration really <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1485.833s">is</a>  interested in this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1487.094s">I</a>  hope that a station is implemented in a centrally located area within this community that everybody can get to and everybody can use. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1496.562s">Everybody</a>  pays for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1497.783s">Anybody</a>  that's a Verizon or cable or Comcast subscriber is paying for this, and it's something that everybody should be able to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1505.79s">Two</a>  years ago, this should have happened, not now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1509.553s">And</a>  at this point, we're going to be going at least two and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1513.84s">new</a>  administration takes this very seriously, and we implement some of the recommendations that were put forth over a year ago.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1523.982s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1526.983s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1530.383s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1532.864s">Comcast</a>  Open Voice, that was actually—it wasn't public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1536.844s">That</a>  was more a website initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1540.435s">that</a>  Comcast did, so we were one of either four or five, like Councilor Marks indicated, cities throughout the nation that did receive that grant or funding for it, but it was more towards webpage development and have the interaction through the web, not on public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1557.744s">You</a>  know, I certainly think that the new administration going forward is going to, if anyone's going to get it up and running, it's going to be the new administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1566.503s">They're</a>  going to come in here, I'm assuming, and they're going to want to get things done in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1571.164s">And</a>  public access hasn't been on the air for quite some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1575.766s">This</a>  city council is well on record on trying to shut down public access over the years with the TV3 gang by a myriad of votes that took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1587.249s">So</a>  I certainly am in support of Councilor Penta's motion to get a public access station up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1595.632s">And</a>  quite honestly, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1596.628s">It</a>  was a few months ago that I joked with Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1600.129s">I</a>  plan on having you on my cooking show. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1602.45s">And</a>  you actually said you'd come. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1604.531s">So</a>  I'm going to have a show. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1606.232s">When</a>  it's up and running, it's going to be a cooking show. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1608.192s">And</a>  I'm going to have you on, and the two of us are going to break bread together, and we're going to make a nice Italian dish.</p>

are here with the government meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1968.486s">But</a>  you'll see a diversity in thought and ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1971.987s">But</a>  you know, that's what the old mayor didn't want and he got away with it because he had friends at the statehouse and because he had friends everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1980.148s">This</a>  new mayor has a new start. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1982.289s">She</a>  can start fresh. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1984.029s">She</a>  can start with the, you know, and if there are problems like in the past, which she is very aware of, such as <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1991.771s">money</a>  disappearing, attacks on personalities and characteristics, then we need to have a format by which to get rid of those people on the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2003.699s">And</a>  it isn't rocket science because they're all doing it all around us and we're losing out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2009.463s">And</a>  this affects the business community, Mr. Caraviello, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2013.579s">This</a>  affects the, well, I think of business, I think of him. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2017.0s">That's</a>  why I voted for him. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2018.26s">Anyway,</a>  and you better do something for the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2021.021s">So</a>  anyway, I'm going to hold you to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2022.881s">But</a>  anyway, you know, it helps the business community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2027.082s">It</a>  helps the arts community, the theater, the theater, the Chevalier Theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2032.123s">It</a>  helps everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2033.783s">And</a>  it is a waste of time and money to put it in this Vogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2037.504s">Not</a>  that I'm against having them be taught those skill sets at the Vogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2041.765s">But</a>  it puts more money in the Vogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2044.233s">Unfortunately,</a>  and I have to go through this laundry list, all new schools 10 years ago, a new pool, two new stadiums, all money going towards the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2054.635s">I'm</a>  not against the students, but the students and the schools have gotten the lion's share of all the monies, and now they have another part to play with, which is this technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2064.437s">They</a>  got the tech bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2065.637s">That</a>  was another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2066.718s">They've</a>  gotten a chunk of change. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2067.818s">The</a>  only thing on the city side has been a $14 million DPW yard that isn't even sufficient <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2074.4s">And</a>  it's brand new, because it has problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2076.741s">So</a>  it needed more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2078.262s">So</a>  the balance is shifted towards the schools already. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2083.364s">We</a>  can put it in Haines Square, because there's plenty of empty lots and empty storefronts there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2088.967s">I</a>  wish it was in the Medford Square, because that is the most vibrant place that it can lift the square right up. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2096.85s">Between</a>  the library being redone, the Chevalier, and the TV3 being in a storefront, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2102.938s">It</a>  can really pick up the square and make it more user-friendly, make the square better, bring people in. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2109.141s">They'll</a>  have something to do besides go to eat. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2111.542s">They'll</a>  have something to eat because they're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2114.243s">So</a>  it'll all work out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2115.704s">But</a>  if you don't, if you let this stay at the high school, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2119.878s">which</a>  is better than nothing, but it's still going to hamper free speech up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2125.679s">It</a>  really will. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2126.659s">Because</a>  it's going to be, people are going to feel that they're in a public building, and they're going to feel like they can't say certain things because they're in a public building. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2134.661s">Plus,</a>  it's not accessible the way that it would be in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2138.222s">But</a>  right now, you can put it in Haines Square, because I know that there are empty storefronts right on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2143.803s">and</a>  you can just tuck it right in there for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2146.025s">But</a>  anyway, thank you for listening, and I hope that we have free speech, and the arts, and business, and all of that that can come from this. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2153.311s">Those</a>  three things, the library, the Chevalier, and TV3, or community access, would all, you know, just build up the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2160.898s">Those</a>  three things anchor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2162.38s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[acqgxK4yhEM_SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2179.675s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2180.095s">That's</a>  the first accessible part of this City Hall I've seen ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2185.798s">Yeah,</a>  thank you, Councilor Caruso. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2189.399s">Y'all</a>  notice that the doors are never, the accessible door button doesn't actually work during city council meetings getting in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2197.122s">That's</a>  the same concern I have for the public access station that everybody has been so excited about. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2205.364s">And</a>  I recognize that we had an election <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2209.15s">And</a>  if there needs to be a moment of silence because Councilor Penta did not win the mayoral candidacy, then maybe we should have a moment of silence. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2220.151s">But</a>  I think that if we're going to talk about very important issues, like a public access station, we need to not only talk about free speech, what has happened in the past with the previous mayor, but also accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2241.127s">and</a>  going forward giving the new administration the opportunity to succeed and or fail. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2250.074s">And</a>  that's something that concerns me about these meetings, is that before the new administration has been given a chance, they've already been called failures. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2262.404s">Not</a>  to mention the people at this meeting who are discussing public access, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2268.008s">are</a>  not talking about the way that this generation, and I'm in my 30s, so I'm still considered young by some people, old by my former students, because I was a teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2282.057s">They're</a>  not using Channel 3 or the materials available at a public access building to make a cooking show. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2291.082s">They're</a>  using YouTube, Snapchat, Vine, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2296.484s">If</a>  the city of Medford truly wants to embrace public access for all citizens, we're going to have to talk about more than the Comcast Verizon scandal. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2308.129s">And</a>  we're going to have to talk about more than Channel 3 on a television. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2312.331s">And</a>  frankly, I have yet to hear anybody, including former candidates, talk about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2320.167s">Let's</a>  bring that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2321.668s">Let's</a>  have an informed, sensible, respectful conversation when the new administration takes place.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2338.322s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2342.165s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2342.685s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2343.286s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Sqp6S0Yyr0A_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2357.74s">Hi,</a>  I'm Rachel Tannenhaus, 26 Pearl Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2363.664s">I</a>  would like to, I'd like to advocate for a comprehensive approach that absolutely includes students and you're never going to hear me complaining about how much money you put into the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2379.05s">system,</a>  by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2379.87s">I</a>  think that that is always a wise and sound investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2384.331s">But</a>  I would love to make sure that even if it's not at the VOC, which is fine, I want to make sure that we have various forms of public access, that I am in favor of a public access TV station. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2400.994s">I</a>  also think that the city should look <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2404.777s">really</a>  closely at utilizing social media, what its social media policies are, and maybe provide a comprehensive communications education to its students, including a public access television station, but also discussion of other forms of media, including social media, and the use of them for, say, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2431.95s">train</a>  kids who probably know a lot more about social media access than we do, but also talk to them about how to use it for things like business, politics, news, that sort of thing, how to create content, how to produce content. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2449.357s">I</a>  did not grow up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2451.178s">I</a>  grew up in Maryland, and I was blessed with an excellent education. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2454.439s">And</a>  one of the pillars of my education was a program I was in <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2461.293s">from</a>  7th through 12th grade in Montgomery County, Maryland, called the Communication Arts Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2465.596s">It's</a>  still there, by the way, 25 years later, more than 25 years later. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2469.898s">And</a>  one of the things that we had in high school was a cable access channel run out of our high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2478.103s">Again,</a>  I'm not suggesting that it be at the high school because, or at the VOC, but I am suggesting that there be a concerted effort to involve the schools in making sure that students <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2490.605s">And</a>  in fact, people of all ages, including seniors, have access to such a station. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2497.212s">It</a>  was so important to me that I learned not only to produce news, to report news, I learned to work every single position in a television studio. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2509.824s">And</a>  yes, they put me behind a camera. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2511.386s">I'm</a>  not sure about the wisdom of that either. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2514.059s">At</a>  one point, the director asked me if I was focused, and I was like, you tell me. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2525.504s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2527.005s">But</a>  in fact, it taught me that I had a voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2532.65s">It</a>  taught me to look at news critically. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2536.153s">It</a>  taught me to be able to communicate better. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2541.057s">And</a>  it taught me to listen to the voices of others whose story might not be told by the mainstream and to try to find those voices and make sure that they have <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2555.228s">some</a>  way to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2557.329s">So</a>  I feel like these are lessons, especially these days when there's such a torrent of information, such a flood of information from all sides, I think that those are still really vital lessons for students to learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2571.472s">And</a>  I know that it served me for the rest of my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2574.372s">from</a>  our program graduated a number of people who became professional journalists, including one who wound up on CNN. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2580.316s">So</a>  I feel like, A, I am 100% in support of there being public access, but I think that there needs to be a comprehensive plan to, you know, get the school system involved in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2591.923s">Especially,</a>  and, you know, I actually, one reason not to have it in the schools is because, you know, God bless the schools, but they are, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2599.088s">But</a>  public schools are not exactly bastions of free speech because they have kids in them. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2603.313s">And</a>  I think it's really good to have, you know, there are things you cannot say in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2608.579s">And</a>  I think that it's good for kids to have a place where they can talk, where they can actually have their voices heard, where they can create media. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2618.012s">So</a>  I think that it is something that, you know, talk to the senior centers, how, you know, a lot of folks in the senior community are not being heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2626.801s">A</a>  lot of people maybe could have, you know, could have a way to be heard and not forgotten because a lot of the time that's how we treat our older members of our society. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2638.447s">So</a>  I feel like this could be part of a comprehensive plan, and I feel like it could really benefit large portions of Medford that A, are probably paying this money that's disappearing into the ether, and B, that maybe don't have a voice now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2655.818s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Joyce Paul]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2665.004s">Joyce</a>  Paul, 8 Mason Street, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2668.348s">One</a>  of the things I wanted to say about, um, access is that the history goes back to the Supreme Judicial Court in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2681.439s">And</a>  the problems, because there was no audit for five years in Medford, um, the situation was put with the Supreme Judicial Court in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2695.754s">which</a>  clearly states there is very poor management and oversight. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2700.418s">I</a>  don't think there is any other city in Massachusetts that can say they have so many problems with cable access that it ends up in the Supreme Judicial Court in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2712.667s">And</a>  it's been there for a couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2714.529s">I</a>  have no idea what's going to happen with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2716.771s">But</a>  not having an audit for five years, it went to the police, it went to Martha Coakley, and she put it in the Supreme Judicial Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2725.431s">There's</a>  really management problems in Medford, and I think that's really a shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2731.954s">That's</a>  all.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2733.916s">Thank</a>  you, ma'am. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2735.376s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2735.897s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2737.938s">Yes,</a>  Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2742.92s">I</a>  want to thank for five of the seven Councilors for speaking up on this matter of public access, a lack of. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2750.693s">The</a>  point of, I believe, information might be, I believe the rate that they deduct from Comcast bills is more like $3.50, I believe, per month, times my guesstimate of 20,000 subscribers, that would be probably over $60,000 per month. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2771.373s">And</a>  that would be, I believe, accumulate to <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2776.089s">over</a>  $700,000 on an annual basis in the past year or two per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2785.232s">It</a>  is about time that this is reopened. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2790.293s">And</a>  I believe it should definitely be in Method Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2793.114s">And</a>  other communities, as I was pointing out, they have a viable public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2799.376s">And</a>  it really should be in downtown or the Chevalier <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2805.408s">a</a>  worse scenario, the TPWR, which is brand new, and there's a lot of rooms I saw that were in an open house when I got a Coke and a smile when they had the grand opening. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2821.16s">But</a>  Medford Square would be the best location, and it seems like there's plenty of cash on hand, in place, and maybe more besides that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2832.63s">If</a>  I was in charge, I would set a deadline for three months just to get it organized, and therefore add an additional three months more, which is a total of six months, to be reborn and up and running, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2850.778s">Just</a>  my thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2852.099s">Thank</a>  you, if you're listening.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2854.62s">Thank</a>  you very much, Andrew. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2856.701s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2858.622s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2859.688s">You</a>  know, I think the best comment of the night came from the young lady over here, who said, I think we need to look—to relook at the way we look at access television with the new generation and all the new technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2871.59s">I</a>  hope that the new mayor would set up some kind of committee to look at these new forms of access. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2879.652s">Maybe</a>  a TV station isn't the way to go, or maybe, as I say, with all these other avenues we have, I think some new forward thinking with <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2888.828s">with</a>  some younger people who are a little more tech savvy than some of us are, can give us some maybe better direction than what we've had in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2897.333s">So,</a>  again, I thank her for bringing that forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2900.295s">And</a>  let's see, hopefully, moving forward, we'll see where that goes.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2907.44s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2908.14s">The</a>  Chair recognizes Councilor Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2909.681s">Mr.</a>  President, one of the key components of public access television is taking place here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2915.665s">We're</a>  allowing people—not allowing, this is the People's Forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2918.765s">They're</a>  having the opportunity to come up and speak for whatever their positions might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2923.306s">But</a>  in June of 2014, a federal judge by the name of James O. Browning made a very distinct comment as it relates to people who have the opportunity to come up and speak and to give their opinions. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2936.15s">And</a>  what that federal judge did to this particular city was to punish, and I won't say use the word punish, was to admonish them for not allowing criticism to be made at a podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2948.637s">Because</a>  as he said, criticism at a podium is an unconstitutional burden on free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2954.339s">So</a>  if somebody wants to come here, or a council wants to compliment, commend, or whatever it might be, or somebody wants to go to that podium and speak in such a manner, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2962.342s">But</a>  criticism of any commentary is just as much important or is just as much a part of free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2969.384s">And</a>  just as Browning indicated, and he said, limits can be placed on time and topic, but not on a speaker's opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2976.787s">And</a>  whatever the speaker feels he'd like to say, within reason, as long as it's not abusive, and it's his opinion, it needs to be allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2985.652s">He</a>  wrote an 89-page decision, and I'm waiting for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2988.233s">I</a>  asked for the 89-page decision on that, because that's a huge issue right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2992.636s">Freedom</a>  of speech, and allowing freedom of speech, and inclusive of freedom of speech, if there's a criticism included in there, and they're saying it, and it's done in fair commentary, it should not be excluded. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3006.808s">and</a>  it should not be cut off. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3007.889s">As</a>  a matter of fact, this whole decision by the judge banned a particular city council from imposing critiques on anyone who was speaking there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3017.876s">So</a>  I believe it's monumental. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3019.497s">It</a>  goes back to June of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3022.619s">It's</a>  a federal justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3023.599s">It's</a>  not even a local justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3025.04s">It's</a>  a federal district court justice making his opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3028.343s">And</a>  that's the second time within the year 2014 that two federal judges came out <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3035.161s">and</a>  made this commentary as it relates to free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3037.863s">And</a>  those who might want to critique or be critical of somebody speaking or whatever the commentary might be, as he said, quote, it's an unconstitutional burden on free speech by disallowing someone to voice their opinion, be it in a critique manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3051.735s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3057.689s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3059.07s">I</a>  just, I'd be remissed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3060.57s">We're</a>  talking about public access and the holiday season. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3063.531s">You</a>  know, um, I just want to thank the individual out there that sent a real nice, um, obscene Christmas card to the Camuso family. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3072.855s">It's</a>  someone that, uh, I believe based upon the investigation that's ongoing in handwriting that's been submitted to the Medford city council on petitions over the years that law enforcement, um, utilizing the federal mail service. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3085.599s">Um,</a>  I think there's, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3089.27s">I'm</a>  sure everyone will hear about it in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3091.511s">So</a>  to that person that sent a card with threats in it, as well as swears, and when my six-year-old opened it up that's just learning how to read, I would just like to thank that individual, because when you screw around with the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3107.321s">mail,</a>  it's not something that people take lightly. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3111.844s">So</a>  to that person, I just want to wish them a very happy holiday season, and I'm sure we'll be seeing them very soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3117.845s">in</a>  the proper place, so Merry Christmas.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3121.366s">Merry</a>  Christmas, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3123.187s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3125.327s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much, and going back to what Councilor Penta was discussing about the federal court ruling, I believe that the federal court ruling was in response, and I'm asking him for some clarification on this, Mr. President, through you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3137.131s">I</a>  believe that the issue that was before the court was a city council rule precluding people from giving negative comments being deemed unconstitutional, if I'm not mistaken, based on my <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3147.433s">research</a>  of the issue and understanding of the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3149.174s">I</a>  think it wasn't so much that people were being shut down at the microphone and not being allowed to speak, but it was that the council had a rule that said that no negative comments were allowed to be brought up at a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3158.841s">I</a>  think that's what the actual case was that was brought up, but I defer to the gentleman, but if it's my understanding, maybe I'm talking about a different case in 2014.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3166.606s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3169.588s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3171.209s">The</a>  case was very succinct and it was not allowing people to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3175.311s">The</a>  council <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3176.534s">in</a>  its wisdom, decided council president, for whatever the reasons might be, did not allow people to make negative comments, to say anything negative at council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3185.442s">And</a>  that, in and of itself, was an unconstitutional burden on free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3189.945s">Whether</a>  it was a council rule or the actions that were taking place, it found itself all the way to the Supreme Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3196.191s">Strike</a>  that, the Federal District Court, by Justice Browning. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3199.932s">So</a>  I guess a word to the wise is sufficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3202.353s">Whether</a>  it's a ruling or not a ruling, or just not allowing anyone, for whatever the reasons might be, not to make a commentary contrary to what was being said, it's not allowable. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3212.235s">It's</a>  an exercise against free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3215.836s">And</a>  the ruling is very succinct.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3219.857s">There's</a>  a difference between. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3223.644s">having</a>  a contrary opinion, and speaking in a derisive, derogatory, harmful manner to another individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3233.128s">Chair</a>  recognizes the citizen at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3237.33s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3238.211s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3379.231s">DPW,</a>  Mr. President, I did speak to DPW and they will be down there tomorrow to inspect the damage and report back to me.</p>

    <p>[mex41hYCPiQ_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3397.216s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3398.116s">My</a>  concern is, do I need to take photographs? <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3400.356s">Um,</a>  I mean, I don't know how to present my case and how to prove, I mean, how, how am I going to prove who did it?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3407.137s">May</a>  I suggest that Councilor Caraviello would advise you on this matter?</p>

    <p>[mex41hYCPiQ_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3410.079s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3415.344s">Mr.</a>  President, I am aware that when contracted work is done in the community that they usually make a video beforehand of what it looked like and then the before and after photos are available. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3426.152s">If</a>  it was done by a private contractor and not done by the Medford DPW, it seems like in this instance it may have been done by the DPW, but in other instances, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3433.546s">Normally</a>  we'll have a video on file and that could be accessed through the engineering office.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3471.006s">Mr.</a>  President, paper 15789. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3471.926s">Back,</a>  well, maybe four months ago, this council had met with the chief of police relative to a number of concerns relative to resident parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3482.109s">And</a>  one of the discussions that the traffic commission was having was implementing a citywide permitting process for resident parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3489.472s">And</a>  I'd like an update on that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3491.494s">As</a>  the winter fast approaches, the parking wars begin. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3494.237s">And</a>  you wouldn't know that today's December 15th or so based upon the weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3498.762s">But</a>  after our first snowfall, I think we're all going to find out about it relatively quickly, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3503.407s">So</a>  I'm hoping that the Traffic Commission will be willing to provide us with an update as to where they are in terms of their deliberation on resident citywide permit parking.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3511.478s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight for approval, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3515.18s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3516.441s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3517.962s">While</a>  we're under suspension, we'll take two papers in the hand of the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3522.885s">Number</a>  one offered by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3525.347s">Be</a>  it resolved that the speed bumps on Harvard Street and Central Avenue be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3529.569s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3532.331s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3533.532s">If</a>  my memory serves me correct, it was about probably <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3537.979s">A</a>  year and a half, two years ago, the mayor created a raised crosswalk pilot program in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3544.443s">Three</a>  years ago, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3546.284s">And</a>  at that time, they came out with three locations, Winthrop Street, Central Ave, and Harvard Street for raised crosswalks for the first phase of implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3556.971s">Winthrop</a>  Street, as we all know, has been done and quite successful from what I hear from area residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3563.708s">However,</a>  over the last, I think it was six, seven months ago, Central Ave, a speed bump popped up in the middle of Central Ave, and now just recently Harvard Street now has the same speed bump, which is very different than a raised crosswalk, and many surrounding communities that have used speed bumps are now removing it, like the city of Malden had several speed bumps, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3589.793s">and</a>  have removed them for various public safety issues and concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3594.754s">I</a>  asked, I believe it was two weeks ago, that we get a response back from the city administration regarding why speed bumps are popping up on our streets rather than the raised crosswalk, and we did not get a response, Mr. President, to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3610.558s">So</a>  again, I am asking that <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3613.223s">We</a>  reach out to the administration to find out why they are installing speed bumps rather than the anticipated and proposed raised crosswalks, which are far better in traffic calming than a speed bump. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3632.031s">So</a>  I would again ask that question, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3635.913s">I</a>  know there's been some e-mails going back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3639.694s">I</a>  know the bike, method bike <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3642.245s">is</a>  concerned about these speed bumps also. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3645.208s">And</a>  there have been a number of issues raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3647.93s">And</a>  residents that were waiting for these raised crosswalks now are questioning why speed bumps are showing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3656.018s">And</a>  we have yet to get any response from the administration.</p>

href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3862.724s">Churchill</a>  said, those who fail to learn from the past are doomed to repeat it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3868.467s">If</a>  we do not take our city-side building maintenance seriously, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3874.315s">They</a>  will undoubtedly fall into disrepair, as did the schools, the DPW, and currently the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3881.237s">Assuming</a>  that we put off tearing down and building out a 21st century public safety building, which I do not endorse forfeiting, we still need to insert a building maintenance budget for each city side building. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3895.22s">The</a>  school side has a person in charge of school buildings and can identify the problems and priorities for the school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3902.622s">We</a>  need the same on the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3904.885s">If</a>  we have the money to hire a public relations officer for the school side at the cost to the taxpayer of $85,000 a year, then we can afford a chief of maintenance for city-side buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3918.129s">We</a>  need a log of problems and schedule for their maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3921.409s">We</a>  need a list of all city-owned buildings and inspections annually to identify their problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3928.791s">Whoever</a>  said you can't fight City Hall is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3933.599s">Local</a>  politicians do react to the populace when the populace makes its voice heard loud enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3941.182s">When</a>  the parents come out in force, stadiums, the high school pool, and the technology labs are funded and built. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3948.246s">The</a>  problem is the voice for city buildings are not loud enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3953.268s">And</a>  for those who believe I am against the schools, note that I have spoken out against excessive spending on the city side, i.e., the garage, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3962.878s">the</a>  Water Taxi, the Brooks Estates, and a whole new building for the arts community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3968.22s">We</a>  will do well to save the two, quote, luxury buildings we have, which is the library and the Chevalier Auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3977.382s">As</a>  for all other building structures, they are mandatory and need to be tended to. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3983.784s">We</a>  could also look at street safety, i.e. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3986.925s">crosswalk</a>  reflectors and underground infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3990.466s">And</a>  I say that because I was in Haines Square <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3992.682s">And</a>  everybody's coming in at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3995.144s">And</a>  at night, at 5, 530, all you see is a flood of headlights. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4000.007s">And</a>  you can't see the crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4001.368s">And</a>  you can't see a person crossing the crosswalk until they actually go in front of somebody's headlights. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4007.072s">So</a>  it's very, very dangerous there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4009.754s">So</a>  we need to public safety of the sidewalks and all the rest of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4014.878s">I'm</a>  ad nauseam. <a

mind the building inspector is for the whole city, not just city buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4034.819s">So</a>  if you have the argument that we have a building inspector, well he's in the, or she or whatever, they, the two of them, are in charge of every single building. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4043.464s">That</a>  means house, two families, single, buildings, condos, you name it, retail, commercial, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4050.665s">The</a>  Brooks estates to the Craddock house or the Tufts house to the royal house to the school
