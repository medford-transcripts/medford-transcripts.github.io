1
00:00:03,733 --> 00:00:04,694
Councilor Caviello?

2
00:00:04,914 --> 00:00:05,094
Present.

3
00:00:05,555 --> 00:00:06,135
Councilor Knight?

4
00:00:07,476 --> 00:00:07,736
Present.

5
00:00:07,756 --> 00:00:08,717
Vice President Longo Kern?

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:12,660
Present.

7
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:13,621
Councilor Mox?

8
00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:13,781
Present.

9
00:00:14,742 --> 00:00:15,383
Councilor Penta?

10
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:16,624
Present.

11
00:00:16,644 --> 00:00:17,344
President Del Russo?

12
00:00:17,404 --> 00:00:17,785
Present.

13
00:00:17,805 --> 00:00:21,107
With the seventh present, none absent, please rise to receive the flag.

14
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:32,417
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

15
00:00:38,678 --> 00:00:39,880
Council accommodations, 15-793.

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:49,792
Council accommodations to Henry and Evelyn Miller on their continued supporting work within the disability community.

17
00:00:50,193 --> 00:00:54,038
This was offered by Council Penta, so at this time I invite Council Penta to come up.

18
00:01:22,992 --> 00:01:27,677
This recognition tonight is for a gentleman and his wife, Henry and Evelyn.

19
00:01:29,518 --> 00:01:40,008
They're like out in the community, there are a lot of silent people that do things on behalf of other folks, not looking for any recognition, not looking for any prestige, just letting folks

20
00:01:41,053 --> 00:01:43,354
know that there are other people out there to help them.

21
00:01:43,434 --> 00:01:46,935
And since I've gotten to know Henry and Elephant, they're very quiet people.

22
00:01:47,835 --> 00:01:49,195
They're not looking for much praise.

23
00:01:49,215 --> 00:01:52,516
They're not looking for anything that basically says, hey, look at me, look what I did.

24
00:01:53,216 --> 00:01:58,518
But they fortunately got recognized this past November by ARC, a nationally recognized organization.

25
00:01:59,782 --> 00:02:04,085
group of individuals, an association for whatever the reason my name might be.

26
00:02:04,645 --> 00:02:09,409
And they go out there and they help out folks who are intellectually and physically disabled.

27
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:12,971
And it's not just in the city of Medford, it's in other and surrounding communities.

28
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:20,436
So it gives me great pleasure, it gives me great pleasure to make this proclamation be read publicly.

29
00:02:20,476 --> 00:02:25,179
And it goes as a presentation from the Medford City Council to Henry and Evelyn Milleran.

30
00:02:27,302 --> 00:02:32,125
in recognition for your continued support within the disability community in Medford and its surrounding communities.

31
00:02:32,825 --> 00:02:42,430
Your efforts were most recently recognized at the November meeting of ARC, a nationally recognized organization that deals with the intellectual and physical disabilities of those less fortunate.

32
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:52,356
The Medford City Council extends its deepest appreciation and gratitude for your efforts in improving the quality of life for the citizenry of Medford and all those that you have helped out.

33
00:02:53,016 --> 00:02:54,417
I'd like to have the both of you come up.

34
00:02:54,577 --> 00:02:55,438
Andrea and Evelyn, please.

35
00:03:11,147 --> 00:03:14,991
And the interesting component about these two, they're husband and wife.

36
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:22,619
And so not only do they do their husband and wife team, they are a husband and wife team for these intellectual and physical disabilities.

37
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:24,521
And that's a great compliment to the both of you.

38
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:25,401
Thank you very much.

39
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:30,647
When my wife is here, I'll talk.

40
00:03:36,097 --> 00:03:48,427
It is amazing as a parent, you know you are a parent, this is your job to take care of your child, but at the same time, you reach out to other parents because of your experience.

41
00:03:49,388 --> 00:03:54,272
Raising a child with disabilities, raising a child is difficult.

42
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:59,397
In addition, having a disability, it multiplies by 100.

43
00:03:59,457 --> 00:04:03,200
Our son used to sleep only two hours.

44
00:04:04,647 --> 00:04:09,450
And out of the 24 hours, our lives was consumed.

45
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,833
22 out of the 24 hours.

46
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:15,254
Thank you.

47
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:19,877
We were doing it just, we love our child.

48
00:04:21,338 --> 00:04:23,280
We didn't think people would take notice.

49
00:04:24,601 --> 00:04:30,905
And we're very grateful for what we're doing and will continue to do.

50
00:04:32,435 --> 00:04:35,629
And again, thank you for the recognition.

51
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:45,610
You always let the first go.

52
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,830
I'm a lucky man.

53
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:53,232
I'm a lucky man because I'm living on the city of my birthplace in America.

54
00:04:53,932 --> 00:04:56,233
You know, with my accent, I was not born here.

55
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:57,133
I came here.

56
00:04:58,033 --> 00:04:59,354
I was going to medical school.

57
00:04:59,774 --> 00:05:00,954
I ran into issue.

58
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,895
But I had a lot of people look around here.

59
00:05:03,935 --> 00:05:04,895
I had a lot of friends.

60
00:05:04,915 --> 00:05:06,556
I had a lot of support.

61
00:05:07,256 --> 00:05:09,857
And the most lucky, I had a wonderful wife.

62
00:05:10,965 --> 00:05:16,486
My wife stood by me and helped me just like I helped her to do what we do.

63
00:05:16,986 --> 00:05:20,347
After our son, we say we got to do for the elders.

64
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,228
We don't have one son anymore.

65
00:05:22,268 --> 00:05:23,348
We have a lot of sons.

66
00:05:23,388 --> 00:05:29,510
We have daughters all across, not city of Medford, but across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

67
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,410
It is touch that

68
00:05:32,137 --> 00:05:43,833
You know, I'm standing here, okay, receiving something that we achieved, not because we're doing it for fame, but we're doing it because this is our responsibility.

69
00:05:44,254 --> 00:05:47,398
As citizens, this is our responsibility as parents.

70
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,200
Thank you.

71
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:09,628
Cheese.

72
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:10,529
Fromage.

73
00:06:12,251 --> 00:06:13,992
You can sit here.

74
00:06:14,693 --> 00:06:15,053
Cheese.

75
00:06:15,073 --> 00:06:15,854
Thank you.

76
00:06:15,914 --> 00:06:16,455
Merry Christmas.

77
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:17,155
You too.

78
00:07:04,204 --> 00:07:04,624
Councillor.

79
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:11,207
Mrs. Miller and happy birthday to you.

80
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:33,055
Motions orders and resolutions 15-800 offered by Councillor Penta be it resolved that the state of concern regarding the Medford Police Department

81
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:34,410
be discussed.

82
00:07:34,471 --> 00:07:34,851
Counselor?

83
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:46,737
Mr. President, and for those who might be watching and are interested in our public safety and our Meffitt Police Department, most recently there was an incident, a public health incident that took place in the Meffitt Police Department building.

84
00:07:47,658 --> 00:08:00,305
And unfortunately it was a backup and it was a sewage backup into the building, which has caused a huge contamination of probably the basement area where the cells are downstairs and a whole host of other things.

85
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:06,669
This city council has been advocating for the past two years that their first priority would be for a new police station.

86
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:12,733
I in my campaign for mayor advocated that a police station would be my top priority on there as well.

87
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:25,922
What I don't understand and what I don't see is the unfortunate need that what our method police officers go through male and female on a daily basis is not being recognized and has not been recognized for the past 28 years.

88
00:08:26,382 --> 00:08:28,484
The unfortunate part is simply this.

89
00:08:29,277 --> 00:08:33,180
We need a new method police station, and we need to have our public safety be brought up to par.

90
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:38,043
We're down by at least a minimum of 10 police officers, and that's rank and file.

91
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,064
That's not management or captains or lieutenants.

92
00:08:40,124 --> 00:08:41,605
That's just rank and file patrolmen.

93
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:54,014
You know, there's a new administration coming on board, and I would hope that they're not looked at, the police department with John Desai, because maybe they didn't take the positive position in coming out and endorsing that particular person.

94
00:08:54,614 --> 00:08:57,656
But the unfortunate part is, that should not be used against them.

95
00:08:58,103 --> 00:09:00,846
Our public safety right now is at an all-time low.

96
00:09:01,546 --> 00:09:03,848
Our police cruises are at an all-time low.

97
00:09:04,369 --> 00:09:11,015
The building itself, the evidence room, and everything else that surrounds the Medford Police Department on a daily basis is at an all-time low.

98
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:12,917
It needs to be addressed now.

99
00:09:12,977 --> 00:09:13,778
It cannot wait.

100
00:09:14,358 --> 00:09:18,162
Public safety in our community cannot be put on hold, and it should not be put on hold.

101
00:09:18,842 --> 00:09:22,726
And I would hope that anyone who might be watching, and anyone who has an interest in public safety,

102
00:09:23,223 --> 00:09:30,088
And anyone who really believes that our Medford Police Department deserves better, because that's what our taxes are paying for, now is the time to come forward.

103
00:09:30,508 --> 00:09:32,069
You have a new administration coming on.

104
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:33,530
You have two new counselors coming on.

105
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,131
The commitment has to be made.

106
00:09:35,631 --> 00:09:38,033
The finances has to be looked out for and sought out.

107
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:39,194
And they can be.

108
00:09:39,274 --> 00:09:40,635
Malden is a perfect example.

109
00:09:40,975 --> 00:09:42,856
They're building a brand new police station.

110
00:09:43,256 --> 00:09:46,959
They already have $9 million of the $18 million they've already secured in grants.

111
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:49,901
Medford cannot be put on hold any longer.

112
00:09:50,362 --> 00:09:52,104
in regards to its police department.

113
00:09:52,324 --> 00:10:11,381
And with that being said, Mr. President, I would hope that this city council and the incoming city council holds new administration's feet to the fire to build that brand-new police station in behalf of not only the citizens of this community, but because of the public safety that is necessary and it's demanding right now on a daily basis.

114
00:10:11,842 --> 00:10:15,565
All you have to do is talk to the police officers, talk to the chief of police,

115
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:20,564
and ask them what they think should be done as compared to what is being done.

116
00:10:21,064 --> 00:10:21,564
I thank you.

117
00:10:22,284 --> 00:10:23,004
Thank you, Councillor.

118
00:10:23,544 --> 00:10:28,725
On the motion of Council paper that the paper be received and placed on file.

119
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:29,786
All those in favour?

120
00:10:31,986 --> 00:10:32,666
All those opposed?

121
00:10:33,906 --> 00:10:34,387
Motion passes.

122
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:38,207
Offered by Councillor Penta, 15-801.

123
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:41,768
Be it resolved that the monthly taking

124
00:10:42,323 --> 00:10:52,126
since December of 2013 by the city administration of Comcast and Verizon ratepayers for public access TV be discussed.

125
00:10:52,307 --> 00:10:52,987
Councillor Pinto.

126
00:10:53,127 --> 00:11:00,029
Mr. President, since 2013 until now, December of 2015, it's been approximately 2 years.

127
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:10,853
And during that period of time, the city of Medford has intentionally, the city administration has intentionally taken ratepayers' money from Comcast and subsequently, since Verizon has come on board,

128
00:11:11,443 --> 00:11:14,004
for what they call public access TV here in the city of Medford.

129
00:11:14,604 --> 00:11:24,027
As of today, there is approximately $400,000, $450,000 sitting in the city coffers downstairs for public access television.

130
00:11:24,607 --> 00:11:31,369
Public access television for which the mayor and its current administration has intentionally not allowed here in the city of Medford.

131
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,250
And who's at the loss of that?

132
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,031
And that's the cable TV subscribers.

133
00:11:35,631 --> 00:11:39,592
Whether you agree or disagree with anyone running for office, no candidate

134
00:11:39,922 --> 00:11:47,026
for this past election had the opportunity to be on public access, to have their position stated, accepted, rejected, or even looked at.

135
00:11:47,926 --> 00:11:58,232
No citizen of this community has had the opportunity to have their shows relative to sports, family events, or anything that might be educational, historical, to be put on public access television.

136
00:11:58,832 --> 00:12:07,677
During the past two years, what the mayor did is he implemented a three-member committee person, three-member person committee, for the purposes of reviewing public access here in the city of Medford.

137
00:12:08,317 --> 00:12:09,798
Coming up with a concocted story,

138
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:16,428
that at some point in time, on or before Memorial Day of 2015, we would have something ongoing.

139
00:12:16,768 --> 00:12:17,289
And we don't.

140
00:12:17,349 --> 00:12:20,970
This is now December 2015, almost seven months later.

141
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:28,034
And the money just keeps coming out of your cable bill each and every month from Verizon and Comcast.

142
00:12:28,674 --> 00:12:34,077
We had a public access meeting here for contract renewal with Comcast here in the city of Medford.

143
00:12:34,577 --> 00:12:36,298
It was another 10-year deal.

144
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:39,680
And no one, not one person from the city administration,

145
00:12:40,087 --> 00:12:44,931
Not one person showed up to defend and argue on behalf of Comcast customers.

146
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:48,074
I, along with nine other citizens, were here to do that.

147
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,836
And this isn't because we're for or against.

148
00:12:51,297 --> 00:12:52,518
It's a 10-year contract.

149
00:12:52,578 --> 00:13:00,224
And in today's day and age, 10-year contracts are basically unheard of, especially when technology is so far advanced and it's ever-changing.

150
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:06,550
From California all the way to Massachusetts, there's a combination of maybe even a collage

151
00:13:07,092 --> 00:13:14,678
between Verizon and Comcast technicians working together, sharing their jobs together as they traverse across the country.

152
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:33,211
And yes, there is a movement out there that maybe public access is not the way to go because between Amazon and all these other technological programs that are out there between a combination of streaming or buying on Netflix or whatever it might be, the idea is out there that the city of Medford is not having it.

153
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:36,293
With a proposal now that seems to be languishing,

154
00:13:36,642 --> 00:13:43,905
of possibly putting it up in the vocational school, a place that would serve no purpose, especially in the winter months that we have right now.

155
00:13:44,445 --> 00:13:45,245
It's dark out.

156
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,687
The bus route would stop the person getting off at the bottom of the hill.

157
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,487
You would have to walk up to the top of the hill.

158
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:53,208
God knows where you would have to go into the building to get in.

159
00:13:53,728 --> 00:14:02,011
It does not serve a purpose because all this type of information on public access needs to be located in a centrally located place.

160
00:14:02,552 --> 00:14:06,013
And when you have something that's centrally located, it would bring more people.

161
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:09,467
City of Reading, Town of Reading, perfect example.

162
00:14:09,507 --> 00:14:14,011
Not only do they have it in the downtown area, they have it on every Saturday morning at 11 o'clock.

163
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:15,712
It's open to the public, coffee and donuts.

164
00:14:15,992 --> 00:14:16,713
People can come in.

165
00:14:17,053 --> 00:14:18,694
They show you how to make your own program.

166
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:20,736
They lease out, rent out their equipment.

167
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:22,377
They show you how to use the equipment.

168
00:14:22,397 --> 00:14:23,958
They show you how to make your own programs.

169
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:27,121
I know we've had this discussion before over and over and over again.

170
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,043
But the fact of the matter is when we started this discussion,

171
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:34,842
There was nowhere near $450,000 sitting in the coffers downstairs.

172
00:14:35,463 --> 00:14:49,973
And when in fact some of that money was used to pay for salaries of three individuals up at the high school in a program out there that has nothing to do and has nothing to do by law with cable access and public TV access here in the city of Medford, and nothing's been challenged in that particular area.

173
00:14:50,553 --> 00:14:57,258
What needs to be done in this city is that you need a revolution in thought where people can turn around and say, hey, wait a minute.

174
00:14:58,193 --> 00:15:02,757
These are your dollars that are being taken out of your cable bill each and every month.

175
00:15:03,077 --> 00:15:04,718
It's almost like coming out of your check.

176
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:06,880
You're paying for something that you're not getting.

177
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:12,024
$450,000 is nothing to sneeze at, and you still have nothing for it.

178
00:15:12,604 --> 00:15:15,847
It's unfortunate that we have to talk about this thing over and over again.

179
00:15:16,107 --> 00:15:17,248
It's like the police station.

180
00:15:17,508 --> 00:15:18,588
There's a problem out there.

181
00:15:18,948 --> 00:15:19,989
It's being discussed.

182
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:21,429
It needs to be discussed.

183
00:15:21,569 --> 00:15:25,331
It needs to be revolutionized to the point it needs change.

184
00:15:26,031 --> 00:15:28,292
New council coming in, new administration coming in.

185
00:15:28,712 --> 00:15:30,152
I hope the change takes effect.

186
00:15:30,933 --> 00:15:34,954
But the people, you, the taxpayers out there, you're paying for this each and every day.

187
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:46,878
And you need to hold every one of the councils accountable, as well as the mayor, to make sure that your tax dollars, your cable bills, your water bills, anything that revolves around you paying for something in this community,

188
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:51,786
for a service or a tax or a bill is being accounted for and spent wisely.

189
00:15:51,806 --> 00:16:14,262
I would hope, and I'll leave this as a thought rather than asking or putting the council on the spot, I would hope as a thought that the incoming city council does not allow this to continue to go on, that you come up and step up forward in demand of the new city administration, that you want cable access television here in the city of Medford.

190
00:16:14,702 --> 00:16:16,183
That's what the people have paid for.

191
00:16:16,802 --> 00:16:22,246
If not, give them the $450,000 back and figure out another way to do business here because it's absolutely wrong.

192
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:26,969
It's almost stealing people's money and not doing what they're supposed to be doing with it.

193
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:28,710
And that is just so wrong.

194
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:34,434
You don't tell our kids when you're making them grow up, this is the way life is supposed to be.

195
00:16:34,674 --> 00:16:38,657
You pay for something you're not getting or you take something that you don't deserve.

196
00:16:38,677 --> 00:16:40,298
That's exactly what's happening.

197
00:16:40,859 --> 00:16:44,901
The city has taken your money that they don't deserve because they're not doing anything with it.

198
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:45,802
And at the same time,

199
00:16:46,102 --> 00:16:47,843
You're paying for something that you're not getting.

200
00:16:48,703 --> 00:16:51,184
It's a no-win situation for you, the ratepayers.

201
00:16:51,905 --> 00:17:06,391
So with that being said, I would hope, Mr. President, and Rick, I know next year, I'm assuming if the deal is the way the deal is supposed to be, you as the president of the council, you would be able to tell, you know, this is where we're going to go with this particular direction.

202
00:17:06,932 --> 00:17:11,694
And as far as that goes, Mr. President, I leave my comments as they are.

203
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:12,454
Thank you.

204
00:17:12,494 --> 00:17:13,735
Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

205
00:17:15,504 --> 00:17:16,504
Thank you, Mr. President.

206
00:17:16,624 --> 00:17:18,946
And I want to thank my colleague, Counselor Penta.

207
00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:24,771
There's been no bigger advocate for public access in this community than Counselor Penta over the years.

208
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,013
But he hit the nail on the head.

209
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:34,519
Where else, Mr. President, can you pay for a service and not receive it, and then no one says anything?

210
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:38,221
It'd be like going to the gas station and saying, give me $10 worth.

211
00:17:38,302 --> 00:17:41,544
They give you $9, and then you say, thank you very much, and you leave.

212
00:17:42,105 --> 00:17:42,645
Salem Street.

213
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:43,766
It doesn't happen that way.

214
00:17:44,702 --> 00:17:45,762
That's not the way it works.

215
00:17:46,162 --> 00:17:50,803
And for several years now, residents of this community have been paying, take a look at your bill.

216
00:17:51,663 --> 00:17:59,325
You're paying a franchise fee for local access peg, which is public access, the government and educational channel.

217
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:09,407
And for several years now, public access, in my opinion, which is probably the more important of the three, which allows people to come in and do local programming.

218
00:18:09,903 --> 00:18:14,366
You know, it's great to watch 4, 5, 7 and all the History Channel and all those channels.

219
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:15,707
They got great programming.

220
00:18:16,187 --> 00:18:32,118
But what better to have local access where you can watch a local show and talk about local issues and see local people on TV discussing politics, discussing athletics, discussing education, discussing a myriad of issues in the community.

221
00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:35,541
And we've been cheated out of that for several years now.

222
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:39,023
And it's unfortunate, as my council colleague mentioned,

223
00:18:39,624 --> 00:18:41,869
It's almost half a million dollars.

224
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,514
This is not chump change that we're talking about.

225
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:48,944
It's a half a million dollars of ratepayer money.

226
00:18:50,245 --> 00:18:53,406
And, you know, for the most part, you know, people may be looking for it.

227
00:18:53,426 --> 00:19:02,250
But now public access has been out of the public realm for so many years now, I don't even think people know that they're not getting it anymore, Mr. President.

228
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,011
And it's a real shame.

229
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,471
It really is a real shame.

230
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:07,732
And I agree with my colleague.

231
00:19:08,373 --> 00:19:14,795
I hope, you know, under the city charter, the only one that signs contracts in the community is the administration.

232
00:19:14,835 --> 00:19:15,375
It's the mayor.

233
00:19:16,316 --> 00:19:19,037
And the mayor has put together a contract

234
00:19:19,457 --> 00:19:24,299
with Verizon and Comcast, which includes public access.

235
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:32,842
And the mayor says, Verizon and Comcast, it's all right for you to charge every person under my city an additional fee.

236
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:38,065
But the mayor has been the one to neglect not to provide the service, Mr. President.

237
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:41,926
So the mayor is saying, Comcast, Verizon, go in and tax these people.

238
00:19:42,286 --> 00:19:43,567
Take money out of their pocket.

239
00:19:44,524 --> 00:19:46,124
but I'm not going to provide the service.

240
00:19:46,504 --> 00:19:47,285
That's what's happening.

241
00:19:47,725 --> 00:19:52,866
Because if you call Comcast and Verizon, they'll tell you they have nothing to do with local programming.

242
00:19:53,186 --> 00:19:54,246
That's up to the community.

243
00:19:55,246 --> 00:20:03,448
So it's been the mayor, Mr. President, that's been reaching his hand in the pockets of each and every ratepayer in this community and not providing the service.

244
00:20:05,449 --> 00:20:07,109
Where else can you do that, Mr. President?

245
00:20:08,069 --> 00:20:10,950
There should be a class action suit in this community.

246
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:15,680
Where else can you charge people for a service you're not getting?

247
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,341
It makes no sense at all.

248
00:20:17,761 --> 00:20:18,501
It really doesn't.

249
00:20:19,002 --> 00:20:27,265
And I can appreciate the fact that there were some tough times back a few years ago, but it doesn't take two, three, four years.

250
00:20:28,135 --> 00:20:31,276
to put together a cable operation, public access.

251
00:20:31,656 --> 00:20:33,077
It doesn't take that long.

252
00:20:33,397 --> 00:20:39,839
We have plenty of capable people in the community that are willing to step up and run this particular channel.

253
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:47,001
We have students from Meffitt High School and the elementary and middle schools that want to partake in this.

254
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:54,483
We're missing precious sports events that we could be taping, like the Thanksgiving game, although this game we probably didn't want to tape.

255
00:20:55,113 --> 00:20:55,814
this past game.

256
00:20:55,854 --> 00:21:01,977
But, you know, we're missing a lot of things, Mr. President, that are going on in this community.

257
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:03,538
And it's a real shame.

258
00:21:03,778 --> 00:21:05,359
It really is, Mr. President.

259
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:13,164
And I hope, you know, before the mayor leaves, I hope that he acts on — there's a number of issues on the table that the mayor is yet to act on.

260
00:21:13,785 --> 00:21:16,606
And I'm hoping the next week or two he acts on them.

261
00:21:16,646 --> 00:21:19,188
But this is one that's too important to let go.

262
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,230
This is one that, you know, everyone's paying for.

263
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,931
And if the mayor is against,

264
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:27,125
public access, just come out and say it.

265
00:21:28,005 --> 00:21:31,007
And then say, okay, we're going to stop charging for public access.

266
00:21:31,427 --> 00:21:32,867
That would be the right thing to do.

267
00:21:33,448 --> 00:21:35,208
Maybe the mayor's opposed to public access.

268
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:42,672
Maybe the mayor doesn't want the laundry issued out on local access and wants to keep everything in a vacuum.

269
00:21:43,112 --> 00:21:44,432
And he's doing a great job of that.

270
00:21:44,773 --> 00:21:48,434
But the case is, he's also charging us for that service.

271
00:21:48,814 --> 00:21:51,956
So I thank my council colleague, Councilor Penta, on this issue.

272
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:54,797
And I hope maybe under the next administration,

273
00:21:55,153 --> 00:22:04,399
there's more transparency, and that that administration realizes the need for public access, and especially in a community of this size, Mr. President.

274
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:05,079
Thank you.

275
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,340
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

276
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,581
Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.

277
00:22:09,722 --> 00:22:10,683
No, I'm good.

278
00:22:11,383 --> 00:22:11,683
All set?

279
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,845
Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

280
00:22:13,985 --> 00:22:14,785
Thank you, Mr. President.

281
00:22:14,945 --> 00:22:15,786
Councilor Marks is right.

282
00:22:16,366 --> 00:22:18,968
Most people probably don't even know they're getting charged at 35 cents.

283
00:22:19,828 --> 00:22:21,830
My question is, what happened to that

284
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:29,445
program that Comcast was supposed to start, we were one of the four cities in the country that were going to get this access station.

285
00:22:29,545 --> 00:22:31,846
Where did that disappear?

286
00:22:31,866 --> 00:22:32,427
Where did that go?

287
00:22:33,287 --> 00:22:42,694
If we could look into where that went and why it never developed into this great thing that it was supposed to be that they advertised.

288
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:48,919
Four cities in the country were going to get this, and we were one of the four, and never heard from again.

289
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,581
If we could ask where that program went to.

290
00:22:53,520 --> 00:23:10,165
Uh, that is an amendment of council Caviello that the mayor's office informed the city council regarding to the status of, uh, Medford being one of four communities nationally under Comcast to, uh, receive special broadcasting channel, open voice, open channel or something.

291
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:10,425
Yeah.

292
00:23:11,026 --> 00:23:11,366
Very good.

293
00:23:11,846 --> 00:23:12,146
Thank you.

294
00:23:12,186 --> 00:23:12,546
Counselor.

295
00:23:12,966 --> 00:23:13,306
Is that all?

296
00:23:13,847 --> 00:23:14,047
Yes.

297
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:14,547
Thank you.

298
00:23:14,587 --> 00:23:18,308
Counselor chair recognizes vice president logo current.

299
00:23:18,651 --> 00:23:20,172
Thank you, President De La Rousseau.

300
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:21,973
I, too, agree with my colleagues.

301
00:23:22,393 --> 00:23:26,275
It's been two years since TV3 was abolished.

302
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:31,297
It's been probably five or six since the Judge Jackson report.

303
00:23:31,657 --> 00:23:43,263
It's also been over a year since the administration put together a three-person committee that gave recommendations on how to take, I believe it was, almost $200,000 and implement a new TV3 station.

304
00:23:44,224 --> 00:23:47,105
Over a year, we've been waiting over a year

305
00:23:47,578 --> 00:23:51,181
to get those recommendations looked at and implemented.

306
00:23:51,601 --> 00:24:03,752
And that's pretty sad, especially when you're collecting money off of the rate payers bill and it's just sitting there along with the $10 million in water retained earnings and $10 million in free cash.

307
00:24:03,812 --> 00:24:10,217
It's just another tax that we are charging the rate payers and it's just sitting there.

308
00:24:11,058 --> 00:24:15,602
Public access, we spoke out, this council spoke out hard

309
00:24:16,224 --> 00:24:21,047
very hard against the prior TV3 board and what was going on.

310
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:25,269
And it finally, you know, things happened that should have happened.

311
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:33,133
But now we've waited two years before any implementation, any use of that money to go towards a good cause.

312
00:24:33,594 --> 00:24:39,337
We're robbing our children, our teenagers, our anybody who wants to use public access.

313
00:24:39,797 --> 00:24:41,918
And we're just, we're robbing the people.

314
00:24:42,218 --> 00:24:43,079
It's unfortunate.

315
00:24:43,139 --> 00:24:45,440
And I hope that the new administration really

316
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,074
is interested in this issue.

317
00:24:47,094 --> 00:24:56,102
I hope that a station is implemented in a centrally located area within this community that everybody can get to and everybody can use.

318
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:57,683
Everybody pays for it.

319
00:24:57,783 --> 00:25:05,169
Anybody that's a Verizon or cable or Comcast subscriber is paying for this, and it's something that everybody should be able to use.

320
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:09,172
Two years ago, this should have happened, not now.

321
00:25:09,553 --> 00:25:12,755
And at this point, we're going to be going at least two and a half years.

322
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:20,721
new administration takes this very seriously, and we implement some of the recommendations that were put forth over a year ago.

323
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:25,922
Thank you, Madam Vice President.

324
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,683
Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.

325
00:25:30,383 --> 00:25:31,703
Thank you, Mr. President.

326
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:36,804
Comcast Open Voice, that was actually—it wasn't public access.

327
00:25:36,844 --> 00:25:39,825
That was more a website initiative.

328
00:25:40,435 --> 00:25:56,224
that Comcast did, so we were one of either four or five, like Councilor Marks indicated, cities throughout the nation that did receive that grant or funding for it, but it was more towards webpage development and have the interaction through the web, not on public access.

329
00:25:57,744 --> 00:26:06,089
You know, I certainly think that the new administration going forward is going to, if anyone's going to get it up and running, it's going to be the new administration.

330
00:26:06,503 --> 00:26:10,744
They're going to come in here, I'm assuming, and they're going to want to get things done in this community.

331
00:26:11,164 --> 00:26:14,826
And public access hasn't been on the air for quite some time.

332
00:26:15,766 --> 00:26:26,109
This city council is well on record on trying to shut down public access over the years with the TV3 gang by a myriad of votes that took place.

333
00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:35,212
So I certainly am in support of Councilor Penta's motion to get a public access station up and running.

334
00:26:35,632 --> 00:26:36,292
And quite honestly,

335
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:39,669
It was a few months ago that I joked with Counselor Penta.

336
00:26:40,129 --> 00:26:42,250
I plan on having you on my cooking show.

337
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,671
And you actually said you'd come.

338
00:26:44,531 --> 00:26:46,212
So I'm going to have a show.

339
00:26:46,232 --> 00:26:48,032
When it's up and running, it's going to be a cooking show.

340
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:52,754
And I'm going to have you on, and the two of us are going to break bread together, and we're going to make a nice Italian dish.

341
00:26:55,735 --> 00:26:56,596
That'll be wonderful.

342
00:26:58,256 --> 00:26:59,056
Thank you, Counselor.

343
00:27:00,177 --> 00:27:05,119
On the motion of, the motion of, on the motion, sir.

344
00:27:06,088 --> 00:27:09,630
on the motion of Councilor Pente as amended by Councilor Caviello.

345
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,871
The Chair recognizes the citizens who wish to speak.

346
00:27:13,551 --> 00:27:13,991
Joe Viglione, 59.

347
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:15,752
Please state your name and address for the record.

348
00:27:15,832 --> 00:27:16,172
Welcome.

349
00:27:16,753 --> 00:27:17,113
Welcome.

350
00:27:17,193 --> 00:27:18,473
Thank you, Council President.

351
00:27:18,513 --> 00:27:20,414
Joseph Viglione, 59 Garfield Ave.

352
00:27:21,395 --> 00:27:31,599
Correction, Project Open Voice was a deal that Comcast made with the FCC in order to purchase Universal Films and NBC.

353
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:33,538
It isn't web-based.

354
00:27:33,678 --> 00:27:34,838
It is video-on-demand.

355
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:39,139
My Rob Gronkowski interview was on Channel 1.

356
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:41,800
That is where all the candidates should have been.

357
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,300
The mayor, once again, derelict in his duties.

358
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:51,381
The mayor is the same stumbling block with video-on-demand, Project Open Voice, made in Medford.

359
00:27:51,881 --> 00:27:53,942
There were six cities and towns across the country.

360
00:27:54,262 --> 00:27:55,662
We were added on as the sixth.

361
00:27:55,722 --> 00:27:56,462
There were five.

362
00:27:57,202 --> 00:28:01,603
Somehow, they saw that there was no public access in Medford thanks to Medford Community Cablevision.

363
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:07,073
So they had to, to satisfy the FCC, come on board and bring it here, but we didn't get it.

364
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:09,894
They promised me five airings on channel one.

365
00:28:09,974 --> 00:28:10,715
I only got one.

366
00:28:11,215 --> 00:28:20,640
They were supposed to give us infinite, every one of you, but it takes up some band space and they didn't want to give the bandwidth to us to put it on TV on channel one.

367
00:28:21,081 --> 00:28:27,224
It was lost in a jungle anyway, but the point is every single candidate should have had time on video on demand.

368
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:27,904
That's number one.

369
00:28:30,346 --> 00:28:30,686
Number two.

370
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:35,384
$450,000, a little bit more than that.

371
00:28:35,664 --> 00:28:37,725
$200,000 a year goes to three teachers' salaries.

372
00:28:37,765 --> 00:28:38,646
That's inappropriate.

373
00:28:38,806 --> 00:28:39,386
That's wrong.

374
00:28:39,866 --> 00:28:40,627
The mayor does that.

375
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:49,472
The rest of the money, and I assume it's around $600,000, nice to see that a city councilor getting paid $32,000 a year, $30,000 a year leaves.

376
00:28:49,552 --> 00:28:50,832
Every time I speak.

377
00:28:51,553 --> 00:28:57,096
Every time I speak, the disrespect of some on this city council is why we have no access.

378
00:28:57,896 --> 00:29:00,918
And that's free speech, and you know that, Council President.

379
00:29:01,335 --> 00:29:04,176
Now, there's about 600 grand into the general fund.

380
00:29:04,256 --> 00:29:06,137
Where is this money going to this black hole?

381
00:29:07,017 --> 00:29:08,058
Councilor Mox is right.

382
00:29:08,658 --> 00:29:11,439
I believe I'm the first citizen to say class action suit.

383
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,380
I got harangued by the city solicitor.

384
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,341
You shouldn't talk about lawsuits at the city council.

385
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:17,921
How dare you?

386
00:29:18,501 --> 00:29:19,182
Free speech.

387
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:21,723
Class action suit.

388
00:29:21,763 --> 00:29:23,643
The mayor is derelict in his duties.

389
00:29:23,783 --> 00:29:24,384
I've looked it up.

390
00:29:24,404 --> 00:29:25,144
There's precedent.

391
00:29:25,284 --> 00:29:27,565
He is wrong, but no one has any spine.

392
00:29:28,571 --> 00:29:33,334
We need to unite as a community and get this very important free speech platform up.

393
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:38,678
You know, last night, I was asked to be a guest host on Somerville, Somerville Line.

394
00:29:39,498 --> 00:29:43,081
It was the first time in 36 years that I've been back on Somerville TV.

395
00:29:43,101 --> 00:29:44,141
As you know, I'm on radio.

396
00:29:44,842 --> 00:29:46,183
Today, I saw Star Wars.

397
00:29:46,763 --> 00:29:49,325
Tomorrow, Somerville gets my Star Wars review.

398
00:29:49,925 --> 00:29:51,086
Somerville, not Medford.

399
00:29:51,626 --> 00:29:55,389
I'm one of only 50 critics, probably in New England, that got to see Star Wars today.

400
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:08,334
Medford Culture, Johnny Byer Sports Program, all of the sports that we've lost that could be at the library right now for parents and friends and relatives of these athletes.

401
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:11,015
Oh, this city council will praise the athletes.

402
00:30:11,315 --> 00:30:22,039
You do a better job, a better service for the athletes when you let them videotape, preserve on DVD, preserve on the internet their sports performances.

403
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:23,379
We might have the next Bobby Orr.

404
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:25,740
We might have the next Tom Brady.

405
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:36,126
We might have the next Nancy Kerrigan, but we don't in Medford because the mayor, the dictator has decided that we don't get access TV that we pay for.

406
00:30:36,706 --> 00:30:38,147
It's about a million dollars a year.

407
00:30:38,187 --> 00:30:39,028
It's not 450 K in there.

408
00:30:39,108 --> 00:30:45,091
It's a lot more money that this mayor just kind of plays slate of hand and gets rid of.

409
00:30:47,173 --> 00:30:50,255
Brett blank is the attorney at the attorney general's office.

410
00:30:51,275 --> 00:30:52,516
Who's looking into Lynn cam.

411
00:30:53,819 --> 00:31:01,921
After many of my public records requests to the AG's office about Medford Community Cablevision, I finally got a response from Brett Blank himself, which says to me,

412
00:31:03,135 --> 00:31:10,837
The fellow who's investigating Lincoln and brought them into court in Boston may be bringing Medford Community Cablevision into court finally.

413
00:31:10,937 --> 00:31:12,737
They said, law enforcement's looking into it.

414
00:31:13,197 --> 00:31:14,038
Where's that money?

415
00:31:14,298 --> 00:31:15,338
That's additional money.

416
00:31:15,738 --> 00:31:16,698
We need a station.

417
00:31:17,238 --> 00:31:22,079
I will build a radio station here, even if it's a for-profit, if we get snubbed again and slapped around.

418
00:31:22,499 --> 00:31:23,500
And there will be a lawsuit.

419
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,920
I've spoken to many lawyers.

420
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,920
One of them's name is McGlynn.

421
00:31:27,101 --> 00:31:28,021
I thought that was hilarious.

422
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:29,121
He's not related at all.

423
00:31:29,812 --> 00:31:33,216
But I am talking about a class action suit, and the people can contact me.

424
00:31:33,656 --> 00:31:35,938
We're going to sue for our access to TV if we don't get it.

425
00:31:36,699 --> 00:31:41,925
And it will be Michael J. McGlynn and Stephanie Muccini Burke as defendants, and maybe some of the city council.

426
00:31:43,606 --> 00:31:44,007
Thank you.

427
00:31:44,707 --> 00:31:45,208
Good evening.

428
00:31:45,348 --> 00:31:47,070
Please state your name and address for the record.

429
00:31:48,426 --> 00:31:52,949
I don't want to rehash the old stuff.

430
00:31:53,389 --> 00:32:01,054
The bottom line is that the new mayor, moving forward, the new mayor has a history of being attacked by the old TV3.

431
00:32:01,174 --> 00:32:08,558
So she has personal interest in knowing what a bad TV station can do for the city.

432
00:32:09,098 --> 00:32:11,840
But now we need to move forward and we need to

433
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,138
It doesn't take rocket science to put this together.

434
00:32:15,418 --> 00:32:16,979
All the communities around us have it.

435
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:18,260
All of them.

436
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:22,402
Malden is not as wealthy a community as Medford.

437
00:32:22,802 --> 00:32:24,563
I don't care by what standard you use.

438
00:32:24,963 --> 00:32:31,366
And they have a very vibrant TV station right in the middle of this square where everybody is welcome.

439
00:32:32,026 --> 00:32:32,406
Everybody.

440
00:32:32,446 --> 00:32:34,327
You guys all give lip service to diversity?

441
00:32:34,687 --> 00:32:35,808
Go to the Malden station.

442
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:37,288
You will see diversity.

443
00:32:37,709 --> 00:32:38,689
And you will see the arts.

444
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,610
Hello, art community.

445
00:32:41,145 --> 00:32:43,345
You will see dancing on that station.

446
00:32:43,405 --> 00:32:48,026
You will see the government doing their thing like we are here with the government meetings.

447
00:32:48,486 --> 00:32:51,447
But you'll see a diversity in thought and ideas.

448
00:32:51,987 --> 00:32:58,948
But you know, that's what the old mayor didn't want and he got away with it because he had friends at the statehouse and because he had friends everywhere.

449
00:33:00,148 --> 00:33:01,788
This new mayor has a new start.

450
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:03,289
She can start fresh.

451
00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:10,510
She can start with the, you know, and if there are problems like in the past, which she is very aware of, such as

452
00:33:11,771 --> 00:33:22,939
money disappearing, attacks on personalities and characteristics, then we need to have a format by which to get rid of those people on the station.

453
00:33:23,699 --> 00:33:29,043
And it isn't rocket science because they're all doing it all around us and we're losing out.

454
00:33:29,463 --> 00:33:33,006
And this affects the business community, Mr. Carviello,

455
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:36,960
This affects the, well, I think of business, I think of him.

456
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,820
That's why I voted for him.

457
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,260
Anyway, and you better do something for the square.

458
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:42,481
So anyway, I'm going to hold you to it.

459
00:33:42,881 --> 00:33:46,962
But anyway, you know, it helps the business community.

460
00:33:47,082 --> 00:33:51,603
It helps the arts community, the theater, the theater, the Chevalier Theater.

461
00:33:52,123 --> 00:33:53,323
It helps everything.

462
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:57,144
And it is a waste of time and money to put it in this Vogue.

463
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:01,385
Not that I'm against having them be taught those skill sets at the Vogue.

464
00:34:01,765 --> 00:34:03,045
But it puts more money in the Vogue.

465
00:34:04,233 --> 00:34:14,055
Unfortunately, and I have to go through this laundry list, all new schools 10 years ago, a new pool, two new stadiums, all money going towards the students.

466
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:24,297
I'm not against the students, but the students and the schools have gotten the lion's share of all the monies, and now they have another part to play with, which is this technology.

467
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,217
They got the tech bill.

468
00:34:25,637 --> 00:34:26,397
That was another one.

469
00:34:26,718 --> 00:34:27,778
They've gotten a chunk of change.

470
00:34:27,818 --> 00:34:33,559
The only thing on the city side has been a $14 million DPW yard that isn't even sufficient

471
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,301
And it's brand new, because it has problems.

472
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,742
So it needed more money.

473
00:34:38,262 --> 00:34:42,564
So the balance is shifted towards the schools already.

474
00:34:43,364 --> 00:34:48,507
We can put it in Haines Square, because there's plenty of empty lots and empty storefronts there.

475
00:34:48,967 --> 00:34:56,470
I wish it was in the Medford Square, because that is the most vibrant place that it can lift the square right up.

476
00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:02,073
Between the library being redone, the Chevalier, and the TV3 being in a storefront,

477
00:35:02,938 --> 00:35:09,041
It can really pick up the square and make it more user-friendly, make the square better, bring people in.

478
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:11,182
They'll have something to do besides go to eat.

479
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,663
They'll have something to eat because they're there.

480
00:35:14,243 --> 00:35:15,343
So it'll all work out.

481
00:35:15,704 --> 00:35:18,545
But if you don't, if you let this stay at the high school,

482
00:35:19,878 --> 00:35:25,639
which is better than nothing, but it's still going to hamper free speech up at the high school.

483
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:26,219
It really will.

484
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:34,181
Because it's going to be, people are going to feel that they're in a public building, and they're going to feel like they can't say certain things because they're in a public building.

485
00:35:34,661 --> 00:35:38,162
Plus, it's not accessible the way that it would be in Memphis Square.

486
00:35:38,222 --> 00:35:43,383
But right now, you can put it in Haines Square, because I know that there are empty storefronts right on Salem Street.

487
00:35:43,803 --> 00:35:45,465
and you can just tuck it right in there for now.

488
00:35:46,025 --> 00:35:52,871
But anyway, thank you for listening, and I hope that we have free speech, and the arts, and business, and all of that that can come from this.

489
00:35:53,311 --> 00:36:00,638
Those three things, the library, the Chevalier, and TV3, or community access, would all, you know, just build up the square.

490
00:36:00,898 --> 00:36:02,119
Those three things anchor.

491
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:02,660
Thank you.

492
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,651
Chair recognizes the next citizen who wishes to speak.

493
00:36:13,492 --> 00:36:15,132
Please state your name and address for the record.

494
00:36:15,813 --> 00:36:17,574
The Council will assist you with the microphone.

495
00:36:19,675 --> 00:36:20,075
Thank you.

496
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,976
That's the first accessible part of this City Hall I've seen ever.

497
00:36:25,798 --> 00:36:27,959
Yeah, thank you, Councilor Caruso.

498
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:36,321
Y'all notice that the doors are never, the accessible door button doesn't actually work during city council meetings getting in the building.

499
00:36:37,122 --> 00:36:44,584
That's the same concern I have for the public access station that everybody has been so excited about.

500
00:36:45,364 --> 00:36:47,585
And I recognize that we had an election

501
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:57,871
And if there needs to be a moment of silence because Councillor Penta did not win the mayoral candidacy, then maybe we should have a moment of silence.

502
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:19,626
But I think that if we're going to talk about very important issues, like a public access station, we need to not only talk about free speech, what has happened in the past with the previous mayor, but also accessibility.

503
00:37:21,127 --> 00:37:29,294
and going forward giving the new administration the opportunity to succeed and or fail.

504
00:37:30,074 --> 00:37:41,103
And that's something that concerns me about these meetings, is that before the new administration has been given a chance, they've already been called failures.

505
00:37:42,404 --> 00:37:46,747
Not to mention the people at this meeting who are discussing public access,

506
00:37:48,008 --> 00:37:59,556
are not talking about the way that this generation, and I'm in my 30s, so I'm still considered young by some people, old by my former students, because I was a teacher.

507
00:38:02,057 --> 00:38:09,883
They're not using Channel 3 or the materials available at a public access building to make a cooking show.

508
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:15,364
They're using YouTube, Snapchat, Vine, et cetera.

509
00:38:16,484 --> 00:38:27,369
If the city of Medford truly wants to embrace public access for all citizens, we're going to have to talk about more than the Comcast Verizon scandal.

510
00:38:28,129 --> 00:38:32,311
And we're going to have to talk about more than Channel 3 on a television.

511
00:38:32,331 --> 00:38:38,914
And frankly, I have yet to hear anybody, including former candidates, talk about that.

512
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:40,988
Let's bring that up.

513
00:38:41,668 --> 00:38:51,937
Let's have an informed, sensible, respectful conversation when the new administration takes place.

514
00:38:58,322 --> 00:38:59,162
Thank you very much.

515
00:39:02,165 --> 00:39:02,645
Good evening.

516
00:39:02,685 --> 00:39:03,065
Welcome.

517
00:39:03,286 --> 00:39:04,907
Please state your name and address for the record.

518
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:21,943
Hi, I'm Rachel Tannenhaus, 26 Pearl Street.

519
00:39:23,664 --> 00:39:38,292
I would like to, I'd like to advocate for a comprehensive approach that absolutely includes students and you're never going to hear me complaining about how much money you put into the school system.

520
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:39,810
system, by the way.

521
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:42,751
I think that that is always a wise and sound investment.

522
00:39:44,331 --> 00:40:00,534
But I would love to make sure that even if it's not at the VOC, which is fine, I want to make sure that we have various forms of public access, that I am in favor of a public access TV station.

523
00:40:00,994 --> 00:40:03,795
I also think that the city should look

524
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:31,016
really closely at utilizing social media, what its social media policies are, and maybe provide a comprehensive communications education to its students, including a public access television station, but also discussion of other forms of media, including social media, and the use of them for, say,

525
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:48,457
train kids who probably know a lot more about social media access than we do, but also talk to them about how to use it for things like business, politics, news, that sort of thing, how to create content, how to produce content.

526
00:40:49,357 --> 00:40:50,678
I did not grow up here.

527
00:40:51,178 --> 00:40:53,859
I grew up in Maryland, and I was blessed with an excellent education.

528
00:40:54,439 --> 00:41:00,302
And one of the pillars of my education was a program I was in

529
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:05,556
from 7th through 12th grade in Montgomery County, Maryland, called the Communication Arts Program.

530
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:09,158
It's still there, by the way, 25 years later, more than 25 years later.

531
00:41:09,898 --> 00:41:17,203
And one of the things that we had in high school was a cable access channel run out of our high school.

532
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:29,410
Again, I'm not suggesting that it be at the high school because, or at the VOC, but I am suggesting that there be a concerted effort to involve the schools in making sure that students

533
00:41:30,605 --> 00:41:36,351
And in fact, people of all ages, including seniors, have access to such a station.

534
00:41:37,212 --> 00:41:49,283
It was so important to me that I learned not only to produce news, to report news, I learned to work every single position in a television studio.

535
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,366
And yes, they put me behind a camera.

536
00:41:51,386 --> 00:41:52,847
I'm not sure about the wisdom of that either.

537
00:41:54,059 --> 00:41:58,590
At one point, the director asked me if I was focused, and I was like, you tell me.

538
00:42:05,504 --> 00:42:06,185
Thank you.

539
00:42:07,005 --> 00:42:11,869
But in fact, it taught me that I had a voice.

540
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:14,692
It taught me to look at news critically.

541
00:42:16,153 --> 00:42:19,616
It taught me to be able to communicate better.

542
00:42:21,057 --> 00:42:33,727
And it taught me to listen to the voices of others whose story might not be told by the mainstream and to try to find those voices and make sure that they have

543
00:42:35,228 --> 00:42:36,568
some way to speak.

544
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:51,352
So I feel like these are lessons, especially these days when there's such a torrent of information, such a flood of information from all sides, I think that those are still really vital lessons for students to learn.

545
00:42:51,472 --> 00:42:53,513
And I know that it served me for the rest of my life.

546
00:42:54,372 --> 00:42:59,415
from our program graduated a number of people who became professional journalists, including one who wound up on CNN.

547
00:43:00,316 --> 00:43:11,323
So I feel like, A, I am 100% in support of there being public access, but I think that there needs to be a comprehensive plan to, you know, get the school system involved in it.

548
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:18,748
Especially, and, you know, I actually, one reason not to have it in the schools is because, you know, God bless the schools, but they are,

549
00:43:19,088 --> 00:43:22,632
But public schools are not exactly bastions of free speech because they have kids in them.

550
00:43:23,313 --> 00:43:27,938
And I think it's really good to have, you know, there are things you cannot say in the schools.

551
00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:35,286
And I think that it's good for kids to have a place where they can talk, where they can actually have their voices heard, where they can create media.

552
00:43:38,012 --> 00:43:46,080
So I think that it is something that, you know, talk to the senior centers, how, you know, a lot of folks in the senior community are not being heard.

553
00:43:46,801 --> 00:43:57,891
A lot of people maybe could have, you know, could have a way to be heard and not forgotten because a lot of the time that's how we treat our older members of our society.

554
00:43:58,447 --> 00:44:14,938
So I feel like this could be part of a comprehensive plan, and I feel like it could really benefit large portions of Medford that A, are probably paying this money that's disappearing into the ether, and B, that maybe don't have a voice now.

555
00:44:15,818 --> 00:44:16,158
Thank you.

556
00:44:21,722 --> 00:44:21,962
Hi.

557
00:44:23,043 --> 00:44:24,644
State your name and address for the record.

558
00:44:25,004 --> 00:44:27,626
Joyce Paul, 8 Mason Street, Medford, Mass.

559
00:44:28,348 --> 00:44:40,458
One of the things I wanted to say about, um, access is that the history goes back to the Supreme Judicial Court in Massachusetts.

560
00:44:41,439 --> 00:44:55,071
And the problems, because there was no audit for five years in Medford, um, the situation was put with the Supreme Judicial Court in Massachusetts.

561
00:44:55,754 --> 00:44:59,997
which clearly states there is very poor management and oversight.

562
00:45:00,418 --> 00:45:12,227
I don't think there is any other city in Massachusetts that can say they have so many problems with cable access that it ends up in the Supreme Judicial Court in Massachusetts.

563
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:14,469
And it's been there for a couple of years.

564
00:45:14,529 --> 00:45:16,350
I have no idea what's going to happen with it.

565
00:45:16,771 --> 00:45:25,037
But not having an audit for five years, it went to the police, it went to Martha Coakley, and she put it in the Supreme Judicial Court.

566
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:30,954
There's really management problems in Medford, and I think that's really a shame.

567
00:45:31,954 --> 00:45:32,315
That's all.

568
00:45:33,916 --> 00:45:34,476
Thank you, ma'am.

569
00:45:35,376 --> 00:45:35,817
Good evening.

570
00:45:35,897 --> 00:45:37,537
Please state your name and address for the record.

571
00:45:37,938 --> 00:45:40,959
Yes, Andrew Castanetti, Cushing Street, Medford, Mass.

572
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:49,744
I want to thank for five of the seven counselors for speaking up on this matter of public access, a lack of.

573
00:45:50,693 --> 00:46:10,472
The point of, I believe, information might be, I believe the rate that they deduct from Comcast bills is more like $3.50, I believe, per month, times my guesstimate of 20,000 subscribers, that would be probably over $60,000 per month.

574
00:46:11,373 --> 00:46:14,837
And that would be, I believe, accumulate to

575
00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:21,951
over $700,000 on an annual basis in the past year or two per year.

576
00:46:25,232 --> 00:46:29,093
It is about time that this is reopened.

577
00:46:30,293 --> 00:46:33,094
And I believe it should definitely be in Method Square.

578
00:46:33,114 --> 00:46:39,256
And other communities, as I was pointing out, they have a viable public access.

579
00:46:39,376 --> 00:46:44,758
And it really should be in downtown or the Chevalier

580
00:46:45,408 --> 00:46:56,896
a worse scenario, the TPWR, which is brand new, and there's a lot of rooms I saw that were in an open house when I got a Coke and a smile when they had the grand opening.

581
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:10,967
But Memphis Square would be the best location, and it seems like there's plenty of cash on hand, in place, and maybe more besides that.

582
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:29,478
If I was in charge, I would set a deadline for three months just to get it organized, and therefore add an additional three months more, which is a total of six months, to be reborn and up and running, period.

583
00:47:30,778 --> 00:47:31,639
Just my thoughts.

584
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,339
Thank you, if you're listening.

585
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:35,760
Thank you very much, Andrew.

586
00:47:36,701 --> 00:47:38,462
Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

587
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:39,322
Thank you, Mr. President.

588
00:47:39,688 --> 00:47:50,810
You know, I think the best comment of the night came from the young lady over here, who said, I think we need to look—to relook at the way we look at access television with the new generation and all the new technology.

589
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:58,771
I hope that the new mayor would set up some kind of committee to look at these new forms of access.

590
00:47:59,652 --> 00:48:07,933
Maybe a TV station isn't the way to go, or maybe, as I say, with all these other avenues we have, I think some new forward thinking with

591
00:48:08,828 --> 00:48:17,313
with some younger people who are a little more tech savvy than some of us are, can give us some maybe better direction than what we've had in the past.

592
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:19,375
So, again, I thank her for bringing that forward.

593
00:48:20,295 --> 00:48:24,578
And let's see, hopefully, moving forward, we'll see where that goes.

594
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,120
Thank you, Counselor.

595
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:29,661
The Chair recognizes Counselor Penta.

596
00:48:29,681 --> 00:48:35,625
Mr. President, one of the key components of public access television is taking place here tonight.

597
00:48:35,665 --> 00:48:38,387
We're allowing people—not allowing, this is the People's Forum.

598
00:48:38,765 --> 00:48:42,666
They're having the opportunity to come up and speak for whatever their positions might be.

599
00:48:43,306 --> 00:48:55,590
But in June of 2014, a federal judge by the name of James O. Browning made a very distinct comment as it relates to people who have the opportunity to come up and speak and to give their opinions.

600
00:48:56,150 --> 00:49:07,993
And what that federal judge did to this particular city was to punish, and I won't say use the word punish, was to admonish them for not allowing criticism to be made at a podium.

601
00:49:08,637 --> 00:49:13,699
Because as he said, criticism at a podium is an unconstitutional burden on free speech.

602
00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:21,942
So if somebody wants to come here, or a council wants to compliment, commend, or whatever it might be, or somebody wants to go to that podium and speak in such a manner, so be it.

603
00:49:22,342 --> 00:49:28,624
But criticism of any commentary is just as much important or is just as much a part of free speech.

604
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:36,267
And just as Browning indicated, and he said, limits can be placed on time and topic, but not on a speaker's opinion.

605
00:49:36,787 --> 00:49:45,312
And whatever the speaker feels he'd like to say, within reason, as long as it's not abusive, and it's his opinion, it needs to be allowed.

606
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:48,193
He wrote an 89-page decision, and I'm waiting for that.

607
00:49:48,233 --> 00:49:51,975
I asked for the 89-page decision on that, because that's a huge issue right now.

608
00:49:52,636 --> 00:50:06,323
Freedom of speech, and allowing freedom of speech, and inclusive of freedom of speech, if there's a criticism included in there, and they're saying it, and it's done in fair commentary, it should not be excluded.

609
00:50:06,808 --> 00:50:07,849
and it should not be cut off.

610
00:50:07,889 --> 00:50:17,435
As a matter of fact, this whole decision by the judge banned a particular city council from imposing critiques on anyone who was speaking there.

611
00:50:17,876 --> 00:50:19,477
So I believe it's monumental.

612
00:50:19,497 --> 00:50:21,838
It goes back to June of 2014.

613
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:23,579
It's a federal justice.

614
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:24,980
It's not even a local justice.

615
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,882
It's a federal district court justice making his opinion.

616
00:50:28,343 --> 00:50:31,405
And that's the second time within the year 2014 that two federal judges came out

617
00:50:35,161 --> 00:50:37,623
and made this commentary as it relates to free speech.

618
00:50:37,863 --> 00:50:51,115
And those who might want to critique or be critical of somebody speaking or whatever the commentary might be, as he said, quote, it's an unconstitutional burden on free speech by disallowing someone to voice their opinion, be it in a critique manner.

619
00:50:51,735 --> 00:50:52,076
Thank you.

620
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:56,820
Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.

621
00:50:57,689 --> 00:50:58,869
Thank you, Mr. President.

622
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:00,530
I just, I'd be remissed.

623
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:03,051
We're talking about public access and the holiday season.

624
00:51:03,531 --> 00:51:12,134
You know, um, I just want to thank the individual out there that sent a real nice, um, obscene Christmas card to the Camuso family.

625
00:51:12,855 --> 00:51:24,899
It's someone that, uh, I believe based upon the investigation that's ongoing in handwriting that's been submitted to the Medford city council on petitions over the years that law enforcement, um, utilizing the federal mail service.

626
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:26,720
Um, I think there's, um,

627
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:31,091
I'm sure everyone will hear about it in the near future.

628
00:51:31,511 --> 00:51:47,261
So to that person that sent a card with threats in it, as well as swears, and when my six-year-old opened it up that's just learning how to read, I would just like to thank that individual, because when you screw around with the U.S.

629
00:51:47,321 --> 00:51:51,124
mail, it's not something that people take lightly.

630
00:51:51,844 --> 00:51:57,368
So to that person, I just want to wish them a very happy holiday season, and I'm sure we'll be seeing them very soon.

631
00:51:57,845 --> 00:52:01,066
in the proper place, so Merry Christmas.

632
00:52:01,366 --> 00:52:02,366
Merry Christmas, Councillor.

633
00:52:03,187 --> 00:52:04,507
Chair recognizes Councillor Knight.

634
00:52:05,327 --> 00:52:16,451
Mr. President, thank you very much, and going back to what Councillor Pinto was discussing about the federal court ruling, I believe that the federal court ruling was in response, and I'm asking him for some clarification on this, Mr. President, through you.

635
00:52:17,131 --> 00:52:26,974
I believe that the issue that was before the court was a city council rule precluding people from giving negative comments being deemed unconstitutional, if I'm not mistaken, based on my

636
00:52:27,433 --> 00:52:29,134
research of the issue and understanding of the matter.

637
00:52:29,174 --> 00:52:38,761
I think it wasn't so much that people were being shut down at the microphone and not being allowed to speak, but it was that the council had a rule that said that no negative comments were allowed to be brought up at a meeting.

638
00:52:38,841 --> 00:52:46,566
I think that's what the actual case was that was brought up, but I defer to the gentleman, but if it's my understanding, maybe I'm talking about a different case in 2014.

639
00:52:46,606 --> 00:52:49,368
Thank you, Councillor.

640
00:52:49,588 --> 00:52:51,009
Chair recognizes Councillor Pinto.

641
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:54,751
The case was very succinct and it was not allowing people to speak.

642
00:52:55,311 --> 00:52:55,952
The council

643
00:52:56,534 --> 00:53:04,901
in its wisdom, decided council president, for whatever the reasons might be, did not allow people to make negative comments, to say anything negative at council meetings.

644
00:53:05,442 --> 00:53:09,125
And that, in and of itself, was an unconstitutional burden on free speech.

645
00:53:09,945 --> 00:53:15,490
Whether it was a council rule or the actions that were taking place, it found itself all the way to the Supreme Court.

646
00:53:16,191 --> 00:53:19,153
Strike that, the Federal District Court, by Justice Browning.

647
00:53:19,932 --> 00:53:22,333
So I guess a word to the wise is sufficient.

648
00:53:22,353 --> 00:53:31,835
Whether it's a ruling or not a ruling, or just not allowing anyone, for whatever the reasons might be, not to make a commentary contrary to what was being said, it's not allowable.

649
00:53:32,235 --> 00:53:35,136
It's an exercise against free speech.

650
00:53:35,836 --> 00:53:39,257
And the ruling is very succinct.

651
00:53:39,857 --> 00:53:41,578
There's a difference between.

652
00:53:43,644 --> 00:53:50,967
having a contrary opinion, and speaking in a derisive, derogatory, harmful manner to another individual.

653
00:53:53,128 --> 00:53:56,950
Chair recognizes the citizen at the podium.

654
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:57,711
Welcome.

655
00:53:58,211 --> 00:54:00,452
Please state your name and address for the record.

656
00:54:00,772 --> 00:54:01,132
Thank you.

657
00:54:01,312 --> 00:54:03,153
Valerie Gonzalman, 318 High Street.

658
00:54:04,814 --> 00:54:08,936
Thank you, Councilor Penta, for clarifying that, and so succinctly.

659
00:54:09,576 --> 00:54:10,877
And so I hope that

660
00:54:12,432 --> 00:54:17,535
Judge O'Brien would find my topic and timing acceptable.

661
00:54:18,275 --> 00:54:19,336
I will try to make it brief.

662
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:25,219
First, I'd like to say Counselor Carviello has been helping me this afternoon.

663
00:54:25,259 --> 00:54:26,880
As soon as I called him, he got back to me.

664
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:32,263
And what I have is a concern for a safety matter very near my house.

665
00:54:32,943 --> 00:54:34,764
I live near the bus stop on Walcott Street.

666
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:40,707
I take the bus here each week, and I forget there's lots of buses that say out of order.

667
00:54:40,788 --> 00:54:41,568
Three of them pass me.

668
00:54:42,778 --> 00:54:44,179
So it took a while to get here.

669
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,521
I apologize for being late.

670
00:54:46,661 --> 00:54:54,367
My concern is that last week the city did a really great job replacing cement that was lifting up.

671
00:54:54,407 --> 00:55:00,572
They're doing it all along High Street and other streets near my house, where the tree roots had lifted up the sidewalk.

672
00:55:00,712 --> 00:55:02,093
And they really were hazardous.

673
00:55:02,573 --> 00:55:07,837
And particularly being right near the bus stop, it's a well-traveled sidewalk anyway for school and everything.

674
00:55:09,352 --> 00:55:20,763
But I noticed, um, I think it was on Friday, they started on Tuesday cause I know I had to walk in the street to get to the bus stop because they had yellow tape and, and cones and things in front of, on the sidewalk.

675
00:55:20,783 --> 00:55:23,606
So I walked in the street to get here, which was a little bit dangerous.

676
00:55:23,646 --> 00:55:24,907
Tonight I carried a flashlight.

677
00:55:25,628 --> 00:55:29,712
Um, but later in the week, um, uh, they had finished the job.

678
00:55:29,752 --> 00:55:32,655
They did a really, the cement people came, they did a really good job.

679
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:37,193
looks neat and somebody put dirt in so we can have flowers or grass there again under the tree.

680
00:55:38,193 --> 00:55:47,280
My concern is my sidewalk at the end of where that, say this is the cement, it's a bigger area and I have a wall here, it's collapsing.

681
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:55,836
Something happened in between digging up the cement, replacing the cement, and whatever else they did.

682
00:55:57,417 --> 00:56:00,419
I made two phone calls and felt rather discouraged.

683
00:56:00,479 --> 00:56:01,640
I talked to the law office.

684
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:04,202
They told me I had to talk to DPW, call DPW.

685
00:56:04,562 --> 00:56:06,964
And they said there's no report of any damage being done.

686
00:56:07,465 --> 00:56:10,467
So I felt like the great burden of proof was now going to be on me.

687
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:15,851
And of course, I was not on guard duty all week while the city repaired the sidewalk.

688
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,211
Councilor Carvajal told me.

689
00:56:19,231 --> 00:56:28,194
DPW, Mr. President, I did speak to DPW and they will be down there tomorrow to inspect the damage and report back to me.

690
00:56:28,994 --> 00:56:31,394
Councilor Carvajal to the rescue again.

691
00:56:31,434 --> 00:56:32,215
Thank you, Councilor.

692
00:56:32,755 --> 00:56:36,636
And my concern is that, um, your council, your city council is at work.

693
00:56:37,216 --> 00:56:37,416
Yes.

694
00:56:38,116 --> 00:56:40,056
My concern is, do I need to take photographs?

695
00:56:40,356 --> 00:56:46,538
Um, I mean, I don't know how to present my case and how to prove, I mean, how, how am I going to prove who did it?

696
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:50,059
May I suggest that Councillor Caviello would advise you on this matter?

697
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:51,180
Okay, thank you.

698
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,923
Do you recognize this Councillor Knight?

699
00:56:55,344 --> 00:57:06,012
Mr. President, I am aware that when contracted work is done in the community that they usually make a video beforehand of what it looked like and then the before and after photos are available.

700
00:57:06,152 --> 00:57:12,558
If it was done by a private contractor and not done by the Medford DPW, it seems like in this instance it may have been done by the DPW, but in other instances,

701
00:57:13,546 --> 00:57:17,188
Normally we'll have a video on file and that could be accessed through the engineering office.

702
00:57:17,208 --> 00:57:19,710
So that might be, uh, well, let's hope so for her sake.

703
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:27,796
And, uh, again, we thank you for coming forward and we're grateful to our colleague for his, uh, dependable and quick action.

704
00:57:29,657 --> 00:57:36,461
So on the motion of council Penta as amended by councilor Caviello, all those in favor, all those opposed motion passes.

705
00:57:38,503 --> 00:57:38,663
Yes.

706
00:57:40,363 --> 00:57:43,004
Motion for suspension of the rules by Councilor Knight.

707
00:57:43,024 --> 00:57:43,764
All those in favor?

708
00:57:44,104 --> 00:57:44,824
All those opposed?

709
00:57:45,644 --> 00:57:50,786
Suspension of the rules to take a paper off the table from last week, Councilor.

710
00:57:51,006 --> 00:57:51,686
Mr. President, paper 15789.

711
00:57:51,926 --> 00:58:01,409
Back, well, maybe four months ago, this council had met with the chief of police relative to a number of concerns relative to resident parking.

712
00:58:02,109 --> 00:58:08,911
And one of the discussions that the traffic commission was having was implementing a citywide permitting process for resident parking.

713
00:58:09,472 --> 00:58:11,454
And I'd like an update on that, Mr. President.

714
00:58:11,494 --> 00:58:13,957
As the winter fast approaches, the parking wars begin.

715
00:58:14,237 --> 00:58:18,702
And you wouldn't know that today's December 15th or so based upon the weather.

716
00:58:18,762 --> 00:58:23,007
But after our first snowfall, I think we're all going to find out about it relatively quickly, Mr. President.

717
00:58:23,407 --> 00:58:30,815
So I'm hoping that the Traffic Commission will be willing to provide us with an update as to where they are in terms of their deliberation on resident citywide permit parking.

718
00:58:31,478 --> 00:58:34,500
On the motion of Councilor Knight for approval, all those in favor?

719
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:35,981
All those opposed?

720
00:58:36,441 --> 00:58:37,182
Motion passes.

721
00:58:37,962 --> 00:58:42,325
While we're under suspension, we'll take two papers in the hand of the clerk.

722
00:58:42,885 --> 00:58:44,706
Number one offered by Councilor Marks.

723
00:58:45,347 --> 00:58:49,149
Be it resolved that the speed bumps on Harvard Street and Central Avenue be discussed.

724
00:58:49,569 --> 00:58:51,050
Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

725
00:58:52,331 --> 00:58:53,331
Thank you, Mr. President.

726
00:58:53,532 --> 00:58:57,334
If my memory serves me correct, it was about probably

727
00:58:57,979 --> 00:59:04,403
A year and a half, two years ago, the mayor created a raised crosswalk pilot program in the city.

728
00:59:04,443 --> 00:59:05,444
Three years ago, thank you.

729
00:59:06,284 --> 00:59:16,471
And at that time, they came out with three locations, Winthrop Street, Central Ave, and Harvard Street for raised crosswalks for the first phase of implementation.

730
00:59:16,971 --> 00:59:22,295
Winthrop Street, as we all know, has been done and quite successful from what I hear from area residents.

731
00:59:23,708 --> 00:59:49,130
However, over the last, I think it was six, seven months ago, Central Ave, a speed bump popped up in the middle of Central Ave, and now just recently Harvard Street now has the same speed bump, which is very different than a raised crosswalk, and many surrounding communities that have used speed bumps are now removing it, like the city of Malden had several speed bumps,

732
00:59:49,793 --> 00:59:53,834
and have removed them for various public safety issues and concerns.

733
00:59:54,754 --> 01:00:09,938
I asked, I believe it was two weeks ago, that we get a response back from the city administration regarding why speed bumps are popping up on our streets rather than the raised crosswalk, and we did not get a response, Mr. President, to date.

734
01:00:10,558 --> 01:00:12,359
So again, I am asking that

735
01:00:13,223 --> 01:00:31,431
We reach out to the administration to find out why they are installing speed bumps rather than the anticipated and proposed raised crosswalks, which are far better in traffic calming than a speed bump.

736
01:00:32,031 --> 01:00:34,732
So I would again ask that question, Mr. President.

737
01:00:35,913 --> 01:00:39,134
I know there's been some e-mails going back and forth.

738
01:00:39,694 --> 01:00:41,435
I know the bike, method bike

739
01:00:42,245 --> 01:00:44,407
is concerned about these speed bumps also.

740
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:47,390
And there have been a number of issues raised.

741
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:55,418
And residents that were waiting for these raised crosswalks now are questioning why speed bumps are showing up.

742
01:00:56,018 --> 01:00:58,460
And we have yet to get any response from the administration.

743
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,243
On the motion of approval by Councilman Marks.

744
01:01:02,244 --> 01:01:04,166
Sir, please state your name and address for the record.

745
01:01:04,226 --> 01:01:05,147
Welcome, my neighbor.

746
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:07,270
Anthony D'Antonio, 12 Yale Street.

747
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:20,378
In reference to the speed bumps on Harvard Street, coincidentally I happen to be talking with an individual today who lives on Harvard Street, whose daughter is bedridden and is right in the vicinity of where that speed bump is.

748
01:01:21,138 --> 01:01:26,302
Now, the majority of vehicles that come up Harvard Street, well not the majority, but quite a few are trucks.

749
01:01:26,862 --> 01:01:29,864
Some of them have pallets on them, some of them have two wheelers on them.

750
01:01:30,727 --> 01:01:32,429
I hear it from in the back of my house.

751
01:01:33,229 --> 01:01:33,770
It goes over.

752
01:01:34,951 --> 01:01:36,573
It's the sounds, unbelievable.

753
01:01:37,073 --> 01:01:45,701
And apparently, these sounds, right directly, diagonally across from this person's house, is driving these people crazy with the noise.

754
01:01:45,761 --> 01:01:46,902
I mean, it's terrible.

755
01:01:47,703 --> 01:01:56,291
You know, the speed hump, which is a little, you know, not as, you know, pronounced as the speed bump.

756
01:01:56,672 --> 01:01:59,415
would be a much better fit for Harvard Street.

757
01:01:59,535 --> 01:02:01,436
Because if you went there, you'd have to listen to it.

758
01:02:01,476 --> 01:02:03,238
You wouldn't, you won't believe the sound you hear there.

759
01:02:03,738 --> 01:02:04,679
It's very noticeable.

760
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:06,721
So that's the only point I wanted to make.

761
01:02:07,162 --> 01:02:09,464
And it was coincidentally that I bumped into this gentleman.

762
01:02:09,664 --> 01:02:10,705
So thank you.

763
01:02:11,846 --> 01:02:13,207
On the motion approved by Councilor Marks.

764
01:02:13,227 --> 01:02:13,908
All those in favor.

765
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:18,632
Chair recognizes Councilor Pinto.

766
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:21,775
On the raised crosswalks, now we just got through putting one on Winthrop Street a couple of years ago.

767
01:02:22,607 --> 01:02:30,257
And you could drive down that street right now and go over it so that there's nothing to indicate other than a sign or a thing on a pole.

768
01:02:32,139 --> 01:02:33,822
Cars go down that street kind of like fast.

769
01:02:33,842 --> 01:02:39,028
I saw a bus the other day almost do a pretty good, pretty high jump going over that speed bump.

770
01:02:39,349 --> 01:02:41,031
Maybe they should paint that thing yellow.

771
01:02:41,722 --> 01:02:45,363
with that special paint, so to let people know that there is a speed bump that they're approaching.

772
01:02:45,423 --> 01:02:55,306
Because if you're driving down the street on any given day, and if anybody knows anything about Winthrop Street, when the sun is out in the morning, it's very, very hard to differentiate how the road is coming and the traffic.

773
01:02:55,606 --> 01:02:57,447
It's all enough, it's public safety going forward.

774
01:02:57,867 --> 01:03:07,610
So I would make a suggestion that that public, that speed bump, or what do you call it, the raised sidewalk, be painted in yellow, bright iridescent yellow, so people realize that they're coming up to that.

775
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:09,050
That's right in front of the church over there.

776
01:03:09,457 --> 01:03:19,241
On the motion of counselor marks as amended by counselor Penta, that the race crosswalk on Winthrop street be painted bright, iridescent yellow.

777
01:03:20,121 --> 01:03:21,242
They have special paint for that.

778
01:03:21,262 --> 01:03:21,942
Mr. President.

779
01:03:22,142 --> 01:03:22,542
There is.

780
01:03:23,683 --> 01:03:29,145
So on the motion for approval as amended, a roll call has been requested.

781
01:03:29,725 --> 01:03:32,566
Mr. Clerk, if you would please call the roll.

782
01:03:37,028 --> 01:03:37,108
So

783
01:03:39,795 --> 01:03:40,515
Councilor Caviello?

784
01:03:40,535 --> 01:03:40,615
Yes.

785
01:03:41,335 --> 01:03:41,856
Councilor Knight?

786
01:03:42,656 --> 01:03:42,776
Yes.

787
01:03:42,816 --> 01:03:43,656
Vice President Longo-Kern?

788
01:03:43,676 --> 01:03:43,736
Yes.

789
01:03:44,356 --> 01:03:44,816
Councilor Marks?

790
01:03:44,836 --> 01:03:44,917
Yes.

791
01:03:45,677 --> 01:03:46,157
Councilor Penta?

792
01:03:46,177 --> 01:03:46,277
Yes.

793
01:03:47,137 --> 01:03:47,757
President Del Rosso?

794
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:48,077
Yes.

795
01:03:48,117 --> 01:03:51,238
With a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes.

796
01:03:51,698 --> 01:03:54,119
A motion to Councilor Knight to revert back to the regular order of business.

797
01:03:54,139 --> 01:03:54,779
All those in favor?

798
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:55,920
All those opposed?

799
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:57,080
Motion carries.

800
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,881
Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

801
01:03:59,901 --> 01:04:01,501
15-802, petition by Jean M. Martin.

802
01:04:04,433 --> 01:04:14,439
10 Cummings Street, Medford, Mass., to speak to the council about hiring a building maintenance man for city-side buildings only, in parentheses, no schools.

803
01:04:15,319 --> 01:04:15,740
Good evening.

804
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:17,261
Please state your name and address for the record again.

805
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:17,881
Thank you.

806
01:04:17,901 --> 01:04:19,102
Jean Martin, 10 Cummings Street.

807
01:04:22,724 --> 01:04:27,286
Churchill said, those who fail to learn from the past are doomed to repeat it.

808
01:04:28,467 --> 01:04:33,250
If we do not take our city-side building maintenance seriously,

809
01:04:34,315 --> 01:04:40,576
They will undoubtedly fall into disrepair, as did the schools, the DPW, and currently the police station.

810
01:04:41,237 --> 01:04:54,440
Assuming that we put off tearing down and building out a 21st century public safety building, which I do not endorse forfeiting, we still need to insert a building maintenance budget for each city side building.

811
01:04:55,220 --> 01:05:01,881
The school side has a person in charge of school buildings and can identify the problems and priorities for the school side.

812
01:05:02,622 --> 01:05:04,162
We need the same on the city side.

813
01:05:04,885 --> 01:05:17,248
If we have the money to hire a public relations officer for the school side at the cost to the taxpayer of $85,000 a year, then we can afford a chief of maintenance for city-side buildings.

814
01:05:18,129 --> 01:05:20,929
We need a log of problems and schedule for their maintenance.

815
01:05:21,409 --> 01:05:27,351
We need a list of all city-owned buildings and inspections annually to identify their problems.

816
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:31,212
Whoever said you can't fight City Hall is wrong.

817
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:39,982
Local politicians do react to the populace when the populace makes its voice heard loud enough.

818
01:05:41,182 --> 01:05:47,185
When the parents come out in force, stadiums, the high school pool, and the technology labs are funded and built.

819
01:05:48,246 --> 01:05:52,008
The problem is the voice for city buildings are not loud enough.

820
01:05:53,268 --> 01:06:02,293
And for those who believe I am against the schools, note that I have spoken out against excessive spending on the city side, i.e., the garage,

821
01:06:02,878 --> 01:06:07,199
the Water Taxi, the Brooks Estates, and a whole new building for the arts community.

822
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:16,002
We will do well to save the two, quote, luxury buildings we have, which is the library and the Chevalier Auditorium.

823
01:06:17,382 --> 01:06:22,064
As for all other building structures, they are mandatory and need to be tended to.

824
01:06:23,784 --> 01:06:26,765
We could also look at street safety, i.e.

825
01:06:26,925 --> 01:06:29,986
crosswalk reflectors and underground infrastructure.

826
01:06:30,466 --> 01:06:32,087
And I say that because I was in Haines Square

827
01:06:32,682 --> 01:06:34,303
And everybody's coming in at the same time.

828
01:06:35,144 --> 01:06:39,627
And at night, at 5, 530, all you see is a flood of headlights.

829
01:06:40,007 --> 01:06:41,288
And you can't see the crosswalk.

830
01:06:41,368 --> 01:06:46,252
And you can't see a person crossing the crosswalk until they actually go in front of somebody's headlights.

831
01:06:47,072 --> 01:06:48,413
So it's very, very dangerous there.

832
01:06:49,754 --> 01:06:54,057
So we need to public safety of the sidewalks and all the rest of it.

833
01:06:54,878 --> 01:06:56,299
I'm ad nauseam.

834
01:06:56,339 --> 01:06:56,979
You know my story.

835
01:06:59,061 --> 01:07:00,061
This is not a luxury.

836
01:07:00,602 --> 01:07:02,123
This will cost you more in the end

837
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:03,872
unserviced.

838
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:09,036
I vote to take the PR money and put it towards a chief of city side maintenance.

839
01:07:09,516 --> 01:07:14,439
Keep in mind the building inspector is for the whole city, not just city buildings.

840
01:07:14,819 --> 01:07:23,024
So if you have the argument that we have a building inspector, well he's in the, or she or whatever, they, the two of them, are in charge of every single building.

841
01:07:23,464 --> 01:07:29,328
That means house, two families, single, buildings, condos, you name it, retail, commercial,

842
01:07:30,665 --> 01:07:49,740
The Brooks estates to the Craddock house or the Tufts house to the royal house to the school They're responsible for every building Okay, so we need a person specifically and I think mr. Marx was the one that brought this up a while back that we need somebody for the city side and Unfortunately to my friends over here.

843
01:07:50,161 --> 01:07:58,147
I respect their opinion, but the pie is only so big and unless you do a two and a half override the pie is only so big and so I

844
01:07:59,048 --> 01:08:13,762
While I've spoken out against excessive city side spending I'm not totally against the schools but the schools have gotten the lion's share lately and it really needs to be shifted so that the fire substations are maintained

845
01:08:14,112 --> 01:08:19,713
The police department, even if you don't tear it down, which I believe we should, it needs to be maintained.

846
01:08:20,753 --> 01:08:24,734
And the City Hall, hello, anybody?

847
01:08:26,234 --> 01:08:28,435
And so we need to have maintenance on the city side.

848
01:08:29,875 --> 01:08:40,957
For the library as well, because if you want to use it, you have to make sure it's maintainable, make sure that people can walk into the library without the ceiling falling in on them, which we know is behind and backlogged.

849
01:08:41,357 --> 01:08:43,418
So we need to take it and address all these situations.

850
01:08:43,758 --> 01:08:44,018
Thank you.

851
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:45,007
Thank you, Ms.

852
01:08:45,027 --> 01:08:45,367
Martin.

853
01:08:46,588 --> 01:08:47,028
Good evening.

854
01:08:47,108 --> 01:08:48,789
Please state your name and address for the record.

855
01:08:49,069 --> 01:08:49,829
Thank you, Andrew.

856
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:52,931
I will say this about that.

857
01:08:54,392 --> 01:08:56,452
Maintenance is obviously key.

858
01:08:57,453 --> 01:09:06,097
It's best to spend a couple hundred thousand dollars these days versus hundreds of millions of dollars to our sons and grandchildren.

859
01:09:09,893 --> 01:09:16,296
On the motion for receiving and placing on file by Councilor Camuso, all those in favor?

860
01:09:17,096 --> 01:09:17,837
All those opposed?

861
01:09:18,717 --> 01:09:19,557
Motion carries.

862
01:09:20,718 --> 01:09:27,221
On the motion of Councilor Knight to go on to suspension to take two condolences on the end of the clerk, all those in favor?

863
01:09:28,021 --> 01:09:28,742
All those opposed?

864
01:09:29,282 --> 01:09:30,002
Motion carries.

865
01:09:31,723 --> 01:09:38,046
Offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council extend its deep condolences and sympathy

866
01:09:38,503 --> 01:09:41,265
to the family of Rose Femineau on her recent passing.

867
01:09:42,166 --> 01:09:43,487
Mr. President, thank you very much.

868
01:09:44,328 --> 01:09:46,429
Many of us here in the city of Medford know the Femineau family.

869
01:09:46,489 --> 01:09:51,253
Rose was the mother of retired Medford police officer Frank Femineau, and she recently passed away.

870
01:09:52,114 --> 01:09:54,976
She's also the grandmother of Councilor Camuso's wife.

871
01:09:55,696 --> 01:10:01,381
And I offer my condolences to the family on their loss, and I'd ask my council colleagues to do the same, Mr. President.

872
01:10:03,505 --> 01:10:14,130
And in addition, offered by Councillors Camuso, Marks, and Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its condolences to the family of Joan Sacco-Sullivan, who passed away this morning.

873
01:10:14,871 --> 01:10:15,591
Councillor Camuso.

874
01:10:16,232 --> 01:10:17,112
Thank you, Mr. President.

875
01:10:17,312 --> 01:10:26,757
I'd just like to send our very sorrowful condolences to the family of Joan Sacco-Sullivan, who passed away this morning after a short

876
01:10:27,235 --> 01:10:30,376
but a very aggressive battle with pancreatic cancer.

877
01:10:31,257 --> 01:10:39,120
I had the pleasure of knowing Mrs. Sullivan since I was a little boy, growing up with her son, Greg, in West Medford, and just a real good family.

878
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:43,382
She's got wonderful children, and she'll be missed.

879
01:10:43,402 --> 01:10:53,126
You know, she was a school secretary for probably over 35 years, still assigned to the Columbus School up until the time she got sick, you know.

880
01:10:55,425 --> 01:11:06,271
just want to send her family our condolences and Thank them for her years of service to the children of this community in her 30 plus years with the method public schools Thank you.

881
01:11:06,291 --> 01:11:23,440
So if you'll all rise for a moment of silence Council commissioner

882
01:11:23,722 --> 01:11:24,883
Motion for suspension of the rules?

883
01:11:26,123 --> 01:11:28,145
Motion for suspension of the rules by Councillor Camuso.

884
01:11:28,165 --> 01:11:28,885
All those in favour?

885
01:11:29,545 --> 01:11:30,186
All those opposed?

886
01:11:30,826 --> 01:11:31,386
Motion carries.

887
01:11:31,427 --> 01:11:31,767
Councillor.

888
01:11:32,187 --> 01:11:33,027
Thank you, Mr. President.

889
01:11:33,748 --> 01:11:36,129
I'd like to just say thank you.

890
01:11:36,429 --> 01:11:44,514
I'm not going to put in an official resolve, but a thank you to Teamsters Local 25 and President Sean O'Brien and Vice President Stephen Self.

891
01:11:45,435 --> 01:11:52,699
Just this last week, a Medford family that is less fortunate received an entire van full of toys

892
01:11:53,705 --> 01:11:54,986
by the Teamsters Local 25.

893
01:11:55,687 --> 01:12:00,590
So if we could just send them a thanks, it's one of the many charitable events that they run each year.

894
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:04,033
So if we could send that to them on behalf of the Medford residents.

895
01:12:04,433 --> 01:12:12,159
So a motion of Councilor Camuso that this Teamsters Labor Organization be congratulated for their generosity to a family in need.

896
01:12:12,419 --> 01:12:13,239
Councilor Caravaglio.

897
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:15,521
While we're on the suspension, Mr. President.

898
01:12:15,801 --> 01:12:17,342
Let's take a, is this a separate matter?

899
01:12:17,943 --> 01:12:18,123
Yes.

900
01:12:18,977 --> 01:12:21,119
On the motion of Councillor Camuso, all those in favour?

901
01:12:21,559 --> 01:12:22,300
All those opposed?

902
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:23,481
Motion carries.

903
01:12:24,141 --> 01:12:24,862
Councillor Kavulon.

904
01:12:25,242 --> 01:12:31,047
While we're in suspension, if we could congratulate our council colleague on the birth of his son last week.

905
01:12:31,567 --> 01:12:36,171
Congratulations, Councillor Knight, father of another fine young man.

906
01:12:37,032 --> 01:12:37,392
His name?

907
01:12:40,048 --> 01:12:42,470
Brendan Patrick was born Wednesday evening, Mr. President.

908
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:46,053
He's happy, he's healthy, 7 pounds, 10 ounces, 21 inches long.

909
01:12:46,313 --> 01:12:53,058
We came home from the hospital Friday, and mother is doing well, son is doing well, son number one is doing well also.

910
01:12:53,179 --> 01:12:56,461
So thank you very much, Councilor Cavielle, for bringing this forward.

911
01:12:56,861 --> 01:12:59,183
I know my wife's probably sitting at home right now, very happy to hear it.

912
01:12:59,724 --> 01:13:03,026
And I apologize for not being able to attend last week's meeting.

913
01:13:03,126 --> 01:13:05,028
However, we had a couple of false alarms.

914
01:13:05,422 --> 01:13:08,825
that we needed to deal with over at the Winchester Hospital before the baby finally joined us.

915
01:13:08,965 --> 01:13:10,226
But thank you very much, Counselor.

916
01:13:10,366 --> 01:13:11,087
Congratulations.

917
01:13:12,088 --> 01:13:15,270
On the motion of approval by, on the motion of Counselor Caviello, all those in favor?

918
01:13:15,771 --> 01:13:16,431
All those opposed?

919
01:13:16,511 --> 01:13:17,072
Motion carries.

920
01:13:18,113 --> 01:13:24,418
The records, the records of the December 8th meeting were passed to Counselor Mox for his inspection.

921
01:13:32,182 --> 01:13:36,203
On the motion of Councilor Marks, how did you find those records?

922
01:13:38,223 --> 01:13:39,724
Motion to table, Mr. President.

923
01:13:40,004 --> 01:13:42,404
On the motion of Councilor Marks to table those records.

924
01:13:42,444 --> 01:13:43,145
