[SPEAKER_07]: Seven the affirmative, zero the negative.

50

[SPEAKER_07]: The rules are suspended to take 20648.

51
00:02:50,328 --> 00:02:53,272
[SPEAKER_07]: That was offered by Councilor Marks.

52
00:02:53,313 --> 00:02:56,798
[SPEAKER_07]: And this was to receive an update on municipal aggregation.

53
00:02:57,038 --> 00:02:58,100
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Marks?

54
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,421
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

55
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:07,326
[SPEAKER_18]: I put this on the agenda, Mr. President, it's been some time now since this council has approved municipal aggregation.

56
00:03:08,707 --> 00:03:17,993
[SPEAKER_18]: I've received a number of calls from residents that are pleased with the aggregation and other residents that are questioning why their bills are so high.

57
00:03:18,494 --> 00:03:23,097
[SPEAKER_18]: So I thought it was only appropriate now that we revisit the program.

58
00:03:23,977 --> 00:03:34,306
[SPEAKER_18]: see how the program is running, Mr. President, see if there's anything needed, maybe to update residents of this community, or if there's anything we can do as a community to improve the program.

59
00:03:34,386 --> 00:03:37,329
[SPEAKER_18]: So I believe we have Alicia Hunt on the phone.

60
00:03:37,369 --> 00:03:38,130
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, she is.

61
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,211
[SPEAKER_18]: On the Zoom.

62
00:03:40,231 --> 00:03:42,974
[SPEAKER_18]: So at this time, Mr. President, I will yield to Alicia.

63
00:03:43,274 --> 00:03:44,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we have Alicia Hunt with us.

64
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I've made her a co-host.

65
00:03:45,636 --> 00:03:50,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight, Alicia, you have been made a co-host, and you should be able to share your screen, and we thank you for being with us tonight.

66
00:03:51,826 --> 00:03:52,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

67
00:03:52,506 --> 00:03:56,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for asking for the presentation for the update this evening.

68
00:03:56,488 --> 00:04:03,451
[SPEAKER_11]: And I am now sharing my screen and hitting send.

69
00:04:08,153 --> 00:04:08,513
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

70
00:04:09,313 --> 00:04:14,215
[SPEAKER_11]: So I believe that you're now seeing the presentation on your screen.

71
00:04:14,256 --> 00:04:17,637
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you very much for having us this evening and asking for this update.

72
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,703
[SPEAKER_11]: I have with me this evening, John O'Rourke, our consultant from Good Energy.

73
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:23,964
[SPEAKER_11]: He's on the line as well.

74
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:36,453
[SPEAKER_11]: And Jay Marbaga from Green Energy Consumer Alliance that provides the additional green energy for this aggregation in case there are questions that are better suited for one of them to answer.

75
00:04:37,134 --> 00:04:42,258
[SPEAKER_11]: And I did ask John to help put the presentation together with these numbers.

76
00:04:43,058 --> 00:04:46,160
[SPEAKER_11]: So when this program launched in December,

77
00:04:47,568 --> 00:04:51,211
[SPEAKER_11]: 2019, there were 19,500 accounts eligible.

78
00:04:51,791 --> 00:05:05,620
[SPEAKER_11]: As you know, we did the opt-out letters and on the launch, 14,600 were automatically enrolled, indicating about 25% chose to opt out of the program before ever beginning.

79
00:05:06,901 --> 00:05:15,467
[SPEAKER_11]: So that you're aware, you may have been hearing from people who are new to the community in particular about this in the last month, and periodically once a year,

80
00:05:16,362 --> 00:05:23,127
[SPEAKER_11]: They do what's called a sweep, which is where they say, what are all the new accounts that are in Medford and National Grid that are eligible for this?

81
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:29,772
[SPEAKER_11]: It can also be accounts that were on their own secondary suppliers that are now back on basic service.

82
00:05:30,452 --> 00:05:36,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Those accounts, about 3,100 of them, got letters in October about the program.

83
00:05:36,657 --> 00:05:42,001
[SPEAKER_11]: They have the option to opt out now, or they will be automatically enrolled as well.

84
00:05:43,062 --> 00:05:46,444
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the exact same letter that everybody else got last winter.

85
00:05:48,046 --> 00:05:54,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Over the course of this, from month to month, people move in, they move out, they enroll, they choose to enroll.

86
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:58,653
[SPEAKER_11]: As you've heard, there are people who are choosing to enter, there are people who are choosing to opt out over the course of it.

87
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:09,339
[SPEAKER_11]: Over the course of the past 10 months, we've had a low of 12,400 people enrolled in households and a high of 15,900 enrolled.

88
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,425
[SPEAKER_11]: We also have, that is with 5% extra renewable energy.

89
00:06:14,885 --> 00:06:16,347
[SPEAKER_11]: People can opt down to the 0%.

90
00:06:16,427 --> 00:06:18,229
[SPEAKER_11]: We've had between 85 and 100 at any given time.

91
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:26,714
[SPEAKER_11]: at the 0% level, and they can opt up to 100% renewable energy.

92
00:06:27,214 --> 00:06:31,195
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've had between 65 and 80 households enrolled in that.

93
00:06:34,356 --> 00:06:37,257
[SPEAKER_11]: So the numbers, so our supplier is Dynergy.

94
00:06:37,477 --> 00:06:38,278
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the name.

95
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:42,639
[SPEAKER_11]: It shows up as Dynergy Medford Ag on people's bills.

96
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,720
[SPEAKER_11]: That's this program.

97
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,361
[SPEAKER_11]: This is running through December, 2022.

98
00:06:49,586 --> 00:06:58,550
[SPEAKER_11]: over the course of the program from last December to now, the on average per account, they have actually lost $4.

99
00:06:59,911 --> 00:07:02,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Not per month, over the entire 10 months.

100
00:07:03,652 --> 00:07:10,516
[SPEAKER_11]: The current rate, our rate over the entire time, it never changes, is 11.507 cents per kilowatt hour.

101
00:07:14,177 --> 00:07:20,219
[SPEAKER_11]: The current national grid rate that just started in November is 12.388 cents.

102
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:34,525
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you were to ask for this presentation in April, I can guarantee that people will on average see a savings because everybody enrolled in the program right now will be saving money between now and April.

103
00:07:35,065 --> 00:07:37,146
[SPEAKER_11]: The rates will again change next April.

104
00:07:37,646 --> 00:07:39,847
[SPEAKER_11]: And this graph basically shows that.

105
00:07:40,455 --> 00:07:45,617
[SPEAKER_11]: The green line is the cost to everybody who is in the 100% renewable.

106
00:07:46,577 --> 00:07:52,959
[SPEAKER_11]: The blue line is the people who are in our default program, the local green.

107
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,241
[SPEAKER_11]: The gray line is the cost to everybody enrolled in the basic service.

108
00:07:59,142 --> 00:08:00,302
[SPEAKER_11]: And the yellow line

109
00:08:00,823 --> 00:08:04,926
[SPEAKER_11]: shows the national grid rate over each month.

110
00:08:05,426 --> 00:08:09,729
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we are actually right about here in November.

111
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:12,410
[SPEAKER_11]: People have just started to get their November bills.

112
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:18,394
[SPEAKER_11]: If they're on basic service, their rate has gone back up to over 12 cents a kilowatt hour.

113
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:23,658
[SPEAKER_11]: And if they're on our service, their rate is staying steady at the 11 cents.

114
00:08:28,052 --> 00:08:39,297
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the main reasons for, one of the reasons for doing this besides price stability was adding extra renewable energy into people's, into what we as a community are buying in Massachusetts.

115
00:08:40,097 --> 00:08:47,220
[SPEAKER_11]: So, so far to date, Medford residents have account for 3,671,000 extra kilowatt hours.

116
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:47,600
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's 253

117
00:08:53,858 --> 00:09:04,602
[SPEAKER_11]: kilowatt hours per account, but it's 3,600 megawatts for the entire community for the course of the program so far.

118
00:09:04,782 --> 00:09:08,283
[SPEAKER_11]: And to remind you, we buy renewable energy certificates.

119
00:09:08,743 --> 00:09:11,724
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a massive, it's a New England local green.

120
00:09:12,224 --> 00:09:16,385
[SPEAKER_11]: So everything, all the renewable energy bought for this is local.

121
00:09:17,326 --> 00:09:19,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Aggregations typically start around 5% as we did.

122
00:09:21,403 --> 00:09:25,486
[SPEAKER_11]: And I will tell you that Brookline and Newton are outliers.

123
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:29,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Brookline started at 30% extra renewable energy and Newton at 46.

124
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:42,176
[SPEAKER_11]: What we expect to contribute to the grid over the course of a year is the equivalent to 1,000 homes doing 100% renewable energy.

125
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:46,439
[SPEAKER_11]: This is where the renewable energy is coming from.

126
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:49,381
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can make these slides available if anybody wants to look

127
00:09:49,897 --> 00:09:58,739
[SPEAKER_11]: closely on the other thing that I thought was worthy of showing you was actually who's doing aggregation in Massachusetts and who's doing green aggregation.

128
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:09,462
[SPEAKER_11]: So on this slide, all the communities that are brown are doing municipal aggregation with no extra renewable energy.

129
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:18,924
[SPEAKER_11]: All the ones that are green of any shade are doing municipal aggregation with some amount of extra green.

130
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:25,667
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can see those very dark green colors here, communities that are doing a lot of extra renewable.

131
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:27,327
[SPEAKER_11]: We're down in here.

132
00:10:28,688 --> 00:10:37,111
[SPEAKER_11]: And the ones that are in blue are actually communities that are in the process of starting up an aggregation, but it isn't complete yet.

133
00:10:37,191 --> 00:10:44,533
[SPEAKER_11]: They're somewhere in the regulatory process, but they have not actually started their program.

134
00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:47,485
[SPEAKER_11]: That is what I prepared for you this evening.

135
00:10:47,665 --> 00:10:52,447
[SPEAKER_11]: And then John and Jayma and I are here available to answer questions.

136
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:55,067
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll share.

137
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:55,687
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President.

138
00:10:55,907 --> 00:10:57,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the presentation.

139
00:10:58,008 --> 00:10:58,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Counselor Marks.

140
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,288
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

141
00:11:00,308 --> 00:11:02,949
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to thank Alicia for her presentation.

142
00:11:02,989 --> 00:11:04,389
[SPEAKER_18]: That was very helpful.

143
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:10,870
[SPEAKER_18]: I would ask that while this program goes forward, that we receive quarterly updates.

144
00:11:11,391 --> 00:11:12,991
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that would be extremely helpful.

145
00:11:13,931 --> 00:11:19,313
[SPEAKER_18]: Alicia, my question to you is, just so we're comparing apples with apples.

146
00:11:20,273 --> 00:11:34,397
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm trying to compare someone that opted out of the program, that stayed on National Grid, compared to if they were to go on to the program for the same period of time with DiEnergy.

147
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,959
[SPEAKER_18]: And you're saying to me the average difference over a period of time is $0.04?

148
00:11:44,426 --> 00:11:47,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, that's not me unmuted.

149
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:50,050
[SPEAKER_11]: The average is $4.

150
00:11:50,490 --> 00:12:03,701
[SPEAKER_11]: If they, so the average resident over the course of the 10 months has not saved, I guess you would say has paid $4 more than if they had not been on the program.

151
00:12:05,162 --> 00:12:05,482
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

152
00:12:05,682 --> 00:12:07,444
[SPEAKER_18]: So, so that's an average.

153
00:12:07,904 --> 00:12:08,965
[SPEAKER_18]: So, so that's an average.

154
00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:11,567
[SPEAKER_18]: So naturally there are some residents that paid less than $4.

155
00:12:14,008 --> 00:12:15,537
[SPEAKER_18]: And some that paid more than four.

156
00:12:15,598 --> 00:12:16,866
[SPEAKER_18]: Do we know how much more than four?

157
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:32,099
[SPEAKER_11]: It would depend significantly on whether they spent, they used a lot of their electricity during the summer or whether they used their electricity in the fall or winter.

158
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:39,743
[SPEAKER_11]: If they used it in the fall or spring, like last spring before April, then they would have saved more.

159
00:12:40,644 --> 00:12:44,486
[SPEAKER_11]: It's because, and you know what, maybe I should just show this graph again.

160
00:12:44,506 --> 00:12:48,268
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that this graph is the most helpful.

161
00:12:58,237 --> 00:13:03,341
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are here in this point of time.

162
00:13:04,022 --> 00:13:16,853
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can see that in this window, so January, February, March, April, everybody enrolled in the aggregation, they did good amount of money because they paid this blue line instead of at this yellow line.

163
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:24,075
[SPEAKER_11]: And then over the summer, National Grid's rate was, in fact, lower than our aggregation.

164
00:13:24,475 --> 00:13:30,020
[SPEAKER_11]: So people were paying more if they were on the aggregation than they were with National Grid.

165
00:13:30,621 --> 00:13:42,691
[SPEAKER_11]: And when we look at how it balanced out over the course of the year, this works out to being having paid $4 more as of right now in November.

166
00:13:43,412 --> 00:13:45,934
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now, we know, going forward,

167
00:13:46,842 --> 00:13:50,143
[SPEAKER_11]: they will pay less than if they're on National Grid.

168
00:13:50,443 --> 00:13:54,725
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would strongly advise people stay on it now, right now this winter.

169
00:13:54,905 --> 00:13:56,626
[SPEAKER_11]: You are saving money this winter.

170
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,947
[SPEAKER_11]: What we cannot guarantee is this chart ends April, 2021.

171
00:14:01,527 --> 00:14:04,569
[SPEAKER_11]: That's because that is when National Grid's rate changes again.

172
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:07,750
[SPEAKER_11]: And most likely it will drop.

173
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,410
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't know how much it will drop.

174
00:14:10,251 --> 00:14:11,011
[SPEAKER_11]: Depends on the market.

175
00:14:11,954 --> 00:14:15,337
[SPEAKER_18]: So just fill me in because it's been some time, Alicia.

176
00:14:16,598 --> 00:14:29,430
[SPEAKER_18]: If I opted out of the program and someone that's currently in the program wants to go back and forth, how easy is it to go back and forth, opt in and opt out of the program?

177
00:14:31,258 --> 00:14:34,840
[SPEAKER_11]: So by policy, you're allowed to leave at any time.

178
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:46,845
[SPEAKER_11]: What you're not allowed to do by policy is to leave the program, come back in in April, like stay in now, leave in April, come back in November, and to map it.

179
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,707
[SPEAKER_11]: Whether you would get kicked out of the program, that's not

180
00:14:51,628 --> 00:14:53,829
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not monitoring accounts that closely.

181
00:14:54,210 --> 00:15:08,799
[SPEAKER_11]: However, if there was suddenly 50% of Medford's accounts dropped in November, or dropped in April, and then tried to re-enroll in November, the company would contact us and say, we think you're in violation of your contract terms.

182
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:16,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it would imply that we were coaching people to leave and to come back in, and to basically do that term.

183
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:18,725
[SPEAKER_11]: If an individual did it,

184
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:24,707
[SPEAKER_11]: nobody is going to be monitoring it that closely to find that.

185
00:15:25,127 --> 00:15:26,227
[SPEAKER_11]: So people could leave.

186
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:28,348
[SPEAKER_11]: They can choose to leave at any time.

187
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:41,852
[SPEAKER_11]: In theory, they would be able to re-enroll, but I can't guarantee that Dynagy would not just block their account saying, you can't just come and go when the rates are most appealing.

188
00:15:42,745 --> 00:15:46,686
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, so from what you're telling me, that was going to be my other question.

189
00:15:47,226 --> 00:15:52,127
[SPEAKER_18]: As a community, we're not allowed to advise our residents as you just stated.

190
00:15:52,748 --> 00:16:02,510
[SPEAKER_18]: You said, jeez, if everyone's in the program now, I would ask you to stay in the program because the contractor's rates are going to be far better than national grid's rates.

191
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,291
[SPEAKER_18]: So what you did was just advise people to stay in.

192
00:16:07,111 --> 00:16:10,452
[SPEAKER_18]: And you're saying that's something that we really shouldn't be doing as a community?

193
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:16,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, what I can't do is tell them to leave in April, come back in November.

194
00:16:17,033 --> 00:16:22,315
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be against our terms with the agreement.

195
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:25,275
[SPEAKER_11]: If we were saying this, it's OK, everybody, it's time to leave.

196
00:16:25,295 --> 00:16:26,936
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, it's time to rejoin.

197
00:16:27,616 --> 00:16:36,618
[SPEAKER_11]: I am just saying that right now, people should look at these differences and see that they're saving money for the next six months.

198
00:16:37,426 --> 00:16:42,728
[SPEAKER_18]: So how would one, when you say, look at these differences, I realize you're showing us the presentation now.

199
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:49,651
[SPEAKER_18]: How would one know this to actually take advantage?

200
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:57,755
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have a website medfordcea.org.

201
00:16:57,995 --> 00:17:02,757
[SPEAKER_11]: It's medfordcommunityenergyaggregation.org.

202
00:17:03,317 --> 00:17:05,078
[SPEAKER_11]: And on it, on the main page,

203
00:17:05,605 --> 00:17:09,967
[SPEAKER_11]: we actually post national grids rate at any given time.

204
00:17:10,448 --> 00:17:12,549
[SPEAKER_11]: So they don't have to go hunting for it.

205
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:19,652
[SPEAKER_11]: They can go to our site and it is linked off of the city's energy and environment sites, the municipal aggregation page.

206
00:17:20,032 --> 00:17:20,373
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

207
00:17:20,853 --> 00:17:23,094
[SPEAKER_18]: Do we provide a chart similar to this?

208
00:17:23,114 --> 00:17:28,497
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we just say, here's what the national grid rate is right now.

209
00:17:28,897 --> 00:17:34,680
[SPEAKER_11]: If you had gone to that page over the summer, it would have told you that national grids rate was lower than our rate.

210
00:17:35,936 --> 00:17:41,523
[SPEAKER_18]: So do you think we would be in violation if we were to share this particular graph with residents?

211
00:17:42,824 --> 00:17:46,509
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is fine because this is also speaking to what has happened in the past.

212
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:57,106
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, and the reason why I say it is, and the reason why I think it's important to give quarterly updates, is that we have consultants that are working on this.

213
00:17:57,706 --> 00:18:08,013
[SPEAKER_18]: And why not be able to benefit from their knowledge to spread that out to the community to allow them to make an informed decision whether they want to come and go from a program.

214
00:18:08,493 --> 00:18:12,556
[SPEAKER_18]: And I can appreciate the fact that our numbers are based on enrollment, right?

215
00:18:12,616 --> 00:18:17,319
[SPEAKER_18]: Because if the numbers drop too low, we're probably not going to get the same rate, correct?

216
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:22,481
[SPEAKER_11]: So our rate is locked in until December 2022.

217
00:18:23,181 --> 00:18:28,064
[SPEAKER_11]: That will not change even if people should leave the aggregation.

218
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:47,097
[SPEAKER_11]: It would cause us trouble if we then tried to reap in December when we were getting ready for that time to get a new contract and we had had people leaving and joining, we might have a very hard time getting a new contract, getting a new rate, a favorable rate.

219
00:18:47,813 --> 00:18:47,993
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

220
00:18:48,633 --> 00:18:52,575
[SPEAKER_18]: So for the time being, I didn't know we were locked in until 2022.

221
00:18:53,615 --> 00:18:54,815
[SPEAKER_18]: And it doesn't matter.

222
00:18:55,336 --> 00:19:03,498
[SPEAKER_18]: Enrollment doesn't matter for that period of time, which is great news for us, because there's no bottom line on that.

223
00:19:04,639 --> 00:19:13,902
[SPEAKER_18]: So my question again is, why aren't we promoting this as a program to show when the best time to get on and off the program is?

224
00:19:15,082 --> 00:19:16,683
[SPEAKER_18]: You're saying we can't do that legally?

225
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:27,447
[SPEAKER_11]: I may ask John O'Rourke, who is our advisor from Good Energy, to actually speak to the contract terms.

226
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:30,630
[SPEAKER_11]: He also works with a lot of different communities, so he can tell us.

227
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:34,854
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't I have him actually answer that, and I will stop sharing.

228
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:41,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Patricia, and thank you, Councilors, for allowing us to come before you tonight.

229
00:19:42,562 --> 00:19:43,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly,

230
00:19:44,314 --> 00:19:53,582
[SPEAKER_02]: What we try to do in these programs is to get maximum participation and to have people stay in the program for the whole term.

231
00:19:54,682 --> 00:20:02,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone in the program is free to get out of the program whenever they want without the penalty or termination fee.

232
00:20:03,306 --> 00:20:05,268
[SPEAKER_02]: they can come back into the program.

233
00:20:06,449 --> 00:20:18,679
[SPEAKER_02]: If the supplier sees that people are coming back and forth, gaming the system, so to speak, they have a choice of not allowing them to come back in if that happens too much.

234
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,541
[SPEAKER_02]: But essentially, we don't find that happens.

235
00:20:23,283 --> 00:20:26,765
[SPEAKER_02]: We find that once people get into the program, they want to stay in the program.

236
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:32,210
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the Medford aggregation,

237
00:20:32,624 --> 00:20:49,651
[SPEAKER_02]: The most important point of this aggregation is the fact that the residents have put an extra 3.6 million kilowatt hours of renewable energy into the grid.

238
00:20:51,389 --> 00:20:56,950
[SPEAKER_02]: for a total of $4 each, which comes out to a little more than a penny a day.

239
00:20:57,651 --> 00:21:03,452
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially what they're doing for the environment for a penny a day is absolutely outstanding.

240
00:21:06,973 --> 00:21:12,835
[SPEAKER_18]: So when you say that number, how does that compare to prior to aggregation?

241
00:21:13,835 --> 00:21:18,336
[SPEAKER_18]: Because anyone could have opted for green options prior to aggregation, correct?

242
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,233
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't quite question council.

243
00:21:24,654 --> 00:21:27,718
[SPEAKER_18]: So you mentioned 3.6 million, correct?

244
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:29,040
[SPEAKER_18]: That's correct.

245
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,062
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's what you said.

246
00:21:31,443 --> 00:21:34,026
[SPEAKER_18]: Additional 3.6 million with aggregation.

247
00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:38,932
[SPEAKER_18]: Prior to aggregation, where were we as a community?

248
00:21:38,972 --> 00:21:39,974
[SPEAKER_18]: Do we know those numbers?

249
00:21:41,991 --> 00:21:48,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, essentially, before aggregation, everybody was on the basic service of a national grid.

250
00:21:49,995 --> 00:22:01,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly, this $3.6 million is additional during that 10-month period starting in January of this year and ending in October.

251
00:22:02,222 --> 00:22:06,865
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is a substantial amount of extra renewable energy.

252
00:22:07,545 --> 00:22:10,727
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that Jema, do you want to chime in here?

253
00:22:11,691 --> 00:22:22,400
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, just if I could, so prior to municipal aggregation, I'm under the impression that people were allowed to get additional green energy if they opted to.

254
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:30,567
[SPEAKER_18]: So before municipal energy came into, aggregation came into the community, there were people buying green energy.

255
00:22:31,944 --> 00:22:32,825
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that not correct?

256
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:37,569
[SPEAKER_02]: People have a choice to go out on their own and to buy green energy.

257
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,832
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't, we don't know what that figure is.

258
00:22:39,852 --> 00:22:44,336
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to get this volume of green energy without an aggregation.

259
00:22:45,437 --> 00:22:45,697
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

260
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:48,200
[SPEAKER_18]: And we don't know what that figure was then in our community.

261
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:54,766
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I think, Jayma, because most people would have, um,

262
00:22:55,363 --> 00:23:00,184
[SPEAKER_11]: done it through Green Energy Consumer Alliance, formerly known as Mass Energy Consumer Alliance.

263
00:23:00,224 --> 00:23:11,507
[SPEAKER_11]: So we were just asking her if she actually knew how many Medford residents were enrolled with them before the aggregation or what their annual green energy buy was.

264
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:14,127
[SPEAKER_09]: So hello, good evening.

265
00:23:14,467 --> 00:23:16,728
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Jennifer Green Energy Consumers Alliance.

266
00:23:17,608 --> 00:23:20,769
[SPEAKER_09]: So before the aggregation program started, we had about

267
00:23:21,671 --> 00:23:29,614
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe it was 120 members in Medford who were doing 100% green with the program.

268
00:23:30,395 --> 00:23:31,755
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, that's 100% green.

269
00:23:31,795 --> 00:23:34,196
[SPEAKER_09]: We have the options for 25% or 100%.

270
00:23:36,717 --> 00:23:40,799
[SPEAKER_09]: So for those, you can tell that now with the engagement, now there's less.

271
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:45,341
[SPEAKER_09]: There's about 75 people that have decided to be in the 100% option.

272
00:23:45,941 --> 00:23:50,523
[SPEAKER_09]: So they both have an additional charge for the bills.

273
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:57,965
[SPEAKER_09]: So through Green Energy Consumers Alliance, right now, the charge is going to be 3.2 cents per kilowatt hour.

274
00:23:59,406 --> 00:24:06,352
[SPEAKER_09]: For the city of Medford, the aggregation contract works that we look at the term of the contract and we see what the market is doing.

275
00:24:07,067 --> 00:24:18,789
[SPEAKER_09]: And so for the whole community, for Medford, you're actually at 3.3 cents per kilowatt hour, which is a little bit higher because you're buying larger volume when the market is much higher.

276
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:24,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, if you go into the open market, you're gonna have to be paying about 4.2 cents per kilowatt hour.

277
00:24:24,991 --> 00:24:27,291
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're still getting a discount compared to the market.

278
00:24:30,132 --> 00:24:35,533
[SPEAKER_18]: So, Mr. President, I'd like to make a motion at this point that the city

279
00:24:38,241 --> 00:24:40,723
[SPEAKER_18]: interact with our rate payers.

280
00:24:41,744 --> 00:24:54,632
[SPEAKER_18]: And our city provide information relative to, like we've seen the chart tonight, relative to where the market is and where the rates are over a given span of time.

281
00:24:55,153 --> 00:24:58,175
[SPEAKER_18]: So people are allowed to make informed decisions, Mr. President.

282
00:24:58,895 --> 00:25:04,097
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would ask that that be part of the website and part of any type of outreach.

283
00:25:04,777 --> 00:25:07,517
[SPEAKER_18]: I have yet to see any outreach since December 2019.

284
00:25:08,178 --> 00:25:16,800
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not to say it hasn't happened, but I have yet to see any outreach letting the community know where we stand with municipal aggregation.

285
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,501
[SPEAKER_18]: This was a very large endeavor when we instituted this.

286
00:25:22,322 --> 00:25:25,703
[SPEAKER_18]: And I find it ironic that

287
00:25:27,463 --> 00:25:29,608
[SPEAKER_18]: You need a buy-in into the program, right?

288
00:25:29,889 --> 00:25:32,736
[SPEAKER_18]: They're saying, well, look how many of these people signed up for the program.

289
00:25:32,776 --> 00:25:34,339
[SPEAKER_18]: But this was an opt.

290
00:25:35,305 --> 00:25:40,709
[SPEAKER_18]: You had to opt out of the program, so everyone was automatically opt into the program.

291
00:25:41,229 --> 00:25:47,674
[SPEAKER_18]: So if it wasn't for the legislation that allowed for that, Mr. President, the numbers may not be this large.

292
00:25:48,134 --> 00:25:59,422
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think the program started off with the ability to have everyone automatically enrolled and then those that wanted to get out of it, which is a little different than

293
00:25:59,802 --> 00:26:06,565
[SPEAKER_18]: the way I would personally handle it, but that's how the state legislature decided to implement this program.

294
00:26:07,285 --> 00:26:23,332
[SPEAKER_18]: But I would ask that as a community, Mr. President, that we do a better job notifying residents where we stand from quarter to quarter or maybe six month period, whatever Alicia feels would be beneficial to our residents.

295
00:26:23,813 --> 00:26:28,815
[SPEAKER_18]: So they can make informed decisions when they want to opt in and opt out.

296
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:48,985
[SPEAKER_18]: And the other point, Mr. President, is if when this contract does end in 2022, that maybe they can put an ending period where they stop providing that information, maybe three or six months prior to the end of the contract, because you don't want the volatility.

297
00:26:49,005 --> 00:26:53,467
[SPEAKER_18]: I can see that with people coming in and out of it towards the end of the contract.

298
00:26:53,527 --> 00:26:56,909
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President.

299
00:26:57,209 --> 00:26:58,910
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't seem to me that that would be

300
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:08,219
[SPEAKER_18]: a violation of the contract, just updating our residents and alerting them when the best time to be on municipal aggregation in the interest of their pocketbook.

301
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:15,285
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, Mr. President, if I could, the residents that I heard from, I didn't see any of their bills.

302
00:27:15,826 --> 00:27:20,130
[SPEAKER_18]: But some of the information I was receiving was not $4 for

303
00:27:23,153 --> 00:27:25,775
[SPEAKER_18]: It was far more than that that they were paying.

304
00:27:26,235 --> 00:27:37,065
[SPEAKER_18]: And I didn't do a real deep dive into it, but some of them were hundreds of dollars that they feel that they were paying more with this new municipal aggregation compared to last year.

305
00:27:37,746 --> 00:27:41,589
[SPEAKER_18]: And it could be a change in, maybe they did use more air conditioning.

306
00:27:41,969 --> 00:27:45,653
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, I didn't do a deep dive, but there were many residents that did reach out.

307
00:27:46,393 --> 00:27:50,874
[SPEAKER_18]: because I was vocal with municipal aggregation, asking why their bill was that much higher.

308
00:27:51,554 --> 00:27:53,995
[SPEAKER_18]: And it wasn't $4, it was a lot more than $4.

309
00:27:55,415 --> 00:27:56,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

310
00:27:57,416 --> 00:27:59,076
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Councilor Marks, actually.

311
00:27:59,936 --> 00:28:09,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor, if you don't mind, we actually, we heard from a lot of residents as well, and we could perhaps provide some information now that would be beneficial to everybody.

312
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:13,380
[SPEAKER_11]: I think John would like to share some of that, or I could.

313
00:28:16,064 --> 00:28:17,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Alicia.

314
00:28:17,745 --> 00:28:26,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks, at any time any of your residents have questions on the bills, they can email them to me and I'll be glad to explain it to them.

315
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:33,834
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times residents don't know why they're paying more money in a particular month.

316
00:28:34,454 --> 00:28:43,239
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times it's because they've used a little more electricity, but I'm always available to answer questions from anyone who has a question on their bill.

317
00:28:44,943 --> 00:28:47,605
[SPEAKER_18]: John, can you provide us with your contact information?

318
00:28:51,006 --> 00:28:53,188
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at the end of these slides.

319
00:28:55,449 --> 00:28:58,971
[SPEAKER_11]: I will, I can put it in the chat for now.

320
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:11,258
[SPEAKER_11]: I will tell you that also my office received a number of inquiries and we've also asked residents to send us their slides, sorry, their bills.

321
00:29:11,498 --> 00:29:14,460
[SPEAKER_11]: And we are also able to look at them and give them

322
00:29:16,775 --> 00:29:20,396
[SPEAKER_11]: on their energy bills and to help them understand.

323
00:29:20,416 --> 00:29:27,619
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of people honestly didn't really realize how much of a difference being home all summer would make to their energy bills.

324
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:38,823
[SPEAKER_11]: And as an aside, their water bills, which we've actually counseled a number of people on that their usage in both electricity and water has gone up dramatically this summer compared to previous years.

325
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:44,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia, if I could add another point to that.

326
00:29:45,843 --> 00:29:54,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Many times we look at residents' bills and they think they're part of the aggregation, but they're not part of the aggregation.

327
00:29:54,590 --> 00:30:00,014
[SPEAKER_02]: They're with a third-party supplier who has really bumped up their rate to a

328
00:30:01,575 --> 00:30:02,476
[SPEAKER_02]: horrendous level.

329
00:30:03,196 --> 00:30:06,559
[SPEAKER_02]: So we find a lot of that, especially with the older residents.

330
00:30:07,419 --> 00:30:11,022
[SPEAKER_02]: They should never give out their account number over the phone.

331
00:30:11,962 --> 00:30:15,384
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, frequently what will happen is that they'll get a phone call.

332
00:30:15,925 --> 00:30:22,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody will say to them, you know, I think you will qualify for this particular discount program.

333
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,171
[SPEAKER_02]: All we need to know is your account number.

334
00:30:26,196 --> 00:30:34,602
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that person gives out their account number, they'll never hear from that salesperson again, but their account gets switched over.

335
00:30:34,982 --> 00:30:39,886
[SPEAKER_02]: So very often, people who think they're in the aggregation are really not.

336
00:30:40,446 --> 00:30:42,248
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we want to see their bills.

337
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

338
00:30:47,602 --> 00:30:49,204
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, so thank you very much.

339
00:30:50,606 --> 00:30:54,252
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, Clerk Hervez, could you read back the motion?

340
00:30:54,432 --> 00:30:55,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Just make sure we have it correctly.

341
00:30:55,734 --> 00:30:56,796
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two amendments.

342
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:17,066
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one amendment from Councilor Marks requesting quarterly updates on the program, and there's a second amendment from Councilor Marks requesting that the city interact with rate payers and that the city provide information relative to where the market is and where the rates are so that people can make an informed decision.

343
00:31:17,587 --> 00:31:20,809
[SPEAKER_18]: By way of that graph that was presented to us, that was extremely helpful.

344
00:31:20,829 --> 00:31:26,054
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it's somewhat easy to look at and make a determination.

345
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:33,233
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, Alicia, would it be possible to forward a copy of that presentation to the council?

346
00:31:34,634 --> 00:31:35,455
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to.

347
00:31:35,675 --> 00:31:36,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

348
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,757
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll do that after.

349
00:31:37,777 --> 00:31:37,857
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

350
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:39,999
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a number of councilors that have questions about this.

351
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:41,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks, you're all set.

352
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:41,820
[SPEAKER_18]: I am all set.

353
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

354
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:42,341
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

355
00:31:42,361 --> 00:31:43,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

356
00:31:43,642 --> 00:31:44,703
[SPEAKER_07]: The clerk has your amendments.

357
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:45,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

358
00:31:45,623 --> 00:31:49,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Up next, we have Councilor Behrs, then Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Morrell.

359
00:31:50,448 --> 00:31:51,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Behrs.

360
00:31:51,308 --> 00:31:52,329
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

361
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to our presenters as well.

362
00:31:57,453 --> 00:31:58,074
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, I think

363
00:31:58,401 --> 00:32:00,443
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows the success of the program.

364
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:04,347
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the first thing it shows is that most people just pay their electric bill.

365
00:32:04,827 --> 00:32:16,419
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this sense, we are getting a significant benefit of renewable energy for, obviously, it's an average, but for an average of a pretty low cost of $4 over 10 months.

366
00:32:20,131 --> 00:32:33,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Even with this added level of cost of $4, we're getting an environmental benefit that if you multiplied the kilowatt hours by the environmental cost of fossil fuels, I think we'd find that number to be very high compared to $4.

367
00:32:35,777 --> 00:32:38,158
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also impressed, if you looked at that chart,

368
00:32:38,722 --> 00:32:49,727
[SPEAKER_00]: The initial national grid rate for the first four months of this period was almost as much as what residents would get under the 100% renewable rate that is offered by the city through the aggregation program.

369
00:32:49,787 --> 00:32:53,388
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that bodes well for the future and the future of renewable energy.

370
00:32:54,609 --> 00:33:06,434
[SPEAKER_00]: My one question is, would it be possible, and obviously I know we're under contract till 2022, but looking at a future contract, would it be possible to add an additional renewable energy

371
00:33:08,034 --> 00:33:09,595
[SPEAKER_00]: the 5% renewable to another number.

372
00:33:09,615 --> 00:33:13,358
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of communities have increased that to 10% as a base number in their second round.

373
00:33:13,378 --> 00:33:13,498
[SPEAKER_00]: It is

374
00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:42,896
[SPEAKER_11]: But we were concerned about it being confusing and how confusing the program would be.

375
00:33:43,036 --> 00:33:48,322
[SPEAKER_11]: So for the first round in this community, we tried to make the options as straightforward as possible.

376
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:51,383
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.

377
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:53,325
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a good point here, too.

378
00:33:53,745 --> 00:33:59,330
[SPEAKER_00]: We're offering more choices than we've offered before and offering options to residents to make those informed decisions.

379
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:05,075
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do want to just note from the data you presented, most people are going with the default.

380
00:34:05,695 --> 00:34:09,058
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was true before when the rates were jumping around every few months.

381
00:34:09,078 --> 00:34:11,701
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's true now with the more consistent aggregation.

382
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:20,747
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what we can do collectively, as this shows, is more powerful than what any of us can do individually.

383
00:34:20,827 --> 00:34:26,113
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that we can continue to support this program and make it even more successful in the future.

384
00:34:26,713 --> 00:34:27,955
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

385
00:34:28,756 --> 00:34:29,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

386
00:34:29,897 --> 00:34:30,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarapelli.

387
00:34:31,851 --> 00:34:33,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President and Lee Sharon.

388
00:34:34,254 --> 00:34:35,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for all your hard work.

389
00:34:35,715 --> 00:34:43,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how you run two city major departments and still have the time to do anything else, so I appreciate that.

390
00:34:44,486 --> 00:34:48,350
[SPEAKER_03]: What I do have is I know that one of the questions I had were the people that

391
00:34:49,652 --> 00:34:53,633
[SPEAKER_03]: were already purchasing their own kilowatts.

392
00:34:54,334 --> 00:35:02,317
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can see the benefits with what the impact is to our community, how important it is.

393
00:35:03,377 --> 00:35:05,198
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that, is there a way?

394
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:26,863
[SPEAKER_03]: that we can educate those people, like Mr. O'Rourke said, that a lot of these people that I've talked to, I've asked them to look at their bill, and I think that they might have purchased Zoom Energy, for instance, and their year expired, and then it goes up, back up to National Grid's kilowatt price.

395
00:35:26,923 --> 00:35:35,605
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's what, is there a possible way to add, put something on our site to also educate the people that

396
00:35:36,746 --> 00:35:43,189
[SPEAKER_03]: have purchased several kilowatts through a third party, that's one thing.

397
00:35:43,229 --> 00:35:56,117
[SPEAKER_03]: And the second thing is, is there an option or how is the process, is it if you are purchasing your electricity from a third party or you negotiated yourself.

398
00:35:57,138 --> 00:36:02,060
[SPEAKER_03]: And that contract, what you've seen as I'm talking to some people is that they're forgetting that it's expiring.

399
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:14,733
[SPEAKER_03]: does that, could that automatically be picked up by the energy aggregation process or is there a, is there a time in between that like sort of a grace period?

400
00:36:16,814 --> 00:36:17,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

401
00:36:17,895 --> 00:36:28,980
[SPEAKER_11]: The, um, so people who were on a secondary supplier, as you mentioned, and they expire off of it, they do get what the term is called swept once a year.

402
00:36:29,501 --> 00:36:43,910
[SPEAKER_11]: So the 3,100 residents who are getting letters right now about the aggregation and the opt-out, that includes anybody who came off of a secondary supplier and went back to the national grid default rate.

403
00:36:44,752 --> 00:36:47,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so and I think Mr. O'Rourke made a good point.

404
00:36:48,094 --> 00:37:02,220
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that educating all of the people in our community, and I think that might help us land more people that were purchasing their own kilowatt energy that this is, they're then.

405
00:37:04,232 --> 00:37:10,579
[SPEAKER_03]: added on to national grids energy, is there something we could put on our site to educate them?

406
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:26,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's important because the benefit is a lower price, but these are the issues and concerns that if they're not thorough with this, that they're going to, you could save money for 12 months and then all of a sudden realize you're not

407
00:37:26,936 --> 00:37:27,316
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not.

408
00:37:27,376 --> 00:37:33,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're paying the top fee and, uh, top and all the money you saved, you've lost.

409
00:37:34,098 --> 00:37:41,860
[SPEAKER_03]: So there might be, you know, way to capture some, some, um, some support with that, with residents that are opting out.

410
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

411
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:50,042
[SPEAKER_11]: And we do try to do outreach periodically through different mechanisms, basically warning people

412
00:37:50,544 --> 00:37:57,606
[SPEAKER_11]: about what John explained a few minutes ago, about the people who call, who knock on your door, who ask to see your electric rates.

413
00:37:58,347 --> 00:38:06,249
[SPEAKER_11]: I tend to monitor the social media sites next door and Facebook for people talking about things like this, provide information.

414
00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:09,070
[SPEAKER_11]: From time to time, we've put articles in the paper.

415
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:14,232
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to admit that off the top of my head, I cannot tell you if we've done one of those in the last 10 months.

416
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:27,150
[SPEAKER_11]: I've done a lot of outreach in the last 10 months, but I couldn't tell you if during the pandemic we did outreach around electricity suppliers and scams, although I think that we did.

417
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:33,511
[SPEAKER_11]: What we did do is outreach about, quote, Medford runs on green energy.

418
00:38:34,292 --> 00:38:39,873
[SPEAKER_11]: We attempted to do a local and green business walkthrough in place of our regular energy festival.

419
00:38:40,633 --> 00:38:44,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Green Energy Consumer Alliance partners with us on that festival every year.

420
00:38:45,195 --> 00:38:50,659
[SPEAKER_11]: And they partnered with us this year to do some outreach around the aggregation.

421
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,501
[SPEAKER_11]: It was more subtle than that.

422
00:38:52,741 --> 00:38:55,023
[SPEAKER_11]: The outreach was learn about the aggregation.

423
00:38:55,784 --> 00:38:57,245
[SPEAKER_11]: And they did a webinar.

424
00:38:57,385 --> 00:39:00,647
[SPEAKER_11]: The webinar we then had replayed on Medford Cable Network.

425
00:39:01,128 --> 00:39:01,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Cable.

426
00:39:01,868 --> 00:39:09,594
[SPEAKER_11]: And we had yard signs put out about Medford runs on green energy and directed people to a website so they could learn more.

427
00:39:09,795 --> 00:39:12,397
[SPEAKER_11]: And what they learned about was the Medford aggregation.

428
00:39:12,937 --> 00:39:20,461
[SPEAKER_11]: that was aimed towards letting people know about this opportunity to opt up to 100% green energy.

429
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:29,966
[SPEAKER_11]: We also last winter in December and January put together a series of videos about the aggregation.

430
00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:31,606
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's one long video.

431
00:39:31,726 --> 00:39:33,387
[SPEAKER_11]: It's me being interviewed by a resident.

432
00:39:33,427 --> 00:39:34,528
[SPEAKER_11]: It's 30 minutes long.

433
00:39:35,188 --> 00:39:38,830
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there are a series of couple of minute clips

434
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:41,098
[SPEAKER_11]: about the aggregation.

435
00:39:41,618 --> 00:39:45,519
[SPEAKER_11]: All of that's available on the Medford Cable TV site.

436
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:47,539
[SPEAKER_11]: We've shared it on Facebook.

437
00:39:47,879 --> 00:39:57,181
[SPEAKER_11]: The intention was to keep sharing it periodically on Facebook, but I have to tell you that the pandemic sucked up all the airwaves, all the bandwidth.

438
00:39:57,301 --> 00:40:03,082
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that there is, it is a great idea now to start doing outreach again about the aggregation.

439
00:40:03,202 --> 00:40:07,603
[SPEAKER_11]: And we do have these materials, these videos that we can use that explain it.

440
00:40:09,247 --> 00:40:10,948
[SPEAKER_11]: I just have to say that over the course of this past summer.

441
00:40:10,968 --> 00:40:11,168
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess.

442
00:40:11,788 --> 00:40:12,288
[SPEAKER_11]: But thank you.

443
00:40:12,308 --> 00:40:12,368
[SPEAKER_11]: And

444
00:40:31,111 --> 00:40:31,931
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

445
00:40:32,051 --> 00:40:35,712
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, if I could, through the chair, I just want to say thank you to Alicia, Jema, and John.

446
00:40:35,732 --> 00:40:39,473
[SPEAKER_12]: This is really helpful to get an update and see the impact that this is making.

447
00:40:40,113 --> 00:40:43,614
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Behrs took the question I was going to ask about the percentages.

448
00:40:43,654 --> 00:40:49,215
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want to confirm that those percentages can only be set at the time of when the contract is set.

449
00:40:49,235 --> 00:40:51,135
[SPEAKER_12]: They can't be adjusted at any other time.

450
00:40:52,956 --> 00:40:53,696
[SPEAKER_11]: That is correct.

451
00:40:53,856 --> 00:40:56,476
[SPEAKER_11]: And also I misspoke on the URL.

452
00:40:57,236 --> 00:40:59,777
[SPEAKER_11]: It's medfordcea.com.

453
00:41:00,862 --> 00:41:02,643
[SPEAKER_11]: So is the, and I will put that in there.

454
00:41:02,663 --> 00:41:04,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor, if I could take that question.

455
00:41:05,285 --> 00:41:15,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, we can go all the way to bid day, when we go out to bid, to make a decision on that percentage.

456
00:41:15,191 --> 00:41:20,854
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can happen right at bid day.

457
00:41:22,055 --> 00:41:30,620
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way we put the flexible language in our contracts, so we're enabled to do it that way.

458
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:32,820
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I'm sorry.

459
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:42,122
[SPEAKER_12]: So we would or we wouldn't be able to, you know, if it was so decided, revisit this percentage before the 2022 renewal?

460
00:41:44,322 --> 00:41:58,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, certainly you can, you can visit it before, but you have until the bid day, the actual bid for the electricity to make a final decision on the percentage that you want, whether it be 5% or 10% or some other percent.

461
00:42:02,678 --> 00:42:03,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

462
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

463
00:42:07,061 --> 00:42:13,005
[SPEAKER_07]: And once again, that website is MedfordCEA.com, is that correct, Alicia?

464
00:42:13,526 --> 00:42:13,806
Okay.

465
00:42:13,886 --> 00:42:14,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

466
00:42:14,326 --> 00:42:15,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other questions from the council?

467
00:42:17,389 --> 00:42:22,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, do we have any other questions from people that are online here?

468
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:25,014
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see any hands up.

469
00:42:25,615 --> 00:42:25,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

470
00:42:27,656 --> 00:42:30,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Alicia, John, thank you very much for all your hard work.

471
00:42:30,517 --> 00:42:31,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the presentation.

472
00:42:32,458 --> 00:42:38,141
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Marks, as amended by Councilor Marks twice, am I correct?

473
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:38,642
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

474
00:42:38,662 --> 00:42:39,042
[SPEAKER_17]: Seconded by?

475
00:42:39,082 --> 00:42:40,843
[SPEAKER_17]: Second by Vice President.

476
00:42:40,883 --> 00:42:41,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Caviello?

477
00:42:43,584 --> 00:42:44,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Clerk Herterby, please call the roll.

478
00:42:48,827 --> 00:42:49,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Behrs?

479
00:42:49,647 --> 00:42:49,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

480
00:42:50,908 --> 00:42:51,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Caviello?

481
00:42:51,748 --> 00:42:52,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

482
00:42:52,489 --> 00:42:52,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Night?

483
00:42:53,069 --> 00:42:53,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

484
00:42:53,669 --> 00:42:54,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks?

485
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:54,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

486
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:55,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Morrell?

487
00:42:56,531 --> 00:42:56,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

488
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli?

489
00:42:58,355 --> 00:42:58,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

490
00:42:59,475 --> 00:43:00,116
[SPEAKER_05]: President Falco?

491
00:43:00,456 --> 00:43:01,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

492
00:43:01,336 --> 00:43:03,376
[SPEAKER_07]: 70 affirmers, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

493
00:43:04,837 --> 00:43:05,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Neidt?

494
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:05,397
20647.

495
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:14,719
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Neidt, 20647 offered by Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Marks, and Vice President Carviello.

496
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:26,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the City Council request the presence from Chief Buckley and Chief Gilberti to discuss public safety concerns dealing with our 911 system at our next scheduled meeting.

497
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:29,972
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

498
00:43:30,032 --> 00:43:34,015
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I believe it's the sponsor.

499
00:43:35,156 --> 00:43:35,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

500
00:43:35,457 --> 00:43:37,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scott Kelly, would you like to speak on this?

501
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:37,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I'll start.

502
00:43:37,979 --> 00:43:40,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you Mr. President.

503
00:43:43,147 --> 00:43:47,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, this is a concern that was brought to my attention.

504
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:54,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, there was an email that was sent by the administration explaining some concerns that we have.

505
00:43:55,957 --> 00:44:09,306
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want, basically what it is, is having the chief of police and chief of fire to come explain to the council that there are some 911 concerns and if that's

506
00:44:10,788 --> 00:44:22,721
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's something that's really putting our community in serious jeopardy and some serious concerns, I think that we need to hear it from them directly to make sure that we know what's going on.

507
00:44:22,761 --> 00:44:27,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as well as my council, I think we talked to hundreds of people.

508
00:44:28,468 --> 00:44:33,194
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the first time I've heard that there's been a concern.

509
00:44:33,274 --> 00:44:41,465
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that just having them give us a brief update in what they're seeing as a serious concern to our community.

510
00:44:41,485 --> 00:44:43,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, I find it

511
00:44:45,305 --> 00:44:54,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Disturbing that the council's finding this out now that there's something because if something's going on and we're finding out about it now and not being Surprised of it.

512
00:44:54,374 --> 00:44:57,416
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's it's it's you know partisan.

513
00:44:57,777 --> 00:44:58,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

514
00:44:58,317 --> 00:45:01,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you councilor Scott Kelly council marks

515
00:45:02,459 --> 00:45:03,300
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

516
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,302
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to thank my colleagues for putting this on.

517
00:45:05,882 --> 00:45:21,995
[SPEAKER_18]: As Councilor Scott Pelly mentioned, November 19th, this Method City Council received an email from the mayor outlining her concern regarding the council tabling her paper, which was a $740,000 supplemental to this year's budget.

518
00:45:26,658 --> 00:45:33,461
[SPEAKER_18]: which added several positions and some other odd items, Mr. President, within this year's budget.

519
00:45:34,181 --> 00:45:38,043
[SPEAKER_18]: The council did have some questions regarding some of the positions.

520
00:45:38,423 --> 00:45:52,749
[SPEAKER_18]: We asked for job descriptions and we also asked that we address an issue that a longstanding issue this council has been talking about regarding hiring of the election coordinator position to assist

521
00:45:53,409 --> 00:45:56,652
[SPEAKER_18]: in the clerk's office with running these very important elections.

522
00:45:57,853 --> 00:46:12,725
[SPEAKER_18]: Since then, Mr. President, we received this email on November 19th because the paper was tabled and the mayor within the paper mentioned that this 9-1-1 position for supervisor is an emergency.

523
00:46:13,405 --> 00:46:25,692
[SPEAKER_18]: And as my colleague, Councilor Scott Kelly mentioned, that actually raised my eyebrows, Mr. President, because I have yet to hear anything about an emergency taking place at our 911 center.

524
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:48,645
[SPEAKER_18]: The mayor went on to state that she met just recently with the dispatchers, members of the fire and police departments, and both chiefs of the police and fire, as well as Lieutenant Rudolph, who we heard make a presentation a couple weeks back regarding, I guess he is the oversight now of

525
00:46:51,445 --> 00:47:03,992
[SPEAKER_18]: So based on the mayor's letter and the fact that she mentions the position as an emergency, she stated in the letter that it's a critical need for the operation of public safety.

526
00:47:05,253 --> 00:47:12,817
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think it's only appropriate that we as a council are aware if there is a critical need with 911,

527
00:47:14,118 --> 00:47:22,545
[SPEAKER_18]: which is vital to the function and safety of our residents, that we should be at least privy to what's going on, Mr. President.

528
00:47:23,605 --> 00:47:34,634
[SPEAKER_18]: It also mentioned that the mayor is bringing in someone to assist with the development of a unified training manual, rules, policies, procedures.

529
00:47:35,134 --> 00:47:37,836
[SPEAKER_18]: and chain of command protocol.

530
00:47:38,557 --> 00:47:44,321
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, this operation for 911 with civilians has been in place for a year and a half.

531
00:47:45,021 --> 00:47:58,231
[SPEAKER_18]: If unified training manual does not exist, if rules, policies, and procedures and command protocol doesn't exist for a year and a half, maybe there is a serious problem, Mr. President, that we should be made aware of.

532
00:47:58,712 --> 00:48:01,674
[SPEAKER_18]: So that really alarms me, Mr. President.

533
00:48:02,394 --> 00:48:06,897
[SPEAKER_18]: I think this resolution is calling to get information regarding what's happening.

534
00:48:07,738 --> 00:48:17,664
[SPEAKER_18]: When this was presented, the $740,000 to address several positions of which one was the supervisor of the 911 center.

535
00:48:18,025 --> 00:48:25,109
[SPEAKER_18]: There was never one iota, not one mention of this grave of a concern in the 911 center.

536
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:27,070
[SPEAKER_18]: of an emergency.

537
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:28,811
[SPEAKER_18]: Not one mention, Mr. President.

538
00:48:29,071 --> 00:48:30,451
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe my other colleagues heard it.

539
00:48:30,872 --> 00:48:32,592
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't hear any mention of that.

540
00:48:33,152 --> 00:48:35,113
[SPEAKER_18]: I also had a conversation, Mr. President.

541
00:48:35,133 --> 00:48:35,973
[SPEAKER_18]: I picked up the phone.

542
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:40,455
[SPEAKER_18]: I reached out to the union representative for the dispatches.

543
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:46,873
[SPEAKER_18]: Officer Harold McGillivray, he's also the union representative for the Patrolmen's Association.

544
00:48:47,173 --> 00:48:55,081
[SPEAKER_18]: And I asked him point blank, are you aware of any emergency that's taking place right now for public safety within 911?

545
00:48:55,802 --> 00:49:00,066
[SPEAKER_18]: And he stated to me, Mr. President, and he could speak for his own, he's very eloquent.

546
00:49:00,406 --> 00:49:05,711
[SPEAKER_18]: He said, I am unaware of any public safety emergency happening currently at the 911 center.

547
00:49:08,198 --> 00:49:12,781
[SPEAKER_18]: So that flies in the face with the November 19th email we received.

548
00:49:13,181 --> 00:49:24,988
[SPEAKER_18]: Unless that email is nothing but a scare tactic to get us to vote for a paper that, in my opinion, was flawed, Mr. President, and didn't address some of the concerns that we as a council had.

549
00:49:25,608 --> 00:49:30,351
[SPEAKER_18]: So I hope we get some answers, Mr. President, from the two chiefs.

550
00:49:31,611 --> 00:49:32,832
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to hear what's going on.

551
00:49:33,172 --> 00:49:40,295
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe this may require, because we're talking about sensitive public safety information, maybe an executive session next week.

552
00:49:40,595 --> 00:49:43,637
[SPEAKER_18]: Who knows, but we have to be prepared if that's the case.

553
00:49:44,057 --> 00:49:55,742
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I refuse to sit here and hear once again that we can't discuss concerns of public safety like we did a month ago regarding a breach of information.

554
00:49:56,362 --> 00:50:05,104
[SPEAKER_18]: from city and school employees where private information was taken, Mr. President, and that we couldn't discuss it as a council.

555
00:50:05,644 --> 00:50:07,185
[SPEAKER_18]: We couldn't go into executive session.

556
00:50:07,425 --> 00:50:09,565
[SPEAKER_18]: We couldn't find out anything about this information.

557
00:50:09,985 --> 00:50:18,848
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm not going to sit around and sit back, Mr. President, when I'm hearing from the mayor that there's an emergency within 911 call center.

558
00:50:18,868 --> 00:50:19,228
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

559
00:50:19,908 --> 00:50:20,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

560
00:50:21,288 --> 00:50:22,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Carpio.

561
00:50:23,269 --> 00:50:24,109
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

562
00:50:27,712 --> 00:50:35,495
[SPEAKER_13]: I had the opportunity to speak with Chief Gilberti on this also, along with Officer McGivery.

563
00:50:35,955 --> 00:50:39,297
[SPEAKER_13]: And I didn't get the sense of any emergency happening either.

564
00:50:39,577 --> 00:50:42,478
[SPEAKER_13]: So if there is an emergency, I agree with Councilor Mox.

565
00:50:43,758 --> 00:50:48,380
[SPEAKER_13]: By all means, I mean, we should know immediately if there's an emergency happening.

566
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:52,922
[SPEAKER_13]: If there was an emergency, if it was such a big emergency, I don't know why we're not dealing with it tonight.

567
00:50:54,126 --> 00:50:56,848
[SPEAKER_13]: And waiting another week if it's so grave.

568
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:02,792
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the reason that this is out there, and I support my other councilors on this.

569
00:51:03,332 --> 00:51:04,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

570
00:51:05,974 --> 00:51:06,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Pierce.

571
00:51:07,835 --> 00:51:08,616
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

572
00:51:08,636 --> 00:51:10,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to my colleagues for bringing this forward.

573
00:51:12,198 --> 00:51:16,901
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's disappointing that we're having gamesmanship played right now around this issue.

574
00:51:17,021 --> 00:51:17,442
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.

575
00:51:18,954 --> 00:51:20,396
[SPEAKER_00]: We all support this position.

576
00:51:20,596 --> 00:51:21,757
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's in question here.

577
00:51:21,777 --> 00:51:26,381
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we all support most everything that's in the paper that was presented to us a couple weeks ago.

578
00:51:26,401 --> 00:51:27,502
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's the issue.

579
00:51:28,363 --> 00:51:40,194
[SPEAKER_00]: We also all support having the elections coordinator and the position that we need to make sure that we have functional elections, and especially in this new environment with mail voting and early voting and all the other things that are happening with elections.

580
00:51:40,254 --> 00:51:41,335
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes more.

581
00:51:41,935 --> 00:51:43,797
[SPEAKER_00]: We need it, and that's been made clear.

582
00:51:44,467 --> 00:51:54,889
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to what we're talking about with the 9-1-1 dispatcher, we also got a paper out of the blue that says that this could affect our taxation for the next year and affect our bottom line for the budget.

583
00:51:55,650 --> 00:52:10,653
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the easiest way to address this is for a paper to come back next week that has the elections coordinator, has a 9-1-1 supervisor, and gets all of this approved and appropriated before December, this apparent deadline that we've heard from now from the administration, according to the finance director.

584
00:52:11,905 --> 00:52:13,646
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't make sense to me to sit on this.

585
00:52:14,166 --> 00:52:17,728
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're all in agreement on 98% of this.

586
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:19,209
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it's a little give and take.

587
00:52:19,589 --> 00:52:28,813
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some comments, I think, when I was elected and before I was elected that we're going to need to compromise and have unity and integrity.

588
00:52:28,833 --> 00:52:34,176
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not just going to be able to stick our feet in the ground and not get stuff done.

589
00:52:34,556 --> 00:52:36,017
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an easy one for everyone.

590
00:52:36,037 --> 00:52:38,038
[SPEAKER_00]: And it baffles me, Mr. President.

591
00:52:38,138 --> 00:52:39,859
[SPEAKER_00]: It baffles me why we're not moving forward.

592
00:52:41,429 --> 00:52:47,572
[SPEAKER_00]: on something that we basically agree on, and now we're hearing at the last hour, it's an emergency.

593
00:52:48,092 --> 00:52:50,613
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to affect our taxes for years.

594
00:52:51,774 --> 00:52:53,195
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I'd known that six months ago.

595
00:52:53,215 --> 00:52:54,295
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I'd known that a month ago.

596
00:52:54,335 --> 00:52:55,676
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I'd known that two weeks ago.

597
00:52:57,617 --> 00:52:58,677
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it just baffles me.

598
00:52:58,837 --> 00:52:59,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

599
00:52:59,938 --> 00:53:00,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Counselor Fierce.

600
00:53:01,019 --> 00:53:01,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Counselor Knight.

601
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,000
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Mr. President.

602
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:07,081
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd just ask that Lieutenant Rudolph be invited to the meeting as well.

603
00:53:07,262 --> 00:53:08,202
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought he did a great job.

604
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:10,819
[SPEAKER_15]: when it came down to explaining the need for the position.

605
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:14,841
[SPEAKER_15]: He talked a lot about cost savings measures in terms of internal training and the like.

606
00:53:15,001 --> 00:53:16,502
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought his presentation was great.

607
00:53:17,462 --> 00:53:22,905
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought his presentation was far better than the emails that I've received over the course of the week since that presentation closed, Mr. President.

608
00:53:23,565 --> 00:53:24,605
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a position I support.

609
00:53:24,925 --> 00:53:26,226
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's a position we all support.

610
00:53:26,806 --> 00:53:30,068
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm a firm believer that there's a couple ways we can go about this.

611
00:53:30,288 --> 00:53:32,089
[SPEAKER_15]: We can go about carving this piece right out.

612
00:53:32,824 --> 00:53:40,390
[SPEAKER_15]: If that's the case, if it's such a public safety emergency, they can carve this piece out of the paper that's before us and on the table and present it to us separately, individually.

613
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:45,755
[SPEAKER_15]: When we think about the paper that's before us for $740,000 and you look at it, $200,000 of those dollars is money for a facility's operations account.

614
00:53:51,672 --> 00:53:54,633
[SPEAKER_15]: And $300,000 of those dollars are to fund union contracts.

615
00:53:54,653 --> 00:54:01,575
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's more than three-quarters of the payable that are made up of funds that aren't funding positions, but funding things, Mr. President.

616
00:54:02,055 --> 00:54:02,955
[SPEAKER_15]: Not people, but things.

617
00:54:03,456 --> 00:54:08,277
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, I certainly understand the need to get this done before we set the tax rate.

618
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:12,222
[SPEAKER_15]: And I certainly feel as though there is room for compromise.

619
00:54:13,243 --> 00:54:21,188
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that the chief of staff made a decent attempt at it, but without the buy-in from his boss, it was very difficult for him to commit to it.

620
00:54:21,848 --> 00:54:31,995
[SPEAKER_15]: And I certainly would support moving forward in that regard, where we reduce the facility's management account by $100,000 and set that money aside to fund an elections coordinator position.

621
00:54:32,996 --> 00:54:36,758
[SPEAKER_15]: I also said last meeting that I'm not too crazy about Robin Peter to pay Paul.

622
00:54:37,383 --> 00:54:43,285
[SPEAKER_15]: And that the administrative assessor, the facilities management positions are positions that we've asked for.

623
00:54:43,485 --> 00:54:46,427
[SPEAKER_15]: This council's requested in the past, and we're getting something we're looking for.

624
00:54:47,147 --> 00:54:53,730
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I certainly would move forward and support the resolution to have a meeting discussing the public safety concerns down there.

625
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:59,732
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'd ask that Lieutenant Rudolph be invited to attend as well, because he gave such a great presentation last time that I don't want that to get lost.

626
00:55:03,532 --> 00:55:04,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor.

627
00:55:04,213 --> 00:55:12,680
[SPEAKER_07]: And I, Sue, if I may, to the Councilors that offered the resolution, do you want a committee in the whole meeting or do you want the regular meeting, do you want them to appear?

628
00:55:14,101 --> 00:55:14,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Regular meeting.

629
00:55:14,862 --> 00:55:15,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Regular?

630
00:55:15,122 --> 00:55:15,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

631
00:55:15,343 --> 00:55:23,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, regular meeting, but, and I could appreciate Officer Rudolph, but I think it's imperative that our leaders, our chiefs are here on Zoom.

632
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:25,652
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's important that, you know, we, we,

633
00:55:26,482 --> 00:55:36,366
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if there is contradictory, we need to hear from, you know, the, you know, the, the leaders of, uh, two of the most important departments in our community.

634
00:55:36,887 --> 00:55:37,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

635
00:55:37,387 --> 00:55:37,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

636
00:55:37,707 --> 00:55:38,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scott Pelli.

637
00:55:38,608 --> 00:55:39,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Pears.

638
00:55:39,928 --> 00:55:41,669
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would appreciate that update.

639
00:55:43,009 --> 00:55:46,351
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, I personally would refer next week that we resolve this.

640
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:55,015
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, I'm not opposed to getting the update, but I think that, you know, next week we should have a paper on this agenda that would allow us to resolve this to the

641
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:56,956
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfaction of all parties involved.

642
00:55:57,396 --> 00:55:57,736
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

643
00:55:58,236 --> 00:55:58,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

644
00:55:58,517 --> 00:55:59,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Beers.

645
00:55:59,217 --> 00:56:00,998
[SPEAKER_07]: The clerk has a question for Councilor Knight.

646
00:56:01,738 --> 00:56:05,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight, I just, your request for your request to invite Lieutenant Rudolph.

647
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that an amendment to the paper?

648
00:56:06,921 --> 00:56:09,702
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the paper says to invite the two chiefs of police and I'd like to add him.

649
00:56:09,902 --> 00:56:11,023
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's making that request.

650
00:56:11,043 --> 00:56:12,404
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll add it as an amendment.

651
00:56:12,524 --> 00:56:13,284
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll add it as an amendment.

652
00:56:13,324 --> 00:56:13,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

653
00:56:13,965 --> 00:56:19,027
[SPEAKER_15]: But to Councilor Beers' point, if in fact, you know, we have the paper, the paper's been tabled, right?

654
00:56:19,047 --> 00:56:20,228
[SPEAKER_17]: That's correct.

655
00:56:20,248 --> 00:56:20,628
[SPEAKER_17]: You are correct.

656
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Ioannoni, are you all set?

657
00:56:33,141 --> 00:56:34,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, she'll make sure.

658
00:56:35,701 --> 00:56:36,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, are there any questions on this?

659
00:56:37,002 --> 00:56:39,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Any comments or questions on this paper?

660
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:40,503
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Marks.

661
00:56:41,383 --> 00:56:47,284
[SPEAKER_18]: If we are going to invite Lieutenant Rudolph, I would ask that the union representative be invited as well.

662
00:56:47,825 --> 00:56:49,365
[SPEAKER_18]: That represents the dispatches.

663
00:56:51,286 --> 00:56:53,846
[SPEAKER_18]: And that would be Officer Harold McGillivray.

664
00:56:53,866 --> 00:56:55,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

665
00:56:55,747 --> 00:56:56,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Behrs.

666
00:57:00,103 --> 00:57:05,146
[SPEAKER_00]: My point, I know that's something, you know, we have the paper currently tabled on this agenda.

667
00:57:05,706 --> 00:57:09,128
[SPEAKER_00]: My understanding is we can't amend the proposal from the mayor.

668
00:57:09,208 --> 00:57:19,173
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mayor would have to submit a new paper reflecting the agreements or at least hopeful agreements of all parties involved.

669
00:57:19,313 --> 00:57:19,653
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

670
00:57:20,393 --> 00:57:21,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Paris.

671
00:57:21,934 --> 00:57:22,915
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of

672
00:57:24,438 --> 00:57:30,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Marks, and Vice President Caviello, as amended by Councilor Night, and seconded by?

673
00:57:30,403 --> 00:57:32,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Behrs.

674
00:57:33,866 --> 00:57:34,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Please call the roll.

675
00:57:35,528 --> 00:57:37,169
[SPEAKER_18]: Further amended by myself, Mr. President.

676
00:57:37,209 --> 00:57:38,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I apologize.

677
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:38,290
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

678
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:39,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Further amended by Councilor Marks.

679
00:57:45,216 --> 00:57:46,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks, what was your amendment?

680
00:57:46,617 --> 00:57:51,161
[SPEAKER_18]: It was to invite the union representative who represents the dispatches.

681
00:57:53,185 --> 00:57:56,767
[SPEAKER_07]: On that motion, Clerk Hertoghez, please call the roll.

682
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:00,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Behrs?

683
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:01,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

684
00:58:01,651 --> 00:58:02,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Caviello?

685
00:58:02,531 --> 00:58:02,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

686
00:58:03,212 --> 00:58:03,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight?

687
00:58:03,812 --> 00:58:03,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

688
00:58:04,253 --> 00:58:04,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks?

689
00:58:05,053 --> 00:58:05,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

690
00:58:05,493 --> 00:58:06,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Morrell?

691
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:07,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

692
00:58:07,635 --> 00:58:08,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli?

[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

696
00:58:10,137 --> 00:58:11,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

697
00:58:11,818 --> 00:58:12,959
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

698
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,723
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Vice President Caviello to revert back to the regular order of business.

699
00:58:18,843 --> 00:58:20,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

700
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:22,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Clerk Hertoghez, please call the roll.

701
00:58:22,673 --> 00:58:23,173
[SPEAKER_16]: Hang on just a second.

702
00:58:29,236 --> 00:58:30,577
[SPEAKER_05]: To revert to the regular order of business.

703
00:58:31,297 --> 00:58:31,917

704

720
00:58:46,244 --> 00:58:47,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

721
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:51,947
[SPEAKER_07]: 20-644, offered by Vice President Caravaglio and Councilor Night.

722
00:58:52,967 --> 00:59:02,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council congratulate Congresswoman Catherine Clark on her recent election as Assistant Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.

723
00:59:02,729 --> 00:59:03,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Caviello.

724
00:59:04,169 --> 00:59:05,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

725
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:15,952
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm very proud that my friend and colleague, Catherine Clark, has been elected as Assistant Speaker of the House of Representatives.

726
00:59:16,092 --> 00:59:20,353
[SPEAKER_13]: I've known Congresswoman Clark many years now since she's been elected.

727
00:59:22,097 --> 00:59:31,083
[SPEAKER_13]: She's done an outstanding job in her role, and I'm not surprised with her rise in the Democratic Party.

728
00:59:31,523 --> 00:59:44,932
[SPEAKER_13]: And hopefully down the line, she'll be Speaker of the House someday, and take on the role similar to a former Speaker from Massachusetts, Tip O'Neill, where we were able to bring parties together.

729
00:59:45,552 --> 00:59:51,337
[SPEAKER_13]: So congratulations to her, and I know she'll do a great job in bringing everybody together.

730
00:59:51,357 --> 00:59:52,158
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

731
00:59:53,459 --> 00:59:55,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Vice President.

732
00:59:55,481 --> 00:59:56,622
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

733
00:59:56,662 --> 01:00:01,106
[SPEAKER_15]: I echo my colleague's statements and sentiments to understand how important

734
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:05,382
[SPEAKER_15]: this is to the city of Medford and the region is amazing.

735
01:00:05,963 --> 01:00:17,311
[SPEAKER_15]: To have our congressperson as the assistant speaker of the house means that we're going to have direct access to a variety of funds and resources that the federal government is able to provide.

736
01:00:17,611 --> 01:00:25,757
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're going to be able to do so through our congressperson because we all understand how important seniority and leadership roles play in the United States House of Representatives.

737
01:00:26,357 --> 01:00:29,980
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, it's very good to see Catherine Clark be nominated to such a position.

738
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,641
[SPEAKER_15]: She earned it on her merits.

739
01:00:31,801 --> 01:00:36,285
[SPEAKER_15]: She's done a great job since she's been elected, replacing Senator Markey at the time, I believe, right?

740
01:00:37,485 --> 01:00:39,127
[SPEAKER_15]: And since that time, she's done an excellent job.

741
01:00:39,147 --> 01:00:44,791
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I echo my council colleagues' sentiments and I move for approval of the paper.

742
01:00:45,311 --> 01:00:46,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

743
01:00:47,033 --> 01:00:48,434
[SPEAKER_12]: We have Councilor Morrell.

744
01:00:48,454 --> 01:00:50,075
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

745
01:00:50,135 --> 01:00:52,737
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to thank my council colleagues for bringing this forth.

746
01:00:53,539 --> 01:01:02,105
[SPEAKER_12]: to echo what they've said, you know, Congresswoman Clark has shown profound leadership and this new position is really just a reflection of the leadership she's always shown.

747
01:01:03,106 --> 01:01:09,030
[SPEAKER_12]: I think she's nothing but a, I think we all have experienced, she's nothing but a gracious, kind, hardworking representative of this community.

748
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:14,073
[SPEAKER_12]: And this leadership position is a real boon to everyone in Medford and her district.

749
01:01:14,854 --> 01:01:17,996
[SPEAKER_12]: And also just another woman in political leadership representation matters.

750
01:01:18,056 --> 01:01:18,936
[SPEAKER_12]: So happy to see it.

751
01:01:19,337 --> 01:01:19,617
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

752
01:01:22,669 --> 01:01:23,550
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

753
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:40,099
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to add to the kind words of my colleagues, I want to congratulate Congresswoman Clark, who I believe is the only woman other than Nancy Pelosi to hold a position this high in the House of Representatives ever under any party, which I think is a profound accomplishment.

754
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:50,084
[SPEAKER_00]: And Congresswoman Clark is also a progressive champion, and she's putting forward a people's agenda that's going to lift up families and communities and help us recover from this pandemic.

755
01:01:50,124 --> 01:01:51,545
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the HEROES Act and the

756
01:01:52,152 --> 01:02:09,843
[SPEAKER_00]: which we've all been hoping would get through some piece of it for the past several months, is really an indication of where we need to go as a society in terms of really bringing money to cities and towns, to investing communities, to get back to, and not just back, but to get to somewhere better than we were before.

757
01:02:11,304 --> 01:02:12,925
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate the Tip O'Neill reference.

758
01:02:12,965 --> 01:02:19,369
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to bringing parties together, I hope we can bring some big federal money to Massachusetts and fix some of the big problems we have.

759
01:02:19,649 --> 01:02:20,769
[SPEAKER_00]: So congratulations.

760
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:21,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

761
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:23,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

762
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:24,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone else like to speak on this?

763
01:02:26,021 --> 01:02:26,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

764
01:02:27,542 --> 01:02:28,023
[SPEAKER_07]: No hands raised.

765
01:02:28,063 --> 01:02:28,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, perfect.

766
01:02:29,524 --> 01:02:35,989
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd like to thank Congresswoman Clark for her leadership and wish her luck and continued success.

767
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:42,535
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Vice President Cabrillo and Councilor Nights, seconded by Councilor Behrs, Clerk Carter-Bees, please call the roll.

768
01:02:46,985 --> 01:02:47,545

[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

770
01:02:48,685 --> 01:02:49,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Caravaglio.

771
01:02:49,426 --> 01:02:50,886
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, before the vote is called.

772
01:02:50,926 --> 01:02:51,506
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Night.

773
01:02:51,606 --> 01:02:57,907
[SPEAKER_14]: If we could send correspondence to the Congressperson recognizing that we recognize her achievement.

774
01:02:58,267 --> 01:02:59,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we can do that.

775
01:02:59,608 --> 01:03:06,109
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Vice President Caravaglio and Councilor Night as amended by Councilor Night and seconded by Councilor Behrs.

[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

781
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:13,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Night.

782
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:14,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

01:03:14,311 --> 01:03:14,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

784
01:03:15,211 --> 01:03:15,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

785
01:03:15,811 --> 01:03:16,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Morrell.

786
01:03:17,047 --> 01:03:17,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

787
01:03:17,708 --> 01:03:18,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

788
01:03:18,568 --> 01:03:18,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_05]: President Fevella.

790
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:21,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

791
01:03:21,571 --> 01:03:23,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

792
01:03:23,312 --> 01:03:25,894
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

793
01:03:25,914 --> 01:03:27,815
[SPEAKER_07]: 2-0-645 offered by vice-president Carviella.

794
01:03:28,336 --> 01:03:40,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Be resolved that the Medford city council and the Medford police provide information to the community on the three level sex offenders that are being housed in a Medford rehabilitation center that is in a residential neighborhood.

795
01:03:41,326 --> 01:03:42,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice-president Carviella.

796
01:03:42,863 --> 01:03:43,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

797
01:03:43,684 --> 01:03:48,068
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm very upset with this, that we have this in our community.

798
01:03:52,832 --> 01:03:58,897
[SPEAKER_13]: At 5 o'clock tonight, we received a letter from the mayor saying that one of the residents is no longer living there.

799
01:03:59,918 --> 01:04:07,325
[SPEAKER_13]: But one of the biggest things that disturbed me, I had to find out about this at 6 30 in the morning through an online newspaper.

800
01:04:08,872 --> 01:04:13,558
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that was the most troubling fact to me, that I didn't know about this.

801
01:04:15,561 --> 01:04:17,404
[SPEAKER_13]: This happening right down the street from my house.

802
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:23,552
[SPEAKER_13]: On the route where kids go to high school, they walk to church.

803
01:04:26,643 --> 01:04:29,126
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just amazing how this happened and nobody knew about it.

804
01:04:29,807 --> 01:04:43,702
[SPEAKER_13]: My question is, does this facility have some type of contract with Commonwealth of Massachusetts to put sex offenders in this building in such a neighborhood where

805
01:04:45,224 --> 01:04:48,125
[SPEAKER_13]: It's also a nursing home and rehab.

806
01:04:48,146 --> 01:04:58,492
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, how would you like to be going there visiting your mother or father with your children and knowing this is the element that's in there?

807
01:04:59,313 --> 01:05:05,817
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a little shocked at the company for even bringing them in there into a senior nursing home.

808
01:05:06,715 --> 01:05:20,490
[SPEAKER_13]: So like I say, I am shocked and to make it even worse, this is across the street from a group home that had one of their residents assault a senior citizen in our community.

809
01:05:21,887 --> 01:05:27,210
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, I think the communication is gonna increase again.

810
01:05:28,071 --> 01:05:31,793
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think anybody in this community should have found out through this, through an online newspaper.

811
01:05:32,093 --> 01:05:37,016
[SPEAKER_13]: We should have been, maybe the police didn't even know that they were being placed.

812
01:05:37,056 --> 01:05:49,184
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know what the process is, but I hope that something will be done, even with the two other people that are in there, so they're not a burden on our community.

813
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:50,494
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

814
01:05:50,694 --> 01:05:51,995
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Vice President Caravello.

815
01:05:52,295 --> 01:05:52,975
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Morrell.

816
01:05:54,096 --> 01:05:54,936
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

817
01:05:54,956 --> 01:05:57,777
[SPEAKER_12]: And I thank Vice President Caravello for bringing this forward.

818
01:05:58,237 --> 01:06:08,741
[SPEAKER_12]: I found out in a similar manner as I think everyone in the rest of the community did because there's not a great system for this as I understand when it comes to these types of living facilities.

819
01:06:08,921 --> 01:06:16,104
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think to Vice President Caravello's point, I think what is so scary about this essentially is what makes

820
01:06:16,843 --> 01:06:18,223
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's what's great concerning about this.

821
01:06:18,263 --> 01:06:20,544
[SPEAKER_12]: I do understand there's a lot of reality around this and powers we have as a city.

822
01:06:20,564 --> 01:06:20,884
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think

823
01:06:42,059 --> 01:07:06,186
[SPEAKER_12]: We include on our school's website and also the city website, a link to the sex offender registry so that even if this information isn't getting dispersed out for whatever legal reasons right now around the nursing home and care facilities, that people can easily get to these links and look up the information, the sex offenders in their area, because the information is there.

824
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:10,667
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just not getting delivered to us because of this type of facility, as I understand.

825
01:07:11,272 --> 01:07:12,693
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to put that in a thorough motion.

826
01:07:13,975 --> 01:07:18,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Councilor Morrell, would that be an amendment to the main motion offered by Vice President?

827
01:07:19,019 --> 01:07:20,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, an amendment, yes.

828
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:20,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, no problem.

829
01:07:21,502 --> 01:07:21,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

830
01:07:22,442 --> 01:07:26,847
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion by Vice President Caviello, as amended by Councilor Morrell.

831
01:07:26,867 --> 01:07:29,309
[SPEAKER_07]: One minute, please.

832
01:07:29,369 --> 01:07:31,951
[SPEAKER_07]: And seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

833
01:07:32,992 --> 01:07:35,375
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Councilor Behrs, and then we have the Chief of Staff.

834
01:07:35,875 --> 01:07:36,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Behrs.

835
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:38,970
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

836
01:07:39,170 --> 01:07:44,532
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to thank Vice President Carabiello for putting this on the agenda.

837
01:07:45,473 --> 01:07:52,735
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, it's disturbing that we had this case and that we found out in the news, and that it hits so close to home.

838
01:07:53,356 --> 01:07:59,138
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do think we need better procedures for notification, and thank you, Councilor Morrell, for that amendment.

839
01:08:00,258 --> 01:08:05,300
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that we do have some limits from the state, but I'd like to see us at least figure out what our policy is.

840
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,461
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd also like to put an amendment to the paper.

841
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:22,722
[SPEAKER_00]: that we get a summary from the city administration on any current policies around notification to the community for level 3 sex offenders so that we can at least know what the city's plan is going forward if this is to happen in the future.

842
01:08:23,082 --> 01:08:23,383
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

843
01:08:23,828 --> 01:08:24,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

844
01:08:25,228 --> 01:08:26,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scott Kelly, another Chief of Staff.

845
01:08:26,909 --> 01:08:28,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scott Kelly.

846
01:08:28,589 --> 01:08:40,073
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that my comments were similar to my colleagues, but I think honesty is having an open dialogue so people can see all of our second registered sex offenders, not just level three.

847
01:08:40,493 --> 01:08:45,835
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's important that if we have people that can

848
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:52,202
[SPEAKER_03]: do something this sickening and dangerous that their next door neighbors need to be informed.

849
01:08:52,262 --> 01:08:55,023
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thank Councilor Carviello for bringing this forward.

850
01:08:55,043 --> 01:09:02,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is, he's right, it's terrible that we found out this way.

851
01:09:02,365 --> 01:09:09,307
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a former teacher, I think that's a great point that Councilor Morrell put forward in putting this on the websites.

852
01:09:09,347 --> 01:09:12,148
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that parents can go to that anytime.

853
01:09:13,052 --> 01:09:16,993
[SPEAKER_03]: and get it updated so we can, you know, protect our, our kids.

854
01:09:17,233 --> 01:09:18,193
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate that.

855
01:09:18,233 --> 01:09:18,693
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

856
01:09:19,313 --> 01:09:19,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

857
01:09:19,993 --> 01:09:20,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

858
01:09:20,473 --> 01:09:22,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli, vice-president Caviello.

859
01:09:22,694 --> 01:09:23,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you Mr. President.

860
01:09:23,774 --> 01:09:25,094
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to amend the paper further.

861
01:09:25,574 --> 01:09:36,856
[SPEAKER_13]: If we can get something from the nursing, from the facility itself, what their policies and procedures are in, in, in taking people in.

862
01:09:37,996 --> 01:09:40,997
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd also like to know, I'm curious to know if,

863
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:50,311
[SPEAKER_13]: the families of the residents that are already in that nursing home have even been notified of this.

864
01:09:51,572 --> 01:09:54,352
[SPEAKER_13]: So if I can make that in the form of a motion.

865
01:09:55,452 --> 01:09:57,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

866
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:08,775
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's see, we have on the motion of Vice President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly, as amended by Councilor Morrell, Councilor Beers, and Vice President Caviello twice.

867
01:10:09,715 --> 01:10:10,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief of Staff Dave Rodriguez.

868
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:19,088
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't unmute him.

869
01:10:19,208 --> 01:10:22,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you unmute him?

870
01:10:22,989 --> 01:10:23,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

871
01:10:23,789 --> 01:10:26,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for Vice President Cabrera bringing the matter forward.

872
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:37,631
[SPEAKER_04]: The letter that Vice President Cabrera mentioned was sent by the mayor this afternoon to Secretary Tom Turco of the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, as well as the members of the Sex Offender Registry Board.

873
01:10:39,111 --> 01:10:47,753
[SPEAKER_04]: She was horrified by what had happened, and she's requesting that EOPS and SOAR both take a look at the regulations underlying how

874
01:10:48,653 --> 01:10:54,995
[SPEAKER_04]: multiple high-level sex offenders were able to cohabitate within a single place within the city.

875
01:10:55,575 --> 01:11:03,598
[SPEAKER_04]: It was our understanding that there were three, up until this afternoon, there were three level threes and one level two sex offender that were housed at this one facility.

876
01:11:04,258 --> 01:11:12,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Lieutenant Covino of Everett Police has been in contact with the owners and the administrators at the facility.

877
01:11:13,161 --> 01:11:17,502
[SPEAKER_04]: However, the law isn't on our side for as a community trying to regulate these things.

878
01:11:18,062 --> 01:11:20,463
[SPEAKER_04]: We did speak with them, create pressure on them.

879
01:11:21,783 --> 01:11:26,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Chapman, who was the individual who was referencing the news story that kind of brought light to this issue.

880
01:11:27,184 --> 01:11:32,365
[SPEAKER_04]: It's our understanding that this afternoon he was transferred out of that facility permanently and he will not be returning.

881
01:11:33,225 --> 01:11:41,907
[SPEAKER_04]: So while we're heartened by that particular detail, more needs to be done at the state level for a regulatory fashion in order to address how this happened in the first place.

882
01:11:42,403 --> 01:11:50,627
[SPEAKER_04]: These individuals should not be allowed to cohabitate in the same place in such close proximity to individuals who are affected by their actions.

883
01:11:51,187 --> 01:11:52,988
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor sent that letter this afternoon.

884
01:11:53,028 --> 01:11:54,969
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll make that copy available to everyone as well.

885
01:11:56,249 --> 01:11:56,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

886
01:11:57,130 --> 01:11:57,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

887
01:11:58,650 --> 01:11:59,391
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Mr. President.

888
01:11:59,411 --> 01:12:06,654
[SPEAKER_15]: Now this is the same facility that when COVID-19 broke out, we had an inordinate number of deaths at, correct?

889
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:15,555
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they, this was one of the facilities, unfortunately the long-term care facilities were hit pretty hard across the board.

890
01:12:16,255 --> 01:12:19,978
[SPEAKER_04]: This was the one facility that we had a tougher time getting information out of.

891
01:12:21,139 --> 01:12:27,845
[SPEAKER_04]: The folks at Courtyard and some of the other folks were more receptive to our help and providing information to us.

892
01:12:28,425 --> 01:12:29,606
[SPEAKER_04]: These individuals were less so.

893
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:31,628
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is the same facility.

894
01:12:31,868 --> 01:12:32,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Who runs Courtyard?

895
01:12:32,489 --> 01:12:33,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that Genesis Health?

896
01:12:34,593 --> 01:12:35,674
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's Genesis Health.

897
01:12:35,694 --> 01:12:36,575
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a different organization.

898
01:12:36,615 --> 01:12:37,816
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that it's run out of New York.

899
01:12:38,137 --> 01:12:43,622
[SPEAKER_04]: But we can get you the information about who exactly owns it.

900
01:12:43,642 --> 01:12:45,644
[SPEAKER_13]: Genesis owns, yeah, Glenn Ridge.

901
01:12:46,565 --> 01:12:47,406
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so it doesn't apply.

902
01:12:47,426 --> 01:12:48,567
[SPEAKER_15]: They own both of them.

903
01:12:48,607 --> 01:12:50,449
[SPEAKER_15]: So it seems to me like, you know, we have a...

904
01:12:51,649 --> 01:12:55,831
[SPEAKER_15]: this facility in our community that's designed to help people when they're sick.

905
01:12:55,931 --> 01:12:58,192
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're not paying too much attention to that.

906
01:12:58,352 --> 01:13:00,633
[SPEAKER_15]: And actually they're putting our community in danger at this point.

907
01:13:00,653 --> 01:13:07,555
[SPEAKER_15]: They're not paying attention to the COVID-19 guidelines and now they're housing, you know, an inordinate number of sex offenders here in our community.

908
01:13:07,595 --> 01:13:17,059
[SPEAKER_15]: It seems to me like we might want to do a little bit of a review to see if this is someone that we want to be doing business with in this community and whether or not we want to still see them as a permanent entity here in Medford.

909
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:19,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

910
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:22,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other questions, comments?

911
01:13:22,341 --> 01:13:23,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

912
01:13:24,362 --> 01:13:25,242
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

913
01:13:25,262 --> 01:13:28,824
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate Councilor Caviello for putting this on the agenda.

914
01:13:29,624 --> 01:13:39,950
[SPEAKER_18]: I do have a number of questions and I'm not sure if it's appropriate tonight, but it's my understanding level three sex offenders have to register with the local police department.

915
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:41,671
[SPEAKER_18]: Has that happened?

916
01:13:43,251 --> 01:13:45,613
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a loophole for long term facilities?

917
01:13:45,733 --> 01:13:50,596
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that not a requirement if someone is a level two or three sex offender?

918
01:13:51,276 --> 01:13:53,678
[SPEAKER_18]: And are they required to report?

919
01:13:54,158 --> 01:13:56,780
[SPEAKER_18]: That's state statute that requires the reporting.

920
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,101
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's an offense not to report.

921
01:13:59,982 --> 01:14:07,647
[SPEAKER_18]: So I was just wondering if that took place or if there's a loophole within the statute that doesn't require for these type of facilities.

922
01:14:09,223 --> 01:14:16,627
[SPEAKER_04]: While I understand that there is a statute in place that's 100% correct, Lieutenant Covino and the rest of the PD have been dealing with the sex offender issues.

923
01:14:17,007 --> 01:14:18,888
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll defer to them on more of the details.

924
01:14:19,228 --> 01:14:23,871
[SPEAKER_04]: I do know that there's historically been a delay in reporting.

925
01:14:23,951 --> 01:14:31,715
[SPEAKER_04]: So as sex offenders report to SOAR, report to the cities, there's a bit of a lag in those things, and especially with transient populations like this.

926
01:14:32,295 --> 01:14:34,616
[SPEAKER_04]: it can be hard to keep up with them.

927
01:14:34,656 --> 01:14:45,221
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's always, it's a bit tough, but I'll defer to the folks, especially Lieutenant Covino has been working really hard on this, to provide some more details on the nuances of that process.

928
01:14:45,241 --> 01:14:46,522
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do know there are delays in place.

929
01:14:48,149 --> 01:15:04,003
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, so if that's the case, Mr. President, as was stated earlier, that the state statute also requires that these level sex offenders not only report, but be a certain distance away from schools, and churches, and parks, and a number of items, Mr. President.

930
01:15:04,204 --> 01:15:07,206
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't have it in front of me, but I know it spells out a number of items.

931
01:15:07,887 --> 01:15:11,570
[SPEAKER_18]: And who is the responsibility to oversee that?

932
01:15:11,610 --> 01:15:13,792
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it our police department to make sure that

933
01:15:14,733 --> 01:15:20,995
[SPEAKER_18]: because you can go on the website and see where level two and level three sex offenders are within your community currently.

934
01:15:21,735 --> 01:15:31,278
[SPEAKER_18]: And there are pretty stringent requirements also that as long as they report, Mr. President, you're not supposed to harass,

935
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:37,022
[SPEAKER_18]: do anything against these offenders as well.

936
01:15:37,482 --> 01:15:40,524
[SPEAKER_18]: So they have protections as well.

937
01:15:40,864 --> 01:15:49,190
[SPEAKER_18]: However, if they're in violation of state statute because they're too close to an area where they're prohibited to be, that's a major concern of.

938
01:15:49,650 --> 01:16:00,242
[SPEAKER_18]: of us as a community, and I think one that, as Mr. Rodriguez, the Chief of Staff, mentioned, if there is a lag, we've got to figure out why is there a lag and so forth.

939
01:16:00,582 --> 01:16:04,066
[SPEAKER_18]: I put on the agenda a while back, and I'm hoping we have a committee of the whole.

940
01:16:04,266 --> 01:16:05,688
[SPEAKER_18]: I know we've had a lot, Mr. President.

941
01:16:07,109 --> 01:16:20,756
[SPEAKER_18]: But I asked for a public safety summit regarding the incident that Councilor Caviello mentioned about a senior citizen in this community that was assaulted by someone from a group home within the city of Method.

942
01:16:21,136 --> 01:16:23,577
[SPEAKER_18]: And it turned out actually to be

943
01:16:25,718 --> 01:16:36,206
[SPEAKER_18]: better than expected because of this senior's ability to get out of the home and find safety, but it could have been a very dangerous, dangerous situation, Mr. President.

944
01:16:36,526 --> 01:16:46,413
[SPEAKER_18]: And I asked for a public safety summit, and maybe this is another issue that we can put on that agenda and discuss these particular concerns that we have in the community.

945
01:16:46,953 --> 01:16:47,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

946
01:16:47,934 --> 01:16:48,294
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

947
01:16:49,155 --> 01:16:53,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, any of the councils, any more questions, comments from the council?

948
01:16:55,343 --> 01:16:59,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, seeing and hearing none, I believe we have a couple of people that want to have their hands up.

949
01:17:02,666 --> 01:17:05,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anyone want to speak that is on the call?

950
01:17:07,028 --> 01:17:08,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anyone have their hand up?

951
01:17:08,109 --> 01:17:11,070
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see any hands up on the... Melanie, did you want to speak?

952
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:12,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

953
01:17:15,132 --> 01:17:15,832
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't unmute.

954
01:17:15,912 --> 01:17:17,353
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on the- Yes, I'm unmuted.

955
01:17:17,373 --> 01:17:17,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

956
01:17:18,113 --> 01:17:18,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

957
01:17:19,033 --> 01:17:20,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address for the record, please.

958
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:23,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Melanie McLaughlin, Halston Street and Bedford Mass.

959
01:17:26,374 --> 01:17:28,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for the opportunity to speak.

960
01:17:28,075 --> 01:17:35,501
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank Councilor Caraviello and Councilor Morrell and Behrs and Scarpelli for bringing this matter forward.

961
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:40,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of you may know that this is very personal to me.

962
01:17:40,846 --> 01:17:46,630
[SPEAKER_08]: I was the childhood friend of Andy Puglisi, who disappeared from Lawrence, Massachusetts on August 21st, 1976.

963
01:17:49,537 --> 01:17:56,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Wayne Chapman was convicted of raping two of my childhood friends from the same pool where Andy disappeared a year prior.

964
01:17:58,425 --> 01:18:06,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Chapman was arrested just 10 days after Andy vanished and was identified by several people as being at the pool the day that Andy disappeared.

965
01:18:07,753 --> 01:18:12,618
[SPEAKER_08]: This has been a community trauma and a childhood trauma that we have all lived with for a long time.

966
01:18:14,078 --> 01:18:15,559
[SPEAKER_08]: the past 45 years, frankly.

967
01:18:16,599 --> 01:18:31,268
[SPEAKER_08]: It was shocking to learn that this individual who I had been, frankly, researching and know far too much about for the past 20 years had actually, you know, been moved into a facility less than a quarter of a mile away from my home.

968
01:18:32,404 --> 01:18:35,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes life is stranger than fiction.

969
01:18:36,388 --> 01:18:41,613
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really appreciate the chief and other folks who reached out and acted quickly.

970
01:18:41,653 --> 01:18:50,222
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor, for the letter that she wrote to the executive office of public safety and to Tom Turco, who also has been involved in this story for a long time.

971
01:18:50,262 --> 01:18:52,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Mass State Police have known this story for a long time.

972
01:18:52,884 --> 01:18:53,585
[SPEAKER_08]: It goes way back.

973
01:18:54,466 --> 01:18:59,391
[SPEAKER_08]: and this is a very dangerous person that was in our nursing home around the corner.

974
01:19:00,191 --> 01:19:05,476
[SPEAKER_08]: And as you have said, there are two other level threes and one other level two that are placed in this facility.

975
01:19:06,738 --> 01:19:15,306
[SPEAKER_08]: And as Councilor Kerrio or Councilor Marks mentioned, there are very strict laws and Councilor Knight mentioned there are very strict laws around.

976
01:19:16,767 --> 01:19:18,008
[SPEAKER_08]: level three sex offenders.

977
01:19:18,028 --> 01:19:23,770
[SPEAKER_08]: There are communities that tried to set some parameters and were overruled by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.

978
01:19:25,290 --> 01:19:34,494
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things that I would really encourage is for community members to let their local police know if they see violations of level threes.

979
01:19:34,554 --> 01:19:37,395
[SPEAKER_08]: But indeed, you have to know who the level threes are and level twos are.

980
01:19:38,136 --> 01:19:40,759
[SPEAKER_08]: for that matter, to be able to report anything to the police.

981
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:48,889
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's very important that folks do go on to the sex offender registry and look at who in the community is a registered sex offender.

982
01:19:48,949 --> 01:19:53,796
[SPEAKER_08]: To be a registered sex offender, you do have to be among the most dangerous, ruled by

983
01:19:54,289 --> 01:19:56,750
[SPEAKER_08]: the Department of Corrections and by community members.

984
01:19:56,830 --> 01:19:59,591
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are the most dangerous and the most likely to re-offend.

985
01:20:00,512 --> 01:20:22,221
[SPEAKER_08]: And while I do understand that they also have rights, there are ways in which that the community can be notified, like the website on the city, the link to SOAR, the Sex Offender Registry Board, on the city and school websites, and potentially photographs of individuals like you see at City Hall in some of the public buildings that are also

986
01:20:24,002 --> 01:20:32,208
[SPEAKER_08]: The one thing about the facility I do want to say is that there are a few facilities that agree to take level three sex offenders for a number of reasons.

987
01:20:32,948 --> 01:20:43,816
[SPEAKER_08]: So when they do find facilities that are willing to take them, they're often lumped together in that scenario so that you do have clusters of individuals.

988
01:20:44,236 --> 01:20:52,422
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think it's very valid to ask, you know, who the ownership of this facility is and what their

989
01:20:53,884 --> 01:20:59,708
[SPEAKER_08]: requirements are around, you know, level three and level two sex offenders in the facility.

990
01:20:59,748 --> 01:21:01,569
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, I would appreciate that.

991
01:21:01,649 --> 01:21:11,215
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just, I also just want to say from, you know, a sentiment, if I, if I can be sentimental, how much I appreciate, excuse me, the community standing up in this matter.

992
01:21:12,536 --> 01:21:18,659
[SPEAKER_08]: It really does still affect the entire community that lost Andy 45 years ago.

993
01:21:18,759 --> 01:21:22,402
[SPEAKER_08]: So very much appreciate you folks standing up in this matter.

994
01:21:22,582 --> 01:21:22,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

995
01:21:23,375 --> 01:21:24,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mallory.

996
01:21:25,255 --> 01:21:27,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other questions or comments from the council?

997
01:21:27,756 --> 01:21:29,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Would anybody else like to speak on the issue?

998
01:21:29,276 --> 01:21:31,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

999
01:21:34,237 --> 01:21:44,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so on the motion of Vice President Carviello, as amended by Councilor Morrell, Councilor Behrs, Vice President Carviello, and Vice President Carviello again.

1000
01:21:47,779 --> 01:21:48,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Clerk, please call the roll.

1001
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:52,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, in seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1002
01:21:57,311 --> 01:21:57,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, please.

1003
01:22:00,056 --> 01:22:00,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Behrs?

1004
01:22:00,838 --> 01:22:01,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1005
01:22:01,619 --> 01:22:02,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Caraballo?

1006
01:22:02,761 --> 01:22:03,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1007
01:22:03,322 --> 01:22:03,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight?

1008
01:22:03,944 --> 01:22:04,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1009
01:22:04,605 --> 01:22:05,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks?

1010
01:22:05,346 --> 01:22:05,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1011
01:22:06,508 --> 01:22:07,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Morrell?

1012
01:22:07,891 --> 01:22:08,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1013
01:22:08,752 --> 01:22:09,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1014
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:09,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1015
01:22:10,093 --> 01:22:10,773
[SPEAKER_05]: President Fevella?

1016
01:22:11,134 --> 01:22:11,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1017
01:22:11,674 --> 01:22:13,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1018
01:22:13,555 --> 01:22:14,556
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

1019
01:22:14,576 --> 01:22:17,919
[SPEAKER_07]: 20-646 offered by Councilor Morrell.

1020
01:22:17,979 --> 01:22:36,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council receive an update from the administration on progress on initiatives laid out in the city's social justice roadmap, including but not limited to review of police policies, the Medford snap gap study, and the proposed ongoing community conversations on racism.

1021
01:22:37,112 --> 01:22:37,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Morrell?

1022
01:22:39,239 --> 01:22:40,119
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1023
01:22:40,500 --> 01:23:01,591
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank the mayor and her whole team for their work on pulling together and highlighting what Medford's done already in regards to much needed work on social justice, as well as plans for real change within the city to begin to address a long history of systemic racism, which is not unique to Medford, but unique in the fact that this has been acknowledged by both the mayor and this very body.

1024
01:23:02,132 --> 01:23:07,915
[SPEAKER_12]: So this roadmap lays out a number of goals, and I just think it would be beneficial for the council and of course,

1025
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:13,404
[SPEAKER_12]: the residents of Medford to get an update on some of the progress towards the goals outlined in the report.

1026
01:23:14,344 --> 01:23:21,905
[SPEAKER_12]: I do want to note that shortly after submitting this item, I did get in the mail an update on that SNAP gap study, which is a reference.

1027
01:23:21,925 --> 01:23:23,926
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just want to highlight something from that.

1028
01:23:24,006 --> 01:23:27,406
[SPEAKER_12]: So this was completed by the Medford Food Security Task Force.

1029
01:23:28,246 --> 01:23:37,428
[SPEAKER_12]: And so for those who don't know, the SNAP gap, it refers to the difference between the number of low-income mass residents receiving mass health who may be eligible for SNAP

1030
01:23:37,866 --> 01:23:39,627
[SPEAKER_12]: and those who are actually registered for SNAP.

1031
01:23:40,007 --> 01:23:47,309
[SPEAKER_12]: And the gap between those two numbers is 46% at the state level, and it's been found to be 63% at the city level.

1032
01:23:47,769 --> 01:23:58,953
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want to note that because this is a number that's always crucial, but as the pandemic rages on and ravages people's livelihoods with no federal aid at this point, it's a particular problem at this time.

1033
01:23:59,073 --> 01:24:03,234
[SPEAKER_12]: So I really thank the Food Security Task Force for their work on this.

1034
01:24:03,334 --> 01:24:05,955
[SPEAKER_12]: And the whole report is on the city website at this point,

1035
01:24:07,056 --> 01:24:17,724
[SPEAKER_12]: which I think is just really helpful for people to know how this is being tackled with regards to the social justice roadmap, but just in general as this work is always important and ongoing.

1036
01:24:18,705 --> 01:24:30,634
[SPEAKER_12]: So touching on just additional specific issues about, again, I think the mayor and the chief of police for their openness and willingness for policy reviews as laid out by the roadmap, but I do want to highlight that

1037
01:24:31,461 --> 01:24:37,122
[SPEAKER_12]: The mayor did sign on to the Reimagined Policing Pledge back in June, and I know obviously it's a very busy time.

1038
01:24:38,183 --> 01:24:51,566
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is almost six months ago, and one key tenant of this pledge, which was formed to drive communities, it was formed to drive communities, and I quote, to engage in a public review of its policing policies and result in potential reform.

1039
01:24:52,066 --> 01:24:58,828
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think I just want to note the public aspect of this, as it's important to get an update for residents as far as where we are in this process.

1040
01:24:59,893 --> 01:25:10,335
[SPEAKER_12]: And also again, I just want to thank the administration once more for starting what was labeled as being a series of community conversations on race in the city.

1041
01:25:10,515 --> 01:25:11,955
[SPEAKER_12]: And that first one was held in June.

1042
01:25:11,975 --> 01:25:17,536
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, almost six months later, we haven't had another forum on that.

1043
01:25:17,596 --> 01:25:19,817
[SPEAKER_12]: So it would be great to get an update on that.

1044
01:25:20,697 --> 01:25:27,378
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, I do acutely understand the challenges of a lot of this work as the pandemic continues on.

1045
01:25:28,472 --> 01:25:40,337
[SPEAKER_12]: But racism continues on within the pandemic, really, as BIPOC individuals overall have anywhere from a 1.1 to a 2.8 times higher rate of COVID cases.

1046
01:25:41,157 --> 01:25:46,700
[SPEAKER_12]: And also black Americans are dying at a rate 2.1 times higher than white Americans from COVID.

1047
01:25:46,740 --> 01:25:50,601
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is just important work that it goes hand in hand with the pandemic.

1048
01:25:50,641 --> 01:25:52,042
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand the challenges there.

1049
01:25:52,942 --> 01:25:54,023
[SPEAKER_12]: I would also like to add in,

1050
01:25:55,488 --> 01:26:00,191
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to see if we can also get a report out on the civil right.

1051
01:26:00,351 --> 01:26:03,073
[SPEAKER_12]: Just the sheer number of civil right complaints that have come in.

1052
01:26:04,454 --> 01:26:12,418
[SPEAKER_12]: The mayor did a great job in establishing this separate kind of submission way for complaints to the police specifically about civil rights.

1053
01:26:12,458 --> 01:26:20,043
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it would be helpful as this council continues conversations on addressing systemic racism, just to get some of the data back.

1054
01:26:20,964 --> 01:26:24,386
[SPEAKER_12]: So just again, looking for an update and I thank the administration for

1055
01:26:25,002 --> 01:26:29,524
[SPEAKER_12]: their work and putting together this roadmap and outlining some goals within it.

1056
01:26:30,864 --> 01:26:31,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

1057
01:26:33,065 --> 01:26:33,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Pierce.

1058
01:26:34,886 --> 01:26:36,206
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1059
01:26:36,326 --> 01:26:38,427
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Councilor Morrell, for putting this forward.

1060
01:26:39,047 --> 01:26:45,030
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the social justice roadmap is an interesting and helpful summary of the work that has been going on.

1061
01:26:46,763 --> 01:27:02,533
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it puts us ahead of a lot of communities, which I think is a good thing, that we are really taking a citywide and city government wide look at the issues of racism and discrimination and civil rights and social justice.

1062
01:27:03,233 --> 01:27:04,634
[SPEAKER_00]: But I agree with Councilor Morrell.

1063
01:27:04,694 --> 01:27:09,737
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think an understanding of how the roadmap will be updated

1064
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:19,126
[SPEAKER_00]: For transparency sake, for follow through, for the public process that a lot of these items will require, it's going to be really helpful for everyone in the city.

1065
01:27:19,146 --> 01:27:32,056
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you know, I think I make this point a lot, but between this item and some of the other things we've discussed tonight, I think it really shows how deeply under-resourced we are as a community.

1066
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:35,178
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I've been harping on this and will continue to do so.

1067
01:27:36,293 --> 01:27:41,276
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do not have enough to do the basics, never mind everything that we need to do.

1068
01:27:41,816 --> 01:27:51,201
[SPEAKER_00]: And I continue and will continue to push all of us to think about ways that we can increase the resources for our city government here in Medford.

1069
01:27:52,602 --> 01:27:53,482
[SPEAKER_00]: It's long overdue.

1070
01:27:53,502 --> 01:27:56,104
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've been in crisis for a long time.

1071
01:27:56,204 --> 01:27:59,526
[SPEAKER_00]: I've felt that way ever since I was a kid living in this community.

1072
01:28:02,037 --> 01:28:10,479
[SPEAKER_00]: We are deeply under-resourced, and this is just one of the many, many examples of not having what we need to follow through on what the people of Medford deserve.

1073
01:28:10,999 --> 01:28:11,959
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1074
01:28:12,339 --> 01:28:13,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Piers.

1075
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:21,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other questions or comments from the Council?

1076
01:28:21,621 --> 01:28:22,941
[SPEAKER_06]: No hands up in the gallery.

1077
01:28:23,862 --> 01:28:26,022
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion of- Hey, President.

1078
01:28:27,382 --> 01:28:27,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Merrill?

1079
01:28:28,663 --> 01:28:29,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Jackie Peek says her hand up.

1080
01:28:29,863 --> 01:28:30,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1081
01:28:31,025 --> 01:28:31,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Jackie Peeks.

1082
01:28:33,327 --> 01:28:35,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, if I may.

1083
01:28:35,068 --> 01:28:37,651
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Councilor Knight first and then we're going to unmute Jackie Peeks.

1084
01:28:38,331 --> 01:28:39,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

1085
01:28:39,953 --> 01:28:48,200
[SPEAKER_15]: It's also often that this council requests updates from the administration and the updates from the administration come in the form of someone appearing before the council, which is all well and good.

1086
01:28:48,220 --> 01:28:49,641
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think any of us have a problem with that.

1087
01:28:50,502 --> 01:28:54,085
[SPEAKER_15]: But there's also the black and white response on a piece of paper.

1088
01:28:54,731 --> 01:29:01,094
[SPEAKER_15]: Which is very nice to have as well, Mr. President, because if we're asking for updates on certain programs or measurables, we have it in writing.

1089
01:29:01,114 --> 01:29:04,836
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we can look at the old update and the new update and see how far we've come.

1090
01:29:05,316 --> 01:29:06,957
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that that's something that's been lacking.

1091
01:29:07,017 --> 01:29:12,460
[SPEAKER_15]: So moving forward, I think it will be very important for us when we ask for updates from the administration that we get those updates in writing.

1092
01:29:13,415 --> 01:29:20,360
[SPEAKER_15]: First and foremost, if the administration wants to come and appear before the council and be on the big screen here, that's okay, too.

1093
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:29,767
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think that getting it in writing is probably more important than anything else at this point, Mr. President, so that we can have a file on a topic as opposed to going back and watching old meetings.

1094
01:29:29,807 --> 01:29:30,688
[SPEAKER_15]: When was that meeting again?

1095
01:29:30,708 --> 01:29:31,488
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, let's go back.

1096
01:29:31,528 --> 01:29:32,749
[SPEAKER_15]: How many minutes into it was it?

1097
01:29:32,789 --> 01:29:34,730
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, it was 17 minutes and 22 seconds.

1098
01:29:34,810 --> 01:29:35,551
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, hit start.

1099
01:29:35,571 --> 01:29:39,794
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see where we were from the last time we were here versus the update that we can have in writing and put in the file.

1100
01:29:39,814 --> 01:29:42,116
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that's very important, Mr. President, moving forward.

1101
01:29:42,756 --> 01:29:46,761
[SPEAKER_15]: make that request that the administration provide updates to the council in that fashion.

1102
01:29:47,462 --> 01:29:49,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that an amendment?

1103
01:29:49,344 --> 01:29:50,225
[SPEAKER_15]: I will make it a B paper.

1104
01:29:50,525 --> 01:29:51,346
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll make it a B paper.

1105
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:51,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1106
01:29:53,315 --> 01:29:55,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have that, Clerk Carnavis?

1107
01:29:55,996 --> 01:29:56,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me a promotion.

1108
01:29:58,238 --> 01:30:01,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Night wants amendments from the administration in writing going forward, and it's a B paper?

1109
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:02,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

1110
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:05,622
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion by Councilor Night, we'll take the B paper first.

1111
01:30:06,402 --> 01:30:09,104
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Night, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1112
01:30:09,144 --> 01:30:10,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Clerk Carnavis, please call the roll.

1113
01:30:11,025 --> 01:30:12,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I apologize.

1114
01:30:12,585 --> 01:30:14,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Morrell, I think you were up next.

1115
01:30:16,348 --> 01:30:18,349
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I was just highlighting that Jackie had her hand raised.

1116
01:30:18,769 --> 01:30:19,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1117
01:30:19,189 --> 01:30:19,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Jackie's unmuted.

1118
01:30:20,410 --> 01:30:22,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Jackie, you're up next.

1119
01:30:24,293 --> 01:30:26,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you, President Falco.

1120
01:30:27,176 --> 01:30:31,920
[SPEAKER_01]: I absolutely intend to provide a more extensive update, and Ryan, you can get that to you.

1121
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:38,386
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to give a quick update, particularly on some of the things that Councilor Morrell had highlighted.

1122
01:30:38,446 --> 01:30:40,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are actually on my list as well.

1123
01:30:41,829 --> 01:30:45,871
[SPEAKER_01]: The SNAPGAP report that Councilor Morrell brought up is linked on the website.

1124
01:30:45,891 --> 01:30:52,434
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been added to the roadmap itself, as have a couple of other updates in the last couple of weeks in particular.

1125
01:30:53,015 --> 01:31:00,778
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I did want to note for the SNAPGAP piece in particular is that the Food Security Task Force has been giving updates.

1126
01:31:00,818 --> 01:31:02,999
[SPEAKER_01]: They just recently presented to the school committee.

1127
01:31:03,019 --> 01:31:09,743
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're actually in the process of hosting and hiring for a dedicated individual who

1128
01:31:10,352 --> 01:31:18,238
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll work with folks to qualify for resources and supports that may not know how to go through the application process or to access those.

1129
01:31:18,979 --> 01:31:33,951
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're in the process of getting somebody on board who can specifically work with members of the community who qualify for resources to help to close that gap and make sure that it's not just, you know, that everyone has an understanding of how they can access that.

1130
01:31:33,971 --> 01:31:36,734
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's in process and has been for a little bit.

1131
01:31:37,794 --> 01:31:55,363
[SPEAKER_01]: With regard to the review of policing, it's my understanding that the police department is still working directly with the Human Rights Commission on review of their policies that they have for months and years before we have this specific roadmap laid out.

1132
01:31:56,443 --> 01:32:03,827
[SPEAKER_01]: So any members of the public can attend the Human Rights Commission meeting, but I'll get a specific follow-up on where that stands.

1133
01:32:04,587 --> 01:32:18,339
[SPEAKER_01]: I did want to just quickly highlight another update that's in the report is that the police department did just submit last month a pretty significant application to help support phase one of body cameras.

1134
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:26,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't have any word yet on whether we've received that application, that award, excuse me, but we're moving forward on that as well.

1135
01:32:27,487 --> 01:32:30,849
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with the community conversation, we definitely have,

1136
01:32:32,925 --> 01:32:33,925
[SPEAKER_01]: meetings in the works.

1137
01:32:34,005 --> 01:32:47,711
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that we're working on specifically is with relation to the MVP grant that the Office of Community Development and the Board of Health and other folks internally as well as external partners are working on.

1138
01:32:47,912 --> 01:32:55,035
[SPEAKER_01]: And the action steps that were identified out of that report really focused on the need for extended resources and communication with

1139
01:32:56,095 --> 01:32:58,197
[SPEAKER_01]: person to speak languages other than English.

1140
01:32:58,217 --> 01:33:14,609
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're doing is they're in the process of hiring some community liaisons in other languages, and we're going to be working through that and working with those community liaisons to actually have a series of smaller meetings in other languages to really, you know, really get people

1141
01:33:16,502 --> 01:33:17,302
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really good point.

1142
01:33:17,342 --> 01:33:18,223
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really good point.

1143
01:33:18,243 --> 01:33:19,303
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really good point.

1144
01:33:19,323 --> 01:33:20,363
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really good point.

1145
01:33:20,383 --> 01:33:22,084
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really good point.

1146
01:33:22,104 --> 01:33:22,924
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really good point.

1147
01:33:22,944 --> 01:33:24,405
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really good point.

1148
01:33:24,445 --> 01:33:25,786
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really good point.

1149
01:33:25,866 --> 01:33:27,026
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really good point.

1150
01:33:27,046 --> 01:33:28,346
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really good point.

1151
01:33:28,366 --> 01:33:29,547
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really good point.

1152
01:33:29,707 --> 01:33:30,807
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really good point.

1153
01:33:30,827 --> 01:33:31,648
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really good point.

1154
01:33:31,708 --> 01:33:33,108
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really good point.

1155
01:33:33,168 --> 01:33:34,869
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really good point.

1156
01:33:35,069 --> 01:33:36,229
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really good point.

1157
01:33:36,249 --> 01:33:37,410
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really good point.

1158
01:33:37,510 --> 01:33:38,710
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really good point.

1159
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:39,871
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really good point.

1160
01:33:39,951 --> 01:33:41,131
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really good point.

1161
01:33:41,151 --> 01:33:42,552
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really good point.

1162
01:33:42,572 --> 01:33:43,672
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really good point.

1163
01:33:43,692 --> 01:33:45,493
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that

1164
01:33:47,498 --> 01:33:48,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Jackie.

1165
01:33:49,159 --> 01:33:49,719
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Jackie.

1166
01:33:50,979 --> 01:33:51,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Jackie.

1167
01:33:51,519 --> 01:33:53,460
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

1168
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:53,580

[SPEAKER_07]: Seven.

[SPEAKER_07]: The affirmative zero.

1187
01:34:15,077 --> 01:34:15,577

[SPEAKER_07]: Reports to committee is 20-576.

1208
01:34:48,842 --> 01:34:55,546
[SPEAKER_07]: On November 17th, 2020, the transportation subcommittee met.

1209
01:34:55,846 --> 01:35:01,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli, would you like to tell us a little about that meeting on the 17th of November, since you are the chairperson?

1210
01:35:02,295 --> 01:35:03,655
[SPEAKER_03]: I will, Mr. President, thank you.

1211
01:35:05,296 --> 01:35:29,800
[SPEAKER_03]: President, Councilor Marks, and Councilor Morrell, it was a deep conversation in the understanding of the process of the DOT moving forward with an aggressive plan for resolution for the Main Street, South Street intersection, as it was named one of the top 200 most dangerous intersections in the state of Massachusetts.

1212
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:45,204
[SPEAKER_03]: We learned the process that we're seeing, that the first phase of collecting data and moving through that to its completion, which is hopefully a light system, you're looking between three to five years.

1213
01:35:46,104 --> 01:35:51,586
[SPEAKER_03]: We've also met with our community leaders here in the city, traffic engineer,

1214
01:35:57,215 --> 01:36:07,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't believe we had representation from MAPIT traffic and I don't think they were invited, but we're looking for immediate.

1215
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:18,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Calming measures, traffic calming measures, low cost traffic calming measures that could be implemented ASAP.

1216
01:36:18,337 --> 01:36:27,085
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll be holding another meeting relatively soon to get an update to see what we can move forward with the parties involved.

1217
01:36:27,125 --> 01:36:27,685
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

1218
01:36:28,226 --> 01:36:28,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1219
01:36:28,706 --> 01:36:30,448
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Scott Crowley.

1220
01:36:30,468 --> 01:36:31,469
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President.

1221
01:36:32,129 --> 01:36:34,892
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Scott Crowley, seconded by Councilor Night.

1222
01:36:37,307 --> 01:36:45,355
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I just want to say that was a very fruitful meeting, and I want to thank Chairman Scott Pelley for calling that meeting.

1223
01:36:46,256 --> 01:36:56,348
[SPEAKER_18]: After all these years, Mr. President, of this council barking about the dangerousness of that particular intersection, we have a lot of them around the community.

1224
01:36:56,748 --> 01:37:08,971
[SPEAKER_18]: But that one in particular, South and Main, Mr. President, it was very pleasing to hear from the project manager from DOT, Mike Trepanier, who from what I hear is a very capable person.

1225
01:37:09,571 --> 01:37:12,632
[SPEAKER_18]: And when he's in charge of something, it gets done.

1226
01:37:13,112 --> 01:37:18,814
[SPEAKER_18]: So I was very pleased to hear that he is responsible for moving this project forward.

1227
01:37:19,134 --> 01:37:30,863
[SPEAKER_18]: He mentioned it's the intersection program that's part of a federal funded program where design dollars come from MassDOT and construction funding comes from MassDOT as well.

1228
01:37:31,603 --> 01:37:40,389
[SPEAKER_18]: And as Councilor Scott Pelly mentioned, they're looking at a three to five year potential program.

1229
01:37:41,370 --> 01:38:04,669
[SPEAKER_18]: And we asked on multiple occasions, the three committee members, that we were looking for some immediate resolve to some of the concerns that have been mentioned by this council regarding raised crosswalks, additional signage, a traffic light at that particular intersection, some low-lying foot for temporary public safety concern.

1230
01:38:05,150 --> 01:38:07,492
[SPEAKER_18]: And from what we heard from the city engine,

1231
01:38:08,292 --> 01:38:17,375
[SPEAKER_16]: the traffic engineer that there's been some discussion over the last eight to ten months regarding some of those minor improvements, temporary improvements.

1232
01:38:17,795 --> 01:38:20,136
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm very pleased to hear that as well.

1233
01:38:21,416 --> 01:38:34,460
[SPEAKER_18]: And one thing I did find interesting is over the years, we've always been told that the intersection of Maine and South was under state control.

1234
01:38:35,587 --> 01:38:44,219
[SPEAKER_18]: And when the gentleman from DOT mentioned that this is kind of outside their boundary, I questioned him and said, what do you mean this is your road?

1235
01:38:44,980 --> 01:38:50,026
[SPEAKER_18]: And come to find out, someone from the state made an additional call to

1236
01:38:54,390 --> 01:38:59,294
[SPEAKER_18]: And district four said there's some cross sectional lines in that particular location.

1237
01:38:59,695 --> 01:39:02,898
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's not clear cut that it's state versus city.

1238
01:39:03,398 --> 01:39:09,463
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think some of that, according to my conversation with the traffic engineer, I think still needs to be ironed out.

1239
01:39:09,924 --> 01:39:13,407
[SPEAKER_18]: But I was very pleased to hear that DOT is going to look at this.

1240
01:39:14,307 --> 01:39:15,808
[SPEAKER_18]: as a total approach.

1241
01:39:16,108 --> 01:39:19,609
[SPEAKER_18]: They're not looking at that intersection as they mentioned all along.

1242
01:39:19,869 --> 01:39:25,131
[SPEAKER_18]: They're looking at from Salem Street all the way down to High Street, going towards Main Street.

1243
01:39:25,771 --> 01:39:29,853
[SPEAKER_18]: And the signalization, the whole length, which makes sense, Mr. President.

1244
01:39:30,473 --> 01:39:33,094
[SPEAKER_18]: And I also want to thank our city clerk.

1245
01:39:34,134 --> 01:39:41,017
[SPEAKER_18]: If you want to read the minutes that were put out by the city clerk, it's really like you attended the meeting.

1246
01:39:42,526 --> 01:39:44,427
[SPEAKER_18]: It's amazing, Mr. President.

1247
01:39:44,708 --> 01:39:46,048
[SPEAKER_18]: Extremely detailed.

1248
01:39:46,529 --> 01:39:50,811
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's extremely, the reason why I bring it up is not to give accolades to the city clerk.

1249
01:39:51,472 --> 01:39:57,636
[SPEAKER_18]: These are the records that will go by, the minutes, someday when, in a year from now, when they say, we didn't say this or that.

1250
01:39:57,976 --> 01:40:01,318
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to have it in writing, Mr. President, the commitments that were made.

1251
01:40:02,099 --> 01:40:03,320
[SPEAKER_18]: during that particular meeting.

1252
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:14,754
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think it's going to go a long way, so I want to thank Chairman Scott Pelley, Councilor Morrell that was on the call that asked a number of good questions, and the City Clerk, Mr. President, for his detailed notes on the meeting.

1253
01:40:15,075 --> 01:40:16,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1260
01:40:26,212 --> 01:40:28,776

1269
01:40:45,272 --> 01:40:50,034
[SPEAKER_03]: I think our state delegates being present at these meetings are very, very important and vital.

1270
01:40:50,634 --> 01:41:00,239

[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let's see.

1358
01:44:11,484 --> 01:44:13,725
[SPEAKER_05]: 20649, offered under suspension by Vice President Caraviello.

1359
01:44:14,466 --> 01:44:21,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council have the Medford Police notify LA Trucking of Everett to find suitable parking arrangements for their tractor trailers.

1360
01:44:22,231 --> 01:44:25,153
[SPEAKER_05]: They are currently parking five tractor trailers on Commercial Street.

1361
01:44:26,596 --> 01:44:28,157
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1362
01:44:28,578 --> 01:44:37,326
[SPEAKER_13]: The reason I brought this up, it was something we talked about a few weeks ago, but LA Trucking out of Everett is now parking five tractor trailers there.

1363
01:44:37,706 --> 01:44:41,510
[SPEAKER_13]: And these are big trailers that are pretty much taking up the whole street.

1364
01:44:42,110 --> 01:44:46,554
[SPEAKER_13]: And the reason I bring it up this week is a local business from Medford,

1365
01:44:48,428 --> 01:44:55,730
[SPEAKER_13]: lost their lot to park their truck, and they decided to park it on Commercial Street over the weekends.

1366
01:44:56,430 --> 01:45:04,172
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, lo and behold, when they came out on Monday to pick up their truck on Monday, 17 tires were cut.

1367
01:45:06,172 --> 01:45:15,235
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, not saying that these guys did it, but again, the gentleman parked in the spot that they normally park in, and somebody cut all his tires.

1368
01:45:17,573 --> 01:45:24,616
[SPEAKER_13]: And it cost the person about $7,000 in truck tires.

1369
01:45:24,676 --> 01:45:28,477
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, this is not a parking lot for the city of Everett, in businesses in Everett.

1370
01:45:28,697 --> 01:45:33,659
[SPEAKER_13]: There was only one truck there that was parked overnight with a flower to play, but all the other trucks are all Everett trucks.

1371
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:40,202
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, it's time that the police get them out of there, go back to where you're from.

1372
01:45:42,236 --> 01:45:44,457
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't, don't say bad enough.

1373
01:45:44,477 --> 01:45:48,719
[SPEAKER_13]: We have the overnight guys that park there, but again, you're parking five trucks there.

1374
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:51,600
[SPEAKER_13]: Time for them to go, Mr. President.

1375
01:45:52,601 --> 01:45:53,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

1376
01:45:54,001 --> 01:45:55,142
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Councilor Knight.

1377
01:45:55,482 --> 01:45:57,903
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we could send that, if we could send that to the police chief also.

1378
01:45:59,303 --> 01:46:04,126
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor, Vice President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Knight, Clerk Urtubis, please call the roll.

1379
01:46:07,527 --> 01:46:08,127

[SPEAKER_07]: Is there another?

1394

[SPEAKER_07]: No more papers in advance.

1395
01:46:26,524 --> 01:46:27,444
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it, no more papers.

1396
01:46:28,605 --> 01:46:33,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Records, the records of the meeting of November 17th, 2020 were passed to Councilor Morrell.

1397
01:46:33,386 --> 01:46:35,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Morrell, how did you find those records?

1398
01:46:36,219 --> 01:46:37,962
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, found them to be in order and move approval.

1416

[SPEAKER_07]: On the affirmative, zero on the negative, the motion passes.

1417
01:46:56,495 --> 01:47:04,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Before we adjourn the meeting tonight, on behalf of the Memphis City Council, I'd like to wish everyone a very happy and healthy Thanksgiving.

1418
01:47:05,441 --> 01:47:07,763
[SPEAKER_07]: And at this point, I recognize Vice President Caviello.

1419
01:47:07,903 --> 01:47:08,523
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1420
01:47:08,563 --> 01:47:13,466
[SPEAKER_13]: This is not a, I thank you for the happy Thanksgiving to the community, but Mr. President,

1421
01:47:15,768 --> 01:47:21,993
[SPEAKER_13]: Would it be possible to have the administration have the cleaning crew come in here and clean this room?

1422
01:47:22,814 --> 01:47:25,596
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it looks like it hasn't been vacuumed in months.

1423
01:47:26,197 --> 01:47:28,218
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean- The trash can is quite full back there.

1424
01:47:28,238 --> 01:47:29,960
[SPEAKER_13]: The trash can is full, there's papers over there, papers over there.

1425
01:47:30,280 --> 01:47:32,762
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, City Council chambers, it's starting to look like a storeroom.

1426
01:47:33,082 --> 01:47:34,183
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1427
01:47:34,483 --> 01:47:40,068
[SPEAKER_13]: But if we could at least have somebody come in and vacuum the floor, and empty the barrels, we'd greatly appreciate it.

1428
01:47:40,625 --> 01:47:41,726
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see what we can do on that.

1429
01:47:41,746 --> 01:47:46,111
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't mind, but I believe there's a contract cleaner that cleans the building, right?

1430
01:47:47,592 --> 01:47:48,553
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll speak with Mr. Roberts.

1431
01:47:53,445 --> 01:47:54,546
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll speak with Mr. Rodriguez.

1432
01:47:54,906 --> 01:47:55,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1433
01:47:55,906 --> 01:47:56,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

1434
01:47:56,727 --> 01:47:57,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

1435
01:47:57,967 --> 01:47:58,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

1436
01:47:58,928 --> 01:48:08,912
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, and to the one thing you can count on this time of year, right around the holidays, especially Thanksgiving, is the generosity in the community.

1437
01:48:09,712 --> 01:48:14,995
[SPEAKER_18]: And one person that stands out, and I don't want to put them on the spot, but Councilor Caviello,

1438
01:48:15,635 --> 01:48:18,277
[SPEAKER_18]: Every year, Mr. President, this isn't Johnny come lately.

1439
01:48:18,678 --> 01:48:21,260
[SPEAKER_18]: He's been doing this for years and years and years.

1440
01:48:21,801 --> 01:48:27,906
[SPEAKER_18]: And he's the first to stand out there and help local families, Mr. President, those that may not even ask for help.

1441
01:48:28,306 --> 01:48:38,495
[SPEAKER_18]: He is the first to get out there and dedicate himself, Mr. President, and put up his own, Mr. President, his own resources on many occasions.

1442
01:48:38,935 --> 01:48:42,559
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just want to personally thank him on behalf of the many people in this community.

1443
01:48:43,234 --> 01:48:44,134
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilman Marcellino.

1444
01:48:44,154 --> 01:48:47,495
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, it's something I've been doing since the day I got elected.

1445
01:48:48,356 --> 01:48:50,436
[SPEAKER_13]: I made a commitment to do it, and I do it every year.

1446
01:48:50,456 --> 01:48:52,737
[SPEAKER_13]: I do it at Thanksgiving, I do it at Christmas.

1447
01:48:52,857 --> 01:48:55,738
[SPEAKER_13]: I help out with the veterans.

1448
01:48:56,859 --> 01:49:04,661
[SPEAKER_13]: For many years, I was doing the veterans on my own park until Don Marcellino stepped in and started getting donations from the veterans group.

1449
01:49:05,582 --> 01:49:06,602
[SPEAKER_13]: But I say I've done St.

1450
01:49:06,642 --> 01:49:07,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Ray, St.

1451
01:49:07,182 --> 01:49:09,063
[SPEAKER_13]: Francis, and many other churches.

1452
01:49:09,903 --> 01:49:13,107
[SPEAKER_13]: And just general people who reach out to me and need some help, I'm glad to help.

1453
01:49:13,167 --> 01:49:19,014
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, I would hope that other members of the community and council maybe do it.

1454
01:49:19,454 --> 01:49:20,456
[SPEAKER_13]: Christmas time is coming up.

1455
01:49:21,116 --> 01:49:22,698
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to adopt a family, let me know.

1456
01:49:22,738 --> 01:49:24,100
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll get you a family to adopt.

1457
01:49:25,021 --> 01:49:29,286
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's always families in need in this community, more need than you think.

1458
01:49:29,967 --> 01:49:33,010
[SPEAKER_13]: But let's say the holidays coming up, Christmas, take some time.

1459
01:49:33,030 --> 01:49:40,796
[SPEAKER_13]: Not a lot of money to buy a bag of food for a family at the holiday time.

1460
01:49:40,816 --> 01:49:42,257
[SPEAKER_13]: So everyone gets to enjoy the holidays.

1461
01:49:42,277 --> 01:49:44,419
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you, Councilor Maxwell.

1462
01:49:44,439 --> 01:49:47,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Vice President Caprio, for your commitment to the community.

1463
01:49:47,521 --> 01:49:50,123
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all set, right?

1464
01:49:50,244 --> 01:49:50,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1465
01:49:50,644 --> 01:49:52,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, on the motion of Scott Soledad.

1466
01:49:53,386 --> 01:49:53,606
